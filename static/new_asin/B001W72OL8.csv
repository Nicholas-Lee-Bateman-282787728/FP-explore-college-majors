3824107,3,B001W72OL8,"There are those who claim that you can't riff a comedy, but I'd say that you can't riff a really good movie either, and that's what Nelson, Murphy and Corbett take on in NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1968). Despite its low budget, its lack of gore (by today's standards), and the catatonic performance of its lead actress, no other horror movie conveys a sense of claustrophobia and adrenaline-fueled panic better than NotLD, and its nihilistic ending is both inevitable and unexpected; in a word, perfect.

Riffing works as a critique of bad movies by lampooning them in real time; it's the viewer vs. the film, and if the riffs are funny enough, the viewer wins. RiffTrax's NotLD feels more like nitpicking than comic deconstruction, and before long I just wanted to watch the movie without the riffing. (But don't do that with this disc -- the movie is skipping video frames from beginning to end, for some reason.)",1429401600,2,914,4.748427672955975

3824113,5,B001W72OL8,I'm a big MST3K fan. Rifftrax is so Awesome. Its just funny crazy time every time I watch. This one was great having all 3 guys riff on it because originally it was just Mike on the special edition. Enjoy its Good.,1396828800,,214,4.119047619047619
3824114,5,B001W72OL8,"Here you have a classic cult horror movie that is funny by itself-Mike and the guys have made this one a Rifftrax cult film!
This is definitely one you will want to watch more than once--I couldn't stop laughing; Bravo to Rifftrax and keep 'em coming!!",1395273600,,252,4.5
3824115,5,B001W72OL8,"What could be better than one of my favorite movies being helped along by the MST3K team?  I'm so glad the guys decided to cover ""Night of the Living Dead"".  They make every movie better!",1390867200,,187,4.314285714285714
3824116,1,B001W72OL8,"Unfortunately my review does not agree with the others. I have been a fan of the MST3K series since 1993 and, as far as Rifftrax goes, I have only seen 9 episodes and none have been memorable except the shorts collections and Plan 9. I feel that the majority of the jokes fell flat and there weren't enough good jokes to revisit this episode. I watched it twice to give it a fair chance but it sounds like their joke barrel has run dry. I'm still looking forward to their Rifftrax on Manos, though.",1364342400,,498,4.308510638297872
3824117,5,B001W72OL8,"I LOVE MST3K.  Rifftrax is basically where MST3K left off.  This movie is actually pretty interesting, so you may want to watch it through WITHOUT the rifftrack B4 you watch it WITH the rifftrack.  Fantastic, and TOTALLY worth it.",1356998400,2,230,4.846153846153846
3824118,5,B001W72OL8,"It starts out with a brother and a sister at a cemetary, where the famous phrase ""They're coming to get you Barbara"" is coined. Once the brother is dispatched by a passing zombie, the sister makes her way to a seemingly abandoned house where she meets up with a black man who seems to be quite handy at boarding up doors and windows except for the most obvious ones behind him in key shots.

There's the typical idiot who decides boarding himself up with his family in the cellar is a good idea along with the usual dumb couple that blows themselves up in a truck after the boyfriend seems to forget that gas is flammable and shouldn't be splashed around a nearby lit torch. Of course there's also shots of zombies or rather people walking around aimlessly and sorta fighting to get in to munch on the people in the house.

Now while this is said to be a classic and did launch the zombie film genre it is quite boring, badly acted and not very well paced to be honest. The main actress is simply boring, the black guy is about the only halfway decent actor and everyone else is simply bad to say the least. Thankfully the guys do a fantastic job with the material, for the most part they slam this film quite well and in very funny fashion.

Some of their best riffs are aimed at the Pittsburgh natives and sports teams, also they take time to slam the midwest and the riffs they throw at the cast are gold especially those they have for the main actress who is truly a borefest. For fans of the guys, MST3K and Rifftrax this is a great addition to your DVD collection.",1329436800,,1570,4.315254237288135
3824119,5,B001W72OL8,"The premise is simple--find a movie and make fun of it with a commentary track.  It's harder than it sounds, I'm sure, but Mike Nelson and company do an outstanding job of taking down one of my personal favorite cult films, ""Night of the Living Dead.""

The fun starts early, with jibes not only aimed at the actors onscreen, but 'technical' aspects of a shot (which serves the dual purpose of making fun of commentary tracks in general).  It continues throughout the film, at various levels of inspiration, from silly sex jokes to esoteric references to wry, shrewd observations.  And since the film was shot around Pittsburgh, there are several references to the Pittsburgh Steelers, just to keep us on our toes.

I'm sure my neighbors must think I'm crazy, because I sat on the sofa laughing hysterically for at least half of the 96 minute runtime.  Hilarious.  I mean that.

Also, as a 'bonus,' you can watch the film without the RiffTrax commentary.  For someone as into cult film as I am, this really is a true bonus...I can watch it for the original zombie suspense, or for big, big yuks.

Highly recommended.",1282608000,2,1115,4.701030927835052
3824120,4,B001W72OL8,"If you like MST3K, you will laugh at this video. Mike and the guys are in top form as they demonstrate the lighter side of flesh-eating mutants (and their victims !).",1261699200,,166,4.387096774193548
3824121,5,B001W72OL8,"This is easily my favorite of the four RiffTrax DVDs in my collection.  They've taken a cult horror film which I've never really cared much for and turned it into one of the best riffs since the MST3K version of ""Santa Claus Conquers The Martians"".  Unfortunately, it's not as 'family friendly' as some of the other shows, what with the nakey zombie shambling around outside of the house and the bodies being ripped apart and eaten.",1257724800,,432,4.671052631578948
3824122,5,B001W72OL8,"This one is great, and I strongly recommend it.  The movie in itself is a scream; and the rifs are hilarious icing on a very funny cake.",1255910400,2,136,4.037037037037037
3824123,4,B001W72OL8,"This old black and white movie was cheaply made but became a Cult Hit shock horror film that started the Flesh-Eating Zombie movie craze.  The old MST3K crew of Mike Nelson, Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett take it on with quite a few funny riffs.  Some don't quite hit the spot, and the guys miss some choice moments to riff,  but that's always the case with Rifftrax.  One of the better ones was, ""A Zombie's Worst enemy, a Clothesline.""  The clueless young couple who try to escape the zombies and the ultra-Angry family man get lots of attention.  Rifftrax does not include old MST3K things like skits, sets, or the Bots.  You never See the guys in any form.  You simply HEAR them from the beginning to the end of the movie.  Not even an Intro!

I also recommend Rifftrax ""House on Haunted Hill.""  It's terrific.",1248739200,6,813,4.5
3824124,5,B001W72OL8,"This DVD of RIFFTRAX: NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD was released a mere 9 days before Michael Jackson's untimely death and features a joke about him, a reference to the infamous ""hair-on-fire"" incident of the 1980's.  Grab a copy of this DVD before its withdrawn and becomes a highly prized collector's item...",1246147200,4,305,4.865384615384615
3824125,3,B001W72OL8,"I somehow stumbled across this at my local Best Buy on May 11, 2009. To the best of my knowledge, it wasn't supposed to be released outside of rifftrax.com for another month. Naturally, I grabbed it quickly.

The comedy of Mike, Kevin, and Bill is solid as expected. Some of the jokes are the word-for-word exact same as in the earlier version from Legend Films, featuring only Mike Nelson's comedy track. In this version, however, the delivery of those lines is shared by Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett. Luckily, there is some new material mixed in that offsets the repeats. If you've never seen the previous version, you won't even notice.

I only had two real technical issues with this DVD. Firstly, the menu screen ran once and then stopped instead of looping back to the start. This meant that I had to start the entire DVD all over again. Secondly, the video was choppy in parts. The audio ran without issue, but some parts of the film seemed to be skipping video frames. I am not certain if this was an issue with all copies of this DVD or if it's specific to my player.

All in all, it's enjoyable and funny, a good buy for any fan of Rifftrax, Mystery Science Theater 3000, or Cinematic Titanic.",1242000000,12,1204,4.513761467889908

8347039,5,B001W72OL8,"Well, the Rifftrax gang (formerly of 'Mystery Science Theater 3000') takes on the original classic drive-in zombie film, ""Night Of The Living Dead"". They did a superb job of keeping me laughing... a lot. It must have been tough to come-up with hilarious comments to accompany a movie which at times has only one character mumbling to himself while nailing up boards, and at the same time another character is moping around the house rather catatonic, but the Rifftrax gang did it, and did it extremely well. I bought this dvd, and consider it a very good purchase. I think that any fan of ""Night Of The Living Dead"" would enjoy this Rifftrax dvd very much. I also think anyone who has not seen this 1968 zombie thriller will like this dvd very much. The menu allows for the riffs to be turned-off, and one can view the film in its original non-riffed format. It's like getting two movies in one! Whether watching it alone or with any friends you may still have, this edition from the Rifftrax library is sure to entertain. Great job by the Rifftrax gang! I later bought this dvd for my brother's birthday. And I told him he'd better watch it! (laughing)  ~terry",1471910400,,1161,4.581730769230769
