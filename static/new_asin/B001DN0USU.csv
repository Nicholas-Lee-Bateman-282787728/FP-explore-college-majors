3535170,5,B001DN0USU,"The Title pretty much says it all.  This is without a doubt the best anime I've ever seen, and supplier sent to me without any problems.",1238976000,,136,4.230769230769231
3535171,5,B001DN0USU,"The domed city of Romdo is having a problem with robots gaining free will.  In a city where mankind and machines all have a certain place in utopia free will is not a good thing.  While the story starts out in a dark city, like a mixture of Blade Runner and Noir, the setting unfolds into the rest of the world.  Burnt ruins, plains of dirty snow, silent cities with working robots, the Earth on the edge of the end.
Robots, girls with guns, and a unsolved mystery.  What is a Proxy and what does it mean for mankind?  Great music, good plot, pretty artwork, great characters.  The extra DVD has some extras but not alot.  Ending theme by Parnoid Android and the opening theme is good too.
If you like dark, confusing and cool, this is the anime for you.",1234137600,,754,4.304964539007092
3535172,4,B001DN0USU,"I cannot say enough about the style of the animation itself, as it is the most attractive looking series I have ever watched, seamlessly blending computer generated effects with more traditional techniques.

The story is moderately complicated and many of details of what is going on are saved for the final few episodes.  The series is carried through these long periods by revealing to the viewer just enough information over the course of the series that, with each episode, it does feel as though the answers to the mysteries of the seemingly unassuming protagonist are coming into focus.  I would not say that the plot is confusing, as it is largely straight forward account of Vincent Law's journey across a post-apocalyptic Earth.  The clues to resolving the mysteries of: (i) who Vincent really is (ii) how the world came to be in its current state and (iii) the changes that are coming and Vincent's role in those changes, these simply are revealed at a slow and deliberate pace.

What propels the series through, however, is a combination of the clever writing and the characters of the three leads, Vincent Law, Re-L Mayer and the android child Pino.  Of the three, debates continue as to which is the best of the three.  For me personally, it's the surprising choice of the happy android Pino.  Re-L is a close second though if only because she cuts such a strong and dark figure on the screen, in a way typically reserved for male characters.

As for the writing, there were several moments where the plot devices caused me to want to roll my eyes (like an episode that entirely comprised exposition, told in the form of a strange game show which the characters find themselves involved with, or an episode that consists entirely of them waiting for the wind to propel their small ship).  In the end, though (and perhaps in part because I was so ready to dismiss these devices) I could not help but admire the way the writers twisted what seemed potentially tedious into something delightful.  The writers also are very good at connecting seemingly random moments into the grander story in a meaningful and affecting way.

If you dislike movies like Memento (which require you to rethink events previously viewed in light of subsequently revealed information) or if you cannot engage with character driven stories, this is not the series for you.  It is not action heavy, and what action there is generally is not crucial to the overall story.",1227571200,23,2456,4.805225653206651
3535173,5,B001DN0USU,"Absolutely gorgeous animation, beautiful artistic scenery, fluid action scenes, and well developed plot line. Lovers of the Cyber-punk genre should  watch this. Comparable to Ghost in the shell stand alone complex and Texhnolyze but you know what is going on. Has interesting references to Greek mythology and Blade Runner. Oh and if anyone has studied Carl Jung, his ideals are mentioned.

At parts a psychological thriller, and at parts a delicious mystery. And of course action and really sexy, strong female lead.",1226361600,,517,5.2926829268292686
3535174,3,B001DN0USU,csi meets elfin lied meets the twilight zone the voice dubbing is great the animation is dark but its some pretty good animation that will grab you right away.  the story can get very confusing at times with weird things happining and then getting explaned later in detail. this is the first mystery anime that i have ever watched or even heard of if you have a short attention span and like alot of action this is not for you it really makes you pay attention.  this is an anime that could apeal to a person who is not a fan of anime the more you watch the more you want the mystery to be explaned.  i have watched alot of anime and in my opinion this is good but not great definitly a good addition to a diverse collection,1226361600,4,724,4.1571428571428575
3535175,4,B001DN0USU,"I am not an Anime guru by any means. I do have several degrees in the Fine and Visual Arts, which makes me about as knowledgeable as the next guy, art is such a subjective topic. But, as a professional of the field I must say the artistic palette and visual style of Ergo Proxy is very appealing and consistent (even though the character Re-l has a strong resemblance to Evanescence's Amy Lee). But like all good animation, it doesn't amount to anything if the story is not there. Ergo Proxy, starts weak, there are moments when you can tell tension and mystery are trying to build but as a viewer you recognize the cliche early on and instead of a building emotion you feel rather dry. The story really takes off halfway through disk two (I don't want to spoil anything). From there it becomes a rather fun, dark, if not bleak outlook on the future. Ergo Proxy is good at playing with recognizable themes, and making them its own. Overall, the adventure is worth the price of admission and recommended for any sci-fi fan.",1226361600,,1022,4.5
3535176,5,B001DN0USU,"Great show.  Interesting, dark visuals.  Most of the time has realistic characters, sometimes goes into superhero action mode common to much anime.  Interesting characters in Vincent, Re-L, Pino, Daedalus, and the Security Chief.  There are some weak episodes that are probably best to skip, namely episodes 11, 14, 15, 16, and 20.  And for a slightly more upbeat ending, I would suggest watching episode 19 last.

The story is really about man's ability to destroy and also about his ability to create, and that humans must choose their own fates and not rely on thier rulers, such as Ergo, to save them from the bad things in life.

*** Semi-Spoilers ahead: The basic gist of the story is that after a terrible world holocaust, the leaders of mankind create these superhuman beings called proxies to run the few remaining human domed cities (also referred to as arks) in different parts of the world, in order to prevent man's extinction and resurrect humanity from the ashes of the world war.  In the meantime, a machine virus is causing many of the humanoid machines to ""develop souls"" (ie: become self-aware) and leads to various interesting character developments.  As for the proxies, the foremost of the superhuman beings is Ergo, and like his fellow proxies, his dual nature has tremendous power both to create and to destroy.  Over the many years, they created many amazing cities and mechanical servants of the remaining humans in these cities to shape humanity for the future.  But the catch is, that the ancient humans who created the proxies, were also afraid that they might become too powerful, and so built into them programs that would prevent them from teaming up, as well as self-detructive or violent  tendancies that which would make them feared by mankind.  Even though the original creators of the proxies are long dead, the rules progammed into them live on.  Unless, Ergo can break free and choose his own fate.  All in all, a very different and interesting glimpse into the future.

p.s. We send our love to Pino, she is truly a wonderful and sweet human being",1226361600,,2087,4.853107344632768
3535177,5,B001DN0USU,"The only other review for this product was from someone who got it as a gift but didn't really want it and I don't think the review was very impartial to the original onset of distaste for the gift. I have seen this Anime and I would personally rate this show as a 4 star but I'm giving it a 5 to balance out the 2 stars that were already given to this show. This show isn't my cup of tea but the animation was done with absolute beauty despite the very apocalyptic view on life.

3535178,4,B001DN0USU,"This was picked up by me on a whim. I liked the cover and the many 5  star reviews helped. I have ordered shows that intrigue me just from the cover and or blurb on the back. Sometimes I get burned and end up with something I wish I did not order or like this one I end up binge watching the show for two days.
I will not go into the story except to say it more than held my interest. Great characters and good story go a long way in keeping it interesting. Good design through out and solid animation will also keep you watching.
For a person who  went into this set not knowing what to expect. This intelligent Sci Fi anime kept me entertained. Will be seeing it again soon.",1489449600,,676,4.037313432835821

3535180,5,B001DN0USU,"This anime. Where to begin? I don't know because i don't want to give anything away! I CAN tell you, however, that you MUST pay attention!",1487462400,,138,4.346153846153846
3535181,5,B001DN0USU,"Holy smokes, where do I begin? This anime is a must watch for fans of philosophical anime series. Without giving too much away, it does start off slightly on the slow side, but it picks up immediately within the first couple episodes, and while there are a few episodes that are slower, it flows fairly well.

I watched the English Dub version, and it was very good. I didn't mind it at all, and it seemed that the English voice actors were chosen with care. Purists will want to watch with subs, though.

Be aware there are a few episodes throughout the series that are kind of oddball episodes, and don't seem to fit - but also be aware this anime is the product of the mid 2000's, and reflects that time period very well in some respects.

If you read my other reviews, you'll see I give a lot of 5 star reviews. Some people say that's a bad thing, but if I really care about a product, I want the people who made/sell it to know. This series is easily worth the whole 5 stars.

One last note: There is some language in the series, but no nudity. Violence is there too, but nothing too extreme.",1487203200,,1097,4.259615384615385
3535182,4,B001DN0USU,"Let first start by saying this anime is not for everybody. That's to say it isn't a bad anime at all I mean I'm giving it 4 stars after all! I'd say it's more of a mystery genre then anything else. It's slower paced then the typical anime but I think it further enhanced the quality of the show itself. You are always left wondering what's going to happen next, who's that guy, what's she been up to, what exactly is he, ect. I recommend Ergo Proxy for anyone who is looking for something deeper or just looking for something different.

3535188,3,B001DN0USU,"Review for the show itself, not the product... Product is great no complaints.

This anime starts out strong, seems promising, but meanders aimlessly in the middle section for quite some time before the final few episodes deliver a flat and half-baked finale. The only character who's fate I ever developed an emotional investment in was Pino, every other character was, to me, two dimensional without any satisfying development. This includes protagonist Re-L Mayer who has obviously been written to be deliberately unlikable. I first felt that this was the case so that we could watch her character develop and grow, but this never really happens to any satisfying extent. I strongly feel that instead of a full 23 episode series, the writers could have cut this one down to a single hour and 20 minute feature without compromising the vision of the narrative, if you could say that this story even has a vision at all.

It is indeed a strange and sometimes maddeningly opaque trip across a apocalyptic future earth- one of my personal favorite genres. Yet, this series seems confused by its own questions, offering a story that tries doggedly to be cerebral and philosophical while never actually delivering satisfying answers proportionate to the investment required of the viewer. Be warned; if you appreciate and prioritize good character driven narratives and seek fulfilling story arcs in your anime, then there are very few redeeming qualities to be found in this series. I will say that the animation and character design is striking, and the music and sound are great. Praise be for the creation of an interesting, darkly beautiful and evocative visual palate, however damnable the characters and plot points themselves may be.

Bottom Line: Beautiful animation, a visual treat. Moody and atmospheric, but one that lacks emotional depth- a failed attempt at profundity succeeding only in being disjointed and incoherent. Don't go into this one expecting too much from the characters or story.",1471392000,4,2003,5.138036809815951

3535216,3,B001DN0USU,"Yeah, it had something in those first few episodes, but...

After a while, I was just forcing my way through episodes just to be done with it.

Gist: it's a mixed bag.

beginning:

+ promising; setting, characters, and plot.
+ lots of terminology. (Which is a good sign, shows there was some thought put into the story)
+ weird stuff (ehh, i'm sure they are going somewhere with it)

middle:

- take away almost everything that made it interesting.
- repetitive
-/+ story becomes episodic (There was one good story i liked where their ship broke down, felt it gave the characters a little depth. Nothing but dialogue really happens though.)
- events happen with little rhyme or reason, with a 3 minute explanation at the end. before the explanation though you are in WTF city.
- weird stuff. (Yeah they were going somewhere with it, to more weird stuff)

end:

- predictable honestly. (There were one or two things, but it was so last minute that in retrospective it felt like it didn't even happen)
- boring. (the random s*** took precedence for so long, it was hard to stay on topic for as long as it did.)
- characters are unlikable. (except security chief) They where unlikable since the middle, but so much random s*** was happening i didn't notice.
-stopped caring. (The characters did too. Felt like someone hit off on the emotion switch, and they were just going through emotions. Perhaps for the entire story now that i think of it.)
- weird stuff. (The only thing weird at the end is how calm the start was)",1416096000,2,1517,4.571955719557195

3535222,4,B001DN0USU,"I'm not going to waste time by writing a review of the show. Lets just say that this is one of my all time favorite anime shows, and I have watched MANY.
There are also some really through and well written reviews already posted.

I wanted to just discuss the actual packaging.

I received this in the mail in great condition. The actual size of the product can be compared to any regular DVD movie case out today. This is a ""box"" set, but since there are only 23 episodes, the set consists of only 4 discs (so its thin).

The DVD plastic case is covered by a cardboardish slip cover that slides off. This slipcase is very flimsy, and I found myself knocking the edges easily.

The plastic case itself is sturdy to a degree, and the DVDs can be flipped through view plastic DVD holding ""pages.""

When it comes to additional content, there isn't much. There are 3-4 interesting promo trailers of the show from back in 2006 (you see some old character designs of Ergo that didn't make it into the pilot). There is also a 30 minute interview with these 2 guys who had a hand in the US dubbing and such. It's just them giving opinions, and some small snippets of information the received from the shows creators. Kind of interesting.

Besides that, there are cc and you can choose between English and Japanese vocals (both of which are excellent).

The characters have so much depth and even the main characters who you are supposed to root for are flawed which makes them interesting. I think the world needs more science fiction like Ergo Proxy -- less focus on gratuitous explosions and alien battles, and more focus on thought-provoking scenarios that question the repercussions of our advancing technology.

I will say that this series was also pretty confusing at times. They tend to do this thing where something happens that you just don't understand, and you are not sure if you are supposed to know what is going on or not (usually it turns out you are not SUPPOSED to know at the time, but it is explained later on). So I will say, don't let the confusion turn you off. Everything is explained and wrapped up neatly.

Overall, I did not want this series to end! It's really an amazing series, I would highly recommend it.",1399420800,,1081,4.654450261780105

also, ps, if nothing make u watch it, watch it for Pino, search ""ergo proxy pino"" and see what she look like, if the show reputation, art, music, character, mindtesting nature is not enough for you, seeing her might be the last push for u to watch it.  i know she did for me, cause i just couldn't let her down and need to see what happen to her at the end. this show did it right, cause if they even gone slightest wrong step with this specific character, i woulda rage and give this a 1 star straight up

This is not the ""funny, harem, fan service anime"" at all. Rather it is a dark, mysterious, well written world that sucks you into the lore and never stops with the sudden curve-balls for all characters involved.
The VA is incredible and well cast, the animation itself is dark, gritty and gorgeous and the story is well played out across the stage its given

All in all if I could 6 star this I would in a heartbeat",1381968000,,671,4.114503816793893
3535240,4,B001DN0USU,"There's so much to appreciate in this anime. With a dark mood, masterful shot blocking, and smooth pacing, it truly captures the sterile, supremely controlled world the characters start out in. The latter half of the series falters, suffering some lost narrative and eventually concluding with an ending that lacks the intelligence and intrigue of the first half. Nonetheless, it's still a wonderfully grim journey through a world that I'm sure the creators are proud of.

***PROS***

ANIMATION
Reminiscent of Ghost in the Shell: SAC, but darker and without the washed-over look. The first few episodes are stunning. The visuals fall off in the middle (lazy shot blocking and three-frame movements/stills), but I believe it was the animation team's choice to do so, wanting to save their tenacious skills for the big parts. Their minor detour will not deter you from the path.

SETTING
The world created in the show goes from a sterile, emotionless society preserved in a dome, to the deserts of the free-willed disenfranchised and the grief-scape beyond. If you like a dark mood and a world that is handed to you in pieces, then enjoy the ride.

CHARACTERS
They are a mystery--all of them, each with motivations both pure and twisted. They do not unravel to the promise they're capable of, but still hold genuine revelations that are rewarding and wholesomely desolate to behold.

MUSIC
Some of the best I've heard in anime: ghostly, uplifting with consequence, and melodically tense. I rarely listen to the opening and end credits for every episode in a series, but in this show's case, I did so with purpose.

***CONS***

LOST NARRATIVE
As this journey started to examine time lost and aimless goals, I applauded the direction and the bored disorientation I began to feel. When they stayed lost for five episodes, I started to worry. The finale came, and the resolution seemed weaker than the promise of the premise. Let's just say the questions were better than the answers.

All in all, I recommend this series to anyone who's ready to break from the norm and take a trip. Whether or not you like what is at the end for the characters is irrelevant; somewhere along the line, this show has a way of making you ask questions about yourself, and that insight is worth the time. Almost five stars. Almost.

I'm an animator and writer, so I frequently pour through stacks of anime. If this was helpful or our tastes seem to align, follow along. I'll try to steer you straight.",1380153600,19,2477,4.836879432624113
3535241,5,B001DN0USU,"I love the series both seasons only complaint is it does get campy in few parts but it gives a psychology lesson during those parts in a odd way. Great animation, decent voice actors, and subtitles very close to the English dub for the most part. If your into a little more dark and mysterious then give it a go.",1378944000,,312,4.216666666666667
3535242,4,B001DN0USU,"This is an anime that requires a unique taste, if you are a fan of cyberpunk anime or you love Ghost in the Shell I recommend this. This is not a fast paced anime it is very character driven. Basically it's all about the characters and their relationships. Now for action this does not have a lot and it mostly comes in more at the middle of the story and the end; however when there is action it is very good. Also the art is what I found to be the best part of this anime.
  The reason I did not give this five stars is because of how slow and somewhat complicated. Their are parts where you really have to pay attention to understand. There are parts where it really made me frustrated that they could not figure out what the twist was, and then other parts where so good that I had to stay up just to see the next episode.
  So if you like Ghost in the Shell give this a try you might really like it.",1378598400,2,904,4.0055555555555555
3535243,3,B001DN0USU,"I read a lot of good reviews about this title but frankly, other than the quality of the animation, I can hardly find anything to say good about this series.  Even that isn't so attractive due to the color palette.

I understand, it's about the atmosphere but it is all depressing, all the time.  Pino was the only character I cared for, because she was fun and lively.  Sure, there were some interesting turn of events but I was so bored, I just wanted to see how it ended.  Fortunately, the last two episodes were quite interesting.  Maybe because more stuff is revealed in these two episodes than the whole series itself.

I'm not a fool when it comes to hidden messages, but a lot of it just bores me.  Add melancholic main characters to mix and it is not a fun experience for me.  I want to enjoy what I see, not to think about it for hours.  I liked, Trigun, Dual, Full Metal Alchemist, Elven Lied.

3535246,4,B001DN0USU,"Ergo Proxy is an anime that does a number of things right. First of all, it is an adult anime that treats it's viewer as an adult. There are no boob jokes or typical anime fair, it's a lot of philosophical and biblical things that make up a good portion of the show. The show does a good job of being intelligent, though sometimes this comes off as totally insane. The ending is a typical anime ending that leaves you scratching your head, but the ending comes to abruptly and comes right out of left field that it leaves you scratching your head even longer than usual. Think Big O quality of what the hell at the end.

I like to say that the story is told in three acts because the acts are all completely different. The first act is the one that many people will think to associate with the whole series, a cyberpunk-y kind of crime show. Then the second act rolls around and we get a lot of exploration and get to know the world even better. The third act is when the show---well, it doesn't degrade, I like anime that does crazy things at the end and I was sort of expecting it---but it just doesn't fit in with the rest of the series. I don't know how to react to the ending because it was just too different from the rest of the show. It just wasn't set up enough that we would be tromping through biblical/religious/philosophical ground for a whole three nonsensical episodes. The episodes before that are all internal conflicts and a lot of it makes no sense as well, but you think the end will be a very psychologically stressing one for the characters, but it turns out to be just psychological stress on the person watching and wondering what the hell is going on.

Ergo Proxy has good animation, it's landscapes look amazing. The characters are another story though. They look decent from up close but far away they look pretty crappy. Overall though the animation is pretty good. Characters do look a lot more gritty and realistic than other animes, but that's not enough to save the fact it just looks choppy at some points.

The Japanese voice actors do a good job and the music, well, there's barely enough to really complain about. It doesn't exactly need music though because there is enough dialogue to suffice. The opening theme is alright, though I've heard better before. The end theme just plain sucks. Otherwise, everything sounds good and the sound would have been a 10 if not for the end theme.

I had a hard time deciding the score on characters. I liked them all for whatever reason, but most were shallow. Lil Mayar who should have been the outstanding character of the series is just kind of bitchy and dull, Vincent isn't all that compelling, and Pino can come off as a decent character at points but at other points just doesn't come off as any good either. Raul, who actually was shaping up to be an awesome character, just turns out to be bland and Daedalus is probably the worst character of the series, I still have no idea what the hell he had to do with much of anything.

This anime is not something that you can go into as a fan of cyberpunk, because it's not cyberpunk. It's a weird mix of cyberpunk, steampunk, apocalyptic, and religious that works to a degree, but ends on a weaker note because of it's attempt at blowing our minds toward the end with it's religious turn. While it's last episode is enjoyable for those who do like to mull over the meaning and everything, it may be way to much for the average fan of anime. Hell, the whole series may be a bit too much. It caters to a certain sci-fi niche essentially and for whatever reason, I wish the world that was created (an exceptional world) could have been utilized much better than with this overly-complicated and scatterbrained plot that's only job seems to be to hurt the brain.

Not that I didn't enjoy it. It was a good anime, an anime for adults and thinking types. While some of it's philosophy came off as corny a lot of it was pretty good and there are a lot of things you can decipher from this anime if you really want to think into it. And that's probably part of the reason I don't understand bits of the plot, I don't feel like thinking.

Can I suggest this to everyone? Definitely not. But Ergo Proxy comes off with an 8 for me. Not one of my favorites, but can be an enjoyable ride for those with the right mindset to take it.",1372204800,11,4347,4.392546583850931
3535247,5,B001DN0USU,"Ergo Proxy is a 23 episode post-apocalyptic, cyberpunk-ish anime.  I really enjoyed it, the dark, bleak world it sets up and the mysteries surrounding it kept you guessing until the end.  It's intricate story and the themes from philosophy and psychology that are interwoven throughout keep you thinking about it long after it's finished.  I should also make note of the show's interesting cast of characters, great animation, and high quality english dub.  If you like anime with mystery, a cyberpunk/dark science fiction setting and aesthetic, and profound themes, Ergo Proxy is definitely something you should pick up.

3535254,1,B001DN0USU,"It has been a few years since I watched Ergo Proxy, and, given my lack of memory regarding specific plot details, I can't go into too much depth. What I can provide, however, are my overall impressions. In light of the uniformly positive reviews that Ergo Proxy has received, I feel obliged to write a minority opinion, and explain just how terrible I found this anime to be.

The first episode takes place in an interesting dystopian city, and features a pair of really engaging fight scenes that whetted my appetite. Unfortunately, all this proves to be little more than a tease. After that introduction, the two protagonists spend the vast majority of their time outside of the city, wandering across the devastated and nearly uninhabited wasteland of post-apocalyptic Earth, encountering very few other characters. The episodes drag on with virtually no action or story, and the animation is sparse, with little movement (a shame, given how gorgeous the art style is). I was shocked by how pronounced the disconnect was between the first episode and the rest of the series. I kept expecting the ponderous middle section to pick up at some point, but it never did, and the main details of the plot remained extremely vague right up to the outrageously unrevealing final episode. Watching Ergo Proxy was an incredibly dull experience with no real payoff.

Although Ergo Proxy appears to have philosophical underpinnings, in my own viewing I thought that this aspect of the show was fairly vapid. The show wrings its hands a lot about ""raison d'etre"" (French for ""reason for being""), features a protagonist whose name is pronounced ""real,"" and includes a triplet of guardian robots named Derrida, Lacan, and Husserl (after three famous philosophers). I am by no stretch an expert, but back when I watched this, I was finishing up my minor in Philosophy as part of my Bachelor's degree, and I distinctly remember feeling that Ergo Proxy did little to truly engage the concepts it referred to. Instead, it seemed to just throw them out by name without providing much actual food for thought.

Maybe I'm crazy. Maybe I'm too slow-witted to pick up on the storytelling and thematic nuances of Ergo Proxy. I did a few Google searches, and I literally could not find a single negative review of this series. As of this moment, it has a displayed average of 5/5 stars on amazon, matching critically acclaimed blockbuster animes like Cowboy Bebop and Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. I can't explain the discrepancy between my opinion and this overwhelming consensus. All I can say is that Ergo Proxy bored me to tears, to the point that I had to force myself to watch it all the way through, only to end up wishing that I hadn't bothered. I found it pretentious, badly paced, and devoid of personality. Perhaps you will not have any such issues, and will enjoy the show a great deal; but on the other hand, perhaps you will find yourself in my shoes, wondering just what all the fuss is about.",1368057600,10,2988,4.83203125

3535258,5,B001DN0USU,"I will more than likely buy this on DVD if it doesn't come out on Blu-ray soon for a reasonable price, for now I own the iTunes digital version. I'll have to be honest, it took me over 2 years to finally actually get through watching this because I'd start, stop... forget, restart... watch it while going to bed etc. Well, the style is amazing... the atmosphere and feel of the world is dark, moody, cyberpunk post apocalyptic in nature but engaging. The thing that makes this sleep inducing is the overall elements of dark graphics and monotonous voice acting for the english version. Vincent's voice is listless, Iggy's voice in monotone, and Re-L is almost completely antagnonistic throughtout the entire series up until the last few episodes... if a Blu-ray version comes out then I'll probably try the original Japanese language which will hopefully not be as trance inducingly boring. The one character that lends lightness and fun is Pino.

I'm thinking that poor Japan with the horendous Fukushima disaster still continuing, it must make it hard for them to watch this anime now since the theme is hitting close to reality for us all actually. When I buy this DVD version I'll be able to experience the Japanese language so maybe that will cast a totally different light on this dark morbid anime.",1363392000,,1306,4.804444444444444

3535262,5,B001DN0USU,"According to amazon.com's review, this series got attention because of Radiohead's single, ""Paranoid Android,"" was the closing theme song. I'd hate to tell the reviewer this, but I don't have a taste for Radiohead. What first caught my attention was when I saw the cover for the first volume and noted the dark, muted shading, the unique name of the anime, and the intriguing-sounding premise. Watched the first episode, and I got hooked! Real bad!
Some may get very confused at first abotu what's going on (as evidenced by this show's sole 1-star review), but I was starting to catch on- maybe not with what the entire mystery, but I was catching on to the series itself.
What really makes the show admirable for me is that it doesn't present an Earth we're all used to, or it would've been far too convenient and, likely, too laxed.
Aside from the dark, moody, muted, yet elegant color direction, it has multiple thought-provoking themes, all that creat multiple threads of a storyline that, along with many seemingly innocuous statements throughout the first 22 episodes, creates a jaw-dropping setting and story for the last episode that did drop my jaw.
Some people may not get much or no sense out of maybe three episodes since they don't follow the normal structure of the other eipsodes, yet I felt as though they ee elaborately created foreshadows that took twenty minutes to explain along with, in one episode in particular (Eternal Smile [The Girl With a Smile]), shows a unique depth of emotion with something most would take for granted.
Though short-lived, it proved its merit for me and may get me to do the personally impossible- watch an anime series all over again, even if just for the exceptionally beautiful animation direction. And maybe for the philosophies of human life presented throughout, and the total anarchy shown in the last couple of episodes.",1358985600,,1876,4.884012539184953

3535268,5,B001DN0USU,"This is a pretty cool show. I think the start is a bit slow but that's only a couple of episodes. Once you hit about the 5th episode things get interesting and it's sweet to watch til the end. There's a lot of interesting things about this series. I wouldn't say it's really deep but it's a good storyline.

I would say the theme of this show is awesome especially the song. I first watched this series while I lived in Italy and every time I hear it, it reminds me of the cool summer nights watching this. The graphics are really good too and they do a good job on expressing the environment.

I'm not the best reviewer, but what made me like this show is that it's similar to Ghost In The Shell. If you like Ghost in the Shell the movie or the series, then I recommend this series.",1355270400,11,783,4.144736842105263

3535271,4,B001DN0USU,"People watched it because it was a brilliant sci fi thriller post apocalyptic noir monster mash up  not because those posers in radiohead allowed their dull song to sully the ending........possibly only decent english band doing an anime song was a lil track from serial experiments lain...radiohead are  overly pretentious and underperforming, they took over the reins of edgy blandness from the cure.  Otherwise the art direction, moods and philosphy of ergo proxy are top notch.",1346544000,,481,5.302631578947368
3535272,5,B001DN0USU,"The main flaw is that Geneon was soon to go under, and they outsourced a lot of animation to cheaper (low budget) Korean firms. It really shows. Episode one is really the only episode where the series shines in the animation department. As it progresses, things go from bad to worse. Long shots show characters that look deformed, and often the lines are in inexplicable places. The episode in the dome with no living beings is a good example.

But Funimation has acquired a lot of Geneon's old licenses and they are re-releasing a ton of series right now. The price is right for this one however. 23 episodes for $24. Solid deal.

Dai Sato lends his masterful touch to the writing (he previously worked on Wolf's Rain and would go on to work as chief scriptwriter for Eureka Seven). The story is one of the best I have ever witnessed in anime. It is rife with references to old Greek lore. What starts off looking like a futuristic, crime fighting series similar to Blade Runner ends up as a philosophical story. What does it mean to exist? And throughout the series the question is constantly rasised ""What is my raison d'tre?"". Even the Aristocracy (more geared towards a Timocracy - ruled with honor by chosen few) ask citizens to find their raison d'tre.

There is one odd episode, Nightmare Quiz Show, but when it ends you kind of see what was going on and you actually find out a bit of back story (the spaceship and all).

The conflict is between humans / autoreivs (semi-sentient androids) / and the Proxys (sic). I enjoy that the autoreivs have a 'Turing application' (Alan Turing is the father of artificial intelligence). Each of these beings has a reason for existing, and unfortunately their inability to coexist begins to bring about chaos.

Rie-L Mayer is the protagonist, she looks like the chick from Evanescence. Her father is a puppet mayor of Romdeau under the 'philosophers'. She works for the investigations department and ends up involved in a strange case involving immigrant Vincent Law. The one thing I wasn't clear on is where these 'immigrants' came from. It seems they came from Moscque, but we're never really privy to that information. But events transpire exposing Rie-L to the Proxys and forcing her out of the city into the poisonous air of the outside. Her story really begins there. Her and Vincent are accompanied by Pino, a child autoreiv that was discarded after the mother was finally able to 'acquire' a human child. At times Pino seems more human than anyone else in the series. She is clearly my favorite character! She is based on Pinocchio. You know, the doll who wants to be real.

The story is so well written and complex that you will probably need to watch through the series multiple times. So purchasing the series is highly recommended. The animation gets worse, but the story gets weirder and better as the series progresses. The Geneon US voice over was actually pretty good, but I'm almost positive Funimation will re-dub. The Japanese cast is also very good, though this was one series that was hard to make the call on. I watch 95% of anime in Japanese with English subtitles, but this was one that was as good either way. Hopefully Funi will do it right.

Also, the music is amazing. I actually own the soundtracks (back when Geneon was putting them with the special editions). It's a dark, instrumental sound, almost with a techno edge. The intro song is really catchy, it's by Monoral which is a Japanese band despite the song being in English. The ending credits are Radiohead Paranoid Android. Which is one of Radiohead's best songs. It works great as a closing song.

In my humble Otaku opinion, you should buy this. Every sci-fi anime fan should at least watch it. It's not big action and battles, not mecha, and not cutesy girls with magic powers. It's a solid story with a lot of philosophy.

I imagine that if Nietzsche, Philip K Dick, and Ray Bradbury were to create a futuristic anime series, this would be it.",1345593600,41,3980,4.682403433476395
3535273,5,B001DN0USU,"In a future where the world has been ravaged by a nuclear apocalyse, there exists salvation in a domed city named ""Romdeau"", where humans and their android servants, the autoreivs, live in. Under the implementation of complete management control, it is a paradise where feelings are literally discarded, and the governing council dictates the way of life the citizens should live. But this utopian landscape is soon broken by a series of mystifying murders. Real Mayar, a female inspector from the Citizen Information Bureau, along with her autoreiv partner Iggy, are tasked to solve the murder cases. She is soon attacked by a creature drawn to her which is neither human nor android, and learns about the mysterious phenomena called ""Awakening"", an event which draws her further into the case...and to the world beyond the limits of Romdeau.

3535274,1,B001DN0USU,"I couldn't finish this anime. It was extremely boring. I watched up to episode 5 then I stopped. Weeks later, I tried to finish it. I went to episode 17 before I had to stop. I was falling asleep way too many times watching this dull anime. Sometimes I would watch an episode for 5 minutes, fall asleep, and wake up and have to watch it over again until I didn't sleep through it.

I didn't care about any of the characters. *spoilers*

Sometimes characters are thrown in at random. Kazkis and Senex Proxy were thrown in and killed off real quick to make us understand them. The same with the unnamed proxy in the wilderness with the autoreiv that Re-L killed. For the life of me, I couldn't like Vincent at all. I wanted him to have some backbone, drove, inner purpose, motivation, etc. But he was empty. I didn't understand why he desperately liked Re-L so much, who was nothing more than some spoiled Goth chick.

I just cannot get over how the characters were lifeless. They were thrown in abruptly and killed abruptly. I wanted to see more backstory to the people at the commune, like Quinn and Hoody. I wanted to know the story behind the Autoreiv and that Proxy in the wilderness. Raul didn't seem bothered by the horrofic death of his loved ones right in front of his eyes. Why not? He felt like another anime cliche of the evil character who acts as if everything is going according to plan and closes his eyes whenever he speaks something dramatic.

Whenever people say Ergo Proxy is boring, you get the response, ""If you're looking for action and explosions, this isn't the anime for you. This is an intellectual and psychological anime."" I am bored with that response. It comes up whenever fans of so-called intellectual films, shows, books, etc. want to deflect the detractors. Sometimes a dull show is a dull show. And people use the ""it makes you think"" lie to cover that up.

Good characters make a good show. But the characterization in Ergo Proxy was sorely lacking. I never understood any of the characters' motivations and got deep enough to like them. Therefore, this story is a waste.",1333065600,2,2106,4.575596816976128

3535276,5,B001DN0USU,"Truly different, truly great. If you like in depth complex sci-fi this is a must see. This is why anime is like nothing else.",1268784000,,125,4.25
3535277,5,B001DN0USU,"I'm going to try and keep this review from revealing too much.  Chances are, you'll look at a few more, or you've probably already read the Amazon critique, and for that I must apologize.  One of Ergo Proxy's main themes is the search for truth, and though I don't think spoilers will really ruin the viewing experience, I still see revealing major plot/setting points as a disservice to the series.

If you're looking for stylized anime where the characters shout out the names of their combat tactics and seemingly float in mid-air while rock music blares on in the background, look somewhere else.  Ergo Proxy tries its hand at taking genres and twisting them around, but its mostly to infuse a sense of mythology that's in all of Earth's history.  It's philosophical, self-searching, and subjective, in much the same way that David Lynch's films are, though Ergo Proxy does so with something much closer to a linear plot.  It starts out as a science fiction thriller with a little bit of a noir feel to it, then tacks on the kind of inner monologues, supernatural monsters, fight scenes, and emotionally charged conflicts you expect to find in an anime.  The difference is, I never felt that the show was being too cheesy.  There are times that the characters can feel a bit melodramatic, nearly campy, but that's something that I've gotten used to seeing in anime (and it's handled a lot better here than in most places!).

The show's dark, often labyrinthine progression feels a lot like Paranoia Agent, where each episode seems repetitious, only Ergo Proxy is much more contained and comprehensible.  It's full of satirical themes, philosophical wanderings, and it doesn't spend too much time babying you through the story.  I read a review somewhere that called Ergo Proxy a puzzle, and I can see why someone would say that, though I'd argue that it's really a complicated, in-depth story that grows more and more surreal as it pedals toward a mythological conclusion.  If you're a fan of Satoshi Kon's work, you'll be impressed with this layered piece of science fiction.",1266883200,2,2080,4.861189801699717
3535278,5,B001DN0USU,"This is some of the best anime, and Sci-Fi in general, that I've had the pleasure of watching. The story and characters are very engrossing, and it gave me chills like only a few of the best Sci-Fi movies and books were able to do. If you like science fiction but haven't found any interest in anime, please check this out, it will change your mind! The animation is wonderful, and the futuristic cyberpunk setting is believable and unique. The dubbing is excellent, and I enjoyed watching it in English.",1257638400,2,504,4.611111111111111
3535279,5,B001DN0USU,"If you're the kind of person that needs a story to tell literal, straight-forward journey from A to B, (like the person who wrote the Amazon.com review) then this isn't for you. But if you appreciate abstract ideas and subjective story-lines open for interpretation, especially thought-provoking stories that pose existential questions, then you'll appreciate Ergo Proxy.

According to Amazon's reviewer, ""Ergo Proxy will appeal to viewers who favor violent action over coherent storytelling and credible characters."" I don't recall a terrible amount of violent action. The series is arguably slow, actually. Whoever wrote the amazon.com review missed the point, many times over. The 3 episodes that the Amazon.com review sited as ""pointless fantasies"" are actually the battles with different proxies in their respective cities: beating the game show was defeating a proxy, discerning fantasy from reality in ""Ophelia"" was defeating a proxy, etc.

As far as copying from Evagelion, I see no similarities. And the only thing that can be accused of copying from Ghost in The Shell is the robots becoming self-aware due to the Cogito Virus. But that idea is in no way original to Ghost in the Shell. How many sci-fi stories deal with the idea of robots becoming self-aware? Besides, ""Cogito"" is part of the Latin phrase ""Cogito ergo sum"" or ""I think, therefore I am.""  I think, think, that Descartes was an antecedent to Ghost in the shell, but don't quote me.

Everyone is entitled to an opinion, and some people enjoy the literal, while others appreciate the subjective. And that's fine, of course; this series isn't going to please everyone. But the points made against Ergo Proxy in the Amazon.com review are unfair and incorrect.

By the way, the art is rather nice, too. Cyberpunktastic.",1250985600,67,1790,5.13745704467354
3535280,5,B001DN0USU,I was introduced to this series by a friend and I absolutely love it. It really makes you think. It's not just the same thing every episode.,1249776000,,140,4.222222222222222
3535281,4,B001DN0USU,"Ergo Proxy is a sophistocated anime. Not one that is full of action or that has a clear story. You really have to think about the characters, their relationships, and the world they live in when you watch this movie. Ergo Proxy reminded me a lot of ""Speedgrapher""(another amazing adult Anime). It's about a high society that falls at the hands of the same person that helped nurtured it. When the curtain falls your left questioning about what is the key factor to life. Just like in Speedgrapher the key was living by your own destiny, and not riding on the rails that had been laid out before you.

 Ergo Proxy tells the tale of one man who tries to find himself, a girl who thinks she knows herself but doesn't, and highly positive character that motivates them all. The combination of personalities is interesting. The Main character Re-L is a woman whom you could call ""cold"" and not be off by a single letter. Vincent the co-main character is a passive-aggressive person who bends to fit the situation(mostly he is collective and passive, but mainly because he doesn't know who he is). Pino the sub-character is the odd ball of the bunch. Both Re-L and Vincent alone are dark characters. Pino is full of light and really brings out the best in both of them because of her innocence.

 All of Ergo Proxys strange characters live in post-apocalyptic world. They belong to a highly governed society that has learned to survive by living under strict societal rules. Only the highest level of society knows the truth about it, while the lower society live their lives blindly not knowing the truth. Re-L, Vincent, and Pino all journey out to find this truth. The trek that they go on exposes many lies for them, and opens their eyes to a world that they never thought was possible. There are plenty of plot twist, and mind bogglers in this anime, but you have to put the story together yourself. The anime doesn't just fall into place. Each episode reveals clues and hints. Once you get towards the last disk you start to put things together.

 Ergo Proxy is a great anime to watch, I recommend it if your into ""thinker"" sort of animes. I only give this anime 4 stars because I thought it should have been longer so we could see the characters develop more. 2 episode I felt could have been done better as they were not necessary at all. I thought the story was unique, but sometimes overly confusing. There were many times when I didn't know what was going on, untill I pieced the episodes together. If you like Speedgrapher you will enjoy this. If you haven't seen Speedgrapher...well check that out too it's amazing.",1248825600,4,2621,4.601713062098501

Some of the episodes leading to the ending where a little confusing and unexpected but overall where a good part of the story where you get to see how the individual characters think and are  different from each other and really brings the characters to life. Bottom line is this is a great show and i would recommended to any one who likes anime.",1246406400,,666,4.045454545454546

3535285,5,B001DN0USU,"This series is odd, symbolic and highly artistic.  I'm drawn to Ergo Proxy because it is out of the norm for anime.  It's in it's own genre.  I recommend for people that are high on openness and like dark art.  An interesting plot, anarchist undertones and hypnotic dialog will keep the creative mind engulfed.  If you fall asleep during this series you're bound to have some interesting dreams.",1240876800,,395,4.75
3535286,5,B001DN0USU,"If I would have had all the DVDs I would have watched it in one sitting. I found both the narrative and the characters to be fascinating. It presents a very complex and conflicted view of humanity, fate (reason for existence), and spirituality.  It intentionally leaves some aspects of the world ambiguous because that's the point. It's meant to make you think, not only about what the writers presented, but about your own existence and your beliefs.

I enjoyed the episodes that seemed out of character with the rest of the series. These are a distinguishing characteristic of chief writer Dai Sato (Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, Wolf's Rain, Eureka 7). They add something of their own and they also add to the overall development of the characters and the world. They take the characters out of the world they're in an put them into a different one so you can see how they act. I find it to be an interesting and creative character development device.

If you like series that explore the nature of society and humanity, then I guarantee you'll like Ergo Proxy. I enjoyed it a great deal the first time and I liked it even more the second time. They lay subtle hints all over the place which you're a bit confused by the first time, but again, that's the point. You're not supposed to feel comfortable in this world. You're supposed to feel as compelled to unravel it as the characters and in the end, it ends up looking a lot like our own.",1240272000,6,1445,4.571428571428571

This show is intellectual with intriguing characters, a great plot, and some of the best ""neo-noir"" animation ever put on screen.  Very dystopian / cyber punk, and dark, like blade-runner, but with less techno-gadgets than Ghost in the Shell.  Furthermore, it has the BEST opening credits song in all of anime, and I should know, because I've watched 100's of different shows.  ""Kiri"" by Monoral is the song, and the band Monoral also sells their music on Amazon too.  You should check the out.  They sound like a Japanese-rock version of U2, only with more soul.  Also, lyrics are in English, so its a great sound.  If you like Ghost in the Shell, (and I'm talking the anime, not that monstrosity live-action film they tried to pass on to anime fans recently), then you'll love Ergo Proxy.  I also highly recommend these other great animes of similar genres:  Akira.  Psycho-Pass, Psycho-Pass 2, Arise Ghost in the Shell 1&2 , 3&4, Knights of Sidonia, and Dante's Inferno.
