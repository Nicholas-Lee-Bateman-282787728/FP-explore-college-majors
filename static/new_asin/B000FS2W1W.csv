2582608,1,B000FS2W1W,"Hunky guys, pretty women, and even scream queen PJ Soles (who is strictly in here just for her name, because she's useless) can't save this one. Using the same exact legend of that was the basis for Darkness Falls, this film gets worse and worse as it moves along, after a really creepy intro.

The acting is terrible, and the bottom line is, the ""spirit"" of tooth fairy goes around killing people using modern day power equipment, like wood chippers and nail guns. There's nothing scary or atmospheric about it. The only thing it has going for it is a couple of good gore scenes.

Seriously, if you're going to steal an idea from a movie that was panned by critics and horror fans, seems like it would be a snap to make it tens times better.

I'll stick to Darkness Falls and it's creepy atmosphere.",1155081600,6,800,4.465753424657534

2582614,4,B000FS2W1W,"Just a note- this isn't related to Dwayne Johnson's Tooth Fairy, haha.  Don't make THAT mistake and accidentally pick up the wrong movie!  One's a comedy, the other's a horror.  The two movies are extremely different and it wouldn't be very pleasant if say, you bought this movie by mistake for your child as a Christmas present and he or she found out the hard way.

This movie is downright strange in many different ways.  The writing itself is strange.  Calling it ""The Tooth Fairy"" is too basic of a name.  It should have been called something more appropriate like, to give one example, ""The Witch Fairy!""  Or ""The Tooth Collector"".  Just calling it the Tooth Fairy is too bland.  It's about a family out in the country who discover from their spooky-clichd lady neighbor that they live in a dangerous house where a tooth-collecting witch once lived, and she's returned so all their lives are in danger.  It just so happens the young daughter Nicole Munoz still has a few baby teeth making her a perfect candidate!

This movie is filled with questionable moments and many of them don't make much sense to me.  For one thing when the mother (played by Chandra West) and her daughter Nicole Munoz stop at a gas station, the two scummy men who work there immediately give the mother a hard time and proceed to rape her while the daughter stands by the car door and watches this puzzling bit of storytelling unfold which is quite the intense and surprising moment for one thing, however when they arrive to Chandra's husband (or ex-husband's) house played by Lochlyn Munro she explains what happened when he notices her window had been knocked out by the gas station workers after she managed to escape the rape and drive away.  But he... doesn't seem to care at all.  He's more like ""Oh yeah, those two!  They do that sometimes!""  What the heck?  Isn't he supposed to, I dunno, CONFRONT them?  Instead of brushing it off as no big deal?

Anyway to make matters more confusing, I often get Chandra West mixed up with another person living in the house played by Carrie Anne Fleming.  The two resemble each other a lot.  In fact there's a reason they both resemble each other besides just looking similar- they both talk in a seductive kind of way, and with the low budget flow of the storyline and film overall it really makes the beginning of the Tooth Fairy seem like it's in the process of setting up a sexual scene and that this is an adult movie.  Even the sexual music that plays while the family is eating dinner makes one wonder where this movie is going.  It's all very weird to me!

However ignoring all that, the film does improve quite a bit.  Whereas it turns out the gas stations workers are nothing more than a couple knucklehead pests that come across more threatening than they really are, it's still surprising in one scene when they flat out smack Chandra in the face along with her husband (Lochlyn Munro) only for the husband to suddenly get up and lay the two out.  They AGAIN brush it off as no big deal in the later scene.  Not to mention these two actually tried raping the woman earlier in the movie.  Some seriously bad writing taking place here!  And since I'm on a roll here noticing all kinds of problems, why is there so many people living in the house?  Of course they are only there to provide more juicy deaths by the witch but their actual reason for being there is puzzling unless it was mentioned somewhere and I missed it.

However let's mention more important aspects of this movie...

Basically the little girl Nicole Munoz is the star.  She actually deserves to be the one who gets the most attention because she's the only character who actually acts normal and sensible.  She portrays herself as a typical kid interested in Harry Potter films and initially thinks the story of a witch in the area provides entertainment instead of feeling threatened when she becomes friends with a ""girl"" around her age that lives in the neighborhood who occasionally appears and informs Nicole of a tooth-collecting witch.  Now if I was a little 10-year old girl I'd probably be freaked out by such news, but Nicole's brave and doesn't seem to mind... initially.

Anyway another unusual feature is that despite the low budget quality of the movie, it's surprising that the deaths themselves are REALLY graphic and bloody (especially the bedroom scene when the one character is chained to the wall and has her guts pouring out onto the floor- shown in all its graphic glory).  Hilarious that Lochlyn Munro actually thinks it's an accident when another character gets shoved in a woodchipper.  He clearly sees all the blood when he opens the garage door and turns the light on, yet he somehow comes to the conclusion it's an accident.  Right.

Overall this is a great horror with a LOT of flaws.  It's a minor miracle I'm not giving it a lower rating.  The presence of the witch appearing unpredictably in her mission to collect teeth offers enough entertainment to win me over, and the brutal and bloody murder segments are of high enough quality that I enjoy the movie overall but expect illogical moments to occur quite often.",1410825600,,5156,4.63215859030837
2582615,3,B000FS2W1W,"Lisa (Clare Kramer) is a stripper with stage 4 cancer. She hasn't informed her boyfriend Maxx (Matt Keeslar) who simply believes the smell and vomit is because she is a drug addict. Lisa's dancing style catches the eye of Mariel (Serena Scott Thomas) who recruits the near dead Lisa into a vampire coven. Maxx believes Lisa is dead until he sees her out one night at the Inferno Club. Eventually Maxx becomes one of them and the story becomes one of a bizarre metaphor for addiction.

The film had plenty of blood. In fact our vampires are not overly neat and bathing appears to be optional. It was a little much. Most female vampires eventually become topless except for Lisa who wears a colored see-through early on. There were times the film had that classic ""Dusk to Dawn (D2D)"" feel to it, but it didn't last. Fans of the D2D series with low standards should like this feature.

Scary Movie, for example. He is hilarious in it. So, seeing someone that i am used to making me laugh, in a horror movie......I couldn't wrap my head around it. But maybe it's just me. One more thing, The reactions in this movie were terrible. That was one thing that needed to be worked out, before releasing this film.

2582626,3,B000FS2W1W,"This movie isn't as bad as people think, although I can understand why some would think that. This is a movie about a pair of recovering addicts now faced with the addiction of blood as new vampires and their struggle to both beat their fixation and regain their humanity and morality. It's not a bad story; just executed badly. The script isn't too bad, although amateurish, and the actors do a good job for what they're given. The only real likable character here is the sympathetic Lisa, played by Clare Kramer. Everyone else is forgettable and not fleshed out very much. I would say the biggest problem with this movie is the directing. Terrible, horrible directing. You wouldn't notice it until you see it done badly. The whole pacing of the movie is rushed and off-kilter, and it feels like they're always strapped for time, not ever letting emotional or dramatic scenes sink in with the audience. The effects and props are also horrible in this movie, with blood being some kind of strawberry soda, apparently. Even grape juice would be a cheaper, better-looking alternative to the oragne-pinkish water they use in this as blood. The oddest thing about the movie is, although clearly vampires, they never once call them ""vampire"" by name in the movie, they don't have fangs, and for the most part, are as strong and agile as regular humans. While clearly done intentionally, it just makes them seem more like crazed cannibals than actual vampires. Other than the fact that nobody fights back in the movie, they aren't intimidating, at all. Not one of the worst movies ever, and it has an interesting premise, but the horrible directing, rushed pace, and uber-cheap special effects and props hurt it from being what could've been a better movie.",1287792000,,1751,4.84

2582629,2,B000FS2W1W,"Just finished this movie after renting it. I'm glad that I only rented it!  First, I will say that I enjoyed Darkness Falls.  It was creepy and the back story made sense.  Second, I will say that The Tooth Fairy is not an awful movie, it's not very good.  I don't mind low-budget effects and I can stomach a few bad actors (which brings us back to the low budget).  But there's no reason that the story can't be good, well thought out and well-paced.  The Tooth Fairy has none of these qualities.  There's no back story at all.  I thought I was going to be treated to a twist on the legend of the tooth fairy, but there's no legend here, just a serial killer.  The story has more holes than an eight year old's smile ... what happened to the brother of the boy in the prologue?  Did he just pretend nothing happened?  The children have tombstones so obviously bodies were recovered.  Where?  How?  How were the murders never detected?  Why is the woman doing this?  Why should I care?  Why are guests of a B&B talking about leases?  It's an inn, not an apartment building.  Why does the doctor-turned-writer never write?  At least the ""song-writer"" attempts something!
I love that, in the commentary, one of the actors asked how the children knew which tooth has theirs.  Stephen J. Crannell dismisses the actor's comment and calls him an ""idiot"".  Best not to bring up Crannell's plot holes to his face in the future.
Also, interesting about the commentary:  there's a scene where I knew, I just knew that they were going to do a reveal using a mirror.  It didn't happen and gave the movie a little credit right then and there.  Turns out Crannell wrote the mirror reveal into the scene and it just wasn't filmed that way. Crannell seemed a little put out.
The acting is fair to middle.  The two girls can be a little grating, but that is the way with most child actors, in my opinion.  Plus much of it is the fault of the script and not the girls.  There's chemistry between Lockyn Munro and Chandra West, Jesse Hutton and Carrie Fleming are great looking and Steve Bacic is a hoot.  I didn't care for the Deliverance Brothers.  They were uneven blend of comic-relief and some very nasty varmits.  PJ Soles (why does no one seem to remember that she was in Carrie as well as Halloween?) is indeed wasted here.  But even in the few minutes of screen time she gets, her accent wavers in and out.
The gore is handled fairly well but if you're a horror fan, you've seen it and seen it done better.  If you're not, the gore won't appeal to you anyway.
Check out Darkness Falls instead.",1263340800,,2582,4.414012738853503

2582631,2,B000FS2W1W,"As The Thirst starts up, it wouldn't come to a surprise if one were to think this is an absolutely horrible flick just by watching the first few minutes.  Between some horrid acting and just some generally confusing plot elements, it is easy to think this.  Still, there's something about The Thirst that keeps you watching, and there's some depraved fun to be had as well, even though that doesn't last quite long.  Matt Keeslar (Masters of Horror: Family) and Clare Kramer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) star as a couple who are recovering addicts, and both get drawn to a vampire clan led by accent-changing Darius (Jeremy Sisto).  It isn't long before blood starts gushing like water, and the two face a new addiction while they begin to rebel against their new ""family"".  While there is a great amount of blood, gore, and nasty moments, The Thist doesn't offer a whole lot.  There are many times when its small budget becomes too aparrent, and many of the action and effects sequences don't help things either.  Even the supporting cast, which includes Serena Scott Thomas, Tom Lenk (another Buffy vet), Neil Jackson (Blade: The Series), and the great Adam Baldwin come off as not being too interested in what's going on.  Still, there's enough bloody and nasty moments to hold your attention, and for that alone, The Thirst is worth a look for vampire flick fans.",1227139200,4,1365,4.778723404255319

Yes, this is a story of vampire junkies.  Blood junkies.  In love.  A more obnoxiously and clumsily executed allegory I could not imagine.  But for we real life blood junkies, this flick delivers big time.  This may well be the single bloodiest vampire movie I've ever seen.  I'm not sure if that deserves praise when every little nick on the arm creates a torrent of red fluid so profuse that dubbing it ""arterial spray"" just doesn't cut it.  It's almost slapstick.  The characters are almost across-the-board lame, the protagonists unlikeable, the ""detox"" scene is embarrassing, and I seriously wanted to harm the actresses paying a pair of grimy feral she-vamps who spend every on-camera second making the most obnoxious noises you can imagine and generally behaving like twin spastics on meth (in fact, that's the exact direction I imagine the director giving them on the set) and yet I enjoyed this movie for several reasons.  Reasons one and two: nudity and gore, the saviors of many a half-aSzed vampire flick.  Reason three: I actually loved the scene where the protagonist attempts to ""turn"" his friend and fails.  I've never seen it happen before, it adds a degree of reality, and it's just a great eye-opening scene for both audience and character that worked.  And reason four: the music was pretty interesting and varied.

If I were a bull, I would have demolished my television because all I saw was red.  And I wasn't angry.  Lots of blood and quality over-the-top gore: check.

2582633,1,B000FS2W1W,"Ya know, I HATE when films move slowly and take forever to establish the plot.  The actors here don't help either, they are weak.  This is one of those movies that implies a kill rather than show anything.  I find that annoying.  I want to see the gore, the kills.  Why bother making a horror film if you're going to skimp?!",1201910400,,324,4.245901639344262
2582634,3,B000FS2W1W,"I have a bit of a hard time classifying The Thirst.  It's a vampire movie and it's exceptionally gore-filled, but I have a hard time calling it a horror film because it's not scary. I know...a lot of horror films are not scary, or some are scary for the wrong reasons (House of the Dead, anyone?). But it's really more that it doesn't try to be scary. What it does try is to be a very stylish vampire film (even with the buckets of blood) and succeeds to a degree but is guilty of trying too hard.

Clare Kramer is an interesting actress. I've seen her in three different roles, first as the God, Glory, in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, then in Gravedancers, one of the After Dark Horrorfest films, and now in this film. I didn't recognize her in either of these two films initially until I had to check to see which part she was playing. To me that's a real tribute to her as an actress and her ability to blend in to any role. She simply did not look like ""Glory"" in either of these two films.

In The Thirst she is Lisa, a drug-addicted stripper who is dying of cancer, a fact she has carefully hidden from her boyfriend, Maxx (Matt Keesler). While dying in the hospital Lisa is visited by a woman who poses as a therapist but in reality is a vampire. Lisa commits suicide but she's already been bitten Sasha and returns to life and is welcomed into Sasha's clan of vamps that includes the leader Darius, a Brit named the Duke of Earl, Lenny, and two rather bizarre women who chatter in an unknown language known just as the sisters.

When Maxx discovers that Lisa is still alive he tries to rescue her from the clan but is captured and given the choice of being killed or joining the family. He chooses the latter and soon is joining them on their depraved blood fests as they descend upon various Goth and strip clubs, slaughtering everyone in a literal deluge of blood. Before long, Maxx and Lisa have second thoughts about their new family and know they need to escape. But Darius and Sasha are not going to let them walk away...

The Thirst is one gory film! The victims of the vampires don't just get a couple of fang marks in their necks, they get their throats ripped out, sending blood gushing out like a ruptured water pump. Entrails are torn out and snacked and on unfortunate stripper has the back of her head torn like a Christmas present. This leaves our vampires covered in red from head-to-toe.

The Thirst goes for a stylish look which detracts from the horror. When the vampires are attacking, the film speeds up to a frenetic, strobe-like pace, and jumps from character to character. Combine that with a techno industrial soundtrack, and it's all a bit disorienting. One of the best scenes is when Maxx and Lisa try to eat a couple of cats and end up with what amounts to a bad acid trip. Kramer and Keesler are able to just go wildly over the top and it's quite amusing.

While the actors may not be household names they are all screen veterans. Adam Baldwin plays Lenny, a backwoods, hillbilly vampire, in a rather wide departure from his usual prim and proper roles as a military officer or government agent. Another Buffy alum making an appearance in The Thirst is Tom Lenk who plays Kronos, an androgynous regular at a Goth club. Also look for Ellie Cornell as Nurse Linda. Cornell is best remembered for her roles in Halloween 4 & 5.

Not a great film but not horrible either. It's certainly different and has abover average performances from the entire cast. The DVD does come with a very wide range of extras including a making of documentary, deleted scenes, Director Commentary, photo gallery, and a ""Favorite Vampire Movie"" featurette.

It is alot like Near Dark. I really don't feel any new territory is covered here, but it is mildly entertaining and pretty well done for a b-movie.

Blood sprays everywhere which does make you wonder just how much they actually consume...which couldn't be much.

Not a classic...but interesting for 1 viewing.",1183507200,,477,4.459770114942529
2582638,3,B000FS2W1W,"Whew.  Where to start?  I rented this for one reason only.  I like Clare Kramer, and true to form, was not disapointed as she again gives a good performance.  The film however is sex and gore and gore and sex.  Yes I know it's rated 'R' and what was I suppose to expect?  Okay, I can live with the topless pair of vampire girls who garble out some kind of speech as they run around seemingly aimlessly just causing mayhem and the gore, though excessive really didn't seem out of place considering the setting.  Within all this depravity enters Lisa (Clare Kramer) who becomes the vampire with the heart of gold.  Even though it's not beating, it's still a heart of gold.  The depiction of vampirism as a drug type addiction was pretty cool and the spectacle of a couple vampires trying to kick the habit was my second favorite part of the film.  My favorite part was the ending.  After all the sex, after all the gore and the chase and the slaughter, this film ends with a tender finale that renews one's faith in the goodness of mankind.  Awwww, wasn't that just so sweet?  I don't think I would watch this again, but it was worth a one time viewing.  Bottom line:  If you're thinking about buying it, rent it first.  You might love it.  Then again you might just change your mind about buying it.  By the way, it says that Ellie Cornell is in the cast.  I love Ellie Cornell too, but I didn't see her.  If I did I didn't recognize her.

2582639,2,B000FS2W1W,"Oh Lord..

  I love Vampire movies, and this kinda delivers.  more like near dark though and that was just ok admittedly far superior acting to this train wreck of a film. but the Idea of a pair of drug addicts becoming vampires, and then becoming addicted (following addictive behavior patterns) to Blood! its just sad that the execution of such a great idea was so poor. and I truly love vampire films, even most of the B style vamp flicks but this? My Personal Recommendation is: if you Must see this film  RENT ONLY 2 star and thats being generous because of the blood addiction idea. and some funny gore (gore being funny here is bad trust me) Avoid...",1180224000,12,657,4.487394957983193
2582640,2,B000FS2W1W,"The cover jacket says that this is a cross between Near Dark and Requiem for a Dream. This is fairly accurate because the vampires here act like blood is the drug and they're all adicts.

The filming of this is disjointed, such as when they all go into a strip-bar to feed. They tear apart all the people there, dancers and patrons. But the camera jumps quickly from one to the other. None of the vampires have fangs, seemingly wishing to tear at the flesh of their vicitms. One even keeps running everyone through with a cane-sword.

The vampires are almost showered in blood. Such a mess is an obvious problem if they want to stay out of the sights of vampire hunters/police, so their solution, leave clues like they're Muslim extremists or a Satanic cult!!! And the guy doing this - Adam Baldwin, speaks with a Texan drawl, but he's supposed to be Palestinian!!! He sits there in his cowboy hat going through the Koran trying to find verses to leave around the crime site.

This makes it just stupid. A hot duo of dark haired vampires seem to spend a lot of time topless and speaking in an intelligible grunting way that makes no sense.

Serena Scott Thomas wants to convert Clare Kramer who's in hospital dying of cancer. She hops onto Clare's bed, drooling something that might be blood, and bites into her in a sudden montage of imagery that's not erotic, but certainly confusing.",1179964800,2,1386,4.576612903225806
2582641,3,B000FS2W1W,"Early on in ""Hatchet Job: The Making of The Tooth Fairy"" featurette on this DVD the actress who plays the titular character in human form comments that this movie is not for little kids.  I mention this because at one point in this direct to video 2006 horror film I was actually thinking that the best explanation for what was happening was that this was indeed a horror movie made for little kids.  But that was before the combination decapitation (male) and topless (female) scene, which made it clear that they really were not making ""Baby's First Horror Film,"" even if the ending is as family oriented as any horror film I have ever seen.

We begin back in 1949 in Northern California when Elizabeth Craven (Karin Konoval), a disfigured witch, developed the nasty habit of killing young children after they had lost their last baby tooth.  Then we jump to the present, where young Pamela (Nicole Munoz) and her mother Darcy Wagner (Chandra West) are spending the weekend at the newly opened bed & breakfast of Peter Campbell (Lochlyn Munro).  Of course the B&B used to be Elizabeth Craven's creepy old house and guess what happens to Pamela when she falls down and bangs her face?  You get the general idea, which is really all you are going to get because it was never clear to me why killing kids after taking their last baby teeth was so important to the old witch.  Pamela makes friends with Emma (Jianna Ballard), who is obviously a ghost.  This matters because since Pamela is the only real kid around the Tooth Fairy is going to have to start taking out the adults at the B&B (which includes a brief appearance by P.J. Soles from ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween/dp/6305546789/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween</a>"").  When the Tooth Fairy kills her first victim I did not understand why she was doing it, but then I realized the motivation was essentially the same for the killing as it was for the choice of the method, a woodchipper: because it was there.

While I did not know anything about ""The Tooth Fairy"" when I put in the DVD to watch, my expectation was that it would not be like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Silent-Night-Deadly-Night/dp/B0000AYLJE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Silent Night Deadly Night</a>,"" where a maniac pretends to be a fictional character beloved by children.  Indeed, this is more of a supernatural tale that essentially reveals the twisted truth about the kindly tooth fairy who gives kids money for their baby teeth.  In folklore the Tooth Fairy is traced back to European stories of elves and brownies who would do helpful tasks or trade treasures for items humans considered useless.  But there are also superstitions about how discarded body parts such as teeth or hair could be used for black magic, and this is the approach taken in ""The Tooth Fairy"" (I have to admit I was hoping for more of an evil elf, like when Anya reveals the myth about Santa Claus being a myth on ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"").  However, while that was the approach and while there are the ghosts of dead children running around to lend pathos of the proceedings, in the end ""The Tooth Fairy"" is a basic splatter flick with an old fashioned hatchet as the weapon of choice.

I just did not connect with this hybrid supernatural slasher flick with the little girl as the heroine, even though individually those elements are okay (I was less impressed by Chuck and Henry, the ""Deliverance""-type tag-team at the local gas station).  You know, if ""The Tooth Fairy"" had come out in the heyday of the slasher film would have seemed a lot better than it does against the current crop of gore fests, so you will either tolerate it or hate it.  In addition to the aforementioned featurette in terms of extras on the DVD there is another promotional quickie and then ""Loose Tooth,"" the audio commentary with director Chuck Bowman, producer Stephen J. Cannell, and actor Jessie Hutch.  Note: ""The Tooth Fairy"" is not to be confused with ""Tooth Fairy,"" a 2004 Amazon Theater short with Chris Noth that featured Jeff Bezos as a security guard.

Final Note: This was the movie where I first looked at the Plot Keywords for the film at the International Movie Data Base.  The top ten keywords for this movie were: (1) woodchipper, (2) topless, (3) mulching a person, (4) tooth fairy, (5) tooth extraction, (6), slasher, (7) redneck, (8) nail gun, (9) haunted house, and (10) gore.  I wanted to make a point about the relative inaccuracy of this particular list (the hatchet is way more prominent than the woodchipper even if not as memorable and the topless scene is done to set up a joke and not to provide titillation), but I quickly became distracted by the fact that you can click on a keyword and actually come up with the top movies on the IMDB for each category.  ""The Tooth Fairy"" comes in 16th of 17 films featuring ""tooth extraction"" (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Schindler-s-List/dp/B00012QM8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Schindler's List</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Finding-Nemo/dp/B00005JM02/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Finding Nemo</a>"" are one and two because the movies are organized by their IMDB ratings), but 7th of 10 films on the ""woodchipper"" list (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fargo/dp/B00009W5CA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fargo</a>"" is only #3, although ""The Tooth Fairy"" did finish ahead of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Woodchipper-Massacre/dp/B000JLTSB2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Woodchipper Massacre</a>"").

2582643,1,B000FS2W1W,"I picked this one up at the store with Saw and Silent Hill, thinking that it would be in appropriate company.  Was I ever wrong!  The Tooth Fairy is of profoundly lower caliber in every way.  While the concept was good, the execution was the real horror in this one.  Cut out the stuff that television censors don't care for, and you've got a ""made for TV movie"" - period.

Apologies to the other reviewer who claimed that the acting between the two little girls was good, but I have to disagree; it's some of the worst acting I've seen, and I'm hardly a movie critic.

My take?  Do yourself a favor and buy something else.",1172016000,2,623,4.318965517241379
2582644,4,B000FS2W1W,"I will spare you the plot premise because you've heard it all before in other reviews and I detest people who give away all the secrets a movie has got to give cuz ""Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?"" That being said, here goes: P.J. Soles can't be lamblasted here for her performance because she appears so briefly that you barely have time to note her at all but she has learned to be creepy in the minutes she has on film. The CHILDREN are what makes this movie and saves it from becoming a total fiasco. The scenes with the 2 little girls in them are very well acted by two young actresses who do not seem to realize they are even IN a B movie and sew up many of the plot holes it tends to have. This version of the Tooth Fairy legend is right up there with the original When A Stranger Calls and When A Stranger Calls Back for being one of those films that sticks in your mind for several reasons: The plot was a good idea and they did the best they could with the money they had and it shows. The comedic antics of the burn-out band dude are hilarious yet subtle and involve mostly facial expressions and hand gestures that save a lot of the scenes. His ""outer limits I'm picking up bad karma and aura"" girlfriend is too funny at times as well which shows the cast knew how to poke fun at themselves. Most importantly>>> It has the unique distinction of being the ""Horror Movie With The Funniest Line Ever Uttered Amidst Bloodbath"" out of any I have ever viewed so look for the scene when the two local yokel brothers are running around the woods and one brother chooses to ask the other an ALL TOO OBVIOUS HERE'S YOUR SIGN QUESTION.... and yes, I AM gonna leave it at that. BUT>>> After he uttered it I: 1.)Tried hard to not roll into the floor crying I was laughing so hard. 2.)Replayed it several times to see the ""cheesey special effect"" and hear the line uttered again. 3.)HAD to watch it again with Director commentary to hear what Stephen J. Cannell had to say about this scene. 4.) RAN into work the next day, telling a co-worker named ""Chuck"" (the brother the line refers to) that he HAD to see this movie. Now... if that don't intrigue ya enough to see it, you are NOT a fan of cult classic horror movies.

2582645,4,B000FS2W1W,"The Tooth Fairy is one of the recent straight to DVD films from Anchor Bay, but unlike the previous movies (Room 6, It Waits) the Tooth Fairy is a surprisingly good, and surprisingly bloody, horror film that for most of it's running time is a real blast.  Lochlyn Munro and Chandra West (who still looks great) play a couple who move into an old house, only to find themselves and their young daughter (Nicole Muoz) terrorized by a demonic version of the fabled fairy that brings you money for your baby teeth.  Loaded with some grisly gore effects that are plenty shocking, the Tooth Fairy manages to be riveting, and offers up enough surprises, blood, and nudity to keep you interested.  Sometimes the dialogue is a little grating, but for the most part the Tooth Fairy manages to entertain, and is surprisingly good.

Darkness falls was more of a atmospheric ghost film. I just want to be entertained and not pick everything apart. This movie was gory at times and suspenseful at times with a little humor thrown in.

2582648,3,B000FS2W1W,"If you have kids and want to discourage them from legends like the tooth fairy, then let them watch this one and I guarantee, they'll never think of hiding a tooth again!

This Stephen J. Cannell produced thriller is both ludicrous and grim, but it hearkens back to the days of horror movies that actually resolve themselves instead of offering some convoluted plot that never really tells you what happened.

In this film, the tooth fairy is an old witch who takes a child's last tooth and then kills them to collect their souls.  The latest victim is a young girl named Pamela whose mom, Darcy, is the almost fiancee of a former doctor turned wanna be writer.  The ghost of a little girl warns Pamela who in turn tries to warn the disbelieving adults, but alas and alack, by the time they do believe her, nasty tooth fairy has dispensed of a lot of victims.  It's all pretty silly but done with such sincerity you'll find yourself caught up in its plot.  Lochlyn Munro, Chandra West, PJ Soles and Steve Bacic turn in competent performances and it would be pretty scary for the kids, so I won't recommend youngsters view this one.",1156636800,4,1131,4.54679802955665

The effects are, shall we say, well-intentioned but cheesy, and the cast has fun with it (particularly Andromeda's Steve Bacic playing a stoner musician). I enjoyed ""Tooth Fairy"" more with the commentary added: Cannell has a lot to say about filmmaking - staging, angles, etc, and it was interesting.
