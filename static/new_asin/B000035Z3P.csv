7916759,3,B000035Z3P,"An interesting choice of films to ship together.  Animal House and Fast Times would be considered classics, but then the addition of American Pie?  A good movie but it just doesn't suit the rest...  Guess I just like my  sets to hold a more specific theme than ""it has a school in it doesn't  it?""...
All up, I'd say I enjoyed all of these movies.  Each has  it's own appeal, Animal House for the classic dumb frat house road trip  style, Fast Times for the fresh dialog - well it was for it's time...  And  American Pie made for a nice feel-good movie with some good laughs along  the way.  I expect all three had hidden lessons to be learnt but I sure  missed 'em all :)
Get it if you like some harmless dumb fun at a low  price.",960595200,,731,4.128571428571429
