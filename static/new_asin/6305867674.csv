But this sole episode however, is hilarious and reveal Dottie's talent for musical comedy. Besides, she is stunningly beautiful...a real glamorous filmstar! The copy is very good as well!",1250640000,,278,5.065217391304348
7897255,1,6305867674,"This is one of the worst movies ever made.  A jumble of stars, at least three directors, comedy so lame that it only cause groans (when not snores).  Henry Fonda and James Stewart making fools of themselves.  Harry James ogling a starlet who was supposed to be playing the trumpet.  A dreadful experience, best avoided.",1236643200,,319,4.745454545454545
7897256,4,6305867674,"Released by United Artists, On Our Merry Way boasts an all-star cast with a decent storyline. It might sound similar to some of the wartime films that were packed with stars but skimped on the plot, but this film really gives its players a chance to shine.

Oliver Pease (Burgess Meredith) works in the want-ads at the local newspaper, but he has told his wife (Paulette Goddard) that he is the roving reporter who interviews unsuspecting strangers with a single question of the day. She urges him to ask for a raise and to use her question that asks how a child has had an influence on your life. Stuck in an impossible situation, Oliver goes to work, dons a disguise, and convinces his boss to let him be the roving reporter for the day.

He gets to work and first discovers two musicians (Henry Fonda and James Stewart) who tell him about a baby and a music contest. It turns out the baby is a grown woman, but no matter. They agreed to fix the competition so the mayor's no-talent son (Carl ""Alfalfa"" Switzer) could win, but everything goes awry. Next, Oliver stumbles upon a movie star (Dorothy Lamour) who tells him about a child star who helped her to rise in her career. She shows off her skills in a sarong with a cute musical number as well. Last, Oliver interviews a man (Fred MacMurray) who tells the story of he and his friend's (William DeMarest) meeting with an impossible little boy. The boy is a runaway, but he is so troublesome that even his own uncle (Hugh Herbert) doesn't want him back.

Back to the newsroom with the article, but everything is not quite as it seems. The Pease family conclusion offers a nice bookend to the story. On Our Merry Way is unlike many Hollywood films of the time because it features so many famous stars but only gives them about a half hour each of screen time. Luckily, they all make the most of their time.

Unfortunately, this DVD has no special features whatsoever, but the picture quality is clear and crisp.",1219708800,7,1965,4.495798319327731
