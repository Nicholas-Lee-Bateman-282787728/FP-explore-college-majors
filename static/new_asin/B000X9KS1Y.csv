8307796,2,B000X9KS1Y,"I've had this movie on my wish list for months because I heard some time ago that it is one of Tracy Ryan's best (Ryan here is credited as ""Tracey Voyek"" as well as ""Stacy Noel""--setting some kind of record, I would think, for movie aliases).

Boy, was that ever bad information. Ryan is known for steaming up the screen and baring it ALL--soft-core aficionados know what I'm talking about. She doesn't even approach that in this flop. Neither does anybody else.

If you are looking to get this instead of its even-more-bland cut, marketed as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Stalker/dp/B000BNX558/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Stalker</a>, in the hopes of seeing more flesh...I wouldn't recommend it. Though I've never seen ""The Stalker,"" ""The Seduction of Maxine"" fails to deliver much more than you'd get with an R rating.

How do you make a soft-core direct-to-DVD release featuring Ryan, Tera Patrick and heck, even Monique Parent (bafflingly called ""Scarlet Johansing"" here...no, not a misprint) with absolutely NO explicit nudity? Bared breasts are great, and there are a lot of them here--first sex scene crops up two minutes into the picture--but come on, there is much more to a woman than her breasts, and here in Ryan and Patrick you have two of the hottest in the biz. You've got to capitalize on what you have. Whomever this Madison Monroe chick is who directed this didn't know the audience very well. If the movie was cut in half across its horizon, you could toss away the bottom half and never miss a thing. There isn't ever even a decent full-frontal shot. Heck, there isn't even a single shot of any of the actesses in the nude taken from behind. You can see rear nudity on late-night network TV these days.

I had been expecting so much more. I did perk up in one scene in when Patrick announces ""I'm going to go take a shower,"" and thought ""Here it finally comes!"" NO. The shower happens off-camera in between scenes. You never even see her disrobe. What were they thinking???

As for the production quality...I'd put it at the top of the bottom third of movies of this genre. While the style will remind you of some of the old Eros movies, that kind of quality is not attained. In one scene a fly is buzzing around in front of the camera lens (I kid you not) and in two others, the ""sling"" that the male actors wear in sex scenes to keep from having direct contact with their co-stars is visible for a second. Just look for the polka dots. Why they chose black-and-white polka dots, I am unsure, but I suppose it makes at least as much sense as hiring hard-core pornographic-film actresses and then never showing us why you hired them.

The writing is godawful--""Maxine"" has a wild personality swing from one scene to the next, and what passes for the plot resolution is about as stupid as anybody could have devised. And Parent always has reminded me of some kind of half-masculine freak anyway. Why anyone ever considered her hot, I'll never know. I'm sure that she has her fans, but you could skip this one and never know the difference.

In short, if you're looking for flicks of this type, go for anything from the Eros or Image Entertainment lines such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fast-Lane-to-Malibu-Fast-Lane-to-Vegas-Unrated/dp/B0001906UY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fast Lane to Malibu/Fast Lane to Vegas (Unrated)</a>--a much better offering with Ryan--or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Personals-College-Girl-Seeking/dp/B000FVKIQK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Personals College Girl Seeking</a>--a much better offering with Patrick.",1215216000,9,3705,5.333904109589041
