7954377,5,B00005UDTH,"A senator argues for the integration of women into field combat, and Jordan is the test case for the first woman to go through training to become a Navy Seal. No one expects her to succeed. I was so impressed with this movie. It explores the politics involved behind the scenes of a controversial move and the intense training involved in becoming a Seal. Demi Moore is perfect in her rolea major badass. There is a lot of action in this film including an actual combat mission. If you enjoy action movies and war movies, you will love this film. Extremely well done.",1487635200,,567,4.514563106796117
