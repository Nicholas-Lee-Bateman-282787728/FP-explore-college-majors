4640907,1,B005AI5G6K,"This is not really a rate on the movie itself, rather than the fact that there was no sound. I even tried logging out and going back into the movie and still had no sound. I'm not sure if this is for everyone, but I could not watch the movie, since there was no sound.",1439078400,6,268,3.890909090909091

4640910,4,B005AI5G6K,"Its more of a live action Anime film. Its unique but we love cosplay and X-men and movies like this so we enjoyed it. It was like Teenwolf and American Werewolf in Paris! If you want the same movies watch the ones already here, but if you want something other than people in beards at a small town killing people in the woods than this is your film",1438732800,,348,4.132352941176471

4640913,1,B005AI5G6K,"The storyline was confusing, the movie didn't make much sense.  The special effects were terrible,  the acting was horrible as well.",1467590400,,132,5.238095238095238
4640914,1,B005AI5G6K,I want my two hours back. This story was hard to follow. It did not help that whoever mixed the sound did the most terrible job. Impossible to hear them talking. There was no great werewolf transformation. It was simply a waste of time.,1466035200,,236,4.386363636363637
4640915,4,B005AI5G6K,Very good movie. Kept me watching.,1464998400,,34,4.833333333333333
4640916,1,B005AI5G6K,It was really bad quality.,1464307200,,26,4.4
4640917,1,B005AI5G6K,"put in junk file. It seems only movies of questionable quality are free. Also why charge a rental fee for movies over 5 years old? Amazon Prime offers the same deal as cable, so why buy it. Think I will be dropping this""not so special"" deal",1463270400,,240,4.239130434782608
4640918,1,B005AI5G6K,"Just did not like the type of film that seemed very low budget.  Main male character had oddly strange ""emo, goth, no expression"" type of vibe that made it very awkward to watch and could not get interested.  I usually love B rated movies this one seemed to be hard to watch and made me want to fast forward to see if the movie improved.",1462492800,,337,4.1692307692307695

acting was .. well.. mediocre .. story line a good concept that is about it",1462320000,,194,4.361111111111111
4640920,1,B005AI5G6K,Terrible movie. Wouldn't have wasted time making it.,1462147200,,52,5.625
4640921,1,B005AI5G6K,"The only explanation that I could come up with after making it through the whole movie was that they editors got a bunch of movies all mixed up and then accidentally put them together and released it by accident. This was totally incomprehensible. Sometimes the bad guys turn into werewolves, other times they turn into dogs and there are a few other stages in between. Sometimes the werewolves are people before they turn other times they have black stuff non their faces and wear welding goggles. Oh yeah, sometimes the action takes place on earth and sometimes on other planets. The male lead looks like an anime character and he talks to himself out loud a lot. Everybody seems to be in the same literature class with a professor that implies that she is 2,000 years old but that doesn't go anywhere. Other people talk to the characters as well but that really doesn't go anywhere either. Some old hillbilly is hired by the werewolves and he drinks 500 proof moonshine, which I don't think is even possible.",1461801600,4,1011,4.685393258426966

4640923,2,B005AI5G6K,"The only reason I watch it is because Cameron white who played chance was so hott but if your not into Emo guys you will not like it!
Other wise it wasn't very good",1461196800,,164,3.8529411764705883

4640926,1,B005AI5G6K,If I was able to give half a star I would. This movie has potential to be very entertain because of the story line but the acting and the ending was terrible.,1460073600,,158,3.96875

4640930,4,B005AI5G6K,Cool monster! People do make stupid decisions in these movies!,1457395200,,62,5.3
4640931,1,B005AI5G6K,"Seriously do not get this, it is perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. The plot looked really appealing and even the trailer looked goodish, but the acting was absolutely the worst I have come across. It appeared as if it was everyone's first day of acting.",1456531200,,259,4.531914893617022
4640932,1,B005AI5G6K,Really? I mean good grief! This broke my heart. A wolf should look like it's actually walking on the ground. The one wolf that walked past the lady he killed was clearly the worst CGI ever. Looks like someone needs to watch their own film before letting others watch it.,1455580800,,270,4.42
4640933,1,B005AI5G6K,"Worst werewolf movie I've ever seen. Thankfully this was on Prime Video and I didn't have to waste my money on it. Terrible acting, terrible effects and terrible story.",1454371200,,168,4.827586206896552

4640936,1,B005AI5G6K,"WTF did I just watch/skim through? This was some Last Airbender/Emo crap, not a real werewolf movie. And to add insult to the brain injury sustained from viewing this, it ended on a ""cliffhanger"" (it's a cliffhanger if you care what happens next).

This was just terrible.",1453766400,,272,4.787234042553192

4640942,1,B005AI5G6K,"If there were a way to leave negative stars for this movie, I would do so. I felt like I was watching something that was written, directed, and filmed while everyone involved was on an acid tripand a bad one at that.

4640948,1,B005AI5G6K,was not impressed at all. It was like a cheesy home movie and the sound of the voices was so muted I couldn't even use it as a sleep aid. It was like an essay from a junior high student.,1442275200,2,186,3.675

4640952,2,B005AI5G6K,"There is a college community and Chace (Cameron White) is one of the students. He is taking literature after failing out of drama. He meets a number of interesting young ladies as he acts weird. There is also a local werewolf community that kills people, a community that came from the Vietnam Timber Wolf- not to ruin it for you, but Eric Roberts has a Vietnam flashback were he has long hair as an American Soldier and he sees a Vietnamese turn into a Timber Wolf.

Now that I mention it, the werewolves are a head scratch. Sometimes they are just plain real wolves. Sometimes they are awkwardly moving CG wolves that look like regular wolves. Other times they are huge classic clay animation wolves. Other times it is just people with sharp teeth who look like vampires.

Chace is a quiet lad who has ""the inability not to speak."" He meets ""The Dawn"" (Stasi Esper) who ""can see what you're hearing.""  The subtitle ""Pray for sunrise"" didn't really fit as the wolves seem to control their turning, as one turned during the day. Eric Roberts had a confusing role, one they should have just cut out. Soon Hollywood will realize having Eric Roberts in the film will decrease sales.

The soundtrack was metal and offered lyrics such as ""I'm not the person you once knew"" which is great for a werewolf film.

8463286,1,B005AI5G6K,"Wow. I barely survived the whole, incomprehensible thing! I personally would like to leave NO STARS, but with AMZ I had to leave at least one. And the(what felt like an excruciatingly long time) entire speech on ""the venom strike""....absolutely ridiculous. Which is what tied it into the rest of the movie so well.

8463287,1,B005AI5G6K,"I lasted 1 hour into this before jumping up to turn it off when the ""featured song"" started blaring out.  I have no idea what this movie was about because I couldn't hear the dialogue, even though the background noises/music were too loud.  I kept dozing off when there were stretches of dialogue because I couldn't hear what was being said, but then I would jerk awake when the garbage noises/""music"" took over.  The description sounded like this might be a good movie, but from what I saw this didn't live up to its description.  I won't say this was poorly written or acted or filmed.  I will say that any merits the movie may have had were lost by poor sound editing (and garbage music.)",1494547200,,691,4.4523809523809526
