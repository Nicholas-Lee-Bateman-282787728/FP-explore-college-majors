8611033,5,B00F00BBXK,"This volume includes the graduation of Maya from the Flight Attendant school.  What is missing is the group performance by the FAs.  I don't know why it was omitted and it is one of the highlights of that episode.  Overall, it has all the good parts including the episode when Ser Chief took Maya to Phil. University of Sciences for their little rendezvous in the the field.  This is still a good buy to complete your collection.",1379289600,,429,4.532467532467533
