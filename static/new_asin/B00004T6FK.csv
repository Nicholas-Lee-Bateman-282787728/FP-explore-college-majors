1349559,3,B00004T6FK,"I notice the reviews are really mixed on this tape, but I say it's just OK. I have lots of yoga tapes, and this is the one I reach for the least. I think the instructor's delivery is rather unenthusiastic, although I find it soothing in the relaxation portion, and I feel like I need to hold the poses longer to really benefit from them. It does work the lower body, and it's short enough to do before you go to work, but I just can't get excited about it.",986774400,,456,4.0777777777777775
1349560,4,B00004T6FK,"I am new to yoga and I thought that this was good for beginners. Of course I was not able to move as much as Ms. Deason but I know that it will take  some time to be just as good. I felt very relaxed at the end of the tape  and I have noticed that I am more flexable. Some of the camera angles were  not all that great. Sometimes her back was toward the camera so you really  don't get to see the move correctly and that's the only flaw. The  modifications at the end were also very helpful, for a beginner.",966384000,3,507,3.8365384615384617
1349561,4,B00004T6FK,I found this to be an easy-to-do workout. It doesn't feel strenuous but it does produce excellent results. I'm very pleased with this tape and would recomend any of the Living Yoga workouts.  There are modifications at the  end of the tape to help anyone who needs it.,951091200,,268,4.5625
1349562,1,B00004T6FK,"If you are looking for a tape for beginners, don't look here.  This program puts much strain on your back and shoulders, and you have to be EXTREMELY FLEXIBLE to do most of the moves.  It is definately a waste of  money.",948240000,8,220,4.190476190476191

1349582,2,B00004T6FK,"I just took a break from doing this dvd to write a review. I'm not new to yoga, but it's been awhile since I routinely have done yoga. I would say this hard for beginners and an advanced dvd. My palms are hurting as I'm writing this because of the lower body exercises so far. I would not recommend this for beginners.",1359504000,,318,4.145161290322581
1349583,4,B00004T6FK,"It was a good workout! I'm a beginner with a bit of practice (on and off for about 6 months) but very little skill (not much strength and terrible flexibility). I actually broke a sweat, and kept sweating for most of the routine. The routine had great flow, the background (set in Maui) was attractive, and nearly all the poses were described well. There were a couple of times where she skipped saying what to do next and just did it, but that was pretty rare, and it was easy to catch on by just looking up at the screen. The music was peaceful, nondescript and unobtrusive, as it should be. I only had one really minor gripe about the video, and that was that she spent too much time at the beginning going on and on talking. I can fast-forward through that, though, so it's not a huge concern.",1351382400,,797,4.32
1349584,2,B00004T6FK,"As others have said, this video is not geared toward beginners in any way. Sorta just makes you mad that they label it this way just to sell DVD's. But, I digress.

Actually, I love the workout. I do a lot of yoga and flow is my favorite and this is a great flow workout. It is meant to be fairly quick and each pose ""flows"" into the next. The problem I have with this video is the instruction. Suzanne Deason is one of the more well-known instructors and a regular in the Gaiam videos. So, my question is, how can she do such a poor job of explaining what you are supposed to do? For a good portion of the exercises, you are facing down or away from the TV screen, so you MUST rely on the instructor's verbal commands. Even after doing the video several times, I often have to get up from my position, stop the video, rewind it and watch what the instructor is doing just to figure out what to do. Or how she got from one pose to another. And I am not new to yoga. I have lots of videos and take classes. Never do I have to look up at the instructor if he/she explains the position properly.

Let me give you an example: In downward dog, Suzanne Deason says, ""Turn your feet."" Now, I am there in my downward dog, looking at my feet, thinking, Turn them where? Turn them how? I look up to find that she has moved into upward dog. Never in my life have I heard an instructor call that transition simply ""Turn your feet."" What she is asking you to do is go up on your toes, then flip your feet over from the soles to the top of your feet, lower your legs and arch your back. Now that is not a good explanation, either. But certainly you have more idea what to do that what the instructor said.

Secondly, when you finally get to some standing poses where you can watch the instructor, the audio does not go with the video. This is just poor execution on the part of everyone involved in creating this DVD. There is NO excuse for it. It is not that the dubbing is off, it is more like nobody took the time to see that the two matched up. Maybe Suzanne held the pose a little longer than she was supposed to. Maybe she added something or didn't do something she was supposed to. It's as if they created the script and didn't make any changes to it to match what is actually going on. No, it is not impossible to follow, but it is very annoying and amateurish.

Finally, I must say that I have never experienced a problem with a Rodney Yee video. Everything he does is just great. I wish the other instructors in the Gaiam videos would take a lesson from him in how to execute a yoga workout DVD.",1342310400,,2591,4.1146245059288535
1349585,5,B00004T6FK,"I bought this yoga workout way back when it first came out.  I loved it because I would consider the poses doable for beginners, that want to work into doing them. . .I could do them when I began but I am limber and steady.  I love it because it is not only yoga poses but fluid almost constant movement.  It makes me heat up and I love that.  Suzanne Deason has a wonderful way about her and always makes me feel like she is my friend. Wonderful timeless dvd. . .",1331510400,,464,4.010869565217392
1349586,3,B00004T6FK,"I have a few other Gaiam DVDs for yoga that have Suzanne Deason or Rodney Yee as the instructor.  They are AM/PM Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss (25 min workouts) and Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss (45 min workout)  AM Yoga for Your Week (Rodney Yee with bonus props workout by Suzanne Deason) and Yoga for Women with Suzanne Deason (with bonus monthly cycle workout).  I consider myself to be an advanced beginner and routinely have no difficulty with the 45 minute weight loss workout.  I do have a challenge with Yoga for Women, but it doesn't bill itself as beginner and I have knowledge of breathing techniques, postures and the asanas.

I did read the reviews before I bought Lower Body Yoga for Beginners and bought it anyway because I am ready to push myself to the next level.  This DVD is about right for that (advanced beginner to intermediate practice), as it expects the individual watching to have some knowledge of yoga asanas and techniques for breathing and posture, not to mention much more flexibility than a beginner would ever have.  This 30 min workout was a challenge for me (more than the weight loss 45 minute one!), especially the balancing poses (two or one legged), but one I appreciated for my level of practice and goals.  I could definitely see a true beginner struggling with this one, as I struggled with it the first time I tried it.  In fact, I echo what most reviewers here have said about the DVD.

The DVD definitely works the abs and thighs/glutes.  It will work up a sweat and get your heartrate up.  However, it is mislabeled as 'Beginner'.",1330387200,,1586,4.645161290322581
1349587,5,B00004T6FK,"is the backdrop for this 25-minute yoga DVD. It's called lower body, but this vinyasa practice addresses more than just the lower body. After a brief 3-minute introduction Suzanne, who is alone, guides us through a series of postures using a voice-over. She does not use any Sanskrit terms, and anyone who is bothered by some of the more mystical practices will feel very comfortable with this one. It is labeled beginner, but the poses she shows are not modified. Fortunately, there is a segment at the end which demonstrates modifications using a strap or a block. There is quiet, pleasant music in the background, similar to that heard in other Gaiam yoga DVDs.",1316476800,,664,4.833333333333333
1349588,2,B00004T6FK,"As many have said, this workout is challenging and not for beginners. It makes no effort to make a first time practitioner comfortable with yoga, and indeed is so intimidating in parts that I can see a true beginner simply shutting it off and finding another workout. Knowledge of yoga poses is assumed and transitions may look simple on screen, but a beginner would struggle with moving from downward dog to lunge.

I enjoy the workout, and it does get your heart rate going a bit, and your body feels great when you are done, but this video is not at all for beginners. I am only giving two stars because the workout is decent.",1314057600,2,629,4.469565217391304
1349589,2,B00004T6FK,"I am a yoga teacher and this sequence is most certainly not for beginners.

Most practices begin with deep breathing and connecting to the inner self, to take the student into the body and out of the mind.  Next a beginner might want to be introduced to some warm up poses like cat/cow, kneeling lunge, etc. to warm the body up.  In this video the first sequence begins with downward facing dog, that's held for much too long.

As the model transitions into lunges, her body moves fluidly, like that of a dancer or one who has practiced yoga for many years.  Most new students cannot lift the back leg in downdog and then smoothly transition it into a lunge.  Often the students uses his/her hand is used to grasp the ankle to bring it up to the front of the mat, to place it between the hands.  This modification should be mentioned if indeed this sequence is for beginners.  It's these type of errors that make this a poor dvd for beginners.  The poses are correctly shown, but perhaps a ""beginner model"" should be used to present the pose with modifications.

I will admit that the verbal cues such as ""broaden across your back"" while in downdog and keep the front leg vertical while in the lunge are the type of cues that help a new student.  The instructions on breathing are also very helpful.

Overall, I can a see beginner becoming very frustrated with this DVD and thinking that he/she cannot do yoga.",1311120000,4,1410,4.486274509803922
1349590,2,B00004T6FK,"I have done Yoga before, so I am not a true beginner.  I purchased this, though, since it said ""lower body"" and that is where I need to focus.  I love the scenery of this DVD, love the fluid movements, and love how she explains moves.  However, this goes by too fast.  There is barely enough time to get into one pose before she moves on to another.  If you're a beginner, this can be difficult (or if you're overweight like me and need time to get into positions).  I think this would have been perfect had they allowed a smidge more time in between movements while still keeping the fluidity.",1306368000,,594,4.306306306306307

1349592,5,B00004T6FK,"I've been using this tape on VHS for years and finally had to upgrade to the DVD. I'd say it's on the advanced side of the Beginner's category, which was great because it kept me challenged at first and is something I still keep in the rotation.  It should be noted, however, that it's mostly flowing yoga (often referred to now as Power Yoga), so compared to other Beginner's titles, this may be more challenging and will definitely get your heart rate up.

I also like that it's only about 30 minutes, so I can almost always fit it in.",1230076800,,537,4.36
1349593,5,B00004T6FK,"I LOVE THIS YOGA TAPE. I was the first yoga tape I ever used and is still my favorite, nothing I have found has measured up to this tape. While it does take a few times to get the movements down and some of the positions are harder it gives you something to work towards and after a few weeks I could just listen to the tape and no longer have to watch. I can't say it enough how much I love this tape, in fact I am trying to find it on DVD because my VCR no longer works and I can not find anything that has lived up to this yoga tape so far.",1221955200,,543,3.689655172413793
1349594,5,B00004T6FK,"Fantastic quick moving, flowing practice!  This program got my body heat up and my heart rate up.  I felt GREAT afterwards.  I felt like I worked my entire body, but yet felt limber at the same time.

I would agree with other reviewers that this is probably not a program for beginners.  I would recommend this program to people who:

1. like a fast moving, flowing workout
2. are looking for a more physical practice
3. have some experience with yoga (intermediate beginner, or intermediate)
4. are fairly flexible

I also would agree with other reviewers that the audio dubbing is off some, but this happens in a lot of yoga DVDs and it doesn't bother me too much.  If that is something that bothers you - the dubbing not always being EXACTLY on queue with the movement - you may get annoyed by this DVD.  But I find that you can either watch the screen and ignore the dubbing (and only move when she moves), OR listen to the dubbing and just not watch it.",1218326400,2,958,4.3977272727272725
1349595,5,B00004T6FK,"Though I agree with other reviewers that this DVD seemed more ""advanced"" or ""intermediate"" and also that the voiceover is off at times from the action, I really LOVE this DVD. I really feel like it works--I've noticed a big difference in the muscles in my legs after using this program regularly. Also, the program is a nice length. It also stretches my capacities just enough to be challenging, but not so much that I can't do it. I really recommend this DVD to anyone who is looking for a yoga program that pushes them a little harder and is more of a ""workout"" than some others. I also recommend it to people who have some practice with yoga already, not people who are just starting out.",1206576000,3,691,4.448818897637795
1349596,3,B00004T6FK,"I've done yoga off and on in the past, both via video and also live classes.  This video is definitely not for beginniners.  Some of the poses are intermediate (at least in the live class they were) and in that class we moved into these poses much more slowly and used props to help us.  10 minutes into the DVD, she has you doing the triangle pose and another one (whose name I forget) where you stand on one leg with one arm touching the ground and the other arm and leg in the air. And this moves alone at a fast clip.

I'm also taking away another star because there's no warm up and her verbal cues do not always match what she's doing.  You have to be able to watch the DVD to follow her prompts - not an easy thing to do when you're in down dog! Otherwise I liked this DVD and would recommend it for intermediates.  It has beautiful scenery and Suzanne Deason herself is a pleasant and likable teacher to spend some time with.  It just seems to be mislabeled as ""beginner.""",1201564800,2,980,4.180851063829787
1349597,2,B00004T6FK,"I have a lot of Gaiam videos and this is the only one that I have been disappointed in.  This video is not for beginners.  I consider myself to be an advanced beginner and I had a hard time with this one.  Most beginners could not do half of what she does.  She only shows modifications at the end which doesn't do much good.  She does the half moon, warrior 3 and another balancing pose that I am sorry but I do not know the name of.  (Looks like a tea pot pouring tea).  They aren't advanced poses, but they aren't real easy either.  She also moves into them rather quickly, I couldn't keep up.  I kept up better with Rodney Yees Power Yoga (not for beginners)! Even the stretches she does in the end are impossible for someone who is not extremely flexible.  Better know some modifications to do this one.  I was really frustated, almost gave up. The reason I gave it a two and not a one is because I think it would be great for someone more advanced(but it says for beginners). As always with Gaiam, the scenery is beautiful. I may pull it out again in a year or so.",1160179200,9,1070,4.170731707317073
1349598,5,B00004T6FK,"this video is very addicting. i am not one for working out, and i do not have alot of time either. i felt better and more relaxed after doing the yoga. i have tried others but this one is far the best. i did feel more toned up, but i wasn't looking to go down a few sizes either. my clothes were just a little bit loser after a month. but i felt great and i looked foward to doing the yoga.",1159488000,,390,3.768292682926829
1349599,4,B00004T6FK,I agree with some of the other reviews.  I consider myself a yoga beginner but I've been doing yoga for a couple of months before I got this tape.  I knew some of the poses and had seen pictures of others but never attempted them.  I think some understanding of yoga is required for this tape because of the speed of the routine.  Sometimes it goes too fast from one pose to the next without explaining the pose in detail.  I'm glad I bought this tape used.,1109376000,,457,4.206896551724138
1349600,4,B00004T6FK,"Before I got this video I read these reviews. I was spurred on by the undertone of vigorousness in some of the reviews. I am not a beginner in terms of physical activities so that yoga presented here is not a first timer kind of challenge. Though  not unaware of what the less thrilled reviews had to say. I got the tape and the first time I worked along with it to see how I like it...I give this video a 4 stars rating!. I find it invigorating and a challenge because I know how to deal with it I think. It has a lot of good poses/combination of, to offer and in a niffy 20 minutes as well. I am very glad I lessened to what turned out to be my better judgement. Contrastly, here are the problems:

1) ""Beginners"":  The word ""Beginner"" is a BIG mislead. Probably used for promotional/commercial sell to that ""market"". It is overall a good workout...for ADVANCED BEGINNER/INTERMEDIATE. If you look at the back of the video cover you will see ""Dancer"" pose which may not be considered beginner as such but may not be enough of a hinter at the deception.

2) The hold of the poses: While she is trying to do ""POWER YOGA"" and thats fine, there must have a decent moment where you finish the pose completely. Its like a dancer who does a beautiful jump and just comes out of it not holding it to establish the move, so that its unfinished, not fulfilled visually nor physically. This is what makes it seems so ""fast"" and ""quick"". She does not hold some of he poses to a basic finality and benefit, thus the cutting it off for the next pose. This is disconsorting even for advanced beginners/intermediates at first.

3) The poses themselves: Issues of abilitiy, flexibility, mobility, alingment are things not taken into account at this level of a tape it is assumed or presumed which is why I say its better as a advanced beginner/intermediate. When she does the pose where you raise your leg behind up in the air face downward hands on the floor. She needs to hold this pose a bit. You might as well kick the leg up and back down that as much time as you get with her. In general, though I love that pose and am able to get a good stretch by adding my own alterations; head to knee with leg up. For a beginners to maneuver this kind of thing is hard especially if they follow her just timing. In some instances even she a little too jump the gun for herself. I try to complete a pose even if I am a smig behind her pace its fine. Also for me she trys to get in a too much instruction in places where she could say less and allow the pose to be experienced and not to be held static in the meantime. The music is the same as the Rodney Yee yoga..which is a great plus for me, its produced by the same people/Living Arts. But I found my tape music too low and her voice overriding it. As always with these kind of videos you have to take into account any back, knee, etc issues you have.

On the upside I can see why some people really did like it. For one they are probably NOT beginners! and know how to speed up while getting the most out of the pose or know how to alternate what they want without skipping too much of a beat. There is that ""yoga gentle feel""; the background, colors, her voice, and the music which does its part in creating a relaxed peace. Although I think downward dog is overdone, I like the poses combinations. I am familiar with the Rodney Yee yoga sessions so that her pose combinations add more variety for the while. What Susan Deason in this tape DOES OFFER for the NON-BEGINNER is the chance/challenge (by your own patience, observation, trial and error..she helps only in that she has presented the challenge) to learn to move yoga gracefully, vigourously, yet throughly.. not only necessary and downright triumphant in this case, but in general.",1104710400,,3775,4.324858757062147
1349601,3,B00004T6FK,"These yoga exercises are so fast moving that one would have to just watch the video 2 or 3 times to get a handle on what is going on before being able to do all the poses with any expertise. I also found the moves done so quickly that I wasn't able to get my mind at the level of serenity I enjoy when doing yoga.
Some of the poses are very difficult, and even Suzanne Deason looks a little wobbly in one of the ""Triangle"" variations, so you know it must be hard, because Deason is like a cross between stretchy elastic and strong iron.

There is a cautionary notice at the beginning that says ""not all exercises are suitable for everyone"", and that might include anyone with creaky knees, for doing the lunges for instance, and those little ""jump"" movements Deason does with ease.
If you are in marvelous condition, and like your yoga done in sequences that move like a rapidly flowing stream, you will like this tape, and I'm sure it will develop the strength and flexibility it claims to produce.
Beginners should not purchase this tape...it will be very discouraging, and there will be few poses that they will be able to do with confidence and competence.

I'm giving this a lower rating for being what I consider mislabeled; with my knees, I would never attempt yoga beyond the beginner level, and would not have bought this had it been labeled Intermediate, which it is, at the very least.
The scenery is marvelous, of a volcanic landscape of Maui, and the end of the tape includes ""modifications"" to make the poses easier, by using a block or strap to make the stretches less of a stretch, but I can't imagine how one would deal with the accessories considering the poses are done so quickly.",1103673600,5,1700,4.498381877022654
1349602,3,B00004T6FK,"For a beginner, there are some poses on here that I definitely could not hold.

I been doing yoga for 3 years and still cannot keep up with her fast pace.  Some postures are in the immediate poses and she does them fast!  I gave the CD to me yoga instructor - who has been doing yoga for 15 years and she like the CD!  I purchase it with the Living Art's Rodney Yee for abs and upper body.

1349605,5,B00004T6FK,"First of all, several reviewers have mentioned that this tape is not for beginners, but it is important to remember that ALL of the videos in the Living Arts series recommend that you start with ""Yoga Practice for Beginners"" if you are not familiar with yoga poses.  That being said, this is a relatively fast-paced tape that can be a little hard to follow at first, so I'd highly recommend watching the tape before attempting to follow along, especially since there are modifications at the end of the tape.
I consider myself a yoga beginner with limited flexibility, yet with modifications, I was able to perform all of the poses on this tape.  Some of the poses which require balance are pretty tough, but you can always support yourself if needed.  Although this tape focuses on lower body through mainly standing, kneeling, and seated forward bend poses, I feel it gives me a fairly good upper body workout as well given the many upward dog repetitions.
I appreciate Suzanne Deason's calm, supportive manner and her supple, yet not overly-unrealistic body.  Her style is warm and engaging, and there are no ""new-agey"" aspects to the video.  The scenery is attractive and soothing as well.  Overall, I really enjoy this video and love that I can do it in a short time frame.",1018224000,5,1278,4.760180995475113

Luckily, there are modifications for some of us beginners, and they do make the video a little easier.  This is a fun intense yoga.  I would suggest viewing the video before attempting to do it.  Do not get discourage by the fast pace.  After a few times you will be anticipating the movement and it will be easier!!  I love the video and I feel great when I am done.

1349608,5,B00004T6FK,"As a recent fan of the Living Yoga for Beginners series, I can't praise these tapes enough! I have instantly become a yoga addict with these tapes, and now, with Lower Body Yoga for Beginners, I can have the benefits of this age old exercise targeted at specific areas of the body. I always use this tape after my lower body workout, and the results continue to amaze me!
Yoga teacher Suzanne Deason (really, an amazing teacher with INCERDIBLE stamina!), takes you through a 4 minute warm up, a 14 minute active workout (ACTIVE being the operative word!), and finally a 2 minute deep relaxation. She performs the workout with remarkable control and strong, fluid movements on the crater of the Haleakala volcano on Maui - truely inspiring! The one great thing about these tapes is always the scenery!
Things about this tape I found to be slightly different from the other Living Yoga series I've seen so far:
- The pace is a little faster than I expected. You certainly work up a sweat performing these movements, but for whatever reason I seem to maintain a good level of relaxation and concentration.
- The modifications for beginners and those who are less flexible are at the END of the tape, as opposed to being demonstrated DURING the specific movements. It could pose a problem to those who are totally unfamiliar with possible yoga modifications, but once you see them they are pretty simple to remember.
- Although this tape is for the lower body, you need some pretty decent abdominal stregnth, balance (some of the moves involve balancing on one foot), and concentration. It's not something that will make the whole workout too challenging for a beginner, but it may not be for everyone. With time, however, these elements will become easier and just eventually end up a routine part of the workout. I would suggest to those a little discouraged by these elements to keep at it, once you get there the results are really quite amazing!
All in all this tape most definately provides results, and FAST! As always, Living Yoga suggests that you view the entire tape before getting down onto the yoga mat and working out. The pace of this tape, upon first viewing, may seem too challenging for most beginners, and I must admit that I too was intimidated upon watching it the first time. In fact I tossed it on my shelf for a few days, gathered up my courage, and THEN gave it a try. It's not HALF as intimidating as it looks, and although fast-paced, I manage to maintain a good level of relaxation and inner peace.
Over all, I would reccommend this to anyone interested in yoga, or anyone who wants to elaborate on their lower body workouts. Unlike the A.M. / P.M. series, which I would reccommend to just about everyone I know, this is more for someone a little more 'hard core on the yoga-train', or possibly someone who's into working out on a regular basis.",994377600,17,2869,4.649606299212598

I found it challenging, but that is the only way to really learn the poses and to get results.  After only two weeks of using this tape I was able to fit into clothes I wasn't able to wear previously.  I was able to tone and get rid of some cottage cheese on the backs of my legs!!  I wish she would stay in poses a bit longer, but as you do it more and more you become familiar and know what she will do next.  I use this tape for when I want a quickie yoga session and her weight loss video for a longer session.",988848000,7,651,3.785185185185185

I really enjoy it and although I am having to build back up to being able to fully keep up, its too fast and several poses are too advanced for a beginner.

7922345,2,B00004T6FK,"Count me in with the folks saying it's not for beginners. It's a fast paced vinyasa flow. And I'm not even a beginner, just not very flexible. But if you can't quickly do a step thru from down dog to lunge forget trying to keep up. There is no time to position yourself. When I really gave up was when she cued the jump forward from down dog into forward bend. Might be good for some folks, but it's not for beginners.",1434412800,,418,4.109756097560975
7922346,4,B00004T6FK,"I love this DVD for its combination of strength centered poses, stretching, and length (its quite short and very easy to do in the morning before work, or within the amount of time you try to decide whether or not to exercise). My only complaint is that each position could be maintained for just a few seconds longer. I can do that on my own, of course, but pausing the video/catching up is a pain. Most exercises can be done within the time she does them, but when doing many of the poses that require balance, matching her pace is difficult. Otherwise, I think this is a great investment of a few dollars.",1417392000,,608,4.389380530973451
