1688348,4,B0000639HI,"a sharp starring-role debut by susie porter and an unusual cinematic return by ""witness""' kelly mcgillis in this, certainly the first-ever lesbian film noir to be based on a detective story originally told in long-form poetry. porter's sleuth is as hard-bitten as bogart ever was, and director lang gives us plenty of luxuriously moody scenes of her aussie PI scrouging the enigmatic streets, seeking clues to the murder of a troubled co-ed. how does femme fatale mcgillis, playing an alluring bi-sexual professor, fit in? who cares? like porter's beloved car, this offbeat whodunit offers a fine ride.",1015718400,6,602,5.216494845360825
1688349,3,B0000639HI,"Jill (Susie Porter, to be seen in ""Episode II"") is a female PI, out-of-work  She gets a job to investigate the case about a missing college student Mickey, who was majoring in modern poetry.  As she has an interview with Mickey's instructor Diana, she immediately falls in with her, but while their relationships start, Mickey's dead body is found.  Now Jill faces a series of secret that lurk in the narrow society of  poets and intellectuals.
Samantha Lang's new film is, like her previous one ""Well,"" about the surpressed emotions among the people, but this time she takes up Dorothy Porter's cult book as her text.  On the surface, the film follows a murder case, but the director gives twists to the conventions of traditional film noir to create a unique private detective in Jill.  So, she is clad in black leather jacket; doesn't like living in a city; is a lesbian, and has a friend of Australian aboliginal people.  (I almost forgot to say it is shot in Australia.)  But, she has a conventional background also, like, she was a retired cop, had a bad memory in police work, and heartily dislikes her former co-worker and doesn't hesitate to show it before him.  I leave other details to your observations, but I believe you understand the basic point of the film.  Those who have read Sara Paretsky, Sue Grafton, or Val McDermid (the last especially) might be interested.
As far as these elements go, ""The Monkey's Mask"" is very interesting.  It cleverly subverts some rules of the crime novels, and it is certain that Jill is convincingly realized thanks to Porter's good performance.  However, the poetry part of the film leaves much to be desired.  Though I agree poems and words could be potentially dangerous, the film's way of treating poetry is, to me, too incredible and preposterous.  But the most incredible thing is the awfulness of the poetry Mickey recites before video camera.  I am not an expert of poetry, but that those words are praised is just ...  unbelievable.  No Plath nor Dickinson.  (Sorry I can't cite them for obvious reasons.)
Moreover, the film's murder mystery is not a difficult one to solve; well, that's not the problem, but the conclusion is too bland, and Jill uses a too familiar way of solving the case.  Those things, besides too much nudity, detract the film's original merits of establishing a new type of detective and diminishes the issue of sexuality it tries to deal with.  Maybe I'm mistaken, but I watched it twice, so I hope I am right in pointing out these matters.  The film, in conclusion, has very intriguing setting, but overall too confused.
I may sound disappointed, and I really was, but that shouldn't mislead you to think that it is a total mess.  Its artificial  production is memorable, and probably it makes you think.  ""The Monkey's Mask"" is worthy of our attention, but perhaps should be better with a different script or direction.
The title ""The Monkey's Mask"" comes from Japanese haiku poet Basho Matsuo's haiku (traditional Japanese-style short poetry), written in 1693.  Wearing a mask cannot hide monkey's (or our)nature.",1014076800,25,3099,4.834914611005693

The story revolves around finding where and if the girl was murdered. Kelly McGillis was so unattractive that I couldn't concentrate on the story.  I'm straight, so I might have spent too much time thinking why the dectective, Susie Porter was attracted to Kelly McGillis and it could have ruined the film for me, but I came away wishing I had not wasted time on the film.

This highly predictable lesbian thriller doesn't really pull off the excitement factor viewers usually look for in a thriller.

Mind you, it was free for me, since I have an Amazon Prime account, but even so, I couldn't finish it. First, the dialog is cringe-worthy. I can't remember when I've heard worse. Secondly, this is a murder mystery, and I don't really care who killed the girl who wrote the bad poetry. The detective, although a lesbian, is a caricature. She and McGillis get naked together, and we get to see lesbian bed death in action. Seriously. There is no chemistry whatsoever. Nothing. Yawn.

The film simply does not get going, for a suspense thriller you need well, suspense!  The characters are just so dull you get the impression even the actresses are bored and are just praying for the director to say ""Cut"" so then can go home.  The film just drifts along at a walking pace and no sorry, just because the main characters are lesbian is not going to convince me the film is any good.

The movie drags on and doesn't seem to have any real suspense and doesn't have any action.,1203120000,2,247,4.276595744680851
1688488,4,B0000639HI,"I'm in the photo and film field and I love the way this movie is shot.  The way it's filmed is just so beautiful and sexy.  The main char's are all charming, beautiful, and clever, with a great deal of verity and depth.  The plot is fast paced and hot, full of twist and turns, and you never figure anything out until the last second.  This is one of my favorite rainy day movies and any movie you can watch again and again is a great movie.  Love this film and the fact that the main character is sexy ten times over doesn't hurt at all.  Great film!!!",1192060800,10,553,4.074074074074074
1688489,4,B0000639HI,"I am not a huge fan of erotica and probably never will be. Still I have to admit if I ever become a convert this would probably be the culprit. Susie Porter's erotically charged performance is enough to make any man stand to attention. It is quite uncanny. The poetry is nothing ""life threatning"" but the performances are good and the plot is not hopeless. Great score by sling gun theory.

I recommend it.",1155081600,10,406,4.486486486486487
1688490,4,B0000639HI,"There is definitely a detective suspense thriller within the elements found in The Monkey's Mask. The development of the detective's character - the realistic portrayal of a discontent woman often sidetracked from her goal - maintains an interesting path. The appearance of Kelly McGillis, holding on to a solid cinematic presence, is a familiar and interesting addition to the cast. Several heated scenes delve more deeply into the detective's life, but they don't jump too far from the film's theme, so they're not as gratuitous as many viewers may think. Awkward moments are intended occasionally and are truly awkward. It's an odd film, but interesting viewing.",1147132800,23,665,5.283018867924528
1688491,4,B0000639HI,"If you like mystery's with a twist, this movie is pretty good.

If you are offended easily by certain subjects, language, or sexual situations, I would not recommend this movie as it is quite graphic and vulgar.",1142553600,12,211,4.702702702702703
1688492,3,B0000639HI,"Based on the book by Dorothy Porter, THE MONKEY'S MASK is a watchable but also rather pretentious ""erotic"" mystery.
When a literature student Mickey (Abbie Cornish) goes missing, the girl's parents hire lesbian PI Jill Fitpatrick (Susie Porter- I'm not sure if she's any relation to the author) to try and locate their daughter. The only evidence of her last appearance is a videotape of Mickey reading a sexually explicit feminist poem, which will offend prudes, but which personally I found quite amusing. They're just words, after all.
To try and piece together the clues as to Mickey's whereabouts Jill interviews the girl's lecturer Diana (Kelly McGillis) who has actually been encouraging her students to write like that. I wish my teachers had been that cool. Pretty soon Diana becomes the prime suspect. However Jill finds herself attracted to Diana; who is a straight married woman, and soon the pair begin an elicit affair which puts the whole case in jeopardy.
This Australian film is a bit pretentious, as with a lot of ""art"" movies, but THE MONKEY'S MASK does manage to keep viewers watching with its plot twists and tricky camerawork. It gets a few demerit points for the amount of awful poetry in the film, but on the plus side there are numerous lesbian scenes between McGillis and Porter. DVD extras include a short film by the movie's director, Samantha Lang, a Dorothy Porter interview and a reading from the book (which I found boring), as well as cast and crew bios and samples of songs from the movie's soundtrack.
THE MONKEY'S MASK is a good movie, but personally I found the poetry irritating. But that's just me, so if you enjoy and appreciate poetry, you'll probably raise my rating by 1 star. I'm just an uncultured chump anyway.",1052006400,54,1756,4.837209302325581

 I enjoyed Susan Porter and Kelly McGillis' chemistry, they have some sizzling scenes on here...I am in agreement that Porter is what makes the movie so interesting...she's a great talent.
 Definately worth renting, and I'm not sorry I bought the DVD.",1018569600,11,514,4.829545454545454
