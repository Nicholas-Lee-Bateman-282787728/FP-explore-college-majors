8248268,2,B0012YOOC8,"This video could have been spectacular because those areas that were visited have spectacular scenery, but instead what should have been left on the ""editing room floor"" such as nonsensical digressions and musical vignettes, took the place of what could have been more information about and shots of scenery from a motorcycle trip that many people would like to make.

Owning a motorcycle touring business and having made numerous video and travel-log presentations, I do not make these comments off-the-cuff.  People are interested in where you went and what there was to see. They enjoy concise and interesting information. My experience with this genre has been that people are not the least interested in shots and activities not related to motorcycling and the places visited.

This video could have been great because what was on-point was good, but the video was not. On the other hand, if you are looking for something folksy with lots of shots of the producer or want a tidbit or two of valuable information about the Haul Road/Dalton Hwy and the Taylor Hwy/Top of the World Road, this video may be of interest.",1388880000,,1120,4.946808510638298
8248269,5,B0012YOOC8,"Gary Smith has given us an inspiring video account of his trip from the Prudhoe Bay region of Alaska down through the Yukon and BC, across the continent to Quebec and then the Trans-Labrador Highway. He travels solo in a Ural sidecar rig.  In addition to great road footage, Gary includes entertaining interviews with many of the folks he meets along the way.  The soundtrack includes a good variety of excellent blues tunes, too.  I've watched my copy a number of times, and I like it a lot.  It's a great video, but I wish there were more footage of the Trans-Labrador Highway, as I'd like someday to ride that route myself.",1291507200,,626,4.5625
