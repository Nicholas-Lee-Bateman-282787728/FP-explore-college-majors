6963536,5,B00S7AS0J8,"Being a parent sucks.

I don't even know if there are words that can fully explain all the meanings in that statement I just made, but really, it truly sucks.  Its the hardest, most heartbreaking, completely emotionally obliterating thing that anyone can go through, but the biggest reason it sucks is the fact that you asked for it.  You wake up every single day asking for more because the moment those kids are no longer in your life is the moment you justdie.

Mommy tells the story of Die, or Diane, a single mother (her husband died three years ago) who loves her son, Steve, deeply.  She is foul-mouthed trailer-trash with a biting temper and a lack of a filter of any kind, but she loves her son, despite his flaws.  You see, Steve has problems.  When Mommy starts, we are informed that Steve is being kicked out of a detention center for setting the cafeteria on fire, brutally injuring another inmate.  Steve has ADHD, but a very severe kind that leads to extremely violent and uncontrollable outbursts.  When we meet Steve, he shows no signs of remorse for his actions, which sent another kid to the hospital with possible third-degree burns.  Instead, he cursing at and physically assaulting the guards.  When he leaves with his mother by his side, its apparently he views her more like a chum, a pal, than an authority figure.  Hes joking with her and cursing at her and despite the nature of their relationship, all you see is love.  She loves him, deeply, and he loves her, deeply.  They just have a non-traditional way of showing it.

Then something happens that changes the fabric of the film we think were watching.  Steve comes home baring gifts for his mother, and his mother is immediately skeptical as to how he attained those gifts, and after accusing him of stealing, Steve loses it.  Within seconds we see all the glee and jovial charisma that brushed Steves face upon handing his mother her new necklace fade away to expose a intense defensiveness that explodes in the form of brute force and complete domination over his mother.  He beckons her to hit him.  He hits himself, thrusting his body towards her, transforming into an animal, screaming at her and practically chasing her through the house, threatening her with physical violence.

In this moment, we understand Dies life, and we understand more fully her love.

Mommy is a hard film to watch, at least for me it was.  I feel like a broken record when I say this, because I know that Ive mentioned this a few times, but being a parent changes the way that you look at things, the way you feel things.  You look at things from the perspective of a parent and you can feel internally every emotion, every feeling that that parent is bound to be going through.  It doesnt hurt that Anne Dorval delivers a tremendous performance as the conflicted Die, but regardless of her strength in conveying those feelings, as a parent we watch and develop our own.  Watching Die observe her son was one of the most heartbreaking cinematic moments for me in quite some time.  The way that she so earnestly desires for nothing but Steves happiness, the way she selflessly gives of herself and sacrifices her own wellbeing is so reaching, so captivating.  Shes a pill, and she parents in a way that many will find questionable or even distasteful and yet no one can tell you how to love your child, you just do, and in your own way, and in the way that you, as a parent, feel is best for that child.  No parent wishes for a child with special needs, whatever those needs turn out to be, but it happens, and you can either coil back in fear or you can meet those needs head on, and while Die may seem, to the critical observer, to be irresponsible, she knows her son and she is doing her very best, believe me.

There is a moment when Die explains a parents love to her son.  She tells him that a parent never wakes up one day not loving their child.  She tells him that it is the other way around; that the child will start to love the parent less and less, but that a parents love only grows.

When she said those words, my heart broke.

Mommy illustrates beautifully the harsh reality of coming to terms with the real needs of a child and not merely what you want them to need.  As Die strives to be everything Steve needs, to mend his every wound, to fight his every battle, she eventually has to come face to face with the fact that she cannot do this alone, and even as she receives help and even a sense of balance and stability from an unlikely friendship with her neighbor, Kyla (another beautifully woven example of a mother trying her hardest to be what she needs to be), the writing is on the wall from the moment we adjust to the aspect ratio; this is a war Die cant win.

As Dies worldview expands, her innermost desires for her life, for her son, start to blossom in her mind, her crushing reality flitters away and her heart is full and, as an audience, we become a part of her dream world where everything is right, where everything is as every parent wishes it would be; and then she comes to her senses and everything is stripped away from her and a part of you, as a sharer in her journey, dies.

I don't want to paint Mommy as a soul crushing experience, even though a part of my soul has been literally crushed, because the ending note to Mommy is one of such remarkably exposed and understood parental love that it is almost, as Die puts it herself, hopeful.  As Steves actions place him at risk of hurting himself (notice how Die never contemplates drastic measures when the only person at risk was herself), Die makes decisions that conflict with her own personal wants.  She has to learn to let go, and in the process she has to believe that here is hope, that her son will one day find the freedom, not mere physical freedom but emotional freedom, that he so richly deserves.  She has to believe that her choices are giving him the best possible chance at a healthy, productive and happy future, no matter how much pain he, and she, are going through at the present moment.

She has to have hope, as does every parent, hope that they are doing the right thing.

Any true great depiction of an artistic portrait of real life needs to have every facet working in harmony in order to achieve that overall sense of true, brutal honesty.  Xavier Dolan is fortunate that he had an incredible team working under his wing, giving him exactly what he needed to make this portrait perfect.  His actors, all of them, deliver such richly layered performances, especially his two leads.  Dorvals exploration of a mothers love is so heartbreakingly honest and grounded.  There are moments where she is just watching Steve, watching him interact with Kyla, watching him exude this happiness, and we see this undeniable calm rush over her face.  She finds a moment of peace in knowing that he is, for the moment, happy.  That is what its like to be a parent.  I know that feeling so well.  Clement is remarkable here as well, finding so many nuances within the fabric of Kaylas situation.  We are never given the whole backstory for Kyla, but in the bits and pieces we gather from the details that Dolan puts into place and the layers Clement finds in every single breath she takes we are given a story that feels whole, feels complete.

But, for me, the performance of this film belongs to Antoine-Olivier Pilon.  At just seventeen years old, Pilon delivers the most complex, organic, moving and brutally honest character portrait of the decade.  This was such a difficult performance to pull off, one that really needed the right touches to steer it clear of a gimmick, and Pilon found all of these.  He makes everything feel so grounded in this sense of absolute reality that you feel his every tonal shift.  Hes so natural.  His furious rages, his tactless cackling, his moody pouting, his reckless abandon, his overt happiness, his repressed emotions, his fear, his pain, his overflowing love; NAIL ON EVERY HEAD!  There is one moment in particular, when his obnoxious and overbearing behavior becomes too much for Kyla to take and she pounces on him, berates him, controls him.  When we see him, a puddle of tears on the floor, urine staining his pants, fear induced anger and gutted sadness dripping from his face, we are torn apart.  I physically reacted to this moment, my stomach contracting I was in so much distress over the reality of his situation, his daily struggle.

But its not just about the performances, for Dolan and his technical team deliver tremendously as well.  From the beautiful score from Noia (which is used in one of the most stunning ways possible during the aforementioned fantasy scene) to the intentional cinematography from Andre Turpin, Mommy is a stunning film from start to finish.  The decision to restrict the audiences view of everything through the use of a boxed in format makes itself such a spectacular facet of the film, and the moment it becomes clear as to WHY its there is a moment that will take your breath away.

Xavier Dolan is a name that I have championed a lot.  I was nothing but gushing praise the minute I saw Laurence Anyways, a film that I feel is one of the greatest explorations of identity ever depicted on film.  Mommy, believe it or not, is an even greater film.  The maturity that Dolan expresses here as a filmmaker is remarkable.  He has been accused of lavishly beating a point to death with his visual cues and extreme symbolism.  I have never really taken issue with this (although I found it distracting in his debut film, I Killed My Mother), but I have understood to an extent the issue that was taken with it.  Mommy is a perfect example of a director with undeniable talent finding a way to weed through his every idea and intention to find a perfectly balanced way to express himself articulately to an audience without losing the very thing that makes him unique.  The rush of symbolism and visual expressiveness is there, but in a more contained and appropriate capacity and his ability to depict tones through his exploration of his characters is just uncanny.

The film takes on a life so fluidly connected to the state of his characters, and this is such an intentional and painfully moving asset to this brilliantly told story.  And, while some have criticized Dolans use of music within the film, I have to come to its defense.  Music is such an important medium for expression and emotional transference, and using it in such a specific and intentional way, like Dolan does here, is so rewarding.  The fact that these songs all carry the weight of meaning, both literal and figurative (they represent a time in Steves life when he was happy and free/the songs obviously play to the films themes in an intentionally obvious manner), adds to the impact of each scene, each moment.

Mommy is an eye-opener.  Its a film that proves the truth in that statement don't judge a book by its cover, because it forces us to see the reality of life outside of the one we live.  As humans, it is so easy for us to pass judgment on others, to look at anothers situation and think that we know more than we do.  We do it all the time.  Heck, even I do it.  You walk through the supermarket and you see a parent struggling with an unruly kid and you hear those words and you see those tears and you think to yourself what an awful parent or control your kid or what a brat and yet, you don't know what happens behind closed doors; you don't know their reality.  Films like Mommy help us to appreciate, just a little better, that which we don't know, and hope to never know.

So now comes the hard part, summing everything up.  How do you close out a review of a film that you feel so passionately about?  How can you justify the excessive amounts of hyperbole you just spewed all over the page?  Ive not been shy about my love for Dolans work and his career, and so my adoration of this film probably comes as no surprise.  I also think that Ive proven myself balanced with regards to his work, as Ive voiced concerns with some of his previous work (I gave I Killed My Mother a B- and Tom at the Farm a B+) so I know his every work isn't perfect.

Mommy is perfect.  It truly is.  Thats the best way that I can think of to sum this up.  Perfect.",1426982400,47,12295,4.505638249887235

Rating: 3.5 out of 5.0

""Mommy"" is Xavier Dolan's fifth feature and he's only 25 years old! Set in a suburb of Montreal, Dolan's ""dramedy"" is the tale of Diane ""Die"" Desprs (Anne Dorval) and her extremely hyperactive son, Steve (Antoine-Olivier Pilon), who suffers from ADHD. Dorval and Pilon are both brilliant in their complementary roles, playing off one another's inability to control their repressed anger.

Steve, of course, is far worse off than his mother--at the beginning of the film, Die is bringing him back home from a juvenile facility where he assaulted a youth and was basically incorrigible in relation to the staff. Die wants to give it another try with Steve but doesn't help things with her constant insulting outbursts. There's something almost comic in the way Steve talks to his mother, often calling her ""bitch"" and other sundry expletives.

For awhile (until the character wears out his welcome), Dolan's ""Steve"" is fascinating because you want to see how far he'll go in his social interactions outside the family. He knows how to ""push peoples' buttons"" and takes delight in setting people off. There's a great scene at the beginning of the film where Steve goes at it, insulting a black cab driver with a series of racist epithets, that leads to a harrowing confrontation. Later, Steve rips into his mother's ""date,"" a lawyer who lives across the street, accusing him of wanting to get into his ""mother's pants."" Die was counting on this man to help her with a lawsuit which was instituted as a result of Steve assaulting a kid at the aforementioned youth facility. Sure enough, the lawyer is completely alienated and curses both Die and Steve, right before walking out of their lives for good.

Also in the mix is the neighbor across the street, Kyla, a teacher on sabbatical, afflicted with a stuttering problem. She bonds with Die and helps Steve with his academic pursuits. Even Kyla is not immune to having her buttons pushed by Steve (she knocks him down to the floor after he provokes her). Interestingly enough, Kyla is the only person Steve seems to listen to. When Kyla tells Die that she's moving to Toronto with her husband and child at film's end, Die puts on an act that she's not upset. Only afterward do we see her break down as it's obvious the relationship mattered quite a great deal to her.

The Steve and ""Mommy"" show goes on a bit too long and the novelty of Steve's machinations, wears off. The fact that the film was shot in a 1:1 aspect ratio is also annoying, as the truncated square that appears on only part of the screen, makes us feel as if we're watching an old video from the 80s and early 90s. A couple of times Dolan expands to full screen, particularly in the fantasy sequence where Die imagines a much more optimistic fate for her son. But unfortunately that sequence also goes on for too long.

At the beginning of the film, title cards posit a future scenario where parents have the right to commit their children to psychiatric facilities without a court order. While Dolan makes clear where his sympathies lie, the fact is that he's tipping us off to what happens at the climax--Steve's institutionalization is a foregone conclusion. It might have been a better idea to dispense with those title cards!

There is no doubt that Mr. Dolan is a very talented writer and director. His ear for realistic dialogue and sophisticated characters is quite apparent. Nonetheless, sometimes too much of a good thing is not good at all. ""Mommy"" would have been much better had it been at least 30 minutes shorter. That said, go see ""Mommy"" because there are many good things in it that will impress the discerning film-goer.",1423785600,,3721,4.740340030911901
6963540,4,B00S7AS0J8,"""Mommy"" (2014 release from Canada; 128 min.) brings the story of an out of control teenage boy Steve (not quite 16 years old) and his free-spirited mom Diane. As the movie opens, we are informed that this is a ""fictional Canada, where a new government comes into power in 2015, and it passes law S-14, which allows parents to commit their children to the state ward without legal review"". The movie then opens with Diane, in her car, getting hit by another driver, making her car inoperable. Turns out she is on her way to a youth detention center, where Steve, after setting a fire, has been ejected for good. Diane has no other choice but to take him in, and quasi-immediately, Steve and Diane start arguing over nothing and everything. Along the way, Diane makes the acquaintance of her neighbor across the street, a woman named Kyla, who is on extensive break from teaching and has suffered a speech disorder (stuttering). Diane, looking for a job, asks Kyla if she can watch Steve while she goes on a job interview. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is the latest movie from Canadian wunderkind writer-director Xavier Dolan, all of 24 or 25 years old when he made this film. This is his 4th or 5th film already, if you can believe it. Second, from having seeing the movie's trailer recently, I knew going in that the screen ration is a highly unusual 1:1, basically the movie is showing like a box on the theater screen (I'd say using at most half of the theater screen), and I was afraid that this would bother me. Turns out it didn't matter at all, and in fact that this only increased the tension of the movie. Speaking of which, I must emphasize that the violence and emotional and psychotic outbursts from Steve are very much ""in your face"". It is obvious that Steve suffers from many things, and one of the ways Steve copes is by screaming at the top of his lungs. You can just see the frustration and desperation building up in him. This movie of course made me think back of 2011's ""We Need To Talk Bout Kevin"", about another very troubled teenage boy, and it's quite interesting how different Kevin and Steve deal with their shattered emotions. Third, not enough kudos can be given to performances of Anne Dorval as the ""Mommy"" and perhaps even more revelatory, Antoine Olivier Pilon as Steve. Wow, just wow. Amazing all the way. (As a complete side note: check out their heavy Canadian-French blue collar dialect, which is almost entirely incomprehensible if you are used to the European French--I grew up in Belgium). Last but not least, there is a very nice collection of songs in the movie. Sarah McLachlan's Building A Mystery plays at the very beginning, and we also get Dido's White Flag early on. Celine Dion's On Ne Change Pas (roughly translated as ""People Don't Change"") plays at a pivotal moment in the movie. Oasis, Counting Crows, Simple Plan and others fill out the musical roster.

""Mommy"" opened this past weekend at my local art house theater here in Cincinnati, and I finally had a chance to go see it tonight. The early evening screening was not super-well attended, although frankly better than I had expected. This is not a 'feel good' movie from which you walk out of the theater thinking 'that was a jolly good time!'. Instead you get a powerful movie examining a troubled youth and his relationship with his also troublesome (but in a very different way) mom, and how they are trying to keep their heads above water in today's society. There are ample reasons why ""Mommy"" won the Grand Jury Prize at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival. If you have an interest in foreign movies that are MILES away from your standard Hollywood fare, this one's for you. ""Mommy"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1423526400,2,3829,4.646017699115045

The movie was presented in the unusual 3:4 aspect possibly to convey the suffocating lives of the mother and her son.  Occasionally the screen would be widened to 1:85 aspect to again possibly representing the hopefulness.  The acting was very good in general, although the woman lived across the street fared better than the mother.  Probably it was due to the script, which did not fully rendered the woman's character consistently.  The film clocked in 2 hr 20 mins.  It is this viewer's opinion that at least 30 mins should be trimmed and discarded, especially the 'dream' sequence of the kid's growing up with getting married and the mother sending away her son.  If the future 'director's cut' can trim off some of the latter sequences, to say 1 hr 30-40 mins, it would be a much better film.",1468108800,,963,4.730538922155689

He is gritty and he is real and his actors give him all they have to do his movies. I thought that ""tom at the farm"" was disturbing. I loved that and I loved this movie too. French-Canadian film, yes, subtitles, about a Mom with a troubled child. she has him in some kind of juvy hall, they force him out and she has to take him back. He set a fire that hurt someone. Mostly a 3 person story and those 3 persons are Wonderful. Anne Dorval as Mommy (Die or Diane) Suzanne Clement as the neighbor who tutors and tries to help and the outstanding Antoine Olivier Pilon as Steve the problem son, he is amazing. You feel for all of the people involved and who are trying to make a life against all odds. Keep in mind this is Canada and they have laws that we don't have.",1440115200,10,875,4.214285714285714

6963584,4,B00S7AS0J8,"Intense, explosive emotionally, the central relationship of mother and son is locked within the 1to1 framing of Instagrams box of oedipal tension. Mommy, Xavier Dolans 5th feature at the tender age of 25, gives strong roles to women, Diane/Die (Anne Dorval)and Kyla(Suzanne Clement), both actresses who have worked for Dolan before. The central role,Steve, played by Antoine Olivier Pilon, has been ejected from a correctional facility for starting a fire,sent home to live with mother, Die, a feisty, uneducated,working class widowed single parent. The story is set in a fictional Canada that has passed a controversial new law allowing parents to abandon their behaviourally disturbed children. Steve has ADHD.The boy and mother shut in on themselves are locked in endless battles,which are hair-raisingly close to violence. The tight framing emphasises the twos rows,encounters,pouting duels. This situation is lightened by the entry of a neighbour, Kyla, from across the street,who becomes the Apollonian pole to their Dionysian frenzy. An ex-teacher for Steves age group, she volunteers to help bring his home-based education up to scratch. She is reserved and stutters, as she is a lonely housewive,whos aloof husband is away working on computers a lot. Kyla befriends Diane and they start to find new ways to cope that benefit all 3, so they become a family group, who enjoy each others company and have fun together. Theres an affecting scene where they all move along a suburban street,the women on bikes and Steve on a skateboard. Then with a beatific smile on his face, he stretches his arms wide, and pulls the frame open into a sun-splashed wide-screen. This presages a future projection of the life Die would love to have with a husband , a son grown mature and with his own partner. Then it snaps back into a narrow screen,telling us the harsher truth .

Dolan depicts unlikeable characters with great empathy. Die has to pour all her energy and life, no job,unable to get a partner, into the vortex of her sons unsocial condition. The film is superbly aided by pop music choices-Oasis,Celine Dion and Counting Crows. Husbands and men generally fare badly and come off coldly. This is a beautifully rendered story of a disadvantaged woman struggling to cope with a mentally ill teenager. The rage of entrapment captures the underlying mood and Dolan depicts a younger generations zeitgeist very well. This film was paired winner with Goodbye to Language at 2014 Cannes for the Jury prize. Loved this film. Joyful, combustive, energising.",1439078400,,2552,5.134615384615385

6963586,5,B00S7AS0J8,"Xavier Dolan never fails to surprise and entertain and this he continues in this his latest film. He takes as his subject Diane (Die) Desprs and her teenage son Steve. She has been widowed and her son has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This got worse after his father's death and he became institutionalised. He has now set the canteen afire and injured another boy in the process - so they are kicking him out and that means worse detention or his mother has to look after him.

She takes him home and starts the journey of rebuilding their relationship, home schooling and trying to make money. To say any more might spoil the plot and this is a plot worth savouring. It is filmed in 1:1 aspect ratio (very narrow) which makes the film at first annoying and then very claustrophobic. This may have been done to exemplify how focussed or tunnel visioned an ADHD sufferer can be - but I am guessing. It does go widescreen at one point though.

The performances are just excellent and this won the Jury Prize at Cannes and it is easy to see why. Anne Dorval (`Heartbeats' and `I Killed my Mother also Dolan films) as `Die' is brilliant and Antoine Olivier- Pilon (`Indochine - College Boy') as Steve has nailed the mood swings and tantrums that are often part of the condition and gives a performance that sparkles with warmth and vibrates with emotion.

Now this is a story of three people - more or less - and it is not until the end that you realise just how stunning this film is. This is in French with some English - mostly of the profane variety and runs to just over two hours. Those will be two hours well worth spending and if the narrow aspect annoys at first - as it did me - I would say just stick with it and you will be rewarded with a genuinely moving and original film.",1437868800,8,1803,4.408408408408408

6963595,2,B00S7AS0J8,"The film, announced with so much pomp and enthusiasm, especially in the Canadian and French media, is very disappointing. Although the director put in it all the fire of his young heart, that is not enough-- the result is poor and fragile, notwithstanding the tension. Mr. Dolan simply needs to grow. And learn.

Spurned by the hype, I (naively) bought the DVD... I want my money back! Whats worse is that a few hours of my life are lost.

Here are the major issues re content and form that I identified after a first (and last) viewing:

1. The hard and categorical realism that the script is supposed to contain is contradicted from the outset by a cheap artifice that the author did not really need to use. Why situate events in the near future, where a special law would allow parents to get rid of the children out of control? The decision of the mother would hold in todays real world.

2. As for the characters consistency, the mother is really poorly conceived and rendered: a women in her forties behaving like a teenager, lingered improbable breakouts of responsibility and maturity. This is the most non-believable character, also because the least explored. A contradictory caricature as some of Eschers impossible images.

3. As for the acting, way too much ham acting (the actress who plays the mothers part could have made a decent effort to act) and laissez-faire (Kyla is soft, amorphous, without seam and without substance). The young actor playing the son should also have worked his facial and body expressions, not only his lines. There is a permanent contradiction between his face (i.e., complete lack of expression) and what he says.

4. The form leaves much to be desired with this square frame the director inflicts on us, blurred images and visual tricks in excess (the day dream sequence is a good idea, but so poorly done), the superimposed music and those cheesy songs of Celine Dion and Andrea Bocelli--what a lack of taste!. Even the funny language becomes tiring, as too much of it becomes abuse. Same for the shouting matches, too long and too many of them.

Jean-Pierre Melville used to watch 4 to 5 movies a day, every day. This was part of his duty, his trade, his directorial work. Thus he was able to create masterpieces like The Samurai, The Red Circle or A Cop, becoming a key model for Godard and Truffaut, Scorsese and Tarantino. If we think that Melville was doing this in the 1960s, it becomes clear that Mr. Dolan has much to watch as of 2015... Without a solid film culture, the most gifted talents cannot build anything. Not to mention that the likes of Mozart and Rimbaud are very very rare. So rare, that it is really important not to think of oneself as being one.

The most amazing thing in all this is the surprise of some that Mommy was not nominated for an Oscar. Seriously?!",1431302400,3,2830,4.657314629258517

Sadly, if your ear is not accustomed to the intonation and machine gun output of basilectal Qubecois, you will miss much of the nuance as the english subtitles are at best an approximation of what is being said.

Isn't it a melodrama about a dysfunctional family? Not exactly, it's a roller coaster of emotions, beautifully shot, just like Xavier Dolan knows how to do it.

The acting is superb and all three main characters shine in the film: Diana, Steve and Kyla. However, I'm baffled as to why Kyla's back story is never revealed, this is why I am not giving the film 5 stars. She had a family and drama of her own going on, but why is it left out for us to understand her unusual behavior and family dynamics?

8697499,5,B00S7AS0J8,"This is an intense movie from start to finish.

The movie starts with Die bringing her ADHD and anger-plagued son Steve home from juvenile detention.  She is a single mom with a potty mouth of her own, always smoking and throwing come-backs to his comments.  Yet she will sacrifice for Steve. But barely back home and Steve freaks out and an intense fight ensues.  It is this fight that makes the viewer realize that Steve is very unpredictable.  What will set him off next?

Die meets her neighbor Kyla, a teacher on sabbatical who volunteers to help Steve with his homeschooling.  She has her own secrets. The two develop a trusting friendship.  Kyla and Die also develop a friendship that centers around Steve.  Steve shows improvement in his social skills, but he has difficulty trusting men around his mother.

Xavier Dolan filmed this movie in a 1:1 ratio, creating a square screen.  This is offputting at first, but the psychological suspense is so intense all throughout this movie that one soon doesn't notice the format.  Die, Steve and Kyla and others are all performed by stellar actors. Bravo for showing mental illness in a humane manner.  If there is a flaw, it's that some scenes are needlessly long.

8697500,4,B00S7AS0J8,"The only Dolan film I had seen previously to this was Tom At The Farm which I preferred over this. For as good as the acting and film making was, Mommy just didn't draw me in the same way and never felt truly invested in the characters. I love Dolan's use of slow motion and music which creates some interesting breaks but at the end of the day there just isn't enough depth to the characters and the story seems kind of superficial though I cannot really point to why. Tom at The Farm had a mood and feeling to it that Mommy failed to capture. Throughout Tom I was continually questioning character motives and choices but not with Mommy. This is not a review for Tom however that film set my expectations for this one I will continue to dive into Dolan's films despite being slightly disappointed with this one.

The aspect ratio that was used most of the film for some reason didn't impact me. I didn't feel trapped or closed in like it is apparently supposed to convey but kept questioning whether the format was intentional or not. I realized it was intentional when the format changed to a standard version for a short segment of the film then returned to it's original version. That tool had no impact on my experience other than noticing it which is something that took my attention away from the story.

Overall it is a good movie with some highlights that draw true emotion however they seem few and far between. Sorry, not much of a reviewer but thought I would post my impressions.",1501027200,,1493,4.465201465201465
