3003289,4,B000XJD3GQ,"If you've watched any Tenchi Muyo anime then this will be fun to watch because it introduces new characters to the Tenchi universe.  Overall the storylines were ok and the ending was a little strange but hey this is Japanese anime.  The animation seemed to get a better toward the end of the series and others have made that same comment.  Yes, you do get to see Tenchi and the others in the series but they are basically not involved in the plot.  You really have to pay attention to all the Masaki Jurai family information they are supplying you at sporadic moments in each episode which will help when you watch the final season of Tenchi Muyo.  I got attached to the characters albeit they were a bit goofy and contrite but they provided a good laugh. I waited for a complete collection instead of purchasing single episodes which is way less money and that along with the overall content of Tenchi Muyo GXP warranted the 4 star rating.",1202515200,3,940,4.5058823529411764

Tenchi Muyo! GXP is easily my favorite so far. The story is exceptional, the characters are well developed, the humor is abundant, and the animation looks phenomenal. One of my favorite parts about this particular installment to the Tenchi series is that each episode has a purpose, there are no pointless filler episodes.

3003485,5,B000XJD3GQ,After how bad Tenchi In Tokyo was I was concern about the future of the Tenchi series but this renewed my faith in the Tenchi Universe.  Like having more of Tenchi grandmother from Tenchi Roy-oki series  in this series as well as a air head blond that remind me of Mishoshi but not positive if her not as I can can't seem to bring the character up in cast list I looked up on internet.  Was surprise when the main character of the series turn out to be a bad luck magnet guy name Seina since he looks so much like Tenchi himself in the box cover images.  The different Tenchi series always mention Galaxy Police it is nice to have a spin off series giving Tenchi fans what that part of the Tenchi  series is truly like.  I did have one problem with the series.  That being on the first disk when Senia meets his earth girl friend who knew him since childhood it is never explain what she's doing as a member of the galaxy police since before this Mishoshi and Kiyone were the only GP members on Earth. I know with name Masaki she related to Tenchi but there should of been more info given.  Unlike Seina who enters the academy she seems to of been a member for some time.  I was also strange having different pirate Ryoko in this series than the one living with Tenchi  The series has many great characters both human and alien looking and the series have new harem love nest for anyone getting board with Tenchi and the girls on earth.,1400457600,3,1436,4.265682656826568

3003490,4,B000XJD3GQ,"Right off I can say that one should not view this series before watching at least the original 13 episodes of the Tenchi Muyo:Ryo-Ohki OVA series.

This series is a humorous homage to the original series, while introducing new characters who appear in the later produced 3rd season of the OVA series.

Synopsis: Seina Yamada is cursed with bad luck.  That bad luck results in him being in the wrong place at the wrong time when a spaceshipcrash lands at his friend's house.  Mistaken for being in on the secret (that his friend and permanent house guests are involved with interstellar matters) he's handed a recruitment brochure for the Galaxy Police.  After being forced to sign it by his family (eager to be free of medical bills and damage liability claims) he's whisked away to outer space.  It's soon discovered that his bad luck tends to be extremely useful towards attracting Space Pirates.
This ability is quickly noticed by the leaders of the GP and the Juraian Empire; who put it to work in their favor.

Opinion: The plot does not have the serious overtones (minus a few scenes in a couple of episodes) that are common through the original series.  There is an overabundance of sight gags, a robot that acts as the director's stand-in (and resident pervert), and many over-the-top  plot twists that makes it clear that the series is not meant to be taken too seriously.  Directed by Shinichi Wantanabe (who's works have been banned in many countries), people familiar with his work will see a lot of familiar themes from his earlier works:  over-acting, over-used anime memes (mecha, hovercars, etc), super-hero fashion-sense (""No one saves the universe and looks this good doing it""), and weird live action filming in the credits.
Despite the Director's heavy hand in the style; the original work is treated respectfully and tries not to break the series canon, nor does it take extreme liberties with background material.

Summation: Fans of the ""harem"" anime genre will probably like this series, even though it's sometimes seems rushed through production (kind of like it was being written on the fly)",1390348800,,2117,4.915730337078652

3003515,1,B000XJD3GQ,"I actually bought an earlier box set of the series when it came out, so I paid much more for it than the price of this box set. But even at this very low price, I cannot reccomend the product. I like the Tenchi OAV (except the third series, which was really disappointing), which was one of my introductions to anim in the 90s.

First of all, unlike Tenchi series, this one cares only about humor. There is no drama, no action, nothing, just comedy. And what kind of comedy? The most puerile slapsticky dumb comedy you can find. Really bottom of the barrel here. And it's really hard to get into it, especially since all characters are one-note and paper thin, whose personalities can be described in one or two words. When the story gets old, they just throw in other paper thin one-note characters, trying to inject some more life into it. It doesn't work.

I remember trudging through the series, always hoping ""OK, up to now it's been bad, but it's got to get better in the next episode"" and it never did.

Really, skip it. If you're a Tenchi fan, just pretend it doesn't exist (hard when some characters show up in the OAV series, ugh!). If you're not a Tenchi fan, DON'T START WITH THIS ONE! If you want dumb comedy (nothing wrong with it if it's well done), buy Excel Saga instead, it does it much better.

Oh, I watched it subbed, so I can't say anything about the dub quality.",1378252800,2,1385,4.377431906614786

3003518,5,B000XJD3GQ,"So there I was... I fell in love with Tenchi Universe, and watched the entire series (multiple times). Then, I found my way to the original first 2 OVAs, and loved those too. It was a bit weird to realize that the Tenchi Muyo story basically has 3 different ""realities"". To put it simply for someone who may not know, the three timelines are: Tenchi Universe, the Tenchi OVAs, and Tenchi in Tokyo. All of them feature many of the same characters retold in different ways. I had heard about Tenchi Muyo GXP before, but I was wary of it. How could I enjoy something that didn't involve Tenchi, Ayeka, Ryoko, etc. directly? That's what I was wanting more of...
But I gave it a shot, and I was glad I did.
Tenchi Muyo GXP takes place according to the OVA storyline, during or after the events of the 3rd OVA series (Ryo Ohki).
Rather than focus on Tenchi, the series takes place with a friend of Tenchi. Seina Yamada, like Tenchi, is very innocent and good natured. As I watched the series, I remember thinking more than once about how much it felt like a Tenchi series to me...much more so than the 3rd OVA did. It had Tenchi Universe humor mixed in with OVA themes. Speaking of humor, it is extremely silly! If you don't like stupid humor, stay clear.
I thought it was hilarious overall, but I've heard some Tenchi fans say they consider it one of the worst in the series. That assessment surprises me, actually. But, I realize you can't please everyone! I grew to like the characters almost as much as in the original Tenchi series.
That being said, the downside for me was the episode that did feature Tenchi and the original gang. It wasn't a bad episode by any means, but if you're like me and used to the English dub work, the voice cast is the same as Ryo Okhi (the 3rd OVA). That means, much of it isn't the same cast as Tenchi Universe and the first 2 OVAs. That is a big downside for me, but, if you watch the subs I don't think you'll notice anyway.",1373155200,4,1957,4.320652173913044

GXP takes place almost entirely in space--only one episode is on Earth. If the blonde on the cover looks familiar, that is because she is Kiyone's Galaxy Police rival from Tenchi Universe. Is Mihoshi in the series? You'll have to find out for yourself!

Aside from being a total otaku for Tenchi,  I bought it because was I told it is the only way to make sense of Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Oh-Ki.

There is NB, a robot who apparently doesn't have the internet to get enough soft porn.  Then Seina Yamada, the local idiot relative of Tenchi's who is jinxed.  Then Mitoto Kuramitsu, spitting incarnation of Mihoshi, only more brain dead.  And of course you have multiple women who want Seina.  Yeah, yeah, been there, done that.

I know with name Masaki she related to Tenchi but there should of been more info given.  Unlike Seina who enters the academy she seems to of been a member for some time.

3237987,4,B000XJD3GQ,"Right off I can say that one should not view this series before watching at least the original 13 episodes of the Tenchi Muyo:Ryo-Ohki OVA series.

This series is a humorous homage to the original series, while introducing new characters who appear in the later produced 3rd season of the OVA series.

Synopsis: Seina Yamada is cursed with bad luck.  That bad luck results in him being in the wrong place at the wrong time when a spaceshipcrash lands at his friend's house.  Mistaken for being in on the secret (that his friend and permanent house guests are involved with interstellar matters) he's handed a recruitment brochure for the Galaxy Police.  After being forced to sign it by his family (eager to be free of medical bills and damage liability claims) he's whisked away to outer space.  It's soon discovered that his bad luck tends to be extremely useful towards attracting Space Pirates.
This ability is quickly noticed by the leaders of the GP and the Juraian Empire; who put it to work in their favor.

Opinion: The plot does not have the serious overtones (minus a few scenes in a couple of episodes) that are common through the original series.  There is an overabundance of sight gags, a robot that acts as the director's stand-in (and resident pervert), and many over-the-top  plot twists that makes it clear that the series is not meant to be taken too seriously.  Directed by Shinichi Wantanabe (who's works have been banned in many countries), people familiar with his work will see a lot of familiar themes from his earlier works:  over-acting, over-used anime memes (mecha, hovercars, etc), super-hero fashion-sense (""No one saves the universe and looks this good doing it""), and weird live action filming in the credits.
Despite the Director's heavy hand in the style; the original work is treated respectfully and tries not to break the series canon, nor does it take extreme liberties with background material.

Summation: Fans of the ""harem"" anime genre will probably like this series, even though it's sometimes seems rushed through production (kind of like it was being written on the fly)",1390348800,,2117,4.915730337078652

3238012,1,B000XJD3GQ,"I actually bought an earlier box set of the series when it came out, so I paid much more for it than the price of this box set. But even at this very low price, I cannot reccomend the product. I like the Tenchi OAV (except the third series, which was really disappointing), which was one of my introductions to anim in the 90s.

First of all, unlike Tenchi series, this one cares only about humor. There is no drama, no action, nothing, just comedy. And what kind of comedy? The most puerile slapsticky dumb comedy you can find. Really bottom of the barrel here. And it's really hard to get into it, especially since all characters are one-note and paper thin, whose personalities can be described in one or two words. When the story gets old, they just throw in other paper thin one-note characters, trying to inject some more life into it. It doesn't work.

I remember trudging through the series, always hoping ""OK, up to now it's been bad, but it's got to get better in the next episode"" and it never did.

Really, skip it. If you're a Tenchi fan, just pretend it doesn't exist (hard when some characters show up in the OAV series, ugh!). If you're not a Tenchi fan, DON'T START WITH THIS ONE! If you want dumb comedy (nothing wrong with it if it's well done), buy Excel Saga instead, it does it much better.

Oh, I watched it subbed, so I can't say anything about the dub quality.",1378252800,2,1385,4.377431906614786

3238015,5,B000XJD3GQ,"So there I was... I fell in love with Tenchi Universe, and watched the entire series (multiple times). Then, I found my way to the original first 2 OVAs, and loved those too. It was a bit weird to realize that the Tenchi Muyo story basically has 3 different ""realities"". To put it simply for someone who may not know, the three timelines are: Tenchi Universe, the Tenchi OVAs, and Tenchi in Tokyo. All of them feature many of the same characters retold in different ways. I had heard about Tenchi Muyo GXP before, but I was wary of it. How could I enjoy something that didn't involve Tenchi, Ayeka, Ryoko, etc. directly? That's what I was wanting more of...
But I gave it a shot, and I was glad I did.
Tenchi Muyo GXP takes place according to the OVA storyline, during or after the events of the 3rd OVA series (Ryo Ohki).
Rather than focus on Tenchi, the series takes place with a friend of Tenchi. Seina Yamada, like Tenchi, is very innocent and good natured. As I watched the series, I remember thinking more than once about how much it felt like a Tenchi series to me...much more so than the 3rd OVA did. It had Tenchi Universe humor mixed in with OVA themes. Speaking of humor, it is extremely silly! If you don't like stupid humor, stay clear.
I thought it was hilarious overall, but I've heard some Tenchi fans say they consider it one of the worst in the series. That assessment surprises me, actually. But, I realize you can't please everyone! I grew to like the characters almost as much as in the original Tenchi series.
That being said, the downside for me was the episode that did feature Tenchi and the original gang. It wasn't a bad episode by any means, but if you're like me and used to the English dub work, the voice cast is the same as Ryo Okhi (the 3rd OVA). That means, much of it isn't the same cast as Tenchi Universe and the first 2 OVAs. That is a big downside for me, but, if you watch the subs I don't think you'll notice anyway.",1373155200,4,1957,4.320652173913044

The space battles and escapades across the stars with his team of. . .women that all love him.  4 in any case, 5 counting his A.I.  All characters are memorable and can even match in the original Tenchi series.  The plot development that leads to the final episodes is interesting.

GXP takes place almost entirely in space--only one episode is on Earth. If the blonde on the cover looks familiar, that is because she is Kiyone's Galaxy Police rival from Tenchi Universe. Is Mihoshi in the series? You'll have to find out for yourself!

Aside from being a total otaku for Tenchi,  I bought it because was I told it is the only way to make sense of Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Oh-Ki.
