6191416,4,B00HNTIXK0,I went to see this movie when it came out. I thought it was pretty good way better then part 4. The ending had me in shock. Cant wait to see part 5. I have all of these movies on dvd and will be purchasing this one,1393977600,4,214,3.574468085106383
6191417,3,B00HNTIXK0,"This sequel contains some scary and startling scenes in different environment than the previous ones. Some scenes happen in the street. Another difference is this is the first time guns are used to shoot the possessed.

Like the previous four movies of Paranormal Activity, this picture's objective is just to scare the audience. It does not have any brain or character development.

According to boxofficemojo dot com, below are the financial figures of the film:

Production Budget: $5 million
Domestic:  $32,390,735
+ Foreign:  $53,900,000
= Worldwide:  $86,290,735

Worldwide, it took in more than 86 million dollars. That is 17 times more than its cost. It is a staggering amount. Still, it makes less than Paranormal Activity 4 which took in more than 142 million. At this rate of return on investment, I am sure the producer will make at least 4 more sequels.

If you agree to put your logic to sleep to be scared for a short while, this film is worth watching once.",1392076800,3,973,4.8545454545454545
6191418,5,B00HNTIXK0,"i only saw the first movie and this one,i'm not into these type of movies but a friend of mine talked me into seeing it,I LOVED IT,from start to ending,it was a great movie",1391990400,2,172,4.088235294117647
6191419,1,B00HNTIXK0,"This latest installment I found to be the least in the series. Kids graduate and start filming everything, attempting to show us Hispanics know nothing about filming. After Oscar kills Anna, and everyone seems to know this but the cops, our group of film makers break into her place so they can get their fingerprints at the crime scene and steal her book of demonic doorways. Later Jesse, talks to a Simon game, because Ouija boards are so passe. It seems the same possessed Chihuahua has bitten Jesse as Oscar. At some point in time they opt to tie the series all together by filming poorly lit scenes with people screaming and a camera going through a jerking motion, enough to cause inner ear sickness.

Oh yes, the acting sucked too. Sick a fork in it. It's done.

Parental Guide: F-bombs. Nudity?",1390089600,,802,4.640845070422535
6191420,3,B00HNTIXK0,"It's hard not to get cynical about the teenage-oriented reboot of these sorts of films, and the changes are perhaps a side effect of getting older -- I couldn't help but notice that ""Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones"" is pandering to a younger, urban audience.  Where the first few entries in the ""Paranormal Activity"" franchise played on the fears of a young couple and then on new parents, this fifth installment is all about the dangers of coming of age.

""Paranormal Activity"" began with a mysterious demon haunting a woman for no reason; ""Paranormal Activity 2"" extended that to a demonic cult dedicated to binding a demon to a first born child; the third installment was a flashback, but the fourth extended the conspiracy to a witch cult.  As you can see from the progression of the franchise, ""Paranormal Activity"" keeps upping the ante, and by ""The Marked Ones"" we now have evidence of a global conspiracy to raise an army of demonically-possessed children.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Suffice it to say that Jesse (Andrew Jacobs) hangs out with his buddy Hector (Jorge Diaz) after graduating, and in between smoking pot, hanging out with the hot ""only a friend"" Marisol (Gabrielle Walsh) and filming really stupid stunts, they stumble upon a witch conspiracy that involves a murder and their valedictorian classmate, Oscar (Carlos Pratts). Whereas the earlier films used innovative, creepy techniques that played to the found-footage genre, ""The Marked Ones"" is content just to use a single camera.  THE SPOILER ONES: The Ouija board of the first film is replaced with a malfunctioning electronic Simon game, and tension is created through staring at curtains (not once, but twice) and bodies falling from the ceiling (not once, but twice). Mostly, ""The Marked Ones"" comes up with a few tricks that are a pale imitation of the original, and then uses them over and over and hopes you don't notice.

What fans will notice is that ""The Marked Ones"" also wants to fill in the blanks of the other films.  The way it goes about this is heavy-handed, but then there are several plot holes that the script bulldozes right over, the most egregious being a magical door that lets you pop into any of the previous films.  This manages to rob the first film of some of its urgency when you see how it plays out, but if you're a fan of the franchise (and can remember what happened), there's ties to all of the films that have gone before.

And that's the thing. ""The Marked Ones"" isn't bad, it's just not nearly as scary as all those that have gone before. The ""Paranormal Activity"" franchise has set the bar so high that ""The Marked Ones"" can merely imitate them.  It cleans up after the other films by filling in their blanks, but the blanks are what made them scary in the first place.",1389571200,14,2797,4.734567901234568
6191421,1,B00HNTIXK0,"This was a horrible film.  I just watched it today and it was not terrifying whatsoever.  Nothing starts happening until toward the end of the film.  The thing that made me mad was the little immature teen boys running around playing pranks on each other.  That continues well in to the movie.  The only thing I liked about this movie was the fact that Katie Featherston was on the movie.  She is a babe!!!!!!!! I'd let her possess me any day ;) If you haven't wasted your money on this movie, keep it that way.  Stick with the first 4 movies.  They're way better and a lot more terrifying.  1 and 3 are the best!",1389571200,3,613,4.260869565217392
6191422,5,B00HNTIXK0,"As a PA movie, this one's the best installment  of the series by much. The change of setting breathes new life into the franchise, which almost died with the 4th one, the scares come frequently, it answers a lot of questions, and the ending was completely shocking and unexpected. This spinoff represents hope for the franchise to continue with the right step. Cannot wait for the 5th film coming in October!",1389225600,22,408,4.746478873239437
6191423,1,B00HNTIXK0,"Nine Things about ""Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones""

1. They aren't calling this ""Paranormal Activity 5"" because it's basically a spin-off, not a direct sequel. Although you won't completely understand this movie unless you've seen the others.

2. It's better than ""Paranormal Activity 4"". But that's not a compliment. Staring at the ceiling is better than ""Paranormal Activity 4"". This is still one of the worst movies of 2014. When a movie studio releases a movie two days AFTER the holidays, even they know it's crap.

3. This movie is different than the previous installments in that it's not set among rich white people. It's set among poor Latino people (the main character is an 18-year-old boy named Jesse). Other than that, it's basically the same crap.

4. It takes about 30 minutes for anything plot-worthy to happen. Before that, it's mostly a couple of teenage boys screwing around with a video camera. But after they break into a dead woman's apartment, Jesse comes out with a new invisible friend. The invisible friend talks to Jesse through the old Simon electronic game, and catches him in trust falls.

5. It is explained to us that when you turn 18, you are ready for Satan because 18 = 6*3. Which is clearly 666.

6. The first actual sense of supernatural danger happens about 50 minutes into the movie. The movie lasts 80 minutes. You do the math.

7. Since this is another ""found-footage"" style movie, it means that 70% of the movie is deathly boring, 10% is super predictable, 10% is a collection of random scenes that make no sense, and 10% is when the characters do something really stupid.

8. When something interesting does happen (like the dog scene), they always cut away before you know what happens. Then they restart the camera back at something boring.

9. The last minute of the film is actually sort of clever, and shows a little bit of creativity. If you remember the first movie, my advice is just to watch the last 60 seconds of this movie and call it good.",1389139200,10,2001,4.710601719197708

6191441,4,B00HNTIXK0,"Too scary but it was imaginative and interesting stuff like when they used an electronic toy instead of a board to talk to the other side and stuff like that. Even though these movies tell a very ugly story the writers and everyone else involved sure know how to keep me interested , in each of these movies so far the story seems to be complete at the end but at the same time they leave the possibility for an expansion ,that leaves me feeling very satisfied at the end because I am not frustrated wondering what happens to the characters or how the story ends but at the same time there's room for a sequel or prequel so if I hear about that movie I am going to want to see it because I am curious to see where parts of the story is going or coming from. Another reason I won't give this movie five stars other than it being too scary is SPOILER ALERT (the bad guys win) just like in parts 1,2,3and4 so I would have liked it better if it had a happy ending ,maybe in the next movie.",1464307200,2,985,4.082474226804123

Maybe it's because the idea of a couple of crazy dudes filming each other constantly is way more plausible than a family or a tortured couple documenting events that normal human beings would have run from faster than you could press a record button. I liked that the story came from a community very different than the other movies as well.

6191671,3,B00HNTIXK0,"This is Paranormal Activity 5. The decision to omit the 5 and give it a subtitle was a stupid one that not only causes confusion but basically ruins the consistency of the series. Not that it wasn't already stupid. Paranormal Activity shouldve ended after the first one. Making more has less to do with art than money and it shows. This is, in a lot of ways, the same story being told over and over again. Its a decent story usually; 2 is notably worse than the rest; but essentially the same nonetheless.

This time the camera focuses on a recent high school graduate named Jesse. His best friend Hector is the one with the camera and he seems to have it on constantly, as if he knows hes shooting a real movie. They also have a friend named Marisol. The three serve as amatuer investigators when spooky things start happening around Jesses apartment. It begins with the death of the weirdo downstairs neighbor. By the end, people are screaming and running for their lives as the camera shoots on.

Different in the fact that women were having their babies ""dedicated"" to the dark side BEFORE they were conceived, and NOT moving into a ""haunted"" house and being drawn in as the previous movies. I thought it was well done, the acting was primarily done by teens, with some adults thrown in to facilitate the plot. I didn't understand the ranting of a previous reviewer...seems they woke up grouchy before they watched this movie, but, I liked it!  Oh, by the way, Micah and Katie make a small appearance.

Rather you had been a avid fan of this series, or not, this film is amazing. As a found footage film I really enjoyed the characters and the interactions the characters had, the plot and story superb. In fact I will say this is the Marked of the the Paranormal Activity films, meaning the better. The film starts with a family celebrating the graduation of a young man named Jesse, and leads into a graduation party. The graduation party gives a great film for character development. Jesse the lead is amazing, at times convincing enough to believe this was real ofcourse it wasn't we know that. I cannot give this away any of it, I will just say it if you have not  seen it, pay no attention to reviews that are giving you all the character names, giving away the plot or comparing this film to the rest of The Paranormal activity films. This film is very creepy, if any of you guys had ever studied occult there is some real symbolic images and history involved with this film. Which is very scary when one sees this for what it is, I am not sure if as many will come to appreciate the film the way I may, yet to have reviewed many films for many years, and then have not set down to a very great found footage film this was refreshing and there is much here to keep you glued. If your an avid fan of super gore this film isn't in that genre, if you like a great plot superb acting, some reality that may be questionable you will enjoy.

6191749,2,B00HNTIXK0,"Now I personally found this film a bit boring. For nearly half of the film very little supernatural happens. It was like watching candid vid clips of ordinary peoples through daily humdrum affairs. Your basic dares, shenanigans, and trivial banter permeate the screen. I had to keep reminding myself to be patient and that this is a paranormal horror film. The paranormal finally kicks in on the film, at first having more similarities to Chronicles than evil spirits, utilizing the standard special effects tricks, however it soon gets into the normal groove of paranormal. The story is a strong concept that just seems to get cluttered with half hearted direction. One cool thing about the film was the casts ability to make the drama, banter and interaction on screen seem genuine. The dialog maintain a constant fluidity from start to finish. There is a mild sense of inability to sell the paranormal fright from a couple of the actors when the crap hits the fan but it is minimal and soon the cast is back in sync.

The effects and music score are standard, expectable tricks of the trade which keep The Marked Ones in pace with the original Paranormal Activity series. The atmosphere does get a little creepy but I never really felt any chills or thrills. The film really falls flat in the horror department. I cant remember any scene where I jumped, or cringed from the fright intended pieces to this film. Again the story is a nice, fresh spin that highlights a normalized slice of life in an area of society most people don't see. Plus I love me some bruja heritage highlighted in horror or film in general. Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones is a fail in my opinion but the audience that loved the original franchise will probably like this film as well. I do need to add that the concept of personalized, in-hand, video documentary style for this film does more to help the whole found footage subgenre than hurt it.",1432166400,,1929,4.707100591715976

In the previous films there were some well planned suspenseful moments and nice effects to make them worth sitting through till the end, but this was a bit agonizing.  The acting has always been sub par, but none worse that this time around.  The story and script should be embarrassing to the culture that was targeted in this unimpressive attempt.

Why have so many viewers revisited the series?  I assume it is the unanswered mysteries and strange occurrences that allow the viewers to gossip and discuss.  No unexplained events here.

THE MARKED ONES

I have enjoyed all of the films in this series but have found them all to be the same. That isn't a bad thing really since I liked them all but none have really stood out to me. I say that to say this, until now. When this was first released I was intrigued because it looked like it was something new. Sure it was filmed the same way but the whole Marked Ones thing sounded cool to me.

Two friends have just graduated from high school and are looking to have a good time. That is until a murder happens in their apartment complex. The woman murdered was said to be a witch and apparently she was killed by a former classmate of theirs. After looking a little too far into it things start to happen to them and around them. Its all fun and games at first but things start to get very real for the teens. Something is coming for them and wants one of them in particular.

The change of settings from the suburbs of the other films was a really cool thing and helped me relate as I lived in similar places as a youth. Also the whole Latin culture change was great as not only is half of my family and my lady Mexican but I have lived in Texas for most of my life. So all of that was real cool.

The story was familiar as it went along with the whole storyline of the series and was the found footage thing like the others, but it was also different. The acting was great with Jorge Diaz as the standout here. The whole film was creepy and funny at the same time which was what I enjoyed the most. The humor here throughout is great and there even some good scares, even if they are jump scares.

Honestly this is probably my favorite of the Paranormal Activity films from the first to the one before this one, this is the best. I could go back and watch them all in order again but I don't need to. Like I said before I have liked them all but this is the best in my opinion. If you haven't seen it I think you should, it is a fun flick.",1431302400,,1973,4.0487179487179485

I will give them that it was finally much faster paced and had a lot more scares and better special effects so I don't feel near as ripped off on my time as with the previous 3 installments. I was not on that bandwagon with the previous films, I found them to all be a bore and too slow paced to hold my attention until the next scare finally came along, if you could even call them scares.

In the Latino mix- the Paranormal Activity finds itself in Oxnard, CA, where Jesse ( Andrew Jacobs) and his friend Hector ( Jorge Diaz) get in to all kinds of mischief with a camcorder.
Christopher Landon does a good job tying Latino culture and their attitude towards occult and superstition in this film. Landon had also written the last three paranormal films so he does know how to to connect this film with the other paranormal films.
While the earlier films were focused on creepy things going on inside the house, the action in this film is more outdoors.

Jesse has, unbekownst to him, been being watched all his life and now that he's hit a certain line, something is reaching out for him, something which may be connected with the recent death of one of the residents of the apartment downstairs.  There have been in the previous movies instances where the people experiencing the incidents don't know how much danger they're in until it's too late: think of Micah's fascination with the unexplained in the first PA.  In this chapter, we have that situation played out only more so: Jesse, and to a lesser extent Marisol and Hector, are not only openly interested in the weird stuff that's going on, Jesse is actually welcoming of the entity.  And as he starts to change, becoming stronger, and it becomes clear that the entity won't allow him to be harmed, he gets deeper and deeper into the experience with this seemingly 'guardian angel' -like force.  It's his friends who start to perceive how sinister and dangerous this is becoming, and trying to drag Jesse, who's now chaging personality-wise as well, back from the brink.  But is it too late?

This movie commences shortly before Jesse's birthday, with him buying a digital recorder that ends up recording this movie, used by various characters.  Here's where 90% of the criticism of the most recent chapters of Paranormal come in: it could happen once, but how likely is it that this would be caught on camera every time?  One possible answer to that is given when one of the characters comes across the collected archives of a now deceased character, who's been gathering up newspaper clippings in various languages and internet files and everything else involving this type of supernatural activity - evidence of years of activity all around the world.  The simple answer could be that most of the time it isn't captured on film, but in today's security camera, smartphone cam, connected online world you actually may end up with multiple instances where this was filmed.

I think though that it may be something a little more though.  In movies like this it's not necessary - or even desirable, sometimes - to explain every detail; there are times when that approach robs a movie of its air of mystery and eerieness.  For example, I think Book Of Shadows: Blair Witch II tried too much to explain The Blair Witch Project.  I thought it was still an okay movie, but it was like seeing how the stage magician performs his tricks.  Book Of Shadows would have been stronger if it had ventured Some revelations or explanations, but left other parts obscured by the unknown.  I think that with Paranormal we've been getting clues and expansions but that the series, at its very conclusion, is going to have hit the right balance between revelation and mystery.  It may be time though (or past time, some would argue) to present some kind of clue or common element as to why so many of the individuals involved with the activity have been habitual camcorder users.  It wasn't an issue in the first three; each new movie offered hints as to how events may have actually influenced the previous movie's happenings.  With Part 4 and Marked Ones it's gone off beyond the original family, but continues to be recorded by new characters.  The moviemakers don't have to definitively explain it all out, but some kind of 'maybe's floated about would, I think, draw a number of viewers back in, while at the same time potentially giving the series a new dimension to explore.  For example, if it was put out there that MAYBE the entities themselves are subliminally influencing people to record and chronicle this, either on purpose or accidentally, that could work.  Or - and this might be tricky to work in as anything other than a hint - maybe a third party opposed to the entities and the coven is influencing the characters to record.  In all kinds of ancient legends and folklore and so on, there are things about being able to have some power over people or 'beings' if you can capture their image or sometimes their name.  It wouldn't have to be definatively established, just suggested, to be intriguing and effective.

To get back to the main focus of The Marked Ones though, it's taken the series's mythos and added on to it new dimensions without weakening everything that came before.  The whole series is among the high marks for found footage horror and among the most consistently riveting, watchable (and re-watchable) and just plain excellent movie cycles going.  Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones gets an A+",1424390400,,5131,4.825342465753424

6191877,4,B00HNTIXK0,"Truth moment?  I don't think I've ever seen any other film in the Paranormal Activity franchise.  I love horror and I am keen on the found footage genre, but nothing about the previous films jumped out at me as must-sees.  I saw this on Amazon Instant Video and decided to give it a chance.  I'm so glad I did.

Other reviews or Wikipedia can mention the plot.  What I liked best about the film was that it focused on an urban community of color that was believable rather than stereotypical.  It was also quite witty at times without being slapstick or corny.  I imagine if I was being tormented by ghost, demons, witches, or whatever, I'd have a sense of humor about it as well.

Like I said, I hadn't seen other films in the franchise and that did work against me at the end.  To be honest, I felt like I did when I watched the series finale of Newhart - I knew I *should* get the joke, but I didn't.  Well in The Marked Ones, I used some context clues to realize that what I was seeing tied into the previous films.

That said, I thought how they did it was brilliant and it makes me really want to see the earlier films now!  The only reason I don't give this film a perfect five stars is that there is an element of convenience in the last third of the movie... of course it's horror so it's not supposed to be realistic, but I did want it to be a little more logical.

But at the end of the day, this film was good and it was plenty scary throughout.",1422057600,,1457,4.120567375886525

The urban effect gave it a little better flow, and the pace was quicker.  I had some problems hearing the conversations clearly,which made me have to guess at what they were saying at times.  Typical paranormal stuff, flash appearances, loud nosies, and things that go bump in the night. This PA was clearly more demonic in nature, and steeped with witchcraft.  I'm not sure if that helped the story-line or not.  PA followers will probably feel the need to see it since it's hard to let a series go without taking a peak for yourself.

6191884,2,B00HNTIXK0,"Im not a fan of the Paranormal Activity movies. Dont get ahead of me- I don't hate them and automatically go into the movies with a negative attitude, but every single one Ive seen so far hasn't impressed me at all. They rely on two things: jump scares and the viewer KNOWING that somethings going to happen in a scene, looking all around for something to move or make a sound, only for nothing to happen for a while until it finally does. This has been every movie so far. There been very little that I liked about any of them, and it irritates me that were 5 movies in now, and were -still- doing the found footage thing. Whos finding this footage? Why cant these be shot like normal movies? Unfortunately, these movies don't cost much to make, so as soon as they pull in the big bucks on opening weekend, another sequel gets the green light and it continues. I don't know why, but I was hoping for a little more with Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones, just based on the fact that it didn't have a number in the title. Nope, this is pretty much Paranormal Activity 5: More of the Same.

The movie starts out at a high school graduation ceremony, and then quickly moves on to a big celebration with the main character, Jesse. Hes out with his family and friends, celebrating the graduation, and he soon takes a liking to the camera thats being used to document the happy occasion. Jesse goes to a pawn shop and gets his own camera, and starts recording the kind of stuff most kids his age do- dumb stunts and just everyday things, including his dopey friend Hector, a sign spinner for a local store. He also happens to have a crazy neighbor downstairs who plasters her windows with newspapers, and is known as la bruja (the witch) to everyone. No one visits her, and she keeps to herself. One day, another one of Jesses friends is spotted coming out of her home and takes off. The guys also hear strange screams and moaning coming from the room below, and find out whats going on after they tie some cords to the camera and put it down the air vents (yeah, I know). What they see is both weird and awesome for them- a naked woman getting weird symbols painted on her body. What exactly is going on here? Things get even weirder when the electronic game Simon stops working for Jesse, and instead starts answering yes or no questions with a green or red light.

Im going to get the things I liked out of the way first here, because its quicker to do. First, the filmmakers did a good job of showing how Mexican celebrations are. If you haven't been to a birthday party, gathering, quinceanera or anything, this is exactly what its like. It sounds like a weird thing to point out, but this was one of the few things I was impressed by. Next, and this is something I had as a pro in PA4 as well, some of the ladies in here were gorgeous. Stupid guy thing to bring up? Sure. Like I said, there wasn't much good regarding the movie itself. Special effects were standard for this series. However, there were a couple of cool parts involving dimensional travel and a dog on the ceiling that actually made me feel a little uncomfortable to see. And let me go ahead and save you some time- there is no post-credits scene to wait for.

The first thing that irritated me about this movie is that it could have worked so much better if it was shot like a normal horror movie. There is absolutely no reason for this one to be don't as a found footage movie, aside from the studio being hell-bent on making these all the same, and Im sure audiences would throw a fit if they got something that wasn't shot on security cameras or on someones handheld. To be fair, this one did have a lot more freedom than previous PA movies, since Jesse or Hector have the camera on them practically all the time. At the same time, its weird that they had it this much, including when potentially dangerous things were going on. Anyone looking for gore is going to be disappointed here, as theres barely any kind of graphic violence. A lot happens off-screen; this is probably the tamest PA yet, save for some nice/funny shotgun kills at one point.

Probably the worst thing about The Marked Ones though, is that its just plain boring. Its a long, long time before anything happens, and after that, you get to wait a while for the next jump scare. Again, this is very tame movie. Its amazing that it even got an R rating because it felt like the kind of thing aimed at teenagers who were still too young to get into R movies on their own. There is one other thing that really bugged me, and its just silly. Theres a scene later in the movie where someone is attacking a grocery store owner, and the owner swings a bat at the person. The swing is so weak that I said oh come on! out loud.

So whyd I even watch the movie in the first place? I guess Im just curious to see what this is all leading up to, and to see how inconsistent the story gets. It seems like they're making it up as they go along now. If you haven't seen any of the previous movies yet, this is one you jump into, although theres a lengthy section thats linked to previous entries. I only recommend this to fans of the series.

The story is more complex than in any of the other PA movies, and ties in the other films very effectively. I don't know why this was marketed just to Latinos.

the ending descends into a disappointing conclusion of formulaic mayhem and bad acting.

6191958,1,B00HNTIXK0,"I was tempted to give this film 2 stars simply because I enjoyed the characters in the film, Jesse and Hector are fun characters to follow and I really wish they had appeared in a better film. The movie is just such a slog to get through, I simply couldn't rate it above a single star.

Jesse graduates from high school and gets a GoPro camera (the filmmakers must've gotten a nice check from GoPro for as often as the brand is mentioned here), and he begins filming he and Hector's adventures around the neighborhood. We also learn that living in Jesse's apartment complex is a woman named Ana. Ana keeps all of her windows covered with newspaper, and rumor around the area is that she is some kind of witch. One night Ana is murdered, and it looks as though one of Jesse's classmates may have been the murderer. Jesse and Hector sneak into Ana's apartment to look around, and find odd things; strange books and a collection of VHS tapes including one marked with the names of the girls from the first couple of films. They get spooked by another intruder and run out, but when Jesse wakes up the next morning with a bite on his arm, and he begins to experience strange phenomena as he believe a spirit is following him.

The original film was a fun, sometimes creepy thriller, but the story was threadbare at best. This many sequels later, the formula is just played out, and stale. The ""found footage"" horror film is just a lazy way to shoot a movie with no budget, no F/X, and to provide cheap jump-at-you type scares.

6191984,1,B00HNTIXK0,"Don't believe the reviews that say if you loved the first ones, you'll love this one too. I LOVED the first Paranormal Activity. That movie freaked me out so much I was uneasy for days (and slept with the lights on!). PA 3 was almost as good, and while PA 2 & 4 weren't nearly as scary, they were still entertaining. Overall I've been a huge fan of the franchise.

Except for this one. This was a spinoff of the main franchise, but it spun in all the wrong directions. The main problem was that it was boring, predictable, and not at all scary.

**SPOILERS**

PA Marked Ones was also really vulgar. The first PA movie was pretty clean. Sure, they dropped a few f-bombs when they got scared (who wouldn't?), and it was rated R only for the language. But each new PA movie has gotten a little *more* R-rated as we went along. I wasn't bothered by it until now. PA Marked Ones is rated R for ""pervasive language, some violence, graphic nudity and some drug use."" Let me put it another way - I felt like I was watching an episode of that show ""Cops"" - only from the criminal's perspective. I wanted to watch an atmospheric, scary movie. Instead I got immature teenagers swearing constantly, partying (drinking & drug scenes), and drawing pictures of genitals on a kid's face - NOT the kind of scary movie I was looking for.

I also did not appreciate the dog being tortured. That was disturbing for all the wrong reasons.

The other big problem was that PA Marked Ones was a little offensive. I'm not sure what message the director was trying to send, but the entire movie felt like really bad racial profiling. PA 1-4 focuses on white families, so what do we get? Educated, upper-middle class people who live in beautiful houses in suburban neighborhoods. PA Marked Ones switches to a Latino family, so what do we get? Extended families living in apartments next to gang neighborhoods. I wasn't watching a movie - I was watching a bad stereotype.

If you loved the first PA movies - SKIP this one. I wish I had!!",1418342400,4,2009,4.460490463215259
6191985,5,B00HNTIXK0,"This movie helps to break up the tedious monotony of the ""main"" films.

In short: this story follows an 18 year old boy that discovers he is part of a larger demonic plot and succumbs to the evil that is his destiny.

I enjoyed the first 3 PAs. But by the end of the 3rd film i was starting to feel the fatigue of the series. Ooh, a door movies. Oooh, there was a gust of wind. And there will be a loud bang.........NOW. It is almost like a familiar song, you know when and what is going to happen. Again, i must repeat, i still like the first 3 films. The 4th film.... i was bored. Sorry, but i was. I felt that none of the acting was sincere and i wanted to shake the blonde chick and say ""please... please TRY TO ACT!""

but i digress...

unlike the ""ooh, stuff moves"" scares of the previous films, this film is much more of a ... typical demon themed horror movie with a little bit of mystery, covens, and witch stuff. Overall, it was able to breathe some new life (by using typical horror movie tropes) into a series that had become stale. What is interesting here is that this movie, given the expectations of the franchise, made old tropes seem new again. Pretty cool, huh?

6192005,5,B00HNTIXK0,"""Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones"" is pretty good. This is how the story goes: Jesse begins experiencing a number of disturbing and unexplainable things after the death of his neighbor. As he investigates, it isn't long before Jesse finds he's been marked for possession by a malevolent demonic entity, and it's only a matter of time before he is completely under its control...

The cast led by Andrew Jacobs (as Jesse) & Jorge Diaz (as Hector) is pretty good. The directing & story & screenplay by Christopher Landon is pretty good.

The cinematography by Gonzalo Amat is pretty good. The film editing by Gregory Plotkin (also co-produced) is pretty good. The casting by Carla Hool is pretty good. The production design by Nathan Amondson is pretty good. The art direction by William Budge is pretty good. The set decoration by Julie Ochipiniti & Teresa Visinare, set dressings by Scott Blakney, Don 'Tex' Clark, Eric Kagan, Martin Milligan & Catherine Pryor is pretty good. The costume design by Marylou Lim is pretty good. The special effects coordinated by Mark Gullesserian is pretty good. The visual effects coordinated by DeAndra Stone & supervised by Ryan Tudhope is pretty good. The stunts coordinated by Charles Croughwell & David Rowden is pretty good.

This is a decently, solid and well-crafted film that has its jumps and scares, at times. The feel of the film is much different from the first four films in the series is. This is also a sequel / spin-off that is better than the last Paranormal Activity was. Note: I have seen both the 84-minute R-Rated cut & the 101-minute Unrated cut, the review that I have written is for both cuts. I liked the Unrated cut a little more so with the additional beats adding some more meat to the film, so to speak.",1411776000,,1771,4.8

So we have the Paranormal Activity series with a Spanish flare this time, Jesse has graduated college and life seems to be looking up as his family is quite proud of him. Him and his best friend Hector use a camera to film some stunts they do, even use it to spy on a creepy lady in the apartment unit below them. Well after a couple of events Jesse ends up noticing that strange things are happening to and around him. Turns out living in the same apartment complex as said creepy lady whose into black arts isn't a great move. Course this is all filmed with the first person camera that is common with the ""Paranormal Activity"" and other ""found footage"" flicks.

There's a couple of jolts but the attempts to tie things back to the previous films feel forced and not very scary. ** out of 4 stars",1403222400,,819,4.381578947368421

Recent high school graduates and best friends Jesse and Hector face the same demonic forces that terrorise the protagonists of the previous Paranormal Activity films in this Latino spin-off of the found footage horror franchise.

What did I think?

Another day, another demon. There are a couple of scary moments in The Marked Ones, which is presented as a cousin rather than a direct sequel, but overall it is too formulaic to be effective. Though focusing on Latin-American characters, the film bypasses the opportunity to expound on Catholicisms approach to demonic possession, which could have been gripping. Fans will appreciate details about the series established characters but The Marked Ones lacks the satisfying shock of the unfamiliar that made its predecessors successful, and the dissatisfying ending so transparently sets the scene for yet another instalment that the whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth.",1401667200,,941,5.302013422818792

The fixed security camera angle which plays such a prominent role in the filming fixes the action in a way that began to feel formulaic in the next installment, and the efforts to work around this also became too obvious.

When I rented the Marked Ones I expected a direct to DVD type film and was pleasantly surprised. As a found-footage film it's pretty decent, and by moving away from the usual characters and placing a Mexican family as the center of demonic attention the whole concept is freshened up. It's well produced, well acted and more than a little creepy.

Nothing will beat the superb Last Exorcism in the demonic found footage department, but you certainly won't regret buying or renting this if you're looking for a couple of hours of creepy entertainment.",1400544000,,863,4.746666666666667

6192102,1,B00HNTIXK0,"The Paranormal Activity Series, in my opinion, has gone on for far too long. The first one was really good. It had events where it all led up to the big scare at the end.
Second one was okay. I didn't think it was that bad despite my family review. It gave the story to why things happened.
Third one was meh, but still watchable. The first and second one hinted a lot about their childhood and it made you curious what happened.
But by the time the 4th one came out, it was... boring... Nothing new really happened. You see people getting possessed, people involved end up dying, and in the end the dark forces win.
The 4th and 5th movies of Paranormal Activity, in my opinion, unneeded. In my opinion, the Paranormal Activity series just needs to have a movie that finishes it. This movie wasn't that.

I chose this rating because I saw the other four movies. That means I knew what was gonna happen and where most of the scares where gonna go. Plus, the scares weren't that great compared to the others.
The comedy.. was a little amusing. Or maybe I was just laughing at how predictable it was. I dislike how it differed so much from the others. In this one, the possessed played a much more active role in killing others compared to the others where the demon basically killed them all. It made me question, ""Why did things suddenly change?"" There was no answer to my question.
I would recommend this movie to people who haven't seen other paranormal activity movies. Maybe you'll draw a different conclusion than I did. If you've seen the others, don't watch it. It will just pain you to see how much they're dragging this on just for money.",1400198400,,1646,4.450331125827814

Toward the end jesse's close friend travels through a witchcraft door (located at katie's grandma creepy residence) that takes us through the houses of previous PA releases and showing us how possessed katie baited micah to his death.

Aside from all that it was just an okay release, honestly there was no need for it seeing as how it wasn't a very effective entry for the franchise.

This film isn't focused so much on pure terror as much as just having strange and odd things happen, which is refreshingly disturbing on a different level than the usual quick jump Boo! scares that the majority of horror employs.

It gave a whole new perspective that we had not seen even a glimpse of previously. I did laugh a lot, but I also jumped, and felt my heart pound with fear as the film hit it's climax. I have read reviews that stated that  they movie ""tried to tie up all of the loose ends in a sloppy manner"". I didn't find this to be true at at. The last 5-10 minutes was an absolute thrill ride for me, and my friends. We even went back and re-watched the ending just to make sure that what we thought we saw was accurate. I found this to be much better than PA 4, and felt like it was a new and invigorating installment in the series. If you are unsure, it doesn't cost that much to rent on Amazon Prime.

6192123,1,B00HNTIXK0,"This movie is better than counting sheep to put you to sleep.  Horrible, don't waste your time or money.  I love the paranormal activity movies, but they should have ended on a good note.  This was terrible.",1398988800,2,207,4.54054054054054
6192124,4,B00HNTIXK0,"What can you say about ""found footage"" style film making, except that you either love these type of movies or hate them.

I seem to be that rare breed of animal where I fall on either side of the love/hate found-footage spectrum like the ebb & flow of the ocean, but there's usually some apparent consistency about it.

As a standard rule, the more slow-paced and ""subtle"" these types of movies are, the more they tend to hold my interest (e.g. ""The Blair Witch Project""; ""Apollo 18""); whereas the more fast-paced and blatantly in-your-face such movies are, the more I feel like I'm being cheated and ""dumbed-down"" to (e.g. ""Apartment 143: Emergo""; ""Grave Encounters"").

Another important element that often determines my level of acceptance and enjoyment of these types of films is their ability to allow me to suspend just enough disbelief to where I can almost envision these events as actually taking place in the real world -- hence why I seem to be in the vast minority in greatly preferring ""Quarantine"" over its original inspiration ""[REC]"", or why I strongly feel that the follow-up to the excellent ""V/H/S"" should have never been made.

So what makes ""Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones"" so different?

The first ""Paranormal Activity"" (the *ORIGINAL* one, before Paramount butchered it to death with their sell-out ""Let's Guarantee That We Can Make A Sequel"" ending) was a ""just okay"" but attention-holding entry into the ""F-F"" genre, one that I'd actually like to revisit now that ""PA:TMO"" cleverly linked the two stories together (but again, I'll have to wait for the *ORIGINAL* version to be released on DVD... c'mon, Paramount!). Things rapidly went downhill from there with that dog-awful ""PA2,"" and I can only assume that it got worse from then on.

But the premise of ""TMO"" seemed rather intriguing, and the few clips & previews I'd seen really sparked my interest, even though it was clearly being marketed as a loud and energetic offering. And upon actually watching the film I was completely drawn-in and hooked throughout the entire viewing. (*NOTE: this was one of those times where I'd not had the opportunity to view the movie prior to purchasing it, so I took what is now for me one of those very rare ""leaps of faith"" coming in to this one!)

Even though they again sold it as a ""found-footage"" story, in keeping with the ""PA"" tradition, I found myself almost completely ignoring that aspect of it and was relating to it more as an entertaining movie in its own right... and that's what made this entry something of an exception, and exceptional, because I never found myself being distracted by the movie's mockumentary style, so there were no efforts made on my part to try to suspend disbelief and imagine the events as having taken place in any sort of ""real world"" setting: this was just pure ""sit down & get swept away"" entertainment, and the over-the-top elements are actually part of what helped make it for more enjoyable viewing, whereas if they had tried too hard to put on the pretense as so many other ""F-F"" type movies do it just might have lost me.",1398902400,,3091,4.7879924953095685
6192125,3,B00HNTIXK0,"What does it mean to be spooky?  The first two installments of the Paranormal Activity series were just that, and the reason is because those films imply demonic phenomena without explicitly revealing the enemy.  The first two films don't contain shots of, let's say, just for instance, witches running around or long-fanged monsters leaping out at the camera.  They also don't spell out the mysterious backstory of what is essentially meant to be an otherworldly, spiritual entity.  As the producers obtained larger budgets, it seems that they strayed further from the simplicity and mundane appeal of that earlier, less plot heavy, found footage format.  The lesson here should be clear:  Less is more.

This is really Paranormal Activity:  Ethnic Edition!  It's a love letter to our growing population of hispanic immigrants and their children.  It's unfortunate that this attempt at an inclusive appeal didn't result in more favorable reviews.  If only we could get Immigration Reform pushed through so that America's hispanics can step out of the shadows and into the dimly lit theaters to show their support for highly stereotyped films such as this one.  According to these characterizations, hispanics are apparently poor, fatherless, frequently up to no good, prone to confrontation and violence, gang affiliated, in possession of illegal firearms, immersed in bizarre folk religion, and sexually promiscuous.  (Granted, the ""sexually promiscuous"" knock could be applied to many groups, not just hispanics.)

There is a new twist on the ""invisible demon"" character.  Instead of being a separate and unseen entity, in the Marked Ones he/they more frequently appear to possess the main character, acting through him.  There are scenes where this character is initially thrilled by the newfound ""superpowers"" that the possession affords him, and for a few minutes you may wonder whether you're watching that other (better) found footage movie, Chronicle.

The most genuinely scary part of the movie was when the group of teens were communicating with the demon via a battery powered game (a la the game Simon).  This scene was in the vein of any other Ouija scene, but I guess using Ouija has either been overdone or was judged to be too ""white"" or upper class for this movie; thus we get Simon instead.  The demon communicates using the device, answering the group's yes/no questions, until they ask it if it is ""good""; this query alone receives no response.  Utterly predictable, true, but still unsettling.

The plausibility of the found footage angle is stretched to the limit here, as it also was in Paranormal Activity 3.  In the original Paranormal Activity, use of the camera made sense, as the protagonist was aware of the presence and wanted to ""catch it"" in the act.  The camera there was stationary.  The camera(s) were also fixed in place in the second installment, where the host family had a home security system.  In this movie and the third installment, the cameras are largely handheld.  Even when the protagonists are in deathly danger, for some reason they still feel the need to point the camera in front of them.  One scene in the Marked Ones has a protagonist attempting to escape his would-be killers through upstairs windows that are boarded up.  Common sense would suggest that the odds of succeeding at this would have been increased had he had full use of both hands.  So...why not drop the camera?

A final point of criticism again concerns the franchise's straying from what made the initial film work.  Here there is a jarring focus on magic, time traveling, and teleportation, whereas earlier films got it right with much simpler, albeit vague, demonology.",1398902400,,3694,5.086378737541528
6192126,4,B00HNTIXK0,"It's not exactly part of the ""Paranormal Activity"" franchise, but it does have an interesting tie-in to the other films. I liked this one, although I know some people didn't. But I have a soft spot for found footage films and tend to watch everyone that comes out. This one was pretty good -considering that this film genre does have some real dogs. I'd recommend to others.",1398902400,,374,4.597014925373134

Christopher B. Landons Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones is a distant relative to the earlier Paranormal Activity movies, sharing the name but none of the characters or locales of the previous four (though theres a slight connection tacked on, seemingly as an afterthought, at the end).  The supernatural events in The Marked Ones happen to a working-class family living in an apartment in Oxnard, CA. Upon graduating from high school, Jesse (Andrew Jacobs), with the help of his best friend, Hector (Jorge Diaz), begins filming virtually every single moment of his waking life (and some of his sleeping ones as well) with his dads new camera. At first, it all feels like fun and games, but soon menacing events begin to happen involving the mysterious old woman, a possible bruja, who lives downstairs from the family.

Made up entirely of jittery, handheld, point-of-view shots, the movie is basically an urban version of the The Blair Witch Project, an innovative work that set the template for a whole sub-set of horror films to come. That means that The Marked Ones suffers from one of the flaws inherent in that narrative-telling device as well, namely that the characters continue filming the proceedings long after common sense - let alone the instinct for self-preservation - would have dictated that they put down the camera and start running for their lives.

Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones earns points for its Hispanic cast and for achieving a moderately creepy moment every now and again, but its a pretty ho-hum affair overall, lacking the kind of over-arching structure or clear-cut resolution that would actually make it matter in the long run. My suspicion is that, with Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones, the found footage genre may have finally run its course.",1398816000,,1799,5.0675675675675675

The story line was good because it took us out of the tired surburan areas and into the real world. The acting was excellent and the story moved along at a steady pace. There were good scares and tension and i've never seen a film where there's a secret chamber hidden beneath an apartment building in the hood. Good stuff. This film just added to the mythology of the entire franchise by going it's own way and leading back to the beginning through that doorway that takes you to an unholy place, a demon haunted condo. It wasn't the typical 'follow the formula that works' routine, with security cameras that pan a kitchen where the furniture gets moved around. Talk about boring.

6192151,3,B00HNTIXK0,"Here comes the fifth Paranormal Activity film (not including Paranormal Activity: Tokyo Night), and though the fact remains that the franchise has lost its momentum, the new entry is still a decent horror movie with a few (but not many) nice scares.

Set in California, Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones follows Jesse (Andrew Jacobs) and Hector (Jorge Diaz), two high school best friends who notice that there are suspicious activities going in the room of Jesse's neighbor Anna (Gloria Sandoval). When a murder takes place, Jesse and Hector sneak into her room unwisely.

Though this is a found footage film, The Marked Ones feels more like a conventional horror movie, breaking from the traditional ways of storytelling prevalent in the series, like a still camera and moving objects. While this is a welcome change that refreshes the series, this also means the latest entry doesnt really have to be a Paranormal Activity film, except when some of the characters from the previous Paranormal Activity films reappear.

Not that Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones is a bad film; it is only that the spin-off attempts to do something new with a very limited success.",1398038400,,1171,5.05699481865285

I also think it may be better to see this kind of a film in a group where the tension feeds off of one another.  And the goofy parts shared, too.  It was cool when the star of the movie Jessie was leaning back and couldn't fall.

6192157,3,B00HNTIXK0,"Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones is the latest installment of the found footage horror franchise that began in 2009. This time, the setting is Oxnard, Californias Hispanic community. Directed by Christopher Landon (Michael Landons son), this edition traces the downfall of teenagers Jesse (Andrew Jacobs) and Hector (Jorge Diaz), high-schoolers who spend their post-graduation days partying heavily while filming themselves on their digital cam. The party ends with some creepy activity in the apartment above them.

A woman has died and black magic appears to have played a part. When Jesse awakens with an unexplained bite on his arm and begins acting oddly, Hector is convinced his buddy has been possessed. Soon, Jesse starts showing supernatural powers. Eerie music, terrified expressions, quick shocks, and dizzying camera movement kick in, attempting to make the viewer jump. The formula, however, is overly familiar by now, and the movie often works too hard with less-than-stellar results.

6192163,2,B00HNTIXK0,"WELL, HERE we are at the 5th Paranormal Activity movie and, even though the scares  and the story  are dying, this franchise is going strong.

Why? Its cheap to make  about $5-million  and profits continue to be huge. Over $32-million-in-the-U.S.A.-huge. Its probably safe to say well see more of these.

OK, Ill admit Im a sucker for the horror show. The Conjuring was one of my favorite movies of 2013, and I loved Paranormal Activity 1 and 2. Even so, the thrill  and interest  began to wane at No. 3. Four was a yawner and five? Well, its hard to nod off with all the screaming, especially in the unrated, extended version. Truth be told, when one character finally drops dead, its a relief, especially for the ear drums. Also, it also means were very close to the end. Hooray.

Thats what marks the difference between the theatrical release and the extended. More screaming, in case you wondered.

Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones continues the demon-possession story set up in the first film. The difference this time: Its set in a Hispanic community and follows the adventures of two best friends. The setting and characters were a happy surprise. Theyre  sadly  unique. Afterward, the movie hits so many clichs, its all downhill. Like my expectations.

Jesse (Andrew Jacobs) has just graduated from high school, and has been gifted with a camera. He spends his time goofing around with best bud Hector (Jorge Diaz) without any apparent thought as to what he might do after graduation  like look for a job or go to college. An early activity has Hector sliding down a steep set of stairs in a plastic laundry basket, with Jesse filming. Its a crash and burn with skinned knees and elbows and yelling. (Didnt they already explore this activity pre-grade school?) Eventually, the plot starts to simmer in the scare department via a suddenly demented graduate from the same class and the bruja (witch), who lives in the apartment downstairs.

Its unfair to release additional plot details. The story is so simple, anything more risks serious spoilers, but, as a warning, you should know a little dog is tormented.

The hand-held camera cinematography is still intentionally shaky and rough. It might be filmed in high-def, but never looks like it even on Blu-ray. Sound comes through cleanly  especially screams, as noted. One HUGE annoyance is a lack of subtitles for a character that only speaks Spanish. But I guess that would ruin the found-footage mystique.

The only extra is a handful of deleted scenes. Were they in the extended version? Its hard to tell; both versions are such nonsensical jumbles.

We haven't seen the end of the Paranormal Activity franchise. Thats the scariest part about The Marked Ones. Am I too gullible to hope the next one will be better?

6192194,4,B00HNTIXK0,"The previous entry in this found footage franchise was widely panned as the weakest of the series even by fans and while I didn't think it was as bad as it was made out to be, it was still the lesser of the series and was showing a franchise in need of either fresh ideas and more daring directions or a final chapter to wrap it up. The Marked Ones is definitely a good start back in the right direction and a spooky sign that these movies may not be done yet, if this is where things might be headed. Fans of this series will be happy to know that not only does this supposed spin-off get PA back on track but, is more reliant on actual scares than jump scares and answers a lot of questions that the other films have set up. It ties in perfectly with the previous entries and yet is its own flick. The movie starts out with friends Jesse (Andrew Jacobs), Hector (Jorge Diaz) and Marisol (Gabrielle Walsh) who live in an urban neighborhood and have a downstairs neighbor Anna (Gloria Sandoval) who is said to be a witch. One night this witch is murdered and Jesse and Hector who are always filming things with a new camera choose to sneak into her apartment and poke around. They find the womans journal and it does indeed seem to indicate this mysterious woman was into the black arts and was part of a witch coven seeking to build an army of demon possessed first born males. Jesse wakes up the next morning with a bite mark on his arm and things start to get weird and Jesses behavior starts to change with heightened aggression, strength and an almost supernatural ability to keep himself from harm. This causes Hector and Marisol to investigate further which includes meeting with Ali Rey (Molly Ephraim) from Paranormal Activity 2 and they soon find that Jesse may have been marked by this coven since before birth to become the next soldier in this nightmarish army. Can they save him or will Jesse be damned like the others before him? Writer/director Christopher Landon answers that question and many more with a truly crap you pants finale following a fun and scare filled flick that is both familiar and fresh at the same time. He knows how to build scares and he does so slowly with a film that builds its momentum steadily till a really intense last act that leads up to one of the best horror movie endings in quite a while and a climax fans of this series will love from between the spaces of the fingers that are covering their eyes. Landon cleverly ties this flick in with the previous entries and we get references galore and revisit a few familiar settings as well. As for the return of any other familiar faces other then Ali, youll have to see it to find out. The cast are really good here. Our three leads are very likable and supply some fun laughs early on especially from Diazs lovable goof-ball Hector. Jacobs makes a solid leading man and we like Jesse and feel for him as it becomes obvious he is in deep supernatural trouble. The camaraderie between the three makes Hector and Marisols efforts to save him seem real and the risks they take believable and messing with a demonic worshiping witch cult is risky, as we find out. So, in conclusion Christopher Landon has things back to form and even shows promise of more intense things to come. He makes good use of the found footage format which is far less obtrusive here then in the last flick and he has a nice visual style to add to the atmosphere. This is also the most violent entry in the series and one of the scariest since the first flick so, this film earns its R rating from more then just a few curse words and snapped necks. And if nothing else, Landon gives his Latino themed entry in this series a really great ending that will stick with you for a while after leaving the theater, especially if you are a fan. Now with Paranormal Activity 5 being released October 2014, lets hope they can keep this new momentum going. It may still not attract any new fans to the series but, should rejuvenate the interest of fans disappointed by PA4. Well done and a lot of scary fun!",1397174400,3,4064,4.412782956058589

After the first film, we learned Katie kidnaps Hunter in the second film, then witches are behind the curse in the third, and basically nothing in the fourth.

The movie offers its fair share of sleaze, with some boobs, more violence than usual in this series, and the record for most times a character says, ""Oh, s***!"" in a movie, as well as some juvenile dumb humor that actually does warrant a few laughs.  At this point in the series though, with these characters being really dumb and with the ending always the same (it's really not a spoiler to say everybody dies in the end!), this series is getting really tiring.  Most of the film I just wondered why every single event had to be filmed (""I just got hit by a demon! Better not forget my camera!"").

The basic premise has a good bit of potential, and there are some unexpected (though half-baked) twists and turns here and there, but it seems the makers of this film didn't try too terribly hard and were eager to just get this done and out there.

Now I've got a Blu-ray with a DVD that I don't want with two theatrical versions of a film that, in all likelihood, I won't watch again.
I didn't think 4 was as bad as some people seemed to but, with this effort, the bell really has tolled. Paramount would do well to listen. We've seen it ALL before.
It gets two stars only because of its expectancy quotient. Really, 1.5 stars would do it justice.",1397001600,4,961,4.404494382022472
6192204,4,B00HNTIXK0,"I didn't get a chance to see this in theatres.  So since I have the other four on Blu-Ray already, I figured I would order this one for my collection as well (I bought The Hobbit: The Desolation Of Smaug along with this).  I got it today and sat down to watch it.
  I wasn't disappointed actually.  Believe it or not, I was glad for the break from the 3rd & 4th movies.  By the 3rd film, as much as I liked getting the back story, it was like ""Can we move on to something else please with this novel franchise?"".  The 4th was just a logical extension of the extended storyline.  But it was the most boring of the 4.
  With this, while not a ""Direct Sequel"", it does tie in fairly nicely with the other movies.  Which I do like.  It doesn't disregard the other movies.  And despite the fact it was with a different set of people, it broght a bit of Freshness to the Paranormal Franchise.  I hope the Franchise continues to get better over time",1396915200,4,942,4.161111111111111
6192205,1,B00HNTIXK0,"I am not sure who wrote this story but the dialogue and ""barrio"" situation seems over the top and ridiculous. None of it is remotely believable and was quite predictable. I know after so many iterations of the film (and the constant knock off story lines out there) it would be hard to manage anything fresh or exciting, but, this just flopped.",1396915200,3,344,4.564516129032258
6192206,2,B00HNTIXK0,Being a fan of the Paranormal Activity series I have been enjoying the build up that has been happening.  I was certain after watching the movie trailer and the movie's advertising this was going to be the movie that would knock it out of the ball park.  Sadly NO it wasn't.  Huge let down.  This series needs a real horror writer and director.  Here are 2 suggestions that will bring this series back to life if at all possible.  Guillermo del Toro and or Frank Darabont.  Check them out.,1396828800,,489,4.426966292134831

6192208,2,B00HNTIXK0,"""It feels like somethings around me, like somethings in my house."" Jesse (Jacobs) and his friend Hector (Diaz) have just graduated High School are are celebrating. When they begin to film themselves doing dangerous stunts they hear screaming from a nearby apartment. When they look up and they see someone they know walking out they want to investigate. What they find in the apartment is strange but nothing compared to what happens to Jesse. Where do I start? When I watched the first Paranormal Activity I have to admit I was creeped out. The ""found-footage"" genre was still new and the way it was filmed (using security cameras) gave it the scare factor. Since then every horror movie has been trying to copy that style, usually failing. That rant brings me to this movie. Rather then the more realistic security camera style this one uses the two most annoying people it can find and gave them a hand-held camera. The hand-held aspect in movies never works for me, mainly because when 90% of happens in the movie you wouldn't take the time to film. This one has the name Paranormal Activity but it is nothing like the others in the series at all...the only real tie in is the last 5 minutes of the movie. The rest of it is more like Chronicle but with much more annoying kids. Overall, yet another reason for the found footage genre to come to an end. I give this a C.",1396569600,,1373,4.540322580645161
6192209,1,B00HNTIXK0,"It sets up the mood very well just like their previous films, but when the action actually happens it's so stupid it's funny. I burst out laughing in theaters on several occasions during the film.

If you want to get technical, my major problem with this film is they try and connect it to the other movies, but it really doesn't make sense. They should have made it a completely separate film. New story line, new connections, everything! They just took everything a step too far and it made the film less believable than the other ones.

The set up to the situations were really good. If anything, it was better than the other films, but the pay off is just pathetic.

If you want a film that puts you on your toes and then makes you laugh, go for it! If you want a film to give you the true essence of horror and fear, then avoid this movie like the plague.",1396396800,3,860,4.263803680981595

I am a huge fan of these movies, as I own all of the previous ""Paranormal Activity"" movies and watch them very often. However, in my opinion, this one had a completely different feel to it...and simply didn't measure up. I didn't find it to be scary or creepy in the least, and it was somewhat boring. The ending was just about the only part that resembled the true ""Paranormal Activity"" movies. Full respect to the cast and crew for all the effort that goes into making a production such as this...and I'm not trying to simply ""bash"" this one in any way. Overall, It's worth renting...but not a keeper!",1396137600,,666,4.558333333333334
6192217,4,B00HNTIXK0,Horror movies are personal. What somebody finds scary another may find dumb. I thought The Marked Ones was one of the better Paranormal Activity's. The acting was solid. The story line was interesting and the relationships in the movie were involving. It's true that it doesn't give away many of the answers to the films questions but it does answer some and even adds to the story this far. One of the better found footage horror movies. Totally solid.,1395964800,,453,4.746835443037975

ALL other questions we have been wondering...well..lets just say...I still have MANY. Not even CLOSE to satisfying  MOST of my questions!  u have been WARNED...$15.99???!!! THATS  A LOT OF $$$ for the ONLY decent 5 minute clip in the ENTIRE movie!  f.y.i. the TRAILER makes this movie waaay more appealing than it actually is!,1395792000,4,767,5.262295081967213

6192227,5,B00HNTIXK0,"Don't let the negative Nancys scaring up highly critical, dismissive and sometimes mean-spirited reviews fool you: PARANORMAL ACTIVITY: THE MARKED ONES is an involving thrill ride that does not disappoint. Oftentimes filmmakers who take a creative risk with a successful series (in this case relocating audiences out of those haunted houses in previous PA films) result in criticism from viewers unwilling to be co-pilots with fresh characters on their spine-tingling adventures. This is a risk that delivers on all counts and provides plenty of scares in the process. One of this film's many delights is its sparkling cast. The chemistry between gifted newcomer Andrew Jacobs and charming veteran Jorge Diaz is one of the keys to this creepy film's success (which, as of this review, has already raked in over $80 million worldwide - pretty damn good for a $5 million budget). They are endearing and utterly believable as their lives are turned upside-down by their unwanted visitors' uninvited invasiveness. One of the bright lead's decent into supernatural madness is particularly heart-wrenching, making his journey all the more believable. And how refreshing for this gringo movie-goer to see an all-Latin cast bringing this winning entry in the franchise to life (Hollywood: take note!). The special effects, as always, are on a head-scratching ""how'd they do that???"" level. The supporting cast also gets high marks... as do the film's talented designers - turning real locations into unsettling streets and spook houses. The series' trademark point-of-view through the camera is equally effective here and conjures up multiple frights throughout. PARANORMAL ACTIVITY: THE MARKED ONES does not disappoint and scares up five solid stars from this horror and thriller snob.",1394064000,35,1778,5.422382671480144
