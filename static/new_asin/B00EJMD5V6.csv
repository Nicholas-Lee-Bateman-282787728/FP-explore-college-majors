8606050,5,B00EJMD5V6,"New Wave Horror Filmmaker Calvin Reeder delivers one of my favorite recent discoveries, after it just showed up on Netflix awhile ago. Now it's here, now it's gone - it's as ephemeral as a nightmare- a fusion of Eraserhead, Fando y Lis, Repo Man, Amer, Easy Rider, and The Andalusian Dog -- A woman wakes up after an  auto accident on some forlorn road in the Pacific NW (there are a lot once you get away from the coast) and a limbo nightmare ensues, while post-rock guitars drone and a guy in a green frog costume becomes both icky stalker and only friend. Not for the faint of heart, but its shudders are earned through deep mind-meld surrealism rather than the predictable torture and abduction. It's strange enough to make David Lynch seem kitchen sink realism. You might hate it, but you'll never forget it.",1414972800,,813,4.606896551724138
8606051,3,B00EJMD5V6,"I admired this free-form, purgatory. Although parts are slow and you might wish for more narrative thrust, there has to be props given to a movie that tries to unsettle the viewer through expert sound design, left-of-field imagery and nightmare logic alone. After all, we live in a horror landscape that has been dominated by torture porn and CGI blood for more than a decade now. So at least this tried for a horror rooted in the abstract and illogical. This DVD package, poster and soundtrack is a nice item. I have to say the sound design/score of the Oregonian is really special - It might be up there with some all time horror classics like the the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, original Evil Dead score, Suspiria, Cannibal Holocaust and Eraserhead - in its ability to establish MOOD. This Director will hopefully bring us good things in whatever genre he pursues",1387324800,3,872,4.781456953642384
