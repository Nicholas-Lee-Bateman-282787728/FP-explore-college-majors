My girls are 2 and 5, and we are big fans if Barbie movies. If this version is the same or close, it's def a classic Barbie movie you have to see.",1446422400,2,315,3.716417910447761
7370590,5,B013QNP82W,This a wonderful Christmas movie but it is a rerelease. It was originally released in 2011. The packaging is new not sure if there is much else different between the two besides the price.  I gave it 5 stars for the movie itself. But I recommend  getting the cheaper one if you p ly care about having the movie.,1446336000,2,311,4.254237288135593
8728525,5,B013QNP82W,"Not only is this my favorite DVD in the Barbie series, but it appears as if other reviewers feel the same as I.

Barbie and her sisters fly out of California for a Christmas holiday to be spent with their aunt in New York City. Bad weather forces their plane to land in Minnesota and from there the adventure begins. The sisters come upon a beautiful home nestled in the snow filled hills. There something kinda unique about this home and the folks who live in it. But you will have to find out what it is that makes this place so special at this time of the year..

You won't go wrong with this Barbie episode and it should easily become a classic that is shown in your home during Christmas every year. It will bring back such happy memories your family enjoyed during the holiday season.",1533686400,,790,4.331081081081081
