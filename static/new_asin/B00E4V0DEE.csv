* ""I have just finished watching the DVD twice and I just had to write to you to express my thanks for your passion for this project. It is evident from the first line to the very last fiddle note by Art Stamper. Wow!"" ~ a fellow Bluegrass Nut
* ""I appreciated the video and was happy to support its' production. I'm from Kentucky and grew up with this music. Bless you for reviving memories."" ~ Doris S., Kentucky
* ""The DVD was well conceived and executed. I had fun listening to the anecdotes and became a more rounded and educated bluegrass fan. James, your DVD adds so much more to the story of bluegrass. I feel as though I am living those times with the musicians. I will cherish it and watch it over and over."" ~ Gary R., Virginia
* ""James , I was very impressed with your DVD. Looks like a lot of time and energy went into your project. I saw a couple of surprises while watching, one was Charlie Bailey, that was neat. The other was Mac Martin and Mike Carson, Mac is my uncle and it's great to see him getting some attention. You did a great job with all the interviews, lots of luck!"" ~  John M., Pennsylvania
* ""The Pioneers of Bluegrass gives the viewers, both novices and hardcore bluegrass fans, insight into the life experiences of many well-known bluegrass musicians. This DVD captures their true life stories of growing up, how they got into this business, and some experiences of their road travels. Musicians both past and present were interviewed. I was riveted to this DVD the entire time it was playing. It is a 'Must Have' for all bluegrass fans who want to know how it all started!!"" ~ Al Shusterman, KCBL Radio, California

8601102,5,B00E4V0DEE,"This film preserves the memories of so many dedicated and selfless pioneers of bluegrass music. Many of those who appear in the documentary are no longer with us which makes their stories all the more poignant. And it's a true tribute to all those who participated in creating this musical genre, not just the big names that so often take center stage. Though a key piece of history for any hard core bluegrass follower, this film is not a slick Hollywood production and there's not even a lot of music. Instead, ""Making History with Pioneers of Bluegrass"" focuses on the individuals that helped create this genre like Jimmy Martin, Mac Wiseman, Bobby Osborne, and the Stoneman's. You hear stories of sacrifice, dedication, innovation, and downright risks to life and limb straight from the mouths of those involved. The film was shot using a ""man on the street"" interview technique which made me feel like I was right there in the same room, or backstage, or even literally on the street with these bluegrass legends. If James Reams' goal was to whet my appetite for more and get me to dig into the archives for some old recordings, then he sure succeeded. I had a hankering for all things bluegrass when I finished watching this DVD. This film represents one man's attempt to preserve these legacies - before they disappeared forever - for future generations of bluegrass music lovers. And I have to say that these preserves are mighty tasty!",1377561600,,1444,4.803212851405623
