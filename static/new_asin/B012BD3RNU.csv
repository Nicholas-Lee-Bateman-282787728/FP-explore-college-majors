7344748,1,B012BD3RNU,"I have to admit the only way I saw this movie was on Mystery Science Theater 3000.  I warn you, it is the only way ANYONE  should ever see it. It is the very definition of a bad movie.  It is worthy of becoming a lab experiment because of the purity of badness to it.  No redeeming qualities of any kind.  Bad filming, bad acting, bad casting, bad sound, bad costumes, bad dialect.  It is a veritable void, a black hole of utter awfulness.

From what I can gather, a family is gets lost and stops at a cabin looking for help.  They are greeted by the creepiest mo fo you have ever seen.  The place is a cover for some kind of satanic cult and they get drawn in.  And drawn badly.

It is necessary to expand on this review.  I have since learned that there is actually a cult attached to this film and do not care to see this gem (cough cough, hack hack) insulted.

So lets go over the basics here. I CLEARLY am not a verified buyer of this turd.  It would say so.  Why I would buy a film I clearly despise makes sense on some planet.  Problem is, this is earth.

The film is the product.  If  you look up other films, you will find that the vast majority of people review the film.  The disc, the box, the contents of the package are only relevant if you are buying a used copy.  Otherwise, the contents are listed on the product description.  So, what they said.

As stated, I saw this on Mystery Science Theater which is why I do not require treatment.  The film blows harder than Hurricane Patricia.",1438560000,17,1502,4.153310104529616

7344754,4,B012BD3RNU,"This review is for the Blu-Ray version of Manos: The Hands of Fate.

For anybody who is looking for a good movie or at least one so bad it's funny, you need to look elsewhere. All the 5 star reviews are for the presentation and quality of the blu-ray DVD, not for the movie itself. The movie itself is so bad it deserves minus 100 stars!

Years ago Mystery Science 3000 'discovered' this movie and it became one of their most popular episodes ever. If you don't enjoy terrible movies then you should watch that version. It is available on Amazon.

The Producer who plays the husband Mike, is Harold P. Warren. He literally sold s*** (fertilizer salesman) for a living so it's no surprise his movie was s***! He decided to make the movie while he was having lunch with screewriter Stirling Silliphant. He was an extra at the time and he bet him he could make a movie by himself and get it released into theaters. Well guess what? He won that bet!

'Manos: The Hands of Fate' is possibly the worst movie of all time that went into general release. I'm not convinced it's the worst. I have another candidate which I will get into later. It's definitely top 3. However, it is at least the worst horror movie of all time. If there is one worse, I'd like somebody to tell me what it is. There are a few sci-fi movies that are definite candidates. Once again, more on that later.

BLU-RAY DVD: The quality of this DVD is as good as it is probably going to get but it can be better. As explained in the interview with Ben Solovey, who is responsible for the restoration, he did not exactly do a complete restoration. Solovey got hold of the original negatives and did his restoration and the result is what you see. The original was filmed in 16mm. The negative had all kinds of imperfections which the restorers decided to leave without correcting. At least, this is what I took away from the interview. It's always possible I interpreted it incorrectly. They felt that the imperfections were there when the film was shot and the prints were made and wanted to leave it exactly the way it was. In other words the imperfections did not occur over time but were always there and that was the way the movie was originally released. Probably a good choice but I still would like to see the movie with the negative cleaned up and all the imperfections gone. Perhaps someday when it's cheaper to do, they will release another special edition with both versions.
With all this in mind, don't expect to see a beautiful restored picture like many other older movies that have been restored. It was shot in 'lowly' 16 mm so right off the bat you have an inferior print and as mentioned above, the film had many imperfections. What you do get is the best print anybody has ever seen. (at least since the original release)

EXTRA'S: There are lots of very good extra's. For starters you get a commentary track with ""the master"" himself, Tom Neyman along with Jackey Neyman, who played the daughter, Debbie. You also get a 'Ballyhoo' featurette called Hands: The Fate of ""Manos."" Other featurettes are 'Restoring the Hands of Fate and Felt: The Puppet Hands of Fate. There is also a ""Grindhouse Unrestored Version"". I have no idea what the difference is but the quality of the print is far inferior than the feature. I thought it was interesting seeing the footage in the theater from the premier. You see lots of smiling faces and people actually look excited to be there. I can only imagine what they were thinking while watching it. Some of the members of the cast were so embarrassed that they slipped out before it ended.

'Hands: The Fate of ""Manos"" is a particularly good featurette. This is an entertaining half hour about the making of the movie with interview with several of the characters including Debbie, Maggie, and 'The Master.' The interviews are just 'dripping' with sarcasm. Maggie (Diane Mahree) elaborates on how she got hired. She tells a story of how Harold P. Warren (Producer) asked her to remove her top during casting and when she refused he gave her the part. Since the movie was filmed without sound, everyone was told to go to a studio to dub in the audio but very few characters made it since nobody had the money to travel and were refused any funds to get there. Every female voice in the movie was dubbed by one woman, even little Debbie! (this is why she sounds so creepy)  All of the wives of 'the master' came from a local Texas modelling agency. There must not be much 'talent' down there because you don't see any real beauties amongst the wives. We also get to the bottom of the Torgo controversy. While it had been widely speculated that the reason he walks so funny in the movie is because he is supposed to be a satyr and is wearing a metal contraption (incorrectly) to give that walk. Well apparently the original script did call for him to be a satyr. But for unknown reasons, probably budgetary, the whole part about him being a satyr is crossed off the script. So he really wasn't a satyr in the movie. Supposedly it was a painful metal contraption. Torgo (John Reynolds) was a drug addict who spent almost the whole shoot high on LSD. He never saw the premier as he killed himself before the premier. He died with military honors thanks to his father.

PLOT/STORY: As if this is really necessary.....I'll keep it brief.....
Ok, so Mike, Margaret and daughter Debbie are on a road trip in the El Paso area of Texas. They take a wrong turn somewhere (after driving around for what seems like hours) and end up at (I think) The Valley Lodge. Here we meet the infamous 'Torgo' who tells us his master is away. He also tells us there is no way back to the highway.....ok so, I guess the family is staying the night.....Torgo likes Margaret...Torgo tells Margaret that 'the master' will want her to be one of his wives....Mike goes looking for their daughter's dog....Mike finds dead dog.....Debbie makes friends with the Hound from Hell....Mike ends up tied to a post....Torgo likes Margaret some more....we meet 'the master' and his argumentative wives. Incidentally Mike is around 50, his wife is 20 and the daughter is around 9!.....go figure that one out.....Torgo tells 'the master' he has a lot of wives already and that he should get Margaret. Mike is not prepared to give up his wife....ok, I guess that's as far as I need to go....somehow this gets resolved, right?....or not....The End?

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Just about everyone who see 'Manos: The Hands of Fate' will tell you the best thing about the movie is Torgo, played by John Reynolds. His performance is so unusual that just about everyone who sees it says they have never seen anything like it. He was a drug addict who spent almost the whold shoot high on LSD. Obviously this had something to do with his 'spectacular' performance as 'the master's' assistant. He never saw the premier as he killed himself before the premier. He died with military honors.
Speaking of the premier, that has a great story unto itself. Harold Warren had all the 'stars' lineup around the block and had a limousine pick a few up at a time and drive them to the entrance so as to give the illusion that he had hired multiple limousine's.
From listening to Tom Neyman's (the master) comments, I learned that he designed the robe himself. He did a real good job. Along with Torgo, the best thing in the movie.

MY TWO CENTS: Is Manos the worst movie ever? I think it's the worst horror movie ever made that was released in theatres. I'm not sure it's the worst ever of any genre. Before I saw this, I felt that 'The Beast of Yucca Flats' was the worst I had ever seen. Now I'm not so sure. 'The Beast of Yucca Flats' gets my vote for worst sci-fi of all time but it's a tossup for worst of all time of any genre. At least Manos has Torgo and it has that wonderful robe worn by 'the master'. 'Beast' has a topless scene and it has Tor Johnson but that is not necessarily a good thing. Even though they both dubbed in audio, in Manos, they at least spoke their lines. In Beast, the only time anybody talks is when you can't see their mouths! Ultimately Manos' plot is your standard horror fare, family gets lost and are harassed at a creepy hotel. The 'Beast' doesn't have any clue what's going on. Watching 'Tor Johnson,' who looks like he can barely breathe, let alone run(walk) after those kids almost defies belief. The Narrator's comments are so bad that you actually feel dumber after listening to him.
Anyway rounding out the 3, for me anyway, is Mesa of Lost Women. The only positive thing you can possibly say about that one is that it stars Jackie Coogan of Addams Family fame. We can also throw in Phil Tucker's Robot Monster (which I actually enjoyed) and The Cape Canaveral Monsters along with Mr. Big's 'King Dinosaur.' Anyway, off the top of my head, those are my candidates for worst ever.

Highly Recommended for all fans of awful movies. For everyone else stay away at all costs. If you have a morbid curiosity, watch the Mystery Science 3000 version so you will at least get a few laughs.",1462233600,,9076,4.534188034188034
7344755,5,B012BD3RNU,"99% of those who know about this disasterpiece are MST3K fans, let's just get that out of the way. Now, the thing is with movies that have gotten the treatment from Joel/Mike and the Bots, is that watching them without the stream of constant ridicule can be boring. Not ""Manos"". This movie is so relentlessly and HILARIOUSLY bad that it stands, proud and mighty, on its own. I simply LOVE this movie! After ""Plan 9"" it is my favorite so-bad-it's-good movie, and seeing it on glorious HD makes it even better. There are some extra minutes of ineptitude here missing from the MST3K version, Margaret is really REALLY cute, John Reynolds was actually quite a handsome man and in HD is clearly stoned and/or tripping heavily in every scene, The Master is fabulous, and the cat-fight between The Wives had me on the edge of my seat! OK, the last one was a lie, but their granny-panties are funny anyway. Also a nice doc along with it, much better than the one on YouTube that consists mostly of an old, fat and almost incomprehensible ""Makeout Boy"" muttering to himself while he chain-smokes.

7344758,4,B012BD3RNU,"THE STORY: A husband & wife and their young daughter are vacationing by car when they accidentally take a wrong turn and end up at a rundown house in the middle of the desert overseen by a physically & mentally twisted character who calls himself Torgo. The deformed caretaker watches over the dumpy place while his boss, referred to only as ""The Master,"" is away. Torgo begrudgingly invites the family to spend the night... and what follows is a genuine nightmare - for both the film's characters AND the unsuspecting viewer.

THOUGHTS: MANOS is a movie most people only know through Mystery Science Theater 3000. The episode featuring MANOS is one of their best. MANOS by itself is one of those heavyweight contenders for Worst Movie Ever (and deservedly so). The film is a stunningly incompetent mess, there are no two ways about it. But at least this Blu-ray edition managed to make the best of some tattery original film elements and give us a fairly decent (all things considered) hi-def transfer that's sure to delight fans. (You know who you are!) Even so, MANOS will never look ""perfect"" no matter how much technology & money are thrown at it. It was photographed by people who had no experience operating a movie camera, and the camera used was an archaic model that did not allow for proper focus pull, so everything is slightly (or mightily) out of focus. That kind of error cannot be fixed after the fact. Stories behind the film's production and the personalities behind it are the stuff of Z-movie legend: it was made on a bet; written & directed by (and starring) a fertilizer salesman; the actor who played Torgo committed suicide before the film even opened, etc., etc. Once you've viewed it, MANOS isn't something you're likely to forget anytime soon - no matter how hard you try. (Good luck getting the hilariously awful theme music for Torgo out of your head.) Torgo is what really MAKES this film. MANOS would almost certainly be all but unwatchable without his stumbling, stuttering, mumbling, menacing, molesting, disturbingly wonderful presence. Still... do you REALLY need to own your very own copy of MANOS? I suppose that depends on how desperate you are to be able to assault your eyes & ears at a moment's notice with this cinematic equivalent of repeated hammer blows to the head. Bad movie aficionados will find much to celebrate. More importantly, MANOS can now be more honestly re-evaluated & re-appreciated thanks to this pretty alright-looking ""restored"" edition. Yes, the triumphs are few & far between while the failures span as far as the eye can see. It is a hilariously inept movie. Still, I'll take a film like MANOS over much of the dreck that's in theaters today. Most casual movie watchers though will most likely stare at the disjointed goings-on for a few minutes and then wonder aloud just what the hell this thing is supposed to be, and what all the hubbub is about. Which category do YOU fall into???

THE BLU-RAY: Synapse Films gives us what is arguably the penultimate version of this wretched moving picture. Reports floating around the internet suggest that the film elements used for this hi-def restoration of MANOS were stumbled upon at a garage sale! True? Who knows. There is an interesting behind-the-scenes featurette in which Ben Solovey, who championed the restorative work, delves into the hows & whys of the film's resurrection, but there's no mention of flea market finds or any such. Regardless, the tireless obsession of Solovey and the handful of other folks who worked against all odds to bring the best possible version of MANOS to you, the viewing public, is both admirable & laughable. Ben Solovey is committed, and if he isn't he should be. HA! In truth, I wholly sympathize with Solovey and his crew, being as I'm something of a Z-movie masochist myself. Several other bonus goodies included with the feature film up the value of this eclectic purchase a tad. Sadly however, the revered MST3K adaption of MANOS is not included on this disc. (Dang it!) If you are going to buy this deluxe Blu of MANOS but don't already have (or have never seen) the MST3K edition then you owe it to yourself to buy a copy and include it with this Blu-ray. The MST3K version is infinitely more watchable and makes for a more complete MANOS experience. BOTTOM LINE: While certainly not something most will enjoy (or even comprehend), MANOS is nonetheless one of those strange films that gets under your skin. I was sincerely impressed by how much thought, attention and love went into sprucing up what basically amounts to an infected carbuncle on the buttocks of cinematic history. I am certain that ""The Master"" most definitely WOULD approve! 4 STARS",1452902400,5,4708,4.83271375464684

Manos is a film i always wanted to have and more importantly to watch. I'm a real movie buff so it's very nice to have it in my collection.
I haven't seen it yet, but i'm planning to see it this holidays. It will be a real treat !",1447804800,3,252,3.8653846153846154
7344762,5,B012BD3RNU,"It's a bizarre thing. People who know of Manos: The Hands of Fate still feel the need to mention how bad of a movie it is, then give it a 1 star rating as though they're shocked by that. If it weren't 'the worst movie ever made'  would it be given such a 5 star restoration and deluxe DVD release? THAT'S WHY THIS IS 5 STARS. The work done on the restoration, the commentaries, the cute puppet show, everything. This is the Criterion Collection version of ""the worst film ever made.""

Consider the low budget bad movies or just bad movies out there that have fallen through the cracks and will never be heard of again. ""The Brain Eaters"", ""Idaho Transfer"", ""The Last Shark"", these movies are lost but Manos is famously bad. Made famous of course by Mystery Science Theater 3000 in the early 1990's. For people who whine about bad movies, MST3K must be a thorn in their side because there's almost 200 movies that have a cult following that say ""C.C. and Company"" or the ""Curse of the Headless Horseman"" will never have.  It's almost a shame after seeing what has been done with one.

The movie and what is behind it is well known. The film was made on a bet. The writer, director, star had to make a movie to win the bet which he did. These are pictures and they are moving. A lot of the, I think excellent artwork by co-star Tom Neyman is on display. The lengthy screen time of the painting featuring the Master and his dog also the sculpture are good indications that the appreciation is shared with the filmmaker as well. The soundtrack is jazzy and works well throughout. As far as I could tell, there doesn't seem to be any of the canned incidental music floating around during the movie. (If you watch enough low budget films you will hear the same music and sound effects popping up often. Incredible Melting Man's music fills up almost half of the music used in Don Doher's Nightbeast is the most recent example I've heard. Others are Bill Rebane's sci fi/horror movies in the '70's.

Sync sound filming wasn't happening during this movie. You could call that an Italian approach to filmmaking. Every line of dialogue and every sound effect you hear is dubbed in later. Unlike Italian films though, Manos has maybe four people voicing the acting parts of all the character's seen on the screen. This gives the movie a leg up on some other low budget horror movies who dwell too heavily on narration which makes everything dull. Beast of Yucca Flats, Monstrosity, Creeping Terror, Monster A-Go Go are more dull than just bad.

 Low budget filmmaking is what it is. The shots aren't well framed, but you can't worry about retakes or reshooting, or complex setups or adequate blocking for the actors. Time is money. The filming is broken up in 30 second blocks as well. An equipment limitation. But the film is in color. I think that adds to this movie retaining an edge over a lot of films in this category.

This is a 5 star restoration. I put this release on the same level as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-She-Beast/dp/B001PMRBMW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The She-Beast</a>&nbsp;Both films were released with great care and attention to the quality of the print and presentation.

7344768,4,B012BD3RNU,"It's good to see such an odd film getting decent treatment. No, it's not a great movie & yes, it's often dreadfully dull. But it's also charming in a truly bizarre way - for those of you who have ever attempted to make your own movie you know how difficult it is now, & that difficulty must have been tremendous in the mid-60s. That this thing was ever even made is something of a miracle.

The blu-ray itself looks pretty good. There are still a lot of artifacts & lines... but did these ever not exist? According to the terrific documentary included (those who enjoy the Ballyhoo docs from the Shout! Factory MST3Ks will love it) only about 4 hours was spent on editing, which both helps explain the otherwise inexplicably lengthy driving scenes & indicates a total lack of interest in the finished project. My guess is that it already looked pretty bad on that day in '66 when it was first shown. Honestly, tho, it works here. Some films just don't need to look pristine.

Strangely, my favorite part of this release is the menu screen. It's genius in its simplicity: just driving footage & the theme song. Pretty much captures the spirit I'd say. You have the typical options to choose from: play, chapter, subtitles, and extras. If you have time please look thru the chapter titles; funny stuff there. Extras include a commentary from the master himself & his daughter, who played the little girl, Debbie, a short doc on the restoration, a preview of some puppet version of the story, the 1/2 hour Ballyhoo doc (necessary viewing), & on this blu-ray version, a 'grindhouse edition' of the movie.

Anyhoo, watching this sans riffs is an interesting experience. I'm surprised to say that I didn't feel like I missed them too much, maybe because the movie itself already felt like an old friend (& I've pretty much memorized the jokes) & I was comfortable with it. Not surprisingly the lack of riffs also made following the story a lot easier. For example, I somehow never understood the Master's feud with Torgo before, which, now that I've watched this, I know is essential to understanding the very last scene.

Manos: The Hands of Fate is a fascinating movie. I was hesitant about getting this but overall feel like it was a good decision. The extras, in particular, helped me to appreciate this oddball on its own merit by seeing it for what it is: an early example of an everyman going out & trying his hand at what was at the time still an enormous undertaking. If it failed, so what. It still makes for interesting viewing.",1444435200,15,2533,4.622222222222222
7344769,5,B012BD3RNU,"I picked up a copy of Manos: the Hands of Fate on blu ray a month before it hits the street date at the Horrorhound convention in Indianapolis. First of all, its needless to say that, yes, Manos falls into the unfortunate category of films labeled the ""worst films ever made."" However, much like the similar Plan 9 from Outer Space, even though Manos is a catalogue of things not to do when making a film, its so funny and has its own charm that it seems altogether too entertaining to really deserve to fall into a ""all time worst"" classification. For me, the repetitive dialogue, over the top yet stilted acting, aimless direction, terrible dubbing, and seedy cinematography only add to the nightmarish feel to it. Its like that fever dream you get when you take too much nyquil. I have to admit I saw this when I was ten and it really haunted me for years, seeing it again though was a laugh riot.
The Story? I am not sure if I can summarize easily what happens. A couple (writer-director Harold P. Warren and the beautiful Diane Mahree) and their young daughter (Jacky Neyman, I dare you to try and understand every word she mumbles) go on vacation and seem to trap themselves in the home of a cult leader (the Master, played by Tom Neyman, easily the best performance), occupied also by his many and catty wives (that fight scene does go on forever, and why?), and caretaker Torgo (half goat man, all weirdo, strangely adorable). To describe any further would be pointless, you just have to see it to believe or disbelieve it. Most people will recognize Manos as one of the most popular and identifiable films featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000, which pulled the film out of obscurity for years.
Now the blu ray itself? Outstanding. Picture and sound quality were painstakingly restored, and the effort shows. It looks as good as one can expect with lush colors and considerable clean up. The sound is as clear and loud as you can get for something that was made next to nothing. Don't believe me? Just compare the restored version with the included unrestored grind house version also included and you will see what I am getting at. Not perfect by any stretch by possibly the best looking Hands has ever looked. There is a great documentary included on the arguably more fascinating story of how Manos was made, with surviving cast members and historians weaving a story that really deserves its own telling. The commentary by Jacky and Tom Neyman is really quite charming. They are obviously average, down to earth people who seem to have accidentally made this film. Listening to them watch the film is like eavesdropping on them watching an old home movie. There is also a segment describing the restoration of Manos and another detailing a puppet adaptation, and thats not to be missed. I highly recommend for film collectors of bad and or cult cinema. The blu ray is fantastic. The film is literally unbelievable. Enjoy.",1443052800,41,2937,4.682785299806576

Heck, even a not-so-good B movie can be fun (The Monolith Monsters), but Manos: Hands of Fate hasn't got one redeeming quality.  Badly acted, badly directed, badly written.  It's just bad and not in a fun way.  If I could give negative stars, I would.",1495152000,,389,4.422535211267606

8725805,5,B012BD3RNU,"Don't be fooled by my 5-star rating.  This is one of the rock-bottom worst films of all time.  I merely wanted to express how strongly I approve of this restored version of a cult classic.  The end result is much higher quality than the DVD version could offer.  While everything looks better, this is especially notable in the poorly lit scenes (most of the film) where it was previously much more difficult to see what was going on.  The color is much richer than the DVD version.  It also makes some of the films original flaws more apparent; for example shots that were filmed out-of-focus are much more apparent now.
The audio quality is similarly improved to drastically reduce the annoying hissing sound you hear on old analog tapes, which were present in the DVD release.
Just to reiterate, this is a radical improvement over the previous release of the film.  Its a must-see for bad movie fans!",1489622400,,903,4.677215189873418
8725806,4,B012BD3RNU,"Perhaps one of the worst movies ever made, it became a cult classic thanks to the folks at Mystery Science Theater 3000.  This is the restored version of the film, and includes many extras.  MiSTies will love it, not least because they will finally be able to see why Torgo walked in such a weird fashion -- in the MST3K version, it was hidden behind the theater silhouettes.

The interviews with the surviving cast members really help the audience to understand how this debacle came about.  Well worth watching.",1476057600,4,513,4.730337078651686

The extra features are fantastic too. If you are a cult follower of this film deemed ""The Worst Film Ever Made"" you NEED this. I cannot wait for the sequel to come out!!!",1475193600,,326,4.190476190476191
8725808,5,B012BD3RNU,"Manos: The Hands of Fate, like Plan 9 From Outer Space before it and The Room after, is one of those preciously few bad films that, in its sheer, incomprehensible awfulness, acheives a sort of transcendence and becomes great.
As to the question of whether this is the best bad movie ever made, I would say it depends on how you define that. While I would say that The Room is slightly more entertaining from start to finish, Manos is definitely a worse film. While The Room was at least competently filmed for the most part, Manos is a mess on every level: inept acting, horrible voice dubbing, a laughable plot, repetitive dialogue, wooden choreography, a ridiculously loud and out of place score, and what appears to be a complete lack of editing make Manos the worst film I have ever seen. I mean, for God's sake, even the doberman can't act- this supposedly hell-spawned demon hound is often seen trying to play with the cast and crew, tail joyfully wagging.
I do not mean to suggest that Manos is not entertaining, becuase it's a riot, especially due to the character of Torgo, who probably surpasses Tommy Wiseau's Johnny as the strangest character in all of film, and one of the most unintentionally hilarious.
If you enjoy those bad movies that somehow achieve greatness, you should not miss Manos: The Hands of Fate, which, if you're Spanish is rusty, translates to Hands: The Hands of Fate. The title itself is a perfect primer for what's to come.

I should also comment that this is a fantastic Blu-ray edition of the film. On an superficial level, the cover art is really neat. If you didn't know any better, you might think you were about to watch a genuinely scary film. In addition to a miraculous restoration, this edition contains great extra features. I especially enjoyed the short documentary which utilizes interviews with some of the cast of Manos, as well as a film scholar, to shed some light on what went so hilariously wrong.
In a nutshell, Manos is an absurd and hilarious disaster, and this is a wonderful edition. Highly recommended.",1470873600,6,2062,4.71191135734072
