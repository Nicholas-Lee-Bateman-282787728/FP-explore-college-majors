5013971,4,B006QVRWD0,this dvd gave an interesting and widel coverage of the discovery of America. I liked the portrayal of the historical characters.,1359849600,6,128,5.142857142857143
5013972,5,B006QVRWD0,"absolutely loved it!!! I especially bought it for the video ""Desperate Crossing"" about the Mayflower voyage of my  Fuller Ancestors, but all of the films are outstanding! so happy to have it in my library!!",1355184000,18,206,4.885714285714286
5013973,3,B006QVRWD0,"Very informative; really great sets and locations; acting very ""B"", not convincing. I think THC tried to cover too much ground in too short a time. I'm sure they had budget constraints and they did the best they could, but the story is all narrated rather then devopling the characters in first perrson. It didn't make the story come alive. i was looking for something for my kids and this won't do it - at least not until they take American History in High School.",1426291200,2,465,4.482352941176471
5013974,4,B006QVRWD0,good basic information,1415404800,,22,6.666666666666667
5013975,4,B006QVRWD0,"All except the Southwest was excellent.  Over all, a good documented history of country.",1414713600,,88,5.285714285714286
5013976,3,B006QVRWD0,"This set is actually a collection of several different History Channel programs and/or series originally broadcast between 1995 and 2006. It is of variable interest and format.  The series that consists of four programs, THE SOUTHWEST, THE SOUTHEAST, THE NORTHEAST, and THE NORTHWEST was the best for me.  It is done with reenactments that have the production values of bigger- budget movies.  Each program runs approximately 45 minutes. There are also two ""Behind the Scenes"" shorter programs of about 22 minutes each.

The CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS program from 1995 has no reenactments.  It is in the older style of interviews with various experts, interspersed with illustrations where the camera starts at one point of a photo and then slowly pans across the entire photo or illustration.

GODSPEED TO JAMESTOWN is a documentary of the making of the modern-day replica of the ship, Godspeed, which came to Jamestown.

SECRETS OF JAMESTOWN is a 44-minute program which visits the location and interviews the people who work there.  However,  it has a fault in that there is so much loud ""music"" (so called) and general noisy sound effects that they often drown out what the speaker is saying.

DESPERATE CROSSING, about the first voyage of the ""Mayflower"" is quite slow at first as it examines the religious turmoil of England that drove the participants first to Holland and then to Jamestown.  It is also done in reenactments.  However for me, the English accents of the actors, who too often spoke in whispers or hushed tones that were often drowned out by the loud background ""music"" and sound effects, was a most annoying and distracting feature of the program.  This is a problem with many movies and TV programs of more recent years.  Why do the directors think the actors should whisper their lines, and at the same time cover up the dialogue with loud sound effects?  Most annoying.

I gave this set three stars for being sometimes quite interesting, and other times annoying.",1412380800,13,1984,4.984802431610942
5013977,2,B006QVRWD0,"The story telling was there. But the production was how shall I say? Meh.
Surprising amount of gore in places. Was going to use as a teaching tool for homeschool and utterly abandoned it.. It was putting all of us to sleep.",1395100800,9,223,4.333333333333333
5013978,5,B006QVRWD0,"I watch these when there's nothing on TV and I'm too tire to read.  They are always a pleasant surprise...when I think of them as a last resort.  They're really not.  They are set into segments, so are perfect for incrementally watching.",1394236800,,237,4.595238095238095
5013979,5,B006QVRWD0,It is nice to fill your DVD library with historical depictions that can be viewed over and over again.  Now the grandchildren have the documentaries to enjoy.,1392595200,4,158,4.851851851851852
5013980,4,B006QVRWD0,This is another interesting series from the History channel.  I would recommend this to anyone who is an aspiring history buff and interested in the basic history of early America.,1390089600,2,180,5.0
5013981,5,B006QVRWD0,"thanks  for good media..

5013982,5,B006QVRWD0,The history channel has really come a long way in how they format and have restyled their films.  It's no longer that boring type of documentaries but something that a person can really engage.,1382832000,4,193,4.676470588235294

8503312,5,B006QVRWD0,"Who new, I saw this on History channel . Had to have it to view again . Never know when the Grandkids might ask about a bridge  . May be I would have learned in high school rather then dropping out . I got a GED, but it's not the same .The older one gets, the more you want to self educate . This is not a boring CD.",1452556800,,316,3.579710144927536

8503314,4,B006QVRWD0,"A decent documentary though, like most documentaries, misses out on so much more! If you want an extensive documentary about the conquest of America, this is not it though it does take a glance at several areas",1442016000,,210,4.702702702702703
8503315,5,B006QVRWD0,Good,1433548800,,4,4.0
8503316,5,B006QVRWD0,I love this set if youer a history teacher youer students will love it too. But the documentary on christopher Columbus was too old and I was disappointed it was not up to date. It reminds me of the kind of videos I would watch in class as a kid and would bore me. So that part I would not recommend that for youer class to watch. But the rest of the set is life like and takes you back to the past.,1432080000,,399,3.819277108433735
