8289256,5,B001CU7M08,"The book is very interesting account of a real life western law officer in a modern time. Ed Cantrell was charged with the murder of one of his police officers and Gerry Spence is able to raise enough doubt to get Cantrell off of the charges.

I have met Cantrell, though briefly, and found him to be a very interesting person who could have been responsible for the charged crime and the way Spence is able to raise enough doubt will surprise you.

An Excellent DVD.",1371427200,,467,4.4186046511627906
