4853004,5,B005OK0YNY,"Rozen Maiden is a delightful anime about a boy with an addiction to ordering things online, and then returning them before the grace period ends. Then one day, an unusual delivery appears. It is a doll. And it is alive.

The colors are rich, the characters amusing, the imagery quaint, and the music stirring.

I originally watched Rozen Maiden online, and was thrilled with this DVD collection. One may watch in English or Japanese, and there are also subtitles for both languages. The English voice-overs have been left as they can be found online. This set includes the entire first season, second season, and overture.

As I was watching the DVD my younger brothers meandered in, and after a few days I could not watch an episode without them huffing at me for starting it without them. Yes. Teenage boys.

The tale does end ""unresolved"", but not in a way that leaves the watcher feeling unsatisfied.

On the whole, this collection of Rozen Maiden merits five stars from me AND my teenage brothers.",1340928000,,1002,4.76878612716763
4853005,5,B005OK0YNY,"I ordered this supposedly for a DVD collection. I watched Rozen Maiden via online streaming, so I pretty much know what to expect with the story line. It has a genius plot which includes 8th grader Jun Sakurada who pretty much secluded himself from the world thus refusing to go to school. He became addicted to online shopping as well as promos. He'd buy a certain item and he decides if he should give it back or keep it. He came across a ""survey"", which was actually Shinku's little scheme to get a host. The day after he answered the survey, a fancy box came to his doorstep and forever changed his life.

Anyway, I am impressed with the shipping. When I purchased this item, it was said that it will SHIP on the 14th of MAY and should arrive around the 24th. Well, guess what? Amazon moved it earlier and shipped the next day I purchased it and the expected delivery date became what used to be the ship date. To add all that it came 3 days early. Instead of getting this item on the 14th, I got it on the 11th (today). I'm really satisfied as far as the shipping goes as well as the packaging.

THIS IS THE COMPLETE SERIES. That means it includes Seasons 1 and 2, as well as the Overtures.",1336694400,14,1195,4.259911894273127
4853006,5,B005OK0YNY,"The Rozen Maidens are a series of living dolls engaged in a contest, The Alice Game. The winner gets to become Alice,  a girl without blemish and without equal. Perfect. They also get to see father. The losers are forced to give up their  ability to commune with a medium at best and are turned into junk at worst. A young boy with a serious social phobia is always on his computer, collecting oddities and checking out supposedly cursed or magical items. He sends them back before having to pay, getting to experience the gimmick without the cost. When he receives a letter asking ""Will you wind it,"" he checks yes and finds himself suddenly thrust into the job of a medium, with a connection to a living doll.

On the surface, this anime sounds like one that would involve a lot of battles and would mainly delve into combat. The dolls do fight, mainly with one of their number specifically, but seldom do the fights really push The Alice Game. Mainly you deal with the boy, his growing connection to a group of Rozen Maidens and his fear of the world and the concern his sister has for him.

At first, our main character and his Rozen Maiden have issues with one another, but they grow closer with the passage of time. Other Maidens are introduced through a series of episodes, and some bring specialized tools or gifts that allow us to delve more deeply into the main boy's psyche. This helps explain what transpired and it also does something different with a storyline in an anime and I enjoyed that.

This is not to say the show is all seriousness with fighting on the side. Many of the episodes are dedicated to humor. Even in the serious ones, pieces are reserved for humor. For example, The Maidens watch a show about a pet detective on TV almost each episode, ""dolls watching a puppet show,"" and it is pretty funny stuff. I actually would have liked a few episodes of it, honestly, because it was funny and graphic.

This is a good 5/5 as long as you know what type of show it is and do not expect a lot of fighting outright. You get to know the characters and their connections to each other, and hints of a greater destiny for our main are hinted at in the latter half of the series.
An enjoyable watch, noting of course the length of the series only hits at about 5 hours, with 12 episodes.",1330473600,4,2304,4.409411764705882

4853055,3,B005OK0YNY,"This DVD set includes ""Rozen Maiden"" (12 Episodes),  ""Rozen Maiden: Traumend"" (12 Episodes) and Rozen Maiden: Overture"" (2 Episodes).
It does not include ""Rozen Maiden: Zuruckspulen"".

In some episodes, there is something wrong with the picture at the right side. The voices are pitched a little bit to high for my ears. This production comes in standard 4:3, not wide.

The discs are Region 1 only, although the cover does not indicate it. (Please keep in mind: Region Codes do not have any other value other than being a nuisance to the customer.)

It is rated TV-14. In my personal opinion it wouldn't be harmful for a slighly younger audience. However, I prefer Animes, where there are multiple levels of storytelling. Here we have the short stories, each episode tells, the long story-arch around the Alice Game and the interaction between the characters, leading to the question: why am I born and some ethical discussions. Well, you may have to look for it and I would have prefered more on that level instead of fighing. As an adult you may see a different story than your teenager, but that actually makes it familiy compatible.
However, don't expect too much from it. It is worth watching it. Not a Hayao Miyazaki masterpiece but also a lot more than the average bulk Anime. Did I enjoy it? Yes! Would I buy it again? yes!",1446854400,,1332,4.728448275862069

4853085,4,B005OK0YNY,"Story starts with Jun Sakurada buying & returning items he buys on the internet, he answers an Ad about a dimensional entity then finds a Doll Box on his bedroom floor. They mention Jun is in Intermediate School (Junior High), his older sister Nori most likely attends high school. Their parents work overseas so Nori has become a substitute parent.  Shinku aka his Rozen Maiden, is a snobbish female doll that isn't afraid to punish anyone she wants. The story is a bit funny given that the main character is a young boy who feels like an outcast and now because he swore an oath, he becomes a Victorian Age Female Doll's Medium and has to hold her like a parent does a young child.  When she goes into combat she uses his life energy to defeat her opponents. Only watched up to Episode 3, but if Jun has to carry Shinku outside and around town or to school.... the poor guy's already an outcast...

The story slowly reveals the characters to the viewers giving you a bit more into their background.  It's not a fast paced movie, you will need a large bowl of popcorn and some drinks to watch.  As it is Subtitled you're going to have to read.  If you enjoy subtle puns, dry humor or dolls this anime gives you them all. Kind of draws you in, more and more as you want to see what's next. Poor Jun surrounded by females both human and dolls.",1411516800,2,1342,4.348

4853096,5,B005OK0YNY,"One thing that gets top ratings from me is character development. This series certainly has that. It's a story of love, hate, power, family and kindness. It has its share of comedy also. I'd recommend this to anyone who loves a good story.",1374105600,,239,4.5813953488372094

4853098,1,B005OK0YNY,I am only giving this a one because of how I got it. This anime is amazing and its in good condition. Everything was fine except for the fact that the package that my product came in was open. The product could have fallen out and to me it just doesn't feel like this was packaged securely at all. I am highly disappointed.,1361491200,,323,4.142857142857143
4853099,4,B005OK0YNY,"Honestly. i thought rozen maiden would be one of those kind of animes that i would never end up watching or being caught dead with it.
why? you ask?, because i am a guy...who would be only be interested in anime's like bleach or soul eater, hellsing, samurai seven or champloo etc. but i couldn't stop kidding myself that i really have a love and passion for japanese animation & comics, i'm just a regular old otaku like everybody else. so i taken one step closer to other anime's like lucky star, azu manga daioh, suzuka & many more title's that has to offer for me to watch or see & just like that.i ended up watching rozen maiden with online streaming & without realizing it & BOOM!, i love it!!! & i want the dvd's!...but...here's a problem, getting each individual DVD of rozen maiden can be bit of a problem, but not only they are little hard to find, but a little pricey for a broke college student like myself,i can only get my hand's on volume one & two of the original dvd's of rozen maiden, but i have a hard time finding the third volume & thats when i ran into the complete series!,

I became completely excited over this box set only to discover something very different, that i never thought i'll ever see.according to box cover reading & saying that it has rozen maiden: ""traumend"" & ""ouverture"". at first i thought i was looking at the wrong dvd's or box.but it's saying it's complete & by saying complete. they mean it & i was blown away by it. now i have another problem. is it? the dvds?. nope. is it the anime? nope.is it fake? copies? nope. IT'S THE DVD CASE! ITSELF!. It isn't broken or anything & the cover art looks good & beautiful & all. IT'S THE STACKED UP DISKS!.I dunno why they do have to stacked up the disc in such a very awkward angle to the point when you release the disc & feels it doh you're about to break the disc itself no matter how careful you are & it's just a matter of time before it doe's. but honestly they either did this to save money or just being plain old cheap, butworse of all it has a thick & hideous looking piece of plastic styrofoam!, but i didn't suffer this problem before, this happen to me when i bought the azu manga daioh complete dvds,would it kill them to at least put a nice looking manual? but enough said. lets get to the point of this review.

Unfortunately rozen maiden doesn't have a very strong point at the beginning episodes & it takes about maybe two or three or more episodes to try to get into the anime & was it worth it?....yes....it's worth it!, rozen maiden has a nice charm, it's warm & it's common & you see doll's having laughs, eating cake, all bright with great joy. but this anime has a very strong dark & gothic atmospheric with characters with psychological issues & some problems, so this anime may be not very inappropriate for young children.but let's put aside dolls ripping limps out of each other. rozen maiden leaves me completely breathless with a very confusing yet satisfying meaning till the very end,
with very nice beautiful victorian era music that blends in very well in todays modern society & the 3D or CG animations goes very well with each individual doll magic or powers.everything just blends in nicely. there are some little flaws here & there, but judging at looking at each doll. they are just covered with nothing but details & different patternsof their each of their dresses & hair witch looks like alot work to do, but they still pull it off very nicely. i would love to give a nice spanking ""five out five"" stars but because of the dvd case it doesn't do justice for that last star,

So?. let me ask you this question. would rather spent 40$ dollars? over two volumes dvds like i did?
or would you rather spent that same almost exact price with 12 Original dvds 12 Season two dvds & 2: OVA? ...I rest my case...",1360022400,,3832,4.379213483146067
8481437,2,B005OK0YNY,The main character is whiny and selfish. The main storyline represents some pedofile's fantasy of having a child delivered at their doorway which will later become a servant to protect her master.

8481438,3,B005OK0YNY,"I think there are producers out there who would make live action films like this if they weren't afraid of the inevitable outcry from people who see pedophilia in the most innocent works.
