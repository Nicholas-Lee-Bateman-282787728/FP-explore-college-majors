8496671,5,B006D3I9PG,"A great DVD about the various locomotives seen in and around Vienna.  I rode from Stuttgart, through Mnchen to Wien, in late summer 2013.  All the trains I rode and saw are here.  If you never have the opportunity to travel to this region, or want a momento of your travels there, this DVD is for you.  It is richly recorded and narrated just enough to give you a rich experience.",1412208000,,380,4.309859154929577
