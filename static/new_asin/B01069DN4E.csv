7305093,2,B01069DN4E,too much talking.....and not a lot of actions,1445558400,,45,4.75
7305094,5,B01069DN4E,"LK is the sequel to 'The Four' and even better action- and stunt-wise. It's a trilogy and the 'The Four 3"" is out but not yet on Amazon. Looking forward to it.",1444608000,4,159,4.0
7305095,3,B01069DN4E,"Am..it was OK, no t much fighting, mostly a bunch of unnecessary emotional Drama. If you want action, look else where.",1444435200,,118,4.666666666666667

7305098,5,B01069DN4E,"Great movie. It's part 2 of The Four. If you like wuxia and don't mind wire-fu and cgi then give it a try. Basically a Chinese kung fu super heroes movie. It's ok as a stand alone movie, the characters were giving proper introductions in part one, but it's a lot better viewing it as it was intended as a trilogy.",1443830400,7,313,4.147540983606557
7305099,5,B01069DN4E,"Loved it..
Just as good (if not better) than ""The Four"".",1442534400,,56,4.181818181818182
7305100,1,B01069DN4E,"Okay, I have not seen this film, but I did look at the trailer and read the blurb on the back of the box and figured something out.

This is actually, The Four 2. I know what you're thinking, Why would they release the film under an alternate title and not tell anybody that this is a sequel?

I have no idea,

I mean, I have an inkling of an idea as to what's actually going on here. I don't think the original film The Four was terribly well-received. So, whoever is pushing this out there because they already have the license for it and it's lord knows how many years it's been out now for awhile and etc. but they're just trying to get your money.

So, you could buy this film, if you've already seen The Four or you could walk in blind and watch this one and be left scratching your head at all the seeming developed characters and relationships and storylines and wonder what's really going on. Or y'know, you could search to see if The Four trilogy of films is already available on Amazon under their original titles.

I know what I'm going to do.",1442275200,,1055,4.255
7305101,5,B01069DN4E,Good martial arts movie. The women were good. showed an ancient period when martial arts school ran things. I enjoyed it.,1485475200,,121,4.809523809523809

7305112,4,B01069DN4E,OK,1468800000,,2,2.0
7305113,4,B01069DN4E,"So I tried to watch The Four, which is part one to this movie but the subtitles never showed up.  I imagine that The Four is an origin style story of the heroes.  Anyhow, what if I said that you could watch the X-Men and a cool Kung Fu movie at the same time?  Well this it what it's like.  I didn't expect much from it but it was very cool for what it was.  It would be really be cool to see if they had a bigger budget on visual effects but they do get the job done.  The ending really brought the drama!  I don't want to tell you what happens but I'll say that when the good guys win... they still lose.

So if you're a fan of super hero movies and old school kung movies you'll dig this!  Worth the rental for a trip down memory lane of the Saturday afternoon Kung Fu double feature.

You'll dig this if you liked 47 Ronin, Shadowless Sword, X-Men, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon:Sword of Destiny, Shinobi:Heart Under Blade.",1468627200,7,927,4.128491620111732

7305115,2,B01069DN4E,"I didn't realize this was part of a trilogy when I ordered this movie.  That may be a big part to why I didn't enjoy this movie.  Too many characters, the plot was hard to follow, the ending was unsatisfying.  I would NOT recommend watching this as a stand along movie.  Maybe if you watch the first movie of the trilogy first, this MIGHT be worth watching.",1465948800,4,357,4.2835820895522385

7305133,3,B01069DN4E,This movie was difficult to follow. It seemed to begin in the middle and then work its way to an ending that tied back to the beginning. It does not end the way most western movies do.,1449878400,3,184,4.0

8721404,5,B01069DN4E,I loved all three of these movies---have watched them over and over--my problem was I thought there was to be four of them ---now that I know there will be just three of them I do wish the last one --Kingdom of Blood--would have ended a little different.  I will continue to watch them because the actors are very good--love the special effects.  If they ever remake these films I do hope they will make the last one longer and have more closure at the end.  If they are made from a book they might not be able too,1506988800,,514,4.171717171717172
