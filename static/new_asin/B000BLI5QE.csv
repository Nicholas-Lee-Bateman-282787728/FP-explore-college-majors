2423572,5,B000BLI5QE,"I have no idea why they compare this to the shield, and I agree with the other reviews, in the fact that if you like the shield, then this isn't the best movie choice for you.  This is though a docu-drama, based on real events from one persons point of view.  For those people really interested on the comings and goings of NSW cops then I suggest some of the books written, namely by the cop who was shot.  I enjoy this movie as an Australian for the attention to detail of Sydney back in the late 70's early 80's.  I feel sorry for you Yanks who can't understand our version of english, and I agree subtitles would be helpful.  This movie though is for Australians and I wouldn't recommend it to people from any overseas country.  I would like to point out as well, that thanks to cops like the ones depicted in this movie, NSW (New South Wales) police have virtually no power nowadays, which unfortunately has led to a decline in good public behaviour.",1140048000,12,955,4.367231638418079
2423573,1,B000BLI5QE,"WHAT ARE THEY SAYING! THE TRAILER WAS SO MISLEADING! WHAT ICE-T AND THE TUNE BODY COUNT?! THE ACCENT IS SOOOOOOO THICK, IT GAVE ME A HEADACHE! AND WHO THE HELL COMPARED THIS WITH THE SHOW ""THE SHIELD""? THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO COMPARISION! WASTED 35 BUCKS!",1138060800,2,254,4.666666666666667
2423574,1,B000BLI5QE,"This may have been a good show down in Australia, but for this Yank it was utterly incomprehensible.  I usually don't have much problem with ""Aussiespeak"", however I suspect much of the talk was slang.  It didn't help that the dialog wasn't mixed all that well -- the 2.0 track was better than the 5.1, but not by much. I cannot understand how the US distributor didn't see the need for subtitles.  Without them it could have been in any long dead or obscure language, not English as we speak it here in the States.",1135641600,5,515,4.4

2423576,1,B000BLI5QE,"The reason I bought this dvd was because it was compared to The Shield. NOt a chance.  Aside from the very corny storyline (first two hours anyway), even though it was in English (somewhat) it was very hard to undersand. And there was no close caption..  I suffered through almost two hours and then just had to stop watching.  I don't know whose idea it was to compare it to the Shield, but to me this was a total waste of $41.00.",1135555200,5,431,4.2317073170731705
8088654,4,B000BLI5QE,"I remember the stories in the newspapers, and this was prettty much as I remember.  Was really hoping to see more about Sallie Anne, which is why only 4 stars.  Totally enjoyed.  I also recommend Underbelly about crime in Melbourne.  Both part of Australia's criminal history, way more current than Ned Kelly!
Technical note, had no problems with the format, played perfectly in the USA.",1437091200,,387,4.907692307692308
8088655,1,B000BLI5QE,"Sadly I can't write a review on this dvd set as  I haven't been able to watch it. I found out that dvd's play in certain regions, unfortunately this dvd was not made to watch in the Australian region, I am making enquiries to see if there is any way this can be changed so I can watch it. I am sure the movies would be excellent, I hope I do one day get to watch them.",1414886400,,368,3.779220779220779
8088656,5,B000BLI5QE,"Don't let the thick aussie accents and wobbly production values fool you, 'Blue Murder' predates 'The Shield' by some 7 years and is based on an incredible true story, it's an absolute jackhammer of a cops and robbers saga and one of Australian televisions finest achievements.

And considering the mainly diabolical state of the Oz film industry over the last decade, 'Blue Murder' is better than most Aussie films.

The acting is top drawer, with Richard Roxburgh and Tony Martin vividly bringing to life two of Sydney most famous underworld figures of the 80's. Roxburgh is uncanny as Sydney's most decorated cop Roger Rogerson, who seems as ruthless and cold blooded as the crims he pursues, especially when he gives lethal heroin dealer Neddy Smith (Martin) a 'Green Light' to run amok with robberies and drug deals (only caveat: Neddy can't shoot cops) while Rogerson and his cronies get a cut of the spoils.

It's electrifying stuff with many bloody passages of shocking violence punctuated with pitch black gallows humor. Martin is all animal menace as uber crim Neddy Smith. In fact he and Roxburgh's bizarre simpatico bromance is the strangely affecting amid the mayhem.

The rest of the cast is fantastic, especially look for Gary Sweet as barking mad hitman Christopher ""Mr Rent-A-Kill"" Flannery, stealing scenes, no mean feat when you see how brilliant Roxburgh and Martin are.

Highly recommended.",1349740800,3,1411,5.090909090909091
8088657,5,B000BLI5QE,"Blue Murder is so accurate and well acted, it could almost be classed as a documentary. It explores the true life close ties between organised crime and the police in Sydney, Australia from the 1970s through the 1980s. The outrageous behaviour is mesmerising and the characters, both good and bad, are compelling. It's well cast, well written and well acted.  Blue Murder is for anyone who enjoys the stories from the seedier side of society, but doesn't necessarily need their characters to speak with American accents.",1222905600,5,520,5.046511627906977
8088658,1,B000BLI5QE,"This is NOT like The Shield at all. Blue Murder is hokey and dated with a very low budget feel. The dialect/language is hard to understand and the action is mostly non-existent. I understand the dynamic relationship these two men had but I don't care. Neither are very interesting and the show as a whole - which has been resurrected because of the BRILLIANCE of The Shield - is a poor and cheap comparison. I know the creator of The Shield said he got many ideas from Blue Murder but quite frankly he does a much better job with those ideas than the original series. Blue Murder lacks charisma, and interesting characters. One reason I am upset about Blue Murder is that it is VERY expensive to get here in the USA and the show just wasn't up to par compared to normal US television. It is hard to describe the show if you haven't seen it but it's almost has a soap opera or stage play feel to it and it is tediously boring.",1178064000,,925,4.291428571428572
8088659,4,B000BLI5QE,"To compare this to the Shield is like comparing an apple to an banana. The Shield while good is a fantasy with Vic and his crewe getting away with criminal behavour by the skin of their teeth week after week. In fact the problem with the Shield is that it requires the rest of the LAPD to be completly stupid for Vic to keep getting away with it. Also the break up of his family aside Vic suffers no comeback for all his crimes. Although the strain does show of Lem.

Blue Murder on the other hand is based on true events, that is the relationship between Roger Rogerson, Sydney's most decorated cop and Neddy Smith a bank robber, drug dealer, murderer and rapist. What Blue Murder shows is that despite all the money they earn together it comes at a price. Both men fall apart under the influence of alcohol and the strain of the life they lead.

I note that many Americans have trouble with the Australian dialect and slang, well so do we Brits, but it should not stop anyone enjoying Blue Murder for what it is, a well written, well acted, realistic drama based on true events. Whats more in Blue Murder when someone gets shot it hurts.

I am a fan of both the Shield and Blue Murder and there is no need or even reason to compare them to each other. Would you compare Bonanza to Happy Days?",1168300800,5,1294,4.295081967213115
8088660,5,B000BLI5QE,"Blue Murder is a dramatisation of real life events that occurred in New South Wales and which caused Royal Commission investigation and subsequent restructure of the NSW Police as a result. To say the storyline was 'corny' is a ludicrous comment.

Other than that, it is an excellent presentation, with top class acting and production.",1155168000,4,335,5.090909090909091
8088661,5,B000BLI5QE,"""Blue Murder"" is simply one of the finest pieces of filmmaking ever.

The direction, scripting, casting and editing are all top notch. Performances from the lead actors, down to the bit players, are all outstanding.

Those who didn't like it, need their heads read.

Those who had trouble understanding what was being said, should put in the effort and try harder.

The commentary track with Director Mike Jenkins, Editor Bill Russo and Filmmaker Mark Savage is really excellent, providing a great insight into the behind-the-scenes making of this true aussie classic. All are very talkative with lots of interesting things to discuss and chat about.

""Blue Murder"" is an amazing piece of work.",1145836800,6,694,5.106194690265487
8088662,5,B000BLI5QE,"To compare this masterpiece to a fictional TV show is pretty pathetic. This is simply one of the best movies I have ever seen & if our US brothers have trouble understanding the queens english then that is their problem.

Those that lived through the times & experienced the corrupotion first hand (such as myself) know that this is as real as it gets & as dirty as it comes.

Maybe some of you actually thought it was a fictional movie or something.

Anyway ***** is not high enough.",1145404800,10,484,4.415730337078652
