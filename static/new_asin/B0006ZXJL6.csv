8044341,5,B0006ZXJL6,"I loved this dvd, it's the best out of 1,2,and 3 of Spiral. The conclusion to Ayumu's showdown with Rio made me so happy, I was laughing, and I was so proud of Hiyono. I mean usually the lead female character gets kidnapped and the main character has to save her. Which happened, but Hiyono returned the favor!!  The Outtakes weren't as funny as before, probably because of the nerdy laugh track inserted after each voice actor messed up. Which wasn't a very bright idea for whoever inserted it, because with more soft spoken characters like Eyes Rutherford, you couldn't hear him because the laughter track was too loud. The voice acting got even better, all the voices fit the characters except for poor Kanone, he has this terrible voice with a horrible accent. Anyway, I loved the little romance in the episodes and there was even more comedy and a little less drama, thankfully. Over all Spiral is an incredible anime that every anime fan should see.",1122768000,2,955,4.684523809523809
8044342,3,B0006ZXJL6,"I am not a big fan of mystery movies, anime, shows, or anything. But overall, Spiral is not so bad.

A boy by the name of Ayumu Narumi is searching for his long lost brother, who's location is unknown. He all of a sudden finds himself being involved in the Mystery of the ""Blade Children"" who were originally investigated by his older brother.

They also know nothing of the current state and location of Kiyotaka Narumi.

This is a story of great mystery and suspense. Everyone seems to be hunting after the same thing, and yet no one knows which.

My title does not say ""almost good and yet"" for nothing, because some things in this story are simply ridiculous which mostly include a girl named Hiyono. Now if you have seen Fruits Basket, she could be compared to Tohru, but ten times worse.

She squeals, she yells, she annoys, basically she's a nuisance. If you like that, that's fine by me, but if you'd rather save yourself the pain and headache, I'd say skip this anime and buy something else.

The plot itself is interesting, but once again, some characters are just not to my liking. And the fact that everyonr calls Ayumu ""Little Narumi"" only because they are all familiar with his older brother, is just plain annoying.

If you like mystery, this anime might appeal to you, if not, don't waste your time.

Thanks,

8044343,5,B0006ZXJL6,"ok, so, what to say about this series. the words ""awesome"", ""outstanding"", and ""excellent"" come to mind.

Narumi Ayumu-kun feels that he lives in his brother Kiyotaka's shadow. He doesn't try very hard at things because he feels that everything does comes out as an imitation of his brother. However, Ayumu's brother went missing two years ago, off to search out the truth behind the mystery of the Blade Children. When Ayumu meets up with the Blade Children on his own, he is tested. Why? Because according to the Blade Children themselves, Kiyotaka believes that Ayumu is the key to saving the cursed Blade Children. Can he really do it?

This series is a great detective series. Anyone who enjoys(or has even just seen) the series Detective Conan, I mean ""Case Closed"", will be able to enjoy this series. It covers topics like recovering from a loss(confidence-wise or other), believing in yourself and your convictions, believing in and helping others, and finding a place in the world to be happy.

Sounds sappy and sentimental right? Well, yeah, that part did, lol, but here's another part! The clues and cleverness are all there! Several times I found myself laughing because the sneaky part of my brain figured out the trick before the character did. ^_^ It was fun. ^_^ And, from a girl's perspective, the guys in this show are great-looking, or perhaps the word ""hot"" is better, lol. On the other hand, for you guys, the girls in this series are just a cool! I have great respect for Hiyono(go episode 7!). Her skills and personality are crucial throughout the series. ^_^

Ok, a few last details. The opening is addictively upbeat, fun, and cool. Hiyono's puppet-show episode previews are funny. And remember, for all you aspiring anime otaku's out there, it may be dubbed, but don't forget to watch it in the original Japanese(subtitled of course), at least once. The dub can be good, but the original will always be better! And for people who are already anime fans, guess what?! That whole ""one outfit per character"" rule? Doesn't apply! They actually change outfits, lol.

Watch Spiral!",1106697600,4,2101,4.85754189944134
