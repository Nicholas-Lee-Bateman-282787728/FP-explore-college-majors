This workout programm makes you burn twice the amount of calories as you cannot stop laughing whole exercises. After a few weeks of training I am getting fitter and look forward to my Training sessions. Definitely worth it!",1517961600,,257,5.0
8619342,5,B00FXYJADG,"If you enjoyed her tv show, you will love this video! It's an easy going workout with a lot of comedy. If you love Miranda Hart as much as I do, then you should probably buy this!",1476489600,,179,3.864864864864865
8619343,2,B00FXYJADG,"This is ridiculous. If you are a Miranda Hart fan then you might be able to tolerate this. If you aren't a fan of Hart stay far away from this ""workout"" dvd. It's not ""such fun"".",1471996800,,178,3.9722222222222223
8619344,5,B00FXYJADG,"Wonderful woman, and she deserves as much praise as her admirers could muster!",1421020800,6,78,5.076923076923077
8619345,5,B00FXYJADG,"Such Fun! Just enjoyable to play with. Lightens a otherwise crappy day, and does get you moving. ""Fun-ness"" (that last part will only make sense if you watch the video)",1411344000,7,168,4.633333333333334
8619346,5,B00FXYJADG,"This DVD is amazing.  Not only is the workout great, but the comedy is fantastic.  I've never had so much fun working out and boy is it a workout!  I even bought maracas which only aided in the fun.  Great job Miranda!",1409702400,7,218,4.119047619047619
8619347,5,B00FXYJADG,"Like all things Miranda Hart, this video doesn't disappoint. There are a few skits and guest appearances from her sitcom, as well as a workout with the Rainer doing harder moves and Miranda doing an easier version. I sat and watched it the first time like it was a sitcom and enjoyed it that way, too.",1399680000,6,301,4.392857142857143
8619348,5,B00FXYJADG,As far as workouts go this will stack up with the best of them and give you a few laughs along the way. Miranda Hart has clearly taken her own advice and looks happy and healthy as she works hard alongside the qualified instructor. The workout has a full range of intensity from low impact to full cardio. There are even instructions on how to make your own maracas. It is fun to see Tom Ellis and the rest of the crew drop in for parts of the workout and there's enough heat between Ellis and Hart to titillate the fans of the couple in the sitcom. The focus is on the fitness though so don't buy it for the story line. Loved it. Such fun.,1395187200,14,640,4.087301587301587
