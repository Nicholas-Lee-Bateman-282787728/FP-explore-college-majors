4735346,4,B005LAII1C,"MOVIE REVIEW #40: "" Ted ""

Like most films these days, this films only real downside is it's ""R"" rating. Justifiably so - due to the language, sexual innuendos and drug related humor - however - (and also other than this film moving a tiny bit slow in the middle - pace wise) - it was very funny and quite `real' for me. And, surprisingly it had a really big - slightly tear-jerking heart at the end of it all.

Writers Alec Sulkin (Family Guy, The Cleveland Show) Wellesley Wild (Family Guy) and Seth McFarlane (Creator of Family Guy, The Cleveland Show) all set out to do one thing in my opinion - make something that is completely a fantasy - seem completely real. They succeeded in a most hysterical way.

The story tells the tale that back in 1985, as a young boy, John Bennett played spot-on by Mark Wahlberg (Boogie Nights, The Fighter), who wanted nothing more than for his beloved teddy bear Ted (MacFarlane) to come to life. Incredibly, that wish was granted. But now that John grown up, his boyhood dream has become a nightmare nuisance. The plot has everything going for it -  including the passionate Mila Kunis (Black Swan, That 70's Show) playing his girlfriend convincing him that growing up is part of life and even, Joel McHale (Spider-man, Community) as Mila's overly sexed boss trying to get her to loose Wahlberg as a boyfriend - to even the hysterically psychotic Giovanni Ribisi (Avatar, Saving Private Ryan) who is stalking John and wants that Teddy Bear for himself and his not so normal son!

A real fun and nostalgic moment occurs when John and Ted meet their long-term childhood idol, former US Marine turned actor - Sam J. Jones (actually playing himself from the 1979 movie classic Flash Gordon) - who turns up in some drug induced fantasy sequence. The audience was bursting in laughter (and rock group Queen's original music too)!

The film has, action, suspense and just a little too much drama in the middle - but the comedy, slapstick style humor and witty dialogue keep you laughing out loud throughout the movie! Even then un-credited, but familiar, voice of Patrick Stewart (Star Trek:TNG, Excalibur), narrates the film at the beginning and end using a few hysterically chosen quips and words himself.

A few other cameos include; Patrick Warburton (How I Met Your Mother, Hercules) as Johns workmate, Ryan Reynolds (The Green Lantern, The Proposal) as - you'll have to see it to know this, Tom Skerritt (Tom Gun, Alien) as the many time mentioned `friend' of everyone appparently and singer/songwriter Nora Jones herself (Made in Manhattan, Love Actually) as herself helping John express his love to Mila.

Finally I must applaud director Seth McFarlane for doing bolding what he does best, taking a satirical look at real life and commenting on the various things we all think about - but don't say out loud as much as we would like to. From celebrities to religion - nothing is off limits or sacred and almost everything is off-color. But it is fun and funny.

The best surprise and unexpectedly, what that by the end of the film - McFarlane pulls yours heart string - and does it very effectively. This film is definitely not for children - but if you enjoy The Family Guy, Simpsons and American Dad type of humor - you'll love this one! I do - and I did!",1341187200,6,3297,4.6706896551724135
4735347,3,B005LAII1C,"Well, ""21 Jump Street"" still gets my vote for best comedy of 2012.

""Ted"" is just like Jason Siegal's version of the Muppet Movie, except with breasts, curse-words, drugs, alcohol, teddy bear/human sex, and Borat-style non-PC humor.  It's a decent movie, but since most of the humor comes from shock value alone (remember the humor from Hangover Part II?), you're not going to find yourself putting this in your list of all-time greats.

One of the problems this movie has is that Mark Wahlberg isn't a good comedic actor. He was OK in ""The Other Guys' but here he's barely tolerable.  He doesn't do well interacting with the inanimate object of the teddy bear.  Mila Kunis is terrific, but after her the best acting comes from Sam Jones...the guy who played Flash Gordon back in the early 1980s.  The plot is the same as last year's Muppet Movie.  Boy and stuffed animal are friend.  Boy grows up and meets girl.  Girl wants boy to stop hanging out with stuffed animal and spend time with her.

This was fun, but could have been better.  I expect lots of negative feedback since this is one of the few 3-star reviews of Ted.",1341187200,,1125,4.575
4735348,5,B005LAII1C,"Except, maybe the advertising should be a little more explicit. This is not for kids. That took some of the fun out of it for me. There were two couples in the theater with children around 8 or 9. The trailers are so cute with a cuddly teddy bear, but for sure this is adult pleasure. I feel that maybe if they did not realize how mature this was, they should have taken their children and left.",1341100800,,395,4.142857142857143
4735349,5,B005LAII1C,"""Ted"" is great! This is how the story goes: John Bennett is a grown man who must deal with the cherished teddy bear who came to live as the result of a childhood wish... and has refused to leave his side ever since.

The cast led by Mark Wahlberg (as John), Mila Kunis (as Lori) & Seth MacFarlane (terrific as Ted, who also directed, produced, wrote the story & co-wrote the screenplay) is great. The directing by MacFarlane is great. The story by MacFarlane & the screenplay by MacFarlane, Alec Sulkin & Wellesley Wild (who also produced) is great.

The music by Walter Murphy is great. The cinematography by Michael Barrett is great. The film editing by Jeff Freeman is great. The casting by Sheila Jaffe is great. The production design by Stephen J. Lineweaver is great. The art direction by E. David Cosier & assistant art direction by Bryan Felty is great. The set decoration by Kyra Friedman & assistant set decoration by Amy Morrison is great. The set dressings by Shadya H. Ballug, Mickey Carter, Cosmas A. Demetriou, Jack O'Neil, John Pungitore, William C. Salter, Christopher Sawtelle & Cleo Wang is great. The special effects by Matt Corrigan is great. The visual effects supervised by Blair Clark & Scott Liedtka, coordinated by Magdalena Bisogni, Wendy Maestracci, Whitney Richman, Pippa Sheen, Georgia Smith & Pip Wright is great. The stunts coordinated by Kyle Woods are great.

This is a funny and great movie that is entertaining and keeps you laughing until the very end. It is also well-made, as well. Seth MacFarlane does a great job, not only in directing the movie and writing the story & screenplay, but, in voicing Ted, he is (again) terrific. It also proves that he has a future outside television. He & Mark Wahlberg also have terrific chemistry together, as does Wahlberg & Mila Kunis. This is also one of the best movies of the summer season.",1341100800,,1870,4.765432098765432
4735350,5,B005LAII1C,"This is one of those special (ED) movies that doesn't come along very often. The story is original with a very familiar theme. Friendship. A story of a lifetime friendship that is deeply moving and the choices that we make to keep those special people in our lives. A friendship that knows no limitations on gender, race, or cotton fluff. OK, so basically it is a fart-joke movie with a hansom leading man and a smoking hot woman that makes him choose between his pot-smoking foul-mouthed teddy bear and her. You'll laugh so hard your sides will ache, and you will most likely be trying to get the soda out of your nose after it. Very much worth seeing, but it is very crude with a lot drug use, some really bad language and some of the funniest violence I think I have ever seen. This is an adult movie. I will be buying this as soon as it come out, and I may even go see it again in the theaters.",1341014400,,898,4.226744186046512
4735351,5,B005LAII1C,"Great comedy. I had the pleasure of seeing it in advance about a month ago. The theater was jam packed, and everyone came out happy.

Anything with Seth MacFarlane's name is worth at least a peek if you are a fan. Obviously the movie is geared for ""Family Guy"" fans, but really even if you don't like that show it's still worth a look.

The plot is pretty good: Boy never had any real friends then dreams his teddy bear would come alive, and it does!!! It's like an afterschool special from the 80s, but without all the political correctness you'd come to expect from those shows.

This is like if you took one of your favorite teddy bears as a kid but saw him grow up to be as a party animal.

Every joke hits the mark here including jabs at Seth's own creation ""Family Guy"". I have a lot of favorite scenes in the movie including the ""Teddy Ruxpin"" fight scene.

There's a couple of nice dramatic moments too , but it's mostly a raunchy comedy with over the top gags and punchlines.

I enjoyed it a lot, and the appearance of Sam Jones having fun with his Flash Gordon persona was definitely a sight to see.

Mark Wahlberg does a pretty good job as grownup John Bennett who has to make a decision about whether to cut out his best friend. Mila Kunis was also great. Obviously this was her part as well.

MacFarlane as ""Ted"" was wonderful, and Patrick Stewart provided the perfect narration for this. All in all just an all around gag fest.",1340928000,4,1441,4.330855018587361
4735352,5,B005LAII1C,The movie was hilarious from start to finish this was the best R comedy that has ever come out. The movie has awesome jokes I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a good comedy.,1340928000,,194,4.131578947368421
4735353,4,B005LAII1C,"I'm a big fan of ""Family Guy"" and Seth MacFarlane but I generally don't like movies with humans and uh...stuffed animals who can talk.  In this film, also written by MacFarlane, young John Bennett gets an oversized Teddy bear for Christmas.  John is even less popular than the Jewish kids who are beaten up each year by the Christian kids.  He wishes his Teddy would become human and be his lifelong friend.  Bang!  It happens and the two form a bond.

Years later as a 35 year old desk clerk for a car rental agency, John still has kid-like tendencies but for his 4 year relationship with Lori (Mila Kunis).  Lori puts an ultimatum to John.  Rambunctious, profane Ted must get his own apartment or she will move on.  This of course doesn't sit well with Ted who enjoys his pot smoking time with John.  Ted (MacFarlane) enjoys the best lines and while they aren't consistent, some are damn funny.  MacFarlane's humor is fast and he doesn't give you much time to absorb it before moving on to the next joke.  I also suspect many of quick hits will sail over some people's heads.

Joel McHale and Giovanni Ribisi are along for the ride as foils for John and Ted.  Sam Jones enlivens a party at Ted's pad.  He of course is from John and Ted's favorite movie ""Flash Gordon"" from 1980.  The bit is funny with some recreated scenes from the film.  Also look for Patrick Warburton and Ryan Reynolds in a hilarious brief cameo.  Finally, Norah Jones, playing herself, helps Ted and John try to mend fences with Lori in a scene you won't believe.",1340928000,,1537,4.487364620938628
4735354,5,B005LAII1C,"A grown man must deal with the Cherished teddy bear who came to life as the result of a childhood wish. John's dream came true, and he refuses to leave Ted's side, no-matter what the reason. From the Family Guy creator, Seth MacFarlane brings this very funny story to life in this film. There are moments of laugh-out-loud fun, and thought-provoking moments of friendship, relationships, and people's feelings. The story is Amazing as you grow to love Ted, John is a guy everyone would like, and his girlfriend is just as Funny as Ted. The different scenes and situations have you addicted to the story in the very beginning. A Comedy that will be a smash-hit. Humorous, Quirky, and down-right fun-filled Entertainment. Acting Performance of All characters, especially Ted are Fantastic. This is one comedy I'd watch again on those rainy-gloomy days. A Must-See, Must-Own Delightful Entertainment. Highly Recommended!",1340928000,14,917,5.1610738255033555
4735355,5,B005LAII1C,"When you grow up with a woman who makes teddy bears by hand and sells them for a living, they kind of become that extra member of the family. As a child, there were times when the bears would be in positions or places that weren't where they were thought to have been left. Our theory was that whenever we weren't around, whether it was if we left the house or went to bed or whatever, the bears would get up and throw parties when we weren't around. So any movie that features something like a living teddy bear that can talk probably resonates a bit more on this end than for the average person.

""Ted"" pretty much already had that nostalgic factor to it with the concept alone. While Seth MacFarlane doesn't always hit it out of the park with each episode of ""Family Guy,"" ""American Dad,"" or ""The Cleveland Show,"" when he does get it right it's something special; it's hilarious, it's emotional, and its references are spot-on. ""Ted"" is MacFarlane at his best. The trademarks he's known for are all in there whether it's the incredible music that is heavily Frank Sinatra inspired, the ridiculous movie and pop culture references, or the humor that always seems to take a flying leap over whatever the accepted standard might be; it's all in the stuffing/inner workings of ""Ted."" The only difference is this is a different medium; a different plane for MacFarlane to bring his offbeat humor and influences into.

The spin MacFarlane puts on a familiar story is what makes everything so good. Of course, hearing Patrick Stewart as the narrator is a pretty great way to start any movie. There are a few surprises in ""Ted"" that are worth keeping that way. There's this huge emphasis on ""Flash Gordon"" that results in some really memorable sequences.

By now, you've probably heard the thunder song that John and Ted sing whenever a thunderstorm hits. It's still funny no matter how many times you hear it. Giovanni Ribisi was the best part of last year's ""The Rum Diary"" and he always seems to show up when you least expect him to like in ""Avatar"" or ""Public Enemies."" He has the most hilarious sequence he's ever been a part of in ""Ted."" It'll be difficult not to think of this particular scene whenever you see him from now on.

""Ted"" is an R-rated comedy first and foremost, but it also crams a lot of heart into its 106-minute run time. The strain that's put on both the relationship between John and Ted and John and Lori's relationship results in the last twenty or so minutes of the movie being purely emotional. So while you'll more than likely remember the movie for the farting scene at the restaurant, the dirty fozzy scene at the grocery store, or the most amazing hotel room brawl involving a teddy bear that you've ever seen, ""Ted"" is secretly setting you up for that tight feeling in your chest when that pull string on your heart is tugged a little too hard.

""Ted"" is the best thing Mark Wahlberg has been a part of since ""The Fighter."" It also gives the impression that Seth MacFarlane is still in the upswing of his prime and still has a lot to offer to anyone who's a fan of comedy in general. With its magnificently rich score, flawless use of CG, heartfelt sucker punch neatly tucked away at its core, and endless barrage of references and foul mouthed and vulgar humor, ""Ted"" gives ""21 Jump Street"" a run for the funniest R-rated comedy of the year. In fact, it may even get your vote as the best comedy of the year. It's like 2012's secret weapon for comedy at least until we can get our hands on an Apache helicopter.",1340928000,209,3542,4.519500780031201

At least until the sequel. . . The bear is hilarious, but only because he isn't a human.  If he was a human, he would be a total (insert word I'm pretty sure you aren't allowed to use on an Amazon review).  But isn't that the point of movies like this?

4737547,3,B005LAII1C,"This movie definitely represents the boundary between childhood and adulthood: Combine a Disney movie like Toy Story with a stoner comedy like Harold & Kumar or Pineapple Express and you get ""Ted"". The plot is very heartwarming: A guy named John was rejected from peers as a kid, makes a wish, and has a real life teddy bear as a friend; Time moves on, and the foul mouthed beer and weed loving teddy bear is dominating John's life with Lori, his prized girlfriend. The majority of the movie is focused on John getting back together with Lori, along with regaining the friendship of John and Ted after one party changed their lifes. The ending is incredibly emotional, where John and Lori attempt to save Ted from a Mexican kidnapper, who kills him in the process, but the ending is similar to Shrek where their lives end happily forever after. Although it may seem like a children's movie, it is anything but appropriate for children with the amount of foul language, alcohol and drugs, and mature-discrete interactions with women. The Blu-Ray DVD states this is the ""funniest movie of the year"", but I found it a mere distraction for the seriousness of the plot. It was an okay movie to say the least, but I kinda liked it.",1470614400,,1225,4.649769585253456

It might have been considered a ""fairy tale for adults,"" except for the continuous vulgar references which are a McFarlane specialty. I had gone into the movie thinking it was going to be one of those films where ""Ted"" talks only in his master/friend/buddy's presence and the fact that everyone accepts Ted has come to life was a refreshing concept.  The story's fun and has some genuine laughs as Ted's man-child owner learns he can't stay a child forever.  Mila Kunis as the girlfriend who loves him in spite of his insisting on behaving as if he's 18 instead of 35 is beautiful (as always) and the sane force of the story.

Starring Mark Wahlberg, Mila Kunis (That 70s Show and Family Guy's Meg) and the voice of Seth MacFarlane.  Ted is the story of a magical teddy bear and his never grown-up owner, John Bennett (Wahlberg), his girlfriend, Lori.  This is no children's story.  The f-bombs fly faster than any F-16.  The ""boy humor"" includes numerous flatulance jokes and situations as well as sexual situations and banter.  It IS funny, though.

Ted is neither your traditional, typical teddy bear nor teddy bear story.  This is good writing, good acting and good fun.  Giovanni Ribisi plays the father of a rather portly youngster who covets Ted.  Patrick Stewart is an unlikely narrator.  Singer Norah Jones makes a guest appearance as a former paramour of Ted.

This is certainly not for everybody.  However, those who choose to watch this are ensured laughs.ew laughs",1455321600,,1058,4.876404494382022

 In all story-telling the audience must engage in what we call a willing suspension of disbelief.  In this case we must somehow believe that the hard working, ambitious and truly lovely Lori (Mila Kunis) has remained for four years in a relationship with John (Mark Wahlberg), a slacker/stoner in his mid 30s who would rather hang out with his best friend Ted (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) than give his attention to his girlfriend.  IRL (in real life) this relationship would not last from Friday until Monday.  Oh, and the best friend is a Teddy Bear magically brought to life, somewhat more believable than the stoner/striver romance.
 But this R rated comedy is funny.  Fans of TVs The Family Guy will be in familiar territory here.  Wahlberg plays a big hearted, dim witted loser, just like Peter Griffith in the TV show.  Mila Kunis is the much smarter love interest who somehow can tolerate her slower partner, just like Lois Griffith in the TV show.  Even the talking Teddy Bear has a TV counterpart in Brian the Griffith familys talking dog.
 This $50 million live action cartoon is all MacFarlane.  He produced the movie, he wrote the movie and he directed the movie.  He even does the voice of Ted, the talking Teddy Bear.  Fans of Seth MacFarlane and The Family Guy will enjoy the humor and familiar set ups in the movie.  This is R rated for language and adult situations, as fans will expect.  Oddly, the only nudity is in a non-sexual scene where the stoner and the best friend explain why Garfield the cartoon cat has eyes that resemble the female breast.  But there is enough other stuff to justify the R rating.
  Giovanni Ribisi has an important role as a crazy kidnapper who wants Ted for his own son.  He somehow does not make the connection between the living bear (who points out to the nut job that he is an American citizen, not a toy) and his intrinsic humanity, a theme developed in better movies such as 2001 A Space Odyssey and I Robot.  Ribisi, seen lately in The Rum Diaries and long ago as the medic in Saving Private Ryan, is an old pro with more than 80 movie and TV roles to his credit.  His crazy is both creepy enough and quirky enough to give him the honors for best actor in this movie.  Jessica Barth plays Tami-Lynn, the Teddy Bears trailer trash girlfriend (echoing Family Guy again, Brian the talking dog has a girlfriend with a similar lower class background).  The spectacularly beautiful Barth is a new pro with several minor roles to her credit.  She also has several voice roles on Family Guy, so she and Seth MacFarlane have worked together in the past.
 There is a sub plot that revolves around the 1980 camp favorite, Flash Gordon.  Star Sam J. Jones appears as himself in Ted where the Wahlberg, the stoner fan, and his ursine pal invite him to a house party.  There is some very nice writing and acting when the fans get whacked on cocaine with their screen hero.
 This one hour and 46 minute adult comedy has plenty of laugh lines, clever writing and good acting.  If much of it is familiar, well fans of Family Guy will like it and people who liked the Hangover movies will also this three saw blade comedy.",1438905600,,3164,4.530864197530864

The script also gives her and Wahlberg more chemistry than is typical of the genre. Giovanni Ribisi always brings something to character roles. Milks the shock value of a vulgar teddy bear to death, so probably wouldn't hold up to a second viewing. No, it's not ""The Seventh Seal"", or ""The Lady Eve"" or even ""Holy Grail"".

4748951,5,B005LAII1C,"Well, i wasn't going to write a review on this but there enough people watching the ""unrated"" version of an R rated movie that I feel I need to step up on a soap box.

Ahem...This movie is written and directed by Seth McFarland, the creator of Family Guy and American Dad along with being an accomplished acapella singer(which is a bit weird but he is really good), movie producer and producer of the fine work known as ""Cosmos"". He's a fantastic human being and you're rude for not having any clue who he is before stumbling into this movie. It's going to be offensive because offending people makes them think.

So, about this movie. The movie is a comedy about a man seeking support through a stuffed doll, you expected something more oscar worthy? It's funny because a sweet, generally innocent thing is turned to vulgarity in order to show how our idealized image of things changes. It's a buddy movie where one of the figures isn't necessarly real. The film acheives this and demonstrates the difficulties that friends can have while growing into their own individual persons.

If you didn't like it, that's ok, but you should have had some idea about what it was about before going in and your ignorance about who made it isn't the fault of the person so please stop displaying your ignorance like a badge.

Thank you /steps down from soap box.",1418774400,3,1351,4.616666666666666

There is more to the movie than just gross one liners.  It's got a lot of intertwined stories about loyalty, becoming mature and making sacrifices.

It is an entirely different type of movie--a one of a kind plot, a excellent storyline and an ultimate story of friendship.

If Vince Vaughan had been playing the Bear it would have been pathetic to watch a grown person behave that way and have no ambition at all.

There is no payoff for any of the jokes throughout the entirety of the movie, expect the cheapest and most obvious jokes in addition to typical Hollywood tropes.

Ted accurately reflects Seth M.'s moronic 2nd grade sense of humor. If elementary school entirely uncreative homophobic, fart, d$%k, sex, and boob jokes are funny to you then you might enjoy this. Otherwise it is an ENTIRE waste of time. I'm surprised the actors could say some of the lines with a straight face and that they agreed to star in this movie after reading the script. I'm not against crude humor, just be creative or clever with it. MacFarlane is quite literally a writer whose creativity with crude humor is the equivalent of recording a conversation between a group of the least intelligent Frat guys in a room together watching a porn movie and then using that as the basis for the film's dialogue.",1406505600,,914,4.683229813664596

4752869,3,B005LAII1C,"Creator of 'Family Guy' Seth MacFarlane directs his first non-animated feature length movie and hits it straight out of the ballpark. The movie stars Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis but the real star here is a talking teddy bear named Ted. Foul-mouthed and with a filthy mind, this soft toy come to life isn't a companion you would want around your kids. Yet, MacFarlane has given him such a cuddly, adorable physique you can't help but fall madly in love with him. Fans of Stewie in 'Family Guy' will know what I mean. The script is fairly simple. A lonely kid without friends wishes for his teddy bear to come to life and gets exactly what he wanted. The problem starts when he becomes an adult (played by Wahlberg) as his over-dependence on the friendship with Ted is viewed as unusual, especially by his girlfriend (Kunis) who feels sidestepped. This is a picture you wouldn't want your children to watch though, as the script is quite profane.

I even liked it so much, that I bought it on the exact day of its DVD/Blu-ray release. However, I did have some problems with some of its raunchy and crude material. There is even one bit where the teddy bear makes a remark about 9/11, that i will not mention in this review, but I will say it has something to do with Norah Jones, who appears in the movie. Most of the jokes are drug or sexual related. Some jokes are even somewhat childish. Seth Macfarlane (creator of the animated series ""Family Guy""), directed, co-wrote and even voices the teddy bear, himself. Macfarlane and the other writers did a fairly well job with writing a hilarious (but often crude) script that makes Ted really work as a comedy. And like I said, I really like this film. I really do. I just found several areas of the film a bit too wild (and a TINY bit offensive.) Ted 2 is coming 2015.",1399075200,4,1024,4.2030456852791875

My kids dragged me to this movie and I was subjected to almost 2 hours of predictable jokes and really silly scenarios -- 2 hours I will never get back, mind you.  If you have kids and don't mind exposing them to a little adult-oriented humor, they will probably love this movie, because my kids (aged 14-19) thought it was so hysterical that they wanted to own it.

There comes a point at which watching a teddy bear spout obscenities (and hump human women) ceases to be novel and becomes simply tedious.  which point was reached in the first half hour.

it's a shame, because there were a few good moments, mostly dealing with pop culture in the 90's.  When you get tired of the potty jokes, fast forward to the party scene in the middle of the film.  marketed as a music video it would rate 4 stars.",1390348800,,836,4.3896103896103895

As an adult (which he is in age only), the bear is still his best friend, and that is causing friction between him and his girlfriend. The bear is also vulgar and foulmouthed, which contributes to the humor.

And this was COMPLETELY different from what I thought; even having a bear that looks like him (he's not OFFICIAL though, he's one I got just for fun, cause I thought he was a cutie last month. And YES that's 1 of the reasons I wanted to see this movie (but I'm getting married, and I'm a kid at heart!) I actually liked Peter Griffin's voice for the bear (it fit Real well) and I guessed the ending.....knowing how Marky Mark (Yes I KNOW his REAL name, but come on! ) And Mila Kunis would all be a family (I like guessing movie endings) But I NEVER would've guessed that she Would've wished for him back; and This worked great cause she wanted her life back. (And ever since Highschool, the only way for me to live MINE is with my Fiance......Love you Babe!!! I also wouldn't have guessed the Subplot with the kid and his son who was trying to Create they're own Teddy Bear, You see I Thought (cause it was at the beginning of the movie when EVERYONE knew Teddy could talk.....LOVE that ALONE by the way....cause you NEVER see that in a movie.) But I just thought the kid was like this background character you'd never see again......then he ends up being this brat kid who loses all his weight and ends up being Jacob from TWILIGHT; which I LOVED, cause like I've said TWILIGHT WEDDING; but MAN; does Jacob get on my nerves!

I had never heard of Seth McFarlane, although I vaguely recall now that he was the one who had trouble at the Oscars or something.  Whoever he is, he has the ability to make a modern day comedy that is consistently funny and I can't think of anyone else doing that right now.  Ted is not for everyone and there are bits that are offensive without having enough of a payoff to justify themselves.  To each his own.

I told a dirty joke. I made a racially-insensitive comment but it's okay because I'm a teddy bear."" So edgy. So boundary-pushing. So innovative. This movie is like a 107 minute long episode of Family Guy with a bunch of f-bombs thrown in. And don't get me wrong, I love ""The Big Lebowski"", so it's not the obscenity that bothers me; it's the pointless tedium of trying so hard to be ""edgy"".

4755482,4,B005LAII1C,"Seth Macfarlane (creator of the iconic show Family Guy, American Dad, The Cleveland Show, etc.) made an even bigger name for himself in 2012. He made a full feature length film that revolves solely around teddy bear. But trust me, this bear ain't nice.

TED has a solid reserved cast that includes Mark Wahlberg as John, Mila Kunis as Lori, Patrick Stewart as our narrator, Joel Mchale as Rex, Giovanni Ribsi as the antagonist Donny, and the funny man himself Seth Macfarlane voices TED. There are alao brief appearances from Ryan Reynolds(hahaha again, no comment), the talented singer Norah Jones, and Sam Jones. I liked the cast, the chemistry with Mark and Mila was there, and the humor is outrageous and spot on for the most part.

Yes, this movie IS rated R, and no, I would not consider this an ideal movie for kids. There are a lot of jokes that will make a person laugh, then there are a few jokes that will make another person say to his/herself ""was I supposed to laugh just now?"" I get that. And I do understand it Again, Seth Macfarlane is recognized for his wild, dubious sense of humor. But even though the humor is extreme, TED still manages to convey the message that best friends should always stick together.

For those who have not yet seen TED, there are two things I can guarantee if you decide to watch it: 1) You are going to laugh at some point during this movie 2) If you just so happen to be afraid of thunder, you will never fear it again. TED gets a score of

Ted did give me all that Family Guy used to, but it also gave a lesson that is important to us. Many of us are locked into an endless state of childhood. Some people are locked in because of a traumatic experience. Other people are locked into childhood because everyone in their inner circle is locked into childhood. The main character in Ted never really comes out of his childhood, even when he loses the love of his life. The woman who loves the main character allows him to stay in a state of childhood because she sees the pain it will cause. I come across so many people that think they are adults, but are old children. I have seen elderly people who are still in a state of childhood.

To say that this movie was juvenile is a gross understatement, but it had some entertaining moments.  Cute enough and with enough little moments to be a decent popcorn movie, but that's about it.  LOTS of drug use by two characters who are VERY immature and just barely a step above real losers.  The ""maturation"" angle doesn't really materialize.

4756444,2,B005LAII1C,"I love the concept behind this movie. A Teddy Bear that comes alive an is a pretty cynical character. Unfortunately, the creators of Ted pretty much turned their brains off after coming up with this concept. Rather than trying to write witty or actually funny humor, Ted falls back on a stream of vulgar scenes. The teddy bear, Ted, can't go a single scene without a curse word or talking about sex. I don't mind some R- or X-rated material in comedies, but too many comedies nowadays seem to think comedy is just a string of vulgarity.

Like many things, vulgarity in comedy works so long as it's witty or original. Too often Ted beats you over the head with the vulgarity. For example, the idea of Ted wanting to bed a hot blond is funny. Seeing him squirt lotion on his face to imitate ejaculate is just disturbing. The movie could have been a lot better if it had dialed back a bit and gotten better writers.

That said, the CGI used to create Ted is absolutely convincing. Hair is always tough to replicate with CGI so the fact that Ted looks so real is pretty impressive.",1374192000,3,1077,4.434343434343434

To an extent, it feels as shocking and unpredictable as a Family Guy episode. There's plenty of bonus features and fine PQ/AQ to go around.

4757203,5,B005LAII1C,"- Some of the dialogues are  ORIGINALY HILARIOUS. For example, the ones listed below (I don't remember the exact words, but the idea is the same)

John: ""Do you think I need to buy her a ring after being together for 4 years?""

Ted: ""What?...""
The reply is so unexpected and humorous.

- The conversations are funny but profane. There are a lot of F*** and S****. So, this movie is not for children.

- The interesting special effect brings Ted to life.

- Mark Wahlberg's and Mila Kunis's acting are wonderful. The way they talked to Ted looked as if Ted had been a real person.

- Surprisingly, there are some touching scenes and characters' depth. So, it's not a hollow comedy. The question is ""Are you willing to end the relationship with your childhood friend to spend all your time with your longtime girlfriend?"". Ted's and Mila's actions touched my heart.

4757555,1,B005LAII1C,"TED-this movie was not at all what I thought it would be. It was crude and had too much fighting, language etc. I don't think they did justice to this movie. It could have been a great story, with a great moral AND funny like anything without having to have another swear word every other minute. Would not recommend this to anyone especially kids! But even adults, rated R movies can be great and R-rated scenes can have their time and place in the context of the story.

It comes off obnoxious and toilet and teddy's voice was hard to adjust to at first but I ended up just going with it and soon found out I related to the character and the story.  I'm a typical guy and I can't pretend that alot of the humour I can relate to, Sorry!  I'm a pig like most men.  I also like Mila Kunis.  I think she's one of the best new school actresses and she's beautiful.  So I like this movie and the marky mark song Good Vibration.  Mark Walberg is cool in my book thank God.",1370304000,,624,3.8968253968253967

I found the movie to be ultra-crude, and think the marketing made this movie out to be a ""suitable for kids"" movie because of the animated teddy bear...what could be more fun than a live teddy bear that is with you for life?

WARNING:  This is NOT a kid's movie!!  Don't make the mistake of watching it with anyone under 21.  Drugs, alcohol, sex galore - seems the writers forgot to focus on any kind of actual ""plot,"" and settled for cheap laughs with the former.  I generally like Mark Whalberg, but this was definitely his worst.  Wish Amazon offered a money-back guarantee!  This movie sucks hard.

I do not see those vulgarity that inappropriate, since the reality has already been much dirtier. This movie also brought us to our childhood memories, which is very sweet and touching, it allowed us to wonder and cry, and taught us even though the reality is vulgar and dirty, at least, every one still held a pure unadulterated dream that made all our miserable life happier and more meaningful.",1369440000,,629,4.625

This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in quite some time. Wahlberg has always been hit or miss with me, but to be able to act with something that isn't there most of the time impressed me. He also had the opportunity to work with Mila Kunis, who has come a LONG way since that TV show. I have to give kudos to Seth McFarlane for writing and directing such a zany comedy. Of course, he was also the voice of Ted, so you have to blame him for some of foul mouth remarks. But, he was able to do a few things that not many people can. One, was digging up Sam Jones and the movie Flash Gordon. Two, was showing a clip from the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson and three, getting Mark Wahlberg to sing on stage with Norah Jones' band. He could have been singing out of tune on purpose, and probably was. But, to the generation which remembers Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch, I guess this is what old rappers sound like when they attempt to sing.

4759112,2,B005LAII1C,"This movie was recommended to me, so I gave it shot this weekend.  BIG mistake.  ""Ted"" is the story of an 8-year old boy who wishes a Christmas wish that he and his teddy bear would n'er be parted, or some BS like that.  Anyway, his wish comes true, his teddy bear comes to life, and they remain best friends.  Flash-forward a couple of decades, and Ted and John are still friends; however, there's a BIG difference now in Ted.  He has become a foul-mouthed, pot-smoking, liquor swilling, womanizer.  I guess anything is possible.

Set McFarland directed, produced, co-wrote, and voiced the title character in this very unfunny excess in everything.  I didn't anticipate a 5-star movie, but I was left scratching my head and asking the questions:  who really wanted to watch this?; who thought the concept would be funny?; and why would Mark Wahlberg lower himself to appear in it?  For those of you that may not be aware, McFarland created the animated series ""The Family Guy.""  What MIGHT work for 30 minutes, grows REAL tired REAL fast in a movie that logs in at just under two hours.  Oh, McFarland tries to polish his t*rd, but as we all know REGARDLESS of what you do to a t*rd, you're still left with a T*RD.  Why ANY woman would want to waste her time on a man who still ""hangs"" with his teddy bear and is obviously more interested in getting stoned, drunk, and wallowing in excess is beyond me.

This movie wasn't funny nor touching.  All it was was a shining of example of how some industry folk wouldn't recognize what makes a good movie if their lives depended on it.

Add Seth MacFarlane to the list because ""Ted"" is side-splittingly funny.  I was skeptical about the premise of a foul-mouthed beer-swilling pot-smoking plush toy but MacFarlane navigates the concept brilliantly.  He leavens the humor with just the right amount of poignancy to give the film resonance.  Aside from his directorial-writer duties MacFarlane gives voice to Ted and deserves kudos for humanizing the CGI image.  Mark Wahlberg deserves props too because it couldn't have been easy playing against what was probably a blank canvass.  I really like how MacFarlane injects pop culture trivia into the proceedings.  His running gags about Sam Jones(Flash Gordon) and Tom Skerritt are a hoot.  My wife is still cracking up over the scene where Giovanni Ribisi's character is dancing to Tiffany's ""I Think We're Alone Now"".

I for one, like a good dose of schoolyard style humor so I frequently found myself guffawing at the potty humor on display. However, if your idea of a good time is something at a bit higher grade level, you may want to steer elsewhere.

All talk of the movie's relative maturity level, I thought Mark Wahlberg did a good job as the movie's likeable schlub. He showed some nice range in this one, playing a role much different from the action hero he often portrays on screen. Mila Kunis was spot on in her role as the almost too perfect girlfriend (I mean, how could he actually not realize what a catch he had).

One casual observation -- I'd love to live in the world John inhabits. Every young lady around him was an absolute knock-out. From his girlfriend to his co-workers and her co-workers -- an absolute parade of supermodels.

I get the family guy references - I'm a huge fan - but I didn't find them funny....or even amusing. And all I could think of most of the time was Stewie and it got kind of annoying.,1364947200,,297,4.0508474576271185

4760278,2,B005LAII1C,Overall this movie had a very interested premise that was at least partly a new idea.

I'd just like to point out that this movie's humor isn't a long running version of a Family Guy episode. Seth does a great job and Mark makes this movie worth watching over and over.

4760440,4,B005LAII1C,"Yup. Coming from the creator of Family Guy and American Dad, this is pretty much a movie with the same kind of humor, except racier.  Ted was a loveable character and his somewhat irresponsible way of living makes for some good laughs. My only question was why the last few minutes of the movie needed to take a somewhat dark turn but, overall, it was a fun movie.",1364515200,,364,4.352941176470588

I had already watched a few video clips of the funny scenes in Ted and I wish I had not seen them before watching the dvd because then it would have been even funnier while watching the dvd Ted. I almost put four stars because I totally did not like the serious ending, and while I knew what they were getting at that changed the tone from funny to sad plus serious with some sentimental, and it would have been so much better if the ending of Ted continued being funny. There were some funny parts before the aweful ending and that's what I'm giving five stars saying was funny.

Again, before you decide to buy or rent this movie, watch Family Guy.  If it made you laugh out loud or even chuckle at all the morally incorrect jokes then this movie is for you.

Because I have loved every movie Wahlberg has ever done and am very familiar with the  particular twisted genius that is Seth McFarlane,I threw caution to the wind and  spent the money.  I  figured it would either be horrible or weirdly, wackily excellent....and much to my surprise, it was the latter !

Within the first two minutes, you totally get into the 'world' of the movie and it becomes perfectly sane that Mark Wahlberg ( who gets hotter with age, btw ) and his childhood teddy bear are sitting on the couch, hanging out and discussing their lives, both with flawless Boston accents. And the story takes off from there.

Sorry, but the movie could have been a lot better if the screen play writers had not resorted to so many ""cheap shot"" jokes.",1363737600,,613,4.455357142857143

4761108,3,B005LAII1C,"Ted is extremely funny, and surprising that what's a one-joke film (foul-mouthed Teddy bear) kinda works as a buddy film feature. But even with good actors (Wahlberg, Kunis, and all the supporting cast) with some decent writing and very funny moments, the end result is flat. Like Family Guy, I don't believe any of the story moments that aren't fueled by jokes, making the entire film feel one-dimensional. The film spends way more time paying homage to 80's films than it does making us believe in the Wahlberg-Kunis relationship, and while that may be to McFarlane fans preference, it's weakens the whole thing overall. It has no heart, all humor, keeping it out of the league of The Hangover, Bridesmaids, The Simpsons, Borat and Austin Powers.",1363478400,,748,4.944444444444445

4761115,5,B005LAII1C,I recommend watching this movie with your entire family. Especially with the little ones. It is a fun filled family adventure with a loveable bear who makes us feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Make sure to smoke pot during this film.,1363392000,,232,4.5476190476190474

4761117,2,B005LAII1C,"There are funny moments, but are very far between the EXTREMELY predictable storyline. It is basically another version of Family Guy, as Seth Mcfarlane compiles the his three voices (for Brian, Stewy and Peter) into Ted, with the SAME EXACT HUMOR. McFarlane is a one-trick pony with a shortening life-span.

They force 2 gay characters into the script, that have absolutely nothing to do with the story. But its today's Hollywood, so what do you expect... The drug use is also unneeded. Wahlberg is very wrong for the role he plays but must've needed quick cash.

People who gave this film a 5-star rating no nothing about comedy or original story telling.",1363392000,,656,4.848214285714286

4761270,2,B005LAII1C,"Upon my boyfriend's assistance, and against my better judgment, I watched Ted last night. Although I did laugh at times, overall I found it very juvenile. The humor relied upon vulgarity & crude sex jokes, instead of the on-the-edge humor, double entndres, sarcasm and intelligence of Family Guy.
Since the story failed to keep my interest, I found myself wondering if Seth was that lonely, little boy, who so badly wanted a friend, he created an imaginary one. I hope this has exorcised those childhood demons, and Seth will, in his next project, produce adult humor, instead of putting the fantasies of a rejected pre-teen on screen.",1363392000,,635,4.94392523364486

Is it different from other McFarlane stuff like Family Guy? Nope. Not really. It's just more of McFarlane's humor in a less animated format. Whether or not that would appeal to you depends on your taste. In the end, I don't regret watching Ted, but I don't think I'd go out of my way to watch it again.

Pretty cool, well Seth Macfarlane decided to turn that on it's head and ask:  Well, what happens if the bear grows up?  ""Ted"" is what happens.  The surprising guest stars, the fantastic narration of Patrick Stewart... seriously I think Seth is just trying to come up with lines for Patrick to say just because he wants to see if he'll do it, I mean it's such an amazing voice saying such unexpected and vulgar things...oh, sorry no spoilers.  I haven't laughed so hard at a movie since ""Dumb and Dumber.""  What a joyride.  Warning!  The movie contains nudity, mostly of a bear, use of drugs and alcohol, kidnapping, hookers, and yes, lots and lost of off color humor.  But it's ok because it's done with Bostonian accents that you can find yourself in and not able to get out of later.  I think if you have the capability to hold on and not judge before the end of the flick, you'll be surprised by how cool it really is.

I did find this film much funnier than MacFarlane's animated series, ""Family Guy."" The same jokes can be found, but the overall comedic performances of Kunis and Wahlberg (well mostly Wahlberg) make up for Ted's  crude jokes (aka. Peter Gryffin). There were some moments of uncomfortable funny parts, but not enough to ruin the flow of the movie.

Definitely not suitable for younger children, even though there is a cute looking teddy bear as a supporting character.",1363219200,,733,4.848

4762347,4,B005LAII1C,"I purchased this movie because what could be funnier than a rude and raunchy talking teddy bear ?

I really liked this movie, I guess because it is a guy thing. The story revolves around a child (Wahlberg) who gets a teddy bear for Christmas. He makes a wish that the bear comes alive since he did not have many friends. Move ahead 20 years and Wahlberg is grown with a grown teddy bear living with him. Ted cusses , drinks beer, and is quite the ladies man. It boils down to Wahlberg having to decide between his new girlfriend or his best friend, the crude and rude party boy teddy bear,Ted.
Not to spoil this, but it all works out for them both in the end.

This movie is quite hilarious at times, but it definitely is not for kids. There is a large amount of profanity, from Ted of course, and some scenes that are not kid friendly.

This reminds me of the eighties film, Howard the Duck, in some ways, but it is a whole lot funnier. My better half mostly hated this film and thought it was silly, but sometimes you need a little silliness in your life. I hope they do make a Ted 2. I also think Mark Wahlberg is a great actor and brings life to just about everything I have ever seen him star in.",1362096000,,1201,4.145922746781116

4762654,5,B005LAII1C,"Seth Macfarlane takes his Family Guy brilliance and applies it to a live action major motion picture. For those who have seen Family Guy will understand what ted is all about: light on plot but laden with crude humor,pop culture references aplenty and cameos by celebrities.
For the most part the movie works. There are times when,unlike Family Guy, it tries to get sentimental and a little serious. That is its only flaw.
Seth is not afraid to offend as his hosting of the 2013 Oscar event can surely attest to. No ethnicity, group,religious organization or national tragedy is off limits. Many will find that offensive but in an age of rampant political correctness it is a warm welcome. Nothing should be culturally taboo that we can't at least laugh it.

Without giving away too much, the part involving poop was really distasteful and totally unnecessary.  Other than that, there are some pretty funny parts.

After you get over the fact a stuffed bear can talk and tell dirty jokes that fall so flat, I was more fascinated by the fact that apparently Puddy and Ryan Reynolds are a gay couple.

Basically, the movie fails not so much in trying to translate ""Family Guy"" humor without censorship but the fact it's a run-of-the-mill rom-com when it comes right down to it. Boy has girl. Girl wants boy to grow up. He says he will. He doesn't. They fight. They make up. He sees the world in some new light (thanks to a talking stuffed bear, mind you), and they live happily ever after. Snooze and fest.

4762870,1,B005LAII1C,"I watched this movie about a month before the Oscars, on the recommendation of some acquaintances and people I knew from work. One trend that I tended to notice that all of the fans of this movie tended to be druggies and shall I say, crude, ""lower-class"" people with extremely bad taste in entertainment and low IQ's. That not withstanding, I decided to rent the movie. I was indifferent to it, but it was ridiculous. There was little in the way of a narrative. The plot came across as stupid and juvenile. Wow, look, they're smoking pot, wow! Halfway through, the movie just seemed self-indulgent and was going nowhere. I turned off.

Then I watched the Oscars last night. Turns out the same guy behind Ted was hosting the show. He was just the most evil, horrible, crude person that I've ever seen in my life. He reminds me of many ignorant Midwesterners and Southerners that I've met in my life. He claims that he was just making jokes, but man, many of them were downright racist and mean. The one about not understanding foreigners? Yup, heard that crap a lot. The John Wilkes Booth joke is also the kind of warped, low-class humor that you will hear many Middle America dullards make. These are the same people that couldn't find Canada on a map.

Seth has made my blacklist, along with Judd Apatow. He is a no-talent hack that needs to disappear. If anyone ever tells me that they like his work, that will immediately tell me everything that I need to know about them.

The story line is pathetic and every bit of dialogue along the way is just empty cliche.  Girl dumps boyfriend because he's carousing with his friends, boy realizes love is more important than booze, tries to get girl back.  Not even well acted, I felt no chemistry whatsoever.  The narrator concept (nice family narrator who ""surprises"" us with an occasional f-bomb or s-pile) is alright but poorly executed.  The story is not strong enough even to carry a comedy, and the jokes aren't good enough to overcome the lack of a story.  The entire value of this movie was a 10-minute standup routine.  Mark Walhberg is an honest, versitile actor but in this movie he is just another one-dimensional hollywood ""star"" not Mark Walhberg the actor.

I was expecting another Paul, but MacFarlane isn't British, and THIS film was hysterical. Ted is a raunchy real life living teddy bear, who combines the traits of every MacFarlane character. It was pretty awesome, sometimes you saw him as Peter, other times Brian, and so on. The real surprise of this film was Mark Wahlberg. I can't remember ever seeing him in a comedy and I wasn't sure his rather dry personality would work with MacFarlane's brand of humor, but he fit in like he's been doing this for years. I mean he was Marky Mark, he must have some personality in there somewhere! As for the story, it's not much different than a really good episode of Family Guy. Of course, it a lot more raunchy and it's not animated, but there are certainly many parallels, and defiantly some hysterical lines. It's not the kind of film I usually go for, at points, it's more than a little stupid, but I'd be lying if I didn't say I laughed my ass off throughout the film.",1361491200,,1103,4.411764705882353

4763159,4,B005LAII1C,"okay, so i'm not the biggest fan of 'family guy'. sometimes it's funny and clever and easy to watch.  other times i find it inane and redundant and i need to turn it off.  so it was fairly easy to be open-minded about this latest offering by seth macfarlane.  overall, it was funny and entertaining....but it had a few shortcomings.  of course, the hook is the talking teddy bear voiced by seth (the voice of peter griffin and brian the dog on his show 'family guy').  and with this hook, seth figured he didn't need to focus on giving the movie a plot.  the basic premise is standard chick flick fare: a typical party-animal bozo who refuses to grow up (played well by mark wahlberg) has a very pretty girlfriend who's too good for him (played wonderfully by mila kunis from family guy and that 70s show). she tries to get him to grow up and when he fails to meets expectations and messes up one time too often, she dumps him.  everyone is sad and miserable until the obligatory final chase scene which occurs because some psycho kidnaps the talking teddy bear.
so seth figured the comedy and hook overshadowed the need for plot.......and he wasn't too far off the mark.  there was enough profanity and humor to make this an entertaining flick.  comedy is often based on sex, drugs, hookers and macfarlane's own satirical view of the society in which we live.  it's not a movie for kids.  but i found it clever in spots, good for a number of laughs and over all a worthwhile film for a mindless comedy experience.  the entire cast performed well with a 4-star (though pointless) script.....with appearances by sam jones (tv's flash gordon), nora jones and the guy who played david putty on tv's seinfeld.  it's not a brilliant movie or poignant or impressive from a ciematic point of view.....but it's a fun watch, mindlessly entertaining and good for some laughs.....occassionally a few big laughs.  the c.g. effects with the animated bear were well-done and combined with seth's characterization of the weed-smoking stuffed animal, it made for a reasonably believable and likable role in the film.  in closing, there was not much of a plot, but the script was nearly funny and entertaining enough to pull thru even with that handicap.  fun characters and good acting by a respectable cast helped to make this an enjoyable flick.  i think you should give it a chance.......laughing can't hurt you.",1361491200,,2399,4.71462829736211

4763221,3,B005LAII1C,"Ted is Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlanes feature-length, live-action comedy with bad language and raunchy jokes aplenty. But that is not a big surprise. Also, Ted can be very sentimental at times, but that is OK with me. The real problem of Ted is not that part.

This is after all a one-joke movie, and the joke works most effectively in the opening section (narrated by Patrick Stewart) about how Ted is born. A lonely child named John Bennet makes a wish which comes true. His new teddy bear is alive! Now, 27 years later, the little boy grows up and becomes Mark Wahlberg, who has been dating Mila Kuniss character Lori Collins. Ted, a teddy bear that walks and talks, becomes a foul-mouthed slacker stuffed toy.

The rest of the film is, in short, which does John choose, Lori or Ted? The plotline is familiar and uneven, with lots of gags and pop culture references that are hit and miss. The film jumps from one comic set-piece to another without bothering to develop the characters, poking fun at pop culture icons including Flash Gordon and Taylor Lautner. OK, I laughed, I admit, but the idea of Giovanni Ribisis creepy stalker is not only unfunny; it is just out of place.

Though I enjoyed the film by and large, I couldn't help feeling that Ted could have been much better with a strong storyline and more fleshed-out characters.",1361404800,,1344,4.638655462184874

The good:

*  Ted seems plausible.  You can really buy into the idea that there is a real, live teddy bear running around raising hell in the world.

*  The cast does a really great job of selling the premise of this movie.

The bad:

*  Its tough to buy Marky Mark as a 35 year old guy.

*  Its also tough to buy Mark W as a 35 year old guy dating Mila Kunis because they really do seem like they are very far apart age-wise...which they are, of course.

Other than that, this isn't a movie that strives for high art.  Its a good, fun movie that is tasteless and obnoxious.  Its offensive.  Its racist.  And it takes shots at almost everyone.

This movie is one of the best of 2012. It's a laugh-out-loud hilarious comedy about growing up or not. I saw it in a packed theater. There are parts of this movie where Ted says something and the audience laughs, then he says something else but you can't hear it cause you're still laughing. I liked all the pop cultural references as well as the appearance of Sam Jones, from 1980's Flash Gordon, (which I saw in the theater twice in one day!)McFarlane knows his stuff.

Much of it's success I believe comes from the fact it was released a week or two after Prometheus, but due to bad word of mouth, Prometheus suffered a 70% drop in ticket sales in it's second week. There was nothing to see and Ted found it's audience. It would dominate the box office until the release of 'The Amazing Spiderman' some four weeks later.

It's a nice story, and though it's got a talking stuffed bear, the movie puts it as a novelty, then a normal thing.  You'll see.  Highly recommend.

Mark Wahlberg is as hot as ever, Mila is totally beautiful, and Seth McFarlane is as funny as he is on TV - - which is the problem.

This is an adult movie in the same way that Family Guy is an adult TV show.  The main character is a snarky Teddy bear that has come to life, think Stewie.  The plot is fairly predictable and serves mostly as a vehicle to deliver the main characters into scenes that act as a set-up to the next joke for Ted.  The jokes tend toward the non-PC end of the spectrum.  These things are neither good or bad in their own right, but this is what the movie is.  If you like Stewie and Family Guy, you will probably like this movie; if you don't like that form of comedy, then this is not the movie for you.

I do like Seth MacFarlane and the Stewie brand of comedy, but I think it is much better served in smaller time chunks like a half hour sitcom.  It gets a little old in a 2 hour movie.  I may have liked it better with a little sharper editing to get down to a 90 minute range rather than almost 120 minutes.",1360540800,,1048,4.0

I mean, nobody expects too much out of a comedy: just make me laugh and be done with it.... If you forget the laughing part.. what do you have? There are parts where the film tries to entertain, and it's even more miserable because of that... if it didn't try, at least it wouldn't be as pathetic... Halfway through the film, I looked at my bored wife.. she was falling asleep. I wasn't, but was bored as hell....

It's as if he did a rough draft of the script one afternoon and they greenlit the project and never did a rewrite. I'm starting to think that while Mr. McFarland can come up with some great ideas he still needs his room of writers to hash them out for him. Normally I find Marky Mark and Mela Cunis quite funny but they were also very flat in this movie. I don't know what all the hype is about. I like fart jokes but I like good fart jokes.

I just felt Ted the character was not funny nor was the character well developed and I would have liked to see Ted take the rauchiness further.  I also had trouble with Teds voice since it was done by Seth McFarland I kept thinking I was watching a boring episode of family guy.  The plot was somewhat predictible nothing to write home about.  I have recently seen some Adam Sandler movies and been disappointed so perhaps my tastes are maturing as I get older but Ted did very little for me or my wife.

Then you have two obsessed people (Father and son) who are trying to kidnap this bear because he is ""magical.""  This movie was very odd and different.

Granted, this bear is only in Mark's life because he didn't have any friends, and Ted was his best friend, people are going to make connections and support networks throughout their lives.  It still was a terrible movie.  My opinion could be biased towards people.  I watched this with my boyfriend; he could not stop laughing throughout the entire movie.

Mark Wahlberg plays a guy named John who wished for a friend of his own as a child and got it in a teddy bear that came to life. It was big news back in the day but not society has cynically accepted it and moved on. Anyway, they're the best of friends but now that Johnny is 35 and with his 4 year old girlfriend (played by Mila Kunis) his teddy bear's hedonistic focuses are cramping Johnny's love life and future. What are ya gonna do when your teddy bear pal is doing drugs and has hordes of hooker traffic in and out of his place? Of course there are a variety of problems but I don't wish to give spoilers away.

Also starring Joel McHale (of ""The Community""), Ryan Reynolds, Tom Skerritt (more of a cameo) and Giovanni Ribisi (as the villain).

Yes, that's Nora Jones as herself and yeah that's Patrick Stewart as the narrator.

The budget for this pictures was roughly $60M and contrary to naysayers who felt this picture was horrible they're most likely being ignored as this picture made over $522M at the Box Office.

SPOILER: I liked how this picture didn't do the typical ""your childish lifestlye cannot coexist with our love relationship"" that is common in the diluted Hollywood rom com pics. This one let the the lover and the friend coexist with the main character.

Mila Kunis was the highlight of this movie and the only item that made it fresh. Would not recommend to ANYONE and certainly not to anyone below 18 yrs of age. Some of the things Ted said were really lame and seemed unnecessary, the whole movie seemed engineered for shock value and NOT entertainment. F-, I would like the 1.5 hours of my life back that I spent watching it, do yourself a favor, and rent ""Howard the Duck"" instead of TED, it's 1.25 stars would be a higher entertainment value.

4765376,1,B005LAII1C,"I would say this movie was childish but then again children cant see a movie with a bear dropping the f-bomb and snorting lines of coke.  The simplicity of the humor makes ""Half baked"" look like a Moonlight Sonata by comparison and really there was no plot what so ever.

4765459,1,B005LAII1C,"I did not finish the movie. I tried but I couldn't.

It spends so much time to picture a bad boy, a boy that curses all the time, smokes all the time, irresponsible both at work and at relationship. It seems a drastic transition awaits but by the time it happens, ( not to mention whether it is believable), bad influence has implanted to any viewers, bad boys are convinced to think what they have done is cool, is admirable, etc.

There was zero humor and the characters made no sense.  Kunis' character, who is put together and supposed to be intelligent, was with the teddy bear and Wahlberg's moronic dead beat character for 4 years because he was hot?! Don't get the Flash Gordon cocaine thing... Very random...

I saw This in The Theather. One of The Funniest movies I have ever seen.
It was Still as Funny when I bought it I laughed more. Bought This on Bluray Picture Quality was Great.
Extras Were Nice; The Making & bloopers were Fun.
There is a lot of Swearing but I do think That was part of the shock value Seth Macfarlane Wanted of Family Guy.
If you Like Family Guy Fans of seth Will love this. Some people don't like this kind of a dark comedy. Matter of choice i guess.
It is pretty hard to make me Laugh this one I really enjoyed.
Will be Watching it Again Tonight.

First,  I would like to say that this movie was, in my opinion, the worst movie I have ever had to sit through, with the exception of Town and Country.  A bear who smokes weed, does cocaine, simulates having sex, and jerking off,  cusses, and is downright offensive, but then suddenly is kind hearted and sensitive. How Seth MacFarlane could have had all these moments of potential comedy  but ended up with no humor, nothing  nada. Second, there was something wrong with watching a disney style film in this type of offensive genre. I couldn't help but think while watching this movie society is getting  desensitized to horridly bad comedy and jokes,  making us think its funny when its not. The dumbing down of America is complete - congratulations. I am a fan of raunchy well written movies like Hangover, Bridesmaids, Scary Movie but this movie didn't move me to one out loud giggle.  The story line was the clich dumb boy with crapy job gets pretty, smart, rich girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back because he promises to change. LAME, LAME, LAME.

The voice change for Ted didn't make any sense as why would a 'toy' change voices.  Glad I did it this way as saved me the cost of a DVD/Blu-Ray.

Which, let's be honest, is becoming harder and harder to find. Good, not so clean, fun, definitely not a family friendly movie, but hey, sometimes that's what we're looking for, right?! So if you are on the cusp of making a decision on this movie, I would definitely recommend it if your looking for a laugh, there are some AWESOME one liners and fantasy/weird camera shots.

There are laughs coming from everywhere in this flick which is to be expected when you're watching Seth MacFarlane, but I was surprised at the beauty of the storyline here. You wouldn't expect it, but this is a well written love story. Mila Kunis plays her role as a snobby girlfriend well, and Marky Mark plays the man caught between girl and Teddy Bear very well. Watching their story unfold is a joy.

If you're a family guy fan than this is a must see, and if not, as long as you can appreciated some dirty jokes and aren't easily offended, this movie will suit you well. Tune in to Ted and never look at another innocent teddy bear the same again.",1359417600,,899,4.50920245398773

This story of a young boy turned ""adult"" and his come to life Teddy Bear who both resemble the perpetual college roommates with nary a stated major. The multi-talented Mark Wahlberg fits the part very well and is truly believable as this guy with a gorgeous and exceptionally tolerant girlfriend (Mila Kunis) who always falls to the peer pressures of his life-long support system who is TED.
 This movie is certainly not for kids as the language, adult situations, and pure absurdity could leave scars in tender young minds!  Have you not seen ""Family Guy""?",1359331200,,735,4.682170542635659

4766221,2,B005LAII1C,"This movie does not live up to its hype--at least not for me.  The biggest mistake made by the writers was to try to make this both a feel-good-touching-heartfelt movie and a comedy.  The reality is that ""Ted"" fails at being both.

For a comedy, this movie made me laugh very few times; the few attempts at comedy were either random anti-Semitic comments, obscure sexual innuendo, or juvenile humor more appropriate for an audience of 14 year olds.  I wish MacFarlane would learn that excessive foul-language does not make any of the dialogue any funnier.  I do not really have a problem with explicit language, but when it is used excessively it contributes NOTHING to the movie in terms of comedy, nor does it contribute to the development of the characters or the plot.

As a ""heartwarming"" movie, the biggest problem is that the two main characters--Ted and John--are not sympathetic.  When John's girlfriend left him, I did not feel sorry for him.  Instead, I wondered why she had not left him sooner.  Plus, the comedy in this movie was built around vulgarity and offensive humor, which is fine, except that it does not exactly provide a good backdrop for ""heartwarming"" or ""feel-good"" moments.

Most people will probably watch this movie, regardless of anything they read in reviews--good or bad.  My two main problems with this movie are as follows:

1.)  I wanted to watch a good comedy movie, and I only laughed about 3 times while watching this movie.
2.)  I was expecting to at least be able to reference scenes in this movie to other people, yet the movie itself is not very memorable.  I can't think of any truly memorable quotes from this movie, nor can I recall any scenes from the movie that I would talk about to other people.",1359331200,,1744,4.690789473684211

The older Seth McFarlane gets, the more stupid he becomes. The first season of family guy was good, but since then he's delivered nothing but FCC approved soft-core pornographic garbage!

In fact if Ted were human we all would be saying how badly written the film was. I guess some people think that the fact that the lame comedy was coming from a stuffed teddy bear makes the lines funny.

It was real in the sense that the bear is just a regular guy and true to life best friend as any one would have, except he's a teddy bear.  I laughed from beginning to end.  And loved the ending as well when what life is about and best friendships come together.  I loved it. Two thumbs up!",1359158400,,379,4.081081081081081

The compelling minutes to me were the beginning and ending - where life comes into the bear and .... not to spoil.  Here I believed it.  But otherwise, it was hokey.  My wife, in a big surprise to me, liked it far better and she only tolerates F-G and Robot Chicken.  Go figure!",1359158400,2,485,4.095744680851064

They do a good job of bringing Ted to life so it seems he is real as you get into watching him. Plot is not too bad as Ted has to move out so his owner can get married. It's worth a look and you'll get a few good laughs. Not for kids but a bottle of wine or your favorite recreational drug will go good with this flick.,1359072000,,468,3.7373737373737375

Ted is not only hilarious, it's also very sweet which was a surprise.  The underlying themes of love and enduring friendship were coated with a heavy dose of the shock humor Macfarlane is famous for but this movie works in a way only he could pull off.  A guest appearance by Flash Gordon didn't hurt either, this movie is funny as h*ll and not afraid to show it.  I'd totally recommend it.",1358985600,,520,4.385416666666667

Considering Seth MacFarland created this character, i was surprised at what a good movie it was to ME. It's more than just a good comedy, there is a little reading between the lines - all combine to make this a pretty good movie. This has got to be one of my weirdest Reviews.

Definitely not something I would share with children as it is very R (or Unrated as the case may be) but if you are between 20-40 you will likely be right in the target audience.  Probably 30-40 to get the references to some of the 80's culture. :)

We started out with a rental and decided that this was definitely worth adding to the collection.

And it does have its share of that, but I didn't think it was as bad as the Hangover movies in that regard, and it's truly FUNNY, so that makes it worth it for me. What made it especially enjoyable was the performances and the heart at the center of it. The basic theme of a boy whose teddy-bear comes to life is carried off brilliantly, and serves as a great vehicle for the 'it's time for boy to grow into man' theme, which of course has been done to death, and needed an overhaul. Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis are both excellent, and lift it a bit above the standard comedies of this type. Seth MacFarlane as the voice of Ted was hilarious. I don't watch Family Guy, so can't speak to the complaints that Ted is basically a revamp of that character. The plot was so-so - standard rom-com breakup-get-back-together stuff, but it's the ride along the way that is truly unique and fun.",1358812800,,1055,4.306532663316583

The movie had several funny moments but really is no different from the TV show. The fact that Ted sounds exactly like Peter Griffin and Mila Kunis is in it as well did not help disguise the fact. If you like Family Guy you will probably enjoy it, but if you no longer find Family Guy edgy then this will be a long movie.",1358812800,,422,4.2875

For non-Flash Gordon fanatics, there is a lot here to like.  Starring a raunchy, sex-crazed, coked-up teddy bear, this film obviously doesn't take itself too seriously.  At the same time, there is warm-hearted Toy Story-ish theme throughout.

Mark Wahlberg does a great job playing a bit of a schlub with a sometimes unhealthy attachment to Ted, his childhood talking teddy bear.  Mila Kunis is good in the girlfriend role as she becomes increasingly irritated by Ted's constant presence in their lives.

Did I mention Flash Gordon?  Sam Jones's extended cameo was hilariously awesome.  Watching him and Wahlberg recreate the scene on the spacecraft from the Flash film was a treat and well worth the price of admission.",1358640000,,1019,5.746666666666667

THERE WAS NOTHING THERE TO WATCH? Did I miss something. I would love a way contact somebody and get my money back or maybe the movie put back on my list so I can actually watch it!

4768273,2,B005LAII1C,"We thought we would like this movie as the commericals looked interesting.  For one thing there was way too much bad language and sexual situations with the bear.  We should have realized, because it was made by the same people as American Dan and I can't stand that show.  Guess I expected more in a movie and find it was even worse.  NOT recommended.",1358553600,,352,4.453125

4768332,5,B005LAII1C,"Here is a movie that is funny as H%@#!! This the serious Mark Wahlberg who is normally beating up other guys in most movies but now in a completely different new light!! He is really quite good at comedy. Don't expect a plot or Oscar performance for anyone in this ""R"" movie. It is just full of sight gags and adult humor and beer bar style scenes. This is a guy that never grew up ... simple. Extremely clever dialog by Star Trek's Number #1 Patrick Stewart as the narrator is a pretty great way to start any movie. The final comment in his lead off narative had me rolling on the floor!! Funny.. and not expected! So all of those people that said ""Oh it could have been such a cute, romantic comedy"" ..or ""why did they have to use all of that language??"" ... ""Hello all of you wishing on a star people out there""...this movie was NOT made for you!! This is adult humor and adult comedy and plenty of adult language...so get real...if this kind of thing bothers you.. do not rent it or buy it or watch it. Simple. It is a matter of choice and we all have the ability to choose what we like, and I for one really liked this movie. So am I a bad guy? No, just have a wide range of tastes that include a love for any ""B"" Movie. And I have watched alot of movies in my life and enjoyed them all.

4768334,3,B005LAII1C,"Very comical movie.  I will watch this again due to the fact I purchased it, but should have rented before buying.  Some of the humor just goes to far for a Teddy Bear.  But overall good story.",1358467200,,193,4.162162162162162

It's stupid and I should have realized that before I bought it but I used to think that the person who recommended it had some degree of intelligence.  I guess I was mistaken.  This would be a good movie for children if it weren't for all of the profanity.  Actually it sort of bridges the gap between being a good children's movie and a bad adult movie, or maybe not.

4768822,4,B005LAII1C,"i watched this movie in Korea.
It has so many fun moments.
But the thing is the Korean audiences didn't know what to do when the funny parts came out.
They just didn't know how to respond!
Am I supposed to laugh at that part or is this kinda dirty joke? They were confused!
For instence, when the Teddy is playing with the lotion at the supermarket to look like he is jurking off, people in the theater were all very very quiet. Is this a joke or dirty sexual stuff?
I know what to do but tried not to laugh out loud.
I bought it in DVD just to study more.
Did I liked it? It was ok. It reminds me of A.I(Spielberg's) movie that Teddy also appears.
I am a filmmaker and need to learn more about my people-Korean (Asian)
The picuture and sound are all good.
Think no need to buy it in a bluray because it's not a masterpiece or anything.",1358380800,,836,4.072727272727272
4768823,5,B005LAII1C,This movie is a funny movie that since Seth McFarlane wrote you know it is gonna be hilarious with off the wall comedy. This would not be a good idea to let kids watch this because of some of the jokes that are made in the movie,1358380800,,228,3.872340425531915

Personally, I do not think it is funny to make fun of rape, relationships, kidnapping, child abuse and etc.

I am extremely sarcastic and like ""pushing the boundaries"" in my humor (hence my like for Family Guy); however, this was beyond  ... it was just tacky and terrible.

The jokes and humor in the movie is what you would expect from an R rated comedy, and is crass more often than not, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have heart; quite the opposite in fact. The movie is actually quite heartwarming and a tad emotional. Wahlberg is great as the stoner Bostonian and continues to prove he has a place in comedy. There's quite a few hilarious moments, as well as countless references to pop culture that usually accompany them. Overall this movie is what you might expect from MacFarlane, but adds a slight touch of emotion to make it that much better.",1358294400,,701,4.616

Wahlberg and Kunis are both good enough, but it's Ted and his lines that make this work when it does, which is at least half the time. It could have gotten far more mawkish than it did, but SM cut it pretty tight and shows a good feel for the big screen. There's cheese but it's usually very self-aware, which makes it quite funny.

Some scenes were pointless to me, like the model dumpage, but hey, if something here doesn't offend you then you are well nigh unoffendable, and more power to you!

The blu-ray has some nice extras, including a good gag reel and making of, and I like that the effects are used solely to make the bear come to pretty believable life. That and the constant swipes at Hollywood fakeness, romcom and other film tropes tropes and the vapidity of our modern consumer culture make this not just crude but also very smart in its own way.

Would not recommend it to anyone unless they were someone like the character that Mark wahlberg played in this movie.

Those ARE NOT bad things. I read a few of the reviews on here about this movie and rolled my eyes so hard I think I pulled something.

***This is movie about a man and his loud mouth, real life teddy bear***

What were you expecting - Oscar gold? Why is it people can't just enjoy something funny anymore without finding it offensive or upsetting? Just enjoy it for what it is.

My review is as follows: I haven't laughed this hard during a movie in a long, long time. And (Spoiler Alert) when that Teddy Bear lost his life to some crazed lunatic, his stuffing spread across the field, yes I shed a tear. Sure, you know he's going to live and it'll be a happy ending but who cares? It's awesome.

Seth McFarlane is one of the greatest funnymen out there. Mila Kunis is beautiful, Mark Wahlberg is hilarious and together they are a wonderful set. You can't help but like this guy who hasn't quite grown up and lives his life smoking pot with a stuffed toy, watching TV and finding ways to skip out on work. Mila Kunis is his incredibly patient GF who loves him and yet often wishes he wanted more out of life.

The key to this movie is to let yourself go and not think too hard about what's going on. Sure, it won't change your life but for 200+ minutes, you'll find that all your troubles melt away and you'll really, truly have a good time.",1357862400,,1610,4.385906040268456

Mark Whalberg and Mila Kunis were great in the movie, and Seth McFarland did a wonderful job voicing Ted (I mean, of course he did...he's created Family Guy and voiced many of the characters on it).  It was awesome seeing Flash Gordon in it too, LoL.

Rather funny movie.  This one guy and his kid that are after Ted...a little creepy, but added to both the humor and suspense in the movie.  Good morale about the value of true friendship.

Mila Kunis also a very fine job and the character reacted in a more realistic view than we generally get in the movies.  Seth Macfarlane as Ted had all the right inflections not as easy to do when you are playing to a green screen (I am making an assumption here) as when you appear in person.

4771256,3,B005LAII1C,"Since we see many of the voice actors from Seth MacFarlane's crew in person here, and since the humor is pretty much the same as Family Guy, this was just kind of like watching a decent, very long, episode of Family Guy or American Dad. For example, they make fun of the fact that the voice of Peter is the voice of the bear at least a billion times, which is old after the first time they do it. The novelty of the talking, cursing bear, is over in about 20 minutes as well. Still, there were a few funny moments, and if you like Family Guy, or that style of humor, then renting this in non-HD format is worth it. There are no special effects, or sound considerations here, that really benefit from an HD rental or purchase. I would strongly encourage you to rent, and not purchase, this movie.

I politely disagree. Though it did have quite a few humorous lines (most of which were already seen in the commercials), the movie itself was more gratting on the nerves than anything. The sappy crap storyline made me want to gag and the plot line was to pradicatable. The sound got messed up in a few places in a way that made it blatenty obvious which was from a recording studio and which was from the scene being filmed. Over all its humor is more for the immature, which is kind of condicending for me to say given that I am fourteen.

It could have been so much better without the over-the-top language and sophomoric humor.  (Seth, was your goal to use every nasty word known to humans?)  I was embarrassed by several lines and scenes - embarrassed for the actors and everyone else involved in making this movie.  Having said this; the premise, the life metaphor, the lessons learned - all very clever and even sweet at times And there were definitely some laugh-out-loud moments, but mostly, there were ""Oh no!  Did he/she really just say that?!""  I just wish Macfarlane had taken a tip from Wahlberg's character and grown up a little more before making this film so it could have appealed to a wider audience.

What makes the movie is how the Teddy bear transforms your viewpoint of what a Teddy bear would be like if it could talk and come alive and grow up with you into adulthood. Some of the movie was terribly over blown with trying to be dramatic and make this a romantic comedy which I found that to be more of a stretch for the movie then anything.

Some of the jokes are hilarious, and some aren't. Like Family Guy you also get some recycled stuff that you've pretty much seen or heard before. John's fight with Ted was funny but reminiscent of a few of the Stewie vs Brian, Chris vs Meg shticks. Ted's hot blonde checkout girl has the most annoying accent - you can see why the previews didn't feature her talking! John and Ted make all the good jokes. There are lots of other stars and cameos, but I didn't think any of them added anything. 3 stars for a one-time comedy rental.

Darkness cannot stand the Light, and will strike out against the Light. However, Light wins every time.

A subplot involving a father and son who have ill intentions toward Ted feels tacked on and unnecessary, but otherwise it's a great mindless raunchy comedy.",1357516800,,468,4.948717948717949

The story of a boy that needs to grow up when confronted by adult life and crises is a time honored tale.

The animation and voice acting was fabulous.

So, where did the story go wrong?  I appreciate Seth MacFarlane's sense of humor (and his singing voice, check out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Music-Is-Better-Than-Words/dp/B004T5IW2K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Music Is Better Than Words</a>).  He has been willing to gore sacred cows in many walks of life.  MacFarlane's irreverence is refreshing, and like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robot-Chicken-Season-Five/dp/B005CHTXWC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robot Chicken: Season Five</a>&nbsp;about 10% of his jokes are pants wettingly funny, 80% are amusing, and 10% just fall flat.  Those are pretty good odds for humor across such a wide front.

Unfortunately in the case of Ted, there was about 25% that were just horribly offensive.  I'm no prude and can certainly laugh at myself, my culture, my religion, etc.  ""Family Guy"" and ""American Dad"" have their moments, but generally there is only one or two missteps an episode.  In Ted, the level of callousness and crudity were past the line enough to make the film unfunny.  I'm not talking about political correctness.  When Ted tells his manager that he used produce to fornicate with and then sold it to an indigent family, it does not come off as funny.  And, the examples are legion.

The other major issue I have is that Ted drew in a fair number of kids.  It is a movie about a talking teddy bear after-all.  I heard a couple of boys that appeared to be between 9-10 talking about Ted on the Metro last week.  Sure, sure, where are the parents, but I could imagine some parents screwing up by letting their very young kids watch a movie about a talking teddy bear.  You don't want to know which parts the boys were hooting about.  :-(

I just watched a new episode of Family Guy last night and mostly enjoyed it.

Yes the same voice that does Peter does Ted (Seth McFarlane) and there is even a passing joke at the expense of that. But even if you were to approach this as a novice of McFarlanes other work you would appreciate the humour. It's along the same vein as a lot of the Judd Appatow style comedy with a ot of bad language but you hear that anywhere these days so it's no use being too easily offended or else you would never leave home anymore
It is a classic buddy movie where both the main characters are dope smoking slackers and content in their rut.
Mark Wahlberg's character is great, he is weak unreliable and a total underachiever both at work and in his love of Mila Kunis.
Look out for a delightfully offbeat performance by the ever gifted Giovanni Ribisi as a dark and tormented character

It is a laugh a minute with Patrick Stewart narrating occasionally, with nothing but hilarious things to say. If you pay attention or know Seth McFarlane's work you'll notice a lot of familiar voices, and of course a great cameo by Sam Jones (Flash Gordon) as himself. My favorite seen has to be the discussion between Mark Wahlberg and Patrick Warburton about his black eye. This one goes in my Classic comedy section which includes Blazzing Saddles,  Spaceballs, Three Amigos, The Other Guys, Cop Out, Christmas Vacation, Animal House, The Hangover, Superbad, Role Models, and Harold and Kumar: escape from  guantanamo bay to name a few.

He forgot about the story and tried to make every scene as offensively funny as possible instead. He failed completely. The movie Borat is one of the few movies that (sort of) got away with this type of approach. Ted (the unrated version anyway) fails completely.

There are middle school boys who could make up something better than this.  It's little more than an excuse to spew a lot of dirty words--as if the characters, like little kids, have just discovered them.

Prior to this I had some respect for Mark Wahlberg and his much-touted ""family man"" image.  No more.  Does he let his own  small children hear this sort of thing or talk this way?  I have no problem with ""mature"" plots and language, but ""Ted"" is just a bunch of gratuitous foul utterances and repulsive situations strung together for maximum ""shock"" value.  For this I'm supposed to pay good money?  There are genuine porn producers who would be embarrassed to present such a dimwitted disaster.

Seriously, a hooker who defecates on the floor in the midst of an orgy with a teddy bear?  Is MacFarlane kidding?  Yuck!  Is he just giving us a peek into his own weirdly quirky adolescent fantasies?  If so, I'd rather he keep them to himself instead of inviting me to pay to witness their being played out on the screen.

Words (clean ones at least) cannot describe how dreadful ""Ted"" is.

Color me ""repulsed,"" ""sickened,"" and ""cheated.""

I understood the references and where Seth was trying to go with things, it simply didn't work. The movie seemed like it was too long and should have been shortened.

However, as an adult, I enjoyed it very much. It's not overly gross (which isn't something I'm a fan of), but it does have shock-value moments. Has a weird sweetness to it as well. Mila Kunis and Mark Walhburg are great.

One case in point was Family Guy's Christmas special hosted by his dad...not sure why anyone needs such specific references to bodily functions, but you will see the same sickness in Ted.  At times it is a very cute movie and some dirty male jokes are fine...but this movie makes you wonder:  That wasn't funny....it actually made me heave...why would a sane person put that in a mainstream movie?  I have the same issue with many of the more recent comedies done by the SNL crowd and National Lampoon.  Some dirt and nudity is fun, but the obsession with detailed bodily functions is disgusting and other movies filled with weird deviant sex often takes the place of a well-developed storyline aimed at entertaining the non-porno folks.",1357171200,2,869,4.9655172413793105

Constrained by the requirements of telling an actual movie length story with real (somewhat) characters, McFarlane brings everything that *works* about ""Family Guy"" to the table while dropping the self-indulgent too-long gags and other padding that are often used to stretch a good 10 minute sketch idea into a 30 minute episode of the sitcom.

4773908,2,B005LAII1C,"This flick starts off with a lot of hope. Mark Wahlberg has done enough successful dramas to make any comedic appearance a must see. He did not disappoint--he was serious enough here to reach the end with no criticism. Sure enough this guy has matured to the point where he can play practically anything and do it WELL.

Ted? Well, having been a fan of The Family Guy in its early days, it is apparent that Seth MacFarlane's comedic mind probably stopped growing sometime in his Junior year at College. Ted IS Peter Griffin morphed into a computer-generated teddy bear. Nothing less. Nothing more.

Had MacFarlane spent a few more days tweaking the jokes, the bear might have remained loveable as it was in the first five minutes of the movie. Settling for the sophomoric though made watching Ted a slow journey from laughter to intense dislike. By the end of the movie I thought it so apropos that Ted's soul was shredded into cotton balls and lifeless cloth that for a minute, the shock of seeing the bear resurrected totally destroyed my belief in karma.

This movie gets two stars only because ZERO stars isn't offered to reviewers and because Mark Wahlberg hung in there to the end. Oh, and the girlfriend...what's her name?...oh, LORI!

It didn't, or at least it didn't in the first 20 minutes, so I switched to something else. Maybe it got better after that, but by then I could have cared less about any of the actors, especially Ted. Think ""Fred Flintstone with a mouth and a wicked hangover,"" and you've pretty much nailed the teddy bear and his movie.

I did get a kick out of the southie (Boston) accents, made me homesick. But that's about it.",1357084800,,689,4.375

4773955,2,B005LAII1C,"My wife and I just rented this from Amazon Instant Video.  It was not funny, meaning 3-4 out of every 5 jokes was not funny, or way overdone.  Kind of a shame since the premise is a great one.  The problem with Seth Macfarlane in our opinion is two-fold.
First, he is doing an R-rated movie opposed to a TV show, so took every chance to swear or be over the top as possible.  The South Park guys did this, too, but the South Park and Team America movies were for the most part, funnier than this result.
And second - the ""Jar Jar syndrome""... Seth is King of his Hill with a hit TV show and fans who love anything he does no matter what, right or wrong, funny or not.  So what do you get?  Self serving comedy that isn't broad enough for anybody but those crazed fans.  And just like George Lucas never got told Jar Jar was ridiculous and would kill the franchise, nobody would probably tell SM anything he was doing wasn't funny because he's just suuuch a genious.

I suppose he may not wanted to have drawn too many comparisons with Family Guy or maybe he was trying to broaden his scope but either way, Ted feels half finished. Wahlberg acted his part well and the scenes with the bear are frequently funny but as a whole, I think either more time creating the story, or less time rewriting the story would have made for a much better movie.",1357084800,,509,4.204081632653061

While the explicit, graphic drug use might make it unsuitable for some viewers, those who can get past that should be in for some out loud laughs and lots of them.  Much of the humor is way over the top and outrageous, but if you appreciate Seth Macfarlane's humor in ""Family Guy,"" you will get it.  While I appreciate that animated series, I don't watch it regularly.  This movie may get me to begin doing so.
The acting is surprisingly high quality and the story holds together well.  Patrick Stewart as the narrator makes the movie have an almost Monty Python air of high British satire.",1357084800,,645,4.478632478632479

But we're not fond of language that uses homophobia as a weapon. We've seen Seth MacFarlane on talk shows and he seems like a cool guy, who probably doesn't even realize that using words like gay, and homo, as a derogatory IS bigoted and homophobic. Yes, we are well aware that this is how straight boys talk. However, that doesn't make it any less homophobic. I think where we went wrong, was renting this Unrated version. I bet the Regular version cut some of that foul crap out. There's only 4 minutes or so difference between the 2 versions of the film. So you know neither version is all that different from the other; probably they just stuck back in the foul language, which offers nothing to drive the plot forward, and is certainly humorless. Jokes in good fun is one thing; but that's not what was happening here. We're gonna give Seth a pass on this one, and not assume the worst of him. But we're writing this review to answer the 1 specific question that we had when we rented it. Had we seen a review like this, we'd have known NOT to bother, and we did search the reviews for specific words, gay and homophobic. You can see this kind of juvenile crap from a mile away. We should have trusted our instincts. Homophobes excuse this kind of behavior, and call any protest of it 'political correctness gone overboard' -- we call it bigotry and stupidity, plain and simple. I'm giving it 2 stars for the original concept. Avoid if you care about this sort of thing, if not... go ahead, you might like it. We asked Amazon for a refund.",1356998400,,1707,4.439490445859873

4775913,4,B005LAII1C,"..when I say I enjoyed the film, but felt more gags could have been thrown in.

I think with Family Guy the medium of animation allows it to have a constant stream of gags some of which are funny, some not, well, in Ted, the need to develop and sustain a story arc means that some scenes were over long and the gag count wasn't a high as might be expected. As ever, and I seem to do this a lot, those reviewers who moan about the film being ""crass"", ""gross"" ""crude"" etc, read the bloody box before you watch it, because you get exactly what you expect in the Seth McFarlane vehicle, please, please, please, if you don't want to hear rude words watch something more suitable to your sensibilities like ""The Sound of Music"", I mean its like saying ""I bought 'Inglourious Basterds'only to be shocked and offended that the title was spelt incorrectly and contained a profanity that surely the Lord Jesus would not have approved of"". I believe the phrase the young folk would use to describe this dichotomy is ""facepalm"" which probably and more accurately should be two hyphenated words, but who am I to quibble.

Please, understand this, Ted is rude and not a childrens film. If you can get past these 2 potential deal breakers, then you should be at a suitable start point to watch the film, sure and safe in the knowledge that you are not going to be surprised. If you have failed the grasp or understand these important paradigms, please replace the dvd back on the shelf and back away slowly, If it has been delivered to your home, place it in a bucket of sand and carefully move it to the bottom of the garden whilst reciting the Lords prayer.

McFarland did the voice of Ted, but it sounded like Peter (dad in Family Guy), so that was distracting throughout the whole movie.  But it was the crude jokes and language that went way too far for me.  I especially didn't appreciate the gay bashing or the ""retard"" reference.  I kept thinking it would get better, but that never happened.  Nothing made me laugh or even crack a smile.

How is that a teddy bear comes alive and NO ONE is fazed by that in the absolutely ridiculous world that is built around it.
The bear sounds like Peter from Family Guy, which is understandable as its the same person who wrote and created the characters on the show.
The movie played out like some of the Family Guys as of late, the potential to be funny is there, but it misses its mark. Cherry Chevapravatdumrong, one of the original writers of Family Guy, wrote some of the best episodes that I can remember about the show and she should have had her hand in writing this script.

At first glance when I first saw the ads on TV, I thought it looked kind of stupid, despite liking Seth and his shows, but after hearing about it, I decided it might be worth a viewing.

Got it for my mom for Christmas, seeing as she likes Family Guy, and we watched it together. We watched the theatrical version, seeing as I didn't think my mother would enjoy the unrated version, and overall, we both thought it was pretty good.

It was more profane, but not as crude, as we expected it to be. The laughs were certainly there, but it wasn't nearly as funny as I had it described to me. I had it described to me as one of the funniest movies my friends had seen, and while I thought it was funny enough, it didn't think it was that much funnier than the average, run of the mill comedy that seems to come out every week. What I wasn't expecting was that it would be as ""deep"" as it was. I thought it would be pretty shallow on plot, but I have to say, it wasn't bad.

I'd like to see Seth have his hand at another movie (Family Guy movie, **hint** **hint**), but it certainly wasn't bad.",1356825600,,1295,4.126984126984127

I made it just barely through the party scene with Flash Gordon when I realized I was thoroughly bored of the movie and shut it off.

If you are into the mindless single-joke comedies, I guess this would be ok for you.  For me, however?  No.

The more I think about it, I think having the bear be voiced by Seth's Peter Griffin persona was a big part of the problem.  About half an hour into the movie (or the length of a single Family Guy episode) I realized how much funnier it would have been if someone like Joe Pesci had done the voiceover.

I hated Hangover and Hangover 2 cause they were so boring I never smiled or laughed out loud even once.  You may find it dragging on just a bit as Family Guy episodes are only 20 minutes long and this is almost 2 hours.

He gave his fans exactly what they expected. 'Ted' is film filled with belly laughs and fun to be had. The cast does their jobs at being rude crude and totally inappropriate and at the same time gives the viewer a heartfelt story about friendship. Although being the perfectionist that Seth Macfarlane is I feel that there were certain points of the movie that looked like they went the extra mile when they really didn't have to. I don't want to spoil it so you will have to see it for yourself. This may not be a film that people will want to watch over and over, but those who love this kind of humor and love the artist that began his career in 1999 to purposely break all possible barriers will definitely enjoy 'Ted'",1356739200,,881,4.313253012048193

4777396,1,B005LAII1C,"I'd give this movie a negative 50 stars if they let me! Now I know that I will get a lot of nasty comments about what I say in this review, but personally I DON'T CARE! This movie uses bad clones of overly recycled jokes that have been spewed from the bottom 1% of National Lampoon movies & the 4 dreadful direct to DVD American Pie films & worse yet, those are the movie's ""good parts"". Family Guy was funny in its original run but when it came back, the witty & quirky spirt was lost. But it still made money, lots of money! So now we have ""Ted"", either a cheep flick thats sole purpose is to make money or Seth MacFarlane is more stupid than I originally thought. The plot falls flat, the jokes are painfully predictable, you find yourself wanting it to be over less than halfway through the film etc... I know that there are many people out there who love this piece of trash, so I say to them, ""Watch an older comedy movie & then reexamine your opinion on 'Ted'. And please, ignore the 'Hard-R' movies of the 90's."" The first American Pie film is a modern classic but it spawned a slew of crappy copy-cats. Try one of those basic cable classic-movie channels. From Abbott & Costello to Ferris Bueller, you can do much better than ""Ted"". If Justin Bieber is junk food for the mind, the ""Ted' is arsenic for the mind!",1356739200,6,1320,4.284

4777892,4,B005LAII1C,"This movie is hilarious despite all the funniest moments having been in the trailers.  They do a good job of editing the trailer so there are still a few surprises.  It was like watching a live action movie version of an episode of The Family Guy.  Very funny movie.  I didn't give it 5 stars because for one, the trailers kind of give away too many of the funny parts.  Two, Mark Walberg sort of over does the Boston accent which is odd because he's supposed to be this Boston home grown star.

Definitely worth seeing but so much prfanity please don't let your youngsters watch it.

Update: so after watching this movie (I have the unrated version) a dozen more times (always hilarious) I realized that the part that I thought was a bad editing mistake was actually intentional.  There's a scene where Mark Walberg's character John is ipersonating Ted talking to him.  I thought ""John"" called Ted John but it was John talking to himself as Ted in Ted's voice to illustrate that Ted sounds like Peter Griffin.",1356739200,,1010,4.566666666666666

Seth Mcfarlane could have chosen a different personal idol for Mark Wahlberg's character other than Flash Gordan as well.

The storyline seemed very strange to me. But almost right out of the gate the movie was funny, we were all dying laughing, busting our guts laughing at certain scenes. It's different from the other ""dumb"" comedies that seemed to signify 2011 and 2012.

NOT, I repeat NOT A MOVIE FOR CHILDREN at all.  Yeah, there's a cute Teddy Bear that starts in the film, but the character is about as crude as one might imagine, coming from the input/help of Seth McFarlane.

One thing to be cautious of - If you have an HD TV (or whatever kind of media system you are using), be sure to select the ""HD"" version of the movie.  We accidentally selected the ""Standard Definition"" version and while it was still watchable, it would have been infinitely more enjoyable in hi-definition.  It would have been worth the extra $1 to have rented the ""HD"" version.

I enjoy Family Guy, so even though I wasn't feeling confident after the preview, I rented the movie, figuring there would be at least a few laughs.  And there were.  There were about as many laughs in Ted as there are in a 22-minute episode of Family Guy, about 3-4 genuine laughs out loud.  The rest was a mess of ""clever"" bits that weren't so clever and vulgarities that forgot to be funny, as if McFarlane was so excited to write for an R-rating that he felt the need to indiscriminately cram as many in as possible.  His cutaway vignette style, so often used in Family Guy and forced into this movie, does not translate well to live action film.  I really wanted to enjoy this movie.  If it had been 20 minutes long, I might have.  Joel McHale is standout as the smarmy boss, Mila Kunis is believably long-suffering, and Mark Wahlberg does his best, but I think he was miscast.  I won't rule out seeing another film from McFarlane in the future, but he will have to prove that he can do more than make the same joke over and over (eg: a teddy bear says something surprisingly crass!) to wring more enjoyment from me.",1356652800,3,1244,4.341991341991342

He just doesn't look like a guy who would have a Teddy Bear until he is 35, so funny number one. Then of course everything else. I loved this movie, it is a complete guy movie. My wife didn't appreciate it as much as me but she did chuckle now and again.",1356566400,,385,3.825

While the movie had some funny moments, and it wasn't god awful, I didn't find the side-splitting moments that I heard others had experienced. As a child of the 80's, I did enjoy the pop culture references, and it was a bonus to discover that the guy who played Flash Gordon was still alive, but all in all the movie didn't live up to the hype. It didn't help that I couldn't get past the fact that the bear sounded like Peter Griffin. Glad I only spent $1.99 on the Amazon rental vs seeing it in the movies.",1356566400,,638,4.195121951219512

If you find beyond-excessive profanity, bongs and Boston accents funny, you might find this movie mildly amusing. However, I could recommend a number of other films with the same elements which manage to have more than a shallow and annoyingly repetitive shell of a plot. Your time could be equally well spent riding a city bus around with a bunch of juvenile boys. The writing is not intelligent and even the fart jokes are pathetic.
It's a shame so many notables made cameo appearances in this film, as they all came off looking like sleazy idiots (yes, even Norah Jones).

I thought I was open minded, but maybe not so much.

4781786,5,B005LAII1C,"Remember the movie, There's Something About Mary? That was the first comedy that was, not just pretty funny, but funny enough to make me gasp for air. I would have told you at that time that no other movie will EVER be made that makes me laugh that hard.... that is, I would have. TED is now my personal ""funniest movie ever made"" by a long shot. Admittedly, I am a huge fan of Family Guy and Seth MacFarlane's work in general, so it's difficult to start into this movie without bias. You won't find any sugar coating in this movie. It is 100% Classic MacFarlane, only made for theaters and Blu-Ray. One could only imagine the limits MacFarlane would achieve outside of TV (Family Guy), without fear of FCC fines. Well, the unfiltered MacFarlane will not disappoint fans at all. The MacFarlane Hater crowd will only grow as well. In fact, all negative reviews for this movie probably stem from this crowd. I am happy I don't even know anyone that shallow.

If you have children, send them to Grandma's house. This is not even one of those, ""we'll just send them to bed and watch it then"" movies. You don't want your children anywhere near this movie. Hell, the bear spends the first half of the movie pulling hits off the bong and the second half dry-humping everyone/everything. It is truly funny.",1356307200,,1298,4.547008547008547

This time one of the slacker friends is a teddy bear.

The humor, the writing and dialogue is a just an extended family guy episode. And not a very good one. Save your money, if you want some laughs just watch some family guy.",1356307200,,596,4.418181818181818

Very little funny about constantly seeing a teddy bear with a bong, and the Oriental newscaster striking his female co-anchor. Walhberg's character and acting were so good in ""The Shooter"", it's a shame to see him going in this direction. C'mon Hollywood, if you are going to put out this kind of garbage, at least let the consumer watch the first fifteen minutes of the movie before they put out any money for a copy.",1356307200,2,470,4.607142857142857

My wife and I felt that to use a teddy bear which generally represents love and cuddling, sends the wrong message to our children or whomever may end up seeing this crap. The cursing, the sex,the drugs, and story line...all garbage. There are some movies that may not be ""G"" rated that express opinions or views that are not so repulsive.

We hope that Seth McFarlane will become more creative to consider his audiences and also hope those that find this entertaining will see this as nothing but what it is...junk. Seems that somehow we have become desensitized.

At a time when our youth need guidance, lets give them a helping hand. Let them know you can have a good time without being profane or distasteful.

4783015,4,B005LAII1C,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

Ahhh... Marky Mark. I have to admit that I was originally attracted to this movie because I love when Wahlberg takes a break from his serious movies to loosen up a little bit. Then I saw the first, mature audience, trailer and I wanted to see this because it looked like it was going to be a great movie with or without Wahlberg. Thankfully it was.

As most of you already know the film starts with a young John Bennett who is kind of a loner. No one really likes him so he doesn't have any friends. He's kind of the outcast on the street. Well one Christmas he gets a teddy bear which he calls Ted (very original John). Ted winds up being his best friend and then one night he makes a wish that Ted could really talk to him. Then the next morning, as luck would have it, Ted was alive. I'll leave it at that so as not to spoil the movie but fast forward twenty years later and we have the John (Wahlberg) and Ted (MacFarlane) of today. The movie's premise is simple enough. John's being an outcast makes him befriend this teddy bear which makes him unable to become a mature, functioning, member of society. That's where Lori (Kunis) comes in.

Even though the main story was a little cliche at times I still found it enjoyable. However there is a side story that I found extremely corny, unenjoyable, and kind of predictable. In short there's a man named Donny (Giovanni Ribisi) who was in love with Ted when he was a little boy, but his parents said there was no way he could have him because there was only one Ted and he belonged to John Bennett. Well Donny has a son named Robert (Aiden Mincks). Donny vowed that he would never let his child down no matter what he wanted and, of course, Robert wants Ted. The entire thing felt forced and it seemed like they were just trying to add something to the story that wasn't entirely necessary.

One of the main elements that grabbed me while watching the movie was its pacing. Now there's two different forms of pacing when it comes to comedy films. The comedy and the story. In terms of the story I think it could have been a little better. Sure in the beginning they give you John's back story, but we never see when John started becoming somewhat of a screw up. And why is Donny such a weirdo? A lot of the information just seems kind of thrust at you. In terms of the comedy I think they nailed it. They start out immediately with small things like a kid getting beat up and John comes out to say if he could play with them. Then everyone, even the kid getting beat up, say something along the lines of ""Go home Bennett no one likes you."" Then they work their way up to things like John and Ted doing cocaine with Sam Jones.

Overall Score: 8/10 - While I don't agree with the ""Funniest movie of all time"" comment on the back of the box, Ted is still a very enjoyable film. Filled with a lot of laughs and a touching main story that is sure to make you fall in love with not just John and Ted, but Lori as well. I would definitely recommend checking this out if you're looking for an entertaining movie.",1356220800,,3108,4.269949066213922

I think I find this so funny because of Ted and his strong Boston accent and the tie in to the movie Flash Gordon, which I remember loving as a kid myself.

The vulgarity is abundant and does not pull any punches, but it is all relevant.

Perhaps over the top at times (but that's what the movie is going for), Ted kept me entertained from start to finish.

The humor is often rude & crude, but expectations should be set for that knowing that Family Guy creator MacFarlane directed, produced and wrote the movie. There is silliness, ridiculousness and corny 'o plenty, along with a well put together story that had me mostly smiling or laughing for over 90 minutes. Keep in mind that prior to the DVD release this was an R rated movie, so don't make the mistake of thinking that this is some cute for the kids teddy bear comes to life movie. The R rated version earned its R, and the unrated version will delight fans of...well...unrated stuff.

If you're looking for laughs you'll certainly find some in Ted. If you're not a fan of Family Guy humor, then move to the next movie in your queue.

Many of my friends have raved about how funny it is, and it received a number of good reviews from professional critics. So, when I finally sat down this afternoon to watch it on Amazon Instant Video, I was surprised by how bored I was with the film.

(For the uninitiated: the plot of the film revolves around a guy who wished for a talking teddy bear when he was a kid and as an adult must choose between this stuffed animal (aka his best friend) and his girlfriend.)

Given the reviews and Seth MacFarlane's involvement, I expected good execution. Unfortunately, the premise of the film felt contrived, and I never bought into it. After the halfway point, there were multiple times when I thought ""This must be the end."" and was excited because it meant that I could take a nap. There were crass jokes (which I expected), and then there were jokes that seemed less like jokes and more just like excuses to dump on gay men and people with mental disabilities.

In the end, I wish that I had never wasted the money or the time watching this.",1356048000,,1115,4.455882352941177

And Ralph Garmen as the Dad..he does voicework for Family Guy, and does Hollywood Babelon podcasts with Kevin Smith. Could have used more of him in the film.

And Sam jones...wow whoever came up with him t add spice to the plot..well cool. We don;t see enough Flash in the world now.",1356048000,,469,4.142857142857143

All the cameos are only to do Marky Mark a favor here and none of it is funny.  I think Mila Kunis knew it was a stinker when she read it but Marky Mark made her some monetary promise.

However, all I can say is, I'm glad the Blu-Ray version comes with a regular DVD, because, for whatever reason, the Blu-Ray disc cannot be recognized by my My Panasonic DMP-BD60.  The firmware is up-to-date, and every other BD I have plays perfectly on it. Unfortunately, though, it seems Ted won't play in it, so I'm stuck using the regular DVD.

And, for the record, the disc is also unrecognized by my PS3 and both my DVD PC drives. I can't help wondering if my BD copy is simply defective or if my BD60 is becoming obsolete.  I'm sure I'll do a little more troubleshooting before giving up (or coming to any conclusions), but any help or input is welcome.

EDIT (5/15/13): Well, as it turns out, the Blu-Ray disc wasn't defective at all. It seems that the disc is incompatible with my slightly older Panasonic DMP-BD60 (and the PS3 and CD-ROM drivers).

There isn't another movie like this out there, it is nice to see something so original come out of Hollywood!

Mark Wahlberg does a excellent job on this movie. Most of the time he was reacting to air, which had to be hard, but he pulls it offs with ease. The fight scene is a very good representation of this. This had got to be one of Marks best films, he really helps to suck you into the story, and in some weird way believe it.

The jokes are hackneyed and unfunny. Everything has a been-there-done-that feel to it. Seth MacFarlane doesn't even try to make a new voice for the titular character, it's just Peter Griffin as a bear.

Mark Wahlberg strikes little new ground beyond his other recent forays into comedy such as ""The Other Guys"". He's proven he's a decent comedic actor (he still rocks way more in dramas), but this clearly wasn't his best choice for another move in that direction.

4785625,3,B005LAII1C,"American Hollywood comedies have for a while been obsessed with the archetype of the American man-child. I'm not sure which film first started the trend, but Adam Sandler and Judd Apatow have certainly championed it. In so many recent Hollywood comedies, the main character has been a grown man, in his twenties or thirties, who seems to be stuck in perpetual adolescence. The characters are usually smart and witty but lazy and underachieving, have a penchant for drinking or smoking weed and a juvenile sense of humor, but yet - underneath it all - a heart of gold. Despite a wild premise, ""Ted"" is, at its core, another film in the pantheon of comedies featuring the archetype of the American man-child.

John (Mark Wahlberg) starts the film as a lonely little boy who makes a wish that his teddy bear will come to life and be his best friend forever. His wish is granted, and ""Ted"" not only turns from stuffed animal to sentient being, but also becomes an international celebrity. The film then flashes forward 25 or so years later, when John is now a 35 year old rental car service employee who still lives with his sentient teddy bear, whose novelty fame wore off years ago. Only now, the two both speak in adult Boston accents, and enjoy sitting around getting high, watching ""Flash Gordon"" and making scatological jokes.

This would all be well and good if not for Lori (Mila Kunis), John's girlfriend. Like most films featuring the American man-child, the man-child has somehow managed to attract a beautiful, smart, poised and successful woman. So although Lori loves John, after several years together she begins growing tired of having to share her boyfriend with his crass, pot-smoking teddy bear, and begins wanting a more mature relationship. And so it begins - will John be able to move on from his adolescent inertia in order to hold onto his girl?

For the record - this film is very funny. I laughed out loud many times. But underneath the original premise, outrageous humor and overall weirdness that the film often employs, the story of the man-child whose too-perfect girlfriend forces him to finally grow up is incredibly played out.",1355961600,,2156,4.821621621621621

Later when I rented this movie to watch it again, alone, I realized just how stupid and plot-less this movie was. There were still some parts that gave a chuckle but I found myself getting up multiple times to do other things and not really paying attention to the movie. If you are a guy who likes to smoke pot and live your personal fantasies then this movie will be your favorite. But if you are someone who likes more realistic humor then this movie will be a vast disappointment. I believe this movie is only good the first time around ( I wouldn't recommend buying it) or it could have just been funny because of the company I was with.",1355961600,,801,4.276315789473684

There were several parts that were kinda funny but not how funny people are making it out to be. The whole movie is pretty boring and its like watching a live episode of family guy. Does Seth Macfarlane have an original bone in his body? Ted (talking bear), Family Guy (talking dog), Cleveland show (another talking bear) and American Dad (alien). Need I say more? They even do the lame cute scene jokes they do in family guy. There is really no point in the movie other than its about a guy who can't let go of the past.

The movie had all of the Family Guy type humor that I also like and it added its own level of humor pertinent to making the story line interesting if not oddly believable.  Oh, and what need I say about Mila Kunis....worth the dime just to see her even if the volume was off.

Expect immature behavior and adult themes because this comes from the creative mind of Seth McFarlane, creator of Family Guy. It's definitely worth the $3.99 rental fee from Amazon and I would go so far as to buy it on DVD/Blu-ray in a month or so. Mark Wahlberg plays a working-class guy from Boston with commitment issues whose best friend just so happens to be a walking, talking, beer-drinking, womanizing teddy bear that came to life years ago as a result of a late-night wish. The two are inseparable and their BFF relationship causes a riff between John (Wahlberg) and Lori (Kunis), John's girlfriend. Giovanni Ribisi plays an awesome stalker/creepy guy and Joel McHale turns in a great performance as the lecherous boss. Of course, everything works out in the end but only after some poop jokes, partying with Flash Gordon (Sam Jones), and a chase scene through Boston.

I liked this film really explored having a live talking teddy bear in the film.  Many comedy films so unconcerned with their underlying fantastical premises that it's weird to see a movie where the screenwriters obviously had at least a fifteen or twenty minute discussion about it.

Still, I wish it had been a funnier movie but it's still plenty funny and a good movie to watch after work.  Look, you know what you're getting into if you watch this movie you watched the same billion trailers I did back when it came out.  Just rent it or don't.",1355875200,,775,4.415492957746479

4788665,5,B005LAII1C,No reason to review this movie.  If you're reading this you've most likely seen it.  If you haven't then watch it!  Fans of Seth MacFarlane will not be disappointed.  Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis compliment each other well and bring their own hilarity to the table.  Definitely one of my all time favorite comedies.,1355875200,,315,4.7592592592592595
4788666,3,B005LAII1C,I was hoping that it would be hilarious being that Seth McFarland was involved and being a big fan of his other projects like Family Guy. It had a few good laughs and it's a great premise but it ends up being just okay. I think Seth McFarland's strength lies in the cutaway scenes to absurd situations to exaggerate a point like in Family Guy.

I've got my Panasonic TV connected directly to my router, comcast xfinity internet (not as good as it gets... but definitely should be enough to stream HD over a hard connection), and half of the time the movie is streaming choppy and blurry.  If Amazon is going to charge extra for an HD rental... you would think they could provide a slightly better streaming/buffering system to keep a quality stream throughout the entire movie.

Finally, I'm from the Boston area, so I always love to watch films set in our town. Unfortunately, Ted was a sort of triple let down.

First and foremost, the movie is just not very funny. Certainly there are some good laughs in here, but the plot is thin, the jokes are too obvious and lazy, and the production value is lacking.  It seemed more like an overly-long episode of a sitcom than a movie.

I usually try to pay close attention to any film, even comedies, to catch some of the nuance of dialog, set design, etc., but I found myself paying more attention to my laptop while watching this. In fact, my wife and I both fell asleep during this movie.

While he drinks and smokes and somehow has sex throughout the movie, he's apparently incapable of just going dormant like the toys in Toy Story and has to get his own place.  Considering what happens, he is also not *really* alive and becoming organic on the inside like Chucky was, so the drive to the climax of the story feels totally fabricated and fake when Wahlberg's character decides he wants to grow up and chooses his girl (Kunis) over Ted and mayhem ensues.

Wahlberg is entertaining and there are a couple of funny lines, that's it!  Words that come to mind to describe the rest of the movie; boring, dull and witless.

Take a bong smoking, beer drinking Teddy bear who has nothing to do but talk dirty to women and try to get laid and add a lost soul of a 35 year old man who is afraid of thunderstorms and likes to talk about farting and you have Ted.  At best, there is a certain teenage appeal to the movie, but not much.  Perhaps if you grew up in Boston (where the movie is shot) and sat on your Mothers couch all day getting high and drinking beers and did nothing more with your life, this movie is a roaring laugh.

It could have been a lot more fun if Wahlbergs character was 18 trying to score a women with a cute dirty talking party-bear and his childhood hero (the flash) taught him how to be a man and helped him get the babe.  Instead both characters are portrayed as losers which the producers try to make seem funny and cool.  The movie, like its characters,  fails to deliver anything more than a shrug.  And why was that weird evil character inserted?  WTF was that all about?  Another failed attempt to bring humor.

4790217,5,B005LAII1C,"This was one of my favorite films this year.  It is both side-splittingly funny and rather heart-warming as well.  In short, Ted will make you laugh and cry.

The good news here is that this DVD is fully loaded -- it contains the theatrical version of the film, an unrated version with an additional six minutes of ursine misbehavior, a funny gag reel, various making-of featurettes, and a director's commentary.

All the stuff too many movie companies have been reserving only for BluRay, when we KNOW many of these features will fit on a DVD as well!

Special shout-outs must go to Ted himself, a sweet-looking Teddy who comes to life at a little boy's wish and matures into a raunchy, pot-smoking, beer-guzzling, ho-hiring roommate for the boy, now a man, Bostonite John Bennett, played by Mark Wahlberg.  Wahlberg and Mila Kunis must be singled out for special praise as well, as they respond to the outrageous bear as though he is as real as rain.  They sell the effect.

And indeed, as voiced and motion-captured by the director and writer Seth McFarlane, Ted is an entirely credible and show-stealing performer in every shot and scene.

Further kudos go to Giovanni Ribisi as a nutty father who is determined to bearnap Ted for his Puggsley-like son to play with and deliver painful ""ouches"" to.

At any rate, if you want to see a very different kind of bromance movie, you should definitely check out this R-rated bear.  And if you like the movie, you will assuredly want the DVD, both for the extras and the many gut-busting comedic lines you didn't hear among all the mayhem the first or even second times around.

4790219,1,B005LAII1C,"The bulk of the ""humor"" in this movie revolves around drug use and adolescent sex jokes (and aberrant sexual behavior--in one scene Ted is caught with multiple hookers visiting, one of whom poops on the living room floor--yes, that was supposed to be funny).  It's unfortunate because the movie has an original and potentially charming concept.  (Think ""Big"" with Tom Hanks).  Unfortunately the director takes us to repeated dope smoking, hookers hanging out with Ted, Wahlberg as another mid-30s ""failure to launch"" male loser, etc.  Ain't it cool to hang out with your buddy and smoke dope and then show up late for your dead-end job where it takes very little aside from punctuality to be successful.  I'm also disappointed in the star.  Wahlberg showed potential earlier in his career but is now becoming another Steve Gutenberg.  Only his movies aren't as funny.

The movie is full of bad language and repetitive toilet humor.  Great concept very poorly executed.  Don't waste your time and DON'T let your kids watch it.",1355616000,6,1025,4.976470588235294

4790224,2,B005LAII1C,"I really wanted this movie to be good and funny! I really wanted to watch this movie in a family setting. Cannot do that. I think Mark Wahlberg is a great actor and the whole story could have been really good and funny. I think ""Invincible"" is one of his best movies. The trailer of the movie is an example of a really good commercial for a mediocre film with too many bad and adult jokes.

The story is simple. A boy wishes that his bear could come to life during Christmas, and guess what...it happens! And the boy grows older always living with his teddy bear. The plot is dormant all the way to last 20 minutes. I think that they made the script as they were filming the movie (like the SNL sketches) and realized that they were short and had to add more stuff. It looks like they rushed the end.

It is a decent plot with huge potential and good acting. If you like juvenile jokes (like in the American Pie movie) then you will like the movie. However, it is NOT a PG 13 movie (as stated on the cover), and because of the language and the cruel jokes it is rated R. Cannot watch this movie with your kids. I highly doubt that a father can watch the movie with his daughter(s) and wife when in the opening scene the father complements his wife (using the bj word) of the gift she gave him last night (on the eve of Christmas) in front of their son on Christmas day while talking about presents. Really bad and inapropriate humor, for a so called family movie.  In addition, some ""jokes"" are really not funny and really offensive for a parent. I know that people in Hollywood are numb to some things that we parents are sensitive because of their lifestyle, but I was expecting much better from Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis who made some good clean family movies thus far (except Boogie Nights but the whole subject of the movie is porn so...). Totally embarrassing and bad jokes galore, especially in the opening scene. The Hollywood people may have to wake up and make cleaner family movies if they want to make money with the people. Otherwise they should expect to make little income since the movie will be watched in few cities on the East and West coast only.

I will do my best to alert people about the content of these so called ""funny"" movies that the liberal pseudoelite in Hollywood tries to perpetrate and make it normal. Even if Amazon buries my review deep inside the 200 something other reviews, people will be able to find it.

absolute amazement that someone had bothered to make
a film that was so puerile, so vulgar, so immature,
so vacuous, so unfunny, so tedious, so revolting, so
vainglorious in its homage to 'adult' humour, so

In the first 10 minutes of this movie, I was certain I was going to be in for a hilarious ride. I was already laughing hard. Then the movie progressed, and I anxiously awaited for it to get funny again, but it stalled. What happens far too often with these kinds of movies is they try so hard to stay to a plot, and unfortunately for this movie, it was a love story. Also, the pot and beer references are only so funny. Again, I'm not offended, but I'm not going to continue to laugh because a teddy bear shouldn't be a pot head. What irony!

4790913,3,B005LAII1C,"By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, Mississippi

I've liked almost every movie Mark Wahlberg has been in. He was great in The Departed (2006), The Fighter (2010), Shooter (2007) and Contraband (2012). I even liked him in what he calls his favorite role Max Payne (2008).
I've had a distant admiration for him since he battled back against a rough start. By the age of 13 he was addicted to cocaine and got in trouble with the Boston Police Department some 25 times.
""Everything I did wrong was my own fault. I was taught the difference between right and wrong at an early age. I take full responsibility,"" he said. Even though he likes to forget it, I even dug  Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch.  ""Good Vibrations"" went to #1 in 1991.
So when I heard Mark decided to make Ted I was in. He said he didn't want his kids thinking he was a ""bad dude"" or ""scary person"" because of the roles he usually plays. But Mark I'd take violence over a filthy mouthed Teddy bear any day.
This could have been, should have been a truly wonderful family film. A small reclusive boy wishes one night his Teddy bear could really talk. The next morning the bear talks, walks and shares his opinions. They even go to a cool spot that ""talking critters"" usually don't go. Everyone can hear him not just the boy. He ends up on Johnny Carson but in the long run everyone gets used to the idea that the stuffed animal talks.
But instead of being family friendly, the bear smokes dope, chases woman and has a filther mouth than a sailor.",1355356800,,1526,4.404255319148936

4790916,5,B005LAII1C,"The movie Ted is a historical comedy that will become a instant classic amongst many people, the movie gives a sense of true friend bonded friendship and holding on to the love of your life but with joys and laughters. Ted is not one of those movies that the doll, toy, or stuffed animal that has poor visual effects and don't do much, the creators of Ted made him out to be people just like us. Ted fights, talk junk, has sex, drinks, party, and smokes greenery. This movie is for those whom have ups and downs with hard days of work, relationship problems ( by defining what's important!), and special holidays/ anniversities/ family reunious. The shipement from amazon sent the movie to me a day early before it was released in markets, superstores, and etc.  Even children will love this movie but must be warned! Parental descerition advised ( so please cover their eyes on certain parts and let be known that is a bad habbit, don't let them become pot heads.) A movie worth having as part of your collection of movies hands down classic comedy!",1355356800,,1050,4.585106382978723
4790917,5,B005LAII1C,"Ted follows John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) as he tried to balance his relationship with his girlfriend, Lori (Mila Kunis), and his magical teddy bear, Ted (Seth MacFarlane). What we get is a raunchy laugh-out-loud comedy with a pinch of innocence.

First, when I use the word ""innocence"", I mean it has heart in its story; its a story about a man that struggles to grow-up after experiencing true friendship. I also mean: the comedy in this film is very balanced, as in, most jokes are dirty and raunchy while others are, for lack of a better word, innocent. The intro immediately comes to mind when Ted is first introduced as a character and John's father screams for his gun and the police, and Ted softly replies ""Is it a hugging gun?"". Aside from the major jokes shown in the trailers, some of these small lines really made me laugh or smirk. Don't get me wrong though, this is still an adult comedy. Also, it's packed with references from Flash Gordon, to the ringtones, and overall soundtrack; I loved this because it does it right. The acting was great, as well; Mark Whalberg, Mila Kunis, and Seth MacFarlane have great chemistry. Also, there are plenty of familiar faces and voices if you're a fan of Family Guy or American Dad. I knocked one point off because it was a bit predictable story-wise, and a little on the long side, but they weren't really significant problems.

Overall, I really enjoyed Ted, it was consistently funny with balanced jokes, so it didn't rely heavily on one type. Don't expect some type of mature or ""sophisticated"" comedy and you should be fine. I highly recommend a purchase or rental.

Ted has some violence, strong language, drug use, and some nudity (one brief scene) (Unrated version)",1355356800,,1726,4.7275747508305646

4791219,5,B005LAII1C,"I love Ted. I saw it several times in theaters and just had to have it when it came out. Seth MacFarlane is a multi-talented comic genius. His work with Ted, the voice acting, the work in the motion capture suit and his attention to detail in the animations made for a character that seemed completely real,some much so that you really think of Ted less as a bear, and more as a person.
I am also a huge fan of Family Guy and Seth's other voice over and writing work so it came to no surprise that I'd love this movie. You need a sense of humor for this movie. If you are easily offended and don't like adult humor, you're missing out, but I suggest you not watch this movie.
Most the negative reviews that I've seen are from people that don't like adult humor and are easily offended, or are parents that were dumb enough to take their children to this movie, or were the cynical guys that love to bash family guy and Seth because they can't really enjoy anything, love to complain and think their opinions matter. These people should be ignored because it is hard to enjoy a good movie if you are a prude, dumb enough to show this movie to your kids or are a cynical troll.

4791338,4,B005LAII1C,"His name is Ted.  He's a teddy bear brought to life by the wish of a lonely child.  But as all children do, the pair grew up.  The world accustomed itself to a talking stuffed animal, so much so that Ted is now a stoner who hangs around with his thunder buddy John.  John is in a relationship with the stunning Lori.  But after four years, Lori gets fed up, and forces John to make a choice: her or the bear.

It could've been a one-joke pony; and, with Seth MacFarlane at the helm, that was a definite possibility.  MacFarlane's work is hit-and-miss; for every gut-busting episode of FAMILY GUY or AMERICAN DAD, there's one that simply flops.  However, MacFarlane has managed to bring the zaniness of his TV work to the big screen, creating the best so-stupid-it's-kinda-smart movie since the first HANGOVER.  The jokes come quick and often, with the randomness that made FAMILY GUY such a hit (this is basically an extended episode, which is both as good and troublesome as you may expect).

The cast features several FAMILY GUY alum, as well as some stellar celeb cameos.  Giovani Ribisi disappears into his role as a creep with a Ted fetish; Joel McHale excels as Lori's horny boss; and Patrick Stewart provides some excellent (and hilarious) narration.  But the heart and soul here is the trio: Mark Wahlberg, proving finally that he has the comedic chops he's been trying to convince us he has; Mila Kunis, matching him step for step; and the true star, director/writer/producer Seth MacFarlane, who voices Ted to perfection.  The bear truly comes alive; kudos to the CG team for making such a realistic animated star.  However, without MacFarlane's vocal screen presence, the film could have fallen flat.  Instead, we've got a raunchy laugh-fest.  Granted, it's not for everyone: if teddy bears making love on produce isn't your thing, you may want to look elsewhere.  But for FAMILY GUY fans, or for people who enjoy comedy that's not quite so high-brow, TED is a must-see.",1355270400,,1981,4.762463343108505

4791410,1,B005LAII1C,"Ted(released June/12)stars Mark Wahlberg as John Bennett,with Seth McFarlane(Family Guy) doing the voice of stuffed bear Ted. On the surface this idea of a stuffed bear coming to life,would suggest a myriad of comic possibilities. Written,produced and executed with a deft and smart touch,this movie could have been a completely different and far BETTER film. Instead we are given a film populated with the kind of gutter crap that passes for humour these days and it constantly offends ones sensibilities throughout. This film is not a film for anyone under 18 years old but I personally know a father who has shown this to his young teenage boys,and I'm sure there are plenty more out there who think:""guy,talking teddy bear,oh how cute,let's all sit down and watch this"".Believe me,keep this movie as far away from your children as possible. The stuffed bear utters language I would never use,has sex with various women,smokes up constantly and does other disgusting actions I just cannot say in this review.
The story starts with an eight year old John Bennett. He's a loner who wishes he had a companion. Voila,Ted comes to life and the two remain inseparable from that point on. John only keeps the secret so long and eventually Ted is introduced to various people and word spreads like wildfire. Ted becomes a celebrity. Fast forward and John is now 35 and he and his bear still co-habitate together. John has a girlfriend but their relationship is rocky at best,all centering around John's relationship with Ted.
In order to please his girlfriend he forces Ted out into his own place. Ted,trying NOT to,has gotten a job in a supermarket. This helps John and his girlfriends relationship for a time,but comes a party his girlfriend's boss throws. Ted phones John up saying their on-screen hero actor from the /80s Flash Gordon movie,Sam Jones,is actually there in his apartment. John reluctantly races over just to spend 30 minutes,but 30m turns into over two hours. His girlfriend hits the roof and finally leaves him.
At this time a slowly developing side plot enters the picture. A dysfunctional man and his son appear and kidnap Ted. Of course Ted puts out the SOS and John and his girlfriend come racing to the rescue. Ted is ripped apart in the struggle and loses his stuffing which eventually kills him. They race him home,put him together but nothing brings Ted back. Next morning Ted awakens to a startled John. It seems John's girlfriend wished her life back,which brought Ted back. The film ends as John gets married.
In cameo's,Ryan Reynolds appears as a gay lover,Norah Jones appears as someone Ted made love to some years back,and Tom Skerritt appears because one of the characters has kidnapped his daughter. Really twisted plot reasons to get good talent to make an appearance in ones movie.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp. There are two versions here,a theatrical and an extended unrated version. The unrated is even raunchier than the theatrical version. Both are restricted anyways. Extras include a gag reel,a featurette and commentary.
All in all a totally disgusting film. This movie,put in the hands of someone who is smart and imaginative,could have made it so very much better than what we have here. Instead we have to settle for what passes for comedy these days,and get almost two hours worth of unfunny and mind numbing college frat humour. If you like continual four letter humour,then this buds for you. Mr. McFarlane, please stick to Family Guy,and leave real movie making to the professionals.",1355270400,5,3583,4.933774834437086

The R version is great, and I am not offended by ""Bad Language"", However, the Unrated version doesn't add much to the movie, but for the most part alternative takes that add language, and at the point, the language does become overkill.

The humor at time can get a bit overdone, with the bear just because he is crude, but there are more scenes that are just plain funny!  Mark Whalberg is as always, stead, confident & blends into his role so believably that you'd think he's been living it for real.  What I do love?  Whomever did Ted's voice is perfect for it.

Here is the story: little kid gets a teddy bear he names Ted, and wishes it would come to life. Boom! It comes to life. Kid and bear grow up together without ever really growing up. Plenty of traditional American profanity, toilet humor, drug references and abuse, told against a backdrop of existential-neoclassical philosophy. I just made that last thing up. Don't even know what it means.

Instead on the delivery day I got an email from Amazon saying the purchase price was wrong. (Checking the site its really $16.99) My order was cancelled and I have to reorder if I still want the item.

4791915,2,B005LAII1C,"I saw Ted as a cheap movie at my college, and long story short, I didn't like it. The story was very predictable and felt clich&eacute;, your average ""guy must choose between his lazy fun loving best friend and girlfriend who wants him to do something with his life."" The jokes were nothing but Seth doing what he can't do on TV, mainly dropping the F-bomb. And I really felt like it was just a waste of time. The acting was really good though. You really did feel like the actors were actually talking and interacting with Ted.

Now before I get comments such as ""it's Seth MacFarlane and an R-rated comedy, what did you expect?"" Truth be told, I didn't know what to expect. Yes I saw the uncensored trailer and know what Family Guy is like, but one also must consider that Seth made the awesomeness that is Johnny Bravo, with the help of Butch Hartman, the entertaining series that is American Dad, and the ok Cleveland Show. I went in knowing it could be great, or bad. What I wasn't expecting was that the ONLY ""jokes"" would be ""I'm a living teddy bear, I curse, drink, like hookers, and it's funny because I'm a child's toy."" Really that's it. One trick pony where the trick gets old really fast. I'm sure Seth could have done something else, maybe develop the stalker character some more and draw humor form the fact that he's stalking a teddy bear, but nope, just the contrast of a teddy bear cursing and getting drunk. Also he's made episodes for his shows that have had some really interesting stories. The episode where Johnny meats Adam West and they go on a ridiculous adventure to rescue Mama, good story with excellent execution that led to very funny situations. During Ted however, I sat there, thinking ""this will happen next...aaand I was right, now he's gonna, yep he just did. Yep, he said f*** again.""

Here's a way to tell if you'll enjoy it or not, watch the uncensored trailer on YouTube, and ask yourself ""will I enjoy 90 minutes of just this?"" If you like what you see, you'll enjoy it. I for one, didn't enjoy it.",1354924800,7,2040,4.466487935656836

If you currently enjoy watching Family Guy, American Dad, The Cleveland Show, or any other production by Seth Macfarlane, you will not be disappointed. Please be aware that this movie is NOT for kids. For parents out there looking for a 'clean' movie, steer clear of this and stick with Pixar. The last thing a kid needs to memorize is the Thunderbuddies Song. Nonetheless, the word play in the movie just makes you laugh at every point along the story. When watching this film in the theater, I was careful when drinking my Sprite in fear of coughing it up on the people in front of me. So don't forget your napkins.

I also do not condone the negative reviews for this movie. While it might not have the definitive story that even the basic comedy movies contain, Ted isn't so much about story. The goal of Seth Macfarlane was to make us laugh at every turn of the picture without recourse. For me, he accomplished this goal. I admit the crude humour is not for everybody, but do not let that detract that this is a terrible movie in the slightest respect. So please, watch or rent before you buy and make your final decision. Just remember we all have a pot-smoking, drunk cuddly teddy bear somewhere in us.

I think that his style of comedy is funny but hey. Different strokes for different folks. I felt this movie was a winner. I picture Stewie Griffin growing up into Mark Wahlbergs character and Rupert like Ted. That's basically how I think it was really. But anywho I digress.

On another side, the story and the so-so comic emotional moments work to function like a proper comedy not like a corny episode of Family Guy. Now, the modern-day jokes about Jack & Jill and Taylor Lautner and the sort of rushed ending doesn't work for a film that looks like it can stand the test of time. If you like Toy Story, which is obviously a classic, mixed with South Park: Bigger, Longer, & Uncut, and Howard the Duck, you'll love Ted.""

With the exception of a few hiccups at the start of the film, it is a laugh-out-loud movie from start to finish, a rare
case nowadays for American comedy films.
Credits must be given to Seth MacFarland for making a very funny movie based on an old premise:  A lonely child grew
attached to his toy teddy, in this case it became his life long companion.
The always good Mark Wahlberg was engagingly supported by Mila Kunis and a team of able supporting actors.
The film was filmed in a darker pallet than most romantic comedies from the US, but with a soundtrack music from the
50's which gave the film an extra dose of style and personality.
At the end, it is the ted of Seth MacFarland.

The middle and end of the film was ok but not very memorable with only a couple laughs that come to mind. We were both rather disappointed with the film overall because the previews and the possibilities of comedy with the story line is endless and they seemed to just produce a mediocre comedy.

As an English major, I'm prone to see the deeper meanings behind any piece of literature, any piece of text. The nostalgia within this film becomes painfully evident in the final moments of the film, first as John battles with his childhood insecurities (Ted) and ultimately gains the confidence to face his adulthood with Julie, and secondly, as Julie (the girl of his dreams) manages to repair John's childhood by making a wish that she had her life back, complete with John and John's intact/pain-free childhood (his stuffed friend). All is well in the end, as is to be expected for a man who is blessed with the true and honest love of a sincere woman. Take it from a man who's also wished for an absolute friend throughout the years of his life; any disability, physical, mental or perceived can make you feel awkward; we all need a Ted, we all need a Julie.

Not an incredibly, uproariously funny film, but the humor of McFarlane and the surrealism is there, and it's an enjoyable flick which I will be buying in support of the man who gave us Family Guy. After all, Ted does sound A LITTLE like Peter Griffin....hehehehe...and Mila Kunis is an absolute knockout of a sweetheart. I think she's probably as pretty on the inside as she is on the outside. Too bad Meg Griffin isn't nearly so beautiful :P

For more magic-realism (where magic is taken as an occurrence within everyday life) or surrealism (where the narrator's mind is the one true reality, for the sake of the story), check out Lewis Carroll's ALICE IN WONDERLAND or Julio Cortazar's LETTERS TO A YOUNG LADY IN PARIS; both stories really gave me the insight to appreciate this film's deeper intentions.",1351296000,2,1783,4.711538461538462

  John Benett was a lonely little boy with no friends living in Brockton, Massachusetts in 1985. Then, on Christmas morning, he received a plush teddy bear he called Ted. One night, lying in bed, John wished Ted would come to life. That wish came true thanks to a star falling from the sky while John was making it. Ted came to life shocking John, his parents, and the world at large. But by 2012, no one cares. John (now played by Mark Wahlberg) is working at a car rental agency and has been dating Lori (played by Mila Kunis) for 4 years. Ted (now voiced by Seth MacFarlane) shares an apartment with Lori and John but makes no contribution to the household expenses, entertains prostitutes in the living room, and rushes into bed with John and Lori during thunderstorms as they still terrify both him and John. Eventually, Lori can't take anymore and tells John that Ted must find a job and a place of his own.

  Now, I am not a fan of Family Guy and I've never watched any of MacFarlane's other, less popular series. The most popular shows on Fox all seem to follow the same formula. One or two smart characters surrounded by idiots. In Family Guy, the smart characters would be Brian and Stewie. In The Simpsons, the only smart character I can think of is Lisa. That aside, Ted is a hilarious film. Not particularly intelligent, mind you, but what were you expecting from a movie about a teddy bear brought to life by a wish on a falling star? Shakespeare?

After watching Ted, I was actually happy to have taken the time to see it, and that doesn't happen often in this age of re-makes and sequels.
Being 49 years old, it's tough to come across a new, funny comedy. This is definitely one.
Admittedly, there are one, or two, scenes that even made me cringe.

4792485,4,B005LAII1C,"When John was a little boy he had no friends, so one Christmas night he wished so hard that his teddy bear was alive, that his wish was granted. 25 years later Ted is a freeloading, pot-smoking wastrel with a penchant for hookers and booze who is becoming an increasingly awkward third wheel in John's relationship with his girlfriend Lori (the wondrous Mila Kunis).

In the very best sense Ted is a hugely silly movie, and a very, very funny one. Mark Wahlberg is dependably good as the adult John, who still doesn't really want to grow up. He acts as a straight man to the Seth McFarlane voiced Ted, who is rude, profane, and perhaps a bit racist. Mila Kunis, one of the finest comediennes at work today, is excellent in the more difficult role of Lori: the adult of the trio always at risk, with a less well judged performance, of being the killjoy in the movie.

The humour in the movie is very much in keeping with McFarlane's TV show Family Guy, so it might not be to everyone's taste - there is an edge of cruelty to some of it which some may find offensive, particularly if they are fans of Sinead O'Connor, Susan Boyle or Taylor Lautner.

Still the movie boasts possibly the funniest fight scene since John Wayne and Victor McLaughlin went at it in The Quiet Man: its worth watching for that alone... and, of course, the luminous Mila Kunis.",1346112000,3,1350,4.4574898785425106

4792622,4,B005LAII1C,"Ted is the cinematic debut of Seth MacFarlane, a polarizing figure if ever there was one. Obviously he's the creator of the highly successful Family Guy and American Dad, but he's often criticized for being unoriginal and derivative. Ted comes pre-packaged with a particular demographic, all of whom seemed to attend the screening I saw. I don't mean to stereotype, but I'm not sure anyone in that theater was not texting. Regardless, those who criticize MacFarlane have to give him credit for Ted. His first film is a big budget comedy about a man's relationship with a talking teddy bear. It's an interesting premise at face value. What's surprising is that Ted is essentially a formulaic romantic comedy that happens to have a talking, pothead teddy bear in it. This is a criticism, but Ted has received positive reviews and that's for a reason; when it's funny, it's very funny.

It's 1985 in Massachusetts and young John Bennett is the most un-popular kid in the neighborhood. For Christmas, he's given a teddy bear and it becomes his best friend. One night he wishes for the teddy bear to come to life and it does. With one newscaster proclaiming ""look what Jesus did! Look what Jesus did!"" Ted becomes an overnight celebrity, even appearing on Johnny Carson. But, ""like Corey Feldman, Frankie Muniz, and Justin Bieber"" the narrator (Patrick Stewart) informs us, ""people eventually stop giving a s***."" Cut to present day, John (Mark Wahlberg) and Ted (voiced and motion-captured by MacFarlane) live together, spending a good amount of time smoking pot and watching the movie Flash Gordon. John is in a committed relationship with Lori (Mila Kunis), whose patience with John and Ted's friendship is wearing thin. She finally convinces John to make Ted move out when they come home to find Ted in the company of four prostitutes; one of whom has left something on the floor.

Yes, toilet humor abounds in Ted but this should come as no surprise if you're at all familiar with MacFarlane's work. The film is written by MacFarlane, Alec Sulkin, and Wellesley Wild, all of whom have written for Family Guy. All three have upped the ante on the humor, knowing that this would be a theatrical film and the jokes need to be funnier and more memorable; however, don't expect the humor to differ much from that formula. If MacFarlane's TV work has worn out its welcome for you, don't assume you'll dislike Ted. Just be aware that the humor shares the same DNA and has its share of cut-aways and random, anti-PC dialogue.

Ted, while imperfect and with its fair share of jokes that fail to gel, is consistently funny and may be the funniest film I've seen this year. It scores big laughs immediately and the humor never runs out of steam. The humor often comes from pop culture references, cameos, and offensive insults, but there is some comedic gold here and few minutes pass without another big laugh. It's vulgar and provocative, but the really good jokes will make you short of breath.

It's easy to forget or overlook, but this film relies heavily on visual effects. Ted is in nearly every scene and the motion-capture here is wonderful. If Ted ages poorly it will not result from the visual effects, which really give off the impression that a stuffed teddy bear has come to life. Why is Seth MacFarlane, a first time director whose previous successes have solely been animated television shows, able to make a film with better special effects than a guaranteed blockbuster like Twilight? And not only does Ted look great, but he's a fully developed character that MacFarlane brings to life both physically and vocally. The film acknowledges that Ted's voice isn't a far cry from Peter Griffin's voice, but he's a fully-realized, unique character.

The performances are fine. Wahlberg has proven to be a gifted comedic actor and he's effective here, however the film seems unaware of something pivotal. The friendship angle of John and Ted is much more fascinating than the romantic angle of John and Lori. The film is consistently funny, but the storytelling lacks this same consistency. Aside from the presence of a talking teddy bear, there's little to separate this from any other romantic comedy. Even the music cues are the same (although, with MacFarlane as director, this film's a little heavier on the use of showtunes). Even worse is the unnecessary subplot involving Donny (Giovanni Ribisi), who wants to kidnap Ted for his son. Donny's presence contributes some hilarious moments to the film but the actual kidnapping subplot fails to gain momentum. Had the film shifted its focus to the relationship between Ted and John and been more of a buddy movie, I think it could've been funnier and more engaging.

Ted is much better than it has any right to be, but will probably be just as polarizing as its creator for anyone outside of the built-in fanbase. MacFarlane fails to deliver on all the potential this film could've had to offer, but his debut film is uproariously funny at times and boasts a memorable, unique protagonist. Ted is imperfect, but it's a solid debut for MacFarlane that shows a seamless transition from TV to film, animation to live action.

The narrative revolves around the relationship John Bennett (Wahlberg) and his boyhood soft toy Ted (MacFarlane) have maintained into adulthood. A wish by Bennett as a child gave Ted the capacity to actively function like a person.

Despite their adult ages Ted and Bennett are still very boyish and are like a couple of teenagers when it comes to their approach to life.

They are transfixed by the 1980s and what seemed amazing in childhood is still much the same.

No one is safe when it comes to humour in this movie as it is unreservedly directed at mainstream and minority groups.

The style of hilarity is often quite crude, and viewers who are inclined towards coarse comedy will feel right at home with this film, smiling from beginning to end.

4792625,5,B005LAII1C,"Reviewers saying this movie is the worst movie they have ever seen must be very miserable people and don't know how to enjoy a good comedy movie. This movie was exactly what I expected from the creator of family guy: Witty jokes, stupidly funny sense of humor, joke references from tv and movies, and random racist remarks that somehow are not offenses. I thought the cast was brillant and it even had a soft side to it. I made my husband see this because we both love family guy; he so did not want to see it, he fought about it for 2 hours...well we see it and he was cracking up the entire them. He did not wipe the smile off his face through the entire moive. I will for sure be adding this to my movie collection, anyone who loves family guy will instantly love this movie! It is exactly the same sense of humor that got everyone addicted to family guy, seth did it again, well done sir!",1343088000,65,892,4.222222222222222
4792626,2,B005LAII1C,"Some Reviews Listed Ted as one of the funniest movies that's ever been produced in a long time. How true that statement is? It all comes down to your sense of humor I guess. Humor is subjective much like everything else but it does have some universal rules that gives it an objective view. So, if the masses thought that a specific film is funny then it should be. Unfortunately that wasn't the case with Ted or at least from my experience.

I won't come here and say somethings like: ""this is the most terrible movie that I've ever seen, Just stay away from it. Oh My, the amount of racist, sexual inappropriate jokes is a turn off and everyone be as far as possible from this indecent and corrupted piece of disgusting photography that has a general outline also called as a movie for moral's sake and good old PG films""

Actually the sense of humor unlike many others who didn't enjoy this film is probably not the main reason I didn't like it. I'm used to Family Guy I won't say it's the best show on earth because I personally don't find it hilarious but it's watchable and sometimes though rarely funny. The so called Shocking content wasn't also why I give this film a 2 star I'm not a Prude by any means! Actually the more shocking and inappropriate the better. The Cast was good, the premise has been done before but not in a R rated form so that was kinda new. So What went wrong? I don't know I just think this movie is somehow lacking.

I personally was hoping to laugh like there's no tomorrow, however that didn't happen some jokes were funny but the majority of the film wasn't which is somehow skipping the point of this story, I mean it is supposed to entertain and humor you through out right? versus a couple of scenes.

It was really hard to feel sorry or sympathetic for Ted *the main character* because he wasn't likable at all. Not mainly because he smoke pot and bullsh*t a lot. But because he just wasn't. He was obnoxious, unbearable and totally without an agenda for the future, he was just like a Paris Hilton bear version those people who do nothing all day, and just party all long and then do it all again, while the rest of the population is working their heads off for financial security. How can anyone like these people seriously?

I think the character of Ted is quite two dimensional which is bad, because it had the opportunity to be much more. It could've at least had some redeeming qualities like a bear wisdom for example? So, yeah wasted potential.

All in all, this movie tries so hard to be different from your average Rom/Com, mainly because it's R rated and it's about a teddy bear who can not only speak but smoke pot, drink bud lights, party, mess around, have random sex and date hookers. But that's about as different as it's going to get from a Rom/Com. A more intelligent sense of humor and witty dialogue would've really helped this movie stand out but the writing was totally ignored I guess. Because who wouldn't wanna watch an R rated movie of a Bear named Ted? It's like the producers said Oh, the premise alone should attracted audiences and makes it a good movie so why bother with anything else.

I can only imagine Ted appealing to a more younger audience, an audience of 13-16 year olds and occasionally men. Because the sense of humor is don't ask why funny for that age category for some reason. Mainly because those kids believe that the likes of Family Guy will make them look cool, Hey I'm watching a potty filled humor tv show that my parents will kill me if they ever find out. I know everything about sex references and racist jokes now and they think am all innocent and sweet how special am I! I can visualize two 14 years old stealing this movie after it came out on dvd and their parents were watching it with a couple of adult friends while on weekend get together spent drinking beer, and just laughing their heads off at every single boring joke this film has to offer.

I've outgrown this sense of humor, really it's no longer funny or shocking. It takes a lot for anything to be shocking and disturbing nowadays.

You're the judge watch it and see, but wait till it comes out on Netflix or you can rent it on your tv for a lesser price.",1343088000,6,4217,4.410025706940874

Its one of those movies that hits every few minute sand when it does don't hesitate to laugh till u cant anymore. Its that damm good.  Ill just say its a must own if your a fan of either offensive comedy or family guy,american dad,the cleaveland show or seth mcfarlane as a comic.

4792628,4,B005LAII1C,"This movie was great. I love these comedies and I do get the humor it has.

You got to really get the kind of cruel and stupid humor to really enjoy the movie, if you don't than you will hate it from start to finish. The humor they use mainly involves drugs, sex, or alcohol use. If you like family guy, it's like that but much more! If you don't like that stuff, please don't watch it as you would be wasting your time.

I also loved Mark Wahlberg performance, he did a great job working with a pretend bear on screen. He really pulled it off with his acting skills. Mila Kunis was good, but she didn't really do much as all she was there was for mostly eye candy for the audience.

The story itself is very simple and that's good as they didn't need to make it complex in any way. They just wanted to make a great comedy out of this.

4792670,3,B005LAII1C,"Probably everyone remembers their first R rated movie (Smokey and the Bandit for me). This movie would be a perfect first R rated movie for an adolescent boy to sneak into. Filled with potty humor, farts, poops, spankings, and gratuitous swearing. Shows some body parts and alludes to sexual activity without actually showing it.

This movie has its clever moments. After the teddy bear magically comes to life, everyone can see him. And yet after the initial fanfare, everyone loses interest, except for the occasional person on the street who wants to take a cell phone picture with him, so the bear has to get a real job haha. The movie also had good CGI and some neat effects, like when Ted appeared as a guest on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson :-)

The storyline is very predictable. It's pure male fantasy that a beautiful and successful, career-oriented, much younger woman would fall for an unreliable, pot-smoking, car rental clerk whose interests range from sitting on the couch, to watching TV, to drinking beer, and who loves spending time with his bear-buddy more than his woman.

The movie would have been much better with a more talented, comedian as a main character, e.g., Seth Rogen has enough appeal, acting ability, and personality to pull it off and with some well placed ad-libbing could have made this a very good if not great movie. Mark Wahlberg is too low-key and vanilla for this role, and definitely is not looking 35.

John Bennett (Wahlberg) is a lonely eight year old kid without many friends. For Christmas he gets a teddy bear and wishes he was real. When he wakes up the bear is talking and he finally has a best friend. 20 years later John has been dating Lori (Kunis) for almost four years and things are starting to get serious. The only thing keeping John from taking the next step is his friend Ted. I am a huge ""Family Guy"" fan and next to ""The Dark Knight Rises"" this is the summer movie I was looking forward to the most. I had very high expectations going in and was not disappointed in the least. I think it was actually funnier then I expected. Like most of MacFarlane's humor this movie is so over the top with off the wall references (a whole plot point is devoted to the Flash Gordon TV show from the 70's) and extremely un-pc jokes that you can't help but laugh at. I could go on and on about how funny this movie is but this is something you just have to see for yourself. I highly recommend this and this is the funniest comedy I have seen since ""Anchorman"" one that I will buy and watch over and over and over.

It tries to shock you, but in the end it follows the most basic and ridiculous Hollywood formula.

4792678,3,B005LAII1C,"What do you do if you are a successful TV show writer who wants to make a Movie but doesn't have the brass to do what the Simpsons folks did and do It blatantly?  Simple make your main character a Teddy Bear, turn his kids into his slacker friend and his wife into his friend's long suffering girlfriend and Presto, you have Ted.

Mark Wahlberg is John Bennett whose teddy bear Peter (sorry Ted) comes to life after a Christmas Wish that is almost as powerful as an Apache Helicopter.  Unfortunately for John his parents apparently had no idea how to raise either him or the teddy bear and both become pot smoking slacker losers in Boston.

At first glance the idea that John has a smoking hot successful girlfriend, Mika Kunis makes no sense until you realize that every single other male Character in the movie and frankly almost all the female ones are even more dysfunctional or downright sick compared to him.  In the population of this movie Mark Wahlberg's character IS the pick of the litter.

It's pretty much a standard slacker movie, boy promises to do better, girl gives him second chance, boy screws up royally, girl leave him and is perused by evil rich guy, Boy does romantic thing to win girl back and after an action scene on Fenway's Green Monster ends in tragedy boy gets girl.

Every thing else is filler, Peter oops Ted is simply a foul mouthed idiot whose antics would not rate laugh without the fur.  Family guy style jokes abound from the flashbacks to the pop culture references.

The movie does have moments.  I laughed out loud at Sam Jones scenes, the funniest of the picture, camp in its purest form.  Norah Jones is amusing in a small role and Patrick Stewart makes you laugh as the narrator.

Wahlberg and Kunis don't do BAD with the material they have, I actually think they do the best they could with it, its just the material is nothing special.  As for Peter oops Ted, it depends on what you came in expecting.  Those expecting to be outraged won't be because they've seen it all before on the Tube and those expecting to be laughing will if they think about it wonder why they paid money for a live action Family guy movie.

However I suspect the slacker, video game, I'm cool because I watch John Stewart, audiences will love it never realizing that the joke is on them.

As a child John (Mark Wahlberg) wishes for and gets a talking teddy bear. Now that they are in their 30's neither one has grown out of their immaturity with Ted becoming an increasing problem.

John's girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis) demands that either Ted leaves or she goes. The humor is what one would expect from watching ""Family Guy"" with a lot of adult language. It spoofs other films and is critical of many aspects of society. It is politically incorrect. Like ""Family Guy"" some of the bits work and some don't.

Well, to me, it's lame, and not funny when a movie relies a bong to carry it through.  Who cares if everyone is a pot head or crack addict.  After awhile it is lame, very lame.

4792766,4,B005LAII1C,"Several years ago the creators of South Park were highly critical of the series ""Family Guy"" and its style of humor. Nevertheless, Family Guy has matured into a reliable vehicle for cutting edge humor while South Park, in my opinion, became stale - evolving gradually into a formulaic package showcasing its creators' seemingly narrow political ideologies and more recently often adopting extreme gross out humor supported by little, arguably, in the way of comedic substance.

""Ted"" showcases the talents of Family Guy's creator Seth MacFarlane on the big screen. The humorous results are often downright hilarious, witty, incisive and novel. There are a few instances of standard bathroom style humor, though they are amped up in ways that gives them new life. However, for me some of the very best parts of this film, much like the Family Guy series, are the rich, reoccurring and exploited pop culture references. If you do not want some key surprises in this film ruined, I strongly advise not reading too many reviews of it before you see it. If you grew up in the 1980s this film will be much funnier if you go in blind to its content. At the same time, the script incorporates humor for young adults as well. There were a couple key references to current icons that I did not get, but that the younger members of the audience absolutely roared at. There is truly something for everyone (except small children, who should definitely not see it). I do somewhat agree with the notion that the film loses a bit of comedic steam when it turns serious, but I also understand why the writers chose to do it. Ultimately the storyline ends up being quite a bit more than just a slapstick or screwball comedy, so a bit of drama (and seriousness) helped increase the total impact of the film.

Finally - Mark Wahlberg. . .he is just impressive throughout this film. He's an incredibly versatile actor and in ""Ted"" he demonstrates once again that he can also be very, very funny.

Check out ""Ted."" It is one of the funniest films to hit the big screen in a long time - far better, in my opinion, than the popular ""Hangover"" films - and a great expos&eacute; of the hilarious happenings inside the mind of Seth MacFarlane.",1341446400,,2217,4.694087403598972
4792767,4,B005LAII1C,"Seth MacFarlane who became famous for his animated Fox television show ""Family Guy"" is making his film debut with ""Ted"", a movie about a boy and his teddy bear. How sweet. If you know anything about Seth MacFarlane and ""Family Guy"" you know that there is nothing `sweet' about ""Ted"", although you may be surprised.

Mark Wahlberg plays John Bennett, a Boston kid with no friends. Even the Jewish kid who's getting pummeled by a mob of neighbor kids doesn't want to make friends with him. So when he receives a teddy bear for Christmas (a talking teddy bear with a sweet little, ""I Love You"" voice), he has a brand new best friend, but he only wishes that the bear could really talk so they could really be friends. In this movie, wishes come true.

""Ted"", the movie, is crass, offensive, rude, obnoxious, gross, sophomoric, disgusting, childish, offensive (did I say that already?) and surprisingly heartfelt. Yes, that's true. The biggest, most surprising thing about ""Ted"" is that it has a heart. Somewhere in the midst of all the slosh and rudeness, the movie manages to make you care and feel a real genuine kinship with John and his rude, prostitute hiring, dope smoking, ""Flash"" loving, party throwing teddy bear.

If you're offended easily, ""Ted"" is not for you. It will offend. That's a guarantee. There are no rocks left unturned when it comes to offensiveness. Although, the last two-thirds of the movie changes tone a bit and becomes something different. Oh, it's still offensive at times, but the characters begin to be fleshed out, and the people who enjoyed the first two-thirds, may not enjoy the last one-third as much. They were smart enough to keep some pretty good jokes near the end as well.

""Ted"" is not just a movie about a teddy bear and it isn't just a one-gimmick type movie either. The writing is good, although some of the plot twists in the last part of the movie were a little predictable and silly. The jokes are numerous and MacFarlane used every trick he had to keep them rolling from offensiveness, to thinkers, to spoof and then some. Some of the jokes, I thought, were actually really intelligent.

I certainly don't recommend this movie to everybody, but if you can take a joke and don't mind no limits joke telling, you will have a great time at the theatre. Otherwise, avoid like the plague.",1341446400,3,2330,4.687041564792176
4792768,1,B005LAII1C,"For a movie that has no story and is just about a guy getting trashed with his teddy bear, it should have been 30 min. This should have just been a made for TV Family Guy special so people would not have to waste $12 for this film.",1341360000,16,231,3.8333333333333335
4792769,3,B005LAII1C,"On an opening weekend that was filled with ""what you see is what you get...and nothing more"" films, Seth MacFarlane's Ted was no exception. That is not to say that it was a bad film. It was more like a 106 minute-long commercial for Boston with the feel of a live-action episode of ""Family Guy"".

I found it surprising and slightly disappointing that MacFarlane chose to voice Ted with a Peter Griffin-esque style, as opposed to just being his natural Brian-like self. Mark Wahlberg is fine as the straight man to Ted's obnoxiousness, and Mila Kunis (Lori) is equally fine as Wahlberg's flame, but their performances neither shined nor faltered. They just...were. Joel McHale was a nice surprise as Kunis' sleazy boss who persists as her unwanted suitor, and Patrick Stewart is always a welcome narrator, no matter the genre.

The plot, as you may have heard, consists of a boy named John who wishes for his teddy bear to be real so that he can finally have a friend when no one else will grant him that privilege. Naturally, in the style of Big, the teddy bear comes to life because John just happened to make his wish on a night wherein a shooting star occurs. Apparently, shooting stars possess magical powers.

The bear shocks everyone (including father Ralph Garman in a bit role) when he walks and talks, prompting the ""honey, go get my gun"" line that naturally follows. Child-like teddy bear, or ""Ted"", then asks if it is a ""hugging gun"". He then proceeds to mature with John throughout the opening credits. Fast-forward to twenty years later and the twosome pass much of their time smoking pot and watching Flash Gordon while commenting on pop culture and modern society. These carefree buds love each other with that irresponsible, frat-boy-brotherhood mentality that has become so prominent in today's culture.

The predictable conflict arises when John realizes that he cannot lead a normal adult life until he can hold Lori, the love of his life, in a higher regard than his ""bromance"". He knows that he must separate himself from Ted, but that's difficult to do when they've experienced most of their lives together. Plus, the fun-loving, hooker-acquiring, trash-talking Ted is just too much fun to tell no. After all, he keeps getting bigger and better promotions for acting increasingly worse on the job.

The film worked just fine on that conflict alone. It did not need the last-minute subplot in which villain Giovanni Ribisi attempts to kidnap Ted for his spoiled brat son (Aedin Mincks). This seemed like a tacked-on idea and, like many other recent movies, could have shaved off some of its unnecessarily lengthy run-time. However, this sets up the ending of the movie rather well, so it's not entirely for naught.

There are enough pop culture references in this film to sink a ship and plenty of pot-shots at celebrities we all love to hate, including Justin Bieber, Taylor Lautner and the widely despised Superman Returns film and its star, Brandon Routh. Ted definitely caters to fans of ""Family Guy"" with its brand of humor, although there were one too many anti-Semitic jokes for my taste. Particularly tired and offensive to some, I'm sure, was an Asian cliche that spiraled down rather rapidly into ridiculousness.

One scene near the end was particularly hysterical, though, which led me to believe that they saved their best joke for last. Familiar cameos are sprinkled throughout the movie, so you never know who will turn up and when. Ted is a good one-time watch, but if you're looking to save a few bucks, pick it up as a rental. It doesn't need to be seen on the big screen to be enjoyed.",1341273600,2,3624,4.807383627608346
