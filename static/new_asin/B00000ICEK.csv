1221205,5,B00000ICEK,"I've waited for I Married Joan, Collection set II to get a DVD release.  I have been checking & checking, & at last it's coming out!  The first set was great, the DVD quality was pretty good too, given the time the series came out.

Joan Davis is a highly underrated, classy & talented Comedic Actress who left us a great legacy of her work to enjoy for generations to come.  I have watched episodes of this series over & over again & am greatly entertained.  Joan is wonderful at physical comedy with her various expressions & style of comedy, we can't help but be reeled in at Joan Stevens' screwball antics & anticipate more chaos & fun in coming episodes!

Jim Backus is fantastic as Joan's put-upon Husband, Judge Bradley Stevens.  The cast works well, which adds to the winning formula of this sitcom.  Sadly, Bev, Joanie's real-life Daughter had passed on rather young.  She portrayed Joan's Sister in the show.  She even bore a fairly strong resemblance to Joan, & was a fine contribution to the series.

I highly recommend all fans of vintage sitcoms & fine comedy to add this series to your library.  It's one of the best & I have proudly added it to mine.  I just hope future DVD releases are put out.

1221206,5,B00000ICEK,"Joan Davis, in the ""I Married Joan"" set is stiff competition for Lucy, in ""I Love Lucy"".  Joan gets herself into crazy, comical siutations where the viewer is forced to laugh and love the character of  Joan.  The video set is addictive.  After watching one show, it's difficult  to refrain from  viewing the next episode. The box set is worth the price;  providing hours of entertainment and hilarious laughter.",949190400,7,411,4.869565217391305
1221217,5,B00000ICEK,"Joan Davis's original comedy was much copied by later comedians, but none could imitate her technique.  Her TV series was too short for many of us and her life too tragic.  Joan is appealing, goofy, and a master of timing.  You cannot help but love her and the way she makes you laugh.  Never raucous like Carol Burnett, never phony and self-centered like Lucy, but always hilarious.",1326499200,,383,4.6716417910447765

1221220,5,B00000ICEK,"I was born in 1990 but I love these vintage sitcoms, and this is a favourite. These episodes are warm and funny, and it's fun to see the 1950's home interior. Somehow, this appealing show never made the Top 20, although it was popular enough to be exported around the world during the 1950's (even to Australia!). I most certainly recommend this series, it's aged very well.",1237593600,2,374,4.597014925373134
1221221,4,B00000ICEK,I used to watch this show yrs ago but they are not as entertaining as I remember . Shes alot like Lucy she gets into all kinds of messes. My 8 yr old daughter enjoys them....They are fun episodes to watch.,1206662400,,205,4.024390243902439
1221222,5,B00000ICEK,"Although I'm only 17, I honestly think this is better than many shows on TV today. In fact, ""I Married Joan"" proves that a squeaky clean sitcom can be extremely funny, and I couldn't stop laughing thanks to the clever writing and great comic acting. As another reviewer notes, If you enjoy ""I Love Lucy"", You'll probably enjoy this show too. This, along with ""The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show"", ""Life With Elizabeth"", ""Meet Corliss Archer"", ""The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet"" and of course ""I Love Lucy"" are fun 50's sitcoms which are timeless. I've got all 3 volumes Alpha Video has released of this show, and I've shown them to my grandma, who loved seeing this show again. Picture quality is pretty good for a budget release, sound is quite clear.",1173571200,,759,4.6716417910447765

1221224,4,B00000ICEK,"Joan Davis was an alternative to Lucille Ball, Eve Arden (""Our Miss Brooks), Gale Storm and Gracie Allen.  ""I Married Joan"" was on TV at the same time as ""I Love Lucy,"" ""My Little Margie"" and ""Burns & Allen.""  I was fortunate to see Joan Davis whenever it was revived in reruns.  I fell in love with this zany character.

She was wonderful with physical comedy, just as TV's Lucy and  the movies', Doris Day.  The sitcoms of the '50s seem to have the same themes and most of the supporting players like Mabel Paige and Norma Varden went from set to set, week after week.  The same character actors could be seen in all of these shows.

Joan played a similar character as Lucy Ricardo, but she was married to a judge, beautifully played by Jim Backus (later in ""Gilligan's Island"").

If you want a diversion from Lucy, try Joan Davis.  She's a breath of fresh air.  I own all three collections (so far)and I love this adventure in ""looking back.""  There was a LOT of talent back in the '50s and Davis was one of the best.",1149379200,7,1020,4.338624338624339
1221225,5,B00000ICEK,"I just finished watching this DVD set and was pretty impressed.  There was only one problem, one of the shows on the first disc had the words not matching the mouths for the last 10 minutes of the program.  Otherwise, it was a great set, might have to order Set 1 even though I have most of those programs on VHS.  Joan was a great comedian, on par with Lucy with her slapstick antics!",1128470400,10,385,4.175675675675675
1221226,5,B00000ICEK,"What a thrill to see Joan Davis and Jim Backus in their smash it TV Series, ""I Married Joan""....to this day, it still brought a lot of laughs as well as take me back to when sit-coms were funny, clean-cut and worth the time in watching. You can't beat

old fashioned slapstick comedy and Joan Davis surely was a pro at that.  Well worth the price in gold and highly recommended to anyone whow wants to remember the way comedy should be.",1124582400,15,436,4.304878048780488
