4374016,5,B004GSVX8A,I had a life threatening problem from one Toe nail being longer than another. I took every drug the experimental drug community would sell me and nothing worked. The other day I bought this movie 4 pack and I'm healed. My long toe nail broke off and my wife finally stopped wearing her Kevlar pajamas to bed at night. Please buy this 4 pack and end the nightmare forever.,1307750400,6,371,4.391304347826087

4374018,5,B004GSVX8A,"I was surprised when I saw this collection of movies.  Usually when you find a collection, there will be one good movie and the others are inferior.  This collection you will find that all four movies are superior.  You have four leading stars in this collection starting with Randolph Scott, and then Audie Murphy, Jeff Chandler and also Alan Ladd.  Each movie is a classic and could stand alone, but when put together in a group it makes this one of the greatest finds you will find in a long time.  And the price is amazing.  You will not be disappointed in this collection and even if you only like one of the stars or one of the movies', it is still a good bargain.

4374050,4,B004GSVX8A,"The ""4 Movie Marathon: Classic Western Collection"" features four old Westerns on 2 disks:

ALBUQUERQUE

Released in 1948, ""Albuquerque"" is a Western starring Randolph Scott as Cole Armin, who arrives in the New Mexican town to work for his wicked uncle's ore-hauling freight line. When he discovers overt corruption, he switches to another company with an eye on his partner's sister (Catherine Craig). Meanwhile his uncle hires a hottie spy (Barbara Britton) from out of town to destroy the competition.

Reviewer msroz said it best in describing ""Albuquerque"" as an ""okay and likable western, neither exceptional nor routine."" The story is interesting, but loses momentum here and there; aspects of the film are better than the whole. One aspect that's great is the cast: Scott's amiable as the protagonist, George Cleveland is effective as the wannabe godfather of Albuquerque, Lon Chaney is formidable as one of the main heavies and the two women are gorgeous, especially Catherine Craig. She's both stunning and winsome. Another great element is the scenic Southwest locations, shot in Sedona, Arizona, and Iverson Ranch, California.

As long as you can adapt to the old-style of fimmaking ""Albuquerque is a worthwhile Western, but it's hampered by the negatives noted above.

The film runs 90 minutes.

GRADE: B-

==============================

WHISPERING SMITH

Released in 1948, ""Whispering Smith"" stars Alan Ladd in the eponymous role of a train detective who's starts to suspect that his friend, Murray (Robert Preston) may be involved with a gang that wrecks and loots trains. Murray's wife, (Brenda Marshall), is concerned about her husband hanging with ne'er-do-wells and wishes she had a righteous man, like Smith.

I was surprised at how much I enjoyed ""Whispering Smith."" It lacks that goofy humor and wacky characters that plague many old Westerns; plus the ancient score is more bearable than usual. Ladd is stunning as the noble and determined protagonist and so is Preston as the amiable husband gone bad. Can Murray be redeemed or has he gone too far?

The film runs 88 minutes and was shot in California.

GRADE: A-

==============================

THE DUEL AT SILVER CREEK

""The Duel at Silver Creek"" is a 1952 Western starring Stephen McNally and Audie Murphy as a sheriff and green deputy who are trying to track down a murderous gang of claim jumpers. Meanwhile the sheriff pursues a new hottie in town (Faith Domergue) while the deputy is interested in a teenage cutie (Susan Cabot). A 27 year-old Lee Marvin is on hand as one of the possibly shady characters.

I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this old Western. Murphy is great as the youthful and likable fast-gun and McNally is effective as the sheriff. Domergue is beautiful, but duplicitous and even shockingly evil (e.g. the unexpected strangling scene). Cabot is a joy to watch and it's interesting to see Marvin so young.

The story is interesting with McNally narrating and it easily keeps your attention at only 77 minutes, but what brings my rating down is the roll-your-eyes plot gimmicks (for lack of better word) typical of old Westerns. For instance, the sheriff's bad finger that makes it almost impossible for him to squeeze the trigger of his handgun and how this becomes a big secret. And then there's the way the deputy expertly grazes the sheriff's arm in order to take his place in a fast-draw duel (What if he was off by a couple of centimeters?). If it weren't for these types of lame aspects I'd give ""Duel at Silver Creek"" a higher grade.

 The locations are good, shot at three California ranches -- Corrigan Ranch, Iverson Ranch and Janss Conejo Ranch - as well as Vasquez Rocks.

GRADE: B-

==============================

WAR ARROW

The setting of 1953's ""War Arrow"" is Fort Clark in West Texas near Brackettville during the Indian Wars of the late 19th century. Major Brady (Jeff Chandler) arrives from D.C. to utilize a small band of transplanted Seminoles to aid the US Army against the marauding Kiowas. Brady conflicts with the Colonel of the fort (John McIntire) and romances a redheaded widow (Maureen O'Hara) while a Seminole woman takes interest in him (Suzan Ball).

Chandler was 33 during filming and is great as the masculine protagonist with Hollywood looks, but his greying hair makes him look at least a decade older. Sadly, he'd be dead in less than ten years due to a botched surgery. McIntire as the by-the-book and jealous CO is odious, but maybe redeemable.

The women, O'Hara and Ball, are another highlight. Maureen was 32 during filming and looked great, but she's one of those women who became more exquisite as she got older (to a point, that is). In the early 60s she was one of the most beautiful women to walk the face of the planet. In ""War Arrow"" she hadn't reached her voluptuous peak yet and she was hardly a good actress at the time, but it is interesting to see her when she was younger. Just as beautiful - and perhaps even more so - was the rising brunette Suzan Ball. She was only 18 during filming and is just stunning as the Seminole Avis. Sadly, she would pass away a mere two years after ""War Arrow"" was released due to cancer.

Another positive for me is the Agoura, CA, locations, which - surprisingly - are a decent stand-in for West Texas. In any event, the film has a great Western ""look.""

Unfortunately, the film loses points due to using white actors in the main Native roles, like Dennis Weaver as the Seminole brave who loves Avis and Henry Brandon as Avis' father, Maygro, not to mention Ball as Avis. But this is forgivable since this was the standard practice of the time and there were no Native actors available. Less forgivable is the stereotypical portrayal of the Indians (the haltingly way they speak English, dancing around the fire and the music), but actually it's not as bad as you would think.

The biggest negative is the old-style of filmmaking of Westerns at the time. This is clearly a Hollywoodized portrayal of the Old West that could never be mistaken for reality. Yet there are a number of Westerns that broke out of the these limitations of the era, like 1950's excellent ""The Sundowners"" (not to be confused with the 1960 film of the same name) and 1956's ""The Last Wagon,"" both of which rank with my favorite Westerns of all time. I point this out to show that some Westerns rose to the top in the 1930s thru 1950s, but ""War Arrow"" wasn't one of them. Still, it's certainly worth catching for the positives noted above. For me, it's like going back in time and is enjoyable for this alone.

The film runs 78 minutes.

Included are: Albuquerque w/ Randolph Scott, Whispering Smith w/ Alan Ladd, Duel at Silver Creek w/ Audie Murphy, and War Arrow w/ Jeff Chandler. At the time of their original releases, dozens of high quality Westerns were being made each year, and these movies were taken for granted as ""average."" Time has been very kind to them. They look better and better as time goes by. The picture and sound quality is great on all 4 movies.

And on this particular DVD you have 2 legends and 2 sleepers. Randolph Scott and Alan Ladd (see SHANE) legends. Audie Murphy a B-western legend. And Jeff Chandler who died far too young from a botched routine surgery. In fact I dare you to find a bad Jeff Chandler movie. Just check out the prices IF THEY'RE AVAILABLE!Pay particular attention to Away all boats,Merrill's Mauraders, & The Jayhawkers.",1354665600,,518,4.580645161290323

I find Maureen O'Hara to be unbearable in everything she was in except The Parent Trap (she was excellent in that).  The John Wayne movies she is in (like Quiet Man and McClintock) are unwatchable.

Albuquerque stars Randolph Scot, 4 1/2 stars
Whispering Smith stars Alan Ladd, 4 stars
The Duel of Silver Creek stars Audre Murphy ( Medal of Honer winner WW2)is my favorite of this 4 movie set....4 3/4 stars'
War Arrow... Maureen O'hara and Jeff Chandler star. 4 stars.

If you like Westerns you will like this DVD set. All these movies had lots of gun cowboy action and pretty women.
Total rating 4 stars and proudly added to our family DVD library. I would of rated the collection a little higher if each movie was on an individual DVD in a individual jewel box.",1331596800,24,832,4.42483660130719

Enough said.  Each of these films is worth the five dollar price, but Albuquerque and Whispering Smith are the best of the group.  Whispering Smith was so good that they later made it into a TV series starring Audie Murphy.  I watched each of these films when I was a child at Saturday Afternoon Matinees.  They've all been on TV numerous times and I still enjoy each of them immensely.  Universal has done a great job of packaging these four great westerns together.  If you are a fan of Classic Western Movies as I am, then this is a must have for you.  It is more than worth the $5.49 purchase price.  Definitely two thumbs up.",1329955200,11,819,4.593103448275862
