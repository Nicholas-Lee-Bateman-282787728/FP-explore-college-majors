8229159,5,B000XPXSKQ,What an up lifting story about a person with disabilities and overcoming them. This story is ageless!,1415750400,,101,5.0
8229160,4,B000XPXSKQ,"My daughter and I watched this. Blessed Margaret is so simple, but her message is so powerful. I have loved her for a long time and was happy to share this with my daughter. The only thing I found a little distracting was the wind blowing through their microphones when they were speaking outside. They still do an amazing job introducing the world to some very inspiring people that we all should emulate. Bravo!",1390089600,,413,4.594594594594595
8229161,1,B000XPXSKQ,"This particular product is a filmed stage play, not a movie. (And a seemingly amateur one at that.) No offense to those who produced it, but it's not terribly impressive.

One of the most fundamental and essential components of the visual arts is that they be visual. Verbal description (""I am thinking this"", ""I felt that"", ""This is why this is happening"", etc.) has its place at times, but a small place to be sure. The first twenty plus minutes of the play (stopped watching shortly after this) are riddled with excessive description ""This is my name and this is what happened when I was five and this is how this man reacted what that happened and allow me to explain to you now with more words the significance of why this happened"", etc., etc. I can only hope that the rest of the play progresses in more visually tangible and dramatic fashion.

The book is awesome:<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Life-of-Blessed-Margaret-of-Castello-1287-1320/dp/0895552132/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Life of Blessed Margaret of Castello, 1287-1320</a>. This particular play, on the other hand, needs a great deal of fine tuning to make it worth watching. Until then, one is much better off sticking with the book. It's almost feels like that's what you're doing anyway as you watch.",1295222400,2,1320,5.311004784688995
8229162,5,B000XPXSKQ,I have read this book several times and never tire of it.  It makes you wonder how her parents could not love their own child.  Beauty was not in Blessed Margaret and her parents were ashamed of her.,1268870400,,199,4.2105263157894735
