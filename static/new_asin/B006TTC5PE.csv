5016599,5,B006TTC5PE,"This set is quite an eclectic mix but none the worse for that. My Little Chickadee features Mae West and WC Fields doing their schtick, with a paper-thin plot to hang their one-liners on. Not a great film by any stretch, but it's fun to see these two stars together. (And Margaret ""Wicked Witch of the West"" Hamilton has an amusing part as pious and prying do-gooder.)

The other films are acknowledged classics. The hilarious Pillow Talk was the first pairing of Day and Hudson (and a very funny Tony Randall as their neurotic mutual acquaintance), and it helped set the course of romantic comedies in the 60's with its relatively blatant sexual subtext. Charade is Stanley Donen's effective go at making a Hitchcock thriller; like many of Hitch's films, it features an innocent (Hepburn) caught up in a plot to chase down a MacGuffin (here a bunch of stolen WWII loot) with a heavy focus on witty romantic repartee (the type of thing Grant was born for). A powerful Mancini score adds extra verve. Double Indemnity is one of the best and most influential noir thrillers, with dark themes of seduction, murder, and betrayal, and a visual and verbal style that would give birth to countless later films.

Extras include commentaries and documentaries about Pillow Talk and Double Indemnity, histories of Universal on the Charade disc, and none for My Little Chickadee.",1339372800,15,1368,4.866952789699571
5016600,5,B006TTC5PE,"Interesting eclectic mix of movies - enjoyed ""My Little Chickadee"" more than I thought I would.  ""Double Indemnity"" is one of my favorite noir films and that alone is worth ordering this set.  Haven't viewed ""Pillow Talk"" yet.  ""Charade"" was a very enjoyable way to spend an evening - the interplay between Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn was just a delight.",1334793600,5,356,4.80327868852459
5016621,5,B006TTC5PE,Great movies!,1428019200,,13,6.0
5016622,5,B006TTC5PE,"Amazing film collection!!! All of these actors are so great in their own right. These are classic films and at their best, each one great in its own dimension!",1424304000,,159,4.517241379310345
5016623,5,B006TTC5PE,"Stop The Presses!  Well worth the price for the excellent presentation of ""Double Indemnity"" alone! Great picture and audio. Arguably the best ""film noir"" piece ever. If you think of ""My Three Sons"" when you think of Fred MacMurray,  put that image out of your mind, and feast upon his awesome and dark personna in ""Double Indemnity"".  Fred is easily one of our greatest actors. He could  do it all. Comedy, suspense, drama, etc..  Fasten your seatbelt and hang on for his sinister best here! An incredible talent. Stanwyck simmers and shines, too. Toss in the great Edward G. Robinson, and you've got classic cinema cum laude. "" Where's your ""My Three Sons"" nowwwww?!""  :)
  I was pleasantly surprised by ""Charade"". I'd never seen it, and really enjoyed it, again with great picture and sound. ""Pillow Talk"" is one of Doris Day's best, and once again, excellent picture and audio here.
  Must confess I haven't watched ""My Little Chickadee"" from this four film set yet, but I have every confidence its presentation will be first-rate, too.
  This four-film set belongs in everyone's DVD collection. Well worth the price for ""Double Indemnity"" alone!! What a movie! Get the popcorn started and enjoy!! By the way, the disc for ""Double Indemnity"" is label as ""Disc #1"", leading me to the conclusion it's from a deluxe 2-disc set. Extras include trailer, a beefy separate treatise on Film Noir and ""Double Indemnity"" (you'll enjoy this), two commentary tracks, and scene selection. Nice bonus surprises!",1423785600,2,1501,4.96
5016624,5,B006TTC5PE,All four of these are fun happy movies. Glad I bought this set!,1415664000,,63,3.923076923076923
5016625,1,B006TTC5PE,I  wanted to see all these films so badly but they do not play in Australia.  I seem to have a 70% success rate with orders from Amazon and sometimes the risk is worth it.,1389312000,,171,3.857142857142857
5016626,5,B006TTC5PE,"..... but they're all worth having, if you're a collector,  and each title is on a single disc ..... meaning they were all made to be sold individually at one time.  Buying them in this package it comes to less than $4.00 per title, when years ago you'd expect to pay close to $20 for one title on a VHS tape.  On a side note, on Double Indemnity, kudos to Universal for still giving credit to Paramount Pictures, the studio that originally produced it, prior to its sale to MCA years ago.",1388620800,,489,4.293478260869565
5016627,5,B006TTC5PE,"I bought this for ""Double Indemnity"" because it's on the AFI's Top 100 films of all-time and I'm trying to collect all 100 plus films. (Since there were two lists generated, one in 1997 and a second one in 2007, there are really more than 100 films!) ""cahrade"" is another great films. I'm not a great fan of Doris Day or Rock Hudson but it works. ""My Little Chikadee"" is a true classic! FUNNY!",1378944000,,393,4.324324324324325
5016628,4,B006TTC5PE,"These movies are some of the best made. We love the actors, the plot and the action which never stops.",1363219200,,102,4.15
5016629,5,B006TTC5PE,"This DVD offers quite a range of couples.  W.C. Fields and Mae West marry but never quite get together in My Little Chicadee.  Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant  star in Charade, a suspenseful and sometimes comic adventure before they are officially a couple.  (The film holds up amazingly well and still comes across as smart and stylish.)  Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray are a couple bound together then destroyed by their mutual larcency.  Last, but far from least, the couple Doris Day and Rock Hudson.  Pillow Talk (1959) plays much better than I would have expected.  It was a fun romp. (Doris Day was not a virgin, by the way, but did not have a boyfriend currently, whereas Rock Hudson seems to have far too many girlfriends at the same time).
The DVD is beautifully restored.  The trailers were not, but the films themselves were dazzling in their clarity and color.
The commentary of Pillow Talk was especially interesting.",1346112000,5,934,4.823899371069182
5016630,5,B006TTC5PE,"I bought this DVD collection for the film ""My Little Chickadee"" a film that was one of Mae West's best but I found the other three in this set ""Charade"" with Cary Grant ""Double Indemity"" with Barbara Stanwyck and ""pillow Talk"" with Doris Day more than just enjoyable, they're all priceless.",1341360000,6,290,4.705882352941177
