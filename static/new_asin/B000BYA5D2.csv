8094242,2,B000BYA5D2,"Mostly third-rate matches with some guys quitting after the first round because they are out of breath. Now and then, a good match is thrown in, like the one between Dean Lister and Jeremy Irons, but it is marred by incompetent ringside reporting. Visual quality is only fair.
I'd much rather watch a UFC or Pride disc-10 bouts of highly skilled fighters, shot with quality camerawork and reporting instead of 135 fights between mediocre fighters, with mediocre camerawork and reporting.",1188518400,3,487,5.1
