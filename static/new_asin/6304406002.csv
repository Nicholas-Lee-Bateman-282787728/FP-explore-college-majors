862231,4,6304406002,"Don't expect something visually amazing. This is a movie of a stage production. However, that being said, the costumes were cute and the music fun. My nieces and I loved to watch it together and it's not like you have to worry about them throwing out any profanity. It's good times.",1279929600,,282,4.549019607843137
862232,5,6304406002,"This production is sweet, but not too sweet. Scary, but not too scary. Fantastical moments are balanced by earthy reality. And the happy ending is something to work for, not simply to be granted. Which, if I'm not mistaken, is exactly the combination a faerie tale should have. Watch it and you'll be almost guaranteed to Dream Happy (unless you're a wicked stepmother, of course).",1213315200,,381,4.876923076923077
862233,4,6304406002,"This New York State Theatre Institute production of a classic, Italian version of the fairytale, 'Cinderella,' is a metaphor for the oft used description, ""Where you sit determines what you see.""  And, a child who watches 'A Tale of Cinderella' sits in a seat entirely different than that of an adult.

First, children (especially little girls) love 'A Tale of Cinderella.'  The music and lyrics, created by Will Severin and George David Weiss, are engaging.  And, what little girl does not wish to be a princess?  'A Tale of Cinderella,' is the classic story, but there is a ""realness"" in a stage production. There princess who endures real-life tragedies, the death of her mother and the marriage of her father to a witch of a stepmother.  She overcomes these tragedies with the help of her fairy godmother to marry a prince.  The live action on the stage adds realness for the younger viewer that the animated productions do not.  Seeing little girls watch 'A Tale of Cinderella' over and over, it's not hard to understand that this regional production had such a successful run and caught the attention of Warner Brothers.

On the other hand, an adult will notice that this translation of a stage play to the small screen is a little clunky.  There may not have been any way for the camera angles to have been improved, and as such, the action does not seem natural.  Camera angle is not the only reason, however.  An adult home video audience is not accustomed to seeing stage actors acting in a stage play on television, so some of the facial expressions and movements appear unnatural.  Stage direction and the stage actors' anxiety due to the knowledge of being recorded for video may also have contributed to the unusual end product.  Regardless of the reason, many, more mature viewers, i.e., parents, may find 'A Tale of Cinderella' a difficult to endure.

A bright spot with which both children and adults can identify, however, is the performance of Christianne Tisdale, who plays Angelina, or Cinderella.  A veteran of the Broadway stage, Ms. Tisdale is a rose in a briar patch.  The rest of the cast is mostly second-tier, regional actors.  Sean Frank Sullivan is serviceable as the Prince, but many of the other performances are either overdone (the fairy godmother) or just terribly average (the evil stepmother).  Fortunately, Ms. Tisdale single-handedly carries the show for the adult viewer with her angelic voice, stage presence, and experience.

If I were a seven-year old girl, give or take three years, I would have to give 'A Tale of Cinderella' a full, five-star rating, because I really would not know or care about good acting, directing, or producing.  I would simply love the music and love Cinderella.  On the other hand, if I were, say, a father of a couple of girls between the ages of four and ten, it would be difficult for me to look past the strangeness of the stage play on video and the mostly undistinguished performances.  I, too, would have enjoyed the music and I would have loved to hear Christianne Tisdale sing.  As such, I would only give the video two stars.  Rounding up, it's a four.

862234,5,6304406002,"Our six year old daughter rented this movie and loves it.  She has always been fascinated with Cinderella.  We are to return the movie today and she is insisting it is hers.  Our daughter is autistic and for her to have this much interest in a play amazes me.  I catch her singing the songs.  Maybe we have an actress to be on our hands?  So, for us this is a great movie because it is so well done and it has inspired our daughter.",1086393600,8,432,4.023529411764706
862235,5,6304406002,"In a show that focuses on the stars and their influence, Christianne Tisdale turns this Cinderella into a star-making role.  She shines, glitters and shoots straight for your heart.  Rarely have I seen acting and singing (I think she spans four octaves)melded into such a seamless, accessable performance.  I  just found her website.  Special kudos to Sean Sullivan as the most charming of Princess Charmings and John Romeo as his even more charming Godfather. A must-see for all generations.",1017187200,2,492,5.177215189873418
862236,5,6304406002,"This is truly a remarkable video! The author, William Frankonis, has taken the classic Cinderella tale and improved it 100-fold. The best re-telling of the tale I've seen, rich in culture and whimsy, with a Cinderella who  has a backbone and will of her own.  He is an imaginative and bold story  teller and has created a wonderful new fairy tale for families to enjoy  together.  Bene!",952560000,3,386,4.701492537313433

7870054,5,6304406002,"I thoroughly enjoyed this musical version of Cinderella, which was filmed on a stage with minimal special effects. The songs are at least as good as many that one can hear in Hollywood versions of Cinderella. The songs are by a well-known writer of musicals and songs used by some prominent performers. The plot is entertaining and the characters are well cast. The Cinderella is pretty, the Prince is charming and youthful. The fairy Godmother is an original, a good comedienne. Other supporting characters were also well cast and right for the story, such as the wicked stepmother, etc. The action did not lag, and I can recommend it as a very enjoyable performance. At least as good as or better than many other versions available as DVDs.",1491177600,,742,4.8046875
