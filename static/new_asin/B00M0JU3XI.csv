6531663,5,B00M0JU3XI,"I CAN'T STOP WATCHING THIS MOVIE --- EVERY DAY!
It's as if I'm drawn to the message, the music, and the performances of all the actors, but more importantly to Warren Christie.  After watching him in ""The Most Wonderful Time of the Year"" movie, I had to see what other movies he had played in, and, thankfully came upon this Jewel!!!
Please cast Warren in more movies like this one to showcase his warmth, humor, smile, romantic side and his natural talent.",1521590400,,457,4.573170731707317

6531669,5,B00M0JU3XI,My wife loved the movi,1517184000,,22,3.6
6531670,5,B00M0JU3XI,I loved this movie. This is a movie that the entire family can watch and feel joyful and thankful at the end. You will not be disappointed.,1516924800,,139,4.185185185185185
6531671,4,B00M0JU3XI,"Lacy Chabert plays a mom with two young boys whose husband has died recently after a long illness; Warren Christie plays a husband who  suddenly lost his wife and mother of their three children: an older girl ( 12?), and two boys, all of whom from both families go the same private religious school.  This point is very important because the church pastor and members create a nexus of support and sometimes dictative opinion toward the couple.

Though she is still grieving herself, she observes that  the  daddy is having an even tougher time of it, overwhelmed by
laundry, shopping, and cleaning, all  tasks done by his former wife.  She reaches out just by a little supportive conversation from time to time.

Later, one of them suggests a cooperative dinner together, and, even with  5 children, it goes very well. Gradually, and in my opinion, very respectfully to themselves, the grieving process,and to their children, they do more, and have more fun, and seem to really all like each other.

You can guess how this ends happily, but I liked how it seemed to progress with everyone's needs and cares in mind, that is, slowly, without rushing.  By the time the  end came, you have a lot of trust that everyone is on board.

There were only two scenes that were seared into my memory, one with  great  sympathy and empathy, and the other
with anger and great irritation.  The first was when Daddy was really having difficulty coping, and things were going
badly at breakfast.  The oldest son (younger than sis), was standing barefoot in his pajamas on the cold kitchen floor,
so upset and angry, that he just said loudly, and over and over  ""I WANT MY MOM BACK! I WANT MY MOM BACK!""
He wasn't throwing anything or being aggressive, but you could see he was just really emotionally overwhelmed,
the situation around him was loud and chaotic, and he KNEW what he needed!!!  I cried at that point because I, too have lost someone unexpectedly, and surprised myself at how much anger there  was and that the ONLY thing that would mend this mess and make things right again, was if they were HERE!  NOW!

The other thing happened about a year later in the story.  The couple, including all accompaniments, were doing fine
even on a joint vacation, when a so called friend, calls the mom aside, telling her that certain parishioners were a little alarmed at the ""speed"" at which  their friendship/dateship was progressing, and what if it doesn't work out? wouldn't the kids be upset, blah blah gossip gossip.  My reaction did  NOT see this as kindness,or  compassion, but as
none their business, and merely gossip to fill in the uninvited and  dissatisfied curiosity they were generating, a good waste of energy.  If  I were a Christian and knew  Jesus' sayings better, or much more of the Bible, probably an appropriate story or saying could be found, but I have to  trust the heart and gut given me.

Therefore,  this was not an unrealistic story, but  on the contrary,  quite as I have seen and experienced going through the grieving process.  This film also gives me insight in being around people who have or are experiencing a similar
process, or dating someone similar.",1514764800,,3176,4.709090909090909
