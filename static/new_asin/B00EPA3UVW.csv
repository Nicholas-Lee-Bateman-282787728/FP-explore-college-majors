5932290,1,B00EPA3UVW,"Okay, I really wanted to like this movie, but it was so boring. I thought at some point it would get even mildly interesting, but I was dissapointed. Also, the product description says it's based on the prodigal son, and I'm sorry, but I don't see it. I really wouldn't recommend- too much bad acting in this movie. Invest on another better christian movie.",1384732800,5,357,4.59375
5932291,2,B00EPA3UVW,"This movie was nicely shot, decently acted, had an interesting take on a stereotypical plot. I expected to like it as a slightly cheesy, but heartwarming and interesting story. However, in the end, there were too many scenes that didn't not make sense and too many character dynamics that were never worked out. Because of the formulaic nature of the movie, you understood what you were supposed to get from the plot (sibling rivalry, a faithful father figure, a reformed husband, a wrong solution country doctor, a redeemed family situation) but the actual work of dialogue and backstory did not do enough to justify these characterizations.

***spoiler alerts***

Here is just a list of some of the things that did not make sense to me:

1. Why was Faith rejected by her husband's family? Why did her sister-in-law say that Faith had split the family in half? Was Luke's father in favor his marriage to Faith (""Sometimes the hardest thing is asking for forgiveness"") or against it (""its her, isn't it?)? Luke's brother is also supposed to be anti-Faith, but then he calls in a favor for Faith at the doctor's while simultaneously trying to get Luke to sleep with another woman to break up his marriage. Say what?

2. If it was supposed to be a step of character-building for Luke to admit his fault in the crime, why did they not play that up more as a true development of character? Why did his father say that it was unacceptable for him to admit any wrongdoing, and then say, ""I stand with Luke"" when he signed the papers admitting wrongdoing?

3. Did Faith and Luke have a ""good"" marriage until she found out about his lying, or were they already having other problems as Faith seems to indicate when she is talking to her father, but these problems are never shown?

4. Why did Faith not invite her father or family to her wedding? Why did she break from her family?

5. What is it with the singing and ""finding the music"" again? I thought, for sure, that Faith would sing again at the end, but that wasn't a tie-in at all. I get that it is equivalent to finding a rhythm again with her husband, but, really, is that metaphor consistently worked out over the course of the movie??

6. The relationship between the sisters made no sense. Faith says that her sister hates her, but aside from the one very strange, territorial fight in the grocery store, how were we supposed to pick up on that? They seem to get along fine.

7. The baby at the end, really? Was there some other dimension to them not having kids before that should have been mentioned. (And the really fake pregnancy bump? I had to laugh.)

8. How could the movie cut from Calvin talking to Luke and declaring that he would not be treated for brain surgery, and then to the family home in Carolina with his grandchildren playing around him? The transition made no sense--Faith and Olivia would not have let him abandon treatment without a huge family blow-up.

9. But primarily, why does Faith take Luke back? Don't misunderstand me, I'm so glad that she does, and that the movie remains committed to the marriage relationship, but in the context of the movie, it makes no sense. Has he actually demonstrated a reformed character, or the desire to walk a new path, or made a complete confession? No. The relationship between Luke and Faith should have been one of the driving forces of the movie, and it just fell flat.  It doesn't seem that Faith authentically chooses her husband over the doctor. She accepts that her father hands her back to her husband, but she seemed much happier with the doctor. They should have shown a more complete reconciliation.",1384300800,7,3628,4.607751937984496

5932297,3,B00EPA3UVW,"The acting was surprisingly good. The story was a little bit predictable, but I enjoyed it. The best part of the movie was the music! Jana Kramer has an incredible voice, and there were two songs specifically that I wanted to download immediately, ""Weeds and Wildflowers"" and ""The First and the Last Time"". The later song is on the DVD extras as a music video with scenes from the movie. Imagine my shock when I couldn't find the soundtrack or even the singles on itunes! After more searching, I found the movie's facebook page where they posted that there were no plans to release a soundtrack! What a serious loss for this film! I felt that the music was a focus of the film, and not having a soundtrack or singles available for purchase is a mistake. This would be at least a 4 star review if not for the lack of soundtrack.",1380326400,,827,4.411764705882353

Although it is a love story, what I love is that the focus of the film is the family story. The messages of appreciating loved ones, working out problems rather than discarding relationships and nurturing warmth and mutual respect are strong in this film...

5932312,2,B00EPA3UVW,"I saw a trailer for the movie and I was excited to see it on Netflix.  I love movies like this - the plot reminded me of me something you would see on Hallmark.  It was pretty hard to watch though.  Aside from Gerald McCraney, the acting was sub par at best.  But, what made it so bad was the writing.  The story itself was good, but they made it so boring.  It was also incredibly disjointed.

(Spoilers Ahead)

The movie starts with Faith's husband getting arrested and her going back home to North Carolina (or is it South Carolina?).  They rarely even interact in the entire movie. She is understandably mad at him. It seems like divorce is imminent.  But, a quick visit from Faith's father with her husband (they have apparently never met) and all of the sudden they are back together.  Also, Faith and her sister hate each other at first (it is never revealed why), and out of nowhere, they love each other and appear incredibly close.  Finally, you have Faith's in-laws.  It appears like they have this incredibly dysfunctional family (a flashback reveals that her husband left the family business and they practically disowned him), but no worries - they all magically start getting along after he's arrested.  As a bonus: There is a doctor in town that Faith seems to like.  That story is pretty much background noise and is dropped altogether.

The whole story attempts to exemplify the story of the ""Prodigal Son"" (only in this case, it's the daughter), but they failed pretty miserably at it.

Like I said, I like a good cheesy, family-type movie.  But, this was terrible.  The only reason for 2 stars (instead of 1), is that someone at the studio who produced it had the good sense to cast Gerald McCraney, who is the only saving grace in the entire movie.",1473206400,,1769,4.576433121019108

5932379,2,B00EPA3UVW,"I knew going in that this would be a low budget film with the usual less-than-stellar acting, and I was ok with that - I like those movies just fine as long as its a cute story with likeable characters.  My rating is based more on the fact that the plot and dialogue was so confusing and made no sense half the time!

Many important (I think?) parts of the story are told in flashbacks, but its not immediately clear whether its a flashback or not, so that's confusing.

The advertisement I saw for the movie is actually the beginning of the movie.  In about two minutes time, you get the ""I moved to New York to become a singer...but then I fell in love."" narrative, which tells you she fell in love, got married, then her husband got arrested and is now in jail.  I expected that to be the first thirty minutes or so of the movie because it really would have set up the plot better and helped the viewers know what the issues were.  Instead, you are trying to figure out through the whole movie what's really going on because it immediately starts with her going back home to her father and he doesn't want her to apologize for anything and he doesn't feel she needs to explain what the issues with her husband are unless she wants to....so the viewer is left clueless as to why there is so much tension and awkwardness between the family members.

I got so lost in the conversations between characters...one second they are talking about her mother, the next second its horses, then another comment is made that I think is in reference to the mother again...or is it?  It was so weird....bad, bad writing.

There were too many issues to resolve, so there is really no character development or closure for the viewer...everything is just supposed to be ok all of a sudden, but none of it makes sense!  Of course, if they'd spent less of the movie on shallow dialogue (reminiscing about the past) and the weirdness between Faith and her sister (what was that grocery store thing all about????) and the extra characters coming up at random times for no apparent reason, there would have been more time to resolve all of the issues.

I didn't get all the references to music stopping.  I think it was a metaphor for love between husband and wife (""May the music never stop""), but they kept bringing it up at random times, and it was weird.  I think I was confused the first time because Faith asked her dad when the music stopped for him - before or after her mother died?  This made me think maybe they'd had some marital troubles before her death, but then the dad said it had never stopped, he could still hear it.  I think also at that point, I didn't realize Faith was so mad at her husband, because, again, that wasn't explained...all you really know at the beginning is that he's in jail, but according to him, he wasn't involved in anything illegal...just the partners in his company were, but he was aware it was happening.  I thought she went back home because all of her accounts were frozen and she had nothing to live on...I thought she still loved and supported her husband, but apparently that was not the case, thus...the music had stopped, and she was trying to get some insight about her marriage from her dad.

Also, other reviewers mentioned how she didn't really sing in this movie, even though she was supposedly an aspiring singer.  This was also weird.  She did go to church choir practice when it was her sister's turn to direct, but her sister stopped the choir because she wasn't singing and told her to sing a completely different song that the choir wasn't even going to sing...suddenly, Faith turns on her super-star show-off voice and sings two lines from the song, then gets upset at runs out of the church because....I don't know why.  It was her mother's favorite song so maybe it brought back painful memories?  Or had she stopped singing altogether after her mother died?  I didn't get that part at all.  However, I'm pretty sure the entire soundtrack was the actress singing, and I kind of wondered if the purpose of the movie was for her to showcase her talents and sell albums.  That might explain why it was so poorly written.

As others have mentioned, the good things about the movie are Gerald McRaney (always a great character), no profanities or adult content, and it emphasizes the importance of sticking with your marriage even when times get hard.

But it was oh-so-confusing!",1406246400,3,4423,4.546027742749054
5932380,4,B00EPA3UVW,"I like pretty much anything McRaney is in... that being said I think one of the negative posts pointed out correctly that at the end of the movie all these relationships just kinda end or get fixed without any explanation. Despite that, the bulk of the movie is about family and being there for one another. That marriage isn't just for the good times but a commitment no matter what the obstacles may be. It was worth the viewing. It's wholesome with good life lessons. Kick back and enjoy..",1405987200,,492,4.53932584269663
