8637716,3,B00I001D2G,"Dominic Purcell has taken over the role of the tough guy as Hazen Kaine. He is a hitman in Bulgaria and is given one last job before he retires, and that is to kill the two young daughters of Bulgarian royalty. He kidnaps them and locks them in a sealand. He takes from the older girl a medallion, one that matches a forearm tattoo he got in California. The next thing you know he is transported back into time...a time in Bulgarian history when they had a fire breathing dragon and spoke modern English with Eastern European accents.

He discovers that because of a tattoo which his now dead wife liked, he is destined to lead an army against the bad guys, fend off a dragon, and oh yea, there are these princesses babes with swords, the older of which doesn't like him. But in order to get back to the future, he will have to do it. I think you can write the rest of the story on your own, toss in a good shaman, and dress the bad guys in black. In fact you could script a better tale.

You don't really need to see the other two films of this Uwe Boll masterpiece series of bad theater in order to understand it, although I will admit I was more partial to those films. This is very similar to the second feature of the series

My biggest criticism is the name ""Hazen Kaine"".  In the first feature the hero is named ""Farmer."" In number two it was ""Granger.""  So what was with Kaine? How about ""Stockman""? Sure there is a homonym connection Kaine=Cane.  A crop is not a farmer.

Parental Guide: Plenty of F-bombs from Purcell...especially when he tries to mount a horse. No sex or nudity.",1391817600,2,1590,4.297658862876254
