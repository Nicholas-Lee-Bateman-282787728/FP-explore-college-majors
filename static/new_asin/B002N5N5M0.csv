Was happy to find Dexter; but miss the unedited version and being I have a 45% hearing loss I also miss the closed captions.  Wish this will get rectified!  Otherwise, I love to thank Amazon and Showtime for allowing us fans to view these shows!",1254355200,12,391,4.5285714285714285
3956283,1,B002N5N5M0,"I have really enjoyed the show, and am a regular viewer. This episode was a joke, however, as so much of the dialogue was blanked out. It was like listening to a really bad cell phone connection.",1254355200,12,195,4.297297297297297
3956284,5,B002N5N5M0,"What can I say... if you watched and loved seasons 1-3... season 4 episode 1 continues the fun and thrills.

I didn't watch the episode here due to its editting.  Even though I think the show is still the same length - I think they added in other scenes maybe or maybe it really is just 5 minutes shorter - but to be a free to view episode without having to log in - they must have taken out a lot of the original content out since there was a fair amount of nudity and killing.

Amazon really should have allowed people to either login to view an uneditted version or allowed people to buy that version versus just providing one version that's free and editted heavily.

The rest of the season will probably be available in its original form for purchasing from now on though - hopefully they will be at a reduced price as s1-3 are but I doubt it.",1254182400,3,848,4.216049382716049

3956309,5,B002N5N5M0,Very good material very unpredictable emotional season for a man with no emotions as the seasons go on dexter gains emotions and somewhat of an ability to connect with other seasons there is alot of death and sadness in this season and the trinity killer is by far the most sick sadistic killer they've ever had on the show the only downside is the ending while brilliant and unexpected it will change the entire outlook of the show and Dexter I'm an watching them all in a row for the first time I am hoping it is still good after this devastating ending,1491782400,,555,4.398058252427185

3956551,3,B002N5N5M0,"I have watched seasons 1-4 back-to-back and there are spoilers in this review.  Our serial-killer hero, Dexter, is not a born psychopath, but a good kid made into a killer by the profound trauma of witnessing his mother murdered by chain saw and then being forced to sit in her blood for two days before being rescued by a cop, Harry Morgan, who becomes his foster dad and teaches the emotionally empty shell how to pretend to be normal and in order to keep Dexter safe, how to channel his demons into the constructive path of hunting and killing only murderers.  The lessons from Dexters adoptive dad Harry echo internally as his ghost returns as the voice of guidance and internal dialogue.

Season 1 is a dramatic bullet-train of non-stop heart-pounding thrills  in which Dexter is toyed with by a fabulously talented serial killer who seems to know him intimately and whose skill seems to exceed his own.  Dexter works as a blood-splatter analyst for Miami Metro Homicide and helps his step-sister cop Debra hunt the Ice Truck Killer who leaves beautifully exsanguinated corpses. Family ties become strained and the question posed is what sort of family ties a serial killer can have as Dexter struggles to maintain a relationship with his girlfriend Rita and her two kids.

By season 2 Dexters relationship with Rita is thrown into turmoil with the reappearance of her drug-addict husband and a passionate romance with Lila, an artist, tormented with her own demons, who is determined to have Dexter as her soul-mate, but who keeps threatening Rita and the kids.  Season 3 finds Dexter exploring the prospects for friendship with a rogue prosecutor with his own sense of justice.  Dexter teaches him how to kill but the friendship sours as Ramon Prado pursues private vendettas with his new-found skills and, like Lila, must eventually fall under Dexters knife.  Except for Rita and her kids, an intimate relationship with Dexter is a bit like conjugation with a black-widow spider.

Part of the series charm is the way we find ourselves rooting for a serial killer trying to act the way he should when he cant feel it. All those moments of emotional isolation, of feeling different but trying to fit in, of acting how we think we should in order to belong  make Dexter a sympathetic figure. The show is also packed with wry irony and double entendres that put us in Dexters shoes, and mordant wit as when Dexter is ready to kill a psychologist who pushes his patients to suicide  but puts it off for a few days because he needs another session with him to address some intimacy issues he has with Rita.  Finally, the only people with whom Dexter can let his hair down and be himself are his victims, strapped to the abattoir table; not only do they have so much in common but they are hardly in a position to hold what he says against him.

One of the best critical reviews of The Final Season describes how the writers gave up in the final season and the show went to pot; I suspected that the decline would come earlier because it takes a lot of suspension of disbelief to watch a full-time serial killer, boyfriend and father surrogate, homicide forensics expert, sympathetic brother find time to juggle it all  and indeed by Season 4 things break down quite badly.  Dexter is on the trail of Trinity, the USAs most successful uncaught serial killer with a 30+ year record.  Trinity hides in plain sight as a model citizen, father, deacon and home-builder.  He takes troops of workers around the country to build homes for the needy and kills at these distant locations.  Dexter undertakes to enter Trinitys life as one of his helpers and becomes an intimate of Trinitys family and church.  When Dex decides that its time for Trinity to go, Dex offers a confidence that triggers a profound guilt in the senior serial-killer.  Dex stalks Trinity to his job site, takes out his anesthetizing needle and sneaks up from behind but sees Trinity about to leap to his death by impaling himself on the rebar below.  As the very large Trinity jumps, Dex grabs his wrist and unlike real life where they both go over or you cant hold on, Trinity hangs there while Dex has the insight that it is okay for Trinity to die so long as its by my hand.  So just as Dex is about to release Trinitys wrist, 4-5 co-workers come up and grab the boss and pull him to safety.  Whoops!  Whatever happened to the meticulous take-no-risks Dexter who never comes close to being caught?  Dexter doesnt have even a moments reflection about what he was doing planning to snatch Trinity from the middle of a fully occupied work site.

It gets better, or worse.  Dex becomes a softy and wants to start saving people instead of just killing the bad guys.  One of Trinitys victims is a 10-year old boy drugged and put into a duffle bag who will be dumped at night into a cement fill at the job-site.  (Dont ask how Trinity gets a large pit full of wet cement in the middle of the night at the build site.)  Rather like rescuing the damsel tied to the tracks, Dex arrives in the nick of time, but Trinity dumps the bag into the cement and then the two commence to struggle over the shovel in Trinitys hands.  Dex wins, whacks Trinity in the head and he goes down.  Now, certainly this is a moment with not a lot of time to spare, but certainly a few seconds for a couple more good whacks to make sure Trinity is done for; or a slit with the shovel edge against a jugular so the bag can be pulled out without Trinitys interference.  But Dex gives one whack, then turns toward the sinking bag and here is the kicker: the serial-killer manual 101 says than when engaged in hand-to-hand life-and-death struggle with another experienced serial-killer you don't let him out of your sight unless hes dead or permanently disabled.  But Dex simply turns his back on Trinity and 

Well, folks, the writers started to shut down and call it quits in Season 4.  Between Goodwill, Amazon and E-bay I managed to buy Seasons 1-5 for under $24.00 (shipping included) but its 50-50 whether Season 5 will ever get watched.  By the way, Showtime must have produced the DVDs on a shoestring.  The only one with subtitles was my sole Blu-ray purchase, Season 3; and both Season 3 and Season 4 begin with mandatory inescapable Showtime advertisements.",1457654400,,6301,4.6161434977578475

3956724,5,B002N5N5M0,"Dexter Season 4 brings to life new characters and enhances the existing characters.  In particular Sergeant Batista and Lieutenant LaGuerta enhance their relationship and become married.

The overarching story arch in this season starts with the return of now retired Special Agent Lundy.  He is looking for the ""Trinity"" killer-an elusive serial killer who enacts a highly ritualized series of slaughters consisting of a young woman bleeding to death in a bathtub, a mother of two jumping to her death, and a man getting bludgeoned to death.  It turns out that Author Mitchell (John Lithgow), a respected teacher, deacon, community leader, family man, and charity organizer is the killer.  He is re-enacting a family disaster from his childhood.  The Trinity Killer is the first time the main, antagonistic ""super-villain"" got no sympathy from this reviewer.  The others had some great human qualities, Lithgow's excellent portrayal of the deranged man was perfectly designed to bring disgust.

Suffice to say, Dexter is successful in dispatching his foe, but at a terrible cost.  As the season wraps up, the episodes become richer, more intense, and far more creatively written.",1428364800,,1180,5.301075268817204

The whole thing with him messing up from being so tired (someone tell his wife Dex has an important job and she needs to get up for the baby once in awhile so he can sleep) is lame.  This could be a 4 star season - but only if you 1. fast forward through all the drawn out baby scenes 2. fast forward through the foul mouthed F-bomb dropping Debra - why couldn't they just have killed her in season 1, she can't act at all and the whole cursing thing is beyond old and unnecessary.

She is so horrible!! Her mouth is so beyond realistic and tries way to hard to be ""tuff"" and destroys the show. She needs to get off the crack pipe and eat a brownie or something.

It is not long before his two lives catches up with him. The resultant fallout affects his job at Miami Metro Police and his domestic life. His wife Rita is none too happy when he appears to be lying to her, including keeping his old Batchelor condo.

His colleagues are investigating the ""Vacation Murders"" with the help of investigative journalist Christine Hill, and now, retired FBI Special Agent Frank Lundy appears on the scene pursuing the case of the ""Trinity Killer"", a person that kills three people in the same city once each year and in a specific order: one young woman killed in a bathtub, a mother killed by falling to her death, and a father clubbed to death. As the ensuing narrative unfolds we find that those close to Dexter are shot and that the Trinity Killer will challenge Dexter's skills to the limit. For me this was another great season for the overall show.",1389657600,,1045,4.679347826086956

3957129,4,B002N5N5M0,I have got to say I am not at all disappointed in the season. Writing and acting continue to be strong. Story and plot are way different that in the first season and we find Dexter in new territory with wife and children. But of course that doesn't stop him from engaging in his favorite night time activity. There is always a twist in the story and it kept me on my toes. I love it.

3957134,5,B002N5N5M0,"For a law-and-order aficionado who works peripherally with the legal system, Dexter is such a refreshing fantasy - evil people who game the legal avenues of justice still get taken down; the good guys mostly win. In between, there's plenty of character development and angst to keep each dire situation different enough not to feel cookie-cutter. It seems more real to have a hero/anti-hero who may be cleaning up the bad people, but not in a way all the good people would condone - conflicted emotions create interesting theater. Most of us wouldn't have it in us to actually hunt down evil and kill it, so in a fantasy world where (thus far) Dexter doesn't face the ultimate consequences, we can cheer him on as a surrogate to the dark feelings inside that we don't like to admit to.",1384473600,,785,4.654676258992806

3957221,5,B002N5N5M0,"When you think about it, how do you make the character of a serial killer likable?  Well, you really can't.  But somehow the writers of this show managed to let us know how much pain/anger Dexter feels with his ""Dark Passenger"" and how hard it is for Dexter to try to fit in with normal people. He thinks buying donuts should solve his problem. He suffers, that's why we allow ourselves to watch him every week.  I'm sorry that this will be the last season.  I am recording all episodes and plan to have a farewell to Dexter watching fest. I sincerely hope they don't kill off Dexter.

3957248,5,B002N5N5M0,"Who ever thought that Showtime would end up commissioning what, at least to me, is pretty much the best TV show in decades ... watching Dexter is an extraordinary experience: in technical terms it is exemplary - from the music to the lighting, it's obvious the producers have put a stellar team together.

Season 4 is my favourite season so far. I have to admit I'm slightly bemused that some viewers have been surprised by John Lithgow's performance. I know that in more recent times he's become associated with a sitcom character. However, even the most perfunctory look at his career reveals his capacity to inhabit dark characters, and in this season he really does provide the darkest of counterparts to Dexter's own dark traveller.

And this is what, at least for me, makes season 4 stand out. The parallel families spell out in no uncertain terms what happens to a cultural dream once it becomes infected by incurable dysfunctionalism. Thus we get to witness a hilarious encounter with neighbourhood vigilanteism, itself implicitly compared to charitable acts (a subtle comparison - no sledgehammer moralising here); two different but intimately entwinned attempts to reconcile traumatic family histories with contemporary family life; a fascinating exploration of the idea of self and social control ... it is these comparisons/juxtapositions that drive the narrative. Had it been the other way around, the writers would probably have ended up with a pretty artificial, forced narrative. But because Dexter remains driven by its characters, even the most outlandish situations retain plausibility.",1369440000,,1605,5.290196078431372
3957259,5,B002N5N5M0,I am a new fan of Dexter's...just started watching the shows.  I started back at Season 1 and am working my way up.  Love Michael C Hall...and all the characters.

""No, Dexter, just Dexter."" Was the response. Think more adult. I shook my head no and said what's it about? My co-worker gave me a quick run down and i said I'd check it out. So check it out I did. I was hooked. I then got my 23 yr old son watching Dexter. It is amazing watching as he works to 'fit in'.

3957287,4,B002N5N5M0,"This is my first four star rating of the tv show Dexter because of certain things within this season of Dexter.  The main issue being the ending to the season...you'll have to buy it to see what I mean. But like my other reviews of Dexter tv show I will give you fans main highlights of the season.  Dexter is now a father and the personal life, marriage life is affecting his work life.  He is feeling the need to want to kill again but can't seem to find a good victim to kill, plus we have the police force trying to solve so much at one time detracts from the storyline.  This season the police force has to main cases to solve ""the vaction murders"" and what detective Lundy from season two is back trying to get the person known as ""The Trinity Killer.""  Dexter tries to get closer to the person actor playing Trinity in order to kill him.  But as Dexter gets to know him he realizes he is just like him, stress gets to him and ends up killing an innocent man. A few episodes seem to drag on but still added to some of the storyline but seem forced, also Dexter wants to kill Trinity himself so misleads the police until police really find out who The Trinity killer real name is.  But like most season we already know Dexter gets his man and dumps him in ocean, so you have to watch this season to see what I am talking about.  But one big spolier Debra finds out who Dexter boligical mother is and what his real name was before Harry took him in.  Lara Moser, which she figure out his brother was Byran Moser from season one the Ice Truck Murder.",1364515200,,1553,4.184563758389261

Now I am patiently waiting, for Season 7.  Michael has captured many of my friends and sibling, that we buy seasons for each other and trade off the ones we have already watched, and turn someone else on to so that they too can see what I am talking about.  Michael makes the show so interesting and so OUTLANDISH, and still the reason for what he is doing is a true blessing to the society.  It's a series but a series you can't hate, or be sick or mad at, it makes you love the character all that much more, that you love to watch because it captures your whole inner self! Yes, it is just a TV series, but not too many can match the energy Michael and the cast members, gives out to their true fans!

I'm only scoring it down one star because the simpletons who recorded this season to disc start with a blaring Showtime ad about how ""You're...always in control"", yet prohibit skipping the section, prohibit fast forward, and prohibit hitting menu...all on the disc I paid them for.  I'm in control.  Right.

Also, they set up the chapter breaks so that the prior episode review, the credits AND the first segment of the episode are all in one chapter.  This means the buyer cannot simply hit next chapter to skip the review or the credits.  I have to fast forward past all of that and watch for the beginning of the show.

I completely understand that all of these complaints are truly trivial in the face of such an excellent show.  Still.  If they bothered to structure the recording better, they'd have that last star from me.",1359849600,,955,4.779141104294479

  Dexter
Dexter is a blood splatter expert who works for Miami Metro police department. During the night Dexter takes on the role of a serial killer. Dexter is different from other serial killers because he kills people who have done something wrong. Dexter wants to make Miami a safe place to live in so he eliminates the people who are disrupting the peace. In each season of Dexter there is a different killer that Dexter tries to hunt down. Dexter stands out from all the other TV shows because the character plays such conflicting roles.

The acting in Dexter is what makes the show so great. Michael C. Hall does a great job playing the role of Dexter. It amazes me how in the TV show Six Feet Under he plays the role of a gay guy and in Dexter he takes on the role of a serial killer. Playing the role of a gay guy in one TV show, and then a serial killer in another are two-way different types personalities Michael takes on. Dexter's sister Deb is played by Jennifer Carpenter. When I first watched the show I had no idea that they were married in real life. They apparently broke up in 2010 and finalized their divorce in December of 2011. In Dexter they are very close to each other and they do a great job of putting their relationship struggles aside and making the show the best it can be. To me it would seem hard for two people, who had split up to be able to do such a good acting job when around one another, Their performances are what make Dexter so good.

One of the things that really make me like Dexter is that it is very interesting and I always want to see what happens next. There is rarely ever a boring episode and I never can only watch one episode without wanting to watch another. Since I like crime scene movies and tv shows, Dexter is perfect for me. I am taking forensics in high school because I find it very interesting. When I go to college I might major in criminal justice because I like to solve crimes. Dexter's unique ways of solving cases is mind blowing. Your always left wondering what he will do next. There really isn't anything I dislike about Dexter. Dexter is one of my favorite tv shows of all time. There haven't been any bad episodes after 6 seasons. The only thing I can possibly think of is it sometimes takes a while to get down to the main point.

In each season Dexter has to hunt down a different serial killer. My favorite season out of the six so far is the fourth season. This season is by far the best season because Dexter tries to hunt down a serial killer. The serial killer is a guy named Arthur Mitchell. Arthur Mitchell has a unique name the ""trinity killer"" because he always murders three people in a very specific sequence. Mitchell first starts with a young woman in a bathtub, then he focuses on an older mother of two falling to her death, and finally he ends with a father of two bludgeoned to death. Later on in the season Dexter finds out that Trinity's pattern begins with the abduction and murder of a ten-year-old boy. Dexter realizes with this information that Trinity's pattern consists of four victims instead of three. The season is full of surprises and shocking moments. If you want to know what happens in the end then you are going to have to watch it yourself.

Dexter can be compared to tv shows like CSI, Law and Order, CSI Miami, CSI New York, NCIS, and more. Dexter can compare to these tv shows because they all deal with crime scene investigation and mystery. All these shows are about finding out who is responsible for the killing of a victim. The one thing that makes Dexter different and better is that in Dexter there is a character that takes on the role of a forensic analyst and a serial killer. None of the other shows that I listed have this unique twist to it and this is what makes Dexter stand out.

I would recommend Dexter to those who like crime scene tv shows. Dexter is all about crime scenes being solved and it is one of the best crime scene tv shows of all time in my opinion. Dexter can get graphic at times so beware before watching. Peter actually recommended this show to me and at first I was like it probably isn't that good, but when I sat down to watch it I was just amazed by the quality of the tv show. Even if you don't like crime scene tv shows I would still recommend that you watch it because you might end up actually liking it. I would give Dexter a 9.5 out of 10 for the amazing acting and just the overall quality of the show.",1354579200,,4492,4.308875739644971

3957416,5,B002N5N5M0,I loved this season of Dexter the most.  Lithgow was marvelous and the writers really outdid themselves.  A must see!,1354233600,,117,4.8
3957417,5,B002N5N5M0,"Baby Harrison has entered Dexter and Rita's lives. And with it, the accompanying nappies, feedings and sleep deprivation. For a serial killer like Dexter, this is a recipe for disaster. Yet he tries to satiate both his Dark Passenger and his familial and work-related commitments. His top priority at the season's outset is to sleep, not abduct, slaughter and dispose of his latest victim.

Disaster strikes as he heads home after a ""project"" leading to a road accident at the end of the first episode. He has no memory of what happened to his victim's body. His only cause for relief is that the police didn't find it near the wreckage.

Lundy returns to hunt a serial killer, a 30-year veteran he has dubbed ""Trinity"", after the pattern of murders he leaves behind. Lundy later tells Deb that this is the only way he can relax. In a nutshell, he is a high-functioning psychopath who has channeled his lack of emotion and calm demeanour towards a productive and socially beneficial aim.

Dexter finds Trinity, but there is more to this killer and his Dark Passenger than simply ritual. Season 4's climax builds over several episodes, and when you think it has finally arrived, you are once again reminded that there are twelve episodes in total, and there are still four left.

There are a few segments that slow down the breakneck pace of the season, but they are few and far between. The final scene will leave you too terrified to sleep or ***** for several days (spoiler omitted).",1354233600,,1485,4.722007722007722

Sorta like Dirty Harry, but with intelligence and stealth, minus the bang bang boombady...of Harry.

However, Dexter still has ""special needs"" but much less time to take care of them.  This causes problems with Rita as some things cannot be explained.

John Lithgow plays Trinity the most successful serial killer ever encountered.  This is a complex and freighting look at a monster passing as normal.
Dexter determined to kill Trinity is fascinated by his lifestyle while questioning how much danger he represents for his family.
Trinity and another kill, create more questions as they heighten his fear.  The interplay between Trinity and Dexter is great fun to watch.
Two fine actors create a believable relationship based on complex personas with similar needs.

There is major character development in this season as Debra, LaGuerta, Batista and others become more of real people and less of plot devices.
Dexter's family life is a second but important storyline that cannot be ignored.  The marriage is having problems due to Dexter's ""special needs"".

I highly recommend this season box set!,1342310400,,326,4.45
3957535,3,B002N5N5M0,"The fact of the matter is that if you are looking at this product you already like Dexter and have probably already seen this season.  If I had to review the content, I would place this was the second best season with Season 5 being my personal favorite.  If you like Dexter, but have not yet seen this season, I can say you will like this season.  As usual John Lithgow does whatever it is that he does that makes everything automatically better.

That said, I still rated this a 3 because the the product itself, the discs (in my case the bluray set), contains the unacceptable practice of forcing you to watch an EXTENDED commercial when you start playback of a disc and this commercial  cannot be skipped or fast-forwarded.  This commercial consists of every piece of programming on Showtime!  I did not buy this box set so that I could watch a commercial: and I certainly didn't buy Dexter Season 4 so that I could sit through an extended commercial consisting of segments for the product I have just bought.  If you could skip over it that would make it tolerable, but for the next, FF, and menu button to be disabled is thoroughly unacceptable to the point I wished to see the disc's authors meeting Dexter while held down with saranwrap.

If you are considering getting this series on disc for your permanent library I would recommend waiting until after the series wraps up to see if a complete series box set would correct this issue.  If you are buying it because you want to see the episodes I would recommend renting them instead.  Just put the disc in and go to the bathroom, cook a snack, or mow your lawn while the commercial plays.

My trouble sits with two issues. For one, not nearly enough bad-guy killing, and it's not even so Dexter can find himself this time.

The main issue I have is with the whole Rita fighting with Dexter. It feels like the producers are trying to force their marriage to fall apart. The arguments are weak, the conflict feels forced, and it's just stupid.

Honestly, I stopped watching it after four episodes because the acting on Julie Benz's was not convincing at all.

Also, the Batista x LaGuerta thing is annoying, but the former does a decent job with making it feel important.

All in all, the romance sucks and lacks emotion, and there's not even any action to make up for it. Just... lots and lots and lots of crappy romance.",1332633600,,895,4.67515923566879

How amazing is that?

All that aside, I never thought I'd be rooting for a serial killer. But I am. Dexter is a complex, well-written character. After watching the first season (over two days, constantly) I couldn't wait for the next. In retrospect, I must say I thought the series foundered a bit in the third season. But the fourth season? Oh my! The season finale made me gasp---it was a perfect ending and cleared the way for a broader range of action in the fifth. And yes, I've got that one, too.

3957583,5,B002N5N5M0,"If you've only ever experienced John Lithgow being all jovial in 3RD ROCK FROM THE SUN - if you missed what he brought in, say, RICOCHET or RAISING CAIN - then you may be gobsmacked when you see his stint on DEXTER, when his twisted side came out to play. John Lithgow is the reason why the 4th season of DEXTER is universally regarded as the best one so far in the series. Of course, Michael C. Hall, who plays Dexter, isn't exactly just twiddling his thumbs, either.

Season 4 catches us up to our charming and newly married serial killer Dexter Morgan, raising three kids and having relocated to a suburban paradise so perfect there've been sightings of the Stepford wives. Dexter is now absolutely living the dream, and never mind that his spanking new baby is keeping him up nights, is affecting his job performance as blood spatter analyst for Miami Metro PD. Even more intriguingly, it's upended the routines of his dark calling. Dexter has been off his game, hasn't put down a serial killer in a while. In fact, Season 4's first episode amusingly plays off the opening credits sequence to demonstrate just how off his game he is. And when he finally gets back to his killing ways, he is so sleep-deprived that he loses track of where he stashed the corpse (or its hacked up bits, anyway). It's a lot of fun seeing Dexter, usually so meticulous and in control, running around in a full-scale panic.

Season 4 finds Dexter in a collision course with the Trinity Killer, him what kills in threes. Keith Carradine returns, with his Henry Fonda-esque delivery, as now retired FBI profiler Frank Lundy who is in Miami to partly renew acquaintances with Detective Debra Morgan but mostly to pursue his pet project: tracking down the Trinity Killer, the only serial killer to have eluded him (of course, Dexter two seasons ago also eluded Lundy). Lundy's investigations lead him to believe that the Trinity Killer had been secretly plying his craft for 30 years, making him officially the most successful serial killer to not be caught, a revelation which awes Dexter.

This is the most harrowing season yet. There's a parallel investigation that goes on for most of this season, revolving around a rash of tourist murders, but that's just icing on the cake. It's mostly all about Dexter's interactions with Trinity, and Michael C. Hall and Lithgow do their characters justice (but Jennifer Carpenter also again kills it with her terrific performance). John Lithgow won a Golden Globe and an Emmy for his role of the tormented Trinity Killer. This time out, the show does a sort of reverse presentation of its season's big bad. From jump we see Lithgow's character for the vile creature that he is. In Season 4's opening episode, ""Living the Dream,"" we see the Trinity Killer at work and he, in the first few minutes, does something which the Skinner and Jimmy Smits from the previous season were never able to do. Trinity scared the sh_- out of me. Further episodes proceed to layer in his personality, presents us his cover, how he's managed to blend in for decades. You can see why Dexter, whose own Dark Passenger renders him severely alienated from normal society, is fascinated with Trinity, why he'd want to study him. Dexter's inability to immediately dispatch Trinity will cost him dearly. I can't describe the chills that raced up and down my spine when Trinity finally figured out Dexter's true identity, when he confronted our guy. From his lips, a greeting like ""Hello, Dexter Morgan."" has never sounded more menacing. Season 4, a watershed year, leaves us horrified but oh so riveted and so fascinated. Maybe it's not only Dexter Morgan who harbors these dark cravings.",1325894400,,3683,4.787735849056604
3957584,4,B002N5N5M0,"I can't get enough of DEXTER and Season Four was no disappointment. It seems like each season gets more and more intense as Dexter continues his killing spree while trying not to get caught. This season we are introduced to the Trinity Killer played with relish by the remarkable John Lithgow. The first killing was so gruesome and unexpected. The serial killing aspect eventually gives way to a psychological thriller. We begin to get into the minds of kindred souls Dexter and the Trinity Killer.

Both men kill for different reasons and with different rules. We soon learn that the Trinity Killer is not the expected loner. There is much much more and Dexter begins to dig deeper. As Miami Homicide comes closer to finding the Trinity Killer, Dexter has to think of ways to throw them off the trail. He'll go to any lengths to keep the Trinity Killer to himself with very tragic results.

John Lithgow shows his amazing acting skills as the episodes progress. The writing this season continues to impress as Dexter maneuvers his way out of one jam after another. He is always one step away from getting caught. Luck always seems to be on his side but how long can this luck last?

Rita's relationship with Dexter becomes more and more tense as he is always away from home. Dexter begins to realize how important his family is to him. He finally experiences true feelings. Dexter's rules come in to question when it appears he kills an innocent man. The drama and excitement never ends with Dexter.

Season Four ends with one of the most unexpected and shocking finales I have ever seen. Dexter's life comes full circle. The show totally amazes me with its character development and it becomes stronger in these season and we dig deeper into the psyche of Dexter and the Trinity Killer.

3957624,3,B002N5N5M0,"SPOILERS BELOW.

This season really dissapointed me, although I understand the producers of a successfull show are always ina kind of CATCH 22 situation: if they keep the formula the same, hey risk that people say the show is always the same, no edge, etc. If they change it, people complain they changed it...

So, that said, the producers had courage to change the tonality of the show, but it unfortunately backfired. Why?

CONS:
a. Dexter simply is not Dexter anymore. He killed murderers that escaped the law. Now, with the proofs he had, he could easily have sent the police after Trinity and end the case. No. He decided he simply got to kill Trinity himself.

b. The love plot with Batista and Angela is utterless boring, unconvinving, trite.

c. Why on Earth the producers think it's the coolest thing in the world to have a character (Debra) whose main characteristic is to say the ""f"" word every time? It got boring.

d. Quinn is going nowhere.

e. The ending was atrocious, implausible, full of plot holes. To kill Rita (which was annoying, by the way, saying ""Family is important"" with mellow eyes about a hundred times per episode!) was shcok just for the sake of shock, not to advance plot or get new viewers. And it was unplausible. TRinity only got the chance to get her because she came back to get something for her son Harrison (as shown in the cell phone message). Trinity also would have had to work a lot faster than his previous crimes. All in all, it just doesn't fit.

PROS:
Leading actor Hall continues to do a splendid job.",1312934400,,1551,4.574007220216607
3957625,5,B002N5N5M0,"The show Dexter hit yet another peak with Season 4. This season was special to me for many reasons, the first one being that this was the first season of Dexter that I watched on Showtime as the episodes were orginally aired. I had just read the first three Dexter novels and saw the first three seasons before watching Season 4, so I was completely into this show at the time. And man, did Season 4 not disappoint at all! After slipping just a wee bit with Season 3 (which nonetheless still had great writing and a terrific season finale), Dexter more than righted itself with Season 4....and how!! And what a brilliant idea, bringing in John Lithgow as the Trinity Killer. Lithgow is perfect in this role....I don't think he has ever been better, which is saying a lot. His character has many levels and Lithgow plays all of them perfectly. Nice to see the return of FBI agent Lundy, as well.

The writing for this season is brilliant and the actors more than rise to the material. For the main cast, I am the most impressed with Jennifer Carpenter as Debra Morgan. She has developed in major leaps and bounds as an actress since season 1. There is one scene ( I believe in episode 5, 6 or 7) where her character breaks down and cries in front of Dexter that I think has some of the best acting of her career. I can never watch this scene without getting teary eyed! There are some very interesting sub-plots, the main one...which maybe really isn't a sub-plot...being Dexter getting adjusted to married life and having a baby, which makes sleeping more of a challenge for him. I also like the rising tension between Dexter and Quinn. The one sub-plot that I was not completely crazy about was the romance between Laguerta and Batista, which gets even more awkward during season 5. And Rita does get a bit annoying during the season, that is until the last three or four episodes, where the Rita that I came to know and love during the first few seasons comes back. But those are about the only negative things I have to say about this season.

As I said before, the writing is brilliant and the acting (particularly by John Lithgow, Michael C. Hall and Jennifer Carpenter) is stellar. This is such an intense and chilling season! And the show still retains it's dark humour. There is one episode where we get to hear what type of music some of the characters listen to and the biggest surprise is Masuka's choice of music. And yes, Masuka...he is his usual hilarious and loveable self here, but also reveals from time to time a kind of sweetness and sensitivity that helps to flesh his character out more. I don't think I have ever liked him as much as I do (did) during this season. And how could you not love that laugh of his?

Beware the season finale and don't let anybody tell you what happens during it if you don't know already. All I can say is that I was completely blown away by it and was also completely surprised and shocked, which I hope doesn't give away anything! Just brace yourself.....

I cannot recommend this season enough, really....",1312070400,,3059,4.506306306306306

This season's bad guy was sheer genius as well, first for being cast, as well as his acting (which is no great surprise - he's just amazing). His first scene involves no dialogue at all, and is absolutely chilling.

I can't recommend this season highly enough. But if you haven't experienced Dexter before, do yourself a favor. Start from Season 1 and watch them all in order.

In this light, Dexter is a metaphor for the average male, faced with conflicting feelings about his membership in the highly constraining family unit. Babies, for instance: on the pro side, they're cute and they give you a mission; on the con side, they cry at night and they have needs. And neighbors, what are they for? In the early episodes there are some hilarious scenes of our guy struggling to fit into this de facto club of supposed ""buddies"".

Season 4 explores the joys and stresses of married life, asking whether a man needs his private space, a desert island he can escape to. Is this in conflict with his duties to his family, or is it precisely what gives him the peace of mind necessary to be at least partly available to them? From the feminine point of view, total disclosure may be necessary for love to survive. Rita is a firm believer in honesty, but the series frames her requirement as a potentially dangerous demand for the key to Bluebeard's forbidden room. The writers stack the odds against our sympathy for Rita: she treats Dexter as being on-call 24/7, stretching his sanity at certain points, yet ultimately our hero is allowed to discover how much his family defines who he now is.

The process is helped by a running comparison with another husband figure, the Trinity killer, whom Dexter looks to at least partially for mentorship (a theme used to lesser effect in Season 3). This character, played by a magisterial John Lithgow, gives a density to Season 4 which sets it apart from any previous one. For the first time we follow a killer very closely through most of the season, and the portrait of psychological illness is fleshed out and convincing, troubling in a way we haven't seen before.

As for the subplots: the love lives of secondary characters don't always add much to the narrative, but the thoughtful treatment of Deb's story makes her a deeper, more interesting character, and Jennifer Carpenter rises to the challenge. C.S. Lee as Masuka skillfully plays off the contradictions in his character, and Julie Benz as Rita is always pitch-perfect, remaining touching in an often thankless role where her needs, however legitimate, are on the verge of driving Dexter off the deep end.

But the season really rests on the gripping Dexter-Trinity pair. The darkness puts the viewer under a lot of tension, but it's probably the smartest season so far.",1306454400,,2450,4.798578199052133
3957635,1,B002N5N5M0,"I was an avid Dexter fan because its a great premise, a serial killer who only kills those who deserve it.  Now why did I rate it so low? I will try to elaborate without any spoilers. The greatest curse of this series is the extremely high expectations it has set for itself.  Season 1,2 and 3 were very well written, really fleshing out the great cast of characters.  Amazingly, IMO there really isn't a bad episode in the bunch, there are bad scenes, but mostly the episodes were very well done and kept you on the edge of your seats.  Season 4 is where you start to see some cracks.  Slowly the show you love, is devolving into a mess. The first half of season 4 is fine, but from there to the shocking season finale, it all down hill, with the season finale being especially disappointing (many with probably disagree, but just my two cents). A Major plot twist and you are left wondering where the writers are going with season 5.  Sufficed to say they weren't going anywhere interesting with the twist.  IF they made changes to the plot to further the series in new and interesting ways then, great idea.  However, this changes seems to be done just for the sake of change.  Too bad, season 5 is only a shadow of what Dexter was. Made it to episode 6 and stopped watching.  I don't watch TV often if at all, very rarely, do I invest in a TV series, but with Dexter I was hooked. Season 1-3 is some of the best work I have seen on TV or in film, I would suggest not ruining a good thing and stopping after season 3.",1306022400,6,1520,4.228373702422146

The season's main plotline, featuring John Lithgow as a chilling and gripping antagonist, is excellent stuff. However, the season is a bit dragged down with some of the side plotlines. The Batista/LaGuerta plot in particular seems out of nowhere and pointless, as is some of the Dexter's new family stuff. The return of Keith Carradine was totally welcome, and overall I'd call this a strong season that managed to really pull me in spite of a few minor annoyances.

3957677,5,B002N5N5M0,"Michael C. Hall may play other roles over the rest of his career, but he's never going to escape the idea that he is Dexter, South Florida's favorite serial killer.  Through four seasons, Hall and the ""Dexter"" team have created some of the most entertaining guilty-pleasure TV this side of ""Deadwood.""

Season Four finds Dexter in a good place . . . at first.  The domestic content Dexter found at the end of Season Three by marrying the gorgeous Rita (Julie Benz) and assuming the role of father can only last so long.  Balancing a serial killer's existence with a job in law enforcement is one thing, but living with four new and demanding family members full time in suburbia can just plain cramp your style if you're looking to get out and murder someone.  Season Four finds plenty of dark comic relief for Dexter as he juggles his new roles with his old desires.

Thankfully, this is only a sidelight to the main plot of the season, which is the arrival of a new serial killer on the Miami scene - the Trinity Killer (John Lithgow).  Or perhaps, the re-arrival is more appropriate, as TK has been ""working"" for decades.  Nobody is happier to have Lithgow working in South Florida again than Dexter's foul-mouthed sister Debra (Jennifer Carpenter), as TK has long been hunted by FBI Special Agent Frank Lundy (Keith Carradine), her old flame.  Lundy has tracked TK for decades, believing that he has mastered TK's chilling habit of killing in threes all across the nation.

It is only a matter of time before Dexter and TK cross paths, but not as you might expect.  Lithgow, among the most charming of actors, gets downright evil in this role and serves as a diabolical foe for Dexter.

This season has everything a ""Dexter"" fan can hope for - lots of blood, lots of sex, lots of witty, dark humor.  Just when everything seems too dark, the writers bring in comic relief to keep things balanced (Matsuka gets a lot of his trademark goofy lines - classic stuff).

Again, you cannot start ""Dexter"" with Season Four, even though you'll get the rhythm of the show very quickly.  There is a lot of backstory in play in this season, and if you haven't watched the first three seasons a lot of this season won't resonate.

But if you have seen the first three seasons, the fourth is a pure pleasure, right up to the shocking final minute. Check it out.",1298592000,,2349,4.570405727923628

But eventually, I had some spare cash and some free time to give it a go.  So I picked up a copy and my husband and I settled down this past weekend to give it a go.

All I can say is that it was fantastic!  I loved every minute of it, and the ending was utterly stunning and I was at the edge of my seat throughout the whole thing.  Definitely restored my faith in Dexter---it's just a shame I heard season 5 is a letdown.

This one definitely deserves five stars.  There is not a negative thing I can think to say about it.  If you felt letdown by seasons one or two, or even if you've enjoyed every season of Dexter equally as much, you'll definitely not be dissapointed by this one.",1297641600,,953,4.102702702702703

3957682,5,B002N5N5M0,"What a good job of raising a kid, giving him direction and morals, rules and standards.  Really.  If you have a child that demonstrates any type of pathology, one that simply cannot be avoided, then at least find a way to lessen its actual degree of evil.  In this case, you either kill your own child (Dexter) or do what Dexter's father did.  His father recognized Dexter's proclivities as being inexorable and potentially dangerous to all.  So raise him up right, I say, if you are a father that is going to let your son live at all.  Do it right? How?  Dexter was going to kill people without a doubt.  That being the absolute then at least his father teaches him to kill only bad people.  Of course, already Dexter has screwed up, killing the wrong guy, and he might have done it before and will probably get it wrong again down the road, but at least he was taught well.  A few mistakes are acceptable in anyone's life's work, right?  It happens to all of us, right?  Would we rather Dexter has no direction?  Would killing randoms be OK?  No, his father saw the deal with which Dexter was faced and pointed him in the direction which was the path least offensive, more socially acceptable, though still not being so publicly, yet more acceptable than no direction, purpose or goal at all, right?  Either teach your kid to kill only bad people, since killing people was inevitable, unavoidable and absolutely going to happen, or eliminate him (Dexter) from the face of the earth.  From a father's point of view it was obviously a difficult problem to solve, but if allowing his son to live then the father might as well mold and encourage the vigilante aspect, a characteristic or tendency, a hidden wish-they (I, we, you)-could do/be that crosses the mind of almost every average person.  Throughout all literature, be it in books, movies, plays or all types of story relating media, the vigilante who would carries out the, ""righteous kill"", for and on behalf of society has always been lauded for having the guts to do what you and I can't.  ""Righteous killing"", is seen in many instances where the law seems to have failed.  It has been touted as an almost appropriate and socially acceptable way to solve a system error and is a societal problem solving method most of us accept, being just glad ""it is over"", the murdering SOB being finally dead, not caring who did it or how.  In the movies this kind of justice is always performed outside the law yet inside the bounds of morally correct action.  Is this not so?  To some, Dexter is the hero of an impotent system and broken society that for some reason cannot get rid of those reprobates that should be gotten rid of.  Society has unofficially made a judgment and Dexter is the executioner for the people, of the people and by the people.  Oh my gad, it is funny!  Funny or not, Dexter, the disciplined and well taught psychopath, is the Zorro we all need and secretly want around to solve certain serious problems that our established institutions cannot.  Sounds like I agree with what Dexter does, right?  I do not, of course, personally, but it makes the premise of the TV Series tenable and acceptable on top of being very, very dark hilarity at its best. We, the facile, the squeamish never want to actually see how it is done.  That is our hypocrisy. We still want it done.",1297382400,,3344,4.556113902847571

3957684,4,B002N5N5M0,"For all of its dark humor, irony, blood and edginess, Dexter has always been driven by its characters.  Each of the major players in this fantastic series comes complete with richly developed personas, mixed motives and conflicting emotions.  Perhaps none more so than Dexter himself who has evolved (in his own eyes as well as in the audience's) from a souless sociopath to a complex human being with the capability to view the world in shades of grey and to consider the possibility that he may not be as much of a monster as he once thought.  Season 4, which may be the best so far, explores the many facets of Dexter's ever changing personality and also provides some possible foreshadowing as to what fate lies in store for he and his family.

Dexter is juggling several different roles as things pick up.  He is newly married and a father to boot.  He quickly finds that carrying out these duties severely interferes with the needs of his dark passenger.  In one subplot, he gets very sloppy following a kill due to sleep deprivation.  He finds himself wondering if it is possible for him to continue having a family while also feeding his bloodlust.  That's where The Trinity Killer comes in to play.  Portrayed by John Lithgow in a superb performance that earned him an Emmy and a Golden Globe, Trinity is a mirror image of Dexter.  He maintains a seemingly picture perfect family and community life as a cover for his heinous murders.  Dexter is fascinated by his ability to maintain his facade so effortlessly.  Instead of doing away with Trinity early on, Dexter incorporates himself into his life in an attempt to gain insights on how he can more effectively maintain his own public and private lives.  Needless to say, some serious cracks are revealed in the picture perfect world that Trinity has built which forces Dexter (and the audience) to accept the reality that it is not going to be possible for Dexter to maintain his own idyllic life forever.

Hall and Lithgow are both outstanding as the two men who are mirror images of one another and their cat and mouse game is the heart of season 4.  But the other characters figure prominently into the mix.  Deborah finds herself questioning her relationship with Antoine when FBI agent Frank Lundy returns to Miami, Quinn evolves from a self-absorbed jerk to a more complex individual and Angel and Maria become involved in a serious relationship.  As usaual, everyone is at the top of their game which helps elevate season 4 of this series to a brilliant series to new heights.  Bring on season 5.",1297123200,,2564,4.708520179372197

3957687,4,B002N5N5M0,"America's favorite serial killer good guy returns for another season and faces off against his most powerful adversary--the Trinity Killer (John Lithgow). Dexter needs a role model for balancing family and murder. He thinks he might have found it once he I.D.'s the Trinity Killer who seems to have it all just exactly as Dexter (Michael C. Hall) does.

Dexter suffers from exhaustion due his new baby and butts heads with Quinn. Special Agent Frank Lundey (Keith Carradine) returns now retired but he's trying to catch the one killer that got away--the Trinity Killer.

I rented the DVD before buying the Blu-ray. The Blu-ray is worth the extra coin if you plan on watching the series again as the imagine quality, detail and colors are all superior. For most folks though the DVD will do just fine.

The special features aren't exactly all that special. It's cross promotion time with episodes of ""Californication"", ""The Tudors"" and ""Lock 'n Load"" It seems that Showtime has been watching too many Universal TV show boxed sets.

If you're a fan of the show the special features won't matter all that much but it would have been nice if Showtime had taken the time to include some on the DVDs.

My only complaint is that the special features are only accessible via Blu-ray Live (or in the case of the DVD set on the internet) and include the second episode of the fourth season of ""The Tudors"" and interviews with the cast.

This remains one of the finest seasons of the show. I just wish that Showtime would put more effort into their Blu-rays and DVD special features. I'd give this season 4 1/2 stars overall as it rarely missed the mark but give the Blu-ray 4 stars and the DVD 4 because of the lack of special features.

While Dexter is in fact a serial killer, this show is about far more then the killing he does, In fact that is really for the most part a side note. There is a lot of character development and the writing is great. These are clever stories that leave you eagerly looking forward to the next. I've seen all four seasons now and I can't wait for season five to become available.
Dexter's story is a complex one and he struggles with what brought him to where he is. This show has a great cast who you come to care about pretty quickly.
You'll have to deal with strong language as well as the killings. But, if you can deal with the world as it actually is then you'll love Dexter.",1296259200,,864,4.088235294117647
3957703,3,B002N5N5M0,"Thankfully, the characters in Dexter held up season four. Alas, the writers seem to have lost the plot, rather literally. While this show has always relied on a certain suspension of reality to go with the flow of a very subversive character in Dexter, this season really fell off the edge. I don't know if the writers lost interest? Or running out of creative ways to make this story hold together? The whole seasons story line seemed rushed and ham handed. It felt like shock value over took any nuance to core story arcs. I'm not going to go into details of plot so as not to spoil this season for others who may want to draw their own conclusions. Ironically the season felt like many missed opportunities.  Most of the characters and plot lines were fun ideas that could fit with the dark sensibilities of this show. However, it felt like each of the story lines was not thought through and were rushed and sloppy in how things came or fit together. So many twists and change ups in characters and plots that rather than feeling like revealing shadow sides or more complexity to the show just felt contrived. I'm really surprised to see so many comments lauding the stories and developments this season as it felt clearly to me like the weakest story executions of all the seasons. The characters, including Trinity until the last couple episodes, compensated and it was fun to see them almost more fully embody the characters they have been playing for four years now. It would be nice to see the writers give more consideration to tighter writing of the storylines next season, though I don't have much expectations around this. As others have mentioned, it can be really difficult to keep the quality of these shows high after three of four seasons. Though shows like 'The Wire' and others can provide rays of hope for those of us who appreciate the subversive nature of Dexter.",1296259200,,1886,4.663663663663663

The drama intensity is here again, as it always is with the series, but this season holds more emotion than previously thought. There are moments where I as a viewer was shocked at the severity of Dexter's emotional commitment and involvement. He begins to understand and experience more emotions than in previous seasons. (protectiveness, jealousy, worry, and remorse hit him especially hard).

This series follows the hunt for the Trinity Killer, whom we meet and see in action from the outset. There is none of the second guessing who the killer could be this time, but for a variety of reasons this still manages to be as tense as other series' and is even more tense than series 3.

Frank Lundy makes an appearance again as now retired FBI agent who is tracking Trinity down and Dexter starts to learn from Trinity about the work/killer life balance he is struggling with.

Michael C Hall is as amazing as ever, John Lithgow (as Trinity, don't worry that info doesn't ruin anything) is an inspired choice and he gives the right mix of menace and instability that the character needs. Even better, Jennifer Carpenter, who plays Deb, is actually very good and it may have taken her 4 series to hit her stride but I could watch her without cringing this time.

The story is outstanding and I finished this completely shocked, lets just say the ending is excellent. I can't wait for series 5 to find out more.

The extras are pretty good as well with interviews, commentaries and featurettes on the blood and props in the series.

3957734,5,B002N5N5M0,"Now, I felt the need to write this review for season four because it wasn't just so freakin' good (I mean, it really really was) but because out of all five seasons, season four is by far the best season (so far). Many people point out the plots, but no ones mentioned why this season is more appealing then the other four. Like every season Dexter tackles the, ""Dark Passenger vs Human Self."" But what makes season four so interesting and exciting is the fact that Dexter is no longer asking himself, ""Can I keep up this cover?"" but ""How can I keep up this cover?"" Dexter, a serial killer/Blood Splatter Analyst, finally gets hitched. He has a baby, two step children and a brand new house in a brand new community. What made the premiere for season four so nail biting was the fact that Dexter--the guy who prefers to be alone and claims Rita and the kids are a cover--is committed to being a husband, father, and Cop (well not really, but he's got a badge) while pleasing his Dark Passenger. How the hell is he gonna juggle so many roles and keep his cool? First episode ends badly for the guy (you can't help but love him) and it really rains on his parade. That's why when the Trinity Killer comes into play, a serial killer so clean, and invisible that he's hardly ""real"", he can't help but be amazed and wonder how he does it. Through out the season we discover who this Trinity Killer is and how he effects Dexter.

Despite the other subplots and even Trinity's role (played by the fabulous John Lithgow), season four changes Dexter in many ways. As much as he claims marriage is a cover he can't deny he cares for his kids and Rita. We already knew this going into the season, but season four really draws out the nurturing caring person Dexter really is behind the Dark Passenger. For years Dexter has done everything to please his Dark Passenger just so he can function and seem, well, normal. But by the end of season four he comes to realize that he needs his family just as much as he needs to please the Dark Passenger. There's one line that really makes this point come to life. Dexter is chasing after the Trinity Killer and his phone rings. Dexter see's the ID--it's Rita. ""Don't answer it,"" says Dexter's dad (who's not really there and plays the Dark Passenger in him. Sorta). ""What if something wrong with the baby?"" Dexter replies while picking up the phone. At that moment the Dexter we met in season one, the calm, neat monster, is no longer identified by Dexter himself but as a loving father and husband. (Who just needs to kill to stay sane. :) )

Through out the season Dexter evolves, making him a more lovable serial killer then ever. He goes from, ""How can I keep up this cover?"" to ""How can I keep my family?"" And the best (saddest) part is, Dexter himself isn't aware of this change until the very end. Michael C Hall got a Globe for this season and he deserved it. I've never seen Dexter so tangled in himself and so ""Dark Passenger can wait."" I've never seen such a drastic change to our sweet serial killer--a change that gave us one of the best seasons of any show on television ever.",1292630400,,3121,4.407279029462738

3957751,5,B002N5N5M0,"Amazing fourth season. If I had to watch it all by itself and without knowing that something is coming next, I would say this season is by far the best because it is entirely, from beginning to end, a full cycle centering on one serial killer chased by Dexter and chasing Dexter. And that is excellent. The construction of this whole season is perfect and in the style of Stephen King's Dark Tower. The end is the beginning and the last scene can only bring Dexter back to his very first cry in his life and in the first episode of the first season. This closing of the cycle is so beautifully made that it would be the perfect ending for the saga, just like the last page of The Dark Tower is just the same as the first page of The Dark Tower. Life is the most beautiful thing there is to live in this world just because it is always the same, and yet always a new beginning. The sun rises every morning and the moon rises every evening, or nearly so. The variations are themselves cyclical. It is absolutely state of the art primeval pleasure. The serial killer behind this whole season is a cyclical man too, but a double cyclical killer who kills every so often along a cyclical need and always the very same cycle of victims in very set circumstances and very set time spans. The key to this season is that we all know about FBI profiling, so it becomes funny and stange when that profiling fails to be true and is in fact totally wrong. And this time twice again, because it is superficially wrong, the man is not a solitary cat that kills to satisfy his need to have human contact, but the alternative to which Dexter comes is also false because it is only an appearance. That serial killer is keeping appearances, to even kill better and more easily. The series also settles some accounts with the paparazzi, those fake journalists who gather any information and spill it around with no conscience whatsoever and without the slightest pang of conscience about the potential victims the people they expose become. And what if that nosy journalist were a killer herself? And the plot can sicken a little bit more when Rita kisses the neighbor. What a horrible thing to happen, and she is shocked when Dexter does not react the way she expects him to react, so that he has to do something about it, and apologize to the brutalized neighbor on the following morning I guess. This season also gives the dead father an ever more important role to play. He is Dexter's permanent and privileged interlocutor. Then the action is always as packed as usual, though Dexter does not buy donuts for his colleagues every morning as he used to. That's a shame. I liked that habit, but I guess everyone on the team has to watch their waist line and weight. They are getting old in other words. But be sure to get the fifth season, before cancer or his sister takes Dexter away and to find out if the last scene is a real scene or a nightmare. I have my idea about that but let you enjoy the suspense.

3957754,5,B002N5N5M0,"For me DEXTER is without a doubt the best show on television.  Its acting, writing, directing and producing are so above anything else on tv.  The mere fact that the main character is a serial killer we root for is the first thing to tell you how great the show is.  Episodes are shown and stories told all with the voice-over of Dexter, who is so expertly played by Michael C. Hall.  We hear all his feelings and thoughts as he chooses the actionsd he must take.  Through these voice-overs and flashbacks to his father we learn all about how he developed as a person and why he has such a difficult time with emotions and needs to take the actions he does.  This season is by far the best thus far.  We are introduced to the Trinity Killer, aka Arthur Mitchell, right away in the first episode.  This character is superbly played by John Lithgow and the cat and mouse game that takes place between the Trinity killer and Dexter is at the edge of your seat tv at its best.  Dexter puts himself into Arthur's personal life and the results are spellbinding.  All other main characters are fully fleshed out and loose no substancce while this major story line takes place.  Rita, Debra and all are given great plots as well.  This season is so full of twists and turns that to give away any more of the plot would be a sin for viewers who have not seen it.

And as for the blu ray.  Wow, wow, wow.  DEXTER is the only series that I buy on blu ray.  Many shows are now on blu ray but the quality is often not much better than that of the dvd.  With DEXTER it far surpasses the dvd and takes full advantage of all blu ray has to offer.  Much of the audio is front speaker driven but all audio works perfectly.  Dexter's voice-overs are strong and clear.  They possess a very haunting quality and you feel as if you are truly in Dexter's mind.  All music and action noise fully uses all other speakers for full effect.  Back speakers will often have you jumping out of your skin.  And the picture - if you love DEXTER you owe it to yourself to see it on blu ray.  Colors, clarity and black/white ratio are all amazing.  The Miami shots are so crystal clear.  Ripples in water, facial close-ups, everything is better than you can imagine.  This is blu ray video at its best.

DEXTER is a series that has definitely grown with each season.  Cable series have only 12 episodes and DEXTER manages to provide awe inspiring plots each season while character development never misses a step.  I highly recommend DEXTER, particularly on blu ray and particularly this season.  A +++",1290556800,,2567,4.375

After waiting with baited breath for each season of Dexter, season 4 was a disappointment.

The great strength in this show was in the writing and the character development. The writer's ability for us to have some empathy and understanding for the serial killer Dexter was what kept me watching. It felt wrong that we should have some sympathy for a heartless killer but we should not be too judgmental of Dexter because we all seem to have our flaws and perhaps even as suggested by the series - the devil inside.

I felt that the core tenet of our view of the Dexter character as someone with redeeming features, his rigid adherence to Harry's Code, was destroyed in this series. Dexter is always so precise and methodical in the stalk and kill, establishing conclusively his victim's guilt. However, Dexter takes little time in determining the photographer as a murderer and the writers did not give his detective colleagues the opportunity to investigate (and fail) before Dexter and the code are called into action. I think in the context of the series and Dexter's placement in Miami PD homicide the investigation of the eventual murderer should have been known to Dexter, but this information is only given by the writer's (the DNA and confession) after Dexter has killed the photographer.

The death of Dexter's previous ""innocent"" Oscar Prado in season 3 could be explained away by the don't get caught aspect of the code but the writer's spend so little time on Dexter's investigation into the photographer that we know priorities have changed. He loses any real purpose for those in the community around him. He is no longer a lonely killer on the margins of society killing for what he bizarrely believes is the public good; he is simply a lonely killer on the margins of society. It may be the writer's intention that Dexter would want to learn something from Trinity and ""grow"" as his relationship with himself and others changes, but the viewers relationship with him changes as well once we know that the code is not essential to the central character of Dexter and that destroys his credibility in the viewers eyes - I lost interest in him.

Likewise for the other characters, previously the flaws and foibles of the other characters have been explored and they impact upon the main plotline. Not so in my view in this season. Quinn seems to be a poor man's Doakes. There is some friction with Dexter, he views him as an outsider and even starts monitoring his movements and knows he is not who he says he is, but that plotline does not go any further. The money he takes from the crime scene is also not fully explored. Dexter uses is as leverage to attempt to have him back off from himself and Deb, but we never really know why the character made the decision to take the money and become ""dirty"". The character of Christine is another example. Like Dexter and Trinity she is a killer and with a series so focused on the why - why the killers act how they do and do what they do, her genesis as a killer is never explained by the writers. We know she is Trinity's daughter, that she shot Deb and Lundy to protect the father, but we never get to know her dark passenger as we do with all the other main characters that kill in this series. The relationship of Batista and LaGuerta also seems inconsequential to the main plotline.

All the episodes seem set up pointing to the final climax between Dexter and Trinity. Dexter's journey towards the climax is an empty one and seems rushed and confused. He's vulnerable and makes mistakes, because he wants to live outside of Harry's code.

The final bath scene with Rita is genuinely shocking from the horrible visual impact. We can assume that Trinity killed Rita but this does not fit within the context of the series as this does not accord with Trinity's own code (remember Trinity is horrified Christine killed Lundy), nor is it for preservation, as Trinity already had a plan to disappear and believed Dexter would be silent. We are left to speculate on the why. Justification or explanation for a death in this series, particularly of an ""innocent"" is not given.

Overall maybe the series has run its natural course. I think that there is only so much content for a series about a serial killer preying on killers before it becomes stale or strays beyond the already narrow boundaries of public acceptability. No doubt producers and the rest will want to milk this cash cow for all it's worth, but I think the writing can only degenerate from here on in.",1289865600,20,4549,4.6633416458852865
3957757,4,B002N5N5M0,"So, let me begin by stating that if I'm rating this show in relation to most of the nonsense and ""reality"" shows on TV right now this show would get the full 5 stars, not the 4 I rated it. That being said, the Season begins with a pretty graphic and slightly disturbing scene with Lithgow's character killing his victim in the tub and making her watch herself die.....and this ends up being foreshadowing for what is to come in a very creepy and fascinating study of human nature.

Lithgow is very strong in this season and creates a pretty complex, nuanced character that really showcases some of his abilities. I'm sure as an actor he was pretty grateful to be afforded the opportunity to work with such strong material. Bringing Carradine's character back for the Trinity killer arc was nice and set up some pretty interesting TV, though one begins to wonder if Debra is going to make it through a season without finding 2-3 people to sleep with. Not that I'm opposed to women who like to spread the love, or anything like that, just that season after season it gets a little one note. Also very interesting was Dexter's fascination with Arthur and even more so when the truth about Arthur and his family starts to emerge. All in all, the main arc was very satisfying.

The rest of arc involving Rita in the kids was hit and miss for me. I loved the relationship and the complexities that came with Dexter having to face what it takes to be in a relationship and watching Dexter grow just a little bit and learn to embrace a bit more of his humanity was interesting. It also sets up the surprise ending that really hits both Dexter and the audience right between the eyes so all in all, very well planned.

The Angel/Bautista romance I could have done without. The police detective suspecting Dexter thing has already been there done that with Doakes....why repeat it exactly with Quinn? The astor storyline was a bit tedious. However, even with those less than interesting arcs, I found the season as a whole to be very strong and would recommend it anyone, after they watched the first 3 seasons of course. ;)",1289865600,,2114,4.557894736842106

Season 4 lost it. It slowly slipped away and fell off the cliff with the surprise (and disappointing) finale.

Throughout each season, the viewers have had to deal with some unbelievable coincidences, but you could get by them because the show was so good.
The Ice Truck Killer is Dexter's long lost brother and now engaged to his sister??? OK, I'll get by it because the show is too fun to let that drag me down.

The blu-ray also has wonderful picture quality so good you can easily tell some of the scenes that are green screen.  The audio is also excellent.

When I set aside an hour to watch an episode, I don't want to waste 10 minutes of my time waiting for the menu to load.  Showtime/Paramount evidently does not value their consumers' time.

3957829,5,B002N5N5M0,"""Dexter: The Fourth Season"" came in last week. I wanted to watch one episode at a time, but sooner than one per week as TV viewers must do to get their fix of Dexter. I lost. I watched the four-set DVD series in two days. That's how enticing/intriguing/thrilling/demanding the series is. The viewer HAS to know what happens next.

Anyone reading reviews of any season of Dexter knows how fanatic Dexter's fans are. The episode in Season Four which ends with a car crash was just about the cruelest cut of all for those fans! Who in their sane mind (among Dexter fans) could live an entire week not knowing what happens next? So, of course, I hit the play button. Had to know!!

And good ol' Frank Lundy, the FBI-serial-killer hunter returns to this season and adds such a rich dimension to the story. The episode which ends with Lundy and Deb (Dexter's sister) forces another must-know, must-watch next episode. From that point on, NOT watching the series was no longer an option. So we had a Dexter marathon at my house in those two days. I even dreamed about Dexter (the series, not the man--although, let it be said, Michael C. Hall is an attractive man).

A prominent feature of this fourth season is Dexter's devoted wife. However, with the advent of a crying baby, she develops into a control freak--or perhaps this trait of control has always been present, providing proof positive that Dexter loves this woman and his family, that he is, indeed, connected despite his Dark Passenger, Perhaps with time he can boot DP, but, of course, the season finale precludes any such event. In fact, the finale perhaps foreshadows a partner in some future day. After all, many serial killers are successful for years and years.

Thus enters Arthur (John Lithgow), hiding behind the schoolteacher/deacon facade. Other reviewers strongly praise Lithgow's performance. I will, as well, but won't single him out. He joins a cast of equally powerful actors portraying equally evil killers. He does skilfully portray the chameleon facade of the psychopathic killer, even showing us the origin and root cause of his behavior. Unlike Dexter, Arthur does not have a benevolent father instructing him in ways of discovery avoidance. In fact, his drunken, destructive, abusive father pounds Arthur literally and figuratively into the makings of a serial killer.

The season finale is catastrophic and so unexpected, showing that history CAN repeat itself. I'm thinking maybe I will add Showtime to my television programming. I'm not sure I want to wait another year just to get the entire season in one package. Maybe the serial wait is not so bad.",1288396800,2,2632,4.879194630872483

Then, as the season began, I thought, 'well, he's ok....' But boy does he surprise. He just gets better and better and actually makes a serial killer somehow more humane. There are so many great scenes. I am on a pretty tight budget but I bought all four seasons. Season 4 is probably the best. The scenes with John Lithgow, from every detail, right down to him getting upset at the chatting girls at the library to the horrific, vile vitriol he spews at his family, are so engrossing and enjoyable, I believe he earned several awards for the portrayal.

Unfortunately, to make the plot work we are asked to believe a number of things that are very unlikely, and also accept just too many co-incidences. The middle of the season is not good, the on-going main plot protracted, and we see a 'weak' Dexter which is not, I believe, the programme's strength.

Without giving away plot lines, I have to sum it up by saying that the season's last edition made me believe it was 'all over'. I was amazed there is a FIFTH season ~ and fear it may stretch my disbelief even further.

3957880,3,B002N5N5M0,"Dexter Seasons 1 & 2 are FIVE STAR shows all the way.

Season 3 with Jimmy Smitts dropped to 4 stars as they perpetuated the storyline by having Dexter act out of character.
Dexter almost became a secondary character that season.

Now we look at this product ..... Season 4......

What was the problem ??

By the 4th episode it was easy to see the entire storyline for the full season, even a guess at the ""surprising"" ending.

My wife thought I was joking when I told her after 4 episodes I had the whole season figured out.
She made me write down my guesses and seal it an envelope.
Months later when the season ended, she opened the envelope and said .. ""Darn, you had it all right"".

Dexter is still a great show concept.
But Season #4 suffered from what I call ""Churning"".

Churning is where you run down the clock and burn up time by having nothing really happen except filler material and having the characters do stupid things to create plot twists.

In Season 4, you can watch the first four episodes and the last 3 episodes and you have 99% of the story.
The middle 5 episodes are filled with nothing but romantic interest side stories (that seem forced and un-natural).

Additionally after the mistakes Dexter made (and should have learned from) in Season 3, this Season is in many ways a rehash of Dexter once again acting out of character and creating problems for himself (and others) by doing the dumbest things possible.
All of which perpetuate the story and make simple problems much bigger than they needed to be.

I like stories when a situation becomes difficult for characters because of tough unexpected circumstances that are heaped upon them.

I get a bit dissapointed when writers stretch out a story simply by having the main characters do the dumbest and most illogical things possible -or- have them act totally out of character.

Still, these comments are all relative.

A 3-star Dexter is still much better than most other shows on TV.

I have heard that the writers themselves were not too happy with Seasons 3-4,  and did some serious discussions to get Dexter ""back on track"" and ""back in character"" for Season 5.

It's very subtle and I'm sure the casual viewer might not notice, but the picture has a grainier appearance throughout, most noticeably in darker scenes.  (I have a high quality television.)  Perhaps it's a bad authoring job of the DVD or maybe the show has switched picture capture techniques on set (perhaps something like switching from film to HD cameras) but I'd be curious to know if anyone has noticed this or an industry-insider could provide some insight.

The play between John Lithgow (Trinity killer) and Michael C Hall (Dexter) is absolutely brilliant, which the previous 3 seasons were too, but this one really rises above the others. If you're a fan of Dexter, you already know you want to watch this. If you haven't seen any Dexter, and you don't have the time for a marathon to watch the first 3 seasons in their entirety, this is a good place to start. You don't need to see the other seasons to watch this one, on the other hand, if you have, it makes season 4 better. I don't know how the writers did it, but that's quite amazing.",1285459200,,652,4.266129032258065

Season four takes Dexter to a whole new level.  The seasons have gotten better and better as they have come and this season is no different.  In my opinion, this season pulls on every emotional string known and it even made me feel like I was losing control along with Dexter.  The writing is top notch and the character development is done to perfection.  I am trying to be as unspecific as possible as to not give away anything that happens.

This show has a great cast and you immediately care about the characters.  Michael Hall and Jennifer Carpenter are great and they really hold their own in season four.  It is no wonder they are married in real life.  This season is a little disturbing than the other seasons, which I LOVE.  I am extremely anticipating what season five has to offer.

This season keeps the jaw dropping and has another great season ending. I was completely shocked at this seasons ending. Co-Staring the Great John Lithgow. Whom we know can be frightening. Or loveable. In his acting career.
But the trick of this show Is we do like Dexter, We do empathize with him and we feel Oh all kinds of things he can't.
So this really was another 5 star season. If they keep up with these writers this show could be on for another 4 years easy. Each episode Is carefully crafted to have It's own story and his sister plays an Integral part In Dexters ""Playing at Reality"" and keeping up his image.
She Is a great actor herself, all the supporting cast Is. Rita Is Great.

3957953,5,B002N5N5M0,"Dexter is a fantastic show. Perhaps my favorite show on TV right now. The actors are all very talented, and the stories are cohesive, interesting, and always a ""cut above"" (tongue in cheek).

I have only a couple of minor complaints about Season 4. First, I hated the unexpected ending. It wasn't really fair to the viewer, since there was absolutely no way to see it coming. Also, let's face it, what will life be like without Rita? She was awesome!

Second, I thought that the romance between Capt. LaGuerta and Angel Batista was out of place and ended up being more of an unimportant distraction.

But given those two minor shortcomings, the show was still incredible. John Lithgow (a.k.a. Trinity killer) was excellent in every way. The scene where he walks into the homicide department and Dexter sees him was tense enough to be cut with a knife (here I go again). In the first episode, I couldn't help but be reminded of how much of a departure this was from Lithgow's family-friendly films. Truly a talented, and dare I save brave, actor for taking on this role.

Dexter continues to be a five star show. Count me as a fan!

Hall continues to bring honesty to the role with his short bursts of energy, mixed in with the obvious need to display a constantly calculating Dexter Morgan. John Lithgow is excellent as the antagonist of season 4, and by the time Season 4 has run it's course, viewers are left in disarray.

Instead, we stayed home and watched the whole season.  Knowing we couldn't wait for Season 5 on DVD, which presumably will be Aug. 2011, we went ahead and ordered Showtime so we could watch season 5 as it's happening.

3957971,5,B002N5N5M0,"After three seasons of compelling and surprising stories, and just when you think they couldn't possibly come up with anything as exciting as what's come before, the creative team behind ""Dexter"" outdoes itself by carefully crafting an unendingly surprising and multi-dimensional story arc that has no extraneous moments -- EVERY piece of it fits carefully into the whole.  They keep leading you in one direction only to whip you around to an entirely different and exciting path and the circumstances keep shifting on many fronts.  During broadcast, I kept thinking to myself, ""I have to wait another WEEK to find out what happens next?!""  And on top of all the carefully plotted and supremely acted story lines, they manage to ask and explore really deep questions about identity and fate and human nature.  Absolutely brilliant, and while I'm delighted that John Lithgow was recognized for his fearlessly fantastic performance as Arthur Mitchell, and I appreciate both Bryan Cranston and Mad Men, I gotta say that I felt that the Emmys should have gone to Michael C.

The Dexter series is incredible: the cast is superb, the writing and the (no doubt) major amount of research that goes into putting together this series is so up to date that it plays like a reality drama of an incident that actually occurred.  So, far of all the the Seasons, this one haunted me the most.  I think its because it deals with things so close home that we all witness and interpret in such a way so that we can file it in the ""normal file"" even though we may ""feel"" otherwise.

3957983,4,B002N5N5M0,"I am completely hooked on Dexter, good, bad and ugly.  Can't give this one five stars because I did not like John Lithgow in the Trinity role at all. I generally don't like him as an actor period, but I tried view his Dexter role on its own.

The first half of the season moved too slowly.  My husband and I always bet on what's going to happen but like most people we did NOT see the ending coming.  The running theme of Harry's advice through the whole season was for Dexter to walk away from his family or they would pay the price for who he is. So far, Harry's always been right, so maybe we should have anticipated the ending. We figured Frank Lundy would buy it at some point but were disappointed he wasn't in more episodes.

Debra's and Vince's dialogue continue to be great.  The storyline between Batista and LaGuerta was weak and added nothing to the show. The relationship between Christine and Trinity wasn't fleshed out enough to explain how Christine got so twisted.

One thing that was bothersome about this season: from the beginning, Rita was a minimally employed worker that already had 2 kids to support.  Dexter's income can't be that much, so with 3 kids and Rita not working, how can they affort a house like the one in this season plus the rent on Dexter's old apartment?

For those who haven't read the Dexter books yet:  if you plan to read them, keep an open mind.  At best, the show should be tagged ""Loosely, LOOSELY based on the books."" Some of the characters have the same names but they are very, very different. The books also have an... interesting... and quite disturbing subplot involving Rita's kids. Have always wondered if that subplot would make it to the series but it might be a little much for viewers. You know something's bad if it could be too creepy even for the Showtime Dexter series!

The biggest disappointment? Now having to wait SO long for Season 5 DVDs",1284163200,2,1907,4.495652173913044

3957986,5,B002N5N5M0,"I've been a major fan of the Dexter series since its inception, and have also thoroughly enjoyed two of the novels upon which the show is based.
Due to economics, I lost cable service after the first three episodes of Dexter's fourth season, and have been patiently awaiting the release of DVDs.  I received my order from Amazon on the same day the show hit the stores, and at a significant discount.  My wife and I have gotten so much enjoyment and entertainment from this program; the writing, acting, and cinematography are all top notch, and the character concept is absolutely amazing.  John Lithgow's addition to the season 4 cast was unexpected and marvelous, as his years experience are cetainly an asset to any film I've seen him in (and he always plays incredible ""creeps"").
I don't keep up with awards shows, but Jennifer Carpenter should most definitely be recognized for her work with the character, portraying every emotion imaginable to the utmost...she is just fantastic!
This program is certainly worth a watch if you like intesity, imagination, a bit of gore (necessary to the story), and seeing the ""bad guys"" get their just desserts, which so often does not happen in real life.  This is some truly heady escapism.",1284076800,,1234,4.8619047619047615

Dexter is now a family man, married with 3 kids. He struggles with holding onto the illusion of being ""normal"" while still engaging in his outside activities. He does discover something interesting though...he actually has an attachment to Rita and the kids and has actual guilt when he kills an innocent man that he thought was a serial killer.

John Lithgow does a great job playing the bad guy (he always was good at playing lunatics). I enjoyed this season a lot and I hope they continue to keep it going strong in Season 5.",1283731200,,752,4.333333333333333

Season 4 is its best season yet which is saying a lot since each season has been excellent. The Dexter character certainly hasn't mellowed with fatherhood as he continues to kill for justice. A lot of twists this season as Dexter continues to battle his demons while trying to be a good father and husband. There's also major character development with Debra and a workplace romance that lasts throughout the season. Nearly every episode ends with a cliffhanger. This is great drama, on the level of prime Sopranos. Also worth noting is that John Lithgow did an excellent job as special guest star this season, better than Jimmy Smits in Season 3. I don't want to give away too much but this was an amazing season. If you haven't discovered Dexter, there's no better time than now. If you have Netflix, you could watch the first 2 seasons online for free through your computer, Xbox 360, or Roku. Season 5 starts September 26.

3957991,5,B002N5N5M0,"**NOTE: THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**

Bathtub murders of young women. Mothers of two jumping to their deaths. Bludgeonings of 40-something fathers. Such is the M.I. of the Trinity Killer, Dexter's twisted adversary this fourth season of the hit Showtime series.

The good news is that ""Dexter"" rises to the challenge of staying fresh this season and delivers with its best story arc since Season One. The second and third seasons were good but John Lithgow and the Trinity storyline bring back a creepiness to the show that was missing with Jimmy Smits. Not since the Ice Truck Killer storyline has ""Dexter"" managed to make this viewer so uneasy. The kills this season are very disturbing. An attack in a quiet and deserted office building is particularly unnerving.

While Dexter hunts Trinity, the department is trying to solve the Vacation Murders, as Miami tourists are being robbed and killed.

It was a delight to see Adrienne Barbeau (""Maude"") in the season-premiere as one of Harry's informant girlfriends.

Deb finds herself in a love triangle when FBI Agent Lundy returns unexpectedly, but it isn't long before both he and Anton are out of her life for good. Jennifer Carpenter really delivers when Deb has her subsequent breakdown and also at the end of the season in some crucial scenes involving a suspect.

Quinn starts up a sexual relationship with a clingy female reporter, whose neediness makes him a little uncomfortable and which tests his loyalities to the force.

Angel gets promoted this season but he and Laguerta endanger their jobs by engaging in an inter-office romance.

Masuka again provides the comic relief, and his big moment comes during Thanksgiving at Dexter's.

A continuing thread this season is Dexter trying to balance his life as a husband/new father and still satisfy the urges of his ""dark passenger"". This gets harder and harder to do until things begin to unravel. Rita drags him back to therapy. Dexter becomes responsible for the deaths of two innocent men. Later, a horrific event changes his life forever.

If you loved the first season, but thought Two and Three were lacking just a little something, these episodes really bring back the creepy vibe we saw the first year. You'll love it!",1283644800,,2242,4.970588235294118

If you are a fan of Dexter, I strongly recommend this dvd.",1283558400,,343,4.212121212121212
3957993,4,B002N5N5M0,"I am a huge fan of Dexter, I love the first novel and I have adored the first three seasons. But the fourth year of Dexter starts to fall short in the great acclaim the series is known for. I kept hearing rave reviews and I found numerous articles giving honor to Lithgow, so this led me to believe the fourth season of Dexter was going to be superior to others before it. This is far from the truth, and honestly this is the weakest season for the series.
What kills the rush and intensity of this year is the love story between LaGuerta and Balista. The writing for this subplot was poor and rushed. It definitely feels like filler so episodes would fit the time frame to be shown on Showtime. Frankly it is not important at all, and it reminds me of the stupid, pointless office romances and office altercations that writers put in 24 as filler. Only die hard fans of the LaGuerta and Balista will enjoy it. For the majority of Dexter fans, they will be thinking ""Who cares, give me more with Trinity and Dexter!"" The romance slows down the show and it easily could be edited out of the season to make this year a none stop thrill ride.
Debra also is a major drag. One would think she would be a lot more mature as the series has progressed over four years, but Morgan still has a lot of growing up to do. Debra is still very selfish, makes really stupid actions, and is very judgmental of those who are different from herself. These character traits personally have left me very annoyed with Debra and I could a really use a break from subplots dealing with her screwed up love life. It was entertaining in season one but after season three, I could care less.
With those criticisms for season four out of the way, I will say that the rest of the show is fantastic. Everything with Dexter and Trinity is heart pounding. The details of Dexter adjusting to being a husband, father, and a resident in suburbia is very captivating and I wish there had been more of that instead of the LaGuerta and Balista subplot. Writers should have dealt with Rita getting very close to discovering Dexter's tools, trophies, and learning what he does late at night, but that doesn't really occur.
Next season, writers should start the story right after Dexter finds Rita murdered. The cops need to immediately place Dexter as a suspect (he doesn't have an alibi because Rita was the only one who thought she knew where he was), Trinity should have left planted evidence to frame Dexter for the murder, have the grandparents take the kids under their care, then have Dexter on the run as he tries and figure out how to prove his innocence, and Debra can spend her entire time working to discover who really killed Rita or she can even help Dexter run. Dexter could discover a new killer to stop and frame for the murder of Rita. That would be a good story for season five.
So if the writers avoid the flaws from season four which were pointless love stories that were given way too much screen time, season five should be good. Dexter and events relating to Dexter's story need to be the sole things taking screen time. Keep the soundtrack because the salsa music is wonderful and I personally look forward to another soundtrack to be released. Debra needs to be more mature and more of a character who purposely helps Dexter and the police solve crimes right from the start instead of making stupid mistakes which unwittingly aid the police in their investigation. Give the fans more details of Quinn and his antics (He's not killing people on the side too is he? Because that means he and Dexter would have to square off.). If these guidelines had been followed in season four, I would have given it five stars instead of four. If they aren't followed, Dexter is going to continue to teeter in its quality of intensity and the first season will remain to be the superior within the series.",1283472000,,3876,4.491501416430595
3957994,5,B002N5N5M0,"This is one of those shows that gets better every year. I'm a fan of John Lithgow's from 3rd Rock from the Sun, in which he plays an alien trying to pass as a human (""Dick Solomon"") in order to learn about human culture. He is over-the-top, silly, in-your-face. John Lithgow is something very different in Dexter. He is subtle, sinister, chilling to watch. So much of the evil he portrays in this exists in the real world, with regular people, every day. I kid you not when I say this season of Dexter gave me nightmares.
I loved Jimmy Smitts as Miguel last season, but this season just had something extra. It takes a couple episodes to get into this season, but once you do, it's twist after twist after twist. It was even better the second time.

Lots of uncomfortable, anxiety-provoking moments, as Dexter's rigid discipline begins to unravel. Plus, there's a shocker ending that'll make you wonder where the show will go next.

the first part of the season brought back a lot of the humor that season three lacked, but after the first half it got dark quickly.

3958003,4,B002N5N5M0,"MAJOR SPOILERS ALERT!  BE WARNED!

I don't subscribe to Showtime, so I always look forward to a new season of ""Dexter"" on DVD, and this, the fourth, didn't disappoint (although I did have a few issues that I'll mention in a moment).

First off, the good: John Lithgow.  Believe the hype (and the Golden Globes and Emmy win); he's amazing as the Trinity killer, a 3-plus-decades-long murder machine.  The scenes with his family are beyond creepy.  Other reviewers have mentioned the Thanksgiving episode, and I agree that it was the best of the season.  When things start to go awry at the dinner table and Lithgow suddenly blurts out to his wife, ""Shut up, c*nt,"" my mouth fell open.  Although his story arc ends, he was vital to this season's excellence.

More good: Dexter's foul-mouthed sister Deb, who really came into her own this season; the romance between Batista and LaGuerta; the adorable baby they used as Dexter's new son.

And for the not-so-good: the writers really need to work on the domestic scenes.  Dexter's wife Rita has become a one-note character, expressing frustration in almost every scene with Dexter's inability to open up to her.  Everytime we see her, she is either driving somewhere, holding a baby, or pushing a stroller.  So, whereas I wasn't exactly thrilled she ended up dead in a bathtub at the end, I will be interested in seeing where the story goes next season without her presence.

One last not-so-good: I notice that ""Dexter"" tends to drag just a little bit in the middle of each season.  If you don't believe me, compare the last two or three episodes with, for example, the fifth or sixth.  The same thing happened last year with the Jimmy Smits storyline.  I suppose it's just the nature of the storytelling, but some tighter writing might liven things up a bit.

All in all, time well spent.  The new season starts in September, and while I won't see it until it arrives on DVD, sometime next year I suppose, I can't wait to see what they have in store!",1282694400,3,1998,4.6571428571428575

3958008,4,B002N5N5M0,"In most ways, this was the best season of Dexter yet. The writing seems to have gotten better. Gone is some of the annoying and misplaced music from earlier seasons. Unneeded graphic violence and language, seems actually toned down a little. John Lithgow as this season's main protagonist does an excellent job and brings some much needed acting muscle to the cast. The show's realism has also gone up a notch this season.
But not everything is perfect.  The side plots were fewer this season, and some characters carried no real weight. The love affair between two characters for example seemed like filler. But overall the season surpasses the others IMO.

MAJOR SPOILERS!!!

There are some interesting plot developments this season with Dexter rushing his method and killing his first innocent, and the seeming bit of guilt he feels. Dexter's father has taken on a Mitchell ala ""Mr. Brooks"" type persona, where Dexter communicates with him in his mind, rather then just seeing flashbacks. It was a nice and realistic touch to see the FBI come in and take over the Trinity case. For those that do not know, the FBI have a notorious and well deserved reputation as media whores and case thieves, and are hated by many in law enforcement. The physical and verbal family abuse by the Trinity killer of both his immediate family and Catherine, and their reactions, was well acted and provided some of the most gripping scenes of the season.
Some plot points harkened back to earlier seasons. Mirroring season one & two, Quinn seems to have replaced Doakes, as the cop who dislikes and senses something is wrong with Dexter. Also taking from season one, Dexter feels he can learn from the Trinity killer, similar to the way he thought he could from the Ice Truck Killer.

The death of Rita however takes the cake as the saddest and most shocking moment of the show. I don't think most fans saw this coming and I fear it was premature if the show intends to last more then another season. The Rita character was one of the best acted on the show and provided Dexter with an excellent partner. More then just a lovable character, I think the show has lost a real asset. If the writers wanted to do this I think they should have waited until the last season. It will no doubt provide some strong plot points for season 5, but once those are resolved, I fear the show will be left with a gaping hole.",1282435200,3,2393,4.623529411764705

3958011,4,B002N5N5M0,"First off, I love all 4 seasons. Dexter is by far my favorite show to date. However, season 4 imo was the first to take a step backwards since the show began. Dexter being a father and a married man, found himself more restricted and couldn't be the good ol Dexyboy that I came to root for. The writers couldn't ignore his new found responsibilities. As I like to say, they wrote themselves into a corner. Its a shame too, because season 4 started off with such promise. I was overjoyed to hear that John Liftgow was coming onboard. But there were very few instances inwhich season 4 really reached out and grabbed me if you will. But like I said earlier, its still a great season. Its just when you compare it to the others, its the weakest. Its like me saying that my 1 million dollars isn't as good as your 1 million and twenty. Its all relative.

Now with the complications in his life (marriage, cohabitation, kids), the writers were unable to maintain that.  If they ever go the way the books have gone, I will totally quit the show.

Barring that, Keith Carradine returned, one of my favourite characters as well. So it was full of excitement.

When I heard that Jon Lithgow was joining the cast I became nervous; bringing on a well-known actor is a classic sign of jumping the shark.  The producers hoped to reinvigorate the brand by bringing in outside help.  If that was all they had done, the season would have been bearable, bland, but bearable.

Instead, the show commits a mortal sin--it destroys its winning formula in a desperate attempt to win viewers for the next season.  It won't work.  The series is doomed.  It really is too bad they couldn't resist the urge to milk this cow to death.

The real show ended in season 3.  If you want to remember Dexter as a great show, walk away at the end of season three.  Not only will season four be less enjoyable that the previous three, its needlessly harsh ""shocker"" ending will make you like the previous seasons less.

This time, Dex is married to the adorable Rita, a once-abused wife of an ex-con, and her two adorable kids... and Dexter's son. The series deviates from the books in that the children in print are just as damaged as he was, and Dex finds his life's purpose to be to guide his young killers to be perceived as normal.

On DVD, Dexter encounters the Trinity Killer (John Lithgow) in an Emmy-winning role as another serial killer. How does one kindred killing spirit deal with another? Dex has to kill him, but this time, the chase is true cat-and-mouse with enough twisting side-stories to make the toughest viewers gasp.

Michael C.

So, Daddy Dexter, Dark Passeger and all, are out there doing their thing. The problem is that Dexter becomes somewhat disturbed by the thing he is, knowing that monsters sometimes emerge from the closets they hide in. Poit in cae, Trinity, the killer he is hunting with the help of Deb and Frank Lundy (see the Bay Harbor Butcher, Season 2). As far as they know, Trinity has a pattern of threes that he does for a reason that reveals itself, and Dexter thinks he may have more in common with Trinity than he first thought. This way of thinking leave Dexter off his game, however, and leads to an ending that almost all shows EVER have yet to top.

As far as Dexter, Season 4, i was afraid of it initially. The daddy theme and the marriage theme are oftentimes poison for shows and I thought it was going to be this way again. Boy was I surprised. Early on the show pointed out that Dexter was one smart cookie (take a look at the gym episode) and he was a loving father with a need for an air conditioning unit. This portrayal of Dexter, this great thing they have done, really made me like him quite a bit here. Even more to the credit of the show was the antithesis of Dexter - one John Lithgow AKA Trinity. Trinity is a puzzle you want to solve and, for a time, you think you have him pegged. Then you see more of him and, well, this thing jumps out and startles you severely. Personally I loved that point and i loved that ending, mostly because it shocked me and it caught me off-guard.
Fans of the show will wbe stunned by this.

A fan that has gonet this fan should check out this seasons. It will do them a service, a great one, and make them happy campers. If you missed something you will want to catch it first, however, making certain that you know everything that has taken place.

3958034,5,B002N5N5M0,"As someone who's been a fan since the beginning, I can say with certainty that a season of ""Dexter"" is only as good as it's villian. Since I found Jimmy Smitts' DA character in Season 3 to be the weakest villian so far, I was thrilled that Season 4 bounced back with it's best villian yet - John Lithgow's ""Trinity killer"".

Actually, referring to each season's central antagonist as a ""villian"" isn't really accurate. Each season of Dexter revolves around a central relationship. At Dexter's core, he is looking for someone who he can be his true, complete self with. Someone who will accept him and understand him for who he is. In Season 1, this character took the form of a brother, in Season 2, a lover, and in Season 3, a friend. Sadly and ironically, finding these ""genuine"" connections almost always ends up threatening Dexter's ""fake"" life, and, so far, Dexter always chooses to save his ""fake"" life instead of pursuing honest relationships with the bloodthirsty soulmates who truly understand him.

In Season 4, this central relationship takes the form of a father figure and mentor, played by the superb John Lithgow. What makes the season so mesmerizing is that, maybe for the first time, Michael C. hall, who is a fantastic actor, is paired with an actor who can really match his acting chops. The two have terrific chemistry, and to watch the two characters slowly chip away at each other's carefully constructed facades over the course of the season is thrilling. I have to say, that before the final scene of the season's last episode, I was finding myself a little disappointed that the show seemed to be ending its season in it's usual way, until ... BAM! The final scene that set the internet and fans on fire.

The show's weakness has always been its supporting characters, whose storylines never live up to Dexter's in terms of being engrossing or entertaining. I've always liked the Deborah character, and I prefer seeing her paired with partner Quinn rather than with the late Doakes (was it just me, or did that actor only ever have one expression?). But her rekindled romance with Lundy was a boring subplot, and Quinn's love affair with Trinity's daughter was only slightly more interesting. In addition, I find both of the actors who play Angel and Laguerta to be charming, but putting them together into a forbidden office romance added nothing to the season.

The season belonged to John Lithgow, and, of course, the final shocking twist. Regarding the former, I don't see how the show could possibly surpass this season's central nemesis, but regarding the later, season 5 will definitely see Dexter's life shaken up!",1280102400,,2647,4.823788546255507
3958035,5,B002N5N5M0,"Obviously, this was a spectacular season just based on the awards, media buzz, and reviews it got, but is it worth buying opposed to just renting or watching on-line? In my opinion, absolutely yes!

Season 4 of Dexter was without a doubt the best season of any TV show I have ever watched. Season 1-3 were excellent, but season 4 took everything to a new level. I, like many others, had my doubts about John Lithgow being cast as the main antagonist (the Trinity Killer) this time around, but he did a spectacular job and really comes across as exactly what he set out to portray: a family-man/serial killer of a different mold than Dexter. He really knows how to give that look that just send chills down your spine. Watching John Lithgow and Michael C. Hall at their very best was a pure treat during season 4.

Without giving anything away about the story, I will just say that side stories were decent during the season, but it all comes back to the interactions between Dexter and the Trinity Killer. The twists and turns the writing provides really make you want to keep watching more and more. Be sure you have plenty of time on your hands when you start watching this season, because you won't be able to stop. And once you are done with the season, you will want to go back and watch it more... just to pick up on those small intricacies you might have missed the first time.

While Dexter isn't one of those shows that throws out great special effects or scenes that would really seem to thrive on blu-ray opposed to standard definition, I've found watching the standard versions of Dexter to be flat in a way. It has something about it in the scenery and the way it's filmed that really leaves more of an impression on you in high def (at least in my opinion). I thought about going standard definition just to save some money and have a little more ""portability"" in it in case I want to bring it to someone else's house, but figure I will enjoy it infinitely more by going with the blu-ray.",1279411200,,2002,4.434782608695652
3958036,5,B002N5N5M0,"Season 4 starts off at a nice clip.  The episodes resolve on an episode to episode basis as the writers slowly reveal the details of the major plot which really becomes the main focus 4 or 5 episodes into the season.

The start felt very fast and refreshing where I could laugh at the situations Dexter got into and how he dealt with his life.  Like a needle slowly being pushed into your skin, the season escalates nicely as you watch with horror and your mind imagines the worst and wonders how events will progress. You will get caught up in it and by the end will feel like you have been punched fully in the face.  I didn't see it coming, and I loved it!

Don't read ANYTHING about what happens in this show.  You are in for a real treat.

As a side note: John Lithgow does a wonderful job.  The guy is a riot in his other shows, but in this, you will be pleased.  He pulls off his character in an effective and creepy manner.  I really don't like the big star guest appearances...I had to live through the first Batman movie series...In Dexter, it has been done well.

The writers have made a well-paced, clever season, that stays true to the reality of the prior shows.

All the actors have done a wonderful job bringing these characters to life.

The direction is even quite enjoyable.

This season may really be my favorite.  I am going to have to watch the first season again and put it to the test, but it is definitely better than the second and third seasons, which I fully enjoyed.

Dexter continues this season with all of his balls in the air as usual, and his move to the burbs is truly a sight to behold.  This season like last season and like the season before hinges on the foil for Dexter and John Lithgow is fanstastic in this role.  He has to be one of the creepiest people I have ever watched on screen, the way he occilates from kind to menace at the drop of a hat is chilling.  Dexter has his work cut out for him this season, Lithgow really takes the action to him in the most personal way.  This could be the finest season of a truly ground breaking series.

3958053,3,B002N5N5M0,"Dexter Season 4 Review

For the most part, the Dexter series is perfect television that displays a perfect balance between quality and technique: at times, season four makes you wonder if all of that has changed.

On the plus side of things, John Lithgow is a great actor who gives a seamlessly creepy and pleasantly nuanced performance as Dexter's opponent. Some of his scenes (especially the ones in which Lithgow reveals his character's meticulously concealed insanity) are amazing to watch: scenes so good that they remind you that acting is a craft and that it is possible for an actor to be amazing at it.

In a strong departure from the earlier seasons, season four sees the writers trying to establish a longer-term change in the love-lives of a couple of the characters instead of the previous season's twelve-episodes-and-out shacking up. Unfortunately, this doesn't make up for all the things in season four that make you roll your eyes.

On the minus side, the complications that arise from Dexter's family life stretch credulity to the breaking point and beyond--a situation that is made obvious when several different characters call attention to how much time Dexter, the family man with an office job, spends in places where no one can find him day or night.

Dexter's wife, Rita, whom the writers have made a fiercely independent woman who puts great energy into her children and her marriage, becomes unsupportably unpleasant at times--at times almost shrewish--when she reacts to Dexter's unavoidable furtiveness and need for evasion. Unfortunately, this removes much of the emotional value from one element of season four's resolution.

Dexter worked in those first three seasons. Despite its dependence on a formula as contrived as a television sitcom's, Dexter has been bullet proof entertainment until now and it makes you wonder if the it's the writers who have run out of steam or if the original idea is just too thin to allow for stronger and more nuanced writing.

Watching the first three seasons of Dexter, things never became so strange that you threw your hands in the air and walked away regardless of how contrived the scripts were, or how much yoga the writers had to do to fit a compelling resolution into the show's formulas. It was what was good about the series's writing: its technique was never so bad that you saw that it was technique; nor was it so bad that you saw that the technique was missing. In season four, with it reliance on melodrama and increasingly wild coincidence, both those problems are present and noticeable.

One of the great things about the Dexter TV series is that even when the season's resolution is as strange as this season's is, you still want more of it, Dexter is an engaging character as are the people around him, but season four leaves you with a strange taste in your mouth--like weak tea and Tequila: at best the result is an acquired taste--one that makes you wonder if you will like the next season.",1276732800,8,2979,4.8619329388560155
3958054,5,B002N5N5M0,"What a different twist and entertaining season this was. Never a bland lull in this unique series. Lithgow and Hall both got Goldens for their parts this past season and well and long overdue deserved. This season was different than others but this is the blessings of the series. It is always different and never expected. Dexter, TrueBlood and The Closer are the best TV has to offer. I have already Pre-ordered this DVD even though the series is still on my DVR. Definitely buy, watch and be on the edge of your chair during every episode. It is wonderful to watch all the intertwinings of the series and what will happen next. Keep them coming as I continue to ask for more. I do not want it to end. Go Dex, cannot wait to see what the writers have in store for us this September!",1275177600,,784,4.376712328767123
3958055,4,B002N5N5M0,"I must say that Season 4 kept me riveted from beginning to end.  Michael Hall was phenomenal as usual and John Lithgow made the perfect adversary, as I had confidence that he would.  The side-stories were a little weak, but it didn't diminish the greatness of this season's series.  There were considerable twists and the viewer was often required to make several psychological sommersaults, which was a treat.  The saddest part was that the season came to a close and will be hard-pressed for a worthy encore performance.  Alas, all good things come to an end.

**** Spoiler information and Critique *****

The writers of Dexter may have painted themselves into a corner impossible to escape from.  The murder of Rita was an awful decision by the writing staff.  How could you destroy the greatest shining light in Dexter's often dark existence ?  What will you now do for a dramatic contrast to Dexter's underlying 'dark passenger' ?  I'm sure my sentiments are shared my hundreds, if not thousands of fans.",1274313600,4,1009,4.842105263157895
3958056,5,B002N5N5M0,"*Spoiler alert*. So this is my far my least favorite season. My favorite would be season 2. I absolutley could not stand the trinty killer. He drove me nuts! I didn't like rita in the first season but when the second season came out i started to like her alot more. I can't believe that they killed her off. One of my favorite things about this show is that it doesn't involve alot of cheesy stuff and babies. I do not like to watch shows that have alot of baby interations. And now that rita is gone it's gonna be all about Harry 2. I gave it 5 stars because no matter how crappy the other characters are or the ending i am hooked for life. If you loved the other season's of dexter and are a dedicated fan, watch it!",1274054400,,718,4.099290780141844
3958057,5,B002N5N5M0,"Lithgows character in this is probably the creepiest character I've ever seen or read.  Deeply disturbing, and brilliantly protrayed by Lithgow (of course).  Dexter is my guilty pleasure.  Brilliant acting, the writing is flawless if sometimes very disturbing, inspired characterization, humor mixed with the macabre, what more could you want on a cold winters night.  I watched the previous seasons over and over again, but I was unable to watch this one twice.  Like I said, Lithgows character was the most frightening character I've ever seen or read. This is the thing nightmares are made of.  If you missed the season, go for it.  If you weren't as horrified as I was, go for it.",1273363200,,684,4.895652173913043
3958058,5,B002N5N5M0,"This was my favorite season so far, but I think I say that every season. I thought  John Lithgow was brilliant as Trinity, and I love that there is always a ""bad"" serial killer pitted against Dexter's ""good."" There were a few times this season that I couldn't watch because the scenes were too graphic (which isn't surprising for a Showtime series). The scene when Trinity kills with a hammer was one of them.

Spoiler alert: I cannot wait to see what happens next season now that Rita is gone. It'll be interesting to see how Dexter copes without her around. I was personally getting a little sick of Dexter with a family, but I did always like Rita and was sad to see her go. All in all, fantastic, unique series that I recommend to everyone.",1272585600,4,744,4.423357664233577

3958060,4,B002N5N5M0,"I've both read some of Jeff Lindsay's novels and viewed their interpretation on Showtime's Dexter. I love the concept of a serial killer of killers and the situations he puts himself into. A dark passenger that, although corrupting, has been geared towards vigilante justice...it's intriguing. Most of Dexter has been unraveled and evolved at this point; his past, his childhood, the relationship with his father, sister, etc...and now we see him in a father and husband role.

I'm disappointed to hear that Michael C. Hall had to recently undergo treatment for cancer, but glad he's in remission and returned to film season 5. I'll be interested to see if it took a little steam out of the man portraying such a personality. I was a fan of his since 6 Feet Under, so I'm pleased he's still with us.

Anyhow, this particular season focused on the family model; getting married, having a baby with Rita, being a step father to her kids. I won't voice spoilers here but I'm sure everyone is aware of how his marriage turns out. And of course Dexter has some cop on the force who gets a little too curious. We all know what happens to those.

The show overall is clever, entertaining, and not always predictable. I hate shows and plots that I can easily foretell what will happen next. And I like that most of the material tries to stay near true (with a couple of changes here & there) to the novels (basic plot, characters, etc...) I'm interested to see which direction the show will go in now. I hope the (UNREAL) season end of this season wasn't just some strange dream/nightmare.

This season Dexter is juggling a lot--family, a home, work, finding time for his passion, and a new rival. He's got pressure from all sides. Watching him masterfully keep it all together was one of the best acting endeavors only someone as gifted as Michael C. Hall could pull off.

That being said, I will say this season starts out a little slower than previous seasons.  Oh, it'll still hold your interest, that's a given, especially with its building up of storyline from episode to episode. Overall though I felt seasons 2 and 3 were stronger.  I like this show, but it's not perfect - and perhaps this could be said of all the seasons. In terms of excitement and entertainment value it's as 5 star as a Big Mac is full of cholesterol.  It's only weakness is in the occasional little illogical (but convenient) plot devices that crop up out of nowhere.  Yes, I'm saying that what keeps me from taking this show completely seriously is that there are scenarios that are not just a bit far-fetched, but sometimes completely defy the laws of logic - see if you can spot them.  I'd name 3 or 4 examples right off the top of my head but who needs spoilers?  It doesn't matter - that's just the nature of the show, like cholesterol is part of a Big Mac.  You enjoy it and will order it again.  If not the Big Mac, then the fries.  Not a fair analogy I realize, considering I don't care much for Big Macs while I am already looking forward to the next season of Dexter.

3958076,4,B002N5N5M0,"I liked the family-man spin that Dexter has taken in this episode, but I saw the ""shocking finale"" in episode twelve coming from this very telling beginning. Not to spoil anything, but Dexter should know that his dark passenger will eventually cause nothing but horror and grief for everyone around him. To have a family in that situation with what he does is probably the most evil thing he does on a regular basis.

On that note, however, it has been suggested that if the right frontal lobe of the brain is either underdeveloped or has some sort of damage, as is suggested in the last season's full body scan, it would cause a person to become disassociated with feelings and conscience. Be this as it may, it seems to me that Dexter has PLENTY of emotions. He just lacks the ability to identify them correctly. Just like a person born with a heavy callous over a part of the skin, there are still nerves going to it. If you shave away the callous you can feel just like anyone else.

This season's closer should be something that finally shaves off a bit of Dexter's emotional callous; because if it doesn't he's going to wind up dumping his entire family into the bay.

And it really, REALLY sucks that Showtime hasn't released this season for sale online. I have Christmas credits to spend, and I wanted this, but Showtime says ""Bah, humbug! Subscribe to Showtime and pay regularly to watch all of our programming, not just the one program you really WANT to watch! Dexter's the only show people really want to watch (and pay for), so we'll hold Season 4 hostage as long as it takes to get you suckled down on the tate."" I don't care about Californication, Nurse Whatever, The Tudors or any of that other stuff. Give us Dexter NOW!",1261440000,22,1737,4.525477707006369
3958077,5,B002N5N5M0,"If you haven't watched seasons 1 - 3 of Dexter yet, you have no idea what you're missing out on.  For three days after the season 4 finale of Dexter aired on Showtime, the phrase ""Dexter"" was constantly in the top ten trends for most searched, most Tweeted, most blogged according to both Google and Twitter. Once you finally see the last episode of season 4, you'll completely understand why.

Season four started in a bit of controversy among Dexter fans when it was announced that John Lithgow was tapped to play the season's arch-villain, the Trinity Killer.  For those of us who were used to Lithgow's comedic performances in shows like Third Rock and Harry and the Hendersons, he didn't seem to fit the normal profile of a Dexter guest star. However, like the casting of Jimmy Smits as Miguel Prado, Lithgow pulls off the demeanor of a ""Normal, everyday kind of guy"" serial killer to a tee.

The show starts up by reminding us that Dexter is now the family man - a brand new baby, a brand new wife, a brand new home in the suburbs, but the same ol' Dark Passenger.  The struggle to constantly balance his false family facade with the urges of his darker side is the general theme of the season; and through most of the season it seems as if Dexter is doomed to failure as his family starts to fracture and his kills get sloppier.  Enter the Trinity Killer - someone, who in Dexter's eyes is another possible mentor for himself. The Trinity Killer has been an enigma for over thirty years; never caught, never seen, and not even entirely believed to be real.  Dexter finds the possibility of learning from the Trinity Killer as an opportunity he cannot let pass by.

As with all of the seasons, there are quite a few subplots involving the other Dexter cast members, but all-in-all, other than the one including Quinn and Debra, they feel somewhat tacked on.  However the main plot line this season is such a driving force that the weak subplots are quickly forgotten and forgiven.  The subplots are all mostly of an romantic nature, including one between Capt. LaGuerta and Angel Batista, the reappearance of a retired Frank Lundy, and the romance between Quinn and Christine Hill.  This season also finds Debra digging into her past and discovering what kind of man Harry Morgan really was - which needless to say, also leads her to learn more about her brother, Dexter.

At the beginning of Season Four, you find Dexter juggling so many faces to figure out who he really is, and who he can be.  By the end of Season Four, Dexter learns that the very act of juggling the different personas has changed his life forever.  Season five has some big shoes to fill.

Addressing the subject of DVD versus Blu-Ray, having been forced to watch Dexter on standard definition on various occasions when the cable company had some ""glitches,"" I can safely recommend the high def over the standard versions.  While you won't really ""miss"" anything by lacking the sharpness of the HD presentation, the atmosphere just seems much more poignant and dramatic in the high def videos.  I should also mention that Dexter does take full advantage of surround sound, and it's pretty creepy when you can hear sounds off and around corners when watching Dexter sneak around to grab his next kill.",1261267200,185,3279,4.655112651646447
3958078,5,B002N5N5M0,"If fans loved the first season of Dexter and had negative feelings about Seasons 2 & 3, then Season 4 will not disappoint.

Emmy nominee Michael C. Hall returns as Dearly Devoted Daddy Dexter, who now lives with wife Rita (Julie Benz) and three kids in their new suburban home complete with pool, and some nosy neighbors who make Dexter's life miserable. As all this goes on, Dexter arrives at a crime scene where a woman is found in a bathtub covered in a pool of blood. There he finds that Special Agent Lundy has come back with the idea that this same crime happened 30 years ago in Miami and in several cities around the country. Lundy calls him the Trinity Killer. Later two more bodies are found, a mother committing suicide and a man bludgeoned at a bar, both homicides connected to Trinity. When Deborah becomes very involved publicly to the case, Dexter discovers the identity of Trinity to be a man named Arthur Mitchell (John Lithgow) who has a family of his own.

Dexter gets to know Arthur better in order to learn how he can keep the secret of his dark passenger and his family intact. This proves more difficult the further Dexter goes into Arthur's life until Dexter finally decides to make his move and get Arthur on his table.

A few subplots abound in this season as well. La Guerta and Batista have a romantic relationship, Quinn begins sleeping with a local reporter intending to get more out of him than certain parts, and Deborah continues to look into Harry's C.I.'s to find out who he slept with.

December 13th ended on a rather shocking note (which I won't say) and there are many great episodes to watch here. To name a few: The Getaway, Hello, Dexter Morgan, Hungry Man, and Dirty Harry. John Lithgow as Arthur Miller/Trinity has given us a performance that may outrank The Ice Truck Killer in Season 1. The role has also given Lithgow a Golden Globe and possibly an Emmy nomination later for his role as the serial killer. This season is definitely a must see for any fan of the show or for those who haven't seen the other seasons.",1260921600,2,2062,4.520107238605898
3958079,5,B002N5N5M0,"Dexter fans are reeling from the shocker of a season finale that aired last Sunday Dec. 13th, and rightly so.  Yet for people curious about the show, Season 4 is a great place to start.  Season 4 begins with Dexter adjusting to life as a new dad and a married man.  As a viewer, I didn't want the show to turn into 'Dexter changes a diaper' or 'Dexter Buys Formula' and the writers exposed Dexter to those things and Dexter reacts to them as best and as humorously as he can.  Dexter is still in there, with his Dark Passenger, leading a double life and trying to cope in his own way with new challenges.  It seems like Dexter doesn't do a lot of killing in Season 4, it's more of a tense cat and mouse game leading up to the season finale.  Season 4 stars John Lithgow as father/deacon/volunteer/serial killer Arthur.  A great casting decision as Lithgow can act the gamut of emotions.  His portrayal of the character will perhaps go down as one of the most complex and notorious bad guys in TV or movie history, right along side with Hannibal Lecter (Hannibal had many sides, too).
Season 4 has a movie length plot cut into a serial format.  It's a great place to start for new fans because in a way, the events of the season are clearing the way for Dexter to decide if he wants to be a family man, a normal guy next door or embrace his Dark Passenger once again and without looking back.
Strong performances (as always) from Jennifer Carpenter as Dexter's sister Deb.
The only negative I can comment on is the subplot of the relationship between La Guerta and Batista.  I love Angel but the fling with La Guerta seemed distracting.  Liked him better with the vice detective ;)

For fans who didn't like Season 3, Season 4 will bring them back into the Dexter fold certainly.  Excellent fiction all around.  As Jennifer Carpenter said in an interview w/E Online ""I hope you have a good time talking to your therapists about it because it's beyond whatever you may think.""  Fans of the show are a mix: those who like blood and violence period, those who like the characters and storylines, those who analyze the themes, those who revel in their ability to compartmentalize their reactions and emotions.  However, Dexter is a show that makes you think and in the season finale, it's a show that makes you feel things in your gut, things that you forgot a tv show could make you feel, things that you will be forced to feel whether you like it or not...

Keep up the good work writers!",1260835200,112,2485,4.438325991189427
3958080,5,B002N5N5M0,"Update: both Michael C. Hall and John Lithgow won the Golden Globe for their performances this season. Michael C. Hall also won the Screen Actor's Guild Award.

The success of this type of show, serial killer crime, is usually dependent on how good the villain is.  Dexter is, of course, semi villainous since he is a serial killer himself but he kills bad guys.  So the series needs a ""real"" bad guy as well.  John Lithgow is that bad guy this season and quite simply, you couldn't ask for a better one.  It is a very complex role of a supposedly ideal father, husband and dedicated volunteer for the homeless who also is the serial killer Trinity. He is a very nuanced and layered character.  These two characters are not the whole show but they firmly anchor it and everyone else revolves around them. There are surprising twists this season and none more so than the ending. But this is how Dexter always works as a tv show. All the other characters are quite good again too, especially Dexter's sister, who has a significant role in unmasking Trinity too.

A note of warning: if you are also a reader and want to read the four Dexter novels, it is a somewhat bizarre experience to do it side by side with watching the tv show.  This is because the books and tv shows kill off and emphasize different characters.  Both are excellent but they are different.  Imagine Sherlock Holmes where Moriarty lives in the tv version but dies in the books and then change around Watson, Le Strade and the ""The Woman"", et al, and you begin to see the difficulty.  Dexter is also more villainous yet also more comic in the novels than in the tv show.

Another added note: if you are an audiobook fan, the Dexter audiobooks are some of the very best audiobooks around.  The narrator is superb.

3958081,5,B002N5N5M0,"In the fourth season of ""Dexter,"" America's favorite serial killer is dealing with a lot of change. Newly married, Dexter (Michael C. Hall) has acquired two step-children and is the father of a baby son. He's also hot on the tail of antoher serial killer, dubbed as the Trinity Killer (John Lithgow). Dexter gets close to Trinity early in the season but is shocked to discover many similarities between him and the madman, so he stalls on killing Trinity in hopes of learning a thing or two from him. All of this leads up to the most fantastic, overwhelming, and completely shocking season of ""Dexter"" ever. I'll be so bold as to say that I have never, in my 30 years of life, seen a season finale of any television show as jarring as the last three minutes of Season Four of ""Dexter."" It is UN-FREAKING-BELIEVABLE, and proof that this series is one of the greatest shows in all of television history.
