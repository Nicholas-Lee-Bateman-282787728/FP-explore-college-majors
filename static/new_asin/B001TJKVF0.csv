8341671,5,B001TJKVF0,"When I purchased this dvd I thought it was all Celia Cruz and was eager to watch and listen. Celia only appears once, and then the concert features the rest of the FANIA ALL STARS, like Hector Lavoe, among others. They seem happy to be there, and the joy is consistent throughout. The conductor is Johnny Pacheco and he does a great job with his enthusiasm and love for the sounds they're making. Jorge Santana takes a solo on one song and doesn't appear again. It would have been nice to see more of him. His solo was tentative, and he plays a lot better on the Santana concert called ""Sacred Fire"". But although I wanted to see more of Celia, this is an important chronicle of a time when these artist were all in their prime and sharing this great music with the world. I'm glad I bought it. Just watch out if you think this is a Celia Cruz concert. It's not. I saw her in concert before she died and she was really a joy to experience. In the opening number of this concert she's on top of her game. That first song is worth the price of this dvd.",1297728000,5,1051,4.182266009852217
