8404388,5,B003SKWROG,"very good dvd set , captures the essence of luxury rail travel on a international level and leaves us wishing we were there",1388448000,,123,4.391304347826087
8404389,5,B003SKWROG,"We love to ride the train and have a pretty good collection of train videos to keep us satisfied between trips. I bought this one for my husband as a Christmas gift and I would have to say that it is the best of the bunch. It features six different rides on luxury trains around the world and is beautifully filmed and narrated. You get a real feeling for what it is like to ride on these trains. There are lots of interior shots as well as descriptions of the side trips that are taken off the train. You'll get to see what your bedroom will look like, what the meals will be and the scnery you will enjoy along the way.  We would like to take every one of these trains and some of them are in destinations we had no desire to visit before. This video is among the very best in armchair travel.",1360972800,2,795,4.096153846153846
8404390,3,B003SKWROG,"The one problem is the misleading front cover of the steam engine. This led me to believe that most or all of them would have scenes of steam engines pulling the trains. Not so. Only two of the six journeys have steam engines and they were shown for about ten minutes out of the nearly six hours of videos. This may or may not be important to you.

My main complaint is that these are blatant advertisements for commercial tourist attractions. This includes frequent puffery about the wonderful staffs and how the person who runs the tourist attraction is wise beyond the lot of mortals. These videos should be given away. You should not have to pay to view them.",1318982400,2,663,4.525

PASS BY.I WILL NEVER FLY IN A PLANE AGAIN.I DON'T LIKE BEING 30,000 FEET IN
THE AIR WITH NO PLACE TO GO.THE TRAIN HAS COMFORTABLE PLACES TO SIT AND WATCH
THE SCENERY OR HAVE A DELICIOUS MEAL OR SLEEP THROUGH NTHE NIGHT. THE VIDEO
SHOWS YOU ALL THIS IN SUPBERB PHOTOGRAPHY.IT ALMOST LIKE BEING THERE.BUT ADDED
TO THIS IS WHEN THE PHOTOGRAPHY GOES OUTSIDE THE TRAIN AND YOU SEE THE TRAIN
FROM A BIRDS EYE VIEW AS WELL AS THE SCENERY.WITH PHOTOGRAPHY LIKE THIS I
DON'T HAVE TO BE BOTHERED WITH FAIRS OR LUGGAGE.IF I WISH TO VIEW SOMEPLACE
AGAIN OR SEE NEW PLACES I JUST SIT IN MY FAVORITE CHAIR AND TRAVEL BY VIDEO.
THE VIDEOS ARE FABULOUS,RELAXING,ENTERTAINING,INFORMATIVE,AND A KEEPER TO MY
VIDEO COLLECTION.",1315526400,3,784,4.607142857142857
