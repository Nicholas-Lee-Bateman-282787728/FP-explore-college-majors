2023255,1,B0001OGUYU,"I wish the DVD producers would get organized and list the episodes by the date they originally aired, the secret word for each episode, and the names of the first two guests, on both the DVD covers and on Amazon and other sales web sites, so collectors of ""YOU BET YOUR LIFE"" episodes can figure out which ones they have, and which ones they still need to buy,

Far too many 'YOU BET YOUR LIFE"" DVDs are just re-hashes of the same episodes that have appeared on other DVDs, and VHS tapes, repackaged with different artwork and names for the covers, some leaving out some episodes to cash in on the interest in ""YOU BET YOUR LIFE"" episodes by splitting them into multiple volumes from larger compilations.

Several hundred episodes were filmed and aired over a period of almost 14 years, and so it's frustrating to find the same relatively few episodes cropping up again and again on almost every DVD compilation.

From the fragmented descriptions from other reviewers of this volume, it sounds like this is another one of those re-hash collections, and thus isn't worth the effort to buy.

Until it's re-released with the above-mentioned specifics about all the episodes contained in it, this gets only one star in my book.

Who would you rather see trading quips and often being honored by Groucho?  You can see them all here, and many more, in this fore-runner to Jeopardy!.  Groucho admits his job here wasn't easy as we laugh at him as much as with him, but proved was a true comedian by taking verbal gags in stride regardless of who the 'butt of the joke' was.  Oh, and the questions are quite interesting and challenging too.  If this show had continued into the 60's, Groucho would surely have bet his sweet bippie too!",1275264000,4,683,4.565573770491803

2023258,5,B0001OGUYU,"""You Bet Your Life"" was one of the first television game shows to have been filmed in advance, allowing it to become the first game show to have it's reruns syndicated to local stations after it's network run ended in 1961.

Perhaps the best part of this DVD is that only two of the thirteen episodes included were from the syndication package (which was known as ""The Best Of Groucho""), and that most of the other episodes were not only in their original NBC broadcast format, but also included vintage commercials for the show's longtime sponsor DeSoto, a long-gone automobile make that was manufactured by Chrysler Corporation.

For the most part, the shows in this collection are presented the way millions of viewers saw them in the 1950's.

Fans of Groucho, the Marx Brothers, classic television and/or TV game shows in general will want to pick-up this DVD. It is an inexpensively-priced introduction to one of the most hilarious programs from the ""Golden Age Of Television"". If you like this DVD, you can then come back to Amazon and order ""'You Bet Your Life': The Best Episodes"" and ""'You Bet Your Life': The Lost Episodes"".",1262736000,6,1134,4.805128205128205

THAT'S ALL THAT'S NEEDED. YOU ALSO SAY BE DETAILED & SPECIFIC & NOT TOO LONG. WHAT IF I HAVE A LOT TO SAY? WHAT'S MORE SPECIFIC THAN ""I GOT IT, I LIKE IT & WILL BUY MORE LATER.""?

2023261,5,B0001OGUYU,"There's some classic Groucho on this DVD. If you've never seen or heard Groucho before, this is a great place to start.

This DVD is released by Echo Bridge entertainment and published by Platinum DVD. The cover incorrectly states there are 12 classic shows over 4 hours. Actually there are 14 shows and 6 hours of entertainment. The picture quality is quite good for the most part and includes all those DeSoto commercials. They are an interesting novelty at first but it wasn't long before I found myself fast forwarding through them.

This DVD contains one of You Bet Your Life's most side splittingly hilarious episodes, the one featuring Albert Hall, the printer's devil from Kansas. It's included in Scene section 5. Groucho's ability to maintain control of often awkward situations was truly remarkable.

There are not a lot of extras included in this package, but what is here is classic Groucho and is more than enough to warrant the price of admission. So sit back with some popcorn and enjoy one of the all time great comedians, the one, the only...GROUCHO!!",1212278400,42,1069,4.862637362637362
2023262,5,B0001OGUYU,I think this is the set I recently bought. It contains 12 episodes with good picture quality and sound. And it also contains vintage commercials that are worth the price of admission. See rare Desoto commercials with Groucho and even some commercials with Harpo and Chico. This is a great way to get 12 episodes of You Bet Your Life at a low price.,1088553600,31,348,4.453125
2023263,4,B0001OGUYU,"I have enjoyed watching this DVD of the old You Bet Your Life shows and get a kick out of seeing the commercials.  I must be different but I find these shows more desirable to watch that current TV shows of similar genre.  Of course Groucho is a master of the pun, turn of the phrase, and finding the funny in the ordinary.  You are watching copies of 1950's TV so there is a technology quality gap.  It does not distract me from enjoying the content and the game itself is not so exciting, but it is a gas to see Groucho do his thing.",1389484800,2,535,4.066666666666666
2023264,5,B0001OGUYU,Groucho Marx and still funny.  Time doesn't change his dry humor.  Good DVD to have for family and friends.  Good laughs.,1378339200,,121,4.666666666666667
2023265,5,B0001OGUYU,"As always this guy has an unmatched wit. If you like sarcasm he's your guy. 1950's guest are too thick to hold their ground with Groucho, but when they do he loves it!",1376352000,,167,4.090909090909091
2023266,5,B0001OGUYU,My husband and I enjoy watching the old time shows.  This is truly entertaining.  There were some dull moments but you can always fast forward,1357862400,,142,4.64
2023267,5,B0001OGUYU,"I thought it was series of comedies with Groucho and the rest of Marx Brothers,its a series of games show called You Bet Your life from the early 50s where he is a gameshow host and I was disapointed but thought I would give it a chance,Groucho was quick witted with contestants and it was funny with what he said,there was 13 episodes but it said on opening screen 7 episodes so when you get to end of the 7th episode you have to forward wind past to get to episode 8,but if you stop it then you have to go through whole process again. Even look on dvd cover to make sure how many episodes..each episode is a half hour long with contestants from the early 50s where some were sporting or actors and ordinary people of the day...",1326844800,,729,4.214285714285714
2023268,5,B0001OGUYU,"I work with Alzheimer's patients and at the same time am a fan of the Marx Brothers. I had always wanted to know about ""You Bet Your Life"" and it was great to watch this DVD with them, including the DeSoto commercials that came with it. Additionally, these people smile when they see Groucho and hear his ready wit in his one liners. Definitely this DVD is a must have.",1318204800,3,369,4.285714285714286
2023269,5,B0001OGUYU,"The Marx Brothers in their movies are fantastic,but this is a great insight into the early tv skills of Groucho. For any up and coming young person who would consider a career in TV or comedy they will learn alot by watching the pure skill and timing of Groucho. Recomend it, can be funny!",1307318400,3,289,4.37037037037037
2023270,5,B0001OGUYU,"Groucho was a funny man, and so were some of his guests.  I love the fins on the old DeSoto's in the commercials, and the push-button gear shifter on some models.",1305331200,2,162,4.225806451612903
2023271,5,B0001OGUYU,"I have to admit to not being a fan of the Marx Brothers movies, but Groucho is brilliant as the host of the game show ""You Bet Your Life"".

Now, it isn't much of a game show, but it is a vehicle for Groucho to riff on the contestants, and occasionally, get it back from them!

It's a cheap buy, and if you haven't seen the show before, give it a try.

Love the classic commercials also!",1300233600,4,386,3.987012987012987
2023272,5,B0001OGUYU,"I ordered this from an Amazon dealer in New Condition for just a few bucks and it's wonderful. Lots of these Groucho shows are out there in various quality. The quality of the 12 shows here (I think it was 12 or 14) is high and the humor is always great! I remembered a few from other releases but most were new to me. At the cheap price I was really happy.

The people on the show were interesting and had many different jobs. A few were really intelligent and would come up with the answers quickly. Some of the contestants were very outgoing and that made for a better episode.

I would like to know if anyone knows why it says 13 episodes on the front of the dvd case but on the disc itself, it says 7?",1446681600,,513,4.23469387755102
