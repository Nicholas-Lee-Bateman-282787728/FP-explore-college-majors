7976198,5,B00007G1XX,"The dvd from the label ""Pathfinder"" is the one to get.  Those familiar with this title know that the British-accented English dubbing is pathetic; so  much in fact, that it almost ruins the movie. I mean who wants to hear Bolo Yeung speak with an affected Brit accent as he's kicking ass? Even the voice of Jim Kelly is dubbed by someone else! Well the Pathfinder edition includes the Mandarin/Chinese language track, and it makes a huge difference. Scenes that came across as silly and weak, are suddenly intense and effectively dramatic, turning this into a serious Martial Arts crime film. The yellow subtitles are well done, and offer a good translation.  Also included on this dvd is a trailer which is actually in it's 2;35 aspect ratio. The main feature comes up as 4x3 in picture, but the image is actually compressed, or ""squashed,"" which means you can make the picture letterboxed by using the stretch feature on flat screen tv's, and it looks correct. This is the best image quality available, with bright colors and a sharp picture. There is even an audio commentary with several known film critics. Whoever put this package together really seemed to care about the film. So grab the Pathfinder edition soon, because it is out of print and will surely be a collectors edition.",1518220800,,1288,4.792792792792793
7976199,3,B00007G1XX,"Pathfinder Pictures? Never heard of them. While I'm pleased this movie was released on DVD, I am very disappointed with the overall picture and sound quality. This is one of the worst video transfers I have ever seen and the sound is not far behind. Obviously no money went into restoring this movie for its release on DVD and that's too bad for Jim Kelly fans. Make no mistake; this movie has nothing to do with the martial art's classic Black Belt Jones. Jim Kelly had a supporting role in ""Enter the Dragon"" and he didn't really get a chance to show us what he could do with his ability. In ""The Tattoo Connection"" he is the man, but once again this movie doesn't really showcase his martial arts talent either. I struggled to give this movie a 3 star rating but hey it's Jim Kelly. This is a typical 1970's chop socky movie that could have been much better. For martial arts and Kelly fans the fight scene between Kelly and Bolo Yeung is still exciting to watch. The Tattoo Connection is still an entertaining movie, but I definitely think the price is too much considering the poor picture and sound quality from Pathfinder.

7976200,3,B00007G1XX,"This film is for die hard Jim Kelly fans! ""The Tattoo Connection"" (TTC) is promoted as ""Black Belt Jones 2"" although it has no connection with the original Kelly classic. The producers of this title probably used the tie in to entice the casual fan to check this DVD out based on the popularity of ""Black Belt Jones."" The plot is sketchy as Kelly's secret agent character Lucas is given the assignment of retrieving a stolen diamond some where in Asia. The film never really gathers up enough steam to be considered as a top rate martial arts offering. However, TTC is at its best when Kelly is on the screen (as the star Kelly is notoriously absent during several rather long sequences) chopping up guys and laying down that ultra smooth soul brother rap. The highlight of the film occurs during the climatic fight on a ship were Kelly goes toe to toe with fellow ""Enter the Dragon"" alumni Bolo Yeung in a fight to the death. Kelly is fit and in fine form through out TTC. It's a shame that he wasn't given more to do in this effort it might have raised the over all quality of the film.",1052870400,8,1088,4.391089108910891
