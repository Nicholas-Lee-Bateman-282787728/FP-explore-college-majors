8442640,4,B004V2FWLK,"Ghar ho to aisa is a powerful and shocking family drama. It tells the story of a selfish family with Father (Sayeed Jaferi), Mother (Bindu), Two Brothers (Anil Kapoor) and (Raj Kiran), Brothers wife (Depti Naval), One Sister and her Husband (Kader Khan) and kid. Anil, Kader, Kader's Son and Depti are the good hearted people in this film.

It tells the storyline of Depti, who is the poor daughter in law and is treated absolutely bad. She gets tortured and beaten up by the evil mother in law Bindu, husband and sister. The sad thing about this, is that this kind of things happen for real. Many poor girls get married off and are treated like dirt, mainly because they cant go back to their mothers. This film demonstrates when Depti is forced to bring a big amount of money from her mother, otherwise she cant live in this house. Her mother is a servant, who lives alone in a almost damaged house as it is. There are many powerful and shocking stuff in this film. Its best if you see it for yourself.

Anil gives yet another Great performance. Meenakshi is Fun in the second half as she teaches the family a lesson, Watching Depti makes you upset, she gives a good performance. Kader Khan provides comedy and is magnificent as the Ghar Jamai (Meaning, the Man who lives in his in Laws). Bindu delivers a superb performance as the mother in law from hell. Raj Kiran is always playing the same role of the evil member of the family. All Supprting cast do a good job.",1305763200,,1468,4.4535315985130115
