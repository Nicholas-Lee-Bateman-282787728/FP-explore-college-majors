8185833,5,B000OONRJ8,When I watched this dvd I felt like I was in a jazz bar watching a live performance. I usually prefer bar performances more than festival concerts or other. It certainly feels warmer musically. I also like this dvd because I am a Randy fan and here he is playing in a quartet which gives him more space to play as the only horn on stage. And he is at the top of his performance.,1204934400,2,378,4.053333333333334
