These are video transfers so they will look as if you are watching them on tv years ago but definitely not unwatchable. I noticed no ghosting or shadowing at all on vol 1. The quality looked exactly like season 1 and 2.

Season 3 is a fun season, the Robinsons are no longer trapped on one planet the entire season, they get to explore a little more. The show is still basically a comedy and should be viewed as such.",1118188800,9,521,4.21
2268668,5,B00096S47G,"For the uninitiated these are some of the most outlandish episodes in the series. A lot of people poke fun at the ""Great Vegetable Rebellion (Isn't that the Tribble salesman from Star Trek?)"" Just have fun with it. ""Promised Planet"" is my favorite episode of all time. I hope this DVD has some extras but it does appear doubtful. It's just too bad that this is the last batch, this was my favorite show of all time. They just don't make anything like this anymore. 5 stars!",1118102400,21,473,4.448275862068965
2268669,2,B00096S47G,"So bummed out :-( The video quality on both volumes of season 3 is so terrible that it's unwatchable.
I'm not sure why season 3 is so bad compared to season 1 and 2. As many people have stated already
there is a ghosting image throughout every episode, it's more obvious in far away shots than it is on close ups.
It's really a shame because you can tell that it was filmed in a very high quality way, I'm very sure that if they
took the original film negatives and did a blu-ray release it would look as good as the Blu-rays they did for
Star Trek.",1117152000,,549,4.092592592592593

And of course, the infamous ""Great Vegitable Rebellion"". I will buy this, however, I wish they had more extras. No sign of Angela on Season 3, Vol. 1.",1116201600,7,431,4.684210526315789
2268671,4,B00096S47G,"In the first place, I am so glad that Fox has finally come to their senses and released Lost In Space on DVD.  We have waited long enough for our show, but our big disappointment has been that there are no extra features - (no interviews, no outtakes, no behind the scenes stories, not even a photo gallery of the actors - especially Guy Williams, he is why I watch the show).

While the writing was more intelligent in the first season, I believe that the show would have been much better if the producers and writing revolved around the adults more instead of ""Danger, Danger, Will Robinson"", 'Dr. Smith' and 'The Robot'.

Season 3 - 'Great Vegetable Rebellion', guess the actors needed the money (How Embarrassing)!!

The overall quality of the DVDs are very good.  I don't notice any 'Ghosts' or 'Shadows', just wish they included more special features.

2268672,5,B00096S47G,"Well, this is it.  The final episodes of the hapless family Robinson.  And it has some quite good ones in it.  ""Fugitives in Space"" is a highlite when Don and Smith get imprisoned with a fellow called Creech.  ""You think it's hot now?  Wait till summer."" ""I've got friends with a fortune in deutronium waiting on the outside.""

And of the course the greatest or worst episode of all time (depending how you look at it), ""The Great Vegetable Rebellion"" is in here too.  Killer acting by the mutated Smith as he turns into a piece of celery.  And the presence of an always dehydrated carrot called Tybo.  ""Water. Water.  I must have water.""

2268736,4,B00096S47G,"The final nine eps of the last season of LIS is here. The final season just gets hokier and hokier;tongue in cheek all the way. That is not to say that it is necessarily a bad thing either. There is alot of fun to be had watching it even today.
The series always had,but by now was reusing old footage a LOT.
From the first ep to the last the entire collection has been remastered quite well. If you are quick you can even spot the tiny wires that hold up the Jupiter Two(or the ones it runs on) and the space pod. The robot is even pulled by guy wires ""hidden"" in the ground. And speaking of the robot,this last season has seen a monumental change in him. He has gone from just a mechanical servant to a dear member of the family,with all the human emotions that go along with it. It's a hoot to see the robot cry,dress up and act like a woman,or when he takes a part out of himself he turns around so the others can't see;acting coy and shy. The series had really turned into a showcase for three characters:the robot,Will Robinson and Dr. Smith,the ones we always think of the most when we think of this show. The other characters come and go throughout the eps. June Lockhart and Guy Williams will disappear entirely sometimes,or one or the other. Sometimes its Judy or Penny,or Don. And speaking of Judy. Poor Marta Kristen. I really feel/felt sorry for her. She got the least lines of any character by far throughout the series. She never got a fair shake. She was really just the series eye candy/sex interest. I just have never known how good an actress she was because this is the only forum in which I can recall seeing her.
This three disc set,each in a separate slipcase,comes with some very special extras. All three were filmed for the 30th anniversary celebrations in /95. One is a very funny promo slip up,while the other two are interviews with Billi Mumy(pronounced moomy for those who don't know-I didn't until now. I always pronounced it mummy),and one with the lovable Jonathan Harris. A very likable man,who virtually created his character and the ""special guest star""credit.
Farewell to one of my favourite shows of the 60s. Fox has done a good job with everything,all things considered. The promos for the next week shows can be a little rough looking and the shows themselves have deficiencies typical of film of this age,but overall they look darn good. Did you know the cast was told before the last ep shot that there might be a 4th season?A script was written(more if you believe other stories) but CBS abruptly cancelled it two months later. Ahh,what might have been....the pain,oh the pain of it all!",1406764800,,2631,4.529411764705882

People tuned in everyweek to seek what low life thing he was going to do to the Robinson family this week and when he gets caught how will he coward out of it. New Special effects add to this season like not being on one planet all the time this way they could fly around to different space stations and different planets,you know they were always  drilling for fuel when they land. Also they now have a space pod something like the Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea flying sub,This way they can go down to the planet's surface without landing the Jupiter two and crack up somewhere.

2268758,4,B00096S47G,"When colour graced our screens, one of the first series to undergo the transformation was Irwin Allen's wonderful ""Lost in Space"". The first season was semi serious and had a thread running through it tying up the narrative with the antics of the villain Dr Smith played to camp perfection by Jonathan Harris. The second season was branching into more complex stories capitalising on the popularity of the show. The third season was the season to throw off all restraints and many of the episodes tended to ""jump the shark"". That is, the episodes went for desperate experimentation in an effort to keep audience interest and therefore some stories went for the bizarre rather than the logical. This volume is the best in quirky camp comedy for the Robinsons even featuring the infamous Vegetable rebellion episode that has become iconic in truly jumping the shark. By the time the series aired, the viewing public were quite used to the weirdness of the show and it had to get weirder and indeed it did!

Target: Earth features the monster of the week that looks okay as far as LIS monsters go.

Time Merchant is a standout showing what if... in a time paradox. What would have happened if Dr Smith had not stowed away on Jupiter II. The events show that things would have been even worse which is interesting and thought provoking.

The Promised Planet brings back more 60s hippies and they are always far out and freaky. The psychedelic colours are a real delight. It even has trippy music and is a genuine product of the 60s. It works as a nostalgia trip but this is quite irritating the way the characters act and the hippies are acting like Brady Bunch rejects. A real low to the series inthe same way The Way to Eden was for Star Trek.

Space Bounty is another episode with scoundrel Farnum B causing more mischief as he did last season.

The Flaming Planet has a mutated alien creature who thinks Dr Smith is his dad.

The Great Vegetable Rebellion is the clincher of all jump the sharks. This is brilliant and quirky featuring iconic carrot man and the goofy dialogue that follows.

So you can see from these episodes alone how the show attempted to branch out into different genres and it got goofier with each story. This is part of the charm of the show and made it infamous over the years. The colour is very psychedelic at times and is a great representation of 60s television. It is my fave season of the show for all these reasons and even the annoying episodes are a great source of camp comedy much like the 60s Batman TV show. Recommended for all television and sci fi buffs.",1373846400,,2593,4.575431034482759

There is also less episodes. My only favourite episode is ""the promised planet."" Where Penny starts dancing and is
taken away from her parents in a strange planet full of youngsters. She keeps dancing and dancing...
Dr Smith puts a wig on and starts dancing too, so funny. He says, ""Groovy man, I dig"" I laughed my head off at this episode and watched it ten times.

2268770,4,B00096S47G,"Lost in Space has a rather interesting history.  Originally intended as straight science fiction (the black-and-white episodes from the first season compare favorably with other television SF shows, including later series such as Battlestar: Galactica and Space 1999), the series changed drastically in the second and third seasons due to the influence of campy shows like Batman.  It became basically a vehicle for the comedy stylings of Jonathan Harris (who, like Leslie Nielsen in the Airplane movies, was a dramatic actor with unsuspected comedic talent).  By the end of the third and last season of Lost in Space (included in this DVD), things had gotten pretty weird and funny -- sometimes intentionally, sometimes accidentally.

Those of us who were growing up in that time period have strong opinions about this show: love it or hate it. My husband and I love it.  Your mileage may vary.  At the bare minimum, it's good clean entertainment for your children and grandchildren (yes, the children who watched the original run of Lost in Space are grandparents now).  If you remember the show fondly from childhood, you'll enjoy seeing the funny stuff that you missed when you were too young to ""get it"".  The show is well-acted, colorful, and has a genuine sense of warmth toward its characters, especially the Robinson children.  It's better than we realized at the time, and in ways that only became obvious to our generation when we had children of our own.",1296950400,4,1466,5.0

Sure, the SFX are cheesy, the plots simplistic, and there is an ""Oh, Gosh Darn!"" Serial Sensibility about it, but therein lies it's charm.  It's classic 1960's TV.  However, for those of you males who are the demographic known as the ""Baby Boomers"" there is a whole new way to look at it.  Remember when Penny was an ""older woman"" and her sister Judy was, well ... hot ... but an adult...  And ""Mrs Robinson""... :) wasn't even on the radar?  Well guess what?  Forget about the girls...  Mother Robinson is now a ""Younger Woman"" -- and she's a fine speciman of a female at that.

2268774,4,B00096S47G,"It has been nostalgic and sad to watch the final episodes of season 3 of ""Lost in Space.""  The 60s were winding down.  The final episodes aired at the end of 1967 and the beginning of 1968, which saw the second season of ""Star Trek"" and the release of the phenomenal and ground-breaking movie ""2001:  A Space Odyssey.""  The United States was growing up in so many ways, and ""Lost in Space"" had failed to keep track with our expectations.

Looking back, these final nine episodes had some excellent moments, and hint at what this series could have been.  Among the best episodes is ""Target: Earth,"" where a group of aliens that are similar to each other attempt to duplicate the individualism of earthlings.  ""The Time Merchant"" was one of the best episodes of the entire series.  Chronos the Time Merchant plans to take the remainder of the Robinsons' lives because they inadvertently interfered with his travel plans.  ""Fugitives in Space"" provided a bit of deception to keep me guessing how the episode was going to end.

Unfortunately, the series also keep the corny hokum that made season 2 weak.  ""The Promised Planet"" had a great idea at its core, but the music and mod light betray its 1960's heritage.  ""Space Beauty"" may have highlighted Judy's beauty, but Judy was too easily manipulated into entering a beauty contest that she was too smart to enter.  This episode was one of the lower points of this volume.  ""The Great Vegetable Rebellion"" is an episode that gets a lot of criticism.  This episode was not as bad as some people make it out, but it was a low point for the series.

You can count the number of science fiction television shows that left a lasting impression on viewers on your fingers.  As campy as ""Lost in Space"" sometimes was, it left an impression that is nearly as strong for many people as the impression that ""Star Trek"" left.  ""Star Trek"" was a much bolder show and tried to present some of the infinite possibilities that exist in the universe.  ""Lost in Space"" reached only a brief distance into the future and was the first non-animated television show that focused on a family of space pioneers.  Plot holes abound in ""Lost in Space.""  Dr. Smith has to be one of the most obnoxious central characters in a television show ever.  And yet, I retain my fondness for this show.

I think it is easy in this age of sophisticated digital effects and a chain of quality and classic science fiction television that extends back to at least the original ""Outer Limits"" to look down on ""Lost in Space"" as unworthy of appreciation.  However, the series was influential and it was memorable.  Had Irwin Allen maintained the serious nature of the show, it is possible that ""Lost in Space"" would have been the landmark television show that ""Star Trek"" became.  I know I watched both, and I know I enjoyed ""Star Trek"" when it came out the year following the debut of ""Lost in Space.""  I considered myself lucky that two such wonderful shows were on at the same time.

I look back on ""Lost in Space"" with fondness.  I enjoyed watching all three seasons.  Perhaps my fondness is just nostalgia.  If so, I will revel in my nostalgia and just maybe I will watch all the episodes again.

As a side note, after being a little boy and watching ""Lost in Space,"" I admired Will Robinson a lot.  I credit Will being a role model for my later years when I studied electronics and physics in college.  This show may have been campy, but I am glad that I was encouraged by a show like this one.  Perhaps we should all wish for more campy science fiction shows to encourage children to become scientists and engineers.",1157673600,11,3628,4.580745341614906
2268775,5,B00096S47G,I wish we could have bought Seasons 2 and 3 as complete sets. Vol. 1 was not available when we bought Vol. 2. But we have become addicted and are enjoying seeing these episodes once again.,1156982400,3,188,4.25
2268776,2,B00096S47G,"Back in the late 60's there were two camps of thought in regards to two shows: those that favored ""Lost in Space"" and those that favored ""Star Trek"".  My sister belonged to the latter and I, the former.

But enough about familial disagreement.

Though I would've preferred that the entire third season had been presented intact in one set (thus, the reduction of two stars), there are some recommendations that can be made for the purchase of this set.

It's coincidental that the second half of ""Lost in Space"" has some stories that have a casting connection with installments from the first season of ""Trek"".  ""The Flaming Planet"" features character actor Abraham Sofaer who appeared in the ""Charlie X"" episode of ""Trek"" as a one of the members of the mutant's race.  The infamous ""The Great Vegetable Rebellion"" guest stars Stanley Adams, an actor that will forever be engrained in the collective consciousness of ""Trek"" fans as ""Cyrano Jones"" of the classic ""The Trouble With Tribbles"" episode.

Though much maligned by fans and critics alike, ""The Great Vegetable Rebellion"" boasts one of the series best non-John Williams' scores, music by Joseph Mullendore.

Also, two of the remaining episodes are quite good and elevate the bar somewhat for the campy series.  ""Target: Earth"" is probably the closest the show in its later years came to ""serious"" drama, even with the over-the-top theatrics of Jonathan Harris.  The show made a simplistic commentary about the desire to express one's individuality - a theme that was on the minds of every ""flower child"" of the day.  Thus, like ""The Promised Planet"" episode, this installment was a reflection of the times.

Who said LiS had no redeeming social value???

Another bit of trivia involves ""The Time Merchant"" episode.  Guest star John Crawford appeared, at some time or another, in most of producer Irwin Allen's productions, including the theatrical films ""The Poseidon Adventure"" and ""The Towering Inferno"".

Arte Johnson, who would later be part of the comedic ensemble that made up TV's ""Laugh-In"", is featured in ""Princess of Space,"" along with Mrs. Irwin Allen herself, Sheila Matthews.  Matthews had also appeared in the second season episode, ""Space Vikings.""

And the future ""Sgt. Phil Esterhaus"" of ""Hill Street Blues"", veteran heavy Michael Conrad, appears in pre-Planet of the Apes-inspired makeup in ""Fugitives in Space"".  Coincidentally, Conrad's future co-star, Daniel J. Travanti, appeared in an earlier LiS season three episode, ""Collision of the Planets""...as a space hippy, no less.

Therefore, six of the nine episodes in this collection have something going for them and make it a worthy addition to a sci-fi/fantasy/Irwin Allen/television history fan!

It's still too bad that Twentieth Century Fox skimps on the extras that we DVD buyers expect, causing the disc to lose its third star.

'Too bad the four-star series was shackled with a two-star package!",1132790400,11,2933,5.158562367864693
2268777,4,B00096S47G,"This is the last of the series. Over the course of its three seasons it degenerated from a semi-serious science fiction show into a comic farce. It worked. The show was so silly that it could not be taken seriously but it could be taken with lots of fun. The main reason for this is Jonathan Harris playing Zachary Smith. The comic evil villain was always good for a few laughs.

Synopses for the episodes appear below:

Target Earth - This one is less campy and more in the vein of regular science fiction than most, but that's not saying much. As usual, Smith sets the trouble in motion when he accidentally jettisons the pod with part of the robot aboard. The pod lands on a planet and the crew of the Jupiter II head down to retrieve their belongings. That, of course, causes more trouble. The aliens on this particular planet are all identical and are intrigued by the differences between the humans. They are an old race failing because of their lack of diversity. That is the given reason but I think it has more to do with looking like a heap of mud. The aliens come up with a plan to ""replicate"" the Jupiter II crew and conquer earth.

Princess of Space - It's been a while since I have viewed the previous set but I think this episode sets a new standard for silliness. It's basically the Anastasia story without the Russians, pomp or grandeur. In its place, we get spaceships decked out with a model of the Cutty Sark, air funnels from early steam ships, navigating lanterns (on the inside) and an army of advanced computers which resemble filing cabinets with arms. The cutlass in the hands of the captain is a nice touch also. Basically, the aliens are looking for a lost princess hidden on Earth. They grab Penny instead and try to pass her off to the royal auntie. In short, Penny is mistaken for Princess Alpha from the planet Beta and must fool Aunt Gamma with her knowledge of cousins Iota, Kappa and Sylvia. Complete silliness!

Time Merchant - this time it is Will who unwittingly starts the trouble but, as always, Smith manages to make it worse. While running an experiment, Will accidentally captures a ""time merchant"". Said merchant is a bit peeved and takes Will as a slave to make up for his troubles. Naturally, Dr. Robinson, Dr. Smith and the Robot follow to get him back. From there, things get more complicated. It seems that Chronos, the time merchant, has a function something like the Greek fates. When a person's ""time tape"" runs out, Chronos snips it. While all of this is being explained, Smith manages to actually get himself back to Earth with Chronos's equipment but the catch is he is there just before the original Jupiter II takes off. He is not about the get on again but his failure to do so will mean that the ship gets destroyed by an uncharted asteroid. To fix things, the robot is sent back to Shanghai Smith and set things right. The big surprise and what makes this possibly the least believable episode is that Smith has an altruistic moment. It doesn't last but even having it is beyond belief.

The Promised Planet - The Robinson family finally makes it to Alpha Centauri. We don't really know how; there is just an announcement from the robot that they are coming into the Alpha Centauri system. Everyone seems surprised but pleased. They are greeted like heroes by a bunch of teenagers wearing West Point style uniforms and then told that they must be indoctrinated. The older folk are to be processed separately from Will and Penny. From there, things get weirder. The clean cut cadet types become hippies and seem to want to do nothing but turn Will and Penny into hippies as well, get them to deny their family and get the family to leave. Penny falls for it and becomes a go-go dancer but will resists. Dr. Smith falls for it as well and becomes the worst of the delinquents. It turns out they are not on Alpha Centauri at all and their hosts are aliens who cannot age. They want to extract something from the kids to let them grow up. It is all enough to make me shudder with my own memories of being a teenager and, even worse, the 60s.

Fugitives in Space - When a prisoner escapes from the Prison Planet Destructon (that's really the name), said prisoner runs into Smith and trades jackets with him. That leads the guards to suspect Smith and, by association, Maj. West. After a quick and dirty trial, both are condemned to Destructon for life sentences. No sooner are they incarcerated than Smith starts scheming with the prisoner who caused his problems in the first place in an escape attempt. West tries to be a restraining influence but Smith's greed is, as always, the ultimate determiner. This one is not as funny as some episodes nor is it as silly.

Space Beauty - Judy finally takes center stage...kind of. Mr. Farnum, the celestial zookeeper from some episodes back makes another appearance. This time he is the producer for the Miss Galaxy Beauty Contest. He has a mysterious backer who is very particular about who is in the contest. The backer takes a liking for Judy, can't fault his tastes there, but Judy doesn't want to play. It's a good thing she doesn't because the fine print of the contract calls for her soul. Smith, however, is more interested in the big payoff for the winner and he doesn't play fair. After being caught out trying to forge her name, he relies on getting her mad at MAJ West by implying that he has forbidden her to take part. Naturally, that means that Judy must sign up. Like so many episodes, this one can seem very silly...unless you have actually seen the workings of a beauty contest, then all too much is familiar. It should be noted that although Judy nominally takes center stage, it is mostly for display purposes. Her role is minimal and the usual suspects have most of the lines.

The Flaming Planet - Smith smuggles what he believes to be an orange tree aboard the Jupiter II. It is not an orange tree, of course, but is instead a plant with limited locomotion and intelligence. It thinks Smith is its ""mother"". When the plant is disposed of, it causes some damage to the ship and it is forced to orbit a planet while it makes repairs. As it turns out, the planet belonged to a warrior race with one member left. His price for not destroying the ship is to have a member of the crew fight one last war game with him; at the end, the entire planet will be destroyed. The robot gets selected and Smith's baby plant monster is enlisted to save the day.

The Great Vegetable Rebellion - This one is quite possibly the silliest episode of them all. The crew of the Jupiter II wishes to throw a birthday party for the robot. Smith decides to go down to a nearby planet to find a gift. While picking some flowers, he gets arrested by a giant carrot. Don't worry, the carrot speaks English. He doesn't like animal life. Eventually, he tries to turn everyone into vegetables. I don't think I can go on... Jungle Warfare was never so bad.

Junkyard in Space - Just as the Jupiter II has some mechanical problems, they happen by an intergalactic junkyard. When the robot goes to investigate in the pod, he gets captured by the junkman. The main ship heads off to retrieve him. The junkman likes what he sees and wants to purchase the ship for salvage. Needless to say, the crew doesn't want to sell. In order to pressure them, the junkman contaminates all their food. He offers Smith food for various parts, beginning with the some from the robot, and eventually trick Smith into letting him steal the Jupiter II. In the end, however, love conquers all.

Special Features: most of the special features are minimal, as are the menus but there are 2 that are especially worth while. These are the interviews with Billy Mummy and Jonathan Harris. These two actors, playing Will Robinson and Dr. Smith were the two central characters and helped make the show a success. They are worth watching.",1132185600,24,7897,4.538623595505618

2268781,4,B00096S47G,"Lost In Space.  When I was a kid, I NEVER missed an episode, and even rushed home from school a few years later to catch the reruns.  When I got the shocking news after Season Three that the show was cancelled by CBS, I was crushed!  Oh, the pain!  I kept hoping for a ""reunion"" special or feature movie (a-la ""Star Trek"") to tie up the loose ends, but it was never to be.  The Space Family Robinson is forever lost in space.

Season Three was my favorite season way back when (though as I've grown older I appreciate Season One a lot more).  This season had it all: A little bit of well-written sci-fi, mixed in with a whole lot of corny camp. I enjoyed the fact that Season Three allowed the Robinsons to spend more time flying through space and actually trying to get home, as opposed to being marooned on that dreadful and boring ""planet"".

2268783,4,B00096S47G,"Watching the last nine episodes of ""Lost in Space"" on DVD makes me wish there had been a fourth season, only perhaps without Irwin Allen stuck in the producer's chair and hoping against hope that his audience would never grow up.  In these episodes, arguably the least popular in the series, the cast demonstrates its versatility at playing three-dimensional roles, from the prototypes in ""Target Earth"" to the hip teens in ""The Promised Planet.""  Even the Robot got to dress up in drag in ""Space Beauty,"" the episode in this packet that made me laugh the most.  The infamous ""worst"" episode, ""The Great Vegetable Rebellion,"" holds up surprisingly well, especially when Penny asks her dad at least to consider the notion that plants might have feelings too.  The idea isn't as far-fetched as it seemed.  The cult favorite ""Time Merchant"" didn't evoke the sense of awe I thought it would, in spite of its eye-catching Daliesque set.  The episode certainly vindicates Dr. Smith for the treachery he wrought on the Robinsons at the beginning of the series, but it too quickly emasculates and then dismisses its guest star.  Dr. Chronos should have been allowed a few more ""tick-tock-tick-tocks.""  Dr. Smith is more solicitous of Major West in ""Fugitives in Space"" than he was even in ""The Space Primevals"" from Season 3, Volume 1, which proved once and for all he was really a good guy at heart, in spite of his many human -- or should I say childish? -- failings.

The image quality was decent if not exactly spectacular for so colorful a series.  The DVD ""extras,"" chiefly decade-old reminiscences by Jonathan Harris and Bill Mumy that genuine fans of the series have seen elsewhere, were somewhat disappointing.  All in all, though, this packet is good, if not great, for a short nostalgia trip through the campy ""Lost in Space"" fantasy universe on board the ""Jupiter II.""

2268784,2,B00096S47G,"If you had purchased the Columbia House versions on VHS of this show you'll know what I mean. This is just a DVD dub of those episodes, along with the same missing scenes.

On the DVD they went out of there way to cut these out, then offer them as a special feature. It would have been nice for someone, anyone, to find some old footage from when the show was actually filmed.

Perhaps old promos, appearances, ect. Instead we get an interview with Bill Mummy and Jonathan Harris done for 'Lost in Space Forever' another release which by the way has the same outake in it that is offered here.

I love Lost in Space and I'm glad it is on DVD. I just wish that someone cared enough to make it's DVD release better.

2268786,4,B00096S47G,"Well, the previous set was good enough so I decided to get this one too.  After all, it's got ""The Great Vegetable Rebellion"".

I'll start with DVD quality:

Menu system:  Uninspired but passable; what else is new?

Video:  Given that the show is released for a niche audience these days, there are some scratches, blemishes, unrestored trailers, dust marks, film jumps, just like in the previous releases.  It's overall acceptable and I've seen far worse for TV shows that were far more popular and beloved that cannot be blamed on the quality of the master analogue tapes.  Still, more care into the restoration work would have been nice.  I do hate film jumps and, quite frankly, this stuff - like all tv and media - should be preserved as a reflection of society at the time...  it might be dated and somewhat sexist, but at least the Robinsons prove their moral superiority (and possibly stupidity) by rescuing Doctor Smith from himself every week...  And you know Smith wouldn't be tolerated for one attosecond these days!

Audio:  Great in mono, nothing to complain about here.  Very passable!

As for the episodes themselves:

Target: Earth -- I loved the pre-credits teaser, even if the alien itself looks fairly disgusting (I wish I could cite a parallel, but I'm not keen on toilet humor...).  While ""Lost in Space"" is typically pedestrian with its plotlines and a lot of its dialogue, I found this one to be surprisingly fun.  Even Will (think ""the original Wesley Crusher but isn't arrogant"" ) is well handled.  7/10

Princess of Space -- a typical outing despite having a decent premise.  It's not what I'd call innovative or adventurous, however.  5/10

Time Merchant - WOW!!!!  While it still has a few ""Lost in Space"" logic/dialogue issues, and don't forget the show is made for children in the mid-1960s, this one is actually fairly intelligently written and well handled.  (man, I wish more modern sci-fi would be as daring with its use of concepts...)  Especially for 1967.  Highly enjoyable and makes me grateful the series was allowed to run its final season to the end or else we wouldn't have gotten this one.  Best of all is a worthy twist:  Had Dr Smith not gone on board, the Robinsons would be in far worse trouble than anybody would have ever thought...  The actual revelation alone makes this episode a winner, but I can't really knock it in any way, shape, or form.  For LiS it's sublime and for general sci-fi for the time it's very ahead of its time.  10/10

The Promised Planet -- whew boy.  Another planet where the Robinsons have to engage shallow antisocial hippies.  This time it's not a gaggle of shiftless, selfish, bone-idle losers but kids who just want to dance all day in front of (or behind!) screens lit by a series of rotating colors.  Oooh, psychedelic man!  The excuse for this, folks?  The inhabitants of this planet can't grow old.  They need Will and Penny for a series of transfusions they think will allow them to grow old.  (it's poorly explained but I got the impression they were going to drain the kids of their blood, which is actually quite frightening as a concept, even if it is somewhat silly.  But those 2 minutes can't make up for 48 minutes of utter drivel.)  In a certain mindset (try being very drunk or stoned, and forgive me if I don't partake...) it might be passable but this one is a true low point.  And if you manage to sit through this one's ending unscathed, feel lucky.  And that stupid, uninspired ""acid trip"" music gets stuck in your head too and I doubt the writer had that in mind...  UGH!  Never mind the one kid's voice who sounds like a total geek and un-hip.  Worse, the one pudgy kid at the end who whines that he just wants to shave (!!!) tops it all as being the worst episode ever.  2/10  (why am I so generous? Because Dr Smith, as usual, is a hoot to watch!!  And, of course, the 2 minutes' worth of fear at the end.)

Fugitives in Space -- Surprisingly good, if a bit lax on details.  150 degrees would be a fatal temperature, to say the least...  There's some great makeup work however and the idea of Smith's and West's fellow captive that he can regenerate when killed must've been taken from ""Doctor Who"".  Nicely put into context for what it's worth, but it's still ""Lost in Space"".  Smith himself is very diabolical here and you have to wonder why the Robinsons would bother to keep him when he pulls really vile stunts like this...  definitely more akin to his early season 1  persona rather than his ultimate cowardly clumpish self.  6/10

Space Bounty -- Why look, CBS's answer to the venerable Harry Mudd (Farnum B) makes a return appearance!  While NOBODY tops Harry Mudd (except for possibly a certain Q), Farnum's always fun to watch.  If only there was a 4th season, how many more episodes would they contrive him into?  Smith forging Judy's name is what causes the hapless Robinson family to get wound up into Smith's shameless scheming this time.  7/10

The Flaming Planet -- as said by a flaming reviewer, this is a mixed bag.  There are some nice ideas present:  A dying race killed off by their own weaponary, the fantasy element of having somebody else take over (though WHY seems to be left unanswered), and a mutated life form that thinks Dr Smith is its daddy.  It's an oddball, but surprisingly enjoyable and the ending, by ""Lost in Space"" standards, is almost educational by its prompting kids to whip out the dictionaries to learn the big words presented.  :-)  7/10

The Great Vegetable Rebellion -- WHY DO PEOPLE HATE THIS STORY?!  No wonder Guy ""tripod"" Williams and June Lockhart were having troubles trying to conceal their giggling, this episode is one I'd actually introduce TO potential fans.  It's so novel, yet so off the wall and outrageously funny and knows, unlike many episodes from the previous seasons, how to work within its limitations and not end up looking dated, kitschy, or pastiche.  This one is genuine fun.  Never mind some double entendres that should have had the CBS execs pulling it from the airwaves (note the scene where Willoughby starts nibbling at leafy bits from Dr Smith (who had just been transmogrified into a gigantic stick of celery).  They really get away with a lot and I was unstoppably rolling once they started talking about seeds, good grief!!!)  This episode is a total riot to watch, and despite the behind-the-scenes issues it actually feels coherently put together.  10/10 and I'd rate it higher if I could!

Junkyard of Space -- notice the lack of Ms Lockhart and the general absense of Guy Williams.  They were written out of this one because of their behind-the-scenes antics in ""Vegetable Rebellion"".  It's got the potential to really be a gritty story, but for some reason it just seems average.  6/10

Ultimately, completists will buy this on the spot.  It's a fair release, epsecially for the price.  But there is some fun to be had in this 2nd and final set, moreso than in set 1 I'd discovered.  It's a 60s kids show, but in some ways it tries to transcend its limitations and be more).",1123200000,72,7064,4.647249190938512

I will miss Dr. Smith especially, then the Robot, followed by Will, Don, Penny, Maureen, Judy and last but not least, my favorite wooden actor Guy Williams. In these last episodes, the Jupiter 2 takes off and lands more times than all other episodes put together. (It seems like it anyway). We get to see more of the inside of the J2 (How to fit a chariot, a space pod, a downstairs that is as big as a house into a tiny spaceship.) And my favorites, the Jupiter 2 always landing in that perfect circle. Maureen asking if anyone wants more coffee. Dr. Smith doing the frug in a wig and beads was pretty ridiculous, but funny.

To the review who remarked about Princess of Space's problem. My DVD has that problem too....... In my opinion, this is just sloppy transfering from the film itself... The people who clean this stuff up must have not even bothered to watch the episode.

I noticed disc-1's episodes are poorer quality than the others for ghosting and such....... Since disc-1 is the only disc in Season 3 Volume-2 with 4 episodes, i'm assuming perhaps these discs are not made to hold 4 hours with good quality.

Lastly,

Am I crazy, or has Time Merchant had some stuff hacked out of it.

I have Time Merchant on video and the part where Smith is giving the Sgt his food order and the Sgt making yuck reactions were not on the DVD. Smith goes into detail as to what he wants to eat.

That's why, later when he hands over the bowl, they make a yuck face yet again.

However, I did notice in the Space Princess episode that, slightly before the beginning of the coronation scene, the transfer seems to slip at the left side of the screen, and subsequently, there is a vertical line that moves from the left to the center of the picture for a couple of minutes.

The end of the Lost in Space series is definitely schizophrenic. This volume starts out with the excellent ""Target: Earth"" where a group of uniform creatures want to learn to be individuals. Then we lurch over to ""Princess of Space"" where Penny is mistaken for a look-alike princess and computers with toupees march in battle. ""The Time Merchant"" was a great balance of fantasy and a great sci-fi story. ""The Flaming Planet"" had a decent story but the subplot about the radioactive plant was enough to curdle lunch milk a million miles away. ""Fugitives in Space"" was a different episode that actually felt fresh, despite the weird court they had. Enough has been said about the ""Talking Carrot"", so we won't even go there. And because of ""bad behavior"" from the filming of that episode, we rarely see Guy Williams or June Lockheart in this volume. Heck, even Judy is given a swan song in ""Space Beauty.""

I do have to take time out to mention ""The Promised Planet"". It is far from the best ever but it is one of my favorites mainly due to the absurdity of it all. Here, we feature a possible arrival to Alpha Control, which is actually kind of exciting to hear. Then we see where we are going, into a ""Space-a-Delic"" trance. We have the scary and horrific ""Penny Dance"", to Smith in a wig and lighting incense cones to the weird eye shaped signs on the doors. And Keith Taylor, the boy from ""Return from Outer Space"" is easily recognizable in this episodes and makes you wonder why Will doesn't recognize him. This episode is very dated yet a ton of fun.

Despite the ""schizophrenic"" and cheap feel to this volume and half of season 3, it is still a lot of fun. Jonathan Harris never once stopped putting zeal and fun into Smith. The stories tried to break the ""Smith, Will and Robot"" trio and they did try different things. If I can say one thing about this season, they took what the series became and did the best they could with it.

Could the series have been renewed for a 4th season? Sure it could have. The ratings were good and the good episodes far outweighed the bad in Season 3 but alas, it was never meant to be. I feel that this season, albeit short, was much better that Season 2 and if Season 2 had been like Season 3, Lost in Space would have easily been a 5-6 season show. We bid adieu and farewell to a great series and we can only hope we have a decent revival of the series on TV one day.",1122249600,36,2764,4.3301158301158305
2268791,5,B00096S47G,"I have been a fan of Lost in Space since I was a kid in the early to mid 70's as I caught the show in it's rerun cycle. Each and every week I tuned in with my family and we watched the episodes together. This will always be my all time favorite show. It's really nice also to have the complete series on dvd.

The color in these final nine episodes of LIS looks awesome and the extras are nice to see as well. I kind of wish there was more in the extras on the discs but having the complete series is good enough for me. Thank you Fox for releasing the remaining episodes. This comes highly recommended to all Irwin Allen, and Lost in Space fans out there.",1122076800,2,656,4.00763358778626

Of course as one matured, you realized how silly the whole thing was; however, out of the many series since, this one still brings me back to a time of innocense. As a child I sincerly looked forward to each episode. Belive me when I tell you, I watched every episode with anticipation! I attempted to have my children watch the series and enjoy it; however, it didn't go over well. I guess it was more for me than them and it really showed. Anyway, the Lost In Space series is more for 40 sometings than anyone else...",1121731200,11,628,4.285714285714286

8057754,5,B00096S47G,"The final 9 episodes of the series are contained in this set, and it includes all my favorites.  My top favorite episode is ""The Promised Planet"" where the Robinsons, thinking they've finally reached Alpha Centauri, land instead on a planet of space hippies who have a sinister hidden agenda.  Penny and Dr. Smith are seen go-go dancing, while Will Robinson tells his father to ""Split the scene, man!""  Guest stars include Gil Rogers (who later became the guitarist for Johnny Mathis) and Keith Taylor (who was also a semi-regular on the old Leave It To Beaver series).

Other favorite episodes in this set include Target Earth, Princess of Space, Time Merchant, Space Beauty, and The Great Vegetable Rebellion, among others.  Now, The Great Vegetable Rebellion has a reputation for being the silliest episode of them all with the talking carrot and Dr. Smith becoming a stalk of celery, but it's one of my personal favorites and I absolutely love it.

The final episode in the series is Junkyard In Space.  The family lands on a junkyard planet, presumably as the network junked the series.  At the end of the show, all turns out well as usual, but they're still lost in space.

If you love the series, you'll want to be sure to get these final episodes.  This is one of the earliest shows I remember watching as a child, and I'll always treasure it.",1461888000,4,1351,4.7106382978723405
