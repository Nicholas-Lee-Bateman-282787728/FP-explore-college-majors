6397140,2,B00JXNBXRE,"Blood Lake is exactly what I thought it would be, a crazy maelstrom of CGI critters, melodrama, and garden variety of two-dimensional characters. The story contains the same material as any other b-movie, creature feature currently playing on several genre channels on cable. Blood Lake does have a cool blend of nostalgia mixed in. There were moments that reminded me of the old Roger Corman Piranhas.

Blood Lake: Attack Of The Lampreys has a lot of missing components to the story. The acting and scenes are clunky at times, the characters never feel real or believable. There is an obvious lack of chemistry between some of the cast that shows on screen. Still Blood Lake does have a fun, cheese fest thing happening that, in spite of the CGI, manages to liven up the films mediocrity. Plus it was enough just to see Christopher Lloyd's rectal assault by the creatures, and Zack Ward is always nice to look at on screen.",1431216000,2,924,4.739130434782608

6397148,3,B00JXNBXRE,"I got sucked in again by Asylum.  How they can get name actors to appear in their schlock movies is a mystery to me, but they do.  And guppy s like me buy them hoping this is going to be the above average one.  This one is a bit different though, it has killer lamprey jumping everywhere.  They never explain where this particular violent breed of lamprey come from, but it doesn't matter because this is a different type of creature to devour us.  I lived up in the Great Lakes and Northern part of Michigan and I never saw a lamprey jump out of the water or wriggle across the ground, but hey I never saw a flying piranha or real dinosaur either.  They might have skipped a mayor wanting to over look the whole thing because it might interfere with the tourist season bit, that has really gotten old.  The film of course will entertain monster fans with a new type of monster.  Don't expect too much and you will get a kick out of the idea.",1407715200,,942,4.223463687150838
6397149,4,B00JXNBXRE,"I just got the movie yesterday and I really like the movie and I have been a big fan of The Asylum movies for a couple of years now. I'll tell ya what, even though it's not one of the best amongst the company's 2014 list of releases for this year, it's still a great movie to watch either on a rainy day or for a Friday night when you don't feel like going out and just staying home. This is also Asylum's first joint ventrure with Animal Planet. The acting is sub par (hey, it's a mockbuster, what do you want?) and yeah people are gonna rip this movie apart in the reviews but truth be told, The Asylum didn't create B-Rated flicks. They just reinnovated them. Christopher Loyd and Shannen Doherty do a good job with their parts. Not over the top but there were able to make the story interesting and they were able to get my attention and keep it throughout the movie. Anyway, a good movie, not bad, not great but good to have in your video library.",1407283200,5,952,4.2076502732240435
6397150,3,B00JXNBXRE,"This is an Asylum TV-14 movie and has all the bells and whistles associated with a low budget film which includes cardboard characters, characters poorly executed, CG graphics, and actors on their way down or taking a detour on their way up. In a small Michigan town, that looks like Long Beach, California, Fish and Game Ranger Michael Parker (Jason Brooks) and family are summoned there to take care of the lamprey eel nuisance. Michael also has to deal with a hormonal daughter (Ciara Hanna) a geeky son (Yar Koosha) only a stray dog (uncredited) and eel will play with, and a flirty neighbor (Susie Abromeit).

These are not your normal aggressive blood sucking lamprey's but ones that travel on land and seem to appear anywhere, almost like Ghost Shark. Yes people suffer bites, and a few succumb to their attacks.

This is for SyFy/Asylum bad movie fans only.",1406937600,5,865,4.798657718120805
6397151,1,B00JXNBXRE,"Yet another creature feature from Asylum, this time we see lampreys
(eel like marine creatures) running amok in a lake and killing people.
A heroic wildlife expert tries to stem the invasion, while at the same
time tussling with a grumpy town mayor who doesn't want to scare away
tourists. You can work out what happens yourself, I'm sure.

The problem with this movie is that it thinks people will be so
entertained by the concept of lampreys attacking that they will
overlook a LOT of bad movie making. This is a mistake. Viewers do care
about logic and common sense, but there's very little of that in Blood
Lake... The attack style of the lampreys is maddeningly inconsistent.
When a supporting character comes across a pack of them, the lampreys
attack and kill in seconds. Yet anytime one of the main cast members is
in peril, the lampreys just writhe around on the floor and give the
actors plenty of chances to escape.

Some examples: A woman is killed by lampreys invading her indoor pool,
but while she dies instantly, the two main cast members - who are also
fully in the water - are unscathed. A policeman turns up to help and he
falls in the pool. And then he dies instantly! Later on Shannon Doherty
and her daughter are searching a house. Shannon is suddenly trapped in
the shower with the cubicle door closed (why?) and dozens of lampreys
swarm the bathroom. The daughter and Shannon escape unharmed. Shannon's
young son is on the beach and finds a couple of bodies of strong
healthy adults who have died. The kid is about 10 years old and a bit
shrimpy. Lampreys attack him and of course only one of them even
manages to land a hit. The wildlife expert and his assistant enter a
flooded home swarming with lampreys where other people have been killed
in seconds. They each suffer one single lamprey bite each. Later still,
the young son is trapped in a room with a single window that is just
barely too high for him to reach. Although the room is chock full or
chairs, desks, tables and so on, he never tries to use anything to
climb up and reach the window. Meanwhile lampreys are busting out of
pipes and ducts all over the ceiling and dropping on the floor. Not one
of them manages to attack him. And most laughably of all, at the movies
climax, two of the main characters have a ""don't be a hero"" argument in
the middle of a sewer, full of the entire pack of squirming lampreys,
which patiently wriggle around them, without making a single leap, so
that the full dialogue can be played out in comfortable time. The on
screen effect is so bad, it makes it appear as though the characters
are surrounded by an invisible shield!

At no time does there ever seem to be a real threat to the main cast,
the film makes it glaringly obvious that they are all invincible. One
additional moment of ""heart stopping terror"" is provided by scenes with
people clutching onto or falling from a slightly wobbly ladder. Another
great moment is the revelation that lamprey livers will provide the
solution.

Watching this movie will make you as bored of spotting these examples
as I am of writing them down. The acting is not good
either...especially the shrimpy son and the wailing daughter. Shannon
Doherty and Jason Brooks do okay in the lead roles but it's a shame to
see screen legend Christopher Lloyd stooping to such lows as this. All
the lamprey effects are poorly conceived CGI, and none of the wounds on
any of the actors look real. Films like this are like the new b-movies
of the 1950s. They seem a lot glossier now, but in reality they are
still as cheap and as rushed out as ""The Giant Claw"" and ""Plan 9 From
Outer Space"".",1406937600,9,3640,4.502269288956127
6397152,4,B00JXNBXRE,"Attack of the killer lampreys.  I admit I had to look them up because I thought they were fake monsters.  They're real, they're jawless fish sometimes called lamprey eels.  A small percentage of them are considered parasitic blood suckers.  They are edible.  Nothing says ""I win"" like eating something that can bite back.  In this case, they're voracious CGI bloodsuckers on the loose in a small community that relies heavily on the tourist trade.  When they get out of hand, a park employee (Zack Ward) calls for backup from a fish and game expert (Jason Brooks), who drags his entire family on location (Shannen Doherty plays his wife), then promptly ignores them.  Christopher Lloyd plays the mayor.  His only interest is keeping the tourists happy; he doesn't see a problem with a few lampreys popping up in unexpected places.  He also doesn't care about the dead people that have started to pile up.  He's a stock villain doing exactly what you'd expect, because they're trying to follow the same basic formula used in Jaws and Piranha.  None of the actors/characters rises about the parts they're playing.  This is horror by the numbers, everything is calculated purely for effect (and in that arena, they succeed).  But it's a sad commentary when the dead and dying show more life than the living do as they rush about aimlessly trying to survive the incredible onslaught of lampreys that wriggle through pipes and toilets as well as jump dams and wriggle across the landscape.  It's preposterous but it's also great fun.  It's the type of mindless horror movie that you can watch repeatedly just for the gore and carnage and consider yourself well entertained in the bargain.  In that regard, it's adequate.  It does the job it sets out to do without worry that it will be mistaken for art.  High marks for the action sequences, low marks for the forgettable characters/actors barely doing their job.",1406851200,,1908,4.869565217391305
6397153,4,B00JXNBXRE,"Blood Lake was a fun SyFy channel type of creature attack flick with better than average special effects for this type of film. It had a nice ensemble cast and some cheese appeal as well.

I'm not a Shannen Doherty fan but she was good in her role as wife and mother of the per usual fish and game specialist sent to see why the snake like Lampreys are terrorizing people in the water. These things go wild and will attack and enter any orifice that is available and I do mean ""any orifice""!!

It's nice and bloody with some pretty good gore scenes and an entertaining movie altogether. I certainly wasn't bored and actually cared about what happened to the main characters.",1405987200,8,674,4.471544715447155
