2061849,4,B00024769M,"Sweeping, epic, historical, brutal, haunting, hopeful and tragic, just a few adjectives that describe this beautiful film.  A doctor, collecting blood samples from prisoners gets an in depth look at life at Carandiru as he befriends and treats many of them.  Also, in flashbacks, shows how some ended up behind bars, guilty or innocent.  All leads up to the storming of the riot squad that killed 111 inmates.  Great acting and directing with gritty cinematography as well!",1107302400,,473,5.103896103896104
2061850,4,B00024769M,"2 of the best movies I've seen in the last year both happen to come from Brazil, ""City of God"" and ""Carandiru."" Both have moments of extreme violence but that doesn't take anything away from either. While ""City of God"" received enormous praise both in Brazil and in the U.S. ""Carandiru"" kinda slipped under the radar, at least here in the States. Carandiru refers to the now demolished prison in Brazil and Latin America's largest city, Sao Paulo, which in turn made Carandiru the most overpopulated and violent prison on that continent. More eloborate reviews are posted here on amazon so I'll only say this is possibly the best prison movie ever. It certainly isn't your average prison movie fare. Of course there are some extremely violent scenes depicting what goes on in prison, but it is less a prison/crime movie and more of a straight ahead drama. The differences between prisons here and in Brazil are there. Although both have drugs and open drug use, here drugs are openly used in front of the doctor and guards which I don't think would occur too much in an American prison. There is a scene where ""Highness"" is packaging so much crack, the scene where he gets bit by the rat trying to statsh in the floor, I thought he was in the street and not in prison. Of course I'm not an expert on the subject but i doubt if American prisoners have THAT much crack at one sitting, unless they are John Gotti. Crack also seemed to be the drug of choice in Carandiru and I'm sure crack makes it ways into U.S. jails but not nearly as much as weed and heroin. Perhaps crack caught on later than it did here at home. All in all this is an amazing movie and sure the violence and degradation of prison life will turn some people off but if given a chance this is easily one of the best dramas I've seen in years. Excellant job done by all parties here from the director to the actors to the casting directors. Orbigado por Carandiru!",1103414400,,1930,4.454802259887006
2061851,4,B00024769M,"In Sao Paolo, Brazil, there used to be a prison named Carandiru, which was torn down in 2002.  Despite the fact that the Carandiru prison no longer exists, its haunting history cannot escape the audience.  It is through Hector Babenco's direction the audience can view the brutality that took place an October day in 1992 when 300 police officers massacred 111 inmates.  This dramatization is based on true events, and it is told through the testimony of a physician who worked in the prison before the riots lead to the carnage.

The story follows Dr. Varella who arrives to the prison to investigate AIDS and HIV, which was a rather new disease at the time.  Through Dr. Varella the audience gets to meet a number of characters with diverse pasts, and how they ended up in Carandiru.  Most of them are criminals in one way or another, however, their stories bring humanity to the dire prison.  The stories depict the convicts' feelings and their lives in the prison as they have to adjust to the life in the overcrowded penitentiary.  It is the struggle for an ordinary life in the jail that becomes the focus of the film, which also enhances the revolting behavior of the police force.

The depicted humanity magnifies the violence that is brought to the Carandiru through the 300 police officers that stormed the jail with assault rifles.  This is reinforced through survivors of the bloody assault as they sit in on interviews in which they disclose their feeling in regards to what happened.  However, Babenco does not reach the same level with Carandiru as he did with Pixote when it was released in the early 80s.  The main reason is that the film feels somewhat staged as some scenes become slightly awkward unlike the rough depiction of Pixote.  Regardless of having a staged atmosphere Carandiru offers a terrific cinematic experience, which will offer deliberate reflection upon injustice as the police force was not charged for anything after having murdered 111 inmates of Carandiru.",1100044800,11,1997,4.872781065088757

2061854,5,B00024769M,"CARANDIRU is in every sense of the term an Epic film: based on a novel by a physician who wrote of his experiences in the largest prison in South America (Carandiru housed 7000 inmates in Sao Paulo, Brazil before its implosion in 2002), it documents the barely known Carandiru Massacre of 1992; it examines the individual lives, psyches, and social behaviors of prisoners in a vastly more comprehensive manner than any other film about prisons; it captures on film the squalor and tragedy and even comedy of a segregated male population who must find a means to live despite the deprivation of prison life.  Hector Babenco ('Pixote', 'Kiss of the Spider Woman', etc) has written a screenplay based on the novel 'Esatacao Carandiru' by Drauzio Varella, the physician who was drawn into the drama of Carandiru after his initial academic foray into gathering blood samples from the prisoners for his work on the epidemiology of AIDS.  As portrayed with great tenderness by Luis Carlos Vasconcelos, the doctor becomes father confessor to the men within the squalid walls of Carandiru, gradually unveiling the secret pasts of the prisoners - their backgrounds, their reasons for incarceration, their modes of behavioral adaptation to life in the vast structures of Carandiru.  Babenco has cast this enormous crew of prisoners with actors who are so fine that they offer some of the finest character cameos on film: Ivan de Almeida ('Ebony') is the prisoner gatekeeper who wisely controls the comings and goings of the men; Lazaro Ramos ('Ezequiel') is but one of the drug addicts whose dependence on drugs is far from his pre-prison life as a well-known surfer; Caio Blat ('Deusdete') and Wagner Maura ('Zico') grew up as orphaned brothers only to be joined later by separate crimes as roommates in Carandiru; Milton Goncalves ('Chico') provides the doctor with first-class medical assistance while falling in love with ( and marrying) 'Lady Di' (in a breakthrough role of the gifted actor Rodrigo Santoro, whose roles in 'The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone', 'Behind the Sun', and even 'Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle' show promise of a very important screen presence), and many, many more.  The cast includes both female and male actors (Carandiru has visiting days when families can see the prisoners) and without exception, each role is etched into the canvas that is Carandiru in an extraordinary fashion. The point of the film seems to be a prelude to the last thirty minutes that very graphically depicts  the riot and massacre of 111 prisoners by the prison's riot squad.  But it is the scope of humanity examined by Babenco that creates our identification with the victims and survivors of this tragedy. Extra features on the DVD include deleted scenes, each of which  is so fine that it seems a shame they landed on the cutting room floor, and a series of scenes being filmed showing Babenco in action as a director - certainly some of the more tender interactions between directors and actors on film as well as an insight into the way in which directors communicate their vision (and achieve it) through the filming process.  There are also interviews with author Varella who has important asides about the adaptation of his book

The musical score is hauntingly appropriate, the camera work is some of the best you'll see in today's cinema, and the overall effect after the film is over is one of awe and respect for the director and the actors and the indictment of prison life to which we rarely have access.

2061861,4,B00024769M,"Carandiru is a Brazillian film about the famous prison in Sao Paulo (now destroyed) where a riot back in the early 90's led to the police storming the facility and killing over 100 prisoners in (if the movie is accurate) cold blood.

At two hours and 20 minutes, Carandiru is maybe a little too long, but still very good.

Carandiru starts with a doctor arriving at the prison to test and treat the prisoners for AIDS and TB and then through flashback vignettes, we learn about the prisoners and how they wound up in the prison. Naturally, we find out they're not all such bad people and in the case of at least one inmate, we witness his eventual redemption. After this particular inmate is unable to take part in the gang murder of a fellow prisoner who didn't follow the prison's unwritten ""rules"" on how to settle a personal dispute, he's tormented with dreams and nightmares of his past and visions of the inmate he couldn't help kill. He can't sleep and he goes to talk to the doctor and he asks what's happening to him and why he's changing. He tells the doctor that killing is all he's ever done and all he knows. The doctor tells him that he's feeling guilt and the prisoner asks, ""Is there any cure for guilt?"". A little simplistic recap, but I liked the question and the character's eventual path.

2061863,4,B00024769M,"One could easily get the wrong impression of the storyline here. Yes, it is based on the true-life massacre at the Brazilian prison in 1992 BUT that story is only shown in the last 30 minutes of this 145-miniute film.

The movie is really about the people who inhabited that prison back in that time. There are short profiles of numerous criminals, told through the eyes mainly of a doctor who is sent there. AIDs was a major problem in the jail. The doctor treats a lot of people who then tell him stories how they got to be inmates at Carandiru. In addition, there are bunch of scenes in which the inmates interact among themselves, shown as everything from antagonists to lovers.

Make no mistake: some of the stories are sordid, but its not as unpleasant to watch as one might think because the characters and the film-making are very interesting. The storyline moves fast, which is important considering the length of this film.

A viewer could even stop the movie at several points, pick up later without losing much since the story unfolds in segments. The ending (the massacre) really comes on suddenly. Unlike most movies,the story doesn't build up to the climax, here it just appears out of nowhere.

2061865,5,B00024769M,"Built in 1928 to hold 4,000 prisoners, the Carandiru House of Detention in Sao Paulo housed 7,500 violent criminals and was the largest prison in Latin America. That was before it was closed and then demolished in late 2002, ten years after government troops stormed the prison in October 1992 and killed 111 inmates after a riot had broken out. Not a single police died, and as the film portrays it the prisoners had thrown their weapons out the barred windows and waved white flags. Based on these real life events, the film traces the violent prison subculture, the stories of several inmates (through extensive use of flashbacks), and especially the role played by the humanitarian prison doctor, Drauzio Varella, who volunteered his services for fourteen years after visiting the prison for AIDS research. He later wrote a memoir about his experiences, Carandiru Station, which forms the basis of the film. The film culminates in the riot, features the actual footage when it was demolished by dynamite in December 2002, and incorporates interviews with prisoners who survived the massacre. This film is not for weak stomachs; it is an unsettling commentary on the Darwinian subculture and institutionalized inhumanity inside our worst prisons.

2061866,4,B00024769M,"This is much more than a prison riot film. In fact, the entire first two hours are spent exploring the lives and back stories of a select group of prisoners. Using a technique that will be familiar to viewers of the HBO series ""Oz"", we follow each of the prisoners in flashback through the series of events that led to their imprisonment.  We also come to know what level of status (or lack of it) they each hold within the prison pecking order.

The result is for the most part a detailed portrait of daily life at Carandiru -- rivalries, loyalties, fights, love affairs, drug abuse, and murder -- along with a portrayal of the warden and his staff that is unexpectedly sympathetic.

It is worth noting that, while the conditions inside are certainly filthy and deplorable, the prisoners enjoy a surprising amount of freedom compared to similar facilities in the States. What surprised me most is a ""family day"" that is held each year where parents, wives, girlfriends, and children come to mingle throughout the facility with their jailed loved ones. Families picnic together and couples enjoy conjugal visits.

When the riot eventually does break out, it is not simply because the prisoners are rebelling against the poor conditions .. it is also because of one or more events that take place. (Nobody is quite capable of saying exactly which event or combination of them.) What is far more clear is the brutality shown by the police riot squad as it takes control of the facility once the prisoners have surrendered their weapons. Blood literally runs through the hallways and down the stairwells. Having come to know many of the prisoners as people makes these scenes very difficult to watch.

Overall this is an excellent movie, although anyone expecting 2-1/2 hours of hostage-taking and violence will be disappointed by its insistence on first taking the measure of the prisoners' humanity.",1160352000,20,1898,4.900311526479751

On October 2, 1992, a riot broke out at the Sao Paolo House of Detention in Carandiru, Brazil.  By the end of that day, 111 prisoners lay dead, the victims of the riot police who stormed the facility and brutally massacred them - even after they`d surrendered their weapons.

Perhaps the most striking aspect about ""Carandiru"" is that it doesn't hit us over the head with its subject matter - at least not initially, that is.  For roughly the first two-thirds of its nearly two-and-a-half-hour running time, the film focuses on the lives and struggles of the prisoners, as seen through the eyes of the compassionate doctor whose book on the subject served as the basis for the film.  Without passing moral judgment, Dr. Drauzio Varella, who has been sent there mainly to help stem the spread of AIDS in the facility,

 listens sympathetically to the stories the men tell regarding the crimes they committed (mainly murder) which led to their incarceration (these we see acted out in numerous flashback sequences).  Although the prison is tremendously overcrowded and drug use and disease run rampant through the corridors, the conditions don't appear to be quite as harsh or hellish as we might have expected them to be before seeing the movie.  For one thing, the men seem to be treated rather decently by the guards - who seem to exist in surprisingly small numbers, actually - and the prisoners appear to have more freedom to walk around and interact with one another than we are used to seeing in American prisons (or, at least, in movies about American prisons).  In fact, so much time is spent exploring the relationship problems between the men in their prisons and their loved ones on the outside that ""Carandiru"" often feels more like a ""novela"" set behind bars than a gritty depiction of life in a human hellhole.

But all that changes in the last half hour of the film after the riot has begun and we see the prisoners gunned down in cold blood, many of them while cowering in their cells.  It is a brutal and terrifying display of raw, inhuman savagery, one that far surpasses anything we have seen perpetrated by the prisoners themselves.  However, writer/director Hector Babenco (along with co-authors Fernando Bonassi and Victor Navas) does not attempt to sanctify or glorify the convicts either, for much of what they do to their fellow human beings is not too many moral steps removed from what the riot squad members eventually do to them.  Although the filmmakers' sympathies clearly lie with the prisoners, who are at least presented to us as flawed, three-dimensional human beings, he is not afraid to show the evil side of these men when he needs to as well.  The acts of violence that the prisoners perpetrate on their victims and each other are conveyed by the filmmaker with a dispassionate efficiency and awe-inspiring swiftness that are indeed chilling.

As a drama, ""Carandiru"" could have benefited from a bit of tightening in its earlier stretches, for the film feels a trifle unfocused and meandering at times.  Still, by concentrating so intently on the everyday minutiae of these men's lives in prison, Babenco certainly helps the characters to become more real for the viewer, thereby intensifying the sense of loss when the tragedy occurs.

Blessed with a large and gifted cast, ""Carandiru"" offers a long, sometimes touching, sometimes painful look into a world and an event that would otherwise have remained hidden from the eyes of the world.",1120435200,6,3486,4.879661016949153
2061872,5,B00024769M,"Carandiru is now an inexistent symbol and the prize for its demolition was extremely high. It required 111 human beings, a cipher if you want minuscule compared with a front of War, but not less important if you think about a prison with seven thousand and a half recluses, living under infrahuman conditions.

Hector Babenco, the same responsible for Pixote, decide to bet for a  documental approach, this long introduction allow the viewer to know the minimum insights of that prison, told by every prisoner without restrictions in the two thirds parts of the picture. The human sensitivity, the singleness of the prisoners, his deviations, different levels of blame, had in common that crude word so easy to say and so hard to repeat: lack of affection in their childhood.

The favelas (humble homes of Rio) are undeniably, the huge seed that will produce hundred and even thousand of unknown stories so far from us, but so easy to imagine. In those no man land, these children will suffer the worst calamities and unexpected humiliations and abuses of any nature.

This cyclic state of things can be perceived in a great portion of South America. The growing population, the common denominator social: families without the father presence, the eternal condition of promiscuity from the early ages establishes by itself a style of life that is seen as normal in that social status. The childhood losses its charm and the imagination is replaced by the surviving game no matter how the prize be. Live or die in the unspoken consign, and the death, drugs, sexual deformations, and the loss of the real love feeling plus any kind of subterfuge that allows you to live until the next day is valid. No rules, no pain, no hopes. Live for the present and nothing else matters. In this sense underdevelopment can be defined as the unablity to transformation.

This valiant and impressive picture requires from you all the required attention. The facts will lead to the violence; I mean, the violence is not by itself the initial spark, the spectacle circus  to tell the story but the life itself, that as many of us know has a more vivid and fertile imagination than the best fiction writer or social journalist can presage.

There isn't much interpretation to this movie other to say it grabs you from the start conveying reasons inmates entered the Carandiru detention center.  The director does an excellent job picking out a powerful person inside the prison to hear and perhaps help these inmates.  With that being said, we get an opportunity to learn why and how these inmates committed there crimes.  I actually expected to see the corrupt nature of prison life in Brazil, but unfortunately that wasn't what this movie was about. This movie was well crafted taking us inside the prison almost forcing the viewer to show sympathy for certain inmates.  Obviously the ending of this film was surprisingly brutal,bloody, and very disturbing.  Yet another great Brazilian film depicting how corrupt law enforcement is operating in Third World Countries. Autobus 187 compliments this movie...however BUS 187 takes place in Rio.  Scene after scene throughout this movie kept me in anticipation of what to come next.  Furthermore I was actually sympathetic and sorrowful for the conditions these prisoners faced.

2061874,4,B00024769M,"""On October 2, 1992, 111 men died at the Sao Paulo Detention Center Carandiru. There were no police deaths. The only ones that know what really happened are God, the police and the inmates. I only heard the latter"". That is the way in which the director of this film, Hctor Babenco, ends his movie. OK, now you already know the end of ""Carandiru"". But what is the movie about?. That is the real issue, and what you will discover if you watch it.

In my opinion, this film tries to depict jail life, from the point of view of the inmates, their families, the guards and a doctor (Luiz Carlos Vasconcelos) who worked at Carandiru as part of an AIDS' prevention programme. The doctor says that at Carandiru ""I heard stories, made real friends, learned medicine and penetrated a few of the mysteries of life in jail which would have remained inaccessible were I not a doctor"". As spectators of this film, we are also allowed to learn what he learns, and to listen to the different stories the inmates tell him, specially regarding how they ended up in jail. Some reflections of the inmates were also quite interesting, for example when one of them says that the best thing about jail is to get out of it.

The film also depicts the Carandiru massacre, at least one version of it. The scenes that show the repression are remarkably brutal, and there is a point when blood seems to be everywhere. How much of what this film tells is true, and how much is fiction is something we will never know. Nonetheless, this version of the events had enough weight to convince the director...

Did I like this movie?. Yes, but I don't think this is the kind of movie everybody will want to watch, and it isn't a film I would purchase. ""Carandiru"" has many violent scenes, explicit language and a dark atmosphere that pervades almost every moment in the movie. Despite that, I don't regret watching it, because it is a well-made movie on a subject I knew nothing about. On the whole, recommended... ""Carandiru"" isn't the kind of movie I would like to watch many times, but I think you will miss something if you don't watch it at least once.

The story is told, for the most part, in linear fashion, with a few flashbacks for each individual prisoner so we get a better look at their lives before they were in prison, and what put them there.  Each story is different, and interesting.  The problem wasn't with the flashbacks, however, it was with how they were presented.  In fact, I think thats my main problem with this whole movie, is its presentation of the events.  I feel it could have been more powerful and far more effective to start in the middle, with the Doctor leaving the soccer game and then on to the riot--how it escelated to the level that it did, and what happened in the time between the start of the riot and the final massacre by the Brazilian police.  In that time between, sort of which was the set-up of City of God, there could have been flashbacks that described the characters and their actions.  One thing that bothered me was they dialogue between the characters and the doctor.  None of it seemed true.  Sure, people would open up to a Doctor that they trust, but something in the blatant way the prisoners so individualy just came up and started confessing to the Doctor didn't hit home with me, and seemed kind of false.  The same goes for the interviews by the prisoners during the riot scenes.  For the most part, I don't think they were necessary.  Instead, perhaps, the Doctor's character (I forget his name) could have been a constant narrator, and not just a narrator whose voice is heard occasionally, as was the case.

Well, to make a long review longer, this movie had promise but was poorly excecuted to me.  Just because a movie has a powerful message doesn't mean its always a good movie (see Gus Van Sant's attrocious ""Elephant"" for a prime example of that).  Still, the acting and directing, and the actual events, may make this film worth watching at least once.  However, for a more styalized yet still accurate look at the violence and corruption that exists between Brazil's police and citizens, City of God is your best choice.",1108080000,2,2470,4.572727272727272

8021951,3,B00024769M,"Vivid account of life in the Sao Paulo Detention Centre as seen through the eyes of a doctor (Vasconcelos) who is attending the facility to promote AIDS awareness and prevention to the prisoners.  Film has an unexpected sense of humour that seems at odds with the brutal and horrific conditions on display, but due to the talent in front of, and behind, the camera, still has moments of power; culminating with the violent assault by the Police Riot Squad that left 111 inmates dead in 1992.  10 years later the Centre was closed, and finally demolished.  Definitely worth a look if you can handle the subject matter.
