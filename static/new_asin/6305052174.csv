Hong Kong singer/actor/superstar Andy Lau stars as Lee Rock, a real life person who was one of the Hong Kong Police most corrupt policeman in the 60s. This story traces his past as a wide eyed honest rookie to becoming one of the dirtiest cops in the department.
The movie makes him out to be a sort of a good guy who was forced under circumstances to turn bad but he actually has a good heart. While the real life Lee Rock was probably an all out bad guy, Lau plays him as a very sympathetic figure.
As a standard Hong Kong movie, the movie has very good gun fight scenes. The story was not bad and the action sequences were just as good. Definitely a must buy if you are into Hong Kong movies.",986342400,,753,4.094594594594595
