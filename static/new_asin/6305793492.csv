7894713,4,6305793492,"All of Billy Chongs movies are very good. The movie is about a young man who like a lot of others are happy the Ching dynasty is through. He works in a hotel/restaurant for his father. A man comes in who has betrayed the Chings(who are trying to regain the country). The young man eventually goes in search of the man because of his admiration for him. In the process he meets up with a tough young woman who keeps and trains eagles and who desperately wants to marry him and keeps following him around. The young man after some time meets up with the man he has been searching for and recieves some martial arts training from him.
The young man must eventually stand up and fight the head Ching loyalists with the help of the young woman and the man. I honestly think Billy Chong and all of his movies are highly underrated. I think his movies are some of the best independant kung fu movies around. This movie is very good in my opinion like the rest.",1035936000,,953,4.3

A lot of action, and some good fight scenes, but not much  more then that.  The highlight of the movie is the very talented and  acrobatic master in hiding.  not a must see, but you can definately do a  lot worse.",967334400,,445,4.556962025316456
