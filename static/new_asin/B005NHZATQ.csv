4847704,2,B005NHZATQ,"It does not get just 1 star only because I respect its originality. The acting is really awkward, and not in indie/arty way, but borderline plain bad. The main 2 actors (she also wrote & directed it I think) are always a bit like that, but just did not work for me this time. The rhythm was also off and too slow. I think that most people, who are not French & homesick or cinema majors, should spend their time on something else.",1427068800,3,430,4.192771084337349

4847706,5,B005NHZATQ,"I love Valerie Donzelli! She always manages to make original, lighthearted and hilarious films that aren't like any other film around. In each one of her films she just has the best ideas and you can feel she is having fun while she directs, writes and acts in them. Queen of Hearts is no exception and its a big testament to the fact that good films can be made regardless of the budget (you just have to be as inventive, energetic and fresh as Donzelli and her team). This film is just such a delight to watch that I keep rewatching it every once in a while. Highly recommended, along with all her other films!",1407283200,,612,4.3304347826086955
4847707,4,B005NHZATQ,"Breakup movies are often very much the same: the main character suffers from a broken heart, can't go over her ex, and we can usually predict how it plays out in the end. The Queen of Hearts is no exception to this stereotype, but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable. This French gem also has a unique take on the genre that winds up making it stand out miles from films toting similar plots.

Adle (played by director/co-writer Valrie Donzelli) suffered a painful breakup, comically played out in the opening scene. She cries for days, that is until her friend (Luca Snchez) gives her some sedatives and leaves her on a park bench. There is also a cute opening sequence showing Adle in numerous other unfortunate situations which, while maybe seeming a bit pretentious at first, really serves as introducing us to the quirky Adle.

Things really took an unexpected twist for me when the first song broke out. Not knowing much about the film before watching, this aspect caught me off guard. The already offbeat movie got a little more peculiar with this, but it does it consistently which keeps it from getting too far out of hand. The songs, which are in French, sound great and the lyrics are shockingly funny. While I'm typically not a huge fan of musicals, it's not overdone here and keeps up the vibe of the rest of the film.

As mentioned, the story itself at its core isn't anything we haven't seen before. The film manages to take the overused plot however, and make it interesting and hilariously unique. Adle ends up staying with her cousin, Rachel (Batrice De Stal), who convinces her to get over her heartbreak by seeing other men. Adle does this, leading her on an adventure of unusual, funny, and creepy encounters. I don't want to give away a certain detail relating to these encounters, but when I found out (hint: watch the ending credits if you don't pick up on it right away) it made it all the more funny and at the same time illuminating.

I really have to hand it to Valrie Donzelli. She had the incredibly difficult job of both directing and starring, and ends up pulling off both spectacularly. As Adle she is lovable, silly, and undoubtedly human. It's no surprise Donzelli wrote the part relating to herself, as the she seems very natural in the role. I hope to see more of this multi-talented mademoiselle both in front of and behind the camera as she emits a welcomed charm through both.

I couldn't help but want to compare this film to Amlie. Aside from being French, they both feature zany and cute female leads and equally unique styles. I was pleased that The Queen of Hearts strayed from being an Amlie knockoff. The film manages to avoid falling into the trap that so many do, which is getting itself pigeonholed by either not being original enough, or trying too hard to be avant-garde that it appears too similar to others doing the same. I found myself really caring about Adle and how her story would end, even when I already had an idea from the beginning. How it's played out is wildly hilarious, but also at the same time real and emotional. The Queen of Hearts is a fine example of a conventional story told in an unconventional way.

4847708,5,B005NHZATQ,"Who said a break-up was sad and painful? Definitely Not Adele!
Queen of hearts is a fresh, light comedy. Unpretentious and entertaining, I really enjoyed Donzelli's sincerity and her complicity with Jeremie Elkaim. Funny and pleasantly crazy, Queen of Hearts is a pure moment of happiness. I highly recommend it!",1336435200,2,312,5.26
4847709,5,B005NHZATQ,"It's always so great to see directors who write (in this case co-write) their own film and star in it as well, especially when they pull it off.  You get a real sense of the story when the director is behind the whole vision.  One of the greatest aspects of Queen of Hearts was seeing the four love interests being played by the same actor, Jrmie Elkam, who gave such different personalities and awesome performances for each Mathieu, Pierre, Jacques, and Paul.  Valrie Donzelli's character, Adle, is all over the place with love and she plays it with that great type of dramatic post-relationship female energy that is not too far from the truth of the real emotional rollercoaster that life is.  She puts the fun French spin on the crazy crashes and attractions between men and women and when the plot's situation gets a bit wild at the end, it was hard not to get a kick out of it.  It's romantically entertaining for sure.",1333584000,6,926,4.554216867469879

4847711,1,B005NHZATQ,"Really terrible waste of time, another example of French men's sophomoric attitude towards women and sex.  Especially disappointing because the actors and actresses are quite good.",1454457600,,180,5.923076923076923
4847712,5,B005NHZATQ,"I really enjoyed this movie, but I do tend to appreciate independent character based films more than big Hollywood blockbusters. This is a very sweet self-love story with the perfect touch of humor that sets a nice tone.",1452297600,2,220,4.815789473684211
4847713,4,B005NHZATQ,"Really funny...and a terribly accurate female perspective of a major break-up! I would have given it 5 *s, however:  Although the 'love' scenes were peppered with obvious humor...still a bit graphic for my prudish eyes. I felt the acting was perfect for this campy yet sophisticated romatic(?) comedy!",1444780800,2,301,5.270833333333333

8480511,5,B005NHZATQ,"Lovely movie on woman after a bad break-up and how all the men she dates look like ""her ex"" until she breaks the emotional hold, and once she does, only then she can ""see clearly"" and appreciate those who do really love her :-)",1493769600,2,227,4.181818181818182
8480512,4,B005NHZATQ,"A very good job by the writer/director/actress who put this thing together. She seems to enjoy toying with our notions of promiscuous Parisian women and comes up with a French rom-com that is much more enjoyable than the American variety. Be sure to read the credits after the film, They clarified something that had only begun to dawn on me near the end, about the time she goes to New York.",1493596800,,392,4.535211267605634

There are some weird character-bursts-into-song moments. There are some werid character-bursts-into-dance moments. The guys she sleeps with are the same guy as her ex . . . until she ""breaks the emotional hold"". Again just garbage.",1473724800,4,503,4.715909090909091

I have never seen a movie like this, and I love artsy/indie films with offbeat female leads. It is original and engaging. Also, for anyone who has spent time living in Paris, you will love this as it shows some familiar locations that will bring back fond memories. I will definitely be watching this movie again, it is one of those films you can revisit.",1466035200,4,489,4.632183908045977
