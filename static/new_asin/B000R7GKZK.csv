8199142,5,B000R7GKZK,This is the Ralph Gleason/Dave Brubeck Jazz Casual dvd with the addition of Emily played in concert by Desmond and 3 tracks (possibly from another Jazz Casual?) by the Shorty Rogers Group.  The music is great but the old wine/new bottle concept should have been mentioned.,1245628800,10,272,4.913043478260869
8199143,5,B000R7GKZK,"After 40 years listening to Brubeck/Desmond, it was a unique experience  discovering the fundamentals and energy that moved these marvelous musicians in search of innovation. Brubeck's leadership, research, incredible capacity of playing with rythms; Desmond's unique sound and melody that makes his improvisations ""live"" compositons. More than just seeing the performances by the original groups, the interview with Brubeck sets the stage to understanding what and why you hear! I'm very happy to have found this historical recording.",1245110400,6,535,5.858974358974359
