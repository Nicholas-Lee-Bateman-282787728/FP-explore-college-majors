Dislike only the background sound, was to loud and in occasions unable to hear what they say. No close caption.
I recommend this product to any person who enjoy this type of production/s.",1377734400,,267,4.702127659574468

5563530,5,B00B8ZKLYQ,"El Capo 2 it's a good drama kind of boring but it is understandable I don't have problem with that.
One thing i don't agree if you use Mexicans wannabe be sure they know what they are saying because sound ridiculous their dialog and some time offensive.
The price for this package is affordable, service and delivery excellent",1362960000,3,326,4.637931034482759
5563531,5,B00B8ZKLYQ,"My feedback is just about the physical product itself to help Amazon users decide if they want to buy this DVD set. This feedback is not a critique about the series itself, El Capo 2. Obviously, I'm a fan of the show or I wouldn't have bought the DVD set.

My first impression is that this DVD set is an import. The DVDs play smoothly, here in the USA, on my computers (Mac and PC) and in my 2009 DVD player. These DVDs don't have standard U.S. copyright warnings, but they do have RCN (Colombian television network)and Fox Telecolombia copyright markings. While I could always be wrong, the RCN and Fox Telecolombia copyright markings lead me to believe these DVDs are authentic and not pirated.

1- This is El Capo 2. The sequel to the 90-episode series, El Capo.
2- There are 10 DVDs in total, one box set.
3- There are 76 episodes total.
4- There are NO subtitles. This series is entirely in Spanish, so you must be a Spanish language speaker or understand Spanish to be able to follow it.

All in all, I'm satisfied with the product.",1361923200,13,1038,4.424083769633508

8564345,1,B00B8ZKLYQ,"WARNING TO BUYERS!  this product is advertised as being zone 1 (US) but i was shipped a ""multi zone"" DVD set and when i tried to play it in 2 different windows 7 PC DVD drives not only did they not play but they TRASHED the driver software/BIOS and the registry entry for the DVD drive making the drive unusable. It took me 4 hours to repair them (had to replace the BIOS). Beware. Do not try to view this product unless your copy in the tiny print on the back shows ""zone/region code 1"".
Other reviewers found that the product played in the US so I suspect that the seller provided amazon with a mix of zone products and some got the zone 1 (as advertised) and i got one of the others.",1412899200,,686,4.119402985074627
