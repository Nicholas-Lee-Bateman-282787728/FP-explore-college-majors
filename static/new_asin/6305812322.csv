1078703,5,6305812322,"Dottie Perez (Marisa Tomei) shines in this highly entertaining film.  Both Juan Perez (Alfred Molina) and Dottie (strangers to one another) leave Cuba in a boatlift to come to the USA.  Though they have separate agendas, they both become entangled in a creative plot that would  convince immigration to boost their names to the top of the list for families to be sponsored.  In the meantime, Juan searches for his wife and child who he hasn't seen for 20 years.  Dottie, on the other hand, floats around with naivety about life in the Americas. Unaware that her beloved movie star is dead, she lights up with the anticipation of finally seeing John Wayne after she spots a sign for Hollywood some miles away.  I was almost rolling on the floor when both Dottie and Juan realized the status of Elvis Presley and John Wayne.
I like that the film catches sincere moments; for instance, we see Tomei heating up the screen in her sexy dresses and unshaved underarm, and Juan even expresses that he's been in prison so long, his teeth are no good to kiss his beloved wife. All the characters add warmth and humor to this highly charged movie.  Definitely a keeper.  Don't miss it!",1067731200,7,1174,4.63768115942029
1078704,4,6305812322,"It's a shame this movie never did very well at the box office, because it's a movie with great performances by Marisa Tomei and Alfred Molina.  It's also directed by one of the least recognized and gifted directors of our time, Mira Nair.
Nair is best known for movies dealing with Indian culture like ""Mississippi Masala"" and last year's ""Monsoon Wedding,"" but here she strays from her normal interests and makes a movie about Cubans who come to the United States seeking political asylum.  Specifically, the movie centers around Dottie Perez (Tomei) and Juan Raul Perez (Molina), who are of no relation to each other except for the fact that they come to the United States with a heart full of dreams which are quickly shattered.  Dottie is smitten by John Wayne and comes with the hopes of someday sleeping with him.  Juan was incarcerated in a Cuban prison for 20 years and comes hoping to find the wife and daughter he has not seen in that time.  They both come to Miami on the same boat, and circumstances force them to act as if they were a ""family"".  This arrangement soon becomes more than just a strategic plan, as they quickly develop romantic feelings for each other.
The acting in this movie is surprisingly good.  I had gotten so used to seeing Marisa Tomei doing her New York accent in ""My Cousin Vinny"" that I didn't think she'd be able to be convincing as a Cuban refugee.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Alfred Molina was also very good, and so was Anjelica Huston who played his estranged wife.  I also thought the movie had a great musical score.
I would have given this movie five stars if it wasn't for the fact that I wasn't really satisfied with the way the movie ended.  Though I won't give away the ending, I'll say that it was entirely too simplistic.  Though, that's just a minor flaw.  This movie is definitely worth watching.",1042070400,9,1853,4.578787878787879
1078705,5,6305812322,"Thisis a wonderful funny love story about cuban refugees, however, since the players are american actors, we have to take our hats off to them. Marisa Tomei is funny, touching, and very much a ""cuban"" in this  movie, she must to really done her homework, Alfred Molina, as usual, the  greatest actor without recognition, how can this handsome man, and excelent  actor not be mentioned more and more and only do secondary roles? Anjelica  Houston shows another side of her in this funny acting also, a very  attractive Anjelica Houston and so is Chaz Molinari in this short but very  good ""hombre enamorado"" (man in love) role. The acting was very  very good of everybody involved, Marisa I repeat, magnificent, Molina his  usual same, excelent, I really recommend this movie for romantic people! I  would give 100 stars to this movie.",959472000,11,834,4.858156028368795

1078818,5,6305812322,This is a good or should I say very good movie.  It shows a husband's love for his wife.  We also to see that sometimes time does strange things to an otherwise beautiful relationship.  It also shows the yearning of mankind for freedom which we enjoy and take for granted in this God's Blessed Land we lovingly call America.  It gives you mix of smiles and tears as you see a beautiful long time relationship falling apart and a new love blossoming.  It shows the bouncing back of human spirit which becomes easier with love on its side.  I am sure you will enjoy it.,1402876800,,567,4.352380952380952
1078879,5,6305812322,"This film was of particular interest because of the acrimonious debate over immigration reform now raging in our country. The three principle cast members playing immigrants who have escaped Castro's Cuba give effective, evocatively sympathetic performances portraying the desperation of immigrants who seek residence in America. I thought a slightly zoftig Marisa Tomei gave one of the best performances of her career.",1371081600,,419,5.774193548387097
1078880,3,6305812322,"This movie didn't have much of an interesting story, but I'll have to say that Marisa Tomei stole the show for at least, being tasty eye candy on the screen.  How often do you get a chance to see a sexy girl showing armpit hair, huh? On her, it was very sexy!

As a DVD, the picture quality of this film is very good, but the story kinda dragged, about people coming to America from Cuba back in 1980.  It is no where's near the intensity of the directionless refugees that came to America as portrayed in ""Scarface"", but it did offer a more disturbing depiction of refugees coming here hope to have a better life than what they had.

Even though Mira Nair's ""Salaam Bombay"" was even more depressing, I still enjoyed that story better than this ""moving slowly, going nowhere"" Cubans coming to America, half-hearted effort kind of film.

And, as I read of other reviews on this film, I just don't see the beauty of Angelica Huston as other people do.  To me, she looks like a ""guy"" trying to be a woman.  She did nothing for me at all. I just don't see much of an appeal for her.  No offense.

At least I will say this though.  The DVD video quality is pretty decent.  I don't think that I would bother to upgrade to Blu-Ray. For the sake of the weakness of this movies story, I think this DVD is good enough.

I probably wouldn't watch this film again unless a friend or someone in my family saw it on my shelf, and asked to watch it. So, I guess I'll keep it as DVD shelf fodder. And, I'm sure we all have such a claim in all our own film libraries, right?",1339372800,,1557,4.1879194630872485
1078881,5,6305812322,"This is one of my favorite movies! I have owned & watched it on VHS over 50 times, & when it became available on DVD, I quickly snatched it up. I'm sure the movie is enjoyable to all who give it a try, however, it is much more moving to me being spanish. From my perspective I can understand some of the struggles that the characters are going through. The music, the culture, it is all done very beautifully, despite not having many spanish actors. The ending to me is very sad & tragic & that's what makes the movie so memorable. I was very moved by the role that Alfred Molina played. He was AWESOME!! His struggle to want to reunite with his wife is very moving. Equally as moving was Angelica Houston's portrayal of Carmela. Her pain was very heartfelt. This movie is a must see. It grows on you even more as time goes by.",1249689600,,827,4.2405063291139244
1078882,3,6305812322,"As a fan of director, Mira Nair, I really looked forward to seeing this movie with a unique story line.  While it was interesting, I did not feel the material met her previous high levels of expertise, and felt a little campy and overdone here and there. I thought most of the acting was well done, especially Angelica Huston, and Alfred Molina, and Chazz Palminteri. I am also a huge fan of Marissa Tomei, but was disappointed in her role her. She played her character in such an exaggerated manner that it almost felt cartoonish, although I felt she improved as the movie progressed. Her Cuban enthusiasm and zest for life felt overdone, overplayed, which detracted from the essential drama of the refugee story being told. I also felt the costuming could have been more realistic, more appropriate to the income level of the people portrayed. (MT's sugar cane costume was over the top!! a caricature!)  Lots of plusses, but a few too many minuses. It falls far short of being great.

1078883,4,6305812322,"This 1995 romantic comedy has gotten a second-life through the DVD release; it was a box-office failure for The Samuel Goldwyn Company, it made around [...] which was nowhere near covering the [...] production cost.

Based on a 1991 novel of the same name by author Christine Bell, the backdrop is the 1980 Mariel boatlift and the quest for a new life, a new beginning....but with a twist, which entails the last name, ""Perez."" Alfred Molina portrays a former Cuban aristocrat/political prisoner - Juan Raul Perez - who has just been freed from jail. He has one goal; making it to America to find his wife (portrayed by Anjelica Huston) and daughter. But on the same boat is Dottie Perez - played by Marisa Tomei - who is trying to make it back from the wrong side of the tracks.

And the hijinks kicks into gear when an official for U.S. Immigration believes they- Juan and Dottie - are married, which sets in motion a number of events where the ""Perez Family"" takes on a whole new meaning. With wit and a play on the politics of the time, director Mira Nair delivers a well-paced movie where romance takes a unique twist for those who truly value living life (with personal freedom) to the fullest each day.",1236124800,,1209,4.566820276497696
1078884,3,6305812322,"Very entertaining story about a Hispanic family and what happens to them when they come from Cuba to Florida. A little gooey but good performances.

1078886,2,6305812322,"Mira Nair is, without a doubt (in my opinion), one of the finest contemporary filmmakers today.  I am not just talking finest Indian filmmakers--I mean filmmaker in any language, context, culture or genre.  Nair has a real knack for storytelling, through a glowing combination of luscious cinematography, compelling and believeable direction and great pacing.  Unfortunately, if you see THE PEREZ FAMILY, this wonderful gift she has is not front and center.  In fact, it's not even off to the side in the background.  This might be (partly) due to the fact that Nair's attempt in telling the story of the Marielitos of the 1980s (boat people who crossed the waters from Cuba to the United States, in lieu of Castro's dictatorship) deals much with a culture with which she is unfamiliar.  For me, this film and story seemed cartoonish (at best) and very unappealing.

Juan Perez (Alfred Molina) has just been released from prison and is arriving in Florida, after being locked up for twenty years, away from his beautiful wife, Carmela (Angelica Houston) and daughter, Teresa (Trini Alvarado).  He is hoping that time hasn't dulled his wife's vigilance, as she awaits his return.  On his journey to the United States, he encounters Dottie Perez (Marisa Tomei), who is filled with stars in her eyes and rumba in her hips.  Together, they form a ""family"" of sorts, along with a little vagabond they encounter and a mute old man, who is very prone to climbing trees and (in the words of Juan) ""looking for Cuba.""  My reaction to all this:  ""QUE?!!!""  (translation:  ""What???!!"")  Okay, for starters, the main problem I had was with Marisa Tomei.  I know they call what she does ""acting"" for a reason.  Granted,  British actor Sir Anthony Hopkins played Pablo Picasso (Spaniard), Peter Sellers played Inspector Clouseu (French), but Marisa Tomei (a beautiful actress of Italian descent) playing sultry Cubana, Dotty, was too much of a stretch for me.  For starters, the accents were so fake!  I have a Cuban aunt, in Florida, and believe you and me, they were overdoing it in this film.  They sounded like they had had some bad novacaine shots at times, and it wasn't good.  Also, the stereotypical depiction of Cubans was on the insulting side.

Skip this film and see the films that really put Mira Nair on the map, as a filmmaker.  My picks for you are SALAAM BOMBAY!, MISSISSIPPI MASALA, MONSOON WEDDING and her latest, THE NAMESAKE.",1175472000,3,2432,4.875609756097561
1078887,5,6305812322,"This is my second all time Marisa Tomei movie. Angelica Huston delivered a spectacular performance. Chazz Palmintien performance as a cop was superb. You could learn how to seduce a woman from him, the way he seduced Ms. Huston. Alfred Molina shined as a Cuban fleeing from Castro to start a new life in America. Marisa was sexy, alluring, seductive, attractive and very friendly like the goddess of love. You'll find it hard not to fall instantly in love with her. This movie will keep you at the edge of your seat and make you laugh and eat many bags of popcorn. I highly recommend it to all readers and shoppers.

1078888,5,6305812322,"Fighting against all the odds, a group of Cuban refuges arrive to the promised land and their dreams will take through unexpected routes. We have a peculiar dramatic triangle: a man who could escape , his wife and daughter wait for him in Florida but a terrible new comes for her and she thinks her husband failed and died. At the meantime we watch all the unimaginable efforts of beautiful young woman who reminds me in certain aspects to Amelie, who loves the life and brings in her soul a lot of illusions, such as to meet John Wayne and enjoy Elvis Presley's art.

Mira Nair emphasizes the human charm and the best of the human people can give, without forgetting the childhood aspect, reflected in a smart boy who is chased for a miserable mercenary who simply tries to avail the best he can of the circumstances.

A song for the liberty and the hopeful dreams.",1118880000,,866,4.509554140127388
