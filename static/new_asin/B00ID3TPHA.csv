6258567,2,B00ID3TPHA,"I ordered Season 3 to view season 3.5, but I could only view two of the videos on the fourth disc on my  almost new Sony Blu Ray player.
I finally obtained a special HDMI converter plug for my computer, connected the TV to the computer, and was able to play the disc on my computer and view it on my TV",1431993600,,302,3.870967741935484

6258574,4,B00ID3TPHA,"Eureka grabbed me right away with the fun, quirky music by Mutato Muzika, and then Bear Mcreary, the same guy whos done the music on Battlestar Galactica, Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, Black Sails, Outlander, Black Mirror, and the list goes on.

Season one of Eureka was great. If it had lasted just one season it would be on my list of one season wonder sci-fi shows like Firefly, The Prisoner, UFO, Brisco County, Jr., Eerie, Indiana, Jericho, etc. But it went on, dropping some of the funniest characters, and turned into the Allison Blake show. Nathan Stark, out of there. Beverly Barlowe, out of there. Spencer Martin, out of there. Jim Taggart, out of there.

And then they got rid of Zoe Carter! But they had to bring her back for the last season, season five, so they could end the series with a bookend, a mirror image of Zoe and her father driving out of town, passing themselves driving into town, which is how the series began.

Even the addition of the Wil Wheaton and Felicia Day characters couldn't rescue this series after they turned it into the Allison Blake show.

When Im not watching sci-fi and fantasy shows Im reading sci-fi and fantasy. Authors I like include Douglas Adams, Taylor Anderson, Isaac Asimov, Paolo Bacigalupi, Jack Campbell, Orson Scott Card, Arthur C. Clarke, Earnest Cline, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Terry Goodkind, Joe Haldeman, Robert A. Heinlein, Frank Herbert, Hugh Howey, Robert Jordan, George Martin, Larry Niven, Andre Norton, Patrick Rothfuss, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, John Steakley, J.R.R. Tolkien, and Andy Weir.",1491091200,,1586,4.996212121212121
6258575,4,B00ID3TPHA,"This also contains season 3.5!! I did not know that, so I also bought 3.5 separately. Why is it not mentioned anywhere in the description??",1489276800,8,139,4.6

6258578,5,B00ID3TPHA,"I bought the entire DVD series, one full season at a time, as that's what most current.  I had problems with 2 Seasons, one arrived damaged due to packaging; and the other had actual disk problems (freezing/locking up).  Both were quickly replaced, and work as well as the other seasons do.  They're all very good, and it's great to have ALL the episodes.  The picture quality is acceptable, though I expected better.  Still, buying them before Christmas, during the sale, made this a good investment.  Keep in mind that sometimes it's less expensive buying the individual Seasons, than buying a ""Complete Series"".  This was a tough one to figure out though, because some years it was offered as two parts/disk pkgs per season; some years the Seasons were titled, ""1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, etc."".  Then some were offered as, ""1, 2, etc.""  I bought the Series Version, ""Season One, Season Two, etc.""  It's very difficult to explain, but that's the latest release, and least expensive.  This is a rare arrangement, but have encountered it on other Syfy type series' too. It was very worthwhile, buying this release, and I'd recommend it to you/others.",1486166400,3,1140,4.8549222797927465
6258579,3,B00ID3TPHA,"3 stars for Season 3. Too much soap opera drama with the various romances. And I guess the writers think that adding even more females to the show will help ratings (examples: Tess, Eva, Lexi). Seasons 1 and 2 were fun, but now it's too much of a soap opera.

This DVD set includes both the first half (3.0) and second half (3.5) of Season 3.",1484265600,2,342,4.181818181818182
