3167667,1,B00177Y9ZC,"Thank God this was a short movie - what a waste of money. The story's ridiculous and largely untold - there are gaping holes in the plot, the backstory is nonexistant apart from a throwaway line (""this dates back to the Inquisition"" ... eh???) You get the feeling sometimes when novels are made into films that you're getting the story through a filter, getting it all 2nd or 3rd hand. This is a prime example, but its problems didn't stop there. The acting was just abysmal - Sammuel Jackson was completely unsuited to this role in the first place, and sure enough he made a mess of it. Rachel Billison was just shrill and annoying, constantly (CONSTANTLY) demanding to know what was going on - seriously, that was the extent of her dialogue: ""What's going on? What aren't you telling me? Blah blah, wah wah!"" Some character. There is no character development at all, least of all Jamie Bell's, who is similarly annoying and unlikeable.

Terrible script, terrible plot (what plot?) A real bottom of the barrel stinker. I walked out of the cinema baffled at what I'd just witnessed ... someone actually forked out millions to make this film. It defies belief.",1203292800,7,1159,4.70935960591133
3167668,1,B00177Y9ZC,"It's too bad that a law is not passed in the United States allowing you to get a full ticket refund if you walk out of the theater after watching 50% or less of a movie. A bell could ring or light could flash for a second to remind the patrons of a last call for a refund! If a system like this was in place in the United States, I guarantee you - rotten, boring trash like Jumper would never, ever be made! Half the theater would have emptied out in a heartbeat! This film is so incredibly vapid and mind-numbingly dull it genuinely insults the intelligence of  the movie going audience!!

I realize movies actors need to make a living! But big stars like Hayden Christensen and Samuel L. Jackson should be ashamed of themselves - they can pick and choose their projects. Memo to Their Hollywood Agents: You are ruining their careers! If dreary, campy films are all you can find for them to work on then maybe you shouldn't be in the movie star agent business!

There is absolutely nothing redeeming about this godforsaken, awful story! The good guys teleport (A mutant power rip-off from the X-men). The bad guys are religious nuts that kill the teleporters in cold blood because ""only God should have this power."" Simple as that! Each group tries to kill the other. The good guys are all really sexy looking guys and gals in there 20's! All the bad guys are about 20 years older and could be the good guys parents! And in one case, the bad guy is a parent! One of the most memorable lines: ""When you were five years old I had to either kill you or leave you. You shouldn't have come here (parent's home), but I will give you a head start."" What a pal!

When I heard this line I thought to myself, ""how inspiring!"" Parents are all defective or crazy  religious zealots or non-existent.  Religious people are all fanatical killers going back to the ""Inquisition."" Only narcissistic 20-Somethings are the heroes in the world of Jumper. But even they are so narcissistic, that when the Christmas Eve Tsunami hits the Indian Ocean nations of the world, does our hero, Hayden Christensen, go and use his incredible teleporting powers to save those drowning before his eyes on the T.V. news? Nope! He grabs a surf board and teleports to some Pacific Island country to surf those extra powerful waves! How disgusting and shocking! What are the writers of this story trying to tell us? That 20-30 year olds are so gross they only care about themselves? So, in a real sense, there are absolutely no good guys in this pathetic film!

Now that the writer's strike is over I hope those responsible for crafting this depressing trash get kicked out of the Writers Union! I'm sure there are plenty of talented writers in the world who can churn out a decent story, and would give their eye-teeth to break into show business! One can only hope!

3167669,1,B00177Y9ZC,"I'm a movie buff -- I love seeing films, both at home and on DVD.  I'm also very tolerant and forgiving as a movie fan -- invariably, I find something at least resonably worthwhile, or at least entertaining, about a movie.  Not so ""Jumpers"".  It really takes quite an awful movie to actually make me regret the ticket expense -- what's a few dollars for 90 minutes of big-screen entertainment, right?  Wrong.  As other reviewers have alluded to, ""Jumpers"" is simply a title (and some none-too-special special effects) in search of a plot, even the vestiges of continuity and logic, and any engagement with the audience at all.  It fails - miserably - on all three counts.  The acting is amateurish at best, the plot holes are large enough to navigate an oil tanker through, and the saddest loss of all is Samuel L. Jackson's ridiculous character and performance -- other than his paycheck, which I'm sure he happily deposited as he laughed all the way to the bank, it was a waste of a competent actor's talents.  As for the rest of the cast, the less said, the better.

But this isn't even my main gripe with this film -- there are certainly many ""action flicks"" that have disastrously bad acting and even a plot hole or three, yet they still can entertain.  Not ""Jumpers"".  Even if one forgives the utter lack of explanation and background story behind the origins of the ""Jumpers"" and the ""Paladins"", there could still have been a cohesive plot that actually progressed toward some logical conclusion.  Instead, what we have here is a non-stop chase sequence and travelogue of places throughout the world (including, ludicrously, the top of the Egyptian Sphinx's head, apparently a frequent lunch spot for our hero), a ridiculous ""plot"" about an age-old conflict between two groups that the world at large doesn't know exist, and...let's see, and...  I guess that's it.  Really,  There's NOTHING else to this movie.  And, irony of ironies, the most ridiculous moment comes near the end (I won't give anything away here, in case you still insist on wasting your time and money on this) -- the story gets left wide-open for a SEQUEL!!  Oh My God -- if there ever was a movie that should be left alone, dead and buried for all time, it's this one.  Please -- trust me on this.",1203206400,7,2275,4.673366834170854

3167671,2,B00177Y9ZC,"All the actors here just go through the motions, especially the no talent hack by the name of Hayden Christensen. Rachel Bilson is oh so cute, but her acting could use some work as well. We all know Sam Jackson doesn't turn down a paycheck and he just cashed in here. The special effects were neat and the story did have potential, but it really was just a complete mess. I don't know if I could have taken more than 85 minutes of Jumper. The tagline ""anywhere is possible"" is fitting for a movie that I wish applied to me while watching it. Maybe anywhere else is possible would make more sense than sitting through this film again.",1203120000,3,633,4.372881355932203
3167672,3,B00177Y9ZC,"David is a normal enough high school boy, trying to impress his girl despite the usual kinds of bullies. Then, after a teenish bit of bad judgement, he falls through the surface of a frozen river. Once under the ice, the river's current drags him away from the opening, and from light and air. When his lungs are about to burst ... he and a fair bit of river water suddenly materialize in a familiar library.

David is a ""Jumper,"" with an incredible ability to teleport himself anywhere, a knack that he soon brings under voluntary control. In teen-off-the-leash style, he makes free with bank vaults and any other interior that holds something he wants, which is pretty much everything. I said that he's ""a"" jumper - not the only one. There are others, and there is a secretive cabal dedicated to ridding the world of jumpers.

It turns pretty predictable after that. The effects make this flick, especially the fights and chases between two Jumpers. There are worse ways you could kill a few hours on a boring weekend - it really is fair entertainment, with some (but not much) less-than-graphic violence and people who keep their clothes on. I just hope that Samuel L. Jackson isn't betting his career on woofers like this.

3167673,2,B00177Y9ZC,"At first, I honestly couldn't tell if ""Jumper"" was a milestone of science fiction camp or just a really bad movie. Moments of this film are so obviously ridiculous that it's difficult to imagine their inclusions as unintentional. Consider the fact that Hayden Christensen's character--who has the ability to teleport himself to wherever he wants--literally ends up atop famous landmarks, such as the face of Big Ben, or the head of the Sphinx; honestly, doesn't this seem like an inside joke on the filmmaker's part? But after a while, I had to admit to myself that it wasn't supposed to be campy and that I wasn't having fun. This movie is just plain frustrating, not only because it fails to tell a coherent story, but also because it assumes we'll understand it even though it doesn't explain itself. Watching ""Jumper"" is like playing a video game without knowing the rules, what the goal is, or even how to use the controller.

The science fiction element is probably the most frustrating thing of all, simply because it's an intriguing concept that has nothing to fall back on. It can't even rely on the plot, which can't be described without falling through one of its numerous holes. Example: the prologue establishes that small-town Detroit boy David Rice discovered the power to transport himself at age fifteen (Max Thieriot), when he ended up in a library after walking on a frozen lake and falling through some thin ice. But wait a minute--as an adult (Christensen) in the story proper, he's informed that he first transported at age five. If that's true, then I have a hard time believing he'd forget something like that for ten straight years.

Never mind; what is clear is that David's power--called Jumping--can take him across any distance, from a few feet to a few thousand miles. And indeed, he Jumps all over the world on any given day, using only a postcard or a mental image to get him to his destination (and that makes we wonder about the moment he saved himself from drowning at age fifteen, since I can't imagine him visualizing a library). Oh, and in case you're wonder how David supports himself, it should be noted here that he's a very rich young man, living in one of New York City's most expensive areas. He's never been a hard worker, but he can steal money by jumping to and from sealed bank vaults. He eventually uses that money to take his high school sweetheart--Millie (Rachel Bilson)--on a trip to Rome. He, of course, doesn't Jump there, since that would be telling her too much too soon. But considering how annoying and unbelievable she is, I don't think it would have mattered a great deal.

We're soon introduced to a man named Roland (Samuel L. Jackson), and that's when the story really gets confusing. Roland, you see, is the leader of the Paladins, a group dedicated to hunting down and destroying every last Jumper on earth. As for why Roland does this, all he ever says is, ""Only God should have the power to be in all places at once."" He also says that, sooner or later, all Jumpers turn bad. What he doesn't say is why or how, nor does he even hint at a Paladin back-story, such as how long they've been chasing Jumpers and why they feel so threatened by them. That would have been helpful, don't you think? Roland shows his angry side by shocking Jumpers with metal rods that shoot out electrified wires; this wouldn't have been a problem had the film actually attempted to explain what these weapons were.

David soon learns that he's not the only Jumper. Here enters Griffin (Jamie Bell), an antisocial hothead who hunts Paladins from his shack in the middle of one of the world's deserts. He says that he's been tracking David for the past ten years, which is difficult to understand since he looks about as old as David does, maybe even younger. He also says that he lost his parents when he was only five, and this was because the Paladins discovered his ability to Jump. Again, I ask why. And again, I say never mind, because I haven't even gotten to the final major sequence, which sees Millie trapped in Roland's clutches, awaiting David to return from a showdown with Griffin.

Have I made it clear just how infuriating this movie is? Probably not--this review is just as rambling and confused as the film itself. ""Jumper"" is all action but no setup, a cool-looking science fiction thriller that tells us nothing but expects us to be entertained nonetheless. My biggest beef related to David's back story, a classic case of feeling unloved and unwanted; when he was only five, his mother (Diane Lane) left him and his abusive, alcoholic father (Michael Rooker), so by the time he turned fifteen, he had had enough rejection in his life. I won't reveal why his mother left, although I will say that her reasons only added more questions to an ever-growing list. This movie can do nothing more than raise questions, which makes me wonder if director Doug Liman intentionally left the explanations out of the final cut. Here's hoping that fixing this film is as simple as releasing an exhaustively re-cut extended version; it might be something I can watch without feeling so damn lost.",1203033600,10,5145,4.693244739756367
3167674,3,B00177Y9ZC,"It is finally here--the first mega-budget, CGI-laden, ""blockbuster"" of the year, but its' jump falls short of great, and lands on moderate instead.

David Rice (played Hayden Christensen) learns at age fifteen he as the ability to teleport anywhere, through anything, at anytime. He quickly learns how to harness his power and control it, and then before long he as robbed a bank and is on his way to the ""good life"". Fast-forward  till he is older, he now has a dream apartment in New York and spends his days trotting the globe--breakfast in Paris, surfing in Fiji, lunch on top of the Sphinx, one night stand in London, etc.--you get the picture.

He returns home wanting to find his high school crush, Millie (played by Rachel Bilson). He finds her working at the local bar and obviously wants to share his dream-existence with her. There lies a big problem as she quickly suspects something, and before he has time to explain everything to her his ""perfect"" existence is suddenly threatened.
It is threatened by a detective Roland (played by Samuel L. Jackson) who is investing the first bank robbery, and slowly starts tracking David. Roland knows about these ""jumpers"", and tracks them down to kill them reminding each one repeatedly ""Only God should have the power...."" As he gets closer to David and his loved ones, the film accelerates into a blinding pace of ""jumping"" action until the end which neatly setup a new franchise.

Because of its' poor script, direction, and editing, the special effects and settings are what make this film good. Yes we have seen other superheroes teleport, but I do not remember ever seeing Night-crawler lounging in a beach chair on top of the Sphinx's head or riding thirty-foot waves in Fiji. Watching him do everything you could ever want with this new power is what makes it entertaining, as you anticipate the next destination you will be whisked off to.

Hayden Christensen proves he really can act after, and he gives a solid performance, although Jamie Bell (playing another jumper) steals any and all scenes he appears in with his intense, energetic, comic-relief presence. Diane Lane's cameo is a pleasant surprise, and Rachel Bilson's performance as the girlfriend is sincere.

My main complaint was the ending, which is so happily clique and a blatant setup for a sequel it leaves you with the feeling ""that's it?"" I still liked it. Overall this is a pure popcorn, eye-candy thriller that is entertaining enough if you do not try to think about it to hard, and can hold you over till this Summer's ""real"" blockbusters!",1203033600,3,2573,4.849658314350798
3167675,2,B00177Y9ZC,"With all the phenomenal superpowers and grandiose action potential, Jumper ultimately falls short in execution. Creative ideas are at work, yet so little is done to properly expand upon their possibilities. What is essentially marketed as a sci-fi action film displays only a few scenes of solid mayhem (the majority of which is revealed in the trailers) and any sci-fi elements are left almost entirely unexplained. Jumper does manage to entertain with the anticipation of something grand, and rooting for an antihero who possesses almost no likeable traits poses an interestingly twisted charm, but the frustration with similarities between what could have been and what ended up threatens to negate any positives.

After falling into a frozen lake and magically teleporting to safety, David Rice (Hayden Christensen) realizes the potential of his mysterious gift. Running away from home, he begins to live life to the fullest - at the expense of others. Robbing banks and teleporting to exotic locales around the world, David amasses a small fortune and a glamorous lifestyle that he uses to woo his childhood sweetheart, Millie (Rachel Bilson). Traveling to Rome to seduce her, David encounters Griffin (Jamie Bell), another ""jumper,"" and learns of a secret organization whose mission is to hunt down and destroy those possessing such teleportation abilities. Desperate to avoid capture and protect Millie, David must join forces with Griffin to stop the murderous organization leader, Roland (Samuel L. Jackson).

Chances are many a critic will have ill to say about the acting, and while much of the negativity may take aim at Hayden Christensen, it has less to do with his acting abilities and more to do with the scope of the character he was given to portray. With all of his teleporting superpowers, David feels too normal; his traits steer towards the selfish reality of having such gifts. He uses his power to chase girls, rob banks, and picnic atop famous structural wonders. Few redeeming qualities or admirable motives surface in this antihero-of-sorts and renders the warning ""there are always consequences"" somewhat of a joke. The consequences of such materialistic wrongdoing is that an angry, white-haired black man will hunt you down - but you'll still save the day and get the girl without anyone really having to pay. For some unknown reason we're supposed to root for this character (perhaps a lesser of two evils?) and even more inexplicably we do. So is Christensen to blame? Yes, but that's not a bad thing. Rachel Bilson's Millie offers a pretty face and ugly dialogue, and Griffin exhibits even fewer likeable qualities than David, but is much less interesting. Sam Jackson plays himself again, complete with requisite scars and terrible costume.

Teleporting has always been a fascinating creation of science fiction, and Jumper's premise requires no reason and only a destination. Choosing to explain nothing isn't nearly as unsatisfying as choosing not to jump outside the box and realize truly creative possibilities. David only uses his powers to travel to exotic locations, woo girls, and unburden banks of their money - not that there's anything wrong with that, but I had hoped for some slightly more jaw-dropping uses of such a limitless ability.

Doug Liman's latest actioner steadies itself upon a promising premise and then never decides to jump off. Predictable characters, an overused (albeit cool) special effect, and countless unresolved conflicts keep Jumper from achieving greatness. The film ironically parallels David's early proposition to Millie to ""skip the boring parts"" of their journey - but apparently it also skipped over anything that would have given the film enough substance to stay afloat.

3167779,3,B00177Y9ZC,"This movie, made in 2007, has been on DirecTV's movie channels for years. HBO, STARZ, SHOWTIME, ENCORE, etc.
Prime's Free video (movies & TV) is slowly shrinking down to mostly junk.  Annoying!
It is nice to be able to purchase a missed TV episode.

However,  I think Amazon is getting way too greedy.  There were a lot of newer movies, available for free, when they started this service.  I put a few in my Watch List . . . and a month or so later I went to watch one particular movie and it was no longer free. In fact all the previously saved 'FREE' movies on my list were no longer free.  Annoying!

I have no complaints about recent movies costing to rent but when they want you to pay $2.99-$3.99 to rent a 20 year old movie that did fair at the box office . . . . . not anywhere near a classic or box office . . . . . . it makes their Free Prime Movie ads a joke.

3167785,4,B00177Y9ZC,"I was thinking about giving Jumper a 3-star rating based on some really mediocre downtime in the middle when the storyline lacks direction for a while (strange for an action movie but then again maybe I just lost interest) but I suppose the many special effects and the fairly original concept of a young man being able to jump around from one location to another in the blink of an eye is enticing enough to give the film a slightly higher rating.  This is definitely for fans of science fiction mixed with action, but don't be surprised if you find yourself disliking this movie.

Just to give everyone a heads up, my review contains a bunch of spoilers, so SPOILER ALERT from here on out!

It stars Hayden Christensen who possesses such magical jumping abilities when he falls through the ice and nearly drowns, but a moment later wakes up soaking wet on the floor of the local library, haha.  How did THAT happen!  More storytelling could have explained the whys and hows in greater detail, but sadly the film is short at only 90 minutes.  All this sudden location jumping reminds me of dreaming!  At least that's how I dream.

It turns out Hayden's isn't the only one with such an amazing ability.  There's a few more jumpers out there too.  Hayden meets one of them (Jamie Bell's character) while in Rome.  At first the two don't get along particularly well because Jamie's pretty much convinced that hiding and toying with the bad guys when confronted is the only way to live his life.  The bad man- Samuel L. Jackson- is aware of such an unexplainably insane jumping ability and considers it immoral, so he desires to kill all these jumpers by stabbing them in the chest.  Hayden and Jamie find themselves eventually working together to take out the bad men who are persistently following their every move but it takes a while for the two to finally get on the same page.

For the most part the film takes place in Rome Italy, where Hayden and his girlfriend (the adorable Rachel Bilson) go on a vacation because 8 years prior in high school Rachel wanted to go to Rome.  Meanwhile before this, Hayden spent eight years hiding and everyone in town assumed he either died or disappeared.  The movie gets a little strange near the end when these dimensions form that Hayden, Rachel and Jamie go through as a way to try and avoid evil.  The evil being Samuel L. Jackson's character.  It's amazing how Samuel L. Jackson is able to track their moves so well.  Hayden also has issues with his father (Michael Rooker) and the two never get along, which leads to a couple funny moments such as when his father is about to break into Hayden's bedroom to confront his behavior only for Hayden to quickly jump to another location leaving nothing but dust and papers blowing around by the time the father breaks the lock and walks into his room, lol.

Overall, well to be honest the action is really lousy because it's just a bunch of quick camera jerks as a way to explain Hayden's jump from one location to another, but otherwise Jumper is decent enough to satisfy me.  The acting from all the characters is passable but nothing great, the storyline could've been bigger and better for sure with an extra 30 minutes to explain certain events in greater detail without the story feeling like it was sloppily thrown together (much like my review because I'm in a hurry tonight, hehe) and the constant jumping around can be almost comical at times (jumping inside a bank safe to steal money?  And returning with a bigger bag that can hold more money?  Haha, that's just silly!)  I think Hayden should have told Rachel about his amazing abilities sooner too.  She wouldn't have understood necessarily but well, at least he would've been honest and upfront right away saving hassle in the future!",1454025600,2,3789,4.62780269058296

3167831,3,B00177Y9ZC,"The basic story line of a human being (David) who discovers he has the power to teleport himself anywhere in the world is pretty good, and had a lot of promise. The movie did not make as much of that promise as it could have though. The movie turned David into your basic unrepentant bank robber as he jumped into bank vaults, stole pillow cases full of cash and jumped out. That aspect of his character made me find him an unattractive character.

Soon he runs across an ancient group of religious nuts called the Paladins that hunt jumpers down. No real reason, they just seem to think it is a good idea. The chief religious nut is played by Samuel L. Jackson, who does a fair job of playing a psychopath with a religious bent.

David eventually goes back home after a number of years of absence to visit with his old girlfriend Millie. This character had no appeal to me at all, and other then being attractive, I never really got what he saw in her. He takes her to Italy to see the Colosseum and runs into another jumper, and then the Paladins attack. The other jumper is well portrayed as paranoid and amoral. I guess when you have that kind of power, there is a temptation to use it, and not in a good way. Maybe the Paladins have the right idea after all.

There is a lot of havoc raised through the movie that is not bad. Kind of noisy in spots, but pretty good.

Somewhere along the way he runs into his mother who turns out to be a Paladin.

Overall, as such movies go, it is OK. Not especially good, but as a way to kill a few hours, there are worse ways.",1436400000,2,1567,4.21

But after watching the film I was surprised to end up liking it and found it pretty interesting. Those who panned the movie with low reviews I wondered if they gave this movie a fair watch before judging it.  The acting was decent and plot made pretty good sense to me.  The ability to teleport anywhere you wanted in the world and never have to worry about finances or money seemed pretty cool.  The bank vault scenes seemed very realistic to someone with that kind of power.  The character seems to want to explore and have fun go surfing enjoy life etc etc.  You don't see him living in a palace or mansion being greedy like Monty Burns.

I thought Samuel L Jackson did another excellent job as a tracker to stop the Jumpers.  I have never read the book so I cannot reference it compared to the movie. But from just watching the film alone I thought it was interesting and different than your average SCI FI film.  I absolutely loathed all three Star Wars prequel films that Hayden was in, but did not think this movie was too bad.

3167852,3,B00177Y9ZC,"I read the book first and yes, this movie has little overlap as others have complained. Still a nice effort worth seeing.

However one thing that spoilt the film for me was the scene where the 2 male stars drive through a Japanese city (Tokyo?) in a European car. The car is meant for driving on the right side of the road. But in Japan they like UK drive on the left! If you look at the background, you can see the traffic is moving on the left.

Now you might say it's a European car so it should be as shown in the film. But no. Japan like UK requires imports to be adapted for left side driving. The scenes of closeup of the driver and passenger talking to each other have the background traffic dubbed in. I am guessing that to US watchers, this could completely pass them by. Everything seems as it should for the closeups. Better would have been the use of a left sided car. If nothing else, it subtly emphasises that they are indeed in a different country. It is obvious with the Asian backdrop; but tweaking it via a correct car gives an authentic nuance. Especially because the driver is British, so he indeed is used to that driving.",1431820800,,1144,4.291666666666667

I have over 100 3D movies, so that means I have a lot of movies that have not been nominated for an Academy award, but we usually find something we like about the movie, for instance, great 3D effects.  This movie had NOTHING!  No discernible 3D effects, no plot, no point, no character development, and the ""hero"" of our ""story"" was basically a narcissistic criminal.

The story could have actually been interesting with some development, or absent that, throw some awesome 3D effects at us.  We all agreed that it was the worst movie we ever wasted Friday night 3D movie night on.",1426896000,5,705,4.555555555555555

With the basic premise (as told in the Amazon blurb) I wanted to like it.  But we get into the movie and bam, violence everywhere, which I wasn't expecting.  So, you know, take that or leave it, that wasn't why it was terrible.  The reason it was terrible:  there was a single unexplained idea that was hammered absolutely to death.  Here's what the movie's about: there are two kinds of people (outside of normal people, evidently): people who can jump, and people who are against their jumping on some unclear biblical basis.  The entire movie is the main guy figuring out he can jump, and then running from people who think he has no right to. The story is utterly lacking in depth or detail (I'm talking about the movie - I haven't read the book, and perhaps things are better there).  It's really a sad shame that this wasn't better, because it really could have been good.

3167930,4,B00177Y9ZC,"I just got this DVD the other day and unfortunately, it took me 6 years to finally give this a chance. Fast-forward to today and I actually like this movie. The acting was smooth and on key. No complaints there. I give that an A. The storyline is good but I'm going to have to give that a B. There are some things that just weren't explained. Yeah, I know they were trying to explain as much as they could in a limited amount of time but I mean, ok, the dude was born with the ability to teleport from point A to point B but how about a little background story with how the jumper powers came to exist. There has to be more to it than just being born with the powers right?!! And I know David's mom left when he was a little boy but how about explaining more about his mother's other new life that she started for herself after leaving David and his father??? There are some unanswered questions to this movie that just leaves me wondering if all of those things were answered in the movie. Anyway, pretty good.

Samuel Jackson plays a better bad guy than a good guy in my opinion and he just makes this movie shine. Personally, he was the only guy in the movie keeping my attention. All of the actors are good but Sam just takes it like always.

Special Effects: A
Language: Some expletives, but light, not too heavy.
Violence: Moderate
Action: A

Overall Rating. I give it B+.

I thought the movie was slick and there was some thought put into it and it keeps the audience guessing.

I was apprehensive about watching it before finishing the book, but I need not have worried. The lead character and his love interest's names are the same, and he can teleport, but that's the only similarity to the book. I gave my review 2 stars because Christensen and Jackson are nice to look at, but the movie kept me wondering when it was going to start... for 90 minutes. The lead has no likable qualities, and doesn't use his abilities for good, as he does in the book. The characters are not ""Fleshed out"" and you have no idea why they are the way they are. Then they left it open at the end for a sequel. GGGRRR! After the movie, I watched the special features where the director stated he wanted to take the idea and go completely away from the story and do his own thing. Big mistake. What he did was create a movie where  there is no story line, no plot and no likeable characters. What's the point of making a movie out of a book if your not going to follow the original story even a little bit?!? Isn't that the whole reason to begin with, to make a movie out of a story that has a big fan base?

The analogy to other highly evolved beings being sought out by a kind of Inquisition bent on murdering them is lost on many. Saints, sages, yogis, lamas, prophets and messiahs have been said to be able to physically appear and disappear (see Yogananda's Autobiography of a Yogi). This story seems more plausible than the freakish X-men and their comic superpowers. The film has its weaknesses, but if you have eyes and ear to see beyond these, it's quite an inspiring film.

3167994,3,B00177Y9ZC,"When I first heard that a movie was being made from the book 'Jumper' by S. Gould, I was very excited to see it.

The movie is like the book in the same way that a Cessna 150 is like the space shuttle. The movie is only loosely based upon the book.

The book has no 'Palladins', David Rice does not meet up with another 'jumper', his mother is not the head of the group trying to kill him. To say that I was disappointed in the movie is an understatement.

The book describes David Rice as an abused high school student. His father is whipping him with a belt when he discovers his ability. Later, he is shown running from US Government agents who discover his powers while he is trying to capture and kill the terrorists who killed his mother during an airplane hijacking in Cypress where she was travelling as a travel agent. The original story has enough action, character development, humor and a very topical plot for today's headlines to have made a great film. Why the screenwriters deviated from the original is beyond me. They must not have a tight grip on reality or are really thick.

Take a hint. Read the book after you watch the film, otherwise you will be as disappointed as I am.",1395792000,,1195,4.36936936936937

3168116,2,B00177Y9ZC,"The premise of ""Jumper"" is an interesting one.  It deals with a young boy, who is living with his father (both were abandoned by his mother), and discovers that he has an amazing superpower that allows him to teleport from one place to another anywhere in the world, in an instant.  He inadvertently discovers this while trying to escape drowning in an ice-covered lake.

  Flash forward several years, and this boy, named David Rice (Hayden Christensen), is now in his 20's and is living a hedonistic, but low-key, lifestyle based on his ability to teleport in and out of banks without notice and make off with a fortune.  While most of the populace have no clue that this is happening, Roland Cox (Samuel L. Jackson), of a collective called the Paladins, has tracked David down.  It seems the Paladins goal to strike back against and exterminate all of these 'Jumpers'.

  On the surface, this seems like there could be a very impressive contest of wills and skills between David and Roland.  Unfortunately, the promise is wasted on a relatively pedestrian plot.  Yes, there are battles between the two sides and travels exotic locales.  However, the intensity never rises above a low-grade fever.  Normally, cinematic whipping boy, Hayden Christensen, would take the fall for something like this.  However, he holds up his end just fine.  The fault lies with the uninspired direction of Doug Liman.  This is particularly disappointing since he was responsible for films like ""Swingers"", ""Go"", ""Bourne Identity"" and ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"".

  There is a sequel in the works.  Hopefully that films picks of the pace so that this one can just be categorized as another in a long line of underwhelming superhero 'origin' films.",1372032000,,1722,4.930313588850174

There was only 1 moment of the entire movie that made me like the main character.  The plot never sucked you in... it could have been so much more.",1371427200,,421,3.8823529411764706
3168129,3,B00177Y9ZC,"I found the idea of someone being able to jump from place to place just by picturing it in their mind fascinating. I admit I'm not a fan of Hayden Christensen after the job he did in the Star Wars movies, but I felt he was pretty good in the film Shattered Glass so I gave this film a try. I looked at the cast they put around him and I felt that this really could have worked, but it felt a little flat.

Samuel L. Jackson is is great as he always is. I liked him as the pseudo bad guy who hunts down the ""Jumpers."" Rachel Bilson was cute and likeable, but there were a couple of scenes where she looked like a deer in headlights. Hayden gave an alright performance, but nowhere near as good as in Shattered Glass. I know his character is supposed to be a little pompous, but it came across badly on screen. Diane Lane...oh, boy. This film could have definitely benefitted from more of her. It felt like there was probably more material with her in it, but for some reason it was cut from the finish product. If I remember correctly, the movie clocked in at under 90 minutes so I don't see why we couldn't have had a little more of Diane. In fact, when it was all said and done, it felt like the movie was shorter than it had originally intended to be which is probably why I was left unfulfilled. In the end, I felt as if I were rushed into my seat only to be told to get the heck out of the theater right as the ending came. Sorry, dear Jumper. You were kind of fun, but I never even got a chance to know you.

An alright movie with a great idea that probably should have been done a little better.

3168137,3,B00177Y9ZC,"I'll admit, going in, I was prepared to hate this film.  I figured that it would Jump the Shark completely.  Well luckily, I was able to make it through the film without being devoured along the way.

You know the synopsis, so I won't bore you with those details.  And you know that this is a high-concept thingamajig, so I won't give you that one-liner that somehow drew some producer in to greenlighting this project.  OK; so I lied.  ""Well, there's this dude who has some genetic anomaly that allows him to 'jump' from place to place!""  ""Wow, that's a really cool idea.  I like it!  Get me the script!""

I did have a problem or two with this movie, of course.  First of all, how was it that Hayden Christensen was able to ""jump"" from place to place, but never seemed to end up in, say, the middle of a wall?  He always seemed to land in the middle of the room.  If he hadn't been somewhere before, that seemed impossible to me as he wouldn't know where to ""land.""  Furthermore, this guy was supposed to have some genetic predisposition to being able to ""jump.""  Now, that's all well and good -- although they don't really explain that genetic anomaly in the film, they just wave their hands about it all -- but how did he, and other ""jumpers"" then move other objects as well?  How did they even ""jump"" their clothes?  I mean, after all, I'm assuming that clothes don't really have DNA (well, the cotton is dead if it does).  Jumpers should have arrived at their destinations, well, naked.

But I did somewhat like the love interest here; I often complain about films having a love interest strictly because Hollywood, and Americans, mistakenly believe that you always need one.  It did allow the filmmaker to use the old-and-trusted dramatic irony here and there; we knew that Mr. Christensen could ""jump"" but his gal-pal didn't.  (Potential spoiler.)  And a nice little cameo by Kristen Stewart at the end gave me a very good chuckle.  I wondered, ""Who would win in a fight between a Jumper and a Vampire?""

You won't be a complete Patsy if you watch this film, so I'll say this film is mildly groovy and give it a minor ""Eh!""",1367712000,,2130,4.472727272727273

The lead character is never likeable, and comes off as a control freak.  On top of that, I can't say I like Hayden Christensen.  I don't know, maybe it is Stars Wars fallout, but this guys just seems annoying.  Griffen was way more interesting, and likeable.  Samuel Jackson rocks as always.  Millie was cool too, but she could have been stronger character.  David treated her like crap.  Special effects were good.  Over all, Hayden, and the story, kills this movie.

I also find the acting to be well done in this sci-fi thriller, which I have watched repeated times.

3168180,5,B00177Y9ZC,"Jumper is the first film from a trilogy of books by Steven Gould, and while I loved this film, most critics panned it. The story centers around a young Davey (Hayden Christensen), who during a life-threatening event, come to realize he has the power to teleport wherever he wants. Unbeknownst to Davey, he is a member of a group of genetically superior humans known as Jumpers, who are currently at war with a religious organization, that believes their power is evil. What starts out as a simple kid having fun and trying to impress, becomes a fight for survival in this amazing action thriller. You can always tell when a story is adapted from a book, rather than an original screenplay, because the story tends to be more thought out. Not to say screenplays are bad, but when a story isn't made simply to be a movie, it tends to be much more focused on the story, where as screenplays have to worry about the story as well as the aesthetics. Nevertheless, Jumper isn't just another shoot 'em story, it's the perfect mix of action and drama with some outstanding performances. I love Hayden Christensen, who I think is made for roles like this, he has this cool demeanor to him, that's more clever than arrogant. Jamie Bell is also terrific as Griffin, a fellow jumper Davey meets along the way,  and he provides some much needed comic relief. ...and then there's Samuel L. Jackson. What is there to say about Jackson that hasn't already been said? The man is a legend. This film is interesting, unique, fast-paced, and even funny.

3168224,1,B00177Y9ZC,"I realize movies actors need to make a living! But big stars like Hayden Christensen and Samuel L. Jackson should be ashamed of themselves - they can pick and choose their projects. Memo to Their Hollywood Agents: You are ruining their careers! If dreary, campy films are all you can find for them to work on then maybe you shouldn't be in the movie star agent business!

It's too bad there's not a law in the United States allowing you to get a full ticket refund if you walk out of the theater after watching 50% or less of a movie. A bell could ring or light could flash for a second to remind the patrons of a last call for a refund! If a system like this was in place in the United States, I guarantee you - rotten, boring trash like Jumper would never, ever be made! Half the theater would have emptied out in a heartbeat! This film is so incredibly vapid and mind-numbingly dull it genuinely insults the intelligence of the movie going audience!!

There is absolutely nothing redeeming about this godforsaken, awful story! The good guys teleport (A mutant power rip-off from the X-Men). The bad guys are religious nuts that kill the teleporters in cold blood because ""only God should have this power."" Simple as that! Each group tries to kill the other. The good guys are all really sexy looking guys and gals in there 20's! All the bad guys are about 20 years older and could be the good guys parents! And in one case, the bad guy is a parent! One of the most memorable lines: ""When you were five years old I had to either kill you or leave you. You shouldn't have come here (parent's home), but I will give you a head start."" What a pal!

When I heard this line I thought to myself, ""how inspiring!"" Parents are all defective or crazy religious zealots or non-existent. Religious people are all fanatical killers going back to the ""Inquisition."" Only narcissistic 20-Somethings are the heroes in the world of Jumper. But even they are so narcissistic, that when the Christmas Eve Tsunami hits the Indian Ocean nations of the world, does our hero, Hayden Christensen, go and use his incredible teleporting powers to save those drowning before his eyes on the T.V. news? Nope! He grabs a surf board and teleports to some Pacific Island country to surf those extra powerful waves! How disgusting and shocking! What are the writers of this story trying to tell us? That young 20-something adults are so gross they only care about themselves? So in a real sense, there are absolutely no good guys in this pathetic film!

I hope those responsible for crafting this demoralizing trash get kicked out of the Writers Union! I'm sure there are plenty of talented writers in the world who can churn out a decent story, and would give their eye-teeth to break into show business! One can only hope!

3168226,3,B00177Y9ZC,"Jumpers(released Feb/08)stars Hayden Christensen (Max Thieriot) as David Rice,Rachel Bilson (AnnaSophia Robb) as Millie Harris,Samuel L. Jackson as Roland Cox,Jamie Bell as Griffin,Diane Lane as Mary Rice,and others. This Doug Liman directed film is an uneven effort,which never seems to build up any steam for any length of time,thus losing the interest of the viewer very quickly.
The film opens as a younger David Rice is in high school. A bully throws a snow globe onto some ice,which David retrieves. However the ice gives way and the current pulls him under. Just as he is about to drown he teleports himself into the local library. From here he tries to understand his new found abilities. He runs away from home and goes to live in New York where he robs banks in order to survive on his own.
years pass and it seems his jumping has not gone unnoticed,as one Roland Cox is the head of an agency that tracks and kills jumpers. On a return trip to his apartment he is confronted by Cox who tries to rope him with steel cables which are electrified,to prevent him from jumping. He barely manages to get away and flees home. He meets up with his old flame whom he escorts to Rome. While in the Coliseum he meets up with another jumper called Griffin. He explains the folks after him are Paladins(have gun will travel?),an ancient order dedicated to wiping out all jumpers. In short order the two confront two such men,but escape. They escape the Paladins,but not the local police who arrest David. While in jail his mother visits him and releases him. He takes his girlfriend to the airport and she flies home alone.
David and Griffin form a brief partnership to get Cox. Meanwhile Cox has attempted to kill David's father,who he finds and takes to a hospital. David then returns to his girlfriend and snatches her away to Griffins hideaway. But jumpers leave slight openings which Cox uses to find them with. A fight ensues resulting in Millie's capture. David returns to her but is captured. He teleports part of the building to the river in which he almost drowned in years before,then back to the library. However Cox has been pulled along with him and he teleports him to a remote cave above the Grand Canyon.
The film ends as David visits his mother and she explains she is in fact a Paladin also,and gives him a head start. David and Millie jump to a destination unknown.
The film ends abruptly and I thought there was more coming when it did. There are a ton of unanswered questions in this film,the least of which is David's mother. It appeared to me she was also a jumper,but she turns out to be a Paladin too,who normally don't have that ability. David apparently first jumped at five,but for some unknown reason doesn't remember that. What five year old wouldn't recall such a thing when he grew up? At one point the older David is looking at a TV new story about people stranded in a river atop a car,with the reporter questioning as to how they could be rescued. I thought the next scene would be David jumping there to at least do SOME good,instead of just taking(money)and living off the avails of others. But the film just breezes past it. The questions go on and on. As said previously it is a hodge podge of a film that never leaves you invested in the characters for any length of time whatsoever. Even the wonderful filming locales such as Rome or in Egypt couldn't make up for the interest loss. It's as if the filmmakers didn't have much of a vested interest in making it the film themselves,which translated into apathy on screen.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1. Extras include:commentary,an animated graphic novel of Davids story,three featurettes and some deleted scenes. This two disc set contains the film disc and extras and a digital copy.
All in all a film with lots of potential but with a lacklustre script and execution by its makers. You soon lose any interest in the characters,which inevitably will sink a film faster than a cement block in the Hudson. 2 1/2 - 3 stars.",1352678400,,4037,4.623955431754875

3168249,3,B00177Y9ZC,"Jumper is a thrilling, touching story of David and Millie in high school. However, when the film jumps eight years the romantic story falls apart.

Max Thieriot and AnnaSophia Robb as teenagers David and Millie are just right with teenage angst and chemistry.  Hayden Christensen and Rachel Bilson as the mid-twenties David and Millie just does not work.  There is no spark, no chemical reaction.  Rachel Bilson is a talented actress, but her talent was wasted in this film opposite Christensen who never showed the exuberant teenage David.

Samuel Jackson adds a nice touch as Roland, the religious zealot Paladin who hunts jumpers because they are an abomination since they possess powers which should be reserved for God only. Jamie Bell as Griffin, the seasoned jumper, carries the second half of this film.

Diana Lane and Michael Rooker as Mary and William Rice are wasted in this film.  These talented actors deserved more screen time and a better script.

The jump scenes are well done.  The fight in the coliseum and in Millie's apartment and Griffin's lair are exciting.

The Paladins have a rich history of being warriors.  It is sad this film did not give a peek into this rich history.

Overall, I give this film 3 stars for the first part with the teenagers, the concept and effects and for Jackson and Bell's characters which definitely save this film.

David is a ""Jumper,"" with an incredible ability to teleport himself anywhere, a knack that he soon brings under voluntary control. In teen-off-the-leash style, he makes free with bank vaults and any other interior that holds something he wants, which is pretty much everything. I said that he's ""a"" jumper - not the only one. There are others, and there is a secretive cabal dedicated to ridding the world of jumpers.

It turns pretty predictable after that. The effects make this flick, especially the fights and chases between two Jumpers. There are worse ways you could kill a few hours on a boring weekend - it really is fair entertainment, with some (but not much) less-than-graphic violence and people who keep their clothes on. I just hope that Samuel L. Jackson isn't betting his career on woofers like this.

It pits jumpers, who are people who can teleport, but never seem to do anything positive for society, against Paladins, who want to wipe out the jumpers.  The main jumper character is typical of why I didn't particularly like jumpers.  He robs banks, frames a young rival for his own bank robbery, and never, ever tells his girlfriend the truth.  Heroic behavior?  Hardly. The main Paladin, played by Samuel Jackson, seemed more like a good guy to me, although his methods were of course way too extreme (no trial, death penalty).

It's funny having him as a foil against the more straightlaced and less experienced first jumper, David, played by Hayden Christensen.

They don't have any fear, don't have any comprehension of the worries that plague us all when we travel, or go out alone at night. In Jumper, there's a new category of world traveler: the superhero.

Jumpers, you see, are teleporters.  They can teleport anywhere they've seen and they leave jumpscars - dimensional portals - open for a minute or so after they jump.  If you're fast, you can jump in after them.

That's all you need to know about Jumper, and that's all Jumper is going to share with you.  There are no details behind teleportation (hint: according to modern scientific theory, if you can teleport you can time travel). Filling the role of villain is a shadowy government agency known as Paladins who have figured out how to anchor Jumpers by lassoing them with electrified nets.  They believe that Jumpers are a threat to mankind and see the ability to jump as religious blasphemy - kind of unnecessary, really, as you can imagine that any government agency would be plenty terrified of Jumpers without all the Biblical angst.

But anyway, that's the premise of Jumper: boy meets girl, boy learns to teleport, government agency tries to kill boy, boy meets girl again, repeat until somebody dies.  Only nobody dies.

Jumper has to be the most attractively hollow movie I've seen in a while.  Nothing is resolved. Good guy David Rice (Hayden Christensen, broodingly bland as ever) doesn't ever really learn his lesson, Paladin-hunter Griffin (the far more interesting Jamie Bell) is left in limbo, love interest Millie (also bland Rachel Bilson) doesn't deal with the consequences of a romance with a Jumper, and even archvillain Roland (Samuel L. Jackson with crazy white hair) isn't permanently defeated.  The big reveal about Rice's past has no impact on the plot at all since it's revealed in the last five minutes of the film.

And that's a shame.  Jumpers are weird folks.  They don't need to worry about money, or responsibility, or fear of death.  They just jump away to some other place.  Do that enough and you start to get a little weird.  A relationship for a Jumper has to be quite strange, especially with someone who can't jump - I imagine Jumpers regularly order food and never pay for it, steal clothes and just walk out of the store, and travel all over the globe at a whim...but there only hints of any of this in Jumper.  The film is made up almost entirely of admittedly breathtaking special effects.

There's a reason so many reviewers keep asking for a sequel.  Jumper's barely a prologue. For all of its kinetic energy, Jumper's plot sure doesn't move much.",1294963200,,2716,4.746268656716418

OTOH, there's this jealous & bitter ""group"" (gang) whom thinks it's unrighteous to have this ability and hunts (stalks) the JUMPERS in order to kill them because of their JUMPER abilities. And the moral of the story is, IMO, the worlders have a whole army employed to search-n-destroy the ones with GOD-given gifts: It can't be any more conspicuous than this!!!",1293667200,,596,5.340425531914893

3168293,4,B00177Y9ZC,"I watched Jumper (2008) for a second time this week, having seen it for the first time when it came out on DVD a year or two ago.  I really liked the movie when I first saw it, but I love it even more now.  I've got it on my Top 200 Movie list.  It's one of the few films of the last decade that I can honestly say I wish was quite a bit longer.  It's only 88 minutes and it just flies through those few minutes leaving you wanting more...hence Jumper 2 which is in development now.  Another 30 minutes could easily be added to this flick.  The story is simply so intriguing that I felt that more back story and character development could have been included.  But I also appreciate that director Doug Liman gave us a great short film that never seems to have any dead spots for bathroom breaks.  Liman really changed action movie making IMO with The Bourne Identity (2002), which absolutely blew me away when I saw it on DVD.  It still blows me away at how good that movie is when I see it now.  Liman really crafted a new standard for the thinking man's action movie with The Bourne Identity and then Jumper.  Director Paul Greengrass amazingly took Liman's model and made it even better in the Bourne sequels The Bourne Supremacy (2004) and The Bourne Ultimatum (2007).

Back to Jumper...the story is a combination of sci-fi, action and drama.  The blend is perfect because it all seems so believable within the framework of the movie.  It's probably good that Liman doesn't get into explaining how the teleporting is possible, because that might just take away from the story.  Actors Hayden Christensen and Jamie Bell seem perfectly suited to their characters, as does Samuel Jackson as the ""bad guy"".  Even Rachel Bilson as the love interest in the film is good casting, in sharp contrast to the eye candy status of Megan Fox in Transformers (2007).  Don't get me wrong, Megan Fox is gorgeous looking in Transformers...but that's about it.  Whereas Rachel Bilson is gorgeous looking in Jumper, but she's also a talented actor and shows it in this film.

Of course part of what always makes a good action/drama flick is the filming on location.  And Jumper impresses on that level as well.  The cinematography is brilliant and amazingly Liman got limited access to film in the actual Colosseum in Rome...a rare feat for filmmakers.  The Colosseum scenes are impressive for their beauty.  Apparently they had to film those scenes using only natural light since Colosseum Officials wouldn't allow them to set-up equipment on the ground.  So the shots are all handheld with natural light.

Bottom line is that Jumper is a great film.",1286236800,2,2635,4.627155172413793

What really helps to make this story work is the action, and the intentional omission of any attempt to explain how these jumps happen.  I mean, you don't have any conflict with physics when you don't try to explain... the physics!

His mother and what she really is a member of and why she left, is revealed (rather weakily) at the end.  And Samuel L. Jackson's character, while interesting, didn't really provide any detail and why he was hunting those with special abilities.  Apparently, there are different gifts given to different people and he was hunting them down to kill them.  Saying ""Only God should have these powers.""  Well, why was he hunting them?  Where did he come from?  Who is he working for?  All these questions left me with very little answers and so the movie just didn't resolve right.  I assume that when directors do these kind of ""stunts"", they'll open for a sequel.  But, if the movie doesn't grab you the first time, who cares about the characters now.  Once something leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth, very seldom would you try another dose.

3168312,3,B00177Y9ZC,"JUMPER

I remember seeing the trailers for this film when it was released and thinking ""man what a good idea for a film"". Of course it is based on a book I believe so I need to pick that up but any way I was never able to see this but finally did. After seeing this finally I have mixed feelings about it but over all enjoyed it. I have heard a lot of things about this movie and actually agree with most of them. What people love about this film is what I love and what they dislike I also agree with. So if there ever is a sequel to be made I hope they listen to the people on this one.

David Rice is your average kid in school, you know the type, has a crush on a girl but he is shy and bullies pick on him. Turns out that he finally gets the courage to talk to Millie and gets his gift to her thrown out on an ice pond courtesy of bully Mark. This leads to David walking out on the ice and falling in when the ice breaks. Right when he is about to drown his first teleportation occurs, and there is no looking back from that point. He spends the next few years learning about his abilities and robbing banks, sounds like a good life being rich and can go anywhere. But there are things he left behind like the girl he liked, his dad, and oh yeah people are hunting him down. Just another day in the life of a jumper I suppose.

The thing about this film that I found a little disappointing is that there is not any character development for the most part. All the characters are just introduced and off we go, one reason to read the book I guess. Also the film seemed like different movies at times, it needed to find an identity. Still there are so good things that come out of this film such as the action. The action comes plenty of times and always is entertaining and may be the redeeming thing about this film. The fact that they can transport things with them that are very large add to the excitement. Well not fact since this is fictional and all but you know what I mean.

Acting wise Michael Rooker is always a pleasure to see and of course brings forth a good performance, the scene with him and Jackson may be my favorite. Speaking of Jackson you know of course that Samuel L. Jackson brings a little something to the role of the guy trying to kill off the Jumpers. Still I get the feeling he was there for a paycheck. Regardless I love watching him on the screen so I will say he was a plus. Still the scene stealer in my opinion was Jamie Bell who plays Griffin, a fellow Jumper who is hunting Jackson's character. From his accent to the way he really does not care about anyone else he does an excellent job. Of course we have our lead David played by Hayden Christenson who at times seem on in the role but at others off. Still although his performance is shaky at times he seemed like he had fun in the role. His girl played by Rachel Bilson seemed like she had the same problem so I don't know what that was about. Also I would like to mention that Teddy Dunn was great for the short time he was on screen as the bully.

Based on the book by Steven Gould the blame may lay within the writers circle, the film did not know what it wanted to be. Written by people who brought us Mr. & Mrs. Smith, Sherlock Holmes, Fight Club, The Dark Knight, Batman Begins, and the Blade film series I expected more. Of course the mix of three writers or whatever may have been the cause for the unevenness. Of course the director could be the problem since the unevenness could be mixed direction. Still it is hard to say that because this guy directed Go, Swingers [two of my favorite films ever], Mr. & Mrs. Smith, and The Bourne Identity, I guess it is a mix of everything.

Over all I did enjoy this film, much more than most people I did guess from what people I know said about the film. Perhaps that is why I liked the film since I went in with no expectations. Sure when it was first released I would have most likely not liked it but since I waited and heard things it saved the film for me. This is not a classic film but the idea behind it is a great premise. I think a sequel is coming and hopefully it surpasses the first film. I do recommend the film but a rental may be the best idea, you may like it.",1264118400,,4223,4.088057901085645
3168313,5,B00177Y9ZC,What an awesome movie! A great sci-fi that generates energy from the very beginning to the end. Overall this is a enjoyable movie.,1261785600,,130,4.695652173913044
3168314,3,B00177Y9ZC,"Don't get me wrong.  I enjoyed Hayden Christensen's performance in ""Life as a House.""  And I felt he gave a good, strong effort in Star Wars trilogy.  But I just feel he's not the appropriate actor for the lead role of David Rice, the jumper whom the movie revolves around.  The guy discovers his jumping ability as a teenager, and runs away from home, leading to an easy life of crime.  After setting up this background, the movie picks up on David eight years later.

If you pause and think about it, the character David Rice is an immature, small time crook who could basically go anywhere he wants to.  It's okay for him to steal to finance a lavish lifestyle, because he has that one-in-a-billion god-given talent to do it.  Life is easy for David Rice.  And I just think Christensen plays the David Rice role a bit too straight and narrow.  Rice is crafty, beguiling, the big easy, and Christensen does not role play Rice in that way.  Christensen has the good looks of a leading man for this film, but not the sly, charming, and shifty manner needed for this role.

3168315,3,B00177Y9ZC,My first blu Ray movie. I usually like time travel movies. So this movie is a great movie to watch. Good story line and concept.,1259971200,,128,4.16
3168316,3,B00177Y9ZC,"I rented and watched this movie off of Netflix recently, when I have asked people I know if they liked it most people either hadn't seen it or said it was just okay so I wasn't expecting much out of this. However I did actually enjoy this movie. It gets going pretty fast and keeps this pace through out the whole movie and at 88 minutes long its just the right length as to not get stale. Hayden Christensen plays David Rice who has the ability to Jump, Jumping in this movie is an ability some have that allows them to teleport to anywhere they have been before instantly. After learning of this ability David runs away from home and his alcoholic father to New York, where he robs a bank. David is living a wonderful life and all seems well until Samuel L. Jackson's character Roland Cox who is a member of a secret organization that hunts down and kills Jumpers known as The Paladins catches up with him. The rest of the movie is a globe trotting action extravagnaza as David must protect his childhood sweet heart from this vicious hunter, and teams up with an unstable Jumper Griffin played by jamie Bell.

  So all in all this movie was worth the rental, and I would encourage anyone who has not seen it to check it out. Christensen does a much better job in this movie than his boring performance in StarWars(although his evil scenes in StarWars were good), and the special effects, locations, and action sequences were pretty cool as well. I give this movie a 3 out of 5.",1257033600,,1480,4.413919413919414
3168317,4,B00177Y9ZC,"I remember really looking forward to Jumper when the teaser and initial previews came out. Then, suddenly, the movie was there in front of me on Blu-Ray, and to say I was only a little disappointed would be an understatement.

Rather than the big action ride I anticipated, Jumper is instead a showcase for digital effects, camera work, and the power of HD. The movie focuses on people called ""jumpers,"" who are able to teleport. The main character of the film, played by Anakin himself, does what most people would do if they found themselves given such great power: use it for his own gains.

Most people will claim if they could teleport they'd use it for good, but let's be honest: a majority of you would use it the same way David Rice does: teleporting to rob banks, but mostly just using it to travel the world instantaneously and fulfill his own cravings. Want Chinese from China? You got it. Want to surf in Fiji but also have a one-night stand in London? You got that, too.

Thankfully, the movie isn't just David Rice partaking in vices. Alongside the jumpers, there's a group known as the Paladins, which (if you've ever played any games or D&D) you can guess are religiously based. Led in the film by Samuel L Jackson, the Paladins make it their duty to extinguish the jumpers, believing only God should have the ability to be anywhere at once.

Throw in the clich girlfriend childhood love interest, and the stranger who seems bad at first but obviously ends up ""good,"" and you've got Jumper. It's an action film filled with great scenes and spectacular camerawork, but outside of SLJ there's little positive when it comes to performances (and even he seems to have phoned this one in), and even less positive when it comes to plot, development and a sense of closure at the end. There will obviously be a Jumper 2, so we'll have to see if they can do a better job with that one.

In terms of the Blu-Ray transfer, Jumper is one of the best discs yet in terms of visual quality. Coming in at 1080p with a 2.35:1 framed image, the film looks much, much better than the plot showcases. Colors are crisp, and several scenes look outright realistic. If you have an HDTV and don't mind the mindless action films from the 80s and earlier, give Jumper a try, if for no other reason to see how awesome films like Predator would have been with this quality of picture.

Everything else about Jumper is so-so. The audio is 5.1 but never too outstanding (or too poor), and the extras do the job but little above their requirement. Featured are obvious ones such as the making of the film (which I admit does do a better job than some), a look into the special effects process, and another look at adapting the novel into the film, which is my favorite piece. No matter what you take out of Jumper, it will likely make you interested in author Steven Gould's original book. Take solace in knowing the book is (like usual) much better than the film.

CONTENT: 2/5

Jumper is a popcorn flick, plain and simple. You won't talk about it after you watch it, and chances are you won't remember it two years from now. Watch it for some mindless entertainment, and expect nothing more. Sometimes, that's more than enough.

VIDEO: 5/5

One of the best Blu-Ray transfers I've seen. It stands up proud with Narnia and the other fantastic video achievements. Scenes look real, the effects are amazing, and the colors are perfect. If you want to show off Blu-Ray to friends or family, this is the disc to use.

AUDIO: 3/5

5.1 (which is the average these days), but nothing stands out. There's no real loud action, but nothing falters. The effects sound nice, and the music is decent, but, overall, Jumper's audio is completely middle of the road.

REPLAY: 1/5

If you watch movies with friends to go all MST3K style, this one has much higher replay. Alone, however, you'll watch it once then likely forget about it. Unless, of course, you want to marvel at the technical achievements on your HDTV.

EXTRAS: 3.5/5

The extras you'd expect from a big budget film. The most memorable is a look into the adaptation process, and that will hopefully lead more people to the book (and other books in the future!).

OVERALL: 3.5/5

As a movie itself, Jumper is probably only a 1.5 or a 2. With the Blu-Ray presentation, video, and others, however, it's a much better BRD than it is a movie. It's spectacular looking which makes the haphazard plot and shoddy acting bearable, and that's saying a lot for how nice the movie looks. If you have an HDTV, you may want to at least rent this just to see how nice it looks. Whether or not you buy, however, depends on your tolerance of mindless, poorly structured action movies. Basically, 80s action fans will dig it.",1249689600,7,4742,4.5588235294117645

3168319,4,B00177Y9ZC,"Jumper reminds me of a more hyper kinetic version of ""Highlander"" - at least in the storyline - where one individual who belongs to a special mutant race that has existed over time must now fight for lone survival in the modern world.  Substitute the swords with the teleportation, and throw in a bit of the stylised action from ""Wanted"" and you have a nice wham-bam film.  The trailer for Jumper made the film look more complicated than it really is.  It's actually an easy film to watch.

Hayden Christensen (admittedly not one of my favourites after Star Wars) - is very convincing in what could be his best role.  Samuel Jackson, as always - excels at whatever he's doing, and he's a bada** dude in this one.

The film succeeds in moving the action from scene to scene.  Less successful and less convincing is the attempt to inform us about the Jumper's origins and their nemesis - the Paladins.  Because the film is so contemporary and slick in its style, sometimes it's hard to buy into the theory of an ""age-old past.""

3168322,3,B00177Y9ZC,"With the plot of ""Jumper"" recapped several times throughout this Amazon review section, let's just ""jump"" right into my thoughts on this little bugger. Blink-and-it's-over movie, blink-and-it's-over review... appropriate no?  Anyway, away we go...

This fast-paced (but not ridiculously fast-paced as the trailer seemed to indicate) ""X-Men"" style adventure is worth a look for its solid premise, edgy characters, and exciting confrontations.  I especially liked the occasional nods in the direction of character complexity: Hayden Christensen's ""Jumper"" character maybe isn't the basically nice guy he initially seems to be and Sam Jackson's relentlessly hunting ""Paladin"" character maybe isn't really as bad as HE initially seems.  In other words, maybe Jackson's character is right and all past jumpers HAVE become rotten eggs- dangerous rotten eggs- after a while, and need to be put down.  Clearly much was left open for exploration in a sequel.

Strangely, some of that exploration could have been done in this very movie, as it's only an hour and twenty-nine minutes long.  Could it have killed 'em to give us ten more minutes of character material and background info to supplement the generous (and, admittedly, very well done) action sequences?  At an hour and 40 or 45 minutes, this movie would still have been lean and mean, but also a little richer.  Still, ""Jumper"" is worth a look for fans of super-powered characters and gritty adventure.

The Jumpers ""jump"" all over the place and NO ONE seems to notice, even though they teleport in the middle of huge crowds. They are always teleporting OTHER random innocent bystanders to other parts of the world with ZERO consequences and we knew NOTHING about Samuel L. Jacksons character in this!......why was he hunting the Jumpers? what's his back story? so many annoying unanswered things!
The rest of the cast were HUGELY under developed as well, especially Rachel Bilson, who had more to do in the O.C than she did in this. The only real highlight was that guy from Billy Elliott [forgot his name], and Hayden Christianson looked good in it............everything else was a fast paced, empty mess.",1245283200,,960,4.754491017964072
3168325,2,B00177Y9ZC,"I love this 'theme'. This idea. The beginning was cool. Some effects were cool. I'm such a science fiction freak I will generally watch even pretty bad movies without complaint, just happy to have a little more of my genre make the big screen.

Yet... my 12 year old and I watched this. The plot... needed help so badly even she was scornful. It's one of those cases where the only reason the plot works at all is because the writers make all the characters uncommunicative morons, who get in situations solely because they're so stupid that you can't even feel sorry for them. We were too busy yelling at them to feel sorry for them.

Then there's the whole jumper-history and the lead's mother issue. Since the people pursuing the jumpers are not jumpers themselves, what are the odds that some one in a billion trait would show up in the kid of a hunter? Had they written it so they were all jumpers but on opposite sides, that might have had a chance.

To make matters worse, the one truly decent character in the show was apparently killed by the hero, or close enough (even that was not entirely clear), dashing the last ray of optimism we had for him or his worthiness. Before it was over we were genuinely hoping the hero would die a sudden and fiery death. Totally annoying.

But I love the whole concept this is based on. I feel like this COULD, potentially, have been an awesome movie. I would love to see more along these lines. It just doesn't seem like anybody with a brain was closely enough involved with it to have it come out less than embarrassing.

If your only interest is some cool effects in nice settings, have at it. It does have that, it's an ""action movie"" and I liked that part of it.

If you want even half a plot or halfway intelligent characters, though, this is probably not the show for you.",1243123200,2,1824,4.413690476190476

1. A boy is being smacked about by a Neighborhood Bully.

2. During this smacking around, he discovers that he has the power to jump from one place to another.

3. He uses this power to steal some things and make a good life for himself.

4. There come these people that (for some reason that is never explained) want to kill the Jumpers.

5. The first Jumper meets another jumper who is more experienced and we find that he has a plan to kill the Bad Guys.

6. Eventually the Bad Guys are killed and the First Jumper Gets The Girl and the movie is over.

Comments: Essentially, the special effects are great, but the plot is very silly/ corny/ thin. The female character was REALLY ANNOYING (do you know any normal people who have a voice like that?) and no explanation was given as to why this conflict existed. (This recalls the movie ""Hancock,"" where a conflict was made up for the point of the movie without any underlying explanation.) Or who was who and how they came to be who. Or how one of the Bad Guys ended up giving birth to one of the Good Guys.

The movie chronicles the life of this ""jumper"" from the day he learned of his ability while in school, through his exploits using his skills, to his final confrontation with his mother, who is a paladin; someone who hunts down and kills jumpers.  Our jumper is played by Hayden Christiansen, who puts in another fine job that again demonstrates he is a good actor, contrary to what George Lucas did to him to in the most recent Star Wars movies.  The Paladin who hunts him is played by Samuel Jackson, who I believe has played in one too many roles as a government agent.

They added the whole Paladin story which was none existent in the book also. I know movies never stick the the same plot as the book, but i just thought it could of been way better than it was. Don't get me wrong i still enjoyed it as a sci-fi flick.

First of all the main chacater is a Jumper who is able to go from place to place in the blink of the eye.  He seemed to have had this ability from childhood, but never realized it.  He is 15 before he knows he can move thru space.  My question is how did he get this power.  Turns out there are other Jumpers, no one questions this?  Than there are hunters of the Jumpers....who the heck are these guys and wehre did they come from.

It seemed for a brief second that there was a chance to make our Jumper a Super Hero, there is a scene with people drowing in a river the newscaster says they will need a miracle to survive.  The Jumper is watching on tv, does he go save them?  Turns out that the kid is a selfish young man who uses his powers to seduce the ladies and steal things.  Never once does he ask himself why he was given the power.

The other issue was the relationship with his childhood sweetheart.  She thinks he is dead than he walks back into her life and he sweeps her off her feet, no questions asked.  She plays a way to gulable character and comes off as unbelivable.

3) He discovers another jumper and is pursued by a murderous group of ""jumper-killers"" called paladins.
4) He eludes the paladins, runs off with his high school sweetheart and discovers that his mother was one of the paladins.

Um, rob banks to set up a cushy lifestyle so he can pick up chicks by night in London and have lunch on top of the Great Sphinx of Egypt.

Heaven forbid young David would do anything constructive with such an extraordinary gift. . .

But wait.  There's more.  David discovers he's not alone; there are other jumpers out there (and they're all young adults; go figure).  And these jumpers are being pursued by paladins--sanctimonious Bible thumpers devoted to kill all jumpers because (we suppose, as we're never really given an explanation) they are ""evil.""  The paladins are led by a white-haired, very devout Samuel L. Jackson.  So, bewildered-looking David teams up with a fellow jumper (Jamie Bell, who is a not-so-nice jumper) to battle Jackson and the paladins--and that's when the goofiness takes over to the point poor girlfriend's (Rachel Bilson) apartment is totally trashed.

Oh, and the electric ""ropes"" the paladins use to trap the jumpers so reminded me of plumbing snakes.  Just an observation.

3168360,1,B00177Y9ZC,"...wait, wasn't that Sliders?  Okay, not exactly the same, but comparing those two is a good way to show everything that was wrong with Jumper.

The concept is fine, but the execution was sorely lacking.  There's no character development because so much time is covered over the course of the movie.  We get no insight into the main character's thoughts, motivations, or personality.  He comes off as shallow and two-dimensional.  He goes from scared kid to conscienceless, arrogant jerk in ten minutes.  There's never any question or delving into whether what he's doing is right or wrong (he's a thief, plain and simple) or how he could use his power for good instead of just wasting it.  Granted, who wouldn't want to gallivant about the world, carefree, I suppose, but the moral struggle would be very much a part of the character.

Unlike in Sliders, the Jumpers have full control over where they go and when.  Still, the TV show format of one or two jumps and an adventure per show would be far more entertaining than this jumbled, boring, barely explained plotline.  Then again, this would require character development and plot.

Even the pivotal plot point about the secret organization is boring, focusing on a religious inquisition instead of, oh, upholding the law.  Of all the trite and cheesy story lines (scientific experiments, military uses, etc) this is not only the tritest and cheesiest, but also the most yawn-inducing.

Even as a mindless action movie this one fails, unless your aim is to become a brain-dead zombie.  The greatest part of this movie was the end, simply because it meant it was over.  A huge disappointment, because there were so many elements (his mother, for one) which could have been interesting if they'd done more than scratch the surface.",1223424000,6,1784,4.8966666666666665

3168362,1,B00177Y9ZC,"Time-traveling, teleporting. I've been always kind of a sucker for these sci-fi premises. What would you do if you could teleport yourself to basically any place on the face of the earth? Steven Gould, in his novel Jumper, uses this premise and gives his characters the innate ability to instantly teleport themselves. It is definitely an interesting foundation, however, Director Doug Liman and screenwriters David S. Goyer, Jim Uhls and Simon Kinberg do little to exploit this promising idea, and come up with a movie that takes us through NYC, Rome, Egypt, Tokyo, but ends up going absolutely nowhere.

Hayden Christensen is David Rice, a normal teenager until he finds he's got the ability to teleport himself from place to place when he first ""jumps"" spontaneously in order to escape his abusive father (Michael Rooker). Having run away, he learns to control his ability and then does, I guess, what every one of us, being a teleporting teenager, would do: go into a bank's vault and get away with several thousands in cash. The good thing is that Jumpers do not have to worry about mingling their own molecules with a fly's, as they can actually hold onto anything: other people, cars, even parts of a building, and teleport to another place arriving safe and sound on the other side with whoever or whatever they were carrying.

David grows up and, by that time, he's already got a penthouse at a luxurious NY building and he's been all over the world. The usual day for him involves having breakfast on top of the Giza's Sphinx in Egypt, spending the afternoon surfing the best waves of the season in Hawaii or Fiji, and having a drink at a popular pub in London while checking out and hitting on the hot babes at night.

Yes, life is good for David, that is, until the bad guys appear. He learns that he is not the only one with that unusual gift and also learns that there is actually a group of people that hunt Jumpers for a living. Roland, played by Samuel L. Jackson, has been following David since he first broke in at his first bank. He is the leader of the Paladins, that particular group of individuals whose only goal in life seems to be killing all the Jumpers and, apparently, this war between Jumpers and Paladins has been going on for hundreds if not thousands of years.

But David doesn't look like he is the type of guy that'd enjoy messing up with other people's lives. Granted, he steals money, but then he is basically a good guy that likes to pamper himself and enjoy a low-profile, big-shot-like life and spend big amounts of money. I'd bet the IRS would nail him before The Paladins would. Ok yes, I guess with time David could get bored of all the indulgences and turn to the bad side; maybe teleport himself right into the Pentagon secret archives and steal some sensitive material and then try to sell it or just give it away to a terrorist organization. I haven't read the book, but I understand that, in the original Gould's novel, there is no Paladin organization and the villains (or at least the guys chasing David), are actually NSA agents who are trying to understand these powers and get them to ""good"" use. I think Roland says that he works for the NSA, which initially made sense to me, but then, this character turns out to be just an obsessed, fanatical hunter. This is where the movie starts going nowhere. We spend the rest of the time watching Roland following and fighting David, while he drags with him his love interest, Millie (Rachel Blison), around the world. Throw in the appearance of Griffin (Jamie Bell), another paranoid Jumper, and the brief and inexplicable appearance of David's mother (Diane Lane), who's a Paladin herself (!?), and we end up with this 88 minute mess.

There are so many inconsistencies in this movie that it is hard to follow. For instance, I really never bought or understood Roland. What's his motivation? Nobody knows. The movie doesn't stop to elaborate on this issue. Maybe he's jealous because he can't teleport himself, but, in any case, he seems to be pretty much settled as he can travel all over the world and it is obvious that he doesn't depend on commercial airlines schedules.

Roland utters at some point something like: ""God is the only one that should have those powers!"", and if you consider that the name Paladins has been associated with the highest officials of the Catholic Church, the religious connotation is inevitable. I assume that most religious people don't question what their religion says, they just comply. Liman and company are like that, they don't care. They don't give the Paladins a cause, they just let them hate the Jumpers so much, and then they give us Roland, an overzealous, inquisitorial-like priest whose religion states that its worst deadly sin is teleporting.

Roland is blind for mysterious reasons, but I'm not. If David's mother is a Paladin and she won't kill her own son, why not convince her to enlist David as a Paladin? Paladins can not ""jump"", so it might be helpful for them to have an actual jumper in the ranks. Why not convince David to partner with him and do something good for the entire human race, or just themselves? Can you imagine the possibilities? This is what saves this movie from the worst rating. I've spent myself quite some time thinking about these, and when movies make me think, I like them. Forget about having David teleporting medical supplies to a disaster stricken, inaccessible region, or having David rescue a bunch of people from the top of a burning building. How about being the world's most feared paparazzo? Jump into a celebrity's home, catch him or her off guard, and get away with some photos that could be sold to the tabloids for millions, or how about just establishing the world's fastest and most effective courier service?

3168366,2,B00177Y9ZC,"What if an average guy from Ann Arbor, Michigan discovers at age 15 that he has the ability to travel instantaneously to other locations?  How would he handle that ability?  Those questions are answered in ""Jumper,"" directed by Doug Liman.

""Jumper"" is based on an intriguing premise:  a person has the ability to teleport himself at will to anywhere in the world, whether it be just a few feet away in his apartment or thousands of miles across the globe.  Sounds like a quality belonging to a spandex-clad superhero more than an average Joe.  After all, Superman essentially has that ability because of his super-speed, and Superman dates back to 1938.

David Rice (Hayden Christensen) realizes he has this ""jumping"" ability when he almost drowns.  In a split second, he finds himself in the midst of bookshelves in the Ann Arbor Public Library along with enough water to destroy a third of the library's book collection.

With a cartoonishly mean father (Michael Rooker) and more than his share of teen angst, David decides to make for the big city, his teleportation talent the road to a whole new life.  But this invisible zipping from space to place doesn't come easily, as David practices teleportation in Central Park, slamming into trees while learning to fine tune his ability.

The beginning of ""Jumper"" is very intriguing, and the film promises an enjoyable ride.  But so much goes wrong along the way, the movie crumbles before our eyes.  Let's take the character of David.  Though he's not a traditional superhero, we've become conditioned to expect that a lad lucky enough to have unusual strengths will use them for good.  What does David do?  He breaks into bank vaults, steals huge sums of money, sets himself up in luxury apartments all over the world, picnics atop the Sphinx, surfboards in Fiji, hangs out, literally, from Big Ben in London, and picks up girls all over the world.  He's not exactly bettering mankind or combating evil.

The element of conflict that drives the film comes in the character of Roland (Samuel L. Jackson), a Paladin.  The Paladins are Jumper hunters.  Why?  Roland makes a brief comment that only God should have the right to be omnipresent.  Huh?  Is that it?  Yep.  For half the movie, David jumps from place to place to stay ahead of the Paladins, who want to capture him because of pseudo-religious self-righteousness.

Christensen is a likable actor and he succeeds in making us care about his David, even though the character is a shallow, pretty-boy hedonist.  I suppose the good will he engendered as young Anakin Skywalker has spilled over to this less interesting character.

Jackson mails in this performance.  His appearance with snow-white hair is a lot of fun, though his character is humorless.  We've seen the same from this actor before:  intense close-ups, slow, threatening delivery of dialogue, and attitude a mile wide.  His Paladin is a warrior, which allows for action and violence.  But wouldn't it be interesting if Jackson played the role more low-key, using psychological terror rather than physical force?

The film shines when we're introduced to Griffin (Jamie Bell, ""Billy Elliot""), a fellow Jumper David meets in Rome's Coliseum.  Griffin serves as the expositional mouthpiece of the film, informing David (and the audience) that David isn't the only Jumper in the world and providing back story about the Paladins' ongoing persecution of Jumpers.  Bell has enormous energy and a streetwise toughness that contrasts sharply with Cristensen's laid-back style.  Whenever Bell is on screen, he commands it.

The dutiful love interest of sorts is provided by the lovely Anna-Sophia Robb as Millie, an adolescent crush from David's hometown, whom he looks up years later and invites to accompany him to Rome.  What happened to ""Want to have a cup of coffee?""  As written, the role of Millie is meant to be serviceable eye candy, and Millie is swept up in the usual machinations of ""things beyond her control,"" becoming more involved in the plot than she should be.

A trilogy of writers are responsible for the final screenplay of ""Jumpers,"" which looks as if huge chunks are missing.  Things move too swiftly, even for a movie about a guy who can scoot from city to city in a millisecond.  Viewers are entitled to enough time to get to know the characters so that they care about what happens to them.  A quick dissolve, for instance, shows David going from 15 to 20-something, still living in the same dumpy hotel he came to years before.  Why is he still there when the cash he's stolen can surely allow him to afford better digs?  And why are the teleportation scenes so inconsistent?  Sometimes David whisks to another location with just a rush of air and a swooshing sound.  Other times, there is serious damage to concrete and floor tiles.

The locations are interesting, but seem to be there more as scenic backdrops to the story than as integral parts of it.  With the exception of the Rome sequence, those taking place in Cairo, Tokyo, Prague, and Mexico are intended to be impressive to audiences that have seen all these places many times over on screen.  They no longer carry the same impact.

Rated PG-13, ""Jumper"" uses an interesting premise, but takes all the wrong turns as it unfolds its tale, offering a movie experience long on special effects, short on meaty story and gripping characters.",1221955200,8,5388,4.884233737596472

And I liked it. it wasn't perfect - not remotely - but it has a certain charm probably because of it's unrealized potential. It could have been great but fell just short. I see a few reasons for this but the main being 1) it was only about 90 minutes long. They should have given it that extra 30 minutes, turned it into a 2 hour movie and tied up a few loose ends and take us into reason number 2) character development. You want the relationship between David and Millie but you don't buy it as much as you should because it wasn't developed properly. Also, they attempted to make David not a bad guy - and I guess over all he wasn't - but they could have done better. The notes he left at the bank (which I missed upon first viewing due to the disk skipping) hinted that he was a guy with a conscience, and he never actually killed anyone like Griffin so that earns him brownie points as well, but they could have done better and showing just how ""different"" he was in regards to Roland's expectations of him. Now an extra 30 minutes to develop the story wouldn't have have perfected it. There were other scenes throughout that could have helped develop it as well but the extra time would have helped in some way. I know they mentioned possible sequels if it did well enough. The thing about leaving room for sequels is that while you may want to leave some questions unanswered to be answered in the sequel you can't leave EVERYTHING unanswered and I think this first attempt left a lot of things hanging, more than they should have. Still, despite these failings, I did enjoy and buy it. It's a fun movie and being a sci-fi/action/romance person, this fit my bill despite the weak presentation of plot. However I was grateful to the warning about the 2 disk edition since I've already got an iTunes copy.

Anakin Skywalker battles the forces of evil by using the force and ...Oh. Wait a minute. Wrong movie. Sorry `bout that. Well not truly sorry; just a tad peeved at this flick and how horribly it went astray.

It is true, however, that the grim Hayden Christiansen of the new&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars/dp/B00006HBUJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars</a>&nbsp;fame is the main character (David Rice), and he has some unique abilities: he can jump through space/time at will, breakfasting on top of the Sphinx in Egypt, jumping back to his New York flat for luncheon pizza, then heading out to surf in Hawaii that same day ...or even hour if he wished it. He learns he has this power during his high school years (the young David is played by Max Thieriot - see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Astronaut-Farmer/dp/B00005JPLE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Astronaut Farmer</a>) and nearly dies after falling through some thin river ice. He miraculously reappears in a local library, water and all, soaking book stacks. David was trying to retrieve a gift from the ice that he'd gotten for a girl he liked named Millie (Rachel Bilson), but he quickly learns that his jumping abilities make him something of a freak, and believes Millie would see him that way too. So he runs away and into the world.

Once out amongst the populace he learns how to steal, including jumping into bank vaults and taking as much money as he will. But this also gains him notice by a secret society of men known as Paladins (look up Palatine and you'll find interesting parallels). The head of this religious order is a man named Roland (Samuel L. Jackson,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Snakes-on-a-Plane/dp/B000JBXHQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Snakes on a Plane</a>), and his goal is to kill Jumpers (""No one but God should have these powers!"")

So the battle between Jumper and Paladin is set and interesting shots and gadgets dot the screen. And that's about it...

The biggest flaw with the film is that there's no set-up to it. We don't really know why Jumpers can do what they do (Genetic/<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Men/dp/B000HEVZ9E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Men</a>-like mutation? Alien DNA? Gods?). We also don't know who funds the Paladins with all of their travel, gadgets, and many, many members. I can guess that it might have been the Roman Catholic Church, but it's never even hinted at. If it was the church, then how did Roland get access to secret information, including bank vaults, police records, etc.?

With all of its story flaws, Jumpers does have some amazing CGI. Particularly, there was one scene where Roland is in the desert and a Jumper brings a double-decker London bus with him through a jump scar and tries to roll it on top of Roland. That was incredible and made my jaw drop.

But that was it. All style over any substance, Jumper was so weak along storylines that I didn't much care what happened to anyone in the film. The worst part is that the ending was obviously set up for a sequel. Maybe Mace Windu (Jackson's Star Wars character) could magically appear and wield 'The Force' to kill that off, too.",1220486400,,3343,5.467054263565892

He abruptly discovers his gift as a high school aged kid (Max Thieriot) escaping death-by-drowning from an icy river.  At first he doesn't believe what happened, but when he escapes the rath of his drunken father in the same manner, he decides it must be real.  This is his ticket out of this broken family (his mother left when he was 5) and this small go-no-where town.  But, a teen ager on the run in New York will have a tough time living without a job.  So, David hones his skills and finances his independence by robbing (jumping) banks.  The story skips forward to find our 25-year old hero, played now by Hayden Christensen (Anikan SkyWalker/Darth Vader in Star Wars II, III), extremely skilled in his jumping ability.  He's now a world wide playboy jumping to multiple countries and playing the field.  Enter our arch enemy the ""CIA"" operative Roland Cox (Samuel L. Jackson) bent on destroying all ""jumpers"" on earth and you have the backdrop for any graphic novel.  Throw in David's old high school flame Millie (Rachel Bilson) and an experienced loner ""jumper"" Griffin (Jamie Bell), and you have some unwilling team mates set against Roland.  What follows are some 100 jumps in multiple CGI executions covering some ""20 cities in 14 countries"" (Wikipedia).  The action is certainly there and the directing for these rapidly moving scenes was fairly tight.  The cinematography was very good and the CGI was woven nicely into the action.  The screen play was a little lacking, so the actors didn't have much to develop or shine, save Sam Jackson who always makes the best of what he's given.  But, at least the film keeps you interested as you're taken for a ride across the globe.  Don't look for any academy awards here, but this one might wet your pallet for a weekend do-you-have-a-movie-where-things-blow-up fix.  The end might leave you wanting the sequel, yet for others it may leave you wanting to know where the return envelop is.  For me, I had fun.",1219795200,3,2055,4.743661971830986

3168378,4,B00177Y9ZC,"Jumper is a surprisingly entertaining movie for the ""Superhero"" genre fans. Not that Hayden Christensen wears a funny suit or saves people, he just would fit in with X-Men's Kitty Pride like a brother. He's known as a Jumper, a person with the ability to transport to any place on Earth just by thinking of it in an instant. However, since the dawn of time, these jumpers are hunted by a group known as Paladins, led by Samuel L. Jackson (sporting some of the most metallic silver hair this side of Steve Martin) who for no other reason hunt and kill the Jumpers down due to only tradition and envy. So after a few years of robbing banks and traveling the globe, he finally is spotted, escapes back home to his old girlfriend, meets up with another Jumper, and takes on the baddies once and for all.

Now normally I scoff at today's CGI effects, but this time it was done right. Every jump looked very neat and it always was a cool guessing game to think for a split second as to where they'd end up. The action sequences are well played out and the storyline's quick, to the point, and doesn't tend to drag anywhere. Sure, Christensen's acting still could use a little ""jump"" itself, but seemed to fit with the character here & Jackson can still play the hated bad guy better than most of his acting equals.

In conclusion, Jumper is a fun eye-candy movie. A cool and somewhat original story that keeps you interested throughout. Recommended to most, really close to a must-buy for fantasy/comic-book fans. Jump to it!

3168379,2,B00177Y9ZC,"An interesting story, brought together by interesting talent, falls oddly short of expectations in this action movie with fantasy elements.
The stall is set out early, as an intro shows Hayden Christensen discovering his ability to teleport (jump) from place to place.  He indulges himself with his ability, leaving behind the love of his teen life and living in style, until he meets another Jumper, played by Jamie Bell.  They are tracked by the Paladin, a secret group led by Samuel Jackson who are hell bent on destroying Jumpers.  And that's really about it - and I don't mean that I am saving the rest of the plot to avoid writing spoilers - that really is about it, it really devolves into a `does-he-get-the-girl' movie at this point, winding up after a scant 84 minutes, seemingly in the middle of the story.  Why do the Paladin want to destroy Jumpers?  Will Christensen achieve his stated goal of destroying the oddly coiffured Jackson character?  What makes the Jumpers what they are?  How many are there?  Will Christensen's character ever come out of his permanent sulk?  All remain unanswered - presumably for the inevitable sequel.
Hayden Christensen does little here to dispel notions that his acting is on a par with your nearest oak tree, but Jamie Bell is interestingly edgy and has the benefit of the films few humorous moments.  Bilson looks terrific of course but really has little to do once the special effects starts, and Jackson is really only going through the motions.  None of this really matters with such thinly drawn characters, and the director smooths over the cracks with his efficient action scenes.  The movie does crackle along with innovative set pieces which pique the interest, ultimately however leaving you all the more unfulfilled at the (partly literally) cliffhanger ending.
Overall, you're left with the feeling that as much as there is to like, this would have been much better edited down to a 20 minute introduction to a much more interesting and complex film.  Wait for the next movie and watch it as a double bill.",1219190400,,2067,4.871428571428571

The views of the colosseum are stunning and also the setting in Egypt. The story moves quickly, the villains are hard to identify: are they the jumpers that steal and cause mayhem, or is it the paladins that trap and the stab the jumpers to death? Will our jumper who we have come to know escape? If so, how does he do it? What happens to the paladins who are after him?

3168382,4,B00177Y9ZC,"I have watched this movie three times now.  Just think about the concept, a human being just thinking where he wants to be and then being there.  Not only that, taken things with him as he jumps from one location to another.  The concept of the marvel comics superhero teaming up was mentioned from one of the jumpers to the other.  So is the Jumper a superhero?  Actually when you think about it, He is one of the most power superhero ever written on paper.  None of the super hero's could hold him.  He is all powerful.  I love the concept.

There are two types of Jumpers, ones that kill, and others that don't.  But it seem all of them steal.  Money is no object as they can jump into any bank and take what they want.  Jump into any store and what they see is theirs.

I am just crazy about the concept.  The movie I thought was well done.  Doug Liman, the Director can be proud of a job well done.  Hayden Christensen was much more animated than Star Wars.  May God, he is an actor, can you believe it?

If the main character was likeable in any way this movie may have had a chance to be fondly remembered on video.  Alas, the character has no redeeming qualities, in fact he has only one quality to speak of:  Selfishness!

He risks his ""girlfriend's"" life for his selfish pleasure, he steals instead of working or doing good and by the end of the movie, he has not learned anything.  Samuel L. Jackson's character is just as poorly written and one-dimensional.

The cinematography and locations along with the effects are fairly entertaining, but beyond that the film has little to offer. Better to catch it for free on TV sometime or wait about a year and it will be in the dollar bins.",1218585600,2,821,4.863309352517986

The effects, and tools the ""Jumper Cops"" have, are pretty friggin cool too.  CGI and special effects have come a long way.  Also the Cast is pretty good too. But they take the effects away and the dude is still Anakin who wants everything the easy way.

Such is the power of Teleportation, the theme of Jumper. The movie has a somewhat slow start but once things are in place there's no looking back. Hayden Christens with his piercing gaze  does a good job. But his jumper partner, with the Irish accent was both sick and snobbish. Although the movie does not explicitly reveal it Hayden does have a strong connection  with his father at home and his mother who had abandoned him long ago. When he enquires about the same of his jumper partner (the guy with the accent) check out the answer the latter gives. Only a heartless snob would reply like that. Rachel Bilser was sweet and charming. Samuel L Jackson adds sparkle. One scene, the killing of a Jumper was brutal.

Those super powers were cool, and I know that this movie is indeed factually based upon real things since I have experienced them myself. Kudos to the writers/producers for revealing this stuff to the general public at large, man. I couldn't understand half the things spoken by Griffin (Jamie Bell) but the action made up for this small problem.  Diane Lane looked kinda old, man.  Other than that, it was a great trip man.  I was on the edge of my seat inside my man cave while I watched.  I thanked God several times during the movie for such a wonderfully done film.  Thanks God!

3168387,2,B00177Y9ZC,"In 1992, Steven Gould published his first novel, called _Jumper_, which was an immediate success and has remained popular since. In 2004, he published a sequel, _Reflex_, which, like many sequels, wasn't nearly as good -- though it wasn't really bad. Then, in 2007, as the long-awaited film version was underway, Gould rewrote the story more cinematically and published it as _Jumper: Griffin's Story_. You would think at least one of those would be the basis for the movie, right? Nope. Only a few points are carried over from the page to the screen: from the first book, the character's name and the fact that he robs a bank. (In the book, it was done in desperation because he was too young to get a job in the big city; in the film, he does it almost as a lark, just because he can.) From the sequel comes the notion that there exists a secret society of teleport-hunters who will stop at nothing to exterminate them. (In the book, no real reason is given for their murderous crusade; in the film, it's merely attributed to ""religious fanaticism,"" with no explanation of what's ""religious"" about it.) The plot, you should excuse the expression, jumps all over the place, painting David Rice as a not very sympathetic slacker with too much money. Hayden Christensen isn't very believable, being much too old for the role, and Samuel L. Jackson as the Bad Guy is painful to watch. Jamie Bell is somewhat better as the rather nihilistic Brit, Griffin, taken (sort of) from the third novel. And the character of David's mother, played by Diane Lane, makes no sense at all: She's a committed teleport-killer, but she's protecting her teleport son? But she still hasn't changed her mind about the necessity of wiping them out -- so she just wishes him luck? Gimme a break. This could have been a really good film, and it apparently took three screenwriters to ruin it.",1217376000,2,1866,4.692073170731708

One then sees the star-studded crew behind this caper and is almost certain to savor it: the director of The Bourne Identity, and script writers of Fight Club, Batman Begins and Mr. and Mrs. Smith.

Yet, despite all that they ought to have had going for themselves, somehow these cooks managed to make a stunning scattershot mess of this sci-fi broth. They decided, I suppose, that a movie named Jumper would do well with a jumpy screenplay.  Why trouble yourself with exploring the socio-psychological ramifications of teleportation or some such meaningful effort, when you can opt for a wannabe-epic adventure targeted at the nose-pierced crowd?

Landscapes switch at 60,000 frames per second. Our hero has lunch in Rome only to digest it all while surfing in Fiji. You know how it works. The teleporting bits are fine, but how a puny little teenager who was chronically ragged by bullies at school learned to do all the funky stuff at will, goes a trifle unexplained.

Soon enough, our supra-hero discovers that his abilities have landed him in the persecuted half of an old historic war. Sigh. On one side are his band of teleporting buddies called Jumpers -- all mysteriously young and fit, one quite thoughtfully a British (where were the token black and Chinese buddies?). On the other side are efficient ""Paladins"" organized to demolish them. The chief Paladin is a self-same Samuel Jackson sporting a silver crew-cut.

Now, for some uncommon reason, David has a nice revealing collection of photographs at home. Snapshots of *all* the places in the world to which he ""jumps"". Which naturally aids our chief Paladin's search. But not before a romantic angle is tossed in as David takes his high-school girlfriend out to Rome for a swing -- they fly regular Northwest of course, despite the hunt on for his arrest at NSA level.

The plot holes are large enough for obese teleporters to jump through. Christensen, an actor chosen clearly to appeal to the younger Star Wars fans, would have done well to consider a repertoire of at least two facial expressions. The final 15 minutes or so have so much rammed into them, with pulse-pounding heavy metal music of course, that one wonders if the film was about to overrun its deadline and had to be chip-chopped in a rush.

The loud hints at the end suggest that there might be a Jumper II. Optimistic as that may be, one hopes they will rope in someone else to write, direct, act in, and score it. The theme and Stephen Gould surely deserve better.",1217203200,,2833,5.105831533477322

David eventually starts living the good life, simply by taking what's not his and traveling the world by using his supernatural powers.  The villian played by Samuel L.

Then he did Mr. and Mrs. Smith, (4 stars), and now he's done this wannabe (3 stars). I don't even want to know how the sequel is going to turn out, although it has the potential to be a whole lot better. Anyways, this movie has a great concept of teleportation, used in sort of a anti-hero and selfish manner. Add a girl that was better off out of the picture, and you have a somewhat entertaining disappointment.

Hayden Christensen, while no Oscar winner, isn't as bad most would have you believe, but on the other hand, you almost never see his true colors because they're hidden under boring, one-dimensional and whiny characters. And that's what this character is, boring, one-dimensional, whiny and just plain dumb. In fact, Jamie Bell's Griffin is a whole lot more exiting, experienced, has his act together, has no girlfriend dragging him down, and he's just plain cooler. A movie centered around that character would have made for a much more interesting movie. Hopefully, he'll be around in sequals as an ally.

But the main problem with the movie comes in the form of Samuel L. Jackson, who gets his revenge from Hayden kicking his butt in Star Wars, and in turn shocks everybody, and stabs them with a knife that probably has a deleted scene to explain its strange mysteriousness. Or maybe it's just bad filmmaking. Anyways, Sam Jackson and his group of Jumper killers are so over the top, Evil Knievel couldn't jump over it. Sam Jackson especially. He's just so evil, he's beyond evil, not believable, and again, over the top.

Then there's the ""twist"" of Diane Lane, which is not only disappointing but confusing. She's a bad guy? Now, any path they take with her character is going to be so muddled a Hummer couldn't get through it. Then there's the girlfriend, who seems pretty cardboard, and who I never could quite get into. She isn't bad lookin', but her character development seems rather predictable, and again, boring.

But for all those wrongs about this movie, there is also plenty of good ones. The prologue is interesting and does a good job setting up the character, although Hayden's narration does get annoying after the first time. Then there's the action. Ahhh yes, the action. The action is entertaining, interesting, and pretty darn cool. My personal favorite was when they brought the London bus to the Egyptian desert.

So overall, you have a excellent concept and tons of potential. Unfortunately, this potential doesn't formulate into much thanks to poor writing, bad characters, over the top bad guys, questionable casting, and way too many lulls, both intended or otherwise. I look forward to a sequel, where hopefully they'll make it an action film.

I've read about teleporting from a very early age, beginning with ""The Stars My Destination"" by Alfred Bester, featuring the teleporting anti-hero, Gulliver ""Gully"" Foyle. (I highly recommend this novel.) Since then, I have always been fascinated by the idea.  This movie is a great idealization of the power to teleport, or ""jaunte"" as it is described in Mr. Bester's book. The special effects are terrific and the world-wide locales are a feast for the eyes.

Despite what a previous reviewer stated, this movie has an interesting plot and the motivations behind the Paladins were easy to understand. Ultimate power usually corrupts absolutely. And Jumpers have what the Paladins consider ""power only God should have"".

The movie's ending suggests a possible sequel.

3168403,2,B00177Y9ZC,"`Jumper' could be the perfect manipulative teen movie fantasy.  Start with a boy who  faces a distant, but menacing father in a divorced family where the mother's been absent since his fifth birthday, a bully at school who keeps him from his dream girl, and we have all the makings of an escapist venue about someone who gets and tries to keep it all.

In an early confrontation, David Rice (Hayden Christensen) meets school bully Mike as he connects with Mike's girlfriend, Millie Harris (Rachel Bilser).  He's sharing a glass bubble snow scene with her when Mike confiscates it and throws it on a frozen river.  Predictably, David falls through the ice while retrieving it, and remarkably, Millie's rescue attempts don't have her joining him through the same ice; even more mysterious is how Dave gets transported to the local Ann Arbor Library before he can suffocate under a sheet of unbroken ice.

Now he's discovered magical powers that enable him to jump ahead short and long distances in hyper-cyber leaps with invisible traces.  If he can only hone it and use it at will, he can globe trot the world and use it at whim.  We not only go forward physically, but we do so in time frames as well with casual announcements of passing time.  (The movie does this--not the powers.)  Relationships would surely suffer, but not for him.  We see him elude his overbearing father, but his trek seems like a lonely one with no one he can share his gift.

His first act is to do mission impossible and rob an impenetrable bank.  In one of the movie's time warps, we leap ahead to David sitting in his upscale New York apartment.  Never mind that this kid who wouldn't have the credit history or employment record to justify his application.  Having forgotten Millie for some years, he's able to pick up a girl at a London pub just after hanging out on one of the four faces of Big Ben.  After enough fooling around, he decides he's grown lonesome for Millie, so he heads (I should say jumps) back to Ann Arbor years later where he finds she's supporting her college expenses as a bar maid.  Here he also meets a drunken Mike where the conversation turns as tipsy as his beer glass.  Again enamored by the contrast of brutish Mike to his civility and maybe a little more than impressed by David's ability to throttle his nemesis through powerful transport, Millie is his.  Not wanting to be peculiar in her eyes, David satisfies her desire to travel the world, using traditional money instead of his magical powers.

There has to be a catch.  After the bank robbery, NSA operative, Roland (Samuel L. Jackson) is hot on his trail and knowledgeable about the Jumpers.  Using an electrical device, Roland is able to stave off jumping powers by shocking the Jumper's brain waves.  Not able to transport, he nevertheless, uses photographs to unlock the path of his suspects' movements.  Labeled an Inquisition figure, Roland roars, ""Only God should have the power to be all places at all times.""  So instead of an investigative interest in the bank robbery, we get a jealous preacher.  If there's no consolation in the chase, then we're at least better informed when David locks heads with British fellow jumper, Griffin (Jamie Bell).

In many ways the movie goes nowhere.  The scenes where he moves ahead are done with genuine expressions by the actors, but the special effects draw attention to itself.  It's much more satisfying to watch the believable blur in a 'Bourne' movie.  The transport gets tiresome at times.  Credibility also takes a back seat.  Maybe he can jump to Maui, but does it automatically make him a champion surfer?  There are no good guys here (except for one sweet and innocent girl).  That may work for 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,' but not here.  Robbing a bank doesn't make our protagonist likable or gain our sympathies.  Without intending to do so, the film highlights much of sixties' science fiction which looked upon such advancements with a wary eye and undermined them with consequences.  (Okay, so this is more fantasy than anything else, but it's the same idea.)  I did like the mystery of David's mother (Diane Lane), but even that treatment is limited.

Following up his blockbuster action hit Mr. and Mrs. Smith, director Doug Liman turns to an entirely new genre -- sci-fi -- for this tale of an underground world of teleporters. Based on the novel by Steven Gould, Jumper concerns David (Hayden Christensen), a young man who quite literally wills himself away from his grim family life by teleporting to another place with the power of his mind. Years later, David is using his powers to raid bank vaults, seduce girls in London, lunch on the pyramids, and surf in Fiji. But he soon discovers that he is not the only one bestowed with this unique gift, and all is not well in the world of jumpers. There are people out there, such as Roland (Samuel L. Jackson), who view jumpers as a threat to all humankind, and have made it their mission in life to eliminate them. After jumping back to Michigan to get reacquainted with his long lost love, Millie (Rachel Bilson), David makes the acquaintance of experienced jumper Griffin (Jamie Bell). Informed by Griffin of a secret between jumpers and a shadowy group that seeks to destroy them, the pair soon finds themselves facing off against a legion of murderous opponents who won't stop fighting until every last jumper has been eliminated.",1215648000,,1502,5.310924369747899

There isn't any thing to learn from it, nothing to laugh at etc. I was never able to establish any empathy with any of the characters.

Starts pretty well and just gets weaker by the minute. Christensen is simply boring (here and everywhere else I've seen him). He thinks looking seriously and quietly at someone is acting. I feel nothing when I watch this clown.

Jackson is becoming a reliable sign of a cheesy flick.

The main character realizes that ""jump"" during a dire situation. Realizing that he has a great power he uses it to his advantage and illegally accumulates wealth, woman, and toys. He's drawn into a controversy that he was unware existed when he finds out that he is not alone, and that all ""Jumpers"" are hunted by the ""Paladins"" (lead by Samuel L. Jackson) The conflict between these two is the entire second half of the film. There is alot of shaky camera work during most of the action scenes, probably to facilitate the special effects.

Keep in mind I can't remember any of the characters names and that pretty much somes up the problem with this movie. The character development is lackluster and nothing about Jumpers are ever explained. All of that i guess is saved for the sequel that will never be released unless its straight to dvd. Thats the problem with setting up for a sequel in an unknown franchise that it may not become a franchise. I don't think Jumper will unless it goes the straight to dvd or tv route. Overall Jumper is an ok time, if you leave your brain at the door. The main character does bad things and doesn't use his powers for good and by the end of the movie he still is doing basically what he wants and it leads you to believe he is changing though. That change will come with the never to be released sequel. Sigh.

3168430,4,B00177Y9ZC,"I gave this movie an extra star because it is set in Ann Arbor (where I live) and has some footage of Huron High School and the Gallup Park around the Huron River.  Yeah, I know it is cheap of me, but I like seeing my home town on the screen.

The movie is about David Rice and his ability to teleport (jump) to anywhere in the world (but not through time).  He first becomes of this ability when, as a teenager, he falls through some ice on the river and is carried downstream with no way out through the ice.  As he learns to master this ability he engages of a variety of activities that stem from his troubled personality.  Max Thieriot does a terrific job as the bullied teenager and Hayden Christensen carries the movie as you young adult version of David.

Unfortunately for David, he isn't the only jumper and there is an organization of crazed folks who deem themselves authorized to find and kill any jumper they find.  They have all kinds of high tech tools to locate, contain, and a low tech knife to gut them.  These folks call themselves Paladins.  They have, according to the story, existed as long as there have been jumpers, but I wonder how they contained them without their gadgets?

For me, the handling of the Paladins is a real weakness in the movie.  We don't know their true motivation, their financing, or why they are so devoted to what they do.  They are just there and are just the enemy of jumpers.  Not really enough.  However, Samuel L. Jackson does a fine job Roland, the head Paladin.

The other problem with the story is that David is not a sympathetic character.  Of course, Hayden Christensen has already played one of those and handles this quite well.  I just didn't feel there was anyone in the movie to cheer for.  We side with David because the story tells us to, but we don't really like him or identify with him.  David's love object, Millie (because he really doesn't know her as a person, just as an idea he projected from himself - as most teenagers do) is the nicest person in the film, but never gets to become a full person here.

The film has made more than $200 million dollars worldwide so we will probably get a sequel of some kind.  I hope they flesh out the people rather than leaving them as two-dimensional figures.  But maybe that is enough for their target audience.

The movie takes us to lots of cities all over the world and that is a part of the fun.  But most of the time I wondered why the jumps went so far afield.  I know that some of it was an emotional response to a situation, but sometimes the jump could have been down the block for a similar effect to the problem at hand.  Maybe I am being too fussy.

3168431,3,B00177Y9ZC,"During the Summer I lighten up on movies since I know some of them won't win Academy Awards. That's because they are focused towards action and fun which the Academy usually frowns upon. With the exception of ""Lord of the Rings"" how often have you seen them give it to fun movies? Afterall ""Star Wars"" or ""Anger Management"" certainly weren't about to get one. So don't expect ""Jumpers"" to be anything more than it is, a fun action movie. Now I grant you I have a couple questions. Did his father survive? Who funded the Paladins? Where they really working for NSA? Why did his mother have a kid if jumping is genetic? If Paladins can jump, aren't they a jumper too? Okay I had more than a couple questions not being answered, but overall I liked the ride.

Some will say robbing banks or Paladins killing innocent people is setting a bad precedent for kids to watch. I agree. Have you thrown out your families ""Grand Theft Auto IV"" yet? Yeah right, so let's not be so judgemental on this movie. The main character is none other than Hayden Christensen of Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader fame. He does a decent job playing the part of a Jumper. Samuel Jackson unfortunately doesn't really get much opportunity to show his ability acting as one of the bloodthirsty Paladins. Worse yet, we barely see the lovely and talented Diane Lane.

The movie starts us with a boy saving his own life, by jumping to a library he knew as a child, when he falls in a icy lake. As the story evolves we find out Jumpers typically start jumping at age five. For some unknown reason we find that Paladins since medieval times have killed jumpers. Sorry this is one premise I couldn't accept. Paladins have always been portrayed as good and guarding religious people from harm. Convincing me this means they would kill people for jumping into a bank and robbing  it is stretching it thin. They would have been better off to just make the government in pursuit of them, specifically Homeland Security or NSA. Even then it would need to be if captured a Jumper would face imprisonment not death if they were guilty of lesser than capital crimes. Now that I got that out of my system, I still like the movie for the most part. The story wasn't bad, the acting decent, and the effects great. Not a bad Summer movie at all.

3168432,3,B00177Y9ZC,"With all the talk I heard about this DVD, it seems that it might just be fans of Anikin Skywalker's just loving him being in another movie that I did not feel was as good as the hype being said about it.

Jumper is about a boy who one day discovers he can warp/teleport. He decides to use this power to take money from a few bank vaults and live a life of luxury. However his plan backfires when he finds out that he is not the only person who can do this trick. They are called Jumpers, and can warp to wherever they want to. He could be in New York city one minute and then warp straight to the Sphinx in Egypt.

While discovering he is not alone, he also finds out there are (some name for it) a group of people who want to kill them for having this ability to jump wherever they want to. The plot pretty much goes around him trying to stay alive while protecting his girlfriend and learning to be a jumper.

It sounds pretty cool when you hear the plot story, but I feel this movie could have been so much better then it is. I really did not like the idea that he just figures out he can do this, like it's genetics and he accidentally discovers he can warp. I know this is just a movie for entertainment, but even in a non fiction world, you want some sort of explanation to what causes this. I'd have bought into a magic ring, or an ancient crystal that gives them these powers, but to just have him figure it out like he was born with it just did not feel like it was the right way to give him these powers.

Also, they should have explored the fun you could have with such powers. It seems like he just decides to rob bank vaults, and uses it to warp to a few places... if you had that kind of power, the first thing that comes to mind is probably not rob a bank vault, you'd probably be testing it to see what you can do, and how much of it. There is plenty of things they could have tried to make it seem like someone who really did have this power and could do anything, there where so many possibilities they could have explored.

The battles between the jumpers and whatever they where did not seem to be thought out as well as it should. There is no explanation as to why jumpers are being killed, apart from jealousy from a religious type of hunter group.

So many possibilities where unexplored, and so many reasons and ""whys""
left unanswered.

Many people are saying this is an original concept. No it's not. This seems like they have taken ideas from ""Click"" and ""TimeCop"" and mixed it with a lot of concepts you see from b-grade horror movies and wrapped it up in a normal human being who is not from hell or has a thirst for blood.

It's just usually you see these warp things in demons, or evil, aliens or angels or gods or something, so it's not an original concept, just the idea to put it into someone normal, but far from original, as there have been movies made where a normal person can do this kind of thing.

Overall I think they could have done a much better job with this story wise. It came off feeling pretty average and so many questions left unanswered. And if that is a set up for a sequel, then this series has already failed for doing it on purpose before they know if the movie was a success or not... people aren't as stupid as the movie companies want them to be.

the extras seemed pretty boring. So I expect there holding back a few months before the release a special directors cut edition, which will fail the market as people either refuse to buy it, or copy it or download it... and the movie companies wonder why piracy is running rampart these days.

Overall, fans of Anikin will flock over this and praise it, no matter what he is in. but to the average viewer, this is a pretty average movie that could have been done so much better if it focused more on entertainment then the FX of the movie.

Unless it was some artistic endeavor that happened to step into the world of sci fi, it was scoffed at. That's okay though. While critics dismiss these films of fancy, fans follow them non stop. Such may be the case with this week's release, JUMPER.

Hayden Christensen stars as David Rice, a young man who comes from a dysfunctional home where mom took off when he was 5 and dad has clung more to the bottle than David. As he hits teen years, David discovers accidentally that he has a strange ability. David can transport himself from one location to another with the speed of thought.

Leaving home, David does what any normal male teen would do. He sets himself up in a cheap hotel and transports himself into a bank vault where he takes money that no one notices until months later. No security breach, no alarms, just missing money. The film progresses from there to David grown into a young man, still transporting from locale to locale, have lunch on the head of the Sphinx, appearing immediately in Paris or stepping out to shop in New York only to hit the stores in London. With the speed of thought, David appears.

All seems fine until someone appears in David's apartment. That someone is Roland (Samuel L. Jackson) who has shown up to take David down and has the ability (with the help of an electronically charged weapon). With a bit of luck and ingenuity, David escapes and returns to his boyhood home.

Once there, David decides to look up the love of his life, the girl who was there when this power first manifested and who hasn't seen him since believing he died, drowned when he was young. Millie (Rachel Bilson) has grown, works in a local bar and still captures David's heart. Taking a chance, he convinces Millie to leave with him to see Rome, a location she's always dreamed of seeing.

It is in Rome that David encounters Griffin (Jamie Bell), another ""jumper"" who enlightens David. It seems that Roland is the head of an organization called Paladins that have tracked down and killed ""jumpers"" from the beginning of time. Their goal is simple to exterminate.

Realizing he has put Millie in danger, David tries to escape Roland and his cohorts. But the chances of Millie and David making it out safely are slim to none, even with the reluctant aid of Griffin.

A final showdown, the appearance of David's mother and more highlight this action packed sci fi tale that offers hot locals, fantastic effects, great looking shots and a plausible story that features good guys and bad on the move. The film is not LAWRENCE OF ARABIA but then it never sets out to be that.

3168438,2,B00177Y9ZC,"I really hate it when a movie that I was really excited about seeing ends up completely disappointing me once I finally get the opportunity to watch it. Such was the case with the recent release of ""Jumper"" from director Doug Liman (""The Bourne Identity"" and ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith""), starring Hayden Christensen, Samuel L. Jackson, Rachel Bilson, and Jamie Bell. The previews were entertaining, showcasing the film's impressive visual effects, and showing what turned out to be the best scenes from star Hayden Christensen's performance, in order to paint him in a much more positive light in regards to his less than stellar acting ability. Not surprising to me and many others was the fact that the film was universally panned by the majority of critics across the nation, yet I still wanted to see the movie, because I figured it would still be entertaining due to the fact that critics generally despise science-fiction, and well I generally disagree with them on that genre. Sadly, after watching the film, I now find myself having to say that I completely agree with the throng of critics that blasted the film, and I feel like I wasted 90 minutes of my life that I will never get back on what is possibly the worst film of 2008.

""Jumper"" is the story of David Rice (Hayden Christensen), a man who was bullied throughout his childhood and ends up leaving the love of his life, a girl named Millie (Rachel Bilson) to start over, and is now living the good life with all the wealth he could possibly imagine. He's a man who appears to have everything a person could ask for, except he's never had to work for any of it; instead, he uses his amazing ability to teleport from place to place taking anything and everything he wants for himself. David believes he is the only one of his kind until he meets another `jumper' named Griffin (Jamie Bell) who warns him of a group known as the Paladins, that are led by a mysterious and deadly man named Roland (Samuel L. Jackson), their goal is to find and eliminate all `jumpers' from the face of the Earth. Now, David finds himself stuck in the middle of a war he doesn't understand, with the fate of not only himself but everyone he cares about hanging in the balance.

While I was watching ""Jumper"" a couple of things went through my mind over the course of the film. First, is the extreme confusion in regards to why executives in Hollywood continue to believe that Hayden Christensen (best known for his work in the `Star Wars' prequels) is even a remotely decent actor? Lets face it the man cannot act, he was mediocre at best in his first starring role in the smash hit ""Star Wars - Episode 2: Attack of the Clones"" and seemed a little bit more comfortable and skilled in ""Star Wars - Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith""; however, even in those films (which are by far his best work to date) he was nothing to be all that impressed by as far as his acting talent was concerned. In the recent release ""Awake"" co-starring Jessica Alba, I thought Hayden had possibly improved his acting game to the point that he was finally an average movie star, but with his work in ""Jumper"" he quickly put that thought to rest, and firmly cemented himself in my mind as quite possibly the worst actor in all of Hollywood. Well, now that I've got that tirade out of the way I can continue on with what other thoughts occurred to me while I was watching this sub-par movie.

The next thing I wonder is why is it that good, sometimes even great actors lower their standards in order to star in drivel such as this. Veteran actor Samuel L. Jackson (`Star Wars' prequels) has made so many great movies throughout his career, along with a few stinkers along the way as any actor does from time to time, but why would he even be remotely interested in wasting his considerable talents on this movie is beyond me. The same goes for Diane Lane (""Untraceable"") who has gained more and more credibility as an actress in Hollywood throughout the last decade or so, but then she does a film like this, and you wonder if maybe she's starting to lose her ability to discern between good and bad movie roles. My only guess, and the only way that I figure these stars can keep their respect and reputations intact, is that they only made ""Jumper"" for the paycheck, which I would hope was a ridiculously large amount, otherwise the choice just doesn't make sense to me.

The story in ""Jumper"" began with some possibility of being interesting to me, but then things began to unravel when Hayden Christensen began speaking his lines as blandly as possible. Aside from that, the story quickly appeared to be too shallow to really draw me into this supposedly ancient war between `jumpers' and the zealous Paladins. I wanted more depth to be given to what drives the Paladins to hunt the `jumpers', explanation as to why the `jumpers' always seem to commit crime instead of using their ability for good, and most importantly what the writers were thinking when they chose to make the hero of the movie, Hayden's character David, into such an idiot and a weakling. I mean he's always getting caught, and whenever he gets into a fight he always gets his rear handed to him, that is until he teleports to achieve the upper hand, but in a fair fight he always loses, how are we supposed to root for someone like that. Not to mention the fact that when the other `jumpers' are caught by the Paladins they seem to have a much harder time of escaping, yet David escapes with relative ease by comparison, and his partner in crime, Griffin (Jamie Bell) even points out how stupid David is for getting caught all the time when he makes the statement, ""How is it you have survived this long?"" (or something along those lines). All in all, the story written by Simon Kinberg (""Mr. and Mrs. Smith""), who rewrote the film after two previous scripts from writers David S. Goyer (""Batman Begins"") and Jim Uhl (""Fight Club"") were rejected by the film's director Doug Liman, was full of so many holes and instances in the story where it seemed the audience was just supposed to fill in the gaps to make the movie make sense, that I wonder if there was a lot of content that had been edited out of the final film, and if a director's cut of ""Jumper"" would possibly make for a better movie experience, although I don't think I could sit through any more of Hayden's horrible acting in this film than I already have.

From a visual effects standpoint, ""Jumper"" is virtually flawless thanks to the extremely talented group at Weta Digital (""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer""). The teleportation sequences are fun, and at first are exciting to see; however, the film uses the effect so much that it becomes tiresome and each `jump' sequence looks and feels just like the last to where you don't look forward to seeing them anymore. Now, I've seen special effects be repeated within movies before (""bullet time"" in the critically acclaimed ""The Matrix""), but generally when an effect is used more than once something is done to make it feel different than the previous, and that just did not seem to be the case in ""Jumper"". I don't know if the increasingly bland feeling I had towards the film's over-reliance on the same effect was because of a lack of imagination on Weta's part (which I doubt, given their stellar work in the past) or a lack of imagination and/or creativity on behalf of director Doug Liman (which is where I'm more inclined to assign the blame for not only this, but the entire failure of this movie).

Overall, ""Jumper"" had the potential to be an extremely entertaining, science-fiction action adventure film; however, weak acting, an overly simplistic storyline, and visual effects that went from brilliant to boring brought this film quickly to its knees and left me feeling like I lost a couple of brain cells in the process of having to turn my brain off in order to even sit through the 90 minute run time for the film.

There is only one character that has any kind of development (Griffin, who doesn't exist in the Gould book at all and appears for far too short a time) and he is the only reason to watch this film.  The two leads, Hayden Christensen and Rachel Bilson, give pitiful performances as one-dimensional characters caught in a matrix of whiz-bang special effects-- which aren't even all that good or even very interesting.  Might be entertaining if you grew up watching MTV music videos, because it is fairly short and it's completely pointless to expend gray matter activity trying to figure out what's happening.  It's edited a lot like a music video too, although the largely unnecessary dialoge kind of gets in the way of fully appreciating the pretty locations and the gee-whiz light-show effects.

3168442,4,B00177Y9ZC,"The concept behind ""Jumper"" is simple.

""Jumpers"" possess the ability to transport from place to place in an instant, distance notwithstanding. Enter David Rice, and his discovery of his ability to immediately appear where ever he chooses. Leaving home at age 15, he sets down roots in New York, and borrows a little money to tide him over for a few years. Where do you go when the world is only a second, a blink, a thought away? What do you do when nothing is beyond your reach?

Six years passes, and as a young twentyish, stylish leaper, he learns the ugly truth. He is not alone. And someone is trying to kill him!

As long as there have been jumpers, there have been the hunters, the paladins. Armed with weapons that harness electricity to distract a jumpers' active brain power, the paladins track, trap, and kill any jumper within their grasp. David, after escaping from his New York apartment, leaps to his fathers' house and then shows up at a local pub where his almost girl friend works. Millie, surprised to seem David, travels to Rome where they see the sights, and face their own death match in the Colliseum.

There are many rules to jumping. No friends are safe. Trust no one. No family is safe. No lovers are safe. Keep one step ahead.

He learns the validity of each of the rules as he and Millie run from New York to Paris to Egypt and back. The chase scene is outstanding as action jumps back and forth in a stacatto esque rythymn. Gotta love the top of the Sphynx shots and the bus materializing in the desert outside of Cairo too. The special effects team truly achieved excellence in this production.

Cast-wise, Hayden Christiansen, Samuel L Jackson, and Jamie Bell are excellent in their roles. Hayden gives an aloof performance as David Rice, complete with the angst he portrays so well. Mr Jackson IS the hunter, and throughout the film, his intensity is consistant, giving the film the edge Christiansen leaps from for his fly by the seat of his pants character.

Technically, this is a film based on a series of novels by Steven Gould. If we look to other sources, Kitty Pryde of the New Mutants (X Men) exhibited a similar ability. The transporters of Star Trek served to advance the stories in a similar time frame. Regardless of the source, and the brilliance of the original work, the film does seem incomplete and the end is disappointing. Live to jump another day...unless a sequel offers a definite end to the eternal battle between Jumper and Bumper, don't bother.

Enjoy the film for the light moments, and the spectacular special effects.

Then read the books.

Why do directors and writers take an author's beloved novel and idea, and screw it up so badly that any fans hate it?!  This movie was a terrible example.",1214179200,8,386,4.923076923076923

The film itself was decidedly 2.5 star-ish - nice looking special effects, a story that could have been a lot better than it actually was, and a phoned-in performance by Samuel Jackson that, unfortunately, seems to be the norm for him these days.

Nothing, however, can prepare you for the agony that Mr. Christensen's thespian abilities will cause you - I mean, people say that Keanu Reeves is bad, but Keanu is a regular Kenneth Branagh (or Emma Thompson, if you prefer) compared to the atrocity that is Hayden Christensen. He was awful in the Star Wars movies, and yet ... here he is even worse.

3168449,3,B00177Y9ZC,"Synopsis: The film grabbed my attention immediately as it opened with a young man standing atop the Sphinx with the pyramids in the background, for me it doesn't get any better than that. The first words you hear are ""Let me tell you about my day so far"" spoken by David Rice (Hayden Christensen), former average guy turned Jumper. And what's a jumper you ask, why it's a person who can instantaneously teleport themselves to anyplace in the world. They're here one second, gone the next.

David misuses his power as one might expect, like a kid in a candy shop he pops in and out of bank vaults with loads of money and begins to live the life of luxury beyond one's wildest dreams. That is until he encounters Griffin (Jamie Bell) another more experienced jumper who instructs David in the dangers of being ""different"" from others. He learns that jumpers are pursued by a group known as the Palladin, a sophisticated, zealous group that believes jumpers are an abomination and dedicated to hunting down and kills them as though it were some type of holy crusade.

The action gets fast and furious as David and Griffin teleport around the globe with the Palladin in hot pursuit. When David's girlfriend Millie (Rachel Bilson) becomes Palladin bait to draw the two out in the open Griffin's words ring truer than ever, ""Welcome to the war!""

Critique: The '08 film `Jumper' is a slick but not too original story that borrow heavily from the cult classic `Higlander' with a little `Matrix' thrown in to draw the attention of the sci-fi fans. While the special effects are quite good the storyline just doesn't seem to capture the imagination as the other two above mentioned films, the soundtrack is rather weak and uninspiring and Hayden Christensen is rather lackluster and unconvincing. What saved the film for me was the presence of fellow jumper Griffin as played by Jamie Bell.

3168451,3,B00177Y9ZC,"Nothing like sliding through interdimensional wormholes to make your day. ""Jumper"" tries to carry more signficance than your standard popcorn movie and almost succeeds; David Rice (Hayden Christensen in tortured mode)comes from a broken home. His mother disappeared when he was five and his difficult father (Michael Rooker) makes him wish he could disappear some place else. While walking on ice to retrieve a gift for Millie (Rachel Bilson) girl he likes, David falls through the ice. Trapped he desperately tries to break through and then, suddenly, finds himself in the library near his home. He discovers that by picturing where he wants to be he can jump almost from one instant to the next to that place. This gives him the license to escape and he takes it jumping all around the world, accumulating wealth by robbing banks (and leaving IOU's because, after all, he does PLAN on paying them back). He thinks he's alone in this ability until one day he meets another jumper (Jamie Bell)and discovers that they are being pursued by group called the Paladins led by Roland (Samuel L. Jackson) who is out to KILL all jumpers.
Suddenly Rice is on the run and Roland finds Rice's weakness in the form of Millie.

Well made by director Doug Liman (""The Bourne Conspiracy""), ""Jumper"" tries a bit too hard to add a dark edge to the film making it more than an entertaining popcorn flick. That's to Liman's credit but the film is best enjoyed as a science fiction action/adventure film. Based on the young adult novels by Steven Gould, ""Jumper"" has little to do with the novels beyond the basic premise. Liman reinvents it for his own purposes. The cast is quite good although I question the casting of Christiansen as Rice. Jamie Bell exudes the dark, troubled quality that Christiansen can only hint at.

The Blu-Ray disc looks extremely good with crisp images and rich colors that compliment the location shooting. The visuals are also pretty good as well (although some such as the fight on top of the Sphinx are obvious digital effects). Audio sounds terrific.

The Blu-Ray comes with some terrific extras that mirror the regular two disc edition (including the digital copy that evidently comes with that edition on the second disc something I have no use for but some folks might particularly if they watch movies on their mp3 player or ipod). Liman, his writer/producer Doug Kinburg and producer Lucas Foster provide an entertaining and informative commentary track. There's also a animated graphic story providing background on the character of Rice. We also get a number of featurettes that cover everything from adapting the novel (and the multiple changes that occurred) to the look of the film and visual effects.

""Jumper"" is a escapist popcorn movie and is enjoyable for that. ALthough Liman tries add depth to the story by giving Rice and other characters dark, tortured backgrounds he isn't able to make this more than that popcorn flick (whereas ""Iron Man"" managed to be both an enjoyable popcorn flick AND a serious flick about troubled Tony Stark). Enjoy it for what you see but don't expect Gould's novel and you'll find this film a diverting & entertaining way to spent 83 minutes.",1213747200,2,3201,4.889502762430939

Sure there were some elements that made the plot a little too neat and tidy (e.g. nearly omnipotent Paladins, Mom just happens to be a Paladin, no one ever ends up jumping into the middle of a mountain, etc). But if you're willing to take these contrivances and lock them in a box for the duration (and its a science fiction movie so I think you should be) then you will enjoy this film.

There was action, a little romance, an acceptible plot, and subtle and well executed effects. Jumper won't cure baldness or make you a better person. It will however provide a very nice distraction.

If your looking for great acting or to analyze and pick apart the movie, than it's not for you. This movie is action packed through and through. The acting was decent, nothing to complain about.

3168456,3,B00177Y9ZC,"I really wasn't expecting too much from this film, but I do admit that the premise intrigued me. I had not read the original novel that the film was based on, so I cannot rate how well the film adapted the book.

First off, let's talk about the real star of this movie; the special effects. They are quite good, although nothing we haven't seen before (remember the first time you saw the original Star Wars and Jurassic Park? - Wow!). Of course the film relies heavily on CGI and I'm sure green screen was extensively used, although I couldn't tell what was real and what was green screen (I can usually tell).

Second, I really liked the idea behind the whole story of the Jumpers and the Paladins. With such an interesting idea, one would have expected the story to go a little further than it did and delve deeper into the origins of both sides of the ""war"", but I got the feeling that this was just an ""introductory film"" that would lead to numerous sequels (it's Hollywood - what did you expect?). The film does indeed, leave the story WIDE open for sequels galore.

Finally, the acting was substandard in my opinion. I did like the Star Wars prequel films, but I never did like Hayden Christensen's performances. They were wooden, dull, and just plain uninteresting. The same goes for ""Jumper"". He is a good-looking and resonably fit individual and I'm sure that appeals to the young ladies and gives them incentive to go to the theaters, but his acting skills are just plain awful. He just doesn't have the acting skills to carry a lead role.

Racheal Bilson's (sorry if I spelled her name incorrectly) performance is just as bad as Christiansen's. Both actors deliver shallow performances and portray shallow characters. Sam Jackson was as good as he could be with the role he was given, but overall, I just wasn't able to establish an emotional connection with them and therefore really didn't care how things turned out for them.

To sum up, the story and special effects are pretty decent and will keep you entertained for a couple fo hours, but don't expect any riveting performances or thought-provoking commentary about the human condition. This movie is just a popcorn flick, but sometimes those kinds of movies can be fun.

This one is.",1213660800,2,2253,4.662468513853904
3168457,2,B00177Y9ZC,"Yet another movie that ended with everyone in the room being bored.  There were four of us watching this last weekend, and only 3 remained conscious until the end... of those 3 all of us kind of shrugged and one said ""well that was certainly another ho-hum movie.""

None of us had read the book or graphic novel that this was based off of.  Perhaps if we had then we would have enjoyed it more.  When the movie started up with the voice over I knew we were in trouble.  Very few ""good"" movies have VO's (Christmas Story is a good one, Trainspotting another.)  VO's generally tell you that ""we can't write a good script so we're going to have some guy tell you what you're supposed to know.""  I tried to ignore the VO and give the movie a chance... then we were treated to excellent actors forgetting to act.  They were all very stiff, wooden, and clichd.  Samuel L Jackson looked absolutely ridiculous with his white hair and tazer-club.  When the plot was supposed to shift into high gear... nothing was explained.  Okay so the bad guys were called ""Paladins"" and had been killing ""Jumpers"" since forever because they were too powerful.  Um... okay.  Too bad the ""Jumpers"" in this movie never really acted like good guys.  I didn't particularly care who lived or died... in fact I would have been much happier had they all died.

So let's forget about the lack of a good script, plot holes, and bad acting.  What about the SFX?  Some of them were quite good, and some of them were Sci-Fi channel special quality.  Some of it was ingenious and some of it was garbage, but there was little consistency to what we saw and when.  Sometimes when he jumped, the buildings shook and the walls cracked... other times he was able to hop all over the place without making a sound.

All I know is that by the time the final battle came around we were all ready for this to be over.  Jumper has been one in a long string of Yawn-worthy movies we have rented as of late.  I really wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  Sorry but it was just lacking in so many areas, and it wasn't even bad enough to be funny.",1213574400,6,2093,4.365284974093265
3168458,2,B00177Y9ZC,"As a film, Jumper just begs to be mindless fun, of which it had loads of potential to be.  However, Doug Liman's adaptation of Steven Gould's novel ends up being anything but, and is nowhere near as fun or enjoyable as it could have been.  Hayden Christensen broods his way all over the screen as David Rice, a man with the ability to teleport anywhere in the world just by thinking it.  He's pretty much enjoying life, until meeting fellow ""jumper"" Griffin (Jamie Bell) and learning that there has been a centuries long war between the jumpers and the Paladins, of which is Roland (a blonde haired Samuel L. Jackson) who will stop at nothing to put an end to David.  Christensen is just so stiff and unconvincing in the lead role that watching him becomes a plain bore.  In fact, the cast as a whole just comes off that way, including Jackson, and wasted roles for Diane Lane, Kristen Stewart, Tom Hulce, Michael Rooker, and Rachel Bilson as David's love interest.  Jamie Bell on the other hand is so good that the Amazon review stating that one will wish both he and Christensen had switched roles could not be further from the truth.  Liman's direction is frentic to be sure, but the special effects sequences are surprisingly disappointing to behold.  Considering Jumper's troubled production history, none of this really comes off as much of a surprise, but the potential was here to have an incredibly fun time that just gets basically wasted.  It isn't anything terrible, but Jumper definitely isn't anything to write home about either.",1213574400,,1543,4.749063670411985

  8 years later he finds her again and she agrees to go to Rome with him just like that. As if he's not lucky enough that a hot girl like Rachel Bilson is still single.

  While an agent played by Samuel L. Jackson wants to kill him just because ""only god should have this power"" he explains. A better explanation would have been ""because I'm one bad Motha....and the movie needed a villain"".

  Another Jumper ""well played by Billy Elliot's Jamie Bell"" follows Hayden's Jumper around because he's using him as bait. He hunts the Jumper killers and knows they are after Christensen. That's what I guess anyway since the movie never explains why he's following him.

  Jumper has a lot of energy and some nice locations and some cool moments. The script is thin though. It's a wannabe super hero movie and that's about it. I'd rather just see a teleporter movie with Alan Cummings as Night Crawler again.

  Jumper never explains how Jumpers become Jumpers. While Jackson's excuse for killing them just wasn't a good enough excuse. He says most Jumpers become bad and that only god should have this power ""one of his worse lines he has ever had to utter"". Yet not one Jumper we meet in the movie even seems evil.  They wanna teleport to other countries, rob banks with no one getting hurt and...surf.

  Plus for a Doug Liman (Go, Bourne Identity, Mr. and Mr.s Smith) movie it's totally disappointing. It makes even Mr. and Mr.s Smith look fantastic. I didn't even know he directed the movie until after I saw it. You'd think that someone less talented made it. I actually thought that he only produced it.",1213401600,2,1828,4.569230769230769

There was no real plot, no beginning and no ending it seemed.  This person just happened to be able to teleport.  In a matter of hours, he could control it.  Then out of no where, a group was trying to catch the teleporters and kill them, because the teleporters did the world harm.  But what did these teleporters do?  All this guy did was to steal some money.  Kind of petty to be killed by. Also, if you had this kind of power, wouldn't you try to do the world some good or really cause some major evil?

Anyways... no explanation whatsoever about how such teleporting phenomenon could happen... it just does.  If you make a scifi, at least support it with some wild facts.  If you choose not to explain anything, then make a worthwhile plot to engage the viewer.  This movie has nothing... maybe qualify as a teenage joke movie.

So, I don't really know if that's what was going on or...

Let me just get right down to it, but it just seems like a movie like this, would've had a LOT more fun going on with it.  I mean, when you see the Hayden Christensen character 'David' living in his terrific bachelor pad, it would've been sooo nice to see him actually getting it and seeing him buy all the stuff that's in it.  I mean, for a story like this, it's just as much as the journey as it is anything else.  It's like when someone wins the lottery, it's a cool thing to get to see them enjoy their winnings.

That, to me is what's missing with the movie Jumper.  I mean, here this character has the most incredible gift, and you never really see him use it for fun stuff.  I mean, like there's this part when he and the girl he's trying to impress are in Rome and then they are found to be trespassing and then the police arrive.  I mean, where in the screenplay could the David character NOT jump to save himself (and the girl)?  I mean, to see that kind of escape would've been sooo cool!  But then he allows himself to get arrested/detained which only serves as a plot device so that his mother (Diane Lane) can come to his rescue.

And the whole thing with the Paladins?  That seems kinda out there.  Because the people who are 'Jumpers' aren't really bad people.  If anything the Paladins seem like the bad guys because they want to kill these people who have this really cool ability--like maybe they're all suffering from 'Jumper Envy'.

Either way, I think the premise for Jumper was cool.  It's just the execution of the story, sorta left me cold.

I used to rip on Paul Walker for his comedically bad acting, but Hayden puts him to shame.  I thought ""Timeline"" might've been the worst movie I'd ever seen, but after ""Jumper"" came along, I'm starting to look at Paul Walker as the savior of Hollywood.  Christensen is so horrendous, he singlehandedly ruined Star Wars. Even the ones he's not in.  He sucks that bad.  His acting style is comparable to an autistic block of wood with constipation.  The man simply cannot act, and yet he continues to get role after role.  Add to this the fact that the script of Jumper felt like it was written by a group of one-armed mongoloid chimps, and you have yourself a movie so ridiculously awful that many people walked out of the theater halfway through.  I stayed because I apparently have a morbid fascination with terrible movies (see aforementioned ""Timeline""), but I was so mad afterwards I wanted to smash Christensen in the face with a wok.  Please please do not buy this movie.  It will only encourage him to make more.  We need to stop this before it gets out of hand.

I really hope that King saw a different cut of the film than the one released in theaters, because ""Jumper"" is a mess. It feels like the set-up for a movie or television series, rather than an actual movie in its own right. It introduces ideas, characters, and its own mythology, and just when things are beginning to take off...it ends.

3168469,4,B00177Y9ZC,"I went into watching this movie with lowered expectations.  After all, this film didn't do all that well in theatres, and from information I had read/heard, the film itself was started and stopped and then restarted again with virtually everything about the film changing in the process.  Basically I expected it to be a bit of a train wreck that likely couldn't live up to the relatively neat promise of the main premise: the star character was someone that found he had the ability to teleport anywhere instantly.

Pleasantly enough the movie doesn't do a bad job in delivering a fun ride.  Sure enough, the star does have the ability to teleport anywhere but his ability comes with potential consequences as there are people who believe that no one should have the power and ability that he, or others like him, has and those people will stop at nothing to permanently stop 'jumpers'.

Hayden Christensen plays the lead role here with Samuel L. Jackson (with bright white hair) playing the leader of the opposing side.  Christensen does well enough in his role, and Samuel L. Jackson delivers a solid enough performance as well.  Add in reasonable performances from the supporting cast, mix with some action and adventure in the form of good vs. evil fight scenes set in exotic locations and you get a movie that does a reasonable job delivering on the responsibility of being entertaining.  No it's not academy award type stuff, but it's good enough.  Were half star ratings possible, it'd be 3.5 for me.  Without the half star rating system, I'm rounding up to 4 stars.

Picture on the Blu-ray disc looks quite nice.  The movie is relatively short, with a somewhat family friendly PG-13 rating which seems mostly related to the action and violence in the fight scenes (and perhaps a little related to a scene that finds the female lead stripping her shirt off...) Little or no objectionable language.

Turn your brain off a bit going in and you should find Jumper reasonably entertaining.  Certainly worth a viewing via rental, though thanks to a load of extras, the Blu-ray package isn't a bad purchase.",1213142400,5,2109,4.822222222222222

The only thing Doug Liman (the director), used from the book was the two lead characters names & the ability to teleport. 95 % of everything else is brand new and not for the better, they might as well have ran a disclaimer at the beginning of the movie stating ""this movie is geared for 12 year olds"".

THE PLOT: David is a very wealthy and well-living man with a secret: he can pretty much jump to everywhere he wants to go. But one thing he doesn't know: An agency is looking for him, since he had robbed a bank at age 15. For 8 years they have been looking for him, and have been trying to take him down. He reunites with his sexy girlfriend Millie, who doesn't know that she's about to become entangled in the mystery as well.

WHO WILL LIKE IT? People who love these types of movies will like it for sure. Hayden Christiansen (sp?) gives a solid performance, as does Rachel Bilson. It's a movie that has lots of action, comedy, tragedy, everything you'd expect in a good movie.

WHO SHOULD SKIP IT? PROBLEMS? Predictability. You can probably guess how this one is gonna end from pretty early on.

OVERALL: A very enjoyable film, very fun, very tightly made and I think I may see this again sometime soon. Reccomended!",1213056000,2,1136,4.473429951690822
3168473,2,B00177Y9ZC,"There is little that can up your enjoyment of a terrible film like seeing it on an airplane. Having sat unbored through the execrable Mad Money on the way out to Seattle, I was actually looking forward to seeing this on the way home, knowing it was coming by having of course perused my Hemispheres free in-fight magazine on the trip out. I also had a quite mild desire to see it when it was in theaters.

Okay, so we begin with baby Darth Vader Hayden Christenson atop the pyramids, saying ""Once I was a normal person, a chump, just like you."" That's what I like, a movie that insults its audience right off the bat. Turns out Hayden [his character is David] was only a chump until he was 15, when he presented high school sweetheart Millie with a snow globe. The local bully takes it and throws it out onto the frozen river, and when Hayden goes out to retrieve it, he falls in. It's looking all Omen II for him, when suddenly he finds himself in the local library, which is when I discovered that all of this is taking place in Ann Arbor, where I lived from the ages of 18-30. Hayden's mother abandoned the family at five, and his father is a jerk, so he runs away, by bus [when you can teleport in style?] to NYC, where he soon uses his abilities to rob a bank. When next we see him, he's in his 20s and living in a swank apartment in New York, where he uses his abilities to even do such small things as reach a DVD cover that is a foot out of reach. Amazingly, for as physically lazy as he apparently is, he's quite fit.

In here we are also introduced to Samuel Jackson as Roland, who is a Paladin, a group of people who hunt and kill Jumpers [as the teleportees are known] because they are ""religious zealots"" who believe that ""Only God should have that power."" Sound like a flimsy excuse for a villain? Just asking.

For no specific reason, Hayden suddenly gets a jones to see his old high school sweetheart. I say move on with your life, Hayden, there are plenty of other fish in the sea, but he's been established as somewhat of softie, who stupidly leaves handwritten IOU's at the banks he steals from. Now, is he ever REALLY going to pay that money back? Anyway, he goes back to Ann Arbor and finds Millie working as a waitress. She has grown up to quite a hottie in the Avril Lavigne mold, all tight tanks and eye liner. Also there is the town bully, and they get in a fight before Hayden teleports him somewhere and satisfyingly freaks him way the hell out. Then he's back and offers Millie a spontaneous trip to Rome, where she's always wanted to go, and she says sure.

So they go to Rome--by airplane! Poor Hayden. That must have been a pain. Millie knows Hayden is lying about where all his money comes from, but is okay with a don't ask, don't tell policy. So after a few days they end up at the Coliseum, which has been Millie's ""Number One"" sight to see for ever [since that first magical viewing of Gladiator, perhaps?]. However, despite it being her top priority, they have wasted a few days in Rome before getting around to it, and arrive precisely at closing time. Hayden uses his powers to get her in after hours, whereupon he happens upon another Jumper, who warns him about a coming Paladin attack, which arrives post haste. Hayden is all stupid and getting zapped [the Paladins use these super tazers which supposedly inhibits a Jumper's ability to jump], while the other Jumper is doing the only sensible thing, and appearing behind one of the Paladins long enough to bash them with a baseball bat. Anyway, Hayden gets arrested, and various authorities, of both real and shadowy supernatural government agencies, are on his tail.
Around this time my traveling companion, who had been watching the movie as well, leaned over to me and said ""Does this movie make any sense at all?"" To which I had to reply that no, it did not. It's just this arbitrary conceit with these arbitrary rules [never fully articulated], for the sole purpose of staging fights and chases that range across numerous locations. These fights and chases are, however, pretty darn cool, once you get past the whole this-is-the-stupidest-thing-ever-set-to-celluloid barrier, and if you have elected to enhance your viewing through one of the many forms of available mind-altering substances, now is when you really want to let that stuff fly, because here's where the movie becomes a bit of a pip in spite of itself.

SPOILERS > > >
So turns out that Jackson and his Paladin cru are going to kill everyone Hayden cares about in order to get to him, which they demonstrate without harm to Hayden by killing his dad. Hayden has eight hours to kill Roland before Millie's plane back from Rome--alone--lands, which I thought was an okay excuse to give us a tight time frame, although the filmmakers blow it off almost immediately. Hayden suggests that he and Griffin, the other Jumper, team up, and after a while they do. Hayden goes to Millie's apartment, where Roland is in the process of sneaking into, and jumps with her to the jumper hideout. BUT! Roland has a special machine that ""detects recently-opened wormholes,"" and allows him to jump there, too! This leads to the first of a few of the cool fights that range throughout a bunch of locations around the world. Griffin also has the ability to jump with objects, so at one point Roland finds himself atop Mount Everest with a London double-decker bus suddenly bearing down on him from the sky. It's all amusingly cool, but you WILL have time to ask yourself why none of these idiotic jumpers don't simply buy a GUN, appear behind the Paladin, and clock them. I suppose somewhere on the DVD there's a bit about how despite the fights, public-threatening crashes, stabbing and electro-torture, they wanted to send a strong anti gun violence message.

For a rather cool finish, Hayden, who appears to be enmeshed in Roland's super-snare, relocates Millie's entire apartment into a river, and then into the Ann Arbor public library. He leaves Roland in a cave on a sheer cliff face.

There's a short coda, useful only in setting up a sequel [which I thought was ludicrous, until I read today that two sequels have been approved] in which we find out that Hayden's mother is a Paladin, and is going to come hunting for him at some point. Millie has fully adjusted to the jumper lifestyle and is just chillin' with her man. The end.
< < < SPOILERS END

It's delightfully senseless, and doesn't even stick to the rules it establishes [when it makes the effort to establish rules, which isn't often], but all of this is trumped by the fact that those multi-location fights and chases are pretty cool.

She is weak and not a very strong personality in this movie. I cannot believe that this is the same director for Mr & Mrs Smith and the Bourne Identity.

  The movie is pretty fast and enjoyable, clocking in at only 88 minutes.  Compared to Spiderman at 121 minutes, and Superman Returns at a whopping 154 minutes......this movie moves.  Ultimately feeling more like a really awesome pilot for a show, than a completed work.

The first teleportation story ever written was a short story called ""Dangerous Dimension"" by L. Ron Hubbard authored in the 40's.  Both ""Dangerous"" and ""Stars"" earn the hallowed mantle of ""CLASSIC"", and I will be terribly disappointed if the both of them don't make it to the Silver Screen sometime in the near future.

I went to see this one with my girlfriend, and we both enjoyed it. I'm not even a sci-fi nut; I think Blade Runner is boring and pointless. So, I'm not predisposed to like every sci-fi flick that comes out.

The movie revolves around a misfit kid with an abusive father and absent mother who learns he can teleport. It seems that his life will become a dream as a result of his abilities, but he soon finds himself hunted by merciless killers who are set out to destroy all jumpers. The conflict with a buddy makes for interesting plot twists, and the love interest is played by a uniquely intriguing actress.

3168481,1,B00177Y9ZC,"This movie is proof positive that Hayden Christensen's really bad acting as Anakin Skywalker was not some fluke of poor editing or directorial control by George Lucas.  No, this is all Hayden Christensen.  Why people in Hollywood continue to give him major roles when there are so many other male actors out there who are just as good if not better is just beyond me.

Could it be those dark overhanging eyebrows?  Seen from a certain angle, it makes him look like a brooding Calvin Klein male model, which is probably what he should be doing for a living instead of pretending to act.  Seen from other angles, however, it makes him look positively early-Neanderthal.

As for the rest of the movie, Bleccchhh.  Rachel Bilson couldn't act either and there was absolutely no chemistry between them.

The strangest part of the movie is that the younger high school versions of these two characters - Max Theriot and AnnaSophia Robb, were far more attractive, sympathetic actors, who actually looked like they could act.  Rachel Bilson doesn't look or act anything like AnnaSophia Robb and it was quite jarring to see her all of a sudden introduced as the older version of the same character.  It would have been far more interesting to have let the two younger actors continue as older versions of themselves for the rest of the movie.

There are SO MANY plot holes in this movie.  Here's just one:  Early in the movie, David Rice picks up this incredibly beautiful blonde in a bar in England.  And then he leaves her, still in bed, for his old girlfriend from high school, who by this time is no longer the beautiful AnnaSophia Robb but has turned into the much plainer and whinier Rachel Bilson.

It's insane action sequences are followed by some slower 'talky' moments, that move the film along through to it's short end, with what looks like a sequel set-up.

Then, one day, he soon discovers that he can teleport.  Upon discovery, he abandons his lonely life and makes a comfortable life for himself.  However, there's a secret organization of hitmen that seeks to eliminate jumpers (teleporters) because they believe that only God should have this ability.

The ""cat and mouse"" game is interesting.  The escape from the Paladin hitmen forces David to seek help from another jumper and Millie, his high school crush, whom he hasn't seen in years.

I feel as though he is given a bad rap when, well, in star wars he was kind of supposed to be a whiny teenager and in jumper he was supposed to be a dumb kid.

I felt the movie was quite entertaining. Period. Alot of people felt they wasted their time with the movie talking about how some things didn't make sense and how these people didn't explain themselves enough blah blah blah. Bottom line, it's a movie meant to entertain. I'm baffled by these people on here trash talking the movie when clearly we all know that Samuel L. Jackson doesn't do a whole lot of top shelf movies.

3168488,4,B00177Y9ZC,"I went to see Jumper  with some of my family when it was released, and I have to say I enjoyed it very much. I've liked Hayden Christensen since I saw ""Life as a House,"" and Samuel L. just rips up a villain role like nobody's business. The special effects were very well done and I was delighted to find that the main storyline they implied in the commercials is NOT what happened! Sure, the main character can teleport, but the rest.... The movie is billed as scifi/thriller type, but that's a bit misleading. This is more like the Highlander films, a fantasy element in the real world.

The movie was pretty fast paced with only a couple slower moments, and the character's self-exploration once he discovers the ability was almost as good as Peter Parker's in the first Spider-Man movie. Actually, in one way it was better. Peter uses his power to win a wrestling match and then jumps right into the hero role. Our similarly-aged jumper, however, jumps right into a bank vault, and a store, and...! *grin* He really is an ordinary person with an extraordinary ability.  He used his ability for theft, but also for taking his surfboard to Fiji for the best waves.  I liked the movie enough that I quickly ordered the book.  They are COMPLETELY different, but both good for different reasons.  The movie added a opposing force for jumpers (i.e. a ""villain"") whereas in the book, David mostly battles his own inner demons (with a lot of introspection).  Plus, the very cool character of Griffin was completely made-up for the film.  His character adds great action while giving viewers another jumper to identify with besides David.  Though the movie had closure, they left it wide open for a sequel that I really hope gets made.

I think some viewers were overly critical of this film.  It's not going to win any oscars, but I was entertained and that's the most important criteria.

As to the DVD itself, I have to say, do NOT buy the 2-disc edition.  The second disk contains only a digital copy.  All the extras are on disc one, which the regular edition has!  I really wish the product description had been more clear on this.  I wouldn't have paid the additional $6 for a digital copy which you have to use a keycode to transfer.  The code is located on a card in the case, but it clearly states to be careful not to lose it.  Also, the outer sleeve has a holographic image of the cover art that is glued to the front of the sleeve.  I don't see it lasting long.  Finally, once again the studio includes ads in the case, but no insert with chapter index and extra features.

The extra features were pretty standard.  There's commentary, making of, interviews with the authors/producer etc, book to film featurette, and some deleted scenes (all of which I felt were rightly cut from the film).  The interviews were interesting sinc ethey touched on how the producer obviously changed the book, and how the author felt.  Nothing spectacular here, but for a single disc edition these were perfectly fine - and far more than they offered with ""the Bourne Ultimatium"".",1208995200,150,3069,4.619926199261992
3168489,4,B00177Y9ZC,"Jumper was exactly what the preview promised: Flashy action sequences, exotic destinations, and a man with an ability that gets him noticed by the wrong guys. The acting was surprisingly good by both Christianson and Jackson...neither of which are favorites of mine. Nonetheless, this movie still delivered thrills. The directing by Doug Liman, as well as the pulse-pounding score by John Powell (both worked together on Bourne Identity and Mr. and Mrs. Smith) help deliver the thrills non-stop. My only major complaint was that as soon as you begin to get to know the characters and get interested in the story, it's over. The movie climax felt like it should have been the half-way point from which more rising action and a grand finale could be built upon. Despite this, however, great music, great action, great effects, and not-so-bad acting make for a pretty decent flick. I'll be watching this again.",1208131200,3,907,5.013245033112582
3168490,5,B00177Y9ZC,"I found this movie so entertaining, I was not disappointed.  The concept is good, even though it was treated very juvenile.  One thing I liked is that violence was very low, allowing the movie to be seen by a general public.  I've seen some comments about the acting, but I found very interesting the way Hayden Christensen performed his roll.  There was some kind of a mysterious look on his face with little expression, revealing that there is some kind of uncomforting secret he is hiding and a power like that; you just can't tell anyone.  He looks like he wishes to be honest with everyone but then he knows it is dangerous, so he needs to hide it from the people he cares about; it's not easy.  His roll was managed in a very mysterious way, which in my opinion gave a very special touch to the movie.  There's a lot of action, fights, car race, jumping, etc... even romance, what else do you want from a science fiction movie? 6 stars in total.",1206921600,5,951,4.4
3168491,3,B00177Y9ZC,"After the new ""Star Wars"" trilogy, Hayden Christensen and Samuel L. Jackson are again in sci-fi action, Christensen this time as `jumper' who has the power to teleport and Jackson as `paladin' who hunts the jumpers, believing that only God should have that power. The plot is thin (and there are lots of plot holes) or the back story is almost non-existent, but these things are not the only flaws in ""Jumper"" which could have been a more entertaining film.

For whatever happens to our hero Christensen plays, we just don't care. We simply need more interesting character that can carry the whole film to the end. Actually the film's premise is not bad. Some viewers would find him a selfish guy, stealing money from the bank and living lazily, ignoring the news report on the people in trouble, and here the film makes an interesting point - not everyone would behave like Spider-man given a chance to use superpower. His reference to comic books when he asks another jumper (played by Jamie Bell) to help suggests that the filmmakers are aware of that aspect.

But except the jumper Jamie Bell plays (and he is much more interesting than Christensen), none of the characters have been developed enough to draw our attention to the film's world. Rachel Bilson is there to constantly ask the hero what is going on, but nothing more is required. Michael Rooker and Diane Lane, both real professionals, look bored. Visual effects are OK and various locations (especially Rome) are joy to see, but they alone would not make up for the bland hero who refuses to interest us.

And the hero refuses to learn anything from the past experiences. He doesn't know how to defend himself when paladins show up and he puts his girlfriend in danger more than once. Probably that's why Jamie Bell's jumper, who is smart and knows how to survive, is more interesting. Unfortunately he appears on the screen too late and his character is only a supporting role.",1205798400,3,1945,4.7485207100591715
3168492,2,B00177Y9ZC,"David Rice (Hayden Christensen) is what is known in paranormal circles as a ""jumper,"" one of only a handful of specially-gifted individuals who have the ability to transport themselves from one corner of the globe to another at will (if nothing else, such a talent sure cuts down on a person`s transportation costs, no small thing in this age of $4.00/gallon gas).  Obviously working below his pay-grade here, Samuel L. Jackson plays Roland, the leader of a group of religious fanatics who, believing only God should have the power to be in more than one place at a time, roam the earth seeking out and destroying all the jumpers they can get their hands on.

Essentially a travelogue masquerading as a thriller, ""Jumper"" takes a reasonably promising premise and turns it into inane wish-fulfillment drivel.  There are more holes in the plot than there are wormholes for the jumpers to pass through, and the final action sequences border on the incoherent.  The movie mistakes hectic activity for excitement and leaves most of its earnest performers stranded high and dry with little to do but play second fiddle to all the hyper-kinetic visuals and special effects going on around them (the gifted Diane Lane, in particular, is woefully wasted as the mother who abandoned David when he was five).  Ah well, at least they got a few all-expenses-paid trips to some of the world's most prestigious locales as compensation.

Indeed, the one redeeming grace is that the movie takes us to a number of highly photogenic tourist spots around the globe, from the Empire State Building to the pyramids at Giza to, most memorably, the Coliseum in Rome.

3168493,4,B00177Y9ZC,"It cracks us up how much money this film made, but yet most reviews are neagative.

What movie did these bozos go see?

What we saw was a rollercoaster ride of a movie that felt fresh and exciting. C'mon, man! Sam Jackson, baby! He was cool as the paladin leader with Anakin Skywalker as the jumper. (We actually liked the european bad boy jumper somewhat better! Good actor.)

JUMPER had loads of mystery and action/adventure excitement - as well as a huge surprising ending - that will leave you wanting more. Liman yet again proves he is a top-notch director. We loved his original Bourne movie. The first beat the other two by leaps and bounds! (The last one was a total bore fest!)

And then, with Mr. and Mrs. Smith he took the comedy/action genre and sent it through the stratosphere! Although Jumper isn't as great as that last film, it is still WAY better than most junk coming out these days, all geared towards teens.

Sure Jumper leaves open questions at th end. There are several books out in this series, and Hollywood loves a sequel. And we want one!

And we'll bet every reviewer who gave this movie bad marks would go see it too! One way or another.

Sure the movie had its problems, but director Doug Liman handles the movie in a quick pacing with loads of beautiful special effects, great action sequences that were very original and huge in scope. Very refreshing. Also, if you want to see some of the most impressive sights in the world, Jumper takes you there!

Excellent movie, despite its few quirks. We'll buy the DVD, and hope to see an even bigger and better sequel in the future.

With all the money this film made, that should not be a problem.",1204934400,6,1673,4.4950495049504955

""Jumper"" is a good movie that will appeal to science fiction lovers, comic book junkies and anybody who's ever wanted to travel the world without blowing their bank account.  The story is simple, the special effects and international sets are amazing, and the acting is ... well you can't have anything.  The young actors here are given very few lines to work with and might not meet the high standards of those who want every movie, including an action fantasy movie, to have award worthy acting.

Many people will have to wonder what I wondered when I first read the reviews here: did I see the same movie as everybody else?  Why has this movie been panned by so many people?

Fans of the original novel tend to be against this movie because it deviates from the original story and offers a much more film-friendly short version.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jumper-A-Novel-Jumper/dp/0765357690/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jumper: A Novel (Jumper)</a>&nbsp;There was a ""prequel"" story written to transition fans to this story, and you can check out those reviews to see their reactions.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jumper-Jumpscars-The-Official-Prequel-to-the-Film-Jumper/dp/1932664939/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jumper: Jumpscars - The Official Prequel to the Film (Jumper)</a>

I appreciate great acting, but I didn't expect Indiana Jones to win for best actor.  I likewise didn't expect too much from this acting-wise. Hayden Christensen may not the most expressive actor, but the kid is young!  Be realistic!  Actually, Bilson's portrayal as Millie was much less impressive, an overly flirty one-dimensional take.  And Samuel L. Jackson was almost getting paid twice for the role he played in ""Unbreakable,"" except here his character has the weapons and the strength to really fight the heroes.

Many people also seem to want more back-story and explainations for the science behind his ability to teleport.  Yet don't the backstories in most movies like this make them even less believable?  How often in life do people stop in the middle of something to explain how and why everything is happening?  I was glad that they didn't waste time trying to explain a work of imagination.  This is a science fiction concept, nothing more.

This movie, when viewed as just a movie, is great entertainment and very fun to watch.  Coming into this just as a movie-goer with no preconceived notions, I loved it.  I could suspend disbelief because I know how to let my imagination go when it comes to science fiction.

Essentially, Hayden Christensen plays a young kid who is bullied at school and harassed by an alcoholic father.  He discovers his ability to teleport, and soon is making a new life for himself teleporting all over the world.  He soon discovers he's not the only ""Jumper"" out there, and that a group of paladins are determined to find and kill jumpers.  He returns to his hometown to find his high school crush, and has to deal with telling her his secret ability.

The pacing was really well done.  This movie moves along very quickly.  It may leave a lot of unanswered questions but it also never leaves you dragging.  The score is well done, but there could have been more songs to create a real soundtrack.  They make up for it by moving from location to location with amazing cinematography.

And let me tell you, the sets are amazing!  The camera work on top of Big Ben, at the Sphinx, on the Pyramids, and on and on, it was all amazing.  For those wide shots alone it's worth seeing in the theatres.  I was so jealous this guy could go wherever he wanted, from Europe to Africa to Asia.  I can't wait for the DVD to find out which locations were shot on set and which were created via CGI or some other means.

Other special effects are impressive as well, as we see the ""residue"" of the jumper's as they teleport.  The paladins also have their own tools which are perhaps not as cool. There's also an amazing couple of fight scenes that are peppered in.

The movie does end very quickly, and is clearly based on a plot designed for sequels.  That leaves the story with a lot of loose ends.  Still, I for one would gladly subject myself to a sequel, even look forward to one.

If you want realism, going to see a fantasy thriller isn't going to give it to you.  If you want fun and love science fiction or comics, this movie is fun to watch.

Enjoy!",1204848000,40,4630,5.169354838709677
3168495,1,B00177Y9ZC,"Starring Hayden Christiansen as teleporter David Rice and Samuel L. Jackson as the NSA Specialist charged with finding and stopping all of David's breed, ""Jumper"" makes so many Bad Movie mistakes that it's impossible to know where to begin describing it - or to recommend it.

Across the board, it's definitely one of the most underdeveloped films I've ever sat through: clearly, the cast isn't going to be putting on Shakespeare anytime soon (Christiansen, Jamie Bell and the horrific Avril Lavigne clone that plays the whiney, ungrateful ""love"" interest Millie all give dreadfully hammy, two-dimensional performances, and Samuel L Jackson overacts like Faye Dunaway with a wire hanger), and the basic plot is just that: very, very basic (good guy triumphs over school bullies and dissatisfactory home life, goes on to triumph over evil governmental agency, leaves end WIIIIDE OPEN for many sequels). The script could have been written in crayons by a three-year-old (and not a bright three-year old, at that), and it's full of boring dialogue and uninteresting clich. And the direction, for the most part, reflects the cast and the script: it's not memorable, and it's not entertaining.

So why, when 90% of the movie's elements are either badly put-together (the introduction of the adult Millie is just one scene where this movie looks and feels like a malformed cross between ""The O.C."" and ""Charmed""), did the director not keep the audience focused on the one area where this movie excels: action? The special effect sequences, at least on the big screen, are interesting, and some of the action scenes are very exciting.

But before you know it, those good parts are over - and for a movie whose plot centres on action, there's not very many of them to begin with - and we're once more thrust back into the mess of bad acting, bad scripting and boring story that make up the majority of ""Jumper"".

Personally, this would have worked better as a film about knitwear.... ...but whatever. If you have to see this one, see it in theatres: it needs a big screen to be impressive. Do not waste your money on the DVD: ""Jumper"" does action well, but since the majority of the movie contains no action, you'll only be wasting the better part of $20 for a futile exercise in uninteresting human interest and some pancake-flat dialogue.

One day, when trying to give her a gift, the local bully intervenes and tosses the gift into a frozen river.  When attempting to recover the gift, David falls through and is trapped.  At least, he is until he teleports into the middle of the Ann Arbor library.  Everyone believes him to be dead, and he sees it as a chance to start over.  He hones his skills as well.  To get some money, he robs a bank, and that is when NSA agent Roland (Jackson) notices him.  Roland doesn't like ""jumpers.""  As an adult, David (Christensen) lives a good life.  He returns home to see Millie (Bilson), and she notices that something is different about him.  He also finds out he is not alone.  There are other ""jumpers"" that are being hunted by ""paladins"" whose only desire is to kill them.  When Roland finds David, David is in for the fight of his life, because Roland is out for blood.

""Jumper"" is an interesting idea that is poorly executed.  Christensen has proven himself to be a wooden actor, and this is no exception.  He is a poor choice for David.  The action and the effects are top notch.  The origin story is well told, and I'm not a fan of origin stories.  The powers and the war between jumpers and paladins is left vague enough to make you want more.  The biggest problem with the movie (aside from Christensen's acting) is the fact that the movie doesn't end so much as it just stops.  The last five minutes leave a nasty taste in your mouth as David confronts one of the bad guys and is given a head start.  He decides to take a leisurely direction even though he is still the hunted.  Clearly, ""Jumper"" is set up for a sequel, but when that sequel is not a given, a movie needs to provide some closure.

Now I have no problem with the underlying concept of this or any other science fiction story, but regardless of the improbability of the plot, I expect the script to respect the intelligence of the viewer or at least his memory by not violating previously accepted facts in the film.  In JUMPERS, the script fails on both counts.

What we are expected to believe is that a race of teleporters called ""Jumpers"" has existed for millenia and that a second group called ""Paladins"" exists only to kill them. Now if this sounds like a rehash of HIGHLANDERS I can accept that but at least with HIGHLANDERS there was a history and a plausible explanation given for the need to kill the immortals. Here, the Paladins led by a one note Samuel Jackson are a group of religious fanatics whose only justification for the killing is that ""Only God should have the power to be everywhere at once.""  The plot revolves around a montage of visual escapes that takes the Jumpers and the pursuing Paladins through the Sphinx, Mount Everest, the Coloseum in Rome, Hong Kong, the North Pole and so many other well-known locations that the viewer has difficulty grasping how that particular jump spot fits into the film's plot in any meaningful way.  The answer. of course, is that it does not and that is why viewer interest and film credibility is soon lost.  Further, the acting is second rate. Diane Lane is wasted in a walk on as Christianson's mother and her explanation of who her son is makes less sense than who she is.

This is a prime example, but its problems didn't stop there. The acting was just abysmal - Sammuel Jackson was completely unsuited to this role in the first place, and sure enough he made a mess of it.

Religious people are all fanatical killers going back to the ""Inquisition."" Only narcissistic 20-Somethings are the heroes in the world of Jumper.

Nope! He grabs a surf board and teleports to some Pacific Island country to surf those extra powerful waves! How disgusting and shocking! What are the writers of this story trying to tell us? That 20-30 year olds are so gross they only care about themselves? So, in a real sense, there are absolutely no good guys in this pathetic film!

I'm also very tolerant and forgiving as a movie fan -- invariably, I find something at least resonably worthwhile, or at least entertaining, about a movie.  Not so ""Jumpers"".  It really takes quite an awful movie to actually make me regret the ticket expense -- what's a few dollars for 90 minutes of big-screen entertainment, right?  Wrong.  As other reviewers have alluded to, ""Jumpers"" is simply a title (and some none-too-special special effects) in search of a plot, even the vestiges of continuity and logic, and any engagement with the audience at all.  It fails - miserably - on all three counts.  The acting is amateurish at best, the plot holes are large enough to navigate an oil tanker through, and the saddest loss of all is Samuel L. Jackson's ridiculous character and performance -- other than his paycheck, which I'm sure he happily deposited as he laughed all the way to the bank, it was a waste of a competent actor's talents.

Not ""Jumpers"".  Even if one forgives the utter lack of explanation and background story behind the origins of the ""Jumpers"" and the ""Paladins"", there could still have been a cohesive plot that actually progressed toward some logical conclusion.  Instead, what we have here is a non-stop chase sequence and travelogue of places throughout the world (including, ludicrously, the top of the Egyptian Sphinx's head, apparently a frequent lunch spot for our hero), a ridiculous ""plot"" about an age-old conflict between two groups that the world at large doesn't know exist, and...let's see, and...  I guess that's it.  Really,  There's NOTHING else to this movie.

Then, after a teenish bit of bad judgement, he falls through the surface of a frozen river. Once under the ice, the river's current drags him away from the opening, and from light and air. When his lungs are about to burst ... he and a fair bit of river water suddenly materialize in a familiar library.

David is a ""Jumper,"" with an incredible ability to teleport himself anywhere, a knack that he soon brings under voluntary control. In teen-off-the-leash style, he makes free with bank vaults and any other interior that holds something he wants, which is pretty much everything. I said that he's ""a"" jumper - not the only one. There are others, and there is a secretive cabal dedicated to ridding the world of jumpers.

It turns pretty predictable after that. The effects make this flick, especially the fights and chases between two Jumpers. There are worse ways you could kill a few hours on a boring weekend - it really is fair entertainment, with some (but not much) less-than-graphic violence and people who keep their clothes on.

3402170,2,B00177Y9ZC,"At first, I honestly couldn't tell if ""Jumper"" was a milestone of science fiction camp or just a really bad movie. Moments of this film are so obviously ridiculous that it's difficult to imagine their inclusions as unintentional. Consider the fact that Hayden Christensen's character--who has the ability to teleport himself to wherever he wants--literally ends up atop famous landmarks, such as the face of Big Ben, or the head of the Sphinx; honestly, doesn't this seem like an inside joke on the filmmaker's part? But after a while, I had to admit to myself that it wasn't supposed to be campy and that I wasn't having fun. This movie is just plain frustrating, not only because it fails to tell a coherent story, but also because it assumes we'll understand it even though it doesn't explain itself. Watching ""Jumper"" is like playing a video game without knowing the rules, what the goal is, or even how to use the controller.

The science fiction element is probably the most frustrating thing of all, simply because it's an intriguing concept that has nothing to fall back on. It can't even rely on the plot, which can't be described without falling through one of its numerous holes. Example: the prologue establishes that small-town Detroit boy David Rice discovered the power to transport himself at age fifteen (Max Thieriot), when he ended up in a library after walking on a frozen lake and falling through some thin ice. But wait a minute--as an adult (Christensen) in the story proper, he's informed that he first transported at age five. If that's true, then I have a hard time believing he'd forget something like that for ten straight years.

Never mind; what is clear is that David's power--called Jumping--can take him across any distance, from a few feet to a few thousand miles. And indeed, he Jumps all over the world on any given day, using only a postcard or a mental image to get him to his destination (and that makes we wonder about the moment he saved himself from drowning at age fifteen, since I can't imagine him visualizing a library). Oh, and in case you're wonder how David supports himself, it should be noted here that he's a very rich young man, living in one of New York City's most expensive areas. He's never been a hard worker, but he can steal money by jumping to and from sealed bank vaults. He eventually uses that money to take his high school sweetheart--Millie (Rachel Bilson)--on a trip to Rome. He, of course, doesn't Jump there, since that would be telling her too much too soon. But considering how annoying and unbelievable she is, I don't think it would have mattered a great deal.

We're soon introduced to a man named Roland (Samuel L. Jackson), and that's when the story really gets confusing. Roland, you see, is the leader of the Paladins, a group dedicated to hunting down and destroying every last Jumper on earth. As for why Roland does this, all he ever says is, ""Only God should have the power to be in all places at once."" He also says that, sooner or later, all Jumpers turn bad. What he doesn't say is why or how, nor does he even hint at a Paladin back-story, such as how long they've been chasing Jumpers and why they feel so threatened by them. That would have been helpful, don't you think? Roland shows his angry side by shocking Jumpers with metal rods that shoot out electrified wires; this wouldn't have been a problem had the film actually attempted to explain what these weapons were.

David soon learns that he's not the only Jumper. Here enters Griffin (Jamie Bell), an antisocial hothead who hunts Paladins from his shack in the middle of one of the world's deserts. He says that he's been tracking David for the past ten years, which is difficult to understand since he looks about as old as David does, maybe even younger. He also says that he lost his parents when he was only five, and this was because the Paladins discovered his ability to Jump. Again, I ask why. And again, I say never mind, because I haven't even gotten to the final major sequence, which sees Millie trapped in Roland's clutches, awaiting David to return from a showdown with Griffin.

Have I made it clear just how infuriating this movie is? Probably not--this review is just as rambling and confused as the film itself. ""Jumper"" is all action but no setup, a cool-looking science fiction thriller that tells us nothing but expects us to be entertained nonetheless. My biggest beef related to David's back story, a classic case of feeling unloved and unwanted; when he was only five, his mother (Diane Lane) left him and his abusive, alcoholic father (Michael Rooker), so by the time he turned fifteen, he had had enough rejection in his life. I won't reveal why his mother left, although I will say that her reasons only added more questions to an ever-growing list. This movie can do nothing more than raise questions, which makes me wonder if director Doug Liman intentionally left the explanations out of the final cut. Here's hoping that fixing this film is as simple as releasing an exhaustively re-cut extended version; it might be something I can watch without feeling so damn lost.",1203033600,10,5145,4.693244739756367
3402171,3,B00177Y9ZC,"It is finally here--the first mega-budget, CGI-laden, ""blockbuster"" of the year, but its' jump falls short of great, and lands on moderate instead.

David Rice (played Hayden Christensen) learns at age fifteen he as the ability to teleport anywhere, through anything, at anytime. He quickly learns how to harness his power and control it, and then before long he as robbed a bank and is on his way to the ""good life"". Fast-forward  till he is older, he now has a dream apartment in New York and spends his days trotting the globe--breakfast in Paris, surfing in Fiji, lunch on top of the Sphinx, one night stand in London, etc.--you get the picture.

He returns home wanting to find his high school crush, Millie (played by Rachel Bilson). He finds her working at the local bar and obviously wants to share his dream-existence with her. There lies a big problem as she quickly suspects something, and before he has time to explain everything to her his ""perfect"" existence is suddenly threatened.
It is threatened by a detective Roland (played by Samuel L. Jackson) who is investing the first bank robbery, and slowly starts tracking David. Roland knows about these ""jumpers"", and tracks them down to kill them reminding each one repeatedly ""Only God should have the power...."" As he gets closer to David and his loved ones, the film accelerates into a blinding pace of ""jumping"" action until the end which neatly setup a new franchise.

Because of its' poor script, direction, and editing, the special effects and settings are what make this film good. Yes we have seen other superheroes teleport, but I do not remember ever seeing Night-crawler lounging in a beach chair on top of the Sphinx's head or riding thirty-foot waves in Fiji. Watching him do everything you could ever want with this new power is what makes it entertaining, as you anticipate the next destination you will be whisked off to.

Hayden Christensen proves he really can act after, and he gives a solid performance, although Jamie Bell (playing another jumper) steals any and all scenes he appears in with his intense, energetic, comic-relief presence. Diane Lane's cameo is a pleasant surprise, and Rachel Bilson's performance as the girlfriend is sincere.

My main complaint was the ending, which is so happily clique and a blatant setup for a sequel it leaves you with the feeling ""that's it?"" I still liked it. Overall this is a pure popcorn, eye-candy thriller that is entertaining enough if you do not try to think about it to hard, and can hold you over till this Summer's ""real"" blockbusters!",1203033600,3,2573,4.849658314350798
3402172,2,B00177Y9ZC,"With all the phenomenal superpowers and grandiose action potential, Jumper ultimately falls short in execution. Creative ideas are at work, yet so little is done to properly expand upon their possibilities. What is essentially marketed as a sci-fi action film displays only a few scenes of solid mayhem (the majority of which is revealed in the trailers) and any sci-fi elements are left almost entirely unexplained. Jumper does manage to entertain with the anticipation of something grand, and rooting for an antihero who possesses almost no likeable traits poses an interestingly twisted charm, but the frustration with similarities between what could have been and what ended up threatens to negate any positives.

After falling into a frozen lake and magically teleporting to safety, David Rice (Hayden Christensen) realizes the potential of his mysterious gift. Running away from home, he begins to live life to the fullest - at the expense of others. Robbing banks and teleporting to exotic locales around the world, David amasses a small fortune and a glamorous lifestyle that he uses to woo his childhood sweetheart, Millie (Rachel Bilson). Traveling to Rome to seduce her, David encounters Griffin (Jamie Bell), another ""jumper,"" and learns of a secret organization whose mission is to hunt down and destroy those possessing such teleportation abilities. Desperate to avoid capture and protect Millie, David must join forces with Griffin to stop the murderous organization leader, Roland (Samuel L. Jackson).

Chances are many a critic will have ill to say about the acting, and while much of the negativity may take aim at Hayden Christensen, it has less to do with his acting abilities and more to do with the scope of the character he was given to portray. With all of his teleporting superpowers, David feels too normal; his traits steer towards the selfish reality of having such gifts. He uses his power to chase girls, rob banks, and picnic atop famous structural wonders. Few redeeming qualities or admirable motives surface in this antihero-of-sorts and renders the warning ""there are always consequences"" somewhat of a joke. The consequences of such materialistic wrongdoing is that an angry, white-haired black man will hunt you down - but you'll still save the day and get the girl without anyone really having to pay. For some unknown reason we're supposed to root for this character (perhaps a lesser of two evils?) and even more inexplicably we do. So is Christensen to blame? Yes, but that's not a bad thing. Rachel Bilson's Millie offers a pretty face and ugly dialogue, and Griffin exhibits even fewer likeable qualities than David, but is much less interesting. Sam Jackson plays himself again, complete with requisite scars and terrible costume.

Teleporting has always been a fascinating creation of science fiction, and Jumper's premise requires no reason and only a destination. Choosing to explain nothing isn't nearly as unsatisfying as choosing not to jump outside the box and realize truly creative possibilities. David only uses his powers to travel to exotic locations, woo girls, and unburden banks of their money - not that there's anything wrong with that, but I had hoped for some slightly more jaw-dropping uses of such a limitless ability.

Doug Liman's latest actioner steadies itself upon a promising premise and then never decides to jump off. Predictable characters, an overused (albeit cool) special effect, and countless unresolved conflicts keep Jumper from achieving greatness. The film ironically parallels David's early proposition to Millie to ""skip the boring parts"" of their journey - but apparently it also skipped over anything that would have given the film enough substance to stay afloat.

In fact all the previously saved 'FREE' movies on my list were no longer free.  Annoying!

3402282,4,B00177Y9ZC,"I was thinking about giving Jumper a 3-star rating based on some really mediocre downtime in the middle when the storyline lacks direction for a while (strange for an action movie but then again maybe I just lost interest) but I suppose the many special effects and the fairly original concept of a young man being able to jump around from one location to another in the blink of an eye is enticing enough to give the film a slightly higher rating.  This is definitely for fans of science fiction mixed with action, but don't be surprised if you find yourself disliking this movie.

Just to give everyone a heads up, my review contains a bunch of spoilers, so SPOILER ALERT from here on out!

It stars Hayden Christensen who possesses such magical jumping abilities when he falls through the ice and nearly drowns, but a moment later wakes up soaking wet on the floor of the local library, haha.  How did THAT happen!  More storytelling could have explained the whys and hows in greater detail, but sadly the film is short at only 90 minutes.  All this sudden location jumping reminds me of dreaming!  At least that's how I dream.

It turns out Hayden's isn't the only one with such an amazing ability.  There's a few more jumpers out there too.  Hayden meets one of them (Jamie Bell's character) while in Rome.  At first the two don't get along particularly well because Jamie's pretty much convinced that hiding and toying with the bad guys when confronted is the only way to live his life.  The bad man- Samuel L. Jackson- is aware of such an unexplainably insane jumping ability and considers it immoral, so he desires to kill all these jumpers by stabbing them in the chest.  Hayden and Jamie find themselves eventually working together to take out the bad men who are persistently following their every move but it takes a while for the two to finally get on the same page.

For the most part the film takes place in Rome Italy, where Hayden and his girlfriend (the adorable Rachel Bilson) go on a vacation because 8 years prior in high school Rachel wanted to go to Rome.  Meanwhile before this, Hayden spent eight years hiding and everyone in town assumed he either died or disappeared.  The movie gets a little strange near the end when these dimensions form that Hayden, Rachel and Jamie go through as a way to try and avoid evil.  The evil being Samuel L. Jackson's character.  It's amazing how Samuel L. Jackson is able to track their moves so well.  Hayden also has issues with his father (Michael Rooker) and the two never get along, which leads to a couple funny moments such as when his father is about to break into Hayden's bedroom to confront his behavior only for Hayden to quickly jump to another location leaving nothing but dust and papers blowing around by the time the father breaks the lock and walks into his room, lol.

Overall, well to be honest the action is really lousy because it's just a bunch of quick camera jerks as a way to explain Hayden's jump from one location to another, but otherwise Jumper is decent enough to satisfy me.  The acting from all the characters is passable but nothing great, the storyline could've been bigger and better for sure with an extra 30 minutes to explain certain events in greater detail without the story feeling like it was sloppily thrown together (much like my review because I'm in a hurry tonight, hehe) and the constant jumping around can be almost comical at times (jumping inside a bank safe to steal money?  And returning with a bigger bag that can hold more money?  Haha, that's just silly!)  I think Hayden should have told Rachel about his amazing abilities sooner too.  She wouldn't have understood necessarily but well, at least he would've been honest and upfront right away saving hassle in the future!",1454025600,2,3789,4.62780269058296

3402328,3,B00177Y9ZC,"The basic story line of a human being (David) who discovers he has the power to teleport himself anywhere in the world is pretty good, and had a lot of promise. The movie did not make as much of that promise as it could have though. The movie turned David into your basic unrepentant bank robber as he jumped into bank vaults, stole pillow cases full of cash and jumped out. That aspect of his character made me find him an unattractive character.

Soon he runs across an ancient group of religious nuts called the Paladins that hunt jumpers down. No real reason, they just seem to think it is a good idea. The chief religious nut is played by Samuel L. Jackson, who does a fair job of playing a psychopath with a religious bent.

David eventually goes back home after a number of years of absence to visit with his old girlfriend Millie. This character had no appeal to me at all, and other then being attractive, I never really got what he saw in her. He takes her to Italy to see the Colosseum and runs into another jumper, and then the Paladins attack. The other jumper is well portrayed as paranoid and amoral. I guess when you have that kind of power, there is a temptation to use it, and not in a good way. Maybe the Paladins have the right idea after all.

There is a lot of havoc raised through the movie that is not bad. Kind of noisy in spots, but pretty good.

Somewhere along the way he runs into his mother who turns out to be a Paladin.

Overall, as such movies go, it is OK. Not especially good, but as a way to kill a few hours, there are worse ways.",1436400000,2,1567,4.21

3402340,3,B00177Y9ZC,"I was just channel surfing one day and ended up stopping on this movie. I saw the previews and thought it looked horrible and was not interested in the least.  But after watching the film I was surprised to end up liking it and found it pretty interesting. Those who panned the movie with low reviews I wondered if they gave this movie a fair watch before judging it.  The acting was decent and plot made pretty good sense to me.  The ability to teleport anywhere you wanted in the world and never have to worry about finances or money seemed pretty cool.  The bank vault scenes seemed very realistic to someone with that kind of power.  The character seems to want to explore and have fun go surfing enjoy life etc etc.  You don't see him living in a palace or mansion being greedy like Monty Burns.

I thought Samuel L Jackson did another excellent job as a tracker to stop the Jumpers.  I have never read the book so I cannot reference it compared to the movie. But from just watching the film alone I thought it was interesting and different than your average SCI FI film.  I absolutely loathed all three Star Wars prequel films that Hayden was in, but did not think this movie was too bad.  I would easily watch this film over some of the new action movies coming out recently.",1434499200,4,1282,4.371308016877637

3402349,3,B00177Y9ZC,"I read the book first and yes, this movie has little overlap as others have complained. Still a nice effort worth seeing.

However one thing that spoilt the film for me was the scene where the 2 male stars drive through a Japanese city (Tokyo?) in a European car. The car is meant for driving on the right side of the road. But in Japan they like UK drive on the left! If you look at the background, you can see the traffic is moving on the left.

Now you might say it's a European car so it should be as shown in the film. But no. Japan like UK requires imports to be adapted for left side driving. The scenes of closeup of the driver and passenger talking to each other have the background traffic dubbed in. I am guessing that to US watchers, this could completely pass them by. Everything seems as it should for the closeups. Better would have been the use of a left sided car. If nothing else, it subtly emphasises that they are indeed in a different country. It is obvious with the Asian backdrop; but tweaking it via a correct car gives an authentic nuance. Especially because the driver is British, so he indeed is used to that driving.",1431820800,,1144,4.291666666666667

This movie had NOTHING!  No discernible 3D effects, no plot, no point, no character development, and the ""hero"" of our ""story"" was basically a narcissistic criminal.

With the basic premise (as told in the Amazon blurb) I wanted to like it.  But we get into the movie and bam, violence everywhere, which I wasn't expecting.  So, you know, take that or leave it, that wasn't why it was terrible.  The reason it was terrible:  there was a single unexplained idea that was hammered absolutely to death.  Here's what the movie's about: there are two kinds of people (outside of normal people, evidently): people who can jump, and people who are against their jumping on some unclear biblical basis.  The entire movie is the main guy figuring out he can jump, and then running from people who think he has no right to. The story is utterly lacking in depth or detail (I'm talking about the movie - I haven't read the book, and perhaps things are better there).  It's really a sad shame that this wasn't better, because it really could have been good.

3402427,4,B00177Y9ZC,"I just got this DVD the other day and unfortunately, it took me 6 years to finally give this a chance. Fast-forward to today and I actually like this movie. The acting was smooth and on key. No complaints there. I give that an A. The storyline is good but I'm going to have to give that a B. There are some things that just weren't explained. Yeah, I know they were trying to explain as much as they could in a limited amount of time but I mean, ok, the dude was born with the ability to teleport from point A to point B but how about a little background story with how the jumper powers came to exist. There has to be more to it than just being born with the powers right?!! And I know David's mom left when he was a little boy but how about explaining more about his mother's other new life that she started for herself after leaving David and his father??? There are some unanswered questions to this movie that just leaves me wondering if all of those things were answered in the movie. Anyway, pretty good.

Samuel Jackson plays a better bad guy than a good guy in my opinion and he just makes this movie shine. Personally, he was the only guy in the movie keeping my attention. All of the actors are good but Sam just takes it like always.

Special Effects: A
Language: Some expletives, but light, not too heavy.
Violence: Moderate
Action: A

Overall Rating. I give it B+.

I thought the movie was slick and there was some thought put into it and it keeps the audience guessing. Honestly, I wish I could have seen this in the theaters when it came out but now that I have it on DVD, I'm glad that I made the purchase.

The real trouble starts when he runs into the band of zealots who wish to wipe out all Jumpers.

3402449,2,B00177Y9ZC,"I am in the process of reading the book Jumper, and was excited to see that it was made into a movie. I was apprehensive about watching it before finishing the book, but I need not have worried. The lead character and his love interest's names are the same, and he can teleport, but that's the only similarity to the book. I gave my review 2 stars because Christensen and Jackson are nice to look at, but the movie kept me wondering when it was going to start... for 90 minutes. The lead has no likable qualities, and doesn't use his abilities for good, as he does in the book. The characters are not ""Fleshed out"" and you have no idea why they are the way they are. Then they left it open at the end for a sequel. GGGRRR! After the movie, I watched the special features where the director stated he wanted to take the idea and go completely away from the story and do his own thing. Big mistake. What he did was create a movie where  there is no story line, no plot and no likeable characters. What's the point of making a movie out of a book if your not going to follow the original story even a little bit?!? Isn't that the whole reason to begin with, to make a movie out of a story that has a big fan base?

The analogy to other highly evolved beings being sought out by a kind of Inquisition bent on murdering them is lost on many. Saints, sages, yogis, lamas, prophets and messiahs have been said to be able to physically appear and disappear (see Yogananda's Autobiography of a Yogi). This story seems more plausible than the freakish X-men and their comic superpowers. The film has its weaknesses, but if you have eyes and ear to see beyond these, it's quite an inspiring film. I wonder why sequels have been prevented from being considered? Seems the film may be too close to someone's home. H.Dk.",1405900800,,727,5.066666666666666

The movie is like the book in the same way that a Cessna 150 is like the space shuttle. The movie is only loosely based upon the book.

The book has no 'Palladins', David Rice does not meet up with another 'jumper', his mother is not the head of the group trying to kill him. To say that I was disappointed in the movie is an understatement.

The book describes David Rice as an abused high school student. His father is whipping him with a belt when he discovers his ability. Later, he is shown running from US Government agents who discover his powers while he is trying to capture and kill the terrorists who killed his mother during an airplane hijacking in Cypress where she was travelling as a travel agent. The original story has enough action, character development, humor and a very topical plot for today's headlines to have made a great film. Why the screenwriters deviated from the original is beyond me. They must not have a tight grip on reality or are really thick.

Take a hint. Read the book after you watch the film, otherwise you will be as disappointed as I am.",1395792000,,1195,4.36936936936937

3402613,2,B00177Y9ZC,"The premise of ""Jumper"" is an interesting one.  It deals with a young boy, who is living with his father (both were abandoned by his mother), and discovers that he has an amazing superpower that allows him to teleport from one place to another anywhere in the world, in an instant.  He inadvertently discovers this while trying to escape drowning in an ice-covered lake.

  Flash forward several years, and this boy, named David Rice (Hayden Christensen), is now in his 20's and is living a hedonistic, but low-key, lifestyle based on his ability to teleport in and out of banks without notice and make off with a fortune.  While most of the populace have no clue that this is happening, Roland Cox (Samuel L. Jackson), of a collective called the Paladins, has tracked David down.  It seems the Paladins goal to strike back against and exterminate all of these 'Jumpers'.

  On the surface, this seems like there could be a very impressive contest of wills and skills between David and Roland.  Unfortunately, the promise is wasted on a relatively pedestrian plot.  Yes, there are battles between the two sides and travels exotic locales.  However, the intensity never rises above a low-grade fever.  Normally, cinematic whipping boy, Hayden Christensen, would take the fall for something like this.  However, he holds up his end just fine.  The fault lies with the uninspired direction of Doug Liman.  This is particularly disappointing since he was responsible for films like ""Swingers"", ""Go"", ""Bourne Identity"" and ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"".

  There is a sequel in the works.  Hopefully that films picks of the pace so that this one can just be categorized as another in a long line of underwhelming superhero 'origin' films.",1372032000,,1722,4.930313588850174

3402626,3,B00177Y9ZC,"I found the idea of someone being able to jump from place to place just by picturing it in their mind fascinating. I admit I'm not a fan of Hayden Christensen after the job he did in the Star Wars movies, but I felt he was pretty good in the film Shattered Glass so I gave this film a try. I looked at the cast they put around him and I felt that this really could have worked, but it felt a little flat.

Samuel L. Jackson is is great as he always is. I liked him as the pseudo bad guy who hunts down the ""Jumpers."" Rachel Bilson was cute and likeable, but there were a couple of scenes where she looked like a deer in headlights. Hayden gave an alright performance, but nowhere near as good as in Shattered Glass. I know his character is supposed to be a little pompous, but it came across badly on screen. Diane Lane...oh, boy. This film could have definitely benefitted from more of her. It felt like there was probably more material with her in it, but for some reason it was cut from the finish product. If I remember correctly, the movie clocked in at under 90 minutes so I don't see why we couldn't have had a little more of Diane. In fact, when it was all said and done, it felt like the movie was shorter than it had originally intended to be which is probably why I was left unfulfilled. In the end, I felt as if I were rushed into my seat only to be told to get the heck out of the theater right as the ending came. Sorry, dear Jumper. You were kind of fun, but I never even got a chance to know you.

An alright movie with a great idea that probably should have been done a little better.

3402634,3,B00177Y9ZC,"I'll admit, going in, I was prepared to hate this film.  I figured that it would Jump the Shark completely.  Well luckily, I was able to make it through the film without being devoured along the way.

You know the synopsis, so I won't bore you with those details.  And you know that this is a high-concept thingamajig, so I won't give you that one-liner that somehow drew some producer in to greenlighting this project.  OK; so I lied.  ""Well, there's this dude who has some genetic anomaly that allows him to 'jump' from place to place!""  ""Wow, that's a really cool idea.  I like it!  Get me the script!""

I did have a problem or two with this movie, of course.  First of all, how was it that Hayden Christensen was able to ""jump"" from place to place, but never seemed to end up in, say, the middle of a wall?  He always seemed to land in the middle of the room.  If he hadn't been somewhere before, that seemed impossible to me as he wouldn't know where to ""land.""  Furthermore, this guy was supposed to have some genetic predisposition to being able to ""jump.""  Now, that's all well and good -- although they don't really explain that genetic anomaly in the film, they just wave their hands about it all -- but how did he, and other ""jumpers"" then move other objects as well?  How did they even ""jump"" their clothes?  I mean, after all, I'm assuming that clothes don't really have DNA (well, the cotton is dead if it does).  Jumpers should have arrived at their destinations, well, naked.

But I did somewhat like the love interest here; I often complain about films having a love interest strictly because Hollywood, and Americans, mistakenly believe that you always need one.  It did allow the filmmaker to use the old-and-trusted dramatic irony here and there; we knew that Mr. Christensen could ""jump"" but his gal-pal didn't.  (Potential spoiler.)  And a nice little cameo by Kristen Stewart at the end gave me a very good chuckle.  I wondered, ""Who would win in a fight between a Jumper and a Vampire?""

You won't be a complete Patsy if you watch this film, so I'll say this film is mildly groovy and give it a minor ""Eh!""",1367712000,,2130,4.472727272727273

3402677,5,B00177Y9ZC,"Jumper is the first film from a trilogy of books by Steven Gould, and while I loved this film, most critics panned it. The story centers around a young Davey (Hayden Christensen), who during a life-threatening event, come to realize he has the power to teleport wherever he wants. Unbeknownst to Davey, he is a member of a group of genetically superior humans known as Jumpers, who are currently at war with a religious organization, that believes their power is evil. What starts out as a simple kid having fun and trying to impress, becomes a fight for survival in this amazing action thriller. You can always tell when a story is adapted from a book, rather than an original screenplay, because the story tends to be more thought out. Not to say screenplays are bad, but when a story isn't made simply to be a movie, it tends to be much more focused on the story, where as screenplays have to worry about the story as well as the aesthetics. Nevertheless, Jumper isn't just another shoot 'em story, it's the perfect mix of action and drama with some outstanding performances. I love Hayden Christensen, who I think is made for roles like this, he has this cool demeanor to him, that's more clever than arrogant. Jamie Bell is also terrific as Griffin, a fellow jumper Davey meets along the way,  and he provides some much needed comic relief. ...and then there's Samuel L. Jackson.

3402721,1,B00177Y9ZC,"I realize movies actors need to make a living! But big stars like Hayden Christensen and Samuel L. Jackson should be ashamed of themselves - they can pick and choose their projects. Memo to Their Hollywood Agents: You are ruining their careers! If dreary, campy films are all you can find for them to work on then maybe you shouldn't be in the movie star agent business!

It's too bad there's not a law in the United States allowing you to get a full ticket refund if you walk out of the theater after watching 50% or less of a movie. A bell could ring or light could flash for a second to remind the patrons of a last call for a refund! If a system like this was in place in the United States, I guarantee you - rotten, boring trash like Jumper would never, ever be made! Half the theater would have emptied out in a heartbeat! This film is so incredibly vapid and mind-numbingly dull it genuinely insults the intelligence of the movie going audience!!

There is absolutely nothing redeeming about this godforsaken, awful story! The good guys teleport (A mutant power rip-off from the X-Men). The bad guys are religious nuts that kill the teleporters in cold blood because ""only God should have this power."" Simple as that! Each group tries to kill the other. The good guys are all really sexy looking guys and gals in there 20's! All the bad guys are about 20 years older and could be the good guys parents! And in one case, the bad guy is a parent! One of the most memorable lines: ""When you were five years old I had to either kill you or leave you. You shouldn't have come here (parent's home), but I will give you a head start."" What a pal!

When I heard this line I thought to myself, ""how inspiring!"" Parents are all defective or crazy religious zealots or non-existent. Religious people are all fanatical killers going back to the ""Inquisition."" Only narcissistic 20-Somethings are the heroes in the world of Jumper. But even they are so narcissistic, that when the Christmas Eve Tsunami hits the Indian Ocean nations of the world, does our hero, Hayden Christensen, go and use his incredible teleporting powers to save those drowning before his eyes on the T.V. news? Nope! He grabs a surf board and teleports to some Pacific Island country to surf those extra powerful waves! How disgusting and shocking! What are the writers of this story trying to tell us? That young 20-something adults are so gross they only care about themselves? So in a real sense, there are absolutely no good guys in this pathetic film!

I hope those responsible for crafting this demoralizing trash get kicked out of the Writers Union! I'm sure there are plenty of talented writers in the world who can churn out a decent story, and would give their eye-teeth to break into show business! One can only hope!

3402723,3,B00177Y9ZC,"Jumpers(released Feb/08)stars Hayden Christensen (Max Thieriot) as David Rice,Rachel Bilson (AnnaSophia Robb) as Millie Harris,Samuel L. Jackson as Roland Cox,Jamie Bell as Griffin,Diane Lane as Mary Rice,and others. This Doug Liman directed film is an uneven effort,which never seems to build up any steam for any length of time,thus losing the interest of the viewer very quickly.
The film opens as a younger David Rice is in high school. A bully throws a snow globe onto some ice,which David retrieves. However the ice gives way and the current pulls him under. Just as he is about to drown he teleports himself into the local library. From here he tries to understand his new found abilities. He runs away from home and goes to live in New York where he robs banks in order to survive on his own.
years pass and it seems his jumping has not gone unnoticed,as one Roland Cox is the head of an agency that tracks and kills jumpers. On a return trip to his apartment he is confronted by Cox who tries to rope him with steel cables which are electrified,to prevent him from jumping. He barely manages to get away and flees home. He meets up with his old flame whom he escorts to Rome. While in the Coliseum he meets up with another jumper called Griffin. He explains the folks after him are Paladins(have gun will travel?),an ancient order dedicated to wiping out all jumpers. In short order the two confront two such men,but escape. They escape the Paladins,but not the local police who arrest David. While in jail his mother visits him and releases him. He takes his girlfriend to the airport and she flies home alone.
David and Griffin form a brief partnership to get Cox. Meanwhile Cox has attempted to kill David's father,who he finds and takes to a hospital. David then returns to his girlfriend and snatches her away to Griffins hideaway. But jumpers leave slight openings which Cox uses to find them with. A fight ensues resulting in Millie's capture. David returns to her but is captured. He teleports part of the building to the river in which he almost drowned in years before,then back to the library. However Cox has been pulled along with him and he teleports him to a remote cave above the Grand Canyon.
The film ends as David visits his mother and she explains she is in fact a Paladin also,and gives him a head start. David and Millie jump to a destination unknown.
The film ends abruptly and I thought there was more coming when it did. There are a ton of unanswered questions in this film,the least of which is David's mother. It appeared to me she was also a jumper,but she turns out to be a Paladin too,who normally don't have that ability. David apparently first jumped at five,but for some unknown reason doesn't remember that. What five year old wouldn't recall such a thing when he grew up? At one point the older David is looking at a TV new story about people stranded in a river atop a car,with the reporter questioning as to how they could be rescued. I thought the next scene would be David jumping there to at least do SOME good,instead of just taking(money)and living off the avails of others. But the film just breezes past it. The questions go on and on. As said previously it is a hodge podge of a film that never leaves you invested in the characters for any length of time whatsoever. Even the wonderful filming locales such as Rome or in Egypt couldn't make up for the interest loss. It's as if the filmmakers didn't have much of a vested interest in making it the film themselves,which translated into apathy on screen.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1. Extras include:commentary,an animated graphic novel of Davids story,three featurettes and some deleted scenes. This two disc set contains the film disc and extras and a digital copy.
All in all a film with lots of potential but with a lacklustre script and execution by its makers. You soon lose any interest in the characters,which inevitably will sink a film faster than a cement block in the Hudson. 2 1/2 - 3 stars.",1352678400,,4037,4.623955431754875

If you look past that, however, the story isn't too bad. With lots of action once it gets going, the effects are impressive and the extras are worthwhile as well. I bought the DVD version locally then got the Blu ray here at Amazon so I could see the improved image that's supposed to provide. When Davy meets his mother for the last time near the movies end he meets his sister (?), that's a quick view of Kristen Stewart you'll be getting, I didn't realize that until I saw her name in the credits.

3402746,3,B00177Y9ZC,"Jumper is a thrilling, touching story of David and Millie in high school. However, when the film jumps eight years the romantic story falls apart.

Max Thieriot and AnnaSophia Robb as teenagers David and Millie are just right with teenage angst and chemistry.  Hayden Christensen and Rachel Bilson as the mid-twenties David and Millie just does not work.  There is no spark, no chemical reaction.  Rachel Bilson is a talented actress, but her talent was wasted in this film opposite Christensen who never showed the exuberant teenage David.

Samuel Jackson adds a nice touch as Roland, the religious zealot Paladin who hunts jumpers because they are an abomination since they possess powers which should be reserved for God only. Jamie Bell as Griffin, the seasoned jumper, carries the second half of this film.

Diana Lane and Michael Rooker as Mary and William Rice are wasted in this film.  These talented actors deserved more screen time and a better script.

The jump scenes are well done.  The fight in the coliseum and in Millie's apartment and Griffin's lair are exciting.

The Paladins have a rich history of being warriors.  It is sad this film did not give a peek into this rich history.

Overall, I give this film 3 stars for the first part with the teenagers, the concept and effects and for Jackson and Bell's characters which definitely save this film.  This film could have been a classic sci-fi if the story had been on David's rise from pretty thief to superhero.",1340496000,,1481,4.829365079365079

3402750,3,B00177Y9ZC,"David is a normal enough high school boy, trying to impress his girl despite the usual kinds of bullies. Then, after a teenish bit of bad judgement, he falls through the surface of a frozen river. Once under the ice, the river's current drags him away from the opening, and from light and air. When his lungs are about to burst ... he and a fair bit of river water suddenly materialize in a familiar library.

David is a ""Jumper,"" with an incredible ability to teleport himself anywhere, a knack that he soon brings under voluntary control. In teen-off-the-leash style, he makes free with bank vaults and any other interior that holds something he wants, which is pretty much everything. I said that he's ""a"" jumper - not the only one. There are others, and there is a secretive cabal dedicated to ridding the world of jumpers.

It turns pretty predictable after that. The effects make this flick, especially the fights and chases between two Jumpers. There are worse ways you could kill a few hours on a boring weekend - it really is fair entertainment, with some (but not much) less-than-graphic violence and people who keep their clothes on. I just hope that Samuel L. Jackson isn't betting his career on woofers like this.

It pits jumpers, who are people who can teleport, but never seem to do anything positive for society, against Paladins, who want to wipe out the jumpers.  The main jumper character is typical of why I didn't particularly like jumpers.  He robs banks, frames a young rival for his own bank robbery, and never, ever tells his girlfriend the truth.  Heroic behavior?  Hardly. The main Paladin, played by Samuel Jackson, seemed more like a good guy to me, although his methods were of course way too extreme (no trial, death penalty).

Actor Jamie Bell, the second jumper, is a great character.  He is a foul-mouthed, little punk with attitude.  It's funny having him as a foil against the more straightlaced and less experienced first jumper, David, played by Hayden Christensen.

3402785,2,B00177Y9ZC,"What if you could go anywhere, at any time, wherever you wanted?  There are people like this - very, very rich people.  They don't have any fear, don't have any comprehension of the worries that plague us all when we travel, or go out alone at night. In Jumper, there's a new category of world traveler: the superhero.

Jumpers, you see, are teleporters.  They can teleport anywhere they've seen and they leave jumpscars - dimensional portals - open for a minute or so after they jump.  If you're fast, you can jump in after them.

That's all you need to know about Jumper, and that's all Jumper is going to share with you.  There are no details behind teleportation (hint: according to modern scientific theory, if you can teleport you can time travel). Filling the role of villain is a shadowy government agency known as Paladins who have figured out how to anchor Jumpers by lassoing them with electrified nets.  They believe that Jumpers are a threat to mankind and see the ability to jump as religious blasphemy - kind of unnecessary, really, as you can imagine that any government agency would be plenty terrified of Jumpers without all the Biblical angst.

But anyway, that's the premise of Jumper: boy meets girl, boy learns to teleport, government agency tries to kill boy, boy meets girl again, repeat until somebody dies.  Only nobody dies.

Jumper has to be the most attractively hollow movie I've seen in a while.  Nothing is resolved. Good guy David Rice (Hayden Christensen, broodingly bland as ever) doesn't ever really learn his lesson, Paladin-hunter Griffin (the far more interesting Jamie Bell) is left in limbo, love interest Millie (also bland Rachel Bilson) doesn't deal with the consequences of a romance with a Jumper, and even archvillain Roland (Samuel L. Jackson with crazy white hair) isn't permanently defeated.  The big reveal about Rice's past has no impact on the plot at all since it's revealed in the last five minutes of the film.

And that's a shame.  Jumpers are weird folks.  They don't need to worry about money, or responsibility, or fear of death.  They just jump away to some other place.  Do that enough and you start to get a little weird.  A relationship for a Jumper has to be quite strange, especially with someone who can't jump - I imagine Jumpers regularly order food and never pay for it, steal clothes and just walk out of the store, and travel all over the globe at a whim...but there only hints of any of this in Jumper.  The film is made up almost entirely of admittedly breathtaking special effects.

There's a reason so many reviewers keep asking for a sequel.  Jumper's barely a prologue. For all of its kinetic energy, Jumper's plot sure doesn't move much.",1294963200,,2716,4.746268656716418

3402790,4,B00177Y9ZC,"I watched Jumper (2008) for a second time this week, having seen it for the first time when it came out on DVD a year or two ago.  I really liked the movie when I first saw it, but I love it even more now.  I've got it on my Top 200 Movie list.  It's one of the few films of the last decade that I can honestly say I wish was quite a bit longer.  It's only 88 minutes and it just flies through those few minutes leaving you wanting more...hence Jumper 2 which is in development now.  Another 30 minutes could easily be added to this flick.  The story is simply so intriguing that I felt that more back story and character development could have been included.  But I also appreciate that director Doug Liman gave us a great short film that never seems to have any dead spots for bathroom breaks.  Liman really changed action movie making IMO with The Bourne Identity (2002), which absolutely blew me away when I saw it on DVD.  It still blows me away at how good that movie is when I see it now.  Liman really crafted a new standard for the thinking man's action movie with The Bourne Identity and then Jumper.  Director Paul Greengrass amazingly took Liman's model and made it even better in the Bourne sequels The Bourne Supremacy (2004) and The Bourne Ultimatum (2007).

Back to Jumper...the story is a combination of sci-fi, action and drama.  The blend is perfect because it all seems so believable within the framework of the movie.  It's probably good that Liman doesn't get into explaining how the teleporting is possible, because that might just take away from the story.  Actors Hayden Christensen and Jamie Bell seem perfectly suited to their characters, as does Samuel Jackson as the ""bad guy"".  Even Rachel Bilson as the love interest in the film is good casting, in sharp contrast to the eye candy status of Megan Fox in Transformers (2007).  Don't get me wrong, Megan Fox is gorgeous looking in Transformers...but that's about it.  Whereas Rachel Bilson is gorgeous looking in Jumper, but she's also a talented actor and shows it in this film.

Of course part of what always makes a good action/drama flick is the filming on location.  And Jumper impresses on that level as well.  The cinematography is brilliant and amazingly Liman got limited access to film in the actual Colosseum in Rome...a rare feat for filmmakers.  The Colosseum scenes are impressive for their beauty.  Apparently they had to film those scenes using only natural light since Colosseum Officials wouldn't allow them to set-up equipment on the ground.  So the shots are all handheld with natural light.

Bottom line is that Jumper is a great film.",1286236800,2,2635,4.627155172413793

From there as he gets older the movie goes downhill.  It seemed like the characters weren't fleshed out enough.  His mother and what she really is a member of and why she left, is revealed (rather weakily) at the end.  And Samuel L. Jackson's character, while interesting, didn't really provide any detail and why he was hunting those with special abilities.  Apparently, there are different gifts given to different people and he was hunting them down to kill them.  Saying ""Only God should have these powers.""  Well, why was he hunting them?  Where did he come from?  Who is he working for?  All these questions left me with very little answers and so the movie just didn't resolve right.  I assume that when directors do these kind of ""stunts"", they'll open for a sequel.  But, if the movie doesn't grab you the first time, who cares about the characters now.  Once something leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth, very seldom would you try another dose.

3402809,3,B00177Y9ZC,"JUMPER

I remember seeing the trailers for this film when it was released and thinking ""man what a good idea for a film"". Of course it is based on a book I believe so I need to pick that up but any way I was never able to see this but finally did. After seeing this finally I have mixed feelings about it but over all enjoyed it. I have heard a lot of things about this movie and actually agree with most of them. What people love about this film is what I love and what they dislike I also agree with. So if there ever is a sequel to be made I hope they listen to the people on this one.

David Rice is your average kid in school, you know the type, has a crush on a girl but he is shy and bullies pick on him. Turns out that he finally gets the courage to talk to Millie and gets his gift to her thrown out on an ice pond courtesy of bully Mark. This leads to David walking out on the ice and falling in when the ice breaks. Right when he is about to drown his first teleportation occurs, and there is no looking back from that point. He spends the next few years learning about his abilities and robbing banks, sounds like a good life being rich and can go anywhere. But there are things he left behind like the girl he liked, his dad, and oh yeah people are hunting him down. Just another day in the life of a jumper I suppose.

The thing about this film that I found a little disappointing is that there is not any character development for the most part. All the characters are just introduced and off we go, one reason to read the book I guess. Also the film seemed like different movies at times, it needed to find an identity. Still there are so good things that come out of this film such as the action. The action comes plenty of times and always is entertaining and may be the redeeming thing about this film. The fact that they can transport things with them that are very large add to the excitement. Well not fact since this is fictional and all but you know what I mean.

Acting wise Michael Rooker is always a pleasure to see and of course brings forth a good performance, the scene with him and Jackson may be my favorite. Speaking of Jackson you know of course that Samuel L. Jackson brings a little something to the role of the guy trying to kill off the Jumpers. Still I get the feeling he was there for a paycheck. Regardless I love watching him on the screen so I will say he was a plus. Still the scene stealer in my opinion was Jamie Bell who plays Griffin, a fellow Jumper who is hunting Jackson's character. From his accent to the way he really does not care about anyone else he does an excellent job. Of course we have our lead David played by Hayden Christenson who at times seem on in the role but at others off. Still although his performance is shaky at times he seemed like he had fun in the role. His girl played by Rachel Bilson seemed like she had the same problem so I don't know what that was about. Also I would like to mention that Teddy Dunn was great for the short time he was on screen as the bully.

Based on the book by Steven Gould the blame may lay within the writers circle, the film did not know what it wanted to be. Written by people who brought us Mr. & Mrs. Smith, Sherlock Holmes, Fight Club, The Dark Knight, Batman Begins, and the Blade film series I expected more. Of course the mix of three writers or whatever may have been the cause for the unevenness. Of course the director could be the problem since the unevenness could be mixed direction. Still it is hard to say that because this guy directed Go, Swingers [two of my favorite films ever], Mr. & Mrs. Smith, and The Bourne Identity, I guess it is a mix of everything.

Over all I did enjoy this film, much more than most people I did guess from what people I know said about the film. Perhaps that is why I liked the film since I went in with no expectations. Sure when it was first released I would have most likely not liked it but since I waited and heard things it saved the film for me. This is not a classic film but the idea behind it is a great premise. I think a sequel is coming and hopefully it surpasses the first film. I do recommend the film but a rental may be the best idea, you may like it.",1264118400,,4223,4.088057901085645
3402810,5,B00177Y9ZC,What an awesome movie! A great sci-fi that generates energy from the very beginning to the end. Overall this is a enjoyable movie.,1261785600,,130,4.695652173913044
3402811,3,B00177Y9ZC,"Don't get me wrong.  I enjoyed Hayden Christensen's performance in ""Life as a House.""  And I felt he gave a good, strong effort in Star Wars trilogy.  But I just feel he's not the appropriate actor for the lead role of David Rice, the jumper whom the movie revolves around.  The guy discovers his jumping ability as a teenager, and runs away from home, leading to an easy life of crime.  After setting up this background, the movie picks up on David eight years later.

If you pause and think about it, the character David Rice is an immature, small time crook who could basically go anywhere he wants to.  It's okay for him to steal to finance a lavish lifestyle, because he has that one-in-a-billion god-given talent to do it.  Life is easy for David Rice.  And I just think Christensen plays the David Rice role a bit too straight and narrow.  Rice is crafty, beguiling, the big easy, and Christensen does not role play Rice in that way.  Christensen has the good looks of a leading man for this film, but not the sly, charming, and shifty manner needed for this role.

Perhaps Leonardo DiCaprio can take over for a Jumper II film?",1261267200,,1134,4.478048780487805
3402812,3,B00177Y9ZC,My first blu Ray movie. I usually like time travel movies. So this movie is a great movie to watch. Good story line and concept.,1259971200,,128,4.16
3402813,3,B00177Y9ZC,"I rented and watched this movie off of Netflix recently, when I have asked people I know if they liked it most people either hadn't seen it or said it was just okay so I wasn't expecting much out of this. However I did actually enjoy this movie. It gets going pretty fast and keeps this pace through out the whole movie and at 88 minutes long its just the right length as to not get stale. Hayden Christensen plays David Rice who has the ability to Jump, Jumping in this movie is an ability some have that allows them to teleport to anywhere they have been before instantly. After learning of this ability David runs away from home and his alcoholic father to New York, where he robs a bank. David is living a wonderful life and all seems well until Samuel L. Jackson's character Roland Cox who is a member of a secret organization that hunts down and kills Jumpers known as The Paladins catches up with him. The rest of the movie is a globe trotting action extravagnaza as David must protect his childhood sweet heart from this vicious hunter, and teams up with an unstable Jumper Griffin played by jamie Bell.

  So all in all this movie was worth the rental, and I would encourage anyone who has not seen it to check it out. Christensen does a much better job in this movie than his boring performance in StarWars(although his evil scenes in StarWars were good), and the special effects, locations, and action sequences were pretty cool as well. I give this movie a 3 out of 5.",1257033600,,1480,4.413919413919414
3402814,4,B00177Y9ZC,"I remember really looking forward to Jumper when the teaser and initial previews came out. Then, suddenly, the movie was there in front of me on Blu-Ray, and to say I was only a little disappointed would be an understatement.

Rather than the big action ride I anticipated, Jumper is instead a showcase for digital effects, camera work, and the power of HD. The movie focuses on people called ""jumpers,"" who are able to teleport. The main character of the film, played by Anakin himself, does what most people would do if they found themselves given such great power: use it for his own gains.

Most people will claim if they could teleport they'd use it for good, but let's be honest: a majority of you would use it the same way David Rice does: teleporting to rob banks, but mostly just using it to travel the world instantaneously and fulfill his own cravings. Want Chinese from China? You got it. Want to surf in Fiji but also have a one-night stand in London? You got that, too.

Thankfully, the movie isn't just David Rice partaking in vices. Alongside the jumpers, there's a group known as the Paladins, which (if you've ever played any games or D&D) you can guess are religiously based. Led in the film by Samuel L Jackson, the Paladins make it their duty to extinguish the jumpers, believing only God should have the ability to be anywhere at once.

Throw in the clich girlfriend childhood love interest, and the stranger who seems bad at first but obviously ends up ""good,"" and you've got Jumper. It's an action film filled with great scenes and spectacular camerawork, but outside of SLJ there's little positive when it comes to performances (and even he seems to have phoned this one in), and even less positive when it comes to plot, development and a sense of closure at the end. There will obviously be a Jumper 2, so we'll have to see if they can do a better job with that one.

In terms of the Blu-Ray transfer, Jumper is one of the best discs yet in terms of visual quality. Coming in at 1080p with a 2.35:1 framed image, the film looks much, much better than the plot showcases. Colors are crisp, and several scenes look outright realistic. If you have an HDTV and don't mind the mindless action films from the 80s and earlier, give Jumper a try, if for no other reason to see how awesome films like Predator would have been with this quality of picture.

Everything else about Jumper is so-so. The audio is 5.1 but never too outstanding (or too poor), and the extras do the job but little above their requirement. Featured are obvious ones such as the making of the film (which I admit does do a better job than some), a look into the special effects process, and another look at adapting the novel into the film, which is my favorite piece. No matter what you take out of Jumper, it will likely make you interested in author Steven Gould's original book. Take solace in knowing the book is (like usual) much better than the film.

CONTENT: 2/5

Jumper is a popcorn flick, plain and simple. You won't talk about it after you watch it, and chances are you won't remember it two years from now. Watch it for some mindless entertainment, and expect nothing more. Sometimes, that's more than enough.

VIDEO: 5/5

One of the best Blu-Ray transfers I've seen. It stands up proud with Narnia and the other fantastic video achievements. Scenes look real, the effects are amazing, and the colors are perfect. If you want to show off Blu-Ray to friends or family, this is the disc to use.

AUDIO: 3/5

5.1 (which is the average these days), but nothing stands out. There's no real loud action, but nothing falters. The effects sound nice, and the music is decent, but, overall, Jumper's audio is completely middle of the road.

REPLAY: 1/5

If you watch movies with friends to go all MST3K style, this one has much higher replay. Alone, however, you'll watch it once then likely forget about it. Unless, of course, you want to marvel at the technical achievements on your HDTV.

EXTRAS: 3.5/5

The extras you'd expect from a big budget film. The most memorable is a look into the adaptation process, and that will hopefully lead more people to the book (and other books in the future!).

OVERALL: 3.5/5

As a movie itself, Jumper is probably only a 1.5 or a 2. With the Blu-Ray presentation, video, and others, however, it's a much better BRD than it is a movie. It's spectacular looking which makes the haphazard plot and shoddy acting bearable, and that's saying a lot for how nice the movie looks. If you have an HDTV, you may want to at least rent this just to see how nice it looks. Whether or not you buy, however, depends on your tolerance of mindless, poorly structured action movies.

3402816,4,B00177Y9ZC,"Jumper reminds me of a more hyper kinetic version of ""Highlander"" - at least in the storyline - where one individual who belongs to a special mutant race that has existed over time must now fight for lone survival in the modern world.  Substitute the swords with the teleportation, and throw in a bit of the stylised action from ""Wanted"" and you have a nice wham-bam film.  The trailer for Jumper made the film look more complicated than it really is.  It's actually an easy film to watch.

Hayden Christensen (admittedly not one of my favourites after Star Wars) - is very convincing in what could be his best role.  Samuel Jackson, as always - excels at whatever he's doing, and he's a bada** dude in this one.

The film succeeds in moving the action from scene to scene.  Less successful and less convincing is the attempt to inform us about the Jumper's origins and their nemesis - the Paladins.  Because the film is so contemporary and slick in its style, sometimes it's hard to buy into the theory of an ""age-old past.""

3402819,3,B00177Y9ZC,"With the plot of ""Jumper"" recapped several times throughout this Amazon review section, let's just ""jump"" right into my thoughts on this little bugger. Blink-and-it's-over movie, blink-and-it's-over review... appropriate no?  Anyway, away we go...

This fast-paced (but not ridiculously fast-paced as the trailer seemed to indicate) ""X-Men"" style adventure is worth a look for its solid premise, edgy characters, and exciting confrontations.  I especially liked the occasional nods in the direction of character complexity: Hayden Christensen's ""Jumper"" character maybe isn't the basically nice guy he initially seems to be and Sam Jackson's relentlessly hunting ""Paladin"" character maybe isn't really as bad as HE initially seems.  In other words, maybe Jackson's character is right and all past jumpers HAVE become rotten eggs- dangerous rotten eggs- after a while, and need to be put down.  Clearly much was left open for exploration in a sequel.

Strangely, some of that exploration could have been done in this very movie, as it's only an hour and twenty-nine minutes long.  Could it have killed 'em to give us ten more minutes of character material and background info to supplement the generous (and, admittedly, very well done) action sequences?  At an hour and 40 or 45 minutes, this movie would still have been lean and mean, but also a little richer.  Still, ""Jumper"" is worth a look for fans of super-powered characters and gritty adventure.

Yet... my 12 year old and I watched this. The plot... needed help so badly even she was scornful. It's one of those cases where the only reason the plot works at all is because the writers make all the characters uncommunicative morons, who get in situations solely because they're so stupid that you can't even feel sorry for them. We were too busy yelling at them to feel sorry for them.

Then there's the whole jumper-history and the lead's mother issue. Since the people pursuing the jumpers are not jumpers themselves, what are the odds that some one in a billion trait would show up in the kid of a hunter? Had they written it so they were all jumpers but on opposite sides, that might have had a chance.

To make matters worse, the one truly decent character in the show was apparently killed by the hero, or close enough (even that was not entirely clear), dashing the last ray of optimism we had for him or his worthiness. Before it was over we were genuinely hoping the hero would die a sudden and fiery death. Totally annoying.

But I love the whole concept this is based on. I feel like this COULD, potentially, have been an awesome movie. I would love to see more along these lines. It just doesn't seem like anybody with a brain was closely enough involved with it to have it come out less than embarrassing.

If your only interest is some cool effects in nice settings, have at it. It does have that, it's an ""action movie"" and I liked that part of it.

3. He uses this power to steal some things and make a good life for himself.

4. There come these people that (for some reason that is never explained) want to kill the Jumpers.

(This recalls the movie ""Hancock,"" where a conflict was made up for the point of the movie without any underlying explanation.) Or who was who and how they came to be who.

3402826,4,B00177Y9ZC,"Jumper is an action-adventure story about a man who can teleport from one location to another at will just by thinking about it.  The movie chronicles the life of this ""jumper"" from the day he learned of his ability while in school, through his exploits using his skills, to his final confrontation with his mother, who is a paladin; someone who hunts down and kills jumpers.  Our jumper is played by Hayden Christiansen, who puts in another fine job that again demonstrates he is a good actor, contrary to what George Lucas did to him to in the most recent Star Wars movies.  The Paladin who hunts him is played by Samuel Jackson, who I believe has played in one too many roles as a government agent.  This movie did not fare well at the theaters; unfortunately as it is very good.  The script is original, and the acting is decent.  All in all, a good watch.",1240876800,2,860,4.445859872611465

I thought it was entertaining and kind of cool to see what someone would do with this power. Some of the storyline is flimsy, like his quick falling-in-love with the heroine for no real reason, but Hayden does a nice job in the movie, as does Jamie Bell. Lots of great scenery (locations) and fight scenes, cool special effects. Definitely worth viewing, I've watched it several times and still like it.",1240272000,2,543,4.608247422680412

They definitely should not of cast Hayden Christensen, he is such a bad actor. They should of stuck with the younger kid at the start of the movie. David Rice in the book was a lot younger. They added the whole Paladin story which was none existent in the book also. I know movies never stick the the same plot as the book, but i just thought it could of been way better than it was. Don't get me wrong i still enjoyed it as a sci-fi flick.

3402836,3,B00177Y9ZC,"The movie itself flowed well and was visually appealing.  I had a few real issues with the movie.  First of all the main chacater is a Jumper who is able to go from place to place in the blink of the eye.  He seemed to have had this ability from childhood, but never realized it.  He is 15 before he knows he can move thru space.  My question is how did he get this power.  Turns out there are other Jumpers, no one questions this?  Than there are hunters of the Jumpers....who the heck are these guys and wehre did they come from.

It seemed for a brief second that there was a chance to make our Jumper a Super Hero, there is a scene with people drowing in a river the newscaster says they will need a miracle to survive.  The Jumper is watching on tv, does he go save them?  Turns out that the kid is a selfish young man who uses his powers to seduce the ladies and steal things.  Never once does he ask himself why he was given the power.

The other issue was the relationship with his childhood sweetheart.  She thinks he is dead than he walks back into her life and he sweeps her off her feet, no questions asked.  She plays a way to gulable character and comes off as unbelivable.

Take away all the negatives and the movie flowed well and was an easy movie to watch.  I will never see it again, but if there were a Jumpers 2, I would probably watch it.",1232928000,,1360,4.09469696969697

1) Guy (abandoned by mother at age 5) can teleport anywhere.
2) He robs banks and lives well.
3) He discovers another jumper and is pursued by a murderous group of ""jumper-killers"" called paladins.
4) He eludes the paladins, runs off with his high school sweetheart and discovers that his mother was one of the paladins.
Cue music. Wait for sequel. Egad.
There is so much stupidity here it's hard to know where to start. Here's a thought for good and bad guys alike -- buy a gun. The paladins use some kind of electrified harpoon gun and the jumpers....well...they just run. And jump. And run some more. Oh, and if you get the chance to kill someone who is actively hunting you and is willing to kill your familiy to find you -- kill them. Don't ""jump"" them somewhere and leave them alive.

A young man named David (a bewildered-looking Hayden Christensen) discovers he has the ability to ""jump"" (teleport) from one location to another--anywhere in the world.  So what does he do?  Um, rob banks to set up a cushy lifestyle so he can pick up chicks by night in London and have lunch on top of the Great Sphinx of Egypt.

Heaven forbid young David would do anything constructive with such an extraordinary gift. . .

But wait.  There's more.  David discovers he's not alone; there are other jumpers out there (and they're all young adults; go figure).  And these jumpers are being pursued by paladins--sanctimonious Bible thumpers devoted to kill all jumpers because (we suppose, as we're never really given an explanation) they are ""evil.""  The paladins are led by a white-haired, very devout Samuel L. Jackson.  So, bewildered-looking David teams up with a fellow jumper (Jamie Bell, who is a not-so-nice jumper) to battle Jackson and the paladins--and that's when the goofiness takes over to the point poor girlfriend's (Rachel Bilson) apartment is totally trashed.

Oh, and the electric ""ropes"" the paladins use to trap the jumpers so reminded me of plumbing snakes.  Just an observation.

Sam Jackson does the best with his material and is his usual intense self while delivering the goods as a baddie.  However, the film-makers seem to have been so worried about keeping the pace of the film tight (barely a 90 minute film) that some scenes that may explain stuff further are just missing.

The concept is fine, but the execution was sorely lacking.  There's no character development because so much time is covered over the course of the movie.  We get no insight into the main character's thoughts, motivations, or personality.  He comes off as shallow and two-dimensional.  He goes from scared kid to conscienceless, arrogant jerk in ten minutes.  There's never any question or delving into whether what he's doing is right or wrong (he's a thief, plain and simple) or how he could use his power for good instead of just wasting it.  Granted, who wouldn't want to gallivant about the world, carefree, I suppose, but the moral struggle would be very much a part of the character.

Unlike in Sliders, the Jumpers have full control over where they go and when.  Still, the TV show format of one or two jumps and an adventure per show would be far more entertaining than this jumbled, boring, barely explained plotline.  Then again, this would require character development and plot.

Even the pivotal plot point about the secret organization is boring, focusing on a religious inquisition instead of, oh, upholding the law.  Of all the trite and cheesy story lines (scientific experiments, military uses, etc) this is not only the tritest and cheesiest, but also the most yawn-inducing.

Even as a mindless action movie this one fails, unless your aim is to become a brain-dead zombie.  The greatest part of this movie was the end, simply because it meant it was over.

3402859,1,B00177Y9ZC,"Time-traveling, teleporting. I've been always kind of a sucker for these sci-fi premises. What would you do if you could teleport yourself to basically any place on the face of the earth? Steven Gould, in his novel Jumper, uses this premise and gives his characters the innate ability to instantly teleport themselves. It is definitely an interesting foundation, however, Director Doug Liman and screenwriters David S. Goyer, Jim Uhls and Simon Kinberg do little to exploit this promising idea, and come up with a movie that takes us through NYC, Rome, Egypt, Tokyo, but ends up going absolutely nowhere.

Hayden Christensen is David Rice, a normal teenager until he finds he's got the ability to teleport himself from place to place when he first ""jumps"" spontaneously in order to escape his abusive father (Michael Rooker). Having run away, he learns to control his ability and then does, I guess, what every one of us, being a teleporting teenager, would do: go into a bank's vault and get away with several thousands in cash. The good thing is that Jumpers do not have to worry about mingling their own molecules with a fly's, as they can actually hold onto anything: other people, cars, even parts of a building, and teleport to another place arriving safe and sound on the other side with whoever or whatever they were carrying.

David grows up and, by that time, he's already got a penthouse at a luxurious NY building and he's been all over the world. The usual day for him involves having breakfast on top of the Giza's Sphinx in Egypt, spending the afternoon surfing the best waves of the season in Hawaii or Fiji, and having a drink at a popular pub in London while checking out and hitting on the hot babes at night.

Yes, life is good for David, that is, until the bad guys appear. He learns that he is not the only one with that unusual gift and also learns that there is actually a group of people that hunt Jumpers for a living. Roland, played by Samuel L. Jackson, has been following David since he first broke in at his first bank. He is the leader of the Paladins, that particular group of individuals whose only goal in life seems to be killing all the Jumpers and, apparently, this war between Jumpers and Paladins has been going on for hundreds if not thousands of years.

But David doesn't look like he is the type of guy that'd enjoy messing up with other people's lives. Granted, he steals money, but then he is basically a good guy that likes to pamper himself and enjoy a low-profile, big-shot-like life and spend big amounts of money. I'd bet the IRS would nail him before The Paladins would. Ok yes, I guess with time David could get bored of all the indulgences and turn to the bad side; maybe teleport himself right into the Pentagon secret archives and steal some sensitive material and then try to sell it or just give it away to a terrorist organization. I haven't read the book, but I understand that, in the original Gould's novel, there is no Paladin organization and the villains (or at least the guys chasing David), are actually NSA agents who are trying to understand these powers and get them to ""good"" use. I think Roland says that he works for the NSA, which initially made sense to me, but then, this character turns out to be just an obsessed, fanatical hunter. This is where the movie starts going nowhere. We spend the rest of the time watching Roland following and fighting David, while he drags with him his love interest, Millie (Rachel Blison), around the world. Throw in the appearance of Griffin (Jamie Bell), another paranoid Jumper, and the brief and inexplicable appearance of David's mother (Diane Lane), who's a Paladin herself (!?), and we end up with this 88 minute mess.

There are so many inconsistencies in this movie that it is hard to follow. For instance, I really never bought or understood Roland. What's his motivation? Nobody knows. The movie doesn't stop to elaborate on this issue. Maybe he's jealous because he can't teleport himself, but, in any case, he seems to be pretty much settled as he can travel all over the world and it is obvious that he doesn't depend on commercial airlines schedules.

Roland utters at some point something like: ""God is the only one that should have those powers!"", and if you consider that the name Paladins has been associated with the highest officials of the Catholic Church, the religious connotation is inevitable. I assume that most religious people don't question what their religion says, they just comply. Liman and company are like that, they don't care. They don't give the Paladins a cause, they just let them hate the Jumpers so much, and then they give us Roland, an overzealous, inquisitorial-like priest whose religion states that its worst deadly sin is teleporting.

Roland is blind for mysterious reasons, but I'm not. If David's mother is a Paladin and she won't kill her own son, why not convince her to enlist David as a Paladin? Paladins can not ""jump"", so it might be helpful for them to have an actual jumper in the ranks. Why not convince David to partner with him and do something good for the entire human race, or just themselves? Can you imagine the possibilities? This is what saves this movie from the worst rating. I've spent myself quite some time thinking about these, and when movies make me think, I like them. Forget about having David teleporting medical supplies to a disaster stricken, inaccessible region, or having David rescue a bunch of people from the top of a burning building. How about being the world's most feared paparazzo? Jump into a celebrity's home, catch him or her off guard, and get away with some photos that could be sold to the tabloids for millions, or how about just establishing the world's fastest and most effective courier service?

3402863,2,B00177Y9ZC,"What if an average guy from Ann Arbor, Michigan discovers at age 15 that he has the ability to travel instantaneously to other locations?  How would he handle that ability?  Those questions are answered in ""Jumper,"" directed by Doug Liman.

""Jumper"" is based on an intriguing premise:  a person has the ability to teleport himself at will to anywhere in the world, whether it be just a few feet away in his apartment or thousands of miles across the globe.  Sounds like a quality belonging to a spandex-clad superhero more than an average Joe.  After all, Superman essentially has that ability because of his super-speed, and Superman dates back to 1938.

David Rice (Hayden Christensen) realizes he has this ""jumping"" ability when he almost drowns.  In a split second, he finds himself in the midst of bookshelves in the Ann Arbor Public Library along with enough water to destroy a third of the library's book collection.

With a cartoonishly mean father (Michael Rooker) and more than his share of teen angst, David decides to make for the big city, his teleportation talent the road to a whole new life.  But this invisible zipping from space to place doesn't come easily, as David practices teleportation in Central Park, slamming into trees while learning to fine tune his ability.

The beginning of ""Jumper"" is very intriguing, and the film promises an enjoyable ride.  But so much goes wrong along the way, the movie crumbles before our eyes.  Let's take the character of David.  Though he's not a traditional superhero, we've become conditioned to expect that a lad lucky enough to have unusual strengths will use them for good.  What does David do?  He breaks into bank vaults, steals huge sums of money, sets himself up in luxury apartments all over the world, picnics atop the Sphinx, surfboards in Fiji, hangs out, literally, from Big Ben in London, and picks up girls all over the world.  He's not exactly bettering mankind or combating evil.

The element of conflict that drives the film comes in the character of Roland (Samuel L. Jackson), a Paladin.  The Paladins are Jumper hunters.  Why?  Roland makes a brief comment that only God should have the right to be omnipresent.  Huh?  Is that it?  Yep.  For half the movie, David jumps from place to place to stay ahead of the Paladins, who want to capture him because of pseudo-religious self-righteousness.

Christensen is a likable actor and he succeeds in making us care about his David, even though the character is a shallow, pretty-boy hedonist.  I suppose the good will he engendered as young Anakin Skywalker has spilled over to this less interesting character.

Jackson mails in this performance.  His appearance with snow-white hair is a lot of fun, though his character is humorless.  We've seen the same from this actor before:  intense close-ups, slow, threatening delivery of dialogue, and attitude a mile wide.  His Paladin is a warrior, which allows for action and violence.  But wouldn't it be interesting if Jackson played the role more low-key, using psychological terror rather than physical force?

The film shines when we're introduced to Griffin (Jamie Bell, ""Billy Elliot""), a fellow Jumper David meets in Rome's Coliseum.  Griffin serves as the expositional mouthpiece of the film, informing David (and the audience) that David isn't the only Jumper in the world and providing back story about the Paladins' ongoing persecution of Jumpers.  Bell has enormous energy and a streetwise toughness that contrasts sharply with Cristensen's laid-back style.  Whenever Bell is on screen, he commands it.

The dutiful love interest of sorts is provided by the lovely Anna-Sophia Robb as Millie, an adolescent crush from David's hometown, whom he looks up years later and invites to accompany him to Rome.  What happened to ""Want to have a cup of coffee?""  As written, the role of Millie is meant to be serviceable eye candy, and Millie is swept up in the usual machinations of ""things beyond her control,"" becoming more involved in the plot than she should be.

A trilogy of writers are responsible for the final screenplay of ""Jumpers,"" which looks as if huge chunks are missing.  Things move too swiftly, even for a movie about a guy who can scoot from city to city in a millisecond.  Viewers are entitled to enough time to get to know the characters so that they care about what happens to them.  A quick dissolve, for instance, shows David going from 15 to 20-something, still living in the same dumpy hotel he came to years before.  Why is he still there when the cash he's stolen can surely allow him to afford better digs?  And why are the teleportation scenes so inconsistent?  Sometimes David whisks to another location with just a rush of air and a swooshing sound.  Other times, there is serious damage to concrete and floor tiles.

The locations are interesting, but seem to be there more as scenic backdrops to the story than as integral parts of it.  With the exception of the Rome sequence, those taking place in Cairo, Tokyo, Prague, and Mexico are intended to be impressive to audiences that have seen all these places many times over on screen.  They no longer carry the same impact.

Rated PG-13, ""Jumper"" uses an interesting premise, but takes all the wrong turns as it unfolds its tale, offering a movie experience long on special effects, short on meaty story and gripping characters.",1221955200,8,5388,4.884233737596472
3402864,3,B00177Y9ZC,"Like so many others I went into this not expecting to like it. I actually never intended to see it but for reasons I won't go into I found it at RedBox and gave it a chance. And I liked it. it wasn't perfect - not remotely - but it has a certain charm probably because of it's unrealized potential. It could have been great but fell just short. I see a few reasons for this but the main being 1) it was only about 90 minutes long. They should have given it that extra 30 minutes, turned it into a 2 hour movie and tied up a few loose ends and take us into reason number 2) character development. You want the relationship between David and Millie but you don't buy it as much as you should because it wasn't developed properly. Also, they attempted to make David not a bad guy - and I guess over all he wasn't - but they could have done better. The notes he left at the bank (which I missed upon first viewing due to the disk skipping) hinted that he was a guy with a conscience, and he never actually killed anyone like Griffin so that earns him brownie points as well, but they could have done better and showing just how ""different"" he was in regards to Roland's expectations of him. Now an extra 30 minutes to develop the story wouldn't have have perfected it. There were other scenes throughout that could have helped develop it as well but the extra time would have helped in some way. I know they mentioned possible sequels if it did well enough. The thing about leaving room for sequels is that while you may want to leave some questions unanswered to be answered in the sequel you can't leave EVERYTHING unanswered and I think this first attempt left a lot of things hanging, more than they should have. Still, despite these failings, I did enjoy and buy it. It's a fun movie and being a sci-fi/action/romance person, this fit my bill despite the weak presentation of plot. However I was grateful to the warning about the 2 disk edition since I've already got an iTunes copy.

Anakin Skywalker battles the forces of evil by using the force and ...Oh. Wait a minute. Wrong movie. Sorry `bout that. Well not truly sorry; just a tad peeved at this flick and how horribly it went astray.

It is true, however, that the grim Hayden Christiansen of the new&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars/dp/B00006HBUJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars</a>&nbsp;fame is the main character (David Rice), and he has some unique abilities: he can jump through space/time at will, breakfasting on top of the Sphinx in Egypt, jumping back to his New York flat for luncheon pizza, then heading out to surf in Hawaii that same day ...or even hour if he wished it. He learns he has this power during his high school years (the young David is played by Max Thieriot - see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Astronaut-Farmer/dp/B00005JPLE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Astronaut Farmer</a>) and nearly dies after falling through some thin river ice. He miraculously reappears in a local library, water and all, soaking book stacks. David was trying to retrieve a gift from the ice that he'd gotten for a girl he liked named Millie (Rachel Bilson), but he quickly learns that his jumping abilities make him something of a freak, and believes Millie would see him that way too. So he runs away and into the world.

Once out amongst the populace he learns how to steal, including jumping into bank vaults and taking as much money as he will. But this also gains him notice by a secret society of men known as Paladins (look up Palatine and you'll find interesting parallels). The head of this religious order is a man named Roland (Samuel L. Jackson,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Snakes-on-a-Plane/dp/B000JBXHQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Snakes on a Plane</a>), and his goal is to kill Jumpers (""No one but God should have these powers!"")

So the battle between Jumper and Paladin is set and interesting shots and gadgets dot the screen. And that's about it...

The biggest flaw with the film is that there's no set-up to it. We don't really know why Jumpers can do what they do (Genetic/<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Men/dp/B000HEVZ9E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Men</a>-like mutation? Alien DNA? Gods?). We also don't know who funds the Paladins with all of their travel, gadgets, and many, many members. I can guess that it might have been the Roman Catholic Church, but it's never even hinted at. If it was the church, then how did Roland get access to secret information, including bank vaults, police records, etc.?

With all of its story flaws, Jumpers does have some amazing CGI. Particularly, there was one scene where Roland is in the desert and a Jumper brings a double-decker London bus with him through a jump scar and tries to roll it on top of Roland. That was incredible and made my jaw drop.

But that was it. All style over any substance, Jumper was so weak along storylines that I didn't much care what happened to anyone in the film. The worst part is that the ending was obviously set up for a sequel. Maybe Mace Windu (Jackson's Star Wars character) could magically appear and wield 'The Force' to kill that off, too.",1220486400,,3343,5.467054263565892

3402873,3,B00177Y9ZC,"David Rice has a special gift - he can ""jump"" (teleport) himself from place to place.  He abruptly discovers his gift as a high school aged kid (Max Thieriot) escaping death-by-drowning from an icy river.  At first he doesn't believe what happened, but when he escapes the rath of his drunken father in the same manner, he decides it must be real.  This is his ticket out of this broken family (his mother left when he was 5) and this small go-no-where town.  But, a teen ager on the run in New York will have a tough time living without a job.  So, David hones his skills and finances his independence by robbing (jumping) banks.  The story skips forward to find our 25-year old hero, played now by Hayden Christensen (Anikan SkyWalker/Darth Vader in Star Wars II, III), extremely skilled in his jumping ability.  He's now a world wide playboy jumping to multiple countries and playing the field.  Enter our arch enemy the ""CIA"" operative Roland Cox (Samuel L. Jackson) bent on destroying all ""jumpers"" on earth and you have the backdrop for any graphic novel.  Throw in David's old high school flame Millie (Rachel Bilson) and an experienced loner ""jumper"" Griffin (Jamie Bell), and you have some unwilling team mates set against Roland.  What follows are some 100 jumps in multiple CGI executions covering some ""20 cities in 14 countries"" (Wikipedia).  The action is certainly there and the directing for these rapidly moving scenes was fairly tight.  The cinematography was very good and the CGI was woven nicely into the action.  The screen play was a little lacking, so the actors didn't have much to develop or shine, save Sam Jackson who always makes the best of what he's given.  But, at least the film keeps you interested as you're taken for a ride across the globe.  Don't look for any academy awards here, but this one might wet your pallet for a weekend do-you-have-a-movie-where-things-blow-up fix.  The end might leave you wanting the sequel, yet for others it may leave you wanting to know where the return envelop is.  For me, I had fun.",1219795200,3,2055,4.743661971830986

3402875,4,B00177Y9ZC,"Jumper is a surprisingly entertaining movie for the ""Superhero"" genre fans. Not that Hayden Christensen wears a funny suit or saves people, he just would fit in with X-Men's Kitty Pride like a brother. He's known as a Jumper, a person with the ability to transport to any place on Earth just by thinking of it in an instant. However, since the dawn of time, these jumpers are hunted by a group known as Paladins, led by Samuel L. Jackson (sporting some of the most metallic silver hair this side of Steve Martin) who for no other reason hunt and kill the Jumpers down due to only tradition and envy. So after a few years of robbing banks and traveling the globe, he finally is spotted, escapes back home to his old girlfriend, meets up with another Jumper, and takes on the baddies once and for all.

Now normally I scoff at today's CGI effects, but this time it was done right. Every jump looked very neat and it always was a cool guessing game to think for a split second as to where they'd end up. The action sequences are well played out and the storyline's quick, to the point, and doesn't tend to drag anywhere. Sure, Christensen's acting still could use a little ""jump"" itself, but seemed to fit with the character here & Jackson can still play the hated bad guy better than most of his acting equals.

In conclusion, Jumper is a fun eye-candy movie. A cool and somewhat original story that keeps you interested throughout. Recommended to most, really close to a must-buy for fantasy/comic-book fans. Jump to it!

3402876,2,B00177Y9ZC,"An interesting story, brought together by interesting talent, falls oddly short of expectations in this action movie with fantasy elements.
The stall is set out early, as an intro shows Hayden Christensen discovering his ability to teleport (jump) from place to place.  He indulges himself with his ability, leaving behind the love of his teen life and living in style, until he meets another Jumper, played by Jamie Bell.  They are tracked by the Paladin, a secret group led by Samuel Jackson who are hell bent on destroying Jumpers.  And that's really about it - and I don't mean that I am saving the rest of the plot to avoid writing spoilers - that really is about it, it really devolves into a `does-he-get-the-girl' movie at this point, winding up after a scant 84 minutes, seemingly in the middle of the story.  Why do the Paladin want to destroy Jumpers?  Will Christensen achieve his stated goal of destroying the oddly coiffured Jackson character?  What makes the Jumpers what they are?  How many are there?  Will Christensen's character ever come out of his permanent sulk?  All remain unanswered - presumably for the inevitable sequel.
Hayden Christensen does little here to dispel notions that his acting is on a par with your nearest oak tree, but Jamie Bell is interestingly edgy and has the benefit of the films few humorous moments.  Bilson looks terrific of course but really has little to do once the special effects starts, and Jackson is really only going through the motions.  None of this really matters with such thinly drawn characters, and the director smooths over the cracks with his efficient action scenes.  The movie does crackle along with innovative set pieces which pique the interest, ultimately however leaving you all the more unfulfilled at the (partly literally) cliffhanger ending.
Overall, you're left with the feeling that as much as there is to like, this would have been much better edited down to a 20 minute introduction to a much more interesting and complex film.  Wait for the next movie and watch it as a double bill.",1219190400,,2067,4.871428571428571

Not only that, taken things with him as he jumps from one location to another.  The concept of the marvel comics superhero teaming up was mentioned from one of the jumpers to the other.  So is the Jumper a superhero?  Actually when you think about it, He is one of the most power superhero ever written on paper.  None of the super hero's could hold him.  He is all powerful.  I love the concept.

There are two types of Jumpers, ones that kill, and others that don't.  But it seem all of them steal.  Money is no object as they can jump into any bank and take what they want.  Jump into any store and what they see is theirs.

I am just crazy about the concept.  The movie I thought was well done.  Doug Liman, the Director can be proud of a job well done.  Hayden Christensen was much more animated than Star Wars.  May God, he is an actor, can you believe it?

He risks his ""girlfriend's"" life for his selfish pleasure, he steals instead of working or doing good and by the end of the movie, he has not learned anything.  Samuel L. Jackson's character is just as poorly written and one-dimensional.

Hayden Christens with his piercing gaze  does a good job. But his jumper partner, with the Irish accent was both sick and snobbish. Although the movie does not explicitly reveal it Hayden does have a strong connection  with his father at home and his mother who had abandoned him long ago.

3402884,2,B00177Y9ZC,"In 1992, Steven Gould published his first novel, called _Jumper_, which was an immediate success and has remained popular since. In 2004, he published a sequel, _Reflex_, which, like many sequels, wasn't nearly as good -- though it wasn't really bad. Then, in 2007, as the long-awaited film version was underway, Gould rewrote the story more cinematically and published it as _Jumper: Griffin's Story_. You would think at least one of those would be the basis for the movie, right? Nope. Only a few points are carried over from the page to the screen: from the first book, the character's name and the fact that he robs a bank. (In the book, it was done in desperation because he was too young to get a job in the big city; in the film, he does it almost as a lark, just because he can.) From the sequel comes the notion that there exists a secret society of teleport-hunters who will stop at nothing to exterminate them. (In the book, no real reason is given for their murderous crusade; in the film, it's merely attributed to ""religious fanaticism,"" with no explanation of what's ""religious"" about it.) The plot, you should excuse the expression, jumps all over the place, painting David Rice as a not very sympathetic slacker with too much money. Hayden Christensen isn't very believable, being much too old for the role, and Samuel L. Jackson as the Bad Guy is painful to watch. Jamie Bell is somewhat better as the rather nihilistic Brit, Griffin, taken (sort of) from the third novel. And the character of David's mother, played by Diane Lane, makes no sense at all: She's a committed teleport-killer, but she's protecting her teleport son? But she still hasn't changed her mind about the necessity of wiping them out -- so she just wishes him luck? Gimme a break. This could have been a really good film, and it apparently took three screenwriters to ruin it.",1217376000,2,1866,4.692073170731708
3402885,3,B00177Y9ZC,"One is immediately drawn to the thrilling premise based on the eponymous&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stephen-Gould-novel/dp/0765357690/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stephen Gould novel</a>&nbsp;(with liberal dilutions to the story) about a young lad named David who can teleport himself. One then sees the star-studded crew behind this caper and is almost certain to savor it: the director of The Bourne Identity, and script writers of Fight Club, Batman Begins and Mr. and Mrs. Smith.

Yet, despite all that they ought to have had going for themselves, somehow these cooks managed to make a stunning scattershot mess of this sci-fi broth. They decided, I suppose, that a movie named Jumper would do well with a jumpy screenplay.  Why trouble yourself with exploring the socio-psychological ramifications of teleportation or some such meaningful effort, when you can opt for a wannabe-epic adventure targeted at the nose-pierced crowd?

Landscapes switch at 60,000 frames per second. Our hero has lunch in Rome only to digest it all while surfing in Fiji. You know how it works. The teleporting bits are fine, but how a puny little teenager who was chronically ragged by bullies at school learned to do all the funky stuff at will, goes a trifle unexplained.

Soon enough, our supra-hero discovers that his abilities have landed him in the persecuted half of an old historic war. Sigh. On one side are his band of teleporting buddies called Jumpers -- all mysteriously young and fit, one quite thoughtfully a British (where were the token black and Chinese buddies?). On the other side are efficient ""Paladins"" organized to demolish them. The chief Paladin is a self-same Samuel Jackson sporting a silver crew-cut.

Now, for some uncommon reason, David has a nice revealing collection of photographs at home. Snapshots of *all* the places in the world to which he ""jumps"". Which naturally aids our chief Paladin's search. But not before a romantic angle is tossed in as David takes his high-school girlfriend out to Rome for a swing -- they fly regular Northwest of course, despite the hunt on for his arrest at NSA level.

The plot holes are large enough for obese teleporters to jump through. Christensen, an actor chosen clearly to appeal to the younger Star Wars fans, would have done well to consider a repertoire of at least two facial expressions. The final 15 minutes or so have so much rammed into them, with pulse-pounding heavy metal music of course, that one wonders if the film was about to overrun its deadline and had to be chip-chopped in a rush.

The loud hints at the end suggest that there might be a Jumper II. Optimistic as that may be, one hopes they will rope in someone else to write, direct, act in, and score it. The theme and Stephen Gould surely deserve better.",1217203200,,2833,5.105831533477322

David eventually starts living the good life, simply by taking what's not his and traveling the world by using his supernatural powers.  The villian played by Samuel L. Jackson arrives mixing up his perfect world, and the character David soon realizes he is not the only jumper in the world.  And so the story goes on with David trying to save his girlfriend played by Rachel Bilson and to get away from Samuel L. Jackson's character.

I don't really have a character in this story that I truly liked.  But as for the movie as a whole, I thought it was fast paced, full of special effects, and looks like it would be a lot of fun to teleport (but not into water).

3402897,3,B00177Y9ZC,"Doug Liman seems to have done nothing but freefall since The Bourne Identity, which was five stars. Then he did Mr. and Mrs. Smith, (4 stars), and now he's done this wannabe (3 stars). I don't even want to know how the sequel is going to turn out, although it has the potential to be a whole lot better. Anyways, this movie has a great concept of teleportation, used in sort of a anti-hero and selfish manner. Add a girl that was better off out of the picture, and you have a somewhat entertaining disappointment.

Hayden Christensen, while no Oscar winner, isn't as bad most would have you believe, but on the other hand, you almost never see his true colors because they're hidden under boring, one-dimensional and whiny characters. And that's what this character is, boring, one-dimensional, whiny and just plain dumb. In fact, Jamie Bell's Griffin is a whole lot more exiting, experienced, has his act together, has no girlfriend dragging him down, and he's just plain cooler. A movie centered around that character would have made for a much more interesting movie. Hopefully, he'll be around in sequals as an ally.

But the main problem with the movie comes in the form of Samuel L. Jackson, who gets his revenge from Hayden kicking his butt in Star Wars, and in turn shocks everybody, and stabs them with a knife that probably has a deleted scene to explain its strange mysteriousness. Or maybe it's just bad filmmaking. Anyways, Sam Jackson and his group of Jumper killers are so over the top, Evil Knievel couldn't jump over it. Sam Jackson especially. He's just so evil, he's beyond evil, not believable, and again, over the top.

Then there's the ""twist"" of Diane Lane, which is not only disappointing but confusing. She's a bad guy? Now, any path they take with her character is going to be so muddled a Hummer couldn't get through it. Then there's the girlfriend, who seems pretty cardboard, and who I never could quite get into. She isn't bad lookin', but her character development seems rather predictable, and again, boring.

But for all those wrongs about this movie, there is also plenty of good ones. The prologue is interesting and does a good job setting up the character, although Hayden's narration does get annoying after the first time. Then there's the action. Ahhh yes, the action. The action is entertaining, interesting, and pretty darn cool. My personal favorite was when they brought the London bus to the Egyptian desert.

So overall, you have a excellent concept and tons of potential. Unfortunately, this potential doesn't formulate into much thanks to poor writing, bad characters, over the top bad guys, questionable casting, and way too many lulls, both intended or otherwise. I look forward to a sequel, where hopefully they'll make it an action film.

I've read about teleporting from a very early age, beginning with ""The Stars My Destination"" by Alfred Bester, featuring the teleporting anti-hero, Gulliver ""Gully"" Foyle. (I highly recommend this novel.) Since then, I have always been fascinated by the idea.  This movie is a great idealization of the power to teleport, or ""jaunte"" as it is described in Mr. Bester's book. The special effects are terrific and the world-wide locales are a feast for the eyes.

Despite what a previous reviewer stated, this movie has an interesting plot and the motivations behind the Paladins were easy to understand. Ultimate power usually corrupts absolutely. And Jumpers have what the Paladins consider ""power only God should have"".

The movie's ending suggests a possible sequel.

3402900,2,B00177Y9ZC,"`Jumper' could be the perfect manipulative teen movie fantasy.  Start with a boy who  faces a distant, but menacing father in a divorced family where the mother's been absent since his fifth birthday, a bully at school who keeps him from his dream girl, and we have all the makings of an escapist venue about someone who gets and tries to keep it all.

In an early confrontation, David Rice (Hayden Christensen) meets school bully Mike as he connects with Mike's girlfriend, Millie Harris (Rachel Bilser).  He's sharing a glass bubble snow scene with her when Mike confiscates it and throws it on a frozen river.  Predictably, David falls through the ice while retrieving it, and remarkably, Millie's rescue attempts don't have her joining him through the same ice; even more mysterious is how Dave gets transported to the local Ann Arbor Library before he can suffocate under a sheet of unbroken ice.

Now he's discovered magical powers that enable him to jump ahead short and long distances in hyper-cyber leaps with invisible traces.  If he can only hone it and use it at will, he can globe trot the world and use it at whim.  We not only go forward physically, but we do so in time frames as well with casual announcements of passing time.  (The movie does this--not the powers.)  Relationships would surely suffer, but not for him.  We see him elude his overbearing father, but his trek seems like a lonely one with no one he can share his gift.

His first act is to do mission impossible and rob an impenetrable bank.  In one of the movie's time warps, we leap ahead to David sitting in his upscale New York apartment.  Never mind that this kid who wouldn't have the credit history or employment record to justify his application.  Having forgotten Millie for some years, he's able to pick up a girl at a London pub just after hanging out on one of the four faces of Big Ben.  After enough fooling around, he decides he's grown lonesome for Millie, so he heads (I should say jumps) back to Ann Arbor years later where he finds she's supporting her college expenses as a bar maid.  Here he also meets a drunken Mike where the conversation turns as tipsy as his beer glass.  Again enamored by the contrast of brutish Mike to his civility and maybe a little more than impressed by David's ability to throttle his nemesis through powerful transport, Millie is his.  Not wanting to be peculiar in her eyes, David satisfies her desire to travel the world, using traditional money instead of his magical powers.

There has to be a catch.  After the bank robbery, NSA operative, Roland (Samuel L. Jackson) is hot on his trail and knowledgeable about the Jumpers.  Using an electrical device, Roland is able to stave off jumping powers by shocking the Jumper's brain waves.  Not able to transport, he nevertheless, uses photographs to unlock the path of his suspects' movements.  Labeled an Inquisition figure, Roland roars, ""Only God should have the power to be all places at all times.""  So instead of an investigative interest in the bank robbery, we get a jealous preacher.  If there's no consolation in the chase, then we're at least better informed when David locks heads with British fellow jumper, Griffin (Jamie Bell).

In many ways the movie goes nowhere.  The scenes where he moves ahead are done with genuine expressions by the actors, but the special effects draw attention to itself.  It's much more satisfying to watch the believable blur in a 'Bourne' movie.  The transport gets tiresome at times.  Credibility also takes a back seat.  Maybe he can jump to Maui, but does it automatically make him a champion surfer?  There are no good guys here (except for one sweet and innocent girl).  That may work for 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,' but not here.  Robbing a bank doesn't make our protagonist likable or gain our sympathies.  Without intending to do so, the film highlights much of sixties' science fiction which looked upon such advancements with a wary eye and undermined them with consequences.  (Okay, so this is more fantasy than anything else, but it's the same idea.)  I did like the mystery of David's mother (Diane Lane), but even that treatment is limited.

Following up his blockbuster action hit Mr. and Mrs. Smith, director Doug Liman turns to an entirely new genre -- sci-fi -- for this tale of an underground world of teleporters. Based on the novel by Steven Gould, Jumper concerns David (Hayden Christensen), a young man who quite literally wills himself away from his grim family life by teleporting to another place with the power of his mind. Years later, David is using his powers to raid bank vaults, seduce girls in London, lunch on the pyramids, and surf in Fiji. But he soon discovers that he is not the only one bestowed with this unique gift, and all is not well in the world of jumpers. There are people out there, such as Roland (Samuel L. Jackson), who view jumpers as a threat to all humankind, and have made it their mission in life to eliminate them. After jumping back to Michigan to get reacquainted with his long lost love, Millie (Rachel Bilson), David makes the acquaintance of experienced jumper Griffin (Jamie Bell). Informed by Griffin of a secret between jumpers and a shadowy group that seeks to destroy them, the pair soon finds themselves facing off against a legion of murderous opponents who won't stop fighting until every last jumper has been eliminated.",1215648000,,1502,5.310924369747899

The main character realizes that ""jump"" during a dire situation. Realizing that he has a great power he uses it to his advantage and illegally accumulates wealth, woman, and toys. He's drawn into a controversy that he was unware existed when he finds out that he is not alone, and that all ""Jumpers"" are hunted by the ""Paladins"" (lead by Samuel L. Jackson) The conflict between these two is the entire second half of the film. There is alot of shaky camera work during most of the action scenes, probably to facilitate the special effects.

Keep in mind I can't remember any of the characters names and that pretty much somes up the problem with this movie. The character development is lackluster and nothing about Jumpers are ever explained. All of that i guess is saved for the sequel that will never be released unless its straight to dvd. Thats the problem with setting up for a sequel in an unknown franchise that it may not become a franchise. I don't think Jumper will unless it goes the straight to dvd or tv route. Overall Jumper is an ok time, if you leave your brain at the door. The main character does bad things and doesn't use his powers for good and by the end of the movie he still is doing basically what he wants and it leads you to believe he is changing though. That change will come with the never to be released sequel. Sigh.

3402927,4,B00177Y9ZC,"I gave this movie an extra star because it is set in Ann Arbor (where I live) and has some footage of Huron High School and the Gallup Park around the Huron River.  Yeah, I know it is cheap of me, but I like seeing my home town on the screen.

The movie is about David Rice and his ability to teleport (jump) to anywhere in the world (but not through time).  He first becomes of this ability when, as a teenager, he falls through some ice on the river and is carried downstream with no way out through the ice.  As he learns to master this ability he engages of a variety of activities that stem from his troubled personality.  Max Thieriot does a terrific job as the bullied teenager and Hayden Christensen carries the movie as you young adult version of David.

Unfortunately for David, he isn't the only jumper and there is an organization of crazed folks who deem themselves authorized to find and kill any jumper they find.  They have all kinds of high tech tools to locate, contain, and a low tech knife to gut them.  These folks call themselves Paladins.  They have, according to the story, existed as long as there have been jumpers, but I wonder how they contained them without their gadgets?

For me, the handling of the Paladins is a real weakness in the movie.  We don't know their true motivation, their financing, or why they are so devoted to what they do.  They are just there and are just the enemy of jumpers.  Not really enough.  However, Samuel L. Jackson does a fine job Roland, the head Paladin.

The other problem with the story is that David is not a sympathetic character.  Of course, Hayden Christensen has already played one of those and handles this quite well.  I just didn't feel there was anyone in the movie to cheer for.  We side with David because the story tells us to, but we don't really like him or identify with him.  David's love object, Millie (because he really doesn't know her as a person, just as an idea he projected from himself - as most teenagers do) is the nicest person in the film, but never gets to become a full person here.

The film has made more than $200 million dollars worldwide so we will probably get a sequel of some kind.  I hope they flesh out the people rather than leaving them as two-dimensional figures.  But maybe that is enough for their target audience.

The movie takes us to lots of cities all over the world and that is a part of the fun.  But most of the time I wondered why the jumps went so far afield.  I know that some of it was an emotional response to a situation, but sometimes the jump could have been down the block for a similar effect to the problem at hand.  Maybe I am being too fussy.

3402928,3,B00177Y9ZC,"During the Summer I lighten up on movies since I know some of them won't win Academy Awards. That's because they are focused towards action and fun which the Academy usually frowns upon. With the exception of ""Lord of the Rings"" how often have you seen them give it to fun movies? Afterall ""Star Wars"" or ""Anger Management"" certainly weren't about to get one. So don't expect ""Jumpers"" to be anything more than it is, a fun action movie. Now I grant you I have a couple questions. Did his father survive? Who funded the Paladins? Where they really working for NSA? Why did his mother have a kid if jumping is genetic? If Paladins can jump, aren't they a jumper too? Okay I had more than a couple questions not being answered, but overall I liked the ride.

Some will say robbing banks or Paladins killing innocent people is setting a bad precedent for kids to watch. I agree. Have you thrown out your families ""Grand Theft Auto IV"" yet? Yeah right, so let's not be so judgemental on this movie. The main character is none other than Hayden Christensen of Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader fame. He does a decent job playing the part of a Jumper. Samuel Jackson unfortunately doesn't really get much opportunity to show his ability acting as one of the bloodthirsty Paladins. Worse yet, we barely see the lovely and talented Diane Lane.

The movie starts us with a boy saving his own life, by jumping to a library he knew as a child, when he falls in a icy lake. As the story evolves we find out Jumpers typically start jumping at age five. For some unknown reason we find that Paladins since medieval times have killed jumpers. Sorry this is one premise I couldn't accept. Paladins have always been portrayed as good and guarding religious people from harm. Convincing me this means they would kill people for jumping into a bank and robbing  it is stretching it thin. They would have been better off to just make the government in pursuit of them, specifically Homeland Security or NSA. Even then it would need to be if captured a Jumper would face imprisonment not death if they were guilty of lesser than capital crimes. Now that I got that out of my system, I still like the movie for the most part. The story wasn't bad, the acting decent, and the effects great. Not a bad Summer movie at all. Good quality DVD with decent replayability. - C. Luster",1214956800,,2349,4.535377358490566
3402929,3,B00177Y9ZC,"With all the talk I heard about this DVD, it seems that it might just be fans of Anikin Skywalker's just loving him being in another movie that I did not feel was as good as the hype being said about it.

Jumper is about a boy who one day discovers he can warp/teleport. He decides to use this power to take money from a few bank vaults and live a life of luxury. However his plan backfires when he finds out that he is not the only person who can do this trick. They are called Jumpers, and can warp to wherever they want to. He could be in New York city one minute and then warp straight to the Sphinx in Egypt.

While discovering he is not alone, he also finds out there are (some name for it) a group of people who want to kill them for having this ability to jump wherever they want to. The plot pretty much goes around him trying to stay alive while protecting his girlfriend and learning to be a jumper.

It sounds pretty cool when you hear the plot story, but I feel this movie could have been so much better then it is. I really did not like the idea that he just figures out he can do this, like it's genetics and he accidentally discovers he can warp. I know this is just a movie for entertainment, but even in a non fiction world, you want some sort of explanation to what causes this. I'd have bought into a magic ring, or an ancient crystal that gives them these powers, but to just have him figure it out like he was born with it just did not feel like it was the right way to give him these powers.

Also, they should have explored the fun you could have with such powers. It seems like he just decides to rob bank vaults, and uses it to warp to a few places... if you had that kind of power, the first thing that comes to mind is probably not rob a bank vault, you'd probably be testing it to see what you can do, and how much of it. There is plenty of things they could have tried to make it seem like someone who really did have this power and could do anything, there where so many possibilities they could have explored.

The battles between the jumpers and whatever they where did not seem to be thought out as well as it should. There is no explanation as to why jumpers are being killed, apart from jealousy from a religious type of hunter group.

So many possibilities where unexplored, and so many reasons and ""whys""
left unanswered.

Many people are saying this is an original concept. No it's not. This seems like they have taken ideas from ""Click"" and ""TimeCop"" and mixed it with a lot of concepts you see from b-grade horror movies and wrapped it up in a normal human being who is not from hell or has a thirst for blood.

It's just usually you see these warp things in demons, or evil, aliens or angels or gods or something, so it's not an original concept, just the idea to put it into someone normal, but far from original, as there have been movies made where a normal person can do this kind of thing.

Overall I think they could have done a much better job with this story wise. It came off feeling pretty average and so many questions left unanswered. And if that is a set up for a sequel, then this series has already failed for doing it on purpose before they know if the movie was a success or not... people aren't as stupid as the movie companies want them to be.

the extras seemed pretty boring. So I expect there holding back a few months before the release a special directors cut edition, which will fail the market as people either refuse to buy it, or copy it or download it... and the movie companies wonder why piracy is running rampart these days.

Overall, fans of Anikin will flock over this and praise it, no matter what he is in. but to the average viewer, this is a pretty average movie that could have been done so much better if it focused more on entertainment then the FX of the movie.

Unless it was some artistic endeavor that happened to step into the world of sci fi, it was scoffed at. That's okay though. While critics dismiss these films of fancy, fans follow them non stop. Such may be the case with this week's release, JUMPER.

Hayden Christensen stars as David Rice, a young man who comes from a dysfunctional home where mom took off when he was 5 and dad has clung more to the bottle than David. As he hits teen years, David discovers accidentally that he has a strange ability. David can transport himself from one location to another with the speed of thought.

Leaving home, David does what any normal male teen would do. He sets himself up in a cheap hotel and transports himself into a bank vault where he takes money that no one notices until months later. No security breach, no alarms, just missing money. The film progresses from there to David grown into a young man, still transporting from locale to locale, have lunch on the head of the Sphinx, appearing immediately in Paris or stepping out to shop in New York only to hit the stores in London. With the speed of thought, David appears.

All seems fine until someone appears in David's apartment. That someone is Roland (Samuel L. Jackson) who has shown up to take David down and has the ability (with the help of an electronically charged weapon). With a bit of luck and ingenuity, David escapes and returns to his boyhood home.

Once there, David decides to look up the love of his life, the girl who was there when this power first manifested and who hasn't seen him since believing he died, drowned when he was young. Millie (Rachel Bilson) has grown, works in a local bar and still captures David's heart. Taking a chance, he convinces Millie to leave with him to see Rome, a location she's always dreamed of seeing.

It is in Rome that David encounters Griffin (Jamie Bell), another ""jumper"" who enlightens David. It seems that Roland is the head of an organization called Paladins that have tracked down and killed ""jumpers"" from the beginning of time. Their goal is simple to exterminate.

Realizing he has put Millie in danger, David tries to escape Roland and his cohorts. But the chances of Millie and David making it out safely are slim to none, even with the reluctant aid of Griffin.

A final showdown, the appearance of David's mother and more highlight this action packed sci fi tale that offers hot locals, fantastic effects, great looking shots and a plausible story that features good guys and bad on the move. The film is not LAWRENCE OF ARABIA but then it never sets out to be that.

The jumping sequences are interesting, and the bad guys, the Paladins, have some interesting technology for their job. Paladins were responsible, we are told, for the Inquisition and witch hunts ...

One wonders how the Paladins did their job before they had this tech, because it would seem to be ... not at all, it being impossible to follow jumpers easily. So that doesn't make much sense. But it's still fun to watch. The protagonist's dad looks like a jerk at first, and perhaps he was, but you feel for him later.

3402935,2,B00177Y9ZC,"I really hate it when a movie that I was really excited about seeing ends up completely disappointing me once I finally get the opportunity to watch it. Such was the case with the recent release of ""Jumper"" from director Doug Liman (""The Bourne Identity"" and ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith""), starring Hayden Christensen, Samuel L. Jackson, Rachel Bilson, and Jamie Bell. The previews were entertaining, showcasing the film's impressive visual effects, and showing what turned out to be the best scenes from star Hayden Christensen's performance, in order to paint him in a much more positive light in regards to his less than stellar acting ability. Not surprising to me and many others was the fact that the film was universally panned by the majority of critics across the nation, yet I still wanted to see the movie, because I figured it would still be entertaining due to the fact that critics generally despise science-fiction, and well I generally disagree with them on that genre. Sadly, after watching the film, I now find myself having to say that I completely agree with the throng of critics that blasted the film, and I feel like I wasted 90 minutes of my life that I will never get back on what is possibly the worst film of 2008.

""Jumper"" is the story of David Rice (Hayden Christensen), a man who was bullied throughout his childhood and ends up leaving the love of his life, a girl named Millie (Rachel Bilson) to start over, and is now living the good life with all the wealth he could possibly imagine. He's a man who appears to have everything a person could ask for, except he's never had to work for any of it; instead, he uses his amazing ability to teleport from place to place taking anything and everything he wants for himself. David believes he is the only one of his kind until he meets another `jumper' named Griffin (Jamie Bell) who warns him of a group known as the Paladins, that are led by a mysterious and deadly man named Roland (Samuel L. Jackson), their goal is to find and eliminate all `jumpers' from the face of the Earth. Now, David finds himself stuck in the middle of a war he doesn't understand, with the fate of not only himself but everyone he cares about hanging in the balance.

While I was watching ""Jumper"" a couple of things went through my mind over the course of the film. First, is the extreme confusion in regards to why executives in Hollywood continue to believe that Hayden Christensen (best known for his work in the `Star Wars' prequels) is even a remotely decent actor? Lets face it the man cannot act, he was mediocre at best in his first starring role in the smash hit ""Star Wars - Episode 2: Attack of the Clones"" and seemed a little bit more comfortable and skilled in ""Star Wars - Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith""; however, even in those films (which are by far his best work to date) he was nothing to be all that impressed by as far as his acting talent was concerned. In the recent release ""Awake"" co-starring Jessica Alba, I thought Hayden had possibly improved his acting game to the point that he was finally an average movie star, but with his work in ""Jumper"" he quickly put that thought to rest, and firmly cemented himself in my mind as quite possibly the worst actor in all of Hollywood. Well, now that I've got that tirade out of the way I can continue on with what other thoughts occurred to me while I was watching this sub-par movie.

The next thing I wonder is why is it that good, sometimes even great actors lower their standards in order to star in drivel such as this. Veteran actor Samuel L. Jackson (`Star Wars' prequels) has made so many great movies throughout his career, along with a few stinkers along the way as any actor does from time to time, but why would he even be remotely interested in wasting his considerable talents on this movie is beyond me. The same goes for Diane Lane (""Untraceable"") who has gained more and more credibility as an actress in Hollywood throughout the last decade or so, but then she does a film like this, and you wonder if maybe she's starting to lose her ability to discern between good and bad movie roles. My only guess, and the only way that I figure these stars can keep their respect and reputations intact, is that they only made ""Jumper"" for the paycheck, which I would hope was a ridiculously large amount, otherwise the choice just doesn't make sense to me.

The story in ""Jumper"" began with some possibility of being interesting to me, but then things began to unravel when Hayden Christensen began speaking his lines as blandly as possible. Aside from that, the story quickly appeared to be too shallow to really draw me into this supposedly ancient war between `jumpers' and the zealous Paladins. I wanted more depth to be given to what drives the Paladins to hunt the `jumpers', explanation as to why the `jumpers' always seem to commit crime instead of using their ability for good, and most importantly what the writers were thinking when they chose to make the hero of the movie, Hayden's character David, into such an idiot and a weakling. I mean he's always getting caught, and whenever he gets into a fight he always gets his rear handed to him, that is until he teleports to achieve the upper hand, but in a fair fight he always loses, how are we supposed to root for someone like that. Not to mention the fact that when the other `jumpers' are caught by the Paladins they seem to have a much harder time of escaping, yet David escapes with relative ease by comparison, and his partner in crime, Griffin (Jamie Bell) even points out how stupid David is for getting caught all the time when he makes the statement, ""How is it you have survived this long?"" (or something along those lines). All in all, the story written by Simon Kinberg (""Mr. and Mrs. Smith""), who rewrote the film after two previous scripts from writers David S. Goyer (""Batman Begins"") and Jim Uhl (""Fight Club"") were rejected by the film's director Doug Liman, was full of so many holes and instances in the story where it seemed the audience was just supposed to fill in the gaps to make the movie make sense, that I wonder if there was a lot of content that had been edited out of the final film, and if a director's cut of ""Jumper"" would possibly make for a better movie experience, although I don't think I could sit through any more of Hayden's horrible acting in this film than I already have.

From a visual effects standpoint, ""Jumper"" is virtually flawless thanks to the extremely talented group at Weta Digital (""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer""). The teleportation sequences are fun, and at first are exciting to see; however, the film uses the effect so much that it becomes tiresome and each `jump' sequence looks and feels just like the last to where you don't look forward to seeing them anymore. Now, I've seen special effects be repeated within movies before (""bullet time"" in the critically acclaimed ""The Matrix""), but generally when an effect is used more than once something is done to make it feel different than the previous, and that just did not seem to be the case in ""Jumper"". I don't know if the increasingly bland feeling I had towards the film's over-reliance on the same effect was because of a lack of imagination on Weta's part (which I doubt, given their stellar work in the past) or a lack of imagination and/or creativity on behalf of director Doug Liman (which is where I'm more inclined to assign the blame for not only this, but the entire failure of this movie).

Overall, ""Jumper"" had the potential to be an extremely entertaining, science-fiction action adventure film; however, weak acting, an overly simplistic storyline, and visual effects that went from brilliant to boring brought this film quickly to its knees and left me feeling like I lost a couple of brain cells in the process of having to turn my brain off in order to even sit through the 90 minute run time for the film.

3402939,4,B00177Y9ZC,"The concept behind ""Jumper"" is simple.

""Jumpers"" possess the ability to transport from place to place in an instant, distance notwithstanding. Enter David Rice, and his discovery of his ability to immediately appear where ever he chooses. Leaving home at age 15, he sets down roots in New York, and borrows a little money to tide him over for a few years. Where do you go when the world is only a second, a blink, a thought away? What do you do when nothing is beyond your reach?

Six years passes, and as a young twentyish, stylish leaper, he learns the ugly truth. He is not alone. And someone is trying to kill him!

As long as there have been jumpers, there have been the hunters, the paladins. Armed with weapons that harness electricity to distract a jumpers' active brain power, the paladins track, trap, and kill any jumper within their grasp. David, after escaping from his New York apartment, leaps to his fathers' house and then shows up at a local pub where his almost girl friend works. Millie, surprised to seem David, travels to Rome where they see the sights, and face their own death match in the Colliseum.

There are many rules to jumping. No friends are safe. Trust no one. No family is safe. No lovers are safe. Keep one step ahead.

He learns the validity of each of the rules as he and Millie run from New York to Paris to Egypt and back. The chase scene is outstanding as action jumps back and forth in a stacatto esque rythymn. Gotta love the top of the Sphynx shots and the bus materializing in the desert outside of Cairo too. The special effects team truly achieved excellence in this production.

Cast-wise, Hayden Christiansen, Samuel L Jackson, and Jamie Bell are excellent in their roles. Hayden gives an aloof performance as David Rice, complete with the angst he portrays so well. Mr Jackson IS the hunter, and throughout the film, his intensity is consistant, giving the film the edge Christiansen leaps from for his fly by the seat of his pants character.

Technically, this is a film based on a series of novels by Steven Gould. If we look to other sources, Kitty Pryde of the New Mutants (X Men) exhibited a similar ability. The transporters of Star Trek served to advance the stories in a similar time frame. Regardless of the source, and the brilliance of the original work, the film does seem incomplete and the end is disappointing. Live to jump another day...unless a sequel offers a definite end to the eternal battle between Jumper and Bumper, don't bother.

Enjoy the film for the light moments, and the spectacular special effects.

Then read the books.

The first words you hear are ""Let me tell you about my day so far"" spoken by David Rice (Hayden Christensen), former average guy turned Jumper. And what's a jumper you ask, why it's a person who can instantaneously teleport themselves to anyplace in the world. They're here one second, gone the next.

David misuses his power as one might expect, like a kid in a candy shop he pops in and out of bank vaults with loads of money and begins to live the life of luxury beyond one's wildest dreams. That is until he encounters Griffin (Jamie Bell) another more experienced jumper who instructs David in the dangers of being ""different"" from others. He learns that jumpers are pursued by a group known as the Palladin, a sophisticated, zealous group that believes jumpers are an abomination and dedicated to hunting down and kills them as though it were some type of holy crusade.

The action gets fast and furious as David and Griffin teleport around the globe with the Palladin in hot pursuit. When David's girlfriend Millie (Rachel Bilson) becomes Palladin bait to draw the two out in the open Griffin's words ring truer than ever, ""Welcome to the war!""

Critique: The '08 film `Jumper' is a slick but not too original story that borrow heavily from the cult classic `Higlander' with a little `Matrix' thrown in to draw the attention of the sci-fi fans. While the special effects are quite good the storyline just doesn't seem to capture the imagination as the other two above mentioned films, the soundtrack is rather weak and uninspiring and Hayden Christensen is rather lackluster and unconvincing.

While walking on ice to retrieve a gift for Millie (Rachel Bilson) girl he likes, David falls through the ice. Trapped he desperately tries to break through and then, suddenly, finds himself in the library near his home. He discovers that by picturing where he wants to be he can jump almost from one instant to the next to that place. This gives him the license to escape and he takes it jumping all around the world, accumulating wealth by robbing banks (and leaving IOU's because, after all, he does PLAN on paying them back). He thinks he's alone in this ability until one day he meets another jumper (Jamie Bell)and discovers that they are being pursued by group called the Paladins led by Roland (Samuel L. Jackson) who is out to KILL all jumpers.
Suddenly Rice is on the run and Roland finds Rice's weakness in the form of Millie.

Well made by director Doug Liman (""The Bourne Conspiracy""), ""Jumper"" tries a bit too hard to add a dark edge to the film making it more than an entertaining popcorn flick. That's to Liman's credit but the film is best enjoyed as a science fiction action/adventure film. Based on the young adult novels by Steven Gould, ""Jumper"" has little to do with the novels beyond the basic premise. Liman reinvents it for his own purposes. The cast is quite good although I question the casting of Christiansen as Rice. Jamie Bell exudes the dark, troubled quality that Christiansen can only hint at.

The Blu-Ray disc looks extremely good with crisp images and rich colors that compliment the location shooting. The visuals are also pretty good as well (although some such as the fight on top of the Sphinx are obvious digital effects). Audio sounds terrific.

The Blu-Ray comes with some terrific extras that mirror the regular two disc edition (including the digital copy that evidently comes with that edition on the second disc something I have no use for but some folks might particularly if they watch movies on their mp3 player or ipod). Liman, his writer/producer Doug Kinburg and producer Lucas Foster provide an entertaining and informative commentary track. There's also a animated graphic story providing background on the character of Rice. We also get a number of featurettes that cover everything from adapting the novel (and the multiple changes that occurred) to the look of the film and visual effects.

""Jumper"" is a escapist popcorn movie and is enjoyable for that. ALthough Liman tries add depth to the story by giving Rice and other characters dark, tortured backgrounds he isn't able to make this more than that popcorn flick (whereas ""Iron Man"" managed to be both an enjoyable popcorn flick AND a serious flick about troubled Tony Stark). Enjoy it for what you see but don't expect Gould's novel and you'll find this film a diverting & entertaining way to spent 83 minutes.",1213747200,2,3201,4.889502762430939
3402949,4,B00177Y9ZC,"Having read a lot of reviews dismissing this film I rented it only to find that I was pleasantly surprised. Sure there were some elements that made the plot a little too neat and tidy (e.g. nearly omnipotent Paladins, Mom just happens to be a Paladin, no one ever ends up jumping into the middle of a mountain, etc). But if you're willing to take these contrivances and lock them in a box for the duration (and its a science fiction movie so I think you should be) then you will enjoy this film.

There was action, a little romance, an acceptible plot, and subtle and well executed effects. Jumper won't cure baldness or make you a better person. It will however provide a very nice distraction. So some summer evening break out the popcorn, suspend your disbelief and prepare to teleport into adventure.",1213747200,3,804,4.583333333333333

I rented it today and put it in my my PS3 60GB first release and made sure the software is up to date and all but it won't play its seen as a data disc with an unreadable format.  was curious to see if anyone has ran into this problem as well or if anyone might know of a fix for this.

If your looking for great acting or to analyze and pick apart the movie, than it's not for you. This movie is action packed through and through. The acting was decent, nothing to complain about. Like another reviewer stated it's not going to win an oscar, but will win a sequel, I 100% guarantee it.

If you feel in the mood to have your heart racing and just want to watch something exciting, than judge this movie for yourself.",1213660800,4,644,4.358333333333333
3402952,1,B00177Y9ZC,They took a great premise and made a sleeper out of it....I couldn't have been more disappointed. Dopey acting in a teeny bopper snooze flick.,1213660800,2,142,4.72
3402953,3,B00177Y9ZC,"I really wasn't expecting too much from this film, but I do admit that the premise intrigued me. I had not read the original novel that the film was based on, so I cannot rate how well the film adapted the book.

First off, let's talk about the real star of this movie; the special effects. They are quite good, although nothing we haven't seen before (remember the first time you saw the original Star Wars and Jurassic Park? - Wow!). Of course the film relies heavily on CGI and I'm sure green screen was extensively used, although I couldn't tell what was real and what was green screen (I can usually tell).

Second, I really liked the idea behind the whole story of the Jumpers and the Paladins. With such an interesting idea, one would have expected the story to go a little further than it did and delve deeper into the origins of both sides of the ""war"", but I got the feeling that this was just an ""introductory film"" that would lead to numerous sequels (it's Hollywood - what did you expect?). The film does indeed, leave the story WIDE open for sequels galore.

Finally, the acting was substandard in my opinion. I did like the Star Wars prequel films, but I never did like Hayden Christensen's performances. They were wooden, dull, and just plain uninteresting. The same goes for ""Jumper"". He is a good-looking and resonably fit individual and I'm sure that appeals to the young ladies and gives them incentive to go to the theaters, but his acting skills are just plain awful. He just doesn't have the acting skills to carry a lead role.

Racheal Bilson's (sorry if I spelled her name incorrectly) performance is just as bad as Christiansen's. Both actors deliver shallow performances and portray shallow characters. Sam Jackson was as good as he could be with the role he was given, but overall, I just wasn't able to establish an emotional connection with them and therefore really didn't care how things turned out for them.

To sum up, the story and special effects are pretty decent and will keep you entertained for a couple fo hours, but don't expect any riveting performances or thought-provoking commentary about the human condition. This movie is just a popcorn flick, but sometimes those kinds of movies can be fun.

This one is.",1213660800,2,2253,4.662468513853904
3402954,2,B00177Y9ZC,"Yet another movie that ended with everyone in the room being bored.  There were four of us watching this last weekend, and only 3 remained conscious until the end... of those 3 all of us kind of shrugged and one said ""well that was certainly another ho-hum movie.""

None of us had read the book or graphic novel that this was based off of.  Perhaps if we had then we would have enjoyed it more.  When the movie started up with the voice over I knew we were in trouble.  Very few ""good"" movies have VO's (Christmas Story is a good one, Trainspotting another.)  VO's generally tell you that ""we can't write a good script so we're going to have some guy tell you what you're supposed to know.""  I tried to ignore the VO and give the movie a chance... then we were treated to excellent actors forgetting to act.  They were all very stiff, wooden, and clichd.  Samuel L Jackson looked absolutely ridiculous with his white hair and tazer-club.  When the plot was supposed to shift into high gear... nothing was explained.  Okay so the bad guys were called ""Paladins"" and had been killing ""Jumpers"" since forever because they were too powerful.  Um... okay.  Too bad the ""Jumpers"" in this movie never really acted like good guys.  I didn't particularly care who lived or died... in fact I would have been much happier had they all died.

So let's forget about the lack of a good script, plot holes, and bad acting.  What about the SFX?  Some of them were quite good, and some of them were Sci-Fi channel special quality.  Some of it was ingenious and some of it was garbage, but there was little consistency to what we saw and when.  Sometimes when he jumped, the buildings shook and the walls cracked... other times he was able to hop all over the place without making a sound.

All I know is that by the time the final battle came around we were all ready for this to be over.  Jumper has been one in a long string of Yawn-worthy movies we have rented as of late.  I really wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  Sorry but it was just lacking in so many areas, and it wasn't even bad enough to be funny.",1213574400,6,2093,4.365284974093265
3402955,2,B00177Y9ZC,"As a film, Jumper just begs to be mindless fun, of which it had loads of potential to be.  However, Doug Liman's adaptation of Steven Gould's novel ends up being anything but, and is nowhere near as fun or enjoyable as it could have been.  Hayden Christensen broods his way all over the screen as David Rice, a man with the ability to teleport anywhere in the world just by thinking it.  He's pretty much enjoying life, until meeting fellow ""jumper"" Griffin (Jamie Bell) and learning that there has been a centuries long war between the jumpers and the Paladins, of which is Roland (a blonde haired Samuel L. Jackson) who will stop at nothing to put an end to David.  Christensen is just so stiff and unconvincing in the lead role that watching him becomes a plain bore.  In fact, the cast as a whole just comes off that way, including Jackson, and wasted roles for Diane Lane, Kristen Stewart, Tom Hulce, Michael Rooker, and Rachel Bilson as David's love interest.  Jamie Bell on the other hand is so good that the Amazon review stating that one will wish both he and Christensen had switched roles could not be further from the truth.  Liman's direction is frentic to be sure, but the special effects sequences are surprisingly disappointing to behold.  Considering Jumper's troubled production history, none of this really comes off as much of a surprise, but the potential was here to have an incredibly fun time that just gets basically wasted.  It isn't anything terrible, but Jumper definitely isn't anything to write home about either.",1213574400,,1543,4.749063670411985

The book showed many elements and much deeper character development, you felt sorry for the hero who had an understandable morality system.  The movie hero seemed to present might makes right with no redeeming characteristics.  Definitely a rental!",1213488000,3,426,4.971830985915493
3402957,3,B00177Y9ZC,"Jumper is about a young man that finds out that he has a special power when he's little. He leaves his father (Michael Rooker) and his best friend (Rachel Bilson) to go rob banks with his teleporting power and live alone.

  8 years later he finds her again and she agrees to go to Rome with him just like that. As if he's not lucky enough that a hot girl like Rachel Bilson is still single.

  While an agent played by Samuel L. Jackson wants to kill him just because ""only god should have this power"" he explains. A better explanation would have been ""because I'm one bad Motha....and the movie needed a villain"".

  Another Jumper ""well played by Billy Elliot's Jamie Bell"" follows Hayden's Jumper around because he's using him as bait. He hunts the Jumper killers and knows they are after Christensen. That's what I guess anyway since the movie never explains why he's following him.

  Jumper has a lot of energy and some nice locations and some cool moments. The script is thin though. It's a wannabe super hero movie and that's about it. I'd rather just see a teleporter movie with Alan Cummings as Night Crawler again.

  Jumper never explains how Jumpers become Jumpers. While Jackson's excuse for killing them just wasn't a good enough excuse. He says most Jumpers become bad and that only god should have this power ""one of his worse lines he has ever had to utter"". Yet not one Jumper we meet in the movie even seems evil.  They wanna teleport to other countries, rob banks with no one getting hurt and...surf.

  Plus for a Doug Liman (Go, Bourne Identity, Mr. and Mr.s Smith) movie it's totally disappointing. It makes even Mr. and Mr.s Smith look fantastic. I didn't even know he directed the movie until after I saw it. You'd think that someone less talented made it. I actually thought that he only produced it.",1213401600,2,1828,4.569230769230769
3402958,1,B00177Y9ZC,"This was the first Bluray movie I rented after getting my PS3, not sure why I went with this... nothing else was attractive and the name of this movie seemed interesting.  I set my expectations REALLY low, and this movie met them.

There was no real plot, no beginning and no ending it seemed.  This person just happened to be able to teleport.  In a matter of hours, he could control it.  Then out of no where, a group was trying to catch the teleporters and kill them, because the teleporters did the world harm.  But what did these teleporters do?  All this guy did was to steal some money.  Kind of petty to be killed by. Also, if you had this kind of power, wouldn't you try to do the world some good or really cause some major evil?

Anyways... no explanation whatsoever about how such teleporting phenomenon could happen... it just does.  If you make a scifi, at least support it with some wild facts.  If you choose not to explain anything, then make a worthwhile plot to engage the viewer.  This movie has nothing... maybe qualify as a teenage joke movie.

I agree effects are good.  But it was not really action packed or epic like that really shows off the bluray either.  Sadly amusing is how I might describe it.",1213401600,,1225,4.40625
3402959,3,B00177Y9ZC,"Now because this movie is coming from a novel (graphic novel?), perhaps there were things that the filmakers didn't want to tackle (and I can respect that), seeing that you might want to keep the integrity of the original source material going.

So, I don't really know if that's what was going on or...

Let me just get right down to it, but it just seems like a movie like this, would've had a LOT more fun going on with it.  I mean, when you see the Hayden Christensen character 'David' living in his terrific bachelor pad, it would've been sooo nice to see him actually getting it and seeing him buy all the stuff that's in it.  I mean, for a story like this, it's just as much as the journey as it is anything else.  It's like when someone wins the lottery, it's a cool thing to get to see them enjoy their winnings.

That, to me is what's missing with the movie Jumper.  I mean, here this character has the most incredible gift, and you never really see him use it for fun stuff.  I mean, like there's this part when he and the girl he's trying to impress are in Rome and then they are found to be trespassing and then the police arrive.  I mean, where in the screenplay could the David character NOT jump to save himself (and the girl)?  I mean, to see that kind of escape would've been sooo cool!  But then he allows himself to get arrested/detained which only serves as a plot device so that his mother (Diane Lane) can come to his rescue.

And the whole thing with the Paladins?  That seems kinda out there.  Because the people who are 'Jumpers' aren't really bad people.  If anything the Paladins seem like the bad guys because they want to kill these people who have this really cool ability--like maybe they're all suffering from 'Jumper Envy'.

Either way, I think the premise for Jumper was cool.  It's just the execution of the story, sorta left me cold.

I thought ""Timeline"" might've been the worst movie I'd ever seen, but after ""Jumper"" came along, I'm starting to look at Paul Walker as the savior of Hollywood.  Christensen is so horrendous, he singlehandedly ruined Star Wars. Even the ones he's not in.  He sucks that bad.  His acting style is comparable to an autistic block of wood with constipation.  The man simply cannot act, and yet he continues to get role after role.  Add to this the fact that the script of Jumper felt like it was written by a group of one-armed mongoloid chimps, and you have yourself a movie so ridiculously awful that many people walked out of the theater halfway through.  I stayed because I apparently have a morbid fascination with terrible movies (see aforementioned ""Timeline""), but I was so mad afterwards I wanted to smash Christensen in the face with a wok.

3402966,4,B00177Y9ZC,"I went into watching this movie with lowered expectations.  After all, this film didn't do all that well in theatres, and from information I had read/heard, the film itself was started and stopped and then restarted again with virtually everything about the film changing in the process.  Basically I expected it to be a bit of a train wreck that likely couldn't live up to the relatively neat promise of the main premise: the star character was someone that found he had the ability to teleport anywhere instantly.

Pleasantly enough the movie doesn't do a bad job in delivering a fun ride.  Sure enough, the star does have the ability to teleport anywhere but his ability comes with potential consequences as there are people who believe that no one should have the power and ability that he, or others like him, has and those people will stop at nothing to permanently stop 'jumpers'.

Hayden Christensen plays the lead role here with Samuel L. Jackson (with bright white hair) playing the leader of the opposing side.  Christensen does well enough in his role, and Samuel L. Jackson delivers a solid enough performance as well.  Add in reasonable performances from the supporting cast, mix with some action and adventure in the form of good vs. evil fight scenes set in exotic locations and you get a movie that does a reasonable job delivering on the responsibility of being entertaining.  No it's not academy award type stuff, but it's good enough.  Were half star ratings possible, it'd be 3.5 for me.  Without the half star rating system, I'm rounding up to 4 stars.

Picture on the Blu-ray disc looks quite nice.  The movie is relatively short, with a somewhat family friendly PG-13 rating which seems mostly related to the action and violence in the fight scenes (and perhaps a little related to a scene that finds the female lead stripping her shirt off...) Little or no objectionable language.

Turn your brain off a bit going in and you should find Jumper reasonably entertaining.  Certainly worth a viewing via rental, though thanks to a load of extras, the Blu-ray package isn't a bad purchase.",1213142400,5,2109,4.822222222222222

THE PLOT: David is a very wealthy and well-living man with a secret: he can pretty much jump to everywhere he wants to go. But one thing he doesn't know: An agency is looking for him, since he had robbed a bank at age 15. For 8 years they have been looking for him, and have been trying to take him down. He reunites with his sexy girlfriend Millie, who doesn't know that she's about to become entangled in the mystery as well.

WHO WILL LIKE IT? People who love these types of movies will like it for sure. Hayden Christiansen (sp?) gives a solid performance, as does Rachel Bilson. It's a movie that has lots of action, comedy, tragedy, everything you'd expect in a good movie.

WHO SHOULD SKIP IT? PROBLEMS? Predictability. You can probably guess how this one is gonna end from pretty early on.

OVERALL: A very enjoyable film, very fun, very tightly made and I think I may see this again sometime soon. Reccomended!",1213056000,2,1136,4.473429951690822
3402970,2,B00177Y9ZC,"There is little that can up your enjoyment of a terrible film like seeing it on an airplane. Having sat unbored through the execrable Mad Money on the way out to Seattle, I was actually looking forward to seeing this on the way home, knowing it was coming by having of course perused my Hemispheres free in-fight magazine on the trip out. I also had a quite mild desire to see it when it was in theaters.

Okay, so we begin with baby Darth Vader Hayden Christenson atop the pyramids, saying ""Once I was a normal person, a chump, just like you."" That's what I like, a movie that insults its audience right off the bat. Turns out Hayden [his character is David] was only a chump until he was 15, when he presented high school sweetheart Millie with a snow globe. The local bully takes it and throws it out onto the frozen river, and when Hayden goes out to retrieve it, he falls in. It's looking all Omen II for him, when suddenly he finds himself in the local library, which is when I discovered that all of this is taking place in Ann Arbor, where I lived from the ages of 18-30. Hayden's mother abandoned the family at five, and his father is a jerk, so he runs away, by bus [when you can teleport in style?] to NYC, where he soon uses his abilities to rob a bank. When next we see him, he's in his 20s and living in a swank apartment in New York, where he uses his abilities to even do such small things as reach a DVD cover that is a foot out of reach. Amazingly, for as physically lazy as he apparently is, he's quite fit.

In here we are also introduced to Samuel Jackson as Roland, who is a Paladin, a group of people who hunt and kill Jumpers [as the teleportees are known] because they are ""religious zealots"" who believe that ""Only God should have that power."" Sound like a flimsy excuse for a villain? Just asking.

For no specific reason, Hayden suddenly gets a jones to see his old high school sweetheart. I say move on with your life, Hayden, there are plenty of other fish in the sea, but he's been established as somewhat of softie, who stupidly leaves handwritten IOU's at the banks he steals from. Now, is he ever REALLY going to pay that money back? Anyway, he goes back to Ann Arbor and finds Millie working as a waitress. She has grown up to quite a hottie in the Avril Lavigne mold, all tight tanks and eye liner. Also there is the town bully, and they get in a fight before Hayden teleports him somewhere and satisfyingly freaks him way the hell out. Then he's back and offers Millie a spontaneous trip to Rome, where she's always wanted to go, and she says sure.

So they go to Rome--by airplane! Poor Hayden. That must have been a pain. Millie knows Hayden is lying about where all his money comes from, but is okay with a don't ask, don't tell policy. So after a few days they end up at the Coliseum, which has been Millie's ""Number One"" sight to see for ever [since that first magical viewing of Gladiator, perhaps?]. However, despite it being her top priority, they have wasted a few days in Rome before getting around to it, and arrive precisely at closing time. Hayden uses his powers to get her in after hours, whereupon he happens upon another Jumper, who warns him about a coming Paladin attack, which arrives post haste. Hayden is all stupid and getting zapped [the Paladins use these super tazers which supposedly inhibits a Jumper's ability to jump], while the other Jumper is doing the only sensible thing, and appearing behind one of the Paladins long enough to bash them with a baseball bat. Anyway, Hayden gets arrested, and various authorities, of both real and shadowy supernatural government agencies, are on his tail.
Around this time my traveling companion, who had been watching the movie as well, leaned over to me and said ""Does this movie make any sense at all?"" To which I had to reply that no, it did not. It's just this arbitrary conceit with these arbitrary rules [never fully articulated], for the sole purpose of staging fights and chases that range across numerous locations. These fights and chases are, however, pretty darn cool, once you get past the whole this-is-the-stupidest-thing-ever-set-to-celluloid barrier, and if you have elected to enhance your viewing through one of the many forms of available mind-altering substances, now is when you really want to let that stuff fly, because here's where the movie becomes a bit of a pip in spite of itself.

SPOILERS > > >
So turns out that Jackson and his Paladin cru are going to kill everyone Hayden cares about in order to get to him, which they demonstrate without harm to Hayden by killing his dad. Hayden has eight hours to kill Roland before Millie's plane back from Rome--alone--lands, which I thought was an okay excuse to give us a tight time frame, although the filmmakers blow it off almost immediately. Hayden suggests that he and Griffin, the other Jumper, team up, and after a while they do. Hayden goes to Millie's apartment, where Roland is in the process of sneaking into, and jumps with her to the jumper hideout. BUT! Roland has a special machine that ""detects recently-opened wormholes,"" and allows him to jump there, too! This leads to the first of a few of the cool fights that range throughout a bunch of locations around the world. Griffin also has the ability to jump with objects, so at one point Roland finds himself atop Mount Everest with a London double-decker bus suddenly bearing down on him from the sky. It's all amusingly cool, but you WILL have time to ask yourself why none of these idiotic jumpers don't simply buy a GUN, appear behind the Paladin, and clock them. I suppose somewhere on the DVD there's a bit about how despite the fights, public-threatening crashes, stabbing and electro-torture, they wanted to send a strong anti gun violence message.

For a rather cool finish, Hayden, who appears to be enmeshed in Roland's super-snare, relocates Millie's entire apartment into a river, and then into the Ann Arbor public library. He leaves Roland in a cave on a sheer cliff face.

There's a short coda, useful only in setting up a sequel [which I thought was ludicrous, until I read today that two sequels have been approved] in which we find out that Hayden's mother is a Paladin, and is going to come hunting for him at some point. Millie has fully adjusted to the jumper lifestyle and is just chillin' with her man. The end.

It's delightfully senseless, and doesn't even stick to the rules it establishes [when it makes the effort to establish rules, which isn't often], but all of this is trumped by the fact that those multi-location fights and chases are pretty cool.

True this is not a movie where the acting needs to be ""out of this world"" but he still does a good job. I think that Rachel Bilson although cute as a button cannot act at all.  She is weak and not a very strong personality in this movie. I cannot believe that this is the same director for Mr & Mrs Smith and the Bourne Identity.

This movie is not what the book was, though aspects of the second novel(other Jumpers, and people hunting Jumpers) did find there way into this movie.
  The movie is pretty fast and enjoyable, clocking in at only 88 minutes.  Compared to Spiderman at 121 minutes, and Superman Returns at a whopping 154 minutes......this movie moves.  Ultimately feeling more like a really awesome pilot for a show, than a completed work.
  Some of that is discussed briefly in the commentary track (reviewing 2 disk edition), in which they discuss having used only part of the story they'd outlined for this movie.  There are hopes on their part to ultimately have this as a trilogy.
  I enjoyed this movie, and I'd like to see two more movies set in this world. And for fans who liked the Jumping premise; I'd highly recommend you read the novels.  You will find completely new adventures with the same characters.",1212969600,3,1028,4.784090909090909

The greatest teleportation story ever written was authored by Alfred Bester (still only a book - nowwwww, that would be a movie!!!), and it was called, ""The Stars my Destination"".

The first teleportation story ever written was a short story called ""Dangerous Dimension"" by L. Ron Hubbard authored in the 40's.  Both ""Dangerous"" and ""Stars"" earn the hallowed mantle of ""CLASSIC"", and I will be terribly disappointed if the both of them don't make it to the Silver Screen sometime in the near future.

I went to see this one with my girlfriend, and we both enjoyed it. I'm not even a sci-fi nut; I think Blade Runner is boring and pointless. So, I'm not predisposed to like every sci-fi flick that comes out.

The movie revolves around a misfit kid with an abusive father and absent mother who learns he can teleport. It seems that his life will become a dream as a result of his abilities, but he soon finds himself hunted by merciless killers who are set out to destroy all jumpers. The conflict with a buddy makes for interesting plot twists, and the love interest is played by a uniquely intriguing actress.

No, this is all Hayden Christensen.  Why people in Hollywood continue to give him major roles when there are so many other male actors out there who are just as good if not better is just beyond me.

Could it be those dark overhanging eyebrows?  Seen from a certain angle, it makes him look like a brooding Calvin Klein male model, which is probably what he should be doing for a living instead of pretending to act.  Seen from other angles, however, it makes him look positively early-Neanderthal.

As for the rest of the movie, Bleccchhh.  Rachel Bilson couldn't act either and there was absolutely no chemistry between them.

The strangest part of the movie is that the younger high school versions of these two characters - Max Theriot and AnnaSophia Robb, were far more attractive, sympathetic actors, who actually looked like they could act.  Rachel Bilson doesn't look or act anything like AnnaSophia Robb and it was quite jarring to see her all of a sudden introduced as the older version of the same character.  It would have been far more interesting to have let the two younger actors continue as older versions of themselves for the rest of the movie.

There are SO MANY plot holes in this movie.  Here's just one:  Early in the movie, David Rice picks up this incredibly beautiful blonde in a bar in England.  And then he leaves her, still in bed, for his old girlfriend from high school, who by this time is no longer the beautiful AnnaSophia Robb but has turned into the much plainer and whinier Rachel Bilson.

The terrible reviews this film received prior to it's release didn't dissuade me in the least because everyone has different opinions. I found Jumper to be well made, with excellent visual effects and great worldly locations. The actors looked good and did well with what they were given. It's insane action sequences are followed by some slower 'talky' moments, that move the film along through to it's short end, with what looks like a sequel set-up. I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel that touches on some backstory of the 'jumpers' and 'paladins'.

The romance was sweet and short, with an amazing twist at the end.  It did feel like there was something small missing at the end and made me realize they probably will make a second movie (which I hope never comes).  Jumper is perfect the way it is.  I could be wrong a second could be great.  I just don't want something to ruin this one.

I truly cant believe what the ratings on here are...  This is one of my top ten favorite movies of all time!  Most of my friends agree and loved it.  Comedy, Sci-fi, Romance, and action all not going too far.

Then, one day, he soon discovers that he can teleport.  Upon discovery, he abandons his lonely life and makes a comfortable life for himself.  However, there's a secret organization of hitmen that seeks to eliminate jumpers (teleporters) because they believe that only God should have this ability.

The ""cat and mouse"" game is interesting.  The escape from the Paladin hitmen forces David to seek help from another jumper and Millie, his high school crush, whom he hasn't seen in years.

While a fascinating movie, the story isn't quite perfect.  There's just too many loose ends, leaving you wonder how did such things start or end.  It looks like a sequel is possible.  If so, hopefully, we'll get some answers.",1209254400,2,986,4.7976190476190474

I feel as though he is given a bad rap when, well, in star wars he was kind of supposed to be a whiny teenager and in jumper he was supposed to be a dumb kid.

I felt the movie was quite entertaining. Period. Alot of people felt they wasted their time with the movie talking about how some things didn't make sense and how these people didn't explain themselves enough blah blah blah. Bottom line, it's a movie meant to entertain. I'm baffled by these people on here trash talking the movie when clearly we all know that Samuel L. Jackson doesn't do a whole lot of top shelf movies.

3402985,4,B00177Y9ZC,"I went to see Jumper  with some of my family when it was released, and I have to say I enjoyed it very much. I've liked Hayden Christensen since I saw ""Life as a House,"" and Samuel L. just rips up a villain role like nobody's business. The special effects were very well done and I was delighted to find that the main storyline they implied in the commercials is NOT what happened! Sure, the main character can teleport, but the rest.... The movie is billed as scifi/thriller type, but that's a bit misleading. This is more like the Highlander films, a fantasy element in the real world.

The movie was pretty fast paced with only a couple slower moments, and the character's self-exploration once he discovers the ability was almost as good as Peter Parker's in the first Spider-Man movie. Actually, in one way it was better. Peter uses his power to win a wrestling match and then jumps right into the hero role. Our similarly-aged jumper, however, jumps right into a bank vault, and a store, and...! *grin* He really is an ordinary person with an extraordinary ability.  He used his ability for theft, but also for taking his surfboard to Fiji for the best waves.  I liked the movie enough that I quickly ordered the book.  They are COMPLETELY different, but both good for different reasons.  The movie added a opposing force for jumpers (i.e. a ""villain"") whereas in the book, David mostly battles his own inner demons (with a lot of introspection).  Plus, the very cool character of Griffin was completely made-up for the film.  His character adds great action while giving viewers another jumper to identify with besides David.  Though the movie had closure, they left it wide open for a sequel that I really hope gets made.

I think some viewers were overly critical of this film.  It's not going to win any oscars, but I was entertained and that's the most important criteria.

As to the DVD itself, I have to say, do NOT buy the 2-disc edition.  The second disk contains only a digital copy.  All the extras are on disc one, which the regular edition has!  I really wish the product description had been more clear on this.  I wouldn't have paid the additional $6 for a digital copy which you have to use a keycode to transfer.  The code is located on a card in the case, but it clearly states to be careful not to lose it.  Also, the outer sleeve has a holographic image of the cover art that is glued to the front of the sleeve.  I don't see it lasting long.  Finally, once again the studio includes ads in the case, but no insert with chapter index and extra features.

The extra features were pretty standard.  There's commentary, making of, interviews with the authors/producer etc, book to film featurette, and some deleted scenes (all of which I felt were rightly cut from the film).  The interviews were interesting sinc ethey touched on how the producer obviously changed the book, and how the author felt.  Nothing spectacular here, but for a single disc edition these were perfectly fine - and far more than they offered with ""the Bourne Ultimatium"".",1208995200,150,3069,4.619926199261992

The directing by Doug Liman, as well as the pulse-pounding score by John Powell (both worked together on Bourne Identity and Mr. and Mrs. Smith) help deliver the thrills non-stop. My only major complaint was that as soon as you begin to get to know the characters and get interested in the story, it's over. The movie climax felt like it should have been the half-way point from which more rising action and a grand finale could be built upon. Despite this, however, great music, great action, great effects, and not-so-bad acting make for a pretty decent flick. I'll be watching this again.",1208131200,3,907,5.013245033112582

One thing I liked is that violence was very low, allowing the movie to be seen by a general public.  I've seen some comments about the acting, but I found very interesting the way Hayden Christensen performed his roll.  There was some kind of a mysterious look on his face with little expression, revealing that there is some kind of uncomforting secret he is hiding and a power like that; you just can't tell anyone.  He looks like he wishes to be honest with everyone but then he knows it is dangerous, so he needs to hide it from the people he cares about; it's not easy.  His roll was managed in a very mysterious way, which in my opinion gave a very special touch to the movie.

Jackson are again in sci-fi action, Christensen this time as `jumper' who has the power to teleport and Jackson as `paladin' who hunts the jumpers, believing that only God should have that power. The plot is thin (and there are lots of plot holes) or the back story is almost non-existent, but these things are not the only flaws in ""Jumper"" which could have been a more entertaining film.

For whatever happens to our hero Christensen plays, we just don't care. We simply need more interesting character that can carry the whole film to the end. Actually the film's premise is not bad. Some viewers would find him a selfish guy, stealing money from the bank and living lazily, ignoring the news report on the people in trouble, and here the film makes an interesting point - not everyone would behave like Spider-man given a chance to use superpower. His reference to comic books when he asks another jumper (played by Jamie Bell) to help suggests that the filmmakers are aware of that aspect.

But except the jumper Jamie Bell plays (and he is much more interesting than Christensen), none of the characters have been developed enough to draw our attention to the film's world. Rachel Bilson is there to constantly ask the hero what is going on, but nothing more is required. Michael Rooker and Diane Lane, both real professionals, look bored. Visual effects are OK and various locations (especially Rome) are joy to see, but they alone would not make up for the bland hero who refuses to interest us.

And the hero refuses to learn anything from the past experiences. He doesn't know how to defend himself when paladins show up and he puts his girlfriend in danger more than once. Probably that's why Jamie Bell's jumper, who is smart and knows how to survive, is more interesting.

Obviously working below his pay-grade here, Samuel L. Jackson plays Roland, the leader of a group of religious fanatics who, believing only God should have the power to be in more than one place at a time, roam the earth seeking out and destroying all the jumpers they can get their hands on.

Essentially a travelogue masquerading as a thriller, ""Jumper"" takes a reasonably promising premise and turns it into inane wish-fulfillment drivel.  There are more holes in the plot than there are wormholes for the jumpers to pass through, and the final action sequences border on the incoherent.  The movie mistakes hectic activity for excitement and leaves most of its earnest performers stranded high and dry with little to do but play second fiddle to all the hyper-kinetic visuals and special effects going on around them (the gifted Diane Lane, in particular, is woefully wasted as the mother who abandoned David when he was five).  Ah well, at least they got a few all-expenses-paid trips to some of the world's most prestigious locales as compensation.

Indeed, the one redeeming grace is that the movie takes us to a number of highly photogenic tourist spots around the globe, from the Empire State Building to the pyramids at Giza to, most memorably, the Coliseum in Rome.

What movie did these bozos go see?

What we saw was a rollercoaster ride of a movie that felt fresh and exciting. C'mon, man! Sam Jackson, baby! He was cool as the paladin leader with Anakin Skywalker as the jumper. (We actually liked the european bad boy jumper somewhat better! Good actor.)

JUMPER had loads of mystery and action/adventure excitement - as well as a huge surprising ending - that will leave you wanting more. Liman yet again proves he is a top-notch director. We loved his original Bourne movie. The first beat the other two by leaps and bounds! (The last one was a total bore fest!)

And then, with Mr. and Mrs. Smith he took the comedy/action genre and sent it through the stratosphere! Although Jumper isn't as great as that last film, it is still WAY better than most junk coming out these days, all geared towards teens.

Sure Jumper leaves open questions at th end. There are several books out in this series, and Hollywood loves a sequel. And we want one!

And we'll bet every reviewer who gave this movie bad marks would go see it too! One way or another.

Sure the movie had its problems, but director Doug Liman handles the movie in a quick pacing with loads of beautiful special effects, great action sequences that were very original and huge in scope.

""Jumper"" is a good movie that will appeal to science fiction lovers, comic book junkies and anybody who's ever wanted to travel the world without blowing their bank account.  The story is simple, the special effects and international sets are amazing, and the acting is ... well you can't have anything.  The young actors here are given very few lines to work with and might not meet the high standards of those who want every movie, including an action fantasy movie, to have award worthy acting.

Many people will have to wonder what I wondered when I first read the reviews here: did I see the same movie as everybody else?  Why has this movie been panned by so many people?

I appreciate great acting, but I didn't expect Indiana Jones to win for best actor.  I likewise didn't expect too much from this acting-wise. Hayden Christensen may not the most expressive actor, but the kid is young!  Be realistic!  Actually, Bilson's portrayal as Millie was much less impressive, an overly flirty one-dimensional take.  And Samuel L. Jackson was almost getting paid twice for the role he played in ""Unbreakable,"" except here his character has the weapons and the strength to really fight the heroes.

Many people also seem to want more back-story and explainations for the science behind his ability to teleport.  Yet don't the backstories in most movies like this make them even less believable?  How often in life do people stop in the middle of something to explain how and why everything is happening?  I was glad that they didn't waste time trying to explain a work of imagination.  This is a science fiction concept, nothing more.

This movie, when viewed as just a movie, is great entertainment and very fun to watch.  Coming into this just as a movie-goer with no preconceived notions, I loved it.  I could suspend disbelief because I know how to let my imagination go when it comes to science fiction.

Essentially, Hayden Christensen plays a young kid who is bullied at school and harassed by an alcoholic father.  He discovers his ability to teleport, and soon is making a new life for himself teleporting all over the world.  He soon discovers he's not the only ""Jumper"" out there, and that a group of paladins are determined to find and kill jumpers.  He returns to his hometown to find his high school crush, and has to deal with telling her his secret ability.

The pacing was really well done.  This movie moves along very quickly.  It may leave a lot of unanswered questions but it also never leaves you dragging.  The score is well done, but there could have been more songs to create a real soundtrack.  They make up for it by moving from location to location with amazing cinematography.

And let me tell you, the sets are amazing!  The camera work on top of Big Ben, at the Sphinx, on the Pyramids, and on and on, it was all amazing.  For those wide shots alone it's worth seeing in the theatres.  I was so jealous this guy could go wherever he wanted, from Europe to Africa to Asia.  I can't wait for the DVD to find out which locations were shot on set and which were created via CGI or some other means.

Other special effects are impressive as well, as we see the ""residue"" of the jumper's as they teleport.  The paladins also have their own tools which are perhaps not as cool. There's also an amazing couple of fight scenes that are peppered in.

The movie does end very quickly, and is clearly based on a plot designed for sequels.  That leaves the story with a lot of loose ends.  Still, I for one would gladly subject myself to a sequel, even look forward to one.

If you want realism, going to see a fantasy thriller isn't going to give it to you.  If you want fun and love science fiction or comics, this movie is fun to watch.

3402992,1,B00177Y9ZC,"Starring Hayden Christiansen as teleporter David Rice and Samuel L. Jackson as the NSA Specialist charged with finding and stopping all of David's breed, ""Jumper"" makes so many Bad Movie mistakes that it's impossible to know where to begin describing it - or to recommend it.

Across the board, it's definitely one of the most underdeveloped films I've ever sat through: clearly, the cast isn't going to be putting on Shakespeare anytime soon (Christiansen, Jamie Bell and the horrific Avril Lavigne clone that plays the whiney, ungrateful ""love"" interest Millie all give dreadfully hammy, two-dimensional performances, and Samuel L Jackson overacts like Faye Dunaway with a wire hanger), and the basic plot is just that: very, very basic (good guy triumphs over school bullies and dissatisfactory home life, goes on to triumph over evil governmental agency, leaves end WIIIIDE OPEN for many sequels). The script could have been written in crayons by a three-year-old (and not a bright three-year old, at that), and it's full of boring dialogue and uninteresting clich. And the direction, for the most part, reflects the cast and the script: it's not memorable, and it's not entertaining.

So why, when 90% of the movie's elements are either badly put-together (the introduction of the adult Millie is just one scene where this movie looks and feels like a malformed cross between ""The O.C."" and ""Charmed""), did the director not keep the audience focused on the one area where this movie excels: action? The special effect sequences, at least on the big screen, are interesting, and some of the action scenes are very exciting.

But before you know it, those good parts are over - and for a movie whose plot centres on action, there's not very many of them to begin with - and we're once more thrust back into the mess of bad acting, bad scripting and boring story that make up the majority of ""Jumper"".

Personally, this would have worked better as a film about knitwear.... ...but whatever. If you have to see this one, see it in theatres: it needs a big screen to be impressive. Do not waste your money on the DVD: ""Jumper"" does action well, but since the majority of the movie contains no action, you'll only be wasting the better part of $20 for a futile exercise in uninteresting human interest and some pancake-flat dialogue.

One day, when trying to give her a gift, the local bully intervenes and tosses the gift into a frozen river.  When attempting to recover the gift, David falls through and is trapped.  At least, he is until he teleports into the middle of the Ann Arbor library.  Everyone believes him to be dead, and he sees it as a chance to start over.  He hones his skills as well.  To get some money, he robs a bank, and that is when NSA agent Roland (Jackson) notices him.  Roland doesn't like ""jumpers.""  As an adult, David (Christensen) lives a good life.  He returns home to see Millie (Bilson), and she notices that something is different about him.  He also finds out he is not alone.  There are other ""jumpers"" that are being hunted by ""paladins"" whose only desire is to kill them.  When Roland finds David, David is in for the fight of his life, because Roland is out for blood.

""Jumper"" is an interesting idea that is poorly executed.  Christensen has proven himself to be a wooden actor, and this is no exception.  He is a poor choice for David.  The action and the effects are top notch.  The origin story is well told, and I'm not a fan of origin stories.  The powers and the war between jumpers and paladins is left vague enough to make you want more.  The biggest problem with the movie (aside from Christensen's acting) is the fact that the movie doesn't end so much as it just stops.  The last five minutes leave a nasty taste in your mouth as David confronts one of the bad guys and is given a head start.  He decides to take a leisurely direction even though he is still the hunted.  Clearly, ""Jumper"" is set up for a sequel, but when that sequel is not a given, a movie needs to provide some closure.  This is one to wait for on DVD.",1203984000,7,1811,4.340298507462687
3402994,2,B00177Y9ZC,"In JUMPERS, the viewer is asked to believe that the hero (Hayden Christianson) has the power to teleport himself instantly to any point in the world merely by thinking of doing so. Now I have no problem with the underlying concept of this or any other science fiction story, but regardless of the improbability of the plot, I expect the script to respect the intelligence of the viewer or at least his memory by not violating previously accepted facts in the film.  In JUMPERS, the script fails on both counts.

What we are expected to believe is that a race of teleporters called ""Jumpers"" has existed for millenia and that a second group called ""Paladins"" exists only to kill them. Now if this sounds like a rehash of HIGHLANDERS I can accept that but at least with HIGHLANDERS there was a history and a plausible explanation given for the need to kill the immortals. Here, the Paladins led by a one note Samuel Jackson are a group of religious fanatics whose only justification for the killing is that ""Only God should have the power to be everywhere at once.""  The plot revolves around a montage of visual escapes that takes the Jumpers and the pursuing Paladins through the Sphinx, Mount Everest, the Coloseum in Rome, Hong Kong, the North Pole and so many other well-known locations that the viewer has difficulty grasping how that particular jump spot fits into the film's plot in any meaningful way.  The answer. of course, is that it does not and that is why viewer interest and film credibility is soon lost.  Further, the acting is second rate. Diane Lane is wasted in a walk on as Christianson's mother and her explanation of who her son is makes less sense than who she is. The bottom line is that JUMPERS jumps over too many places for the viewer to take even a remote interest.",1203811200,,1792,4.605015673981192
3402995,3,B00177Y9ZC,"It has an interesting idea. Some people can teleport by just thinking about it! They don't need any special equipment! The special effects are spectacular. However, the fighting scenes flashes so quickly it's hard to see. There's a big twist at the end when the main character found out who was one of his enemies.

It's worth watching once for curiosity.",1203465600,3,355,4.819672131147541
