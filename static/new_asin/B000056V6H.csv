1400877,3,B000056V6H,"i recently bought a dvd player and made a list of my favorite movies i wanted to buy. on that list was the blair witch project. having not seen blair witch 2 , i thought this would be a good deal. i was wrong. the blair witch 2 is the worst movie i have seen in quite some time . ( i have reviewed the movie on amazon.com ) . it is pointless . i expected it to elaborate on what happened in the first movie or at least have a stand alone story. blair witch 2 has neither.
the two movies in this package are the same movies you can purcahse seperately , no new or different features.  the features included on blair witch 2 are pointless as the movie is not worth watching , the extras are also a waste of time.
i give the set 3 stars. i expected something different in this package deal besides what was already released on the first blair witch dvd.
if you liked the blair witch movie , i suggest you buy it alone , not in this box set . you gain nothing of interest by purchasing the boxed set.",985305600,2,996,3.98
1400878,5,B000056V6H,"This edition of both movies and the sci-fi special is outstanding too bad they didn't include the special that aired called Shadow of the Blair Witch it explained where the sequel was coming from. If you missed it I think you probably missed the whole point of the sequel.* Possible spoiler material.  Jeff Donovans character is only supposed to be the actor who is playing the part of the real teenager who went insane on pot and alcohol and other substances with his camp group.  Another possiblity with this picture is that Jeff Donovans character is insane and imagining all that takes place while inside the mental ward. I like this idea and it is supported by the video footage of his character in Burkitsville talking on his porch and the movie version where he says ""they won't stop in Burkitsville ever"".  I like the idea of this twist and to me a good film leaves enough open for interpretation.  Stand strong Joe Berlinger you did a decent job.  No matter what you made it would  have been reemed in the media.  Thumbs up the commentary is most enlightening.  Buy it.",985219200,,1078,4.607329842931938

1400923,3,B000056V6H,"THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT was an interesting independent film that really had an innovative idea. However that idea fizzled after about 20 minutes into it for a few reasons. This was due mainly to the very obnoxious behavior of the would-be adventurers who set out on this supposed ghost hunt. These adolescents use four letter words in such a preponderance of pseudo intellectual ineptitude that I was hopping that they would all just vanish without a trace. They are the crudest, asinine and most repugnant characters I have seen in film for some time. Are we really supposed to care what happens to them? This is a film aimed at the teenage market. Are parents supposed to let their children be exposed to this offensive material? This film could have been presented without the use of the four lettered words, but I suppose the filmmakers would find that not politically correct. That was then. Looking back, I see some good film techniques that make it unique. It captured a certain look and it actually reminded me of Dudleytown, which is a ghost town in Cornwall, Connecticut. I was there three times when the public could walk through. To its credit, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJRCT did capture something that was definitely a bit unsettling walking through the forest that is now Dudleytown. BLAIR WITCH 2: BOOK OF SHADOWS makes me ask a question. Is this really a sequel? I thought the original was nothing that special. The main characters were so insensitive with their self assured arrogance I do not see how anyone could have cared what happened to them. So why make a sequel. However it does not even look like a sequel. It looks more like a spin-off of a mediocre TV show, a very strained effort to come up with a second film. Just change the channel please.",1381104000,,1764,4.693548387096774
1400924,4,B000056V6H,"These movies are classic. It was so great to get to share both of them with my little brother and introduce him to the movie that started the ""interactive P.O.V."" horror movies.",1355097600,,177,4.5625
1400925,5,B000056V6H,"Did I see the same movie as everyone who so casually trashes Blair Witch 2?  Okay, so it began a little erratic
and strange, but once it got going, I was glued to the TV.  I found it suspenseful and dramatic.  To me, it was
a study in human madness; how a group of people can experience something together so markedly weird that they
slowly descend into insanity.
I wasn't a huge fan of the original Blair Witch.  I didn't find it as scary as everyone else.  I found it to be
very...anticlimactic.  They kept trying to build up suspense over and over, but very little actually happened!  I
was actually bored by Blair Witch by the very end.
Not so with part two.  I found it eerie and unsettling, and when the truth of what actually happened came out in
the end, I was blown away.
Maybe I'm a minority of one, but I recommend B.W. 2 wholeheartedly.",1294790400,,848,4.289308176100629

1400927,4,B000056V6H,I have to also disagree with those who thought this movie stunk. This was not done to be a sequel to the original which was about the most boring hour and a half I ever spent at the movies. This film was meant to entertain and boy does it deliver. I thought it was a fresh take on an urban legends and how people perceive the witch which was never seen in either movie. This is a solid stab at the modern horror movie.,1225843200,,418,3.988095238095238

It was the first movie with all special features and everything and the second movie, and the pc games.  And a neckless for such a low price I was amazed.  The Blair Witch Project might be one of the greatest horror movies ever.  I thought Book of shadows: Blair Witch 2 was also a great movie, you just have to look at it as a film based loosly on the events and the movie release of the first film.  You cant look at it as a sequel.  I have not played the pc games yet but am told they are good also.",1185753600,,704,3.8811188811188813

It is very interesting, and it provides insight and facts about the movie and how it was really made. As for the sequel, it wasn't all that bad, nor was it that great either.

1400960,1,B000056V6H,"As I sat through this movie, I wondered: WHAT were they thinking? The first movie was so original and so creepy, yet the second movie resorted to using tired old stereotypical characters - the goth chick, the crazy guy, the misunderstood wiccan - and none of those characters came across in a realistic way. The characters in this movie were so one-dimensional that it was painful to watch. It was almost as if they wanted to release SOMETHING, as fast as they could, in order to capitalize on the success of the first movie, that they didn't care about the quality of their work.",1139356800,4,580,4.586538461538462

BW2 I love the most its chee-z and bloody and just fantastic.
I had the pleasure to see it at a press screening and let me tell you as soon as Mansons Disposable Teens came blaring on the shuffling sound of about 50 journalists writng their disapproval was laugh out loud funny!!!!!
Some of them were actually holding their ears this coming from supposed liberal minded people in a big city!!!!

1400963,2,B000056V6H,"""The Blair Witch Project"" is not a beautiful or profound movie; it is a really scary and entertaining one.
I like horror movies and I've seen dozens of them, by great directors (Murnau, Dreyer, Mamoulian, Browning, Tourneur, Murakami, Polanski, Kubrick etc.), uneven directors (Carpenter, Corman, Craven, Hooper, Raimi, Romero etc.), and bad directors (the vast majority - including of course Stephen King the film maker). Often those which we lazily categorize as ""great horror movies"" are not meant to be simply horror-genre movies: they often are psychological, even psychoanalytical, thrillers (think of Jacques Tourneur and Stanley Kubrick), social satires (Roman Polanski), fantasies (Haruki Murakami),  allegories etc. However horror-genre movies are primarily (and often exclusively) meant to be scary entertainments; as such, I think ""BW1"" is a pretty good movie (as such, worthy of 4 stars). Quite the opposite is true of ""BW2"", which is an awful mess, a boring, ridiculous, poorly written, shot and acted trash-movie (0 stars - I abhor it). Avoid it.",1096934400,2,1061,5.469512195121951
1400964,2,B000056V6H,"What type of moron decided, ""Hey! Let's make a 'sequel"" to the BWP,"" is probably the question on everyone's mind. I have the answer. STUPIDITY. I bet every person who went and saw the first movie went and saw the second one just out of morbid curiosity to see if it explained ANYTHING. I am guilty of this. My figuring was, ""Hell, it can't get much worse than the first one..."" Oh, was I wrong. The whole premise of the movie was this guy has this ""tour"" of the woods where the Blair Witch kids ""died."" The main characters are, The tour guy, the documentary couple, the wiccan, and of course there had to be a goth chick. What did you expect? Anyway. These people go shopping for booze and food and tromp into the woods and nothing really happens...or so they thought. This should have been my first clue to up and leave. Then out of nowhere the girl in the ""couple"" has a miscarriage and they rush to the hospital and she starts seeing this little girl. Oh. Yeah. They also got their equipment damaged and then found the tapes where the other tapes were in the ground. Sorry. After that, they go back to the tour guys house and that's where it gets ""scary."" Weird stuff starts happening, the girl in the couple starts going insane and they just happen to find that on the tapes they find some missing hours where they killed the people on the other tour and, I dunno, had some orgy-ish magic ritual? So. The wiccan goes missing and blah blah blah. In the end they thought the girl in the couple was the Blair Witch or something and kill her and then they get taken to jail and then come to find that they killed her when she was ""sane"" and that they also killed the Wiccan. The goth chick ends up killing the manager of the store, ""Peggy."" They all go to jail. The End. Moral? Kiddies, this is what happens when you sucker into stupid movies like The Blair Witch Project.

1400965,3,B000056V6H,"Bought this set mainly to get Blair Witch in Widescreen format. The description here said it was. Unfortunately, when it arrived, only the Blair Witch 2 was in Widescreen. Blair Witch was in Fullscreen. Still scary though.",1068681600,3,222,5.027027027027027
1400966,4,B000056V6H,"I found this set in the bargain bin.  It was inexpensive enough, so I bought it, being a fan of the original Blair Witch Project (and also coming from Orlando, like the film-makers), and having no idea what the sequel was like -- other than most people said it stank up the joint.
The set is a mixed bag.  Despite some genuine hackle-raising moments (when the video camera is hunting in the dark and we hear, for God's sake LAUGHING CHILDREN in the woods), the original Blair Witch is uneven, with the improvised dialog occasionally backfiring.  There are moments when the spell breaks and we can tell that the actors are self-consciously going for moments, rather than remaining immersed in their characters. But these are quibbles.  The Blair Witch Project remains a stunning acheivement if for no other reason than its sheer audacity.  The nerve of these guys, Myreck and Sanchez.  The chutzpah.  I admire it.
Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows is almost a good movie, and probably would have been, were it not for idiot studio bean-counters A) rushing the production (soup to nuts in ONE year), and B) interfering with the creative process.  Listen to director Joe Berlinger's somewhat pained commentary track and you'll understand what I mean.  His intent (which probably would have worked), was to go for a subversive, darkly satiric take on the so-called ""Blair Witch phenomenon"" and its subsequent backlash, while at the same time making a genuine psychological thriller on the nature of evil (human? occult? a mixture of both? he wanted it ambiguous).
Alas, while creative people and thoughtful film-goers like philosophical ambiguity, studio bosses don't.  So they made him dumb it down.  Berlinger is a gifted documentarian who should have been allowed, for his first feature film, to exercise his creative muscles in the realm of a fictional narrative.  As it stands, a lot of carefully modulated effects are placed out of their original sequence.  Only a viewing of his original cut would tell us if they would have worked better as originally conceived, but as it stands, Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows, is a noble ruin -- a film with some very good ideas that are not allowed to get very far.  It's a shame.
The DVDs are chock-full of extras, including some nifty puzzles and creepy, hidden images.  Overall, it's worth the purchase, if only as a cautionary tale to other would-be film-makers -- be they from Orlando, Florida, or anywhere else.",1065225600,8,2455,4.881927710843374

maybe with the third film coming out, they'll head my advice when they release it on dvd.
the ultimate bw exp needs to come out that includes the following:
1.) the blair witch project, the burkittsville 7 and curse of the BW on one or two dvds and all the other HBO and Sci-Fi tie-ins that made this unreal reality so exhillerating. the side shows (no pun intended) are great support for the reality that Myrick and Snchez were trying to convey.

2.) BW2, the shadow of the blair witch, and the scooby-doo project on this dvd. one good spoof deserves another. the magic is exposed so why not enjoy the kamp.
3.)BW3 and all it's follies
4.) the josh mix cd
5.) the BW2 cd (including Burwell's soundtrack)

1401005,4,B000056V6H,"Whatever your feelings about Book of Shadows, you have to admit that the guys behind the Blair Witch phenomenon are very good marketers.  This box set is a terrific value.  I already owned the Blair Witch Project on VHS, so I would probably never have purchased the DVD; in terms of the sequel, I was hesitant about going for the DVD rather than the VHS version based on the reviews I had read.  I would never have bought the computer games.  Thanks to this package, I now have all of the above (along with a trivial but not uncool stickman necklace).  If you are any kind of Blair Witch fan, you need to buy this set.
As for the original Blair Witch disc, its main attraction is the movie commentary.  Despite the fact that there are half a dozen or more people doing the commentary, it is very interesting, and it provides you with some insight and facts about the movie and how it was really made (you even find out what Heather was seeing when the trio ran away from the tent screaming that one night).  Sadly, you won't find any extra scenes included here than were available on the VHS version; this is doubly disappointing because the commentators make comments on a number of occasions about cut scenes they hoped would make it on the DVD).
As for the sequel, it wasn't all that bad.  It wasn't all that great either.  As the movie started, I thought that it could turn out to be a pretty good story; that promise faded as the movie progressed.  One thing that annoyed me was the fact that the movie took place, for the most part, inside of one building.  The characters headed out into the woods on a Blair Witch tour, but we never see those woods during the second half of the movie.  Just before the movie ended, I got that old feeling that says ""I hope they don't end the movie at this point in the story,"" and--of course--that is what immediately happened.  Still, it's very watchable and far from horrible.  You do get a bonus with the Book of Shadows DVD; the flip side of the disc contains four songs along with the score from the movie in regular CD format.
