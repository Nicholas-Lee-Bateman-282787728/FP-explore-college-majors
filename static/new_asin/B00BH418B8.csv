8568396,5,B00BH418B8,"I saw 'Hiawatha' as a kid when it originally came out in the 50s....though somewhat stilted the images of real life people still speak to me....though seen originally through a child's eye it still retains it's sincere message of peace....the last scene showing Hiawatha and others leaving on a peace mission to other tribes will forever live on in my mind's eye....thank you for issuing this film on DVD....

8568400,4,B00BH418B8,"I have been waiting for this movie to be released on DVD for decades. This is because the beautiful young Indian woman played by Yvette Dugay is my mother. I watched this film when I was very, very young and now that I have teenage daughters, I have wanted to get a copy for them to remember their grandmother when she was 17. Thank you for making the film available.",1381622400,2,367,4.257142857142857
8568401,3,B00BH418B8,"This movie was made around 1952; and therefore, it is rather simple.  I think it might be a good all round family movie; and much better for kids to see than today's films.  It is totally about the Indians; and their ways.",1376092800,,222,4.261904761904762

8568403,4,B00BH418B8,"Let me help you figure out what this item is since it is hard to tell from the listing, especially without a picture. This is a Rankin Bass animated cartoon, (but not one of their ""Animagic"" stop motion features). It was one of the 30 minute episodes of the Festival of Family Classics that Rankin Bass Productions made for television broadcast on ABC in 1972-73. Rankin Bass made the many great holiday classics we all remember such as Frosty and Rudolph. If you are a fan of their films you will enjoy this great series very much.

Some of the 18 episodes were very much part of Americana with tales from fact and fiction such as Tom Sawyer, the Ballad of Paul Bunyan, Yankee Doodle, Johnny Appleseed, and Hiawatha. The other episodes in the series include classic literature and famous fables: Swiss Family Robinson, Cinderella, Puss `n Boots, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Robinson Crusoe, Alice in Wonderland, A Christmas Tree, The Arabian Nights, Robin Hood, and two double length episodes - Around the World in 80 Days, and 20,000 Leagues Below the Sea.

VERSIONS TO LOOK FOR - The label Prism Entertainment or Video Craft International released these episodes as possibly the first vhs release in a clamshell package as a set of two episodes per vhs tape. For example JackO'Lantern and Yankee Doodle were on one tape. I am unsure of the year of this release since it is not listed on package or tape. These are very good quality video, sound and packaging, and the art on the box is authentic from the film. (There is a bad habit among video companies to use some hack art for animation covers that is not from the film, and makes the film look worse on the cover than what is actually on the tape, seems self defeating to me.) In 1988 Prism and Videocraft (now one word rather than Video Craft) released vhs copies in a slipcover package with one episode per tape, but the artwork on the cover does not look anything like the film. Both of the before mentioned Prism/Videocraft releases also say ""Childrens Video Playground"" on the front cover. In 1989 ""Starmaker Entertainment"" released some of the episodes, but their copies are not as good a quality as the Prism copies in my viewing of one episode, Johnny Appleseed. Also their cover art is not from the film and can throw you off. I will update quality and episode details this as I learn more. The most recent vhs re-release is from Anchor Bay Entertainment in 1989 but I am unsure yet of the quality or packaging.

Also ""Puss-n-Boots"" has been recently re-mastered and is featured on DVD as an extra feature on the holiday Animagic release ""Here Comes Peter Cottontail"" by Golden Books Entertainment who now owns the whole series and is treating their DVD releases very well with extras and remastering. Maybe they will release more of the episodes, hopefully the full 18, remastered on a multi disc DVD set.

Maybe you may remember these shows from the opening sequence that had the characters from fables, folk tales, and history walking out of a book and strolling across a rainbow while fireworks went off in the sky, the book opens with the title of the week's episode. I also seem to remember watching reruns in a classroom on 16mm but I could be wrong. It is really great that Amazon has the used feature for buying videos so that completists like me can search for the missing shows from our collections. There is also a good book on Rankin Bass for sale at Amazon, ""the Enchanted World of Rankin Bass"".",1128470400,,3476,4.647154471544716
