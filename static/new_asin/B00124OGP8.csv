Watching it was used as incentives by my parents for all kinds of things, school work, house work, home work, etc. I was a  little leery of watching it again, but it's wonderful now, too. In fact, I understand some of the humor that went right over my head in years past. I do wonder at which juncture of his life William Smith was in while filming this series.

3076400,5,B00124OGP8,"Forty years ago, as a kid, I loved this amazing show, and thought it was vastly underrated. After seeing the wonderful dvd release, I am pleased to see that it was every bit as good , in fact better,than I remembered. What a great show!! The cast is magic. The stories interesting,entertaining, and surprising. The music (especially the theme) is rousing and memorable, and the energy of the show is palpable. I have my fingers crossed that every episode ever produced comes to dvd in short order. Laredo rocks!!!",1209254400,9,513,4.775280898876405
3076401,5,B00124OGP8,"""Larado"" was a successful attempt to transfer the three British sergeant characters from ""Gunga Din"" (1939) into the American west and transform them into Texas Rangers. Archie (Cary Grant) became Chad Cooper (Peter Brown), Mac (Victor McLaglen) became Joe Riley (William Smith) and Tommy (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.) became Reese Bennett (Neville Brown).

Brown was the best of the mid-1960's ""pretty boy"" action stars (James Stacy, Mark Goddard, and David Hedison come to mind).

The show was a western parody, which like ""Maverick"" did not take itself too seriously despite an attempt to introduce relatively realistic action sequences and some straight drama. The humor mostly came from Chad and Joe teasing and baiting Reese, whose sputtering reactions were always entertaining. Brand was the heart of the show because his character was eccentric rather than serious. Reese did not have to play the straight man role because that function was handled by Ranger boss Captain Parmalee (Phillip Carey). While Reese indignantly blusters around, Parmalee just acts mildly aggravated by the threesome's juvenile antics, in the tradition of Ward Cleaver.

To go with ""Larado's"" three ""Gunga Din"" characters, Carey also brought a connection to television's ""Tales of the 77th Bengal Lancers"" (1956-57) series in which he starred as Lieutenant Michael Rhodes. Not to be outdone ""American"" Indian themes were prominent in the show with the Rangers regularly fighting renegade Indians and Joe having a vague Cheyenne Bodie type Indian background (note his beaded Indian belt).

Apparently Neville Brand had a contract dispute or just didn't get along with some members of the cast/crew because he quit midway through the series. Although they tried to carry on with Claude Akins as replacement the show had essentially lost its best element and could not make a successful transition. Brand's fans would get to see him again when they combined several episodes into a feature length movie called ""Three Guns For Texas"" (1968).

William Smith would go on to become the quintessential low budget movie tough guy and would star with Brown in ""Chrome and Hot Leather"" (1971). His all-time best performance was as Joe Namath's nemesis in ""C.C. and Company"" (1970).

Half of Season One is now out in a DVD package with the misleading title ""Best of Laredo"". The remainder of Season One is scheduled for DVD release in March 2008. No effort was made to cull out the best episodes for the first release so the second just consists of the remaining 15. Oddly the episodes are not arranged on the DVD by their original air dates.  The DVD set has no special features.

Here is a list of the 15 episodes on Volume #2 of the Season One DVD package, listed in the order of their original air dates:
The Jinx  (2 December 1965)  The Land Grabbers (9 December 1965) Above the Law (13 January 1966) That's Norway, Thataway (20 January 1966)  Meanwhile Back at the Reservation  (10 February 1966) The Treasure of San Diablo (17 February 1966)  No Bugles, One Drum (24 February 1966)  Miracle at Massacre Mountain (3 March 1966) It's the End of the Road, Stanley (10 March 1966)  A Very Small Assignment (17 March 1966)  Quarter Past Eleven (24 March 1966) The Deadiest Kid In the West 31 March 1966 The Sound of Terror  (7 April 1966)  The Would-Be Gentlemen of Larado (14 April 1966)  A Taste of Money (28 April 1966)
