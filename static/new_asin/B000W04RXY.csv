The storyline of the series is slightly different from the video games and the SatAM series. Knuckles and the Floating Island do make an appearance in the show, so I thought that was cool. Another thing I like about this show is that it is very child-friendly. In other words, it won't teach little kids any bad morals or anything like that.",1231200000,3,467,4.571428571428571
2959131,5,B000W04RXY,A great series though it would of been nice if the series had an actual ending where they were reunited and Robotnic defeated. One of the best parts was in each episode you didn't know what Dingo would transform into next.,1215475200,,222,4.439024390243903

This is definatly something you want little kids to watch, teaches them to be nice to their siblings and such. But it's not only for little kids, trust me, any Sonic fan should love these episodes, it seems to have a lighter tone than SatAM, everythings a little happier (though it's not all fun and games) I gaurentee you'll get over the wierd voices very quickly then really start to enjoy everything about it. I recomnd this to anyone who likes Sonic, as well has to families with brothers and sisster, i'm definatly going to get volume 2",1209772800,7,763,4.496402877697841

Well worth the money, especially I was buying the Best of sets. Its well worth price for 20 episodes and bonus music disc.",1208736000,,249,4.319148936170213
2959134,5,B000W04RXY,"If you searched for Sonic Underground on Amazon, you are probably a fan of the series, but if not, I will briefly summarize: Sonic Underground is a cartoon from 1999 that stars the famed Sonic the Hedgehog from Sega's most popular video game franchise. Sonic Underground introduced many firsts for the Sonic franchise including instruments, Sonic's family members, and an overall darker feel than previous Sonic games and shows.

The newly released Sonic Underground DVD set consists of 20 of the original 40 aired episodes on a 3 DVD set. Also included is a bonus CD including 8 songs from the show. Packed with bonus features ranging from commentary to a music video jukebox, the set is definately a great buy.

Sonic Underground is by far one of the most underrated TV series of all time and just may be the best cartoon ever made in my opinion. If you are a Sonic fan or just looking for a great series to watch, Sonic Underground is for you.",1198972800,20,946,4.625
2959135,5,B000W04RXY,"This is a high quality series, a real value for your money.  The Sonic Underground is a great TV series and I have been hoping that they would release more Sonic Underground episodes in Region 1.

If you want a Sonic the Hedgehog cartoon that is follows the same story line as the video games, this series is not for you.  If you are looking for a classic Sonic the Hedgehog cartoon with a bit of a twist, I highly recommend this series.

Sonic Underground has a good story line, great characters, and good morals (which is not the case with most of the cartoons these days).  Sonia's voice could use improvement, but after you listen for a little while you get used to it.

As for the music, there is one song in every episode.  Some adults may not like the songs, but the episodes are geared towards children and most children love the songs.  They have a catchy beat, have good morals and are fun!

It is obvious that the creators of Sonic Underground put much effort and time into the detailed artwork and story line of the show.  The story line is different than the games, but it is a good story line nonetheless.

There are other episodes that hopefully will be released if there is enough demand for this series.  I hope that you will consider buying it so that they will complete the Sonic Underground DVD collection and other Sonic the Hedgehog cartoon series collections.

2959146,5,B000W04RXY,Recently my kid saw Sonic on Netflix her LOVED it. He was hogging the computer so I bought him this disc set. He loves it!,1352592000,2,122,3.92
2959147,1,B000W04RXY,"This cartoon is why so many adults hate 'cartoons.' If you're going to do a show about Sonic in a BAND and hire only one voice actor, why not hire one who can actually sing? They do exist.

Painful to listen to, with an animation quality that's equally painful to watch.

Possibly the worst drivel the Sonic series has ever produced, and considering some of the lemons they've been willing to slap Sonic's name on, that is saying something.

Too bad I will probably have to buy the rest of the series for a young family member, since for some reason, kids too young to have developed taste beyond 'it's animated' love the bad singing and washed out, pathetic excuses for a plot. It barely fits into the rest of the Sonic shows- was probably developed to have other main characters and they slapped Sonic into it just so someone would actually watch it. It'd never have sold without a major character glued on.

If your kids haven't seen it, don't let them get started on it. Your ears will thank you.",1336003200,3,1000,4.478021978021978

2959153,3,B000W04RXY,"The underground series, is something that I think younger kids will love. The songs are cute, but can get a little annoying. Sonic's ""Attitude"" gets a little annoying and at times it sounds like almost the same person doing the voices for all 3 characters. The sister sounds like the voice of Steve Urkle. Which I found really annoying. It is fun at times. Get it if you have kids say around..3-6yrs of age. They will find it entertaining. Kids above those ages...Sonic X is the way to go. Even for adults, because it's so true to the characters and the story. Sonic Underground...not bad. But not great.",1233878400,4,604,4.601851851851852
