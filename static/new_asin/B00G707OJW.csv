8621162,4,B00G707OJW,"wow ,who knew Robert Vaughn the man from UNCLE could lock horns with the likes of Willam Buckley,Jewels of the past and the more things change etc.  etc. etc. The problem is this subject and this kind of debate  needed many more hours to be able to come to any serious conclusions and to maybe determine who got the best of whom. I don't know about others but I for one would be happy to sit through it all. Unfortunately these short segments are like sound bites and we judge the winner  by the"" quick wit retort"" rather than the content  of what is being said.",1432857600,,562,4.273584905660377

8621165,5,B00G707OJW,"It would be difficult for me to add anything new which has not already been mentioned by the other reviewers.  I thought that Robert Vaughn was excellent, very articulate, extremely intelligent.  At the beginning of the show, it was announced that Mr. Vaughn was interested in possibly going into politics and he should have.  He demonstrated that he possessed a clear and unfiltered sense of perception, a mastery of expression, and excellent poise.  He would have been a great politician for this country and we missed out.  Little did we know of the real man behind Napoleon Solo.  I recommend watching this episode.  If you are interested in politics, in the Vietnam war, the sixties, or are a fan of Mr. Vaughn's, you will enjoy this show very much!",1424217600,4,754,4.7984496124031
8621166,5,B00G707OJW,"Having now watched several of these reissued Firing Line debates, I must say that I almost passed this one by because I didn't expect much from someone I only knew as that iconic actor from ""The Man From U.N.C.L.E."" But I was pleasantly surprised by Robert Vaughn's knowledge of the historic events and his ability to hold his own in the debate. He did not let Bill draw him out into an ""ad absurdum"" position as is his normal strategy. Bob kept Bill off guard with his short, succinct responses, offering clarifications and corrections that the latter had to accept as valid. Bob Vaughn, while he may have been considered a ""liberal"", actually articulated well what has come to be regarded as a classic libertarian position. Even then he seemed to disagree with liberals as much as with conservatives leaving Bill at times groping for questions. This show was better than several others I've seen and, for Firing Line fans, definitely worth a view.",1402876800,8,949,4.7926829268292686
