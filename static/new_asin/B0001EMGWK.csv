8011298,5,B0001EMGWK,"Worth the price of the movie for the soundtrack (albeit chopped) alone, MT is a flawless example of what Catholicism does to an otherwise healthy mind. This observation of human nature is guaranteed to drive your fussy, conventional guests out the door, and if delicate, out of their minds.

A lovely slice of Baltimore life, showcasing Wyman Park, the old Mayflower building, and carefully selected alleys, will have you reminiscing past personal incidents, -that is if you lived in Baltimore in a wilder era.

From the dogmatic praying to the incessant slurping, Barrymore's licentious blurb to the pigsty climax, the grimy veneer of Mdme. Avara's REAL TRASH rating gleams in all it's iconoclastic splendor.

A true gem of the now, all-too-distant realm of BPC (Before Politically Correct).

8011299,1,B0001EMGWK,"Right after watching the film I had to come to Amazon to know what the movie was about!!!
Yes, I have seen other John Waters movies, and I liked them all, but this one is just plain terrible. I was constantly checking the dvd timer to know how much more of the movie I had to go through.
Terrible acting, terrible lip-synch, terrible image quality (waaaaay to dark), and way to many times where there was nothing going on on the screen. And way too many times where the things on the screen made no sense.
You could tell this weird story in, minimum, half the time.
Again: I am not saying John Waters is crap. I'm saying this movie is",1315008000,,634,4.24793388429752
8011300,5,B0001EMGWK,"This one is the first of the Prince Of Puke- John Waters' ""MastUrpieces"" that you can see.  It is silent, except for all the cheesy 50's ""trash music"" that Waters is infamous for using, and also poorly lip sync'd vain babbling by our HIroine, the fabulous 300 pound monstrosity, Divine!

Follow Divine's treck down the yellow brick road, when she gets involved in the life of Mary Vivian Pierce, runs her over, then attempts to ""save"" her through the services of the Virgin Mary and Doctor Coathanger!

You can see that Divine has such unlimited talent just waiting to be exploited in mastUrpieces like Pink Flamingos, Female Trouble, Polyester, Lust in the Dust and Hairspray.

""Come out, come out, wherever you are and BE that young lady who fell from a star!  Baltimore they said was the name of the star!""

Divine LIVED that line!  See HIr shortly after she first got ""discovered"" by Waters in Mondo Trasho, and dicover that ""wiggle"" that turned the  freak world on!",1154217600,2,970,4.732142857142857
8011301,4,B0001EMGWK,"This film cost 2000 dollars and was probably filmed with only one camcorder. It is an art film though, art films are supposed to be cheap and grainy. They are also supposed to be some sort of metaphor, either that or wierd for the sake of wierd. This wasn't really either. What this film is, though, the closest that John Waters ever came to becoming a Bunuelian clone.

The review provided by Amazon gives the wrong summary. I won't give it here, because it is not really worth recalling. Ms. Pierce gets her feet sucked and licked and a Cinderella story unfolds. She then gets hit by Divine and the Virgin Mary does everything in her power to help Divine maintain her Divinity.

I am not sure if there was a metaphor to this film. If there was I am not quite sure what it is. Was it that transvestites need the Virgin Mary to grant them Divinity and steer then from original sin. Maybe. Probably not. John Waters was still in his very early developing stages as a film maker so most of his mistakes and lack of clarity are forgivable.

I want the soundtrack. The soundtrack was composed of 50s music that advanced the story without the use of dialouge. The music was composed in a genius pattern and actually told us what emotions were being transmitted. The soundtrack is clearly the high point of the film adn I would suggest watching this movie as you would listen to a record, it would be worth it.

This movie was not as filthy as any of Waters' later films but had a fair share of nudity and filth including the ""chicken without a head"" test. Recommended for art film fans and for hardcore fans of Waters.",1093478400,4,1613,4.420875420875421
