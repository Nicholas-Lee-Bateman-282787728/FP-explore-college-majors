6162777,5,B00HHAX9BI,Never got to see the show on PBS or WETA.  Will it ever be put on DVD for the United States.  Dont have a UK disc player.  I enjoy these types of shows immensely and so do my daughters (3).  Have read the book.  Please let me know if you think it will be put on DVD. Thank you Carolyn Clements,1398729600,,293,3.737704918032787
6162778,5,B00HHAX9BI,P. D. James does a great job of picking up where Jane Austin left off. Book was very good too.,1398038400,,94,3.75
6162779,4,B00HHAX9BI,"This was an interesting movie. A good plot. Actors different from previous P & P Dramas but fitted well with the story and period.
Yes certainly kept you guessing about poor old Wickham's future and Darcy's relationship with Elizabeth and her family.
If you like a period drama, then I suggest an evening to watch this one with others who have the same interest. Overall, yes I would recommend this one.",1397433600,,403,4.690140845070423
6162780,4,B00HHAX9BI,"This started off like a modern mystery that takes placed in a period drama setting but did not feel like any of the period dramas I have watched ( all of them actually!)  The settings and costumes are beautiful, but the pace was too fast, choppy, and darker than what I would have expected.  Eventually, in the last of the 3 parts, it finally found it's footing.  The story line is pretty good.  I did enjoy it overall.  Great cast, but I think they really didn't get to fully develop their characters.

A good period drama is as notable for what people don't say as what they do say.  Therefore, characters have to convey a lot with subtlety, and with sufficient time to do so.  There wasn't time for that with the pace of this film so don't expect it to be like Pride & Prejudice.",1396483200,2,782,4.308219178082192
6162781,4,B00HHAX9BI,"I have waited for this to be available, and while the story is not of Jane Austen's quality, I found the story enjoyable and especially like the cast, character interactions, and the location and photography completed the whole effect beautifully.

6162788,3,B00HHAX9BI,"Great idea to continue Jane Austen's most beloved novel, ""Pride & Prejudice."" But pockmarked, pug-nosed, flat-chested, homely, common Anna Maxwell Martin okay in Charles Dickens' world is completely encroyable as Regency Era Mrs. Elizabeth Bennett Darcy. So I will pass along this DVD instead of adding it my treasured Austen collection.

The others are well cast especially Wickham's redeeming qualities by likeable Downton Abbey actor as a man we can finally better understand Lizzy's initial infatuation & deception. The actress taking up Darcy's young sister Georgiana's story is so perfect a segue from the matchless latest ""Pride & Prejudice"" film that you forget they're not the same. The disjointed screenplay fails to develop Darcy's behavior credibly, and Fitzwilliam's misstep is incomprehensibly overdramatized. Lydia is more beautiful but more strumpet unlikeable and fails to engage us in the emotions attributed to her.

But for the enjoyment of continuing our society with the long loved families; gorgeous settings, styles, & equines; and the elegant beauty & romance of Regency England, I bore with by imagining the leads reprised by Keira Knightley & Matthew Macfadyen.",1516665600,,1188,5.521978021978022
6162789,5,B00HHAX9BI,"First off, I want to say bravo to PBS, and Masterpiece.

6162797,5,B00HHAX9BI,Wonderful show.  The cast and the writing superbly capture the feel of the characters and the world of Pride and Prejudice while interweaving an exciting murder mystery.  The look at how the Darcy's marriage is both wonderful but shadowed by class and gossip and shaken but withstands the intrusion of violence into the quiet of Pemberley -- It's all wonderful and wonderfully done.,1502236800,,382,5.0476190476190474

6162800,5,B00HHAX9BI,"What a lovely adaption of a wonderful book. James's novel is a fine sequel to Austen's classic - giving us so many of the details we love about the original novel with suspense and drama we could only have imagined before. While obviously some things in the book are hard to translate into film - such as all the nuances of Georgiana's relationships with the Colonel and Henry - the film gives us some insight we couldn't have got from Lizzie's perspective, such as Darcy's complicated feelings about Wickham. A wonderful film all the way around.",1501891200,,546,4.697916666666667

6162802,2,B00HHAX9BI,"I wanted to like this TV miniseries. After all, it's Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, together again, AND solving a murder-mystery! Should be an entertaining story, right?

Mr. and Mrs. Darcy do solve the mystery, and their Pemberley estate looks great.

But sadly, no, it was not an entertaining show. I even watched it twice, hoping I would like it better the second time. Still didn't like it.

Based on the 2011 mystery novel by P.D. James, ""Death Comes to Pemberley"" is too dark and too serious compared to any version of ""Pride and Prejudice.""

This 2013 miniseries has four big problems:

First, I didn't like the choice of actress for Elizabeth Bennet (Anna Maxwell Martin).

Second, I didn't like the way Elizabeth's character was written here: subdued, timid, and even anxious. Here she never seemed to have Elizabeth's strengths, or personality characteristics.

Third, the minor villains (Lydia and Wickham) get too much screentime, and this imbalances the entire miniseries with ""down"" scenes and dismal scenarios. Lydia's character and Wickham's character, as written here, seemed to be ""stronger"" or ""bigger"" personalities than Elizabeth, too.

Fourth, in contrast, the main characters, Elizabeth and Darcy seem to get less screentime than the secondary couple. Plus they get very few scenes of the two of them together, and even those aren't happy. Apparently, the Darcys are going through an unhappy season in their marriage.

So to sum up: Elizabeth and Darcy, in minor and then major conflict, for most of the time. The romance is gone, and doesn't look like it's coming back onto our screen anytime soon.

Also, Darcy is trying to marry off his younger sister, Georgiana, to some man she doesn't like!

NONE of the characters are having any fun. (And maybe the actors weren't enjoying the work, either.)

I didn't even have a favorite scene, or a favorite actor in this miniseries, so I doubt I would watch this again.",1501459200,,1937,5.0
6162803,3,B00HHAX9BI,"Mildly entertaining if bored, but the miscasting for Elizabeth Bennett was so intrusive that I found myself wondering what they were thinking, more than paying attention to the movie, the entire time. I loved this actress in Bleak House, but ""Death Comes
To Pemberly"" movie is supposed to take place 6 years after Elizabeth and Darcy married. Meaning Elizabeth would be 27-28 or thereabouts. This actress looks over 40. The fact that all her sisters look age appropriate, and Darcy looks younger than she does, makes it even worse. That and all of Elizabeth's witty, bright humor are written out of the script. It could have been a much more interesting movie if they'd tried a bit harder.",1500508800,,689,4.8474576271186445
6162804,2,B00HHAX9BI,"The only reason to watch is an obsession with P&P. The plot is slightly interesting, the acting passable but the execution is so plodding and heavy handed that it's not enjoyable. Combine that with character assassinations across the board and awkward moments of romance and you've got a boring mystery that no one would watch if it didn't have Pemberely in the title.",1497225600,,368,4.857142857142857
6162805,4,B00HHAX9BI,"Highly enjoyable murder mystery.

Excellent acting even if Matthew Rhys (The Americans) and Anna Maxwell Martin is not everyone's idea of Darcy & Elizabeth.  I admit Martin seemed too plain & four for Elizabeth, but she is a wonderful actress.

Jenna Coleman (Victoria) is wonderfully annoying as Lydia.

James Norton is alluring as Alveston.

Matthew Goode is seductive as Wickham.

Chatsworth (without its famous fountain & stair-step waterfall) stands in for Pemberley.",1496880000,,472,5.486111111111111
6162806,1,B00HHAX9BI,Very disappointed. It did not tell me that the DVD was American. Totally disappointed. Will not be recomending Amazon to friends.,1496534400,,129,5.190476190476191
6162807,5,B00HHAX9BI,Great movie!  I enjoyed all of it and I don't care what anyone else says about the cast.  It's about TALENT and not always about looks!,1496361600,,135,4.153846153846154

6162811,5,B00HHAX9BI,I can watch it over and over. Very suspenseful.,1491177600,,47,4.333333333333333
6162812,5,B00HHAX9BI,"PD James wrote a wonderful novel based on Jane Austin's characters five years after ""Pride and Prejudice,"" which makes it a great sequel. The DVD accurately and colorfully plays out the consequences where the ""sins of the fathers [are] being visited on the children."" Wickham has fathered a child out of wedlock (any surprise?), and Mrs. Young (remember her?) conspires with him to abduct the baby so she can raise it for her own. In the process, a ""murder"" is committed, Wickham is blamed, and Darcy and Elizabeth are there to pick up the pieces, with a magistrate whose father was responsible for hanging a Pemberley deer poacher kid. Also, Darcy's great grandfather put Pemberley at risk, and Elizabeth fears that her sister's marriage to Wickham might put Pemberley at risk again because  of the scandal. The music delightfully captures the excitement of a busy household, travelling by carriage, and a secret romance, and underscores the complex plot tension that leads to a satisfying conclusion.",1490745600,2,1002,5.072727272727272
6162813,4,B00HHAX9BI,"Coming from an avid Jane Austen reader, I was amazed by how true to Jane Austen's style the book was. This is not true to the book, but makes ""dramatic"" changes for the purposes of rendering a series more full of action and tension. That having been said, this is a lovely, beautifully filmed and well-acted production. Despite the fact that the actress playing Elizabeth Bennett didn't look the part, she nailed Lizzy's character completely. The rest of the cast was VERY well chosen and did phenomenal jobs. Very well worth watching for Austen fans, but perhaps not for someone who is looking because PD James wrote the book. Whatever you do, I recommend you read the book. So great.",1490572800,,685,4.716666666666667
6162814,5,B00HHAX9BI,"While I enjoyed this overall, I didn't like some of the casting and acting. The lead for Elizabeth Bennett was my least favorite casting of Elizabeth Bennett ever. It's not that she was a bad actress, but she looked more matronly than the heroine of a timeless love story. I was excited about the casting for Mr. Darcy, but I wasn't as fond of his portrayal of Mr. Darcy. Maybe my expectations of Mr. Darcy are a bit high, but he seems to lose it too much at certain points in the film. Realistically, that's probably what would happen, but we've come to expect more from Darcy, right?",1489708800,,585,4.425925925925926
6162815,5,B00HHAX9BI,Especially impressed with the casting of both Wickham and Darcy--they much fit the part. What an amazing nod to the original. Enjoyed it very much!,1489622400,,147,4.92

6162823,3,B00HHAX9BI,"excellent piece except for complete miscasting of anna maxwell martin as elizabeth. her acting is wonderful but her looks are not at all credible as elizabeth. this is not to say one has to be a beauty queen to play a leading lady as elizabeth, but apparently she was expected to transform herself into a leading light of society at that time without the help of make-up or costume.as the doyenne of pemberley elizabeth would have been much more glamorous and dressed the part, but every other woman in this production outside of the servants has more sumptuous clothing. elizabeth goes around in what appears a dreary housedress of blue or green constantly, and with a cheap looking straw hat --it simply is not credible that she was not dressed or made up for the part. considering Darcy was the catch of the day, it is hard to believe a woman as plain as this elizabeth would even be a blip on darcy's radar screen. martin is a good solid actress but makeup/costume design can transform any actor especially in a costume drama so i find this perplexing as it undermines an otherwise fine production profoundly.",1488499200,,1113,4.683673469387755

Poorly cast, too.  Elizabeth and Darcy are just dull and dreary.  They don't remotely resemble the characters from P&P in any way.

6162853,3,B00HHAX9BI,"the horrendous casting in this series makes it painful to watch. It is not that the actors are not competent. They are terrible miscast. Starting with Elizabeth. The actress who I have enjoyed in other films looks like she is 40 years old. Her look is slightly unkempt, she looks like she just threw on any dress , barely combined her hair, hard to believe she is the wife of a wealthy man. She wears no hat when she goes out and this would never happen. Lydia has better clothes than Lizzie. And while you know she would be extravagant you would think her clothes would not be so top line. Her husband Mr Darcy too looks a bit old and does not carry the legacy of Mr Darcy who is larger than life very well. Mrs Bennet Lizzie's mother while irritating has none of the shrill edginess that is both amusing and exasperating. This woman who plays her blends into the background. Lydia has none of the playfulness but is played by the girl from Dr Who with narcissism and a certain intelligence.
While the story is compelling this casting makes me cringe. Whoever cast it and costumed Lizzy should find another job.while watching one can't help but compare the casting of this film to the iconic Pride And Prejudice filmed with Colon Firth and Jennifer Ehle. This may be u fair but it sticks in your mind, High expectations for this series but it is like puzzle pieces almost fitting but somehow can't quite fit. And why isn't Georgiana married yet? The character change in Colonal Fitzwilliam was just an unworthy plot device. The nice surprise was seeing James Fleet as Mr Bennet, who filled that role very well.",1479168000,,1611,4.5395189003436425

I'm a huge fan of the 1995 BBC production and I wasn't sure anyone could be Lizzy like Jennifer Ehle. Well, she did do a fantastic job and the other actors, sets, costumes, etc. are top notch. It's gorgeous and decadent, exciting and romantic. Really loved James Norton's Henry and Matthew Rhys' Darcy.  It marries my two favorite things, a cozy British mystery and Jane Austen.

6162865,5,B00HHAX9BI,"I loved Death Comes to Pemberly! I won't take time to comment on the story, so many others have taken the time to give detailed reviews.

I would like to comment on Anna Maxwell-Martin as Lizzie Bennet. I admit that when first viewing Anna in the part as Lizzie Bennet it took some time to adjust to her. I have to say I like her in this part. In the natural course of events Lizzie Bennet would have matured and experienced personality changes through necessity, regardless of what she might have been at the end of the novel. I think that Anna brings some of those possible changes in Lizzie's character. The novel ends on a very romantic high, but years into her marriage (where she is in this movie) would have moved our heroine into a different realm. I think Anna Maxell-Martin does a great job in showing us what that change might have looked like. Growing from a bubbly, hopeful, somewhat carefree, idealistic, sometimes immature young women to an inwardly beautiful, mature, stable, realistic, married woman who is able to handle many demands upon her life. (Lets face it, courting Mr. Darcy and being married to him is two completely different things  as much as we love him, he would be high maintenance!) Anna Maxwell-Martin does exhibit beautifully what I love in Lizzie no matter what age she is, her fighting spirit, which makes me love this character so much!",1473120000,2,1375,4.677685950413223
6162866,5,B00HHAX9BI,"I avoided watching this for so long. There are very few literary characters that are able to burrow into your heart and mind, and when they do, I want them to stay exactly as is. No changes, no creative license. For me, that's been Lizzie and Darcy.

In my head, Lizzie and Fitzwilliam needed to have a highly improbable, perfect marriage, where they just love each other, never have anything bad ever touch their lives, and when they hit 90 or so, die together in their sleep. I didn't want some fan fiction storyline messing up that image of who they were and how they lived.

But I'm glad I overcame that puerile notion and gave this a chance. First of all, the casting choice was excellent. Who better to play them than two of the most talented, yet under-appreciated actors of our time? Lizzie's mother and sisters were as annoying as ever, and her father as astute yet resigned as ever. Georgiana finally got her happy ending, which I appreciated.

I didn't really care about the plot or Denny. While the trial was supposed to have been the main event, I couldn't have cared less. For me, it was simply background music, there to showcase the Darcys relationship, which actually wasn't perfect and in putting on display their flaws, adversities and deepest fears, made their connection all the more realistic and marriage more believable.

If this portrayal had kept them how they were in my head, I would have hated it. They would have come across as a Hallmark channel/Harlequin romance creation: ridiculous and comically unbelievable. Instead, we saw how Darcy's social peers viewed Lizzie; saw how Darcy, despite softening from P&P still behaved and carried himself as Lord of the Major should; saw Lizzie's deepest fears; and saw them being angry with each other with neither one backing down. In other words, we saw a real marriage. And I for one loved every minute of it.",1472774400,,1884,4.734756097560975

The characters are nothing like the characters in Pride & Prejudice, they do not interplay well,  nor do they act in a way true to the grace and style of the early 1800's.  Many of the scenes (especially several with the honorable Lady Catherine de Bourgh) are completely disjointed and unnecessary to the plot. The story line itself is actually quite interesting and gets better towards the end.

Seriously would no other actors take the parts. Weren't jane and lizzy suppose to be pretty???? What having children automatically makes you ugly??? Seriously real casting issues! Story was ok. The relationships between spouses were all crazy. Honestly, I wouldn't watch again, but horrible IF you tie it at all to the book 'pride and prejudice'!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I am sure the writer to THIS book did so because she loved the original writer of the 'acutal' story to which this references, ""Pride and Prejudice"". By Jane Austen. But to write off of the coat tails of anothers work, you must remain true to the characters, which is why the book was timeless in the first place. The writer of this book did NOT stay true to the characters. Lydia is suppose to be self interested and have no cares, not even for her husband, for anything but her self. Don't make her noble, sometimes all that really is in people is nothing...don't think you have to add depth when there is none. Lizzy is grumpy and unlikeable, and a shrewish know it all. Darcy is grumpy and pulls away from his true love. This was very unlike the finish of the 'real' book. Story was ok, but the characters were hard to like exept the police man.. of all weird things!
Look if you like Jane Austin you can watch this as SEPERATE from, and its worth a watch. But if you can't, don't watch it, you will be disappointed, the author takes way too much liberty with the characters personalities. Disappointing!",1459123200,,1649,4.612244897959184

I suppose that I have that long held image of Elizabeth being Jennifer Ehle.  With a strong and emotive face.  This Elizabeth was almost homely looking and she played the character so... timid or meek.

Where the novel fell quite short, the tv version did an outstanding job. In casting Matthew Rhys and Anna Maxwell, as well as many of the other actors, a darker mood was set, and quite rightly, for a murder. The series was balanced nicely with the gorgeous Chatsworth, the subdued but passionate marriage of Darcy and Elizabeth (of course) and the rewards for Georgiana, Lydia and Wickham (those two deserve each other).

6162954,4,B00HHAX9BI,"This is a sumptuous adaptation of the novel of the same name  by P.D. James, the acclaimed author of many mysteries. She wrote a homage to Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"".  The BBC presented it as a three episode, Masterpiece Mystery mini series. The Darcys are now married and have a child. They are living peacefully on their beautiful Pemberley estate. Life is good. They are in the throes of planning a house party and awaiting guests, when disaster strikes.

It seems that Wickham and his wife, Lydia, are hell bent on crashing the party at Pemberly. They are  in their carriage with Captain Denny, Wickham's best friend, and while riding through Pemberley Woods, Denny suddenly demands that the carriage stop, and once it does, inexplicably dashes off into the woods. Wickham then goes off in pursuit. The next thing that is known is that Denny is dead, and Wickham is the prime suspect. Given Wickham's affiliation with  the Darcys, they chance becoming social pariahs if Wickham should be found guilty, despite his protestations of innocence.

This is a lovely, beautifully realized adaptation with superlative production values. Period authenticity is maintained throughout and  the acting is marvelous, overall. The casting is spot on with one exception, that of the role of Elizabeth Darcy. Elizabeth is supposed to be rather pretty, as well as quite intelligent. Well, the actress playing Elizabeth, while radiating intelligence, as well as many other edifying attributes, is so plain as to be a distraction. I am not sure why she was cast in the role of Elizabeth, as it strikes the only discordant note in the series. Still, she gives a fine performance and is enormously likeable. All in all, an entertaining and well done mini series.",1453680000,,1754,5.006872852233677

I do agree with other Reviewers that the actress who played Mrs. Darcy was not as good looking especially after Keira Nightley nor as well dressed as someone in her position  as Mistress of a great manor should be, but her performance was good and I found myself very satisfied..  I have watched this at least five or six times since the first time and have enjoyed it time and again.  As a mystery is was light weight but it fit in well with the story line.

I'm not especially picky when it comes to Austen adaptations. I love her work to the point where I'm usually open to all sorts of different spins on it and find myself embracing even some of the Austen films that my fellow fans dislike. My verdict after watching Death Comes to Pemberley is that it's worth watching, but overall it could have been better (at times a lot better!) than it was.

First the good news: I found this significantly better than the book, which, with all due respect to the usually wonderful PD James, was almost shockingly bad in my opinion. I thought the book's pacing was a mess, the writing was depressingly dull and dry, and the characterizations and tone were just egregiously OFF, for lack of a better way of putting it. The movie is an improvement over the book, and at many points even flirts with being borderline great rather than just solid and decent.

There are some definite treats to be found here---the usual breathtaking costumes and scenery we've come to expect from these productions, some well-crafted dialogue, and a few very enjoyable minor characters we remember from Austen's classic. As a huge mystery buff, I can't claim the mystery is especially well plotted or executed, but it does provide an engaging diversion from the usual scenes and storylines of most other period pieces.

So what holds this back from being one of those Austen-related productions that I'm tempted to watch repeatedly?! First and foremost, as many others have stated, Elizabeth Bennet is egregiously miscast here (and, to be fair, written pretty poorly as well). Her look, her mannerisms, her general affect, her way of expressing herself...honestly, it's all such a radical departure from the Elizabeth Bennet most of us have come to know and love that I found myself enjoying DCtP more when I pretended this was an original character I'd never met before rather than Austen's iconic heroine. And then there's the overall tone, which lacks the liveliness, spirit, and sharp, clever wit most of us associate with anything even tangentially related to Austen. It's rather flat and plodding and even vaguely maudlin at parts, though not as much as the dreadful book on which it's based.

I wish so much that Amazon allowed half stars: three stars feels a little too low, while four feels too high. If you can get past Elizabeth being such a sadly unrecognizable character, I'd lean towards four stars. Sadly, for me that was a pretty big stumbling block that really affected my enjoyment of this solid but unspectacular production.  I hope this was helpful!",1451865600,3,2594,4.884090909090909
6162961,3,B00HHAX9BI,"Loved this BBC production. Everything about it but the choice for actors in the main roles.
Sorry, but Rhys doesn't have 1/16th of the charisma Jane Austen's Mr Darcy has. Doesn't even come close -- rather is a whiny, confused little man who is far less imposing, emotionally as well as physically, than any prior rendition of Mr Darcy I've ever seen.
Martin Smith as Elizabeth is, well... wrong. I cannot in earnest describe how very wrong. I have never read the actual novel, but I cannot believe its author took that many liberties with Elizabeth's character as to turn her into a dull, homely, unimpressive woman, in every way.

But if you're looking for something even remotely comparable to the Pride & Prejudice that we all love, you will not find it here! Far and above everything else is casting! They must have blindly chosen a name out of a hat for Elizabeth! They could not have picked a more homely, plain, uninspired, deadbeat actress for this role if they tried. I've seen her in other roles, and she's fine, but she is NO ELIZABETH BENNET DARCY by any stretch of the imagination! She completely distracted from the whole movie! I think she wore the same ugly, plain, completely unflattering dress the whole time too! She looked more like one of the servants than the beautiful mistress of Pemberly! No personality, no charm, no wit, no fire, no smile, no makeup, bad hair, no chemistry with Darcy, nothing appealing whatsoever! Not to mention she looked more like Darcy's mother than his 26 year old bride! Was marriage really that hard on her? Sorry for being so harsh, but it was that bad for me! That's all my husband & daughters & I kept saying through the whole movie is, she is not Elizabeth! Mr Darcy was a little more bearable, but still not great by any means! I'm partial to Matthew Macfadyen, second Colin Firth. He just didn't capture Mr. Darcy to me like they did. I mean, Georgiana was even taller than him! That's just wrong! Lol! I didn't read the book, so I can't judge this movie on that, but like I said, it was really hard to get past these two characters, that are the heart of Pemberly, to really enjoy the rest of the movie!",1444089600,2,1683,4.485342019543974

6162994,1,B00HHAX9BI,"I'm a big fan of Jane Austen and have read several fan fictions with the characters as well. I was VERY excited to see a Masterpiece mini-series that picked up Lizzy and Darcy's story (Pride and Prejudice), a few years later. But I'm sorry to say, I couldn't get past the terrible casting. And I really tried! I thought if I could just pretend it was about different people - I like period dramas - that I could get into it, but even that didn't work. It is beyond me to figure out why they would cast a such a homely woman in her LATE 30s (possibly 40) to play a renowned beauty with fine eyes (Austen's description of Lizzy)! I'm struggling to find a word other than ugly, because that may be too harsh, but she was possibly the LEAST attractive woman I saw in the 30 minutes I suffered through. When I realized that I was lost, and not following the story because I couldn't get past the irritation, I gave up trying to watch. I swear my inner dialog was drowning out the actors lines... Lizzy looks way too old... There are bags under her small, beady eyes... Her nose is fat... Why the HELL didn't they cast someone more attractive!? Is this the director's/producer's/writer's wife?  I even thought Darcy was very poorly cast and it didn't matter if everyone else was perfect. Get Lizzy and Darcy THAT wrong and it ruins the whole show. I'm sorry, I do not get it. I honestly have never seen anything like it. I have NEVER before had to stop watching a show because the actors LOOKS were that distracting. Because they were not as described in the book and because they were so far and away different from the many other incarnations. I was very disappointed.

The woman cast as Elizabeth was very distracting to me. The Bennett girls were famous local beauties, you know... This chick, not so much. I'm not sure if it revealed how long Eliza & Darcy have been married, but judging by the age of their son (about 5 years?)- it is assuredly less than a decade, which would make Eliza still below the age of 30. That actress looked 45 if she looked a day old. She is not lively or witty either; we see Mrs. Darcy enjoying none of her famed outdoor jaunts or even reading a book. The casual viewer would be left wondering what in the world such a eligible gentleman married that ratchet for.

Why is Darcy so sympathetic to Wickham? To everyone. THIS IS NOT MY DARCY! This was more than ""protecting the good name""- it was complete and utter BS and I will have no more of it! And Lydia's placid turn?! I think not!

This Elizabeth is so bland, boring, and washed out that she in no way resembles Austen's Elizabeth, IMO. All the other characters in ""Death Comes to Pemberley"" far outshine this Elizabeth; that isn't right, and isn't true to the way the character should appear and perform.",1432684800,3,528,4.943820224719101

6163049,3,B00HHAX9BI,"FIRST ,TWO GREAT LINES FROM THE STORY.1) ELIZABETH TO DARCY ""WE SHOULD NOT LOOK TO THE PAST UNLESS IT WILL BRING US PLEASURE NOT PAIN. "" We pay shrinks $200 a session to help rid us of our guilt when all they have to do is quote Elizabeth. Makes sense .2) When studying for my boards I came across a word to study for the vocab. section . That word was ""succour"" . It means aid or help. I never could imagine anyone using it. But Darcy found away. ""I will stay on and offer succour as it is needed."" This alone was worth the purchase.
SEQUELS  really can let you down. It is sooo unusual to find a sequel that even comes close to the pleasure one gets from reading or watching the original classic. Even in Saga s there is a new generation with new personalities. How can anyone pick up where ""Catcher in the RYE"" left off.  What, Holden solves a crime in the park ? What level can we be taken to after that experience. Can you imagine a sequel to ""The Maltese Falcon. Sam spade played by Mel Gibson .Come on Let it stand alone as it has earned that right. Gone with the Wind, Casablanca ,High Noon etc. These are stories that are so special that any attempt is doomed from the beginning.
PD JAMES does create an interesting murder mystery. Lots of suspense .Certainly worth a read. But why exploit the uniquness of the Bennet/Darcy clan. Yes they were a fascinating multifaceted group of personalities. This family'story ended with the last period of the last page. There is no way to resurrect them.
True  we loved these characters .Sure its hard to let go. And we want more. ..DO  you want The Bennets solving a jewel theft. Followed by Good Jane saves a lost soul from the devil rum. Where will it end. Mr. Bennet takes a mistress who loves books. Willeby becomes an eagle scout. Please, please move on. Get past it.
For those that need to delve deeper into this sequel there are some extensive reviews that will show you their take on this sequel. The are interesting. I have read them and was intrigued by their views. The first two are exceptionally well written (2014).  If you like a mystery then go for it .

6163052,3,B00HHAX9BI,"I must say, this adaptation of PD James' novel is far easier to digest as a mini-series than a book. As much as I respect and enjoy the work of the late Ms. James, ""Death Comes to Pemberley"" was a bad read. Her characters were flimsy and trotted in and out of the story with little impact or connection to the plot or other characters. This edited dramatic version manages to make more sense of the story, while the nicely executed (if trendy) cinematography fills in the visual gaps.

Nearly ruining this tidy and entertaining package is the bewildering and inconsistent casting of many of the principle characters. Baby-faced Lydia could conceivably still pass as a teen, yet she should be 22. Her counterpart Wickham appears to be a decade younger than his contemporary Fitzwilliam Darcy. Yet Darcy, his sister Georgiana, and Elizabeth's parents are all excellently and appropriately cast within their probable ages.

My primary objection to casting and consequently, to the series itself, is the choice of Elizabeth. A character whose two principle attributes are her ""fine eyes"" and wry wit should ideally be portrayed by someone who possesses both. Or at least, by someone who can maintain a pretense of both. Anna Maxwell Martin is a talented actress who can muster depth and wit, but her bland features fall far short of the person described by Jane Austen. Obviously, Lizzie would not be in the first blush of youth any longer; her character has aged, and she is now a mother. Yet we as viewers are to accept the prematurely aged 38-year old Martin as the 26-year old heroine of James' sequel? Adding insult to injury, Martin's heavily hooded, washed-out blue eyes are offered in place of the large, flashing ""dark eyes"" of Austen's novel.

Anna Maxwell Martin is an admirable actress with an impressive pedigree, but that does not qualify her to portray a well-established female character whose physical attributes are so grossly sublimated by Martin's performance.",1431820800,31,1976,4.9637462235649545

6163057,3,B00HHAX9BI,"If you're a fan of Jane Austin's Pride & Prejudice, you'll probably enjoy elements of the BBC production of ""Death Comes to Pemberley.""  All of your favorite characters put in an appearance, the sets are lavish and beautifully framed, and everything about the series feels authentic to the period.  But two central problems get in the way of making this a truly enjoyable experience - first, the two main characters are miscast, and second, the murder mystery itself lacks both momentum and interest.

The biggest problem is the casting of Anna Maxwell Martin as Elizabeth Bennett and Matthew Rhys as Darcy.  Not only is Martin too old to be playing 26-year-old Lizzie, but she brings none of Lizzie's wit and passion to the role.  Instead, we get a woman who seems exhausted most of the time, as if marriage to Darcy has wrung her dry.  Martin's Lizzie is a brooding creature who lurks in the shadows, frets about the goings on at Pemberley, and never seems either particularly in love with her husband or comfortable in her surroundings.  There are a few brief exchanges between Lizzie and her father (James Fleet) which come close to igniting the spark in their relationship, but it's sadly too little to be much help.  And Rhys plays Darcy as a rather boring aristocrat who would rather marry his sister off to a man she doesn't love than allow her the freedom to follow her heart (as Darcy himself supposedly did when he married Lizzy).

Casting aside, ""Death Comes to Pemberley"" also suffers from a rather mundane murder mystery that is never quite exciting enough to generate much interest.  The victim, Captain Denny (Tom Canton), a friend of the infamous Mr. Wickham (Matthew Goode), is murdered in the woods outside Pemberley on the evening of a festive ball.  As expected, Wickham quickly becomes the most obvious suspect.  Since we never have time to care much about Denny, and it's hard to feel much sympathy for anything befalling Wickham, the murder mystery itself is never as engaging as it should be.  Did Wickham kill Denny?  Do we really care?  No, I think not.  There are a few other mysteries thrown in to further muddy the waters (who's the woman Lizzie stumbles across on the night of the murder, who's the father of a young woman's illegitimate baby, and how do these things impact on the murder investigation?), but none of it made me eager to tune in to the next episode.

Overall, I enjoyed enough about ""Death Comes to Pemberley"" to justify the $5.00 cost of a ""Season Pass,"" but I doubt I'll ever watch it again.  If you're a fan of the original novel, it's a bit of a hoot to see Lydia behaving badly again, or Jane being noble and kind, but I was never able to accept Martin's Lizzie or Rhys's Darcy as true depictions of this beloved literary couple.",1430956800,11,2782,4.677618069815195

6163062,4,B00HHAX9BI,"A well-done production by Masterpiece. The settings were beautiful, and the story seemed to be a mostly faithful sequel to Jane Austen's work. Most of the supporting cast were completely spot-on for me. Coleman played a deceptively cute Lydia Wickham at her worst and best. Mr. Wickham was handsome and charming, and Goode did well to show a slightly vulnerable side to Wickham. Tomlinson was an elegant and beautiful, yet shy and sweet Miss Darcy. Mr. and Mrs. Bennet were perfect as well. These were the performances that really carried the story for me.

I was a bit disappointed in other performances though. The actress who played Elizabeth is an amazing actress in her own right, but she didn't quite capture Elizabeth in this story for me. She was a bit too old to be playing Elizabeth who has not even reached 30 in this story. She also played Elizabeth without the the sparkle I imagined she would have. She gave Elizabeth some strength and courage which carried her through the performance, but it wasn't perfect for me. Another disappointing character was Colonel Fitzwilliam. While the actor played this version of the Colonel well, it wasn't Jane Austen's version. What happened to that charming man who stood at a contrast to his more serious cousin, Mr. Darcy? Maybe war and new responsibilities changed him, but if this was the case, It wasn't explained well enough to my satisfaction. His character was the most upsetting for me.

While there are some disappointments to be found in ""Death Comes to Pemberly,"" I still enjoyed this miniseries. Some characters that were not quite captured in previous movies were spot on in this version. The story was also interesting, and it was great to revisit Jane Austen's world again. I hope the success of this miniseries will bring about more spin-offs of Austen's work to the screen.",1429833600,,1842,4.881789137380192

Masterpiece Theatre always does such a great job of making literary characters real.

I felt it plodded along and I was not impressed with Elizabeth's representation. She was not attractive and she seemed long suffering in her acting. I didn't feel a chemistry between the characters existed. I had read the book and knew the story and this was faithful to that.

6163095,4,B00HHAX9BI,"Admittedly, I came to see a costumer based on  a work by P.D. James. Further, I never look for consistency between a dramatic production with actors and a written book. My attitude is pretty much that of the Old Hollywood Studios. Use the name of the original but make a movie  that people will want to see and enjoy when they see it. So, I leave any consideration aside from the television presentation and look at the thing in itself, what was seen on the screen.
I am not sufficiently expert to know how well the screenplay gave us a reasonable facsimile of the nature of the family, the justice system, and the relationship of both to the 'lower orders' of society. I found these elements quite interesting, in fact, the heart of the series. The action, particularly the ending, was more than a little melodramatic, though consistent with film tradition. Frankly, at times, I was more than a little confused trying to figure out who was doing what and why, but this was a minor distraction. Overall, after a slow start, I was caught up in the drama which overcame my general reluctance to see a costumer, these days, so long past the Grand Presentations of Hollywood's 'Golden Years' (I suppose, most prominently, Gone With The Wind), to women in dresses designed for show rather than utility (although an accurate reflection of the era when wealthy women were excluded from any productive labor save the bearing of children  and meant to be seen and appreciated as objects of beauty rather than as actors on the stage of life). I should think the average viewer, unsullied by familiarity with Jane Austen or P. D. James, will ignore the weakness in portrayal of the lower class and the subtleties of class distinction, and enjoy the three episodes as well-done evening soap opera.",1427155200,,1785,4.733118971061093

6163110,3,B00HHAX9BI,"Did the writers even read the book? The characters are all caricatures. Mrs. Bennet goes around saying, ""Mr. Bennet! Mr. Bennet"" all the time. That alone would not make her resemble the nervous, insecure, unaware, ill-mannered Mrs. Bennet of the book.

Darcy (in the book) was standoffish to those he didn't know. He was shy. He was gentle, warm, and loving to those he did know and love- like his sister. This Darcy isn't lovable at all- to anyone. Yuck. It hardly makes him the hero of Pemberly. Not to mention that if he and Elizabeth have a little one, and Lizzy and Mr. Wickham have no children, he's a bit too old to be Darcy in this storyline.

Elizabeth Bennet Darcy is quick witted, lively, and sharp. This Elizabeth is pretty dull not to mention too old for the part. (I like the actress, just not in this. To be fair, it's not her fault as much as it is the director's- same with Darcy. They are both fine actors).

If Lizzy and Wickham have been married several years, I am sure they both would be disillusioned by now. If the Wickhams were banned from Pemberly, I don't think they'd have the audacity to crash a party. And if the plan was to arrive so late that no one would complain, why come a day early? The plot just doesn't make sense. These people are incomprehensible.

It is suspenseful and the actors carry out their roles well.  I don't particularly agree with the choice of actors for the roles as some of the actor's physical appearances don't go with Austen's, but, as I mentioned, they do perform their roles very well.

I thought it was Ok.
Sadly,the lead of Elizabeth Bennet is terribly miscast. They have given us a washed out, almost 40 year old looking woman.is the point that marriage to the brooding Darcy has taken it's toll on her ?
 There is a plot point that didn't make sense to me, but all in all it is a leisurely paced period piece.
For Austen enthusiasts, all I can say is :The less you care about the characters, the better you'll enjoy it. For everyone else : don't get fixated on the actors. That helps alot.

Fleshes out Wickham characters well.

I have no problem with film adaptations of good books. And of course the filmed depiction will not be as rich as the book. But this was lazy adaptation, with gratuitous cuts and additions. And it felt like the actors and production people thought so too.

6163134,2,B00HHAX9BI,"In my opinion, both the book and the 3-part TV series are incredibly disappointing.  The book was illogical in the way in which its characters were introduced and interacted; the ending was maddeningly slapped together as though the train of thought had been hopelessly lost.  My issues with the movie are multiple, starting with the casting.  Anna Maxwell Martin as Lizzy was a mismatch from the get-go.  I have nothing against plain looking actors, but Lizzy's defining characteristic is her ""fine eyes"" and Ms. Martin's eyes are about as plain as any could ever be.  From there I simply could not accept her as Lizzy.  The TV series was rich and elaborate in its appointments, but the script differed to such an extent from the book, but it failed to address the lack of rational ordering of events and the odd reasonings behind the actions.  I so wanted this production to take me to the same places that Pride and Prejudice did so amazingly.  Perhaps I wanted it too badly, I'm not sure.  At the end I felt that I'd wasted my time on both the book and filmed series.",1424476800,10,1071,4.594736842105263

Both authors do a tremendous credit to the original Austen work by writing a seamless sequel; P.D. James is a brilliant writer and she doesn't fail to please with her novel, but Juliette Towhidi, who I have never heard of before, just blows me away with her screenwriting. Her adaptation of James' work literally creates different character storylines and actions and she should be given a huge amount of recognition for that. I saw the series first (before reading the book) and fell in love with it. The cinematography is incredible. The acting is top notch. As a whole, it is a wonderful series, as usual from a BBC endeavor. My only discomfort is that Darcy and Elizabeth sometimes come across as sneering and angry, maybe this is typical for character tension in murder mysteries?

I thought the characters were flat and the plot didn't hold my interest. This movie version, on the other hand, engaged me every step of the way. Anna Maxwell Martin may be a little on plain side for Elizabeth, but she is a wonderful actress and she conveyed Elizabeth's sensitivity and inner core of steel very well. Matthew Rhys made a very believable Darcy, who has to fight not to let his old stiff-necked prideful ways get the better of him.

Also, although I like Anna Maxwell Martin in other shows, her characterization of Elizabeth Bennett Darcy is a little painful to watch as she comes across as too plain, dull and shallow, and not at all like the vibrant beautiful character she is suppose to portray.

I had not read the book that this is based on, but I am a huge fan of Pride and Prejudice. My review is based on my understanding of the charcters in Pride and Prejudice, and so I will be asking questions that could spoil this video for you. This review is only for people who have already seen the video.

I did like this movie, and I watched it with someone who had no understanding of P&P--they loved the movie. I liked it, too--it's a nice little mystery. My concern is with the character of Colonel Fitzwilliam. Did anyone else find his meddling to be out of character? On the other hand, I did enjoy the way that Lydia shows herself to be not quite as stupid as Austen characterized her, and yet her development seems perfectly natural. It was the character of Colonel Fitzwilliam that bothered me most. What he does in this movie doesn't really fit with the character that I felt like I knew in P&P. Did anyone else have this impression? Did anyone find his character to be well-developed in the movie?",1421971200,,1086,4.7407407407407405

The characters were flat, the casting was all wrong, there was no witty dialog, and absolutely no concern for keeping within the period's fashion or social culture.  Horrible any way you look at it.  The actress who plays Lizzy is completely opposite as to how Lizzy looks and acts.  She is more wrinkled than me and I am in my forties, not to mention that she is no beauty.  Lizzy is vivacious, quick witted, and very pretty as well as young.  She was 20 when she married Darcy, thus in this novel she would be 25.  She looks way older and is a bad match to Darcy.  Plus she's very boring!  Darcy didn't fare any better!  This totally ruined my Lizzy and Darcy that I love.  I am off to read P & P for the 12th time.",1419724800,22,830,4.150943396226415

I was very disappointed in the choice of actors to play Elizabeth Bennet.  The book describes the character so differently in the book than was portrayed in this movie.  I've always seen Elizabeth as strong, independent.  While this movie does show her taking command, she doesn't fit the physicality of the book, especially 'her fine eyes'.  This actor seemed washed out and her eyes not distinguished  at all.  The PBS series was well cast with Jennifer Ehle who along with the superb acting, met the physicality of the character.  As far as the other characters the casting was well done but I just couldn't get past my disappointment in the person who tried to portray a most remarkable  and beloved character.",1419292800,15,849,4.840277777777778

The casting is terrible.  For example, the hero is a Rock Hudson look-alike who belongs on daytime General Hospital programs, and Elizabeth is too old and physically unattractive for the part.  The costumes are poor (Does Elizabeth only own one dress; don't all the women freeze in those skimpy outfits?), the bedroom scene is absurd, and the plot has a gigantic hole that renders the entire story nonsensical.

I felt that she was NOT THE HIGHTLIGHT of the DVD as she is expected in all of the books written about her including this author.  The background music to events in this movie just didn't do much to the entire program as seen with Colin Firth's Pride & Prejudice Program's music done in 1996.
I like the way Darcy and Lizzy care for their son as portrayed in this program. This reflects almost all of the ""P & P VARITIONS

Everyone seems perpetually unhappy, the lighting is consistently dim, a lonely piano provides a soulless soundtrack.  It is  a depressing affair.  Inexplicably, Elizabeth is suddenly in her mid-30s and seems constantly on the verge of a nervous breakdown.  You'd think she'd just weathered a war of some kind, given her gauntness, constant frown, and tired eyes.  What happened to the fit girl with the fine eyes who married Darcy just a few years previous?  The banter between the characters rarely rises above argumentative, uninspired banter.  Absent is Austen's cleverness.  On the upside, Matthew Goode is an excellent Wickham and Jenna Coleman steals every scene she is in as Lydia.  But ultimately, no, I can't accept this as part of the Austen universe.  It is sad to see what was done with her characters.",1418688000,15,896,5.068493150684931

6163270,2,B00HHAX9BI,"Having just finished the book by P.D. James (which I enjoyed, but it did lack the Austen humor and wit, but then, it was a mystery), I was looking forward to seeing the movie version of the book. I couldn't have been more disappointed.

Starting with the casting, while I think most were cast well, the choice of Anna Maxwell Martin as Elizabeth, was a terrible choice.  While Ms. Martin is a wonderful actress, she didn't work as the beautiful 26 year-old Elizabeth and lacked the charm and wit Elizabeth was known for.  Ms. Martin was dull and haggard-looking and it was a huge distraction.

Next, and this was my biggest complaint, was that it veered so far from the book, that I had a hard time even recognizing it. I don't even know how many times I said, out loud, ""That didn't happen in the book!"" If the idea is to do a movie based off the book, then for crying out loud, stay as closely to the book as possible!  I understand making creative choices, but these were far beyond ""creative"" choices, they completely changed the storyline, and NOT in a good way.

****SPOILERS AHEAD****

Darcy seemed to revert to the old stuck in the mud version that Elizabeth was supposed to have changed, but became very animated at the strangest times.

Elizabeth is questioning her marriage to Darcy and feels that Darcy resents her and her family.... WHAT?  That never happened in the book and to me, that was a huge deviation that was absolutely not necessary and ruined the movie for me.

Mr. Fitzwilliam is no longer fun and kind Colonel Fitzwilliam, he is now a total a**hole. He's decided he wants Georgianna as his wife, but she would rather have Mr. Alveston, who is younger and, while not rich, he has the potential of being so and... she's in love with him.  While this did happen in the book, Colonel Fitzwilliam was jealous of Mr. Alveston's attention on Georgianna, but he was not a complete prig.  That whole storyline was yet another huge deviation from the book.  Darcy didn't try to push Fitzwilliam on Georgianna, nor did she turn Mr. Alveston away.

Louisa Bidwell storyline, totally screwed up from the book's version as well.  You know, I could go on and on and on about all the things they changed from book to film, but suffice it to say, they should never have said it was based on the book.

Again, most of the casting was wonderful, especially Jenna Coleman as Lydia Wickham and Matthew Goode as George Wickham, it was the storyline that was totally screwed up.

Costuming: WHAT THE HECK?!?  The Darcy's are some of the most wealthy in the country and yet, I don't think Elizabeth had a new dress the whole movie, while Lydia had many wonderful dresses.

So, all-in-all, I feel that I wasted three hours of my time watching a show I had to stop watching for awhile because I was so upset with how much they changed and it was B.O.R.I.N.G.  Had I not read the book, I wouldn't have understood what the heck was going on.

Bottomline: I am a huge fan of BBC miniseries, but don't waste your time or money on this stinker.",1417996800,19,3039,4.509124087591241

I was very surprised that Death Comes to Pemberley was available on DVD while the show was still airing on TV.  And, I marveled that the initial price of the DVD was extremely reasonable at Amazon.  I did like the plot, and it was interesting to see actors, familiar to me from roles they'd played in other films, playing roles of Pride-and-Prejudice characters continued via Death Comes to Pemberley.

Ladies of that period in her social status changed their clothes several times a day and dressed for dinner most elegantly (several museum trips have convinced me); but It didn't detract too much and I could overlook it.  Some people might say she wasn't pretty enough, but when I originally read the story I pictured someone rather plain but outspoken and in all the movies she is played by a great beauty.

Everything that made Pride and Prejudice magnificent--the sparkling dialogue, the delightful fully-realized characters, the scintillating humor and incisive social insight--is completely missing in this bizarre pseudo-adaptation.  Some of the major characters here--Lizzy, Colonel FitzWilliam--are not remotely like their prototypes in Jane Austen's masterpiece.  I don't understand why anyone would take a mildly interesting murder mystery and graft it (utterly inauthentically) onto one of the most brilliant novels in the English language--except, of course, to make money off Austen's reputation.

I was so excited about this production, and couldn't wait until it was available in the US. What a disappointment!
The main flaws are the woefull miscasting of the main characters -Matthew Rhys as Darcy, and the even worse cast Anna Maxwell Martin as Lizzie.

The Darcys seemed tired and completely disillusioned with life- not at all what you would expect from a sequel to a great love story. Rhys was very severe and for the most part unlikable. Very dour with no hint of charm. Martin seemed a much better choice for the character of Lizzie's plain and fusty sister Mary Bennett. I'm sorry to say she was far too plain and cranky. Again, wholly lacking the charm and vivacity required of Lizzie's character.
Lydia's actor was very over the top and exaggerated. She seemed decidedly out of place with her complexion. The makeup on Georgiana and Lizzie was too modern and distracting.
Most of the other portrayals were nice, especially Wickham who had the perfect blend of charm, angst, and villainy. I would say he was ideally rendered.

Of course, this is a murder mystery and perhaps, therefore, is ""supposed"" to be ""deadly serious.""  But the all too brief and very welcome appearance of Penelope Keith as a perfect Lady Catherine reminded me what I was missing - that sense of teasing fun so endemic to Austen's novels - it sweeps in with Lady Catherine and leaves when she does.

In the book, Elizabeth had a moment of feeling faint and sat down and longed for Darcy, and he appeared soon after and went to her and pulled her up and gently pulled her to him.

Ok, maybe it wasn't THAT bad, but I did use a Lost in Austen (2008) quote on purpose. Mainly because THEY at least understood the characters.
This...continuation/adaptation starts out like CSI: Pemberly, and ends up feeling like The Young and The Restless. Either way, Jane Austen it is not. It felt more like someone had a great idea for a tale and kind of decided to force Austen's characters into it, rather than adding to the original story. It was missing much of the sparkle and intelligence of the original P&P. Witty, era-appropriate reparte' has been supplanted by about 5 minutes of an annoying sort of comic relief, and that is really only supplied by two characters. Modern phrases creep in (like, ya know...?), and most characters bear little resemblance to their original personalities.
Darcy is cranky (not ""brooding"" - just plain cranky), and apparently wasn't punished enough in P&P, so we find ourselves still rehashing his issues with class distinctions. *sigh*  Elizabeth, rather than helping her husband lighten up, seems to have become less outspoken and more somber. She and Darcy spend most of their time glaring at or avoiding each other. Colonel Fitzwilliam probably takes the brunt of the re-written characters, poor guy. And not really for any good reason. Possibly the only one who hasn't changed in a noticeable way is Georgiana. Some old characters make an appearance, but their rapid DISappearances make one wonder if they were only there to attract Austen purists.
At times, the story line is very slow. I felt that they took three hours to cover a story that really only needed an hour and a half. Also, I must add that I was particularly disappointed by a unexpected intimate scene toward the end of episode three. It was more than unnecessary - more like a cheap and desperate attempt to spice up characters that, if done properly, shouldn't need any extra spice (as evidenced by 200 years of enduring, and even increasing, popularity).  That scene alone probably DOES have Austen spinning in her grave.
I would have liked it better as a stand-alone mini-series, with some caveats. Definitely heed the maturity rating. I doubt I'll come back to this one.",1416528000,10,2312,4.956185567010309
6163324,4,B00HHAX9BI,"Death Comes to Pemberly is the first Austen-sequel, either in print or on film, that I've found satisfying.  I don't like murder mysteries, but this isn't quite that.  It's also not quite Pride and Prejudice.  I agree with other reviews;  if you're looking for the characters from A&E's version to resurrect after the final credits and keep on being themselves and enacting sparkling drawing-room drama for your continued gratification, then this isn't going to make you happy at all.  This isn't P&P the second.  If that's what you want, this may not be your cup of tea.

The cast does a commendable job in their respective roles, but I have to wonder about the casting. Darcy and Col. Fitzwilliam are often difficult to tell apart when Fitz isn't in uniform and they're not in the same scene.  Anna Maxwell-Martin, for some reason, displayed none of Lizzie Bennett's wit and spark, while Jenna Coleman was unable to dull down her obvious intelligence and power to fit herself into Lydia's small wit and narrow understanding. I've loved Martin's other period film work, but here, I wonder why they didn't cast Coleman as Elizabeth?  She's such an obvious choice that it's distracting to watch them.

Despite that, I thoroughly enjoyed ""Death Comes to Pemberly"", and will watch it again.  It's a well-made period drama masterfully adapted from a novel by an accomplished writer. The performances are excellent, if not strictly to canon.  Production values are all one would expect from BBC period-film these days.  The story is a bit contrived (what murder-mystery isn't?) in retrospect, but I didn't really notice or care in the moment, I was too absorbed.",1416528000,,1657,4.9601449275362315

6163334,2,B00HHAX9BI,"If only costuming and location could earn a period drama 5 stars!  Many supporting characters were well cast, and Penelope Keith is, well, wonderful as Lady Catherine. But the equally wonderful Anna Martin comes up short as Elizabeth Bennett Darcy, despite solid performances in other period dramas (Becoming Jane, Bleak House and North & South).  As others have pointed out, there is no sparkle, little vivacity or lightness, and no chemistry between Lizzie/Anna and Matthew/Darcy. As others have pointed out, there is no sparkle, no vivacity or lightness, and no chemistry between Lizzie/Anna and Matthew/Darcy. (altho there are hints in her interactions with Lady Catherine) It isn't Ms Martin's appearance (doesn't Mrs. Darcy of Pemberley have more than one green dress?) or acting ability. She has the talent, and a wonderfully striking face, not traditionally beautiful, yet mobile, full of sweetness and expression. She comes across as dowdy and dull, her costuming frumpily uninspired (doesn't Mrs. Darcy of Pemberley have more than one green dress?) making Martin look at least ten years older than 'Lizzie' should be.

It's hard to tell if Darcy is miscast or just badly written. P&P's Darcy there is smoldering passion, barely contained. Darcy in 'Death Comes...' is just moldering. Oh, there were hints of fire in the opening scenes, but those sparks were quickly extinguished by the script's pedantic dialog.

<SPOILER ALERT! If you've not watched and plan too, skip to the bottom>

Key to the plot is the Bidwell infant, Georgy. The story given is that Louisa, a former housemaid and younger daughter of an upper servant at Pemberly, has brought her older sister's newborn home to give her sister 'some respite'.  We're so co-opted by babies being breast OR bottle fed that we utterly, totally miss this gaping hole in the storyline: There were NO, no, no good alternatives to breast feeding an infant. Period. Oh, there were make do solutions, and women of status and means might hire a wetnurse.  But when the infant's mother is alive and well and capable? Even if there'd been complications, it's more likely that Louisa would've stayed to help, so Georgy could be fed. It may seem minor, but it's a storyline equivalent Colonel Fitzwilliam driving up to Pemberly in a Range Rover, or 'young Darcy' gaming on and iPad.

The supporting cast, the location, the 19th century world created around the main cast rescue 'Death Comes...'  As a period piece, this is fun romp. As a Lizzie/Darcy vehicle, it falls short.",1416096000,6,2528,5.0576923076923075

6163336,4,B00HHAX9BI,"The camera is in love with the magnificent estate at Pemberley as well as the beautiful surrounding woods, thick with ferns and trees embracing each other but also capable of being menacing when the dappled light becomes dark and mysterious.  The scenes of the vast estate, the green, green lawns, the magnificent horses, the graceful statues and inside the splendor and sumptuous accouterments of vast wealth are breathtaking. Episode One  opens with Darcy and Elizabeth preparing for a ball.

Like many other reviewers I feel Anna Maxwell Martin as Lizzie is jarring - Elizabeth should be the pivotal force behind the novel, behind this film.  Elizabeth as described by Jane Austen was not only pretty, she sparkled with life and enthusiasm. We first encounter the film Elizabeth wearing an ill-fitting green frock, her hair disheveled, she isn't wearing a spot of makeup. Her servants look better than she does. The chatelaine of a magnificent estate like Pemberley wouldn't be seen dead dressed like Anna Maxwell Martin. Matthew Rhys as Darcy, a bit pigheaded and stubborn but handsome follows the Austen canon in the hands of P.D.James. But when he and Elizabeth appear together in scenes of ""Pemberley"" they do not physically match.

In many respects ""Death at Pemberley"" is a handsome  production, eye candy, really, and suspenseful enough, leaving you before the second episode with a murder and a strange woman in the woods. The unknown lady is dressed in regal purple but spits at Elizabeth when the two encounter each other.

This series is well worth watching- it would be worth watching for the beauty of the photography alone But I am giving the film four stars  rather than five, based on the miscasting of Elizabeth.

6163341,2,B00HHAX9BI,"I will set aside the very questionable idea of transporting Jane Austen's beloved characters into a murder mystery.  Uneasy though I was with the concept, I read the book anyway because I have read Pride and Prejudice many times and I can never get enough of Elizabeth and Darcy.  I did not care for Death Comes to Pemberly but nevertheless watched the movie because, well, more Elizabeth and Darcy.  What a disappointment!

I was shocked by the inexplicable miscasting of Anna Maxwell Martin as Elizabeth Bennett.  When she first appeared I felt she surely could not be playing Lizzy.  Jane Austen's Lizzy was vivacious, irreverent, joyful and second only to her sister, Jane, in beauty.  Could six years of marriage to Darcy have turned her into this somber, frumpy and dull woman who seemed to be chronically depressed?

I like Martin as an actress but in her roles that I have seen she has always been very low key and serious, even somber and always very plain in physical appearance.  She was surely not an obvious choice to portray Elizabeth Bennett.  Perhaps if she had had prettier makeup and more attractive clothing and maybe if she had managed to look happy once in a while I could have seen something of Lizzy in her.  As it was, makeup, costuming and direction conspired to eliminate any similarity to the Elizabeth Bennett created by Jane Austen.

I do not even bother to mention any other facets of this production because, for me, the loss of Elizabeth Bennett, who is the heart and soul of Pride and Prejudice, made the entire film a sad disappointment.  The only way I managed to watch the whole thing was to keep repeating to myself, ""This is just a period drama.  It has nothing to do with Pride and Prejudice, or Elizabeth and Darcy"".  Only on those terms was it a modestly entertaining murder mystery.",1415923200,17,1824,4.6918238993710695

However, this Elizabeth looks very weather beaten and sorry, unattractive. In a world where freckles and sunspots are considered uncouth, she is filled with a chest of them. Her age, after six years of marriage, would have been late twenties, so why could she pass for forty five? Her hair, or lack of it, her shabby attire were very off putting. The plot of P&P revolves around Darcy becoming so enamored of Elizabeth's sparkling eyes and personality, that he tosses convention to the wind to court and marry her.

6163359,5,B00HHAX9BI,"This film was brilliant, and Anna Maxwell Martin and Matthew Rhys gave outstanding performances.  I thought they presented a realistic, compelling picture of Lizzy and Darcy and their life at Pemberley, particularly as they are faced with a crisis that could be extremely damaging to Pemberley. The supporting cast was superb. Rhys exuded presence and power and was a very credible Darcy. He quite convincingly humbled himself when he realized he was mistaken.  I have always been a lover of Colin Firth's Darcy - but Rhys was superb and ranks right up there with Firth.  Maxwell Martin perfectly captured Lizzy's intelligence, expressions and compassion. Lizzy and Darcy alternately argued, flirted with, and loved each other, as we could imagine they would in their marriage.

I know people will say that Maxwell Martin was not pretty enough to portray Lizzy.  But she so accurately captured Lizzy's character that, in the end, I don't think it mattered.  Her performance ranks right up there with Jennifer Ehle's, and easily surpasses the performance of Keira Knightley.  Her appearance could have been improved if she had worn more elegant clothing - her outfits and accessories appeared a bit dowdy, and her bonnet and brown coat were downright ugly. The other women's clothing (Georgiana's, Jane's) was much finer than hers - this didn't make sense, given Lizzy's rank as Mistress of Pemberley.  Additionally, if the producers of the 1995 could put a wig on Ehle, they could have done so on Maxwell Martin, which might have given her a more elegant appearance.  At least - thank goodness - the women didn't have to wear those stupid white caps!

There were some surprises.  Darcy stated that Alveston came from a good family, but he was a lawyer (solicitor?). In the Regency era, wouldn't Georgiana have been pushed to marry a gentleman, not a lawyer? And it was surprising to see Colonel Fitzwilliam playing a secretive, shady character. How on earth would he have connected and negotiated with Mrs. Younge?  Not a flattering portrayal, but it did fit in with the plot. So if you missed this on Masterpiece Theater, get the DVD or Blu-Ray - it's well worth it.",1415491200,,2167,4.955801104972376
6163360,2,B00HHAX9BI,"Anna Maxwell Martin is a fine interesting actor.  Nonetheless, what an unnecessary disappointment caused by the miscasting of Anna Maxwell Martin (Elizabeth)  and Matthew Rhys (Darcy).  A missed opportunity to provide a credible post Darcy & Elizabeth marriage series.  The cinematography and setting were beautiful.  Pemberly inside and outside fabulous.  The casting of the main characters is incomprehensible.  Why deviate from the canon?

Darcy is described in the canon as tall and handsome while Elizabeth is described as second to Jane in beauty with fine eyes.  Yet, Darcy and Elizabeth are plain  and appear too old. Elizabeth's appearance was not that of a wealthy woman. Her sister-in-law, Georgiana, was beautifully coiffed and dressed.  Why the distracting contrast.

Mathew Rhys (Darcy) is 5'11"" and Matthew Goode (Wickham)
is 6'2"". The height difference seemed even greater.  Rhys appears to be about 5'8"".  There was a particularly distracting scene where plain & shorter Darcy looks up into the eyes of handsome and tall Wickham while they are facing each other talking.  Every aspect of Darcy was unimposing.

Matthew Goode (Wickham) and
Jenna Coleman (Lydia) were excellent!

6163375,3,B00HHAX9BI,"When it was announced that P.D. James had written a murder-mystery sequel to the classic novel Pride & Prejudice, I had mixed feelings about it.  After all, I've been a pretty vocal opponent of P&P sequels as most tend to fail in capturing the original's wit, humor, and sparkle.  However, I also knew that James is a very talented author, with a great respect for Austen.  Sadly, procrastination took over and I still haven't managed to read the book.  So I was quite excited when I saw the first ads for this Masterpiece adaptation; after all, I love Matthew Rhys on FX's The Americans and have been a fan of Anna Maxwell-Martin since I saw her in Bleak House (although I already felt a twinge of anxiety over her casting as Elizabeth--Jennifer Ehle's superlative version of the character in the 1995 miniseries [the gold standard of P&P adaptations] is pretty much the standard against which I measure all other versions, and as much as I admire Maxwell-Martin, I just couldn't picture her as Lizzie).  So, this was bound to be a good adaptation, right?  Eh, not so much, unfortunately.

First, to the good bits:  The casting of Matthew Goode as Wickham was inspired as Matthew is quite handsome with a wicked twinkle in his eyes--it's quite easy to see him using his looks and charm to get away with murder.  And while I may not particularly like her on Doctor Who, as the spoiled and frivolous Lydia, Jenna Coleman was perfection, dare I say even better than Julia Sawalha.  (Sacrilege, I know, but it's true.)  As Georgiana Darcy, Eleanor Tomlinson was a perfect combination of radiant innocence and budding sexual awakening.  Other supporting players such as Tom Ward as Col. Fitzwilliam and Joanna Scanlan as Mrs. Reynolds made the best of minor parts.  Even Stephanie Cole, who played the devilish Diana on the show Waiting for God several years back, did a passable job as Lady Catherine de Bourgh.  As for the actual filming of the program, with locations such as Chatsworth House for exterior shots of Pemberley and the landscapes of West Yorkshire for Pemberley's extensive woodlands, well, you really can't complain about the quality.

Now to the not-so-good bits:  The story, on the whole, felt quite lightweight, and the ""mystery"" not only felt less than mysterious, it also seemed to take a backseat to other story issues, even as the characters worked to solve said mystery, if that makes sense.  But it was still entertaining to watch, in its own way.  However, the biggest blunder of all was the casting of the two main characters.  Matthew as Mr. Darcy wasn't the worst; he did manage to capture Darcy's stiffness and occasional bouts of haughty pride.  That said, I didn't get the same sort of smoldering passion that bubbled beneath Darcy's rather stand-offish demeanor, something that Colin Firth pulled off so well, to the delight of thousands of female fans (and male ones, too, no doubt).  And, yes, that includes me--I admit to swooning over his breech-clad thighs and the white shirt clinging to his chest in the pond swimming scene.  But my initial twinge of anxiety turned out to be right on the mark when it came to Anna Maxwell-Martin, the biggest casting misstep.  As much as I like her as an actress, Anna was no Lizzie.  Firstly, and this is the fault of both the costume and makeup designer, Lizzie was turned into a dowd.  She was frumpy and colorless, lacking the vivacity her character is famous for.  Where was the pert Lizzie, the Lizzie who gleefully made fun of Darcy's snobbery, the Lizzie who stood toe-to-toe with Lady Catherine de Bourgh and came out the winner?  This Lizzie was instead rather sour and a bit of a scold, not how I imagined that half of a famous romantic couple turning out.  Not to be cruel, but while Anna isn't ugly, her looks aren't what I'd associate with Elizabeth, not to mention, at 36 and looking it, she's a bit too long in the tooth for Lizzie, a new mother who's actually about a decade younger.  And, I'm sorry, but after seeing Jennifer Ehle's ample bosom on display in the '95 miniseries, Anna's, um, deficiency in that department was made even more obvious.  Frankly, on just about all points, Anna missed the mark.

I so wanted to love this program, but while it was mildly entertaining, I can't say it's a worthy sequel.  Certainly not worthy enough to sit next to my Blu-ray of the '95 miniseries.",1415232000,4,4381,4.723684210526316
6163376,3,B00HHAX9BI,"Loved the setting, cast, acting, but very disappointed with the ending. Yes, if the book and DVD are a match in every way, then I am also disappointed with the author - sorry PD James. If you don't want to know the ending, then don't read on. The story is a good murder mystery and there are a variety of possible suspects. The obvious suspect is the brother of the married couple owning the manor. He has opportunity and even some motive in wanting to cover up an affair. His wife also has motive, since she knows about the ""rascal"" she has married, but lacks opportunity. Instead of pinning the murder on the General, since he had opportunity (he went for a ride in the woods) and motive (proved it by manipulating and control others in order to cover up any views/gossip that would taint his betrothed family name). Instead, the author/director pins the murder on a sickly lad that simply strikes a person he thinks is the boyfriend to the housemaid (also his sister) with very little motive other than he wants to protect the women in the home. This would be a possible motive, except that HE KNEW the housemaid/sister wanted to be reunited with her boyfriend. Knowing this he strikes the boyfriend? This does not fit. If I had a sister and all she talked about was being reunited with her boyfriend, then when the boyfriend shows up at the door I would be happy for my sister and welcome the boyfriend (perhaps grudgingly, but not enough to kill him) into the apartment. The only motive to strike the boyfriend would be if the sickly lad was so disgusted by his sister becoming pregnant out of wedlock that he tikes the boyfriend in an attempt to scare him off. This motive, however, was not provided in the movie leaving him as a poor choice for murdering (even by mistake) the boyfriend. Clearly the General had greater motive and greater opportunity. I would have given this movie 5 stars, but was so discouraged by the ending that I had to write this criticism and give it only 3 stars.",1415145600,,1995,4.529085872576177
6163377,3,B00HHAX9BI,"Mostly a review of the DVD: Disappointed to discover that the program is still in its original BBC three parts, including credits at the beginning and end of each, rather than edited together as one fluid piece (it was shown in the U.S. in two parts). Not a deal-breaker, but annoying, particularly as at the end of each episode the DVD defaults to the main menu rather than continuing to the next episode. The program is also wrapped in PBS Masterpiece titles, including the opening Gorey sequence, Viking Cruise and Ralph Lauren commercials, main contributors, and ""Viewers Like You"" before Part 1 (can be manually skipped), and end titles after each episode. We are, at least, spared trailers and previews. On the plus side, this does appear to be the original 3-hr BBC version, unedited, rather than the somewhat cut-down version shown on PBS, by my estimation some 10 or 12 additional minutes. The color and clarity are gorgeous; some of the additional shots are spectacular landscapes. The shortcomings of the plot, script, and cast have been widely discussed elsewhere, as have the finer points. Probably best saved for Janeites; I doubt the plot will make much sense to those not familiar with P&P.",1415145600,3,1206,4.916666666666667
6163378,2,B00HHAX9BI,Incredibly dull and plodding. The lead that plays Elizabeth Bennet is horribly miscast. To be nice she is rather plain and doesn't match Austen's description of Elizabeth in the least. Matthew Rhys is great in the Americans. However he seems miscast in his role as Mr. Darby as well. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the sets are beautiful. Too bad they are wasted on this production.,1415145600,4,396,4.591549295774648
6163379,3,B00HHAX9BI,"""Death Comes to Pemberley"" is a BBC dramatization of P.D. James' 2011 novel of the same name, which weaves a murder mystery around the estate of Pemberley and the characters from Jane Austen's 1813 novel ""Pride and Prejudice"". There is no need to be familiar with that novel in order to understand the mystery, though some background information helps to explain the family's social situation. Elizabeth ""Lizzie"" Darcy (ne Bennett)(Anna Maxwell Martin) lives at Pemberley with husband Fitzwilliam Darcy (Matthew Rhys) and their young son and is currently immersed in preparations for the Lady Anne Ball. On the eve of the ball, Lizzie's wayward sister Lydia (Jenna Coleman) arrives hysterical at the house, after her husband George Wickham (Matthew Goode) left her carriage following an argument with their friend Capt. Denny (Tom Canton), plunging into the dark woods, after which 2 shots were heard. Darcy organizes a search party, which finds Capt. Denny dead with a drunk George Wickham over the body, blubbering that he has killed his friend. The magistrate, Sir Selwyn Hardcastle (Trevor Eve) is summoned to investigate.

This is an entertaining mystery that incorporates and expands upon the personalities of characters from ""Pride and Prejudice"", especially those of the Wickhams. The cast is generally good, most notably Jenna Coleman for her portrayal of Lydia as comically oblivious, fun-loving, but somehow dedicated to her disreputable husband and cognizant of her situation as it grows more dire. Matthew Goode is roguishly charismatic as George Wickham, Eleanor Tomlinson charming as Darcy's sister Georgiana, and Nichola Burley empathetic as the daughter of Pemberley's head coachman (Philip Martin Brown), who is entangled in the intrigue. Unfortunately, the principal cast does not fare as well as the supporting cast. Darcy is unlikable. Worse, Anna Maxwell Martin is too old to play Lizzie Darcy by 10 years and looks too old by 20 years. She is an oppressive, lethargic, nagging presence. Her demeanor and line delivery are all wrong. She frowns for the entire film. There is no levity or energy or charm, in stark contrast to Jenna Coleman. I don't think I've ever seen a part so blatantly (and avoidably) miscast. Any twenty-something actress would have been better.",1415145600,2,2289,5.271232876712329
6163380,4,B00HHAX9BI,"How many people have envisioned what might happen to the Darcys post wedlock? This series certainly indulges that desire, and the fact that Pemberley was the same house used by Joe Wright in his adaptation of Pride and Prejudice created a wonderful link between the two stories. Anna Maxwell Martin makes a wonderful Elizabeth: what makes her so lovely is a face that is not in synch with contemporary standards of beauty, but a realistic one from times past which radiates both strength and kindness. As well Matthew Rhys really does make for a perfect Darcy for the same reasons, his is a face which bears a handsomeness from another era, and he masters the ""Pride"" which would come with his rank in society. We all knew who Wickam was, and that there was no possible way he and Lydia could live happily ever after. While Elizabeth's beloved sister Jane does make a brief appearance, this piece never stoops to the sentiment of throwing everyone back together again in a joyful Bennet family reunion simply to placate viewers.

This isn't about the language of Jane Austen, and there are some unlikely and slightly anachronistic moments, however, it is good fun, the acting is very convincing, and it left me wishing to somehow be able to stay in touch with the Darcy Family through another story!",1415145600,2,1299,4.773333333333333
6163381,4,B00HHAX9BI,"This was an interesting idea by top mystery writer P. D. James about death coming to the home of Mr. Darcy and Lizzie from Pride and Prejudice.  The trouble is that they were so physically unlike what most representations of them are, attractive, tall, handsome, and pretty and spirited, that the production fell flat for me.  Almost all of the characters from Pride and Prejudice make a cameo appearance, but Rebecca Front, the superintendant from the Lewis mysteries, isn't nearly as silly as one might expect.  The real winner for me is the scenery and Chatsworth, the mansion in Derbyshire said to have been the original model for Pemberley.  The side story of who Georgiana will marry was interesting enough, but making certain characters into the 'villains' turn out to be very labored at times, and other revelations just odd.  Still, this is better than most things on TV these days, and an escapist way to pass a few hours in the company of 'old friends'.",1415145600,3,964,4.783132530120482

Darcy has none of the charm or wit evidenced in other adaptations. What's with Fitzwilliam? He is sour and dry. Lydia and Mrs. Bennet are over played, and Wickham is just boring.

There was no witty conversation, few memorable characters, no social engagements or balls plus Lizzie didn't change her dress the entire time and Darcy's sister wore nightgowns that seemed 2 sizes too big. For a costume period drama this was a disgrace. Colonel Fitzwilliam had a tear on his red coat collar. Even Lady Catherine was not herself. If nothing else I expected more from the period side of this or some of Austen's humorous characters present, and I think they did try but everything fell flat.

Particularly, Anna Maxwell Martin as Lizzie Bennett Darcy, is a haggard, rumpled scold.  The blooming, laughing Lizzie of earlier productions is non-existent here. This miscasting or mis-writing of her character is disappointing and distracting. Rhys is fine as Darcy but without the sexy fire of Firth or McFadyn.

6163396,4,B00HHAX9BI,"It's finally come to America! I saw clips of this on YouTube and was really excited about it finally airing on PBS/being available on Amazon. It's a good cross between period drama and murder mystery, with the added bonus of featuring a take on some of the most beloved English literary characters. I've been a fan of Anna Maxwell Martin since Bleak House and North & South and she again displays her acting talent in her portrayal of Lizzie. Jenna Louise Coleman is a joy to watch and the perfect Lydia (as  a Doctor Who fan, it's great to see her playing a character other than Clara). However, my main reason for watching this, besides it being a P&P continuation, was Mathew Rhys and his performance too was very good.

Yet while the acting was good, and the plot interesting, I really didn't care for the way in which Lizzie's and Darcy's personalities were altered to fit the plot. I found myself cringing every time the two were together. For me, what I loved about P&P is that it showed how a relationship can grow and strengthen as two people get to understand and respect one another. I'd have preferred a more relaxed Darcy when around Lizzie and for her to have been more understanding of him. Their harshness and uneasiness around one another was for me a major distraction from what was otherwise a well though out and engaging story. There is some excellent fan fiction available that depicts their relationship much better and yet also preserves their canon characteristics when they interact with others. Were it not for those stories, I might be more accepting of how the writers chose to portray them. However, their interaction was just too out of character for me to really love this use of such beloved characters.

While it's great to see a P&P sequel, this might actually have been better had it been a murder mystery set in the same time but with original characters.",1414713600,11,1892,4.658682634730539

6163398,5,B00HHAX9BI,"October, 1803, it is the day before Pemberley hosts the annual Lady Anne ball. ""The first ball had taken place when Darcy was a year old. It was held to celebrate the birthday of his mother and, except for the period of mourning when her husband died, the ball was held every year until Lady Anne's own death.""

Elizabeth and Darcy have continued the ball since their marriage 6 years before; it is the social highlight of the year.  Silver is being polished, fires have been set, the menu is completed and sufficient White Soup prepared. The family and early visitors are enjoying music when they are startled to see a coach round the corner to the front door at breakneck speed. The carriage holds only a hysterical Lydia Wickham, Elizabeth's sister. She, her husband and Captain Denny had been traveling to Pemberley to crash the ball - for of course, Wickham would never be invited. Denny and Wickham argued, Denny stopped the carriage in the middle of Pemberley Wood and got out. He strode off into the woods and Wickham followed. After two shots were heard, the horses spooked and they didn't stop until they got to Pemberley.

One would almost hope that the odious Wickham was shot, but, no, it is Captain Denny who is dead. But Wickham is the prime suspect. This would be bad news in any case, but it is very bad news in 1803 England. Darcy is legally Wickham's brother, and legally means he could lose Pemberley over it, much less loss of social standing.

""Death Comes to Pemberley"" is based on the book of the same name, written by P.D. James (2011). The quote in the 1st paragraph is from the book. The TV series first aired in England in December, 2013. This 1 disc DVD release has 180 minutes of pleasing historical drama. It's presented in 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen.with English subtitles available. The DVD has no bonus extras.

I was predisposed to love this series because I love mysteries and I love Pride & Prejudice (P&P). The 1995 mini-series, with Colin Firth as Darcy, is my Jane Austen gold-standard, and ""Death Comes to Pemberley"" (DCB) does a good job of replicating the feel of that series. I love the tie-ins with the 1995 series (and so, also, with Austen's novel).

For example, in P&P, Colonel Fitzwilliam is a ""poor"" younger son who may not marry where he wishes. In DCB, Fitzwilliam's older brother has died, and he has inherited the family fortune. Now, he wants to be married and has set his sights on a certain young lady. This echos the famous 1st line of the P&P novel:  ""It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.""

There's also Mrs. Bennett, in ""Death Comes to Pemberley"", saying, ""Somewhere inside, I'm still a young girl in love with a redcoat."" Not to mention the reappearance of her palpitations.

At times in DCB, they've recreated scenes from P&P, such as Elizabeth remembering when charming Wickham told her how abominably he'd been treated by Darcy. And there's other remembrances, too, such as when Elizabeth recalls an earlier Lady Anne ball. Standing on the side, she can't help but overhear two snobs disparage her: ""I wonder if Darcy is regretting his choice of a bride.""  I liked that touch, because it's real. Lady Catherine DeBourgh would not be the only person who was shocked when they heard that Darcy was to marry beneath him.

It takes strength of character and confidence to be able to slough off cruel remarks like that. And Anna Maxwell Martin's portrayal of Elizabeth shows that. Her portrayal of Elizabeth is not as sparkly as Jennifer Ehle in the 1995 series, but then Elizabeth is now a mother with a huge estate to help run. Admittedly, Martin at first seemed too plain to me to be a creditable Elizabeth, but as I got into the show, I concentrated more on the personality than the looks and came to appreciate her portrayal.

In addition, the producer decided that ""Death Comes to Pemberley"" would be shot without make-up for more realism. There is no one who doesn't look different without makeup.

This show has more than one story thread, with love, loyalty and reputation (including love of reputation) entwined. And there is always George Wickham to shake your fist at and Lydia Wickham to shake your head at.

6163404,5,B00HHAX9BI,"I must first confess that I am a huge Matthew Rhys fan after watching him on THE AMERICANS. So unlike everyone else, I was excited to hear he was playing Darcy. I loved Colin Firth in the role but I was more than willing to see Rhys give it a go. Of course, this was not a redo of PRIDE & PREJUDICE. Instead it was a mystery set around Darcy and Elizabeth's life years later while they are having their young family at Pemberley.

The gist of the mystery is that Darcy is having a party. Wickham and Lydia are not invited. So of course they travel to the party anyway. They have another officer traveling with them, Denny. Denny dies in the woods just outside of Pemberley and Wickham becomes the immediate suspect. This places Darcy in the unfortunate position of being forced to hire defense counsel for Wickham since he is still family, married to his wife's sister.

But there are other complications as well. His cousin, the Colonel, comes courting Georgianna, his sister. Darcy is very in favor of the match but Elizabeth foresees trouble ahead with this match. Darcy, as pig headed as ever, will not listen to her. Because of this mess on their doorstep, suddenly other family members show up at Pemberley, causing further havoc. There is Lady Catherine, Mrs. Bennett, the Bingleys, Mr. Bennett, other Bennett sisters and so forth.

The only wrong note I detected in the whole production is that Elizabeth is made very plain, almost homely. The novel was very clear that Elizabeth was the second prettiest girl in their village. I think the actress could have looked much better but they seemed to have gone out of their way to make every bad hair, makeup and costume choice so as to NOT flatter her in any way. I have no idea why this glaring an error was made.

However, P&P rises or falls based upon Darcy and I loved Matthew Rhys as Darcy some years later. His interpretation is very different from Firth's but it is a valid one as Darcy has been a family man for some years now and his concerns are very different from when he was an eligible bachelor making his social rounds. Rhys also captures Darcy's tendency to being a hardhead and strong willed. Yet they are played skillfully against his other character traits, such as love for Elizabeth and the rest of his family and his care of every person and aspect of his estate. This now even includes Wickham and his scenes with him are wonderful.

I read the book too which is a bit different from the series but not in any significant way for the viewer. I liked the changes the series made.

6163405,5,B00HHAX9BI,"Elizabeth Bennet, the most successful disposal in marriage of the five daughters of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet of Longboum, is a heroine to be admired in the books of Miss Jane Austen who wrote novels dealing with issues of manner, upbringing, morality, education and marriage in the society of the landed gentry of early 19th century England. In Austen's PRIDE & PREJUDICE (1813) Elizabeth, the second of five daughters, marries Mr. Darcy, the most desirable gentleman owner of the vast estate of Pemberley.

In 2011, in a witty and inventive homage to Miss Austen, P. D. James continues the story of Elizabeth and Darcy in DEATH COMES TO PEMBERLEY. James, the grand dame of British mysteries, the creator of Commander Adam Dalgliesch of Scotland Yard, throws in a murder in the woodland near Pemberley with apologies to ""the shade of Jane Austen for involving her beloved Elizabeth in the trauma of a murder investigation."" Well, something had to enliven the rather dull married lives of privileged Englishwomen of the period other than fancy balls and new gowns...and after all...""A murder in the family can provide the fission of excitement at fashionable dinner parties...""

Austenites in general were in an uproar.  Especially the admirers of fair Lizzie.

And now BBC has released a 180 minute televised adaptation of DEATH COMES TO PEMBERLEY.  The teleplay will be shown in America on PBS Masterpiece Sundays in two episodes October 26-November 2, 2014.  Anna Maxwell Smith and Matthew Rhys star as Elizabeth and Darcy, now six years married with two young sons.

In her review of the BBC film adaptation for the British Society For Eighteenth-Century Studies, Marina Carlo-Lopez, clearly an Austenite, states the  film is ""a successful adaptation of a not so successful novel.""  I think what she's trying to say is that Austenites and Jamesians may finally unite in approval of the continuation of the story.  Rhys interpretation as P. D. James' Fitzwilliam Darcy will be the catalyst.

Welsh-born actor Matthew Rhys, when asked if he wanted to play Darcy, said ""Absolutely not...  The readership of PRIDE & PREJUDICE is so enormous, and Darcy has now become this iconic figure...part of the heritage."" But his agent persisted, according to an Entertainment Weekly interview.  And Rhys finally agreed that ""This isn't the Darcy that everyone knows. This is a different Darcy... He's been mellowed by Elizabeth...  As much as he is different and having [children] has changed him, he reverts back to who Darcy was, certainly in PRIDE & PREJUDICE, because his name is on the line, the estate is on the line, and those sort of intrinsic Darcy morals come back. So it's the best of both worlds.""

Perhaps the admirers of Colin Firth's performance as Darcy in the 1995 miniseries will be disappointed.  Rhys and his fellow actor Matthew Goode, who plays Darcy's brother-in-law Wickham, are not doing a white-shirt-in-the-pond scene.  And fans of Jennifer Ehle's Elizabeth will surely be disappointed in Anna Maxwell Smith as their beloved character.  Perhaps a darker hairstyle and brighter gowns would have enlivened the rather plain Smith as the more mature mistress of Pemberley, once the wit of Longboum.

Early in the James' novel, when Elizabeth is thinking of her short courtship and subsequent marriage with Darcy, she muses: ""If this were fiction, could even the most brilliant novelist contrive to make credible so short a period in which pride has been subdued and prejudice overcome?""

Yes, Elizabeth, it can be done in a 310 page novel by a modern day Baroness and a 180 minute film adaptation. But this time, to Austen's manners, upbringing and morality of a daughter who marries well, we add James' family loyalty and fervor of the gentleman who marries her and who successfully confronts a family scandal.

Pride has been subdued and prejudice overcome....again.",1407456000,71,3875,5.070866141732283
6163406,3,B00HHAX9BI,"Out of all the Jane Austen fanfictions, P.D. James' ""Death Comes to Pemberley"" is probably the most successful.

So it's not that surprising that the BBC decided to turn this murder-mystery sequel to ""Pride and Prejudice"" into a miniseries. And it's a fairly decent little whodunnit, with beautiful visuals, a socially awkward love triangle and a lot of familiar faces... and the major downside is some less-than-ideal casting for the main characters, Lizzie and Darcy.

On the eve of a ball, Pemberley is thrown into an uproar when a hysterical Lydia (Jenna Coleman) comes charging in -- and Wickham (Matthew Goode) is found with the corpse of his old friend, Captain Denny. Someone whacked Denny on the head, and Wickham is sobbing that he killed him.

Darcy (Matthew Rhys) is reluctant to believe that Wickham could have committed the murder, especially since it would bring a wave of scandal to Pemberley. But the magistrate Hardcastle (Trevor Eve) has no other suspects, and between Wickham's hysterical confession and being alone in the woods with Denny, he's sort of the perfect culprit.

Meanwhile, Lizzie (Anna Maxwell Martin) is perplexed by a series of odd occurrences -- a mysterious woman in the woods near Pemberley, a baby with an unknown father, and a love triangle between Georgiana Darcy (Eleanor Tomlinson) and two suitors. As she struggles to deal with the scandal's effects on her marriage, she begins to realize that there's a connection between these three problems, which may be the key to solving the murder.

""Death Comes to Pemberley"" is pretty lightweight as a murder mystery -- I figured out the murderer's identity before the murder even took place. Furthermore, not a lot of actual detective work takes place. Darcy deals with the comedic court goings-on (most of the audience seems there for the LOLs) while Lizzie collects random clues that eventually gel together.

It's more enjoyable as a Regency drama, and as one of the few competent sequels to ""Pride and Prejudice"" -- it's told with respect to the original story, and fleshes out some of the storylines (Mrs. Younge, Wickham's ongoing caddishness) from that novel. It's also beautifully filmed, set in an exquisite mansion, sprawling manicured grounds and some truly lovely forests -- it's almost a shame when the attention is drawn to nearby towns.

Unfortunately, the main characters aren't well-cast. Rhys seems stiff and stodgy as Darcy, rather than the passionate, sometimes grim figure he should be. And Martin... well, she seems a bit too old and plain for the role of Lizzie, and she doesn't really have the witty charisma that you would expect. In fact, Lizzie spends most of her time just floating around Pemberley and arguing with people.

It's a shame, because most of the casting is spot-on -- the Bennetts, Coleman as the pert and shallow Lydia, Tomlinson as a dewy-eyed Georgiana, Mariah Gale as Mrs. Younge, and so on. Gale gives a particularly good performance as the perennial wastrel Wickham, who has caused yet another scandal; however, we do see Wickham scared and desperate. Tom Ward does a pretty passable job as Colonel Fitzwilliam, but it's never made clear when or why he became an untrustworthy, manipulative jerk.

""Death Comes to Pemberley"" is fairly flat as a mystery and has some lackluster lead actors, but it's an acceptable sequel to the immortal Austen novel. And if nothing else, enjoy the superb supporting cast.",1406764800,88,3439,5.0298769771529
6163407,3,B00HHAX9BI,"Bad casting is the main fault of this production.  Obviously, it's not Jane Austen and the dialog doesn't come up to her standards either in the book or movie, but it is a clever plot nonetheless.  The filming is stylish and appealing, just those pesky badly cast characters keep messing up the scenes.  Anna Maxwell Martin is a lovely actress, she's just not Lizzie nor is Matthew Rhys Darcy by any stretch of the imagination.

So, having said that, if you can get over disappointment at not seeing a real Lizzie and Darcy, you might enjoy this little whodunnit.",1405900800,13,563,4.656565656565657

6163410,3,B00HHAX9BI,"Out of all the Jane Austen fanfictions, P.D. James' ""Death Comes to Pemberley"" is probably the most successful.

So it's not that surprising that the BBC decided to turn this murder-mystery sequel to ""Pride and Prejudice"" into a miniseries. And it's a fairly decent little whodunnit, with beautiful visuals, a socially awkward love triangle and a lot of familiar faces... and the major downside is some less-than-ideal casting for the main characters, Lizzie and Darcy.

On the eve of a ball, Pemberley is thrown into an uproar when a hysterical Lydia (Jenna Coleman) comes charging in -- and Wickham (Matthew Goode) is found with the corpse of his old friend, Captain Denny. Someone whacked Denny on the head, and Wickham is sobbing that he killed him.

Darcy (Matthew Rhys) is reluctant to believe that Wickham could have committed the murder, especially since it would bring a wave of scandal to Pemberley. But the magistrate Hardcastle (Trevor Eve) has no other suspects, and between Wickham's hysterical confession and being alone in the woods with Denny, he's sort of the perfect culprit.

Meanwhile, Lizzie (Anna Maxwell Martin) is perplexed by a series of odd occurrences -- a mysterious woman in the woods near Pemberley, a baby with an unknown father, and a love triangle between Georgiana Darcy (Eleanor Tomlinson) and two suitors. As she struggles to deal with the scandal's effects on her marriage, she begins to realize that there's a connection between these three problems, which may be the key to solving the murder.

""Death Comes to Pemberley"" is pretty lightweight as a murder mystery -- I figured out the murderer's identity before the murder even took place. Furthermore, not a lot of actual detective work takes place. Darcy deals with the comedic court goings-on (most of the audience seems there for the LOLs) while Lizzie collects random clues that eventually gel together.

It's more enjoyable as a Regency drama, and as one of the few competent sequels to ""Pride and Prejudice"" -- it's told with respect to the original story, and fleshes out some of the storylines (Mrs. Younge, Wickham's ongoing caddishness) from that novel. It's also beautifully filmed, set in an exquisite mansion, sprawling manicured grounds and some truly lovely forests -- it's almost a shame when the attention is drawn to nearby towns.

Unfortunately, the main characters aren't well-cast. Rhys seems stiff and stodgy as Darcy, rather than the passionate, sometimes grim figure he should be. And Martin... well, she seems a bit too old and plain for the role of Lizzie, and she doesn't really have the witty charisma that you would expect. In fact, Lizzie spends most of her time just floating around Pemberley and arguing with people.

6163411,5,B00HHAX9BI,"First off, this is a region 2 DVD and the seller is fantastic about alerting you to that fact. I received an email confirming that I understood the region issue and noting I could cancel the order if necessary. I missed the email thanks to the insane number of daily emails I get, so the seller also placed a slip of paper around the DVD package altering me again and noting to return it unopened if I did not wish to keep it. The DVD is clearly marked region 2 on Amazon but I appreciated the seller's efforts to ensure it would not be a problem for me. Thanks!

As for the series itself... ugh. I have mixed feelings about the plot. I haven't read Death Comes to Pemberley so I cannot compare the BBC version to the novel but I love Pride & Prejudice (A&E's version will always be my favorite) and I really like the main actors so I wanted to see this show.

Overall, this is something I pull out when I want to see Matthew Rhys acting with a British accent. The characters don't seem to like or trust one another (yes, I get there was a murder, I mean the ones that we clearly not involved in it). At times, it seems as if the writer wasn't sure whether to set it in the early 1800's or the present time given how some of the scenes were written. However, the acting is very good, as you'd expect from the entire cast, and the locations are breathtaking. I really like this series but more as a murder/mystery set in that time period, rather than as a continuation of P&P. Watch this if you like mystery shows, but don't expect a lot of Lizzie/Darcy interaction.",1401321600,3,1565,4.248322147651007

8632709,4,B00HHAX9BI,"Overall, it's a good production with great entertainment value. However, it might ruin future viewings of Pride & Prejudice, as you overlay some of the new qualities upon the original characters; qualities not put forth by Jane Austen.",1529280000,,235,5.2105263157894735
8632710,4,B00HHAX9BI,"I did enjoy this sequel to Pride and Prejudice.  It caught the personalities of Austen's characters, it caught her wit and style.  The story was good, A murder mystery which brings tension to the Darcy marriage, along with the usual Austen themes of marriage and society.

The setting was beautiful.  It had the correct feel of the period even in the details.

Now for the big ""but"".  The acting was VERY good all around... but the actress for the main character Elizabeth Bennet, did not LOOK the part.  She acted well, but she looked old, haggard, plain, boring.  This is not at all fitting for the character as written by Austen.  And this did detract from the movie.  It is sad because it could have been avoided with the many tricks make-up artists have been using for years,  How about a little bust padding to give her a nice figure?  What about cheek contouring makeup, false eyelashes, brow pencil, wigs etc.  They could have done so much to eliminate the unfitting dowdy look that Elizabeth had in this movie and which made it harder to enjoy.  She looked worse than the servants.  No jewelry, make-up, coiffed styled hair or attractive clothes. Other characters like Georgiana and Lydia looked far above Elizabeth.  Not sure what the producers had in mind when they chose to do nothing to enhance the appearance of the actress playing Elizabeth but, eliminating all make-up. jewels, clothing and hairstyles DID NOT WORK.  The look of an actress is easier to adapt than poor acting skills.  The actress had the acting skills, but not the look - and they did nothing to achieve the look Elizabeth Bennet should have.

Darcy was better. Sure he could have been taller, more handsome and younger.  But overall the character worked well. He gave a commanding performance.  A standout was the character of Selwyn Hardcastle.  The actor was great and gave us a memorable and fascinating character.  I'd like to learn more about that character.",1529193600,,1947,4.7807807807807805

8632715,2,B00HHAX9BI,"This three episode drama (180 minutes) was disappointing. Expecting valid continuing story, extended insight into Elizabeth and Darcy.

Wrong!

The names are the same. However, the ideas, personality, reactions, premises do not match Jane Austins characters.

Elizabeth Bennetts cool, incisive intelligence has disappeared. Darcys principled, serious, determined code has deteriorated into selfish insecurity.

What a loss!

Oddly, the only character continuing true was Elizabeths scatterbrained sister. Self-centered to the core, horrible judgement, phony in everything, yep, she is the same.

Why can/does author so vividly present this silly, failure of a person and so faint an outline of an accomplished life?

Well . . . seems the writer just cannot/willnot admit to Jane Austins portrayal of genuine, sincere, real principled character.

This story almost seems more a character assassination than a murder mystery.

Death comes to pemberly might really refer to the murder of the people in Jane Austins novel.

The mystery, trial, verdict didn't catch my interest. Slow and poorly developed.

The three hour bbc Pride and Prejudice video is fantastic.
