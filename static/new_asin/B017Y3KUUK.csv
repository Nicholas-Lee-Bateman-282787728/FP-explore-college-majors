8741009,2,B017Y3KUUK,"This really should be titled as the ""Faust"" violin concerto - several sections are obviously of Faust's own making - I've never heard them in any other performance; really, it's an ego trip for the performer. Additionally, the violin is often overpowered by the orchestra - either Faust plays too softly or the balance engineer needs to consider another line of work. And approximately 20 seconds before the end of the first movement, the microphones pick up some sort of extraneous sound (I have no idea what it is, but it reminds me of a small scooter being revved - fortunately, it only lasts 2 or 3 seconds, but it destroys the piece for me). I'll probably donate the DVD to our local library; as it's from a 3rd-party seller and not defective, it can't be returned.

The Sixth Symphony is OK, but nothing exceptional.",1491091200,,822,4.6689655172413795

- Maestro Haitink returns to Beethoven with the Berlin Philharmonic,and with state of the art picture and sound.

Weaknesses:
- No audio commentaries, no rehearsal footage, and no interviews.
- Bland, empty performances.

Additional comments: Since when has the Berlin Philharmonic started sounding so synthetic and artificial? instead of imitating birds and shepherds near a brook, the woodwinds sound like exhaust pipes and whistles from mechanical behemoth. The double basses sound so metallic and synthetic that they rumble the ground as if a group of tanks were rolling through the countryside, demolishing everything and anything within their path. And the timpani sounds as if a tank was shooting it's canon instead of imitating a thunder. What ever happened to that warm, wooden sound this orchestra used to have? I miss those days when string players used gut strings covered with resin and when timpani players used real goat leather on their drums instead of synthetic material. Never have I heard Beethoven sound so robotic and mechanical. Just for a comparison I watched Ivan Fischer's recording with the Concertgebouworkest, and what a difference! even though the dutch orchestra played a bit sloppy, the symphony sounded marvelous. Much warmer and tender. Also, I played B&ouml;hm's 1972 analog recording with the Vienna Philharmonic and for a 44 year old recording, it sounds spectacular. In fact, B&ouml;hm's and even Monteux's recording also with the Vienna Philharmonic are considered reference recordings, they're just unbeatable.

For the violin concerto, it is just above the average performance. Again, not even close to Haitink's 1974 recording with Henryk Szeryng, or Karajan's 1967 recording with Christian Ferras. It's a pity these weren't captured on video. But with Faust's indifferent approach, who needs the video capture? just listen latter ones.

Anyways, Haitink here tries so hard to bring out the German spirit of a now multi-ethnic and multinational orchestra, which ultimately yields poor results, because, how much German spirit is left in a tutti frutti orchestra?. I was really looking forward for an extraordinary or even well played performance by the great Bernard Haitink, but I can't help to think that Haitink's efforts turned out to be useless when the orchestra that he once conducted over 40 years ago is not the same one today.

In summary, save your money and listen to your old favorite recording, unless you like listening to orchestras that sound like rumbling machines in an assembly factory. By the way, who had the idea to have the Berlin Philharmonic perform in such venue with dry acoustics? it certainly doesn't enhance the sounds nor the experience.",1465084800,4,2722,5.306264501160093

8741012,5,B017Y3KUUK,"This live concert was recorded as recently as April 2015 at Baden-Baden and features a reduced BPO as appropriate to the period, Isabelle Faust as violin soloist and Bernard Haitink.

The imaging and sound is a well up to current state of the art HD product with truthful colours and truthful sound offering good definition depth and width. The camera work is informative without being invasive. The sound is presented in DTS 5.1 HD Master and PMC stereo. This is a high quality recording and will not disappoint. The sleeve notes might though and are, in effect, non-existent just giving track information and product details.

The performances will certainly not disappoint though. Isabelle Faust offers an interpretation that is quite a considerable alternative to that of Mutter and Ozawa, also on Euroarts and is part of the 2008 Karajan memorial concert in Vienna. In that case the performance is more outward going and has a marked early Romantic flavour delivering rich tone and a weightier concept throughout.
Isabelle Faust conversely, despite playing on the Stradivarius Sleeping Beauty of 1704, plays with a reduced but very clear and clean tone and presents an interpretation that is almost like a private communication between herself and the composer. This is especially marked in the slow movement. The more introspective and smaller-scaled nature of her performance betrays her interest in period performance and is therefore more naturally appropriate to the period, satisfying though Mutter undoubtedly is.

Both Haitink and the orchestra provide admirably proportioned but responsive accompaniment to match the soloist and the whole piece comes over more as a group event where the soloist is almost projected as the first among equals rather than the soloist with supporters. The use of cadenzas will come as something of a surprise to those not familiar with her 2010 CD recording with Abbado and the Orchestra Mozart. In both cases Faust opts for a cadenza with timpani accompaniment. This is an idea borrowed from Beethovens own version of this concerto for piano and orchestra. She also provides shorter cadenzas at the end of the second movement linking directly into the third movement and also within the third movement. This enhances the impression of spontaneity and thoughtful introspection as none of these cadenza points is played as primarily display vehicles.

The symphony is an outstanding performance where the opening movement really does communicate cheerfulness as intended by the composer. That merriness is also apparent in the third movement at the Gathering of country folk prior to the storm. There is also a balancing sense of fulfilment within the concluding movement and Happy and thankful feelings after the storm are clearly portrayed. The storm is effective without straying outside its period and the scene by the brook has a convincingly gentle flow about it. In summary this is a particularly communicative reading of Beethovens only program symphony and one where the emphasis is pictorial rather than thematic development.

In conclusion, this disc can be strongly recommended for fine performances, especially of the concerto, and all within a particularly satisfying and truthful recording.",1453766400,5,3249,5.313229571984436
