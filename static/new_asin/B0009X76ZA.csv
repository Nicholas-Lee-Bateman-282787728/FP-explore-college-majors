2334283,4,B0009X76ZA,"Season 2 wasn't quite as much fun as Season 1, but still a good watch. The program is old enough that it's interesting to see the main character, Jarod, improvising to do things we now take for granted in forensics, science, investigation, etc. It's nice to see the bad guy get it.",1466640000,,281,4.423076923076923

2334291,4,B0009X76ZA,"Love the series and purchased all four when they were on sale.  The once caveat in the 2-4 season is the change from full to widescreen.  Although not quite as apparent in the fourth season, it appears the widescreen releases are slightly zoomed in.  This format change results in close up scenes with truncated head shots and a somewhat reduced image quality that is more pronounced on large screen TV's.",1445731200,,405,4.757142857142857

2334315,5,B0009X76ZA,"This is a smart, funny show. I enjoy watching it with my family. Although the main character is a sort of - um - I don't know - oddball version of a genius vigilante - I don't feel like this shows conveys a bad message. On the contrary, the main character shows extreme empathy for the victims he assists, and always manages to find the perpetrators and give them a taste of their own medicine. Trust me, it's a good show. The only thing that bugs me about the show is one of the other lead characters entire wardrobe is centered around nothing but EXTREMELY short skirts. It looks so bizarre. I don't remember dressing like that in the nineties. Were our skirts REALLY that short and I just don't remember? LOL!! Despite the one character's ridiculously short skirts - the show is really great! :) We love it so much in my family we find ourselves quoting from it. My parents watch the seasons over and over. I think there is also a movie or two...which...of course...they have!",1415577600,,979,4.4748603351955305

One thing that I noticed is that as I watched the first 2 seasons I enjoyed them just as much as I did when the show was on the tube yrs. ago.
I noticed that there is an ""island"" movie also.  I have never seen that one.
My next purchase will be season 4 and then the 'island' one.

2334364,4,B0009X76ZA,"How is posible that a series with 4 seasons and 2 movies still not have any ending?? It's like you reading a book and when you turn the page the rest are all blank, let you in the middle of nowhere. Dont misunderstanding, the series is good and the characters are amazing, especially my favorite: Miss Parker. I blame the Pretender's writers because they ruin the story with to many secrets and never answer anything, they complicate the story to much and in some way started to be annoying. They kill the series and the movies, increasing the problem instead find a perfect ending. It's like they never knew how to ended. When the series was cancel the creators and writers announce 4 movies to end the story but the lack of ratings they just produced 2 of them, and even that they not did an ending, can you believe it??. All story needs an ending, a closer, no matter is a good ending or fatal ending, just need one. So if you was a fan of this series, well you can pass this, but if you are someone like me, someone who likes to see drama or supense but like to watch the story with a proper begin and a proper ending, so this series is not for you. I blame myself for not doing a proper search to stop me to buy it. I don't like story with not closure,let you a bad taste...I hope I can help somebody...",1291161600,,1308,4.2151394422310755

2334370,4,B0009X76ZA,"We enjoyed The Pretender very much when it was on the air, and we were disappointed when it was cancelled.  It's nice to have access to the show via DVD recordings.  Jarod is a real ""good guy"" and goes around helping other people while carrying out his quest to find his family, all the while evading thugs from The Centre.
  This is a good show for depicting good versus evil, and overall, it's a decent family program.  There are a few 'adult situations' but those will often go over the heads of younger children.  For the most part, the whole Pretender series is fun, exciting, often humorous, and gratifying.  Each episode has elements of redemption.  Good is vindicated, and the bad guys get justice.

2334385,3,B0009X76ZA,"In its second season, THE PRETENDER suffered from an overabundance of all the things that were fresh in the first season that became redundant and tedious the second time around.  Jarod's predilection to obsess on new things, like chocolate milk, twinkies, etc. didn't seem as fun as before; Miss Parker's attempts to be sympathetic died when she returned to her former cool demeanor, although she has some great lines; Broots' nerdiness is now annoying; Mr. Raines the Nosferatu like villain and newcomers Mr. Lyle and Brigitte cartoonish villains; and the show just doesn't want to get rid of them, even though they've worn out their welcome.  Jarod's angelic stature is also getting monotonous.  But in spite of all this, the show still remains kind of addictive; we want to know where Jarod's family is and who killed Miss Parker's mother, and it does end with an explosive cliffhanger.

Weiss) who has successfully eluded re-capture from the dark organization known as the Centre. They had abducted Jarod as a child and made him run through simulations as a Pretender which allows him to master any profession. A charmeleon, so to speak. Jarod leads his Centre nemesis-Ms. Parker, Sydney and Mr Broots on a cross country chase, always staying one step ahead and leaving them amusing clues as to where he can be found next. In season two, the Centre operatives find they have there own demons to contend with, when the Centre's paranoia about someone within is helping Jarod alude them leads them to hire the mysterious Mr. Lyle (played to the hilt by Desperate Housewive's James Denton) and uber-bitch killer, Brigitte. The mystery deepens as questions are answered and new mysteries pop up making all envolved including the Centre's main triad have doubts about their prime players like the evil Dr. Raines and even Ms. Parker's own father....who did kill Catherine Parker? As Jarod closes in on answers about his own elusive past will others find out there are skeletons in their own closets? Ones they never knew existed? Although Fox is stingy with their extras, this show is well worth the money! Edge of the seat thriller. Never fails to entertain, never disappoints!",1168387200,,1392,5.004310344827586

And the most exciting plots of the mysteries and truths surroinding an organization called the Center. The Center plot has many interwoven subplots.

2334389,5,B0009X76ZA,"ONe of the best storyline tv shows ever made I beleive.  Michale T. Weiss is a very talented actor.  All of the actors are.  It's a show about a boy named Jarod, they call him a Pretender because he can be whatever he wants to be.  They saw this quality in him and took him from his parents as a child.  It follows through Jarod's life as he escapes from the centre and tries to live a life pretending to be people in order to help those less fortunate, to try and give back what he helped destroy.  He learned his 'simulations' were really sold to higher authorities and used to commit various crimes and injustices.  So he goes around the world running from the Centre to help others leaving clues behind alos, while trying to find his real family and his mother.  He keeps in touch with Sydney at the centre whom he looks to as a father figure, and they help each other in Jarod's search.  Then comes Ms. Parker, whom Jarod actually grew up with, she's on the hunt to apease 'daddy' but in the midst of it all finds more lies than truths to throw her off Jarod's trail and onto the trail of her father and her mother's mysterious death  Then you have Broots, the jelly-spined assistant that quivers under Parker's gaze and has a daughter of his own. Then you have Angelo, another pretender of the cemtre's an experiment that went wrong but he also grew up with Jarod and Ms. Parker, his love for cracker jacks and extremem knowledge of the centre's true bieng make him a very valuable character, there is one episode that involves Angelo that makes you want to cry...I did.  No he doesn't die.  And then there's Raines, the head cheeses of the whole puzzle.  Each character is it's own piece in this puzzle that makes the Pretender and you follow each story each path and root for Jarod to finally find his mother.  You meet other character's along the way, like Mr. Lyle, Bridgette, and Kyle, Jarod's real Brother.  At times he gets so close to finding what he really seeks, but the closer he gets the more dangerous it becomes for all the character's involved as the dark secrets, and skeletons that make up the Centre start to truly reveal themselves.  A truly remarkable show that never should have ended, and should have continued so the viewers could be put at ease.  The show was cancelled after the premiere movie and never picked up...The movie ended like most the other shows and there was no clsure whateoever.

2334396,1,B0009X76ZA,"I loved this series and wanted to get them on DVD.  I have and loved the DVDs for season 1. This is the only series that I know of where they recorded on both sides of the DVD.  The 'A side' works on the first two disks, but the 'B side' won't play.  If you decide to get these DVDs make sure that you get them from someplace that you can easily return them if you have this problem.  (I received mine as a gift)

So I'm left with a choice.  Buy season 2 of a show that I really enjoyed and HOPE that I don't encounter the same problem.  Or 'give up'.

If I was simply rating the season 2 of the series, I would have given it 4 stars (5 stars is for perfection).  I enjoyed the premise of the show and the actors.  It is hard to decide on a 'favorite' character because so many of them are so very engaging.  The reason that it did not receive 5 stars is because of logic problems.  This man can get a job just about anywhere doing anything without having background check done.  I KNOW there wouldn't be  a show if he couldn't get jobs, but it is just a little TOO easy for him.  In the last episode that I watched, he discovered Twinkies (not a spoiler).  He has been out of The Center for how long and hadn't discovered Twinkies yet?  Small annoyances that I can live with, but they prevented the show (by itself) from receiving a 5 star rating.

I would have rated the quality of the DVD as a 0 had I been given that option.  If I can't see half of the episodes, I can hardly give the DVD a good rating.",1136246400,,1507,3.979933110367893

I'd say now that it's a little dated, but if you've never seen this before or even if you have, it is still enjoyable and well written.  Now everyone will know James Denton (Jamie Denton then) from Desperate Housewives.  He was a hot looking bad guy, and Miss Parker is now in Less Than Perfect.

2334399,5,B0009X76ZA,"Season 2 of ""The Pretender"" holds onto the momentum established with Season 1 and builds on it. All of the drama continues. The tale of the Pretender, 'Jarod' who is a genius who could become anyone he wanted to be but didn't know who he was, still refreshingly original. Jarod's experiences are skillfully portrayed with sensitivity by the lead actor, Michael T. Weiss. Season 2 introduces the character, 'Mr. Lyle,' played with finesse by James Denton, of current Desperate Housewives fame. Jamie Denton, as he was called then, is so convincing as the nefarious 'Mr. Lyle' that he has been avoided by people in real life because of the role! The same actually goes for Andrea Parker who plays the very complicated character 'Miss Parker,' and has had similar reactions from people in real life. (What a tribute to these performers. How can you not watch?) But unlike 'Mr. Lyle,' 'Miss Parker' is not just a one-sided person. She isn't just pure evil. 'Jarod' is very good at showing us the other facets of her character as he challenges her in ways she would never expect from anyone. Andrea Parker owns the role of 'Miss Parker' and I hope she will get to play it again at least one more time in a final ""Pretender"" movie. Meanwhile, I will enjoy these DVDs, which by the way, also contain one of Andrea's favorite episodes, ""Toy Surprise."" No spoilers here, you'll have to watch to see why! This DVD set is very definitive Pretender, perfectly crafted drama, mystery and comedy, pure and clean, classic entertainment your whole family can enjoy.

Enter new baddies... primary among them Jamie Denton (Desperate Housewives) as Mr. Lyle. What he lacked in opposing thumbs, he made up for with sheer determination and deception. The enigmatic Mr. Raines had a greater presence here as well. They were soon followed by Harve Presnell as Mr. Parker, and Pamela Gidley as Brigitte.

As the second season went on, The Centre lost faith in Miss Parker's ability to bring Jarod back. She was hounded by Lyle and Brigitte. And was never really sure where her beloved Daddy stood. To make matters worse, she began running into her own health issues. And what did happen in that Centre elevator all those years ago?

The tapestry that was the central storyline for this great show, got woven a bit further. Though for every question that was answered (and there were very few), another series of questions would manifest themselves.
