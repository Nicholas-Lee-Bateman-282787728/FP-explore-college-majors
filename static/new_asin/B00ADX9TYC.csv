Darkstar was written and developed to be an interactive computer game.  This ""movie"" is effectively the cut scenes from that game, compiled to a storyline and put on DVD to watch.  The graphics are early-2000's indie game quality, and as such probably wouldn't impress most CGI-philes these days.  It won't impress, that is, until you factor in that the whole thing was lovingly designed, produced and crafted independently, springing from the mind of a single person.
The story itself is wonderful, a great idea.  The lead character is John O'Neil (in the game, this is the player), who wakes up from deep sleep in space with no memory.  It turns out long hibernation can have disastrous effects on memories and personality.  One crew member is dead, murdered in his sleep, another is missing, and yet another is still in cryosleep.
As the movie (game play) progresses, O'Neil finds clues about a terrible event that happened to Earth, and one possibility to reverse it all.  His mission becomes to repair the ship and finish that they started.

I found it brilliant, even though the transition from game to movie wasn't very smooth at all.  We are joltingly reminded of the game origin at every step, but then pulled right back into the story.  The acting is sufficient but I wouldn't expect to see any Oscars on these shelves.  The animation, as I mentioned, is old game quality.  The music is amazing and used heavily throughout (remember, these were cut scenes).

I may be swayed a bit by my status as a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000, and the myriad of references to the show all through the movie (including large parts of the cast itself) might affect my judgment here.  I did find it fun to see Joel, Mary Jo, Frank, Trace, J Elvis and Beez in genuine dramatic roles.
(I especially got a chuckle out of a hologram of Frank's character saying ""Go ahead, push the button!  See what happens!  Ha ha ha!""  What can I say?  I'm easy.)

I give it 4 stars of the 5.  I took off 1 star because the box art lists a gag reel, but there is nothing on my disc except the feature.",1377216000,6,2180,4.6103896103896105
