7794640,5,0975506552,"Author has several books that came recommended by world famous artists.  This recommendation lead to almost all the DVD's and books by Philippe Faraut.  Book is ""chunk'n'chew"" material that is easily digestible and practice ready.",1397433600,,230,5.542857142857143
7794641,5,0975506552,This as well as Philippe Faraut's other DVDs have a wealth of sculpting information that is well presented by a Great sculptor.  To the point with minimal ego comments or self indulgence.  His presentation is clear and straight forward.  He does not deviate from his stated objective and provides more factual information than one can  adsorb in a single viewing.  I was very pleased with the purchase and review various chapters repeatedly.  A bit pricey for a DVD but well worth the cost.,1362787200,,490,4.843373493975903
