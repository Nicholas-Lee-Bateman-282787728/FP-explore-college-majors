8650426,1,B00JF2K5U4,"It can be painful to watch the characters and setting of this film trying so hard to be Western. All Western music, Western styles, Western values. At first I had to wonder if it was even in India. The couple turn their little daughter into a ""Little Miss Sunshine"", no less!  I suppose there's appeal here for Indians longing and striving to be like Westerners. The somewhat good acting is unfortunately clouded by utter cliche.",1443052800,,429,4.72

This movie was such fun to watch as it offered a bit of everything- drama, comedy, enjoyable foot tapping musical numbers- all nicely packaged in everyday life scenarios. The timing could have been tweaked a bit more, though I'm not sure which part I would cut. ..... The 3 main characters- - Sid (Farhan Akhtar), Trish (Vidya Balan) and their Chemistry- really came through for the movie. The gist of the film is what happens after the 'I do's and baby makes three? How do you maintain the spark/passion that fueled the relationship to begin with? Having been on the roller coster ride of matrimony for over a decade and counting.... I can relate with Trish through her joy, angst and anxiety. I also felt for Sid's character being on the receiving end and dealing with his own issues with the transition. I highly recommend this movie to married couples and about to be married couples alike. There's something for everyone.
Cheers",1403827200,10,1043,4.643243243243243
