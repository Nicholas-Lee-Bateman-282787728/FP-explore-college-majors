8463282,5,B005AHKD5A,I was pleased with the video even though it is low quality and the sound fades in some places.  It is an earlier work which shows the strength of the band and why they have been resilient.  George has some good licks on guitar and the vocal are pretty good even though the sound quality is not up to par.  This was apparenely right after Twilight zone was written as they introduced the title as When The Bullit Hits The Bone (later to become Twilight Zone).  Good buy for historical value.,1354147200,3,490,4.351648351648351
8463283,5,B005AHKD5A,"I have no regrets buying a Panasonic all region dvd player so I could watch this Golden Earring it was well worth the purchase. I had never seen any live footage of them and I was not disappointed at all. This is a hard working band. I liked it so much that I,am now waiting for LIVE IN AHOH 2006 to arrive in the mail.",1325462400,5,319,3.923076923076923
