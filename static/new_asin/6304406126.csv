865094,3,6304406126,"For students of 1950's rock&roll this DVD should be in your collection of all things 50s'.  Again, as was the case with all 50s' rock&roll movies,  the recording stars of the era are the ""stars"" of the film.  Carl Perkins, Frankie Avalon, Charlie Gracie, Fats Domino(seeing him sing ""wait & see"" is worth the cost of the DVD alone).  But, sadly, ""Jamboree"" is technically very disappointing.  A little attention to detail whould have made Slim Whitman, Charlie Gracie, Jimmy Bowen & Buddy Knox appear a lot better ... what happened to the guitar solo in ""hula love""? Were the producers of the film in hurry to get this in the cinemas? Apart from its technical flaws, there are (some) great 50s rock&roll acts in ""Jamboree"" and some rarely seen long forgotten names like Jodie Sands & the 4 Coins.  For 1950s' music fans only.",1152489600,14,825,4.694444444444445
865095,3,6304406126,"It's great to see Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee, Fats Domino and others perform in this film, although the soap opera plot of two young singers managed by two divorced spouses is a little much at times",1126656000,5,195,4.444444444444445
865259,3,6304406126,"The 1950s was a time when it was possible for individual or group acts with just the barest hints of talent to not only land a contract with a record label but also, depending on how well their record sold, a ""sing-on"" spot in a movie.  Granted, the movies were more often than not low-budget, second-rate productions that were usually the second of a two-bill theater presentation and featured well-known radio personalities along with lesser-known actors, but for the music performers, many of whom were just kids straight out of the ""country"" and inner city neighborhoods, who cared? Such was the case with the film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jamboree/dp/B0009S4IHE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jamboree</a>, one of several rock & roll films that exploited the burgeoning teenage market, particularly white teenagers, whose raucous enthusiasm for the mostly black-themed dance music made them such a tempting (and profitable) draw for the label owners.  Modern-day fans of this genre, like me, have found that the existence of this film, and other like it, in the Amazon music library is like discovering gold.  Withal, it was the music that counted, and it makes the act of viewing these films--and getting past the non-existent or nonsensical plot lines--well-worth the effort.  I wanted to acquire this video mainly because it featured the only film appearance of 13-year-old Louis Lymon and the Teenchords, a group that primarily gained its 15-minutes of fame (more like a year) from the its association with the Teenagers, whose lead singer, Frankie, was Louis's older brother.  Little did anyone know at the time that 1957, when the film was produced, would mark the beginning of a long slide of the music we now know as ""doo wop""; it's what makes the acquisition of this film so valuable for die-hard enthusiasts of this short-lived genre.",1355356800,5,1896,5.391891891891892
865260,5,6304406126,"Excellent little musical. Something for everyone. Look out for Jerry Lee Lewis's dynamic pounding out Great Ball's Of Fire (this movie cut has not been released on CD). There are a few mediocre acts but they are easily tolerated by the giants of Rock and Roll, namely,  Fat's Dominio, Carl Perkins, and Jerry Lee Lewis and Connie Francis. If you don't like Rock And Roll then are other quality acts to suit your taste. Top Country Star Slim Whitman does a wonderful performance of ""Unchain My Heart"", Jazz legend Count Bassie does a great turn and does  ""The Great Blues Shouter"" ""Joe Williams"" Picture quality and sound quality is excellent too.",1330300800,2,646,4.8108108108108105
865261,5,6304406126,"This film is not a fantastic film considering it as a whole. HOWEVER, the brief performance of Buddy Knox singing his ""Hula Love"" with his Rhythm Orchids including Jimmy Bowen playing the rhythm guitar and Don Lanier, who was one of the finest and greatest rock and roll solo guitarists of the 50's, make this film a must. Yes, this brief performance of Buddy really makes this otherwise mediocre film a great value for the serious lover of the beginnings of Rock and Roll era. It is sad that Buddy Knox has been somehow underrated as a rock and roll star. Buddy was one of the finest and most charming rock and roll singers, and his voice and style were unsurpassed. Buddy Knox was as great as Buddy Holly and Gene Vincent. It is very sad that he passed away in 1999.",1317340800,5,768,4.415492957746479
865262,5,6304406126,"The movie's plot centers around Pete and Honey - two teens who fall in love while trying to climb to the top of the music charts with the help of their ruthless managers.  Along this backstage musical-style journey, many real life artists perform.  One not-to-be-missed performance is a young Frankie Avalon in his FIRST movie apperance (well before his first hit, ""Dede Dinah"").  Also to note is that even though she doesn't appear in the movie, Connie Francis' voices all of Honey's songs.

If you enjoyed movies like, ""Don't Knock the Rock"", ""Rock Around the Clock"", ""The Girl Can't Help It"", or ""Rock, Rock, Rock"" this movie's for you.",1280966400,3,639,4.834862385321101
865263,3,6304406126,"Beautiful transfer, welcome major studio DVD.  (Looks good, sounds OK; audio was never that clear on 'dialog' track.)  Bland story about two ultra-bland 'singers' is only worthwhile for the few rare clips of lip-syncing by a few early Rock 'n' roll greats:  Carl Perkins grinning with guitar moves (and inspiring George Harrison's early singing & playing with The Beatles), Jerry Lee Lewis growling and pounding, Fats Domino grinning & tinkling, Count Basie embarrassing himself looking embarrassed playing rock 'n' roll that's only beneath him because he thinks it is (or he can tell the filmmakers are flim-flamming artists & fans alike) when it's Milton Subotsky and Warner Bros. that should be embarrassed that they can't do this as well as was done in the world's first rock 'n' roll exploitation movie (""Rock Around The Clock"" which is corny fun that gives you some idea of the music scene of the times where this is lame beating around the fictious bush).  The actors are terrible instead of laughable.  For collector's only, despite good quality and necessity.  Buddy Knox is a rare treat too.",1246838400,,1101,5.021978021978022
865264,3,6304406126,"I believe this was put out only about a year after Dick Clark began hosting the long-running Amercian Bandstand television show. Clark plays an emcee in this film, similar to his role on that famous TV show. It's very interesting to see him as such a young guy. It was over  50 years ago....hard to believe.

Joining him are some megastars from the early rock 'n roll era: Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins Frankie Avalon and Fats Domino and some lesser-names like Jimmy Bowen, Jodie Sands, Buddy Knox and a bunch more.

For viewers looking for upbeat music, as I was, this was disappointing. Most of the songs were Connie Francis-type ballads. Also, the dubbing in here is horrible. It's obvious these singers were lip-synching the music and - no surprise here - they weren't all the greatest of actors. Plus, the script was lame.....very lame.

Hey, that's what you got with a lot of ""rock"" movies back then - some horrible scripts. I guess you just watch it to see the singers in their heyday.",1235692800,2,992,4.619318181818182

7870297,1,6304406126,"I will preface this by saying that I love the rock 'n' roll music of the 1950's. With the lineup of performers you would think this would be great just to see them. What you got were shortened versions of songs, poor camera work (scenes turning from light to dark) and horrible muted sound.  Forget the storyline - some of the worst acting and sets you'll ever see. The other movies of this time were much better.  Of course they were all a bit corny, however you wanted to see the performers regardless of the plot. I would have given this one star even if I saw it when it came out.",1439424000,2,584,4.205357142857143
7870298,5,6304406126,"Jamboree was released in 1957. I really enjoyed it as it features many stars in early phases of their careers. Dick Clark was a very young television music jock, Frankie Avalon made his first film appearance, and Connie Francis provides the lead female singer's singing voice.

An early version of 'Great Balls of Fire' by Jerry Lee Lewis is a standout. Debut of disk jockey Dick Clark pre American Bandstand. Slight plot involves two singers a duo who fall in love but are manipulated by an unscrupulous manager who separates them.
