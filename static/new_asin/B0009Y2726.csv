2336532,5,B0009Y2726,"It was only by chance that I came across Ghost Hunters during one of their marathons.  There wasn't anything better on, and while I loathe rality TV, I thought I'd give it a try.

I was amazed at how much I was really drawn into this show. These Ghost Hunters, are not the average Ghost Hunters. They use their knowledge of problem solving from their day jobs (as Roto Rooter guys)to help them debunk various hauntings all over the US.

Jason and Grant founded TAPS (The Atlantic Paranormal Society) after their own paranormal experiences.  Their crew are very professional and knowledgeable. They go in trying to DISPROVE the hauntings instead of prooving them. They don't go on feelings they go on hard core proof that they can SEE.  It's almost like YOU'RE one of the team.  It's a birds eye view of what they do when they go on a Ghost Hunt. They also explain terminology and the equipment they use so that you're not lost or confused.

It's really a VERY itellegent, and facinating show. I love it and am hooked on it.  I'm a reality TV loather, but this is one show that is a diamond in the ruff.

Deffinately worth watching. You won't be disappointed, even as a skeptic! I GUARANTEE it!",1131753600,13,1193,4.511627906976744
2336533,5,B0009Y2726,"I caught on to this show in season two, and am looking forward to owning season one on DVD.  The people in TAPS are genuine, and it shines through on camera.  I am a borderline believer in the paranormal, and I appreciate the efforts these guys take to be objective, and debunk a lot of the crap that surrounds this subject.

The series itself is created by the same people who do American Choppers (another favorite of mine), so it has that same kind of feel to it.  The editing is tight and very professional.  Even when the TAPS investigations yield nothing, the show is interesting because of the characters and the passion they show for their subject matter.",1130889600,8,663,4.53781512605042
2336534,5,B0009Y2726,"Ghost stories are a dime a dozen. Almost every town in America has a ""haunted"" house in it, and that's probably true for most of the world. Yet for all the stories, you don't see a lot of concrete proof. That's an important consideration when watching this series. Most of what people consider unexplained phenomena can be explained, with a little common sense and scientific method. What's left afterwards sure is intriguing, though. And fun.

Ghost Hunters succeeds where other shows about hauntings fail, because it has a somewhat critical eye. Although the ghost hunters aren't scientists, most of them have some common sense and they all have a lot of  determination, and they use it to debunk many of the hauntings they visit. They're also believers in the supernatural; so if you're a skeptic, you won't always agree with their assessment of the things they can't explain. Still, they have much higher standards of proof than almost every other show about ghosts I've seen.

Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson, the leaders T.A.P.S., are extremely likeable and down to earth, and they exude sincerity. (Also, they're Roto Rooter Guys by day and ghost hunters by night, which is a hoot on so many levels.) The editing of the show is pretty tight, so that when something unusual does happen, it gives you the chills.

I'm not a believer, and I can usually see how a human agent could be responsible for the ""unexplained"" phenomena. And yet...I love the heck out of this show. Go figure.",1129939200,10,1484,4.807843137254902
2336535,5,B0009Y2726,"I personally love this show. There are so many made-up ghost stories...I'm tired of them.  Ghost Hunters is no-bull, as said before.  This is all real.  If you are a type of person that just wants to see what looks like to be ghosts, this is not for you.  TAPS only cares about the real deal. Be aware that they come to a house that is said to be haunted and already believe that it isn't.  It takes some hard proof to make them say it is.  When they find something, they always try to disprove it.  So don't get your hopes up when they find something, because it might be nothing.  Yet, there are some things that stumble them, and it does get quite intersting.  Hey, it's hard to catch ghosts on camera, film, etc.  ...If your house is haunted, call TAPS!  ^.^  They'll disprove, or they'll say it's haunted!",1129939200,5,810,4.291390728476821

As an ameture ghost hunter myself, I've been hooked on this show since the first season began airing last year and now you can watch poor Frank get taken out by his sound equipment whenever you want, sad for Frank but cool for us. Don't forget about the Very Best Vol. 1 DVD which is pretty well priced, two hours worth of cool supernatural stuff for only ten bucks, wow! There are also tee shirts, caps (including the training cap from the show, black with yellow TAPS logo on the front), and even a so-called ""paramagazine"" magazine. Just a few more things to keep an eye out for. And for a fellow reviewer: The ghosts are often invisible to the camera but don't worry they're there. Of course they didn't catch much in season two so far but remember one of my favorite sayings: ""Just because you can't see something, doesn't mean it isn't there"".

They don't have goofy psychics that come along and postulate on what ""might"" be there. Instead they base their findings on audio and video equipment as well as human sensory perception.

The dialogue is often hilarious, and the interaction between all of the players is dynamic and truly realistic. They could be your next door neighbors.

2336591,4,B0009Y2726,"Well, I generally like the show (mostly later seasons, I think?), but this season was only mediocre in a few ways.

Honestly, in this season they seemed to have some pretty hokey stuff going on: a ""demonologist,"" a ""dowser,"" an overly goofy tech guy who seemed way too excitable. The science is occasionally questionable as are conclusions drawn from the ""evidence."" Granted there are a few seemingly interesting recordings that make it debatably worth watching.

Personally, I think the packaging of this set it terrible. At least the copy I got. It looks like the company was just trying to get rid of over-sized DVD cases. There's only 3 DVDs in a large case made for like 5-10. It's the thick kind with clips toward the top and bottom for securing a stack of DVDs. It seemed like they could have packaged like 2-3 seasons together in the space they used for only 3 discs. I hope the other half-season sets aren't packaged this way. But, knowing how the Sci-fi Channel likes packaging their DVDs in half-season sets (which I've always thought was a stupid double-dipping tactic),  I wouldn't be surprised... I'd rather see them use the newer slim cases that will hold 2+ discs per side and package a couple COMPLETE seasons together if possible.

If you're really into the show and catch this on sale, great, if not, well, it's a bit of a mixed bag... So, use your best judgment.",1297123200,,1382,4.674897119341564

2336595,1,B0009Y2726,"When I was young, I used to believe in this sort of thing out of naivete; I just couldn't believe that every ghost sighting in history was a mistake or hoax. Time has made me a bit more cynical though, and education has increased my understanding of science sufficiently to let me see TAPS (or GHI as they now call themselves) for what they really are; grown up children playing make-believe at science. The Ghost Hunters all bill themselves as clear-thinking, open minded skeptics who go into hauntings with the intent of *debunking* paranormal claims. The few bits of evidence surviving their intellectual assault are viewed as the true grains of wheat cleanly filtered from the chaff. In practice, though, they assume that the most mundane happenings are the result of invisible boogeymen. When they inevitably fail to prove any of the literally infinite numbers of non-boogeyman explanations beyond the phantasm of a doubt, our Ghost Hunters surrender and revert to their default position on any given event they don't understand; ""A boogeyman did it!""

In the early part of the series they would often conclude investigations with banal discussions about how, although the house was obviously filled with dead peoples' ghosts, it's still iffy whether or not to call it haunted. The *word* haunting was all but poo-pooed, despite the hosts' obsessive interest in the *concept* of hauntings. Where wondering how many grains of sand it takes to make a heap is the province of philosophers one might think the Ghost Hunters to be eminently qualified to answer how many ghosts have to ""live"" in a home before its haunted. However they seem to have little interest in actually answering that question, as answered questions just represent one less nook for their ghost-of-the-gaps to haunt. Don't be suckered in, these paranormal programs aren't intelligent good faith investigations into learning about the world; they are vapid mystery mongering, every last one of them. Interestingly even the pitiful level of faux, imitation skepticism expressed in constant dishonest claims about wanting to debunk hauntings seems to have drained away through-out the seasons. So too with the dismissive semantic quibbling about calling paranormal sites haunted. It looks like SyFy doesn't want its drooling viewership to engage in even the weakest level of critical reflection pertaining to what's appearing on their TV screen. That or the Ghost Hunters team have given up even the pretense of trying to look like dispassionate amateur scientists.

Ghost Hunters use scientific instruments in ways that boggle the mind. In their hands thermometers, electromagnetic field detectors, and others all gain the ability to detect ""ghosts."" These spirits suspiciously resemble cold breezes or electromagnetic fields. How are these in any sense ghosts? Jason Hawes is always on hand to give a canned ten second speech about how ghosts draw ""energy"" from the environment in order to manifest themselves as house settling noises or invisible fingers touching a female crew member's hair. Interestingly all these female members happen to be suspiciously attractive. Maybe there's something attractive women find irresistible about a plumber walking through old houses at 3 in the morning with a thermometer, but it strains my skepticism muscles to think that all these beautiful women were chosen based on their credentials. Anyway, Hawes never bothers to detail his ""energy"" hypothesis any more than just stating it forthrightly. What kind of energy? Kinetic? Thermal? X-ray? The answer, it seems, is any energy involved in an event Hawes doesn't currently understand and has no interest in subjecting to sustained scrutiny. Which is pretty much every event that happens during an investigation.

The show is a litany of filler and repetitive, boring non-content. The gang gets a call and they travel to the location while talking about how they're not True Believers, they just want to debunk the claims and see what remains unexplained. The client gives them a tour of the investigation site after they arrive. Then they start setting up equipment. However, since they have no detailed, coherent concept of what a ghost is or how one might confirm its existence in a legitimately verifiable, repeatable manner, the Ghost Hunters have a resulting lack of detailed, coherent methodology for actually doing so. This renders the entire investigation pointless, and any conclusions or purported evidence worthless. What is all that evidence actually *for*, what theory do they propose for all of these happenings? Anyway, the plumbers-by-day then mill about filming and temperature-taking and interviewing the furniture hoping a ghost will silently speak to their electronic voice recorders.

During the night they'll have one or two spooky experiences where a shadow moves by or they hear the wind but it sounds like a voice, or maybe they feel an invisible person brush up against them and cop a feel. That these guys have mysterious, eerie experiences during the course of an investigation is no really a surprise to this skeptic. What could one expect when a bunch of superstitious, under-educated people whose entire lives revolve around wanting to have ghostly encounters hype themselves up with expectations of having one and then start wandering through stereotypical haunted houses at 3 AM in a sleep deprived state? So, once day breaks they leave. Then they watch dozens of hours of video looking for anomalies. About half of these anomalies are dismissed out of hand as obvious moths or reflections. The team then present their ""wheat"" harvest to the client, who they then patronizingly reassure that they don't have to be afraid of living in their own home. The client always agrees, and they conclude yammering about whether or not the place was technically haunted or not. Every episode is the same. The only variation is how much evidence (sensu lato) accumulates during a given episode. Oftentimes they find absolutely nothing, and will have to reassure the homeowner that although intense monitoring by world-class Ghost Hunters produced no sign of a ghost in the house, their house is still full of ghosts. So really, the conclusion is always the same. If the Ghost Hunters find something, the house is full of ghosts. If the Ghost Hunters don't find anything, then, the house is still full of ghosts. Of course, in either case, the house-full-of-ghosts is not necessarily ""haunted,"" per se...

PS: There's also strong reason to believe that the Ghost Hunters actually fake some of their ""evidence."" For example, in one episode a lamp was shown sliding towards Grant on a table. In the shot before the lamp moved, its cord faced directly backwards. But in the shot after the lamp moved towards Grant, the cord was seen facing his direction. And to top it all off the table cloth in the moving lamp footage was visibly different than the table cloth on that same table when the Ghost Hunters were receiving their episodely tour of the site. There are dozens of such examples in the series and plenty of relevant information online.",1292457600,,7123,5.147668393782383
2336596,2,B0009Y2726,"Ghost Hunters - [SyFy Channel] Jason Hawes (Founder), Grant Wilson (Co-Founder), Amy Bruni (Investigator), Kris Williams (Historical Researcher/Investigator), Steve Gonsalves (Tech Manager/Investigator), Dave Tango (Investigator)

Hands down the most popular of all paranormal shows but from what I can tell this is mostly due to marketing because from my point of view they do just about everything wrong that you can possibly do during an investigation. Although many may find the program entertaining, from a paranormal investigation point of view, very little is done correctly.

For starters, TAPS (The Atlantic Paranormal Society) bring a large camera and production crew along on their investigations. This film crew spends most of its time filming the members of the cast rather than filming the location itself and looking for evidence. The TAPS team spends a surprising amount of time not using equipment themselves and dedicates most of their time to talking. In my opinion the less people involved in an investigation the less chance for contamination of evidence. Not to mention the fact that if you're not filming the area and the investigation team is talking the entire time, the chance of actually catching anything on audio or video is greatly reduced. In a lot of instances, if I were a spirit I would go out of my way to avoid interacting with a lot of the people involved in paranormal ghost hunting shows.

NOTE: TAPS is a large organization with satellite members/groups located all over the world. According to TAPS own website, there are TAPS affiliated groups in:

Alabama (2). Arizona, Arkansas (3), California (9), Colorado (2), Connecticut (4), Florida (3), Georgia (2), Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana (2), Maine, Massachusetts (4), Michigan, Minnesota (2), Mississippi (2), Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York (4), North Carolina (3), Ohio (4), Oklahoma, Pennsylvania (4), Rhode Island (2), South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee (2), Texas (3), Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, Argentina, Australia (6), Brazil, Canada (3), Denmark (5), Germany (2), Ireland (4), Israel (4), Netherlands, New Zealand (4), and the United Kingdom (3).

It's actually a rare occurrence when one of the investigators is carrying a night vision camcorder. They seem to mostly walk around in the dark and talk to each other while the cameras are trained on them. Usually the investigators will carry, at most; a digital voice recorder, LED flashlight and occasionally an EMF detector. Since most investigators navigate in zero light conditions using the LED display on their camcorder, I'm still a little confused as to how TAPS actually walk around without falling down stairs or bumping into walls more often. This is probably the most interesting aspect of the show, although to be fair, many times they are carrying an LED flashlight as their only piece of equipment.

If you pay close attention to the show, you will notice that it is broken down into several segments, mostly due to their lack of evidence while trying to fill an hour of time to make an entire episode. Of the several segments in each show, very little time is spent on actual investigation. Many times the program will start off with a poorly produced scene where Jason and Grant are supposedly at their other job as Roto-Rooter employees working on a water heater and magically get a call from Kris with news of an exciting new investigation opportunity. I know that when I'm paying $75 an hour for two plumbers to unclog my deep sink that I prefer them to be taking personal calls. The mere fact that this is so obviously staged (a film crew on location with them while doing day-to-day plumbing work) lends little credibility to the show and sets a tone for over-production from the start.

This is generally followed by the next scene which shows them at the TAPS headquarters discussing the case in further detail with Kris. Oddly enough, they always agree that this sounds like a fantastic case and jump on-board, although there is a complete lack of anything that resembles enthusiasm.

Cut to the TAPS members in multiple SUV's and/or panel vans en route to the location. It's usually at this point where Grant or Jason (via walkie-talkie) asks Kris to yet again go over the case details. Playful back and forth banter ensues and another 2-3 minutes of the show is wasted while going over the information that was already presented once, not to mention these details would also have been related to the rest of the team prior to departing on the investigation itself.

Running an investigation team of my own, I realize that when it's a big deal to save up enough money to purchase another used camcorder on Amazon, that having a fleet of newer model jet black vehicles with your team logo on the side is a warning sign that production takes precedence over content. This isn't a slam on TAPS since few people would tell the SyFy channel thanks but no thanks when it comes to free vehicles. It's just another indicator that these aren't your ordinary run-of-the-mill, out-of-the-garage investigators doing this simply for their desire to find answers. You can be sponsored (so to speak) by a large company without going Hollywood in my opinion. Personally I would rather watch a grass-roots team of investigators using what equipment they were able to piece together than what appears to be a corporate machine with all the bells and whistles. This is a problem that I have with many shows such as Paranormal State, a group of alleged college students using a FLIR thermal imaging camera that retails for anywhere between $4,000 - $8,000.

Another red flag aspect to the show is that if you pay close attention to the founders (Jason and Grant), neither seems to have a past experience or history that got them interested in the paranormal to begin with, nor do they really exude a desire to understand what is truly going on. They seem to treat the entire process from a business-only aspect and exude very little, if any, emotion or enthusiasm during an investigation. Grant actually seems to have misplaced his personality years ago and both of them seem very uninterested in the entire process. Maybe the reason this show is as popular as it is resides in the fact that it's more of a debunking program than an actual investigation into the paranormal. The goal of each episode leans more towards disproving any reported events than simply gathering evidence and being objective.

We now arrive at the scene of the investigation and Jason, Grant and Steve conduct a walk-thru of the location with the owner or person in charge. This is pretty much the only portion of the show that they do correctly, although the it always comes across feeling very rushed and more like they are simply going through the motions.

Next is another long drawn out segment where the equipment is set up. We get to see the TAPS members unload the SUV/vans and supposedly set up for the investigation. I have no proof of this, but my gut tells me that after they unload the equipment, members of the camera crew or production team do most of the actual setting up of the equipment. After this, Steve shows the team the DVR screen and explains each static camera angle that has been set up. Again, not really necessary since the areas of reported activity were made clear during the walk-thru and once again is more of a time-filler than anything else.

Next, we get the pleasure of not only hearing that they are going ""lights out"", but we get to actually see team members turning off light switches. This is enhanced by shots of the outside of the building where you get to experience what it looks like for a light to be turned off. It's at this point where you realize just how much filler this program contains.

Once the actual investigation starts, you can generally count on several of the following things happening:

1. Regardless of the time of year or temperature, Kris will wear a tank-top or other tight fitting shirt.

2. Steve and Tango, Jason and Grant, as well as Kris and Amy, will usually team up in pairs, head out in different directions followed by film crews and start talking for the rest of the investigation.

3. At some point, if the opportunity presents itself, Jason will either sit in a chair or lie down in a bed to ""investigate"". Jason never met a bed he didn't like. He is also not shy about this in the least. During the wrap-up with the client, he will even state something to the effect of ""While I was lying in your daughter's bed on the 2nd floor..."" This is quite possibly the creepiest part of the entire series.

4. Talking.

5. The camera crews will follow the pairs around while filming them and very little of the surrounding area.

6. If you're lucky, Jason will conduct the investigation while wearing flip-flops and long camo-shorts. Tango will definitely be wearing a paperboy hat circa the 1930's. Steve will sport the baseball cap.

7. Regardless of the level of activity that occurs, Jason, Grant and/or Steve will come up with every possible explanation, other than the paranormal, for what just transpired.

8. Every time the phrase EVP is mentioned, they will cut to a studio cut-scene of Jason, Grant or Steve explaining for the 400th time exactly what an EVP is. This is done because apparently people interested in the paranormal who set aside an hour to watch a show about it have no clue what an EVP is.

9.  More talking.

10. Kris will wear corrective lenses while working in complete and total darkness.

11. Jason (it's always Jason) will radio to the team during the middle of the investigation that it's time to wrap things up. This is apparently either to allow the large crew to break down the over-abundance of equipment they spent half the day setting up or because Jason wants to go to bed. (He appears exhausted and half asleep during most investigations).

12. Every so many episodes, Jason will miss the investigation due to illness or an injury to a family member.

13. Dave Tango will appear lost and confused and will be chastised in some way by Steve. He will accept this berating like a good little soldier and you will physically see him tuck his tail between his legs.

14. More talking.

15. You will be shown gratuitous footage of team members turning lights back on, rolling up cable, and placing boxes of equipment back into the vehicles.

There's really no excuse for cutting an investigation short that I can think of. If you go through the time and effort to do an investigation, wrapping it up early makes very little sense. It generally comes across as if they are simply tired or bored.

Now for the most exciting part of the program, reviewing the evidence. Even a partial evening of investigating (as is the case with TAPS) will produce loads of audio and video data. Every camera rolling and every digital audio recorder will have to be gone over in real-time. This is the most mundane and time-consuming portion of any investigation. For whatever reason, Steve and Tango are almost always tasked with this job to do alone. I don't think I have ever seen Jason, Grant or Kris play a part in this aspect of the investigation process but I may be wrong. However, if I had to place a bet, I would guess that Steve and Tango do not pour through the hours of audio and video without the aid of non-team members.

Steve and Tango will be shown sitting in front of monitors in your basic montage only to be broken up every so often for one of them to say the others name while removing his headphones. They will then watch (or listen) to the anomaly where nine times out of ten, if it's Tango's evidence, Steve will dismiss it. If it's Steve's evidence, Tango will be very impressed and agree that they have something. While this is happening, the viewer never gets to see or hear what they are looking at. That is held back for the ""Reveal"".

Ah, the reveal. Jason and Grant sit at a large table with a monitor at one end and the client across from them.  They exchange awkward pleasantries and then the evidence (or lack thereof) is presented. Since most of the investigation is the camera crew filming the team talking, there is usually very little to go over aside from a couple of possible EVP's and maybe something on video. Most of their findings are ""personal experiences"" and ""feelings"".  Pretty much every reveal consists of them admitting they have nothing specific, but that certain team members ""experienced"" something. My ""feeling"" is that if they cut the chatter, reduced the size of the film crew to say zero, and each member carried their own camera, the amount of evidence would greatly increase.

Cut to the end of the program which always consists of Jason and Grant driving away from the reveal. They mutter and stumble over how uneventful, I mean exciting, the investigation was and how they think the client was very satisfied and took the evidence well. The show ends with an extremely awkward fist bump that can only be carried off by two middle-aged white guys trying to look hip.

Bottom line:  Ghost Hunters does have some entertainment value I suppose, but if you really pay attention and break it down, you will notice they waste a lot of time, cut the investigations short and most of the show is about production and looking good. I understand SyFy is interested in ratings and putting on a good show that advertisers will pay for, but this show is far too polished and event-free for my taste. If you watch paranormal shows simply for entertainment, this is a decent choice. If you are interested in actual investigations and finding real evidence, you should probably give it a pass.",1288051200,2,13736,4.789518174133558

I've been watching Ghost Hunters (via satellite and in the States) from almost the very beginning. I've now seen the original programs and have read the books of Jason and Grant too. I have to say that I believe that ghosts may exist, but I want some kind of evidence. Some kind of proof. These investigators -- and their paranormal investigation team -- work on the same premise. They attempt to ""debunk"" paranormal claims, but when they gather evidence that is hard to ""debunk"" or ""dispute,"" they are left with evidence that may actually support life after death (i.e., ghost, paranormal activity).

While Ghost Hunters works with a scientific leaning by utilizing technical equipment from EMF meters / K2 meters, digital thermometers, night vision cameras and thermal sensor equipment, etc., other paranormal programs utilize spirit mediums and the like. While I do not discount psychic mediums and sensitives, their evidence is hard to prove or ""debunk."" Nevertheless, programs like ""Paranormal State"" and ""Paranormal Cops"" (broadcast on A&E) have their place as well. They are certainly interesting. Psychic mediums like John Edward and Chip Coffee are quite interesting. In fact, I've been watching John Edward for many years. He's gotten a bit ""mushy"" as of late (even for WE) -- his original program on SyFy used to display his medium abilities more readily. In short, more readings.

Writers and psychic researchers like Peter Cayce are also quite interesting. Peter Cayce utilizes Science, Philosophy and Religion to come up with explanations for the afterlife and reincarnation and Karma. Interesting material.

In any case, the paranormal field is an interesting one. I'd really like to see more programs about legitimate psychics and paranormal investigators like Ghost Hunters, John Edward and Peter Cayce.

2336618,4,B0009Y2726,"This is the best of all these shows out there. Ive ordered all the Seasons off of Amazon and am watching them now.
I have had paranormal experiences my whole life.
However, I do have a few problems with this show.

I think Jason and Grant are awesome but for someone who has had paranormal experiences their whole life some of the 'de-bunking' or 'dismissing' done by TAPS can become an irritant at times. The first being Jasons constant dismissal of Orbs and other light anomalies.
Yes, sometimes its dust - sometimes its an insect, but many of us get the same orbs in all of our pictures regardless of where we go, which camera is being used and so on and so fourth.
Orbs have detailed patterns distinct to that 'Orb'. Thats how you can see the same 'Orb' appearing over and over again in photos or video around one particular person.
Most people in this field respect 'Orbs as the first of a ghost manifestation because of these distinct detailed patterns when captured on film and blown up on a picture program to see up close.
You have scientists who cant even definitively tell what 'Orbs' are, and don't dismiss them as spirits - yet Jason is constantly dismissing them as - dust. Which then by doing this he effects the opinion of the rest of the investigators not to mention all those watching this show.

Most people are not going to be getting full body apparitions in their pics or video footage but many are starting to see 'Orbs'. When Jason dumps on 'Orbs' he's dumping on those experiences. Like I said, most people aren't going to be fortunate enough to have hope of an afterlife by seeing an actual apparition.

I have seen ghosts and apparitions, most dont. Many do however get 'Orbs.
To dump on that as 'nothing but dust' is dumping on those experiences when calling 'Orbs 'dust' or 'debris' which in many cases - is not true or fair for Jason to say.

Second,
I am glad he has finally stated that 'Ghosts don't haunt on cue.' Because to deem a place 'Haunted or not' after only a few hours of investigation is nonsense. Spirits can be very active for weeks, then a few days or months will pass and you'll get nothing. When TAPS runs in for a few hours and then says a place is 'Haunted or Not' depending on whether the ghosts put on a Broadway show for them or not (since Jason ignores all Orbs and light anomalies and won't accept them from his crew because hes the boss)is also ridiculous.

In order to properly investigate a place you should give it its fair day in court. Im talking at minimal a week. Because once again, TAPS leaves, didn't find anything in the 6 hours they spent there, and the people who called now not only feel stupid but shamed like they were 'making it up' when they werent.

Third,
It gets very annoying when your straining to hear an EVP (A Ghost voice they caught on recorder) and you got the sound people adding in 'scary, loud' music blasting in the background completely disabling you from hearing the EVP. Could the sound people in future Seasons of Ghost Hunters not have this irritating music playing while were trying to hear what they caught on voice recorder??

Fourth,
Episode after episode we have Jason and Grant seeing Shadows, Ghosts, this and that. What do we see? The cameraman stuck on Jasons and Grants face...........Then we got Grant and Jason saying 'We got no way to back that up since it wasn't on camera and is just a personal experience'

Why cant they wear a miniature camera on their head instead of a TAPS baseball cap so we can see what they see to?
Episode after episode they see everything, we see almost nothing but their face and their reaction to what they just saw but we didn't get to see...All it would take is a small camera giving us their perspective..

I know it sounds like I hate the show - I dont. Otherwise I wouldnt have bought all of the Seasons on DVD off of Amazon. I appreciate that they don't try and startle and scare people but look for the truth. Jason could just do a bit more research about and be a bit more open minded when it comes to Orbs.

This is one of the top shows out there now, not to mention its been the best commercial Roter-Rooter has ever had, LOL

Im just hoping with upcoming Seasons they will make it better by letting us see what they see, giving the investigations more time then just a couple of hours, get rid of that music that disables us from hearing what audio they caught, and also stop picking on the poor Orbs Jason ;)

It's a well done show - the regulars are entertaining, and some of the evidence is pretty amazing. Suffice to say that most of the cases are either inconclusive or debunked outright, but that's the premise of the show - to debunk - and for me the debunkings are just as entertaining.

2336645,4,B0009Y2726,"I have never followed the paranormal field, including ghosts. I always used to find the topic silly. I like a good ghost story (such as what might come from the hand of Shirley Jackson or Richard Matheson), but ghost stories as told by a next door neighbor or some tourist attraction with claims of a skulking ""blue lady"" (how many ""blue ladies"" are there, anyway?) have never interested me in the least. I have always waved all this off as over-active imaginations.

So when Sci Fi Channel started running this series, I'd flip right on by it. I saw a few of the commercials and snickered to myself. I have seen way too many set-up ""reality"" TV shows. Take for example one of the earliest: Divorce Court. The host would whisper into the microphone during transitionary moments to explain what is going on, as if he was standing in a real court room during a real session. And they would presume to show you a real court case unfolding. It was all phony. It was not a court room, it was a set on a sound stage at a studio lot. The host was reading from queue cards, and all the participants were actors and the entire audience were extras. How do I know for sure? Because I was there, on set around 1986 or so, watching them tape the show (I believe it was at the Burbank studios). I watched take after take. Whether it was based upon a ""real"" case or not didn't matter, the show itself was an act. Fiction.

And not to rain on anyone's parade, but most reality shows are set-ups. Some more than others. But don't fall for everything that proudly calls itself ""reality.""

I figured Ghost Hunters featured a crew running around rigging things OFF camera so that they could make a big deal about it ON camera. I figured it was all phony, trying to pass as real.

So I missed many episodes, until one day, in early 2008, I just happened to stop on an episode while flipping by. My finger poised over the channel button. There was something that captured my interest: They were proving that a house was NOT haunted. Huh???

Slowly my finger left the channel button. Slowly I set the remote aside.

This was opposite what the previews made it seem. These guys are trying to DISPROVE hauntings, not prove them. Jason's philosophy is that if you rule out every possible realistic explanation and you still can't explain it, you *may* have evidence for paranormal, and in more extreme cases, a haunting.

Now that makes sense, and it's very interesting. So I kept watching.

I watched a few more episodes, and a few more. Fast-forward a couple weeks, and my DVR had recorded back-to-back reruns, and I was staying up late after the kids went to bed to sneak in a few more episodes. I bought their DVD's and Jason's book. I was hooked.

I do not like the Sci Fi production itself: they use too much ""spooky music"" and introduce flashes of silly ghost images in the editing. I think this not only hides the more interesting native sound from the camera, which would give us a ""baseline"" for the environment, but the distracting images and cheap FX which are intended to entertain are just irritating and dumb the show down. None of this has anything to do with Jason & Grant and their crew however.

So after being mostly a pure skeptic and having no interest in this kind of show, I am now a fan of Ghost Hunters and I'm on the fence as to what these guys are capturing. It is impossible for me to really cross the line and *believe* without actually being there to debunk myself. There are lots of questions I would ask that I don't hear asked on the show, and scientific experiments I would like to see conducted that aren't. Probably because time constraints simply edit a LOT of things out. I have to put some faith that these guys are doing the best they can.

Every now and then they bring in someone who uses divining rods, or practices some pagan craft, in order to evaluate a possible haunting, but I'm not sure what this really accomplishes toward debunking. It seems to serve only to entertain the serious paranormal believers watching the show, but I'm not that audience, so I try to look past these sidekicks. I have lots of doubts about ""sensitives,"" I think most of them are attention junkies. It's the attempts at debunking that make the show, especially when they've tried their best to debunk and simply couldn't explain something they caught on camera or on digital audio. A chair moves, a shadow blocks the light, etc.

Another aspect of this show that seems wanting is that everyone on crew is a believer. Most of them are grounded, yes, but they are believers in ghosts, no question. It'd be nice to have a really serious skeptic on the show, perhaps someone who is skilled at magic or cons -- a James Randi type of person. (Not that Jason & Grant can't detect a con -- they easily found several, but, as the old saying goes, you can't trick a trickster, and magicians are pros at it.) It would be chilling for a skeptic of this discipline to say, after a thorough inquiry and analysis, ""well, that was weird, and I just have no reasonable explanation.""

I am especially interested in all the EVP evidence, as that seems to be the most abundant, and I've never heard this kind of thing before outside of fiction. The causes are pretty limited:
  a) hoax / tampering
  b) possible radio frequency interception (very doubtful, based on what I heard)
  c) re-used tapes (bleed from previous voice recordings, also doubtful considering all the surrounding noise and the timing of some of the answers)
  d) legitimate disembodied voices.

Out of those possibilities, (b) and (c) are too weak to support. As for (a), if all these EVPs are tricks -- purposely made for the show -- someone on the ""inside"" is going to spill the beans sooner or later and that'll be the end of Jason and Grant. They just don't seem like the kind of guys would want to take that kind of risk, not with all their fans now watching. Unless someone is pulling the wool over their eyes, unbeknownst to them -- but how could that continue for so long without them catching on? They seem to have a sharp eye for skulduggery.

That leaves (d) as the strongest possibility: It's real. Which really clashes with my traditional sensibilities.

I recommend this series if you are a curious skeptic or a grounded believer. If you're a hard-core skeptic, forget it -- you'll never believe anything no matter what; and if you're a hard-core believer, what's the point? You'll believe every creaking door is a ghost entering the room. For the rest of us, open-minded and logical, this is a worthy show to study.",1218585600,5,6582,4.53035413153457

From Season One, this is one of those shows that I don't want it to ever end. I love the drama tension that was between Brian and Jason. Brian, in my opinion is a goofball who have lost some equipments, talking on cell phones way too often, and seems to have his mind else where, but he grows on you and you gotta love'em. I didn't like it when Brian claimed that the chair has flipped over and landed in the center of the hallway in the second episode of season ONE. I get a huge feeling that it was all staged from Brian out of desperation for ratings and the way he kept asking people at the cook out party if they have moved that chair, I have never seen such a guilty look on someone's face. I personally thought it was fake and Brian even admit at the end of that episode that it wasn't haunted and there was nothing there. Other than that, I love how they tried to disprove hauntings and other stuff. I LOVE the fact that Dust Particles are NOT GHOST. I hate it when people see dust flying through the air, and thinking it's a ghost, but not Jason and Grant, they KNOW it's a dust particle. I love Jason and Grant and Brian and Steve and they are so much fun to watch. I love being able to watch in the dark and be at different famous places.

With five kids ages 2-12 I was not ready to let the f-bomb fly (although I can totally understand why the guys on the show use it.....there's some amazing footage there!).

Ghost Hunters is a show dedicated to the investigations of ghosts. And what I like most about Ghost Hunters is the fact that they approach each investigation with logic and common sense, they don't try to make monsters out of every place they visit.
Often, they can and will explain away events, such as flickering lights or sounds heard or even things seen. And also as often, they show proof of their explanations on film.
Someone may contact them and say that during the night, they feel something bumping up from the basement floor. Well the team will go down into the basement and try to find out what the cause of the bumpings are. Is it supernatural or is it plumbing? I recall in one episode in one of the later seasons, a family had that very same incident, and the guys went into the basement and determined that when the water pump kicked in, loose pipes underneath the floor would it, causing vibrations. Thus, that part would be easily explained away.
But there are times(and many of them) where things occur that cannot be explained. And if you are a person who really becomes terrified at the very thought of possibly seeing a ghost, DON'T WATCH THIS DVD. Because all too often, things will go bump in the night and you'll see it right on film.
They use video cameras, thermol imaging, and audio recorders, and sometimes they catch some very scary things.
There is some foul language, but other than that nothing really negative to say about this show.",1191542400,2,1590,4.582456140350877

They have fun, they argue, they play pranks on each other and they all show a genuine need to help the people who have called on them.  Especially those with young children.  They do not want the children to be scared.  The difference between this group and other groups of ""ghost hunters"" is, they try and debunk that there are ghost or spirts in the house/buildings/ships they visit. They show the audience what is causing that creak or cold spots in rooms, etc.  They have proven, multiple times what homeowners have heard, seen or felt is because of natural happenings in the house, not paranormal.  But on occasions, they have not.  Sometimes, that leaves them wanting to check the house again. They tell the homeowners they are available all the time and to call them whenever they are needed.  This is a caring group of people, who have come up with a great way of helping others and having fun in the process.  If you are worried about getting scared while watching, it is not presented in that way.  But if you want your children to watch with you, I would still review it first.

2336714,5,B0009Y2726,"First, let me point out that Ghost Hunters is a mixture of people hunting ghosts, as the title suggests, and a show about people working together under a lot of stress.  Not just the fear and discomfort of trying to find ghosts in haunted houses and dark buildings, but also the pressure of working with a team of demanding fellow ghost hunters who all have their own skills, egos and day jobs.
It IS a Reality Series after all, with tons of cussing, people pushing each others' buttons and some yelling.  But it also shows how to hunt ghosts.  No, really, each episode breaks it down, showing us how they do a walk-thru, gather information and than filter it, looking for something solid in what could be hours of worthless video, tape after tape of silent audio and tons of photos that show zip.
Some of the places, like the Lighthouse Inn, have been on the History Channel.  Many of the places, while being scary, don't really seem to be haunted.  Or at least they can't find anything.  Lots of orbs, some voices on the tape that nobody heard before and, yes, a moving chair.  A chair that is clearly moving, on tape, when nobody else is AROUND.  In a lighthouse.  A haunted lighthouse.  Not to be confused with the Lighthouse Inn.  I would suggest grabbing this DVD set.  Some parts are scary and some parts are not.  But there is a lot of beeping going on, so be warned.  Not for kids.

So fun! I also LOVE the fact that they are all 'skeptics' and when they see a ball of lint flying across the camera they are honest enough to say, ""that is just a ball of lint"" rather than... ooh it must be a ghost orb. Whenver I have ever watched other ghost shows I get so frustrated when they point out ""orbs"" because it is obvious to me it is lint or a bug. So silly! I love that they don't use psychics or anything hokey like that. I admire that they try and debunk stuff rather than take things at face value, or assume everything is supernatural. Good show.

2336717,5,B0009Y2726,"So many programs, such as Discovery Channel's ""A Haunting,"" attempt to re-create events using bad actors, poor special effects, and other things to make the experience as scary as possible to the viewer.  Believe it or not, I actually like some of these shows.  But, when I discovered Ghost Hunters, I found that I was really fascinated!

The biggest reason I like Ghost Hunters is that it's all legit.  There are no bad actors, because the hunters are playing themselves, and we get to follow them on their quest to investigate possible paranormal sites.  There are no special effects.  They will show you how they use electromagnetic readers, thermal readers, and other equipment in their work.  It's actually very fascinating.

A lot of the time, they don't come up with any concrete evidence.  Sometimes, they will come across something that is definitely questionable.  However, even when they come across something that has a strong chance of being something paranormal, they will attempt to disprove it and debunk their own evidence.  There was one episode in a hotel where they really thought they'd caught an image on the thermal device.  Later, one of their team members was able to figure out that it was actually the reflection of the investigator holding the camera.

These are probably the last guys that would conclude that something is paranormal right on the spot.  They approach everything with a very keen, scientific perception.

There aren't a lot of scary moments in this show.  If that's what you're looking for, you might be disappointed.  If, however, you are keenly interested in seeing how ghost hunters/paranormal investigators operate, then you will probably find this show to be extremely intriguing.",1178064000,4,1730,5.078014184397163

Usually the light orbs and or accurance of a visual oddity is usually a distortion of dust or something caused by glare, but as i said earlier there are some seriously spooky moments that are completely unexplainable and by conclusion of canceling other possiblities out, its considered haunted...

The only problem i have is the sound is a bit muffled sounding on season 2's dvds, im assuming its the same with the first season aswell since it was a earlier season... but visually this isn't too bad, its not anamorphic widescreen or anything to call mom over, but its viewable and considering your getting 4 dvds for $20 bucks... your really getting a decent deal, maybe the quality of the dvds would be better if mastered and audio tracks were cleaned but then the 4 dvds would probably cost a $50 dollar price as most seasons of television are these days such as ""lost"", ""csi"", ""supernatural"", ""smallville"", ""sopranos"", and so on... i give these as examples because they contain several disc also and usually cost at least $40-$70 dollars a season...

If you are looking for something like ""Most Haunted"", you will be disappointed.  These guys actually know their stuff and try to show you what they are experiencing.

Orbs!) and go nuts over ""psychic intuition"" and crap like that.  But Ghost Hunters isn't like that at all - these people actually try to DISPROVE hauntings.  They're skeptical attitude is what makes all the difference.

The show is mostly spent watching these investigators creep around a darkened house, abandoned prison, sanitarium, or a variety of other locations, looking for evidence of paranormal activity.  Usually they don't find anything conclusive, but it's still fun and spooky watching them explore these places.  However, on the occasions when they do find something, it's actually meaningful because you know they're serious and not just getting excited over nothing.  It always leaves me seriously wondering what could have caused whatever phenomenon they experienced, you can't just dismiss it out of hand like most of the stupid shows in this genre.

There's also some ""reality show"" type stuff where the lead investigators get a bit upset with their crew (they're all volunteers) for not bringing along all the necessary equipment, not being organized, etc.  It adds a necessary insight into the personalities of the people involved and makes you feel for them.

2336754,5,B0009Y2726,"Ghost Hunters is NOT your typical reality show.  It's about a group of ghost hunters who travel across North America investigating REAL ghost sightings.  Sure, these ghost hunters are actually ordinary plumbers who have day jobs.  That does NOT mean this is some crappy nonsense show.  This show actually has a point.  It also does NOT mean that a bunch of plumbers are really just a bunch of nobodys who have an interest in the paranormal.  NOT true.  These plumbers are intelligent and have done enough research to know what they're talking about.  They're not fake at all.  Listen to the way they talk- they understand ghost activity.

A couple of the guys on the team are actually along for the ride to try and show the people who see or hear strange things that what they're seeing or hearing is not really any paranormal activity, and they take the time to try and find an explanation to help the people feel easy about living or working at the place they think is haunted.  For example, in one episode a woman hears something banging downstairs, so she calls the ghost hunters because she thinks it's a ghost.  They came over and found out it was actually just pipes banging against the stairs whenever the furnace kicked on.  Pretty interesting here.

However, there's been plenty of things that NO ONE can find an answer to, including the ghost hunters themselves.  This is truly what makes the show so great.  At the end of the investigation the team goes back and reviews the footage they shot of the haunted place they just visited.  They pick up some amazing things.  What they're doing requires patience and hard work sitting there looking at film all day trying to find *something*.  It is so COOL when they finally find something interesting and unexplainable to share.  I hope Ghost Hunters continue to produce new episodes for a long long time.

The only problem is that every episode devotes a few minutes to typical reality show nonsense.  In the middle of an investigation with the team walking around in the dark trying to pick up paranormal activity, we don't care if the hunters suddenly can't get along.  Take care of that business when the investigation is finished.  Or, another example: one of the guys on the team brings a female friend along, and they waste time trying to scare the girl senseless.  This is definitely pointless tape, in my opinion.  But by reading some of the reviews you'd think the entire show is about nonsense.  NOT TRUE.

I was truly scared on several occasions by the unexplainable events that happened in some of the haunted hotels/houses/libraries/bars/castles.  I sat back and watched the footage that the ghost hunters collected, and I could NOT find an explanation for MANY of the things I saw.  I bet you won't be able to either.  That's what makes the show so great.  I am fascinated with this kind of stuff.  Just because it's a reality show about ghosts doesn't mean it's completely fake.  Remember that.

While the investigators may not have phd's in ghost hunting, they do use a good array of detection and recording equipment in a sincere effort to find anything they can.

I think however that it is their skeptical approach from a layman's point of view that makes this series most enjoyable to me. I'm frankly tired of seeing other shows where every cold spot or creaky floorboard in a room is labeled as an obvious haunting. Which is why, in this show, when something happens that is not able to be explained, it carries a little more credence. The only down side is that, in most places they go to, nothing actually happens....which makes for a rather funny wrap up at the end with the owners of said haunted establishment.

But they are deserving of a better production team and editing. The producers keep the cameras rolling during their immature bickering and in-fighting. (Annoying and destroys their credibility sooo fast.)

The Lead investigator is in need of an anger therapist. Who'd ever want to work for this guy? He even whines and complains when they get work!!!  This guy has sooo much bad energy around him that merely inviting him into your home is asking the devil for a haunting.

If you are into ghosts and classic hauntings, This is not the format or production team. The show has potential (!) but the cast can not get along, and the producers are catering to the lowest IQs possible.",1157241600,11,1145,4.738693467336684

2336779,2,B0009Y2726,"As someone who ferverently believes in the paranormal, I say kudos to SciFi for bringing the paranormal more mainstream. For the show, I am a bit disappointed. Yes, it is exciting enough but it is REAL or is it for ratings? If I were in a production for a commercially based media source, I would be skeptical of myself.

I give this 2.5 stars for the above reason but also because of the way TAPS portrays investigators. There is too much drama being shown (though it toned down in later seasons somewhat). Also, they have a good start to scientifically prove/disprove paranormal activity, but TAPS as well as most ghost hunting groups could use a real scientific research course on what is scientific and what is not.

Also, is TAPS doing this for the people they profile and the furtherment of paranormal investigation or are they doing this for the glory? One has to wonder when they go from a port-a-pod to a storefront in two seasons and SciFi supplies them with all the gadgets they could want. Additionally, are we sure these gadgets actually measure paranormal activity?

Finally, the quality of the product is not all that swell and there are some missing episodes. The extras are non-existent. I think it was hastily thrown together to make a quick buck.",1152835200,10,1265,4.714932126696833

I am a local Psychic/Media Personality in South Florida and have been most honored to have conducted two official Seances at the world famous (and known haunted) Stranahan House (With Mindy Lang, Donna Davis and Rick Shaw of WMXJ Majic FM) - as well as other places from Key West under a Voodoo Moon to a great old privately owned countryside mansion in Bucks County, Pennsylvania that looked right out of ""The Skeleton Key"".  If you have ever wondered about the thrill of the chase, as far as ""Ghosts"" or ""Spirits"" go, treat yourself to this one - This 3 DVD set is the entire first season with bonus footage - and now I will be ordering the others they have out as well, This team is great!  I wish them every success and ""Happy Hauntings""!

I like this show because it's real. The ghost hunters way of investigating a supposedly haunted place is different from any other group. They don't claim a place is haunted until they have solid, unrefutable proof. They scrutinize every piece of evidence and don't take every picture of a supposed orb as evidence of a haunting. And what's more, not every episode has a haunted location. So they don't try to stage or create a haunted place. I also have learned a lot about ghosts and the technical aspects of them. I was somewhat afraid of ghosts before this show and now I'm not. Overall and fantastic, entertaining show!!!",1151625600,5,802,4.654929577464789

2336784,5,B0009Y2726,"I have always been a skeptic. Not necessarily of the paranormal, but of those investigating it. I have seen so many shows where people become ""possessed"" and say they see things and walk away from the scene like they've discovered something when I didn't see a thing. TAPS is different. They require evidence. They catch things both on camera and on audio. It takes a lot of evidence for them to actually say that they have a haunting. Most of the time they find other explanations for the activity. Not everything is a haunting. I'M HOOKED ON THIS SHOW. I have great respect for these guys. They are very level headed. They might even convert a skeptic.",1148860800,6,654,4.598290598290598
2336795,5,B0009Y2726,"First let me start by saying i don't watch television and go out of my way to view this show at friends and relatives homes!

  The Atlantic Paranormal Society aka TAPS was established in 1990 by Jason Hawes after having a personal paranormal experience. The group's goal is to find out whether people are experiencing true paranormal activity or if the activity is be caused by ordinary circumstances. One of the reasons that TAPS is so reputable is the fact that they go into an investigation with the intent of trying to debunk the haunting. Their approach to the field is a scientific one, using various forms of equipment to document and back up any unexplainable evidence they may capture. The team members vary from show to show but the core members are likable and make the show fun to watch. Not all of the episodes capture paranormal activity but the ones that do are well worth the wait. Some of the things they catch are just plain amazing and strange.

  Being a paranormal investigator myself, I love watching the show b/c they are professional and technical, never settling for questionable proof such as orbs. I am certain that even the most die hard skeptic with a reasonable, open mind will come away from season one somewhat of a believer.

  In short this show is real and TAPS is a respectable research team on a mission to explain the unexplained. I LOVE this show and can't wait for season two on DVD!",1148342400,6,1424,4.619047619047619

I however am a skeptic and I don't believe in ghosts.  The Ghost Hunters Series introduces Roto Rooter Plumbers Jason and Grant who are plumbers by day and real life ghost hunters (TAPS) by night.  In every episode, the Ghost Hunters visit places that are supposedly haunted and search for evidence using scientific technology -- although they are not beyond getting assistance from a Wican or some Demonologists.  In the first season, they investigate prisons, museums, people's homes, light houses and a military armory.  They hunt for a ghost who violently throws a child's toys around an attic, a little girl who sees and talks to ghosts and a a ghost bride who haunts a honeymoon suite.  This DVD also contains several bonus features:  Deleted scenes, behind the scenes action and an interview with Jason and Grant.

I absolutley love the one of the Light House off of New London when the chair moves and flips over by itself. Interestingly enough, when you watch the video on TAPS website, at the end of the video you can actually see a faint outline of a man.  This was not featured on the show. But, trust me it's very clearly there.

It's totally enjoyable  to watch the comic shannagan's of Brian, formerly head of the Tech Dept. He seems to be like the guy with the black cloud that everyone loves and loves to dump on. He adds color to the story lines with a comic relief.  His antics are fun to watch.

Jason and Grant are not your ""A"" typical Ghost Hunters that jump and scream ""haunting"" loosely. Quiet the opposite. They look at everything from all points of view which I find make them all the more credible. I think their point of view makes us take a closer look to what could be consider everyday interference vs. true paranormal.

It will help you rethink if you have something ""paranormal"" going on in your home and motivate you to do some of your own investigating to see if what you are experiencing is being cause by nothing more then something in your home you may have overlooked.

2336821,2,B0009Y2726,"With a simple, yet catchy title, ""Ghost Hunters"" seems like a show that would be extremely interesting. While the topic is, the group and the way they portray themselves, are anything but interesting.

The lead investigators spend more time becoming agitated with eachother than paying attention to their ghostly environment. These plumbers by day and ghost hunters by night leave a taste in your mouth reminiscent of the Super Mario Bros. It's difficult to become entranced in the spooky ambiance of the locations when just as they're about to possibly get something in the middle of the night, they cut to a shot of these pretenders in their roto rooter plumbing truck in broad daylight. What a way to kill the momentum!!!

Demonologists, psychics, and equipment incapable of detecting paranormal entities are just a few of the things that leave these so-called ""ghost hunters"" with lots to learn about how to scientifically and tangibly investigate hauntings.

In short, you cannot begin to prove the paranormal with something considered paranormal itself!!!",1132012800,4,1061,5.229411764705882

So I finally get it, open it up and Disc 2 comes flying out, not to mention scratched beyond all belief. I was livid to say the least.

So I contacted Amazon Customer Service, which promply issued me a replacment that I received today. I was near ecstatic to open it, dying to finally watch what I had waited so long for. When I did, Disc 1 and 3 came flying out, not to mention scratched as well. At this point I have simply given up getting this item undamaged and have settled for mere less damage, it's ludicrous.

Thankfully this go around, the product isn't so damaged that I can't watch all 3 discs. Come one Amazon, you really let me down this time. Is it really so hard to ask for undamaged goods?

With that said, the Season set is great, that is if you can actually get a copy shipped to you that is able to be watched and doesn't skip every few minutes, what a disappointment!!!

2336824,5,B0009Y2726,"Ever wanted to hunt ghosts?  Ever wanted to know how to fix that leaky faucet?  Well, you're in luck if you pick up ""Ghost Hunters:  The Complete First Season.""  Stars Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson, the plumbers-by-day/ghost-hunters by night, are two of the best guys on television these days.  Why?  For the simple fact that they, along with the rest of the members of TAPS, don't seem to be doing this reality series for their own profit, but for the profit of their clients and any and everyone who has ever been interested in hunting ghosts or other paranormal entities.

On this DVD set, you can follow Jason, Grant, Brian, Steve, and the rest of the TAPS(The Atlantic Paranormal Society) gang as they travel across the country in search of so-called haunted places.  I tag them ""so-called"" because TAPS attempts to disprove that a haunting actually exists at each location.  Sometimes they can prove it, other times they can't.  In fact, most of the places they visit in season one turn up very little proof of actual hauntings.  The few times that they do find evidence, it's usually pretty shocking.

Each episode covers cases where we get to see the ups and downs of investigating haunts.  Sometimes Jason yells at Brian.  Okay, MOST of the time, Jason yells at Brian.  Other times, the group grabs some amazing footage.  Every once in awhile, the group comes across something that they cannot disprove.  Much of the time, they can dismiss ""hauntings"" as overactive imaginations, old, creaky houses, or just plain ol' dust.

What really grabbed me about TAPS is that they go into each investigation expecting to find nothing.  Jason and Grant, and Andy as the series progressed, could often pick up on what was causing a ""haunt"" very quickly.  When they couldn't place something, they were still very slow to use the ""H"" word.

The group works together in almost soap opera-like fashion.  They gripe amongst themselves, they laugh, and they have a deep concern for each others safety as well as that of their many clients.  They come off as very professional and very serious about their work.

We also get to look into the normal side of Jason and Grant's lives as Roto-Rooter plumbers.  If you listen carefully, you can also nab a tip here and there about plumbing.

With EVPs, video evidence, and some great team members, Season One of ""Ghost Hunters"" is a great buy worthy of repeat viewings.  There are a few deleted scenes and a paranormal dictionary included on the discs, but the really good stuff is the investigations.  They are fun to watch and sometimes they will pick at your brain as you try to take in what you see, such as a chair moving by itself and a few other strange things.  The DVD can be grainy at times, making dark scenes even darker, but overall this is a great collection to own.  Also, there's a coupon good until the end of this year with which you can buy two TAPS shirts for the price of one.  Who could ask for more?

Great job TAPS, this ain't your typical cemetary hopping ghost hunts.  This is serious investigation with heart.

8069995,3,B0009Y2726,"I'd like to preface my review by saying I'm halfway between a skeptic and a believer - but only because I've had my own experiences that can't be explained away. Point being - I can relate to where these guys are coming from (the 2 lead investigators) in that they are both skeptics and seem predisposed to explain away everything, even evidence that might warrant further investigation. I understand that they were financing their own adventures (at least in the beginning) so maybe they just didn't have the resources to stay for more than a few hours at any single location, or follow up by returning at a later date.

The real issue I have with the series so far (only seen season 1) is that it's called ""Ghost Hunters,"" but they never seem to FIND anything. Might as well call it ""Dust Busters,"" since even the orbs they discover are always explained away as dust. I have no problem with that - better a rational explanation than an airy-fairy true believer on the loose - so I can appreciate the healthy skepticism. I'm mainly disappointed because I had hoped to see SOME evidence of SOMETHING other than our mundane (and finite) human lives. All humans need to believe we have some sort of afterlife (even those who pretend they don't believe it at all). It's called a healthy survival instinct - we want to live, even after we die. Some of the people who were experiencing the paranormal events were very convincing - I believed something had happened to them and that they were genuinely looking for answers. Others along the way seemed like they were looking for some sort of proof that their business establishment was ""haunted"" so they could put it on their Facebook page as a lure to potential customers. Either way - the ghost hunters were always fair and gracious, so I can't fault them for that.

My only other gripe is that too many of the team members seem to do a lot of infighting on camera - and while some may find that fun to watch, I just find it to be a waste of time. In any work environment, there will always be conflicts, personality issues, and so forth. I'm hoping that kind of inner bickering will disappear from future seasons or be kept to a minimum.

Overall, there were a couple of high points in the first season - the one of Race Rock Lighthouse when the chair moved by itself and was actually caught on film, and the other in a subsequent episode when the sound man was seemingly attacked, knocked to the ground, and clearly shocked by whatever happened. Beyond those 2 incidents... it was mostly a bunch of guys running around in the dark. Like I said, I don't fault them for their skepticism, but unless the series improves dramatically in subsequent seasons, I'll probably hunt some different ghosts.",1515542400,,2742,4.580448065173116
