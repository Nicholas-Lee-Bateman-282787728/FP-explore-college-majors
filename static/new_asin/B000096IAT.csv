7989814,5,B000096IAT,"Love trading spaces I am so sad that it went off air! I wish they would bring out more dvd's with different episodes on them but maybe with time. This dvd is great becuase it is some of the episodes people seem to enjoy most. It has only 4 episodes which i wish it had more but beggers can't be chosers! It has host Paige Davis along with two sets of families, two designers and one carpenter. You get to watch as they swap rooms, get a $1,000 budget,  no say of what goes on in their room, and recreate a living space for their neighbors. The homeowners will tell what they would like to see and the designer gets pretty much free reign to do what they want with the space, hopefully to the liking of the homeowner. It's a great show and always makes me think you know what I could do that!",1422403200,,791,4.103225806451613
7989815,1,B000096IAT,This dvd was okay but way too short and not worth the money. I have ordered the entire season of Project Runway for the same amount of money and it included 3-4 dvd's. Don't waste your money on this one.,1305417600,2,203,4.1
7989816,4,B000096IAT,"What a great way to get inspired to make changes, showing you how to get started, how to think differently about where you live and what you can afford. Also, if you're open minded you learn about what makes a room something to LIVE in instead of just exist in. It's interesting to see the people too, the ones who get it, what they can learn from it, whether they like the colors or fabrics (which can be changed easily) and the ones who don't and complain about great changes, obviously because they'd rather live in chaos for the rest of their lives.",1248048000,,553,4.378640776699029
7989817,5,B000096IAT,"If you want to watch the show six times, this one's for you.  I enjoyed watching the new ideas unfold.  Six shows for ten bucks!  What a deal!",1181347200,2,142,4.0
