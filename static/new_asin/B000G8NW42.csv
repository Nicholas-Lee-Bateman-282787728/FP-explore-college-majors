8482534,5,B000G8NW42,Chaya Czernowin's critically acclaimed first venture into the field of music theater is a work of unique force.  Her rich personal musical language coupled with the stunning staging of the piece reach a place few other pieces of music theater even dare approach.,1200960000,,262,5.093023255813954
8482535,1,B000G8NW42,"Chaya Czernowin would be a very interesting composer if she stuck to instrumental miniatures.  As an opera composer she is very disappointing, to say the least.  This DVD is is not visually stimulating at all. I don't think it should even be called an opera.  It is some sort of multimedia-slash video art - slash experimental theatre piece base on the Holocaust. I am not sure what the viewer/listener is supposed to take away after viewing this opera.??? Angst, fear, outrage?  I was not sure what to feel while listening and watching ""Pnima"".  Totally confusing for the audience in my opinion.

Mode is usually a very interesting label, however their DVD series have so far been mediocre.  They've got a lot to learn from the European labels.  Anyone interested in contemporary music DVDs should rather spend their money on releases from JUXTAPOSITIONS French label.  All of their DVDs have been outstanding so far.",1174262400,3,918,4.947712418300654
