8186663,5,B000OU0786,"Even for someone like I, who do not care for the action genre, ""Final Contract: Death on Delivery"", filmed in Germany, is quite an exciting and action-packed motion picture that pleases enormously. One thing that helps is that, unlike so many action films, it is not hard to follow the plot of Final Contract, even though it does have its complexities; things ""hang together"" and make sense, without the confusion that so often besets the viewer of thrillers of this genre. Wanting to see this in widescreen display, I watched a French only (with no subtitles) release of it, titled ""Poursuite assassine (V.V.S. Films 1149).

Andrew (Drew) Alan Fuller, a young  actor of exquisitely serene, rather epicene beauty (at least that still was so in 2006, the year of Final Contract), who, along the path of his career in entertainment,  had made numerous appearances  as a nude model and as an actor in erotic films, turns out to be quite a fine actor in this mainstream action movie.  An example of a not-quite-buck-naked erotic film in which he participated, nonetheless exposing to view most of Fullers and the other cast members flesh, is David DeCoteaus movie (one, admittedly, made for video- rather than theatrical-release), Voodoo Academy. Other early work of Drew Fuller in erotic photography and video was full-frontal, often frankly salacious.

Whatever he does in his artistic career, Drew Fuller rivets the attention so commandingly that it is easy to become almost obsessively hooked on him. Whether Fullers striking level of appeal will survive advancing age, with its usual toll of diminishing physical allure, only time can tell. A stunningly beautiful man like the great Paul Newman never has lost his power as a very accomplished, ingeniously subtle actor, despite his (admittedly graceful) ageing and the relative dimming of his sheer earlier glamour. Will that fortunate fate await Drew Fuller and will his already considerable dramatic talents mature to such a level?

Few such male models manage to make the transition from nude modelling and video to television and film, but Drew Fullers talent was too extraordinary to limit its opportunities in the usual way. As if visibly to shun the image that he had in his work nude and in erotic video, Fuller in Final Contract wears baggy clothes that partially conceal just how  sleekly fine and leanly muscled his body, of such willowy looks, really is. Fullers beautiful and expressive face reflects the emotions and intentions of the fleeing Davids predicament and stratagems. His portrayal of David Glover in Final Contract has a kind of depth that one seldom encounters in action films.

The other principal roles include two strikingly attractive women, Davids girlfriend and colleague at work, Jenny (played by Tanja Wenzel), blond and floridly lovely, and, quite the opposite type, Lara (performed by Alison King), the black-haired, exotic-looking devil-woman, professional assassin (wielding a deadly crossbow). Lara seduces David (with little female or male nudity on display in their sex scene) and, in short order through a clever manoeuvre, she also manages to shift the blame for the murder, of the V.I.P.  whom she has executed, upon David. Both women act out their parts with much physical skill, especially King as the superbly athletic villainess.

This is an exceptionally good and lucid crime-action movie. Obtain and enjoy it, in whatever language you choose to view it!",1468108800,,3454,5.15

8186665,4,B000OU0786,"Let me say first of all that you could drive a bus through all the plot holes in this movie. So predictable. BUT, yes, there is a but! Drew Fuller is just so likeable that he lends a lot of credence to his part, he is also the most unlikely action star and that makes it FUN and Exciting. I enjoyed this movie a lot. The girl who played his girlfriend from work, I did like her too but she was hard to understand sometimes, very thick German accent. This is simply a good old fashioned fun and action-y movie.",1437091200,,509,4.1

8186669,3,B000OU0786,"This is about a a young man who works for his uncle's courier service and unexpectedly picks up a female passenger who is running from the police. He ends up getting involved with her and finding out she is a hit-man/killer wanted for multiple murders who winds up letting him take the blame for the assassinations going on of witnesses to something she has been hired to take out.
He end's up being a fugitive and getting friends involved to help aid his escapes and help capture the real killer wanted.

Overall, it's not a bad movie. There are some things that puzzled me about why it was supposed to be in Germany when everyone has American or British accents, but I may have misinterpreted something in the movie.

There is plenty of car chase action not done in CGI that was pretty impressive for what looked to be not a low budget picture, but not a very high one either.

It was a pretty fun little movie that I think deserves a rental if these sort of movies take your interest.",1236988800,4,987,4.412087912087912
