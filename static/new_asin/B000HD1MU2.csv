2634383,4,B000HD1MU2,"In Perfect in Ten Pilates, certified Pilates instructor Annette Fletcher offers five 10-minute Pilates practices which both focus on different parts of the body as well as promote general flexibility.  Given the short time frame for each workout, Fletcher moves quickly through the exercises, wasting little time on setting up the moves.  Therefore, I would not recommend this DVD for those new to Pilates; in fact, the middle three programs are quite challenging and thus more suited to those with an intermediate level of experience with the Pilates technique.

The five workouts included on this DVD are as follows:

1. Get Up & Go.  This is a gentler workout, almost like a pre-Pilates routine with gentle stretches.
2. Pilates Focus--Abs.  This segment ups the intensity quite a bit from the first one; it offers a more traditional Pilates sequence with moves such as the hundred, roll-ups, the series of five, and the roll-over.
3. Strong Arms & Back.  This workout includes many Pilates exercises rarely seen in Pilates videos, such as leg pull downs, full side bends, twists, and breast stroke.
4. Legs & Glutes. This segment includes the Pilates side kick series, glute work, kneeling side kicks, bridge work, and a hip stretch to finish.
5. Freedom & Flexibility.  Includes stretches for the lower back such as tree stretch, rolling like a ball, and open leg rocker as well as full body stretches such as mermaid.

This DVD would be well-suited to those with some Pilates experience who are looking for a straightforward, no-nonsense Pilates video.  The short segments can easily be used together to create a longer workout if time allows but work fine on their own as well.  Overall, a solid Pilates workout, and I would definitely recommend it.",1229299200,12,1756,4.97945205479452
2634384,4,B000HD1MU2,"There's pros and cons to this DVD... mostly pros...but if you're new to pilates, like me, then some of the more complex moves take time to learn.  The instructor could give some better explanations, however overall the workouts are challenging and effective.
I bought the Perfect in 10 Pilates and rotate between the two.",1226361600,4,321,4.944444444444445
2634385,5,B000HD1MU2,"No excessive chatter or overly instructive.  This DVD is a true keeper!  Nice to see an instructor off the beaten path that is as talented as those mega instructors.

Anne is easy to watch and follow with a nice voice.  Cues wonderfully and is not overly repetitious.

I really enjoy her own spin on some of the exercises as well.  Takes it to another level.

Good job, Anne!  :)",1200009600,7,379,4.391304347826087

Good video!",1310688000,,176,5.068965517241379
8138550,5,B000HD1MU2,"I am going to order this dvd right now.  I so agree about what a great instructor Annette is.  No nonsense.  I currently have her Perfect in 10 Stretch and I use yoga dvds now and loved her 10 minutes of yoga.  Simplifies so well.  Good job, Annette!",1304726400,,250,4.125

8138552,4,B000HD1MU2,"I'm really not a pilates person.  With this dvd, I now own 3 pilates dvds as compared to about 30 yoga dvds.  And one of my pilates dvds (Trudie Stylet core strength) isn't  really traditional pilates, plus it's quite easy.  I also own Christin McGee's weight loss pilates which I have only done one as it is way too hard.  This little gem is right in the middle.  Not too hard and not too easy.  I like the teaching style and the sequencing of the exercises.  I only gave it four stars because the music was a bit annoying and the movements didn't match the music tempo.  Not bothersome for most but very annoying for me. I wish that all yoga/pilates dvds had a no music option.

Other reviewers have given details so to end I will say that if you are looking for a straight forward pilates dvd that includes most of what you might find in an intermediate class ie.,walking push-ups and full teaser, then get this dvd.  You will not be disappointed.  This one will stay in my rotation.",1281225600,2,986,4.357142857142857
8138553,4,B000HD1MU2,"I would say I am at an intermediate level of fitness and have a couple other pilates videos.  This instructor is non-annoying and explains the moves very clearly --- first doing ""half"" the move, then going into the full move e.g., legs and arms not fully extended to show motion, then fully extends arms and legs to do the harder, complete motion.

That said, I felt like every time I felt myself starting to break a sweat, the set would be over.  Never really felt like I got a serious workout.  The moves are fine, it's just that more of them needed to be done or something.  Great for beginners, though, learning the moves or just getting back in shape and need something challenging but not discouraging.",1279670400,2,708,4.543307086614173
8138554,3,B000HD1MU2,"Annette Fletcher's Perfect in Ten Pilates is a nice little whole-body workout, including light warmup and stretching.

First, a clarification: there are five segments. I suppose that the first one wasn't advertised as a workout segment since it's more of a warmup, but it does consist of pilates moves. Also, doing all five segments adds up to about 57 minutes of exercise. Somewhere, the math is off.

Fletcher is straightforward and clear -- no perky encouragements here. I like that every single move and breath are cued. I also like that, for tougher moves, she will have you do a preparatory movement sequence, and that she sometimes shows modifications. (This is especially the case for ab work.)

The movements are indeed difficult, especially to do precisely. Still, except for the abs section, I can't say I really felt much of a burn. Doing the arm, leg and glute work felt more like pleasant stretching than strength training. I've had a more intense workout from other pilates programs.

All in all, I'll probably do the program again, though probably when I want a wake-up and stretching regimen with some mild strength training.",1247529600,4,1142,4.963350785340314
8138555,5,B000HD1MU2,"I love this dvd! I've been using it for about 2 weeks now and I can feel and see the difference in my body already.
