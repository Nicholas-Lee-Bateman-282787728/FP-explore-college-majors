6028245,4,B00FRE6OFO,FAMILY MOVIE IS GOOD,1406505600,2,20,4.25
6028246,5,B00FRE6OFO,"This film really conveys it's message of following Christ.  Film production quality is superb and the cast did a great job of making Jesus, Peter, and John (and everyone else very believable",1397174400,22,190,4.9375
6028247,3,B00FRE6OFO,One of the few videos that cover this scene from the Bible.  The quality and acting are okay for religious education purposes. Not very entertaining if you are watching for just enjoyment.,1396137600,,188,4.875
6028248,4,B00FRE6OFO,"The movie was done very well, and I liked it. However, I would have liked it to be a longer movie; it is only about 35 minutes in duration.",1395187200,14,139,3.8275862068965516
6028249,3,B00FRE6OFO,"Three stars for the story (which I thought was accurate to the Bible, tho some others did not).  IMO the actor portraying Jesus was dreadfully miscast.",1488672000,,151,4.8076923076923075
6028250,3,B00FRE6OFO,"This short film has a great message. However, I feel that the main characters could have been much better. Jesus looks a bit older than he should be and at times Peter acted a bit immature and childlike...but again, very good message just not the best acting or character choice.",1488585600,,279,4.6

6028262,3,B00FRE6OFO,Good,1483920000,,4,4.0
6028263,1,B00FRE6OFO,"This movie is unfortunately a waste of money. I really like Bruce Marchiano, but not here. ""Come Follow Me"" comes off as if each scene was shot in one take, and there are some serious deviations from Scripture as well.

Many of Marchiano's movies capture a characterization of a powerful Jesus with an ability to look into a man's soul with warmth and compassion. And thereby the viewer just might feel the same thing going on within himself.

In this movie Marchiano just comes off as stilted due to a bad script, bad directing, and weak supporting actors. I am actually going to throw this in the trash as it is not at all a good representation of some (should be) powerful interactions between Peter and Jesus. I would not want to share such an effort with someone truly seeking to know what Jesus truly was all about.

If you are like me and really enjoyed ""The Encounter"" (etc.), you will probably want to see this one as I did. But boy what a totally different and very poor offering.",1483574400,7,990,4.488888888888889
6028264,3,B00FRE6OFO,Not a lot of emotion in this edition. Thought there would be more on Peter's greatness following Christ's death.,1483228800,,112,4.947368421052632

6028270,4,B00FRE6OFO,"Makes the interactions between Jesus and His disciples real, not flat, as sometimes just reading the Bible can flatten the dimensions of relationships.  This is not the full history of Jesus, it comes through as this phrase was an encouragement and inspiration for Peter through his time with Jesus, especially after the crucifixion.",1479513600,,333,5.283018867924528

6028274,5,B00FRE6OFO,This is a short and to the point film. Fair quality but it does put the truth of Christ out there and would be good for people who really don't know what being a Christian is all about.,1478304000,,185,3.8947368421052633

6028286,4,B00FRE6OFO,Great especially for those who do not know the gospel. Great acting.,1473984000,,68,4.75
6028287,5,B00FRE6OFO,"If you are a follower of Christ - this is a great short way to continue to mediate and glory at a glimpse of Jesus with Peter.  If you aren't devoted spiritual person - I suspect you would rate this 3.5 stars or so. Bruce Marchiano reprises his VISUAL BIBLE (MATTHEW) role as Jesus and brings an earnestness and warmth not found in many portrayals.

Production values aren't embarrassing and it succeeds (in my opinion) at touching on the highlights of a very well known story.",1473465600,,477,4.534883720930233

6028305,5,B00FRE6OFO,"Nice to see a real looking Jesus and Jews for once.
Biblically close. Worth watching? Definitely",1466553600,,96,5.0625
6028306,4,B00FRE6OFO,"Not bad for a 34 minute summary of the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus, according to John's Gospel.  I Liked that it was from Peter's perspective.  And, for those that said it wasn't ""Biblically accurate,"" John's Gospel is much different than the 3 Synoptic gospels.  It seemed pretty close to the story from John's Gospel.",1466553600,5,329,4.945454545454545

6028314,5,B00FRE6OFO,"It's always difficult to be able to portray Christ in movies, audiences are at various stages in growths with the scriptures. I think that he did great job especially with the look of mercy from Christ e.g after Peter's denials.",1464652800,,228,4.725
6028315,4,B00FRE6OFO,Well done!,1464566400,,10,4.5
6028316,3,B00FRE6OFO,"I liked that the movie made the basic message of Jesus pretty clear in such a short length of time. The over-gesturing and choppy speech of the actor portraying Jesus gave a sense of him being condescending. I also noticed that some things were not very scripturally accurate.  (Example: Jesus having Peter re-cast his nets while fishing. The movie seems to indicate this happening after the resurrection. I believe the Bible records this as happening when Jesus and Peter first met.) Even so, all-in-all, it doesn't really affect the message getting across.

If you're trying to reach non-believers or ""babes-in-Christ"", this movie could be good. For those who have progressed from ""milk"" to ""meat"", this movie leaves something to be desired.",1463356800,2,743,5.132231404958677

6028330,5,B00FRE6OFO,"I was happily surprised at the high quality of the production, but more importantly the content that so naturally portrays the conversation Jesus had with his disciples. Because the content is not specifically recorded in the Gospels, it is up to the writers to be faithful to what the rest of scripture describes was Jesus' plan of salvation. To anyone already familiar with the account this is an uplifting portrayal; to anyone learning of it for the first time this is a clear, concise narrative.",1458432000,,499,4.882352941176471

6028336,5,B00FRE6OFO,"I loved the Gospel of Matthew movie, the Road to Emmaus movie and I loved this wonderful Lord's Supper to his ascension account. It is really uplifting. I would say though that they should have mentioned baptism in it. Mark 16:16 and Acts 2:38.",1457049600,,244,4.568181818181818

6028341,5,B00FRE6OFO,"My kids and I just watched this together.  I watched it last year at my church, and was so excited to find it on Amazon Prime.  There might be higher budget movies out there, but the message of the gospel of was clearly stated here in this film, and that is why I watched it with my children.  I believe it was created short on purpose.  I suggest opening up the Bible and reading the Scriptures to learn the rest of the story.  That's what we are doing as a family.  Also, ""The Road to Emmaus"" and ""My Son My Savior"" are two other excellent movies.",1456012800,5,549,4.132075471698113

6028348,2,B00FRE6OFO,"The true meaning, I did not care much for any of the actors, it seemed to rehearsed, as if the were reading the cue cards. The other part that was so out of time was everyone seemed to be so well groomed, really.

6028353,3,B00FRE6OFO,"The story is beautifully told. The cinematic value is top notch. The only problem with this is the acting of the main character. It's acted badly, in a very patronizing, over the top dramatic way that I cringed a lot watching this. I like Bruce Marchiano and have seen several movies with him, but in this one here I didn't like him much, which in turn took away from the story. If the viewer finds themselves noticing the overacting more than the message, then the short movie is a miss. If I would meet this Jesus, I would not take him very seriously. And I am a Christian who appreciated the story of this extremely. I wish I could give this more stars but all I remember is a very badly acted Jesus. Which says much about the film itself. I missed it.",1453075200,,755,4.286713286713287

I understand it isn't a simple task put something heartfelt and impactful on screen as The Saviour's life. There are times something gets lost in the translation and delivery of such a project which has been done hundreds of times previously ( counting funds , location , production, etc) can fall emotionally short in its finished delivery.  I believe the architects had their hearts set on creating a very spiritually moving piece from their own perspective, unfortunately, I didn't feel it as deeply as I should have.",1442016000,,684,4.796610169491525

6028380,5,B00FRE6OFO,"After watching almost every movie about the life and History of Christ, Bruce Marchiano is my all-time favorite actor for playing Jesus!  His big warm inviting smile, kind eyes, and the way Jesus seems to speak through him as he portrays the Son of God as a warm, loving, charismatic Savior who not only loves the World, but also invites the world to love him.  That is the Jesus I follow, the one who says Come Unto Me, not the stoic, sometimes depressing manner Christ is often portrayed as.  This Jesus makes me want to go follow Christ all over again. Also check out the ""Gospel According to Matthew"" as well.",1438128000,,613,4.504504504504505

Nothing against him but he seemed out of character in that role.  Although filmed back in 1970, I believe that Jesus of Nazareth is the most Biblically accurate Bible film ever made. The cast were all major movie stars except oddly, Jesus. I had never seen the actor before or since. Mary was a similar scenario but both actors were awesome in their roles. The Best  Bible movie ever and one of the best movies of any kind ever. Originally made for TV 10 part  mini-series. Made by Franco Zeferelli and starred Lawrence Olivier, Rod Steiger, Christopher Plummer, Michael York and many other major stars of that era.",1429920000,,731,4.6875
