8062080,3,B0009JVOMA,"As in his Bayreuth production, director Harry Kupfer devises an alternative narrative for Wagner's ""Siegfried,"" one in which Wotan is covertly guiding Siegfried's actions, whether by manipulating the Forest Bird or goading Siegfried into breaking the spear. This plays hob with the notion of a free-willed hero but there's leeway in the text to justify it. Barely. The World Ash remains omnipresent, save in the first act, which Kupfer places in an impressive, multi-story industrial facility. (Even with all that technology at his disposal, Mime still can't forge a decent sword.)

""Siegfried"" stands or falls on the title character, which puts a heavy burden on John Treleaven. In a provincial theater one might welcome his ironclad sound and dramatic acuity. Here it's just not enough to compensate for unvarying tone color and effortful production. When Mime has a bigger voice than Siegfried's, something is amiss. By Act 3, Scene 2 one has heard enough, but that's when Deborah Polaski comes to the rescue. In almost all respects she is an exceptional Brnnhilde, save for wiry top notes. (Only Anne Evans on Kupfer I [Teldec] is the total package.) A returnee from Kupfer I, Graham Clark remains one of the great Mimes, vocally and physically agile beyond description. There's a bit more Sprechstimme in his vocalism now but one is loath to complain about one of the two best facets of this performance.

Falk Struckmann (Wotan) gets through Act I on Bayreuth Bark but improves for the rest of the opera, although his nondescript tone and ""rabid chipmunk"" embrochure have worn out their welcome. Terfel (Luisi/DG), James Morris (Levine/DG) and even Tomlinson (Kupfer I) are all easily preferable. Even Gunther von Kannen is running on fumes. If you want his Alberich -- and you should -- he's better on Kupfer I. Ekkehard Wlaschiha (Levine/DG) and Eric Owens (Luisi/DG) also surpass his Kupfer II effort. Eric Halfvarson is a stupendous Fafner but Andrea Bonig's Erda is pallid, while Christina Obregon's Forest Bird is no challenge to Dawn Upshaw (Levine/DG).

Since so much of the opera spins on the Siegfried/Mime axis, that ought to be a prime consideration. Brnnhilde's contribution is relatively limited, meaning we can look past the problematic contributions of Hildegard Behrens (Levine/DG) and Deborah Voigt (Luisi/DG). Levine has Siegfried Jerusalem and the great Heinz Zednik and very good they are, although competing with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra takes its toll on Jerusalem. He's heard to best advantage in Kupfer I (in the singer-friendly environs of Bayreuth), paired with Graham Clark -- the best combination, for my money. Jay Hunter Morris (Luisi/DG) is a dashing young Siegfried with a Heldentenor to match and Gerhard Siegel is a Mime worthy of comparison with Clark and Zednik,  Conductor Bertrand de Billy initially opts for fleeting tempos (under the circumstances, a wonderful idea) but goes into slow motion for the love duet: ""Ewig war Ich"" brings on an outright work stoppage.

It essentially comes down to how much grit-and-bear-it do you want in the final scene. (I exempt Polaski from this.) If you can accept Behrens or Voigt, you will be rewarded with a splendidly realistic production -- more so in the latter case. But if you want a ""Siegfried"" that is second to none in all departments, Kupfer/Teldec is your go-to choice.",1491609600,,3372,5.134790528233151
8062081,2,B0009JVOMA,"The production is not eye catching, instead a little visually repulsive. I do like the production of  Harry Kupfer For the Bayreuth ring, and although some elements of this one are withdrawn from that, here these elements acquired a very poor visual effect. Music execution is neither bad nor excelent, just plane ok. I did not like the voice pitch of Treleaven.",1398384000,2,362,4.838709677419355
8062082,2,B0009JVOMA,"One star for Falk Struckman, one of the best Wotan I ever heard , and one star for Graham Clark, one first class Mime . The others singers are very problematic. Andrea Bnig as  Erda has nothing to do with the role . But the big problem here is John Trevealan  (Siegfried). There are moments that it is very painful to listen to him. The last phrase he sings before the Orchestral Intermezzo for the closing scene ( Jetzt lock'ich ein liebes Gesell ) is shameful.  The beginning of the closing scene , when he arrives at Brnhilde's rock is the worst moment of this DVD.

  Deborah Polaski hasn't the resources for Brnhilde. And Gnter von Kannen as Alberich is dramatically a disaster. Fafner (Eric Halfvarson ) and The Bird ( Cristina Obregn) are vocally very good. But no one buy one expensive DVD like this because of  the Wood Bird.

  I really think the Kupfer's direction old fashioned . This  post nuclear universe......This is so old now...The set of the first act is awful , and I can't understand  costumes like that of Wotan and Brunhilde. And the idea of Wotan answering Siegfried's horn in a second horn is ridiculous

  As in Die Walkre , Bertrand de Billy , the conductor, is very irregular. The first act is superb. But the last part of the third act is so slow...and the tenor is so tired...a disaster. The solo violins at the beginning of this last scene is very problematic too.

  In DVD the best solution for Siegfried is Boulez /Cheareau . And the best tenor as Siegfried in DVD is Siegfried Jerusalem. And if you want to listen without sufering this magnificent score listen to Nilsson/Windgassen/Bhm- Bayreuth 1966.",1137024000,11,1637,4.6055363321799305
8062083,4,B0009JVOMA,"The first and most important question is how good is Siegfried? Trevealan has a sweet voice but when it is pushed (and it is pushed a lot) it gets steely. It is also rather colorless. He is a decent actor - which is a lot for a Siegfried. Clark''s Mime is wonderfully acted but shrilly shouted - does this man have any voice left? Struckman is again fairly good as Wotan. Polkaski is again the best voice in the production. The other characters are pretty good.

The production takes place on the same basic set with variations for the cave and Erda. The dragon is a disappointment. It seems to be a bunch of logs from the World Ash. Kupher sticks with his concept that Wotan is still pulling the strings - literally in terms of the woodbird. I don't know how I stand on this idea. He says he has let go. But if he really has why does he fight Siegfried.

The scene with Erda is well done. And the final duet finds both principals in fine form. The orchestra is adequate and de Billy gives a decent account of the score. Nothing more. Better than this company''s Walkure - but not up to other video Siegfrieds.",1135814400,6,1110,4.30622009569378
