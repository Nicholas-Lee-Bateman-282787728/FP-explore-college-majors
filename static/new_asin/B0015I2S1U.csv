Esta pelcula est muy buena. Agarra tu atencin de principio al fin. Aunque s es de bajo presupuesto, tambin es una cinta que se a ganado varios premios y la he visto en Telemundo, TeleXitos, y PBS en ocasiones. Tiene drama, accin, y comedia.",1462665600,,518,4.4526315789473685
8258723,1,B0015I2S1U,"Aunque el titulo y el resumen parecen buenos, la pelicula no tiene un buen desarrollo. Al principio no sabia si estaba viendo una pelicula cristiana. La pelicula no es de muy buena calidad y unicamente el mensaje al final me gusto. La mayor parte de la pelicula fue aburrida, como dije, unicamente el final me llamo la atencion.

Although the title and summary seemed good, the movie doesn't have a good development. At the beginning I didn't even know if it was a Christian movie. The quality of the movie is not good and I only liked the message at the end of the movie. For the most part of the movie we were bored, like I said, I the only thing that caught my attention was towards the end.",1396483200,,694,4.338461538461538

8258725,5,B0015I2S1U,"This movie was FAB! I was so surprised as to how well this movie was shot on a seemingly ""low-budget"". It's reminiscent of El Mariachi in the way it's shot well, has efficient story line, and the acting is superb. It kind of reminds of Robert Rodriguez or Tarantino in that there are subtle jokes and banter within the action. WELL DONE!",1311724800,,337,4.451612903225806
8258726,5,B0015I2S1U,I rented this movie at a Redbox and when it started I hated it because I thought they were actually making fun of christian's and the works of the Lord. But as I continued watching I realized that was not what the movie was about at all. My husband and I ended up enjoying the movie so much we kept it 2 days extra and showed it to my mom and dad whom at first reacted as we did but ended up loving it so much they stated searching for it and never found it. Till I found it on Amazon.com and ordered it for mom to have. She was really happy to get it. We will probably end up getting one for ourselves as well.,1294272000,2,611,3.857142857142857
