8748978,5,B01AZY0DT8,I wasn't sure if I was going to like this dvd series based on other reviews. I am glad I didn't listen to the negative reviews and went ahead with my purchase. I really like the workouts. I am only four days in so I can only review the ones I have done. I do like what I have seen so far. One of the workouts will have your legs on fire by the time you are done. But in a good way. I do recommend this dvd series.,1492214400,,413,3.651685393258427
8748979,2,B01AZY0DT8,"The shipping took three weeks and the shipping status always stated ""Not Yet Shipped"" so I was surprised when it arrived.  Overall the program is ok, however if you are familiar with his Rev Abs program, this program is completely unoriginal.  Had it been advertised as a version of Rev Abs condensed into 20 minutes, I would have known what to expect.  Each workout is 3-5 exercises repeated 3-4 times, and for me personally, I get bored very quickly.  The style of each workout is identical from program 1 to 3 so very little variation.",1487635200,,538,4.631578947368421
