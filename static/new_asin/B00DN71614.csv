Everything was going great until about minute 18 when the mouths and words were not lining up right. There was at least a 3 second lag between the audio and the video. It was so distracting and totally took away from our ability to fully enjoy this film to the fullest. Very very disappointed in AMAZON!

I stumbled upon this documentary, didn't seek it out,  but it just took me up and down watching how Charles struggles have come to fruition.  I think the title is so on target, because we get a glimpse of the many hands that helped bring late-found success to Charles Bradley - his literacy teacher, the small record company, props to Job Corp-- but him remaining true to his loving soul is what  powers his heartfelt songs.",1400889600,,550,4.581632653061225

Would be hollow if Charles didn't have talent, but he does. The way the film was put together told his story in an moving way. A genuine article, taking care of his mother gets an opportunity at an advanced age to have a spotlight shown on his musical abilities. Great movie.",1399334400,,424,4.120481927710843

I had the pleasure of seeing Charles Bradley perform last week, and had I seen ""Soul Of America"" first, I would have had an even greater appreciation of this man, than I already did!

Blues, soul, James Brown, horns, Motown, honesty, all of it.

Charles Bradley has lived a tough, tough live and spent 42 years until he got known.

Playing at small bands covering as James Brown Jr.

And Charles Bradley has a lot of James Brown in him. The honesty, the screaming, the putting it all out there, it's glorious.

He is exactly the kind of music that should be on top of the charts. Popular music does not require Autotune.

Let's bring the soul back to American music. I wish Charles Bradley nothing but the best. And keep some tissues ready for this superb documentary.

If you liked ""Searching for Sugarman"" you would like this.",1381708800,2,677,4.591666666666667

You know, the ones without sampling and drum machines. Real music made by real people, with real stories and real lives. Not perfect lives, but lives that you can relate to or sympathize with.

Charles Bradley is one of those artists.

I see an emotionally stunted man whose perseverance allowed him to fill a void left by one of the greats.  I see young white muscians of mediocre talent exploiting someone whose talent is reminiscent of days gone by.  I see an individual whose only desire is to express himself in love to others, who seems to have no understanding of the financial and legal aspects of his intellectual property.
It is painful and sad to see this 'enslavement' expressed again.
Who gets the songwriting credit (he should, because the white fella isn't a songwriter, he's a transcriber. Pressing record doesn't make you a songwriter.)  Where's the money?  And that real estate is very, very valuable now.  Who has the business sense in the family to know that?
Ah, well, I guess life hasn't changed much in these United States.  Black folks don't know their worth, and white folks exploit that ignorance.",1376352000,,1007,4.786127167630058
