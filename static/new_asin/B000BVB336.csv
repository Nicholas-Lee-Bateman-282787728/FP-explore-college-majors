8092985,1,B000BVB336,"I was hoping this would be an instructional video from which my toddler could learn some basic gymnastics to give her a head start for classes. Instead, the gymnastic section of this DVD shows kids running around outdoors playing on heavy playground equipment. There is no instruction whatsoever; instead there is a music track and a narrator who makes useless observations like: ""Doing gymnastics is really fun! Great gymnastics!""

Besides the gymnastics section there are also sections on cheerleading and dancing. These are similarly useless for learning. The dancing section shows toddlers jumping around (each doing their own thing) and the narrator saying things like, ""She's dancing with her legs!""

The title of this DVD is ""Let's Dance & Tumble!"", so you would assume your child could watch this in the living room in front of the TV and get some basic instruction on dancing and tumbling. This is not the case. If you want your child to sit in front of the TV watching other kids run around in a disorganized manner, then this DVD fits the bill. If you want your child to actually learn something, look elsewhere.",1415318400,,1123,4.905263157894737
8092986,1,B000BVB336,"I bought this for my daughters 3rd birthday. She LOVES to cheer, she has attended the local cheer camp where she learned simple cheers like ""Two bits, Four bits.."" and to jump around a little. I thought this video would be more of the same, little cheers and maybe this is what the splits looks like etc... but it was nothing of the sort! She learned NOTHING from it and doesn't really like the music. The ""Let's dance..."" make it seem like the kid will do some of it, but not any more than she does when a good song comes on the radio. This was very much in lines with the Baby Einsteins type videos.",1268092800,5,601,4.189655172413793
8092987,4,B000BVB336,"I have a 15 month old daughter who enjoys watching videos which show children being active. Music and Action are a must to keep her attention. When I first popped this DVD into the player she watched for a few minutes but then decided her toys and books were more fun. The next time I played it she was sitting in her highchair eating a snack and since she was trapped - she watched. She laughed and clapped as the toddlers jumped, cheered and danced across the screen. She has since become my little cheerleader, and has learned how to use her little blankies as Pom-Poms! It is quite adorable. I will definitely buy another DVD in this set!",1171584000,4,642,4.4033613445378155
