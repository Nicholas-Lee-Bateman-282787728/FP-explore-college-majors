8197303,1,B000QTD0A2,"What a joke! Raw and uncensored? Maybe the language used but definitely not in the visual aspect. Face it, the only people interested in this dvd are looking for softcore of Julie Strain and Julie K Smith and this in NO way delivers. An hour long photoshoot with no nudity. If you buy this dvd, don't pay more than $1.00. This video deserves ZERO stars!! That's my warning to you and I'm sticking to it.",1333152000,12,403,4.386666666666667
8197304,1,B000QTD0A2,"This DVD tries to sell itself over as a behind the scenes look at popular actresses and models,Julie Strain and Julie K.Smith,claiming this thing as some sort of ""uncensored"" reality show or something.
Yeah right.
Nothing steamy,nothing too sexy and certainly not much ""uncensored"" material.
What it is,is a DVD of FORTY FIVE(!)minutes of one endless photo session that never goes ANYWHERE.
No nudity and no further footage of the two title vixens,they don't even wear any other sexy suits,other than ONE in the photo shoot.
Afterwards there is six minutes of Julie Strain in terrible footage from some camcorder epic,where she strips in a kitchen.....nothing too exciting.
This was obviously tagged on to attempt to deliver SOMETHING,but fails miserably.
Than there is like ten minutes of some not highly attractive blonde chick as  a vampire(?!) that is neither Julie Strain or Julie K. Smith.
Okay,rule number one,if you want to present a sexy vampire,at least keep her an exotic,a brunette,that's one of there main attractive features,that mysterious nature.....dumb american blondes do not a sexy vampire make.
And on that note,let's just close this review and forget this abomination ever existed.",1222214400,30,1203,5.298429319371728
