7927297,1,B00004YKQL,"This is a terrible movie. I thought it would be a nice movie for kids and was very upset when I watched it and the nativity characters called each other stupid and screamed at each other. Ours is in a box in the basement because I can't in good conscience sell it at a garage sale and have some other poor family watch it. Really, really terrible movie.",1197331200,5,353,4.205882352941177
7927298,1,B00004YKQL,"This movie is terrible, worse than terrible. I thought I was buying a nice, true meaning of Christmas story to watch with my children. I was disgusted when we watched it the first time and found that the characters call each other stupid and tell each other to ""shut up."" My husband and I threw it away because we could not sell it to anyone else in good conscience. We purchased ""The Very First Noel"" too and it is wonderful. One of the best movies we have ever seen!!",1195257600,,469,4.280898876404494
7927299,4,B00004YKQL,"I bought this for my 3 and 1 year old children.  It uses words like stupid, ugly, and dumb (the donkey has a bad attitude in the beginning and after helping Mary, Joseph and Jesus he becomes a good donkey).  Now it may be naive of me in today's society, but I do not want my children learning these words from a Christian video about the birth of Christ!  If your kids are older and/or already know these words then it is a very cute story (although it could do a better job of reinforcing that name calling can be very hurtful).",1137456000,32,529,4.166666666666667
7927300,5,B00004YKQL,This movie is a sweet depiction of the Birth of Jesus. It is well written and produced.,1104451200,10,87,4.176470588235294
