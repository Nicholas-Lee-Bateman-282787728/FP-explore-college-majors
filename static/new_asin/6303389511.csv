First there's the HU the one boy sings to the trees, then a soul travel experience both boys share in flying like birds, and finally a goodbye in soul body by one of the boys to his best friend.",1371600000,,292,4.140350877192983
7846529,5,6303389511,"""Digger"" is one of those movies that somehow miraculously gets made against all the odds. It is haunting, intelligent, beautifully filmed, slow-paced, and spiritual. Most contemporary audience members are likely to go to sleep while trying to view this film, if they even know that it exists. The other 5% of its audience are in for a deep experience that soaks in slowly.
It is the story of a pair of best friends, and the wisdom that the older boy shares with the younger, which changes him forever. Joshua Jackson delivers one of the finest performances by a young actor in the 90s. He plays ""Billy"" as if he were the reincarnation of an ancient Native American shaman (complete with an owl familiar). It is a tour de force, of the same calibre as Osment's work in ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""A.I.""
This film is for fans of Katherine Paterson's novels, ""The Cure"" (1995, directed by Peter Horton), and quiet, muted masterpieces that reveal themselves over time. Bonus points for the beautiful scenery of the island (Brentwood Bay, B.C.), a fine score featuring the lovely instrumental talents of Darol Anger and Bill Douglas, and the presence of the magnificent Olympia Dukakis.",998092800,3,1176,4.855721393034826
