8141492,4,B000HT3QC8,"I liked it for the unique feature that it focuses on only the last several days of his life where all the options he thought he would rely on fail him one after the other right down to the Nazis who give him up. What I did not like was,  the spoken audio was in Italian and I had to read English subtitles for the whole movie, but even there that gave the movie a show of authenticity.",1412640000,,385,3.9358974358974357

8141494,3,B000HT3QC8,"Despite the Italian producer's well produced and very factually presented film, he deserves chastisement for its disappointing ending.

The climax to Mussolini and his mistress' demise was the local Italians hanging their corpses by the ankles in the village square so they could be reviled and spat on for the misery Mussolini caused an Italian nation that never wanted war, including the many murdered on his orders.

This is shown in all documentaries and should have been included in the film. I am very disappointed and shall give the film away to anyone.

8141495,4,B000HT3QC8,Rod Steiger gives a real performance.  Production quite old but overall faithful to historical facts.  Highly recommended for those interested in Italy's demise but also entertaining for anybody who wants to spend a good time watching good acting.  Makes Mussolini a more humane and tormented being who is unable to scape what he is convinced is his destiny.,1257292800,3,358,5.137931034482759
