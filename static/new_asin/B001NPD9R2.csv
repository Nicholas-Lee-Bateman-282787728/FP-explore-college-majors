3720543,4,B001NPD9R2,"""The Pink Panther 2"" may lack the intelligence and sophistication of the original Blake Edwards/Peter Sellers comedies, and even the zest and heart of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Pink-Panther-Special-Edition/dp/B000FBH3V8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Pink Panther (Special Edition)</a>.  But like the Pink Panther diamond itself, ""The Pink Panther 2"" is still a gem, in spite of its flaws.

One flaw is the title.  I was disappointed when the previous film's working title was shortened from ""The Birth of the Pink Panther,"" and before the curtain went down on that one I had a sneaking suspicion they'd name the sequel ""Pink Panther 2.""  It's okay that they ignore the fact that this is the eleventh movie, not the second, because this is one of those Hollywood ""reboots.""  But it's just lazy, especially when there are plenty of ""The BLANK of the Pink Panther"" and ""The Pink Panther does BLANK"" titles left to choose from.  That said, the movie is nowhere near as lame as its title.

When the movie opens, Inspector Clouseau has been put on parking ticket duty by his jealous superior Chief Inspector Dreyfus (John Cleese) right after winning the Medal of Honor.  Cleese, like Herbert Lom (the original Dreyfus) and unlike Kevin Kline in the previous film, uses his natural British accent rather than attempting a French one.  Unfortunately Cleese, unlike Herbert Lom but like Kevin Kline before him, doesn't attempt an eye twitch, either.  When priceless artifacts are stolen by a cat burglar known as ""The Tornado"" (like ""The Phantom"" in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Pink-Panther/dp/B0009S4J3C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Pink Panther</a>, but without David Niven's panache), a ""dream team"" is assembled out of detectives representing the countries in which the crimes took place.  And when the Pink Panther diamond (last seen as a rock on Beyonce's finger, now a honking gem on public display in a Paris museum) is stolen, Clouseau joins oily Italian playboy sleuth Andy Garcia (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ocean-s-Trilogy-Ocean-s-Eleven-Ocean-s-Twelve-Ocean-s-Thirteen/dp/B000W9DTG6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ocean's Trilogy (Ocean's Eleven / Ocean's Twelve / Ocean's Thirteen)</a>), London master of deduction Alfred Molina (Doc Ock in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spider-Man-2-1/dp/B000MTFDBA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spider-Man 2.1</a>), Japanese computer expert Yuki Matsuzaki, and the author who is writing the book on the Tornado (Aishwarya Rai Bachchan) in interrogating prime suspect Jeremy Irons.

Garcia, Molina, Rai, Matsuzaki and Irons are all magnificient actors, but none of them are comedians per se.  Garcia and Molina both get their share of zingers, and Aishwarya Rai looks lovely, but a Pink Panther movie needs actors who can blend into the background, not steal the spotlight from Clouseau.  Steve Martin continues to fill the role of Clouseau fantastically.  In my opinion, he is the only actor other than Sellers to truly make the character his own.  He fares better with a director other than Harold Zwart, though.  In this film, he lacks the pathos established in the last film.  He's less child-like and more childish.

Also, director Harold Zwart and screenwriters Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber seem to be trying too hard to capture the sharp-edged, adult humor of the old Blake Edwards comedies.  Sometimes it works, but sometimes it's at odds with the kid-friendly, broad slapstick also presented.  The character of Cato is still missing, but they've found ways to incorporate all of the elements of the character without him.  The all-out karate ambush sequence is successfully revived in a surprising way I won't spoil here.  And Yuki Matsuzaki's character becomes the butt of Clouseau's old ""little yellow friend"" line, leading to a scene in which Lilly Tomlin, playing a political correctness instructor, tells Clouseau why he can't get away with saying this.  Unfortunately, the political correctness coaching scenes go too far.  Yes, it's good to see Martin reunited with his old co-star Lilly Tomlin.  Yes, in today's age Clouseau would be considered a racist, sexist, small-minded twit.  But how long do we have to dwell on that fact?

But while the jokes all work on different levels, the important thing is that they do work.
While I preferred the tone and pace of the previous film, ""The Pink Panther 2"" does deliver big belly laughs.  John Cleese doesn't have the same chemistry with Steve Martin that Kevin Kline did, but he's a much better choice for the role.  He does that stiff upper-lipped deadpan British humor thing he's so good at, and it suits the role incredibly well.  His few brief moments on screen are some of the movie's most hilarious.  Cleese, Martin, Garcia, and Molina all have some razor-sharp one-liners, too, most of which are saved for the incredibly funny climax.

As in all of the Pink Panther films, the opening credit animation is a highlight.  It's funny, stylish, and sophisticated: everything you'd expect from a Pink Panther cartoon.  For fans, the credits alone will be worth the price of admission.  Jean Reno, Emily Mortimer, and Steve Martin continue to have great chemistry together.  Phillip Goodwin returns in the almost unnoticeable role of Dreyfus' confidant.  In the same way the worst James Bond movies provides more thrills than most other action flicks, a weak Pink Panther movie still provides more belly laughs than most other comedies.  And there are plenty of laughs to be had in ""The Pink Panther 2.""",1235001600,4,5702,5.609101516919487
3720544,3,B001NPD9R2,"At the premiere of the new ""Pink Panther 2"", Steve Martin said that three other actors had already portrayed French Inspector Jacques Clouseau. He was wrong. It was four. In ""Pink Panther 2"" Martin returns as Clouseau, warning criminals with his noisy bumbles and loud fumbles. Make no mistake! Clouseau is on the trail. This time, someone is carting off the world's priceless relics. The Mona Lisa. The Magna Carta. Nothing is safe. And what about France's most famous treasure? What about the Pink Panther? ""Pink Panther 2"" confirms the wild, zany antics of the ""re-born"" Inspector Clouseau. Comedian, actor, playwright Martin is perfect as the inept, self-righteous traffic cop. Martin bristles with middle-age energy that would embarass a teenager. Of course, a small army of Martin stand-ins and stunt doubles are sorely taxed. A very funny sequence involves Clouseau investigating the theft of the Pope's ring. Inside the Pope's chamber, Clouseau adorns the Pope's cloak and scitar. He strolls to the window and waves at the crowds below. The crowd waves back and cheers the apparent ""Pope"". Naturally, Clouseau manages to slip and fall over the railing into the masses below. Another scene has Clouseau romancing his secretary-sweetheart in Rome at a restaurant called ""La Plata de Nada"". Clouseau manages to burn the restaurant to the ground. Twice. Slapstick just once removed from Mack Sennett moves the plot(such as it is) along at a whirlwind pace. Director Harald Zwart ably whips the story along. An excellent cast includes Jean Reno(again), Andy Garcia, Alfred Molina, Jeremy Irons, John Cleese, Lily Tomlin, and a very lovely Aishwarya Rai. This is the 11th big-screen saga for Inspector Jacques Clouseau, which started in 1963 with Peter Sellers. Steve Martin is no Peter Sellers. But this is a funny movie. Go ahead and pay $7.00 for a ticket and $12.50 for popcorn and a coke. It's worth it just to see esteemed English actor Alfred Molina in a tutu.",1234569600,4,1969,5.061538461538461
3720545,3,B001NPD9R2,"I may have smirked once or twice during ""The Pink Panther 2,"" which is good a sign since I didn't even get that far with the first film. But no, it's not a good sign, simply because this sequel to the 2006 remake still isn't trying very hard; as the bumbling Inspector Jacques Clouseau, star/co-writer Steve Martin tries to parody a character that Peter Sellers already made into a parody, which gets really annoying after a while. There's no doubt that the man is funny, but as Clouseau, he can only pull off acting silly, which is not the same thing. While slightly better than its predecessor, ""The Pink Panther 2"" is still nothing more than a series of shallow gags, most of them physically inclined. It's occasionally amusing at best, tiresome at worst. It doesn't help that the story is unflatteringly predictable, probably because far too many details are given away early on. The only thing I was not expecting was the sight of Alfred Molina wearing a pink tutu. Believe me, I could have lived without that.

The plot: When a number of priceless historical artifacts are stolen from museums around the world--and this includes the Pink Panther diamond--an international dream team of detectives is assembled. Representing France is our intrepid Clouseau, much to the chagrin of his superior, the flustered Chief Inspector Dreyfus (John Cleese). The other members of the team: from England, Pepperidge (Molina), who's determined to out-deduce Clouseau at every step; from Italy, Vicenzo (Andy Garcia), who always speaks as if he's admiring a fine work of art; from Japan, Kenji (Yuki Matsuzaki), who always has a laptop in front of him; and from India, Sonia (Aishwarya Rai Bachchan), who can't seem to enter a room without looking like she's striking a pose. Their mission is to find a globe trotting thief known only as The Tornado, who I guess is supposed to be the new version of The Phantom. His calling card is not a monogrammed white glove, but an actual card.

It's a simple enough plot, and it could have worked had it not been so insistent with its comedy. Virtually every scene is a prolonged slapstick routine, with Clouseau getting himself into one mess after another. Within the course of the film, he burns down a Spanish restaurant, destroys a chimney by falling down it, hurts Dreyfus by accidentally provoking a ruthless security task force, and sits on the Pope's hat. I occasionally chuckled, but I never really laughed, which only goes to show that even physical humor can get old. Attempts are made at verbal humor, which brings me to Mrs. Berenger (Lily Tomlin), an American who acts as a kind of sensitivity counselor. Clouseau, it seems, is unable to filter what he says, resulting in a slew of off-color remarks and racial slurs. One slip of the tongue, and she's on Clouseau's case quicker than you can say Jacques Robinson.

The broad comedy is occasionally tamed by a subplot that explores a blooming romance between Clouseau and his co-worker, Nicole (Emily Mortimer), one that's threatened now that Vicenzo has entered the picture. I could sense that the filmmakers were aiming for something more meaningful here, which is admirable. But really, does anyone care about Clouseau's love life? Is it even possible to care? I found it very difficult to do so, mostly because, as characterized in this updated franchise, Clouseau just isn't relatable. He's nothing more than a goofball, a jester, a person we're supposed to laugh at, not laugh with. There's no way to invest in such a character, so I can't understand why the filmmakers were actually trying to give him depth. Complexity can be stimulating, but when you're talking about characters like Jacques Clouseau, what you see should be what you get.

The strange thing is that, in spite of its countless shortcomings, this movie is still better than what preceded it. ""The Pink Panther"" was a mindless farce that went absolutely nowhere, as exemplified by the scene in which Clouseau and a dialect coach squabble over the phrase, ""I would like to buy a hamburger."" With this new film, I saw how it was trying to aim higher. For one thing, I appreciated the casting of John Cleese; while no one can recapture the sheer desperation and insanity displayed by Herbert Lom, Cleese at least gives Dreyfus a much-needed frantic edge to his personality. That was noticeably missing from the previous film, in which Dreyfus was portrayed by Kevin Kline. I also appreciated Jean Reno, who returns as Clouseau's right hand man, Ponton; of all the characters in this film, he's the only one who doesn't have to try to be funny.

One of the oddest casting choices is Jeremy Irons, who plays his character with the same conviction as an actor trying to have fun as the villain. This wouldn't be a problem if his appearance were more than a mere cameo. Did he expect his role to be bigger than it ended up being? Who can say? All I know is that he gives the best performance he can given the material, which in this case is a sign of overconfidence. As for the rest of the cast, they're no better and no worse than I expected them to be. ""The Pink Panther 2"" is by no means a good movie, but it would be cruel to say that I hated it or even that I disliked it. It would be much more accurate to say that I thought it awfully misguided. Anyone can get a laugh doing and saying silly things, but sadly, that kind of laughter comes cheap.",1234483200,3,5412,4.716701902748414
3720546,4,B001NPD9R2,"Better sight gags, more inspired comic sequences, and an actually clever mystery plot make ""The Pink Panther 2"" a more confident and more enjoyable film than its predecessor, which itself was perfectly watchable.

Yes, I guess it's pretty clear that I'm one of those in the minority who don't think it's sacrilege that Steve Martin is trying to follow in the footsteps of the great Peter Sellers.  Two things should be remembered on this score:  Peter Sellers was extremely talented, no doubt, but his Inspector Clouseau was, well... a bumbling detective character.  In other words, it's not the kind of subtle, nuanced character that another talented comic actor can't legitimately take a crack at.  Secondly, people forget that critics weren't head over heels in love with the original Sellers Clouseau movies, either, especially his last two or three.  Moviegoers tended to like them, but critics mostly dismissed them in favor of Seller's more serious comic works, like ""Dr. Strangelove"", ""Being There"", etc.  So let's all get a grip now.

Myself, I enjoy Martin's take on the character.  Seller's Clouseau was a complete boob who only solved crimes and attained fame completely accidentally, which was admittedly interesting.  Martin's take is also interesting, though: his Clouseau is a complete boob at most things, but also has some legitimate detective skills.  Those two divergent aspects of the same character makes Martin's Clouseau fun to watch.

So, is the film a comic masterpiece?  Nah.  But ""The Pink Panther 2"" is a lot of fun, and definitely worth a trip to the theater.",1234396800,41,1589,5.108527131782946
3720547,3,B001NPD9R2,"I avoided the first one for as long as I could. I couldn't believe it would be anything but horrible. However, when I finally watched it I laughed almost the entire time, many times to the point of tears! I WOULD LIKE TO BUY A HAMBURGER has to be one of the funniest scenes ever!

Anyways, I was pretty excited to see a sequel for this. How was it? Just ok. I'm glad they didn't just repeat the same old jokes over from the first one, although they just touch on them briefly to remind you of a good laugh, and then they move on. I really wanted to love this movie, but I just don't think it was as funny as the first one. Definitely worth renting, but I can't recommend anybody see it in the theater.

And for the record, people need to STOP comparing this to the old peter sellers movies. First off people, THEY JUST AREN'T FUNNY! Oh boy did I remember them as funny though. But I caught a couple reruns of the older ones recently and they were so NOT funny. In fact, they were completely unwatchable. At the time I remember thinking they were hilarious. But they're not. So, I know you remember the old ones as super funny, and peter sellers as some sort of comedic genius (and he may have been at the time), but go watch those old movies, and you'll wonder ""how on earth did I ever think this was funny!""",1234137600,,1308,4.186507936507937
3720548,4,B001NPD9R2,"Steve Martin is back for a second shot as Inspector Clousseau in this sequel. The movie is about a series of high profile international robberies and the ""Dream Team"" of sleuths investigating the crimes, including Clousseau. Some people might get bogged down in ""Is Martin as Good as Peter Sellers, are the new films the equals of the 60s and 70s classics"", etc. A better question would be is this a good film and a funny film in its own right and on its own merits?
Taken on it's own merits, this is a funny movie with good slapstick and verbal humor. Like the Sellers films, the entire cast is very good with Cleese, Garcia, Mortimer and Reno all shining. It may not be as funny or as original as the best Sellers movies but it does what a comedy is supposed to do- make you laugh. That doesn't go out of style.",1234051200,4,813,4.3202614379084965
3720549,2,B001NPD9R2,"It's unfortunate that you won't know until the end of the film that the best part of Pink Panther 2 is its opening credit cartoon.  The impressive cast and grand locales almost manage to overcome Steve Martin's utterly horrendous impression of Peter Seller's infamously bumbling Inspector Clouseau, but the trite gags and immature pranks tire quickly.  A few laughs do find their way into the antics, though perhaps more in pity than true amusement, leaving part two on par with its deplorable predecessor.

When notorious national treasure thief The Tornado returns from years of inactivity, a group of the world's finest detectives are assembled to investigate.  Due to the fame garnered from his past (mis)adventures in recovering the priceless Pink Panther Diamond, Inspector Clouseau (Steve Martin) is asked to lead the team of specialists, including Vicenzo (Andy Garcia), Pepperidge (Alfred Molina), Kenji (Yuki Matsuzaki), and Tornado expert Sonia (Aishwarya Rai Bachchan).  With his unorthodox and clumsy method of sleuthing, it's not long before Clouseau has publicly embarrassed the team of detectives and must now simultaneously regain his image and solve the mystery, as well as attempting to foil the advances of Vicenzo on this longtime sweetheart Nicole (Emily Mortimer).

Obviously the best thing to come of Steve Martin's ludicrous sequel to a pathetic remake is the desire to watch the original Blake Edwards' Pink Panther movies, of which there are plenty. In Martin's defense, there is something momentarily amusing about adults bumbling around like children, cavorting about in absurd dance sequences, and muttering in terribly stereotypical accents - but it doesn't last long. Several scenes are so ridiculous they're funny, but the majority of the film is so obnoxiously immature that it's just plain stupid. The few genuine laughs are quickly covered up by exasperating slapstick and pointless characters.

The unpronounceable ""hamburger"" gag, overly destructive karate, and strained semi-French lingo are all reused - it's clear that what worked for the first film (commercially, not critically) has returned, leaving no room for fresh creativity. Clouseau is still a small-minded nitwit, eye-candy supporting ladies are ever-present, and the Chief of Police still unbelievably allows the scatterbrained inspector to solve crimes while carelessly destroying evidence and embarrassing the nation. Although you'll lose brain cells watching Steve Martin reprise his mind-numbing role, at least the opening title sequence animation and jazzy music remain as accompaniment.

I made it through 10 minutes, now I need to go watch some real Pink Panther movie to replace the yuck in my brain with some of that original, charming humor that quickly leads to insane, yet somehow believable antics that have tears of laughter streaming down your face. I laughed once during the intro and then it just got stupid fast. If you liked Peter Sellers, you probably will hate Steve Martin's Clouseau here. As stupid as Seller's Clouseau is, we're always pulling for him, he is engaging and strangely convincing. (ps. I've been a fan of Steve Martin's for 40 years, but it takes some hubris to take on this classic with so very little effort invested. If you want a good Martin, movie, watch ""The Spanish Prisoner"" - not comedy, but very well done and entertaining.)",1421971200,2,842,4.582781456953643

3721285,4,B001NPD9R2,"Steve Martin returns as the famous and very clumsy police officer, Inspector Jacques Clouseau.

With the success of the first film, ""THE PINK PANTHER 2"" makes its return with Steve Martin, John Cleese as Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus (replacing Kevin Kline), Emily Mortimer as Nicole Durant (Clouseau's girlfriend) and Jean Reno as Gendarme Gilbert Ponton (Clouseau's partner).

The film is directed by Harald Zwart (""One Night at McCool's"" and ""Agent Cody Banks"") and a screenplay by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Webber.  Joining Zwart is cinematographer Denis Crossan (""Agent Cody Banks"", ""Incognito"" and ""The Hole"") and composer Christophe Beck (""The Pink Panther"", ""Drillbit Taylor"" and ""We Are Marshall"").

The film revolves around many thefts around the world.  Expensive artifacts such as the Magna Carta in London, the Imperial Sword in Japan, the Turin Shroud in India and the famous Pink Panther diamond of France.  All thefts done by the master thief known as ""The Tornado"".

Because of the heist done in several countries, each country has their top detectives working together to find the Tornado and break the case.  The team known as ""The Dream Team"" which consists of Inspector Randall Pepperidge (Alfred Molina) from the UK, Italy has Inspector Vicenzo Brancaleone (Andy Garcia), Japan has their technology expert has Kenji Mazuto (Yuki Matsuzaki) and India has their criminology expert Sonia Solandres (Aishwarya Rai).

As for France, Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus feels that its his time to get in the limelight instead of the clumsy Inspector Clouseau but learns from his superiors that they want Clouseau to his dismay.

As for Clouseau, he's busy catching people breaking the law and also trying to advance in his relationship with his girlfriend Nicole and also having his home used as a temporary place for his partner Ponton (who is kicked out of the home by his wife) and his children and dog to stay for a short while.

But after receiving his orders from his superiors to represent France in catching the criminals, he agrees.  Unfortunately for Clouseau, his counterparts from the different countries do not think he is capable of solving the case and to make matters worse, because his relationship with Nicole is secret and she is helping with the case, Inspector Clouseau must pretend he has nothing to do with her.  And thus the suave Inspector Brancaleone starts to flirt and tries to become closer with her.

As the ""Dream Team"" tries to find out who has been stealing the items and the world has their eyes on if the Dream Team can succeed, because of unfortunate situations involving Closeau, the Pope has his ring stolen by the Tornado and the public turns on the Dream Team.  The group has no decision but to kick Inspector Clouseau out of their group.

While the Dream Team pursues other leads which they believe will lead them to the thief, Clouseau has his own ideas of capturing the thief.

Will Closeau prove himself as capable investigator or will he be seen as an inept investigator who loses his girlfriend?

""THE PINK PANTHER 2' comes with a total of three discs.  The first disc contains the film and its special features.  The second disc contains 27 classic Pink Panther cartoons and the third disc contains the digital copy.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""THE PINK PANTHER 2' is featured in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1) with an AVC at 34.75 MBPS.  The picture quality is actually very vibrant and looks magnificent.  The amount of detail and contrast really is quite impressive.  Characters skin and flesh tones, eyes (especially Aishiwarya Rai's blue eyes), detail of the clothing and the objects you name it, the detail is there.  If anything, the picture quality is outstanding.

As for audio quality, audio is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (also, in Spanish, French and Portuguese 5.1 Dolby Digital).  For the most part, the film is front and center channel heavy but I did notice quite a bit of surround usage for a variety of scenes that includes crowds and action scenes such as the squeak of the chandelier when Closeau is hanging on top of it.  Not much LFE is used in the film but overall, the lossless soundtrack is quite solid for a film like this.  Dialog can be heard clearly as with the music of Christophe Beck.

As for subtitles, the film features subtitles in English, Spanish, Portuguese, Cantonese, Mandarin and Korean.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

Several reasons why I enjoyed the first film was that Steve Martin was able to bring his unique style to the character of Inspector Clouseau.  The film was shot in various locations in Europe and really giving the film this European, stylish type of feel to it.

The interaction between Clouseau and Ponton and also Nicole was quite humorous and everything just seemed to work quite well in the film.

With ""THE PINK PANTHER 2', the film continues with Clouseau's clumsy hijinks but what I found missing is that all-European style of feel with its gorgeous locations.  Steve Martin was able to utilize those locations (such as trying to park a car or drive through the city) quite effectively.  The sexual innuendo between Clouseau and Nicole was definitely much less this time around, as the film focused more on their relationship and I felt that the mystique of their closeness was better utilized in the first film.

Also, Ponton's role seemed to be quite domesticated and his character seemed less tough guy and more family man this time around.  Jean Reno can play a variety of roles but I wish his role was more of the aggressive partner than the man who just got kicked out of the house along with his kids and dog.

I did enjoy John Cleese as Chief Inspector Dreyfus.  Kevin Cline did a good job last year but interesting enough, I felt that John Cleese would have been perfect for the role and sure enough, he is now Dreyfus.  Whereas the first film utilized the character of Dreyfus quite well, there was less of his character in the second film and that crazy banter between Dreyfus and Clouseau took place mostly at the beginning.

I did find it quite interesting to see two actors such as Andy Garcia (""Confidence"", ""Smokin' Aces"", ""Ocean's Eleven"" and ""The Godfather: Part III"")  and Alfred Molina (""Spider-Man 2' and ""The DaVinci Code"") known for their serious roles, partake in a comedy film.  It was nice to see these two men let loose and become casual and cool and I found their scenes quite fun to watch.  I also enjoyed seeing Lily Tomlyn and Steve Martin together in a film (their first in 20 years), as these two really compliment each other well with their comedic back-and-forth routine.  And as for Aishwarya Rai, it was so great to see this popular and beautiful Bollywood actress in this film and I hope this film leads to more roles for blockbuster films in the US.

I was entertained by ""THE PINK PANTHER 2' but aside from seeing the various talent that took part in this film, I miss the storyline and the utilization of Inspector Clouseau throughout Europe.  Part of the enjoyment was seeing him utilized in the city and of course, the character development featured in the first film.  But those characters that I enjoyed from the first film was utilized quite differently this time around.  Not much more of Steve Martin's Clouseau character but mainly the utilization of John Cleese, Jean Reno and Emily Mortimer's characters.

Don't get me wrong, the film is entertaining and fun but storywise, it was average at best.  If anything, part of the marketing genius for the release of the second film on Blu-ray was the addition of 27 animated episodes on a separate disc.  For fans of the original ""Pink Panther"" animation, its inclusion on this Blu-ray release is awesome.  It's one thing to get 2 or 3 animated shorts but to get 27, that's purchasing another release since that disc alone contains nearly 3-hours.

Personally, ""THE PINK PANTHER 2' was not as impressive as its predecessor but Steve Martin still shines in his own way as Inspector Jacques Clouseau and the hijinks and craziness he brings to the character is still a primary focus on the second film.  The film is still entertaining and fun but I miss the European scenes showcasing Closeau and the type of interaction he had with Dreyfus, Ponton and Nicole from the first film.

As for the Blu-ray release, you really can't go wrong because Twentieth Century Fox really went all out with this release in terms of picture and audio quality, especially with what this release comes bundled with.  It's a pretty awesome release.

If you enjoyed the first film and enjoy Steve Martin's Inspector Clouseau, then definitely pick up ""The Pink Panther 2"" on Blu-ray!

Three stars for the film and an extra star for the inclusion of the 27 original Pink Panther classic cartoons!",1246060800,4,10436,4.732300884955753

Steve Martin reprises his role as Inspector Clouseau, the ne'er-do-well Inspector of the French police.  As in the first film, the antics of Inspector Clouseau provide the comedic relief and carry the film from start to finish.

The cast did a respectable job bringing the story to life and the casting was perfect for the many characters of the ""International dream team"" in pursuit of the thief ""The Tornado.""

The slapstick comedy is what really worked in this film.  What didn't work as well was the theme of political correctness seen throughout.  After a while it became obvious and less funny.

This is a film that will probably appeal more to children than adult audiences.  Nevertheless, if you want to get lost in a film, The Pink Panther 2 might just do the trick.",1235779200,9,884,4.73202614379085
3721287,3,B001NPD9R2,"Dropped by my local theater and watched Pink Panther 2, the sequel to the 2006 Pink Panther.  I think it's a mistake to compare Peter Sellers' outing with Martin's, but it is hard not to.  The crack line ""my little yellow friend"", though under different circumstances is still funny.  Steve as the ""pope"" as he falls from the balcony as nuns faint deserves a chuckle.  Predictable, silly plot is really just a device to watch the slapstick vinettes.  The movie gets wilder and sillier as the 1.5 hours progresses.

The Dream Team is hunting for the Tornado -- who is he, where is he hiding, and how did he steal the most valuable treasures in the world?  Hard to say.  Even at the end we are not quite satisfied.

The old Henry Mancini theme makes us wax nostalgic for Sellers' version of Clouseau.  John Cleese Monte Python alumnus is a bit overdramatic in his role and former Laugh-In gal Lily Tomlin is quite subdued.

The wild and crazy cast includes Jean Reno, Andy Garcia, Alfred Molina, Jeremy Irons, John Cleese, Lily Tomlin, and a very foxy Aishwarya Rai.

During the credits, I heard a young boy tell his parents that this was the best movie he's ever seen.  Yes, I'm sure it was in his young life.  Definitely young children [8-14] will love the karate kids and other antics.

Three stars for the occasional smirk and Pink Panther theme -- still, better than the first Martin film.

Your eleven year old will find it enjoyably unsophisticated, but fans of the Peter Sellers classics should seek entertainment elsewhere.
