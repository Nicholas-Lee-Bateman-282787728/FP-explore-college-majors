2999546,4,B000XA5K4I,"Add this movie to your list of guilty pleasures. On the ""pleasures"" side, I laughed my way through just about all of this movie. A few moments had me cheering, like the obnoxious driver in an over-priced car getting run off the road. Lots of scenes, too many to remember, had me laughing, at least at a dark kind of humor. And, in the end, daddy (sort of), mommy (sort of), and baby (real) settle down to some family values, or try to.

On the ""guilty"" side of the equation, we have the man-a-minute body count, violence of graphic sorts, expendable women enslaved to baby making, and the yuk-factor around a prostitute (with required heart of gold) whose clientele pay extra for genuine mommy-milk in the original container. If you want your dignity or sensitivity to be respected, you'll never admit you saw it.

The title sets your expectations: it tongue-in-cheekily names itself for the whole genre of movies that revel in gunplay, and it delivers. If you can take the gore level, it's a fair comedy. It really isn't for everyone, though.

""Shoot `Em Up"" is like watching a live action graphic novel. A fun movie, it is very violent and filled with some memorable lines. Nice turns by Clive Owen and Paul Giamatti almost make the completely excruciating performance by Monica Bellucci forgivable. The film doesn't have the visual style of other graphic novel adaptations, but it is fun nonetheless.

A tall, unshaven man wearing a black leather overcoat (Clive Owen) sits on a bus bench eating a carrot. He watches a pregnant woman run by, clutching her stomach. Then, a car filled with gun toting men barrels around the corner. ""Mr. Smith"" realizes the woman is in trouble and hurries to her aid. He rushes the woman into an abandoned warehouse and tries to comfort the new mother as she gives birth. Complicating matters are the numerous men with guns who don't care about the impending birth and want to kill the woman. Mr. Smith has to aid the new mother as he tries to protect her. Hertz (Paul Giamatti), the leader of the bad guys, is a little puzzled; he doesn't know who Smith is, or why he gets involved. The woman dies shortly after giving birth and Smith realizes he now has to care for the baby. But Hertz and his men are in pursuit, so Smith looks for help. He turns to a hooker named Donna (Monica Bellucci) who has recently given birth. Smith has to protect the baby and Donna and figure out why Hertz is so intent on getting the child.

I mentioned earlier that watching ""Shoot"" is like watching a live-action graphic novel. This is a growing trend, basing films on graphic novels, allowing filmmakers to delve into unusual, strange stories, stories that would never see the light of day in a more conventional filmmaker's universe. This growing subgenre of film has brought us a number of highly visual, very interesting films. Films like ""Sin City"" and ""300"" shot the characters against green screen, adding backgrounds later, giving the films an even greater graphic novel style. And these films are pretty magnificent. Graphic novels have also greatly influenced other films. ""Batman Begins"" was based on the work of Frank Miller, who also created ""Sin City"" and ""300"", giving the superhero a darker edge and making him more interesting. ""Shoot `Em Up"" has some of these similar elements, but the environment is not nearly as interesting. The film is set in a run down metropolis, a common setting for this type of story, but it looks like a set someone went through and added some elements to, to amp up the `weird' factor. The visual style is no where near as interesting or complete as ""Sin City"".

Interestingly, Clive Owen appears in both playing a similar character. In ""Shoot `Em Up"", `Smith"" is not as well defined as Dwight, his character in ""Sin City"", or as interesting, but he is fun to watch. Taking on elements of Clint Eastwood's famous cowboy persona, The Man with No Name, Owen's character simply becomes known as ""Smith"". Throughout, we learn little bits about him and Kurtz even gives us a few facts he either learned or gleamed from his dealings with the reluctant hero.

From the first moment we see him, sitting on a bus stop bench, at night, in the middle of a run down metropolis; we know Smith is probably not going to win any citizenship awards. I instantly got the feeling he was living off the grid, supported by a visit to his home later in the film. Smith lives in an abandoned warehouse complete with his own indoor garden, filled with carrots ripe for the plucking, and eating. ""Good for the eyesight"" he states, when Donna looks at him strangely.

Smith is also a reluctant hero. He watches the pregnant woman run down the street and then the car full of gun toting men. He sighs, gets up and gets involved. After she dies, he initially wants to leave the baby, but decides he can't. This reluctance adds some interest to his character. As he becomes further entwined in the story, his curiosity takes over. As Kurtz becomes more persistent, this serves to make Smith more hell bent on revenge. These moments help to make Smith a more interesting character; even though he inhabits a cartoon universe, he seems to have some real feelings and emotions.

It is interesting to watch Paul Giamatti play a villain. It is a nice change for this actor who gained a lot of critical praise for his work in ""Sideways"". Kurtz is not your normal villain; he is evil and hell bent on achieving his goal, but he also appears to be a more typical man. Yes, he has a gun in his hand, but without this deadly weapon, he could just as easily be mistaken for a librarian, creating one of the more interesting villains to come along in some time.

Kurtz also has some moments of levity; his wife constantly calls on his cell phone, apparently unaware of her husband's true occupation. At moments, he wonders out loud how Smith could be giving them so much trouble. These elements help to make Giamatti's Kurtz seem vulnerable, less scary, yet when he speaks, gritting his teeth, we understand how deadly he can be. This is a villain who is equally at home spraying bullets across a room as he is trying to problem solving, and figuring things out.

When the film was over, my companion commented that if you took all of the dialogue in the film it would probably only fill ten pages. She is completely true. Unfortunately Monica Bellucci still has a considerable amount of dialogue in the film. Bellucci has an extremely heavy accent, making most of what she says difficult to understand. That, and the fact that she isn't a good actress, makes it difficult to watch her on any level. Sure, she's very pretty, but there are many very pretty actresses in Hollywood who can at least act a little and would have done a better job in this role. Throughout the film, she frequently says ""Smith"" and even this simple line seems to perplex her.

""Shoot `Em Up"" certainly delivers on the action. From the initial confrontation in the abandoned warehouse, where Smith quickly secures a gun, he is never without a pistol for long. And when he doesn't have a sidearm, he finds other items to help him ward off the villains. Smith gets into many tough scrapes and finds some ingenious ways to get out of the situation. With each confrontation,  the stakes are raised along with the danger; and the elaborate stunts Smith pulls to get out of these scrapes escalates until you think it can't possibly go any further. But it does. You keep expecting the next confrontation to be a little more normal, but they just keep getting more outlandish. Watching the action in ""Shoot `Em Up"" is a little like riding a roller coaster, with bullets flying overhead.

But I can't really describe any of this, because it would spoil the fun of watching it yourself.

As good as the action is, it is also over the top and cartoony. I suspect it is intended as a parody of action violence; Smith's constant chewing on carrots leads Kurtz to spout an Elmer Fudd line drawing an obvious comparison. It's a funny moment, but I'm not sure the film works on this level. The over the top gross elements take it to a different plane.

The story? The story is as cartoony and outlandish as the rest of the film. As we watch, it continues to become more outrageous. Who cares. I'm not going to a film called ""Shoot `Em Up"" looking for an Academy Award caliber performance. The story is supposed to be silly.

""Shoot `Em Up"" is not a perfect film. There are a few too many over the top gross elements as well. And every time Monica Bellucci appears on screen, I felt like ripping my ears out. But the Clive Owen and Paul Giamatti are fun and the action is over the top. I guarantee that you have never seen some of these action scenes.

My companion commented that she felt maybe Owen was trying to prove that he would have made a good James Bond. He certainly has the chops to carry an action film.",1189728000,,7896,4.5774946921443735
2999548,4,B000XA5K4I,"The simplest comparison for ""Shoot `Em Up"" is that it is a live action, R-rated Looney Toons show. In reality however, it is the ultimate guilty pleasure action film for extreme fans of the genre, and is closer to a Wile E. Coyote and Roadrunner episode with plenty of blood and gore and absolutely nothing for kids. Wildly stylized characters, way over-the-top action, and umbilical cord surgery with a bullet, ""Shoot `Em Up"" is explosive entertainment for only those who can stomach nonstop mindless action.

Expert marksman and live-action Bugs Bunny Mr. Smith (Clive Owen) rescues an infant from a gang of mercenaries and becomes embroiled in a conspiracy involving gun makers, senators, and maniacal hitman Hertz (Paul Giamatti). Recruiting sassy French prostitute Donna (Monica Bellucci) to care for the baby, Smith shoots his way to the top of the food chain in a wild fight to uncover those responsible for the devious plot.

A proverbial Bugs Bunny, including literally mimicking the ""wascally wabbit,"" Clive Owen's Mr. Smith exudes cool; it's apparent that this is his shot at being James Bond (director Michael Davis always wanted to direct a Bond film) and he's thrown in every snappy one-liner and unflinching glare that he possibly can. Paul Giamatti is the show stealer as the crazed assassin Mr. Hertz, who is ruthlessly vile, wickedly intelligent, and an inept family man. His role is constantly surprising and spontaneous, and his batty bearded grins are laughably priceless. Monica Bellucci seems selected only for her willingness to do nude scenes and her sexy French accent. The remainder of the supporting cast are merely targets thrown in front of machine guns and heavy firepower to keep the downtime to a minimum. Even sex scenes are blanketed by violence, gunfire, and a bit of humor. While everything is markedly seedy and gritty, these antiheroes and villains fit perfectly into the underworld locales and environments (you wouldn't guess Bellucci was a prostitute based on the trailer).

Some may consider Shoot `Em Up's weakest component to be its ridiculous story and the robotic debriefing of plot twists. But then they would have missed the point entirely. Davis' film mocks the overly simplistic and oftentimes nonsensical storylines of humdrum actioners and makes no excuses for its own deliberate transitions and set pieces that roll from one action sequence directly into another. Much like the clever ridicule of stereotypical horror films by Wes Craven's ""Scream,"" the characters in Shoot `Em Up are self aware of their positions in an action movie and work to make it as defiantly unexpected as possible. Clive Owen's Mr. Smith constantly spouts off his dislikes of the normalcies regularly witnessed in the genre, and the comforting blend of hyper-violence, twisted humor, and extreme exaggerations never stales throughout the relatively short running time. Nonstop action doesn't always make a movie, but it sure does help.

So much action permeates every scene in Shoot `Em Up that to call it just an action movie would be an understatement. It's unrelenting action bravado of a particularly brutal temperament, masked by loads of dark humor (even the sex scene manages to have a vicious firefight halfway through). Shoot `Em Up proves that carrots can be deadly weapons, limerick usage makes better bad guys, and no matter the amount of killing done, it can be redeemed by saving the life of a babe (or two). And having a plot isn't always a requirement for making an entertaining action movie.

2999549,4,B000XA5K4I,"Rarely has a title so accurately described the movie it represents. ""Shoot `Em Up"" is a no-holds-barred, over the top, action-packed roller coaster ride with a sick, depraved sense of humor. And yes, I enjoyed every second of it; here's a film so aware of its tastelessness that it piles it on thick, with stylish, excessive violence and one-liners so hokey that they succeed in being incredibly funny. It's a good thing it refuses to take itself seriously; only a tongue in cheek movie could feature a baby's birth in the midst of a shootout. You would never expect something like that to be fun, but it certainly is in the case of ""Shoot `Em Up."" Of all the mindless action films of recent memory, this one is by far the most original, the most engaging, and definitely the most entertaining.

The main character is a man known only as Mr. Smith (Clive Owen), a gun-toting tough guy who likes carrots and hates drivers that don't use turn signals. He opens the film with a shootout scene that's anything but formulaic--he tries to save a pregnant woman from an army of well-armed bad guys. Leading them is the ruthless Hertz (Paul Giamatti), who wants to get home for his son's birthday party. While Smith doesn't know who the woman is or why Hertz wants her dead, he willingly intervenes on her behalf, shooting whoever tries to get near her. He also delivers her baby with the speed and accuracy of a professional sharpshooter, even using his gun to shoot off the umbilical cord.

The baby is safe, thank goodness. Unfortunately, Smith is too late to save its mother, who quickly takes a bullet to the brain. Now stuck with a newborn, and now on Hertz's short list of business to be taken care of, Smith finds himself drawn into an elaborate web of political and medical corruption. To make sure the baby is cared for, he seeks the help of Donna Quintano (Monica Bellucci), an Italian prostitute specializing in clients with a lactation fetish. She's initially unwilling to have anything to do with Smith or the baby. But she lowers her defenses as the film progresses, albeit reluctantly. The baby--who she names Oliver--reminds her of a painful past event she's been trying to forget. And Smith ... well, he's just Smith: a cold, spiteful, wisecracking gun enthusiast.

Hertz, meanwhile, is desperately trying to find the baby. But why? Does it really matter? If it allows for scene after scene of fun-filled, high-energy shootouts, I should think not. This movie plays like an extended stunt montage, with every jump, kick, jab, punch, and slam made overtly unrealistic for maximum enjoyment. Characters shoot at each other as if being paid by the bullet. Wound-ridden bodies litter the floor. This movie's violence is so brutally overplayed that I couldn't help but laugh, which I'm sure was the intended effect. I also laughed quite a bit at Smith's jokiness as well as his unique views on protecting a newborn baby; there's a moment when he explains the intricacies of a gun to Oliver, from where to load it to how to hold it to when to shoot it. It should come as no surprise that the baby actually smiles at this.

Does this sound like the conventional material of an action film? If it were possible to pinpoint what makes this movie work so well, every filmmaker would be relying on it. The genre has nothing to do with it--action films are about as common as they get. It certainly isn't because it's wholesome, pure, or even necessary--this is escapism at its most extreme. Maybe it has something to do with revitalizing the action film, presenting a clever, original story that not only laughs at its own outrageousness, but flaunts it, as well. With the exception of its length (a brisk ninety minutes), everything about ""Shoot `Em Up"" is big, from the stunts to the sense of humor to the completely preposterous story. And that's exactly the way it should be; nothing this intense could ever be told on a small scale.

There's a scene late in the film that pits Smith against Hertz while on a flight: ""Guns don't kill people,"" Hertz says, ""but they sure do help."" Had this been any other movie, such a line might have been questionable, maybe even offensive. But for a film like ""Shoot `Em Up,"" it fits right in. Pretty much everything about this movie fits, despite being untamed, improper, and just plain excessive. But that's what makes it so much fun; the further it went, the more I enjoyed myself, and the more I enjoyed myself, the further it went. This movie doesn't know the meaning of restraint, and that above all else made it great. Only one thing that could have made it better: a body count at the bottom corner of the screen. Now that would have been funny.",1189296000,2,4691,4.674334140435835
2999550,4,B000XA5K4I,"This film is what the movie Crank wishes it was. A clever action movie with wit and an insane body count. Clive Owen owns this role as expected, and Paul Giamatti makes for an interesting villian. Monica Bellucci is eye candy for sure, but provides little else. There is almost no let up in the pace and the rock tunes really fit the many action scenes. People in my theater were going nuts over some of the gags.

2999551,5,B000XA5K4I,"This was one nasty, action-packed piece of celluloid. And I loved it. SHOOT 'EM UP feels like Owen, Giamatti, and Belluci, on a whim and during short breaks in between the shooting of a prestigious Ivory Merchant picture, decided to goof around with the cameras and somehow ended up with this bullet-riddled, somber-faced, but tongue-in-cheeked action film. Oh, the three of them play their roles intently and sincerely enough, but there doesn't seem to be a doubt that they had a hellacious hoot cobbling this actioner together. SHOOT 'EM UP is unapologetically, subversively violent and darkly humorous, furiously careening on screen like a Frank Miller graphic novel come to life.

The meager plot: Carrot-chomping Mr. Smith (the cool and stoic Clive Owen) comes to the aid of a pregnant woman being pursued by a pack of assailants. In a tone-setting scene, the woman buys a bullet but not before Mr. Smith accesses his inner midwife and delivers the baby, along the way offing a villain with a vegetable. Now, Smith's maternal side surfaces as he's compelled to protect the newborn infant being mysteriously sought by a gang of gunmen, led by the vicious but p-whipped Mr. Hertz (Paul Giamatti, playing marvelously against type). Smith finds himself turning to one person: a beautiful, golden-hearted prostitute named DQ (Monica Belluci). And that's really all the plot one needs to know.

In conceptualizing this film, probably the first thing to get tossed out the window was subtlety. What we're left with is a film with a title that's dead-on descriptive. The film foregoes things like plot nuances and character depth and development in favor of getting to the set pieces A.S.A.P. And, yet, the film does manage to maintain coherence and cohesion. The film opens up with a sequence that'll get your juices flowing, but, then, it sustains the high-octane pace. So, for those who like their flicks narratively fleshed out and fully explored, beware. There comes a time when a fella just gets sick and tired of back stories and elucidative exposition. SHOOT 'EM UP is a guy's flick, thru and thru, and will instantly envelop you in a warm, fuzzy blanket of wanton destruction and carrot abuse. This is a short film (around an hour and a half), but it comes at you in torrents of preposterous, frenetic, but stylish action sequences.

And, absolutely, it more than makes up for the latest theater yawnfest that was Jet Li and Jason Statham's WAR. The male leads in SHOOT 'EM UP are two actors who, to go by their past works, are essentially bumming it here. But they do end up lending what credibility there is to lend to a film like this. Clive Owen plays it just right with his antihero character. Owen's Smith, with intense and deadpan panache and an understated one-liner or two, just keeps on wreaking damage of cartoonish proportions. By sheer will power and an overpoweringly composed demeanor, Owen makes you go along with the blistering sequences even as you shake your head at the gross unbelievability of it all. He does things with carrots which I'm quite certain God never intended for carrots to do. Paul Giamatti, whose Mr. Hertz seems to toil in a state of ever increasing aggravation, is again wonderful, this time in a part we're not used to seeing him play. It's a nice touch, by the way, the pestering wife and all. Henpecked and evil, that's Hertz all over. And, while Monica Belluci isn't really given much to work with in her been-there, done-that role, she looks beautiful, as ever.

2999553,5,B000XA5K4I,"Homeless bum Mr. Smith (Clive Owen) winds up getting involved in a bad situation when he helps deliver a baby, but the mother (Ramona Pringle) gets killed in the process by plenty of thugs. These thugs are the followers of Mr. Hertz (Paul Giamatti), a whipped contract killer who has plans for the baby. Smith can only turn to a hooker named ""DQ"" (Monica Bellucci), someone he recently had liaisons with, and the only woman who can deliver milk for her customers.

Michael Davis may only be known for his work on various direct-to-DVD features (including the horror comedy ""Monster Man""). But he is making a major debut in silver screens with the bombastic action event of the fall season, ""Shoot 'Em Up"". At first, it may be hard to top recent non-stop action funfests from this past summer (""D.O.A. Dead or Alive"" and ""Transformers""), but then again, it doesn't have to. And that's why it's such a great ride.

Cribbing from John Woo 101, ""SEU"" starts off with guns blazing and over-the-top violence you have to see to believe. As well as using pistols and AK's, Smith also uses carrots to kills his enemies. It may sound silly, but Smith's clever plans allow this trick to achieve its goal, especially with guns in hand. Of course, the carrot gags tend to get old (you can literally start a drinking game and drink whenever Smith eats a carrot, or Hertz making reference to Bugz Bunny and Elmer Fudd or Energizer Bunny), but Davis compensates with fast-paced wall-to-wall action that films like ""Live Free or Die Hard"" could've used.

Besides, with tracks from AC/DC (""If You Want Blood, You Got It""), Motorhead (""Ace of Spades""), and Wolfmother (""Joker & the Thief), how could you not resist ""SEU""'s intent to entertain your pants off?

And I'm surprised by the star wattage of a film like this. Especially since Clive Owen appeals more to adults. Owen may tend to overplay his hand and fill any air with corny one-liners that James Bond wouldn't even be caught dead saying, but when handling the action-packed scenes, he's a great Chow Yuen-Fat surrogate. He gets further compliments from Monica Bellucci or Paul Giamatti, two other actors who wouldn't wind up in a film like this, yet they fulfill their duties.

Shoot 'Em Up also had the nasty habit to go south when Davis inserts a scene of drama (this little batch of Kool-Aid was consumed in Robert Rodriguez's ""Grindhouse"" feature ""Planet Terror""; frankly, trying to be poignant in a film that's pretty much a cartoon is a red flag) or flat-out explains the twist about why the baby is being targeted. That's all taken care of in the finale, which I dare not spoil.

It's a nice change of scenery when, in the midst of crappy sequels, a director has a set of balls to be unpretentious and deliver what's expected. I've said this concerning recent films from Michael Bay, Corey Yuen, or Edgar Wright, but Michael Davis proudly joins that list. And I hope that there are more well-intentioned filmmakers who can deliver the goods as much as he can. But this is coming from someone who doesn't watch these overrated Oscar-nominated films (which, I'm sure, will include Tom Cruise's next bullcrap project ""Lions for Lambs"").",1189123200,2,3181,4.764065335753176

Yell at the wife sort for no reason sort of bad. You'll be in a foul mood for days if you sit through this crap.  The writing is stale. The acting even worse. The direction, I've seen a pregnant 19 year old toothless meth-head call girl crossing guard give better directions outside our local elementary school. The special effects are as special as a one-toothed dog in a flea biting contest. Nothing beautiful but they get the job done.

Its so bad, its good. Oh who am I kidding. Its so far from good. It sucks balls. Don't fall for that tired cliche. It can be enjoyed however. In the right state of mind.",1502755200,,769,4.565217391304348

It's a great concept and the gun fights, more or less a spoof of the genre, are laugh out loud hilarious.  Unfortunately all remaining humor fell flat.  The script writing just wasn't that great and it never quite got good rhythm going; maybe a copy editing issue or something?  I don't know.

I think Clive Owen is one of the underrated greats of the genre, serious or comedic, and deserves a seat at the table with Jason Statham, Matt Damon, or even Christian Bale.  His on screen intensity is second only to the like Denzel.  I guess that may be why I had higher hopes for this movie.  In this case unfortunately, he couldn't make up for subpar writing and seemingly lackadaisical editing, which left all the campy one liners without any comedic punch.
Still, as much as I seem to be panning it I still had a good time.  If you aren't super picky this is still worth a watch.",1495843200,,1035,4.338541666666667

Bullets can spin playground merry go rounds, a cheesy villain (who also miraculously avoids getting shot), a witty prostitue, and a baby that at times during action scenes is clearly a doll strapped to his back, all just make the movie more fun!

2999840,2,B000XA5K4I,"Trash! Even for a low-budget, cheap production with no-name actors it was a sorry production. I watched it because a friend in Thailand who does not understand English well as spoken by thugs and British people) told me she watched it. I found it on youtube but the sound was too low, so I went to Amazon and took a chance - invested $2.99 - plus tax - after I saw it was rated 4 stars - right up there with that ""Aces"" movie with Ben Affleck, which is a classic.

But, even as a  caricature of bad spy movies with too many incidental murders and too much of people driving around smashing ordinary peoples' cars and trashing ordinary peoples' lives it does not work. The hero had got the mean ""stare"" down pat - I give you that: he can stare, while eating a carrot and you can believe that he is really one of the dangerous ones, contemplating breaking out into violent justice against the sick, evil-doers out there. But the bad guys are lousy actors, trying to act like imitation characters as seen normally in cheap movies - and they fail at it. If I could suspend believe and pretend that a person really could take the time to wind up for a death blow to someone's head - and not get a knee to the groin or anything that his clueless evil opponent might due while waiting -  or that someone could in theory make one wild shot while hanging upside down or sliding across an oil-spill on a floor.... but not 15 people shot one after the other while standing in plain sight, firing hundreds of bullets that never hit anyone except for one freak shot into the head of the woman who just gave birth the baby .....

No. If you like this sort of movie, then this movie is Trash!

So.... why did I watch it? I didn't. A lttle after the hero walked out of the gun shop - after paying for some weapons of war and ammunition (partly with food stamps {that wasn't funny}) and found his hooker assistant - whom we already know is a cowardly loser who would have sold him out to the murderous inept jerk who has to hire 50 MORE thugs for backup after he blew the last assassination attempt and finds she has disappeared - gone done an alley with a trick - to make some money for the baby - I stopped watching. Even  the cliches, spoken and acted-out were not funny.

I would rather spend my time - meditating, exercising, studying earh-bag construction online, reading what other insomniacs write .... than watching such garbage.",1441152000,,2421,4.3547671840354765

2999888,4,B000XA5K4I,"In the first 30 seconds of the movie, I thought I had made a mistake in renting this flick.  It looked like it was going to be a self-aware, heavy-handed parody of the action genre, which would be leaden and unfunny.  But actually the movie turned into a pretty decent actioner, albeit the action sequences were over the top - way over the top - and yet it kept my attention - despite some cringe-worthy violence - and I actually got invested in the shallow two-dimensional characters.

This movie was more like an action movie on steroids, rather than a straight up parody.  The movie had all the cliches of the actioner; Clive Owens delivered the de rigeur quip at the end of each sequence like Schwarzenegger or Willis and the gunfire would have involved tons of ammunition.

A surprise was nebbish Paul Giamatti's turn as tough-guy villain. Giamatti was a stone cold killer, and, yet, still a kind of nebbish.

Nothing brilliant or memorable, but not a bad couple of hours of entertainment, so long as you are capable of handling gun-fire, violence and squirting blood.",1431734400,2,1073,4.711229946524064

It is so over-the-top, it will bring you a lot of laughs in it's cartoonish approach to the genre. Clive Owen is great as the serious ""Bugs Bunny carrot-eating-hero"" and Paul Giamatti is hilarious as the bad guy. One of my favorite scenes in the film is when Clive is surrounded by 30 bad guys with automatic weapons and somehow Clive kills all of them. Giamatti says, ""Are we that bad or is he really that good?!"" HILARIOUS!! Definitely recommend this for story, choreographed stunts and overall entertainment!",1431734400,,603,4.644859813084112

Be sure to move the rug out from in front of your entertainment center because 100% pure, grade-A American cheddar will ooze out of your speakers and screen. Don't let it go to waste. Make nachos or something. There is a scene involving Paul Giamatti, a merry-go-round, a baby, Clive Owen, and some guns (Yes, guns! Imagine that!)

Clive kills at least 4 or 5 bad mercenaries every few minutes for the entire movie. His skills were marveled by the chief of the bad guys who was amazed at where he got this training. When all the smoke clears all the bad guys are dead and Clive and his girl friend and the baby are safe. Sky diving shoot outs and head on crashes to get into the bad guys car are just some of the amazing feats of our hero. He eats lots of carrots and uses them for trigger control on his weapons too!

What's with Clive Owen eating a carrot and killing people with it? That's just so stupid! How did this piece of trash get made?

Also, this film is tremendously vulgar and I mean really pervertedly vulgar. One example is Paul Giamatti fondling a dead woman in the backseat of a car. I can't believe the three main actors would even have consented to be in such garbage. Clive Owen, for whom I always enjoyed in films, has been in a couple of really terrible movies, this one by far the worst! If he continues to choose really sick films like this to star in, he might find he won't have much of a career left.

This movie is so over the top in its cartoon violence, pacing, effects and gun-play that one just has to shut off upper brain functions and enjoy the ride.  I originally saw this about the same time as the Crank movies which I similarly got a kick out of.  In short a marksman protects a baby w/ the help of a lactating hooker from hit men for a gun manufacturer trying to stop a bone marrow harvesting senator who would put them out of business. Got that? Laugh!  The blu-ray picture quality is terrific and there's a nice layer of filmic grain throughout, details are very sharp.  I imagine these actors all had fun w/ this film, Giamatti chews scenery and glowers menacingly as the chunky assassin whose gunfights are periodically interrupted by phone calls from his nagging wife.

Too much action at the expense of any semblance of a plot.

Don't get me wrong, I like my guns, bullets and steel.  But I don't like the idea of 2 hours of over the top unbelievable stuff lacking any plot whatsoever.  Guns are guns and it's cool when the good guys need to be careful too.  Is it meant to make fun of stupid action movies?  Possibly, but it also doesn't really look any different than the movies it makes fun of.

Now, I figure that lack of substance is precisely the point here, but that didn't make it any more enjoyable, to me.

And noir, the more I see it in its modern incarnations, is not my thing.

Past dislikes in similar movies:  Boondock Saints (which I hated even more), Hardboiled.

Past likes on action movies:  Man on Fire, Die Hard, Dirty Harry, Scarface, Devil's Rejects (horror), Payback.

I suppose part of the point of this picture is that it is supposed to be ridiculous, but it's not ridiculous in a good way at all. The acting seems weak to downright dreadful. The script goes for lowball funny jabs within one-liners, but the whole delivery of these lines makes it seem seriously predictable and downright annoying. Many of the moments that are there for comedy don't seem as funny as they do stupid and inept. I found my self thinking things like ""Oh gawd, I could have guessed he was going to say that and I was praying he wouldn't cuz if he does it's gonna be all downhill from here"" about 20 times. By the time it got to the overly fake looking skydiving shootout segment(which is near the end)I couldn't barely take it anymore. I shut the film off. I shut it off to save my self any further brain damage from this film, which putting it simply was pretty bad. The action sequences promised to be so insane and over the top that it would be the most amazing action footage ever committed to film. But it fails to do this dreadfully because there have been other films that had such sequences that were even more ridiculous and over the top that were done with real creativity. First film that comes to mind off the top of my head is Kill Bill volume I. I should have stuck that in the Bluray player instead of this crap.

This film is not obviously not for those in the mood to think.  It's HEAVY on the action and light on just about everything else.  Actor and Actress wise it's actually good.  Monica Belluci is a great actress, and although this film is not a BRIGHT spot in her career, she still is not terrible in her performance.

Clive in this film is a pistal expert...that's an understatement.  The man makes shots that only could be matched by Golgo 13 in their impossibleness.

Story.  There is none.  Something about a baby, it's organs...or something.

This is a leave your thinking cap at the door film.  Sometimes we guys need those kind of movies.  Will your girlfriend like this?  What do you think.

Is it odd at times.  The part where Monica is in the...house of ill repute with that guy...was kind of wierd.  Also one thing that kept stabbing me while watching this film, Clive Owen must have stunk.  He nevers showers, lives in an abandoned factory with rats and wears rags for clothes.  Just a thought I wanted to share.

Should you pay a fortune for this movie.  No, in fact you probably can stream this from mutiple (legit) sources right now.  Well, that's my two cents worth.  FYI, this actually rented really good when it first came out on DVD, people were fans of it for a while.

Watch this solo with a plate of nachos and enjoy.  Don't forget to pick out something your girlfriend likes too.  In fact forget seeing a movie in, take her to see that new Zach Efron movie...",1335484800,2,1499,4.503731343283582

3000034,5,B000XA5K4I,"What a wonderful piece of mind candy.  Just remember, this movie is a spoof -- a comedy.  A carrot-chomping, dark-souled hero (Clive Owen) who was national pistol champion at age ten?  Of course he's got to win against each and every bad guy.  Thus, with his first wave of thugs destroyed, the evil-doer (Paul Giamatti) hears that it's only going to be possible to scrape together another ""fifty"" to finish off the lone hero.

As something maybe akin to mockumentary, ""Shoot 'Em Up"" takes what's real from the action thriller genre and creates a brilliant parody.  The action scenes, chases, gun-bursts, and all the effects seem as though they belong.  We might expect Charles Bronson, Steven Seagal, or Vin Diesel to appear at any moment.  Instead, Clive Owen carries the day, stuffing more than one baddie with a quick carrot through the brain.  Seriously!  Dozens more fall in various hails of gunfire or stunningly improvised booby traps.

A good many action-thriller cliches get taken over the top -- the bordello gunfights, the mutual redemption of the anti-hero and the fallen woman, a crusader politician who proves more than susceptible to betraying the cause, arms dealing, and the perpetual search for a truly safe hideout.

Of course, in this ""mock-u-thriller"" the love-making that seals the deal in the mutual redemption between our protagonists reaches its culmination in hail of gunfire with black-clad gunmen falling on all sides.  First, think Jack Nicholson's ""Triumph"" scene with Sally Struthers in ""Five Easy Pieces.""  Then, turn the scene into a Ninja attack and allow Clive Own to use an automatic rifle as he swirls Monica Bellucci to ecstasy. For the double-dealing politician, ""Shoot 'Em Up"" makes short work of the obligatory struggle on the chartered airliner.  Clive Owen pretty quickly takes the politician hostage, holding off Paul Giamatti and assorted thugs just long-enough to get into the cargo hold, where he plugs his hostage between the eyes and jumps into an extraordinary sky-diving gunfight, thus creating yet another labor shortage in the thug market.

A few last takes on these mock-u-thriller touches:  The tank on display in a military exhibition provides the safe house for Monica Bellucci and the infant, who is the real target of the thugs.  The ""not-airlines-trains-ships-buses"" escape for Bellucci and the child is cunningly labeled the bus to ""Wherever.""  Clive Owen stays behind to kill off a final wave of thugs, the ""super boss,"" and Paul Giamatti  The happy reunion bringing Clive Owen, Monica Bellucci, and their adopted infant back together takes place in the roadside restaurant where Bellucci and the infant have gone to ground -- in the midst of foiling a robbery attempt by a gang of seriously armed thugs.

Clive Owen, Monica Bellucci, and Paul Giamatti are fabulous at carrying through straight-faced with their schtick.  What a treat.",1328832000,3,2897,5.1191489361702125
3000035,2,B000XA5K4I,"This is a very over the top action shooter, and it knows that and pokes fun at it along the way. Basically you have this tough guy protecting a baby that a ton of people want dead and this introduces him to very outrageous events along the way.

The choreography of the people fighting each other is top notch with some cool kills. While there are cool kills, you have a lot of stuff in the movie that looks so obviously fake, and this takes you straight out of the movie. I have never seen so many different guns in a movie. Ever. Mr. Smith is always picking up guns from the people he has killed, so you get to see a lot of different guns being used from revolvers, handguns, shotguns, sub-machine guns, and so much more

Clive Owen brings his A game to this movie, and he really shines through this movie. From his amusing one liners to him reacting to every day scenarios we face. The gun sound effects are really good, and each gun has its only personality that is brought to life via the unique sounds each one makes. The soundtrack isn't too bad, but with a movie that's about the kills and over the top action, music doesn't really need to be Emmy winning.

The special features are pretty cool, with behind the scenes footage runs about 50 minutes long. Along with that, The animatics the director made years ago is included and its about 20 minutes long of rough drawings, but still cool to think he just decided to make this as a pitching tool.

If you like to watch movies with over the top action and some funny diaoluge, than this is the movie for you.
Note to PC Users: If you watch movies on your pc do NOT get this movie. I was not able to run the movie, you are forced to install the Interactual Player, and I highly advise against that since this program messes up your computer (From my experience with it). This is inexcusable sicne I have watched other movies that offer for you to install the Interactual program, but still lets you watch the movie in Windows media player. So I recommend passing on this movie if all you use is a computer.

The Academy gave ...THE HURT LOCKER an Oscar and they passed over this movie!!? SHOOT 'EM UP deserves an Oscar for just two unforgettable scenes: the packaging-line shootout in Mr Smith's lair and the unique shootout/sex ballet. Now, throw in Paul Giammati's smart-ass one-liners and you have yourself a movie which is great fun to watch.

Giammati may try his hardest to be the usual scene-stealer yet Clive Owen is the one who really delivers this movie. I am sure when they watched this, the producers of the James Bond franchise were kicking themselves for going with...Daniel Craig.

Clive Owen is the reluctant hero who gets involved when he sees thugs with guns follow a very pregnant woman.  During the ensuing shootout, the woman dies and Owen is literally left holding the baby.  Owens lists the help of the gorgeous Monica Bellucci to help him care for the baby.

Paul Giamatti is brilliant as the the cold, ruthless, contract killer who is thwarted by Owen at every turn.  Contrast this with his role in Sideways and you come to appreciate what a great actor Giamatti is.  The subplot involving Giamatti's wife constantly calling to see when he is returning home to help celebrate her birthday is hilarious.  The rest of the movie involves Owen trying to piece together why Giamatti was hired to kill the baby and his mother.  Besides the humourous lines that Owens and Giamatti have, the plot is quite interesting, which makes this movie much more interesting than similar movies such as, for example, the Transporter.  The action sequences are over the top so be prepared to suspend reality and just enjoy the ride.  Highly reccomended.",1279411200,,1281,4.695067264573991
3000082,3,B000XA5K4I,"I went into SHOOT 'EM UP knowing nothing about it, and thinking, ""dang this is stupid"", prepared for the worst almost from the get-go.  Or so it seemed at first, before I figured out that this silly piece of fluff was SUPPOSED to be a parody, a satire, a comedy -- at least, I hope it wasn't supposed to be anything even remotely serious or dramatic. Not that it necessarily succeeds even in its silliness, as there's nothing much new here or really interesting besides the ridiculous kinetic velocity of the whole thing. Nobody has any time to breathe here, let alone sleep, use the bathroom or make love -- all of which are attempted, and interrupted in quite violent ways, thus ensuring the parody aspects....I think. Clive Owen gets a fair amount of criticism from some quarters, and while I don't think it's entirely deserved, in this case I would have liked to see someone with a little more humor, a glint in his eye and a light smirk in his delivery -- Timothy Dalton 15 years ago comes to mind as a perfect choice. I can't argue with Monica Bellucci, who really exists only as eye candy; Paul Giamatti is getting tiresome in these obnoxious, weaselly villain roles but I suspect he's doing exactly what he's supposed to be doing here, so kudos.

What surprised me the most is that for a big-budget action film everything looked so dirty and dank, even the exteriors, and that so many of the action sequences are so cramped and hard to follow. Never mind the ridiculousness of the plot; again, if it's a parody, we just have to accept Owen somehow getting into this huge arms manufacturer's HQ/warehouse and booby-trapping his own guns to use against him and his men. What we shouldn't have to accept is that it's hard to tell what's going on in nearly every scene where guns are in play (which is most scenes) and that the colors and lighting are so washed-out and ugly. I really thought this was shot on DV until looking up the specs here, and was astonished that the ace cinematographer behind such Hong Kong classics as THE KILLER and THE BRIDE WITH WHITE HAIR shot this; perhaps this is what was intended, but it sure didn't work for me.  Not sure why action films these days seem to all want to look simultaneously flashy and grungy; I guess somebody likes the aesthetic or it wouldn't be so common.

And yet, the goofiness of it all did keep me entertained for the (thankfully) short running time. The car chase sequence alone was almost worth the price of admission, at the very least worth a laugh and a ""oh they didn't do that did they? really?"" moment. It's hard for me to find something I haven't seen in an action film, and this offered a couple of brief bits of that, so it certainly wasn't a total loss. Watched theatrically on first release and again recently.  Certainly worth a look for connoisseurs of action cinema at it's most over-the-top and demented.",1278720000,3,2882,4.555984555984556

3000085,4,B000XA5K4I,"To say that this film is over the top at being over the top, would be as intellectually insightful as saying water is wet. There's not a single thing in this movie that can be taken seriously, despite the fact it's loaded with violence and adult themes, and therein lies the true charm of the spectacle.

Clive Owens plays the mystery man known only as ""Smith."" After he helps a women birth her child during a gunfight, he finds himself caught up in a web of outrageous political intrigue, with the baby's life, as well as his own, as the stakes.

This is basically a parody send up of every gun-blazing, ass-kicking, tough guy action film you've ever even heard about. Owens character never misses a shot (or the chance to chomp on some carrots), in shootouts that are not just overly exaggerated, but completely impossible, in many cases. You have Paul Giamatti as the sleazy hit-man out to get him and the baby, with Monica Bellucci simply providing eye-candy, as the milk-giving whore helping Smith to save the child. There isn't a single moment that you can really take any of this seriously, but the filmmakers know this and don't just fail to apologize for it, but actually revel in it.

The choreography in the gunfights is superb. If you could actually pull off some of the stunts shown here, I fully believe the real world would be as mindlessly violent as this film is. My favorite has to be the skydiving shootout, where physics and several universal laws of kinetic energy and gravity simply don't exist. This is to say nothing of the many machismo one-liners that are constantly thrown around throughout the film, which provide the perfect black humor to the massive amounts of killing going on. Of course, one can't forget the rocking soundtrack, complete with trashy metal sounds, from groups like Motley Crue and Motorhead, that only intensifies the sensation.

Is ""Shoot 'Em Up"" sexist? Yep. Is it somewhat homophobic? You betcha. Is it overly violent? Oh, hell yes! The film is all of that, as well as not having a single redeeming value within the whole product. Yet, despite all of this, it is still a rip-roaring, testosterone-fueled, slam-banging, out-of-control good time, that will charm it's way into your heart and have you quoting lines from it for days afterwards! If you are someone who's easily offended, or has delicate sensibilities, then this movie is one you probably should avoid. For everyone else, just sit back and watch the mindless carnage unfold. This is truly a guy's movie, for guys who like movies. And it is probably the guiltiest pleasure experience I've had in some time.",1272585600,,2619,4.787610619469026

3000087,4,B000XA5K4I,"Action-packed, adrenaline driven and all-out action is what you can expect from ""Shoot `Em Up"", a 2007 film directed by Michael Davis.

Sure, Davis wrote the 1994 video game based stinker ""Double Dragon"" but he did rebound with ""Eight Days a Week"" in 1997.  A decade later, Davis has crafted a film that is not only mindless action but it's the kind of action that is plenty of fun, never boring and on Blu-ray, it's a title that sports awesome picture quality and lossless audio.

Davis teams up with well-known martial arts cinematographer Peter Pau (""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", ""The Promise"", ""Perhaps Love"", ""The Forbidden Kingdom"") and composer Paul Haslinger (""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"", ""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"", ""Death Race"").

""Shoot `Em Up"" is an action comedy about a drifter named Mr. Smith (played by Clive Owen, ""Sin City"", ""The Boys Are Back"", ""The International"") who is waiting for his bus ride but sees a pregnant woman running away.  Next thing you know, a gun wielding man is after her.  At first, Smith wants nothing to do with it but decides last minute to help her out.

As the woman tries to defend herself with a gun, the man is about to kill her but the carrot chomping Mr. Smith quickly acts by stabbing the man with a carrot.  All of a sudden, the woman is giving birth and at the same time, more men have arrived with guns ablazing and Mr. Smith shows his excellent marksmanship and gun skills and takes many of them out and eventually helping the woman give birth to a baby boy.

We then see the man who is calling all the shots, a man named Hertz (played by Paul Giamatti, ""Sideways"", ""Cinderella Man"", ""Duplicity"") who doesn't seem too scared of Mr. Smith.  Smith knows he is in a bind without a weapon and thus he tries to get the woman and baby to safety but unfortunately the mother is killed.  Smith must decide to leave or take the baby with him and he decides to help the baby.

And next thing you know, Smith becomes a major target as everyone seems to be after the baby for some reason and will do anything to kill it.

Smith goes to the only person he knows to take care of the baby for a day while he tries to find out who the men chasing the baby are.  The woman is a prostitute named Donna (played by Monica Bellucci, ""The Passion of Christ"", ""Matrix Revolutions"", ""The Matrix Reloaded"") who has no interest in helping Mr. Smith at all.

As Smith leaves, it appears that the men who are after the baby are always a step behind in finding it.  But this time, they have traced Smith and the baby at the whorehouse and immediately Hertz starts to scare and torture Donna for information on Mr. Smith (which she knows nothing).  Fortunately, Smith is able to rescue her in time but now, Mr. Smith, Donna and the baby are on the run from Hertz and his men who will do whatever it takes to kill him and the baby.

Will Smith find out why the baby is a target?  Will he be able to protect both the baby and Donna?

VIDEO:

""Shoot `Em Up"" looks fantastic on Blu-ray.  Presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1 aspect ratio), the film tends to be saturated with focus on a few colors as you can see blues, greens, blacks, orange and reds being the primary colors of the film.  You literally can see the detail and the hair stubble, the skin pores and the grime on Mr. Smith, you can see the overall grittiness of the city and for the most part, detail is captured quite well on Blu-ray.

Blacks are nice and deep, I see no artifacts, DNR (Digital Noise Reduction) or any problems with the picture quality.  This is literally perfection when it comes to PQ for a film on Blu-ray and ""Shoot `Em Up"" looks absolutely fantastic.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Shoot `Em Up"" is presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and what an incredible lossless soundtrack this film is presented with.  For one thing, this is an action film that just doesn't show signs of any long moments of inactivity.  There is just action throughout with maybe a brief segment of dialogue and then more action.  And the keyword to describe this 7.1 lossless soundtrack is ""immersive"".  Gunshots, bullets whizzing, car crashing, you name it...you hear it all around you.  From sound effects, footsteps, the music, the baby crying, there is just a feeling of sound that envelops your soundscape and for audiophiles, you will more than likely gush with this soundtrack.

Subtitles are presented in English SDH and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

What an enjoyable ride has ""Shoot `Em Up"" turned out to be.

In some way, the film could have gone the ""Leon the Professional"" direction but instead of being a drama, ""Shoot `Em Up"" ends up being an action comedy as the film showcases Mr. Smith taking out dozens of people with his quick gun skills and excellent marksmanship.  He loves chomping on carrots, loves his guns and shows sign of being quite an intelligent man.  We don't know his background, but we know that he kicks major butt!

And the film is pretty much representative of the fact that Mr. Smith is just the epitome of a man who can kick some serious tail.  Your eyes are literally glued to the screen as there is a sense of choreography when Smith shoots his enemies but you add the sexy Monica Belluci and these two literally set off sparks in the film.  One of the most hilarious and sexiest moments of the film are when Smith and Donna are making love and as he is doing his thing, he is taking on the bad guys while having sex, while Donna is enjoying every minute of it.

Another hilarious scene features a mother spanking her child.  Mr. Smith not liking the mother punishing her child in that manner, starts spanking the mother and telling her if she likes how that feels.

And there are many of these enjoyable and fun moments of the film but at the same time, the film has its sense of B-movie gore as we see carrots gouging a man's head through the eye socket to body part dismemberments throughout the film.

The film is a violent, action-packed film but all its violence and humor just works for this film and definitely enhances the enjoyment of it.  Granted, I'm sure there are some people who may balk about how the baby is put through many violent situations throughout the film but this is an action comedy with farfetched situations. There is no realism, this is all crazy entertainment that resembles the experience of  playing a one player action/adventure video game shooter and instead of you controlling the character and picking people out, Mr. Smith does that for you.

As mentioned, the Blu-ray sports awesome picture quality and lossless audio.  I was very impressed by this Blu-ray release and the fact that you can find it for a pretty good price these days is great.

Overall, if you are looking for an action film full of non-stop action and humor with less focus on the drama, then definitely check out ""Shoot `Em Up"".  Definitely a Blu-ray worthy of being in your collection if you are interested in an action comedy film with mindless violence!  Prepare yourself for one wild and crazy ride with ""Shoot `Em Up"".  A film that is definitely recommended!",1271721600,3,8971,4.661998726925525

He's far from a doctor and farther from a parent, but when he unwittingly discovers an innocent woman delivering a baby right in the middle of a gunfight, Smith enters the fray to save her and though the woman expires, he is the one left in care of the orphaned child. He thinks that the killers were after the woman, but soon he realizes that they had a far more unlikely target: the baby. Smith's regular company is a seedy underworld full of unsavory characters, so he takes the child to the closest thing he knows to a mother: a sultry prostitute. This movie is pure action fun - not much in the way of literary devices, no insight, no meaningful pauses. It is meant to be one thing - an adrenaline rush. But to enjoy it to the fullest, you must suspend reality and just take it in as it comes. It will be gory, it will be fantastic, it will be on orgy of bullets, but most importantly, it will bring you to the edge of your seat.

3000096,4,B000XA5K4I,"Shoot 'em Up (Michael Davis, 2007)

I knew I was going to love Shoot 'em Up about thirty seconds into the movie, when we first see Smith (Clive Owen), the film's protagonist, and he's sitting at a bus stop looking all badass and...eating a carrot. That was my first clue that this is not your mama's action film, and boy, is it ever. Ever not. Something like that. In any case, what it turns out to be is a hilarious, and brilliant, sendup of every genre clich&eacute; there is, while still being the most satisfying action movie I've seen this year, if not longer. I'm just going off the top of my head here, but I think this is my favorite action movie since Dead or Alive: Final. And that's saying something.

In any case, after an opening scene where a lot of things blow up in a very amusing manner, it comes to pass that Smith finds himself in charge of a baby and on the run from a gang led by a nasty sort named Hertz (Paul Giamatti). Smith needs to find some way to feed the kid, so he enlists the help of a reluctant prostitute (Monica Bellucci) who's currently lactating. The rest of the movie involves the three of them dodging a whole lot of bullets while Smith tries to figure out what Hertz and all the gangsters he can enlist are after this kid. (I'm not even going to hint at it, because when I say this movie is brilliant, I mean it. Amazing plotting here.)

Davis (Monster Man), who also wrote the screenplay, fires on all cylinders here. Everything is well-done, and everything integrates well--the strong character development, the comic timing, the plot and its twists, the amazing acting (aside from the top dogs, the movie also features such excellent, and in many cases underrated, actors as Julian Richings, David Ury, Daniel Pilon, and especially Stephen McHattie, whose very name attached to any movie in the past ten years, seemingly, turns it to gold), all the subtle (and not-so-subtle, viz. The hysterical love scene) jabs at other action films. Leave your belief at the door; this is as over-the-top as they come, and it's supposed to be. If you passed it by when it came out because you're not an action movie fan, give it a go now; it's well worth your time. *** ",1260489600,3,2198,4.4875

Also, the end of the movie reveals the entire plot, if you can call it a plot, is about a man (Clive Owen) shooting hundreds of people in an attempt to assist an anti-second amendment agenda.

The movie makes a pretty good attempt, but in the end I didn't think that the violence was interesting enough, and the humor wasn't funny enough to pull it off.

3000101,5,B000XA5K4I,"Shoot 'em Up (2007) is an outrageously slick action flick, which seems to slide seamlessly between scenes jammed with amazing stunts, violence, and gunfire.  Writer and director Michael Davis, wanted his film to be 'guncentric', all about the heavy duty use of firearms, and except for the judicious use of a certain hard orange vegetable, that is pretty much what he has done.

In a wild opening sequence, Mr. Smith (Clive Owen) intervenes to in plot to kill a pregnant woman, and by the end of it, dead bodies are strewn everywhere, Smith has delivered a baby, had a face to face meeting with top baddie Mr. Hertz (Paul Giamatti), done some wild sliding, some high flying, and has a new best buddy.  And that's just the beginning of an outrageously entertaining contest, between the quick-tempered and unstoppable Smith, and the ultra annoying, intuitive, ex-FBI 'forensic behavior consultant', turned killer, Hertz.  Along the way, pieces of the puzzle start to fall in place, in a cartoonlike story that is uberbizarre.

In need of a babysitter, Smith turns to Donna Quintano (Monica Bellucci), a hooker who's specialty is servicing those with a lactation fetish.  ""DQ"" is soon forced to team up with Smith, after Hertz and his soldiers show up, looking for the boy.  Hertz is damn hard to kill, has uncanny tracking ability, and an almost unlimited supply of men.  The story has so many wicked twists, with shootout following inventive shootout.  The situations, setups, and stunts, just keep coming, and get more and more intense, peaking when Smith take a dive from a plane, and engages in an insanely exciting, and delightful gunbattle in the air.

Hertz's annoying face appears once more, and this time Smith gets his fingers snapped like a bunch of carrots, but still won't reveal where the boy, now called 'Oliver' is.  When Hertz decides to get 'invasive', it's time for another miraculous escape, one that features a crazy and painful method for firing a bullet.  The finale in a Dairy Queen, shows Smith finding another way to employ that hard orange vegetable.

If  you want a killer action flick that just never stops, Shoot 'em Up is definitely one of best in recent years.  Michael Davis had been doing smaller films, but this project proves the big time is where he belongs.  Davis provides an interesting, informative, and almost non-stop commentary track.  He repeatedly says that different things were included in the film, just because it 'made him laugh'.  There are some cool featurettes covering the making of the film, including the use of robotic stand-in babies.  Most movies do not live up to the hype, but this is the rare exception, and it may just make you laugh too.",1255392000,,2700,4.881578947368421

And what a roller coaster!  If you insist on complete realism in your movies, this one isn't for you.

I can't do battle while ""getting it on"" with my woman - therefore it's impossible! I can't even meet a woman - therefore it's impossible!

I only want to see movies that are original and I only want to see things done in movies for the first time - making it the MOST original. I'd never own a movie because I would have to see something I've already seen more than once. Talking in a movie - seen it! Shooting in a movie - seen it! Babies in a movie - seen it! Carrots in a movie - seen it!

Everyone says that Empire Strikes Back is the best Star Wars - well - I'll never know because I've already seen Phantom Menace and I don't need to see things I've already seen - because I've already seen it!

I never want to see any action EVER in a movie unless there is a strong reason as to why that action is taking place! If someone stands up in a movie - I want there to be proper context and back-story as to know why that person is standing up. If there isn't - it's lame!

I turned this movie off after 4-seconds (which I'm representing here with my 4-star review) because I've already seen what they were showing - and there was no proper context - and it made me so mad that I snapped the DVD in half and shouted at my television set for one-half hour!

3000109,3,B000XA5K4I,"""Shot them up"" is a smart parody, a funny evasion movie that must be seen only under these circumstances. The laughable plot simply is an artifice that works as huge back up for (How would we say?) the imaginative, amusing and certainly original sequences, car chases, aerial maneuvers and bizarre devices to face a devilish criminal web of conflicts and interests between a Senator and a bunch of ruthless gangsters. Clive Owen embodies the accurate blend of three well known personages of action since the seventies until the nineties: James Bond, Rambo and the officer Mac Lane, spiced with a touch of ""Sin city.""

At last instance , the movie seems to extracted from a script from Cohen brothers Quentin Tarrantino and Robert Rodriguez, , due the rampant audacious and the febrile kinetic energy displayed all the way through.

Violence and black humor in great doses, but besides, maternal love around a baby who seems to be quiet with the rock music works out as a mesmerizing feast for all those who seek to mesmerize themselves around the special effects universe.

But please; don't try to find out a minimal sense in this surrealistic movie. It's just another way to escape from the quotidian reality in which we are immersed and nothing, nothing else.",1246579200,,1262,4.88785046728972

Clive Owen is well suited as the carrot eating, unstoppable killing machine who inadvertently becomes the protector of an infant who's mother is killed by dirt bags and want this baby! Paul Giamatti gives a equally colorful and humorous performance as the head dirt bag.

This is the epitome of dumb. Nothing before that sequence was any better. I suppose some people will write this off as my not being able to take a joke.

It's over the top, totally unbelievable, physically impossible, but absolutely brilliant all at the same time.

Clive Owen eats a lot of carrots and values his privacy. There are many things that he absolutely hates, and he comes into contact with most of these things when he unwillingly gets involved in a plot to kill a very pregnant young woman. Suddenly faced with a nanny job, he shoots his way out of the frying pan and into the fire, each scenario more jaw-dropping-ly impossible than the last. Paul Giamatti plays an unlikely criminal mastermind and Monica Bellucci is under-utilized in but she sizzles as the proverbial professional girl with a heart of gold. Things get political, and hopelessly complicated, and of course there's lots and lots (and lots) of shooting, during any (and I do mean ANY) situation. Four Stars!

It is a parody of all other senseless action movies before it, while at the same time making one that is the best of the genre. The actors are good, the action scenes are jaw droppingly great, the one liners are hilarious, Paul Giamati is a great villain, Clive Owen is awesome (as always), and the title describes what you will get with the movie. The movie is about 1/4 talking and 3/4 action, just how an action movie should be. My only complaint is the length. It is less than 90 minutes. But aside from that, the carrot deaths, the shoot out in the sky, the shoot out in the gun factory, the shoot out in the hotel room, and a whole lot of other cool scenes.

Here's the story, a guy named Smith played by Clive Owen finds a newborn baby, that for some reason a hitman played by Paul Giamatti wants dead now Smith has got to stop them and find out why they want this newborn dead.

Shoot'em Up dose what this film's called, guns, guns, and...well more guns, nothing beats hearing Motorhead's Ace of Spades playing while a gunfight is going down, the action is over the top but it's fun, the music rocks and there is some funny moment as well.

Well then step right up.. and get this.. hell...for $9 you CAN'T complain!

My only complaint on the movie itself, is that it would of been nice and a BIT more believable of Clive had a bullet proof vest on and occasionally got hit (Like Giamatti) On a side note Paul Giamatti is actually pretty cool as the ""bad guy"" in this movie.

Get this movie you will like it ~ if you don't expect much but mucho action, gunslinging and major violence...which I do!
See ya!

Starring- Clive Owen, Paul Giamatti, Monica Bellucci, Stephen McHattie, Daniel Pilon

Shoot `Em Up is one of those movies you'll either love or hate; you'll sit there watching it and be entertained or roll your eyes at the extremely over the top action scenes. Make no mistake about it Shoot `Em Up features some of the most over the top action scenes ever captured on films. In the past I have written negative reviews on movies like this, but like I said in those reviews it's all about how it's done. Why does it work well in others and ruin other movies? I'm not quite sure, but these crazy and over the top action scenes work really well here at least for me and I was entertained from the start.

This movie totally lives up to it's name with action and more action; any lulls in the action sequences don't last long and while the plot for Shoot `Em Up is a little thin it's also good enough to make up for the breaks in the action. I'm a very harsh critic of the action genre these days. Since the Michael Bay era started action movies got worse and worse; it's gotten to the point to where I barley watch American action movies anymore. When done right like in Kill Bill and Rambo the action genre can still pack a punch, but more often than not they lack and I'm reminded why I don't bother with action flicks, but than Shoot `Em Up comes around and reminds why I love these movies.

The screenplay by Michael Davis is filled with silly dialogue all intentional of course and filled with some really crazy action scenes. But yet the script works well and the characters are excellent, which is also thanks to the actors selling it. The plot isn't that strong and mostly just a set up for the action, but Shoot `Em Up is a lot better written than I thought it would be. It's often funny and has some really cool characters.

Michael Davis also directs and the pace is always moving forward any lulls in the action scenes are brief. The action starts in the opening and each time out they're just as exciting as the last. Like I said the action sequences are really crazy and over the top, which can sometimes ruin a movie, but to the credit of Michael Davis he really makes it work well and makes it so much fun. I think Davis, makes one of the better action flicks of the decade. Michael Davis is able to craft one hell of a fun ride.

In the era of not only poor action movies we are also in an era of really poor action stars, while there are a couple of good ones, most of these so called action stars are pathetic, but where they all fail Clive Owen succeeds. Simply put Clive Owen has one of the coolest characters in recent memory and he totally sells it and makes for one of the top action stars in a long time. I think with more action flicks Clive Owen can really make a name for himself as one of the very best.

The supporting cast is excellent with Monica Bellucci has the talent to match her looks and Paul Giamatti just simply rocks. Despite starring in some Oscar nominated movies, which includes an Oscar, win for Giamatti, plus numerous awards nominations (and some wins) he really is such an underrated actor. Not enough people are talking about this guy and he is truly a talented actor and he rocks in Shoot `Em Up and works great with Clive Owen.

Bottom line is this; Shoot `Em Up is a crazy over the top movie and you'll either love it or hate it. I thought this one was a blast, but it's not for everyone.

The Blu-ray release is top notch with an excellent picture and even better sound. This is the perfect movie on Blu-ray. Features include a commentary track plus an excellent making of and trailers.",1232582400,4,3771,4.351851851851852
3000126,3,B000XA5K4I,"This movie was as absurd as I expected it to be.  I knew the plot would be silly, and that the action would be implausible.  All of this was OK by me, and for the most part this film delivered.  I liked it.

Strangely, the film-makers opted to make a stand on the issue of GUN CONTROL.  They like gun control...A LOT.  Even though the hero mows down legions of baddies with his trusty pistols (and vegetables), he too is staunchly pro-GUN CONTROL.  I won't give the story away, but he performs an act in the film with the express purpose of ensuring that strong gun control measures will be enacted.

Film-makers:  Just make the silly movie.  No need to preach to your audience.  Subtracted one star for the political content.",1230076800,2,726,4.465648854961832

3000132,1,B000XA5K4I,I watched this movie the other day with my friends and it feels like some very bad video game where one guy is invincible. The plot makes no sense and the blood and gore is overdone. It is basically about some British Agent that kills around 500 people by the end of the movie mainly by a Magnum. Too much sexual stuff; definitely not for under 17. Don't waste your time.,1225497600,7,371,4.23943661971831

3000134,5,B000XA5K4I,"""Shoot 'Em Up"" is a straight-faced over-the-top parody of the action movie genre.  Profoundly silly one-liners after shooting a guy?  Check.  No backstory about our cookie-cutter characters?  Got it.  An overly convoluted plot that makes no sense at all?  Yep.  The ability of the hero to run away from 10 guys shooting at him a close range?  Check.  And stunts that would kill a regular human being 10 times over, from which the hero walks away?  About every 5 minutes.

Where most action movies present these elements and expect us to swallow them, ""Shoot 'Em Up"" goes so far over the top that it flings those elements, and others, right in the audience's face as part of its bone-dry parody.  I think that's why this movie is so polarizing - whether you like this kind of thing is a matter of taste.  For example, whether you find a pro-gun-control gunfighting hero to be head-scratching or funny as heck will depend completely on your sense of humor.

For this film to work, Owen and Giamatti had to own their characters completely, as ridiculous as they were, and they definitely did so.  The pace has to keep moving so you don't stop and think about the details too much, and it certainly did.  At 90 minutes, this film is just long enough.

The irony is that ""Shoot 'Em Up,"" even as a parody of the genre, is a superior example of the genre.  It's at least worth a rent, particularly if you have Blu-Ray - the Blu-Ray transfer is fantastic.",1221436800,4,1447,4.542635658914729
3000135,4,B000XA5K4I,This is a stylized action-thriller with an improbable plot (much like Crank or The Transporter).  This movie starts out with action and doesn't let up until the end.  If you enjoy the low on plot high on entertainment value film genre then this is for you.  Paul Giamatti is a special treat with great lines throughout the movie and a memorable character.,1221264000,,355,4.693548387096774
3000136,4,B000XA5K4I,"The first time I watched this film I didn't like it very much. It held my interest, but I didn't care for the wafer-thin plot. And those are diet wafers. But I watched it again with the audio commentary by writer/director Michael Davis. He pointed out some of the elements that I had missed, and my interest picked up.

The jerry-rigged plot has Mr. Smith (ably portrayed by Clive Owen) injecting himself into a conspiracy to murder a very pregnant woman. Hordes of heavily armed bad guys are hunting her. Smith ends up caring for her newborn child. The movie becomes a series of gunfights in which some 130 (according to the commentary) bad guys fall to Smith's super-sharp shooting. The gun battles contain elements drawn from James Bond, Dirty Harry, Lethal Weapon, and the countless other flicks that feature a good guy who can shoot taking on legions of bad guys who can't. On top of this, Davis makes it all surreal by developing fantastic scenarios with a Rube Goldberg twist.

The stunning Monica Bellucci adds a certain ... warmth as she plays a lactating prostitute who really cares. She proves with Mr. Smith that people can attain a satisfying climax under the most trying conditions. Paul Giamatti is the heavy (Hertz) who reminds me of Orson Welles gone to seed.

There are some disgusting elements like a graphic depiction of what could happen when a gun falls into a filthy toilet and Hertz's ""interaction"" with a corpse.

In my opinion, if you take away a few disgusting scenes and tighten up the plot, this becomes a great movie.",1220745600,,1547,4.718518518518518

The over-the-top action is boring, the plot is convoluted, and the constant stabs at humor drop like a thud.  The usually dependable Clive Owen cannot even save this turkey.  He has to work overtime to stave off embarrassment.  But, then, Clive can pick and choose his own projects so you can't imagine what drew him to this one.  Paul Giamatti lays an egg as the film's heavy.  Be careful, Paul, or people will forget that you made good flicks like ""American Splendor"" and ""Sideways"".  Monica Bellucci as the requisite femme fatale is the only performer here to make a visceral impact.  The hilarious love-making scene between her and Owen is about the only time this film engaged me.  Otherwise, this flick is a complete waste of brain cells and not in the good way that some popcorn flicks are.",1220659200,,969,4.614035087719298

3000140,5,B000XA5K4I,"Shoot 'em Up is an over-the-top homage to 25+ years of action movies. Mr. Smith (Clive Owen) is a carrot-munching stranger who just happens to observe a pregnant woman being hunted down by a bunch of thugs.  He springs into action, killing the thugs and saving the baby, but losing the mom.  As is instantly apparent, Smith is no ordinary hero--he is a Special Ops killing machine who just happens to be at the wrong place at the right time.  The rest of the movie involves Smith trying to get the baby to safety and unravel the mystery of what is going on.  All the while he is pursued by the relentless & evil Mr. Hertz (Paul Giamatti), who, in Smith, has inexplicably found an adversary that matches him.

This movie is loads of fun, but is definitely not to be take seriously.  It somehow manages to glorify gun violence while preaching gun control.  To achieve this feat, the writers squeeze in every cliche imaginable (for example: not only was Smith's family murdered, he unknowingly sold the guns to the man who killed them).  Despite the cartoonish nature of the violence (especially Mr. Smith's lethal skills), both Owen and Giamatti are great in their roles and some of the lines they deliver are instant classics.  Giamatti is surprisingly effective as the hen-pecked bad guy, a welcome turn from his traditional roles.  All in all, a great movie to watch if you're willing to stop thinking for 90 minutes or so.  Its also a great advertisement for the benefits of eating carrots (which I've started doing).",1220227200,4,1519,4.694339622641509
3000141,3,B000XA5K4I,"It contains OUTRAGEOUSLY UNBELIEVABLE ACTION SCENES. For example in one scene, Clive Owen shot his hand gun continously with a carrot pressed down on the trigger!

3000143,2,B000XA5K4I,"What is it with Clive Owen and his choice of films to do? He was great in The Croupier and interesting as an assassin the first Bourne film, but here and in several other films (I'll Sleep When I'm Dead) he just isn't believable as a dumb, sadistic, violent guy--he's too smart to play that.

Here in Shoot em Up his character has no back story; his action scenes are fine but too unbelievable to be more than 'cartoonish', and his gorgeous love interest (Monic Bellucci) seems way too smart to be with such a simple 'thug'.

Add to the continuous action a bad guy (Paul Giamatti) who also seems unbelievable and you've got a mindless waste of time. And one more thing; this movie has a scene of nudity that is really disgusting and should have been cut--and I'm not speaking of any scene involving Monica Bellucci.",1218758400,2,815,4.5
3000144,3,B000XA5K4I,"A no brainer action movie if taken as that is fun to watch. I would have given it three and a half stars if I could have since I enjoyed it more than ""Chaos"". I have certainly seen far worse action movies. Afterall this one doesn't take itself seriously and that gives it a leg up over those that do. Clive Owen as always is quite entertaining. How he eliminates a couple enemies with carrots not to mention some of the shooting stunts should impress and amuse you. This may not have the depth of ""Inside Man"", but it was not meant to either. It was meant to be fun plain and simple. The story centers around our hero trying to save a pregnant woman. He manages to save her long enough to have her baby but then he can only save the baby from the government and criminal types so intent on their death. The mystery he unravels as to why has some depth of thought. This is a fast paced movie and most fans of action movies should enjoy it. Good quality DVD with fair replayability. If you enjoyed this catch ""Kill Bill"" and ""Hitman"".

3000145,4,B000XA5K4I,"I'm the first to admit that this movie isn't for everyone.  You can tell from the reviews here how polarized the viewing audience is.  For what it's worth, if this movie appeals to you, you will enjoy it immensely.  If not, you'll hate it.  There's not a lot of middle ground.

The movie is ultra-violent, yes, but in a cartoon violence way (if Bugs Bunny were R-rated that is)  It's over-the-top, extreme, and comical.  Yes, comical.  Some of the kills are outright silly and laughable.  That's what defines this movie.

The action is incredibly well choreographed.  The scene involving the stairwell is just simply the most amazing action scene I think I've ever seen in a movie.

Will you like the movie?  I don't know.  But give it a try.  You might despise it, and that would be understandable.  I hated Sin City but love this, so go figure.  I recognize the artistry behind it but don't actually like the movie.  For Shoot 'Em Up, I loved both.

At the very least, even if you hate the movie, find the scene where Clive Owen is complaining about another driver not using his turn signal.  That scene is laugh out loud funny and well worth seeking out in the movie!",1218412800,,1170,4.507177033492823

Folks, the price is right for a copy of the DVD (which I'm purchasing - tonight!)  Get yourself a copy, don't take it too seriously and you'll have a good time.

Oh, yes...my critique on the actors in this movie:

1. Clive Owen - Given what he had to work with - he does a good job!
2. Paul Giamati - An outstanding (and intelligent) bad guy - he's always thinking - just try to keep up with him...
3. Monica Bellucci - She only does a few scenes, but oh, boy!  She's still looking outstanding after all these years.  Hopefully, she'll receive more offers to do American features (America - you have no idea what you are missing!  Yes, I am a Bellucci Fan...)

See this film for its brilliant action sequences, extremely satisfying send-up of the whole shoot-em-up category, and delightful acting by all the major performers.  Clive Owen was already one of my favorites, but his brooding, angry, carrot-obsessed marksmanship in this film puts him over the top.

- Many people tend to ignore how much creativity is involved making each scene loaded with tons of interesting ways to shoot the bad guys.  Seriously, watch carefully every single shooting segment in this movie, and try telling me it's not the most creative and interesting way to make a shooter.

Gratuitous violence and lots of bullets - this is shot by Crouching Tiger alumni Peter Pau - and dourly acted by the capable Clive Owen.  The other reason to watch this modern film noir cum comic movie is Italian Goddess Monica Bellucci, who amazingly, plays a hooker with a heart of gold - yet again! (the third movie I've seen of her in this role).  Clive Owen doesn't have a real sense of humour though - he often reminds me of Timothy Dalton doing James Bond: serious and all business, without a hint of irony - a bloke's bloke.

3000155,3,B000XA5K4I,"The Good Things
*Despite being unbelievable and incredibly over-the-top, there are plenty of fun, zany action scenes that entertain.  Plenty of bloody violence (for those who like bloody violence).
*It's also not entirely brutal and bloody.  There is some compassion and romance to it as well (after all, this whole thing is about a guy protecting a baby from harm).
*Filming style is pretty good.  It's a little rough and gritty, but not overwhelmingly jittery or anything.
*Acting is great.  Clive Owen is entirely memorable.  Monica Bellucci is awesome.
*Some fun dialogue.
*Great music.

The Bad Things
*Weak story, with lots of strange, contrived twists.

The Questionable Things
*As said above, it's unbelievable and over-the-top.  It can either be seen as stylish and fun, or stupid.
*A bit vulgar.  Expect some swearing, lots of bloody violence, and some strange sexuality.

It's brainless, tasteless, and highly unbelievable.  At the same time, it's stylish, cool, and entertaining.  Like some kind of cartoon, this is a good simple movie to put in and enjoy for action fans who don't want to think excessively or worry about realism.

Within 5 minutes someone is stabbed in the eye with a carrot, which shocked me because I had never seen it before.

Ah, what to say, what to say....this is one of those mindless action movies full of death and destruction, where the guns have many more bullets than logically possible, the hero is -- heroic, the leading lady is a knockout (kudos to whomever is responsible for hiring Monica Bellucci in this roll. It was refreshing to see an incredibly gorgeous woman over the age of 40 and she was terrific in it) and the main villian, Paul Giamatti, is very good.

In fact, I was truly amazed in the calibre of acting in this type of movie. Like Star Troopers of yore, none of the bad guys -- and there are hundreds -- can shoot worth a darn, while the good guy fells them right and left...and back and forth.. and so on. Can we just agree there is a LOT of violence in this thing.  A ragged story line exists, but is slapped around by the shear amount of action, not to mention the almost psychic ability of Giamatti in finding Owen and Bellucci every few minutes no matter where they run.

This is a popcorn and friends type movie. I wouldn't recommend it for the kiddies by any means, but if you're into truly unbelievable action, then you might have some fun with this one.

Yes. Is it kind of a symbol of everything that's wrong with our society? You bet. It's also ridiculously entertaining. People get killed with vegetables! Clive Owen delivers a baby and then severs the umbilical cord with a pistol shot! People jump out of planes and get chopped up by helicopter blades! Paul Giamatti gets shot - and then gets shot again - and then gets shot again - and doesn't die! Monica Bellucci gets naked! (My husband liked that part the best, obviously).

The amazing thing to me was that three talented people who have all done serious dramatic work really threw themselves into their roles and gave the movie everything they had - especially Clive Owen. His one-liners make the movie and his deadpan humor adds a lot of entertainment value. The other great thing about this movie is that it knows exactly how over-the-top it is. Jackie Chan has been getting laughs off totally implausible stunts for forever - why does he get a patent on that kind of entertainment? I honestly laughed harder at this movie, and enjoyed it more, than anything else I've seen in a long time. This movie is a great antidote to all the dumb movies out there that take themselves way, WAY too seriously. This is not the movie for anyone who even mildly squeamish - has even a mild problem with violence - or is uncomfortable with graphic sex. Also probably not recommended for lovers of all things highbrow.

This is one of the funniest satires I have ever seen. Hands down.

""Shoot 'Em Up"" does not have in depth characters, it IS SUPPOSED TO BE misogynistic, and if you try to take it seriously for one second..... you're going to hate it. Watch this film when you need a good laugh. The dialog is hysterical. Every scene from start to finish is completely ""Over the Top"", but still executed with big budget precision.

Get over it, pansies!

This is not ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" ""Dr. Strangelove,"" ""The Bicycle Thief,"" or ""Casabalanca"" (all admittedly fantastic movies, all five-star classics, and I love them all dearly).

It is a fun time for those who have a working sense of wit--NOT humor, because any lowborn mutt has a sense of humor, but of actual wit--and who, say, likes an action movie populated with people as opposed to robots that turn into cars. (Seriously, if you like ""Transformers"" and didn't like this, you're a moron, and there's no argument brooked about it.)

Furthermore, it does have certain Western-movie overtones that reminded me of something Vladimir Nabokov wrote about Hollywood films: to the effect that in American Westerns, you can see hundreds of people get shot, but ""you're not sorry! You're not sorry for any one of them!"" This is how ""Shoot 'Em Up"" proceeds: most of those who get shot and killed richly, RICHLY deserve to be sent to the next life or, as I would tend to believe, to oblivion. And this is from an avid opponent of the government death penalty.

Furthermore, it is the first film, in my memory, that effectively used the classic Motorhead track ""Ace of Spades"" in a gunfight sequence. Neither Tarantino nor Rodriguez was THAT clever and smart about music.",1208649600,,1379,4.801687763713081

Just by the LOOK of the cover art, this couldn't have been anything else!

All the principles played their parts to the hilt! Clive Owen, it seems, came from the Steve McQueen school of acting. Monica Belucci is as gorgeous as ever, and Paul Giamatti played Owens' foil perfectly! The guns. MY GAAWWD! The guns were all over the place (I bet the Anti-Gunners were beside themselves), and the carrots. I'll bet Owen never wants to see another carrot for the rest of his life!

This movie is so over the top, so fun, so action packed that I've been telling all my friends that they just have to check this one out.

3000185,4,B000XA5K4I,"""Shoot 'Em Up"" ranks up there with ""Crank"" in the terms of style over substance.  The difference between the two is that ""Shoot 'Em Up's"" style IS the substance.

The film opens up with Clive Owen getting in the middle of a gunfight between a pregnant woman and some bad guys.  From there, it just takes off into a violent, well, shoot em up film, full of stylistic gun fights culled from the likes of John Woo and probably owes more than a good share to the Hong Kong action film scene, complete with fun one-liners and rather unusual uses for carrots.

Just don't expect much of a plot.  There is one, but it plays secondary to the way this film is shot.  The film seems based on a sort of gag or rather oddball situation: a very well trained fighter good with guns is trying to protect a baby.  The violence and gunplay throughout the film is like watching a very wicked cartoon.

Clive Owen's character does all sorts of fun stuff.  This is why you're watching the movie.  The favorie of the film makers seems to be Owen sliding through many scenes while shooting his assailants.  This includes sliding through across the floor, under bathroom stalls,and oh from out of a car into a van.

Owen's character is the fun sorta anti hero.  He's something of a drifter.  We don't have much of his history.  We just know he has a penchant for carrots, is really good with guns, and has some rather colorful connections, including Monica Belluici as a prostitute.

The film is not about the plot.  In fact, we don't really learn the nature of the story until about halfway through, and even then, we are given a couple of lines to clue us in to what's going on.  This film is about action.  It has the kinetic energy of a video game.  The humor is offbeat and a little dark.  It's not your regular action movie.  Perhaps the irony in the end is that the film seems to have an anti gun message.  But without them saying it overtly, you couldn't tell throughout the 90 minute duration.

I may not have it exact right; it's been a few weeks since I saw this film, but... (SPOILER) It's basically about the last surviving baby from a baby mill whose existence is solely to serve as transplant material to save a wealth and (soon to be) powerful politician.  Then there's the evil gun manufacturer and his hired guns (Giamatti & Co.) who are trying to see that this doesn't happen because of the politician's gun control policy.

Well that's what I'm doing now because this is one of those movies.  This movie (as most do) caught my eye with it's preview.  Good action ala John Woo style.  I love action movies as much as any other guy.  Back in the 80's I remember a ton by: Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Norris & Seagal.  They were ""over the top"" and at times ""unrealistic"" but in the end they were still entertaining and a good time.  Take the unrealistic nature of any of those movies and multiply it by 10.  Many scenes in ""Shoot em' Up"" are so unrealistic you will be on the floor laughing it's so bad.  Clive Owen's a great actor but he doesn't have a prayer in saving this bomb.  One scene Clive takes out literally about 50 men that enter a room like an assembly line.  Which if it stopped their would be fine.  But no, he does it while still engaging the female lead in the bedroom?  And if that's not enough she still remains excited during the process!  Or a scene where Owen shoots at a merry-go-round multiple times to get it to spin so a sniper can't get a bead on the baby he just placed their?  Or many scenes where Owen is running, rolling, flipping and smashing through windows which is fine.  But Owen does it while holding a baby like a football.  And of course the baby is always fine afterwards.  Who wrote this movie a 15 year old boy?!  Another area where this movie falls flat is character development.  It's total action from beginning to end.  Which may sound good but you really don't get a chance to know the characters.  Which after a while you can basically care less about them or what happens.  Save an hour and a half of your life and skip this one.  Then again if you want to see how bad something can be check it out?",1202947200,10,1839,4.218390804597701

Clive Owens now has won me over as a 007 candidate. Giamatti is deliciously repulsive and Monica Bellucci is just delicious. The underlying plot involving gun control is sweet irony to the fact that the action is a gun-lover's wet dream. Unlike Smokin' Aces, this movie understands its mood and tone and stays true to it. There is one little tweak I wish I could do to this film: change the murky explanation of Owen's man with no name from an expatriate gunmaker's son to a murky explanation of a British agent who lost his wife in a drive-by shooting. Then Shoot 'em Up becomes an unofficial sequel to On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Clive even bears a resemblance to Lazenby, fer cryin' out loud!",1202774400,,828,4.7172413793103445

3000200,3,B000XA5K4I,"This movie wastes no time letting you think about plots or characters or any of that `Structure' that many movies drag out for 10 or fifteen minutes in order to establish character or some other thing they might teach you in film schools.  Nope, this one goes right for the throat.

From the moment Clive Owen plunges a carrot into a bad guys eye and kills him (and this happens within the first five minutes) you know this movie is going to require a major suspension of disbelief.  But with that out of the way, you can enjoy the most outrageous action movie ever put on film.  Owen plays a homeless former Black Ops soldier who just stumbles on an assassination conspiracy dealing with small children being born for the use of their blood and bone marrow.  I won't bore with the details but it does get complicated.  In short, he's on the run with a baby in his hands.  Obviously this guy has a conscious and a temper.

Paul Giamatti plays the hitman who's trying to see the job through to the end until his men start getting killed off by this stranger who seems to be able to kill everyone who tries to kill him.  Owen then tries to pawn off the baby on Hooker/Wet Nurse played by the ever-beautiful Italian Actress Monica Bellucci.  The two end up running together, saving the baby and beating the bad guys.

Now, you probably figured this might just be an over the top (yeah, it's way over the top) action flick.  But an obvious statement starts to form as the movie goes on.  Owen's character is the victim of loosing his wife and child to some gunman who walked into a restaurant one day and just started blowing people away.  He later finds out he is indirectly responsible.  His character is the son of an English gunsmith who moved to the US when The British got strict with their gun laws.  He grew up with guns, was a very good marksman and was then recruited by the US Army.

Worse yet, the democratic Senator who is running for President has a major gun control bill in the works.  The bad guys seem to be a representation of the NRA and the good guy doesn't carry a gun...he just uses whatever is in reach most of the time.  Now, I might be going out on a limb but it seems the movie turns into a big anti-gun statement.  Am I wrong?  Possibly, you'll have to watch for yourself and see.

The movie is definitely entertaining and very funny at times.  All three major actors do a great job, especially Giamantti and Owen.  There really isn't enough seen of Bellucci, especially during a love making/shoot out scene (so outrageous) but could there ever be enough of her?",1202688000,,2586,4.4071729957805905

Odds are that if you watched Arnold, Stallone, and Bruce Willis blow stuff up in the late 80s and early 90s, you were right.  That is, you were right until Clive Owen, Paul Giamatti, and director Michael Davis got together and decided to make this movie.  The basic plot is pretty straightforward: Owen plays a drifter who happens to have one mean sense of moral outrage and a special knack with firearms of all makes and calibers.  He's minding his own business late one evening until some random pregnant woman stumbles by with a random bad guy in a random 70s Camaro hot on her tail.  Concluding that someone is up to no good, Owen decides to follow the woman--with only a raw carrot for a weapon, mind you--and rescue the poor maiden.  Random violence ensues while Owen proceeds to shoot at least one bad guy a minute for the next hour and a half while protecting the infant from an army of thugs larger than the population of lower Manhattan--all led by Paul Giamatti as a hen-pecked, cold-blooded assassin.  It's Children of Men with a sense of humor.

The violence is graphic and gratuitous, so Shoot 'Em Up is not for the squeemish.  But, neither is it the kind of torture porn that has become so popular with kids and the makers of horror movies.  Instead of the Saw series, think Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam.

3000229,2,B000XA5K4I,"Some movies you just can't seem to understand why you bother watching them. There are just certain movies that are kind of like train wrecks, you know that the outcome will no doubt be disastrous, yet you can't help but watch as the movie reaches its inevitable conclusion. It's these types of films that have earned the title 'Guilty Pleasures', because no matter how hard you try there's just no explaining why you're watching the film, because there isn't much of anything to merit your attention, but there you sit, like a goober, watching a movie that you know will end up being a waste of time. A recent example of this is the 2007 brainless, action movie ""Shoot 'Em Up"" starring Clive Owen (""King Arthur""), Monica Bellucci (""The Matrix Reloaded""), and Paul Giamatti (""Cinderella Man"").

""Shoot 'Em Up"" is about a man named Smith (Clive Owen) who, out of sheer coincidence, happens to be in the right place at the right time as a man is attempting to kill a pregnant woman just before she is about to give birth. Smith follows the man, proceeding to intervene before the murder takes place, after dispatching the killer and assisting the woman in childbirth, Smith finds himself in yet another fight between the would be killer's former cohorts, led by a man named Hertz (Paul Giamatti). After escaping from the fight, Smith finds himself the surrogate father to the newborn baby after the mother is caught in the crossfire. Now, Smith is on the run with a baby in tow from a maniacal mad man, and his only assistance is a prostitute (Monica Bellucci) with the proverbial heart of gold.

Writer/director Michael Davis has managed to take a bunch of over-the-top, overblown action sequences strung them together with one of the weakest storylines I've seen in a feature film (even some of Steven Seagal's Direct-to-DVD films have better plots), assembled a fairly strong cast (each of whom should really have known better than to do this movie, but you know the saying, ""Money talks.""), and somehow convinced New Line Cinema that this was a viable property worthy of theatrical release. Kudos for the effort Mr. Davis, I don't know how you did it but the fact that this movie ever made it to theaters is beyond me, this movie's script had DVD bargain bin written all over it! I will give ""Shoot 'Em Up"" and its writer/director Michael Davis this, the action sequences may be over-the-top in every sense, but they are mostly a lot of fun to watch, although by the end of the movie I found myself tired of the endless barrage of gunfire that had permeated almost every scene in the film. If nothing else, these stylistic, fast-paced gun battles is probably what kept my attention in this film, because it sure wasn't the story which wasn't made clear until approximately 15 to 20 minutes from the end of the film.

For an action movie to succeed with audiences it must of course contain plenty of high octane, energetic action sequences to keep the adrenaline junkies going, but it must also have some semblance of a storyline tying the fight scenes together to give the movie some sense of purpose otherwise we're just watching a bunch of meaningless fights that don't have any point behind them and that gets boring really quickly. But, when a movie's story isn't made clear to the audience until about 20 minutes from the end of the movie, then I think the writer has made a horrible mistake and is lucky the audience has made it with them this far into the film. In the case of ""Shoot 'Em Up"" writer/director Michael Davis was fortunate that he had crafted such creative and fun gunfights to keep my attention, plus the fact that I like the cast helped him out quite a bit, because without those key components I would have ditched this movie long before the basic plot was revealed and would have felt that I hadn't missed much of anything. A little advice for Michael Davis, if you intend to keep the audience on board with you for this kind of movie, it would probably be a smart idea to give a little bit more of the story away throughout the entire duration of the film, not just waiting for the end to explain everything like its some massive secret that would change the entire movie experience.

The cast that was assembled for this film, led by Clive Owen, Monica Bellucci, and Paul Giamatti, were of a much higher caliber than I would have expected in such an inferior piece of so-called ""entertainment"". Even though the story was lacking in almost every way, the actors managed to do a decent job of creating characters the audience could become interested in, even if their story arcs were essentially non-existent. I must say Paul Giamatti was actually a surprise as the villain in the film, I never thought that he could handle playing the main villain in such a movie, but the over-the-top performance he gave as Hertz fit right in with the rest of the movie's tone, and was actually one of the best things about the entire film.

If nothing else can be said for ""Shoot 'Em Up"", it at least lives up to its name, this film is essentially nothing but one gun battle after another and before long all the style and quick camera cuts in the world can't help these scenes from looking the same and leaving the audience bored. I believe that even die hard action fans that love to see nothing but non-stop action will be hard pressed to actually enjoy this movie all that much, because by the time the movie is almost over you'll probably find yourself hating the constant barrage of gunfights and wishing for a little drama to fill up some time.

In fact, it was no surprise to hear that the script was written around a lot of preconceived action [...]. That fact certainly didn't make Shoot 'Em Up a bad movie; it was actually pretty good. But it did come across as a plethora of spectacular stunts that just needed a halfway decent story to get produced as a movie.

The stunts are spectacular. They go nicely with the 100% deliberate hokeyness of the film. A black comedy to some...a kind-of comic book/animation come to life to others. The death defying feats are way over the top, but again, it's all intentional on the part of Writer/Director Michael Davis.

Clive Owen, who's really made a name for himself lately (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sin-City/dp/B000BCKFWK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sin City</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Children-of-Men/dp/B000N6TX1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Children of Men</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inside-Man/dp/B000GFLKF8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inside Man</a>), does a fabulous job as leading man in Shoot ""Em Up. And Paul Giamatti, in his one billionth role I think, is as fun to watch as ever.

Owen is the carrot-eating good guy and Giamatti is the bad guy. Owen by chance inserts himself a political conspiracy that is run by Giamatti, and the result is a fast-past, surreal, action-packed...well...Shoot 'Em Up.

I was thoroughly entertained, but found myself saying out loud, ""oh, yeah, right"" over and over throughout the movie. So if you don't mind a little over the top silliness with your action, Shoot 'Em Up is right up your alley.",1200268800,13,1876,5.807272727272728

3000234,3,B000XA5K4I,"Here we have the mysterious hero. We know little for certain of his past, aside from the observations of his enemies. We don't even know his real name, like the characters in the spaghetti westerns that starred Clint Eastwood. He is a super-killer who no one appears to be able to stop. I will grant that most of the action scenes are so farfetched that there would be no way they could happen in Real Life. But, this isn't real, it's only a movie and it's a pretty exciting film from start to finish.

Without giving too much away, this film has a continueing fetish with carrots. Not often does a vegetable have such a prominent role in a movie.

The choice of villain, played by Paul Giamatti, was excellent. Here we have the perfect adversary for the apparently unstoppable hero. He is so intelligent and so vicious, that there is every possibility that he could defeat our hero simply by guessing his next move, which he does on several occasions.

The female lead, played by Donna Quintano, is a very shallow character and little is done to flesh-out (so to speak) her character. The one and only sex scene in the film is completely ridiculous, which goes right along with the action scenes anyway. Quintano's portrayal of lactating escort Monica Bellucci is wooden, at times.

For an action-packed film, this is a good choice. If you want character development, pick something else. Personally, I had a lot of fun watching it.",1200182400,,1433,4.674603174603175

This is combined with a pretty strong guns-are-bad theme.  It's not just an argument against violence, it's an argument against the 2nd Amendment, which is mentioned specifically.

Hypocritically, the Good Guy makes use of hundreds of bullets (and a few carrots) to defeat the evil government conspiracy to allow people to have guns.

Ironically, the Good Guy makes a pretty firm statement that hypocrisy is one of the things he hates.

And if that's not quite enough garbage for you, the writer of this multi-million-dollar production can't control his leftist impulse to include a message about not trusting people who stand to make money.

If you can shut your brain off completely while watching movies, which I can handle sometimes, this is fun to watch.  But it really pushes the limits of ignoring stupidity to have a good time.",1200096000,3,981,4.939024390243903
3000239,3,B000XA5K4I,"In ""Bully for Bugs,"" Bugs Bunny, once again making that ""wrong turn at Albuquerque,"" finds himself a spectator inside a bullring, where a magnificent bull is making short work of an overmatched toreador. Bugs is minding his own business -admittedly in the wrong place at the wrong time - ""What's up, Doc?"" - when the not amused bull bucks Bugs out of the arena and into the stratosphere.  As Bugs, tail jacked up, is propelled toward the heavens, he turns to the camera and declares with an annoyed smirk, ""Of course you know, this means war!""  There ensues an outlandish, over the top, war of wits between Bugs and the bull fought with such implements as an anvil, a slingshot, a rifle, elephant bullets, axle grease, and a crude Rube Goldberg device that employs TNT.

""Shoot `Em Up,"" the Michael Davis directed movie starring Clive Owen, Paul Giamatti and Monica Bellucci is like an 86 minute live action version of that classic 1953 cartoon short.  The movie opens on a extreme close-up of our hero ""Smith"" (Clive Owen) taking a deliberate bite out of long stemmed carrot.  Taciturn Smith is our Bugs and he has definitely taken a wrong turn somewhere, although it may not have been Albuquerque .

Full of righteous indignation, Smith hates everything.  He hates ""40-year old jack-holes wearing ponytails,"" as he informs us before blowing the back of head off of a 40-year old jack-hole wearing a ponytail.  He hates privileged yuppies who park in handicap spaces we learn before he smashes the driver's side window of an illegally parked Mercedes before stealing it.  And he hates guys changing lanes without signaling, as we discover when he forces said guy off the road causing him to smash into a parked car.

Paul Giamatti, more bully than bull, is the malevolent Elmer Fudd of this piece.  Giamatti takes delicious delight in his devilishness.

Once Owen and Giamatti have engaged in ""Of course you know, this means war!"" one-upmanship, ""Shoot ""Em Up"" devolves into one spectacularly choreographed scene of mythic mayhem after another.  In fact, ""Shoot `Em Up"" is so jacked up on a Red Bull high of Testosterone injected vitriol, that you can seldom catch your breath let alone make heads or tails of what is going on.  Until about three-quarters in, the movie moves so fast, you are just jerked along, unable to make any of the human connections you would need to make in order to care.

Of course, the movie uses the stock device that has informed movies from their infancy: the imperiled infant.  Not since ""Raising Arizona"" has such a sweet countenanced kid been put in such stark danger.  Except, "" Arizona "" being a comedy, you knew nothing was going to happen to Junior.  In ""Shoot `Em Up"" all bets are off.

The plot of ""Shoot `Em Up"" is almost as cartoonish as the action.  There is so much ammunition dispersed in this movie, with the guns and gunplay erotized to a level nothing human approach in this movie, it is almost laughable that a gun control initiative is at the heart of its overblown action.  Like watching a porn movie about abstinence, this is kind of a turn-off.

That said, the adrenaline rush of ""Shoot `Em Up"" should not be missed.  I recommend turning on the subtitles (some of the best throw-away lines may be missed if you don't) and watching it as a live action comic book.  Then watching it again.",1200009600,4,3340,4.709122203098107

The plot is..well, that's incidental.  What matters in this movie is that bullets are constantly flying and the body count is constantly rising.  If the movie seems silly and overblown it's supposed to be.  This is pretty much a parody of one of those silly action movies you might have seen Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzenneger back in the eighties and nineties.  I realize this movie probably won't be for everyone (including those who don't like characters with necrophilia tendencies) but for those who just want to put there brain on hold for a little while you will probably have fun.

If you are looking for a great movie that continues to entertain throughout the entire film, this is the movie you should get.

In fact Owen delivers the baby at the same time he's in a shootout with about two or three dozen thugs.

3000248,4,B000XA5K4I,"I rented this film with low expectations. A friend of mine said that it was stupid so I saw this with an open mind. ""Shoot `Em Up"" is a movie with a title that speaks for itself. Sorry, Dee-Nut, I will have to disagree with you with this movie. True, the film is so ridiculously unreal but boy, it sure is a lot of fun to watch! Action and gunplay is all you're in for with this film.

A man named Smith (Clive Owen) with a sordid past is in a bus stop one evening. He spies a pregnant woman being pursued by bad guys led by Hertz (Paul Giamatti) and decides to get involved. What results is a fast-paced action packed shoot `em up from start to finish....

Such a short description of the plot details, isn't it? Actually, there is a plot, it just gets broken down throughout the proceedings. While I do not want to go through the details, I will just describe it by going through its themes: a Baby for the rescuing, a beautiful hooker (Monica Belucci), an eccentric bad guy, a politician mixed in and an anti-hero with an unknown past. The rest is non-stop hyper-kinetic action. Writer and director Michael Davis knew what he wanted to do when he made this film. A slam-bang, hard-boiled cool stylish action flick that is stripped down much of anything else such as intricate storytelling and character development. This is a very gutsy move on his part. Critical eyes (Hey, I am a nit-picker myself) may argue that the lack of plot is its downfall and while it is, the director sure knew where he was headed. Sometimes, audiences just want action and ""Shoot `Em Up"" does deliver!

The style of the film is a bit hard to breakdown. Let's see, I did catch hints of the atmosphere of another comic book inspired film ""Sin City"" (in color), Hong Kong ""Bullet Ballet"" and Japanese ""Pistol Opera"", the sly humor and grittiness of ""Reservoir Dogs"", the outrageous silliness of ""Planet Terror"" and the over-the-top attitude of Luc Besson films. I believe the director really wanted to overload our senses with a lot of adrenaline-driven action sequences so the weaknesses of the film will not reach our brains. This film is pure action ""junk"" with one goal; to entertain its viewer.

With a movie with almost no plot and character depth, it is important that the lead actor fits the role otherwise the movie will be a farce. Thankfully, Clive Owen manages to convincingly pull off his anti-hero role with dynamic charisma that complements the screenplay. It is also fortunate that Owen is supported by the great performance of Paul Giamatti who plays the lead villain; Hertz and mega babe Monicca Belucci sure is very pleasing to the eyes as Donna. aLSO, IT WAS VERY AMUSING that the film-makers opted for carrots instead of the stereotypical cigarettes or toothpicks to signify the hero's ""coolness"".

""SHOOT `EM UP"" is geared towards the male audience with its unrealistic, ridiculously over the top action sequences, but I am sure the female audience will be swooned with Owen's charismatic appeal. While its main weakness is the unreal comic book approach, it is also its greatest strength. I have to commend the director in knowing exactly what he was ""aiming"" for. I've read that Baby Oliver was cast in the role before he was born, a woman carrying twins was selected. If that didn't exhibit commitment to his art, then I'm not sure what else. I admire directors who know which direction they want to go. The film plays almost like a stunt performance but hey, I am not complaining.

Ultimately, ""Shoot `Em Up"" is a fun and entertaining experience. Ridiculous, unrealistic and maybe even cartoonish; but one thing it sure isn't is boring. The film is a lot of FUN.

RECOMMENDED! For fans of ""Bullet Ballet"" and ""Pistol Opera"" [3  Stars]

3000249,1,B000XA5K4I,"*Warning* This review has a few spoilers (if you can call them that). This is THE worst movie I have ever seen. It tops Transporter 2 on my list of movies I wish I hadn't wasted 30 min watching. I bought this movie thinking that Clive Owen and Paul Giamatti, two of todays best actors, could not possibly do me wrong. They did. They owe me 20 bucks and an apology. They've also lost me as a fan. If they read the script (if there was one) before agreeing to make this movie and still decided to make this movie, then they aren't my type of actors. This movie had no chance. Here are a few reasons why this movie was bad:

1. All of the ""bad guys"" are stupid. They all fire full clips and hit nothing. While Clive Owen is taking cover, they stand and wait to be shot.
2. Clive Owens' character never misses, never. He is Robin Hood with a gun. He doesn't even need a gun to kill people with bullets. If you really want to waste 2 hours of your life to find out what this means, I feel for you.
3. Every one liner used in this movie makes you cringe. If overly simple quotes like ""So much for seatbelts"" is funny to you, then forget I said anything.
4. *Spoiler* The stunts are absolutely ridiculous and impossible for anyone to actually do. For example, a car and a van racing at each other head on at 60+ mph (guestimate), hit each other head on. This propels Clive Owen through his windshield, through the vans windshield, into the back of the van, where he kills everyone when inside. If you would like to know what happens next, see reason 3.
5. Mindless. Some people don't like new, fresh, or creative ideas in movies, but I do. And this movie has none of these. This is a B- movie with A list actors.

If you couldn't already tell, this movie is horrible. Bad acting, impossible stunts, mind-numbing one-liners, and a horrible plot. Take this as a warning, and rent the movie if you really must see it. I unfortunately bought it then gave it away the next day as a joke on a friend. Wait and see...

3000253,2,B000XA5K4I,"I have to start by being fair in that this movie claims to be a shoot-em-up, and in that category it succeeds. However, in every other category it fails miserably. Don't get me wrong, it has it all...the disenchanted former special ops guy, the damsel in distress, the evil but smart bad-guy, the government/corporation conspiracy, etc.  Unfortunately, everything is poorly executed and quite frankly, the writers simply did not try that hard to make a believable plot, or characters you could care about. What's worse is that the movie's core concept is to be a sinfully over-done shoot-em-up, but it fails in that respect as well.  The gun-battles are a been-there, done-that (10 years ago) affair. Finally, the acting is only sub-par.  Clive own does a respectable job with a terrible script and character, while Monica Bellucci is in such a role that no acting could save (and her acting was on par with a B movie actor anyway.)  The only notable performance comes from the films villain, who only barely succeeds in garnering extra notice.

3000255,5,B000XA5K4I,"It might be tough for me to explain why I so loved this film, but I'll give it a go anyway.

After recently watching and reviewing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Kingdom/dp/B000Y7WGOW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Kingdom</a>, I explained that I wasn't one of those movie critics who enjoyed action over plot (with a few exceptions, of course). And this is why I fell head-over-heels for SHOOT `EM UP. It is precisely an action over plot film. But wait! Let me explain! It's that and quite a bit more.

What Shoot `em up does is take that style of action and put it into absolutely ludicrous proportions. And in doing so it makes great fun of itself and all those action films that've come before. From the gun-loving and reluctant dark hero, to the hooker with a heart of gold, Shoot `em up takes these themes to far out extremes and makes for some of the funniest scenes you'll ever see.

Let me give you an example: In one scene Mr. Smith (Clive Owen,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Children-of-Men/dp/B000N6TX1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Children of Men</a>), our dark hero, escapes with a newborn baby  from some bad guys and runs into a very filthy bathroom. He promptly jumps into a stall and up onto the toilet so that anyone entering won't be able to see his feet below the stall door. But, while juggling the baby and his most beloved handgun, he drops the pistol into the toilet. Thinking quickly, he puts the baby down on the disgusting floor, fishes his gun from the toilet bowl, heads over to the baby changing station on the wall, and begins lovingly cleaning his weapon while the baby gurgles happily from the heavily soiled floor.

If you don't like this kind of humor then, please, stay away from this movie.

This is quite a departure from previous Clive Owen films that I've seen. Being more of the ""serious"" actor, it was nice to see him in something so ridiculously funny and out of (what I thought to be) character for him.

The other surprise was the estimable Paul Giamatti (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lady-in-the-Water/dp/B000JLTR8Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lady in the Water</a>) as a hitman out to kill the mother of the baby that Owen's character initially saves. Not only does Hertz (Giamatti) want the woman dead, but also her child. But when an unsuspecting tough guy named Mr. Smith (Owens) inadvertently gets involved in his ""business"", Giamatti's character gets much more than he bargained for. This was quite a change of pace for Giamatti who tends to play quieter characters. Here in Shoot `em up he's a loud sociopath with a penchant for killing. He's also hysterically funny as he tries to kill the baby and now Mr. Smith all while juggling a demanding wife who continually calls him on the phone at the most inopportune times (""Honey. I'm busy right now. I'll have to call you back."")

Donna Quintano (Monica Bellucci) plays the hooker with a heart of gold role after Mr. Smith (Owens) comes to her for assistance with the baby. Donna recently lost her own child and Mr. Smith knows that having a new baby around will help her ...as well as himself. But her morales aren't very well grounded. When they run out of money to buy bullets, Donna tries to help by utilizing her prostitute skills near a dumpster ...much to the chagrin of Mr. Smith.

Plot-wise, it doesn't make much sense. There's a series of scenes devoted to why Giamatti's character is trying to kill the baby (politics, advanced medicine, presidential candidates, etc.) but it doesn't make much difference. It is the outlandish antics of Mr. Smith and his over-the-top James Bond-ish shooting abilities that make this film what it is. And you'll howl with laughter as the bullets fly, the targets get hit with impossible accuracy, the prostitute and the tough guy fall for each other, all while this newborn takes a wild ride.",1199664000,4,3970,5.10477657935285
3000256,3,B000XA5K4I,"I enjoyed this movie immensely. As I see it, the movie can work on two levels: (1) as a pure action film with very little brains, and/or (2) as a sly send-up of the action genre. For movie buffs, the chance to see Paul Giamatti as the bad guy is worth the price of admission all by itself. Action scenes are so over the top that there is no possibility of confusing the movie with reality, even Hollywood reality. So if you're an action junkie you're in for a treat. If you like seeing references to other films, you'll probably have a great time. If you are not in either of these camps, this film might not be for you.

Gave it three stars because its appeal is not universal.",1199664000,2,678,4.2153846153846155
3000257,3,B000XA5K4I,"2007's ""Shoot 'Em Up"" is something different in an action movie.  Every scence of carefully orchestrated violence is over-the-top overdone, on purpose, and the audience is in on the joke.  In scene after scene, a top-notch cast (Clive Owen, Paul Giamatti, and Monica Bulluci) execute, with a straight face, the most improbable gun fights, martial arts sequences, improvisation of weapons from ordinary objects (carrots, anyone) and impossible escapes from dire situations.

The plot is fairly straightforward.  A man named Smith (Owen) involves himself in the defense of a pregnant woman pursued by a gang of thugs.  The woman dies, but Smith saves the child.  Smith now finds himself the object of a relentless manhunt by the manical but hilariously hen-pecked hitman Hertz (Giamatti) and his men.  Smith enlists the aid of a lactating prostitute (Bulluci) while going after the conspiracy that has targeted the child.

This movie isn't for everyone.  Those expecting a straight-up action flick are liable to be confused and disappointed.  Those viewers able to grasp the premise (a live action version of the coyotte and the road-runner cartoon, with wonderful hardboiled dialogue) can relax and enjoy a unique presentation; this movie is recommended to that audience.",1199664000,,1270,5.336683417085427

If you are expecting a serious movie of any sort you will be sorely disappointed and likely end up hating it.  If you are looking for mindless fun with A LOT of gun play in it, you will probably love it.  Think of this movie as more of a spoof of other movies than anything else.

The effects and one liners are so far over the top, it had to be done completely on purpose.  I personally laughed most of the way through the movie and enjoyed the special effects and overall had an enjoyable experience that was definitely worth the rental fee.  I've rented movies before where I wanted my money back, and this is not one of them.

The friend that watched the movie with me is usually less critical of movies than I am, yet he said it is ""the worst movie he has ever seen"".  But, I believe he went in with expectations and seeing ""Rambo"".  This movie lies more towards the spoof of Rambo called, I believe, ""Hot Shots"", though the body count and gun fire in this movie, on that merit alone, will make any Rambo fan happy.

3000270,4,B000XA5K4I,"SHOOT 'EM UP is well named: this is a whompingly good action movie that is as much parody of its genre as it is a good story. It never for a moment takes itself seriously and it is played by a strong cast of top-drawer actors having a terrific time. Writer/director Michael Davis has found his niche and let's hope there will be more dark comedies that are as much fun to watch as this one.

The story is negligible: lone man Smith (Clive Owen at his best) observes a pregnant woman in chased distress, delivers her baby, then finishes off the huge gang of bad guys who are in pursuit, taking the newborn boy to transient safety. Smith finds a lactating prostitute Donna (beautiful Monica Bellucci), takes her from her business of kinky sex and makes her the baby's surrogate mother. A smarmy gangster Hertz (Paul Giamatti in another career forming role), connected to an illicit arms manufacturer Hammerson (Stephen McHattie), is in pursuit of both Smith and the baby for reasons that are finally disclosed: the baby is part of a ring of potential bone marrow donors for an important Senator.  The ending is, well, an ending.  But it is the getting there that is all the fun.

The dialog is peppered with hilarious one-liners that have a real edge and the methods of the endless killings include several using the carrot  that Smith keeps at hand as a weapon.  The shootings are fast and impossible but actually hilarious in the choreography.  Clive Owen plays the role straight, with a real gift for humor as well as action.  Paul Giamatti is a sinister delight and able to match Owens one-liner for one-liner.  Monica Bellucci makes her impossible role credible and as always is gorgeous to look at! This is a fast paced, finely written and acted parody - definitely deserving of the comic book title! Grady Harp, January 08",1199404800,34,1827,4.666666666666667

I want my money back, it's THAT bad. I will never watch this piece of garbage ever again.

The acting was beyond flat, the scenes were so beyond impossible that I could only laugh at them and the dialogue was so lame it was painful to sit through. It actually got worse the longer the film ran.

I blame the writer first and foremost for coming up with this steaming pile of film but after that there is an entire list of people to blame for producing this thing. The pitiful one liners are in every scene and the ""You know what I hate..."" stuff gets old after the third time let alone the twenty ninth. The writer is constantly pushing his attitudes on us regarding child raising, driving habits and gun control, none of which he seems mature enough to provide.

That is if hyperviolent action movies loaded with black humor are your cup of tea.

All other high-browed audiences only interested in CINEMA (conceited ""sniff sniff"" here), PLEASE, don't even bother.  Your finger waving and holding-of-the-noses are beyond tired.

Judge this film the same way you would judge an R-rated piece of anime' - not for the kiddies or the easily ruffled.

That being said (and hopefully taken to heart), I can honestly say this was my greatest guilty pleasure at the theater in 2007.  While I guess it does sort of fall into that ""gun porn"" slot, it's really a lot more clever and slapstick-ish (albeit in a sick way, lol) than one might be led to believe. Think ""Crank"", but with even better action pieces, music and much funnier.

Outstanding casting too - Owen, Giamatti and Bellucci were clearly having fun, and it shows.

I saw this in the theater, bought the soundtrack (score only, none of the rockin' tunes you hear sprinkled throughout the flick sadly - still good though) and today picked up the blu-ray and it only further crystallized my initial reaction - I truly and totally dig this movie.

And the blu-ray transfer is incredibly beautiful, both visually & sound-wise.  But maybe wait until it comes down a bit in price?  I dunno...perhaps rent it first before you plunk down 30 bucks to add it to your library.

Over the 39 years of my life, I've watched thousands of movies, read thousands of books, watched more TV than I care to state, and I can safely say that this movie had scenes that I've never seen in any media form before.

Ever.

Did I enjoy it?

Immensely! Never doubt that for a second.

Note that my review contains spoilers, so don't read further if you want to see the movie, or don't care about spoilers.

Have you ever seen a couple in the middle of hot monkey love get into a gunfight and CONTINUE to engage in carnal relations? I haven't.

Have you ever seen a gunfight take place during skydiving? I sure haven't. If I have, I don't remember it.

Have you ever wanted to teach some jack-off on the streets a lesson about signalling, or speeding? This movie is for you.

Ever wanted to deal with someone dealing out corporal punishment in public? This movie will give you satisfaction.

Plot wise, it was pretty complex. What appears to be a homeless man gets involved in trying to rescue a pregnant woman from someone who is clearly out to kill her. It just gets weirder from there.

He kills men by the dozens, all the while helping her deliver. Make that yet another scene I've never had the privilege in witnessing.

Sadly, the woman doesn't survive the ordeal, but the infant does, and more and more people continue to come after the baby in order to kill it.

Later in the movie, it's revealed why the baby has to die, and despite this, Mr. Smith does everything in his power to prevent the death. All the while the body count continues to grow, and the stunts, not to mention the gunfights, get more and more outrageous.

If only the Li, Statham movie War had been this enjoyable.

Many years ago, I read tons of adventure novels while going to school and for years afterwards. Mack Bolan, Able Team, Stony Man, Deathlands, Survivalist, just to name a few.

The action in this movie was like taking scenes from these over-the-top adrenaline filled, lactose laced pieces of pulp fiction and putting them on the silver screen.

Don't take this movie seriously, and you will enjoy yourself. Oh, and I'll never look at a carrot in the same light again. Who'd figured you'd be able to use it for that purpose?

As for the DVD, it has your usual offering of special features. There are nine deleted / extended scenes, with only one being a true deleted scene. The best of the bunch was the extended torture scene that really expands upon Clive Owen's character, Mr. Smith.

One very unique special feature is the animatics - one that the writer / director produced in order to sell the movie. The only way to watch these animatics without being confused is to have the director comments on.

Finally, there are five making of featurettes included.

There's a shootout in an abandoned train station; the woman gives birth; a wicked, intelligent killer named Mr. Hertz shows up.  Smith escapes with the child, and decides to take it to a lactating prostitute.  The three of them go on the run from Hertz, discovering along the way a scandal of tremendous proportions that could forever change the rest of their lives--if it doesn't kill them first.

Are you laughing at the implausibility of it all yet?  You should be.  ""Shoot 'Em Up"" is what action fans such as myself have been dreaming of for years--a guilty pleasure without any guilt.  It doesn't take itself seriously, and you shouldn't, either.  As stated in the behind the scenes featurette: there are probably more bullets than words, and that's just how we like it.

Clive Owen and Paul Giamatti, as Smith and Hertz respectively, bounce off each other like pingpong balls; both men are a delight to watch, Giamatti especially taking an immense thrill in the role of a sadistic genius.  Monica Bellucci adds some feminine wise-cracking allure to the film (which all action movies must have).  The movie--both the dialogue and action--is witty and intense; you'll laugh yourself off the edge of your seat, and yet shiver in suspense at the same time.  Never have I seen something so funny be so cool.  The action is as quick, the timing is impeccable, and ""Shoot 'Em Up"" is going down as one of the greatest action movies you've seen.

It's over the top, totally unbelievable, physically impossible, but absolutely brilliant all at the same time.

2 minute version:

Clive Owen eats a lot of carrots, and values his privacy.  There are many things that he absolutely hates, and he comes into contact with most of these things when he unwillingly gets involved in a plot to kill a very pregnant young woman.  Suddenly faced with a nanny job, he shoots his way out of the frying pan and into the fire, each scenario more draw-dropping-ly impossible than the last.  Paul Giamatti plays an unlikely criminal mastermind and Monica Bellucci is under-utilized as the proverbial professional with a heart of gold except she's also got a chest of milk to go with it.  Things get political, and hopelessly complicated, and of course there's lots and lots (and lots) of shooting, during any (and I do mean ANY) situation.

Good stuff:

1. Clive Owen
2. Clive Owen's one-liners
3. Clive Owen's stunts
4. The hilariously bad but breathtaking, yet impossible scenarios
5. Paul Giamatti's cell phone calls
6. The body count
7. Clive Owen's nude scene
8. Clive Owen

Bad stuff:

1. Carrots are DEFINITELY not good for some people
2. Not enough Bellucci
3. Plot (nuff said) but then again, we don't need no steenkin' plot

If you can forget that this movie professes to have a plot, you're in for a rollicking good (but extremely violent) time.  Definitely a must-see if you're looking for mindless adult entertainment, and don't mind looking at Clive Owen.

Rated: 4.5 stars

3000284,2,B000XA5K4I,"After reading the title, a majority of moviegoers think of gun action and they are right, but mindless action that is. Director Michael Davis's original concept--in which at first was verbally explained--was not taken seriously by several studios. He literally illustrated a 17- minute reel of animation which consisted of 17,000 line drawings of action sequences, but those studios were still confused. I really do not know why they had such a hard time understanding his vision because when watching this film; the ""cartoon-like"" action was very evident. Maybe that is why New Line Cinema and CEO Bob Shay understood his weird vision and gave him the green light. The character development, and most importantly the action cannot even save this rascally ""rabbit"" of a movie.

It's night time in a desolate part of the city. Mr. Smith (Clive Owen)--not to be confused with Agent Smith from The Matrix--is sitting on a city bench; minding his own business, when he notices a blond pregnant woman who is walking by. At first, he is not very surprised about her appearance but within moments, he notices that she is in distress and ready to go into labor. However within split seconds; a car suddenly rushes by and crashes into another parked vehicle. The assailment immediately leaves his wrecked car and pursues his powerless victim but Smith simply cannot allow his atrocity to occur and follows the two into the building. Meanwhile Mr. Hertz (Paul Giamatti) and the rest of his motley crew of thugs arrive at the scene and join in the pursuit of the pregnant woman. Within moments, they soon discover Smith and start rapidly firing an array of bullets from the different weapons that they have but do little damage to our hero as he pursues the woman. He delivers the baby while killing all the thugs around him. Then he escapes with the new born baby but the new mother didn't make it.

He takes the baby to a place of safety where he joins up with a prostitute (Monica Bellucci [Donna].) Then he takes her and the baby to another secured shelter and must now go after Hertz, to find out why he wants this baby dead. What will happen to our hero? Is this simply a case of revenge or something much more complicated?

Shoot `Em Up should have never gotten the green light. Director Michael Davis begins the movie as if it was a sequel from a prior film--as a Matrix Reloaded was to Matrix Revolutions, where it is understandable to have action to start a movie. Any good director with experience knows to begin a movie with background information of who the main characters are and how the story revolves around them. Shoot `Em Up begins with a bam!

Then the Director gives us vague references in the story that Smith may have been in the military, perhaps Special Forces or maybe he is a solider of fortune, but we have to guess through weak clues such as putting his lady friend into a tank or when he goes into a gun store to purchase weapons and ammunition. Mr. Hertz is the bad guy who wants the baby dead, but who is this person? Does he work for the Government of the United States? Is he involved with organized crime? The only information we receive has nothing to do with the plot, such as talking to his wife on the phone or how he shows his dislike to Smith--he might have a personal vendetta but some vague information about him appears way too late in the film. We have confusion and boredom; the focal point of the movie is the baby!

The action is plenty but cartoon-like and soulless. It was quite clear that this is a live action spoof of other films from the genre--The Transporter and Crank. There are references to Bugs Bunny and The Road Runner (with the acme traps) with Smith eating carrots and making wise cracks. Then there is Hertz responding back with ""you're a rascally little rabbit!"" Is Davis making fun of Warner Brothers or Looney Tunes cartoons? Therefore, the action was unrealistic and this would be acceptable if the promotion for this film was marketed towards this theme. It leaves the audience perplexed.

The Verdict:
Please, enter at your risk. Shoot `Em Up leaves you wondering about the direction. We can see why several studios rejected this movie because they were probably confused with the director's concept (those thousands of drawings). It leaves you wondering what New Line Cinema was thinking.

The movie appears to be a satire on the genre or themed towards Looney Tunes? The non existent character development; comical killings, not enough information and plenty of unrealistic action--which has no merit and the visuals become monotonous. Perhaps Clive's character in this film is a way of saying that he should have been the next James Bond, but this is not the way to do it.",1196640000,5,4735,4.6975903614457835

3000288,3,B000XA5K4I,"""Shoot `Em Up"" is like watching a live action graphic novel. A fun movie, it is very violent and filled with some memorable lines. Nice turns by Clive Owen and Paul Giamatti almost make the completely excruciating performance by Monica Bellucci forgivable. The film doesn't have the visual style of other graphic novel adaptations, but it is fun nonetheless.

A tall, unshaven man wearing a black leather overcoat (Clive Owen) sits on a bus bench eating a carrot. He watches a pregnant woman run by, clutching her stomach. Then, a car filled with gun toting men barrels around the corner. ""Mr. Smith"" realizes the woman is in trouble and hurries to her aid. He rushes the woman into an abandoned warehouse and tries to comfort the new mother as she gives birth. Complicating matters are the numerous men with guns who don't care about the impending birth and want to kill the woman. Mr. Smith has to aid the new mother as he tries to protect her. Hertz (Paul Giamatti), the leader of the bad guys, is a little puzzled; he doesn't know who Smith is, or why he gets involved. The woman dies shortly after giving birth and Smith realizes he now has to care for the baby. But Hertz and his men are in pursuit, so Smith looks for help. He turns to a hooker named Donna (Monica Bellucci) who has recently given birth. Smith has to protect the baby and Donna and figure out why Hertz is so intent on getting the child.

I mentioned earlier that watching ""Shoot"" is like watching a live-action graphic novel. This is a growing trend, basing films on graphic novels, allowing filmmakers to delve into unusual, strange stories, stories that would never see the light of day in a more conventional filmmaker's universe. This growing subgenre of film has brought us a number of highly visual, very interesting films. Films like ""Sin City"" and ""300"" shot the characters against green screen, adding backgrounds later, giving the films an even greater graphic novel style. And these films are pretty magnificent. Graphic novels have also greatly influenced other films. ""Batman Begins"" was based on the work of Frank Miller, who also created ""Sin City"" and ""300"", giving the superhero a darker edge and making him more interesting. ""Shoot `Em Up"" has some of these similar elements, but the environment is not nearly as interesting. The film is set in a run down metropolis, a common setting for this type of story, but it looks like a set someone went through and added some elements to, to amp up the `weird' factor. The visual style is no where near as interesting or complete as ""Sin City"".

Interestingly, Clive Owen appears in both playing a similar character. In ""Shoot `Em Up"", `Smith"" is not as well defined as Dwight, his character in ""Sin City"", or as interesting, but he is fun to watch. Taking on elements of Clint Eastwood's famous cowboy persona, The Man with No Name, Owen's character simply becomes known as ""Smith"". Throughout, we learn little bits about him and Kurtz even gives us a few facts he either learned or gleamed from his dealings with the reluctant hero.

From the first moment we see him, sitting on a bus stop bench, at night, in the middle of a run down metropolis; we know Smith is probably not going to win any citizenship awards. I instantly got the feeling he was living off the grid, supported by a visit to his home later in the film. Smith lives in an abandoned warehouse complete with his own indoor garden, filled with carrots ripe for the plucking, and eating. ""Good for the eyesight"" he states, when Donna looks at him strangely.

Smith is also a reluctant hero. He watches the pregnant woman run down the street and then the car full of gun toting men. He sighs, gets up and gets involved. After she dies, he initially wants to leave the baby, but decides he can't. This reluctance adds some interest to his character. As he becomes further entwined in the story, his curiosity takes over. As Kurtz becomes more persistent, this serves to make Smith more hell bent on revenge. These moments help to make Smith a more interesting character; even though he inhabits a cartoon universe, he seems to have some real feelings and emotions.

It is interesting to watch Paul Giamatti play a villain. It is a nice change for this actor who gained a lot of critical praise for his work in ""Sideways"". Kurtz is not your normal villain; he is evil and hell bent on achieving his goal, but he also appears to be a more typical man. Yes, he has a gun in his hand, but without this deadly weapon, he could just as easily be mistaken for a librarian, creating one of the more interesting villains to come along in some time.

Kurtz also has some moments of levity; his wife constantly calls on his cell phone, apparently unaware of her husband's true occupation. At moments, he wonders out loud how Smith could be giving them so much trouble. These elements help to make Giamatti's Kurtz seem vulnerable, less scary, yet when he speaks, gritting his teeth, we understand how deadly he can be. This is a villain who is equally at home spraying bullets across a room as he is trying to problem solving, and figuring things out.

When the film was over, my companion commented that if you took all of the dialogue in the film it would probably only fill ten pages. She is completely true. Unfortunately Monica Bellucci still has a considerable amount of dialogue in the film. Bellucci has an extremely heavy accent, making most of what she says difficult to understand. That, and the fact that she isn't a good actress, makes it difficult to watch her on any level. Sure, she's very pretty, but there are many very pretty actresses in Hollywood who can at least act a little and would have done a better job in this role. Throughout the film, she frequently says ""Smith"" and even this simple line seems to perplex her.

""Shoot `Em Up"" certainly delivers on the action. From the initial confrontation in the abandoned warehouse, where Smith quickly secures a gun, he is never without a pistol for long. And when he doesn't have a sidearm, he finds other items to help him ward off the villains. Smith gets into many tough scrapes and finds some ingenious ways to get out of the situation. With each confrontation,  the stakes are raised along with the danger; and the elaborate stunts Smith pulls to get out of these scrapes escalates until you think it can't possibly go any further. But it does. You keep expecting the next confrontation to be a little more normal, but they just keep getting more outlandish. Watching the action in ""Shoot `Em Up"" is a little like riding a roller coaster, with bullets flying overhead.

But I can't really describe any of this, because it would spoil the fun of watching it yourself.

As good as the action is, it is also over the top and cartoony. I suspect it is intended as a parody of action violence; Smith's constant chewing on carrots leads Kurtz to spout an Elmer Fudd line drawing an obvious comparison. It's a funny moment, but I'm not sure the film works on this level. The over the top gross elements take it to a different plane.

The story? The story is as cartoony and outlandish as the rest of the film. As we watch, it continues to become more outrageous. Who cares. I'm not going to a film called ""Shoot `Em Up"" looking for an Academy Award caliber performance. The story is supposed to be silly.

""Shoot `Em Up"" is not a perfect film. There are a few too many over the top gross elements as well. And every time Monica Bellucci appears on screen, I felt like ripping my ears out. But the Clive Owen and Paul Giamatti are fun and the action is over the top. I guarantee that you have never seen some of these action scenes.

My companion commented that she felt maybe Owen was trying to prove that he would have made a good James Bond. He certainly has the chops to carry an action film.",1193616000,12,7852,4.582621082621083

If you want to walk away from the movie with a big ole smile on your face, watch this movie.....again and again.

I LOVED this movie because it didn't take itself seriously, it was just alot of fun.  Isn't that what going to the movies is all about?",1193443200,4,1050,4.531914893617022
3000291,4,B000XA5K4I,"If there's at least one thing anyone can agree on about ""Shoot 'Em Up,"" it's that you know what you're getting.  Clive Owen as Mr. Smith runs hither and thither, shooting up people and things, munching on over-sized carrots and basically turning the world on with his song.  Er, his gun.  His many, many guns.  And that's it.  Should I go on?

I guess I should.

The plot is as contrived as the action: a pregnant woman is harrassed by about eighty bad guys who want to shoot her in the belly.  Smith, our reluctant hero, jumps in and starts killing people with carrots and severing umbilical cords with bullets.  After he absconds with the infant, he is chased relentlessly by a bug-eyed sniper named Hertz (Giamatti, who seems to LOVE being the smarmy, wise-cracking bad guy for once).  With the help of a lactating prostitute and his otherworldly prowess with a trigger, Smith figures out why this baby's life is on the line, and just why he should care.

At its most uncomfortable, the tale is basically about very evil men trying to pop a cap into a very cute infant.  At its most obtuse, the entire plot is one long commercial for ... wait for it ... gun control.  The irony, it needn't be said, is intentional, although the film's target audience may find it indecipherable (or, more likely, completely beside the point).  I suppose that's what you get when you try to make a movie that is both a weighty public service announcement AND an unflinching parody of itself.

Where the film falters (if at all), it isn't necessarily in the overkill.  In fact, if you think the movie is overdone, then you've already missed the point (or aren't a fan of the point; either way).  It's the movie's attempts to be consciously cute that stand out the most, much like the baby-in-a-bulletproof-vest that forms it's core.  Maybe I'm nit-picking, but it was good enough for me to have Smith gnawing away on that carrot and uttering things like, ""Eat your vegetables.""  Then the movie goes and gives him massive white bandages on his hands (which look like massive white gloves), and tosses him the line, ""What's up, Doc?""

I guess I'll take moments like these, where the self-consciousness oozes out of each hot, powdered frame.  Where Hertz, after Smith has escaped yet again, yells, ""Do we just suck, or is he really that good?""  Wry to a fault, though the film may be, it's also a teat full of testosterone, and any guy who's ever wanted the firepower of Wile E. Coyote and the panache of Bugs Bunny will probably be pleased.  After all, hold a Y chromosome up to your eye, and it looks an awful lot like a rifle-sight.",1193356800,2,2616,4.578494623655914
3000292,4,B000XA5K4I,"Shoot `Em Up was not at the top of my list to see but my wife and I like Clive Owen so we decided to give the film a look.  The story is as flimsy and ridiculous (a gun-control Senator creating a baby farm so he can have a supply of bone marrow) as they come and the characters are equally shallow: the entire point is to create as many different shoot outs as possible.  Humor in violence is nothing new in the cinema and what makes this film work is Clive Owen's performance as the carrot chewing Mr. Smith, an unlikely dark knight for the newborn he is protecting but certainly a cut above the odious Hertz (played with snarling fury by Paul Giammetti).  Monica Bellucci makes a great partner and foil for the indestructible Mr. Smith as they dodge bullets with the baby in tow.  The film takes in some situations that some of us will have empathy with, such as the driver of a Mercedes who doesn't use turn signals and cuts off other drivers, the final insult coming when he throws a paper cup out of his window.

The film comes off more like a PC game with its impossible situations and one-dimensional characters but also has the element of perverse fun that goes with a game.  However, some viewers will find the seemingly endless killing disturbing as the film tries to be more inventive as how to do away with the endless supply of bad guys.  I am not sure that this is a movie that I will want to see again but it was entertaining the first go around.",1190246400,,1461,4.290909090909091

The film started off excellently and simply got better. I didn't want the film to end and I hope they make a sequel.
If I had to compare it with a recent action movie, I suppose that in places it had the look and feel of Kill Bill 1 but was more gripping and more fun. It also had the sort of over the top action that  you might have seen in Charlie's Angels I/II. The end credits were reminiscent of a Bond movie.......",1189987200,2,672,4.209302325581396

A few moments had me cheering, like the obnoxious driver in an over-priced car getting run off the road. Lots of scenes, too many to remember, had me laughing, at least at a dark kind of humor. And, in the end, daddy (sort of), mommy (sort of), and baby (real) settle down to some family values, or try to.

On the ""guilty"" side of the equation, we have the man-a-minute body count, violence of graphic sorts, expendable women enslaved to baby making, and the yuk-factor around a prostitute (with required heart of gold) whose clientele pay extra for genuine mommy-milk in the original container. If you want your dignity or sensitivity to be respected, you'll never admit you saw it.

The title sets your expectations: it tongue-in-cheekily names itself for the whole genre of movies that revel in gunplay, and it delivers. If you can take the gore level, it's a fair comedy. It really isn't for everyone, though.

In reality however, it is the ultimate guilty pleasure action film for extreme fans of the genre, and is closer to a Wile E.

Wildly stylized characters, way over-the-top action, and umbilical cord surgery with a bullet, ""Shoot `Em Up"" is explosive entertainment for only those who can stomach nonstop mindless action.

Expert marksman and live-action Bugs Bunny Mr. Smith (Clive Owen) rescues an infant from a gang of mercenaries and becomes embroiled in a conspiracy involving gun makers, senators, and maniacal hitman Hertz (Paul Giamatti). Recruiting sassy French prostitute Donna (Monica Bellucci) to care for the baby, Smith shoots his way to the top of the food chain in a wild fight to uncover those responsible for the devious plot.

A proverbial Bugs Bunny, including literally mimicking the ""wascally wabbit,"" Clive Owen's Mr. Smith exudes cool; it's apparent that this is his shot at being James Bond (director Michael Davis always wanted to direct a Bond film) and he's thrown in every snappy one-liner and unflinching glare that he possibly can. Paul Giamatti is the show stealer as the crazed assassin Mr. Hertz, who is ruthlessly vile, wickedly intelligent, and an inept family man. His role is constantly surprising and spontaneous, and his batty bearded grins are laughably priceless. Monica Bellucci seems selected only for her willingness to do nude scenes and her sexy French accent. The remainder of the supporting cast are merely targets thrown in front of machine guns and heavy firepower to keep the downtime to a minimum. Even sex scenes are blanketed by violence, gunfire, and a bit of humor. While everything is markedly seedy and gritty, these antiheroes and villains fit perfectly into the underworld locales and environments (you wouldn't guess Bellucci was a prostitute based on the trailer).

Some may consider Shoot `Em Up's weakest component to be its ridiculous story and the robotic debriefing of plot twists. But then they would have missed the point entirely. Davis' film mocks the overly simplistic and oftentimes nonsensical storylines of humdrum actioners and makes no excuses for its own deliberate transitions and set pieces that roll from one action sequence directly into another. Much like the clever ridicule of stereotypical horror films by Wes Craven's ""Scream,"" the characters in Shoot `Em Up are self aware of their positions in an action movie and work to make it as defiantly unexpected as possible. Clive Owen's Mr. Smith constantly spouts off his dislikes of the normalcies regularly witnessed in the genre, and the comforting blend of hyper-violence, twisted humor, and extreme exaggerations never stales throughout the relatively short running time. Nonstop action doesn't always make a movie, but it sure does help.

So much action permeates every scene in Shoot `Em Up that to call it just an action movie would be an understatement. It's unrelenting action bravado of a particularly brutal temperament, masked by loads of dark humor (even the sex scene manages to have a vicious firefight halfway through). Shoot `Em Up proves that carrots can be deadly weapons, limerick usage makes better bad guys, and no matter the amount of killing done, it can be redeemed by saving the life of a babe (or two). And having a plot isn't always a requirement for making an entertaining action movie.

3234046,4,B000XA5K4I,"Rarely has a title so accurately described the movie it represents. ""Shoot `Em Up"" is a no-holds-barred, over the top, action-packed roller coaster ride with a sick, depraved sense of humor. And yes, I enjoyed every second of it; here's a film so aware of its tastelessness that it piles it on thick, with stylish, excessive violence and one-liners so hokey that they succeed in being incredibly funny. It's a good thing it refuses to take itself seriously; only a tongue in cheek movie could feature a baby's birth in the midst of a shootout. You would never expect something like that to be fun, but it certainly is in the case of ""Shoot `Em Up."" Of all the mindless action films of recent memory, this one is by far the most original, the most engaging, and definitely the most entertaining.

The main character is a man known only as Mr. Smith (Clive Owen), a gun-toting tough guy who likes carrots and hates drivers that don't use turn signals. He opens the film with a shootout scene that's anything but formulaic--he tries to save a pregnant woman from an army of well-armed bad guys. Leading them is the ruthless Hertz (Paul Giamatti), who wants to get home for his son's birthday party. While Smith doesn't know who the woman is or why Hertz wants her dead, he willingly intervenes on her behalf, shooting whoever tries to get near her. He also delivers her baby with the speed and accuracy of a professional sharpshooter, even using his gun to shoot off the umbilical cord.

The baby is safe, thank goodness. Unfortunately, Smith is too late to save its mother, who quickly takes a bullet to the brain. Now stuck with a newborn, and now on Hertz's short list of business to be taken care of, Smith finds himself drawn into an elaborate web of political and medical corruption. To make sure the baby is cared for, he seeks the help of Donna Quintano (Monica Bellucci), an Italian prostitute specializing in clients with a lactation fetish. She's initially unwilling to have anything to do with Smith or the baby. But she lowers her defenses as the film progresses, albeit reluctantly. The baby--who she names Oliver--reminds her of a painful past event she's been trying to forget. And Smith ... well, he's just Smith: a cold, spiteful, wisecracking gun enthusiast.

Hertz, meanwhile, is desperately trying to find the baby. But why? Does it really matter? If it allows for scene after scene of fun-filled, high-energy shootouts, I should think not. This movie plays like an extended stunt montage, with every jump, kick, jab, punch, and slam made overtly unrealistic for maximum enjoyment. Characters shoot at each other as if being paid by the bullet. Wound-ridden bodies litter the floor. This movie's violence is so brutally overplayed that I couldn't help but laugh, which I'm sure was the intended effect. I also laughed quite a bit at Smith's jokiness as well as his unique views on protecting a newborn baby; there's a moment when he explains the intricacies of a gun to Oliver, from where to load it to how to hold it to when to shoot it. It should come as no surprise that the baby actually smiles at this.

Does this sound like the conventional material of an action film? If it were possible to pinpoint what makes this movie work so well, every filmmaker would be relying on it. The genre has nothing to do with it--action films are about as common as they get. It certainly isn't because it's wholesome, pure, or even necessary--this is escapism at its most extreme. Maybe it has something to do with revitalizing the action film, presenting a clever, original story that not only laughs at its own outrageousness, but flaunts it, as well. With the exception of its length (a brisk ninety minutes), everything about ""Shoot `Em Up"" is big, from the stunts to the sense of humor to the completely preposterous story. And that's exactly the way it should be; nothing this intense could ever be told on a small scale.

There's a scene late in the film that pits Smith against Hertz while on a flight: ""Guns don't kill people,"" Hertz says, ""but they sure do help."" Had this been any other movie, such a line might have been questionable, maybe even offensive. But for a film like ""Shoot `Em Up,"" it fits right in. Pretty much everything about this movie fits, despite being untamed, improper, and just plain excessive. But that's what makes it so much fun; the further it went, the more I enjoyed myself, and the more I enjoyed myself, the further it went. This movie doesn't know the meaning of restraint, and that above all else made it great. Only one thing that could have made it better: a body count at the bottom corner of the screen. Now that would have been funny.",1189296000,2,4691,4.674334140435835
3234047,4,B000XA5K4I,"This film is what the movie Crank wishes it was. A clever action movie with wit and an insane body count. Clive Owen owns this role as expected, and Paul Giamatti makes for an interesting villian. Monica Bellucci is eye candy for sure, but provides little else. There is almost no let up in the pace and the rock tunes really fit the many action scenes. People in my theater were going nuts over some of the gags.

While I felt 3:10 to Yuma was a better film, Shoot 'Em Up was even more fun to watch. Two very good movies in one weekend. Thats gotta be some kind of record.

3234048,5,B000XA5K4I,"This was one nasty, action-packed piece of celluloid. And I loved it. SHOOT 'EM UP feels like Owen, Giamatti, and Belluci, on a whim and during short breaks in between the shooting of a prestigious Ivory Merchant picture, decided to goof around with the cameras and somehow ended up with this bullet-riddled, somber-faced, but tongue-in-cheeked action film. Oh, the three of them play their roles intently and sincerely enough, but there doesn't seem to be a doubt that they had a hellacious hoot cobbling this actioner together. SHOOT 'EM UP is unapologetically, subversively violent and darkly humorous, furiously careening on screen like a Frank Miller graphic novel come to life.

The meager plot: Carrot-chomping Mr. Smith (the cool and stoic Clive Owen) comes to the aid of a pregnant woman being pursued by a pack of assailants. In a tone-setting scene, the woman buys a bullet but not before Mr. Smith accesses his inner midwife and delivers the baby, along the way offing a villain with a vegetable. Now, Smith's maternal side surfaces as he's compelled to protect the newborn infant being mysteriously sought by a gang of gunmen, led by the vicious but p-whipped Mr. Hertz (Paul Giamatti, playing marvelously against type). Smith finds himself turning to one person: a beautiful, golden-hearted prostitute named DQ (Monica Belluci). And that's really all the plot one needs to know.

In conceptualizing this film, probably the first thing to get tossed out the window was subtlety. What we're left with is a film with a title that's dead-on descriptive. The film foregoes things like plot nuances and character depth and development in favor of getting to the set pieces A.S.A.P. And, yet, the film does manage to maintain coherence and cohesion. The film opens up with a sequence that'll get your juices flowing, but, then, it sustains the high-octane pace. So, for those who like their flicks narratively fleshed out and fully explored, beware. There comes a time when a fella just gets sick and tired of back stories and elucidative exposition. SHOOT 'EM UP is a guy's flick, thru and thru, and will instantly envelop you in a warm, fuzzy blanket of wanton destruction and carrot abuse. This is a short film (around an hour and a half), but it comes at you in torrents of preposterous, frenetic, but stylish action sequences.

And, absolutely, it more than makes up for the latest theater yawnfest that was Jet Li and Jason Statham's WAR. The male leads in SHOOT 'EM UP are two actors who, to go by their past works, are essentially bumming it here. But they do end up lending what credibility there is to lend to a film like this. Clive Owen plays it just right with his antihero character. Owen's Smith, with intense and deadpan panache and an understated one-liner or two, just keeps on wreaking damage of cartoonish proportions. By sheer will power and an overpoweringly composed demeanor, Owen makes you go along with the blistering sequences even as you shake your head at the gross unbelievability of it all. He does things with carrots which I'm quite certain God never intended for carrots to do. Paul Giamatti, whose Mr. Hertz seems to toil in a state of ever increasing aggravation, is again wonderful, this time in a part we're not used to seeing him play. It's a nice touch, by the way, the pestering wife and all. Henpecked and evil, that's Hertz all over. And, while Monica Belluci isn't really given much to work with in her been-there, done-that role, she looks beautiful, as ever.

Lastly, keep an eye out for a funky sex scene which further underlines the gratuitous, cartoony feel of the film even as it succeeds in one-upping&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crank-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000K7UBSO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crank (Widescreen Edition)</a>'s own boisterous display of lewdness.

3234050,5,B000XA5K4I,"Homeless bum Mr. Smith (Clive Owen) winds up getting involved in a bad situation when he helps deliver a baby, but the mother (Ramona Pringle) gets killed in the process by plenty of thugs. These thugs are the followers of Mr. Hertz (Paul Giamatti), a whipped contract killer who has plans for the baby. Smith can only turn to a hooker named ""DQ"" (Monica Bellucci), someone he recently had liaisons with, and the only woman who can deliver milk for her customers.

Michael Davis may only be known for his work on various direct-to-DVD features (including the horror comedy ""Monster Man""). But he is making a major debut in silver screens with the bombastic action event of the fall season, ""Shoot 'Em Up"". At first, it may be hard to top recent non-stop action funfests from this past summer (""D.O.A. Dead or Alive"" and ""Transformers""), but then again, it doesn't have to. And that's why it's such a great ride.

Cribbing from John Woo 101, ""SEU"" starts off with guns blazing and over-the-top violence you have to see to believe. As well as using pistols and AK's, Smith also uses carrots to kills his enemies. It may sound silly, but Smith's clever plans allow this trick to achieve its goal, especially with guns in hand. Of course, the carrot gags tend to get old (you can literally start a drinking game and drink whenever Smith eats a carrot, or Hertz making reference to Bugz Bunny and Elmer Fudd or Energizer Bunny), but Davis compensates with fast-paced wall-to-wall action that films like ""Live Free or Die Hard"" could've used.

Besides, with tracks from AC/DC (""If You Want Blood, You Got It""), Motorhead (""Ace of Spades""), and Wolfmother (""Joker & the Thief), how could you not resist ""SEU""'s intent to entertain your pants off?

And I'm surprised by the star wattage of a film like this. Especially since Clive Owen appeals more to adults. Owen may tend to overplay his hand and fill any air with corny one-liners that James Bond wouldn't even be caught dead saying, but when handling the action-packed scenes, he's a great Chow Yuen-Fat surrogate. He gets further compliments from Monica Bellucci or Paul Giamatti, two other actors who wouldn't wind up in a film like this, yet they fulfill their duties.

Shoot 'Em Up also had the nasty habit to go south when Davis inserts a scene of drama (this little batch of Kool-Aid was consumed in Robert Rodriguez's ""Grindhouse"" feature ""Planet Terror""; frankly, trying to be poignant in a film that's pretty much a cartoon is a red flag) or flat-out explains the twist about why the baby is being targeted. That's all taken care of in the finale, which I dare not spoil.

It's a nice change of scenery when, in the midst of crappy sequels, a director has a set of balls to be unpretentious and deliver what's expected. I've said this concerning recent films from Michael Bay, Corey Yuen, or Edgar Wright, but Michael Davis proudly joins that list. And I hope that there are more well-intentioned filmmakers who can deliver the goods as much as he can. But this is coming from someone who doesn't watch these overrated Oscar-nominated films (which, I'm sure, will include Tom Cruise's next bullcrap project ""Lions for Lambs"").",1189123200,2,3181,4.764065335753176

It's not a realistic film at all, it's not pretending to be either, there's plenty of carrot killing action, bullets flying (that never hit the good guy (Clive Owen), there's plenty of running while being shot shooting over your shoulder and accurately dispatching bad guy action. There's even a sex scene where bad guys are shot. Bullets can spin playground merry go rounds, a cheesy villain (who also miraculously avoids getting shot), a witty prostitue, and a baby that at times during action scenes is clearly a doll strapped to his back, all just make the movie more fun!

3234337,2,B000XA5K4I,"Trash! Even for a low-budget, cheap production with no-name actors it was a sorry production. I watched it because a friend in Thailand who does not understand English well as spoken by thugs and British people) told me she watched it. I found it on youtube but the sound was too low, so I went to Amazon and took a chance - invested $2.99 - plus tax - after I saw it was rated 4 stars - right up there with that ""Aces"" movie with Ben Affleck, which is a classic.

But, even as a  caricature of bad spy movies with too many incidental murders and too much of people driving around smashing ordinary peoples' cars and trashing ordinary peoples' lives it does not work. The hero had got the mean ""stare"" down pat - I give you that: he can stare, while eating a carrot and you can believe that he is really one of the dangerous ones, contemplating breaking out into violent justice against the sick, evil-doers out there. But the bad guys are lousy actors, trying to act like imitation characters as seen normally in cheap movies - and they fail at it. If I could suspend believe and pretend that a person really could take the time to wind up for a death blow to someone's head - and not get a knee to the groin or anything that his clueless evil opponent might due while waiting -  or that someone could in theory make one wild shot while hanging upside down or sliding across an oil-spill on a floor.... but not 15 people shot one after the other while standing in plain sight, firing hundreds of bullets that never hit anyone except for one freak shot into the head of the woman who just gave birth the baby .....

No. If you like this sort of movie, then this movie is Trash!

So.... why did I watch it? I didn't. A lttle after the hero walked out of the gun shop - after paying for some weapons of war and ammunition (partly with food stamps {that wasn't funny}) and found his hooker assistant - whom we already know is a cowardly loser who would have sold him out to the murderous inept jerk who has to hire 50 MORE thugs for backup after he blew the last assassination attempt and finds she has disappeared - gone done an alley with a trick - to make some money for the baby - I stopped watching. Even  the cliches, spoken and acted-out were not funny.

I would rather spend my time - meditating, exercising, studying earh-bag construction online, reading what other insomniacs write .... than watching such garbage.",1441152000,,2421,4.3547671840354765

3234385,4,B000XA5K4I,"In the first 30 seconds of the movie, I thought I had made a mistake in renting this flick.  It looked like it was going to be a self-aware, heavy-handed parody of the action genre, which would be leaden and unfunny.  But actually the movie turned into a pretty decent actioner, albeit the action sequences were over the top - way over the top - and yet it kept my attention - despite some cringe-worthy violence - and I actually got invested in the shallow two-dimensional characters.

This movie was more like an action movie on steroids, rather than a straight up parody.  The movie had all the cliches of the actioner; Clive Owens delivered the de rigeur quip at the end of each sequence like Schwarzenegger or Willis and the gunfire would have involved tons of ammunition.

A surprise was nebbish Paul Giamatti's turn as tough-guy villain. Giamatti was a stone cold killer, and, yet, still a kind of nebbish.

One of my favorite scenes in the film is when Clive is surrounded by 30 bad guys with automatic weapons and somehow Clive kills all of them.

Be sure to move the rug out from in front of your entertainment center because 100% pure, grade-A American cheddar will ooze out of your speakers and screen. Don't let it go to waste.

3234398,5,B000XA5K4I,Shoot 'Em up is a Bugs Bunny cartoon reimagined as a dark sexy modern live action adventure movie.  Almost the entire movie is a series of action sequences.  The action sequences serve the story well.  I was impressed at the degree to which the movie was able to develop plot and character with so much action and so few words. The movie is clever and  surreal with a wry sense of humor.  I have watched it three times.  With successive viewings I am enjoying the craftsmanship of the writing directing and acting increasingly.  An excellent action adventure film.,1426032000,,564,4.6938775510204085

Clive kills at least 4 or 5 bad mercenaries every few minutes for the entire movie. His skills were marveled by the chief of the bad guys who was amazed at where he got this training. When all the smoke clears all the bad guys are dead and Clive and his girl friend and the baby are safe. Sky diving shoot outs and head on crashes to get into the bad guys car are just some of the amazing feats of our hero. He eats lots of carrots and uses them for trigger control on his weapons too!

What's with Clive Owen eating a carrot and killing people with it? That's just so stupid! How did this piece of trash get made?

Also, this film is tremendously vulgar and I mean really pervertedly vulgar. One example is Paul Giamatti fondling a dead woman in the backseat of a car. I can't believe the three main actors would even have consented to be in such garbage. Clive Owen, for whom I always enjoyed in films, has been in a couple of really terrible movies, this one by far the worst! If he continues to choose really sick films like this to star in, he might find he won't have much of a career left.

This movie is so over the top in its cartoon violence, pacing, effects and gun-play that one just has to shut off upper brain functions and enjoy the ride.  I originally saw this about the same time as the Crank movies which I similarly got a kick out of.  In short a marksman protects a baby w/ the help of a lactating hooker from hit men for a gun manufacturer trying to stop a bone marrow harvesting senator who would put them out of business. Got that? Laugh!  The blu-ray picture quality is terrific and there's a nice layer of filmic grain throughout, details are very sharp.  I imagine these actors all had fun w/ this film, Giamatti chews scenery and glowers menacingly as the chunky assassin whose gunfights are periodically interrupted by phone calls from his nagging wife.

Too much action at the expense of any semblance of a plot.

Don't get me wrong, I like my guns, bullets and steel.  But I don't like the idea of 2 hours of over the top unbelievable stuff lacking any plot whatsoever.  Guns are guns and it's cool when the good guys need to be careful too.  Is it meant to make fun of stupid action movies?  Possibly, but it also doesn't really look any different than the movies it makes fun of.

Now, I figure that lack of substance is precisely the point here, but that didn't make it any more enjoyable, to me.

And noir, the more I see it in its modern incarnations, is not my thing.

Past dislikes in similar movies:  Boondock Saints (which I hated even more), Hardboiled.

Past likes on action movies:  Man on Fire, Die Hard, Dirty Harry, Scarface, Devil's Rejects (horror), Payback.

Why the likes and dislikes?  Well, I ain't dissing Shoot Em Up just because I dislike violent movies in general.  I just hated this one and would have liked my 2 hours back.

I suppose part of the point of this picture is that it is supposed to be ridiculous, but it's not ridiculous in a good way at all. The acting seems weak to downright dreadful. The script goes for lowball funny jabs within one-liners, but the whole delivery of these lines makes it seem seriously predictable and downright annoying. Many of the moments that are there for comedy don't seem as funny as they do stupid and inept. I found my self thinking things like ""Oh gawd, I could have guessed he was going to say that and I was praying he wouldn't cuz if he does it's gonna be all downhill from here"" about 20 times. By the time it got to the overly fake looking skydiving shootout segment(which is near the end)I couldn't barely take it anymore. I shut the film off. I shut it off to save my self any further brain damage from this film, which putting it simply was pretty bad. The action sequences promised to be so insane and over the top that it would be the most amazing action footage ever committed to film. But it fails to do this dreadfully because there have been other films that had such sequences that were even more ridiculous and over the top that were done with real creativity. First film that comes to mind off the top of my head is Kill Bill volume I. I should have stuck that in the Bluray player instead of this crap.

Since the film is filled with shootings, it is rather remarkable that he has no gun, at this time. He sees a man apparently trying to kill a pregnant woman. He intervenes and kills him by stabbing him with a carrot. He is then chased by many armed men. When he kills them all, the head man of the chasers hires another fifty, yes fifty.

Sex and violence is the game of this movie, and honestly, the over the top action scenes got to be a little too much. I can only watch so many guns going off before getting bored. What little romance there was was ridiculously fake and half left me confused.

However, if you're in to massive gratuitous amounts of violence, constant action, guns, and death by carrots, go for it.

3234529,5,B000XA5K4I,"***Brief Review***

This film is not obviously not for those in the mood to think.  It's HEAVY on the action and light on just about everything else.  Actor and Actress wise it's actually good.  Monica Belluci is a great actress, and although this film is not a BRIGHT spot in her career, she still is not terrible in her performance.

Clive in this film is a pistal expert...that's an understatement.  The man makes shots that only could be matched by Golgo 13 in their impossibleness.

Story.  There is none.  Something about a baby, it's organs...or something.

This is a leave your thinking cap at the door film.  Sometimes we guys need those kind of movies.  Will your girlfriend like this?  What do you think.

Is it odd at times.  The part where Monica is in the...house of ill repute with that guy...was kind of wierd.  Also one thing that kept stabbing me while watching this film, Clive Owen must have stunk.  He nevers showers, lives in an abandoned factory with rats and wears rags for clothes.  Just a thought I wanted to share.

Should you pay a fortune for this movie.  No, in fact you probably can stream this from mutiple (legit) sources right now.  Well, that's my two cents worth.  FYI, this actually rented really good when it first came out on DVD, people were fans of it for a while.

Watch this solo with a plate of nachos and enjoy.  Don't forget to pick out something your girlfriend likes too.  In fact forget seeing a movie in, take her to see that new Zach Efron movie...",1335484800,2,1499,4.503731343283582
3234530,1,B000XA5K4I,"For me, this wasn't amusing in the least. No, wait, Paul Giamatti's comb-over and menacing leer was funny, but nothing else was. You could not pay me enough to suffer through this crapola again.",1333756800,,194,4.735294117647059
3234531,5,B000XA5K4I,"What a wonderful piece of mind candy.  Just remember, this movie is a spoof -- a comedy.  A carrot-chomping, dark-souled hero (Clive Owen) who was national pistol champion at age ten?  Of course he's got to win against each and every bad guy.  Thus, with his first wave of thugs destroyed, the evil-doer (Paul Giamatti) hears that it's only going to be possible to scrape together another ""fifty"" to finish off the lone hero.

As something maybe akin to mockumentary, ""Shoot 'Em Up"" takes what's real from the action thriller genre and creates a brilliant parody.  The action scenes, chases, gun-bursts, and all the effects seem as though they belong.  We might expect Charles Bronson, Steven Seagal, or Vin Diesel to appear at any moment.  Instead, Clive Owen carries the day, stuffing more than one baddie with a quick carrot through the brain.  Seriously!  Dozens more fall in various hails of gunfire or stunningly improvised booby traps.

A good many action-thriller cliches get taken over the top -- the bordello gunfights, the mutual redemption of the anti-hero and the fallen woman, a crusader politician who proves more than susceptible to betraying the cause, arms dealing, and the perpetual search for a truly safe hideout.

Of course, in this ""mock-u-thriller"" the love-making that seals the deal in the mutual redemption between our protagonists reaches its culmination in hail of gunfire with black-clad gunmen falling on all sides.  First, think Jack Nicholson's ""Triumph"" scene with Sally Struthers in ""Five Easy Pieces.""  Then, turn the scene into a Ninja attack and allow Clive Own to use an automatic rifle as he swirls Monica Bellucci to ecstasy. For the double-dealing politician, ""Shoot 'Em Up"" makes short work of the obligatory struggle on the chartered airliner.  Clive Owen pretty quickly takes the politician hostage, holding off Paul Giamatti and assorted thugs just long-enough to get into the cargo hold, where he plugs his hostage between the eyes and jumps into an extraordinary sky-diving gunfight, thus creating yet another labor shortage in the thug market.

A few last takes on these mock-u-thriller touches:  The tank on display in a military exhibition provides the safe house for Monica Bellucci and the infant, who is the real target of the thugs.  The ""not-airlines-trains-ships-buses"" escape for Bellucci and the child is cunningly labeled the bus to ""Wherever.""  Clive Owen stays behind to kill off a final wave of thugs, the ""super boss,"" and Paul Giamatti  The happy reunion bringing Clive Owen, Monica Bellucci, and their adopted infant back together takes place in the roadside restaurant where Bellucci and the infant have gone to ground -- in the midst of foiling a robbery attempt by a gang of seriously armed thugs.

Clive Owen, Monica Bellucci, and Paul Giamatti are fabulous at carrying through straight-faced with their schtick.  What a treat.",1328832000,3,2897,5.1191489361702125
3234532,2,B000XA5K4I,"This is a very over the top action shooter, and it knows that and pokes fun at it along the way. Basically you have this tough guy protecting a baby that a ton of people want dead and this introduces him to very outrageous events along the way.

The choreography of the people fighting each other is top notch with some cool kills. While there are cool kills, you have a lot of stuff in the movie that looks so obviously fake, and this takes you straight out of the movie. I have never seen so many different guns in a movie. Ever. Mr. Smith is always picking up guns from the people he has killed, so you get to see a lot of different guns being used from revolvers, handguns, shotguns, sub-machine guns, and so much more

Clive Owen brings his A game to this movie, and he really shines through this movie. From his amusing one liners to him reacting to every day scenarios we face. The gun sound effects are really good, and each gun has its only personality that is brought to life via the unique sounds each one makes. The soundtrack isn't too bad, but with a movie that's about the kills and over the top action, music doesn't really need to be Emmy winning.

The special features are pretty cool, with behind the scenes footage runs about 50 minutes long. Along with that, The animatics the director made years ago is included and its about 20 minutes long of rough drawings, but still cool to think he just decided to make this as a pitching tool.

If you like to watch movies with over the top action and some funny diaoluge, than this is the movie for you.
Note to PC Users: If you watch movies on your pc do NOT get this movie. I was not able to run the movie, you are forced to install the Interactual Player, and I highly advise against that since this program messes up your computer (From my experience with it). This is inexcusable sicne I have watched other movies that offer for you to install the Interactual program, but still lets you watch the movie in Windows media player. So I recommend passing on this movie if all you use is a computer.

Monica Bellucci [The Maxtrix Reloaded] is as lovely as ever, but is relegated to an on-screen sex object.  Without giving away a spoiler, she has one action scene with Clive that is unique and leaves quite an impression.  This is not a movie to watch with a significat other for ""Date Night"".  It has been proudly added to my DVD rack section of ""Man Movies"" of which I'm sure my wife will never violate.  If you like a lot of shooting [like ""Last Man Standing""] then this movie is for you.  This comes with my highest recommendation!",1318982400,2,901,4.546583850931677

It is obvious that this movie is meant to be more of a comedy and a spoof of action movies than a true action movie. However I do not think this is the kind of movie to be making political statements about the 2nd amendment as the main character shoots everything and everyone he sees from beginning to end. I know the director has freedom of speech but the contradiction is a little weird. Like the people who are against eating meat but they still wear leather shoes and leather belts. Okay I am finished.

Owen also gets his prostitute girlfriend, Monica Bellucci, involved in the action.  Owen and Giamatti are terrific.  Bellucci is a perfectly gorgeous woman and one cannot take their eyes off her when she is on camera.
The picture and sound on the blu-ray are fine.  There is a four part documentary on the making of the film and deleted scenes with commentary by the writer/director.

The only reason why I rented this film was because I like to see Monica Bellucci films, but even she couldn't save this ridiculous ""tongue in cheek"" shoot `em up.

This is an action movie that manages to both make fun of the action genre hyperboles and, at the same time, deliver a string of explosive action sequences. Sure, the plot is not the most deep but it far from paper-thin and, anyway, these are 86min of your life you will be glad you spent having fun.

The Academy gave ...THE HURT LOCKER an Oscar and they passed over this movie!!? SHOOT 'EM UP deserves an Oscar for just two unforgettable scenes: the packaging-line shootout in Mr Smith's lair and the unique shootout/sex ballet. Now, throw in Paul Giammati's smart-ass one-liners and you have yourself a movie which is great fun to watch.

Giammati may try his hardest to be the usual scene-stealer yet Clive Owen is the one who really delivers this movie. I am sure when they watched this, the producers of the James Bond franchise were kicking themselves for going with...Daniel Craig.

Clive Owen is the reluctant hero who gets involved when he sees thugs with guns follow a very pregnant woman.  During the ensuing shootout, the woman dies and Owen is literally left holding the baby.  Owens lists the help of the gorgeous Monica Bellucci to help him care for the baby.

Paul Giamatti is brilliant as the the cold, ruthless, contract killer who is thwarted by Owen at every turn.  Contrast this with his role in Sideways and you come to appreciate what a great actor Giamatti is.  The subplot involving Giamatti's wife constantly calling to see when he is returning home to help celebrate her birthday is hilarious.  The rest of the movie involves Owen trying to piece together why Giamatti was hired to kill the baby and his mother.  Besides the humourous lines that Owens and Giamatti have, the plot is quite interesting, which makes this movie much more interesting than similar movies such as, for example, the Transporter.  The action sequences are over the top so be prepared to suspend reality and just enjoy the ride.  Highly reccomended.",1279411200,,1281,4.695067264573991
3234579,3,B000XA5K4I,"I went into SHOOT 'EM UP knowing nothing about it, and thinking, ""dang this is stupid"", prepared for the worst almost from the get-go.  Or so it seemed at first, before I figured out that this silly piece of fluff was SUPPOSED to be a parody, a satire, a comedy -- at least, I hope it wasn't supposed to be anything even remotely serious or dramatic. Not that it necessarily succeeds even in its silliness, as there's nothing much new here or really interesting besides the ridiculous kinetic velocity of the whole thing. Nobody has any time to breathe here, let alone sleep, use the bathroom or make love -- all of which are attempted, and interrupted in quite violent ways, thus ensuring the parody aspects....I think. Clive Owen gets a fair amount of criticism from some quarters, and while I don't think it's entirely deserved, in this case I would have liked to see someone with a little more humor, a glint in his eye and a light smirk in his delivery -- Timothy Dalton 15 years ago comes to mind as a perfect choice. I can't argue with Monica Bellucci, who really exists only as eye candy; Paul Giamatti is getting tiresome in these obnoxious, weaselly villain roles but I suspect he's doing exactly what he's supposed to be doing here, so kudos.

What surprised me the most is that for a big-budget action film everything looked so dirty and dank, even the exteriors, and that so many of the action sequences are so cramped and hard to follow. Never mind the ridiculousness of the plot; again, if it's a parody, we just have to accept Owen somehow getting into this huge arms manufacturer's HQ/warehouse and booby-trapping his own guns to use against him and his men. What we shouldn't have to accept is that it's hard to tell what's going on in nearly every scene where guns are in play (which is most scenes) and that the colors and lighting are so washed-out and ugly. I really thought this was shot on DV until looking up the specs here, and was astonished that the ace cinematographer behind such Hong Kong classics as THE KILLER and THE BRIDE WITH WHITE HAIR shot this; perhaps this is what was intended, but it sure didn't work for me.  Not sure why action films these days seem to all want to look simultaneously flashy and grungy; I guess somebody likes the aesthetic or it wouldn't be so common.

And yet, the goofiness of it all did keep me entertained for the (thankfully) short running time. The car chase sequence alone was almost worth the price of admission, at the very least worth a laugh and a ""oh they didn't do that did they? really?"" moment. It's hard for me to find something I haven't seen in an action film, and this offered a couple of brief bits of that, so it certainly wasn't a total loss. Watched theatrically on first release and again recently.  Certainly worth a look for connoisseurs of action cinema at it's most over-the-top and demented.",1278720000,3,2882,4.555984555984556

3234582,4,B000XA5K4I,"To say that this film is over the top at being over the top, would be as intellectually insightful as saying water is wet. There's not a single thing in this movie that can be taken seriously, despite the fact it's loaded with violence and adult themes, and therein lies the true charm of the spectacle.

Clive Owens plays the mystery man known only as ""Smith."" After he helps a women birth her child during a gunfight, he finds himself caught up in a web of outrageous political intrigue, with the baby's life, as well as his own, as the stakes.

This is basically a parody send up of every gun-blazing, ass-kicking, tough guy action film you've ever even heard about. Owens character never misses a shot (or the chance to chomp on some carrots), in shootouts that are not just overly exaggerated, but completely impossible, in many cases. You have Paul Giamatti as the sleazy hit-man out to get him and the baby, with Monica Bellucci simply providing eye-candy, as the milk-giving whore helping Smith to save the child. There isn't a single moment that you can really take any of this seriously, but the filmmakers know this and don't just fail to apologize for it, but actually revel in it.

The choreography in the gunfights is superb. If you could actually pull off some of the stunts shown here, I fully believe the real world would be as mindlessly violent as this film is. My favorite has to be the skydiving shootout, where physics and several universal laws of kinetic energy and gravity simply don't exist. This is to say nothing of the many machismo one-liners that are constantly thrown around throughout the film, which provide the perfect black humor to the massive amounts of killing going on. Of course, one can't forget the rocking soundtrack, complete with trashy metal sounds, from groups like Motley Crue and Motorhead, that only intensifies the sensation.

Is ""Shoot 'Em Up"" sexist? Yep. Is it somewhat homophobic? You betcha. Is it overly violent? Oh, hell yes! The film is all of that, as well as not having a single redeeming value within the whole product. Yet, despite all of this, it is still a rip-roaring, testosterone-fueled, slam-banging, out-of-control good time, that will charm it's way into your heart and have you quoting lines from it for days afterwards! If you are someone who's easily offended, or has delicate sensibilities, then this movie is one you probably should avoid. For everyone else, just sit back and watch the mindless carnage unfold. This is truly a guy's movie, for guys who like movies. And it is probably the guiltiest pleasure experience I've had in some time.",1272585600,,2619,4.787610619469026

3234584,4,B000XA5K4I,"Action-packed, adrenaline driven and all-out action is what you can expect from ""Shoot `Em Up"", a 2007 film directed by Michael Davis.

Sure, Davis wrote the 1994 video game based stinker ""Double Dragon"" but he did rebound with ""Eight Days a Week"" in 1997.  A decade later, Davis has crafted a film that is not only mindless action but it's the kind of action that is plenty of fun, never boring and on Blu-ray, it's a title that sports awesome picture quality and lossless audio.

Davis teams up with well-known martial arts cinematographer Peter Pau (""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", ""The Promise"", ""Perhaps Love"", ""The Forbidden Kingdom"") and composer Paul Haslinger (""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"", ""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"", ""Death Race"").

""Shoot `Em Up"" is an action comedy about a drifter named Mr. Smith (played by Clive Owen, ""Sin City"", ""The Boys Are Back"", ""The International"") who is waiting for his bus ride but sees a pregnant woman running away.  Next thing you know, a gun wielding man is after her.  At first, Smith wants nothing to do with it but decides last minute to help her out.

As the woman tries to defend herself with a gun, the man is about to kill her but the carrot chomping Mr. Smith quickly acts by stabbing the man with a carrot.  All of a sudden, the woman is giving birth and at the same time, more men have arrived with guns ablazing and Mr. Smith shows his excellent marksmanship and gun skills and takes many of them out and eventually helping the woman give birth to a baby boy.

We then see the man who is calling all the shots, a man named Hertz (played by Paul Giamatti, ""Sideways"", ""Cinderella Man"", ""Duplicity"") who doesn't seem too scared of Mr. Smith.  Smith knows he is in a bind without a weapon and thus he tries to get the woman and baby to safety but unfortunately the mother is killed.  Smith must decide to leave or take the baby with him and he decides to help the baby.

And next thing you know, Smith becomes a major target as everyone seems to be after the baby for some reason and will do anything to kill it.

Smith goes to the only person he knows to take care of the baby for a day while he tries to find out who the men chasing the baby are.  The woman is a prostitute named Donna (played by Monica Bellucci, ""The Passion of Christ"", ""Matrix Revolutions"", ""The Matrix Reloaded"") who has no interest in helping Mr. Smith at all.

As Smith leaves, it appears that the men who are after the baby are always a step behind in finding it.  But this time, they have traced Smith and the baby at the whorehouse and immediately Hertz starts to scare and torture Donna for information on Mr. Smith (which she knows nothing).  Fortunately, Smith is able to rescue her in time but now, Mr. Smith, Donna and the baby are on the run from Hertz and his men who will do whatever it takes to kill him and the baby.

Will Smith find out why the baby is a target?  Will he be able to protect both the baby and Donna?

VIDEO:

""Shoot `Em Up"" looks fantastic on Blu-ray.  Presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1 aspect ratio), the film tends to be saturated with focus on a few colors as you can see blues, greens, blacks, orange and reds being the primary colors of the film.  You literally can see the detail and the hair stubble, the skin pores and the grime on Mr. Smith, you can see the overall grittiness of the city and for the most part, detail is captured quite well on Blu-ray.

Blacks are nice and deep, I see no artifacts, DNR (Digital Noise Reduction) or any problems with the picture quality.  This is literally perfection when it comes to PQ for a film on Blu-ray and ""Shoot `Em Up"" looks absolutely fantastic.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Shoot `Em Up"" is presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and what an incredible lossless soundtrack this film is presented with.  For one thing, this is an action film that just doesn't show signs of any long moments of inactivity.  There is just action throughout with maybe a brief segment of dialogue and then more action.  And the keyword to describe this 7.1 lossless soundtrack is ""immersive"".  Gunshots, bullets whizzing, car crashing, you name it...you hear it all around you.  From sound effects, footsteps, the music, the baby crying, there is just a feeling of sound that envelops your soundscape and for audiophiles, you will more than likely gush with this soundtrack.

Subtitles are presented in English SDH and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

JUDGMENT CALL:

What an enjoyable ride has ""Shoot `Em Up"" turned out to be.

In some way, the film could have gone the ""Leon the Professional"" direction but instead of being a drama, ""Shoot `Em Up"" ends up being an action comedy as the film showcases Mr. Smith taking out dozens of people with his quick gun skills and excellent marksmanship.  He loves chomping on carrots, loves his guns and shows sign of being quite an intelligent man.  We don't know his background, but we know that he kicks major butt!

And the film is pretty much representative of the fact that Mr. Smith is just the epitome of a man who can kick some serious tail.  Your eyes are literally glued to the screen as there is a sense of choreography when Smith shoots his enemies but you add the sexy Monica Belluci and these two literally set off sparks in the film.  One of the most hilarious and sexiest moments of the film are when Smith and Donna are making love and as he is doing his thing, he is taking on the bad guys while having sex, while Donna is enjoying every minute of it.

Another hilarious scene features a mother spanking her child.  Mr. Smith not liking the mother punishing her child in that manner, starts spanking the mother and telling her if she likes how that feels.

And there are many of these enjoyable and fun moments of the film but at the same time, the film has its sense of B-movie gore as we see carrots gouging a man's head through the eye socket to body part dismemberments throughout the film.

The film is a violent, action-packed film but all its violence and humor just works for this film and definitely enhances the enjoyment of it.  Granted, I'm sure there are some people who may balk about how the baby is put through many violent situations throughout the film but this is an action comedy with farfetched situations. There is no realism, this is all crazy entertainment that resembles the experience of  playing a one player action/adventure video game shooter and instead of you controlling the character and picking people out, Mr. Smith does that for you.

As mentioned, the Blu-ray sports awesome picture quality and lossless audio.  I was very impressed by this Blu-ray release and the fact that you can find it for a pretty good price these days is great.

Overall, if you are looking for an action film full of non-stop action and humor with less focus on the drama, then definitely check out ""Shoot `Em Up"".  Definitely a Blu-ray worthy of being in your collection if you are interested in an action comedy film with mindless violence!  Prepare yourself for one wild and crazy ride with ""Shoot `Em Up"".  A film that is definitely recommended!",1271721600,3,8971,4.661998726925525

The only ones who would think this would be possibly entertaining would be people who get off on watching people get shot.  No suspense at all. Just mindless shooting. Would not recommend this movie. It went straight in the trash !.

He's far from a doctor and farther from a parent, but when he unwittingly discovers an innocent woman delivering a baby right in the middle of a gunfight, Smith enters the fray to save her and though the woman expires, he is the one left in care of the orphaned child. He thinks that the killers were after the woman, but soon he realizes that they had a far more unlikely target: the baby. Smith's regular company is a seedy underworld full of unsavory characters, so he takes the child to the closest thing he knows to a mother: a sultry prostitute. This movie is pure action fun - not much in the way of literary devices, no insight, no meaningful pauses. It is meant to be one thing - an adrenaline rush. But to enjoy it to the fullest, you must suspend reality and just take it in as it comes. It will be gory, it will be fantastic, it will be on orgy of bullets, but most importantly, it will bring you to the edge of your seat. So watch this movie, but watch it at face value, a beautifully straightforward action movie.",1261008000,,1099,4.288461538461538
3234593,4,B000XA5K4I,"Shoot 'em Up (Michael Davis, 2007)

I knew I was going to love Shoot 'em Up about thirty seconds into the movie, when we first see Smith (Clive Owen), the film's protagonist, and he's sitting at a bus stop looking all badass and...eating a carrot. That was my first clue that this is not your mama's action film, and boy, is it ever. Ever not. Something like that. In any case, what it turns out to be is a hilarious, and brilliant, sendup of every genre clich&eacute; there is, while still being the most satisfying action movie I've seen this year, if not longer. I'm just going off the top of my head here, but I think this is my favorite action movie since Dead or Alive: Final. And that's saying something.

In any case, after an opening scene where a lot of things blow up in a very amusing manner, it comes to pass that Smith finds himself in charge of a baby and on the run from a gang led by a nasty sort named Hertz (Paul Giamatti). Smith needs to find some way to feed the kid, so he enlists the help of a reluctant prostitute (Monica Bellucci) who's currently lactating. The rest of the movie involves the three of them dodging a whole lot of bullets while Smith tries to figure out what Hertz and all the gangsters he can enlist are after this kid. (I'm not even going to hint at it, because when I say this movie is brilliant, I mean it. Amazing plotting here.)

Davis (Monster Man), who also wrote the screenplay, fires on all cylinders here. Everything is well-done, and everything integrates well--the strong character development, the comic timing, the plot and its twists, the amazing acting (aside from the top dogs, the movie also features such excellent, and in many cases underrated, actors as Julian Richings, David Ury, Daniel Pilon, and especially Stephen McHattie, whose very name attached to any movie in the past ten years, seemingly, turns it to gold), all the subtle (and not-so-subtle, viz. The hysterical love scene) jabs at other action films. Leave your belief at the door; this is as over-the-top as they come, and it's supposed to be. If you passed it by when it came out because you're not an action movie fan, give it a go now; it's well worth your time. *** ",1260489600,3,2198,4.4875

Also, the end of the movie reveals the entire plot, if you can call it a plot, is about a man (Clive Owen) shooting hundreds of people in an attempt to assist an anti-second amendment agenda.

3234598,5,B000XA5K4I,"Shoot 'em Up (2007) is an outrageously slick action flick, which seems to slide seamlessly between scenes jammed with amazing stunts, violence, and gunfire.  Writer and director Michael Davis, wanted his film to be 'guncentric', all about the heavy duty use of firearms, and except for the judicious use of a certain hard orange vegetable, that is pretty much what he has done.

In a wild opening sequence, Mr. Smith (Clive Owen) intervenes to in plot to kill a pregnant woman, and by the end of it, dead bodies are strewn everywhere, Smith has delivered a baby, had a face to face meeting with top baddie Mr. Hertz (Paul Giamatti), done some wild sliding, some high flying, and has a new best buddy.  And that's just the beginning of an outrageously entertaining contest, between the quick-tempered and unstoppable Smith, and the ultra annoying, intuitive, ex-FBI 'forensic behavior consultant', turned killer, Hertz.  Along the way, pieces of the puzzle start to fall in place, in a cartoonlike story that is uberbizarre.

In need of a babysitter, Smith turns to Donna Quintano (Monica Bellucci), a hooker who's specialty is servicing those with a lactation fetish.  ""DQ"" is soon forced to team up with Smith, after Hertz and his soldiers show up, looking for the boy.  Hertz is damn hard to kill, has uncanny tracking ability, and an almost unlimited supply of men.  The story has so many wicked twists, with shootout following inventive shootout.  The situations, setups, and stunts, just keep coming, and get more and more intense, peaking when Smith take a dive from a plane, and engages in an insanely exciting, and delightful gunbattle in the air.

Hertz's annoying face appears once more, and this time Smith gets his fingers snapped like a bunch of carrots, but still won't reveal where the boy, now called 'Oliver' is.  When Hertz decides to get 'invasive', it's time for another miraculous escape, one that features a crazy and painful method for firing a bullet.  The finale in a Dairy Queen, shows Smith finding another way to employ that hard orange vegetable.

If  you want a killer action flick that just never stops, Shoot 'em Up is definitely one of best in recent years.  Michael Davis had been doing smaller films, but this project proves the big time is where he belongs.  Davis provides an interesting, informative, and almost non-stop commentary track.  He repeatedly says that different things were included in the film, just because it 'made him laugh'.  There are some cool featurettes covering the making of the film, including the use of robotic stand-in babies.  Most movies do not live up to the hype, but this is the rare exception, and it may just make you laugh too.",1255392000,,2700,4.881578947368421

I only want to see movies that are original and I only want to see things done in movies for the first time - making it the MOST original. I'd never own a movie because I would have to see something I've already seen more than once. Talking in a movie - seen it! Shooting in a movie - seen it! Babies in a movie - seen it!

I turned this movie off after 4-seconds (which I'm representing here with my 4-star review) because I've already seen what they were showing - and there was no proper context - and it made me so mad that I snapped the DVD in half and shouted at my television set for one-half hour!

3234606,3,B000XA5K4I,"""Shot them up"" is a smart parody, a funny evasion movie that must be seen only under these circumstances. The laughable plot simply is an artifice that works as huge back up for (How would we say?) the imaginative, amusing and certainly original sequences, car chases, aerial maneuvers and bizarre devices to face a devilish criminal web of conflicts and interests between a Senator and a bunch of ruthless gangsters. Clive Owen embodies the accurate blend of three well known personages of action since the seventies until the nineties: James Bond, Rambo and the officer Mac Lane, spiced with a touch of ""Sin city.""

At last instance , the movie seems to extracted from a script from Cohen brothers Quentin Tarrantino and Robert Rodriguez, , due the rampant audacious and the febrile kinetic energy displayed all the way through.

Violence and black humor in great doses, but besides, maternal love around a baby who seems to be quiet with the rock music works out as a mesmerizing feast for all those who seek to mesmerize themselves around the special effects universe.

But please; don't try to find out a minimal sense in this surrealistic movie. It's just another way to escape from the quotidian reality in which we are immersed and nothing, nothing else.",1246579200,,1262,4.88785046728972

Clive Owen is well suited as the carrot eating, unstoppable killing machine who inadvertently becomes the protector of an infant who's mother is killed by dirt bags and want this baby! Paul Giamatti gives a equally colorful and humorous performance as the head dirt bag.

It's over the top, totally unbelievable, physically impossible, but absolutely brilliant all at the same time.

Clive Owen eats a lot of carrots and values his privacy. There are many things that he absolutely hates, and he comes into contact with most of these things when he unwillingly gets involved in a plot to kill a very pregnant young woman. Suddenly faced with a nanny job, he shoots his way out of the frying pan and into the fire, each scenario more jaw-dropping-ly impossible than the last. Paul Giamatti plays an unlikely criminal mastermind and Monica Bellucci is under-utilized in but she sizzles as the proverbial professional girl with a heart of gold. Things get political, and hopelessly complicated, and of course there's lots and lots (and lots) of shooting, during any (and I do mean ANY) situation. Four Stars!

****  Out of 5

Release Date- September 7th, 2007

Running Time- 86-Minutes

Rating- R

Writer/Director- Michael Davis

Starring- Clive Owen, Paul Giamatti, Monica Bellucci, Stephen McHattie, Daniel Pilon

Shoot `Em Up is one of those movies you'll either love or hate; you'll sit there watching it and be entertained or roll your eyes at the extremely over the top action scenes. Make no mistake about it Shoot `Em Up features some of the most over the top action scenes ever captured on films. In the past I have written negative reviews on movies like this, but like I said in those reviews it's all about how it's done. Why does it work well in others and ruin other movies? I'm not quite sure, but these crazy and over the top action scenes work really well here at least for me and I was entertained from the start.

This movie totally lives up to it's name with action and more action; any lulls in the action sequences don't last long and while the plot for Shoot `Em Up is a little thin it's also good enough to make up for the breaks in the action. I'm a very harsh critic of the action genre these days. Since the Michael Bay era started action movies got worse and worse; it's gotten to the point to where I barley watch American action movies anymore. When done right like in Kill Bill and Rambo the action genre can still pack a punch, but more often than not they lack and I'm reminded why I don't bother with action flicks, but than Shoot `Em Up comes around and reminds why I love these movies.

The screenplay by Michael Davis is filled with silly dialogue all intentional of course and filled with some really crazy action scenes. But yet the script works well and the characters are excellent, which is also thanks to the actors selling it. The plot isn't that strong and mostly just a set up for the action, but Shoot `Em Up is a lot better written than I thought it would be. It's often funny and has some really cool characters.

Michael Davis also directs and the pace is always moving forward any lulls in the action scenes are brief. The action starts in the opening and each time out they're just as exciting as the last. Like I said the action sequences are really crazy and over the top, which can sometimes ruin a movie, but to the credit of Michael Davis he really makes it work well and makes it so much fun. I think Davis, makes one of the better action flicks of the decade. Michael Davis is able to craft one hell of a fun ride.

In the era of not only poor action movies we are also in an era of really poor action stars, while there are a couple of good ones, most of these so called action stars are pathetic, but where they all fail Clive Owen succeeds. Simply put Clive Owen has one of the coolest characters in recent memory and he totally sells it and makes for one of the top action stars in a long time. I think with more action flicks Clive Owen can really make a name for himself as one of the very best.

The supporting cast is excellent with Monica Bellucci has the talent to match her looks and Paul Giamatti just simply rocks. Despite starring in some Oscar nominated movies, which includes an Oscar, win for Giamatti, plus numerous awards nominations (and some wins) he really is such an underrated actor. Not enough people are talking about this guy and he is truly a talented actor and he rocks in Shoot `Em Up and works great with Clive Owen.

Bottom line is this; Shoot `Em Up is a crazy over the top movie and you'll either love it or hate it. I thought this one was a blast, but it's not for everyone.

The Blu-ray release is top notch with an excellent picture and even better sound. This is the perfect movie on Blu-ray. Features include a commentary track plus an excellent making of and trailers.",1232582400,4,3771,4.351851851851852
3234623,3,B000XA5K4I,"This movie was as absurd as I expected it to be.  I knew the plot would be silly, and that the action would be implausible.  All of this was OK by me, and for the most part this film delivered.  I liked it.

Strangely, the film-makers opted to make a stand on the issue of GUN CONTROL.  They like gun control...A LOT.  Even though the hero mows down legions of baddies with his trusty pistols (and vegetables), he too is staunchly pro-GUN CONTROL.  I won't give the story away, but he performs an act in the film with the express purpose of ensuring that strong gun control measures will be enacted.

3234629,1,B000XA5K4I,I watched this movie the other day with my friends and it feels like some very bad video game where one guy is invincible.

3234631,5,B000XA5K4I,"""Shoot 'Em Up"" is a straight-faced over-the-top parody of the action movie genre.  Profoundly silly one-liners after shooting a guy?  Check.  No backstory about our cookie-cutter characters?  Got it.  An overly convoluted plot that makes no sense at all?  Yep.  The ability of the hero to run away from 10 guys shooting at him a close range?  Check.  And stunts that would kill a regular human being 10 times over, from which the hero walks away?  About every 5 minutes.

Where most action movies present these elements and expect us to swallow them, ""Shoot 'Em Up"" goes so far over the top that it flings those elements, and others, right in the audience's face as part of its bone-dry parody.  I think that's why this movie is so polarizing - whether you like this kind of thing is a matter of taste.  For example, whether you find a pro-gun-control gunfighting hero to be head-scratching or funny as heck will depend completely on your sense of humor.

For this film to work, Owen and Giamatti had to own their characters completely, as ridiculous as they were, and they definitely did so.  The pace has to keep moving so you don't stop and think about the details too much, and it certainly did.  At 90 minutes, this film is just long enough.

The irony is that ""Shoot 'Em Up,"" even as a parody of the genre, is a superior example of the genre.  It's at least worth a rent, particularly if you have Blu-Ray - the Blu-Ray transfer is fantastic.",1221436800,4,1447,4.542635658914729

But I watched it again with the audio commentary by writer/director Michael Davis. He pointed out some of the elements that I had missed, and my interest picked up.

The jerry-rigged plot has Mr. Smith (ably portrayed by Clive Owen) injecting himself into a conspiracy to murder a very pregnant woman. Hordes of heavily armed bad guys are hunting her. Smith ends up caring for her newborn child. The movie becomes a series of gunfights in which some 130 (according to the commentary) bad guys fall to Smith's super-sharp shooting. The gun battles contain elements drawn from James Bond, Dirty Harry, Lethal Weapon, and the countless other flicks that feature a good guy who can shoot taking on legions of bad guys who can't. On top of this, Davis makes it all surreal by developing fantastic scenarios with a Rube Goldberg twist.

The stunning Monica Bellucci adds a certain ... warmth as she plays a lactating prostitute who really cares. She proves with Mr. Smith that people can attain a satisfying climax under the most trying conditions. Paul Giamatti is the heavy (Hertz) who reminds me of Orson Welles gone to seed.

There are some disgusting elements like a graphic depiction of what could happen when a gun falls into a filthy toilet and Hertz's ""interaction"" with a corpse.

In my opinion, if you take away a few disgusting scenes and tighten up the plot, this becomes a great movie.",1220745600,,1547,4.718518518518518

He has to work overtime to stave off embarrassment.  But, then, Clive can pick and choose his own projects so you can't imagine what drew him to this one.  Paul Giamatti lays an egg as the film's heavy.  Be careful, Paul, or people will forget that you made good flicks like ""American Splendor"" and ""Sideways"".  Monica Bellucci as the requisite femme fatale is the only performer here to make a visceral impact.  The hilarious love-making scene between her and Owen is about the only time this film engaged me.

3234637,5,B000XA5K4I,"Shoot 'em Up is an over-the-top homage to 25+ years of action movies. Mr. Smith (Clive Owen) is a carrot-munching stranger who just happens to observe a pregnant woman being hunted down by a bunch of thugs.  He springs into action, killing the thugs and saving the baby, but losing the mom.  As is instantly apparent, Smith is no ordinary hero--he is a Special Ops killing machine who just happens to be at the wrong place at the right time.  The rest of the movie involves Smith trying to get the baby to safety and unravel the mystery of what is going on.  All the while he is pursued by the relentless & evil Mr. Hertz (Paul Giamatti), who, in Smith, has inexplicably found an adversary that matches him.

This movie is loads of fun, but is definitely not to be take seriously.  It somehow manages to glorify gun violence while preaching gun control.  To achieve this feat, the writers squeeze in every cliche imaginable (for example: not only was Smith's family murdered, he unknowingly sold the guns to the man who killed them).  Despite the cartoonish nature of the violence (especially Mr. Smith's lethal skills), both Owen and Giamatti are great in their roles and some of the lines they deliver are instant classics.  Giamatti is surprisingly effective as the hen-pecked bad guy, a welcome turn from his traditional roles.  All in all, a great movie to watch if you're willing to stop thinking for 90 minutes or so.  Its also a great advertisement for the benefits of eating carrots (which I've started doing).",1220227200,4,1519,4.694339622641509
3234638,3,B000XA5K4I,"It contains OUTRAGEOUSLY UNBELIEVABLE ACTION SCENES. For example in one scene, Clive Owen shot his hand gun continously with a carrot pressed down on the trigger!

3234640,2,B000XA5K4I,"What is it with Clive Owen and his choice of films to do? He was great in The Croupier and interesting as an assassin the first Bourne film, but here and in several other films (I'll Sleep When I'm Dead) he just isn't believable as a dumb, sadistic, violent guy--he's too smart to play that.

Here in Shoot em Up his character has no back story; his action scenes are fine but too unbelievable to be more than 'cartoonish', and his gorgeous love interest (Monic Bellucci) seems way too smart to be with such a simple 'thug'.

Add to the continuous action a bad guy (Paul Giamatti) who also seems unbelievable and you've got a mindless waste of time. And one more thing; this movie has a scene of nudity that is really disgusting and should have been cut--and I'm not speaking of any scene involving Monica Bellucci.",1218758400,2,815,4.5
3234641,3,B000XA5K4I,"A no brainer action movie if taken as that is fun to watch. I would have given it three and a half stars if I could have since I enjoyed it more than ""Chaos"". I have certainly seen far worse action movies. Afterall this one doesn't take itself seriously and that gives it a leg up over those that do. Clive Owen as always is quite entertaining. How he eliminates a couple enemies with carrots not to mention some of the shooting stunts should impress and amuse you. This may not have the depth of ""Inside Man"", but it was not meant to either. It was meant to be fun plain and simple. The story centers around our hero trying to save a pregnant woman. He manages to save her long enough to have her baby but then he can only save the baby from the government and criminal types so intent on their death. The mystery he unravels as to why has some depth of thought. This is a fast paced movie and most fans of action movies should enjoy it. Good quality DVD with fair replayability. If you enjoyed this catch ""Kill Bill"" and ""Hitman"".

3234642,4,B000XA5K4I,"I'm the first to admit that this movie isn't for everyone.  You can tell from the reviews here how polarized the viewing audience is.  For what it's worth, if this movie appeals to you, you will enjoy it immensely.  If not, you'll hate it.  There's not a lot of middle ground.

The movie is ultra-violent, yes, but in a cartoon violence way (if Bugs Bunny were R-rated that is)  It's over-the-top, extreme, and comical.  Yes, comical.  Some of the kills are outright silly and laughable.  That's what defines this movie.

The action is incredibly well choreographed.  The scene involving the stairwell is just simply the most amazing action scene I think I've ever seen in a movie.

Will you like the movie?  I don't know.  But give it a try.  You might despise it, and that would be understandable.  I hated Sin City but love this, so go figure.  I recognize the artistry behind it but don't actually like the movie.  For Shoot 'Em Up, I loved both.

At the very least, even if you hate the movie, find the scene where Clive Owen is complaining about another driver not using his turn signal.  That scene is laugh out loud funny and well worth seeking out in the movie!",1218412800,,1170,4.507177033492823

Folks, the price is right for a copy of the DVD (which I'm purchasing - tonight!)  Get yourself a copy, don't take it too seriously and you'll have a good time.

Oh, yes...my critique on the actors in this movie:

1. Clive Owen - Given what he had to work with - he does a good job!
2. Paul Giamati - An outstanding (and intelligent) bad guy - he's always thinking - just try to keep up with him...
3. Monica Bellucci - She only does a few scenes, but oh, boy!  She's still looking outstanding after all these years.  Hopefully, she'll receive more offers to do American features (America - you have no idea what you are missing!  Yes, I am a Bellucci Fan...)

That's high praise coming from me; as a science fiction fan I'd put ""Snow Crash"" in the same category, and any fans of that book know what a high accolade that is.

See this film for its brilliant action sequences, extremely satisfying send-up of the whole shoot-em-up category, and delightful acting by all the major performers.  Clive Owen was already one of my favorites, but his brooding, angry, carrot-obsessed marksmanship in this film puts him over the top.

And the writer & director both deserve mad props.  By the time it gets to literally raining badguys at the end, you're whooping, laughing uncontrollably, or both.  Truly brilliant!",1217721600,,821,4.780141843971631

- Most importantly, it's nothing BUT shooting, shooting, and more shooting.  It's supposed to be a shooter, and delivers huge.

- Many people tend to ignore how much creativity is involved making each scene loaded with tons of interesting ways to shoot the bad guys.  Seriously, watch carefully every single shooting segment in this movie, and try telling me it's not the most creative and interesting way to make a shooter.

Come on, the main character is practically bouncing off walls killing bad guys left, right up and down.  This kind of stuff rules, and it probably takes a lot of time for the writers to find new ways to make shooting someone look different from the shooting scenes in other movies.",1217635200,,912,4.8076923076923075

The other reason to watch this modern film noir cum comic movie is Italian Goddess Monica Bellucci, who amazingly, plays a hooker with a heart of gold - yet again!

Clive Owen doesn't have a real sense of humour though - he often reminds me of Timothy Dalton doing James Bond: serious and all business, without a hint of irony - a bloke's bloke.

*Despite being unbelievable and incredibly over-the-top, there are plenty of fun, zany action scenes that entertain.  Plenty of bloody violence (for those who like bloody violence).
*It's also not entirely brutal and bloody.  There is some compassion and romance to it as well (after all, this whole thing is about a guy protecting a baby from harm).
*Filming style is pretty good.  It's a little rough and gritty, but not overwhelmingly jittery or anything.
*Acting is great.  Clive Owen is entirely memorable.  Monica Bellucci is awesome.
*Some fun dialogue.
*Great music.

The Bad Things
*Weak story, with lots of strange, contrived twists.

The Questionable Things
*As said above, it's unbelievable and over-the-top.  It can either be seen as stylish and fun, or stupid.
*A bit vulgar.  Expect some swearing, lots of bloody violence, and some strange sexuality.

It's brainless, tasteless, and highly unbelievable.  At the same time, it's stylish, cool, and entertaining.  Like some kind of cartoon, this is a good simple movie to put in and enjoy for action fans who don't want to think excessively or worry about realism.

3234664,4,B000XA5K4I,"If you intend to watch this movie the first rule (and you really must adhere to it) is DO NOT TAKE ANYTHING IN THIS MOVIE SERIOUSLY. If you forget that part, then you might as well turn off the tv. Trust me.

Ah, what to say, what to say....this is one of those mindless action movies full of death and destruction, where the guns have many more bullets than logically possible, the hero is -- heroic, the leading lady is a knockout (kudos to whomever is responsible for hiring Monica Bellucci in this roll. It was refreshing to see an incredibly gorgeous woman over the age of 40 and she was terrific in it) and the main villian, Paul Giamatti, is very good.

In fact, I was truly amazed in the calibre of acting in this type of movie. Like Star Troopers of yore, none of the bad guys -- and there are hundreds -- can shoot worth a darn, while the good guy fells them right and left...and back and forth.. and so on. Can we just agree there is a LOT of violence in this thing.  A ragged story line exists, but is slapped around by the shear amount of action, not to mention the almost psychic ability of Giamatti in finding Owen and Bellucci every few minutes no matter where they run.

This is a popcorn and friends type movie. I wouldn't recommend it for the kiddies by any means, but if you're into truly unbelievable action, then you might have some fun with this one.

I give it 4 stars: 3 for the fun, 1 just for Monica Bellucci.",1212364800,,1436,4.245421245421245
3234665,5,B000XA5K4I,"What can you really say about a movie like this? It definitely lives up to its name. People get shot. Big time. Is it more or less plotless? Yes. Is it completely over-the-top? Yes. Is it kind of a symbol of everything that's wrong with our society? You bet. It's also ridiculously entertaining. People get killed with vegetables! Clive Owen delivers a baby and then severs the umbilical cord with a pistol shot! People jump out of planes and get chopped up by helicopter blades! Paul Giamatti gets shot - and then gets shot again - and then gets shot again - and doesn't die! Monica Bellucci gets naked! (My husband liked that part the best, obviously).

The amazing thing to me was that three talented people who have all done serious dramatic work really threw themselves into their roles and gave the movie everything they had - especially Clive Owen. His one-liners make the movie and his deadpan humor adds a lot of entertainment value. The other great thing about this movie is that it knows exactly how over-the-top it is. Jackie Chan has been getting laughs off totally implausible stunts for forever - why does he get a patent on that kind of entertainment? I honestly laughed harder at this movie, and enjoyed it more, than anything else I've seen in a long time. This movie is a great antidote to all the dumb movies out there that take themselves way, WAY too seriously. This is not the movie for anyone who even mildly squeamish - has even a mild problem with violence - or is uncomfortable with graphic sex. Also probably not recommended for lovers of all things highbrow. If those things don't bother you, and you love a good stupid-fun movie - then definitely, this is the movie to see.",1211846400,,1703,4.6019736842105265

This is one of the funniest satires I have ever seen. Hands down.

""Shoot 'Em Up"" does not have in depth characters, it IS SUPPOSED TO BE misogynistic, and if you try to take it seriously for one second..... you're going to hate it. Watch this film when you need a good laugh. The dialog is hysterical. Every scene from start to finish is completely ""Over the Top"", but still executed with big budget precision. The acting is absolutely dead on perfect. I think it was marketed very badly, and THAT'S why it did poorly at the box office.

Get over it, pansies!

This is not ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" ""Dr. Strangelove,"" ""The Bicycle Thief,"" or ""Casabalanca"" (all admittedly fantastic movies, all five-star classics, and I love them all dearly).

It is a fun time for those who have a working sense of wit--NOT humor, because any lowborn mutt has a sense of humor, but of actual wit--and who, say, likes an action movie populated with people as opposed to robots that turn into cars. (Seriously, if you like ""Transformers"" and didn't like this, you're a moron, and there's no argument brooked about it.)

Furthermore, it does have certain Western-movie overtones that reminded me of something Vladimir Nabokov wrote about Hollywood films: to the effect that in American Westerns, you can see hundreds of people get shot, but ""you're not sorry! You're not sorry for any one of them!"" This is how ""Shoot 'Em Up"" proceeds: most of those who get shot and killed richly, RICHLY deserve to be sent to the next life or, as I would tend to believe, to oblivion. And this is from an avid opponent of the government death penalty.

Furthermore, it is the first film, in my memory, that effectively used the classic Motorhead track ""Ace of Spades"" in a gunfight sequence. Neither Tarantino nor Rodriguez was THAT clever and smart about music.",1208649600,,1379,4.801687763713081

I knew Clive Owen would do good here, if his stint in ""Sin City"" was any indicator. For those who didn't like this film, you take yourselves and this film, too seriously! Sure, there were stunts that absolutely defy the laws of physics, armed goons who couldn't hit the broad side of a barn with a machine gun (and some of them DID have machine guns!), not to mention a bulletproof baby with a penchant for headbanging music,along with the ubiquitous hooker with a heart of gold, but hey, what were you expecting? Just by the LOOK of the cover art, this couldn't have been anything else!

All the principles played their parts to the hilt! Clive Owen, it seems, came from the Steve McQueen school of acting. Monica Belucci is as gorgeous as ever, and Paul Giamatti played Owens' foil perfectly! The guns. MY GAAWWD! The guns were all over the place (I bet the Anti-Gunners were beside themselves), and the carrots. I'll bet Owen never wants to see another carrot for the rest of his life!

3234682,4,B000XA5K4I,"""Shoot 'Em Up"" ranks up there with ""Crank"" in the terms of style over substance.  The difference between the two is that ""Shoot 'Em Up's"" style IS the substance.

The film opens up with Clive Owen getting in the middle of a gunfight between a pregnant woman and some bad guys.  From there, it just takes off into a violent, well, shoot em up film, full of stylistic gun fights culled from the likes of John Woo and probably owes more than a good share to the Hong Kong action film scene, complete with fun one-liners and rather unusual uses for carrots.

Just don't expect much of a plot.  There is one, but it plays secondary to the way this film is shot.  The film seems based on a sort of gag or rather oddball situation: a very well trained fighter good with guns is trying to protect a baby.  The violence and gunplay throughout the film is like watching a very wicked cartoon.

Clive Owen's character does all sorts of fun stuff.  This is why you're watching the movie.  The favorie of the film makers seems to be Owen sliding through many scenes while shooting his assailants.  This includes sliding through across the floor, under bathroom stalls,and oh from out of a car into a van.

Owen's character is the fun sorta anti hero.  He's something of a drifter.  We don't have much of his history.  We just know he has a penchant for carrots, is really good with guns, and has some rather colorful connections, including Monica Belluici as a prostitute.

The film is not about the plot.  In fact, we don't really learn the nature of the story until about halfway through, and even then, we are given a couple of lines to clue us in to what's going on.  This film is about action.  It has the kinetic energy of a video game.  The humor is offbeat and a little dark.  It's not your regular action movie.  Perhaps the irony in the end is that the film seems to have an anti gun message.  But without them saying it overtly, you couldn't tell throughout the 90 minute duration.

Nope, this one goes right for the throat.

From the moment Clive Owen plunges a carrot into a bad guys eye and kills him (and this happens within the first five minutes) you know this movie is going to require a major suspension of disbelief.  But with that out of the way, you can enjoy the most outrageous action movie ever put on film.  Owen plays a homeless former Black Ops soldier who just stumbles on an assassination conspiracy dealing with small children being born for the use of their blood and bone marrow.  I won't bore with the details but it does get complicated.  In short, he's on the run with a baby in his hands.  Obviously this guy has a conscious and a temper.

Paul Giamatti plays the hitman who's trying to see the job through to the end until his men start getting killed off by this stranger who seems to be able to kill everyone who tries to kill him.  Owen then tries to pawn off the baby on Hooker/Wet Nurse played by the ever-beautiful Italian Actress Monica Bellucci.  The two end up running together, saving the baby and beating the bad guys.

Now, you probably figured this might just be an over the top (yeah, it's way over the top) action flick.  But an obvious statement starts to form as the movie goes on.  Owen's character is the victim of loosing his wife and child to some gunman who walked into a restaurant one day and just started blowing people away.  He later finds out he is indirectly responsible.  His character is the son of an English gunsmith who moved to the US when The British got strict with their gun laws.  He grew up with guns, was a very good marksman and was then recruited by the US Army.

Worse yet, the democratic Senator who is running for President has a major gun control bill in the works.  The bad guys seem to be a representation of the NRA and the good guy doesn't carry a gun...he just uses whatever is in reach most of the time.

The movie is definitely entertaining and very funny at times.  All three major actors do a great job, especially Giamantti and Owen.  There really isn't enough seen of Bellucci, especially during a love making/shoot out scene (so outrageous) but could there ever be enough of her?",1202688000,,2586,4.4071729957805905

Odds are that if you watched Arnold, Stallone, and Bruce Willis blow stuff up in the late 80s and early 90s, you were right.  That is, you were right until Clive Owen, Paul Giamatti, and director Michael Davis got together and decided to make this movie.  The basic plot is pretty straightforward: Owen plays a drifter who happens to have one mean sense of moral outrage and a special knack with firearms of all makes and calibers.  He's minding his own business late one evening until some random pregnant woman stumbles by with a random bad guy in a random 70s Camaro hot on her tail.  Concluding that someone is up to no good, Owen decides to follow the woman--with only a raw carrot for a weapon, mind you--and rescue the poor maiden.  Random violence ensues while Owen proceeds to shoot at least one bad guy a minute for the next hour and a half while protecting the infant from an army of thugs larger than the population of lower Manhattan--all led by Paul Giamatti as a hen-pecked, cold-blooded assassin.  It's Children of Men with a sense of humor.

The violence is graphic and gratuitous, so Shoot 'Em Up is not for the squeemish.  But, neither is it the kind of torture porn that has become so popular with kids and the makers of horror movies.  Instead of the Saw series, think Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam.

3234726,2,B000XA5K4I,"Some movies you just can't seem to understand why you bother watching them. There are just certain movies that are kind of like train wrecks, you know that the outcome will no doubt be disastrous, yet you can't help but watch as the movie reaches its inevitable conclusion. It's these types of films that have earned the title 'Guilty Pleasures', because no matter how hard you try there's just no explaining why you're watching the film, because there isn't much of anything to merit your attention, but there you sit, like a goober, watching a movie that you know will end up being a waste of time. A recent example of this is the 2007 brainless, action movie ""Shoot 'Em Up"" starring Clive Owen (""King Arthur""), Monica Bellucci (""The Matrix Reloaded""), and Paul Giamatti (""Cinderella Man"").

""Shoot 'Em Up"" is about a man named Smith (Clive Owen) who, out of sheer coincidence, happens to be in the right place at the right time as a man is attempting to kill a pregnant woman just before she is about to give birth. Smith follows the man, proceeding to intervene before the murder takes place, after dispatching the killer and assisting the woman in childbirth, Smith finds himself in yet another fight between the would be killer's former cohorts, led by a man named Hertz (Paul Giamatti). After escaping from the fight, Smith finds himself the surrogate father to the newborn baby after the mother is caught in the crossfire. Now, Smith is on the run with a baby in tow from a maniacal mad man, and his only assistance is a prostitute (Monica Bellucci) with the proverbial heart of gold.

Writer/director Michael Davis has managed to take a bunch of over-the-top, overblown action sequences strung them together with one of the weakest storylines I've seen in a feature film (even some of Steven Seagal's Direct-to-DVD films have better plots), assembled a fairly strong cast (each of whom should really have known better than to do this movie, but you know the saying, ""Money talks.""), and somehow convinced New Line Cinema that this was a viable property worthy of theatrical release. Kudos for the effort Mr. Davis, I don't know how you did it but the fact that this movie ever made it to theaters is beyond me, this movie's script had DVD bargain bin written all over it! I will give ""Shoot 'Em Up"" and its writer/director Michael Davis this, the action sequences may be over-the-top in every sense, but they are mostly a lot of fun to watch, although by the end of the movie I found myself tired of the endless barrage of gunfire that had permeated almost every scene in the film. If nothing else, these stylistic, fast-paced gun battles is probably what kept my attention in this film, because it sure wasn't the story which wasn't made clear until approximately 15 to 20 minutes from the end of the film.

For an action movie to succeed with audiences it must of course contain plenty of high octane, energetic action sequences to keep the adrenaline junkies going, but it must also have some semblance of a storyline tying the fight scenes together to give the movie some sense of purpose otherwise we're just watching a bunch of meaningless fights that don't have any point behind them and that gets boring really quickly. But, when a movie's story isn't made clear to the audience until about 20 minutes from the end of the movie, then I think the writer has made a horrible mistake and is lucky the audience has made it with them this far into the film. In the case of ""Shoot 'Em Up"" writer/director Michael Davis was fortunate that he had crafted such creative and fun gunfights to keep my attention, plus the fact that I like the cast helped him out quite a bit, because without those key components I would have ditched this movie long before the basic plot was revealed and would have felt that I hadn't missed much of anything. A little advice for Michael Davis, if you intend to keep the audience on board with you for this kind of movie, it would probably be a smart idea to give a little bit more of the story away throughout the entire duration of the film, not just waiting for the end to explain everything like its some massive secret that would change the entire movie experience.

The cast that was assembled for this film, led by Clive Owen, Monica Bellucci, and Paul Giamatti, were of a much higher caliber than I would have expected in such an inferior piece of so-called ""entertainment"". Even though the story was lacking in almost every way, the actors managed to do a decent job of creating characters the audience could become interested in, even if their story arcs were essentially non-existent. I must say Paul Giamatti was actually a surprise as the villain in the film, I never thought that he could handle playing the main villain in such a movie, but the over-the-top performance he gave as Hertz fit right in with the rest of the movie's tone, and was actually one of the best things about the entire film.

If nothing else can be said for ""Shoot 'Em Up"", it at least lives up to its name, this film is essentially nothing but one gun battle after another and before long all the style and quick camera cuts in the world can't help these scenes from looking the same and leaving the audience bored. I believe that even die hard action fans that love to see nothing but non-stop action will be hard pressed to actually enjoy this movie all that much, because by the time the movie is almost over you'll probably find yourself hating the constant barrage of gunfights and wishing for a little drama to fill up some time.

In fact, it was no surprise to hear that the script was written around a lot of preconceived action [...]. That fact certainly didn't make Shoot 'Em Up a bad movie; it was actually pretty good. But it did come across as a plethora of spectacular stunts that just needed a halfway decent story to get produced as a movie.

The stunts are spectacular. They go nicely with the 100% deliberate hokeyness of the film. A black comedy to some...a kind-of comic book/animation come to life to others. The death defying feats are way over the top, but again, it's all intentional on the part of Writer/Director Michael Davis.

And Paul Giamatti, in his one billionth role I think, is as fun to watch as ever.

Owen is the carrot-eating good guy and Giamatti is the bad guy. Owen by chance inserts himself a political conspiracy that is run by Giamatti, and the result is a fast-past, surreal, action-packed...well...Shoot 'Em Up.

I will grant that most of the action scenes are so farfetched that there would be no way they could happen in Real Life. But, this isn't real, it's only a movie and it's a pretty exciting film from start to finish.

Without giving too much away, this film has a continueing fetish with carrots. Not often does a vegetable have such a prominent role in a movie.

The choice of villain, played by Paul Giamatti, was excellent. Here we have the perfect adversary for the apparently unstoppable hero. He is so intelligent and so vicious, that there is every possibility that he could defeat our hero simply by guessing his next move, which he does on several occasions.

The female lead, played by Donna Quintano, is a very shallow character and little is done to flesh-out (so to speak) her character. The one and only sex scene in the film is completely ridiculous, which goes right along with the action scenes anyway. Quintano's portrayal of lactating escort Monica Bellucci is wooden, at times.

3234735,2,B000XA5K4I,"'Shoot Em Up' is full of those humorously ridiculous action scenes we know from movies like The Transporter.  That's the good part of the movie.

This is combined with a pretty strong guns-are-bad theme.  It's not just an argument against violence, it's an argument against the 2nd Amendment, which is mentioned specifically.

Hypocritically, the Good Guy makes use of hundreds of bullets (and a few carrots) to defeat the evil government conspiracy to allow people to have guns.

Ironically, the Good Guy makes a pretty firm statement that hypocrisy is one of the things he hates.

And if that's not quite enough garbage for you, the writer of this multi-million-dollar production can't control his leftist impulse to include a message about not trusting people who stand to make money.

If you can shut your brain off completely while watching movies, which I can handle sometimes, this is fun to watch.  But it really pushes the limits of ignoring stupidity to have a good time.",1200096000,3,981,4.939024390243903
3234736,3,B000XA5K4I,"In ""Bully for Bugs,"" Bugs Bunny, once again making that ""wrong turn at Albuquerque,"" finds himself a spectator inside a bullring, where a magnificent bull is making short work of an overmatched toreador. Bugs is minding his own business -admittedly in the wrong place at the wrong time - ""What's up, Doc?"" - when the not amused bull bucks Bugs out of the arena and into the stratosphere.  As Bugs, tail jacked up, is propelled toward the heavens, he turns to the camera and declares with an annoyed smirk, ""Of course you know, this means war!""  There ensues an outlandish, over the top, war of wits between Bugs and the bull fought with such implements as an anvil, a slingshot, a rifle, elephant bullets, axle grease, and a crude Rube Goldberg device that employs TNT.

""Shoot `Em Up,"" the Michael Davis directed movie starring Clive Owen, Paul Giamatti and Monica Bellucci is like an 86 minute live action version of that classic 1953 cartoon short.  The movie opens on a extreme close-up of our hero ""Smith"" (Clive Owen) taking a deliberate bite out of long stemmed carrot.  Taciturn Smith is our Bugs and he has definitely taken a wrong turn somewhere, although it may not have been Albuquerque .

Full of righteous indignation, Smith hates everything.  He hates ""40-year old jack-holes wearing ponytails,"" as he informs us before blowing the back of head off of a 40-year old jack-hole wearing a ponytail.  He hates privileged yuppies who park in handicap spaces we learn before he smashes the driver's side window of an illegally parked Mercedes before stealing it.  And he hates guys changing lanes without signaling, as we discover when he forces said guy off the road causing him to smash into a parked car.

Paul Giamatti, more bully than bull, is the malevolent Elmer Fudd of this piece.  Giamatti takes delicious delight in his devilishness.

Once Owen and Giamatti have engaged in ""Of course you know, this means war!"" one-upmanship, ""Shoot ""Em Up"" devolves into one spectacularly choreographed scene of mythic mayhem after another.  In fact, ""Shoot `Em Up"" is so jacked up on a Red Bull high of Testosterone injected vitriol, that you can seldom catch your breath let alone make heads or tails of what is going on.  Until about three-quarters in, the movie moves so fast, you are just jerked along, unable to make any of the human connections you would need to make in order to care.

Of course, the movie uses the stock device that has informed movies from their infancy: the imperiled infant.  Not since ""Raising Arizona"" has such a sweet countenanced kid been put in such stark danger.  Except, "" Arizona "" being a comedy, you knew nothing was going to happen to Junior.  In ""Shoot `Em Up"" all bets are off.

The plot of ""Shoot `Em Up"" is almost as cartoonish as the action.  There is so much ammunition dispersed in this movie, with the guns and gunplay erotized to a level nothing human approach in this movie, it is almost laughable that a gun control initiative is at the heart of its overblown action.  Like watching a porn movie about abstinence, this is kind of a turn-off.

That said, the adrenaline rush of ""Shoot `Em Up"" should not be missed.  I recommend turning on the subtitles (some of the best throw-away lines may be missed if you don't) and watching it as a live action comic book.  Then watching it again.",1200009600,4,3340,4.709122203098107

This is actually a live action version of a Bugs Bunny cartoon with Clive Owen in the role of the wascally wabbit and Paul Giamatti as Elmer Fudd.

The plot is..well, that's incidental.  What matters in this movie is that bullets are constantly flying and the body count is constantly rising.  If the movie seems silly and overblown it's supposed to be.  This is pretty much a parody of one of those silly action movies you might have seen Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzenneger back in the eighties and nineties.  I realize this movie probably won't be for everyone (including those who don't like characters with necrophilia tendencies) but for those who just want to put there brain on hold for a little while you will probably have fun.

I hate how people complain about stuff that isn't realistic...and yet they believe the scenes in Live Free or Die Hard where Bruce Willis is on top of a jet, and throws a car at a helicopter. Live Free or Die Hard is still a better movie, but the scenes are just as ridiculous as Shoot Em Up and yet people only complain about Shoot Em Up.

If you are looking for a great movie that continues to entertain throughout the entire film, this is the movie you should get.

In fact Owen delivers the baby at the same time he's in a shootout with about two or three dozen thugs.  The body count only increases and it seems every extra in Hollywood was used to bite the dust and when Smith runs out of bullets he always has a carrot handy to be used as a lethal weapon.

3234745,4,B000XA5K4I,"I rented this film with low expectations. A friend of mine said that it was stupid so I saw this with an open mind. ""Shoot `Em Up"" is a movie with a title that speaks for itself. Sorry, Dee-Nut, I will have to disagree with you with this movie. True, the film is so ridiculously unreal but boy, it sure is a lot of fun to watch! Action and gunplay is all you're in for with this film.

A man named Smith (Clive Owen) with a sordid past is in a bus stop one evening. He spies a pregnant woman being pursued by bad guys led by Hertz (Paul Giamatti) and decides to get involved. What results is a fast-paced action packed shoot `em up from start to finish....

Such a short description of the plot details, isn't it? Actually, there is a plot, it just gets broken down throughout the proceedings. While I do not want to go through the details, I will just describe it by going through its themes: a Baby for the rescuing, a beautiful hooker (Monica Belucci), an eccentric bad guy, a politician mixed in and an anti-hero with an unknown past. The rest is non-stop hyper-kinetic action. Writer and director Michael Davis knew what he wanted to do when he made this film. A slam-bang, hard-boiled cool stylish action flick that is stripped down much of anything else such as intricate storytelling and character development. This is a very gutsy move on his part. Critical eyes (Hey, I am a nit-picker myself) may argue that the lack of plot is its downfall and while it is, the director sure knew where he was headed. Sometimes, audiences just want action and ""Shoot `Em Up"" does deliver!

The style of the film is a bit hard to breakdown. Let's see, I did catch hints of the atmosphere of another comic book inspired film ""Sin City"" (in color), Hong Kong ""Bullet Ballet"" and Japanese ""Pistol Opera"", the sly humor and grittiness of ""Reservoir Dogs"", the outrageous silliness of ""Planet Terror"" and the over-the-top attitude of Luc Besson films. I believe the director really wanted to overload our senses with a lot of adrenaline-driven action sequences so the weaknesses of the film will not reach our brains. This film is pure action ""junk"" with one goal; to entertain its viewer.

With a movie with almost no plot and character depth, it is important that the lead actor fits the role otherwise the movie will be a farce. Thankfully, Clive Owen manages to convincingly pull off his anti-hero role with dynamic charisma that complements the screenplay. It is also fortunate that Owen is supported by the great performance of Paul Giamatti who plays the lead villain; Hertz and mega babe Monicca Belucci sure is very pleasing to the eyes as Donna. aLSO, IT WAS VERY AMUSING that the film-makers opted for carrots instead of the stereotypical cigarettes or toothpicks to signify the hero's ""coolness"".

""SHOOT `EM UP"" is geared towards the male audience with its unrealistic, ridiculously over the top action sequences, but I am sure the female audience will be swooned with Owen's charismatic appeal. While its main weakness is the unreal comic book approach, it is also its greatest strength. I have to commend the director in knowing exactly what he was ""aiming"" for. I've read that Baby Oliver was cast in the role before he was born, a woman carrying twins was selected. If that didn't exhibit commitment to his art, then I'm not sure what else. I admire directors who know which direction they want to go. The film plays almost like a stunt performance but hey, I am not complaining.

Ultimately, ""Shoot `Em Up"" is a fun and entertaining experience. Ridiculous, unrealistic and maybe even cartoonish; but one thing it sure isn't is boring. The film is a lot of FUN.

RECOMMENDED! For fans of ""Bullet Ballet"" and ""Pistol Opera"" [3  Stars]

3234746,1,B000XA5K4I,"*Warning* This review has a few spoilers (if you can call them that). This is THE worst movie I have ever seen. It tops Transporter 2 on my list of movies I wish I hadn't wasted 30 min watching. I bought this movie thinking that Clive Owen and Paul Giamatti, two of todays best actors, could not possibly do me wrong. They did. They owe me 20 bucks and an apology. They've also lost me as a fan. If they read the script (if there was one) before agreeing to make this movie and still decided to make this movie, then they aren't my type of actors. This movie had no chance. Here are a few reasons why this movie was bad:

1. All of the ""bad guys"" are stupid. They all fire full clips and hit nothing. While Clive Owen is taking cover, they stand and wait to be shot.
2. Clive Owens' character never misses, never. He is Robin Hood with a gun. He doesn't even need a gun to kill people with bullets. If you really want to waste 2 hours of your life to find out what this means, I feel for you.
3. Every one liner used in this movie makes you cringe. If overly simple quotes like ""So much for seatbelts"" is funny to you, then forget I said anything.
4. *Spoiler* The stunts are absolutely ridiculous and impossible for anyone to actually do. For example, a car and a van racing at each other head on at 60+ mph (guestimate), hit each other head on. This propels Clive Owen through his windshield, through the vans windshield, into the back of the van, where he kills everyone when inside. If you would like to know what happens next, see reason 3.
5. Mindless. Some people don't like new, fresh, or creative ideas in movies, but I do. And this movie has none of these. This is a B- movie with A list actors.

If you couldn't already tell, this movie is horrible. Bad acting, impossible stunts, mind-numbing one-liners, and a horrible plot. Take this as a warning, and rent the movie if you really must see it. I unfortunately bought it then gave it away the next day as a joke on a friend. Wait and see... This will be in the $4.99 bin at your local supermarket soon.",1199750400,11,2065,4.225316455696203

3234750,2,B000XA5K4I,"I have to start by being fair in that this movie claims to be a shoot-em-up, and in that category it succeeds. However, in every other category it fails miserably. Don't get me wrong, it has it all...the disenchanted former special ops guy, the damsel in distress, the evil but smart bad-guy, the government/corporation conspiracy, etc.  Unfortunately, everything is poorly executed and quite frankly, the writers simply did not try that hard to make a believable plot, or characters you could care about. What's worse is that the movie's core concept is to be a sinfully over-done shoot-em-up, but it fails in that respect as well.  The gun-battles are a been-there, done-that (10 years ago) affair. Finally, the acting is only sub-par.  Clive own does a respectable job with a terrible script and character, while Monica Bellucci is in such a role that no acting could save (and her acting was on par with a B movie actor anyway.)  The only notable performance comes from the films villain, who only barely succeeds in garnering extra notice.

3234752,5,B000XA5K4I,"It might be tough for me to explain why I so loved this film, but I'll give it a go anyway.

After recently watching and reviewing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Kingdom/dp/B000Y7WGOW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Kingdom</a>, I explained that I wasn't one of those movie critics who enjoyed action over plot (with a few exceptions, of course). And this is why I fell head-over-heels for SHOOT `EM UP. It is precisely an action over plot film. But wait! Let me explain! It's that and quite a bit more.

What Shoot `em up does is take that style of action and put it into absolutely ludicrous proportions. And in doing so it makes great fun of itself and all those action films that've come before. From the gun-loving and reluctant dark hero, to the hooker with a heart of gold, Shoot `em up takes these themes to far out extremes and makes for some of the funniest scenes you'll ever see.

Let me give you an example: In one scene Mr. Smith (Clive Owen,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Children-of-Men/dp/B000N6TX1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Children of Men</a>), our dark hero, escapes with a newborn baby  from some bad guys and runs into a very filthy bathroom. He promptly jumps into a stall and up onto the toilet so that anyone entering won't be able to see his feet below the stall door. But, while juggling the baby and his most beloved handgun, he drops the pistol into the toilet. Thinking quickly, he puts the baby down on the disgusting floor, fishes his gun from the toilet bowl, heads over to the baby changing station on the wall, and begins lovingly cleaning his weapon while the baby gurgles happily from the heavily soiled floor.

If you don't like this kind of humor then, please, stay away from this movie.

This is quite a departure from previous Clive Owen films that I've seen. Being more of the ""serious"" actor, it was nice to see him in something so ridiculously funny and out of (what I thought to be) character for him.

The other surprise was the estimable Paul Giamatti (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lady-in-the-Water/dp/B000JLTR8Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lady in the Water</a>) as a hitman out to kill the mother of the baby that Owen's character initially saves. Not only does Hertz (Giamatti) want the woman dead, but also her child. But when an unsuspecting tough guy named Mr. Smith (Owens) inadvertently gets involved in his ""business"", Giamatti's character gets much more than he bargained for. This was quite a change of pace for Giamatti who tends to play quieter characters. Here in Shoot `em up he's a loud sociopath with a penchant for killing. He's also hysterically funny as he tries to kill the baby and now Mr. Smith all while juggling a demanding wife who continually calls him on the phone at the most inopportune times (""Honey. I'm busy right now. I'll have to call you back."")

Donna Quintano (Monica Bellucci) plays the hooker with a heart of gold role after Mr. Smith (Owens) comes to her for assistance with the baby. Donna recently lost her own child and Mr. Smith knows that having a new baby around will help her ...as well as himself. But her morales aren't very well grounded. When they run out of money to buy bullets, Donna tries to help by utilizing her prostitute skills near a dumpster ...much to the chagrin of Mr. Smith.

Plot-wise, it doesn't make much sense. There's a series of scenes devoted to why Giamatti's character is trying to kill the baby (politics, advanced medicine, presidential candidates, etc.) but it doesn't make much difference. It is the outlandish antics of Mr. Smith and his over-the-top James Bond-ish shooting abilities that make this film what it is. And you'll howl with laughter as the bullets fly, the targets get hit with impossible accuracy, the prostitute and the tough guy fall for each other, all while this newborn takes a wild ride.",1199664000,4,3970,5.10477657935285
3234753,3,B000XA5K4I,"I enjoyed this movie immensely. As I see it, the movie can work on two levels: (1) as a pure action film with very little brains, and/or (2) as a sly send-up of the action genre. For movie buffs, the chance to see Paul Giamatti as the bad guy is worth the price of admission all by itself. Action scenes are so over the top that there is no possibility of confusing the movie with reality, even Hollywood reality. So if you're an action junkie you're in for a treat. If you like seeing references to other films, you'll probably have a great time. If you are not in either of these camps, this film might not be for you.

3234754,3,B000XA5K4I,"2007's ""Shoot 'Em Up"" is something different in an action movie.  Every scence of carefully orchestrated violence is over-the-top overdone, on purpose, and the audience is in on the joke.  In scene after scene, a top-notch cast (Clive Owen, Paul Giamatti, and Monica Bulluci) execute, with a straight face, the most improbable gun fights, martial arts sequences, improvisation of weapons from ordinary objects (carrots, anyone) and impossible escapes from dire situations.

The plot is fairly straightforward.  A man named Smith (Owen) involves himself in the defense of a pregnant woman pursued by a gang of thugs.  The woman dies, but Smith saves the child.  Smith now finds himself the object of a relentless manhunt by the manical but hilariously hen-pecked hitman Hertz (Giamatti) and his men.  Smith enlists the aid of a lactating prostitute (Bulluci) while going after the conspiracy that has targeted the child.

This movie isn't for everyone.  Those expecting a straight-up action flick are liable to be confused and disappointed.

I personally laughed most of the way through the movie and enjoyed the special effects and overall had an enjoyable experience that was definitely worth the rental fee.  I've rented movies before where I wanted my money back, and this is not one of them.

The friend that watched the movie with me is usually less critical of movies than I am, yet he said it is ""the worst movie he has ever seen"".  But, I believe he went in with expectations and seeing ""Rambo"".  This movie lies more towards the spoof of Rambo called, I believe, ""Hot Shots"", though the body count and gun fire in this movie, on that merit alone, will make any Rambo fan happy.

So, he gives it 1 star as the worst possible movie.  I gave it a 3 as enjoyable and since we both contributed to this review, I am giving it the average, of 2 stars.",1199577600,2,1287,4.191056910569106

I'll never look at carrots the same again, I had no idea they were ""that"" good for you. If you like War with Statham and Li you'll get a kick out of this one. A little twist at the end is good. The closing scene is sort of pointless, but fun nonetheless. No complaints about the DVD production.

3234767,4,B000XA5K4I,"SHOOT 'EM UP is well named: this is a whompingly good action movie that is as much parody of its genre as it is a good story. It never for a moment takes itself seriously and it is played by a strong cast of top-drawer actors having a terrific time. Writer/director Michael Davis has found his niche and let's hope there will be more dark comedies that are as much fun to watch as this one.

The story is negligible: lone man Smith (Clive Owen at his best) observes a pregnant woman in chased distress, delivers her baby, then finishes off the huge gang of bad guys who are in pursuit, taking the newborn boy to transient safety. Smith finds a lactating prostitute Donna (beautiful Monica Bellucci), takes her from her business of kinky sex and makes her the baby's surrogate mother. A smarmy gangster Hertz (Paul Giamatti in another career forming role), connected to an illicit arms manufacturer Hammerson (Stephen McHattie), is in pursuit of both Smith and the baby for reasons that are finally disclosed: the baby is part of a ring of potential bone marrow donors for an important Senator.  The ending is, well, an ending.  But it is the getting there that is all the fun.

The dialog is peppered with hilarious one-liners that have a real edge and the methods of the endless killings include several using the carrot  that Smith keeps at hand as a weapon.  The shootings are fast and impossible but actually hilarious in the choreography.  Clive Owen plays the role straight, with a real gift for humor as well as action.  Paul Giamatti is a sinister delight and able to match Owens one-liner for one-liner.  Monica Bellucci makes her impossible role credible and as always is gorgeous to look at! This is a fast paced, finely written and acted parody - definitely deserving of the comic book title! Grady Harp, January 08",1199404800,34,1827,4.666666666666667

I understand that a certain level of acrobatic and death defiance is standard flare for this genre but after watching this film I had lost 90 minutes of my life that I can never regain. I want my money back, it's THAT bad. I will never watch this piece of garbage ever again.

The acting was beyond flat, the scenes were so beyond impossible that I could only laugh at them and the dialogue was so lame it was painful to sit through. It actually got worse the longer the film ran.

I blame the writer first and foremost for coming up with this steaming pile of film but after that there is an entire list of people to blame for producing this thing. The pitiful one liners are in every scene and the ""You know what I hate..."" stuff gets old after the third time let alone the twenty ninth. The writer is constantly pushing his attitudes on us regarding child raising, driving habits and gun control, none of which he seems mature enough to provide.

This movie is portrayed at the level of intellegence of a teen ager yet the content is such that teens should not be allowed to watch due to the fact that it will permenently lower the viewer's IQ.

That is if hyperviolent action movies loaded with black humor are your cup of tea.

All other high-browed audiences only interested in CINEMA (conceited ""sniff sniff"" here), PLEASE, don't even bother.  Your finger waving and holding-of-the-noses are beyond tired.

Judge this film the same way you would judge an R-rated piece of anime' - not for the kiddies or the easily ruffled.

That being said (and hopefully taken to heart), I can honestly say this was my greatest guilty pleasure at the theater in 2007.  While I guess it does sort of fall into that ""gun porn"" slot, it's really a lot more clever and slapstick-ish (albeit in a sick way, lol) than one might be led to believe. Think ""Crank"", but with even better action pieces, music and much funnier.

Outstanding casting too - Owen, Giamatti and Bellucci were clearly having fun, and it shows.

I saw this in the theater, bought the soundtrack (score only, none of the rockin' tunes you hear sprinkled throughout the flick sadly - still good though) and today picked up the blu-ray and it only further crystallized my initial reaction - I truly and totally dig this movie.

And the blu-ray transfer is incredibly beautiful, both visually & sound-wise.  But maybe wait until it comes down a bit in price?  I dunno...perhaps rent it first before you plunk down 30 bucks to add it to your library.

Total shame this didn't do much better at the box office.  I think it was unfairly judged by critical pinheads in the popular press under the wrong light and far too harshly.

Over the 39 years of my life, I've watched thousands of movies, read thousands of books, watched more TV than I care to state, and I can safely say that this movie had scenes that I've never seen in any media form before.

Ever.

Did I enjoy it?

Immensely! Never doubt that for a second.

Note that my review contains spoilers, so don't read further if you want to see the movie, or don't care about spoilers.

Have you ever seen a couple in the middle of hot monkey love get into a gunfight and CONTINUE to engage in carnal relations? I haven't.

Have you ever seen a gunfight take place during skydiving? I sure haven't. If I have, I don't remember it.

Have you ever wanted to teach some jack-off on the streets a lesson about signalling, or speeding? This movie is for you.

Ever wanted to deal with someone dealing out corporal punishment in public? This movie will give you satisfaction.

Plot wise, it was pretty complex. What appears to be a homeless man gets involved in trying to rescue a pregnant woman from someone who is clearly out to kill her. It just gets weirder from there.

He kills men by the dozens, all the while helping her deliver. Make that yet another scene I've never had the privilege in witnessing.

Sadly, the woman doesn't survive the ordeal, but the infant does, and more and more people continue to come after the baby in order to kill it.

Later in the movie, it's revealed why the baby has to die, and despite this, Mr. Smith does everything in his power to prevent the death. All the while the body count continues to grow, and the stunts, not to mention the gunfights, get more and more outrageous.

If only the Li, Statham movie War had been this enjoyable.

Many years ago, I read tons of adventure novels while going to school and for years afterwards. Mack Bolan, Able Team, Stony Man, Deathlands, Survivalist, just to name a few.

The action in this movie was like taking scenes from these over-the-top adrenaline filled, lactose laced pieces of pulp fiction and putting them on the silver screen.

Don't take this movie seriously, and you will enjoy yourself. Oh, and I'll never look at a carrot in the same light again. Who'd figured you'd be able to use it for that purpose?

As for the DVD, it has your usual offering of special features. There are nine deleted / extended scenes, with only one being a true deleted scene. The best of the bunch was the extended torture scene that really expands upon Clive Owen's character, Mr. Smith.

One very unique special feature is the animatics - one that the writer / director produced in order to sell the movie. The only way to watch these animatics without being confused is to have the director comments on.

Finally, there are five making of featurettes included.

Pure fun, 5 out of 5.",1199145600,4,2808,4.52079207920792
3234773,5,B000XA5K4I,"Mr. Smith is sitting on a park bench, eating a carrot and drinking a coffee.  A pregnant woman runs by him.  A mean dude in a leather coat soon follows.  There's a shootout in an abandoned train station; the woman gives birth; a wicked, intelligent killer named Mr. Hertz shows up.  Smith escapes with the child, and decides to take it to a lactating prostitute.  The three of them go on the run from Hertz, discovering along the way a scandal of tremendous proportions that could forever change the rest of their lives--if it doesn't kill them first.

Are you laughing at the implausibility of it all yet?  You should be.  ""Shoot 'Em Up"" is what action fans such as myself have been dreaming of for years--a guilty pleasure without any guilt.  It doesn't take itself seriously, and you shouldn't, either.  As stated in the behind the scenes featurette: there are probably more bullets than words, and that's just how we like it.

Clive Owen and Paul Giamatti, as Smith and Hertz respectively, bounce off each other like pingpong balls; both men are a delight to watch, Giamatti especially taking an immense thrill in the role of a sadistic genius.  Monica Bellucci adds some feminine wise-cracking allure to the film (which all action movies must have).  The movie--both the dialogue and action--is witty and intense; you'll laugh yourself off the edge of your seat, and yet shiver in suspense at the same time.  Never have I seen something so funny be so cool.  The action is as quick, the timing is impeccable, and ""Shoot 'Em Up"" is going down as one of the greatest action movies you've seen.  Not quite a farce--it's intentionally funny, but not to the point of parody--it's more a warm-hearted, warts-and-all homage to the great action flicks of our time.

3234777,5,B000XA5K4I,"This is not a serious movie. Or rather, it is not a movie to be taken seriously. It is a cartoon action piece, with more nods to Looney Toons (and Itchy and Scratchy) than you can shake a carrot at. The main 'hero', as played by Clive Owens, is constantly chomping on carrots (as well as using them for a few unexpected purposes). Picture Clive Owen deadpanning ""What's up Doc?"" and you'll get the idea. The villain, as played by Paul Giamatti, is a real-life interpretation of Elmer Fudd from the classic ""Kill Da Wabbit!"" musical. His ringtone is even 'Ride of the Valkyries'.

Most people that didn't like this movie took it seriously and simply did not understand the tongue-in-cheek, over-the-top, Bugs Bunny vs. Elmer Fudd aspect of it. The soundtrack is super high energy and guns are used in several original ways.

3234779,4,B000XA5K4I,"Whoah! If you're looking for mindless action, THIS is the movie for you.
It's over the top, totally unbelievable, physically impossible, but absolutely brilliant all at the same time.

2 minute version:

Clive Owen eats a lot of carrots, and values his privacy.  There are many things that he absolutely hates, and he comes into contact with most of these things when he unwillingly gets involved in a plot to kill a very pregnant young woman.  Suddenly faced with a nanny job, he shoots his way out of the frying pan and into the fire, each scenario more draw-dropping-ly impossible than the last.  Paul Giamatti plays an unlikely criminal mastermind and Monica Bellucci is under-utilized as the proverbial professional with a heart of gold except she's also got a chest of milk to go with it.  Things get political, and hopelessly complicated, and of course there's lots and lots (and lots) of shooting, during any (and I do mean ANY) situation.

Good stuff:

1. Clive Owen
2. Clive Owen's one-liners
3. Clive Owen's stunts
4. The hilariously bad but breathtaking, yet impossible scenarios
5. Paul Giamatti's cell phone calls
6. The body count
7. Clive Owen's nude scene
8. Clive Owen

Bad stuff:

1. Carrots are DEFINITELY not good for some people
2. Not enough Bellucci
3. Plot (nuff said) but then again, we don't need no steenkin' plot

If you can forget that this movie professes to have a plot, you're in for a rollicking good (but extremely violent) time.  Definitely a must-see if you're looking for mindless adult entertainment, and don't mind looking at Clive Owen.

Rated: 4.5 stars

3234781,2,B000XA5K4I,"After reading the title, a majority of moviegoers think of gun action and they are right, but mindless action that is. Director Michael Davis's original concept--in which at first was verbally explained--was not taken seriously by several studios. He literally illustrated a 17- minute reel of animation which consisted of 17,000 line drawings of action sequences, but those studios were still confused. I really do not know why they had such a hard time understanding his vision because when watching this film; the ""cartoon-like"" action was very evident. Maybe that is why New Line Cinema and CEO Bob Shay understood his weird vision and gave him the green light. The character development, and most importantly the action cannot even save this rascally ""rabbit"" of a movie.

It's night time in a desolate part of the city. Mr. Smith (Clive Owen)--not to be confused with Agent Smith from The Matrix--is sitting on a city bench; minding his own business, when he notices a blond pregnant woman who is walking by. At first, he is not very surprised about her appearance but within moments, he notices that she is in distress and ready to go into labor. However within split seconds; a car suddenly rushes by and crashes into another parked vehicle. The assailment immediately leaves his wrecked car and pursues his powerless victim but Smith simply cannot allow his atrocity to occur and follows the two into the building. Meanwhile Mr. Hertz (Paul Giamatti) and the rest of his motley crew of thugs arrive at the scene and join in the pursuit of the pregnant woman. Within moments, they soon discover Smith and start rapidly firing an array of bullets from the different weapons that they have but do little damage to our hero as he pursues the woman. He delivers the baby while killing all the thugs around him. Then he escapes with the new born baby but the new mother didn't make it.

He takes the baby to a place of safety where he joins up with a prostitute (Monica Bellucci [Donna].) Then he takes her and the baby to another secured shelter and must now go after Hertz, to find out why he wants this baby dead. What will happen to our hero? Is this simply a case of revenge or something much more complicated?

Shoot `Em Up should have never gotten the green light. Director Michael Davis begins the movie as if it was a sequel from a prior film--as a Matrix Reloaded was to Matrix Revolutions, where it is understandable to have action to start a movie. Any good director with experience knows to begin a movie with background information of who the main characters are and how the story revolves around them. Shoot `Em Up begins with a bam!

Then the Director gives us vague references in the story that Smith may have been in the military, perhaps Special Forces or maybe he is a solider of fortune, but we have to guess through weak clues such as putting his lady friend into a tank or when he goes into a gun store to purchase weapons and ammunition. Mr. Hertz is the bad guy who wants the baby dead, but who is this person? Does he work for the Government of the United States? Is he involved with organized crime? The only information we receive has nothing to do with the plot, such as talking to his wife on the phone or how he shows his dislike to Smith--he might have a personal vendetta but some vague information about him appears way too late in the film. We have confusion and boredom; the focal point of the movie is the baby!

The action is plenty but cartoon-like and soulless. It was quite clear that this is a live action spoof of other films from the genre--The Transporter and Crank. There are references to Bugs Bunny and The Road Runner (with the acme traps) with Smith eating carrots and making wise cracks. Then there is Hertz responding back with ""you're a rascally little rabbit!"" Is Davis making fun of Warner Brothers or Looney Tunes cartoons? Therefore, the action was unrealistic and this would be acceptable if the promotion for this film was marketed towards this theme. It leaves the audience perplexed.

The Verdict:
Please, enter at your risk. Shoot `Em Up leaves you wondering about the direction. We can see why several studios rejected this movie because they were probably confused with the director's concept (those thousands of drawings). It leaves you wondering what New Line Cinema was thinking.

The movie appears to be a satire on the genre or themed towards Looney Tunes? The non existent character development; comical killings, not enough information and plenty of unrealistic action--which has no merit and the visuals become monotonous. Perhaps Clive's character in this film is a way of saying that he should have been the next James Bond, but this is not the way to do it.",1196640000,5,4735,4.6975903614457835

3234785,3,B000XA5K4I,"""Shoot `Em Up"" is like watching a live action graphic novel. A fun movie, it is very violent and filled with some memorable lines. Nice turns by Clive Owen and Paul Giamatti almost make the completely excruciating performance by Monica Bellucci forgivable. The film doesn't have the visual style of other graphic novel adaptations, but it is fun nonetheless.

A tall, unshaven man wearing a black leather overcoat (Clive Owen) sits on a bus bench eating a carrot. He watches a pregnant woman run by, clutching her stomach. Then, a car filled with gun toting men barrels around the corner. ""Mr. Smith"" realizes the woman is in trouble and hurries to her aid. He rushes the woman into an abandoned warehouse and tries to comfort the new mother as she gives birth. Complicating matters are the numerous men with guns who don't care about the impending birth and want to kill the woman. Mr. Smith has to aid the new mother as he tries to protect her. Hertz (Paul Giamatti), the leader of the bad guys, is a little puzzled; he doesn't know who Smith is, or why he gets involved. The woman dies shortly after giving birth and Smith realizes he now has to care for the baby. But Hertz and his men are in pursuit, so Smith looks for help. He turns to a hooker named Donna (Monica Bellucci) who has recently given birth. Smith has to protect the baby and Donna and figure out why Hertz is so intent on getting the child.

I mentioned earlier that watching ""Shoot"" is like watching a live-action graphic novel. This is a growing trend, basing films on graphic novels, allowing filmmakers to delve into unusual, strange stories, stories that would never see the light of day in a more conventional filmmaker's universe. This growing subgenre of film has brought us a number of highly visual, very interesting films. Films like ""Sin City"" and ""300"" shot the characters against green screen, adding backgrounds later, giving the films an even greater graphic novel style. And these films are pretty magnificent. Graphic novels have also greatly influenced other films. ""Batman Begins"" was based on the work of Frank Miller, who also created ""Sin City"" and ""300"", giving the superhero a darker edge and making him more interesting. ""Shoot `Em Up"" has some of these similar elements, but the environment is not nearly as interesting. The film is set in a run down metropolis, a common setting for this type of story, but it looks like a set someone went through and added some elements to, to amp up the `weird' factor. The visual style is no where near as interesting or complete as ""Sin City"".

Interestingly, Clive Owen appears in both playing a similar character. In ""Shoot `Em Up"", `Smith"" is not as well defined as Dwight, his character in ""Sin City"", or as interesting, but he is fun to watch. Taking on elements of Clint Eastwood's famous cowboy persona, The Man with No Name, Owen's character simply becomes known as ""Smith"". Throughout, we learn little bits about him and Kurtz even gives us a few facts he either learned or gleamed from his dealings with the reluctant hero.

From the first moment we see him, sitting on a bus stop bench, at night, in the middle of a run down metropolis; we know Smith is probably not going to win any citizenship awards. I instantly got the feeling he was living off the grid, supported by a visit to his home later in the film. Smith lives in an abandoned warehouse complete with his own indoor garden, filled with carrots ripe for the plucking, and eating. ""Good for the eyesight"" he states, when Donna looks at him strangely.

Smith is also a reluctant hero. He watches the pregnant woman run down the street and then the car full of gun toting men. He sighs, gets up and gets involved. After she dies, he initially wants to leave the baby, but decides he can't. This reluctance adds some interest to his character. As he becomes further entwined in the story, his curiosity takes over. As Kurtz becomes more persistent, this serves to make Smith more hell bent on revenge. These moments help to make Smith a more interesting character; even though he inhabits a cartoon universe, he seems to have some real feelings and emotions.

It is interesting to watch Paul Giamatti play a villain. It is a nice change for this actor who gained a lot of critical praise for his work in ""Sideways"". Kurtz is not your normal villain; he is evil and hell bent on achieving his goal, but he also appears to be a more typical man. Yes, he has a gun in his hand, but without this deadly weapon, he could just as easily be mistaken for a librarian, creating one of the more interesting villains to come along in some time.

Kurtz also has some moments of levity; his wife constantly calls on his cell phone, apparently unaware of her husband's true occupation. At moments, he wonders out loud how Smith could be giving them so much trouble. These elements help to make Giamatti's Kurtz seem vulnerable, less scary, yet when he speaks, gritting his teeth, we understand how deadly he can be. This is a villain who is equally at home spraying bullets across a room as he is trying to problem solving, and figuring things out.

When the film was over, my companion commented that if you took all of the dialogue in the film it would probably only fill ten pages. She is completely true. Unfortunately Monica Bellucci still has a considerable amount of dialogue in the film. Bellucci has an extremely heavy accent, making most of what she says difficult to understand. That, and the fact that she isn't a good actress, makes it difficult to watch her on any level. Sure, she's very pretty, but there are many very pretty actresses in Hollywood who can at least act a little and would have done a better job in this role. Throughout the film, she frequently says ""Smith"" and even this simple line seems to perplex her.

""Shoot `Em Up"" certainly delivers on the action. From the initial confrontation in the abandoned warehouse, where Smith quickly secures a gun, he is never without a pistol for long. And when he doesn't have a sidearm, he finds other items to help him ward off the villains. Smith gets into many tough scrapes and finds some ingenious ways to get out of the situation. With each confrontation,  the stakes are raised along with the danger; and the elaborate stunts Smith pulls to get out of these scrapes escalates until you think it can't possibly go any further. But it does. You keep expecting the next confrontation to be a little more normal, but they just keep getting more outlandish. Watching the action in ""Shoot `Em Up"" is a little like riding a roller coaster, with bullets flying overhead.

But I can't really describe any of this, because it would spoil the fun of watching it yourself.

As good as the action is, it is also over the top and cartoony. I suspect it is intended as a parody of action violence; Smith's constant chewing on carrots leads Kurtz to spout an Elmer Fudd line drawing an obvious comparison. It's a funny moment, but I'm not sure the film works on this level. The over the top gross elements take it to a different plane.

The story? The story is as cartoony and outlandish as the rest of the film. As we watch, it continues to become more outrageous. Who cares. I'm not going to a film called ""Shoot `Em Up"" looking for an Academy Award caliber performance. The story is supposed to be silly.

""Shoot `Em Up"" is not a perfect film. There are a few too many over the top gross elements as well. And every time Monica Bellucci appears on screen, I felt like ripping my ears out. But the Clive Owen and Paul Giamatti are fun and the action is over the top. I guarantee that you have never seen some of these action scenes.

My companion commented that she felt maybe Owen was trying to prove that he would have made a good James Bond. He certainly has the chops to carry an action film.",1193616000,12,7852,4.582621082621083

Other than Planet Terror, I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that jept me breathless basically from beginning to end while exclaiming ""this is awesome!""

3234788,4,B000XA5K4I,"If there's at least one thing anyone can agree on about ""Shoot 'Em Up,"" it's that you know what you're getting.  Clive Owen as Mr. Smith runs hither and thither, shooting up people and things, munching on over-sized carrots and basically turning the world on with his song.  Er, his gun.  His many, many guns.  And that's it.  Should I go on?

I guess I should.

The plot is as contrived as the action: a pregnant woman is harrassed by about eighty bad guys who want to shoot her in the belly.  Smith, our reluctant hero, jumps in and starts killing people with carrots and severing umbilical cords with bullets.  After he absconds with the infant, he is chased relentlessly by a bug-eyed sniper named Hertz (Giamatti, who seems to LOVE being the smarmy, wise-cracking bad guy for once).  With the help of a lactating prostitute and his otherworldly prowess with a trigger, Smith figures out why this baby's life is on the line, and just why he should care.

At its most uncomfortable, the tale is basically about very evil men trying to pop a cap into a very cute infant.  At its most obtuse, the entire plot is one long commercial for ... wait for it ... gun control.  The irony, it needn't be said, is intentional, although the film's target audience may find it indecipherable (or, more likely, completely beside the point).  I suppose that's what you get when you try to make a movie that is both a weighty public service announcement AND an unflinching parody of itself.

Where the film falters (if at all), it isn't necessarily in the overkill.  In fact, if you think the movie is overdone, then you've already missed the point (or aren't a fan of the point; either way).  It's the movie's attempts to be consciously cute that stand out the most, much like the baby-in-a-bulletproof-vest that forms it's core.  Maybe I'm nit-picking, but it was good enough for me to have Smith gnawing away on that carrot and uttering things like, ""Eat your vegetables.""  Then the movie goes and gives him massive white bandages on his hands (which look like massive white gloves), and tosses him the line, ""What's up, Doc?""

I guess I'll take moments like these, where the self-consciousness oozes out of each hot, powdered frame.  Where Hertz, after Smith has escaped yet again, yells, ""Do we just suck, or is he really that good?""  Wry to a fault, though the film may be, it's also a teat full of testosterone, and any guy who's ever wanted the firepower of Wile E. Coyote and the panache of Bugs Bunny will probably be pleased.  After all, hold a Y chromosome up to your eye, and it looks an awful lot like a rifle-sight.",1193356800,2,2616,4.578494623655914
3234789,4,B000XA5K4I,"Shoot `Em Up was not at the top of my list to see but my wife and I like Clive Owen so we decided to give the film a look.  The story is as flimsy and ridiculous (a gun-control Senator creating a baby farm so he can have a supply of bone marrow) as they come and the characters are equally shallow: the entire point is to create as many different shoot outs as possible.  Humor in violence is nothing new in the cinema and what makes this film work is Clive Owen's performance as the carrot chewing Mr. Smith, an unlikely dark knight for the newborn he is protecting but certainly a cut above the odious Hertz (played with snarling fury by Paul Giammetti).  Monica Bellucci makes a great partner and foil for the indestructible Mr. Smith as they dodge bullets with the baby in tow.  The film takes in some situations that some of us will have empathy with, such as the driver of a Mercedes who doesn't use turn signals and cuts off other drivers, the final insult coming when he throws a paper cup out of his window.

The film comes off more like a PC game with its impossible situations and one-dimensional characters but also has the element of perverse fun that goes with a game.  However, some viewers will find the seemingly endless killing disturbing as the film tries to be more inventive as how to do away with the endless supply of bad guys.

Clive Owen was perfectly cast as a hard bitten man with no name and Monica Belluci was a joy to watch. Giamatti was surprisingly effective as the bad guy. The film started off excellently and simply got better. I didn't want the film to end and I hope they make a sequel.
If I had to compare it with a recent action movie, I suppose that in places it had the look and feel of Kill Bill 1 but was more gripping and more fun. It also had the sort of over the top action that  you might have seen in Charlie's Angels I/II. The end credits were reminiscent of a Bond movie.......",1189987200,2,672,4.209302325581396

Clive Owen made the most sense in Sin City, and there are maybe a few other movies where he was well-placed.

I guess every action-star has a film where they act too cool for school, nothing can touch them, and everybody else isn't as manly as they think they are.
I got that drift from ""Last Knight"", as well, but this one is even worse.

The whole carrot bit isn't even funny.
Makes it look like a comic sort of script when they do that kind of thing, and maybe that was the case here.

Clive Owen COULD make a great villain, if anyone ever had the common sense to cast him properly, rather than always going for the underdog pseudo-hero.
Paul Giamatti as the main bad-guy was absurd, by the way.

Can't count how many times they were at point-blank range, essentially, and his henchmen missed their shots.
This movie is all about watching Clive Owen kill people in silly ways.

Boring, really.
Otherwise, the production value was okay, the casting was poor, the acting was whatever, and the plot was lame.

The first time Clive Owen takes a bullet is at the end of the movie, when he jumps out of a plane, and dudes are shooting him as they are all falling.
They can't hit him ten feet away, in a hallway, but they can tag him as they are hurdling through the sky.

It's one of those movies where somebody had a variety of ideas for action scenes they thought would be cool, so everything was about making the story work around those action scenes.
Monica Bellucci is probably one of the most beautiful women in the world, so she could be included in pretty much any action movie, and distract everyone from its flaws.

Overall, it's a brain-dead kind of film, full of pretense, no substance, and a lot of dead henchmen.
The bro-bro kind of guys will enjoy it. (heh)

I counted 4-6 kills using a Carrot.",1513814400,,1823,4.401785714285714
