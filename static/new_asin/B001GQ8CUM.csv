8306659,5,B001GQ8CUM,"Was really happy to see this movie again after 35 years.  Took me back to my childhood days of seeing a movie filmed in the Greece I used to know when I was a kid.  The movie was not Oscar winning material - but actors like Jean-Paul Belmondo and Omar Shariff just don't exist anymore!  Classic movie, corny, and absolutely fun to watch!  A really cool movie of the 70s!",1520899200,,370,4.242857142857143
8306660,2,B001GQ8CUM,I probably would have liked it but it was advertised as 'All Regions'. When inserted it came up as 'Incompatible wrong region'. Check with supplier before ordering this.,1487376000,,169,5.071428571428571
8306661,5,B001GQ8CUM,Beautiful clear print. Loved the movie. The soundtrack is mono and what can you expect from a 1971 movie? But the print was beautiful,1484784000,,133,4.583333333333333
8306662,5,B001GQ8CUM,"Classic Heist Film of the 1970's, THE BURGLARS is an excellent heist caper film in the same league as RIFIFI, TOPKAPI, OCEAN'S ELEVEN(both the 1960's version as well as the recent one directed by Steven Sodenburgh) and THE ANDERSON TAPES, filmed on location in Greece and directed by Henri Venueil who specialized in such action films like THE SICILIAN CLAN, THE SERPENT and FEAR IN THE CITY aka THE NIGHT CALLER also starring Jean Paul Belmondo. In this film, Belmondo plays master cat burglar Asad who with his gang performs an elaborate heist of precious emeralds from a rich socialite's villa in Greece. Due to travel complications, the gang can't leave the country within a week and they are being pursued by a tenacious crooked police detective marvelously played by Omar Sharif who wants the emerald for himself. Then Belmondo and Sharif play a very dangerous cat and mouse game between them to see which one of them ends up with the emeralds with luscious Dyan Cannon as the bait. There are great car chase scenes similar to the ones in BULLITT and THE FRENCH CONNECTION courtesy of Remy Julianne and his stunt team but Belmondo himself performed all of his outrageous stunts in this film that must be seen to be believed! The icing on the cake is the marvelous buoyant score by Maestro Ennio Morrecone . The DVD has both the US release version which is 113 minutes long and the International Version in French with English subtitles which is 125 minutes long because THE BURGLARS was that rare film filmed suimultaneously in both English and French language versions. I heartfully recommend the International Version which is on this DVD because it is the Director's Cut of the film which is longer and has the complete ending of the film that is abruptly cut in the US Version. Thanks to Sony Columbia Home Video for finally releasing this action classic on video in the US at last in a digitally restored and remastered version.",1479686400,5,1939,4.773809523809524

8306664,1,B001GQ8CUM,"This DVD has green lines running through most of the movie, very distracting to watch, poor quality and not worth the price.",1398124800,,124,4.681818181818182
8306665,2,B001GQ8CUM,"The quality of this DVD is of very poor,  it almost looks like a very bad pirate copy!! has a green line down the middle scaring on the film. Which is a shame as Its quite a good film although dated.

The suppler of the film was good prompt kept me informed of the progress when posted how long estimated arrival time excellent.",1254009600,5,328,4.190476190476191
8306666,3,B001GQ8CUM,"In 'The Burglars,' Omar Sharif drives a Fiat in hot pursuit of Belmondo through apparently Athens' busy streets, up and down flights of steps, across pavements, anywhere and everywhere; it's great fun, but it holds up the plot for some time of the film and has no real bearing on the story... It appears to have been included only for the purpose of introducing an auto-chase, because when Sharif finally catches up with Belmondo's damaged car, the pair exchange a few words and drive away...

Apart from this failure to further the plot, the chase is very well done indeed, and at times the wildly spinning cars almost seem to be part of an automobile ballet...

Omar Sharif - an unlikely choice for a tough policeman - plays the part of an Istanbul detective turned crooked... He discovers a plot to carry out a big robbery and at once sees his chance to cut himself in for a slice of the cake... Whether he was determined before is never been evident, but from the moment he decides to blackmail the villains for a good part of money, he becomes a one-man tornado...

There is a scene where he orders his police escort to remain behind while he investigates a cellar alone... The crooks are there all right, but it is not his intention to capture them... He just means to force them to pay up... In cold blood, he shoots one of the gang to prove his point...

France has produced many good screen actors - Alain Delon and Jean Gabin, the solid, heavyweight gangster, are two who have become famous... Jean-Paul Belmondo is in a different category... He is tough, he fights hard, and he is a mixture of hero and villain...

In 'The Burglars,' he is certainly crooked, definitely a bit of a hoodlum, yet one cannot help liking him... There's a good deal of the Douglas Fairbanks athlete-type in Belmondo, and this can be seen in the film, particularly in the sequence in which he jumps from buses to cars and back again while being chased by Sharif...",1233187200,5,1952,4.54985754985755
