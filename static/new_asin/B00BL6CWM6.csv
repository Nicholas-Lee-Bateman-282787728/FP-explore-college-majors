I love good Christian films and this is not one.  As it ended, our whole family just balked, and the kids we're like ""Are you kidding me? This was horrible.""  The music is awkward, the acting is just BAD, and the story line is so weak.  Make sure that if you have to watch it, that you rent it.  And please, don't give this as a gift, it's just an embarrassment to the Christian film industry.  I trusted this as a Dove award winner and should have read up on it more.  It is  not a good family film.  If you want a better film, move over to Hidden Secrets, or To Save A Life they are much better than this.  I usually don't write ratings but just had to on this one.  And by the way, I did buy this, all 14 bucks worth.  It did however move through the shredder just fine with no problems at all.",1367193600,5,972,4.052631578947368
5641935,4,B00BL6CWM6,"A robbery gone bad and things/people aren't what they seem. Was I entertained, YES, was the storyline plausable, YES, will I watch it again, MORE THAN LIKELY. It's nice to know that there are people out there that can make a decent movie without a multimillion dollar star studded cast and a $100M of GCI effects.",1365724800,,313,4.607142857142857
5641936,5,B00BL6CWM6,"I loved this movie! I wish that I could write in-depth about how each of the characters' roles specifically relates to my own life, but I don't want to spoil the plot for those who haven't seen it.

However, I will say this much...

In my own life, I've experienced the emotions of wanting to leap from a bridge, only to transform that emotion into a fearless desire to defend others. I've known the years of feeling absolutely happy and secure with family members, only have them ripped away, and then wanting to seek revenge on the entire world around me. I know the stress and despair that individuals and couples feel when money is low, and I also know the roller-coaster of emotion caused by infidelity. In the end, I've come to realize that everything I've experienced in my own life, good or bad, has been for a beautiful purpose far too great for my initial understanding. If not for knowing such extreme highs and lows in my life, I wouldn't be in a position to educate, inspire, and save others in the way that I currently do. This film tells a powerful story about God, faith, Jesus, and Christianity in a very direct and refreshing way that is seldom seen in Hollywood films. After the credits were finished, I watched behind-the-scenes footage and learned of the many struggles experienced by the writer and producers as they sought funding to make Crossroad a reality. I found their story to be equally as inspiring as the film itself! Crossroad was handmade with passion, faith, persistence, community, and God's watchful eye. I highly recommend Crossroad to all people, of all ages, from all walks of life and religious beliefs. Indeed, there's a beautiful message in this film for everyone!

Sincerely,

Jon Ross",1363824000,9,1729,4.73421926910299
5641937,5,B00BL6CWM6,"As someone who has personally experienced a rash of coincidences and synchronicities in recent days, I truly appreciated the beautiful tapestry that this film has woven as it exemplifies all of our connections through God and the Universe.  The encounters in this film are not by chance and each of the participants walks away changed and more connected to themselves, to others, to faith, God and the universe.  Understanding, forgiveness, second changes and ultimately redemption are what allow the characters in Crossroad to move on from what is holding each of them back.  A touching gem of a film.",1363305600,8,602,5.0606060606060606
5641938,5,B00BL6CWM6,"I totally loved it!! I have already watched 2X!!!! If you want to watch a movie with your family & not feel uncomfortable this is the movie to watch!! I will recommend it to everyone I know!! It's got a great undertone but not in your face!! It's got many twists to it & will keep you on your toes & guessing the ending!! Loved the characters anyone can relate to one or two of the characters, its a true feel good movie it's one of my favorite movies since the Movie ""Pay it forward""!! Thank you!!",1363305600,,498,4.144329896907217
5641939,5,B00BL6CWM6,"Crossroad is an amazing journey of one man's path to forgiveness and redemption.  This is the first movie I have ever seen that was a Christian Thriller.  I appreciated the fact that it was appropriate for my children to see as well as adults.

I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for an uplifting drama that will leave you a better person for having watched it.",1362614400,9,374,4.470588235294118

5641961,5,B00BL6CWM6,"Excellent story regarding forgiveness.  Some characters stories were left open that left me hanging, but overall a great movie that made me cry, a good cry that truly impacted me.",1403308800,,179,4.966666666666667
5641962,1,B00BL6CWM6,"I can enjoy a B rated movie if the story is at least attempting to give a worthwhile message. This was poorly written and acted. The story line was jumbled. Lots of emotionless expressions, for melodramatic seriousness. Undeveloped chartacters. I was thinking of the expense the production must have been, because quality equipment must have been used and the credit roll looked completely legitimatent ( I read it carefully to see which denomination sponsored it). My opinion is this money could have been easily better spent. I had read a couple of the 5 star reviews and kept think it would get better and the story line  would have  some redeeming value, I was wrong. The protagonist had a line about ... long and drawn out..... purple fruit loops having a purpose because God made them. This was a scene meant to be emotionally moving.
I advise you to choose another movie.",1402704000,3,878,4.769736842105263
5641963,5,B00BL6CWM6,"I thought it was very interesting and good for family, not super young family because of guns.  However it is exciting and interesting without usual bad taste hollywood",1402617600,,168,5.0

5641965,4,B00BL6CWM6,The movie kept my attention and could be a family movie with children who understand that there is Sin in the world.  I like the redemptive message and the Christian base.,1399248000,,171,4.516129032258065
5641966,5,B00BL6CWM6,"Crossroad was God filled, and Holy Spirit inspired! I recommend this movie for all audiences. My faith have been renewed!",1399248000,,121,5.1
5641967,5,B00BL6CWM6,"Very impressed with this movie and also the story of how God made a way for it to be made.  Once again, I am excited to see how Christian or faith-based movies are being produced more and more, even making it into the theaters!  You will be blessed by watching this movie....it will move you to tears, you may laugh once in awhile and then find yourself in a sobering state of mind.  No one will be disappointed taking the time to buy and/or watch this movie.  Thanks goes to the writers and producers and the gentleman who made a way financially because of his own love for the Lord, to fund this production!!!",1399075200,,611,4.333333333333333

5642010,3,B00BL6CWM6,I love Christian movies but this one was a weird one.  Lots of deep issues and I would NOT call this a family film.  It was interesting and they certainly talked about God but it was just weird.,1395187200,,194,4.078947368421052
5642011,5,B00BL6CWM6,I bought Crossroad after a friend recommended it to me. I really liked the message delivered in this movie. Life is about forgiveness and second chances. Well done.,1393113600,,164,4.892857142857143
5642012,4,B00BL6CWM6,"Very suspenseful, very good family movie. Kept us guessing and gave positive message about forgiveness. Would recommend to other friends and family.",1392076800,,148,5.7727272727272725
5642013,1,B00BL6CWM6,This movie went nowhere slowly.  I was disappointed as I enjoy movies with a thought provoking message.  This was not it.,1391817600,2,121,4.714285714285714
5642014,5,B00BL6CWM6,The cinematography was great for the film.  I personally would have liked more camera movement on the robbery scenes.  Overall it was a great storyline with believable actors.,1388102400,,175,5.214285714285714
5642015,2,B00BL6CWM6,"Into this fifteen minutes and I immediately had the sense this is an amateurish made production. I don't mean it looks bad. Not at all. It's just that I didn't believe the actors! No charisma at all. There's  tension but it's contrived. The entire fifteen minutes felt CONTRIVED. I had no desire to continue watching.
Perhaps with  talented actors, this might be a better movie??? Maybe.",1387411200,,387,4.848484848484849
5642016,5,B00BL6CWM6,"I enjoyed the confluence in the story line that revealed the past and present influence the characters had on each other. The final result of redemption for the characters who trusted God and destruction for those who trusted their own ability is a reflection on all of us. Choice does matter because it will surely have consequences........blessings if you give it to God or pain and misery in your life and all who know you if you don't trust him. I can vouch for this personally. Seven years of pain because God told me ""no"" and I didn't listen. Thank God that even though there were consequences he has turned those to blessings to all of us who were involved. God is good.

5642017,5,B00BL6CWM6,"It was a real surprise to see how all the lives of the people in the diner were intertwined in one way or another. How they were brought together for a reason at a specific time and place. Kept us wondering how it was going to end. Great movie involving Faith,Love and forgiveness.",1380412800,,281,4.320754716981132
5642018,1,B00BL6CWM6,"This was like a cheap imitation of ""The Encounter"" I was bored more than half the time and the actors were slow and terrible. The plot was the worst part and didn't make sense. I'd say definitely skip this one and go straight to ""The Encounter.""",1372291200,3,245,4.3478260869565215
5642019,5,B00BL6CWM6,"This is a story with a strong moral center, showing consequences for one's choices, and how far reaching those can be.  The performances and production values are great, the message is clear, and the bonus features at the end are an added plus.  Definitely a film I will and have recommend to my friends and family.",1367884800,,315,4.607142857142857

8570205,5,B00BL6CWM6,"A film overflowing with God's love and grace if we come to it as seekers of truth. We as viewers of faith based films must bring expectations beyond that of great plotting, acting, directing and production of a film. Seeing God working through us and/or among us in a film is a blessing often overlooked or under appreciated. We as believers thirst for such films. It reminds us not only of God's promises, but also of what being in His presence feels like.

My advice to viewers of this film is to try seeking glimpses of God throughout this movie.  Try seeking Him not so much in the action and emotionally charged drama scenes but in those scenes of silence and enlightenment. Scenes where the characters are sharing moments of care, love, forgiveness, empathy. When you might least expect the presence of God, it is in those moments that He is there with you. I felt the hurt, anger, healing and forgiveness in this film. And yes, we would have to become as children again to appreciate the wisdom of God in giving us purple cereal.",1479081600,,1036,4.564516129032258
8570206,3,B00BL6CWM6,acting was good but ending was not biblically based and was not that good,1453939200,,73,4.285714285714286
8570207,1,B00BL6CWM6,"The movie starts off with good intentions and the script may have had some promise but... The director and producer dropped the ball.

Every character makes unrealistic decisions thought the movie. Hard to find a scene or line that makes sense. Too many to list here.

No coffe shop robery would take more than 60 seconds. Unbelievable this turned into a 45 minute scene.

By the end of the movie I didn't care about any of the characters.",1453507200,,439,4.602564102564102
8570208,5,B00BL6CWM6,You must see this movie! I don't remember it going to the big screen?  Unsuspected twist and an unpredictable ending!,1436400000,,117,4.85
8570209,2,B00BL6CWM6,"We were enjoying the movie, being a little troubled by some aspects of it, until we got to the quote by John Muir at the high point. It threw the film into an entirely different place than Biblical / Evangelical Christianity. Some of the acting was good, but the direction had much to be desired and the theology was very muddled--a strange syncretistic mixture of Biblical Christianity and New Age.",1410220800,,399,4.714285714285714

8570212,3,B00BL6CWM6,Enjoyed the movie right up until the end and then it seemed that it didn't bring closure or it was weak in doing that.  That was disappointing.,1404691200,,143,4.296296296296297
8570213,5,B00BL6CWM6,It's rather hard to write a review through tears. I loved this movie and the way it showed that there are no coincidences. We are all connected in the good and the bad of life. God does work all together for good. I only wish it went into the back stories of a the characters. This movie will touch your heart. We need more movies like this. I'm going to recommend Crossroad to all my friends. Thank you for offering this on prime.,1404518400,,431,4.204819277108434
