8326420,5,B001EKU5CS,I loved this movie ! It was a bit awkward at first with so little dialog but after awhile the facial expressions tell the story w/o many words. It's a movie love story that ends with the odds against both of them. Both the main actors were superb in their portrayal and left me with a longing for that kind of mutual affection set under such strengthening odds.  Oh and David McCallum was beautifully handsome in this portrayal.  Loved it so much . Wsh I could find a region 1 version to play in the us tho!!,1419811200,,508,4.22680412371134
8326421,1,B001EKU5CS,Why would you sell it if it won't play. Duh. Even if it would play it appears it would only be in Italian without even subtitles.,1356393600,,129,4.0

McCallum portays Sgt. Holmann, a WWII German officer, assigned to take out a group of resistance fighters in Yugoslavia. Sgt. Holmann accomplishes his mission, capturing the leader of the resistance group, a clever and deadly young woman named Anja.

At the time of Anja's capture, a heavy blizzard blankets the ravine that separates Holmann from his German regiment and Anja from the resistance, and the two take shelter in a small abandoned cabin. Insulated from the war by the heavy winter storms, Holmann and Anja's relationship evolves from distrust and hostility to love and companionability.

As the weather clears, the war approaches. Holmann realizes that their brief time of intimate seclusion is over, and they cannot continue together. He must make the choice between delivering the young woman he now loves to the Germans as a prisoner or setting her free and allowing her a chance at escape. What Holmann doesn't realize is the extent to which either choice will have deadly consequences.

Although the dialogue is Italian, there is not a lot of dialogue after Holmann is given his assignment to capture Anja, and it is not difficult to discern the basic context of the dialogue. I do not recall if English subtitling is available on the DVD version.

It has been several years since I watched the movie in the English PAL VHS version. I own the movie in both the English VHS PAL format and the Italian DVD. As I recall, the Italian version depicts slightly more intimacy between Holmann and Anja.

This movie is a highly sought by McCallum fans. McCallum's performance in ""La Cattura"" (""The Ravine"") does not disappoint. He has an affinity for WWII-era films and portrays British and German officers well. His WWII genre credits include ""The Great Escape"", ""Mosquito Squadron"", ""Colditz"" (the BBC series), and ""Behind Enemy Lines"".",1300579200,6,1856,5.03257328990228
