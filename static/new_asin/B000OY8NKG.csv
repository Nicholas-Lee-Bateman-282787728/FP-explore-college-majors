2804251,1,B000OY8NKG,"I ordered this product and received a pack of HD-DVDs about many places, not just Costa Rica. This is advertised as a DVD, which I can play. It was HD-DVD, which is of no use to me. Also, it was a multipack of HD-DVDs with lots of different locales featured in shorter vignettes. This is not anything like the description. I was able to get Amazon to refund my money and shipping without difficulty, but was disappointed as this was going to be a present.",1197244800,2,455,4.364705882352941
2804252,1,B000OY8NKG,I ordered a DVD that was supposed to be 60-minutes on the Living Landscapes of Costa Rica. Instead I was shipped several 20 minute DVDs of assorted places.  It's nice that I received extra DVDs but it's not what I ordered.,1191110400,6,222,4.414634146341464

2804373,5,B000OY8NKG,"Loved this Costa Rica video. I don't know why I thought it was going to be informational, but it wasn't. It was more of a very relaxing tour through the rain forest of Costa Rica. The sound track and all of the nature sounds are very soothing. I turn it on sometimes just to relax. :)",1406332800,2,284,4.089285714285714

2804376,5,B000OY8NKG,"I don't know why people rate items based on order errors from Amazon, also the descrption of this item is that it is a relaxation dvd of footage set to music.  For those of us who know that this is what we are getting, there will not be disappointment in this title, or any other from this series.  I have been to Costa Rica, and this dvd is a lovely, relaxing day ender and a reminder of my great trip.  If you are looking for a quality relaxation dvd, this series is for you.  On future releases, I do make the wish that the producers would allow the music to be turned off and a natural sounds only option be added.",1216512000,7,618,4.082644628099174
