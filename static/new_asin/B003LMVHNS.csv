4153547,4,B003LMVHNS,"""The Greater Meaning of Water"" skimps on story, and instead aims to put us in the same metaphysical and meditative mood as the lead character, a freediver with a physical ailment that is only absent when he's 300 feet under the water.

Director Sky Christopherson fills his debut with scenes doused in blue light, a lead actor who plays one emotion and a soundtrack that could enahnce any yoga session. I suppose there is no other way to film a story about freediving, which is an extreme sport but a polar opposite in the mental sense to snowboarding or motorbiking. I had hoped for more drama surrounding Max's disability and how it affected his relationship with his best friend and his father. But by amping the dramatic elements, you lose the philosophical journey Max takes, and I praise Christopherson for not over-dramatizing many scenes in the film. This is the type of film a Buddhist monk would make.

I would be interested in seeing this film expanded by 30 minutes, if only to tell more of Max's backstory and how his physical disability and freediving became linked together.

Without giving much away, the final scene initially felt like a letdown in terms of plot. But after a few minutes of reflection, I felt that -- as Max likely did -- the destination is not as important as the journey.",1296259200,3,1307,4.698689956331878
4153548,5,B003LMVHNS,"Greater Meaning of Water is precisely what can happen when a film is produced on less than a shoestring budget, the actors and crew are learning their craft, and the director has intelligence, a sense of wonder, and is doing the job of constantly pulling-focus in his own heart and mind while guiding his vision. The title is brilliantly metaphor-ed...Thanks, Sky. Very notable.",1294012800,3,378,5.015873015873016
4153549,5,B003LMVHNS,"Although the movie is about free-diving, in more abstract terms I think the story is a great metaphor (the 'greater meaning') about the concept of sport and the pursuit/drive to excel despite adversity and the various obstacles life puts in our way. I thought it was awesome.",1294012800,4,275,4.872340425531915
4153550,5,B003LMVHNS,"The subject of freediving has been inspirational for several movies in the previous 25 years. Why do people do this sport? Is it about the records? Is it about taking risks? Or is it something else?

In ""The Big Blue"" , Luc Besson tried to explain it with an story about two competing individuals with a different background. In Alki David's ""The Freediver"" a clear, but rather individual, explanation is given for the motivation of the main character. However, until now, only the musician  in ""Phoenix Blue"" is able to come close by the explanation that freediving is freedom. Although an attempt is made, none of the movies is really successful to give the audience insight why freediving is special and why some people choose to immerse themselves into this sport.

""The Greater Meaning of Water"" takes an different approach. The whole movie is as realistic as possible about freediving and sports medicine, which gives almost an documentary like impression. At the same time the use of symbolism and images are effectively used to explain things that cannot be explained in words. Not only freediving, but also the phenomena known as flow is explained, and the depth of the movie is further increased by addressing the ethical problems surrounding the combination of  chronic illness and performing sports.

""The Greater Meaning of Water"" successfully achieve to give the audience an understanding why free divers choose to dive, and gives insight what athlete's are searching for. The images are stunning and the use of symbolism is innovative. In other words: Sky Christoperson debut  is nothing less than an master piece.",1293753600,6,1629,5.059701492537314
4153551,5,B003LMVHNS,"I have just received this DVD which was shipped to my home in Germany (in EU DVD format). The movie was an instant winner: Great plot, stunning aesthetic, very credible acting, immaculate music score and great spiritual depth. If you like ""The Big Blue"" or Michael Mann's directing, you will definitely love this independent movie which does not have anything reminding you of an independent film project. The whole look and feel is real Hollywood stuff.",1293667200,5,454,4.9868421052631575
4153552,5,B003LMVHNS,wait for the insight into the plot. great performance by the 2 main actors. excellent cinematography and well choreographed music. a must see independent film with an unforgetable look into the US olympic training center.,1292976000,3,221,5.3428571428571425
4153553,5,B003LMVHNS,"Has all the ingredients of a great independent film.  Amazing cinematography and a story that keeps you thinking the whole way through, asking questions about yourself, about life, and about human nature.",1292803200,5,204,5.375
4153554,5,B003LMVHNS,"The Greater Meaning of Water is a movie that needs to be watched more than once to be appreciated. In today's age of Hollywood formula, this feature breaks the mold by relying on the nuance and mystical nature of freediving, an extreme sport which few people might relate to. It is so fascinating and watcheable because most people don't even know what freediving is. Freediving is practiced every day by spearfishermen, and competetive record seekers. Many people take up freediving to challenge themselves and see how deep they can go. Once we are comfortable in the water we realize we can hold our breaths long enough to really see a lot of the ocean.
With a cinematography of deep blues, shadows and suffocated lighting, we see the struggle of a single freediver to discover his potential and come to the realization that records don't mean as much as living in the zen of the moment.",1341878400,,889,4.741935483870968
4153555,3,B003LMVHNS,"I love freediving, and I love every tidbit I can find about freediving, but...  This dvd wouldn't play on my PS3, I had to watch it on the computer.  It was too dark and I couldn't see all of it clearly.  The acting was mediocre.  I've seen much better and more inspirational videos on youtube.  This movie was over before it really got started.  Somebody compared it to The Big Blue.  No comparison.  This movie fell flat.  IMHO",1326844800,3,429,4.397435897435898
4153556,5,B003LMVHNS,pictures are wonderful and excellent narration and music. theme is perfectly documented. nobody dies! very positive movie! give a great sense of meaning of life and why we can accept so much privation to become better.i love it!,1316822400,,228,5.026315789473684
4153557,2,B003LMVHNS,this product was very dissapointing the movie was very very short like 45min i watched the trailer and the featurett  before i bought it which gave me very high hopes for the movie my advice is just watch the featurett it has all the good parts and it won't cost you 20bucks over all if your in to free diving don't get the movie .,1311897600,2,331,4.092307692307692
4153558,2,B003LMVHNS,"The film has a great story, beautiful photography but unfortunately feels flat most of the time because the acting overall sucks. The director could have helped a few of the unprofessional actors go further but he did not. The main lead seems to have some potential but he too seems to have lacked good directing. The music was decent though could have been better at times. This was a natural candidate for openings in major fests like Toronto, Venice, Sundance, Locarno.  This still remains a decent niche film that will reach
audiences interested in the sport but it could have reached a wider audience with better actors.",1310947200,3,625,4.841121495327103
4153559,1,B003LMVHNS,"I dive for many years now.
I love diving and every thing that included in it.
For years I'm looking for a moovy that will b a bit like ""The big Blue""
When I saw that there is a moovy about free diving I thought it might be a bit like this moovy that I love so I bought it.
What a mistake - instad of moovy about the joy in free diving I saw a dipressing moovy about illness that dosen't even look real since it dosen't seem possible for free diver to have sistic fibrosis.
I got so dipressed from the moovy.
If I knew I would never by it

4153560,3,B003LMVHNS,"I bought this DVD because I'm interested in freediving, and the choices are pretty slim for that genre. The reviews made it sound well worth the risk, but I was a little disappointed. I don't think it's up there with The Big Blue. For one thing, the movie is very short (right about an hour), so it doesn't give it much time to develop. Some of the acting is very poor, and the freediving that is shown in the ocean is very limited. There is a little bit of interesting material on the sport, but I'm not sure that it's worth owning it.",1306800000,2,536,4.213592233009709
4153561,2,B003LMVHNS,"The good:
- great cinematography
- an honest and unpretentious story

The bad:
-less than 1 hour long
-little underwater footage
-feels very amateurish at times

As a short I think this movie is a success, especially considering the $25,000 budget. However I found the move ultimately disappointing because it is more a story about a struggling athlete  than it is about freediving.",1299628800,,382,5.031746031746032
4153562,5,B003LMVHNS,"Great movie about freediving and the flow experience. The visuals are a amazing, great images of diving and the ocean - especially many nice under water shots. The soundtrack perfectly matches the visuals and the story. I am not sure whether this is the very first movie to capture the flow experience explicitly but it is the first that I have seen. (Why are there not more movies about this?) Anyway, it does a great job in showing some essentials of why people do what they do and it made me think about motivation and the potentials of human experience. While the characters lack some depth and I didn't feel to really get to ""know"" them, this did not spoil the movie. Altogether: Highly recommended.",1296432000,3,704,4.64
4153563,5,B003LMVHNS,"""The Greater Meaning of Water"" speaks to me. The seriousness of Max Avery, beautifully played by newcomer Justin Williford, quickly draws the viewer's attention to the intense conditions freedivers encounter. Clearly, Justin Williford must have had to endure some serious training in order to play the role of Max so seemingly effortlessly. Through Max's journey, the audience is able to experience the nuances all elite athletes face coupled with political forces which may arise either for or against them.

The complexities of ""The Greater Meaning of Water"" reveal fundamental questions of why freedivers and athletes alike are driven to compete and successfully demonstrate, how through their courage and fortitude they achieve one of life's greater experiences: flow. The narrative of this film is a symbolic vessel exploring a variety of themes fundamental to humans as Max Avery pursues breaking the free diving record.  While pushing himself to the edge of reality, in part to survive a medical condition, Max discovers bliss within the healing forces of water. A provocative notion so gorgeously presented through the incredible direction of Sky Christopherson, whose keen sensibilities of cinematography has captured powerfully beautiful images continually throughout the film.

I highly recommend this independent film to everyone, even those whose interests do not include the sport of freediving; this heroes' journey will inspire everyone who sees it.",1296345600,9,1465,5.59009009009009

8399746,1,B003LMVHNS,"I was pretty excited to finally get to see another Freediving Movie.  Ever since The Big Blue I was left with a want for more.  This was my chance and I am sad to say it was a complete waste of my money and my time.  I am an amateur freediver but know enough to say that the movie devotes ony the beginning and the end to freediving, the rest is a pseudo-spiritual emotional wannabe docudrama that honestly seems more like a bad college project or a bad soap opera.  The acting is bad and seems very forced.  The Dialogues are cheesy, to say the least, and the music is predictable and monotonous.  The only two scenes about Freediving are good but only last about 2 minutes each.  In other words, not a movie about freediving, a movie that has two freediving scenes in it.  Do not recommend it all.  Two thumbs down.  Sorry if I was too harsh but I was really disappointed.",1374537600,2,874,4.274390243902439

8399749,1,B003LMVHNS,"I am really sorry,but speak about the big blue concerning this film is completely not appropriate.
Only 5 minutes of this film takes place in the sea, all other is talking about the main character's life.
He has some health problems and family problems and the film turn around these points....

I dislike it, yet, I love all film dealing with apnea, sea, and other (even independent one) but this one is really not dealing with apnea.
Bad film.",1355875200,2,445,4.632911392405063

8399751,1,B003LMVHNS,"This movie was such a let down.

I would not recommend any body purchase this dvd.  The story was weak and acting was even worse.  Maybe a low budget film but there is no way this movie can be compared to The Big Blue.

Anyway please don't waste your money..",1346630400,,258,4.1
