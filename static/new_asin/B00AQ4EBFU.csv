A nurse tells Corvo about a search for a recording. At night Corvo gets out of bed and looks into a mirror! Then he leaves the hospital and drives away. Corvo listens to the recording of Mrs. Randolph speaking to Dr. Sutton. Next the police detective and the Suttons arrive at that apartment. Bill talks to Ann, can he get her to remember? But Corvo appears with a revolver in his hand! The police detective calls for an ambulance.

This story starts out slow but gets more interesting in the second half. It depends on the idea that a person can be hypnotized to perform an illegal or immoral act. Is this true or fiction? A lot or people don't have to be hypnotized to do that. This seems like a low budget production given the cast and story. The Asphalt Jungle is a better movie from 1949, after watching it you may find the novel is better.",1511654400,,2370,4.703614457831326
