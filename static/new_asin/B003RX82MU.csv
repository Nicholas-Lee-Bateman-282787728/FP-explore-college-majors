8403905,5,B003RX82MU,"Anyone who is serious, passionate, obsessed or just remotely interested in the game of golf has to put this title on their must see list. It is thorough, comprehensive, wonderfully presented & just great viewing. I couldn't even bring myself to pause the DVD, for fear of missing a word, even for life's essentials! (Please do not try that at home!). This was so good I couldn't wait to tell my golf crazy friends about it as well. Bring on the next one!",1320278400,7,454,4.481927710843373
