4515268,5,B0050MB5PC,These are films that I grew up watching on the Holidays.  A family tradition to watch after church and eating holiday feast.,1363132800,3,124,4.636363636363637
4515269,5,B0050MB5PC,Four memorable movies on 4 discs in one case. Perfect scenario for pouring some egg nog and settling in to watch and remember. Audio and video quality is acceptable. About as good as you can get. I remember watching these on our 1957 Zenith B&W TV over broadcast TV with a rooftop antenna. Enjoyed every minute then. No pause or rewind in those days. I recommend this set.,1358812800,17,372,4.485294117647059
4515270,5,B0050MB5PC,A great value for all 4 Classic films. We all enjoyed the classics on Christmas day. Recommend to all generations.,1358035200,3,114,4.75
4515271,5,B0050MB5PC,I mainly bought this group of movies because I don't have a good VHS tape of the Signing Nun.  I already have the rest of the movies that came with this group.  I just might sell them off.,1354406400,2,188,3.9210526315789473

4515273,5,B0050MB5PC,"I purchased these movies to watch with my mother on a visit. We thoroughly enjoyed them. The movies are on individual discs, which made it easy for Mom to set them up. These are wonderful family movies.",1349222400,14,202,4.486486486486487
4515294,5,B0050MB5PC,This is a great group of old classic Christmas movies.  Christmas in Connecticut is one of my all time favorites and this early rendition of Charles Dickens A Christmas Carol with Reginald Owen has to be the best of all the ones I have seen.  Boys Town is a real classic and one everyone should see and The Singing Nun was the only one I was unfamiliar with but enjoyed just the same. What a great buy.,1517270400,2,402,4.207792207792208

4515311,5,B0050MB5PC,"I must admit that I am a sucker for old movies -- after all, I was brought up seeing them!  My favorite is ""Christmas in Connecticut"".  This film would probably be considered by many to be 'corny' today, but I still enjoy 'happy ending' movies.  The film is in the original black and white which just makes it all the more charming to me.  I hadn't seen ""Boys Town"" or ""The Singing Nun"" for many years but still enjoyed them as much as ever.  It is nice to see movies where the characters didn't have to depend on computers, laptops, smart phones, etc. -- they just talked to one another in person.",1478476800,2,598,4.303571428571429

4515313,5,B0050MB5PC,"Great set of films.  This set includes my favorite version of ""A Christmas Carol"".  ""Christmas in Connecticut""  however is a perfect film to watch on a cold Winters Night.  My only problem with his set is that ""A Christmas Carol"" had a colorized version made years ago.  That was released on vhs years ago but has never made it on DVD.",1470528000,2,335,4.426229508196721
4515324,4,B0050MB5PC,"It was a pleasure to re-visit beloved films (only two related to Christmas) - which presented a nostalgia fest for me. This is major relaxation on a disc, the more for those of us of mature years - though younger adults may be assured that these films are completely suited to family viewing, even with the youngest of children.
The only small disappointment was that the disc for Boys Town said, in the menu, that ""Men of Boys Town,"" and other special features, were on the reverse side - where all the reverse yields is a disc error.
I highly recommend this disc set (though I bought the second-hand version for a very reasonable cost.)",1470096000,5,638,4.556521739130435
4515325,4,B0050MB5PC,"The movie classics show how Hollywood made excellent movies before the 1970s and the twenty-first century.  The plot of the story was excellent and at the end you learn a moral lesson.  Finally, majority of the movies made between 1930 and 1960 were family oriented and they were also entertaining.",1467244800,5,298,4.94
