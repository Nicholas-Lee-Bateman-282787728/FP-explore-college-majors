3140839,4,B00157S18U,"This DVD is a gem.  Wilfred Brimley does a good job as narrator.  His voice is filled with character, yet mellow and easy to follow.

The film starts at the canyon stable on the South Rim, where wranglers catch and saddle the mules in preparation for the day's ride.  This brief behind-the-scenes footage is an extra treat.  From there, we see the mules being led to Stone Corral and riders instructed (in a most entertaining way) about a few safety aspects. Then it's down the Bright Angel Trail...

The mule train stops at Indian Gardens for lunch, then continues on to the hair-raising Devil's Corkscrew.  The day ends in the bottom of the canyon at scenic Phantom Ranch. Viewers get a peak in the kitchen and at the dinner table during serving time, which will make your mouth water.  A few scenes later, it's sunrise the following morning and riders are in the saddle again, heading back up to the rim on the Kaibab Trail. This chapter of the film contains some of the most spectacular canyon views.

This DVD is a splendid combination of actual footage from the saddle combined with a multitude of interesting facts about mules and the folks who handle them, park history (with photos), and humorous tales from some of the guides. For a 40-minute video, it's impressively complete and sure covers a lot.

The film was shot in 1990 and is slightly grainy.  I deduct a point for this. Wish they would offer it in BluRay high-def., as this technology is available and the footage would be stunning.

This is the DVD I often turn to when I need a little R&R.  I've viewed this disc far more times than I can count, not only because the GC mule trip is a dream of mine, but because it's just so relaxing to watch.  For those of us who love the Grand Canyon, mules, or both, this one's a keeper.  While some of us can't make the trek there right now, it's delightful to be able to have the virtual experience for a mere $15.",1364428800,2,1924,4.457142857142857

3140847,5,B00157S18U,"The trip of a lifetime. It's very scary at first, but you soon relax. The Grand Canyon is amazing inside. I never knew there were grassy , areas and shade spots. The colors inside always show continual changes as you ride down. We had a rest stop and we were treated to box lunches. The mules are rested frequently, so we had time to soak up the beauty. When we got to Phantom Ranch they treated us to a huge steak dinner. We had fun in the canteen, laughing it up with our fellow riders. Just a great group to be with. We had a cozy little cabin and we slept like rocks. When you get up it was straight to the canteen for a huge breakfast, pancakes, eggs, toast, and fruit to. Then we saddled up for the trip back up.. It's a different path and I thought it was even more beautiful. The two wranglers were wonderful and helpful. At one rest stop, I sat on a big rock to eat my peanuts. People are not supposed to feed the wildlife, but some obviously do. A squirrel suddenly appeard and he ran up my leg, ran up my arm and attempted to take my peanuts. He didn't get them and then he bit me!! i also got a blister that that quickly got infected. On antibiotics for it. In the end those events ,who cares. We had so much fun!!",1401235200,,1226,4.070247933884297

I particularly like the shots taken from the point of view of the rider on the mule, it makes my feet tingle as we look over the edge of the canyon.  I needed to replace it because someone took my original DVD.  I also enjoy Wilford Brimleys narration.  He knows what hes talking about because I understand that when he was fairly young, he worked as a farrier.",1490313600,,539,4.047169811320755
