2816312,4,B000PE0EXE,"For a coming of age story this movie is hard to follow, but it's intriguing. Midget's sexual awakening is a story told over and over again I think Tan Lines does a good job of telling it like it was for many boys struggling with there sexuality. It reminds me of my teen years, I was attractive to boys and so I pursued them and I thought of myself as gay, but I also thought about girls I wasn't as sexually attracted to them but I wanted to see what it would be like having sex with them. So after being with a girl I knew I was definitely gay I had very little desire for them, but Midget in this movie doesn't seem to come to any conclusion about his sexuality witch sort of leaves you hanging. But to me it's realistic enough to get a grasp of the real world of a boys sexual awakening.",1399420800,2,791,4.044585987261146
2816313,4,B000PE0EXE,"I am really not sure what this movie is about. It starts out talking about this boy who lives in a shack (I guess) with his mother -there seems to be only one room in this whole shack and there is a bed. The boy sleeps in the bed with his mother. Through out the movie the only part of his mother that is shown is her long fingernails. She apparently sleeps all day all the time. The story never fully developes around that particular, odd issue but instead moves on with the boy hanging out with a rough bunch of surfers and skaters. He tags along with one of his friends to pick up the friend's brother who he seems to have a small crush on, but it isn't obvious.  So basically this movie revolves around this relationshp and the secrets that are revealed regarding a relationship the brother had with his highschool teacher.  I don't know what it is about this movie I like, the ending really bothered me.  Still I couldn't help but to want to watch it again and again -so I bought it. There is something gripping about it. The movie takes place in New Zealand.",1306800000,5,1064,4.2835820895522385
2816314,5,B000PE0EXE,"Watching this film on the Australia Day which is 26 January, was really a fun even for a such multi-topic viewer surprised by a number of sexually-charged pupil-involved situations covered a context profoundly confusing to much less acceptable and tolerant watchers surely.

Young teens of an Australian outback explore their willies while adults either encourage or/and ground a variety of deeds.

This work is less explicit but far much dirtier than Clark's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kids/dp/B00004YA6G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kids</a>.",1296086400,3,590,6.8533333333333335
2816315,4,B000PE0EXE,"With a taste of Larry Clark's teen angst and desperation but without the moral emptiness of Clark's ""kids"", the teens in this Aussie film do care for each other and for the most part ""do the right thing."" The surreal scenes: a geriatric drunken game of strip poker, a chorus of Christian wall images occasionally commenting on the action, a Gothic setting where the ""hero"" Midget ""works"" (too bizarre to describe and ruin it for you), all these make it interesting. That Midget is struggling (but not too much) with working out his gay desires along with a try for a girl doesn't compete with the dreariness of every day life and the hope to leave this dismal town.

If a modest goal is to make the viewer care about the people and the plot, this movie achieved that goal and more. The photography was effective with snappy cuts from one scene to another.",1233792000,4,855,4.5519480519480515
2816316,2,B000PE0EXE,"tla produces some of my favorite movies including Latter Days and Another Gay Movie, so when I saw this title I had high hopes for another fantastic movie. This, however, was not that movie.
Some have compared it to Shelter because it involves surfers but I find the movies very different. Shelter is worth watching, for example, this movie is not. Shelter actually had a beginning, a middle, and an end; this movie -didn't.
With beautiful cinematography, Tan Lines is set in a small town reachable by ferry boat. The main character, Midget shares a bed with his mother and has for the past 18 years of his life. Midget spends most of his days hanging out with his friends either getting drunk, high, or both, and surfing.
The movie is basically the story of a changing point in Midget's life and how it affects the people around him.
The acting isn't all that great and the pacing the movie is awkward and offbeat.
It's not really worth the time and effort.",1225238400,,958,4.575581395348837
2816317,4,B000PE0EXE,"very well done, the story took a left turn at the end, but was good.
excellent talent by leading actors, hope to see more of them from

2816358,2,B000PE0EXE,"Bad acting, bad editing, and the fact that apart from the bisexual lead boy, all the others look like they were drafted straight in from the Ugly Model Agency, make this a difficult film to plough through. If you're thinking 'Home and Away' or 'Neighbours' with gay characters, think again. It's more like Aussie Bizarro World.",1217548800,,327,4.857142857142857
2816359,2,B000PE0EXE,"not that impressed with the movie.
it was sort of slow pace.
can't recommend it.",1216080000,,80,4.4
2816360,5,B000PE0EXE,Its simplicity kept it honest and real.  Its quirkiness allowed it to make points and allowed us to understand the characters better - without pretense.  I quite enjoyed this and felt at times I was watching signs of the brilliance found in early John Waters flicks...,1212883200,,268,4.804347826086956
2816361,3,B000PE0EXE,"Overall, I enjoyed the movie even though it was a little slow and spacey.  The director used light/dark contrasts really well in the bedroom scenes & floods of light for outdoor scenes, as well as an interestingly subtle approach to personal religous pressures within the gay community (specifically Catholics here).  There were definately some moments that drove me up the wall with the lack of direction, dialogue, and believability between the characters.  The story at the heart of this odd movie is strong, but I feel as though it got lost somewhere, leaving the viewer to sort through all the fluff to find it.  The actors are mostly young Australians that are pretty cute, but the 'older brother' has a great body & SCARY face (think 'beer-face' commercials)!  While the end leaves mounds to be desired and more questions than answers, I think the director got the attitudes and ideas he wanted across.
  If you are into gay indie-style films, then you will most likely find this movie appealing.  IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR IMAGES OF GAY SEX AND MANHOOD SHOTS, THEN THIS MOVIE WILL NOT DELIVER; there really are only two scenes for this purpose and neither are that intense.  I think that if this movie were to be redone for 'American' audiences, the material and direction would be cleaned up and strengthened, making it a far better movie.  Just as a side note, there's a weird series of scenes in which the 'main character' is being paid by an old woman to pleasure her niece while they have tea....BIZARRE!  Basically, this film is slow and dry; if you're looking to kill time then watch this movie, otherwise don't bother because others have approached the topic in cleaner, more creative ways than this.",1206489600,3,1713,4.792517006802721
2816362,3,B000PE0EXE,this is one of the movies that at the end your thinking WTF? you can't be serious.  It was just a really odd movie but was pretty good.  For what it is it's a fantastic movie but not my style.,1202515200,,192,3.775
2816363,4,B000PE0EXE,"Midget Hallows is a bored small town teenager always looking to the horizon for something/anything better than what he has now. He lives his life from one party to the next trying desperately to put as much emotional and physical distance between himself and his mother (with whom he shares a bed) as possible.  He longs to leave his small town roots and find adventure.  One problem, he doesn't know how or where on earth he would go if he did leave, Paris in the abstract sounds good, but there are no decent waves. So he surfs and hangs out with his friends.

Cass has been gone for fours years, leaving home after particularly nasty scandal at school and the strife that caused at home.  He's been out in the world on his own making his own way, living by his own rules because he's made them up as he went along.  He comes home to for a visit.  And there the story really begins.

Cass and Midget know each other because Cass is Midget's best friends older brother.  When the meet again after all this time there is a spark between them.  Midget is just beginning to accept his own sexuality ahs Cass represent the slightly older mysterious older man.  But problem arise when Cass can't live up to the image of him Midget has in his head.

Will the two of them work past this road block?

Will midget grow up and realize that life is more than adventure and good times?

Will Cass confront his family and everything surrounding his need to leave in the first place?

All these questions are asked and to a certain extent answered.  The film is low budget, the cast is young but they all do very well in their roles.",1202169600,,1620,4.37123745819398

2816366,5,B000PE0EXE,"This movie is a wonderful surprise---a small gem, really. The photograph on the DVD and the title are actually misleading. The actor on the cover is not the lead, though he is good.

The standout performance in TAN LINES is the by the actor playing the main character.  Jack Baxter is absolutely sensational as a smart and mouthy youth coming of age.  He is attracted to other boys but also lets himself be distracted by females.

The Australian director of this movie has done a gorgeous job of creating a totally believable world of young slacker/surfers.  This screenplay for TAN LINES is smart, funny, sexy, interesting and compelling.

Bravo to all involved, especially Jack Baxter!",1190764800,15,687,4.930434782608696
2816367,5,B000PE0EXE,"I love this because it makes no sense, the characters are selfish, random, realistic and unfamiliar. When you watch it, it may be nothing like your life but it's so ""truth stranger than fiction"" true you can't help but enjoy it. There is something sweet and tender buried under the weirdness, love mixed with real life and real boys, on an acid trip!",1189900800,2,350,4.571428571428571
2816378,5,B000PE0EXE,"Perhaps the greatest thing regarding this video is its characters who are your typical hot-boddies at the beach, etc. The storyline was interesting, yet could have been refined. The cinematography is a little on the low-budget side, yet fine enough to dispaly nice visuals, etc.",1188518400,2,278,5.2
2816379,4,B000PE0EXE,This movie is a bit difficult to follow in parts but I found it worthwhile sticking with it to the end.,1188345600,2,103,3.9523809523809526
2816380,4,B000PE0EXE,"Even after having read a few reviews on this movie.  I still wasn't quite sure whether i should take the plunge and purchase it.  I did and i will say that while it wasn't the best gay themed movie i've seen.  It is still pretty good in its own rights.  With the lead character falling for his best friends brother Cass.  Who's just come back into after being away for four years.  You find out why later on in the film and it made me understand a bit better why dude bolted the way he did.  His parents are a mess and i couldn't help but feel for not only Cass but his younger brothers that still has to live with them as well.

The lead guy has some issues of his own...sleeping in the same bed with your mom, might be cool when your 3 or 4.  But he's 16/17 years old thats all kinds of creepy to me.  But he likes Cass a lot and they have their thing going on.  But he has this little side job that he describes as ""gardening"", i'll leave it at that and you'll find out exactly what's really going on with that job of his.  Plus their is a girl interest in the movie as well whom the lead guy rebuffs time after time..but then suddenly changes his mind on getting with her.  Don't quite understand that myself but again i don't want to give everything about the movie away.  But for the most part the story centers around him, Cass, his younger bro, a couple friends and the professor at the school Cass went to.

Thats a whole different thing in of itself but also fits into why Cass rolled out of town in a hurry.  I can't even lie after seeing this movie.  Also check out the ending as well that offers a nice little surprise and twist that i didn't see coming.

I know that i made the right choice picking this one up...don't let them fool you.  Tan Lines has more to offer than even i thought..be on the lookout and at the very least give it a rent to see.  If its the movie that you want to put your hard earned cash on.

Either way, hope you enjoy the movie and that the review helped you make a choice one way or the other.  Thanks.",1188000000,7,2043,4.055

2816382,1,B000PE0EXE,"It would be difficult to imagine a worse plot, crummier script, sloppier direction or more lack-lustre acting (but I don't blame the actors).

Tan Lines pushes the envelope only in terms of what a viewer is willing to put up with in an effort to support queer cinema.

There's some very careless film-work e.g. with the reflection of camera crew in clear view in one indoor night shot.

No budget is so small that it would excuse what we see here as the final edit.

The technical quality of the DVD is particularly low - but I'm guessing it is as good as it would ever get.

The storyline is pure farce mixed with a liberal dash of the absurd. The intention is supposedly to tell a gay teen surfer's coming of age story, but the characters are simply not believable - and they're all terminally morose. This film has far too much teen angst and far too little heart.

Only ""Crazy Richard"" gives ""Tan Lines"" a run for its money as the all time worst Australian film.",1186704000,24,966,4.398876404494382
2816383,1,B000PE0EXE,"Poor production values, bad acting, very disjointed, lousy dialogue.  Looks like a child filmed it.  It is advertised as a romance, but there is very little romance here.

2816384,4,B000PE0EXE,"This is a much better movie than the other, more casual reviews suggest.
Compare this movie to American graffiti, a tale about the last night of high school, and the kids who might grow up and leave town.
Midget is a young man wanting to grow up. People seem to have trouble growing up and leaving their idyllic seaside surfer village.  ""Where else would you find the waves""?
Midget admires Cass, who has returned briefly after a mysterious absence, and hopes that by becoming Cass' lover, he and Cass might leave together.  When Cass disappoints Midget, the latter tries alternatives.
The results are unexpected and romantically satisfying.  Midget's encounters with a young woman are surreal and surprising, to say the least. Gayness seems natural and honest in this world, and nothing either to fuss over and extol, or to fear.
Of course, nobody seems to need to earn a living in this world, so people can focus on how they feel, and how they look.
I say 4 stars not 5 because there has to be some room for films like Memento and Road Warrior to merit 5.  This is a perfect gem, a sapphire if not a diamond.",1185667200,5,1110,4.562814070351759

2816386,5,B000PE0EXE,"Disregard the other poor reviews of this film.  Such reviews are like having a redneck critique Rembrandt.  This film has a beautiful, breazy look and feel about it.  The camera draws you in to a lifelike and gorgeous rambling vacation or holiday that leaves you sad, let fulfilled.  This is an art house film.  It is subtle, yet bold.  Daring in its camera work and sublime in its portrayal of the actors.  With this film, you can be transported into what seems like a lifelike journey with the actors as they experience life on this most beautiful of journeys.  This is not a skin flick, THANKFULLY!
