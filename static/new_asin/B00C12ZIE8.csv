5683653,5,B00C12ZIE8,A+ documentary. Exactly how I wanted to spend my evening. I especially liked the detailed explanation of the 4 different snake styles one of the masters teaches. And I've got the hunger for some Hung Gar. (Sorry for the terrible pun),1381968000,2,233,4.7073170731707314
5683654,4,B00C12ZIE8,"I loved this documentary. I wish it could have been a bit longer & more in depth. Overall, I enjoyed this. My only complaint is that it didn't include the late great Jim Kelly. How can you talk about Black people in kung fu & NOT include him or Carl Scott, Taimak, & Peter Cunningham?",1378166400,3,284,4.181818181818182
5683655,3,B00C12ZIE8,"I was happy to see the Black Kung Fu experience because it showed how African American's have been influenced by Asian Martial Arts.  I did also enjoy the background information on Ron Van Clief  because I never really followed him as much as I did Bruce Lee and Jim Kelly.  I was impressed that he was a Marine and was moved by his challenges he faced with racism, especially since I am a Marine myself.  I do have a new respect for him now since he paved the way for me.  One person they never covered was Carl Scott because I grew up watching his movies and he teamed with another Asian actor to get the bad guys.  He really represented the brothers on the cinema back them with his Martial Arts Skills and I always cheered him on and I am quiet sure he has influenced other African American Martial Artist as well.",1418342400,,818,4.279220779220779
5683656,4,B00C12ZIE8,"Good DVD presenting a excellent view of the Black aka African American  experience since the 1960 to the late 1980s. There are a few issues which I can relate to 1. Master Ron Van Clief in the military is or was common for most men of a dark color. I experienced up front and personal. I however studied the MA prior to me entering into the Navy which was still  highly prejudice in the upper ranks in the 1980's. I also, can related to Master Dennis Brown in that my start in the MA started in a similar fashion. My only negative issue is that there were so many other martial artists who were African American that left their mark on the African American society little known Martial artist Carl Scott, whom made movies beside Bruce Li and Billy Chong within the same time line. Although this master showed his ""thing"" in the mid to late 1980- He was moving up in the 1970's i.e. Billy Blanks.",1412121600,,895,4.3532934131736525

5683660,4,B00C12ZIE8,This shed a lot of light on a subject that has gotten little or no acknowledgement outside of the Martial Arts world and those who are ardent fans. The Hidden Secret (of sorts),1406160000,,176,4.363636363636363
5683661,3,B00C12ZIE8,"Great documentary but doesn't talk about the history as far as all the pioneers of the Genre, I loved the piece but it just wasn't a complete and inclusive history.",1399852800,,164,4.5
5683662,5,B00C12ZIE8,"This was an unexpected pleasure; I wasn't looking for it but when I got into, I was mersmized and satisfied.",1398211200,,108,4.45
5683663,5,B00C12ZIE8,Excellent tribute to the African American legends of Kung Fu. I grow up as an admirer of Chinese Kung Fu movies and became a huge Bruce Lee fan. I am now humbled and honored to train with Grand Master Dennis Brown. Thanks for making this great documentary available for others to learn and appreciate the positive impact that these Kung Fu legends have had in their communities and across the globe. Well done!!,1398038400,,411,4.6438356164383565
5683664,5,B00C12ZIE8,I wasn't sure what I was getting when I ordered it but Dennis Brown is a local legend around Washington D.C. so I got it and was pleasantly surprised. It is a PBS run documentary and very well made and I learned as much about American history and culture as I did China and the martial arts.,1397260800,,291,4.12280701754386
5683665,5,B00C12ZIE8,They don't make tough guys like these anymore. I always appreciate artists who are consumed with passion for their art form,1397088000,,123,4.904761904761905
5683666,3,B00C12ZIE8,It was inspiring to see African American men becoming masters of martial arts. It just made me angry to no end how the racism of the United States caused some to go out of the country to learn these arts and master them. Many did not get the credit they deserved and some did make it in the movies like Ron Van Clief. It was eye opening and informative.,1393200000,,353,4.130434782608695
5683667,5,B00C12ZIE8,"...There, I said it.
This was a nice documentary to see. As said by previous reviewers, there are other Martial Artists that were not included, and it stinks that Jim Kelly passed away in 2013. The persons interviewed here have backstories you can relate to.",1391731200,,258,4.7555555555555555
5683668,5,B00C12ZIE8,"Very interesting andinspiring at the same time, i did not know there was a black kung fu history, thank you",1390867200,,107,4.4
5683669,5,B00C12ZIE8,"It looks like The Black Kungfu Experience was a very positive one.  As one of the masters says, that's a natural thing.  How can something that teaches you discipline and patience and concentration not wind up being something positive?

It was for these masters.  Some of them grew up in especially tough times.  Brutally attacked by a gang of racists that sent him to a hospital for months, in retaliation merely for refusing to sit at the back of the bus, one master (Ron van Clief?) in the marine corps recovered only to be sent on suicide missions by his ""cracker"" officers in Vietnam, who told them that if they couldn't get him here, the ""gooks"" would get him out there.  It took him decades, he says, to get out of survival mode enough to be able to sleep well.  Yet now he has the kind of easy smile and humility, and positive attitude, we'd all wish on ourselves when we get to his grey-crowned years.

There is lots of recounting of going to Chinatown movie theaters back in the 70's to catch the kung fu movies back when nobody had even heard of kung fu or had any idea what it might be.  I'm old enough to remember those years and the incredible thrill of going into those theaters as one of the only non-Chinese there to see people move the way I might not even have been able to imagine people moving before, in villages and costumes and with weapons my whole world had no idea of.  The laughing and flirting and hooting turning the place upside down while the actors talked, only to be suddenly hushed, not one tiniest noise, when the first loud stinging slap on screen began the wrong that must be righted, the injustice that would be redeemed.  With the tiger claw, the toad punch (what?), the dragon whipping his tail.  It was amazing, enchanting, and it launched millions of dreams.

This movie shows how some of those dreams played out into happiness, personal and community achievement, and success despite the immense cultural differences that had to be conquered.  In so doing, it celebrates the determination to follow even the most unusual dreams and make them real and beautiful, and reminds how long good things and good spirit can be made to grow and last.",1389916800,4,2184,4.552429667519181
5683670,4,B00C12ZIE8,"As a martial artist I enjoyed this documentary style video.  It was a little old but described the journeys of each of the masters.  If you are a martial artist, not necessarily a must see, but you would probably enjoy it.",1388966400,,222,4.390243902439025
5683671,5,B00C12ZIE8,"This film gives a great synopsis of a few of the many great African-American martial artists. It touches on the individuals, their backgrounds, styles and how they have applied martial arts in their daily lives. A must see film for anyone that is interested in martial arts, especially African-Americans.",1388534400,,304,5.224489795918367
5683672,5,B00C12ZIE8,"The Black Kung Fu Experience is a must see movie for all aspiring martial artist and people who want to learn more about the African American experience. But for me this film or more of these films should have been made by now, I'm very happy that now this kind of exposer is being directed towards African Americans. Nicely done and I hope to see more of these documentaries.

Thank you to all the masters that helped on this project!!!",1386720000,,437,4.4625
5683673,4,B00C12ZIE8,"I enjoyed this documentary about the Black KungFu Experience in America. These Martial Artist have accomplished a lot in their lifetime, becoming movie stars and Martial Art Grand Masters plus owning their own schools. The filming is great; some of the film is dated material from the early 70s, but a part of our American history, great information. I learned a lot about these men that I did not know. This DVD was a great purchase for me.",1384819200,3,441,4.666666666666667
5683674,4,B00C12ZIE8,"It was initially a multiple volume project that was limited to one film for budget reasons and the makers went with the strongest choices in a myriad of martial artists. Ron, Dennis, and Casell are what the film says they are. They are real artists who paid their dues during the grindhouse years when kung fu was in its infancy in America. Good People. I am at a comfort to see they have the mantle as torchbearers and they deserve it.",1383264000,4,436,4.395061728395062

8576121,5,B00C12ZIE8,A great insight on African Ameican martial arts and a wonderful education on folks who are often overlooked. (Yes there were others besides Jim Kelly.),1428364800,,151,5.08
8576122,5,B00C12ZIE8,excellent,1425168000,,9,9.0
8576123,5,B00C12ZIE8,"Wonderful look at how four African Americans used their love of the Chinese Martial Arts to develop and advance their lives. Of note is that I remember Tayari Casel as a fantastic sparring champion who used rarely seen groundfighting techniques as well as superb timing to battle the seemingly invinceable L'il John Davis in Madison Square Garden's old Felt Forum way back in 1974. Casel represented the Chinese Systems at the time but has since gone on to do something he claims as entirely African in origin although how he got to it is never explained. Ron Van Clief is, as far as my knowledge, the only New York based fighter to have competed in the old style bareknuckle Karate tournaments, Professional Full contact Karate matches in the US as well as in Europe and Taiwan, and then finally the UFC against the amazing Royce Gracie. He made up his own system but backed it up by fighting anyone who challenged his ways-and won! Dennis Brown's story is however most important. What he is able to pass on through teaching the Kung Fu he learned from Willy Lin is invaluable to the inner city kids who are his students. Sifu Brown is truly an amazing man who is really helping everyday folks through the teaching of the martial arts. The BKFE is a must for anyone involved in the martial arts!",1425168000,,1296,4.6147186147186146
