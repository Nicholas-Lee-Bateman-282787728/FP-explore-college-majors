8470513,5,B005FQH7MI,"This is a 2004 film from actress and director Paprika Steen originally released as `Lad de sm brn'. It stars two of the now much respected stars of Danish TV from `The Killing', that being Sofie Grabol and Mikael Birkkjaer who play husband and wife Britt and Claes Lehman. They have just lost their only child, a daughter, in a car accident. She was killed by an estate agent who was more fond of the bottle than road safety. The couple can not come to terms with the loss and it inevitably puts pressure on them and their friends who can do nothing to stop the downward spiral that grief has taken these two, erstwhile happy people on.

Britt works for Social services with problem parents and soon she finds herself starting to take her work home, and I don't mean the paperwork. Meanwhile Claes starts to find the triviality of being an architect just too much to bear. He is also fixated with the woman who killed his daughter and decides he has to do something to exact revenge. What follows is a harrowing and often difficult watch, it is however remarkable in being able to pull you in despite the subject matter.

I really liked this film, one would be hard pushed to say `enjoyed' as it was so difficult to view at times. The performances were all brilliant, even the bit players were all up to par and beyond in most cases. It is a testament to the director that she managed to get such good performances from all concerned, it is a shame she has only directed two films, but then she is a ruddy good actress in her own right, check her out in `Keep the lights on' from 2012. In Danish and English with very good subtitles, this is one for lovers of the Nordic Noir and those who like a challenging and very rewarding film indeed.",1370044800,4,1740,4.38390092879257

Sofie and Mikael play social worker Britt and architect Claes, a married couple in their 30's who have recently lost their 12 year old daughter, their only child. This moving film shows the downward spiral in which they find themselves.
Copenhagen is the setting once again for this story filmed five years before Sofie and Mikael would work on The Killing 2. There are many moving scenes of guilt, angst, betrayal, deceit and loneliness as the couple's difficulties with friends, work, and with each other are explored.
Some of my favourite scenes involve Claes with the Japanese, Claes being flirted with at the estate agents, Britt and her helping hand duties among others.
Apart from one character, Vivi (Lena Endre seen in the Wallander series and Millenium series) who speaks in Swedish, and a short scene involving Claes taking the mick out of some clients (in English), the film is in Danish with English subtitles.
Particularly impressive is Laura Christensen (Kandidaten) who plays struggling mother Malene who is not really supported very well by her boyfriend Ulrik (played by Carsten Bjrnlund - Major Christian Sgaard - The Killing 2). Look out for a very brief appearance by Stine Prtorius (Louise Raben - The Killing 2) working in Claes's office. One of Denmark's finest actors, Lars Brygmann (Labour minister Troels Hxenhaven - Borgen / DI Thomas la Cour - Unit One), appears as Britt's boss.
Since watching The Killing - Series 1 back in January 2011 on BBC4, I have seen a quite a few Danish films. I've yet to be disappointed!
Birkkjr also appears in BBC4's political offering Borgen.
Enjoy!

The BBFC have classified this film as an 18 and their Consumer Advice statement for it explains that it is because it ""Contains strong sexual violence, sex references and racist language"".

Two other films I recommend for fans of Sofie and Mikael are Sofie's first ever film from 1986 The Wolf at the Door and a 2005 film with Mikael in the lead role Springet. Worth a watch!",1357516800,4,2175,4.859838274932614
