7877785,3,6304811810,"The documentary itself is fine. However Jaglom's work (with the exception of one film ""Last Summer in the Hamptons""), remains problematic for me at best. And this film, which attempts to show both the good and bad of both the man and his work, only succeeds in showing his ""process"" for what it is- a combination of passive aggressive and aggressive aggressive bullying that forces the poor actors/actresses into babbling messes and results in the mostly rambling incoherent ""oeuvre"" of Jaglom the ""auteur."" I think it's great he bullied Candace Bergen into writing her autobiography ""Knock Wood"" and Andrea Marcovicci into her cabaret career but otherwise I'll await the documentary ""Why is Henry Jaglom?""",1428883200,2,706,5.201754385964913
7877786,5,6304811810,"Really terrific profile of the unusual and acerbic writer-director-actor-character, with contributions from both lovers and haters -- unusual for this kind of documentary, the nay-sayers get to say their nays. Jaglom comes across as articulate, difficult, funny, entertaining, shifty and possibly a genius or maybe talentless. It's hard to say, but fascinating to watch.

It's not often one can recommend a film documentary to those who dislike as well as those who like a filmmaker, but this one seems to offer plenty for both camps.",1420934400,,534,5.2823529411764705
7877787,1,6304811810,I can't waste my time on an ego driven movie such as this. Members of the cast kept patting themselves on the back because they felt so innovative. All they had was a group of no-talent wanna bes. I watched less than ten minutes at the beginning and skipped forward four or five times looking for some redeeming part. Nothing appealed to me at all. It's a big waste of time.,1408665600,2,374,4.28169014084507
7877788,5,6304811810,"Henry Jaglom is a true original. Beyond his own wonderful films, this documentary is the clearest glimpse you're likely to get of the inner workings of his fantastic mind. For fans of independent cinema, this DVD is well worth seeking out.",1404259200,2,239,4.853658536585366
7877789,3,6304811810,"Somehow, the word ""buttmunch"" always comes to mind when I'm horrified by the existence of Jaglom and the idea that he continues to make movies. That there is a movie *about* him is more horrifying. He is ""Ed Wood"" without the unselfconsciousness of his own incompetence. But mercifully this film about him is secretly snide and condescending.

""Hailed by some as a cinematic genius, a feminist voice and a true maverick of American cinema, dismissed by others as a voyeuristic, egomaniacal fraud and the wold's [sic] worst director...""

Put me firmly in the ""voyeuristic, egomaniacal fraud and the world's worst director"" column. Orson Welles was clearly only friends with him because he smelled money (Jaglom never ceases to tell you he comes for a wealthy family).

Jaglom hanger-oners speak about him as he ""obsessively confuses and abuses the line between life and art"" but I have a better description. Jaglom is a self-obsessed nonentity that can't stop masturbating in public. Heideggerian onanistic solipsism.

Some of my favorite comments from other critics: ""Critic Michael Medved imitates a common reaction to Jaglom films, ""Oh I hate them...I'd rather be held prisoner in Beirut for three years by Hezbollah than watch another Jaglom film!"" The late director Louis Malle adds dryly, ""He improvises almost completely. But excuse me, it shows."" ""

Three stars because it secretly is critical of Jaglom, and the locations are pretty cool sometimes, and Candice Bergen is just so darn lovely.",1225929600,3,1499,5.177685950413223
7877790,4,6304811810,"It's been a few years since I've seen this -- I even saw a little of it being shot.  I enjoyed it quite a lot, but I am familiar with Jaglom's body of work without being a fan.  (I'm a bit more objective than the people who love to despise him.)

I particularly enjoyed the scenes from the location shoot for Last Summer in the Hamptons, with some especially revered actors (Viveca Lindfors, Ron Rifkin, Andre Gregory, Roscoe Lee Brown) working with a director famed for the performances in his films.  The most quoted line from the film is Candice Bergen's epigram, ""If I'd had Henry as a husband or a father, I could have taken Poland.""

All by way of saying that this intelligent and witty documentary about one of THE MOST independent filmmakers working in the U.S. may have a somewhat limited audience.  It helps to be at least interested in Jaglom (or perhaps Orson Welles' relationship with Jaglom), but his fans may take a dim view of the rather acerbic tone adopted by the filmmakers.  I have heard (but do not agree with) the phrase ""hatchet job"" from a couple of them.",1207526400,7,1079,4.5025641025641026
7877791,1,6304811810,"The French auteur theory aligns the film director with his film. Although not allowing for workmanlike directors who are able to genre jump, the theory maintains that each product has an imposed and recognisably singular vision. As an independent film maker who produces cinema verite style work, Henry Jaglom is described in this doco by Alex Rubin and Jeremy Workman as individual as Godard or John Cassavetes, however their portrait of Jaglom focuses more on the man than his films. Since Rubin and Workman show behind the scenes footage of Jaglom berating his actors, we assume that Jaglom hasn't imposed any restriction on them. If he lets himself be seen like this ... However there is little of Jaglom's film work here. We get Jaglom's home movies, TV interviews, and comments about him by various actors and critics, with more negative than positive input. There is the sense that the makers of the doco assume an audience's knowledge of Jaglom, which gives the title an exasperated clinical tone, from the lack of depth given to his oeuvre, and from the inclusion of negative comments, since how can you appreciate an insult about something you are ignorant of? The footage of Jaglom in tantrum is shown to counter Jaglom's claim of unscripted improvisation as the ultimate freedom for the actor, which he rationalises by stating that it is a technique to help the actor deliver a performance. However it's clear that Rubin and Workman don't buy this defence otherwise they would present the takes that resulted, as evidence. Clearly they are out to do a hatchet job, from the opening credits featuring a steadicam wearing a Jaglom signature hat, Jaglom's taping conversations with Orson Welles without his approval (which Jaglom denies), and his willingness to help up and comer's as being motivationally suspicious. Occasionally the negativity is funny - with his brother Michael Emil revealing a sibling rivalry, and Andrea Marcovicci doing an impression of Jaglom's sociopathic form of concerned questioning. However Candice Bergen's comment that ""if she had Henry as her father or husband she could have taken Poland"" is evidence of his sustained motivation, which comes across in spite of the supposed resistance of his actors, some of whom have given him their best screen work. It's fun to see Henry on TV's Gidget as a beatnic, and one laughs at how Bob Rafelson dismisses Jaglom when he was at the Actors Studio. As an admirer of Jaglom, I was disatisfied with this coverage. It seems aimed to drive a viewer away from his films, rather than want to explore them, which left me sad. The French auteurs may be right about the singular vision of a director, but I don't think that should also include his personal behaviour. I may not want to be Henry Jaglom's friend, but that doesn't mean his work is not worth a look.",988848000,5,2837,4.9125
