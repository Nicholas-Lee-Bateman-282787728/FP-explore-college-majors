2322822,4,B0009UZGCI,"OK, OK, I confess to being a fan of all things Caan (James, Scott), but this little movie is something special. I rented it to ogle Scott Caan, but ended up buying my own copy because I couldn't get the story out of my head.

Caan wrote, directed and starred in this film, which received kudos at one of those high-tone film festivals (can't remember which). It's a poignant story of two men-children at a turning point in their lives, where they could either go on fighting and drinking every night or make something of themselves. With a little guidance, Rusty (Shawn Hatosy, excellent!) finally moves past the death of his rodeo star father. Dallas (Caan), however, is a party animal 'til the end. Although his life is an object lesson for how not to behave, Caan makes the character sympathetic and likeable.

The black and white still photos in the beginning are beautiful, and Scott looks so much like his father in some of them, it's un-Caany (!). Nice addition to anyone's indie film collection.",1168300800,10,1003,4.693181818181818
2322823,4,B0009UZGCI,"This very small comedy/tragedy/slice of life was tossed into cable rotation... after noticing that, without thinking, I had flipped it on to run again for the THIRD TIME, it occurred to me that I must really like it! Huh. Snuck up on me.

Gotta hand it to first-timer Scott Caan: not only does he do a good acting job here, but he has written this story in such a way that, although there are no big action scenes (keeping the budget tight) the excellent dialogue is punctuated with enough events (usually both violent and funny) that the movie flows nicely from front to back. Rates comparison to the much-bigger-budget ""Good Will Hunting"".

Shawn Hatosy is as strong as ever in the lead, and for the first time in a long time, I really enjoyed Jeff Goldblum here. A suprisingly good little flick.",1156291200,8,798,4.612676056338028
2322824,5,B0009UZGCI,"I saw this film for the first time at the Toronto Film Festival...and have watched it several times since then. It is a fabulous movie! It is loud and edgy, but also very moving and even funny. Scott Caan has done a wonderful job as writer/ director. Everyone in the cast (what a cast!) delivers very memorable performances. I highly recommend this film!",1125705600,2,354,4.634920634920635

8067020,4,B0009UZGCI,"[Rounded up from 3-1/2 stars] Although written, directed, and starring Scott Caan (James Caan's son), make no mistake, this is Shawn Hatosy's movie, in terms of the centerpiece performance.  Hatosy (probably best known for TV's ""Southland"") is one of today's most underrated actors and shows surprising range here as ""Rusty,"" whose father died doing what he loved--being a rodeo cowboy--when Rusty was just a teen (but not before Rusty also got the rodeo in his blood), making his mama ""Mary"" (played by the perfectly cast Kelly Lynch, though that bedroom scene was a little awkward and out of place) want to, of course, protect him by then moving as far away from rodeo life as possible, hoping Rusty won't suffer the same fate.  But, after the move, fatherless Rusty is befriended by ""Dallas"" (Caan), who may be leading Rusty down a dangerous path of his own.  Freddie Rodriguez, as ""Ruben the Roofer"" (another bad influence with a catchy nickname), is also an asset to the cast and steals every scene he's in; too bad he's only in the last 20 minutes of the film.  Selma Blair's character doesn't have much to do and isn't integral to the plot (unless you count yelling and pot-smoking as integral), but the always dependable Jeff Goldblum picks up her slack as Mary's boyfriend, who, oh yeah, also happens to be Rusty's shrink!  Of course, Mary just wants the best for her son, her only child.  Is Rusty's yearning for the rodeo life too much to let go?  And how will best buddy Dallas figure into the picture?  Caan has created a worthy, believable, and touching portrait, almost lost in the Hollywood shuffle, interwoven with the loyalty of friendships and family.",1403222400,,1670,4.814685314685315
8067021,4,B0009UZGCI,"I like this movie a lot. It's pretty funny at parts, and the characters are, for the most part, believable and deeper than they try to let on. This is one of those rare movies that usually only film buffs can appreciate because it doesn't have some grand, flashy story. It's pretty basic, but Shawn Hatosy and Scott Caan are great at playing roles that require them to show that there's actually more in their heads than they convey. Wish Isla Fischer has a larger role, but I really like this movie. I refuse to give away any parts of the movie. It's cheap, just spend the money. I just wish they had this on blu ray. But I wish they had many films on blu ray that they still haven't converted yet. Worth checking out. If you don't like it, I'll buy it from you and give it to my friends who like it as well.",1386806400,,809,4.159235668789809
8067022,5,B0009UZGCI,"I LOVE this movie, one of my all time favorites. my wife hated it, so i know it's not for everyone. I love the cheaters and the story is a truly great one.",1385424000,,155,3.727272727272727
8067023,3,B0009UZGCI,I am a huge Scott Caan fan but this movie leasves something to be desired. Although I thought Jeff Goldblum was great.,1359763200,,118,4.409090909090909
8067024,5,B0009UZGCI,"There's nothing quite like something written and starred in by Scott Caan, I've come to discover. And directed by too, in this case.

I started out seeing ""Mercy"" - a must-see if you want to dive into the type of human condition/relationship exploration I am discovering Caan excels at.

I thought, okay, ""Mercy"" sucker-punched me when I least expected it. Haunted me for days afterward, so what else is in Caan's magic bag of tricks for me to check out? Enter ""Dallas 362.""

Never really the type to watch this sort of movie, to be brutally honest, I bought it...mulled over the DVD case...thought, well, really, am I going to watch this? It doesn't seem like my thing.

I am SO glad I did.

Not sure how he does it, but Caan creates this character you should be rolling your eyes at, calling him a misdirected bad boy, wishing he'd just get lost and leave poor Rusty alone...takes this Dallas guy and makes him someone you care about enough for Caan to deliver yet another sucker-punch. He's good at that.

So now I know. If I watch something Scott Caan has written, and especially if he also stars in it, I've got to wear armor. Because after two of these expertly written, touchingly acted and in this case, artfully directed Caan movies, I'm hooked on whatever else he does for life.

Definitely buy this movie. Jack up the volume and watch it suck you in and make you care.",1310601600,,1379,4.514056224899599
8067025,4,B0009UZGCI,"Great pictures, great cinematography, great stills, and a great soundtrack!
I was very impressed by this Scott Caan movie.  Not happy that there is no soundtrack to the movie as I would buy it if there was.
Good story line about two kids/friends becoming men and the path they choose to take.",1296950400,,292,4.615384615384615
