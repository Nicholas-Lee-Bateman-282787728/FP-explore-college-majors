8192831,5,B000PNECNI,I love Good Eats. These dvds are great and bonus q&a with Alton,1508371200,,63,3.923076923076923
8192832,5,B000PNECNI,"Once again Alton Brown delivers three outstanding episodes of ""Good Eats"" in ""Waves of Grains,"" this time covering grains both common and obscure. As a dedicated fan of grits, ""True Grits"" was my favorite of the three episodes, while ""Gotten Grains III"" covers another of my more obscure favorites, wheat berries. The third episode, ""Power to the Pilaf,"" is single-mindedly devoted to pilaf, and provides more information on the subject than you ever thought could be interesting.

There is a small cookbook enclosed covering key dishes from each episode, with my favorites here being ""Cheese Grits,"" ""Pineapple Upside-Down Cornmeal Cake,"" and ""Basic Cooked Wheat Berries."" I have not yet tried ""Cherry Couscous Pudding,"" but the presentation is very intriguing, and it's well worth a look even if you decide not to make it.

All told, this is a great collection about the staples of our diet, grains, and the ""Ask Alton,"" bonus footage clarifies many (often more technical) questions that true fans of the show may have.",1421107200,,1021,5.107784431137724
8192833,5,B000PNECNI,"In this compilation, ""Loafing Around,"" Alton Brown takes on bread and sandwich craft as only he could. There are three episodes featured here, and the DVD comes with a small recipe book of the significant items covered in these episodes (""Sandwich Craft,"" ""My Big Fat Greet Sandwich,"" and ""Dr. Strangeloaf."") I particularly recommend his take on the Cuban sandwich and if you are interested in baking bread his ""Very Basic Bread"" recipe. While I like gyros, I haven't succumbed personally to the temptation to make his ""Gyro Meat with Tzatziki Sauce,"" though I thought the episode it came from was one of the most entertaining and informative. I like the bonus ""Ask Alton"" question and answer sessions on the DVD and genuinely find ""Good Eats"" to be the most educational cooking show I have ever seen. If you like to cook, if you like science, or if you just have a quirky sense of humor, you can't go wrong with any ""Good Eats"" collection.",1420329600,,940,4.737804878048781
8192834,5,B000PNECNI,"I bought this as a birthday gift for my husband.  He is a big ""Good Eats"" fan.  Hope to buy more.  Thanks.",1374105600,,106,3.727272727272727
