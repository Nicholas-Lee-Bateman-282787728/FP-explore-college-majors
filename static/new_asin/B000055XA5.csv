This specific episodes in this one though, are very...

Well, how should I put this... Awesome!

Episode 7 - The Night Before the Carnival

-Ayeka and Ryouko find Sasami and Mihoshi reading these love-mangas in the morning. They ask what they're doing, and are told comics to get someone's love. Well, Ryouko and Ayeka fall into that, and start reading up on Nobuyuki's books. Very comical, and funny, as they try and gain Tenchi's love through teachings of a manga.

Episode 8 - Hello Baby

-When Sasami comes home from Tenchi's aunt's house, she seems a little strange, in her way of acting. Well, before Tenchi's aunt left, he yelled out to bring the baby next time, which Sasami was visiting for. Heh... Well... He got his wish. Now, the girls and Tenchi have to take care of Taro, the baby. Another, very comical episode. Later on, Washuu is left with the baby, as the other girls sleep. Very good episode of Washuu, as well as the other girls.

Episode 9 - Sasami and Tsunami

-As Tenchi and his new family come back to the spa house, instead of having to relax and kick back, they have to fix up the place! Well, while they're fixing it up, a couple of them see a ghost, which Yousho tells about, the White Ghost. When they see Sasami, her reflection is that of a different person! She runs off so as to not be confronted. She's found, and she reveals a horrible part of her. It's a little sad actually.

Eh, yeah. Very vague short summaries, but I hope it encourages you to buy it. Or, the DVDs.",1136592000,,1535,4.434163701067615
