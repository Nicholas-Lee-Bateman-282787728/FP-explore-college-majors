5003675,5,B006LQY3KU,Xavier Dolan has the making of a very artistic and sensative director/director...a modern day Bergman? And besides he's so cute.,1380412800,,128,5.45
5003676,4,B006LQY3KU,"I had been wanting to see this semi-autobiographical film for 2 years (since it was never distributed nationally in the U.S.)  I really enjoyed his second film (""Heartbeats"") and was curious to see the one that proceeded it.

I enjoyed the plot and the acting is very good.  If you like foreign films (this is made in Quebecois with English subtitles) you will probably enjoy it.  Dolan's character is a bit of a brat and is a little over-bearing.  It can be really distracting at times... that's the main reason I didn't give it 5 stars, but YMMV.

I recommend it, as well as his second feature, ""Hearbeats.""",1378252800,,609,4.592592592592593
5003677,5,B006LQY3KU,"Wow, what a powerful film, a bombardment of strong emotions and frustrations.
I cried, felt sadness and emptyness and though I absolutey adore Xavier Dolan with every inch of my body and soul, he was an unlikeable brat in this one, but relateable at the same time.
Superbly acted, beautifully edited (the painting/love scene!!) and excellently scored, this is a movie for filmlovers and not just gay ones at that.",1367452800,3,413,4.914285714285715
5003678,4,B006LQY3KU,"This is my review published on 19 August 2011 in IMDB:

A reviewer was a bit mislead with a product description telling about ""mother-son strangled relationship"". Why? Because such an affair is sadly very common between modern teens and their ""predecessors"" for, additionally, the modern feature-computing advanced abilities to deploy innovated gadgets the younger generations are usually better with to access volumes of information both personal and for job performing surely.

The story is trivial one. Separated couple's 16 y.o. offspring residues with a busy mother enjoying her free time in a company of the emancipated alike-one in modern French Canada, where sex is on a shelf as much as any other of produces demanded by a public. Whatever young male adult offers and suggests had been met with a superior ignorance demonstrated steadily towards ""kid's blabbing"" by an older, wiser and experienced parent. And willingness simply to highlight own sovereign place of OLDer is resulted in doing everything opposite to the son offering. A very traditional inter-generation situation except a young male happened being same gender attracted, establishing a relationship with a classmate.

I did not get a title properly because hatred towards mother is the regrettable ungrounded feeling of a young 20+y.o. man-""like-others"" this DVD purchase aimed mother of him for, but I changed a mind to present after watching it.",1325980800,4,1422,5.367713004484305

5003680,4,B006LQY3KU,"A son yells at his mother in anger, ""what would you do if I died today?!"" The answer, is what embedded this movie into my memory.

It was movie night, and it was my significant other's choice of movie. I thought, ""Here we go, some international art house film will be selected."" Maybe it was my lower expectations, maybe I just wasn't sure what to expect, but in the end I appreciated this movie.

It's a semi-autobiographical movie starring, written, and directed by Xavier Dolan. It helps that Xavier is eye candy. And because it's his story he sells it a lot better than another actor might have. The actress who plays his mom has excellent chemistry with Xavier, and the tension between them feels real. (She also goes on to be in his other movies). The interactions between the two are the heart of this movie.

Xavier Dolan has some directorial talents. He's getting better and better with each movie I've seen of his. He's now currently in talks to possibly direct Adele in her first feature film. I look forward to seeing more from him.

If you want some moody, international drama, try out this movie. Recommended.",1447977600,,1123,4.628140703517588
5003681,1,B006LQY3KU,"Don't  waste your  time,  unless  you like watching  people deliberately being miserable.  There  is no apparent  motivation  for this  brat  to hate  his  mother  so much.  His  worst  criticism  of  her was  that  she was  ""too  permissive.""  WTF?  If she brought this on, we have no way of knowing how.  Similarly, his  relationship  with his boyfriend appears to self destruct  for no apparent  reason  (except  that  he calls him after being injured and is called ""selfish"").  I  had a similar  reaction  to Heartbeats. Boring and  pointless.  As  noted in my review of that  film, I don't have to like a character  to find  them interesting, but they have to be interesting in some way.  This was  just  contrived  misery.",1437609600,,728,4.73109243697479
5003682,4,B006LQY3KU,"Good film, better than I expected.  I was expecting a few more intimate scenes between the two guys but I liked the story... This film is geared towards gay high school boys, and I can fully appreciate that.  Oh lord, I wish when I was growing up in the 90s, this film had been out there.  I could have used it.  The actors, particularly the one who plays Hubert's mom, are excellent.  I was expecting that this was going to be a low budget gay film, given that Dolan was just a kid when he did this.  But, somehow he got the funding to do a bonafide feature.  The ending...I didn't care for too much but overall, this film is a good inclusion to the ""good gay films"" market.",1436400000,5,675,4.186046511627907
5003683,2,B006LQY3KU,"I have watched movie I Killed My Mother yesterday. It is boring. The acting is subpar because the writing has no storyline other than a typical teenager who has a love/hate relationship with his parent- the mother; which in the same way, the mother has a love/hate relationship with her son.

I was skipping through this movie to get to moments that would flesh out the characters and their developments but there was none. Also there were some scenes that the main character dealt with that made no sense because nothing that lead up to the tension.

Someone has a review on imdb where they compare this movie to movies Rebel Without a Cause and My Own Private Idaho, I can see where that point of view is coming from just because of the teenage angst BUT that is the only comparison! Rebel Without a Cause is a movie I enjoy watching the dvd all the time, however it has a storyline. It has character development for all the characters so we see them deal with situations along with reacting and becoming wise to what has happened.

Now there is credit I will give to this movie, it definitely shown the dynamic of a teenager and a parent having their typical love/hate relationship like pretty much any real life one. In addition, the way the relationship of the two teenage boys was portrayed smoothly and typical lovey dovey couple whenever they were shown together, which is uncommon to see in movies similar to this one.

Overall, my rating for the movie I Killed My Mother out of ten stars is four.",1428796800,,1506,4.546125461254612

5003692,5,B006LQY3KU,"As sometimes happens with Qubec films, this one, initially released on DVD in some editions in French only with no English subtitles (or even none at all in either language), came out initially unilingually, but now that the passage of years has made ""J'ai tu ma mre"" (""I Killed My Mother"") internationally successful enough, a new edition (Kino Lobber K-1068) has appeared with the English subtitles included but with the dialogue still heard in French, as so many Anglophone viewers of non-English-language motion pictures prefer. In the U. K., of course, the film, with the dialogue still in French only and with the English subtitles, is available separately, too, for purchase but it also may be had as part of a compilation, along with Dolan's other films, ""Heartbeat"" (""Les Amours imaginaires"") and ""Laurence Anyways"", with some brief but welcome bonus features for two of the three movies. In the U. S. of A. and in the Dominion of Canada, however, that set of the three films together, collectively titled ""La Folie d'amour: the Xavier Dolan Collection"" (Network Releasing 7953852), with some brief bonus features included for two of the three films, has not come available yet (as of mid-2014) in a domestic edition using the North American video standard (NTSC), but it is available here and there as an import coded for PAL. It has been worth the wait, to say the least of it, to have the movies, in various choice options for the three of them, with the English subtitles included!

Only 25 at the time of this writing (2014), and only only 20 years old when ""J'ai tu ma mre"" was filmed and released, and this film is, at that (but before ""J'ai tu ma mre"", more limitedly as actor only), one of several films already to his credit by 2009, Xavier Dolan is an incredibly precocious cinematic genius. His artistry seems to have appeared, fully formed and functioning in all of the cinematic activities that his career embraces, right at the very outset of his career, accomplishing brilliantly all aspects of it simultaneously in ""J'ai tu ma mre""!

The film is quasi-autobiographical and, given how subjective its entire subject is, about the conflicted relationship of the teenaged boy (16, then 17 years old during the action) with his mother (and, in passing during a scene, with his estranged father, too), the film is marvellously and judiciously well paced and coherent. Dolan, who acts in the film as well as directs it and had written its screenplay, looks very much the lad in his late teens, even if he was slightly older than that at the time of the film; many young guys at 20 still are decidedly adolescent in appearance, as Dolan looks in this film.

Recounting the story line in great detail for Amazon seems rather pointless; there is a good entry, including numerous fine reviews, on the Internet Movie Data Base (IMDb) that sum up and assess the film nicely. Most of the time Hubert (Dolan's role) is vituperatively at odds with his suburbanite, middle class mother, Chantale (acted by Anne Doral), who has to have (and does have) the patience of a female Job to deal with Hubert, but he has intermittent tender moments with her, too. Hubert's relationship with his teenage male paramour, Antonin (acted by Franois Arnaud, a sumptuously attractive lad himself at the age he was when making the film!), has attained mental maturity sooner than Hubert, but he still sizzles with gay teenage ardour, as Hubert does, in the lovers' sex scene together). Sometime folks forget that such early maturity as Antonin's can be a part of being human at that age. Niels Schneider, whose Apollonian fair, curly-headed blond, male loveliness were so astonishingly, achingly present in Dolan's film, ""Les Amours imaginaires"" (of 2010, the year following ""J'ai tu ma mre""), being, albeit in a different and contrasting sort of way, even more gorgeous than Dolan himself, plays the beautiful school chum, ric, who has a gay crush on Hubert at the Roman Catholic, rural boarding school to which Hubert's parents have sent him in order to deal with their son's obstreperous behaviour. Being the target of a gay-bashing incident there, in Magog, drives Hubert to run away from the boarding school, his patient mother finding him in the same locale as that of the opening of the film, where Dolan and Chantale had lived blissfully in Hubert's early childhood. Things turn out that it is Antonin, not ric, who holds Hubert's affection and loyalty, as, the viewer feels reassured at movie's end, does his own mother, despite the ruggd ways that the two have been traversing during Hubert's teen years.

The actors are all very fine, including, not mentioned so far, Hubert's caring school teacher, Julie (played by Julie Clment), at public school prior to Hubert's banishment to the Magog area's private school, and Antonin's mother, Hlne (acted by Patricia Tulasne), a more exuberant woman and readily accepting mother than Chantale is for Hubert. They and the rest of the cast are all very fine actors, totally believable.

Get this movie on DVD soon! Now that there is an U. K. edition in English, there is no longer any excuse to delay doing just that!",1406160000,2,5161,4.880273660205245
5003693,4,B006LQY3KU,"A cute 16-year-old gay boy lives at war with his single mother.  The anger and hostility, mostly but not entirely coming from the son, is palpable.  And it is somewhat deserved.  This film is painful to watch but impossible to turn away from at the same time.  Xavier Dolan, the actor playing the boy who also wrote and directed the film, is riveting in his first film.

5003695,4,B006LQY3KU,"I had a really strange feeling while I was watching I Killed My Mother this morning.  I have a strong feeling that, had I seen this back in 2009, I would have raved it to high heavens.  Unfortunately, the film was not released stateside until last year and so I was not able to see it until now.  So, instead of seeing this when it was made (and raved) I had to wait until after I had seen Dolans second and third films.  Looking at a filmmakers roots can be a really informative activity.  It helps you to see where that director came from and see the growth they have made over the course of their career.  Its strange to talk about Xavier Dolans career as if it were miles long, since hes only made four films (Tom at the Farm has not been released stateside yet), but watching I Killed My Mother within the same year as I saw Laurence Anyways shows SO MUCH growth it is almost as if he has been making films for years.

Dolan has a direct style and signature way of presenting his material.  This can be distracting when he doesnt know when to rein it in.  Laurence Anyways was such a beautiful example of using your visual style as a key plot devise, but allowing yourself to pull back in order to progress your story properly.  It was effortlessly restrained.

I Killed My Mother has no restraint.

Like I said, had I seen this back when it was released, before Dolan perfected his style, I think I would have loved this so much more.  I probably would have been raving the potential that he has as a filmmaker and truly lauding his direct and brash ability to portray harsh realities with such graceful beauty.  Watching this through eyes that are already accustomed to Dolans more polished work has me noticing every flaw instead of basking in the unfiltered glory of this directorial debut.

Its really hard to believe that this is Dolans FIRST film, for it is already so specific, so identifiable.  He knows who he is as a storyteller, and that alone is the ultimate refreshment.

I Killed My Mother is a semi-autobiographical account of Dolans life.  The story centers on a sixteen year old boy named Hubert who lives with him mother Chantale.  They fight ALL THE TIME.  It doesnt help that Hubert is hiding the fact that he is gay from his mother and is flunking out at school.  Unable to communicate, the two are always at odds until Chantale finally reaches a breaking point and sends Hubert off to boarding school.  Through the love of others (namely his boyfriend, Antonin and his teacher, Julie), Hubert starts to put the pieces of his life together, starting with his own identity and finally leading him to a reconciliation of sorts with his mother, who is just trying to do her best while processing the whole thing herself.

I once had a friend, who I sadly don't speak to anymore, who told me a story once about his coming out to his mother.  He told me about sitting on her bed late at night when he was about fifteen and breaking down, thinking that she was going to hate him.  Instead, she held his head in her lap and stroked his hair while he cried and cried and he said that it was the closest he had ever felt to her.  Like I said, we don't speak anymore (which I am sadly to blame for and I resent myself for it) and this made me ache inside, especially when I heard that his mother passed away last year.  While watching this film today I was reminded of him and his mother and the stories I had heard of their relationship, and I have to admit, I felt it.

Hard.

As a tale of self-discovery, this is exceptional.  Dolans screenplay, which he reportedly wrote at sixteen, is heartbreaking.  His directorial decisions are distinct and serve as a foreshadowing of the remarkable director hed become.  Sadly, it is his distinct vision that, at times, clouds the good hes doing here.  For the first half of I Killed My Mother, the film feels like a Pedro Almodovar soap opera with Wes Anderson production values and Terence Malick stylized framing.  This may sound like a good thing, but it is ultimately too much.  Dolan had so many ideas that he wasn't sure how to express them without overcrowding his message.  Thankfully, as the film progresses, he starts to pick away at the outlandishness of it all and deliver a very astute and powerful finale (that does last a few scenes too long, to be honest).

Dolans film is a brave one.  His story is a hard one to watch in parts because it is so honest.  I would love to know what this film would look like if 2013 Dolan directed it.

I have a feeling it would be a masterpiece.",1394496000,,4555,4.408383233532934
5003696,5,B006LQY3KU,"Absolutely love this movie.  It takes awhile to settle into it, but when you do, it's just beautiful.  The purposeful backdrops with different colors, the music score, just loved it.",1393718400,,182,5.033333333333333

5003698,4,B006LQY3KU,"Strong performances from the two key characters (teenage son Hubert and his working mother Chantale) highlight this foreign film about the challenges of single parenting in a broken family.  At times, I'm quite certain the mother must have been suffering from mental illness, but that's for the viewer to decide.  Complicating matters is an absentee and distant father, and the newly formed relationship Hubert forms with boyfriend Antonin (played by Franois Arnaud).  Add to the mix a compassionate school teacher and you have a somewhat complicated film.

There's little humor and a lot of dark and deep anger as the mother and son struggle through everyday life.  While the story per say is not so unique, the powerful acting carries much of the film.  The latter half of the film features several very emotional segments, all leading up to an ending that I loved and hated simultaneously.  A favorite part for me, accented by the soundtrack, is the scene where Hubert and Antonin are painting - it's passionate, sexual and eventually twisted.

If you're fan of independent film making, inter-personal films, family conflict, drama, mixed with a small dose of homosexuality (it really is not a significant factor in the movie), you'll definitely want to see this film.  You'll be waiting to see where it all leads.",1382832000,,1317,5.032258064516129

One review surprised me when it said this movie was for teenagers. I guess some teens might relate to a difficult relationship with a parent, but I don't see an age specific targeted audience. The story is powerful, far beyond a love-hate relationship between mother and son. The scenes were amazingly creative. This movie is complex, but not in a bad way. Each of my three viewings revealed a different character's thought not seen before. Don't let the subtitles scare you away.

This boy is presented as so privileged and petulant it's hard to find any sympathy for him.  He's manipulative, only nice when he wants something.  He does nothing in school; talks his moronic teacher into taking him in  He cheats on his boyfriend at the first opportunity.  What am I supposed to care about here? I put this down to the quality of the writing.

Anyway, I thought it was terrible.  Little film noir moments, ""heavy"" monologues  shot in B/W  are just two of the director's affectations.  Even if you are interested in understanding the difficulties between teenagers and their parents you won't find it here.",1495756800,,880,4.487341772151899
