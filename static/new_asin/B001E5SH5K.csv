To summarize some of its highlights:

The film starts with a national park guide in Alaska standing outdoors in front of glaciers and calmly explaining that the temperature there in 2004 hit 93 degrees Fahrenheit (33 C).  Wow.  We also learn from him that average annual temperatures there have increased by 4 to 7 degrees over the past 60 years.

The reason why the warming has been greater in such arctic regions than elsewhere in the world is explained later in the film.  As warmer air temperatures (even a degree or two) melt the ice sheets floating on seawater there, accordingly less white surface remains to reflect the sun's warm rays, and so the darker water of the sea instead absorbs the warm rays, which in turn leads to still warmer air temps and more melting, also of nearby glaciers.  The accelerating process is called a ""positive feedback loop,"" but there's really nothing positive in it for us.  On the contrary.

Mention is then made of increasingly early snow-melts in mountain regions worldwide, which reduces water flow from glaciers in the springtime, which in turn reduces water availability for agriculture in both spring and summer - crucial growing seasons, of course.  Glacier National Park in Montana, for example, is rapidly losing its namesake glaciers (now down to just 27 from 150 in the 19th century).

Next we learn that about 90% of the world's ice in contained in Antarctica.  Parts of the ice sheets and glaciers of West Antarctica and especially the Antarctic Peninsula are now increasingly thawing and breaking off into the sea.  However, East Antarctica's huge ice sheet is currently accumulating slightly more snow and ice.  This, we learn, is apparently due to some increased moisture in the air there.  How long that increased snowfall in East Antarctica will continue, in an ever-warming world, is uncertain.  (By the way, I think I noticed a tiny mistake here when the expert says ""West Antarctica is cold enough...,"" but really means East Antarctica.)

The question of permafrost thawing is eventually posed.  It's another ticking time bomb, due to the potential release of vast amounts of carbon dioxide and methane (both greenhouse gases) long trapped in that frozen ground.

We are also informed that Greenland's vast quantity of glacial ice, if it were all to melt into the sea, would raise sea levels by 20 feet - with catastrophic effect on coastal cities the world over, of course.  (By implication, though the film doesn't say so, sea levels would already rise 4 feet if merely one-fifth of Greenland's ice melts, which seems a very real possibility within a century or so.)

The last glacial period ended 11-12,000 years ago, and, we are told, some of its stages happened rather quickly: ""in a mere ten years, the temperatures ... rose dramatically.""  If our current and accelerating global warming rates continue, we could see the disappearance of vast amounts of glacial ice in similarly short times, with radical effects on human life: sea level rise of several feet or even meters, rivers drying up, more insects in mid-latitudes, tropical zones becoming almost uninhabitable, extreme storms, more forest fires, etc.

The film footage showing all these processes and their effects is vivid, breathtaking, and convincing.  The ice itself is beautiful in a purely aesthetic way, bringing home the message of how precious it is.  The exotic shapes and mixed blue-white colors of ice make it truly jewel-like.

I have no connection at all to the company that produced this film or to anyone in any way associated with the film.  I just happened to be browsing in the library last week for some DVDs about nature, and, of all the many about nature there, this one seemed the most important by far.  I'm glad I watched it (twice even) and wish everyone else would too - and would then take action.",1268524800,3,4007,4.903560830860534
