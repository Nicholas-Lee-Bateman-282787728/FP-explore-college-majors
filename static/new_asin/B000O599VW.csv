2790154,4,B000O599VW,I enjoyed the movie it kept my attention through out the movie and I enjoy watching David Boreanaz.,1240704000,,99,4.555555555555555
2790155,4,B000O599VW,"Sure, it's a genre picture, but a stylishly directed and well acted one.  First time helmer Ryan especially gets great performances out of the character actors (Weller and Dern) who haven't had a chance to strut their stuff onscreen like this in years. I do wish Ryan's talents in striking a nice balance between action, noir, and drama had been matched by a smarter screenplay (you want the plot to twist more and not just thicken). However, all in all it's a great showcase for some fine acting (not only by the aforementioned Weller and Dern; Farmiga, Boreanaz, and especially Thomas also come off quite well)and director Ryan, who seems to exhibit the same muscular craftsmanship of a young Sidney Lumet or Michael Mann.",1210896000,2,724,4.838709677419355
2790156,5,B000O599VW,"I loved this! I fall in love with movies for different reasons. In this case, I dug the way David Boreanaz handled himself; the tension packed angst and disgust. The lead character was just funny to me and I got a kick out of Peter Weller, but then I always have. He was a p***k in this flick. I found the plot to be overall enjoyable. Love Bruce Dern too, so I just couldn't lose with this one.",1206230400,4,395,4.076923076923077
2790157,3,B000O599VW,"The movie was good, if you a David Boreanz fan you will like it.  I would recommend the movie.",1205798400,,94,3.9473684210526314
2790158,3,B000O599VW,"I enjoyed the film.  The story was interesting.  The acting was good, though I felt some roles were miscast.",1186617600,,108,4.631578947368421
2790159,5,B000O599VW,I enjoyed this movie.  Great to see David Boroneaz doing such a fine job he is always very believable in whatever part he plays and he should go far given the right breaks.,1186099200,,172,4.212121212121212
2790160,4,B000O599VW,"While I agree this is not the best venue for David Boreanaz (the reason I bought the DVD), I enjoyed the movie. Unlike the previous reviewer, however, I think Boreanaz's strongest role is as a leading man in an action movie with, of course, some of those funny quips. He is so great in Bones and was wonderful in Angel. He's an alpha male and shines in those roles.

As for the movie itself, the plot was unlikely, but most movies are. I liked all the characters and think the movie took some great plot twists. You just never knew who was going to get shot next! Now, that's entertainment!",1182384000,9,590,4.363636363636363
2790161,1,B000O599VW,"This film is really bad - if there was a zero star rating that's what I'd have given it.  I was watching it from the perspective of a David Boreanaz fan but, even so, I had to force myself to keep watching until the end.  The plot concerns two separate groups of people plotting the same heist.  Potentially this could have had hilarious consequences but the writers forgot to inject any humour into the script.  The role of Roger really was a waste of David's talents.  He has such a gift for romantic comedy I have no idea why he would accept a role like this.  It was certainly a mistake.  Let's hope his next film is better.",1181001600,2,628,4.271186440677966

UPDATE: another copy, bought used (to avoid the same manufacture batch if possible), works okay.",1517270400,,143,4.5
8182945,5,B000O599VW,Cheers to Tom Schanley & his writing/producing partner for making this absolutely fun movie to watch.  The acting was great all around...by those star names & those less recognizable...like the writers/producers who were just great in their respective roles.,1500076800,,258,5.615384615384615

8182953,3,B000O599VW,"The killing is so nonchalant in this HBO production that it makes the whole thing unbelievable. The plot is a silly concoction involving in two unrelated groups of crooks who decide to rob a diamond store, only they all show up at once. Numerous twists and turns later, everyone but two are dead. Which two? Well, wait and see.",1322784000,,327,4.559322033898305
