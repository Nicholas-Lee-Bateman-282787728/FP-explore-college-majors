8551888,5,B00AI93YR4,"This was great entertainment and plenty of fun to watch.  Two cowboys for the price of one in this set.  You have to be a fan of ""B"" grade movies and you will enjoy this set.",1383868800,,174,3.8055555555555554
8551889,2,B00AI93YR4,"First of all, I have never been a big Jimmy Wakely fan...but decided to chance buying this split set of two B-Western stars only because of  memorable action movie plots featuring Johnny 'Mack' Brown, of which I have to admit in my opinion, these are not. The only two JMB titles which had a barely passable interest were ""MONTANA DESPERADOS"" and ""COLORADO AMBUSH"". I highly resent the merchandising strategy of packaging two cowboy actors in the same DVD set rather than making them exclusively all-Johnny Mack Brown...or all-Jimmy Wakely DVD sets. How dare they assume all Johnny 'Mack' Brown fans are also Jimmy Wakely fans....or vice versa. Among my favorite Johnny Mack Brown Monogram titles (not in this set) are: ""FLAME OF THE WEST"", ""SHADOWS ON THE RANGE"", and ""GENTLEMAN FROM TEXAS"". Had these titles been included (replacing others of course), the set would have been worth the sacrifice of a split cowboy set.",1375747200,4,920,4.974025974025974
8551890,3,B00AI93YR4,You do not identify the stars or the titles of each movie in your collections.  I don't want to buy a collection that has other stars' movies when it was implied that this was a JMB collection.  I also don't want to buy duplicates of movies I already have.,1369785600,2,256,4.204081632653061

8551892,5,B00AI93YR4,"I loved these films when I was a boy in the forties. I like seeing them again, especially with the excellent remastering for DVD. Johnny Mack Brown was a fine actor in these westerns.",1361318400,5,183,4.411764705882353
8551893,5,B00AI93YR4,Like Johnny Mack Brown western movies.  Quality and sound were very good.  Package arrived before due date and in very good condition.  Hope more Johnny Mack Brown westerns will be available in the future in this format.,1360713600,3,220,4.891891891891892
