7803162,5,6300137279,"This is one of the better exercise tapes and I was hoping to get in on DVD, because VHS is too cumbersome and damages easily.  This is for people who can not do a lot of exercise either because of health issues or too over weight.  As you continue the exercises will become easier and you will slowly lose the weight.  You don't even have to do all the exercises.  Just be consistent.",1344384000,,384,4.219178082191781
7803163,5,6300137279,"This workout to me never got the coverage that it should have.  Jayne Kennedy is great as the host and does a wonderful job at demonstrating each exercise.  The music is great, the cast is lively, and it delivers a solid workout that is accessible to a wide range of body styles.  I really like the warm up and the cool down parts.  She does have a full tilt workout that is non stop motion and gets the body rocking.  I picked this  up when it originally came  out on VHS  and then lost my copy and was able to get another copy and had it converted to DVD, if you get the chance to pick this up please do.  She also put out a vinyl of the workout with instructional fold out as well, it's the same workout but you don't get to see the lovely and talented Jayne in action. There are some video clips of the tape available on Youtube if you want to check it out, I may try myself to post some at some point and to scan the cover of the tape as well.  Hopefully they will reissue this or someone will make this available in a higher more current format.  My copy is as best it can be considering it was used when I got it, and the tape of course had degraded some.  But I am more then happy to have this back in to my workout regime.",1302998400,6,1231,3.959349593495935
