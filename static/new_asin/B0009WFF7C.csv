He used to be good when he was on Toy Machine, but all he friggin' skates is FDR park now. Mmmmyep. Quite sick. No wonder Jenn Rivell left him.",1132444800,4,279,4.0
2326887,5,B0009WFF7C,"The last set didn't have commentary.... I pray this set does, PLEASE HAVE COMMENTARY! Because, well, I loved it on the first set.

I digress.

Great series, and the show seems to keep getting more fun and interesting. These DVD's play really well for me, because I can loop them and watch them for weeks at a time in my room. I know this series is supposed to be all about the comedy, but somehow it makes me feel cozy.",1129507200,8,419,4.225
2326888,4,B0009WFF7C,"Soooo many great episodes in the 4th season; 5th season is alright but I felt they sort of 'jumped the shark' so to speak as they did all that international crap, although some of it was funny with Don Vito

Can't wait to watch the famous scene of when Don Vito confronted a taxi cab driver in Paris, France trying to give the guy like $30 American....which was waaaaay more than needed but the French cab driver kept trying to tell him that he didn't accept American cash

so Vito went ballistic and so did the cab driver lol",1129507200,6,526,4.303030303030303

2326890,5,B0009WFF7C,"The show Viva La Bam is about Bam Margera, a Pro Skaterboarder whose job is not just limited to skating. Of Course his other job could be considered basiclly doing what Aston Kutcher Does on Punk'd everyday, but to his Family. Ape his Mom (April Margera) his dad Phil Margera who is obviously overweight, along with Phils brother Don Vito who seems to get the worst of Bams wrath of pure destruction. Bam and his friends basically are jerks to everybody, including each other. The basis of the show is... Bams and friends wrath of destroying, skating, pissing off, and just plain screwing off. How Such a show can be inviting is that its like a car wreck, its so bad that you cant look away. Viva La Bam is taking a huge step by being the first show to be on PSP, that is on UMD, and will hopefully not be the last to make this move. Not only that but for 16-17 bucks how can it not be worth it?",1123027200,9,895,4.209302325581396

2327045,5,B0009WFF7C,"For 5 seasons, Brandon Margera, aka ""Bam"" was the poster child for rebellion with his ability to do whatever he wanted to do just as long as it drove the rest of his family and friends completely nuts.  And for 5 seasons fans tuned in to see what Bam would do next.

Well for those that wanted to see the final barrage of stunts and adventures involving Bam, April, Phil, Don Vito and Bam's running buddies (Ryan Dunn, Raab Himself, Brandon DiCamillo aka ""Dico"" and Rake Yohn) the final 2 seasons of Viva La Bam are finally out in Viva La Bam: Complete Seasons 4 & 5.

The series draws to a close with the final 16 episodes of VLB on 2 discs (1 for season 4 and 1 for season 5) as Bam and crew continue to do ""whatever the ... {they} want"" and raise more trouble and calamity for their parents and uncle.

Season 4 starts with a 2-parter that finds Phil and April heading off to Europe to celebrate their anniversary.  Bam decides to crash the trip and turn it into a trip across Europe, VLB style that includes Vito having to dress in clothing that relates to the country they are in and ending with Phil and Ape getting a dinner prepared by the gang that goes way awry when...well I won't spoil it for you but one person gets in deep trouble and it isn't who you would normally suspect.  Other episodes find the crew needing jobs to pay a major heating bill, Bam creating his own state and heading off to celebrate Groundhog Day.

In Season 5, the gang starts off by heading off to Brazil to check out the sights and have fun (except Dico, who sticks around to torment Phil and Ape), April celebrating her birthday with a little unique help from Bam and crew (and Billy Idol, who helps Bam turn his $250,000 Lambo from a hardtop into a convertible...just call it an instant ""Pimp My Ride""), Vito finally getting revenge on Bam with a little help from Mike Vallely (this episode is CLASSIC) and in another episode stealing Bam's Hummer, and in the final episode of the series Bam tries to reunite Raab with the mail order bride he met and married in season 2.

At the end Bam states that there will not be a 6th Season of VLB but the door is left open for future specials so just because the final episode is of the series doesn't totally mean that the hijinks are all done for Bam and crew.

The 3rd disc is a bonus dice containing deleted scenes from both seasons of the show, an episode of MTV Cribs that toured the house for the show, and a ""bonus"" episode of the show called Viva La Top 5 which showcases the top 5 moments from the series in 5 different categories.

The discs also contain additional commentary on all episodes from Bam and the entire gang (and FINALLY we hear Don Vito on commentary!!!)

SO if you are a Viva La Bam fan and already have the first 3 seasons in your DVD collection then VLB: Complete Seasons 4 & 5 is essential to complete your set.  They say that the best go out on top and no one can argue that Bam did it, though technically the book isn't written on the final chapter...just this part of the VLB story.",1140998400,7,3045,4.276521739130435
2327046,2,B0009WFF7C,"I wasn't really sure how I was going to start this review. But let me first off say that I am a huge fan of anything Bam's been in.

I have Season 1 on PSP and I thought it would just get better with the other seasons.

I was wrong. This lacked the randomness that Bam & Co. was known for in earlier Jackass and CKY videos. MTV wrapped their hands around this and got what they wanted. Comedy that is completely over the top and unbelievable.

Finding Phil & Ape in Paris? Finding Random Hero and Don Vito in Times Sqaure? C'mon people.

Maybe that's what's so appealing about these last two 'seasons'.

It was just so set-up and beyond possibility. I'm not asking for my 30 bucks back, but I can only reccomend this set for completests.",1140307200,2,737,4.273381294964029
2327077,3,B0009WFF7C,"Viva La Bam, basically a spin-off of Jackass, has since become my new favorite show, or at least the first three seasons did. The latest seasons, however, don't seem right. They seem staged, as if every little thing was planned ahead of time. The randomness of the first few seasons is gone. While it's not bad, it just isn't the same. Both seasons have their gems of episodes, but most of them flop. The best part of this collection is the extras DVD. Here is where the randomness is, with deleted scenes too crazy to show on TV, and my favorite, the ""Random A** Moments,"" which is basically a collection of skits that weren't on the show but in the shows format (unlike deleted scenes, which start and finish without any intros or anything: you'll see what I mean by this when you see the DVDs). Also on the bonus DVD is ""Viva La Top 5"" which is an award-like show that has some of the best moments in each well-known category (messing with Phil, messing with Vito, April freak outs, best food moments, and best wake-ups).

While the latest collection of Viva La Bam episodes are fun, I can't actually recommend buying this collection for anything other than the bonuses and the commentary. If you've seen the episodes on MTV, however, even the bonuses isn't worth the price. I personally bought it because I haven't seen the newest seasons and planned to get the collection later on. While I'm not disappointed, I know it could have been better.",1138665600,,1448,4.590733590733591
2327078,2,B0009WFF7C,"Jackass wasn't very revolutionary, it was just popular. The invention of Viva La Bam was genius, being everything Jackass was not. The funniest part of any Jackass episode was the CKY/Bam stunts, so naturally an MTV show of his own was in order.

Viva started out pretty great. The first season easily being the best. But it seems once Bam got ahold of his new mansion and let fame get to his head, the show went downhill. Each episode since has been gradually worse than the last.

In seasons 4 and 5, we are reduced to watching a posed ""reality TV"" sequence of stunts, that were obviously planned by the producers. Take the first episode, Viva La Europe for instance. We are made to believe theat Bam didn't know his parents were headed to Europe, this whole scene was obviously staged. He goes to Europe and some reality ensues, only to follow with more staged acting and creative editing by the crew. My favorite instance is the Billy Idol episode on season 5. Wow. Bam does a convincing acting job pretending to just ""come up"" with the idea of sawing off the roof of the lamboghini. Idol, however, isn't as convincing and hopefully never appears in a feature movie role (aside from Wedding Singer). Glomb magically shows up with a saw to cut off the roof. Ooooo! How Crazy!! Lame as hell.

The 2 seasons drone on, and we are forced to watch how ""crazy"" the CKY crew has become. What happened to the random stunts these talented guys used to pull? Who wants to watch 30 mins of planned out events and bad acting? If I had a million dollars and time to plan, I could wreck a house with a crane, too. But I wouldn't pretend that I was in a ""war"" with Mike Vallely (horrible actor as well) and tape it, pawning it off as original and spontanious.

The only believeable characters in this show are Phil and (most of the time) Ape. Unless the rest of the crew can go back to what they were doing 10 years ago, they have lost any credibility in my mind. Complete phonies. Might as well do a sitcom. It'd be the same thing.",1137715200,8,2020,4.393048128342246
2327079,5,B0009WFF7C,"Say what you want to say about Bam or the show...he moved from Jackass where he killed himself doing stupid stunts for nothing, to his own show where he's evidently now a millionaire living in a big home he bought for his parents and living the good life with his friends as a total goof off.  We should all be so lucky!  I also can't believe it's been 5 seasons.  How is it that the show started in 2004 and yet they've done 5 seasons?

At any rate season four starts as the whole cast go to Europe.  Phil and april think they are going off to enjoy a romantic getaway on their own not knowing that Bam, Vito, and the rest of the gang are going along too.  The road/air trip would be a recurring theme throughout seasons 4 & 5 as the troupe would journey to Louisiana, Mexico, Pennsylvania (For Groundhog's day), Brazil and Finland.

Among my favorite episodes are ""Ape's Birthday Surprise"" where Bam surprises April with meeting and getting on Stage with Billy Idol, ""Lost Lambo"" where Ryan challenges Bam to a race but his prized lamborgini comes up missing, and the one where Bam knocks out Vito's bedroom window and replaces it with an automatic garage door.

Silly, infantile, and darn funny.",1136937600,13,1198,4.488479262672811
