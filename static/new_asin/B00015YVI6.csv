I could go on.
I think I will....
Lame characters. Terrible use of music. (WHO decided to use that terrible remake of ""I'm Not in Love""?) Waste of Firth. Small thank you to Oliver Platt for (once again) being the only good thing in a veddy bad movie.
The. Plot. Barely. Moves.
I dare anyone to give a rat's patoot which of the two boring females boring British protagonist chooses.
Hackneyed use of ""charming, oafish, quirky East-coast Americans.""

1973550,2,B00015YVI6,"I watched this movie because it has Colin Firth, whom I fondly remember as being the first Mr. Darcy in a production of Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" who ever managed to make the transition from snob to heartthrob over the course of the story.  Firth made a trio of pretty good movies in 2003, from the cute ""What a Girl Wants,"" to the sublime ""Girl with a Pearl Earring,"" and the romantic ""Love Actually.""  That same year he made ""Hope Springs,"" and if you are wondering why you did not hear much about this film it is because most people who see it are not going to want to admit the fact.
The story, such as it is, finds Colin Ware (Fifth), an English artist who was jilted by his girlfriend deciding for reasons that passeth understanding to flee to the small town of Hope, Vermont.  There he will draw charcoal portraits of the men and women there while he forgets her.  Helping Colin with this quest is Mandy (Heather Graham), who is a bit strange and is drawn to jump around naked in front of him.  Just as Colin becomes comfortable with Mandy, his ex-girlfriend Vera (Minnie Driver) arrives in town.  Apparently Colin was not really jilted, so now we have a love triangle where the only problem is that we have no real reason to have a voting interest in any of the characters.
What makes this so remarkable is that ""Hope Springs"" is based on the novel ""New Cardiff"" by Charles Webb, who wrote the novel ""The Graduate.""  It has been over three decades since the celebrated film version of ""The Graduate"" was produced and the only other novel of Webb's to make it to the screen was the 1971 bomb ""The Marriage of a Young Stockbroker.""  But then Hollywood is full of stories of people for whom lightning did not strike twice and with this film Webb threatens to be the poster boy for such unfortunate souls.
The film is set in a Vermont town that has the most boring collection of New England eccentrics we have probably ever seen on screen.  Both Mary Steenburgen and Oliver Platt are wasted in supporting roles, but then the same can be said for Firth, Graham and Driver.  The only reason to like Colin the character is because we like Colin the actor, since there is nothing to warrant our attraction to the character in this film beyond his sense of befuddlement.  When the best jokes in a film have to do with Catharine Zeta-Jones and smoking on a golf course, you know things are in bad shape.  When you get to the point where you are supposed to get teary eyed and you yawn instead, you know this film can sink no lower.  It is not so much that this is a bad film as it is that it is just not good.
Will Colin choose Mandy or Vera?  I do not care and cannot think of much reason for anybody else to care as well.  Maybe this film would have done better if it had a cast of nobodies instead of recognizable names who squander the good will they have built up in other films.  For example, I have seen Graham do a nude scene in another film, so when she does one in which we never really see anything it just seems strange, which does set the town for the rest of this disjointed film.  When Driver shows up it is impossible to believe that she and Firth ever had any chemistry.  It is a good thing that Firth had those other films in the can by the time this one was released.  If you have three pretty good films in one year that is pretty good, even if there is a bomb like this in the mix.
The bottom line is that I saw this movie so that you do not have to.  If you like Colin Firth then I would tell you to go check out ""Girl with a Pearl Earring,"" because that is probably the one you missed given its box office receipts and it is a gem of a film.  This one is just a disappointing, boring mess.",1081382400,31,3720,4.233380480905233
1973551,5,B00015YVI6,"(...) The movie is based on the book ""New Cardiff"" by the same man that wrote THE GRADUATE (not a bad pedigree) and-SHOCK-the character's name was ALREADY COLIN!!!!  Just a happy coincidence or maybe serendipity (don't worry, Tennessee gal--you can look those words up in the dictionary).  This is a delightful movie, very faithful to the book--the best part is that Colin is in virtually every scene! It's a shame that the studio did not release the film to US theaters--it was very well received in the UK.  Colin shows his charming comic ability and self-depricating humor.  I'm sure he gets tired of looking angry or unhappy in his other films--this gives him a chance to show his wonderful smile! (also, Love Actually is one of the funniest films made and was a runaway hit in the US)",1081382400,3,789,4.695652173913044
1973552,4,B00015YVI6,"In Brief
When British artist Colin Ware (Firth), discovers that his fiance Vera (Driver), the love of his life, is going to marry another man he gets on a plane for America and ends up in a tiny town called Hope.  Distraught, he soon finds more than a shoulder to cry on when his innkeepers introduce him to Mandy (Graham) a beautiful nurse.  But no sooner has Colin forgotten about his old flame than Vera shows up.
Review
Romantic Comedies usually have that mix of candy floss content that makes you think you can eat a whole one, as how hard can it be to eat sugar whipped in air?  Yet when you attempt it you realise that while there really isn't anything to it, you cant finish as its sickly sweet and forcing yourself to throw it away you are left feeling very unsatisfied.  Now while that analogy may make you cringe you'll be thankful to know that Hope Springs certainly won't.  Indeed this is one of those rare hybrid films that feature an Anglo-American crossover romance and succeeds in mixing sass and irony very well so that both sides of the Atlantic may appreciate its story.
Following in the footsteps of Notting Hill and Four Weddings this slice of American apple pie sets the story in the ideally named small town of Hope, where a typically English gent (Firth) has escaped his long-term fiance to find himself anew.  Mandy (Graham) is the tonic everyman desires, and while its beginning to become a familiar story of estranged love finds new passion, both play their roles with a freshness that really lights up the screen.
Steenburgen and Collison are perfect as the comedy cupids that help steer true love on its path.  While the local residents of the small town all have a part to play in both hindering and helping the pairing of Mandy & Colin.  Indeed, the local mayor played by Oliver Platt is a brilliant encapsulation of the small time business man turned big time thinker, and he brings a slightly toned down but nicely timed comic turn throughout.
Like all romantic comedies the only major downside are their predictability.  They all share the same fate, yet its an example of good filmmaking if the story can be remoulded as if to give the impression that its slightly original or at least engaging.  Unfortunately Hope Springs is not original, but it does its job well and passes 90 minutes without temptation to make itself something far greater than it should be.
The Verdict
This is the ABC of romance, told with such a sincerity by all members of the cast that you cant help but enjoy it.  Colin Firth may have moved on from the wet shirt days of Pride & Prejudice and though he may no longer be Mr. Darcy I don't believe he will disappoint.  A delightful pairing with Graham works well, and Hope Springs is enough to give anyone that 90 minute dream we all need sometimes.",1073520000,95,2810,4.564612326043737

As a matter of fact, the whole town is funny - they all know what's going on right down to that Colin Firth does not wear any underwear!.  I rented this movie at first and after watching it a couple of times, I decided to buy it. This way I can watch it over and over again when I need a good laugh.  I have always liked Minnie Driver (she was so funny in 'Phantom of the Opera') and she does not disappoint in Hope Springs.  Of course I have to mention Colin Firth who at the moment is my #1 actor (after watching Pride and Prejudice a dozen times and most of his other movies.  He is very good in dramatic roles but can be very funny too. Love him!  All in all, Hope Springs is a movie that I can recommend if you need to feel good.  The ending with the 'cousin' was a bit stupid but, heck, they got together  that's all that's counts.",1435276800,3,950,4.125
1973655,3,B00015YVI6,"It could of been better, it could of been worse. I enjoyed this movie but the chemistry between Colin Firth and Heather Graham seemed strained. Although Graham acted her heart out, I think the problem was Firth. This movie seemed more like a Hugh Grant movie. And odds are, Grant was the first choice. But Firth is a great actor, but he just seemed out of place in this fluffy, lite rom-com. And, actually, he seemed to be a better match for the Minnie Driver character, who I loved in this movie. The ending was predictable and silly, even stupid, at the same time. The supporting cast was excellent.  Mary Steenburgen was so funny. Put Hugh Grant in this movie and it would have gotten 5 stars from me.",1434153600,,704,4.457364341085271

Nevertheless, I was determined to endure it to the end - all the while hoping against ""Hope"" that the dashing Mr. Darcy would eventually make an appearance. He did not. Instead, this impostor develops a midlife mismatched infatuation with a ditz no where near his equal in gravitas. Even the conclusion is ponderously tedious.

It was just the same love story told in a weird way. I don't know if the attempt was trying to give VT some culture. It reminded me of Runaway Bride where the folks of the setting--a MD town--were all shown to have unique personalities--quirky. It reminded me of Sweet Home, Alabama, where the Alabama town folk were all shown to be to have unique personalities--quirky. It reminded me of . . . well you get the idea. In the end all these people in VT, MD, and AL seem just like each other and like they are from the same town--Hollywood. The love story part just wondered into oblivion. I mean the ending was kinda cute that the ""cousin"" came back and why. But what was the British chick still doing in town? What was that about? What was the deal with the family tree?

They would lead you to believe that your brain might turn to mush, that you may find yourself sitting in a corner drooling, perhaps beating yourself around the head for wasting the time and or money to pick up and watch this film.

Well I'm thankful that I am not like them, because I rather enjoyed it.  I have yet to see a movie that is as bad as they make it out to be.  Granted, ""Hope Springs"" is no ""Citizen Kane"", but then again it is no ""Crimewave"" (a 1985 movie that I think is the worst movie ever made).  If you go into a romantic comedy expecting what most romantic comedies are, a pleasant diversion, then 99 times out of 100 you get what you expect.  If you go in expecting high art, then you are bound for disappointment.  Most the haters said they expected more out of Colin Firth and Minnie Driver.  Many actors have made films that they are ashamed to include on their resumes, but I doubt that this is one of them.  I personally would rather watch a movie like this than your run of the mill Tom Cruise $300M blockbuster that makes $100M on the 1st run (Colin Firth is an ACTOR, Tom Cruise is a movie star).  Maybe they would have liked it more  if some lesser actors were in it, but then they only watched it because of Driver and Firth, so they probably would not have watched it in the first place, and we then would not be having this conversation.  I better wrap this up, I'm starting to confuse even myself.

When it comes to dialogue, not a single word rings true. None of the characters make any sense at all. They are reading lines and getting into situations that are so dull, and so ridiculously unbelievable, that one wonders if the film were written by a group of typing monkeys who happened to hit letters that formed words, rather than a cognizant human being.

We couldn't get through it, as it was clearly outside the realm of possibility that the clueless writer-director could ever have his characters do anything that anyone else on the planet would care about.

1973936,2,B00015YVI6,"Generally, I think that actors can make a film worth watching even when the script isn't that good. A good performance can make an otherwise unremarkable script seem better than it is. But actors like Colin Firth, an actor with a quiet, almost passive acting style, cannot hope to compete with this stultifying, cloying, saccharine screenplay. This movie goes back and forth on a linear timeline for virtually the entire 92 minutes, creating the feeling that there has been no passage of time at all. It's suffocating, a static, energy-sapping, eyelid-drooping tour of duty through Mark Herman's drifting career - as is the cinematography which frames every scene so tight and close that you feel like leaving the room yourself just to get some air.

Besides a limp storyline, the dialogue is frightfully bad, barely a laugh anywhere. That the resolution of the film, Colin Firth carrying the usually bounteous Heather Graham - reduced here to some kind of carefully-wrapped, de-sexed, small-town butter queen - for an inordinate distance for no apparent reason other than to use up some of the movie's endless-seeming running time, is pitiful. The payoff to this awkward forced march? When the two begin stripping off their clothes, apparently as prelude to some even more tame lovemaking, guess what? Firth's character throws out his back. Gales of laughter do not ensue.

An earlier scene, in which the also usually sexy Minnie Driver - whose body is arguably superior to that of Ms. Graham - strips to her negligee, is shot and lit so poorly that we never get the impact of the omnipresent sexuality that is supposed to be driving Mr. Firth throughout the film. Without this sexuality in the two women, Firth's desire is muted, confused, and desultory, his performance has nothing to work off of. Firth is an actor who requires impetus from his surroundings, from other's characters, and from the story itself. He receives none of this and so begins to appear an even more reluctant player than usual.

There is usually one person to blame for something like this: the director who, in this case, is also the writer. Blame them both, and give the actors a pass on this one.",1134172800,7,2177,4.894308943089431

I will admit, she was alright up until she got drunk in the car. That. Was. Annying beyond reason.

  Other than that, the film's set up is absolutly horrible, starting off with Colin coming to a town just because it's called Hope? And falling in love with someone only after a couple of days? And there is also the horrible music that doesn't fit the mood at all whenever they play at the scene.

1973949,1,B00015YVI6,"This movie was quite honestly one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  As a huge Colin Firth fan originally from a small town in Vermont, I thought that no matter what I had heard about the film I would enjoy it.  Unfortunately,  I was wrong.

The main problem of the film was characterization.  There were oftentimes no motivations or explanations whatsoever for the character's actions.  One minute, the small town girl played by Heather Graham is working at a nursing home, then she's downing alcohol, then she's jumping around naked for absolutely no apparent reason (in fact, she doesn't even seem drunk), and all this entices the character Colin Firth to jump into bed with her.  I think the Heather Graham character is supposed to be quirky, but because of the script and the way the film is cut, she comes off as schitsophrenic and unlikable.  Then suddenly they are in a serious relationship which Colin dives into wholeheartedly even though he is supposed to be recovering from a breakup with his fiance (and this is no rebound relationship).  Basically, the movie continues along this vein, with Minnie Driver showing up as the dark-haired British ex-fiance who you can't see ever having had a relationship with Colin (both actors are better in the much superior movie Circle of Friends).  In any case, there are many more unexplained actions and wierd breakups/get back togethers before the movie thankfully ends.

Additionally, the setting is completely misused, beginning with the sign that says more than 18,000 people live in Hope.  In New England, that does not classify as a small town.  They could have used the autumn setting and American-ness of the people as restorative to the Colin character.  The suggestion of that is there, but it is never demonstrated - instead, they go to a spot that is supposed to be nice and the Heather Graham character downs a bottle of booze, and Colin Firth's character has no real explanation or feeling in his portraits of the town's people.  Although the hotel owners are fun, if unrealistic, the mayor has been written as if he were a cartoon character.

  Finally, I don't neccessarily blame the actors for this awful movie, with the wierd cutting, it may have seemed like a good idea at the time.  I think Colin Firth does his best at being an ambigious, but still likeable guy.  Heather Graham, aside from not coming off as a small town girl at all, has absolutely nothing to work with, so you can't even blame her for the horrendous character she has.  And everyone else, including Minnie Driver, is a complete caricature, although Minnie Driver incites some of the few amusing moments in the film.

  I feel bad to judge this movie so harshly, but it is unneccessarily bad, and I had been hoping for something at least fun.  These actors all have much better movies out there.",1121385600,15,2840,4.770491803278689

He sets about making himself part of the town ,sketching portraits of the locals and even finds time to fall in love with Mandy,played by Heather Graham .Then matters are complicated by the arrival of Vera, anxious to resume her relationship with Colin

Considering this stellar cast, I expected quite a bit.  It was fun in some areas, but full of gaps elsewhere--maybe those parts weren't that important in this movie, I don't know.  About the main characters:  I thought Colin Firth handled his role as well as he could.  He actually seems like a real person in this movie--emotional, heartbroken, spontaneous, fun--very far from Mr. Darcy of Pride and Prejudice and Mark Darcy of the Bridget Jones series.  Minnie Driver plays Vera very well as an authoritative hoity-toity, almost to the point where she may be typecast.  My experience of Heather Graham is brief.  Her Mandy is rather mysterious in some ways; but to some degree, she brings out the fun in Colin Ware.

Granted, every one of them has done better work elsewhere, and are surely doing better work in future movies.  If you need substance, then you might check them out.

Sure it was predictable, what romantic comedy these days isn't, I mean honestly?!  Regardless, I loved the quirkiness of the characters and the way they progressed through the film.  Colin Firth being his usual self, a heartbroken man attempting to pick up the pieces, Heather Graham as the small town girl who never quite finds love, and Minnie Driver as the selfish EX that has everything but wants the one thing she can no longer have.

1973970,2,B00015YVI6,"You may not know the original writer Charles Webb, or his book 'New Cardiff' on which this romantic comedy is based.  Actually, he wrote the original book of 'The Graduate' which made one Dustin Hoffman many years ago.  But the wit and irony found in the classic is not to be found here.  It's just lamentably ... dull.

Dull is the word.  Well, things happen, but not credible way.  Talented (and often underrated) Colin Firth is artist Colin, Englishman flying from his home to a small New England town un USA, after the break-up with his long-standing girlfriend Vera.  He rents a room in this quiet, sleeping town of Hope (with Oliver Platt at Town Hall), and starts drawing again.

And a new girl knocks on the door; Mandy (Heather Graham), a 'carer' who, with her all good intentions, tries to 'heal' him.  Not bad for Colin, especially when she is winsome Heather Graham, even when she drinks a bottle of some brown liquid in car, and starts to act differently.

Then, as you know, ex-love Vera shows up again, to form a love-triangle in which Colin thinks he is trapped.  (But when vera is Minnie Driver, how could he complain of that?)

I don't know why, but the film never loses the unnatural feeling.  The characters are meant for laugh, or smile, but they never make me so.  One example: in one scene, Colin hears  someone knocking on the door.  He thinks it's his new love Mandy, but of course, it's Vera.  Then, to make us laugh (I think), Colin starts dancing behind the door before opening it like an exotic dancer!  It's to suprise her, but well, we are surprised, in another meaning.

The film is full of this kind of contrived, ofren impossible events.  The only natural acting comes from Mary Steenburgen's peeping and meddling Inn owner (with good intention).  When you see TWO of the female characters in underwear to impress the characters's sexual appeal, you know something is wrong with the film, or its poor script.

Go get Fever Pitch (order from amazon.canada to get the more tastefull cover) or A Month in the Country w/Ken Brannaugh (bonus!) or if you are intrepid, obtain an Hour of the Pig/Advocate (both titles are the same movie. Even the absurd fantastical Mike Binder film Londinium/Fourplay is better.
The problem is the book is quirky and a great deal of changes were made from book to screenplay. Things get muddled and the principle explanation for why he chose America is lost. Plus, to make the town in to Hope they lost the New Cardiff-old Cardiff Vera connection that explains out a lot more of the ridiculous points.
Let's all hope that Richard Curtis does a better translation of BJ2 Edge of Reason...since missing from BJD was the whole rescue/Pride & Prejudice parallel with Darcy saving the family from disgrace. It would have been awesome! (Colin quite literally going around the world for you ending up with a chase where he's all unkempt and dishevelled....mmm) Anyways...
I own this disc and have watched more than once. It really is very fluffy and silly. But since my collection also incudes Master of the Moor and Apartment Zero, I'm going for the complete over quality thing. Bottom line is Colin is always awesome even when paired with Heather Graham.
To sum up: spend no money here...
  Instead: BJD, Fever Pitch(highly recommend!), P&P (of course!), English Patient(why would she...???), Tumbledown, Nostromo, Valmont, Donovan Quick, Hour of the Pig/Advocate, or save up for Love Actually & Girl w/pearl earring! Also remember Trauma and BJ2 coming to theaters soon!",1082764800,19,1990,4.85

8006955,4,B00015YVI6,"I've seen a few of Colin Firth's movies in the past, but after watching the Kingsman movies last year it's become a race to watch every C.F. movie I can. Some have been less than stellar,  but this one was cute, funny and sweet.

I thought the cast worked well with each other and the storyline was pretty good.  My favorite characters were hotel co-manager Fisher, who was quite the character. And of course the lady shop keeper who was a riot as the town know-it-all and local snoop. I found the ""underwear"" scene hilarious and her expressions and mannerisms were spot on.

The pace was good and it's peppered with laughs throughout.  A cute little ""rom-com"" on a slow night or weekend viewing. I'd definitely recommend it for C.F. fans. I watched it twice.",1521763200,,759,4.592592592592593
