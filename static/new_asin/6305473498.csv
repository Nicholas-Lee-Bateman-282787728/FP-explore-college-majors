That said, WITHIN THE ROCK is a low-LOW-budget&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien/dp/B00498VS1E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien</a>&nbsp;ripoff. It seems to be a made-for-cable TV movie, cheap studio sets, cheesy CGI effects, and all.

Seems there's a moon-sized asteroid headed for Earth, so this crew of miners is sent to land on it, and bore rockets deep into this moon so as to divert its path.

The miners are typical ALIEN carbon copies. They're cynical, greedy, slovenly, horny, and don't trust the corporation. You'd think with Earth in the balance, the authorities would send crack military/NASA types, but no.

There's a sorta explanation: The military will send their boys to blow up the moon if the miners fail. Which makes the miners all the more cynical about their mission.

Anyway, the miners unearth some bones in a platinum tomb. No one (except the lead scientist, a beautiful woman/Sigorney Weaver ripoff) seems to care that this is man's first encounter with alien artifacts. The miners only want to strip the tomb of its platinum.

But opening the tomb causes oxygen to enter it, and regenerate the bones into a ferocious alien, which immediately begins killing the miners.

Despite that, this is a SLOW-moving film. We're 50 minutes into the story before the killings really start. The body count is small, since the crew is small.

The science is real bad. The film is set in 2019, and by then, science can create ""oxygen walls"" -- a breathable atmosphere which can be turned on and off, expanded or contracted, and which surrounds any area, so you don't need a spacesuit. There's no physical ""wall"" -- it's just that the oxygen stops at a certain point. Yet it doesn't leak past this ""wall."" Not that anything's holding it back. A person can easily walk past this wall, but then they can't breathe without a spacesuit.

The spacesuits (for when the oxygen wall is turned off) are real crappy. These suits aren't sealed. One miner's dreadlocks are hanging out from under his helmet, into the dangerous atmosphere.

The faceplates don't provide much of a visual field (why not?), and the computer screens look like something from the 1980s, though this film was shot in the 1990s -- never mind 2019.

And what's with the gravity? This is a small, moon-sized asteroid, yet the miners walk around like it's normal Earty gravity.

Even overlooking the bad science, the story is crappy. One of the miners turns psycho and starts killing his fellow miners for NO REASON. Seriously, it has nothing to do with the alien or contamination or the atmosphere. He's just a bad dude.

I'm very generous giving WITHIN THE ROCK 3 stars. It's slow moving enough, its horror so tepid, its characters so cliched, silly, and poorly motivated, that I could justify giving it only a 2.

WITHIN THE ROCK is for ALIEN ripoff completists only.",1365984000,,4014,6.168458781362007
7889692,2,6305473498,"One of the main problems in this low budget sci fi flick is its failure to show us the monster in full detail.  A combination of ALIEN and ARMAGEDDON, WITHIN THE ROCK offers us a mining crew on a strange moon that is hurtling towards the earth.  A doctor is on board to help divert the orbit of the moon. What they don't know is that the moon is harboring a million year old demon imprisoned by an alien civilization.  The monster cannot function in oxygen-saturated air, so the crew decides it must battle it with nitrogen.  The cast includes Xander Berkeley in his typical villain role as the money-grubbing manager of the mine crew; Caroline Barclay in a lifeless portrayal of the doctor; Brandon Tatum and Brian Krause as the gungho brothers--they're actually pretty good; Calvin Levels in his typical brother role; and Michael Zelniker as the computer nerd Archer, who is also quite good.  The direction is amatuerish and the movie moves a little too slowly;it is also atrociously edited and lit.  Not a horrible film, just not a good horror film.",1089072000,3,1052,4.690217391304348
