7453356,1,B015XC8D4Y,this is a religious movie and should state so in the description,1460937600,,64,4.416666666666667
7453357,3,B015XC8D4Y,It's sad to see movies like these hardly make any onscreen reference to Jesus Christ whether it's prayer or in the sermon.,1460332800,,122,4.590909090909091
7453358,5,B015XC8D4Y,"The Masked Saint was an amazing story of a pro wrestler who becomes a pastor with issues that takes many twists and turns.  Brett Granstaff as the Saint was terrific and the wrestling scenes were the best I have ever seen in any movie.  Sadly this was Roddy Piper's last film and to his credit , he nailed the role of the promoter.  You will not be disappointed and I recommend this to everyone of all ages.  Enjoy.....",1460246400,2,419,4.333333333333333
7453359,5,B015XC8D4Y,"Rowdy Roddy Piper's final acting gig before he sadly passed, and it is his best effort (minus They Live ) ...  The story line is based on a true story of a wrestler gone Pastor - a real life nacho libre.

A heart warming film.

7453360,5,B015XC8D4Y,I loved this movie! The only thing I wish was done more...is they showed more of the childhood memories of the ( masked saint ) growing up and into the hero. But I really loved this movie. Very touching. Two movies i watch being a Christian myself is PASSION OF THE CHRIST and MASKED SAINT. Buy this movie!!!! You will enjoy the warm feelings.,1459382400,2,343,4.375

7453365,2,B015XC8D4Y,"Brett Granstaff plays Chris who is an ex Professional and masked wrestler. He retires to become a Pastor in a parish that is on the wrong side of the tracks. Once there he sees the crime and violence and a church in the grip of a megalomaniac and a congregation that is dwindling beyond the point where the church could be economically viable.

So he resurrects his old job to help his new community. This film is based on the true life of such a Pastor  so is the film any good? Well yes and no, it is watchable in a very basic way. The good guys wear white and the bad guys black. There is no subtlety here at all of ambiguity that would help to give the plot any kind of authenticity.

The acting and dialogue is terrible in places and the direction is almost missable. It is though the story that lacks credibility and the idea of marrying a Christian story with the violence of wrestling seems a bit incongruous  and it is. It is funny  when it is not meant to be and cringe worthy when it tries. If you like a guilty pleasure of a film though this sort of works. I found it to be watchable but no one was preparing an Oscar acceptance speech whilst this was in production.",1475107200,,1178,4.1946902654867255

7453368,5,B015XC8D4Y,Great movie with down to earth people.  Interesting to learn that it is based on the life of a real person.  Kept my interest from start to finish.  Thank God for men with courage and an ear to hear when God calls us out.,1472947200,,221,3.977272727272727

7453370,2,B015XC8D4Y,"Most 1 and 2 star reviews say the opposite of what my review is going to say.  They say this movie has 'a good theme' or 'a good message' but that the film itself is poorly done and does not reflect the craft to be considered 'a great Christian film.'  I dislike this film, however, precisely because it DOES NOT have a good message; i.e., it DOES NOT reflect God's values or reflect genuine Christianity.

The Deceiver does not want to appear 'satanic' to mankind; it seeks, instead, to be revered as God!  It is a usurper of God's authority who pretends to be God in order to lead us away from God's values and towards the embrace and pursuit of everything God detests.  God detests rote/meaningless prayer which keeps humans on their knees praying instead of on their feet actively helping those who God desires be helped -- so the Deceiver globally inspires visions of 'Mary' which urge people to spend hours and hours on their knees praying the rosary.

God desires that all people be respected as equal individuals, and bear the burden of necessary manual-labor chores equally so that no one person's humanity is compromised -- so the Deceiver appears to a small, hate-filled man named Saul, pretends to be Jesus, and leads Saul to write letters which endorse slavery and the enforced subservience of women (among other things).  Those letters now have more prominence within Christianity than what Jesus actually said and taught.

God is passionate about the preservation of Creation, which includes not only conservation of the environment but, as importantly, protection and 'right use' of the human brain and body.  This means He detests actions which mar and injure Creation -- so the Deceiver, in its guise as false God/false Jesus, RUSHES to promote injurious practices such as the frivolous overuse of technology (NASCAR, motorcycle gangs, truck rallies), violent sports (football, boxing, extreme sports, the 'weekend warrior' mentality) and frivolous invasions of the human body (tattooing, unnecessary surgeries or surgeries to appease one's vanity).

Chris Whaley could not have had a genuine relationship with God yet continue performing as a WWF boxer, so the message that somehow what he did in this film was acceptable in God's eyes is a false message.  Money is a man-created tool which is OFTEN used by the Deceiver to lead individuals astray, and doing something God abhors in order to raise money for one's church is not an activity God would ever condone.  God has ways to accomplish His purposes which have nothing to do with money -- and because God doesn't care one iota about organized religion, He certainly does not care whether a clique of people owns a building in which to meet, or a pipe organ upon which to play soul-soothing hymns, or the money with which to pay a professional soothsayer (a pastor).",1470268800,,2839,4.903966597077244

7453376,2,B015XC8D4Y,"Very disappointed.  The trailer made this movie look so good.  I was going to have some friends over to watch some Christian movies, as I have been trying to convince them that there are quality Christian movies out there these days, which there are.  However, sad to say this is not one of them.  The story is great, but the acting is at times stereotypically campy.  And many of the lines are cheesy.",1466985600,,402,4.4520547945205475

After retiring from the professional wrestling ring and settling down as a small town pastor, Samuels witnesses crime and problems in the community. The Pastor decides to moonlight as a masked vigilante fighting crime. While I am happy that crime fighting bit was relatively underdone, it was interesting that He stood up to the Bully that felt he controlled the church because he contributed heavily to its upkeep. The cast was okay but I felt the standout had to go to Brett Granstaff as the Saint. He was totally believable as both the Reverend and as a Wrestler. This was a lovely story, told with a great pacing to it and the direction and emotion of the story was palpable. Low budget but good quality.",1515196800,,782,4.673913043478261
