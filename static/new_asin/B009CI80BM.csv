8539592,5,B009CI80BM,"This is an awesome dvd, I had bought a copy of it at Screams in Hell, MI but gave it away to a Vietnam Veteran when I went to the moving wall at the Multi-Lakes Conservation Club. I want to get another copy but $60 is too steep for me! I'll keep checking the store in Hell for a copy. The owner of that store is in this dvd, his story is one of those featured on the dvd. He was a Screaming Eagle and is a great guy. My little daughter always loves going to visit him and play a round of miniture golf out back. Praise God that Mr. Cologne made it through all that. I pray for and thank all America veterans. Especially our Vietnam Veterans. They didn't come home to all the glory vets have enjoyed past and present so we still owe them BIG TIME!",1453248000,,746,3.98
