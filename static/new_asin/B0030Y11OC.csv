4047804,4,B0030Y11OC,"First of all, this UFC Best of 2009 DVD is a great buy. Many great fights of many great fighters but.... Best of 2007 and Best of 2008 is way better, why? in this 2009, they talk a lot more in Ultimate Fighting Reality Show andand the journey of some fighters. At 2007, just packed with all the greatest fights of 2007, 2008? starting got some story about fighters's journey etc. But now, adding the Ultimate Fighter Show?? may be not too bad if they pick the right fights, some not to great or ""best"" of 2009, that could be replaced with a really great fights are:
1)Hughes-Serra
2) Marquardt-Maia
3) Franklin-Belfort
4) Quarry-Credeur

 they could have been :
1) Franklin-Silva
2) Machida-Rua
3) St. Pierre-Alves
4) Henderson-Bisping
5) Henderson-Franklin
6) Griffin-Ortiz II

but still, it's a great buy just like I said earlier, just a bit dissapointed with all the fights reverse above, and they still wasting time with all the UFS. The other weird thing is that they put some fights at the bonus features?? why? well, they know better, I assume.

Hopefully the Best of 2010 will be better and UFC Best DVD series will get their grip again.",1268438400,6,1145,4.653465346534653
4047805,1,B0030Y11OC,"Very few quality fights on this DVD, don't waste your time or money on this DVD. I liked the best of 2008 and 2007 UFC. But they really cut back on championship fights and quality of fights. This is my first time righting opinion on any product on amazon.com but I felt so mad for wasting My money on this product I had do something.",1268438400,2,333,4.138461538461539
4047806,4,B0030Y11OC,"I've been following the UFC since about 2006 and I've bought best of 2007 and 2008.  The first thing that sticks out in ""Best of 2009"" is the bonus fights.  They are accessed when pressing ENTER when a blue dot appears on the screen.  Personally, it would be easier if they just included all the fights without requiring this action, and people could just fast forward through the fights they don't want to see.

In case you were wondering, this is what full fights are on Disc 1: Hughes v. Serra, Condit v. Ellenberger, Marquardt v. Maia, Franklin v. Belfort, Quarry v. Credeur, Silva v. Griffin, Evans v. Machida, Liddell v. Rua, and Jardine v. Silva.  The bonus full fights are GSP v. Penn, Swick v. Hardy, Akiyama v. Belcher, Machida v. Silva, Nogueira v. Cane, and Bonnar v. Jones.

On Disc 2: Main full fights are Snachez v. Guida, Couture v. Nogueira, and Lesnar v. Mir.  The bonus full fights are Griffin v. Franca, Diaz v. Guillard, Sherk v. Edgar, Stevenson v. Diaz, Penn v. Florian, Carwin v. Gonzaga, Velasquez v. Congo, and CroCop v. Dos Santos.

Overall, a very good product that has tons of great fights of the price.

Flaws?  They missed some really big fights and replaced them with some questionable ones.  What about Franklin v. Silva?  Or Henderson v. Bisping?  Now its obvious why Dan Henderson isn't even mentioned in the Blu Ray - he is no longer under contract and Dana White is clearly one who likes to hold a grudge.  Second, it would have been nice to hear some of the post fight interviews.

Overall, still an excellent buy.  Even with the awkward interface, it is a great deal.",1268265600,18,1606,4.562937062937063
4047807,5,B0030Y11OC,I'm looking at the booklet with the Blu-Ray version as I want to know which fights & how many are Blu-Ray exclusives and I don't know! Does anyone know which ones aren't on the DVDs?,1268179200,,182,4.228571428571429
4047808,5,B0030Y11OC,"I eagerly wait for the release of this blu ray, it does not let me down. There is comprehensive introduction of all rising stars. The 2 disc are full of all exciting fights during 2009.

All UFC fans should get it.",1267056000,3,214,4.219512195121951

8386355,5,B0030Y11OC,"For the price of these things i'm not sure about why people complain. Personally, i enjoy watching the year in reviews and the ones that show the fights, sometimes these dvd's are all you need. Since you know there are over 160 events for sale. you might want to narrow it down. lol",1370476800,,282,4.339622641509434
8386356,4,B0030Y11OC,"I don't know who cobbles together these ""best ofs"" but they hit the money sometimes and miss it at other times.  Which is simply to say that some of these fights are to my liking and some don't live up to the hype or whatever for me.  The top contenders as far as entertaining fights here IMO are:

Condit v Ellenberger
Quarry v Credeur (love the heart in this one! alas, Credeur loses, but he reminds me of a middleweight Forrest Griffin)
Akiyama v Belcher (awesome!)
Sanchez v Guida (how did Guida get out of that first round!?!)
Penn v Florian (mad respect for Florian who never looked like he even had a chance against Penn)

Some of the fights that made me scratch my head as to what they meant as ""best of""?

Franklin v Belfort (yawn)
Silva v Griffin (an oddity to be sure; exciting when it happened but one of the best of 2009? hardly)
Diaz v Guillard (disappointing)

Split out between two discs the fights are interspersed (or interrupted by) with some overviews about divisions and the Ultimate Fighter and other fighter synopses.  These features put the main cards on these discs as a retrospective of 2009 instead of a ""best of""; at least that's how it felt.  And the navigation is clunky.  Actually, it kinda hurts (maybe that was the point? make us fight to get through some of this to what we really want?).  Still, you'll find some fights to your liking on this and I'm sure some that you want.  For the drooling fan it'll be a great add.  To the fan who wants more it will come up lacking.  But the flaws on this presentation drag it down I think.  3.75 stars.  I've seen better.",1359936000,,1596,4.399317406143345

8386358,4,B0030Y11OC,A lot of good Fights like condit vs ellenberger and guida vs sanchez which are insane fights!! And you get to see Silva clown Griffin haha. But they really shouldve had shogun vs machida on here. Still worth the money for all the fights,1342483200,,236,4.386363636363637

8386360,2,B0030Y11OC,"I may be a bit biased since I own every UFC event on dvd dating back to UFC 66 so I've seen all the fights time and time again. I feel what hurts these releases the most is the fact they are shown on spike for FREE on Unleashed,it really does nothing for me to watch the same fights again,the only original content is the commentary Mike Goldberg provides and never before seen pre-fight/post-fight interviews..overall,it's a poor release with very little reward,I'd avoid buying this.",1278806400,,485,4.7176470588235295
