8262004,4,B0016AU882,"I discovered this film completely by accident -- a happy accident, as it turned out, because it's a strong, honest story about aimless, disaffected youth struggling to make sense of their lives. Yes, it's not unlike ""Rebel Without a Cause"" -- except in this case, it's set in East Germany, specifically in pre-Wall East Berlin. While the settings & social background are different from American films, there's a familiar tone & viewpoint. The children of WWII don't quite know where they or the world is going -- we see East German parents worrying about the possibility of another war, this time a nuclear war -- and they make foolish, desperate choices.

Dieter simply wants to be left alone by politics of any kind, with his desires focused on motorcycles & the lovely Angela; Kohle wants to escape to the West, mainly to escape his physically abusive father; Karl-Heinz, despite coming from a well-to-do family, plunges into petty crime that soon escalates; and Angela despises her mother for sleeping with her immediate superior at work, even though its clearly a means of surviving both poverty & loneliness. There's a sympathetic police officer who genuinely wants to help them, but of course they reject any parental authority, having found too much of it to be hypocritical.

The film has a semi-documentary look, with more than a touch of noir as well -- German expressionism runs strong & deep, despite state censors -- and the atmosphere conveys both the yearning & creeping despair of its young leads vividly. Anyone who was ever young & wondering what life was supposed to be about will recognize & identify with these characters quite easily. Recommended!",1474156800,,1670,4.982078853046595
8262005,5,B0016AU882,"I used to live a block away from where the action takes place. ""It is a real slice of DDR-verit"" For my  ""Ostalgie"", there is a wonderful 27 year-old Ekkehard Schall whom I use to see assiduously in 1960-61 at the Berliner Ensemble playing Ui in Brecht's Der Auhalstame Aufstieg des Arturo Ui, a role I saw Pacino playing in NYC a few years ago.",1353542400,2,345,4.3076923076923075
