4999784,5,B006JY3OHW,"Cut scenes return, alternate openings provided, SUBTITLES available, and picture is as fine as can be provided from the 1976 epic. A booklet provides accuracy data & a genealogical tree that is a remarkable value for keeping the characters straight through the 78 year time period. The 35th Anniversary Edition is the set to own, by JOVE.

100s of reviews inform you of the content: An insatiable quest for power among Roman Emperor generations makes the story compelling. It's full of dastardly evolution. The Claudian Dynasty BBC spectacle filled with incest, base perversion and murder perpetrated within the royal family but presented with the historical humor of the 1930s Robert Graves novels. Augusta thru Nero, a plague of Roman Emperors, is a story supposedly told through the buried family story written by Claudius, exposing truth and sinister acts within the outlandish and intrigue filled generations. The film version includes the Graves' toga-talking slang, made a TV epic through the masterful writing of Jack Pulman. Through Roman period sexual twists (nudity, violence, and content warnings are correct throughout) viewers find humor in bizarre conduct, and jocular dialogue.

Aligning with stellar writing was casting. Derek Jacobi shines as perfect here as he did as Cadfael.  Augustus (Brian Blessed) & wife, Beautiful, evil Livia by Sian Phillips (Tinker, Taylor, Soldier, Spy), & her son Tiberius (George Baker -Ruth Rendell Mysteries). Add Claudius' mom, Antonia by Margaret Tyzack (Cousin Bette, Forsyte Saga). Caligula by John Hurt, Sejanus by Patrick Stewart (Star Trek), Nero by Christopher Biggins (Poldark), Narcissus (John Cater -Duchess of Duke Street), Ian Ogilvy (Upstairs, Downstairs) are a few more recognized. There is more.

SUBTITLED Episodes total 668 minutes, plus 104 more if you view the alternate episodes.

""I, Claudius"": A Television Epic -2002, 74 min behind the scenes

12 min Jacobi film interview from 2010
36 min Cast/Dir favorite scenes

The only fault I found was the close ups show the latex masks used for make-up technique typical of the 1970s period. But remember, quite advanced in 1976.
An epic that will never be out of style. And cut or reduced scenes are restored.
Even for previous owners, this may be worth a new purchase.",1328227200,265,2911,4.979423868312757
4999785,5,B006JY3OHW,"I have been a fan of this series since it was first on PBS and already I a copy of the first dvd release.  The only problem I had with that version was that the sound quality and there were no subtitles.
  To me, the series is still a must have and with the newer features the previous reviewer listed I will certainly preorder and can't wait.

 Updated review (07/26/13).  I just finished watching the first episode of this new I Claudius release...again, for the fourth time.
  I am extremely pleased with DVD set.  I first saw this series  while I was in high school back in the later seventies and after all these years it is still a joy to view.  So powerful even without all the modern day  technical advances.
Now thats a true sign of quality entertainment.

  I have to agree with one of the other reviewers that this is a great show to watch until Game of Thrones starts up again.",1326153600,4,889,4.303030303030303
4999786,5,B006JY3OHW,"""I, Tiberius claudius drusos nero germanicus who friends and...I'm about to write the strange history of my life""

 2011 is the 35th anniversary of the greatest historical accurate tv series ever made.
 I CLAUDIUS is a real masterpiece and is dedicated to all fanatic roman empire fans covering the history of the ancient roman empire from 24 BC the 7nth anniversary of the actium battle to the year 54 AD when nero ascended the throne as the last blood-related successor of augustus.
 This series is based in grave's novels I CLAUDIUS and CLAUDIUS THE GOD and many of the situations which are described in the series happened indeed as they are confirmed by suetonius among other historians of that age.
 The portraits of augustus, tiberius, young nero, aggrippina, agrippinilla, drusila, sejanus, macro, vipsania, marcus agrippa, livia, julia...etc...are presented in an excellent way. John hurt is THE REAL CALIGULA and derek jacobi is an excellent claudius.

 This new dvd set has the complete 13 episodes in 4 discs. disc 5 has all but one new special features which were unavailable until now.

 SPECIAL FEATURES:

 NEW : DOCUMENTARY : I CLAUDIUS: A TELEVISION EPIC. A LOOK BEHIND THE SCENES...74'
 DOCUMENTARY : THE EPIC THAT NEVER WAS...71'
 NEW : TWO EXTENDED EPISODES : EPISODE 1, 52' // EPISODE 2, 52'
 NEW : A NEW DEREC JACOBI 12' INTERVIEW
 NEW : ACTOR'S FAV SCENES...34'
 NEW : AN 8 PAGE BOOKLET : Fiction or reality ?

 All in all this is a must have. I wish the series would continue with prequels and sequels covering in the same way THE WHOLE THOUSAND YEARS OF THE UNITED EMPIRE FROM THE TIME OF THE PUNIC WARS UP TO LATE 9NTH CENTURY AD WHEN IT'S UNITY (What have remained after the disastrous events of the 5th - 7nth centuries) FINALLY BROKE UP.

 PS.

 Don't forget the new series remake which HBO undertook to create by next year...",1325721600,21,1855,4.7492163009404385

It was as good as we remembered it--fabulous acting, especially by Derek Jacobi and Sian Phillips, tremendous writing and a huge dramatic impact.

4999893,5,B006JY3OHW,"An absolute legend of television. This groundbreaking  godfather of BBC epics is still one of the best and most iconic series ever. All the acting is outstanding,due to it's cast of theatre legends. The writing is razor sharp and captivating. Outrageous, gruesome, even shocking. It's amazing this is 40 years old, being it fits in so well with contemporary television. In that context the series is presented in a classic,more Shakespearean production. Don't expect a huge budget and flashy special effects. Considering it's age, this DVD edition is nicely restored and doesn't look that bad, with occasional glaring especially during torch-lit scenes. None of this hurt my enjoyment of the material. This set also includes a bonus disc of insightful making of documentaries and a leaflet that has a helpful family tree of characters for quick reference and points out fact from fiction (although I think it is more accurate than it needed to be,but that is just another reason I loved it).If you like HBO's Rome, Game Of Thrones,or Spartacus etc. this is the series that set the template for them,or if you like Shakespeare's historical dramas you will surely be entertained.",1491177600,6,1177,5.098445595854923

4999968,5,B006JY3OHW,I was totally transformed back to 1976 when I first watched this excellent BBC production. In my mind the only thing that could have made it better would have been having Alistair Cooke introduce each episode. I had read many of the adverse reviews and was a little concerned but bought the 35th Anniversary edition anyway and thought it to be just as I had remembered it. Perhaps the people who wrote those negative reviews had poor equipment but mine played nearly flawlessly. I am thrilled to have this set in my library and if you enjoyed it way back then I'm sure you will also.,1446681600,,583,4.509433962264151

4999972,5,B006JY3OHW,"an incredible piece of historical work, written in modern and anecdotal English, and chock full of historical facts.  it IS a novel, and considering that much of the surviving evidence was originally written by satirists and writers who valued style over substance, it is hard to tell where facts end and salacious rumors begin.  Graves was a classical scholar and poet and had the immense task of trying to square the surviving sources with the historical facts, while at the same time weaving an interesting personal narrative for Claudius.  I can only say that he succeeded beyond belief.  He manages to make all the figures absolutely human, and although it is almost impossible to keep track of all the family relationships, I Claudius remains thoroughly understandable and riveting through all 468 pages.",1444176000,,810,5.113636363636363

Most of the action happens indoors. Claudius was the one who defeated Britain, but that fact is just barely mentioned as if it was a small thing. The focus of the film is on Julian family intrigues. I would say it lacks action.",1439942400,,394,4.410958904109589

John Hurt as Caligula is creepy and sick.  I think he really captured the essence of Caligula.  Wish I could give it another half star.",1439424000,,455,4.670886075949367

One thing I had forgotten was just how much humor there was in each episode.

Claudius, the stuttering emperor of Rome, learned a thing or two as a misfit child: (1) Children Should Be Seen and Not Heard and (2) Most if the Time They Shouldn't Even Be Seen.  He used these lessons well knowing full well his disadvantage over ""normal"" children as well as his family of royal blood.

I, Claudius is Rome at its height and downfall.  This is what television would be like.  Even though this was produced in the mid 1970s, this program holds its position in greatness well.",1426982400,2,695,4.476190476190476

The precarious existence of the first four Roman Emperors and those willing to gain power by any means necessary, including assassinating the emperor and anyone qualified to succeed him.  Based on the histories of Suetonius as retold by Robert Graves.  Proof that truth is far more strange, and in this case, more fascinating and more hideous than fiction.

It may sound a little vulgar to have a(n) historical *fiction* for a college course in history but it does engage the students and it did inspire me to do some fact-checking and learn more on my own.  Anyway, for that class I rented the videos, too.  I had seen them as a kid so I was familiar.  Though I have now watched the series 4 or 5 times I still get a great deal of enjoyment from it.  That is always a good indication of a quality work IMO.

I was absolutely astounded by his ability, as stated in the Lord's Prayer to, ""forgive those who trepass against us.""

5000080,5,B006JY3OHW,"All the superlatives have been used to describe this ground-breaking serial which brought the Claudius novels of author Robert Graves to life in such a way that it brought about a cultural resurgence of all things Roman in the entertainment industry in the mid-seventies. Possibly the greatest BBC series of all time, I, CLAUDIUS introduced the concept of the Roman Emperors as families embroiled in high-class and utterly captivating soap operas.

Its hard to believe it has been 35 years since this magnificent production first aired. Fortunately many of the key cast members are on hand to reminisce and recall their favourite scenes and stories related to the production. The extras included in this set is what really makes owning this set compulsory, though the quality of the original program is exceptional on its own. Chief among the extra features is the special TV documentary The Epic That Never Was, which tells the fascinating story of the first attempt to turn I, CLAUDIUS into a film back in the 30s. Charles Laughton was to star as Claudius, and the outtakes in which he appears are absolutely fascinating to watch. Apart from being a vivid reminder of Laughtons genius as an actor, the story of how the film ultimately came to be abandoned and subsequently gave rise to the curse of Claudius is every bit as compelling as the series itself.

If youve never sat down and actually watched I, CLAUDIUS in all its gory glory, then you must do so. There are a lot of naughty bits, as befits an accurate telling of the lives of the Emperors and their twisted behaviour, but its always tasteful, unlike, perhaps, some more recent attempts to dramatise ancient Rome on the small screen. Nonetheless, without I, CLAUDIUS as an illustrious pathfinder, all subsequent endeavours would be far less interesting, Im sure.

Chances are youve heard how great an achievement I, CLAUDIUS was. Its true. And it holds up today. If youve never seen it before, now is your chance. This beautifully-packaged 35th Anniversary Edition is just waiting for you. And if you're already a fan of the show, this is the edition to own.

Due to the age of these programs and the improved resolution that DVD provides, you may notice occasional flaws in the image and audio on the DVD presentation that could not be corrected.",1397433600,5,2310,4.855329949238579

5000087,5,B006JY3OHW,"Although this was made in 1976 it is still a good quality production. The DVD did warn of possible distortion with the picture and sound but I found no such problems. Obviously it is not as raunchy as 'Rome' but it has a quality that is ageless. The sets are very well put together and the acting is superb. Derek Jacobi is fabulous as Claudius, who has a stammer and a club foot, not to mention a nervous twitch. It must be challenging for an actor to keep that going through weeks and weeks of filming! It begins with him as an old man writing his family history, a true account with all the dirt and grit most would want kept secret. Sian Phillips did a super job as Livia, wife to Augustus Cesar and grandmother to Claudius.  A character we love to hate, she is always scheming and plotting along with a few murders to her name too! Being a part of the Imperial family was clearly a dangerous place!  It follows the reign of Augustus, Tiberius, Calligula , Claudius and finally Nero. Claudius in spite of his disabilities was by far the best of of the bunch being intellegent and level headed. Some of these rulers were insane!

My favorite is Brian Blessed as the Emperor Augustus, also his evil wife Livia, played with much gusto by Sin Phillips. Derek Jacobi stars, John Hurt is excellent as Caligula. His depiction of the man's insanity is most memorable. This perve who was convinced he was the god Jove in human form slept with all three of his sisters, taking one, Drusilla (Beth Morris) as his wife, a marriage that proved gruesomely fatal for her once she became pregnant.

There's almost a parade of villains in this fascinating story. Claudius' second wife, Messalina (Sheila White) is an absolute pig who boinks practically every nobleman in Rome. She manipulates her husband into setting her up in a separate palace so she and her lover can meet freely. Messalina also challenges the most famous prostitute in Rome to a contest to see how many men they can lay with with before wearing out. Messalina wins the duel. All these acts committed behind the back of her devotedly deluded Claudius.

Patrick Stewart, with a full head of gray curly hair, is Sejanus, another baddie, and a most dangerous one at that. The right hand man of Tiberius (George Baker), Sejanus sets himself up as the real power in Rome, with a guard of thousands backing him. Once Tiberius finally realizes his trust in Sejanus was a huge mistake, the fallen usurper's trial, conviction and execution are swift, even if the damage caused can't be undone.

So many die here from violent murder or by poison, especially when Livia's alive and pulling the strings. The remarkable thing is Claudius, severely crippled, spastic and with a speech impediment, survives them all and is ultimately proclaimed emperor by the Praetorian Guard after Caligula's stabbing death. His own family thought Claudius stupid, clumsy and useless, but he was the smartest of them all. In this fictional tale published by Robert Graves in 1929, Claudius spends years writing a history of his family that reveals every scandal, every skeleton in the closet, and exactly who was behind what unnatural death. These book-writing sequences set-up each chapter and the bits of narration help clarify what we've seen or are about to witness.

I, CLAUDIUS is one of the greatest miniseries of all time and is an absolute treat,

It seems to me that Acorn Media lavished more care and love on this series to make it presentable to DVD and high resolution TVs than the big studios do with current blockbuster hits. The color is vibrant, the audio is crisp and clear so that a few lines that I had always puzzled over in previous incarnations are now crystal clear, the subtitles are spot on - something the major studios can rarely if ever claim (honestly, do the major studios think that the only people who use subtitles are deaf as stones). This collection allowed me to see for the first time the richness of the costumes and the incredible details of the sets and props.

5000096,5,B006JY3OHW,"This set would be its own recommendation; ""I, Claudius"" is one of the great series in television history, with classic performances by virtually the entire cast, and superb writing by Jack Pullman and direction by Herbert Wise.  What makes this 2012 35th Anniversary edition extra special is the incredible technical clean-up of the original tapes.  I have long had the earlier DVD incarnation (a rather bulky box set), and the improvement in this newly restored version is remarkable.  All the old fuzziness is gone, and the colors really pop (not too much).  After so many disappointments with ""restored editions"" on DVD that are not much better than the original VHS tapes, it is refreshing to encounter such an improvement in a new edition of a classic.  This new set also includes a wonderful retrospective about making ""I, Claudius,"" featuring interviews with many of the original actors and much interesting background information.  For example, the fact that the actors were all floundering in the first few weeks of filming until Wise told them (Sian Phillips recounts) to play it like it was a ""Jewish family comedy.""  Brilliant!

If I had to find a fault with this series, it would be that the production values are rather primitive by todays standards; the same three or four sets do duty from start to finish and some of the ""re-dressing"" of the same set for different scenes is a bit obvious.  But this is quibbling, particularly in the face of magisterial performances by Derek Jacobi, Sian Phillips, Brian Blessed, George Baker and John Hurt.  Who cares about the sets when Sian Phillips is making Livia's evil so funny and compelling?

5000097,5,B006JY3OHW,"It is a luxury to have this outstanding BBC production in DVD. Derek Jacobi at his best and the same can be said of all the cast and crew. Rome's history from Augustus to Nero, jointly with the unforgettable character of Livia, makes this a series you cannot stop watching from the beginning to the end. I wish it had gone on and on.",1393027200,,333,4.21875
5000098,5,B006JY3OHW,"I watched this first on TV and fell in love with Derek Jacoby then. After that, I bought the book. And now I've bought the DVD and even though it's old and the sound and pictures are sometimes dicey, nothing can dim the actors in this series or the stories of ancient Rome with all its excesses and horrors.

5000099,5,B006JY3OHW,"While you can't say that ""I,Claudius"" follows Roman history to the letter, it is a great way to introduce yourself to Rome's ruling elites and their wayward characters. Well done and entertaining, there is no one on this earth that personifies Caligula more than John Hurt. And no character more endearing than Claudius.",1392595200,,320,5.056603773584905

If you appreciate Roman history and ""History as a Novel"" (Thank you, Norman Mailer) and want to view an excellent filming of such, go for it.
Caution: Roman high society customs regarding sex and violence were quite different from our norms and those customs are shown and alluded to.

5000101,5,B006JY3OHW,"I missed some of the episodes during the original run, so I was thrilled to have the opportunity to see the whole series. The Acorn restoration is very well done -- probably about as good as technically possible to upgrade a 40 year old TV show -- and presents well even when upgraded to HD. The performances are still as wonderful as I remember them, but it may be a commentary on today's standards that I didn't find the elements that were so shocking in the 70s to be so now. I've lived and worked in Italy and spent substantial time at the major Roman sites, and I find the series captures the spirit of the culture and times even if Livia probably didn't poison as many as the series portrays (and the circumstances of the death of Caligula's sister is fiction.) Still a great ride for anyone interested in the Romans, great acting, and the universal truths of human folly.",1392249600,,878,4.459627329192546
5000102,5,B006JY3OHW,"This is really the miniseries that started it all in terms of breaking barriers with its frank and explicit depictions of the violence, treachery and twisted sexuality of ancient Rome on prime time TV before The Sopranos, Rome and Boardwalk Empire spiced up HBO's Sunday schedule. And you didn't even need cable to watch it!

Still holds up. Leaving aside the threadbare BBC production values, this is a terrific condensation of Graves' landmark historical novels, crisply written and efficiently directed. You almost don't notice that it's virtually all talk and no action. It also spawned a new generation of actors from John Hurt as a truly vile and crazy Caligula before the Alien burst out of his chest to Patrick Stewart as a most serviceable villain well before his more heroic turns in Star Trek and X Men, not to overlook Derek Jacobi, so convincing here in the title role that it's still surprising to see him in later roles where he doesn't limp and stammer.

Must-see if not a must-have for anyone with an interest in TV history, or Roman history. The quality of the home video is about as good as could be expected given the age and production values.",1391904000,2,1164,4.757425742574258

I had copies of it from a rebroadcast back in the early 1990s, but the quality of the DVDs is, of course, far superior to VHS videotape. The acting is superior and the plot is full of familial loyalty and betrayal. Watch this for a younger John Hurt, almost over the top as Caligula, and Patrick Stewart--with hair! But the star of the series is obviously Derek Jacobi as Claudius. There is not a sub-par performance by any of the cast. If you get the chance, read the two books that this series is drawn from; you'll get an even better perspective on the era and the characters.",1391644800,,755,4.361702127659575

The memorable music leading into the program provoked a sense of excitement, and it still does.  This is arguably the best television ever offered and it has lost none of its impact over the years.  The quality doesn't meet today's standards but the DVD is very watchable, primarily because you become so engrossed in the content that the presentation becomes unimportant.  The only downside is that it is shown just as it was when first broadcast, including credits and with the theme music before and after each episode.

Sheila White (Messalina) is wickedly beautiful. The film production is a bit racier than the books. The books explain how Claudius used his hours of reading in the library to formulate the strategy that led to his victory in Brittania. I think the Claudians were history's most dysfunctional family. All of them benefit from murder plots against other family members. It is not surprising that Caligula and Nero were part of this dynasty (emphasis on ""nasty""). I was glued to the series when it aired on PBS. ""Dallas"" was mere ""Babes in Toyland"" compared to this.",1389052800,,723,5.033333333333333

However the 12 (or 13) part BBC television series with Derek Jacoby in the title role and Sian Phillips as Augustus' wife/widow, Livia, is one of television's finest moments.

The DVD is very watchable, the colors and details are excellent along with the sound track, very minor imperfection in a small number of dark scenes. The producers note this and they (the imperfections) do not in any way detract or subtract from the over all pleasure of this finely acted, written, directed and produced show.

For those who care, this show sort of starts where the HBO ""Rome"" series stops.
The Rome series followed two plot lines' one,(the Historical line)followed the lives of the royal families and the two,(a fictional account)the lives of the two ex-solders.

The show ""I' Claudius"" isn't as action oriented, but more about the personalities, egocentricities, and the ambitions of the Royal families and how He (Claudius) survived the machinations and the paranoia of his family and others.

Perfect subtitles for those who need them, all the extras are also subtitled.

(Trek followers note that Patric Stewart (a very early appearance) has a minor but important part, and shows his stage Thespian background in Shakespeare.

While it is clearly a work of fiction there were enough verifiable facts to take anyone with even a modicum of interest in history on a long but enjoyable journey.  The fact booklet and lineage charts were very handy and we referred to them during each episode to keep straight where each character fit in the big picture as well as in the current chapter.
The screenwriters did a very admirable job of taking the viewer on an intimate ride with the leaders of ancient Rome along with their failures and triumphs.
I highly recommend this show, but watcher beware as the story is graphic and provocative.  Hard to imagine this series passed the censorship of both Britain and the United States so many years ago.  Not a series for the very young.

there were some small issues with the sound levels and picture (due to age and transfer) but not enough to make it an unpleasant watch (check the other reviews as there may be inconsistencies in the dvd's production quality) and although it contains mature subject matter, i don't feel that it would be unsuitable for teens (there are no language issues and the nudity and violence is limited and not overblown)

I was pretty confused in the first hour, and had to go back and start over so that I could understand what was going on. I'm terrible with names and so all the Claudius/Augustus/Marcellus/etc/etc was a bit overwhelming. But on the second try I got it, and I just got increasingly hooked as the series progressed. The action is pretty much all talking, and some of the side characters are not standouts, and the production values are pretty low by modern standards, but the performances by the lead actors, the interplay between them and the writing are all just stupendous.

The acting is first rate. The sets are immaculate (maybe a little too clean). The scripts seem to be written with the idea of presenting Romans the way they actually were as opposed to the way a modern person would behave. There is great sympathy for the trials and tribulations of the elite at Rome. Unfortunately, there is so little data about how ordinary men, women, children, slaves, etc. lived that the focus is naturally on the elite of the elite. Hopefully, scholarship after the production has and will in future be able to unlock those secrets. Overall, I loved it. Nine out of ten. Worth every penny.",1349654400,,780,4.8283582089552235

5000201,5,B006JY3OHW,"I've been watching ""I, Claudius"" ever since it was first broadcast on PBS way back in 1977.  I loved it from the first moment of the first episode and I still love it.  In my opinion, it is the greatest television program ever originally broadcast in 420i resolution.  It also ages particularly well -- I have watched it often enough to very nearly have it entirely memorized, but I still enjoy it immensely.

This new release has an additional special feature to the Image DVD set I purchased previously, and it also includes the original two-hour Episode 1 as it was broadcast first by the BBC in 1976 (PBS split that first episode into two parts -- the American version is 13 episodes, the British only 12.  This set includes both versions).

The colors in this edition seem somewhat more vibrant, as if they were actually electronically enhanced.  This is pleasant, particularly during the snake-themed titles, because the colors were largely washed out both on the VHS and first DVD releases, but whatever process they used seems to have resulted in some artifacts, most noticeably a contrasting halo around some objects on the screen, particularly noticeable in Episode 1.

And there are, of course, many other image artifacts as well, an unavoidable result of this great performance having been produced natively on video tape instead of film way back in 1976.  Suffice it to say that video tape was not a very visually accurate or high resolution medium back then, and it shows.  Interestingly, the quality of the reproduction varies widely throughout the series and even within individual episodes, as if the copy they used as a master may have been in less than pristine condition.  The worst of these artifacts involves occasional (and it is infrequent and brief in duration, but I found it distracting) diagonal banding on some scenes.  The producers of this set are quite persistent in their warnings at the beginning of each disk about the uneven quality you should expect, but I thought it should have gone without saying -- I mean, these were made from 1976 video tapes and no better source ever existed for it.

(Hey, it's better than my DVD of Ralph Bellamy's and William Shatner's 1957 ""The Defenders,"" which was taken from a kinescope.)

This show, from the first broadcast until 2005 or so, was for my tastes the greatest television show of all time.  It was only finally surpassed by HBO's ""Rome,"" but if great theatrical acting relating a great story trumps modern and extremely high production values, it might just remain atop the whole heap to this day (although Rome was no slouch in the great acting/great story realm, either).",1342051200,12,2655,4.855875831485587

5000203,3,B006JY3OHW,"Good historical content although let's face it, it is a video production of a book, so poetic license was definitely infused into this production.  There was a disclaimer in the DVD that stated that there are some problems with the sound and picture quality when they transferred it to this format and they were right, especially with the sound.  It was either that or the sound editors for this production should all be fired.  The acting quality was variable from High School theatrics to excellent representations especially from Derek Jacobi, Sian Phillips and John Hurt but still overall entertaining.  I think the acting inconsistencies are primarily the fault of the Director.  This story was somewhat disjointed trying to figure out what happened to certain characters that seemed to fall off the map and how one was related, literally, to the other but that was part of the fun.  If it wasn't for the Genealogical chart included with this DVD set it would have been very hard to follow without going back, repeatedly, to watch and listened closely.

5000217,4,B006JY3OHW,"SINISTER MUSIC plays and a viper slithers across a Roman mosaic. It's the opening credits of ""I, Claudius,"" a historical series of the Roman Empire based on the novels by Robert Graves. Uneasy lays the Caesar who wears the laurel crown and everyone around him. Snakes are everywhere in this 1976 BBC production starring a young Derek Jacobi in his signature role as Claudius, John Hurt as nephew Caligula, and Sin Phillips as the remarkably evil Livia, Claudius' grandmother, and they are fascinating.

It was Emmy nominated for Outstanding Limited Series and Direction in a Drama Series for Herbert Wise; it won for Art Direction in a Drama Series. The series influenced modern filmmakers and has become a part of our own pop culture. David Chase modeled Tony Soprano's manipulative mother, Livia, after - guess who - Livia of ""I, Claudius."" And, like Tony, no one has a more miserable rise to power than Livia's son, Tiberius (George Baker). Ridley Scott references Claudius in ""Gladiator,"" when Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) cruelly persuades his sister to betray Maximus (Russell Crowe).

Originally presented in the U.S. on Masterpiece Theatre in an edited format, this 35th Anniversary Edition from Acorn Media is a treat. The film is uncut, providing an extra 10 minutes for a 98-minute combination of episodes one and two. More scenes never broadcast in America are scattered throughout. The new material shows more violence and nudity amidst the story of four Caesars of the Julio-Claudian dynasty: Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, and Claudius, who was followed by Nero (We get to meet him near the end of the series). Theirs is a history of murder, madness, adultery, betrayal, incest, child rape (it was considered bad luck to murder virgins), cannibalism, infanticide and patricide - a terrible part of Roman history, and definitely not standard TV viewing in the `70s.

It's nothing like HBO's ""Rome"" or ""Game of Thrones,"" but ""I, Claudius"" is powerful storytelling without overdoing graphic images or profanity. Suggestion is more than enough. A childhood illness leaves Claudius with a limp, partial deafness, and a palsy that makes him twitch and stammer. Ridiculed and reviled by his family, there's nothing wrong with his mind. Claudius exists as an inconvenient shadow, putting him in a position to observe the most private family secrets. History and law become his favorite subjects as he writes his hush-hush family history.

It's been years since the series has been available in a decent format for home viewing. Acorn posts a disclaimer on each disc: ""Due to the age of these programs and the improved resolution that DVD provides, you may notice occasional flaws in the image and audio on this DVD presentation that we were unable to correct."" The DVD picture is grainy and soft. Makeup and wigs used to age various characters look theatrical; however, complexions are lifelike, showing pores, stubble and freckles. Roman costuming and sets shine; we can see so much more than in earlier presentations. Aside from the memorable opening theme by Wilfred Josephs, the traditional TV mono soundtrack focuses on the sharp dialogue. It comes through clearly along with infrequent sound effects. The only thing I miss is Alistair Cooke's introductions and epilogues that brought in additional historical facts, making the culture become even more alive.

Aside from that, there are hours of extras to enjoy. ""`I, Claudius:' A Television Epic"" has interviews with series director Herbert Wise, writer Jack Pulman, Jacobi, Hurt, Phillips, Baker, and other members of the outstanding cast. Each one notes how hard it was to get started because the material was so controversial. Brian Blessed, who plays Augustus, says, ""In two weeks of rehearsal we were dreadful ... We were all right, but we just couldn't do it. So they got Jack Pullman in and he said, `I know just what you're going through ... I couldn't write it until I thought of the Mafia.'""

Phillips had a hard time playing the malevolent Livia; she wanted to find incentive for the character. ""I love the contrast of comedy and horror, which goes right through `Claudius,'"" Wise says in the feature. ""I told her, don't justify it - just BE evil!""

John Hurt, who puts Caligula through his paces in a magnificent performance, says, ""When I first read it, I couldn't believe the world could be led by a lunatic of this nature - and I passed on it."" Because the episodes were to be filmed in a fragmented timeline, Wise decided to have the cast party before shooting began. Hurt attended, met everyone, and feeling the ""electric atmosphere,"" changed his mind.

Like a few other films (""Angel Heart,"" ""The Poltergeist Trilogy,"" ""Apocalypse Now""), there was talk that the show was cursed; you'll hear about that in the ""Television Epic"" feature. But, the claim gets more backing in ""The Epic that Never Was,"" a bonus about a 1937 film adaptation that was to be directed by Alexander Korda, starring Charles Laughton, Dame Flora Robson and Merle Oberon. The 71-minute feature is slow-moving and portentous in the grand, B&W Old Hollywood Way, but there's meat to be had here.

Then there's a 12-minute interview with Derek Jacobi by American writer/producer Mark Olshaker in 2010, and a great, 36-minute ""favorite scenes"" discussion with Wise and the cast, best viewed after watching the episodes. An eight-page booklet by Jennifer Coggins compares ""Fact and Fiction in `I, Claudius,'"" along with a genealogical chart. Among other items, she points out that Graves got some of his material from Suetonius, more a notorious scandal monger than historian. ""That's something like getting a history of the 20th Century from the archives of the National Enquirer,"" my historian friend, Thomas Edsall says.

Thank goodness Graves did use other resources.

Still, there's no disputing ""I, Claudius"" keeps us on the edge of our seats - for multiple viewings. HBO has just announced that they're teaming with the BBC for a re-make. But that's a story for another time.",1335139200,68,6027,5.065524193548387
5000218,5,B006JY3OHW,"I Claudius and Claudius the God are the sort of books that I will reread occasionally , always finding something new in them. I was disappointed when I first read the books to learn that a movie version with Charles Laughton in the lead role had not been finished. At long last, on the fifth disc of this set, we get to see a good deal of what was filmed and hear the back story of that ill fated production. It seems to me that, if they had finished and released it, our movie history would be richer. Great movies frequently have difficult shoots.

The backstory provided for this production lets us know that all was not wine and roses here either. Yet within the limits imposed by budget and moral constraints (yes, moral constraints, a little nudity and breast fondling are nothing to what is clearly written in the books) pretty much everything of importance is here. This is not meant to be an epic saga of heroism on the battlefield but a story of a man who bends with every breeze yet maintains his own sense of proportion.

I would have liked to see the conquest of Britain, elephants, acrobats and all. Perhaps the new version, made by the producers of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rome-The-Complete-Series/dp/B0028RXXE8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rome: The Complete Series</a>&nbsp;will be able to provide more spectacle. I have every confidence that they will still focus on the characters, as they did in that epic.

There is enough material in Robert Graves novels for twenty series. One does not cancel out the other and I am happy to have all that is available of the first movie and this series for now. It will be watched more than once.",1334707200,17,1702,4.923344947735192
5000219,5,B006JY3OHW,"I'm shocked someone would give this classic one star! Now that acorn media and Amazon listened to their customers and added special features, interviews, and remastered it for DVD format, it's perfect! Perhaps the other reviewer also doesn't like the other classic BBC and PBS productions. No accounting for taste, I guess!",1334016000,14,323,5.230769230769231
5000220,5,B006JY3OHW,"I had great memories of seeing ""I, Claudius"" when it premiered 35 years ago, but it was with some trepidation that I ordered the newly released version. Sometimes a work doesn't live up to the memories, especially with the improvement in filming techniques since the 1970s.

I needn't have worried. ""I, Claudius"" is still gripping entertainment, sometimes tragic, sometimes humorous and always interesting. Yes, it does come across more like a stage play than a movie, and if it were done now it probably would be closer to HBO's ""Rome"" series, with more sex and gore. But you don't need to see everything to know what's going on. The empress Livia is still manipulative and an ""evil woman,"" to quote Claudius as he looks back on his life. Augustus, seen toward the latter part of his reign, is as crafty as ever, but still no match for his wife in that regard.

Claudius, seen as a fool by most of his family because of his physical disabilities, is smart enough to survive, and become emperor, by playing the fool and not being seen as competition to Caligula and others. Since the imperial family had a habit of doing away with those who threatened them, this was an important skill.

This version also has a disc with more than three hours of extra features, including the making of the series, an interview with star Derek Jacobi and favorite scenes of the cast and director.",1333324800,61,1380,4.670781893004115
5000221,4,B006JY3OHW,"Still enjoyable.  Some of the production values are a bit dated, but overall still entertaining.  Worth watching at least once.",1333238400,10,127,5.3
5000222,5,B006JY3OHW,"A classic TV series returns to DVD using the original BBC videotape for the first time, ""I, Claudius"" was a game changer for both the BBC and PBS when it first aired in 1976.

Acorn has gone back to the original BBC tapes for the series (the previous version used the U.S. copy as I recall)which means that the slightly longer first two episodes are restored to their original length. This means they are about 10 minutes longer than originally.

We get a new 75 minute documentary along with an interview with Derek Jacobi where he briefly discusses his career as well as a ""highlights"" reel of the casts favorite scenes.

We also get the classic documentary ""The Epic That Never Was"" hosted by the late Dirk Bogar that provides background on the 1939 Alexander Korda version that was never completed. The budget, issues between the director and cast made the production troubled from the very beginning. Korda used Merle Oberon's car accident at the time as an excuse to cancel the production.

There's also a short booklet that provides a comparison between fact and fiction as well as a family tree to help you keep track of the characters.

Keep in mind that this is about as good as the series will ever look--it was shot on standard definition videotape over 35 years ago. ""I, Claudius"" is about the content--the acting, direction and writing rather than the look of the dvd or action sequences.

Acorn includes the extended original episodes 1 and 2 and wonderful special features, e.g. THE EPIC THAT NEVER WAS, introduced by the superb British actor Dirk Bogarde plus other extras, such as the Derek Jacobi interview, an 8-page booklet, etc.

8499871,5,B006JY3OHW,"If you like to watch certain favorites from time to time and do not want to rely on streaming services which may delete titles on a whim, you may want a home entertainment library. I am gradually replacing my VHS favorites with DVDs. This format should be accessible for many years to come. But there are two caveats. First, some leaps in technology cause some loss of quality. For example, high definition may make the make up of past decades look a little obvious. Be prepared to adjust your settings on your TV to soften the picture or simply adjust your expectations in order to fall into the fantasy world on screen. Second, if you really like or need the closed captions (as I do) and wonder why newer DVDs do not show captions even though they are advertised as having them, it is because your DVD player is attached to your TV with an HDMI cable. HDMI can handle the newer subtitling system, but not the older closed captions. If you have a DVD player that attaches to your TV with the three prong-like RCA cables (red, yellow and white), the captions will be there. If you know your favorites well enough, you may not need the captions as much as you think because you will remember a lot of dialog as you watch the scenes.

In this version of I, Claudius there is an advisory at the start of each disc reminding you that some changes in technology created quality loss that cannot be compensated for, and by this they mean that the make up sometimes looks a bit heavy. So what? This is one of the best productions in the history of television. The bonus features are not to be missed by the real fan: details about casting, direction of certain scenes, sets, acting techniques, make up regimen and more. Thank goodness the bonus features were made before more of the people involved had died. I am very happy with this purchase.",1520553600,2,1838,4.486567164179104
