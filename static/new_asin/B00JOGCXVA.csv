8652599,5,B00JOGCXVA,"Another teen myth fantasy based on a book series. Percy Jackson, is a special teen like Harry Potter, living among mortals not knowing his special powers. Percy then goes to Hogwarts, or Half-Blood Camp for special training. He disobeys the school master to go on a quest with his two friends, which I am surprised are not named Ron and Hermione. Unlike Harry Potter, this movie is a dummy down tale for younger kids. Also most of the action takes place outside of ""Hogwarts."" On their quest they encounter 3 scenes from Greek mythology. The special effects were good, acting was above average, and AnnaBeth was hotter than Hermione. The movie could be a great way to introduce kids to Greek mythology.",1445558400,,702,4.762295081967213
