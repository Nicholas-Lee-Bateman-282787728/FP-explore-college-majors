7934648,5,B000059XZZ,"This is the best film adaptation yet of Leo Tolstoy's classic novel, Anna Karenina.  I enjoyed it so much I was convinced it was time to read the book.
The strongest aspect of the film is the casting.  Helen McCrory's Anna is a rose in full bloom. She is a passionate, red-blooded woman whose steps toward liberation inadvertantly lead onto the tracks. I believed every moment of her performance, and loved the lusciousness she brought to the role. She is no china doll, easily broken, but a woman whose power lies in her resoluteness. ""She was magnificent,"" Constantine says of her to the unconsalable Vronsky at the end of the film. Her tragedy is all the greater because we can see her magnificence. Nothing smaller than a steam engine would be able to destroy the magnificent Anna.
Kevin McKidd as Vronsky is compelling and the most memorable aspect of the film. He is not a weak, vain, or insensitive Vronsky. Unlike other Vronsky's who only seem like plot devices to Anna's tragedy, his Vronsky is almost more tragic than Anna herself. I believe his love for her, his desire to marry her, and his growing frustration that she will not believe or accept his love. He even looks Russian, fair and slightly goggle-eyed, breathtakingly at home in regimental uniforms. Any woman who has ever loved a man in uniform will recognize him immediately, and wish they knew someone with even half his loyalty, heart, and dignity.
I was originally drawn to the production by the actor who is cast as Konstantin, the gruff and merry Douglas Henshall. His Konstantin is not morose and affected, but a sensualist, awkward in polite company, and pure in heart. His adoration for Kitty (played by the lovely Paoloma Baeza, who has appeared in other Masterpiece Theatre productions) is moving and sweet.  He adds a much-needed sense of humor to the film.
The moral and inflexible Karenin is played by Stephen Dillane in a brilliant piece of casting. He is portrayed as a decent man, not a monster.  Most films of Anna Karenina portray Karenin as a wife beater.  Stephen Dillane makes Karenin a sympathetic character.  He is not a passionate man, Anna did not marry for love, yet he loves her in his own loyal way, and there is a sense of his waiting in the wings for her eventual return.
This Masterpiece Theatre presentation of Anna Karenina is a brilliant production of a much-adapted novel. A little lengthy in pieces, (and a little bit Anglo in presentation ... this is definitely Anna Karenina a la Victoria) but luscious in its attention to detail and in its portrayal of the complexity of the situations and the characters. One of the better recent Masterpiece Theatre productions, along with Oliver Twist, The Buccanneers, and The Way We Live Now.",1030492800,8,2741,4.784355179704017

It is sublime, it is divine and it is divinely human . The fictional landscape is strewn with stories of love gone sour but nothing even touches the hem of this masterpiece ...Madame Bovary is tawdry and tame in comparison .Shakespeare would have been proud of it! Thus , when one sits down to watch a cinematic adaptation of ""Anna Karenina"" the expectations are bound to be very high . This masterpiece theater production is credible but I'm afraid leaves a lot to be desired. Had I seen only this film version without having read the novel , I would have come away with a very mediocre opinion of the novel and would probably not even have felt compelled to read it . To do justice to ""Anna"" you have to have atleast a miniseries (4 hours just don't cut it ! ) .I have seen adaptations of Madame Bovary and they come out well in 2 hours but not ""Anna Karenina""_____""Anna"" is much more than a love story , it is a tableau of an entire civilization in  its grime and glory  that only a  supreme master like Tolstoy could portray with such breathtaking vivid detail .Specifically , the character of Vronsky and Levin in this movie are rather two dimensional with none of the subtlety or nuance that Tolstoy imbued them with .Moreover the actress who plays Anna is downright ugly (she resembles some dowdy washerwoman !) with none of the ineffable ambivalence of Anna Karenina .Tolstoy paints her husband (Karenin) as a cold, dessicated, self-righteous bureaucrat but again it's missing from this movie .Tolstoy almost makes you ""feel"" the vastness of the Russian steppes in the novel ,makes you almost smell the hay at harvest time , makes you almost ""touch"" the muzhiks on Levin's farm but all that is missing from this version. Normally I would have given this film 3 stars but the only reason I give it 4 stars is because of the sheer magnitude of the challege any director faces when adapting  a masterpiece like ""Anna Karenina "" .Only someone like a David Lean (Doctor Zhivago) could have done justice to Anna .",983145600,6,2241,4.496314496314496
