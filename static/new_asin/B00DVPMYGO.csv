8598379,4,B00DVPMYGO,"The story is great.  A twice-divorced woman comes back to her home town with her tail somewhat between her legs.  She can't understand why a woman can't be as free as a man to love and experience life.  This being the 50's, good luck.  Her mother cares for her when she does the RIGHT THING.  She meet two men from her past, a college professor/author who wants her in a free love way and a local businessman who truly loves her.  Though she cares for both she doesn't love either.  She settles for the businessman when she realizes the author just wants her to be his courtesan (his word).  She still has trouble because her fianc's mother is the battleaxe mother-in-law of all time.  This devouring dragon wants her son all to herself.  She has run off all his possible girlfriends and goes after Hilda with all guns blazing.  If this old warhorse could legally marry her own son herself she would in no time flat.  That alone is worth watching the movie.  The quality of the 20th-Century Fox Cinema Archives DVD-R release is pretty good quality except for one thing.  The movie is supposed to be Cinemascope but when viewing it has black borders all around.  Postage stamp theater.  Other than that recommended for fans of 50's soap-opera type films.",1436659200,4,1253,4.601809954751131

8598382,3,B00DVPMYGO,"A very well done soap opera with an excellent job by Jean Simmons,  a great underrated actress. Her character is a twice divorced woman that comes back home, a college town, where she finds a lot of gossip and a mother who never really loved her. Hilda is a very liberated character for the period. A love triangle and complications follow. I enjoyed this movie very much.",1403049600,,372,4.552238805970149

8598384,5,B00DVPMYGO,"Jean Simmons is the reason to get this DVD. She is a great great actress, worthy of many Academy Awards.

Hilda is a femminist film, like Jane Russell in The Revolt of Mamie Stover. Hilda defies conventioal standards and the commuunity she lives in will try to stop her. Jean Simmons is electrifying in the part and the rest of the cast tends to follow her standard which is very high.

Lots of great character actors and actresses add to the drama. Evelyn Varden for one is superb as always. Who can forget her in ""Desiree"" with Jean Simmons and Marlon Brando. Brando is Napoleon and Varden is Jean's mother, begging Brando(Napoleon) to watch out for her son..moving scene with two incongruous people chewing up the scenery. ( Buy Desiree for this and other fabulous scenes.)

The DVD format here is poor. 20th Century Fox has forgotten that they introduced CinemaScope and Jean Simmons was in the first one shot in that format,namely, The Robe.

This should be recalled and redone. There's no excuse at all.  Hilda Crane is excellent and deserves the very best treatment.",1381190400,10,1073,4.747311827956989
8598385,1,B00DVPMYGO,"My one-star rating has NOTHING to do with performance, scripts, direction, etc.  It has to do with the very poor quality of the movie's transfer to dvd.  The DVD is not formatted for wide-screen TVs so, this CinemaScope movie has black bars on the right and left sides of the screen, thus the picture is very small on the TV.  You have to blow up the picture thru the TV to increase the size of the movie and that, of course, distorts the picture quality.  The print of the movie is not good either: colors are washed out and the picture is fuzzy.  I have purchased one other DVD from the 20th Century Fox Cinema Archive (MEET ME AFTER THE SHOW) and although this movie is a standard 4x3 screen ratio,  I have the same complaint....VERY poor transfer to DVD.

The MOD DVD-R option from Warner Bros, MGM/UA, Columbia/Sony and Universal have been a great way for Classic Film fans to own their favorite classic films on DVD.  The movies I've purchased from these Studios offer decent and in some cases high quality transfers.  I fear 20th Century Fox Cinema Archive are releasing their MOD DVDs with a total disregard for their customers and for the films in their catalog.",1378684800,16,1171,4.538095238095238
8598386,4,B00DVPMYGO,"The ever-reliable and often underrated Jean Simmons (who never won an Oscar, though was often the most deserving actress of the year in the '50's and early '60's) shines in this multi-layered drama of a complex woman struggling to find meaning and happiness.
  Returning to her home town from New York as a successful career woman with two failed marriages (a scandalous talking point in that era), Hilda falls for Russell Burns (Guy Madison), who runs a construction company but is under the thumb of the compellingly monstrous Evelyn Varden as his mother (reprising her Broadway performance). A scene-stealing character actress (see her work in NIGHT OF THE HUNTER and THE BAD SEED), Evelyn has a great scene with Jean Simmons in which the two ""face off"" in a near-operatic manner over the impending nuptials. Terrific Phillip Dunne dialogue in this pivotal scene makes it the highpoint of an intelligently written screenplay.
  Judith Evelyn gives another fine supporting performance as Hilda's depressed mother (she was also memorable as Liz Taylor's mother in GIANT and as 'Miss Lonelyhearts' in REAR WINDOW.) Her role was originated by Beulah Bondhi on Broadway while Jessica Tandy portrayed Hilda in the 70-performance run in late 1950. Like many stage plays (egs. JEZEBEL and EVERYONE COMES TO RICK'S (aka CASABLANCA)),this Samson Raphaelson drama may have seen improvement in its transition to the (CinemaScope) screen.(Mr Raphaelson also authored the much-filmed play THE JAZZ SINGER)
  The highly talented David Raksin (LAURA, THE BAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL) contributes another fine score, recently made available on CD by Intrada (with the Hugo Friedhofer score for THE REVOLT OF MAMIE STOVER, another '50's drama from Fox with a scandal-prone, independent woman seeking a better life).
  It is a relief to know that the skilled wide screen cinematography of Joseph MacDonald (who also photographed BIGGER THAN LIFE and THE SAND PEBBLES) is preserved on the Cinema Archives release (few other CinemaScope movies survive in their correct aspect ratio in this generally disappointing attempt by Fox to emulate Warner Archive).It is -thankfully- a 2.35 to 1, Letterbox (ie. non-anamorphic) transfer in stereophonic sound-a real plus!
  In short, a well acted and scripted '50's drama which can-arguably- take it's place somewhere near the best of Douglas Sirk's achievements (think ALL THAT HEAVEN ALLOWS). A must for fans of the considerable talents of Jean Simmons, who brought intelligence and veracity to any role she portrayed, well-written or otherwise.",1375574400,4,2564,5.3399503722084365
