8390941,5,B00380JBQI,"Lovely movie, It is like supersize me, with the host, test subject going from a vegan diet to a raw food diet for 30 days and describing the experience, as well as documenting it on film. It is not as good as Supersize me, but it is more designed for educational value, rather than entertainment value.

The movie ends with the test subject, Mike Fields, at the 30-day point, where he has noticed many changes in his body. But, we need to hear from him after 3 or 6 months, when his mind, his friendships and his world view are altered by the diet. That is one flaw with the movie.
I guess we get that from his interview subjects, who are confident in the raw food diet, while Mike Fields is our absent referent? Someone in an action film who we experience whatever the protaganist is going through through the character on the screen. So, in this case, we end the film going through his journey with doubts instead of letting him get into the diet enough to be a genuine believer.",1377820800,,981,4.360655737704918
