8534213,4,B0091JJ23C,"A fine video & audio recording of one of their reunion shows at Cat's Cradle. Since it's one of it's kind, it's hard for a fan to not pass this up - either as a completist or someone who missed out on the amazingness that is/was Archers of Loaf.  For what it's supposed to be - it's an immersive watch start to finish and the band member interviews are relevant to the their history as a band and their music.

The two knit-picks here would be not getting to see the show in it's entirety sans interviews and perhaps the lack of inclusion of other concert footage as a hard copy from past shows (but YouTube has 'em)",1425340800,,616,4.211864406779661
8534214,5,B0091JJ23C,"After being lucky enough to catch their reunion tour in Seattle, I was excited to find that they captured a few shows from the tour for a DVD release.  It's a great reminder of one of the best concerts I've ever attended, as the set list is very close and these shows were recorded just a few weeks prior to the Seattle show.  I was also lucky enough to see the Loaf a number of times in the 90's and can honestly say that the reunion shows (and this DVD) capture the band at the top of their game musically.  Maybe the youthful energy isn't quite the same, although Matt Gentling still goes nuts on the bass, but the maturity of the group really shows in their playing.  Years of solo touring have improved Eric Bachmann's voice since his days in Archers of Loaf and this experience is demonstrated by his knowing when to back off from a note or a line and sing a slightly modified part.  This was something that he didn't always do in the latter days of the band, when his voice had changed quite a bit from the Icky Mettle period and he wasn't able to hit all of the notes from his younger days.  I highly recommend this DVD to any fan of the band or even any fan of indie music.  The short interviews between sections also give a bit of insight into the ""old days"" and provide a rare chance to see the members in an actual interview.",1405900800,,1337,4.19921875
8534215,5,B0091JJ23C,"Do you like Archers of Loaf?  Then you should own this film.  Do you not like Archers of Loaf?  Then how did you find this?  It must be divine intervention and you are predestined to purchase this film and rethink your musical tastes, and possibly life in general.  There's nothing to complain about here.  It's a great snapshot of the greatest indie rock band of all time.  Get it. Now.",1388188800,3,387,4.442857142857143
8534216,5,B0091JJ23C,great show and fun interviews by top band of the 1990s. thanks for reuniting. if they tour again they are a must see.,1366848000,2,117,4.130434782608695
8534217,5,B0091JJ23C,"I was pretty damned sure that I was the greatest Archers of Loaf fan of all time, considering that ever since I first recorded Last Word and All Hail the Black Market being played back to back on an indie rock radio station in Boston, I pretty much eat, shit, and breathe everything Eric Bachmann releases.

When I was still living at home, I would have private concerts in my bedroom, where I would sing along to my favorite AOL songs at the top of my lungs to no one but my mother who would pace outside my closed door, ready to punch a wall.  I have been to so many AOL shows that all four members of the band recognize my face when they see me and greet me by name.  I have countless signed records and CD's, rare t-shirts, pictures of me with the band.  I could honestly say that when it comes to Archers of Loaf, I was the man and it filled me with enormous pride and tremendous ego to wear the crown of ""Greatest Fan""  It did, that is... until I met the director of this film, Gorman Bechard who undeniably stripped me of my prized championship.  Anything that I can boast of, Gorman has it checked off on his own list.  In addition, he also had the ugly kid sketch you see on the cover of the DVD, which Matt Gentling drew, tattooed on his left arm.... and fueled by his own love for this band, set out to film this wonderful documentary.

I have been waiting quite some time to see What Did You Expect and it was well worth the wait!  While watching this film, I sang along, drank merrily, and threw my arms around my lady, planting kisses on her cheek, smiling like a deranged fool.  This movie gives you the feeling of being there live, witnessing an actual Archers of Loaf show.  If you love this band, this movie will pump you up.  Most of the film is footage of the band playing at the famed Cat's Cradle in Chapel Hill, North Carolina where the Archers cut their teeth.  In between songs, there are brief snippets of interviews Gorman conducted with the members of the band.

My only criticism that I could offer is that I wish the interview footage was a bit longer.  I was looking forward to hearing more ""Incriminating Hawk"" stories like Eric Bachmann told on the Crooked Fingers  Forfeit/Fortune DVD .  ""You know, the green dude, who bust out his shorts!""  haha!  But aside from that, this film is great!  I can honestly say that I'm glad I'm no longer the Archers of Loaf champion.  I am glad that there was a Gorman Bechard out there to knock me off my pedestal, because he has truly given we the people of AOL nation a gift that we can all treasure forever.  This is what you set out to do Gorman and you did it!!!  Thank you!

Yrs truly,
James LaCroix",1349222400,7,2674,4.259920634920635
