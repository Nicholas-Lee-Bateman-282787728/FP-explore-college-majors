8676468,5,B00N78HF96,"Loved this Christmas show.  A little slow on the the uptake but grew on you until you became totally absorbed.  It is very different than most Christmas shows.  Songs are traditional but presented with what I viewed as an ""Irish lilt"" to its peaceful presentation.",1487808000,,264,4.822222222222222
8676469,5,B00N78HF96,Trace Adkins is the complete package in an artist. His voice sends goose bumps and tingles down my back. I could listen to him sing and or talk for hours. Christmas Show was a present to myself and I am glad I bought it.,1484352000,,220,4.0227272727272725
