8021023,3,B00023B0PY,"I originally thought this was intended to be an ""artsy"" film with the constant cut backs between the battlefield and an opera performance in Hanoi, but it could also be that the director (who apparently was at Dien Bien Phu) was also trying to show the disassociation between the people living in the cities and the soldiers in the battlefield.  (Perhaps that is also the reason for the subplot  of the ""betting"" on the outcome of the battle which I did think worked as well.)  In a very real sense, this a ""personal film"" of the director.

The big downside is that you have to be fairly proficient at spoken French as there are no subtitles.  But as an overall well told and compelling story of what is asked of soldiers...of any country...this is really an ""anti"" war film well worth watching--which one can appreciate even without subtitles.",1472169600,,844,4.675675675675675

8021028,3,B00023B0PY,"Much of the movie follows conversations in bars and offices.  I noticed only one individual taking a hit in the battle sequences.  However many were shown, they were few in number and indicate an unusual desire not to show soldiers actually being shot.  There were no subtitles but since the movie is French it comes as no surprise.  All in all it's OK.",1380931200,,353,4.555555555555555
8021029,4,B00023B0PY,"I'm a student of all things history, and for some reason, I just find the French war with Indochina to be quite interesting. I can't say if it's because this was the end of European colonialism, or that a professional European army was effectively destroyed as a fighting force by peasant farmers. How in the world the U.S. didn't learn from what the French went through in Indochina is beyond me, and this movie covers this struggle beautifully.

I have to admit being an American, that I'm biased toward the French point of view. I respect the Viet Minh very much for what they accomplished, but I have just always loved European history, and the French are very much a part of that history. Dien Bien Phu does a wonder of showing viewers just what the end of French occupation must have been like. The scenes are beautiful and sharp, and the French troops are amazing portrayed by these actors. My only gripe with the film is that I can't understand a damn thing they're saying! Where's the subtitles? However, where else do you find something like this? This is awesome for what it is, a great movie depicting a struggle to keep the old colonial system in tact, and the people trying to break that hold.

If you find anything about the French Indochina War interesting, you MUST check this out! I youtubed it and watched it that way. There are no English subtitles, but just listen to the music and enjoy the sights and scenes from the film! Vive l'arme Franoise!",1368144000,3,1467,4.574144486692015
