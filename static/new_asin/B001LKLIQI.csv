3685001,5,B001LKLIQI,"This video is a great introduction to a variety of math concepts as well as stretches and calisthenics.  Both my 4-year-old and my 8-year-old enjoy the program from start to finish.  The music is upbeat and the production quality is excellent. The video gives explanations and examples, and includes graphics for every concept presented. This video is a great antidote for passive glued-to-the tube ""learn while you watch"" DVDs.",1235520000,4,428,5.188405797101449
3685002,5,B001LKLIQI,From the one word title of Gymathtics this DVD had me smiling.  I did it with my 3 & 1/2 year old not expecting her to really follow it let alone give it more than 5 minutes of her attention.  Instead we did it together and lasted the entire video!  I actually wish it went longer just to see how long it would have held her attention for.  I would STRONGLY recommend this for anyone who has a child over the age of 3.  This makes a great gift for yourself or any parent of school-aged children :),1235433600,4,497,4.030612244897959
3685003,5,B001LKLIQI,"This DVD was exactly what we were looking for. We have children 3,5,7 & 9. The older two struggle with mathematics, as I did when I was in Elementary School. When we put in the DVD, we were amazed at how quickly all four of them jumped to their feet and started the math workout routine along with the kids on the DVD.

By getting them up and moving instead of just sitting down and going over the material and being bored to tears, our kids are learning math and loving it. (Not to mention the fact that they are getting a good workout.)

Sure, it wasn't the way I learned it as a kid, but as long as they learn it, that's all that matters.",1235347200,6,641,4.079365079365079
3685004,4,B001LKLIQI,"I have been looking for a couple good fitness DVD's to add to our library to have on hand to make sure the kids are getting some physical activity several days a week.  We try to do one before breakfast on school days.  They also spend some time outdoors most days in the afternoon if the weather is decent.  I especially was looking for videos that will help them to stretch their muscles out.

I think this would be good for elementary ages.  Even though it includes a teenage boy and girl, I would not recommend it for teens.  They will hate it.

I don't think this necessariy should have won all the awards listed above, however, I am glad I bought it for my kids.  I think it will be a good addition to our fitness routine, though I wouldn't do it everyday.

There are some things about this DVD that I (and my kids) liked:
+ a good mix of older and younger kids who are kind and encouraging to each other
+ was a good length- not too strenuous but short enough to keep kids from getting bored
+ reviewed math subjects such as skip counting, angles, shapes, etc... which they show on a simple blue split screen next to the fitness dvd
+ it's easy to skip to the section you want to do and skip over the ones you don't want to do
+ it is an easy way to make sure your kids are getting some physical activity everyday, especially if the weather is bad outside
+ the last (cool down) section also offers some health & wellness tips.  Sometimes it is good for kids to hear it from someone who is NOT their parent

Here are a couple things I (and my kids)did not like about this DVD:
+ it really was obviously pretty low budget
+ it got really annoying how the adult kept saying phrases like ""Don't you just love exercize?"" and ""High five!""  My kids rolled their eyes everytime she said this

I think this is especially an occasional, fun, educational DVD. I would like to have seen it made a little better but kudos for them for making something that has kids exercising- and has won several awards.

I also recommend the Junior Yoga DVD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Junior-Yoga-by-Annette-Lefterow-NTSC/dp/B00119Y3Q6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Junior Yoga by Annette Lefterow (NTSC)</a>.",1299196800,3,2235,4.6395939086294415
3685005,4,B001LKLIQI,"We got this video for our five year old. He really likes it (it's a bit too advanced for our three year old). It's great that it incorporates math. However, at times I wish they would go a little slower through the math concepts. Also, this DVD works great on our blu-ray player but for some reason it will not play on our other DVD player. Overall, I would definitely recommend this video.",1296345600,,390,4.3561643835616435
3685006,4,B001LKLIQI,"My kids (ages 6 & 7) have so much fun with this DVD. They don't even realize the math skills they are learning. It's a great way to get some activity in when we are stuck indoors. As their mom, I enjoy watching them, too, and sometimes join in.",1282694400,,244,4.0
3685007,5,B001LKLIQI,"I purchased this DVD after watching a demonstration at our local Barnes and Nobles a few months back. My son (almost 7) and daughter (almost 4) both loved the video in the store and continue to love it at home. As a pediatric Speech-Language Pathologist I thought that the language and concepts were age appropriate for the target audience yet quite beneficial for my kids ages. Anything that is motivating while being educational, fun and promotes the healthy habit of exercise, is good in my book! I highly recommend Gymathtics...especially after trying several other kids ""educational"" exercise videos!",1261440000,,605,5.183673469387755
3685008,2,B001LKLIQI,"While I loved the concept of this it was disapointing. It looked and felt like someone made this at home, with oddly filmed
angles and awkward interactions. Ms. Carrie's voice drove me insane! Her poorly executed faked enthusiam actually inspired anger in me bc I can't believe anyone thought she sounded motivating or even fun. I can handle fake enthusiasm as that's expected with practically any exercise DVD, but this made me feel borderline suicidal. I gave it two stars instead of one bc it is a good concept and bc if your kid will do it then some exercise is better than none. Just really poorly executed in my opinion.",1260835200,4,626,4.648648648648648
3685009,5,B001LKLIQI,"This is a wonderful way for children to learn maths without even realizing it.  It is similar to when young children are introduced to a new language, they learn it as they play and interact with other children and adults.  Ms Carrie is very good as an instructor, because she is more like a friendly mom.  She makes it an informal learning and fun environment.  I was talking to my neighbor who used this tape with her five year old.  She said the same, the only thing, she said, was that, if the child is a bit younger (as with her son), you would want to speak a little slower.  For older ones, it shouldn't be a problem.
Keep up the good work, hope to see more products from Exploracise.",1251417600,,691,4.276923076923077

3685011,5,B001LKLIQI,"Wow - what a great concept - math and exercise together!  My kids loved the exercise and found the math concepts to get fun.  They are in 2nd and 4th grade and the video was appropriate and interesting for both of them.  As a mom, I loved that the kids and I could work out together.  What a wonderful product - I would recommend it to anyone at any age.",1237420800,,354,4.014285714285714
3685012,5,B001LKLIQI,"What a creative way to intergrate math with exercise in such a fun format.  My son loves this workout and he doesn't even realize all the math concepts he's learning while doing it.  I saw so many great benefits with my son using this dvd that I shared it with my son's 3rd grade class to try on those rainy days when the kids can't go out and exercise.  As the schools continue to cut physical education from the curriculm, I feel it is my responsibilty to step up as a parent and make sure he is introduced to a variety of healthy concepts for life.  Thank you so much for developing such a creative show.",1236297600,2,607,4.206896551724138

8318392,2,B001LKLIQI,"Maybe if you live in Alaska where things are really boring, this DVD would be fun. Too bad, because you can tell this family really tried. The exercise part of it is great, and even fun. But the math chanting is only chanting, and meaningless really. Kinda ruins it.",1393804800,,266,4.448979591836735
8318393,1,B001LKLIQI,"I am surprised that so many people wrote such positive reviews of this video. I could probably find something similar at the dollar store. My kids were immediately put off by the forced enthusiasm. Some nice family pretended to have a great time making this video. Good for them. I suppose we will just have to make a video of our own, but don't worry. I won't try to sell it on Amazon.",1381363200,,386,4.301369863013699
8318394,4,B001LKLIQI,"If you are looking for an exercise video for kids, this will keep their attention more than an adult one for sure and it has exercises they will be able to do.  I only used it twice with my son. I was trying to get him to do gym class at school, which he did.  Although I think the price of $25 was a little high and I kind of regret paying that for how many times I used it.",1372982400,,375,3.675
