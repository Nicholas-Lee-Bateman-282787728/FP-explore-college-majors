2851622,5,B000QXDEGI,"This is so terrific, I bought 2 copies - one for our university library, and one for a friend's birthday. Great plays, by a great playwright, featuring great actors - who could ask for more?",1220832000,4,190,4.457142857142857
2851623,1,B000QXDEGI,"The plays and radio plays chosen were generally interesting -- even if more variety rather than sometimes the play and radio version of the same thing on the same disk. But the engineering and production was an abomination. The acts of ""Private Lives"" on radio were out of order, and the third act of ""Blithe Spirit"" was left out entirely. In addition, the disks were frequently flawed enough so that they stopped and skipped. It was a nice idea, but the production is bad enough to make us wary of purchasing any BBC Video productions.",1216771200,35,536,4.652631578947369
2851624,3,B000QXDEGI,"Because of poor sound quality, this Noel Coward set is disappointing, but glad to have it anyway.",1214092800,8,97,4.764705882352941
2851625,5,B000QXDEGI,"Throughout the years, the BBC has broadcast any number of Coward's immensely witty and wise works, and they are here, it what may be called a true embarrassment of riches. They have been cut and re-arranged for television, and some of the casts may leave a bit to be desired, but all in all it's a great collection of stuff by one of the masters of entertainment of the twentieth century.
Margaret Leighton plays the besotted mother in 1969 broadcast of Coward's 1924 smash The Vortex; Alec McCowen plays Elyot in a 1976 Private Lives; the ever lovely Rula Lenska essays Gilda, the female corner of a mnage in Design for Living; the magnificent Donald Sinden plays the narcissistic actor in Present Laughter and Geraldine McEwan, Deborah Kerr and Sir Paul Scofield are in Coward's last masterpiece, Suite in Two Keys. And, as someone once said, you ain't heard nothing yet. Coward wrote a number of short stories that were, with greater and lesser success, adapted for television. Since Coward, a master at play construction, chose to write these in prose should tell us something, and some of these programs have a weary sense of tediousness and lack of focus. However, with British stars such as Tom Courtney, Dame Judi Dench, Ian Holm and Susannah York, and each clocking in at less than an hour, they are curiosities worth investigating. The greatest curiosity is the Joan Collins Repertory Company doing eight of the one-act plays from Tonight at Eight-Thirty. The plays, their casts and production values are quite fantastic. Collins rises to the occasion brilliantly, giving a star turn in each---beautiful, warm, touching, hysterically funny and a far cry from the sex-ridden harridan she usually plays on this side of the pond. Added to this intoxicating mix are several radio adaptations of the plays, including Dame Judi in Hay Fever and Stephen Fry in Private Lives, a bizarre but fascinating 1978 variety television show called The Songwriters that features cabaret like performances of Coward's songs, and best of all, a couple of BBC interviews with Coward on acting and writing. This collection is a delight, and proves that Coward had vastly more than merely a talent to amuse.",1205625600,42,2194,4.9646739130434785
2851626,4,B000QXDEGI,"This 7-disc album is a feast for Noel Coward devotees. You will find in this album his plays, dramatizations of his short stories, music and interviews.

2851629,4,B000QXDEGI,"I HAVE NOT YET ENJOYED THE WHOLE SET BUT WHAT I'VE SEEN IS EXTRAORDINARILY NICE. I SUGGEST YOU IMMEDIATELY GO TO ""HANDS ACROSS THE SEA"": A LITTLE PLAY BUT THE FUN IS BIG BIG BIG. THE PLAYS (EVEN IF I DON'T LOVE ""DESIGN FOR LIVING"") ARE MARVELLOUSLY ACTED. FIVE STARS OUGHT TO BE GIVEN TO THIS SET, BUT I GIVE FOUR, OWING TO THE RADIO PLAYS WHICH ARE TAPED WITHOUT CHAPTERS AND YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO GIVE A PAUSE TO YOUR LISTENING! WHAT A PITY.

2851631,5,B000QXDEGI,"THE NOEL COWARD collection....is simply a treasure.  Yes, we will each
have slightly different favorites...but...there is not a dud in the whole box.  And, there is a monumental ammount of material...and all of it first rate.  I becan with disc TWO and ran one dvd a night...and
THEN did disc ONE and watched ""The Vortex"" last...and indeed, it was not a personal favorite...but it was well done and beautifully mounted like everything in this collection.  Yes, there were nine plays in TONIGHT AT 8:30...and only EIGHT are included on this disc.  Joan Collins is a total delight in all of them...and she plays a wide variety of roles
from glamourous through frumpy.  All I can say...is...I have never bought a BOX so full of treasures and so entertaining throughout.  I have
watched everything and still have all the audio only features to examine.

2851662,5,B000QXDEGI,"I loved this collection and kept it for years.  Unfortunately, I gave it away to someone else who also shared my appreciation of noel coward and now that i want to purchase it again, it's not available.  Please get the problem fixed, Amazon, so I can buy myself another copy.  I don't get what the problem was - it's great.",1353196800,,323,4.35
2851663,1,B000QXDEGI,"A great idea, and most of the plays are excellently produced and acted. But the technical quality of the set is simply not acceptable, especially from a ""brand"" as prestigious as the BBC. In addition to those physical defects noted by the other reviewers, Act 1 of Design for Living on disc 3 is simply not viewable, too many skips-stops-halts- and finally complete failure. The play can only be watched by using the SELECT SCENES feature and selecting ""Scene 3"", thereby skipping the entirety of Act 1 and starting at the beginning of Act 2.  I tried three different copies of the disc (one purchased, and two copies rented from each of the major video-rental chains) played on a dvd player and two different computers, and the problem existed on all three discs, obviously a manufacturing flaw rather than a random defect. That being said, if you're a committed Noel Coward fan, and can tolerate the frustrations of this seriously flawed set, it is and will be the only source for these plays as they are not likely to be produced and recorded for sale again in our lifetime.",1311465600,15,1077,4.698412698412699
2851664,2,B000QXDEGI,"After suffering thru several of these, poorly acted, laugh tracks inserted capriciously, etc. etc., I came to Present Laughter.  This play is sooooo rich in various kinds of humour and satire.  The actors and direction are a total delight.  I cannot imagine an actor who comes anywhere near Donald Sinden.  He is just incredible.  I can watch this one over and over.  It is so richly done I always find something new in it.",1305158400,4,423,4.648648648648648
2851665,1,B000QXDEGI,"I admit I had never seen a Noel Coward play before picking up this DVD collection.  I was much happier before.

While there are a few palatable selections here, most of these plays are among the most repugnant, nasty and anti-human works I have seen.  Coward himself seems to be an artist of little depth, vacuous, with no humanity.

Some of the more enjoyable works include a movie about a British couple who stay on their diplomatic post in the face of a Japanese attack.  There is also a very enjoyable work about a playwrite who helplessly watches as his play is butchered by the industry.  In fact, it seems Coward is at his best when writing about the theater.  The eight one act plays with Joan Collins are also relatively unoffensive to decent people.  A few other tolerable moments can be found on these discs, but they in no way make up for the rest, which I have to say is worse than what comes out of Hollywood or on the TV nowadays.

A work about a dying man recounting his life with a dance troupe would have, in most hands, been a vehicle for feelings ranging from tender to angry.  Coward does nothing but creep me out.  The man is creepy, his thoughts are creepy and the presentation is creepy.  Instead of feeling sad or angry or happy, I felt my skin crawl.

Private lives has a couple of characters who I kept wishing would die painful deaths.  Coward is in gear here, showing his complete lack of empathy, maturity or decency as well has his hatred of the institutions of society.

But it is Design for Living that scores the winning goal.  The characters are like 4 year olds trapped in adult bodies crying the whole time, ""I don't want responsibility Mommy!  I want I don't want to do chores!  No Mommy, NO!""  I wanted to see them done in, but that wasn't happeneing since the characters are probably Coward himself in different modes.  Shallow and hateful.  Very hateful of anything good and decent.  I would have hoped Coward would have had the sense to redeem the film and have Ernest push the three off the balcony, but no.

I have a low, low opinion of Coward after this.  Not only an immoral man, but really not very talented.  I can watch works with themes I despise yet still give credit to an artist for technical skill.  Coward has little.  Shallow, shallow.  The world will not miss him.",1291852800,3,2321,4.448931116389549
2851666,5,B000QXDEGI,"Oh if Life could imitate Art then I would live in the world of Noel Coward.  Reading his short stories is what spurred me on to order this fantastic collection of a portion of his work.  My husband and I and our 13 year old daughter are quiet as mice as we watch these shows.  In fact, my daughter is the one that requests we sit down and watch another show of ""Uncle Noels"".  The acting is spellbinding and the Best of British Best are in these shows. Not to diminish their ability, but really, even a rank actor could pull off Coward's work.  You can't do much wrong with his writings. It is just that remarkable. It plays itself.  I imagine it is like being inhabited by the playwright himself: follow his lead and go.  I find myself startled at the genius of Coward. The examination of the human condition, profound.  And with this, his work will be timeless and never dated.  The era seems almost irrelevant, it is the full understanding of the actions of people and the decisions they make that is compelling and I believe spans to people today in our mad society.  Watching these collective disks made me smile with tears in my eyes.  I wish I could have met Coward....and I do miss him all the same.",1283472000,4,1207,4.367713004484305
2851667,5,B000QXDEGI,"When I bought it I thought it was a little pricey. I was so wrong. It is priceless. It is beautifully packaged and the best thing a Coward fan can possess. It has marvelously filmed, beautifully acted versions of The Vortex and Hayfever on the first dvd  (There are seven) and a 40 minute fascinating interview of a mature Coward. Having never seen any of these, I settled down to a fabulous experience. The Vortex is wonderful, intense and was so shocking when it was written Coward had a hard time getting it past the censors. The biggest surprise in all of the presentations, none can be called dated. The clothes and settings are knock-outs. Hay Fever is absolutely riotous. I have watched it 4 times and howled with glee each time. Private Lives, which I have heard of all my life but never seen is wonderful and again, it isn't dated at all.
So, bottom line. The $60+ this album costs is a huge bargain. I just cannot praise it highly enough. If you are a Noel Coward fan, this is the first must-have on your list. Do whatever you need to do to get it legally. Amazon is the best place to start. Do not deprive yourself of the treat of a life time.",1270598400,3,1154,4.342592592592593
2851668,3,B000QXDEGI,"We found this set to be entertaining, particularly Hay Fever; however, there are some duds in this set such as the Vortex.  3 1/2 stars is my ""real"" rating but I cannot reflect that in the system, so 3 stars it is.",1263081600,,214,4.095238095238095
2851669,5,B000QXDEGI,"The Coward Collection is a generous serving of the Master's works, principally culled from BBC production of the late 1970's and 1980's. If some of the productions are showing their age, there is still much to enjoy. Hay Fever, one of the earliest and funniest plays, received a curiously static and slow-moving treatment with a stellar cast valiantly battling the direction. Present Laughter is a filmed stage production with the redoubtable Donald Sinden in full mugging mode: but he nails the laughs. Cutaways to the audience are irritating, but possible were used as editing points. Ian Holm and Judi Dench in Mr. & Mrs. Edgehill, Tom Courtenay in Me And The Girls, Margaret Leighton in The Vortex (wildly melodramatic but undeniably powerful): there is much to treasure. Highly recommended.",1230336000,4,795,5.170542635658915
2851670,5,B000QXDEGI,"I was not disappointed in this wonderful set and watched most of it in three days only to find that Disc 5 was missing.  Anxiously, awaiting replacement set.",1227484800,,157,4.607142857142857
2851671,5,B000QXDEGI,"If you ever doubted that Noel Coward was a great writer, then buy this collection and be persuaded. Glittering productions of most of his masterpieces, with splendid casts. I missed BLITHE SPIRIT, but I guess you can't have everything (it is represented, however, in a radio production).

The collection as a whole is a rave, but I do want to single out a few of my personal favorites: Penelope Keith, who stars in both HAY FEVER and PRIVATE LIVES, is a particular standout; she has the Coward style absolutely to a ""T."" Rula Lenska (who achieved fame here in the 1970s when she did a series of commercials for Alberto VO5 hairspray) is lusciously luminous in DESIGN FOR LIVING. Joan Collins's anthology series TONIGHT AT 8:30 presents eight of Coward's famous (and not-so-famous but still worthy) one-acts, in perfect productions -- including fine, vanity-free performances from Collins herself that will give you a new respect for her. I could go on an on; suffice to say every item in this 7-disc collection is worth seeing, and many of them are unforgettable.

The package isn't flawless; some of the (audio only) radio productions are difficult to access, and the radio PRIVATE LIVES doesn't play in the proper order -- if you don't know the play you'll be awfully confused listening to it (better watch the superb production with Ms. Keith and Alec McCowen first, just to familiarize yourself).

All of these productions are British TV productions from the 1970s and '80s that, as far as I know, were never broadcast in the U.S., so every disc is a revelation. If you are a fan of Noel Coward, or theater, or great sophisticated comedy, you absolutely cannot be without this superb collection. It's an embarrassment of riches.

And best of all, as great as this set is, enough of Coward's career is left untouched to supply an equally lavish Volume Two. So how about it, BBC...?",1226793600,15,1884,4.805555555555555
8198138,5,B000QXDEGI,"The DVD set covers a wide range of Coward plays and even dramatizations of his narrative fiction - excellent productions with dream casts, as well as interviews with Coward.

'The Master, ' Sir Noel Coward (1899-1973),  at his very best;  these plays are superbly acted by well known stars.  They will be enjoyed over and over again.  Mostly written in the 1920s, 30s and 40s;  these 21 TV and stage versions were broadcast by the BBC throughout the 1980s and early 90s.  Also included are three radio versions,  two interviews and performances of some of his songs.  Each of the 7 discs contains from between 5 and 8 hours of suberb entertinment which makes this set quite good value.",1395014400,,640,4.592920353982301
8198146,5,B000QXDEGI,"This is a nice set that does for the plays of Coward what other BBC sets have done for Ibsen, Wilde, Shaw and Chekhov, showcasing some very good TV and radio adaptations of representative works. I especially enjoyed seeing the eight ""Tonight at 8:30"" one-acts (including ""Still Life,"" the source material for ""Brief Encounter"") and ""Suite in 2 Keys,"" in which the mature Coward delved into Tennessee Williams territory with an uncharacteristically frank discussion of sexual politics. Now that I've seen a fuller spectrum of his work I'm impressed by his theatrical craftsmanship and by how much genuine psychological insight he was able to slip in under the cover of light entertainment. It's a pleasure to see what past masters like Geraldine McEwan, Alec McCowen and Paul Scofield can discover in him, and the surprising amount of momentum he can give to such an unexpected interpreter as Joan Collins.",1374624000,,905,5.080536912751678
8198147,4,B000QXDEGI,"This is an excellent collection of Noel Coward made-for-TV stories and plays. About half what I've seen has been top-rate, and much of the rest was, as I'll explain, mostly a matter of not being in the mood.

What I've seen to date and so enjoyed were ""Me and the Girls,"" with Tom Courtenay, and ""Mr. and Mrs. Edgehill,"" with Ian Holm and a middle-aged Judi Dench, ever busy even back in the 80s. Also, 'Suite in two keys: A song at twilight' (1982), with Deborah Kerr and Paul Scofield. This last, 83-minute story, involves delightful  jousting in a drawing room about the male lead's past. Kerr may verge on matronly, but with her beauty intact, along with her rapier voice, she is no less disarming than ever, especially for the lead she is trying to blackmail. Some terminology dates this (gay relations vs. 'normal' ones) but the parity of the sexes could not be more contemporary. There were two other productions I glanced at, but decided to pass on, since they were more theatrical than cinematic productions. Other reviews suggest that much remains to enjoy, including productions with Stephen Fry, Suzannah York, and a series of playlets with Joan Collins before she was afflicted with glamor.

""Me and the Girls"" is particularly affecting and rather ambitious in sweep. It incorporates a few recognizable songs, reminding us that Coward kept company with Cole Porter and almost no others in the composition of top-drawer material that to this day stands up well. Above all, it's got an excellent script; no small wonder, being based on a Coward story. No doubt this plot, about a song-and-dance artiste with wit and of considerable complexity, is partly autobiographical. The troupe do not ham things up, as might so easily be done, and things are handled with restraint.

It's a wonder Coward was given so much rope with the subject and got away with it - although ""given"" is probably a naive word choice; he surely had to swim upstream aplenty. It's amazing how ahead of the game the Brits were to much-ballyhooed fare such as ""Brokeback Mountain,"" which made such a fuss about gay relations (and so very coyly) - although no doubt this 80s adaptation starring Courtenay is more explicit and took liberties with his work, given changed mores. Still, the subject's treated maturely and with humour, and with the naturalness though hesitancy the topic deserves. For its acting tour de force, I should repeat that 'Suite in two keys: A song at twilight' also makes this set well worth getting.

This is not to say that everything in this collection is as winning. Some productions are set in drawing rooms where well-dressed, highly articulate characters exchange pleasantries and banter while intrigues brew. This grew tedious for me, especially when peppered with such turns as: ""Thanks fearfully. I should love to!"" (a direct quotation: I kid you not), in response, as I recall, to an offer of a drink! Truth be told, these adapted plays also showed promise in the form of interactions that were anything but hackneyed, plots that would intrigue if one can overlook a few theatricalities from an age when elegance was not always regarded as affectation ...so back to the matter of mood that I touched on before.

The only other drawback I can think of is that my copy's missing its booklet, so I'm left to choose from the 9 DVDs without a clue as to which production I'll find. Mind you, taking them at random has so far been rewarding. While some items are set in drawing rooms, others are not just set outdoors but required exotic locations (""Mr. and Mrs. Edgehill"" has South Seas settings). So the productions seem to have varying provenances, and I'm not well acquainted with the sources; in short, they're not of a piece -- as you'll find, say, with the ""Bertie and Wooster"" series of multiple items.

Production values are good for the mid-1980s, while not lavish. Any shortcomings are more than made up by the gifted main players; at least those I've named are good, and often brilliant and sensitive (Courtenay, Dench) in this fare, even if some supporting parts may fall a bit short. The DVDs have close captions for the hearing impaired, which is startling for Brit made-for-TV fare harking to the 80s.

So, if you have an ear for a sharply-crafted script, colorful characters, good plotting and Masterpiece Theater-type fare - and especially if you can take with a pinch a few drawing room denizens whose patter is sometimes frightfully frou-frou - don't think twice.",1357862400,,4491,4.838541666666667
