334339,5,630154059X,"This is the grandaddy of British horror movies - and still one of the best! For the many of you who believe that movies only became really scary after Psycho - think again. Dead of Night is an eerie concoction of supernatural scares that chills and twists with an assurance reminiscent of The Sixth Sense. Mervyn Johns plays an architect / restorer invited by a potential client to a country house for the weekend. Arriving, he is immediately overcome with a powerful sense of deja vu. Upon meeting the small circle of strangers who are also guests at the house, he relates that he had met them all before in recurring dreams. What's more, he had dreamt of exactly the same situation unfolding before them. Under challenge from a skeptical psychiatrist, he begins to accurately predict what happens next -forecasting ominously that at some point events will take a turn for the nightmarish. As the psychiatrist's attempts at debunking become more bullying and dogmatic, the other guests gradually begin to sympathise with and believe the increasingly terrified architect. In support of his story, each relates a supernatural incident he or she had experienced first hand to underline the point that many things are not explainable by the formal sciences. As unsettling as the movie already is by this point, the horror stories by each of the guests injects a satisfying versatility to the supernatural content of the film. From a tale of clairvoyance and premonition; a classical haunting in a grand mansion; an evil mirror that reflects its horrific past; the revenge of a cheated golfer from beyond the grave to a bravura classic finale detailing a case of possession (or schizophrenia?) of a ventriloquist (Michael Redgrave) by his dummy (expanded more than 30 years later in Richard Attenbourgh's underrated Magic, with Anthony Hopkins as the insane ventriloquist). One tale (I'm not saying which) even humorously plays with eager would-be sceptics in the audience by pandering to their predisposed notions of the ridiculousness of it all - then pulling the rug out from under their certain disdain with a knowing nudge-and-wink punchline. It's confident touches like these, together with a terrific and pioneering ending which elevate Dead of Night indisputably into the horror genre's category of all-time greats. Most people seem to agree that the tale of the ventriloquist and his dummy is the scariest. I would argue that it's certainly the most innovative and original of all the tales and Michael Redgrave's performance is phenomenal - but I'd still go with the evil mirror and its malevolent past as the scariest of the lot. A definite midnight movie for horror fans. If you doubt the ability of a 1945 black-and-white to scare you, then I dare you to switch off the lights and watch it alone. A classic must-have for your horror collection.",970444800,4,2853,5.0210970464135025

As each weird story is told we also advance into analysis of each one to its rightful explanation or is there one? The eerie soundtrack is made more so by the hysterisis on the video. No matter, this is a very well mounted spooky film with each segment seemingly outdoing the previous one. The Sally Ann Howes  segment, the man in the mirror and the finale with Michael Redgrave and his ""dummy"" This segement is an absolute knockout esp. the jail scene.

I've seen a much better transfer from a PBS TV broadcast.  Much of this landmark  horror film's effectiveness comes from its great black-and-white  photography and this tape is a poor presentation of that.  And the price  tag tells all.

334342,5,630154059X,"A popular and critical sensation in its time, DEAD OF NIGHT was the first horror film to be released in Britain since the beginning of WWII.  It's a splendid anthology of occult stories told by five people in a country house visited by a young architect, who had anticipated the scene in a nightmare.  Each recounts a bizarre personal tale, and  after hearing the last, the architect strangles the sole remaining guest, a disbelieving psychiatrist.  Awakened the next morning, the architect discovers he had dreamed it all.............Or has he?  As a lifetime fan of ghost stories and the like, I recommend this movie highly; it's definitely of the best in the genre to this day.  Essentially, it's a group of 5 (really four) horror stories loosely and cleverly linked together. The Christmas ghost story is good material a little weakly done; however the haunted mirror sequence (with Googie Withers) is first-rate; actually one of the most gripping ghost stories you'll see in any film.  An antique mirror reflects the tortured life of the previous owner (who commited suicide) .........  The knockout finale, however is the brilliant and justly famous climatic ventriloquist sequence with Redgrave.  The film evokes rather than depicts horror, and waves its symmetrical spell with the magic of a good script and good direction.  Contributing in no small measure to the uncanny mood is the ominous, Wagnerian score by Georges Auric. who had written the music for Jean Cocteau's films.  The whimsical golfing episode is ridiculously out of place and it could be completely omitted from all prints and one would never know the difference. There is an obscure 1945 British film entitled ""A Place of One's Own"" with James Mason and Margaret Lockwood which sounds interesting -a story of spirit possession; I hope it finds it's way to video soon!",958435200,11,1844,5.052805280528053

One point I'd  really like to make, specially considering I've never heard it referred to  before: isn't it remarkable how the ending of the ventriloquist segment  seems to point forward to the closing scenes of 'Psycho'? - what with  Michael Redgrave, completely possessed by his dummy, grinning maniacally at  the viewer (complete with voiceover) and the psychiatrist's explanation  (""the dummy side of his personality took over..."" instead of the  ""mummy"" side!)

334412,5,630154059X,"Finally DEAD OF NIGHT, which is one of the greatest of all supernatural films, is available in a transfer that does this benchmark film justice. I hesitate to call it a horror film as only two segments out of five would qualify. The rest of the movie features stories that alternate between the fantastic and the comic with a chilling central framing device that holds it all together. This genre known as a portmanteau or anthology film had its origins in German silent cinema with the 1924 expressionistic classic WAXWORKS which is set in a modern day wax museum and tells the stories behind different figures there. Here the year is 1945 and the setting is an English country house where five people are gathered together and then a sixth shows up and relates a bizarre dream involving all of them. That's the framing story. Several of the members then relate a story of something strange that happened to them hoping to persuade one of the guests, a skeptical psychiatrist, that dreams can be prophetic and that uncanny things do happen.

The first story involves a hospital patient who sees an antique hearse with the driver saying ""room for one more"". Then there's a ghost story set during a Christmas party. The third sequence about a haunted mirror has been copied many times most notably in the 1974 Amicus anthology FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE. The fourth is a comic tale about two golfers featuring characters from Hitchcock's THE LADY VANISHES. The last, and most famous sequence, involves Michael Redgrave as a ventriloquist losing his grip on reality which was basically remade as MAGIC with Anthony Hopkins many years later. The movie concludes when it turns out to be a dream that is about to come true. For years DEAD OF NIGHT was only available in prints of varying visual quality but with an adequate soundtrack only. Now this new DVD (there's a Blu-ray also) gives us the best sounding soundtrack ever along with top-notch picture quality. Currently it's only available as a Region 2 disc but there are now many different devices that will play them so that's not the drawback it used to be. The best transfer yet is the least that this classic British supernatural omnibus deserves.",1443830400,6,2197,4.796833773087071

334415,4,630154059X,"Dead of Night is a very good movie. Others have, as usual, spoiled the plot for you, so I will comment only on the emotional impact of the film, and on its implications.
At first, this seems like a silly movie, fluff hardly worth your time to watch. The ""ghost stories"" are relatively mundane, non-descript and not really frightening. Amusing, but not frightening. But, as the movie goes on, a sense of eerie unease gradually begins to fill you. There is something WRONG about this movie, something terribly wrong. It's not the ghost stories that scare you; it's the movie itself, especially the scene when the narrator goes insane and the camera angles are all wrong, queer, disturbing, cross-eyed, like an Escher print come to life, ensnaring you with no way out. The stairs just keep bringing you back to where you started, and you can't escape. The humor turns ugly, and then demonic, leaving you feeling like you too are going insane. And that peaceful, but intolerable ending...
""What goes around, comes around,"" is a common saying implying that your (and others') Karma will eventually catch up with you/them. In this movie, it has an entirely different meaning. ""What goes around, comes around,"" means a closed circle that repeats over and over, like a record with a scratch, that just keeps playing the same few notes over and over. In a way, this is a metaphor for Buddhism. We continue to make the same mistakes over and over; the one person you cannot run away from is yourself.
When the beginning and the end are the same, where can you hide? Where can you go? What can you do?
This is one disturbing movie, with plenty to think about once it's done. I saw it decades ago, and I'm still thinking about it.",1428105600,,1718,4.654605263157895

334452,3,630154059X,"This 2-disc, 2003 DVD release of Dead of Night & The Queen of Spades from Anchor Bay is the only way to get these films in North America. Dead of Night (1945) was one of the first anthology horror films and would be considered one of the Top 100 Horror Films of All-Time. Stephen King wrote in Danse Macabre how much Dead of Night influenced his early horror habits. There are four segments in the film of varying quality. It is astoundingly fast-paced for its era. It remains one of the few films before 1960 that I can genuinely appreciate with friends (many of them don't bother with old classics at all). Since the audio and extras aren't quite up to snuff this is a 4-star film in a 3-star package. However, the picture quality is decent. There is at least one other film with the same name (Dead of Night) that is completely unrelated and nowhere near as legendary as the 1945 film in this package.

In The Queen of Spades (1949), an elderly countess strikes a bargain with the devil and exchanges her soul for the ability to always win at cards. An army officer, who is also a fanatic about cards, murders her for the secret, then finds himself haunted by the woman's spirit. This film isn't quite as legendary as Dead of Night but it is still interesting. IMDB rates it 7.2 but it hasn't been widely rated or reviewed. It is bundled with Dead of Night as a bonus. I consider it a decent 3-star film.

This set is worth $40 (give or take) so check the price before you buy. It is now out of print but remains the best way to own Dead of Night until it gets a Blu-ray release.

Considered by most any movie fan, film aficionado and arm chair critic to be the grandfather of horror anthology films there's no doubt ""Dead of Night"" created a new genre, a new formula that still so many decades later continues to inspire film makers young and old alike.

I suppose out of the four vignettes it's the last story of the ventriloquist figure that has been copied the most. Rod Serling, a die hard devotee of this film often spoke of it's relevance and inspiration for many Twilight Zone classic episodes including ""The Dummy"" and Caesar And Me"" Not far behind, is the menacing ""Fat's"" - the wooden nemesis to Anthony Hopkins in William Goldman's terrifying ""Magic"" directed by the great Richard  Attenborough .

Dead of Night also delved into subjects considered taboo for those times, dead children, domestic violence and mental illness to name but a few. It's a fearless film  in this regard that again, can still evoke chills and leave you more then tempted to let the lights burn a bit longer before turning in. Albeit what may have had audiences covering their eyes in those Grande old theaters of a bygone era may seem quaint and even charming by today's standards of CGI and visceral bloodshed.

This is the perfect little movie to pop in your DVD player on a cold and rainy afternoon.",1339545600,2,367,4.6461538461538465
334506,5,630154059X,"The story opens with a man driving up to a large house which he'd been requested to come to. He seems to know everything about it even though he'd never been there before. There are five others, including a psychiatrist, there all of whom he seems to recognize. He tells them he'd seen them all (and the house) in a recurring dream of this total event. He even predicts minor incidences. The others are all fascinated except the psychiatrist, who merely strives to provides ""rational explanations"".

This prompts the others to offer seemingly supernatural experiences they've each had. Their experiences are what make up the anthology's individual stories.

The first story concerns a race car driver who suffers a crash and has an odd experience while in the hospital. This tale is an early version of The Twilight Zone's ""Twenty-Two""

In The next tale, a young lady recounts being at a party and during a game everyone's playing, she discovers a room in which she finds a young boy crying, a boy she hasn't see at all at the party.

Things intensify as another lady tells the third tale in which she bought her fianc&eacute; a second hand mirror. He at first likes the gift, but then he starts seeing a reflection of a different room (which looks fancier and about a century older) then the modern room the mirror's in. The more this happens, the more he has spells where his personality begins to darken.

The fourth tale is uncharacteristically light and involves two golfers who love the same woman. To solve this dilemma, the two play a golf game in which the loser will bow out relinquishing her to the winner. One of the players wins by cheating. The loser promptly walks into a nearby pond and drowns himself. What follows is a haunting that's in the spirit (no pun intended) of ""Topper"" or perhaps an Aunt Clara episode of ""Bewitched"".

As it turns out, there is a good reason for this tale's completely different mood. If curious, read ""Spoiler"" below. It ONLY affects this one story.

MINOR SPOILER FOLLOWS:
Apparently, this man had no supernatural experiences to offer, so he just made up a preposterous and comedic tale in order not to ""Feel left out"" of the group.
SPOILER ENDS.

The light previous episode also serves to disarm the viewer a little so as to plunge him into the creepy last tale.

Oddly enough, the psychiatrist, it turns out, has also had an unexplainable experience. His tale (the best one) is practically a mini movie in itself. A story of a ventriloquist who's very ambitious dummy wants a different partner. There are some risqu&eacute; undertones in this tale. Also several times the word ""Hell"" is used (unusual for 1945). It seems rather daring for its time.

This movie is superbly put together and has puns and metaphors which reward paying close attention or at least repeated viewings. There are also flashbacks within flashbacks, twists and tie-ins. Very much a puzzle. The film isn't even quite ready to stop when ""The End"" appears on the screen.

One cool dialogue example comes at a point when the protagonist refers to the difficulty in clearly remembering a dream by comparing it to being in a thunderstorm at night. (and I'm paraphrasing here) When the lightning flashes, everything is crystal clear for a only split second. (Once it's dark again, it's hard to completely recall what you saw)

Twilight Zone fans will definitely recognize major elements of that series. Particularly ""Twenty-Two"", ""Shadow Play"", ""The Dummy"", ""Caesar and Me"", and ""Perchance to Dream"". TZ fans will also note the quote from Shakespeare's ""Hamlet"" which Rod Serling also used. Viewers may also see influences to ""Psycho""

In addition, I recommend this film to fans of ""Thriller"", ""One Step Beyond"" and perhaps ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents""

334528,4,630154059X,"""Dead of Night"" is a classic 1940's British supernatural thriller that has managed to retain most of its chills in spite of the passing years.  An architect is invited to spend the weekend at the country home of a prospective client.  When he arrives he realizes he has repeatedly dreamt of this visit and the encounter with the other house guests.  He also is aware that there is something unpleasant associated with the visit.  A well-known psychiatrist scoffs at his premonition, but the other guests offer their support by recounting their own experiences with the occult.

The resulting stories are a mixed bag.  Some are slight, others are a bit silly.  But whatever shortcomings the early stories possess are more than atoned for by the concluding tale, related by the psychiatrist himself, in which Michael Redgrave plays a ventriloquist whose dummy has a mind of its own.  It is a genuinely frightening vignette, and Redgrave is superb as a man tormented either by the supernatural or his own madness.  It is a fitting climax to a well-made, eerie film.",1331337600,,1062,4.888268156424581
334529,3,630154059X,"<strong>Dead of Night</strong> (Alberto Cavalcanti, et al., 1945)

I've spent months studiously avoiding writing a <em>Dead of Night</em> review, because I'm at a loss what to say about it. I've never been a big fan of Ealing (compare Alexander MacKendrick's work when he was an Ealing guy to what he was able to produce in Hollywood--one of the very few examples of Hollywood importing a director and actually getting him to produce better work than he did overseas), but I'd heard enough about <em>Dead of Night</em> over the past thirty-odd years that I figured I needed to give it a try. To my surprise, it wasn't half bad, and thus my confusion.

<em>Dead of Night</em>, an anthology film, was trotted out in order to show off the talents of four of Ealing's rising directorial stars: Cavalcanti (<em>Went the Day Well?</em>), Robert Hamer (<em>Kind Hearts and Coronets</em>), Charles Crichton (<em>A Fish Called Wanda</em>), and Basil Dearden (<em>Victim</em>). The four of them film six stories, all told (including the linking narrative, about a guy whose recurring dream seems as if it's coming true, which incites the other guests to tell the movie's tales), from writers like H. G. Wells and E. F. Benson (all uncredited, natch).

The linking narrative involves an architect (<em>The Day of the Triffids</em>' Mervyn Johns) who goes off to a country house, where despite a distressing sense of <em>deja vu</em>, he is encouraged to stay by the guests, who alternately encourage him to fight against feeling as if he's bound by the rules of a dream he had just like this and tell tales of their own supernatural experiences.

None of these things are overly scary, especially these days, and you've seen most of them done better (a few were reprised quite well in <em>Twilight Zone</em> episodes, for example), but it's a well-made film, and an extremely stylistically coherent one for being the work of four directors; the only other anthology film I can think of that has this much stylistic integrity despite being the work of multiple directors is 2005's <em>Rampo Noir</em>. These days it's more worth seeing for the quality of acting and direction than it is for any stray scares that may come along, but of all the Ealing movies I've seen, this is the best. ***",1325116800,,2278,4.955497382198953

I bought it from  Nostalgia Family Video, Movies Unlimited--to which amazon directed me at the bottom of one of their ""Dead of Night"" pages. Why? Because I was tired of all the grousing around here! I bought it to replace the ""Dead of Night"" ""Queen of Spades"" combination (at the moment selling for over $100), because that one was sticking in several places and the soundtrack was wearing out. The contrast in the new one is fine at all times.  The movie is JUST...FINE!

It is NOT crystal clear. It is NOT like most of the copies of ""The Red Shoes"" (1948) I have seen, And a few others. There are some speckles during the first 5 minutes, and though I heard lines I never heard before, there are STILL a few I can't understand. The focus tends to be great up close, but distance shots are not as clear. I would love to say: it hasn't been remastered, except:

I saw this film in a theater, within the last 20 years (I also saw it in 1945), and, since everyone in the main room in the movie was smoking constantly, the air became full of smoke. It actually interfered a little with watching the film at one point. At this point, there was a murmur of laughter throughout the audience around me. That smoke is now gone. Can one remove smoke from a room without remastering? I assume there was little real smoking in ""Good Night and Good Luck,"" (2005) because the room never became full of smoke; it is either this, or that they had the smoke removers working overtime as they filmed.

Mervyn Johns plays the main character, the architect, to whom everything that happens at the house he is to make changes in...is a half-remembered, recurring dream...

BASIL DEARDEN directed the beginning, the end, the connections and the first reported--occult happening (""Just room for one inside, Sir!"") Short, sweet and frightening. The psychiatrist (Frederick Valk), we now surmise--is going to object to the actual occult nature of ALL the stories, including the wonderful one he himself tells. At least, he hasn't stopped objecting yet (Johns' recurring dream and the first story).

Do I believe in this supernatural stuff? Hadn't thought about it.

I didn't care for the ""Mirror"" one very much, except for the antiques seller.  I mean, I was glad they solved their problem, and lived happily ever after, but they didn't interest me much. Now the first owner of the mirror, his actions seemed to suit his qualities as a man better.  (You'd think the woman would have inquired about the ""provenance"" of the mirror before she brought it home to her fiance, leaving them both unsuspecting).

I liked Sally Ann Howes' ""Sardines"" story a lot. The inns and outs of the old house as well as the little boy, soon to be so horribly murdered, and all the young people crowding around in their costumes...and how her mother, who arrives to take her away, when she says the architect has to hit her, so she can't leave, says ""I'm sure4 he can find someone else to hit.""

Which is plenty of humor, combined with that inherent humor in the last story and various other places so we don't need the golfing story! It is funny, and self-satirizing--but it's too funny for this movie. Unless, of course, your WHOLE LIFE revolves around golf.
It's directed by Michael Creighton, at that time the most famous director of the 4 involved with the film.

Which brings us to the psychiatrist's story, which--although he said it ""made him wonder, quite a lot,"" he has a psychological explanation for. It's about a ventriloquist (Michael Redgrave, in perhaps his best role on screen), his dummy (Hugo Fitch, who speaks with Redgrave's voice, although Redgrave is not doing a ventriloquist thing, in spite of having had some experience with it), and Sylvester Kees, another ventriloquist--with whom Hugo flirts, constantly. Hugo teases Frears (Redgrave) unmercifully, calls him nasty names, and even...bites him (sic). Without treating Hugo in any way inappropriate to a dummy, , carrying him or speaking to him--except the one time he slaps him--, Redgrave behaves--like a possessive, jealous lover*, who is constantly belittled by the object of his affections...Cavalcanti, who had directed a few things in England already--made his name with this one!

The end of that one is Wonderful; so is the end of the movie.

*You are by no means required to believe this, but I did think of it before I read Brief Encounters, all only about a month ago. I was glad that someone agreed with me, though.

The ""DVD"" is actually a DVD-R, with a transfer that looks like it originated from a fair quality VHS, but with occassional freeze-frames and digital noise due to a spotty render. No extras, no subtitles, and only a basic chapter-selection menu.

It is advertised as ""new""... and I supposed that may be technically true, to the extent that it isn't ""used"". ""New"" in the sense that after the disc emerged from the DVD-burner, it got put it in a case and shrink-wrapped without anyone watching it first, even in the interest of basic quality control.

(Here be spoilers! Haven't seen the film yet? Stop reading now.)

Ealing Studios' suspenseful omnibus ""Dead of Night"" was the first really superior and creepy horror anthology; it paved the way for many more to come from Amicus Studios and others. And it inspired at least two episodes of Rod Serling's ""The Twilight Zone"" program (the episode ""22"" which featured the infamous 'Room for one more' line, and also ""The Dummy"" featuring a sinister ventriloquist doll).

We are presented with five stories of the macabre:
The Hearse Carriage
Hide and Seek
The Mirror
Golf and the Ghost
Hugo the Dummy

(Note: I made up those five titles because I could not find the actual names.)

Of course, most people love the final story most, featuring a wonderful turn by Michael Redgrave as ventriloquist Maxwell Frere. This story must have been at least partially inspirational for the 1960 film ""Psycho"".

I also enjoy Hide and Seek, the children's story, featuring actress Sally Howes (who would later play Truly Scrumptious in ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" two decades later). This sequence seems packed with tension and it ends with a supreme chill. Maybe I have a thing about children and parties and holidays. But this scenario is just so perfect for a child, with its glowing hearth and gifts and yummy goodies. Too good to be true. You just get the feeling that something wrong is afoot. And it is.
Many people actually call this chapter the weakest link in the anthology but I beg to differ.

For me, the golfing ghost chapter (comedy relief right before the final and scariest tale) is the weakest of the lot, at least for my money. It actually slows the film down and weighs heavily on the flow of the movie.

But this is such a masterful exercise in what an unsettling horror movie should be. Granted, not every tale is spooky, but the writing is good, and the way the stories are woven together in the climax is just wonderful and positively frightening. We can almost feel the dread and unease of Walter Craig (Mervyn Johns) as he starts witnessing the signs in his dream as they happen right in front of him.

Everyone who has seen this movie remembers that brilliant ending, how everything ties together... and how the nightmare begins anew. That icy feeling of deja-vu is simply spinetingling.

The first time I saw this film on television, I was glued to it completely, and when it ended I asked myself ""Why have I never seen this wonderful film before?""

Ironically in ""Dead of Night"" there are no common trappings of horror film-- no gossamer curtains billowing in the wind, no booming thunderstorms, no creaking doors, no monsters or blood. And yet it's powerful.

The score is extremely effective, and the cinematography is excellent. And it gets bonus points for being a British film. And why is it that sometimes the Brits just do horror so well? Go figure.

In conclusion, ""Dead of Night"" is a gem, a classic horror masterpiece and a landmark.",1252454400,,2962,4.750487329434698
334581,5,630154059X,"Released by Britain's legendary cinematic power-house, Ealing Studios, in 1945, 'Dead Of Night' is one of the earliest - and still most accomplished - portmanteau horror films ever to be released on an unsuspecting public.

Prefiguring the likes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twilight-Zone-The-Movie/dp/B00005JOJE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twilight Zone - The Movie</a>&nbsp;by nearly forty years or so, each tale within the film is the work of a different director (Alfredo Cavalcanti, Basil Dearden, Charles Crichton and Robert Hamer), is adapted from an original short story (by luminaries such as H.G. Wells, Angus McPhail, John Baines and E.F. Benson) and is linked together by a very nicely unfurled bridging-tale which compels the audience to keep watching.

Architect Walter Craig (Mervyn Johns) arrives at the Kentish farmhouse of the affable Eliot Foley (Roland Culver) in order to measure up the specifications of a remodelling job. But Craig is gripped by an awful sense of foreboding - he's sure he's been to the house before and his sense of deja-vu is compounded upon being introduced to the other guests staying at the house: society wife, Joan Cortland (the stunningly beautiful, if implausibly named, Googie Withers); psychiatrist, Dr. Van Straaten (Frederick Valk); racing driver, Hugh Grainger (Anthony Baird); youthful neighbour, Sally O'Hara (Sally Ann Howes) and Foley's mother (Judy Kelly).

Craig informs his fellow guests that he has dreamed the events that are unfolding and Van Straaten, ever the rationalist, attempts to palliate his sense of unease. However, Foley, Cortland, Grainger and O'Hara are less than convinced. You see, they've all had run-ins with the bizarre themselves and, as the film progresses, they recount their stories one by one...

And what stories they are - we are treated to tales of ominous hearse drivers; eerie mirrors; haunted houses; spectral golfers and demented ventriloquists.

'Dead Of Night' is very much a film of it's time. It's production values, although excellent by rationed British post-war standards, may seem dated and rickety to younger audiences and it's incorporation of a musical number may seem antiquated by today's sensibilities, but its elevated above what may be perceived by some as these shortcomings by an excellent script, earnest performances (Johns, Withers, Falk and Michael Redgrave, as a tortured ventriloquist, are particularly good), and a brilliantly demented streak of black humour which is overt not only in the deeply amusing tale of spectral golfers - which satirises the British middle-class obsession with golf and 'fair-play' - but in subtler instances (upon being informed, by her daughter, that Craig has suffered a premonition in which he will hit the child savagely, the deeply horsey O'Hara matriarch responds with an indulgent grin and a rebuff of ""Oh well, I'm sure he can hit somebody else instead!"")

Whether you're a fan of British cinema, portmanteau horror films in general, or just a more genteel era of film-making, consider 'Dead Of Night' a must-see.",1249257600,11,3116,5.563291139240507

This marvelously macabre film is based on a short story by Alexander Pushkin which is the same one used by Tchaikovsky for his opera of the same name. It stars Anton Walbrook (THE RED SHOES) and Dame Edith Evans in what marked her film debut at the age of 61. The story of a man who is obsessed with the secret of winning at cards and the woman who possesses that secret is turned into a tour de force by producer Anatole De Grunwald and director Thorold Dickinson who had earlier helmed the original version of GASLIGHT back in 1940. The movie is full of baroque chiaroscuro lighting and bizarre camera angles and looks like a cross between the films of Val Lewton and Orson Welles with a little Fritz Lang thrown in for good measure. The acting by Walbrook, Evans, and a cast of British stalwarts ranges from flamboyant to quietly repressed and suits the material perfectly. If you appreciate the old style of moviemaking where what you don't see will thrill you and all the filmmaking elements are combined to produce a delirious whole then this is the movie for you. It's a cliche' but they just don't make movies like this anymore. It is now available in a new transfer (Region 2 only) with an introduction by Martin Scorsese.

Coupled with it is DEAD OF NIGHT from 1945 which is one of the truly iconic films of psychological horror and only the second sound horror anthology film (after 1943's FLESH & FANTASY). Several people in an English country house tell a skeptical psychiatrist about weird occurrences that have happened to them in the hopes of convincing him of the existence of the supernatural. A new arrival claims to have dreamed it all before and that things will end badly. Of the five stories, two are now legendary. THE HAUNTED MIRROR directed by Robert Hamer (who would later do KIND HEARTS & CORONETS) which would become the template for every haunted mirror sequence after it (the David Warner episode in the Amicus anthology FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE strongly recalls it). Then there's the ventriloquist sequence with Michael Redgrave which would later become DEVIL DOLL in 1964 and MAGIC with Anthony Hopkins in 1979. Thanks to Anchor Bay for making this incredible package available. Both films have superb video transfers. The audio on DEAD OF NIGHT has never been ideal but this is the best it has ever sounded.

The audio was more ""horrid"" than the tales of ""horror"" told therein, with every male voice sounding like ""Leslie Howard on helium"" and every female like ""Billy Burke in a bubble""! 2.) The film destroyed all previous ignorant notions I had that Rod Serling and his writing staff on ""Twilight Zone"" were originator's, (despite the obvious ""evil dummy"" thing), when in fact they were merely a group of very creative/talented imitator's, (ie: ""Room for one more..?"")

334622,4,630154059X,"""Dead of Night"" is a mid 40's English paranormal horror type flick that succeeds in conveying it's supernatural theme.

Architect Walter Craig is played by Mervyn Johns, better known as Bob Crachit in the classic 1951 Scoroge, the finest version of Dickens' Christmas Carol.  He is called to a countryside farmhouse to do some renovations.  As he approaches in his car, the scenery somehow seems familiar.  He is speechless as he enters the farmhouse.  A group of people gathered there are characters he has seen in a recurring nightmare that he has been having.

Each person there has had some bizarre experience which they recount.  In effect the plot is a series of weird occurrences encountered by the members of the group at the farmhouse.  Frederick Valk playing psychiatrist Dr. van Straaten, one of the guests, tries to explain these tales scientifically. He recounts a strange tale of his own, featuring Michael Redgrave as a crazy ventriloquist.

The movie is rather amusing and has an effective twist at it's conclusion, very reminiscent of Rod Serling's classic Twilight Zone series.",1114387200,7,1095,5.072625698324022

334624,5,630154059X,"This is a classic. The film is very entertaining in its succession of paranormal stories that a psychiatrist questions systematically to propose explanations that are farfetched and have to be farfetched because he does not want to accept the idea that there may be some paranormal activities and events in the world. The whole range of such events is explored and leads to a very disquieting ending. What if what we consider the real world were nothing but an illusion, a nightmare, something happening in our own minds, something that only existed in our minds ? What if this dreamlike and nightmarish world became blocked on one particularly event ? What if psychosis were the real natural normal state of tle mind instead of what we generally call normality ? What if schizophrenia were nothing but enhanced consciousness and not some deranged illusion of the brain ? ETC. You will look at the world with different eyes after this film. You may even be tempted to go to sleep and finally enter the reality of a nightmare or just a plain dream. Do so and bring the reliefs of this nightmare or that dream into what you have so far considered and called the normal world. You will discover then that most people around you will consider you as a real nightmare and that you will consider them as either real dummies or real monsters from the dead of night. Anyway life will become a lot more interesting and fascinating.

334626,5,630154059X,"Fantastic pairing of two vintage British chillers and an immediate collector's item. Bravo Anchor Bay. 1.) 1946's ""Dead Of Night"" is an early anthology of supernatural tales told by a group of strangers at a country house to another stranger who has seen them all before----in a nightmare. Excellent cast, good exposition of stories that have been mimicked many times since but never this well. Best: the ""Haunted Mirror"" sequence and the final horror tale of Hugo the dummy with a brilliant performance by (Sir) Michael Redgrave as the tormented ventriloquist. This sequence features Elisabeth Welch, the singer later to be seen in the bizarre finale of Derek Jarman's equally bizarre ""The Tempest"". Good print, sometimes tinny sound but not that bad---it's really OK. Weakest sequence is the golfer's story that had been excised from previous prints. Still, it's interesting to see the adult aspects in this sequence not seen in American films of the time. And, in some of the other sequences, to hear ""hell"" used as a swear word so many times--- also taboo in 40's American films. 2.) 1949's ""Queen of Spades""---a film I had never seen before. Based on Alexander Pushkin's famous story, it tells of a Russian military officer in the 1800's who becomes obsessed with learning the ""secret"" of winning at Faro, a popular card game sweeping Europe at the time. He obtains a mysterious book on the occult that tells of a famous Countess who learned the secret but sold her soul to the devil in the process. The story is true so he tracks her down to learn her ""secret"" and finds her an aged, embittered but wealthy recluse with a pretty ward she's devoutly protective of. He surreptitiously woos the girl to get to the Countess with tragic results. He accidently scares the old lady to death when she won't talk. But her ghost comes back...with an offer he can't refuse. The details of this film---both in story content and visuals---are mesmerizing. It's darkly Gothic and creepy. The period setting is beautifully realized on film. Anton Walbrook and (Dame) Edith Evans are wonderful as the soldier and the Countess as are the rest of the cast. Brilliantly directed by Thorold Dickinson, this is a must see. A rare and unusual film for purists. Don't miss out on this worthy double bill DVD. Both films are classics to be sure but ""Queen of Spades"" is really something special.",1055808000,32,2377,4.857142857142857
334627,5,630154059X,"You've seen the plots if you ever watched The Twilight Zone or half a dozen other series which generously stole the idea from Dead Of Night.  But even if you are familiar with the tales, no film manages to invoke such fright as Dead Of Night.
A series of stories told by a group who are in an isolated English cottage on the moors, the suspense starts with the first tale and doesn't let up until the surprise, knock-out ending that beats them all.
Slightly Hitchcock in feel, the movie plays beautifully, even today, despite the lack of technological gimmickery.
Look for Sally Anne Howes in one of her first roles and a very young John Mills in the last tale.
Although the film does slow down with a comedic tale in the middle, it makes up for it with the John Mills episode.

334659,5,630154059X,"Dead of Night is one of the most stylish british films ever made. Five (no less) great tales of the supernatural. They are all great. The last one (about the ventriloquist who believes his doll to be alive) is one of the best madness-sequences ever made on film! This sequence is very famous and deserves to be seen many times. This is a film that will let you wondering about the all those great black and white TRUE horror films that we do not see today in the computer age. If you liked The Haunting (Robert Wise's original version) and Spirit of the Dead, this is a film for you: true psycological/supernatural horror.
Queen of Spades is not as famous as the other film, but it is also a true gem to be discovered. It tells the story of a russian officer who's obsessed with discovering the secret of winning at the cards. This obsession will have the most macabre implications. The production designer on this film is a true winner. So is the screenplay and the cinematography.
Here you have two great films for the price of one (positively two of the best films ever made by the Ealing Studios). Who can ask for more? The image on the DVD is fine on both films.

334665,3,630154059X,"This Ealing anthology is known primarily for including the episode with Michael Redgrave as a ventriloquist, yet what Pauline Kael in her 5001 Nights at the Movies collection made me aware of is that the 5 episodes were culled to 3 for the American release. Luckily the version I viewed included all 5. By the nature of employing different directors for the episodes, this kind of anthology is inevitably variable in tone, with the golfer's story being the prime example of someone trying for a supernatural tale with broad comic elements. Of course there is often unintentional humour to be found in gothic tales, but since none of the other 4 episodes deliberately attempts comedy, the 4th episode violates the notion of an accumulated feeling of horror. This isn't to say that the golfer's story doesn't have gothic touches, because it does, but it's evidence of the misguided thinking of the producer. Although often categorised as a collection of ghost stories, this is a misleading description. The premise is well known where an archiect is summoned to a country house where he feels he has met the inhabitants before, and it is the man's feeling of premonition of a ""nightmare of terror"" that allows the others to share their own stories of unexplained experiences, with a psychoanalyst with European accent present to provide the Freudian interpretations. Only the last 3 of the episodes qualify as fulfilled stories, since the 1st and 2nd read more as anecdotes, occupying less screen time and lacking any structure or payoff. And whilst the summation has references to all the episodes, the montage which made the reduced version's climax more unintelligible than it already is, is only salvaged by the capper, as evidence that a good idea doesn't have to be dressed up with expressionist effects. The Redgrave episode directed by Alberto Cavalcanti being the most critically acclaimed may have set my expectations too high, because I could only admire Redgrave sporadically. This may partly have something to do with modern standards of acting but also partly to do with my feeling about the performances his daughter Vanessa has given. Or perhaps I've seen the tale of the schizophrenic ventriloquist and his dummy too many times elsewhere. What I found more noteworthy in the episode was the dramatisation of a written police statement in a memory, and the concern of a witness to the threat of the dummy being harmed, as if the dummy was a living thing. The 4th episode of the golfer's story features a great image of a man drowning himself, a nice edit of a ghost disappearing then reappearing behind a man entering the same room, but an unsettling question after a nice payoff - just who told the teller the story? For me the best episode is the 3rd directed by Robert Hamer, about the mirror. Although Hamer overuses music, the fact that we know the person who is telling the story will not be harmed, the ludicrous representation of terribly polite English fiancees, and a speech being upstaged by the cloud of smoke the actor exhales, the narrative is the most compelling.",990921600,5,3092,4.91395793499044
334666,5,630154059X,"When people say something is typically English, they usually mean cricket and tea, or something reassuringly homely and middle-class.  'Dead of Night' is typically English, and uses many of the signifiers of the middle-class - the country house, the civilised meals and conversation, the professionals with the nice accents.
This Englishness, however, is far from reassuring - it is the disordered England of the ghost story (e.g. M.R. James), of Lewis Carroll, and it looks forward to that extraordinary deconstruction of Englishness, 'The Avengers'.
This anxiety about 'Englishness' after the war is appropriately figured in the narrative, which emphasises a dream logic and a refusal of closure unusual in English culture as a whole.
'Dead of Night' is no mere anthology - the stories not only cohere in the framing story's nightmare, but each story is connected by doubles, mirrors and a disturbing connection between sex and death.  It's unique and remarkable - British cinema would rarely be so brave again.",982886400,,1013,5.285714285714286

It's old and, as such, doesn't strike a cord with our modern sensibilities (just watch the segment about the two golf players and you'll know what i mean). But in a way, that's good. It's like sitting around with your friends in the... ahem... dead of night and telling each other ghost stories. They may not have a lasting effect on you but when you're there, in the moment, they work under your skin. The movie is more fun than frightening. It also has the most amazing ending I have seen in a long time, more then a typical pay-off. It's like witnessing your own horrific nightmares all coming true at once. The last segment of the film is also it's strongest and deserves to be a classic all by itself, featuring Michael Redgrave as a ventriloquist fighting a losing battle with his evil dummy.

This is probably my favorite horror movie of all time. Long before horror movies had to rely on blood and gore at the moment viewers would least expect it, this movie sent chills up my spine and gave me goosebumps just by virtue of its use of the power of suggestion, as well as endings and twists in the stories one wouldn't expect - particularly the ending of the film.

As far as I know, this is the first movie to have portrayed the ventriloquist and dummy story, which has now been re-told a number of times, but never better than here with the superb and subtle Sir Michael Redgrave playing the ventriloquist who becomes increasingly unhinged as his dummy becomes increasingly ""human.""

There are a number of tales here, and the more amusing stories were a lesser point for me. There are, however, a number of stories that, in writing this review right now and thinking about those stories, are giving me chills.

This is the ""thinking man's and woman's"" horror movie, and I recommend it without qualification if you want to be frightened and prompted to think about the supernatural in a way without any blood or guts involved.
