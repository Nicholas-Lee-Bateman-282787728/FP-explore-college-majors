1808535,3,B00007G1Y5,"This 1971 giallo from Umberto Lenzi has never been released in the US in any form until this welcome Shriek Show release.  The film itself is somewhat average as far as giallos go - the cinematography is nice, there's a black-gloved killer, some violent murder scenes (one with a power drill!), and some nudity to spice things up ---- but the mystery itself is pretty substandard and doesn't really have much punch.  I also guessed the killer the first time that character appeared on screen - maybe I've just seen too many of these things.
Still, if you're a giallo fanatic or euro trash junkie, this disc is a no-brainer and you need to buy it.  The anamorphic transfer looks great (bar some minor EE and shimmering around vertical lines or plaid clothing) and there's another great score by Riz Ortolani that will have you groovin' in no time.  Extras include a 10 minute interview with Lenzi and a short interview with one of the female victims.  Plus, the trailer and one for ""Spasmo"" and ""Eaten Alive"", liner notes, and a brief ""art gallery"".
So, it may not be one of the best giallos out there, but it still has a lot to offer.  Check it out.",1048118400,20,1149,4.526570048309178
7975924,1,B00007G1Y5,"I wonder what film the other reviewers saw that they garner with such praise, this is a dull 'thriller' that doesn't have anything new to
offer. It is lacking in terror, music or even atmosphere and anyone
with half a brain can guess already who the killer is. It isn't really
even a ""giallo"" type film because it lacks anything pertinent to that
type. Lenzi meanders from point A to point B fairly rapidly, minus the
chills one normally gets from any ""creepy moments"" or sustained plot.
He has the boring clichs to ""inform"" the audience (a news station, a
car radio, talking about the murders). A routine everyman (Sabato) is
uninspired in the lead role, how the killer never managed to kill him
or the dumb waif he is protecting is beyond intelligence. The film
lacks excitement and therefore it is only ""average"", just barely at
that even. And be prepared for the biggest let down when the killer is

A killer responsible for a series of brutal murders leaves behind some telltale hints that he plans to carry out seven ritualistic slayings.  Evidence at the scene, in the form of a few half-moon lockets, leads police to a young innocent named Mario.

As Mario and a beautiful young woman named Giulia try to solve the killings themselves, they realize that the killer seems to anticipate their every move.",1308873600,,421,4.901408450704225
7975926,5,B00007G1Y5,"People who have never seen this movie or many of umberto's lenzi's other movies from the seventies wouldn't expect that he was capable of true greatness in the thriller/horror/giallo genre. But this is one of the best giallos ever made.  Lenzis last efforts were much weaker and after watching lets say 'black demons"" people might dismiss Lenzi as average director only. They would be wrong! This movie is among the best giallos ever made. It's better than his really cool giallo 'eyeball"" from 1975 and that is a must watch for giallo fans.  This is the place where Lenzi was able to do everything right and this sits up at the top of the whole genre.  The other reviewers can give the grit on this movie and they did a great job of that.  So why throw in another review?  Just to say that this movie proves that Umberto Lenzi did have moments of brilliance and this movie is well worth owning even if you don't collect lenzi movies.",1224892800,2,934,4.502958579881657
7975927,4,B00007G1Y5,"I was very leery about watching ""Seven Blood Stained Orchids,"" which was directed by Umberto Lenzi; the man responsible for directing several infamous cannibal gore fests.  When the end credits rolled, I was quite pleased.  ""Seven Blood Stained Orchids"" was a beautiful giallo with a beautiful cast of big name stars.  Marisa Mell of Mario Bava's ""Diabolik"" played a dual role; she was the victim of the famous electric drill.  Another victim was played by Marina Malfatti, a perennial giallo queen who also starred in ""The Night Evelyn Came out of the Grave"" and ""The Red Queen Kills Seven Times.""  Antonio Sabato was eye candy for the ladies.  ""Seven Blood Stained Orchids,"" with its gorgeous psychedelic settings and trendy fashions, reminded me of a Dario Argento or Mario Bava movie.  During most of the movie, all you could see of the killer was his trademark black gloves.  The murders were bountiful and creative as they usually are in an Italian giallo.  I am definitely adding ""Seven Blood Stained Orchids"" to my collection.  It is on a par with any giallo that was directed by Dario Argento, Mario Bava, Lucio Fulci, or Antonio Margheriti.  However, I was a little disappointed when the killer's identity was finally revealed.  Thus I am only giving it four stars.",1203033600,2,1275,4.906542056074766

7975930,3,B00007G1Y5,"Director Umberto Lenzi is responsible for some of the most horrific gore movies from Italian cinema, but prior to all that he did turn out this good looking giallo. Fans of Lenzi - if anyone is brave enough to claim to be one after watching ""Cannibal Ferox"" or Nightmare City""- might find this movie to be rather more restrained than expected, but to be fair it does pre-date the splatter era by nearly a decade.

Following the well trodden formula of the genre, the plot sees a beautiful young woman hounded by a black-gloved killer, who wants to assassinate her as part of a mysterious vendetta against a group of seemingly random women. As usual, the police turn out to be more of a hinderance than a help, so she and her husband undertake their own investigations and the clues soon start pointing the way towards an explanation, but not before more victims start piling up. If that sounds familiar, well, sadly it is. Although this is a competent and good looking film, it runs so unwaveringly from the standard giallo template that it barely stands out from the many other examples around on DVD. Neither overly gory or particularly frightening, it is nevertheless full of stunningly beautiful women and lots of groovy early seventies fashions. The photography is also excellent, with many good widescreen compostions and luxuriant deep focus.

Sadly the mysterious title, and the murderers habit of leaving a metal talisman at the scene of each murder both sound pretty intriguing, but neither lead to anything very exciting in the plot revelations. Still, it does have a few good ideas, spicing up the plot by having two of the killers attacks foiled by unexpected circumstances. And a surprisingly brutal murder with an electric drill hints at the pathway both this genre and Lenzi himself were capable of going down in later years.

An enjoyable thriller, but not exceptional enough to stand out from the crowd. I wouldn't make this first choice for anyone new to the giallo genre",1141689600,,1990,4.847058823529411
7975931,5,B00007G1Y5,"SEVEN BLOOD-STAINED ORCHIDS is a close second to Argento's excellent DEEP RED as my favorite giallo! Directed with flair and tension by Umberto Lenzi, who was best known for CANNIBAL FEROX/MAKE THEM DIE SLOWLY, EATEN ALIVE, and NIGHTMARE CITY, ORCHIDS tells the story of a killer who murders women in all kinds of gruesome ways (bludgeoning, drowning, strangling, and power-drilling) and leaves a silver half-moon locket in their hands. One victim (Uschi Glass) survives her attack and, together with her husband (Antonio Sabato), she finds a connection between herself and the other victims: They were all at the seaside hotel that she once managed. And the locket belonged to a guest that was also there one day.

To reveal anymore about SEVEN BLOOD-STAINED ORCHIDS would be unfair, as this film requires very little foreknowledge as possible. The story is engrossing from beginning to end, the performances are great, and the murder sequences rank up there with anything Bava or Argento (or even Fulci) has ever done. The power-drill sequence is the highlight for me; it was the inspiration for Abel Ferrara's DRILLER KILLER and murders with power drills were featured in THE TOOLBOX MURDERS and DePalma's BODY DOUBLE. And the music by Riz Ortilani is among the best music scores in EuroHorror history; it's right up there with the works of Ennio Morricone, Goblin, and even Bernard Herrmann. I'll even go as far as to say that ORCHIDS reaces the levels of Hitchcock!

Yes, Lenzi's film was more infulential than its obscurity might lead you to believe. I highly recommend this film to any horror or thriller buff!",1112140800,10,1617,5.029850746268656
7975932,5,B00007G1Y5,"Good god, I love Media Blasters! Every time you turn around, these guys are unleashing yet another depraved classic from years gone past. It seems that most of the stuff they release are Japanese anime flicks, a genre I haven't gotten into in a serious way yet, but they also make sure to release tons of gooey gorefests that send horror fans into paroxysms of joy. And they go out of their way (usually) to stuff the disc with plenty of supplemental materials like trailers, interviews, and commentaries. That doesn't sound like a big deal since lots of DVDs today contain extras, but it's a lot easier to find someone like Oliver Stone than it is to uncover the whereabouts of Ruggero Deodato or Umberto Lenzi. Heck, these guys actually locate cult favorites like George Eastman and Ivan Rassimov in order to interview them on camera! If you love films that delve deep into the inner recesses of shock cinema, Media Blasters is the place for you. Thanks to these guys, we can finally watch Lenzi's suspenseful giallo, ""Seven Blood-Stained Orchids,"" on DVD. I love gialli films--I've seen a bunch of them at this point--and I always find time to watch one more.

Fans of Eurohorror know Umberto Lenzi more for his cannibal and crime films, but the man makes a mean giallo too. ""Seven Blood-Stained Orchids"" possesses all the things a good giallo should, namely a black gloved killer, false leads, multiple grisly murders, plot twists, and beautiful, shrieking Eurobabes running all over the place. The problems start with the gruesome murder of the beautiful harridan Inez Tamborini (Gabriella Giorgelli), a crime that brings in Inspector Vismara (Pier Paolo Capponi) and his cohorts into the picture. At first the crime looks like just another slaying, but then a second murder provides a startling link hinting at the beginnings of a terrifying murder spree. The second victim, Kathy Adams (Marina Malfatti), runs into black glove at her house and promptly moves on to another plane of existence. More victims will follow throughout the film, including a patient at a mental asylum, Eleanor, who dies when the killer drowns her in a bathtub. The cops set up surveillance and other traps in an attempt to catch the killer, but continually fail to do so. Meanwhile, a teacher perishes in a confessional, and Anna Sartori (Marisa Mell) and her twin sister Maria discover that black glove isn't worried about discriminating between the two. There are more victims, including one on the wrong end of a drill, but the most important potential victim is Julia (Uschi Glass).

Julia and her husband Mario (Antonio Sabato) learn they are in trouble when the killer makes an attempt on her life but fails to finish the job. The authorities soon bring the two in on the case, hoping to use Julia as bait to draw out the killer. Ultimately this tried and true investigative method will work, but in the meantime Julia and Mario spend a great deal of time trying to figure out why this maniac is hunting down these specific individuals. It turns out that some years before all of these women were in the same place on the same day, a resort hotel, when a suspicious car accident claimed the life of a guest. Obviously, the killer has some connection to this event, and subsequent events show that the person donning the black gloves isn't sure which woman was responsible for the death of this guest. In true terminator fashion the criminal merely eradicates every female on the list, secure in the knowledge that he will eventually get the one who was in the car that night. The journey involved in unmasking the murderer is fraught with peril, as Mario and Julia must deal with an enigmatic informant with a photographic memory, Raffaele Ferri (Claudio Gora), and an odd priest (Renato Romano) who appears to know some things about the background of the case.

Like all decent gialli, it's tough to describe what's happening in ""Seven Blood-Stained Orchids"" without giving away the ending. Anyone and everyone could be a suspect, and the twists and turns encountered on the way to the conclusion keep the viewer constantly on their toes. It is safe to discuss the women and the stylish aspects of the movie, however. The highpoints of the film definitely include Uschi Glass, Gabriella Giorgelli, and Marisa Mell. All gialli contain at least one attractive actress, but this one has three extraordinarily beautiful women. Mell is nothing less than spectacular, on the same plane as veteran Eurobabe actress Edwige Fenech. These easy on the eyes actresses help propel the film through the inevitable slow spots. Just as important as the actresses are the stylish aspects of the movie. The scenes involving the cats, the drill atrocity, and a nifty elevator sequence involving one of the Satori sisters are all memorable scenes that help distinguish ""Seven Blood-Stained Orchids"" from lesser gialli efforts. I surprised myself by picking out the killer well before the movie concluded, something I can only occasionally do with these types of films on the first viewing.

There are plenty of extras on the disc. Poster stills, liner notes, and trailers for ""Eaten Alive,"" ""Spasmo,"" and ""Seven Blood-Stained Orchids"" put you in that Eurohorror frame of mind necessary for enjoying the feature. Too, interviews with actress Gabriella Giorgelli and Umberto Lenzi reveal some information about the making of the movie. The director explains that he got the idea for this movie from a Cornell Woolrich story, and that the imaginative death scene of Giorgelli's character brought praise from some cinematic bigwigs who liked how Lenzi photographed the carnage. ""Seven Blood-Stained Orchids"" is a must see for gialli fans and a great introduction to the genre for those viewers just starting out.",1104537600,8,5779,4.954639175257732
