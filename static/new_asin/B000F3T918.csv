2550533,5,B000F3T918,"Somehow I totally missed that it was PAL format.  Reviewers stated that.  Because the seller I chose had ""ships from the USA"" in bold, I thought it would be fine.  Nope.  So, I can watch it on my computer and hook up the laptop to the TV via HDMI.  I suppose one could copy it to the computer and somehow make a backup disc that would play.  I haven't figured that out, and I'm sure it is probably illegal.  Whatever.

The movie is great.  I wish they would have it on Amazon Streaming.  It is a well done BBC documentary, narrated/written/hosted by a native Venetian.  He brings personal insight to the history of Venice, as his family has lived there for 1000 years (can you imagine?)  He discusses past and present challenges that Venice faces.  It is beautifully filmed and written, and very informative.

There are 4 episodes, each about an hour long.

It is well worth watching, but do bear in mind that it will play on a computer dvd drive, but not on your DVD or Bluray players.  It is also available to watch in segments if you hunt through the most popular video sharing website.",1366156800,4,1089,4.424242424242424
2550534,5,B000F3T918,"i feel compelled to leave a thought or two on this amazing documentary.  i actually purchased this dvd through amazon uk several years ago.  the photography is stunning, the information is varied and fascinating.  and francesco da mosta?  well, what can one say?  francesco is an architect, a historian, and a lifelong venetian whose family have occupied venice for centuries.  who better to guide you through the beautiful, odd, and history making canals of this beautiful city?  his easy going charm, intelligence, and passionate love for the subject matter takes this far beyond the usual tourist video lecture.  and people, PLEASE, when reviewing a product...let's stick to the product.  not the seller, not the shipping, and not the fact that you didn't know that PAL format wouldn't work on your dvd player.  leave those for the seller reviews.  downgrading this video based on those criticisms is just not fair.  if you have a region free player and you have even a passing interest in venice or italy, european history, art, or architecture; buy this.  you will not be sorry that you did.",1360022400,4,1096,4.956043956043956
2550535,1,B000F3T918,"Had the same experience as other viewer - could not play this video on any machine or computer, as it was encoded for region outside of US (in this case, China).  Had to return, but was very pleased with prompt and hassle-free refund from seller.  Disappointed that I could not see this video, as it was one I had really looked forward to.",1352246400,,339,4.365079365079365
2550536,1,B000F3T918,The product description did not say that this could not be played on Region 1 DVD players (US).  I was very disappointed!,1344816000,5,121,4.5
2550537,5,B000F3T918,"This was a very interesting series about Venice, especially since it was told from the point of view of a native Venetian from an old family. I especially appreciated that the author did not stop with the end of the Republic but continued on until the present day.

One caveat for potential buyers, the version that was sold to me was in PAL format instead of NTSC. I had to go to the trouble to find the code that allowed my DVD player to play all regions. This will not work with all players so take note.",1342137600,12,507,4.22680412371134

8116954,4,B000F3T918,"These DVD's are really great to learn about the history behind Venice.  My wife made me order this and I'm glad she did because I used to be a history buff and it's made me look forward to visiting this city alot more!  Especially the bit about the Venetians' invasion of Constantinople, their involvement with the crusades, this was all very interesting!  The flashback scenes are very well done as well, adding a nice bit of flavor to the historic segments.

Francesco is a quite charming and informative tour guide, I would love to have him guide us around when we visit, as long as I could keep him away from my wife (haha). I recommend this DVD to anybody considering a visit to Venice in the future.  It will give you an educational glimpse into the cities rich history and make you want to visit even so much more.",1470009600,,821,4.446666666666666
8116955,5,B000F3T918,"I had no idea of the history of Venice and Francesco tells it all, keeping it interesting, informative and fun.",1460160000,,111,4.6
8116956,3,B000F3T918,"Nothing special. First of all the transfer is from VHS which already not for everybody. Too much attention to history instead too much attention to Venice itself. Not enough Venice itself and no modern Venice at all like shopping, buildings and arts and inside building. I go to Venice often and don't have much of a chance to visit all these old buildings like where Bond movies been made or Emmanuelle's movies and I am sure other strange happenings.",1438387200,,452,4.734177215189874
8116957,5,B000F3T918,"A Venice lovers dream! Great production and cinematography. Francesco Da Mosto is the ideal host for this exquisite journey.
Unfortunately it's a region 2 DVD.",1425513600,,159,5.4
8116958,1,B000F3T918,you should let it be known it may not work on American dvd.  This one did not.,1420329600,,78,3.588235294117647
8116959,5,B000F3T918,The video is fantastic but you have to be sure to work around the UK region code to play it on your DVD or computer in the US.  I did not want to risk hacking into my DVD player so I changed the region code on my computer and watched it that way.  A little inconvenient but worth it to view the series.  Very well done.,1405296000,,319,3.803030303030303
8116960,5,B000F3T918,"We have planned a trip to Venice and wanted some background; it is difficult to share reading experiences so we opted for this DVD set which came recommended by friends.  It was great - the way Francesco integrated the modern Venice with it's historical past was well conceived and held our attention throughout.  Although he obviously knows a lot about the city, he was wise enough to not bore his audience with too much detail.  It is a very well balanced view and has made us look forward to our visit with great anticipation.",1396828800,,529,4.6063829787234045
8116961,4,B000F3T918,The video shows the History and present of Venice. Francesco is a character that makes his videos from a locals view point which even makes it more enjoying. The only reason for a four star rating and not a five is that it only comes on the PAL format so I had to buy a all region Blu-ray player.  It is five stars with the all region player.,1383696000,,342,4.029411764705882
8116962,5,B000F3T918,Excellent. Perfect to view BEFORE a trip to venice.  We did and knowing the history and unique nature of this island city added to our enjoyment of the time we spent in Venice.  Well done!,1383177600,,188,4.3428571428571425
