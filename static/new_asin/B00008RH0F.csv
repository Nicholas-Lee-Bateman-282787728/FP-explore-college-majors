Basically you're watching a Chinese cop movie or whatever with some white guys dress up as ninjas (that's obviously the edited part)! But why you should buy this is becuz of Fight Among the Supers! Fight.... is a great kung fu movie! it's about these two gods (god of chopsticks and god of bowls) who take on students and teach them kung fu so they them to fight each other to see whos a better kung fu master (on the part of the gods of course)! The fight scenes were great! It's some of the best crap you'll see in early 80's kung fu cinema!

The picture for the movie is crisp clean, in original language and the subtitles come out good! It's Chinese and Engish subs. The dvd plays how it should! no extras but $10 is worth it! Supers is great and Ninja is good laughs!",1107734400,3,845,4.216049382716049
