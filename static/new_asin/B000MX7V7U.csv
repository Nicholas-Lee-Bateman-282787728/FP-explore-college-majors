8173558,4,B000MX7V7U,"I bought this for Lantern Hill as I already own the other two movies.  I love Avonlea and most everything from Sullivan entertainment.  Colleen Dewhurst is one of my all time favorite actresses and I buy everything she's in.  I was a little disappointed in this movie, Lantern Hill but I probably will, at some point in the future, watch it again.",1413072000,,347,4.564516129032258
8173559,5,B000MX7V7U,"I actual purchased this set just to have Lantern Hill.  When I was a kid it was on PBS along with Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Avonlea and I loved anything to do with Prince Edward Island.  I recorded it off TV and now finally have a ""real"" copy!  The acting was surprisingly good and it was fun to see some familiar Canadian actors in all three of the films.  Sam Waterston is wonderful in this film as a preoccupied father who seeks to know his estranged daughter.  And Colleen Dewhurst is as brilliant as ever.  The story is better than i remembered and the acting is actually quite good on all fronts.  I would recommend this set for this film alone.

Road to Avonlea was very fun.  I had actually never seen it before despite my love of Green Gables.  It reminded me on the playfulness of the Anne books.  If you enjoyed the books I think you would enjoy this film.

The Wild Pony worried me because I don't do well with films that show any harm to animals and I almost turned it off when they grabbed a gun to shoot the pony, but I am glad that I finished the film.  It was about dreams and the struggles to achieve them and the joy of working together and help coming in unexpected ways.  A few areas seemed rushed in the story where it was like ""yeah right"" she would do that.  But for a family film it was alright and I will probably watch it again.",1408665600,2,1362,4.145038167938932
8173560,5,B000MX7V7U,There are three movies in the collection and they are all family orientated. I would highly recommend these movies that like good old family movies.,1351900800,,148,4.96

8173562,3,B000MX7V7U,"This set contains three ""family"" type movies.  The first, Jane of Lantern Hill, was a well known and loved movie and DVD for me, and I still love it; the ensemble cast is marvelous and Sam Waterston does his usual stellar job.  I had seen the Wild Pony years ago but forgotten what an enjoyable movie it is -- how a family comes to be from a tragedy.  The Road to Avonlea -- quite possibly one of the worst movies of all time.  The children in the movie were just going through the motions, the adult characters were incredibly dense and every scene was predictable.  However, for the first two movies, the set is more than worth the and I recommend this set for those.",1286582400,2,669,4.32
