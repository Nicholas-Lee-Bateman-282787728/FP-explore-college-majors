7952605,3,B00005RIZX,"I have seen the whole cell games saga before and this is by far a saga that many dbz fans and collectors should buy. The episodes on this dvd start the beginning of the cell games. The first two episodes on this disk show the world champion, mr. satan fight cell along with his pupils who are quite strange. This is a pretty good dvd if you are trying to buy the whole cell games saga. this is one of those dbz dvds that does not have much action, but it has some comedy in it.",1087430400,2,477,3.9791666666666665
