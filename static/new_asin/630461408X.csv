7875327,5,630461408X,"Life for our heroes suddenly gets really stressful when Data's head is discovered in a cavern and is dated 500 years old.  Of course, everyone begins to get depressed about Data's soon-to-come death, except Data of course (being, by his nature, stoical).  But, anyway, the Enterprise crew immediately heads off to Devidia II (thanks to a clue they found on earth) to try and figure out what's going on.  Well, Data ends up going back into time with some aliens and finds himself in the late 1800's on Earth.  The humor is quite good, with Data beating some poker players easily, him lifting and anvil and then pretending that he strained himself, etc.  Of course, everyone is basically on the panic back on the Enterprise with Data disappearing (they didn't know what happened to him since he was out of phase when it happened), so they decide to follow him.  The scene ends with everyone (except Worf, who's back on the Enterprise, which is a good thing since it would be hard to explain to a 19th century person about Klingons) walking through a time portal.  Overall, a pretty good episode.",1157414400,,1093,4.69109947643979
