1199425,4,B00000EZWG,"This collection of 21 ""You Bet Your Life"" episodes offers an excellent sampling of Groucho Marx's 1950s quiz show. A technical note: The video producers have restored the original network titles to the films, but  a few of the episodes were edited (by some TV station, before the video  company got them), so some of Groucho's interviews are disappointingly  short. Still, there's lots of fun here. Groucho and the underrated George  Fenneman are very enjoyable, and between the quiz and the comedy, you'll  probably watch more than one episode in one sitting.",944611200,14,560,5.043478260869565

7906011,5,B00000EZWG,"This guy was beyond his years, some of the shows are hilarious. He is quick witted and the funny part is the audiences back then didn't quite get his jokes, its funnier now than when it first aired I'm sure.",1343606400,,207,4.2
7906012,1,B00000EZWG,"I wish the DVD producers would get organized and list the episodes by the date they originally aired, the secret word for each episode, and the names of the first two guests, on both the DVD covers and on Amazon and other sales web sites, so collectors of ""YOU BET YOUR LIFE"" episodes can figure out which ones they have, and which ones they still need to buy,

Far too many 'YOU BET YOUR LIFE"" DVDs are just re-hashes of the same episodes that have appeared on other DVDs, and VHS tapes, repackaged with different artwork and names for the covers, some leaving out some episodes to cash in on the interest in ""YOU BET YOUR LIFE"" episodes by splitting them into multiple volumes from larger compilations.

Several hundred episodes were filmed and aired over a period of almost 14 years, and so it's frustrating to find the same relatively few episodes cropping up again and again on almost every DVD compilation.

From the lack of any specific episode details, it looks like this is another one of those re-hash collections, and thus isn't worth the effort to buy.

Until it's re-released with the above-mentioned specifics about all the episodes contained in it, this gets only one star in my book.

7906015,5,B00000EZWG,"If you get a chance to buy any set of episodes, do it. Here is an example of part of one episode from memory.
I watched this when I was a teenager in the 50s. I caught a few episodes on cable around ten years ago. It wears well. Groucho was a master at the double entendre. Mae West had nothing on him. One example: there was a married couple who had 19 children. Groucho asked the man why they had so many kids. The man said it was because he liked his wife. Groucho replied, ""I like my cigar too, but I take it out once in a while."" This was more than 40 years ago, it is still timely. Watch it, if you can. You won't regret it.
Incidentally, the quiz questions aren't all that easy, either.",1036108800,2,693,3.9928057553956835
7906016,4,B00000EZWG,"Four ""You Bet Your Life"" shows with Groucho in one of the two highlights of his career (the other one was the movies). What can I say? Groucho was a genius and in this edition there is pure Groucho. Except one sentence (""Duckie, drop your eggs on Fenneman"") there is no classic moment in the four programs which are recorded on the DVD (they seem to have been selected randomly) but it has not importance: Groucho is great anyway. So, for Marx Bros. aficionados this item is pure delight.
The image quality is not very good, but this is a minor fault:
these are a very old TV shows, and the existing prints must be very used.
A joy.",1017014400,8,632,4.319327731092437
7906017,3,B00000EZWG,"Let's face it; if you're a fan of this genius, you could see scratchy 8mm silent home movies of the back of his head and be entertained & fulfilled. However, this DVD is simply a recording of three shows made in the early 60s (the show originally started in the 50s) so it was near the end of it all and was probably Groucho at his best (older & slower in years, but still quick-witted and sharp as a fish knife).
I was disappointed that this DVD wasn't clever extracts from that whole decade that the show ran; instead it was simply three recordings, albeit classic ones. Even the commercial breaks were missing (which would have been kewl to leave in to add to the whole 60s ambiance).
Fans expecting the famous 'cigar' quip (""...but Groucho I love my wife..."" to which he replied ""...I love my cigar, but I take it out once in a while..."") will be disappointed. It ain't here, guyz.",991958400,15,885,4.402439024390244
7906018,5,B00000EZWG,"Some of the funniest things Groucho ever said were not all on the silver screen. This collection of some of Groucho's best shows as host of ""You Bet Your Life"" are priceless. I watch them over and over again so I can feel how it is to laugh at humor and not bodily functions made in poor taste like comedy tends to be now. Worth every penny and not easy to find in a regular video store.",981763200,12,387,4.038961038961039
7906019,5,B00000EZWG,"This is a must for Groucho fans.  I researched the 'Net for ""You Bet Your Life"" tapes and this was the most comprehensive set I could find.  What a find it is!!  The first time I watched this series, I would only let myself watch one episode a day, knowing that I had a limited supply of episodes.  I have now watched the series three times, and I have no plans to leave it in the back of my video collection any time soon.
Each guest is interviewed for a while before they play the actual game.  During these interviews, you not only see people from a generation that is almost extinct, but also Groucho's wit and quick mind at full force.  No matter what the circumstance, he is always ON and ready for more.  (Side note: It is particularly interesting to look at the guests and see what they understood and what made them laugh.  This series indirectly allows you to meet people who have lived through WWII - and some through WWI.)
You will have terrific fun watching this.  I would recommend it to anyone who has an interest in Groucho, the Marx Brothers, or jumping in a time machine to see what it was like in the middle of the last century. (The game show questions are fun to play along with, too!)",978307200,10,1206,4.300884955752212
