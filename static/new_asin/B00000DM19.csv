I love Jonathan Winters and his ability to improvise.  This video doesn't contain anything of his normal comical ideas!

Winters starts out as a nursing home resident being interviewed by Gary Owens.  Winters starts telling about a fishing trip that happened 20 years prior.  Each segment is about a part of the fishing trip:  filling up his car with gas, eating at a nearby restaurant, buying bait, getting to the river, talking to a fishing guide, etc.  The people at each of these locations are Winters SUPPOSEDLY doing comic sketches.  Nothing could be further from the truth!

Each segment is dumber than the one before.  There's no comedy.  Just stupid unscripted dialog.  Combine this with a running ""gag"" (NOT) of a banjo player being at each location.  Doesn't make sense and is very annoying, to say the least.

Don't waste your money on this!",1505174400,,872,4.843537414965986
