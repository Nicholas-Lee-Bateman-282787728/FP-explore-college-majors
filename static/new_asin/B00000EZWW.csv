1199460,5,B00000EZWW,"Absolutely love this movie.  Of course Roy and Dale are great in this movie but Gabby Hayes had be in tears laughing.  Love the interview with Roy, Dale and Dusty (Roy Jr.) prior to the movie.  Also, the bio feature of Roy, Dale and their family is a reason in itself to get this DVD.",1388448000,,284,4.127272727272727
1199461,5,B00000EZWW,I have watched this movie more than once. Always get a kick seeing Roy Rogers and Gabby Hayes. It was a good role for Gabby! I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a Roy Rogers fan!,1366416000,,188,3.973684210526316
1199462,4,B00000EZWW,I chose this rating because the Happy Trails Theater version edits out some of the film content in order to accommodate the memory lane chats with Roy and Dale at the beginning.,1363564800,,177,4.5625
1199463,4,B00000EZWW,"1945 was a very significant year in the history of the world, but certainly not for this movie. I was 10 years old & though my parents did not go to see this movie, the song, ""Don't Fence Me In"" was very popular & became engraved in my heart along with ""Tumbling Tumbleweeds.""Since I grew up in southern CA, I saw many tumbling tumbleweeds & I am happy now to have finally seen the movie - even though it is not a particularely good movie I am giving it 4 stars just for sentimental reasons.",1327363200,,491,4.178947368421053
1199464,5,B00000EZWW,"Roy, Dale, and the Sons sing Cole Porter and The Sons sing ""Tumbling Tumbleweeds.  Dale is a big city newspaper photographer posing as a nightclub singer-dancer. Gabby leads a double life as a (supposedly dead and buried) dangerous outlaw, ""Wildcat Kelley.""  Dale is there to get the story but gets Roy into the bargain.  Much better to see a good ""bad"" movie from the ""innocent"" good old days than a bad ""good"" movie from today.

A scholarly friend of mine wrote the following about the movie:

 I watched the whole DVD today including the interview with Dusty Rogers. It was all so great! Gabby Hayes is such a fine actor and comedian. The Sons of the Pioneers were superb! I love that part of the script where Gabby tells the governor that the stolen money paid for the building churches and schools and for things to make a better community. It reminded me of Milton Hershey who had five major civil improvements built in Hershey, Pennsylvania at the depth of the Great Depression so that no Hershey Chocolate employee would be unemployed and because the city needed the improvements. In our current Corporate Greedopoly, you not only fire all your employees and send their jobs to China, but you use the profit to buy an island in the Caribbean, so that your profits will not be taxed in America. We have gotten a long way from the ideals of those old westerns!",1312502400,4,1366,4.62396694214876

1199466,5,B00000EZWW,Just brings back memories of childhood. Get this one rather than the 'Roy Rogers Theatre' version. No idle chat or cuts. Lovely!,1173312000,3,128,4.863636363636363
1199467,5,B00000EZWW,"The children of the 1940's loved Roy Rogers. He was the leading box-office cowboy for 10 years. However times were slower then. ""The Little Rascals / Our Gang"" series of the 1930's is a wonderful series, loved by children and adults of the time; but also made when times were slower. Children and adults today, may not have the patience and appreciation for the charm of ""Roy Rogers"" and the old ""Little Rascals"".

Roy Rogers was everything in real life that he plays in the movies. You like Roy Rogers films; if you like Roy. The stories are pleasant, and hold your attention; but not as exciting compared to today's special effects. Many of his films have similar plot style. Some of his stories, like the sheriff being crooked, with a gang of deputies that robs every gold shipment from the mines, with the town helpless, except for the arrival of the hero, seemed far-fetched. However, I later read a historical biography that told this same true story. It was true. Reality is sometimes stranger than fiction.

Roy was the best, in real life and on film, he was the best singer, always some good songs, the best yodeler,(he yodels in his songs in a couple films), he had true close, life-long, friendships with many of his on-screen friends, he was a great shot, and a real hunter, best outfits, his horse, which he owned in real life, did lots of tricks, his hard to win love, Dale Evans, took some effort for him to win in real life, but became a true and romantic love, and his wife. Roy was quite the athlete, he could walk for an hour on his hands. Roy was a good guy in real life, visiting children's hospitals throughout all the States.

Reading about Roy and Dale's off-screen lives, in their great book, ""Happy Trails"", makes their films endearing. The book tells how Dale was not at first interested in the real, cowboy, Roy; because she wanted to be a glamorous, city, singer, (it is best to read it) however, in summary, Roy does save her in a real life, adventure, incident, sweeping her off her feet. Their romance on-screen plays so interesting; because of their true romance off-screen.

I like the ""Happy Trails Theatre"" versions best. (This is such a version). A before and after segment, made many years later, is hosted by Roy and Dale, in their later years. They always have a guest.

The ""Dont Fence Me In"" song in this film is a good song.

I have seen 40 Roy Rogers films, and liked them all. Roy and Dale were good people, of an era gone by, the era of Walt Disney and Shirley Temple. Roy's films, not found here, can be found on RoyRogers dot commmmmm. ""The Television Collection Vol. 2"" of Roy's has excellent songs, with guests, and is a pleasant surprise.",1157760000,7,2689,4.545454545454546
1199468,2,B00000EZWW,"Don't Fence Me is a 5-star Roy Rogers-Dale Evans movie which runs 71 minutes (B&W). This Happy Trails Theatre version cuts out  about 19 minutes from the original movie. (An introduction and closing remarks with Roy and Dale done for TV in the 1980's adds about 12 minutes, but the film itself runs about 49 minutes in this eviscerated Happy Trails incarnation.)

The original version of Don't Fence Me In became available in 1998 on Republic VHS  AIBN B00000EZWW. The audio on the Happy Trails DVD reviewed here is cleaner, raising hopes for an authentic DVD restoration of the whole film at some point. The 2 stars for this DVD are for better-than-nothing and the audio improvement. However, since songs such as Along the Navajo Trail have been edited out, along with much of the comedy--a 13 minute continuous segement is missing-- much of the benefit of better audio is lost. Get the Republic (not the Happy Trails) VHS instead for a delightful 1945 matinee classic.",1090540800,42,970,4.831325301204819
1199469,4,B00000EZWW,"The quality of this video is very good from both visual and sound aspects.  In addition this is a full length version with a running time of over 70 minutes as opposed to the 54 minute TV version found in some earlier video  releases.  This is one of the very best Roy Rogers films.  An outstanding  performance as the retired outlaw Wildcat Kelly by ""Gabby"" Hayes  adds considerably to the value of this film.  This is a must for Roy  Rogers' fans",950054400,28,448,4.378048780487805

1199495,4,B00000EZWW,"For a ""Roy Rogers B Western"", this was a surprisingly well done movie.  Some decent acting from Rogers and Hayes, and Dale Evans showed some real vocal talent (and some pretty nice legs).  Soundtrack better than the norm for Rogers flicks, and not as overdone as they'd become in later years.  The Amazon Prime version I watched was complete, not the heavily-massacred-for-TV 55 minute version.  All in all, a pleasant throwback for this 60+ viewer who, like many of my generation, grew up loving those 40's and 50's westerns and war movies before the turbulent 60's put many of the entertainers and former fans on opposite sides of political fences.",1409443200,,650,4.881818181818182

7906091,5,B00000EZWW,"This is a fun movie.  I love the chemistry between Dale and Roy.  Dale is so cute and in the beginning of the movie she doe a wonderful performance singing and dancing on top of a dining room table.  She's undercover for a tabloid type magazine to get the goods on a group of upstanding men with sleazy ideas.  Her performance is superior. Then on to Roy and Gabby in the midwest.  It's a feel good movie that I probably saw as a child but didn't realize how cute and entertaining this movie is for adults.  I love Trigger and he and Roy do their share of chasing the bad guys.  It's pure entertainment and a fun movie.  Roy and Dale couldn't get any better.  I understand that this movie and Trigger, Jr. are Dale's favorite of all the movies she made with Roy.",1454198400,2,762,4.236111111111111
