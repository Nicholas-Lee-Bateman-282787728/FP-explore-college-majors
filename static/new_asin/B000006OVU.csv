7904619,2,B000006OVU,"for the likes of it I was expecting a nice sci-fi, fighting movie with a lot of good stuff but then it turned into a mushy tale. This one is about Rutger Hauer and he is killed by his friend played by Mark Dacoscos and then he is brought back to life by scientists so he can kill his nemesis. sort of like The Crow as Hauer is killed and then he is brought back to life to avenge his death. theres nudity in this one",1066348800,,416,3.8488372093023258

Men: I caught most of this movie at 2:00 in the morning, on basic television, and it was so sweet! You see, there's such a generous helping on unecessary t&a, even edited it still extremely easy on the eyes. Beyond that, it has good production quality for what looks to be El Cheapo foreign fare (filmed entirely in Hungary, with 90% of the cast's names unpronouncable). Rutger Hauer is fun as always, though I was surprised by how much weight he's gained. He's also unusually clumsy-looking, although that's a common problem with the poor stunt choreography here. Still, it's an okay actioner, with true nonsense sci-fi trappings...",998870400,,728,4.879032258064516
