2807224,3,B000P1UCM0,"I think the movie should have spent forty to fifty minutes on the astronauts' reactions to waking up two centuries later and their experiences in returning to Hollywood's agricultural fantasy Earth that plagued sci fi in the 70's. This movie IS a composite of two episodes, one about devolving intellects thru the miracle of cloning (not a bad concept but demanding of its own movie), and the second is about game wardens turned religious zealots (a striking parallel to today's government obsessed with using an environmental iron fist to control individual behavior; or global warmers turned religious nutjobs, just replace the nature of your god and rule the world...bwa-ha-ha-ha!).

Dumbest scene is when our female star gets weepy-eyed and sets a baby goat free from a trap and then gets defensive when the psycho game wardens accuse her of poaching (and for some reason throw her into a makeshift cage, naked and scared); though I appreciate the feelings the character had in trying to rescue a defenseless animal, it is the high point of human conceit and intellectual bankruptcy to come into someone else's house (or game preserve), fiddle around until things are to YOUR liking and not expect reprisal equal to or greater than your actions. Every action has an equal but opposite reaction and nature still rules by survival of the fittest. Environmentalist seem to miss this simple equation and even simpler law on conservation. Maybe its an inconvenient truth they choose not to accept. It makes me laugh even more while I write this.

Now, eating goats? Yuck.

Anyhoo, it stars John Saxon, oen year after Planet Earth (the superior movie), five years before Battle Beyond the Stars, eight years before A Nightmare on Elm Street and eleven years before Prisoners of the Lost Universe; Saxon's personality commands screen time.",1351209600,,1836,5.052805280528053
2807225,1,B000P1UCM0,"I know the movie will be bad. I'm still debating the purchase, just to complete the set. Here's the way I heard it...

After the popularity of ""Star Trek"" in syndication, the studio asked Gene Roddenberry to come up with another series. He presented the idea for ""Genesis II."" It was shot and aired. In a moment of history repeating itself, the studio hated the movie, but liked enough of the idea that they asked GR to do it over. The result was ""Planet Earth,"" with John Saxon. Only this time, the studio hated the second attempt as well. As with the first, too much thought and philosophy, not enough violence and T&A. But once again, they liked the basic premise.

So, they threw out GR, and did it the way they wanted. ""Strange New World"" was the result. According to the article I read, it was so horrible that it was never aired. The movie was shelved and hasn't been seen since.

SIDEBAR: If that's true, you have to wonder just how bad ""Strange New World"" could possibly be if the studio went on to not only create and air, but shoot multiple seasons of the abomination ""Andromeda."" Surely ""Strange New World"" can't be THAT bad... Can it?

So the question isn't whether or not the movie is any good. The question is this: I have ""Genesis II"" and ""Planet Earth."" Should I complete the set?",1334880000,4,1297,4.459915611814346
2807226,1,B000P1UCM0,"As most children of the sixties and seventies... I loved these movies. I love Gene Roddenberry and Star Trek... However, I've found, especially with Genesis II, Planet Earth, and Strange New World... Like most people watching them again years later, that my memories were far more FOND of these video's than they're really worth! The money spend on these disc's was FAR and AWAY the worst money I've ever spent. I guess they need to be sure and get it from those few of us whom remember these movies while they can. My advice? Wait until they are on Amazon for dirt cheap before wasting your time and money. Better yet... see if they're on Amazon Instant Video... and watch them there! You'll be glad you did!

That being said, the audio and video were pretty good, considering, when watching these as a kid, we had a ""rabbit ear"" antennae set up which meant half of everything looked like watching out the window through the snow! However, the DVD-R recording meant I could only watch these on my newer DVD player...

If you can borrow these... get them cheap... or better yet, request they come on Turner Classic Movies... wait for them to be on there... Don't waist your money friends! Trust me!",1333152000,5,1198,4.619718309859155
2807227,1,B000P1UCM0,"STRANGE NEW WORLD is another two pilots for the GENESIS II/PAX series that Gene Roddenberry tried to get the networks to buy.  Unlike the other two pilots he made for this idea, these two pilots stank to high heaven.  Poorly scripted, badly acted, with minimal budget, these two pilots (in STRANGE NEW WORLD) should not have been made.  Don't waste your money on this piece of garbage (I wish that I hadn't).  PLANET EARTH and GENESIS II were GOOD pilots, and if you're looking for a Roddenberry effort along these lines, pick these two items up instead.",1329609600,3,554,4.680412371134021
2807228,5,B000P1UCM0,"I watched this when I was a boy. Naturally I was in love and wished to see the characters encounter more adventures as they searched for their own loved ones and the earth bound base. Alas, that was not to be (thanks to the networks). However, this story gave you a good ride. You get the p.o.v. of what it very well could be if the world was hit by asteroids; a devastated planet. The work is never actally stated as a part of the offical Star Trek universe that Gene Roddenberry wrote, but personally I always took it as such. Strange New World, Planet Earth: TV Movie (1974)and Genesis II (1973)created and produced by Gene Roddenberry and felt like they were all part of the same Star Trek world. Also, at around this time, the show Arc II, was an American live-action science fiction series aimed at children that aired on CBS beginning in 1976 as part of its Saturday morning line-up. These shows all seemed to fit together as one, even though it wasn't actally meant to. Bottom line is I recomend viewing these programs for yourself and just let yourself enjoy them, they were great!",1323388800,13,1090,4.51010101010101
2807229,3,B000P1UCM0,"If you were a bored 12 year old in the mid-70s this wasn't bad. At the time of it's airing I liked it. Early to mid 70s sci-fi on TV
frankly sucked. This was much more interesting then most of what I remember watching back then. The DVD is broken into two stories.
The first story of the clone colony was fair. Dated. It seemed to have borrowed from ""Zardoz"" a bit. The second story of the animal preserve was more interesting. Seemed more original then the first story. If tried today as a series, who knows. Maybe two sesaons. I liked it enough to keep on the shelf. View as you will.",1314921600,5,586,4.1946902654867255
2807230,5,B000P1UCM0,"This is a good family film, a sci-fi fan must have--life after a nuclear war has savaged the earth. The three surviving astronauts return to a completely different society--psychologically thrilling--What would you do in their place?",1314403200,15,233,5.5
2807231,1,B000P1UCM0,"Strange New World...this Made-for-TV movie was terrible.

It's one of three attempts by Gene Roddenberry to get a new series after Star Trek.  The other two being ""Genesis II"" and ""Planet Earth""...I believe the release order went Genesis II, Planet Earth & Strange New World last.  All have the same premise with different characters and different stories...Strange New World deviating more from the original two (which are both better).  Genesis II & Planet Earth are pretty much re-makes of each other...you can see Roddenberry tweaking what was probably a ""Pilot"" in an attempt to get a series pick-up.  The lead was changed to John Saxon in the second pilot and he reprises the role in Strange New World.

Strange New World is actually set up as if it's two episodes in one telefilm.  The first half deals with three astronaugts that return to Earth after being in suspended animation for 180 years.  In the mean time, Earth has been destroyed by a meteor shower and a colony of clones awaits our heroes.  The second half deals with a zoo that has de-evolved into a society of game wardens trying to protect the zoo animals from primitive poachers.

If you take all three films together, it's an interesting view of the refinement of a project, but as I said, Strange New World is the worst of the three in terms of story.",1281225600,55,1326,4.701298701298701
2807232,5,B000P1UCM0,"As well as I remember, it is a small group astronauts who travel in space in a long sleep(very planet of the apesesque) and wake up to a bazaar future on Earth and it plays out like levels in a game with one bazaar incodent after another.  I remember it well enough to know I liked the filming and the characters, though somewhat campy at moments, so was Star Trek(and all of it's high brow spin offs). So what?  Why is it no great classic cult films like this get released on DVD anymore???  Why the fancy price?  Because marketing is scarce! This VHS was released when VCRS were invented probably!  However, if enough reviews are posted on this site alone(amazon being a high profile venue across the planet) some hootzpa company like MGM might re-release this on DVD!(watchout for those humorless stairing hollywood execs  penatrating your cause in all Y2K ruthlessness though, whoever you are!)

A lot of opportunities there, but the networks were and remain pretty conservative -- if someone has a hit show, clones begin to appear. John Saxon, good actor, does his bit here, and a delectable Diana Muldaur is his temporary Mistress. Even has Ted Cassidy! Put on the popcorn and have fun.",1457913600,2,474,4.588235294117647
2807239,3,B000P1UCM0,This movie was apparently a pilot for a tv series by Gene Roddenberry that never got off the ground.  Slow paced and only a little interesting. Not his best work.,1456617600,2,162,4.4

2807243,3,B000P1UCM0,"By cinematic standards this is a B movie. The third attempt to bring a new Gene Roddenberry series to the small screen, this is is the one that ""The Great Bird Of The Galaxy"" removed his name from. It is NOT a great movie by any means, but as cheesy fun, it delivers. Two episodes, sort of linked together to make a full length feature; the two tales are full of SF tropes. The segment is quite reminiscent of ""Zardoz"" Saxon's red toga even bears a more than passing resemblance to Connery's red loin cloth. A tale of cloning set in a Neo-Roman world, it is chock full of cliches. Only a very talented cast led by James Olson, keeps things interesting. This segment moves at a nice clip. The ending, however, is a literal overkill. The second segment appealed to the teenage me a great deal when I first saw it in 1975. This segment drags a bit but has a delightful scene of implied nudity featuring the lovely Kathleen Miller. Be sure to move frame by frame through this sequence!
The picture and sound quality are great with almost no artifacts of age. I would recommend this disc to those who have fond memories of the first airing, those wanting a complete Roddenberry collection, or fans of John Saxon. If you are looking for mindless 70's SciFi, this movie is just the ticket.",1441324800,,1282,4.459574468085107

2807249,3,B000P1UCM0,"I remember watching this movie back when it first aired back in the 70's, probably liked it better then than I do now. On viewing it I find that I remember bits and pieces of the story.
Another unsuccessful attempt at making a pilot for a TV series we're never told ""when"" any of the story occurs, only that the three astronauts(?) wake up 180 years in the future. A short term suspended animation experiment is extended when Earth is struck by an asteroid shower, for some reason our heroes are set off on a deep space orbit for their safety. In a voiceover John Saxon's character tells the viewer that their families were also put into hibernation and now it's up to them to find them.
Look closely as our crew drives along in their vehicle and you'll see a calendar on the wall with the years 1994 and 2174- the only hint of ""when"" the story occurs. Two civilizations encountered (the first given more background information- an advanced, turns out to be clone based, group and a couple of tribal groups (one living in the ruins of a zoo usually with some unlikely to survive into that time animal somewhere in scene).
At least one reviewer thinks the DVD has been edited for length- I can't tell about that but the movie ends in a chopped off fashion. The color/ image is very good (except for some fairly common, and sometimes numerous, specks on screen. No captioning or subtitling, turn up the sound to get the dialog better and you're likely to get blasted when the music/FX sound comes up.
Viewing this is a way to use an otherwise wasted afternoon/ evening but you'll probably think there's no way ""Strange New World"" would ever have survived as a series.",1421884800,,1665,4.534883720930233

2807258,3,B000P1UCM0,"I had seen this when it first came out and had a VHS tape I made of it at the time. The tape wasn't very good and my VCR was pretty much shot, so I saw this print on demand service from Amazon and thought I'd give it a try.

I had no problem with the DVD-R playing on my player, and the picture quality, tho not as good as a commercial DVD, was far better than the VHS tape I had. One thing I did notice while watching the movie was some of the scenes were missing. I thought at first I was just misremembering the story, so I checked the time for this DVD and it was listed at 97 minutes. I then checked IMDB and Google and they both listed the time at 100 minutes.

For some reason, Amazon and/or MGM have released the show in an edited format, cutting three minutes out of the movie. I have no idea why they would do this since the movie was originally released as a broadcast TV movie in the 1970s and had nothing that would offend the censors then, let alone now. I remember at least two scenes that were cut out, but I don't think both of them together would amount to three minutes, so there may be an other one or two scenes cut out as well that I just don't remember.

When I buy a DVD of a broadcast TV movie, I expect to get all of the movie, not some edited version. This is especially true when no where in the Amazon description does it make any mention that this is an edited version and not the complete version as originally shown on TV. It's for this reason I'm giving the movie a three star rating.

The show itself, tho kind of juvenile in nature with a simplistic plot and primitive special effects, was still exactly as I remember it, so by itself I would have given it a five star rating just for nostalgic sake. With the edits tho, small as they were, I'm knocking off two stars for selling me an edited version of the movie with no notice that that's what it was.

If Amazon wants to send me an uncut 100 minute version of the movie, I'll happily raise my rating to five stars, but till then it'll stay at three stars.",1391644800,24,2043,4.0721393034825875

This movie seemed long to me then but it had that cool armored truck they moved about in and the energy of John Saxon. It sparked my imagination and made me want to go outside and explore my yard and the fields around me as if they were a strange new world. I enjoyed it then very much.
As as adult there is probably nothing here you haven't seen before and done much better. This was a relatively low budget tv movie.

8188232,3,B000P1UCM0,"I remember seeing small sections of this program on Sunday afternoon during the 70s.  Sunday afternoon is when you aired TV shows and movies that otherwise weren't that well accepted by the then Hollywood elite.  I'd watch the intro, then see the first few minutes of one of the two episodes, and then turn it off because both lacked action and flash.

So, I took a chance on it again 40+ years on, and I shrug my shoulders at it.  It's not a sterling production by any means, and I personally think there was much lacking in both writing and production design.  This show needed more flash and more money dumped into production values to really make it shine.  Instead we're just given the bare bones of a story and setting, and it feels like most of the money went into making the vehicles the characters use to get around.

The films are respectfully shot, but you can see that it was a low budget production to begin with.  That includes a lack of music in the actual episodes themselves.

Well, it's fortunate that this thing was made in today's era of heavy digital and CGI effects, although something tells me that it would have benefited from a larger SFX budget.  I'm glad I finally saw the whole thing, but I think I now understand why my younger self tuned it out.

8188233,3,B000P1UCM0,"Just finished watching ""Strange New World"" released by Warner Brothers.
""Strange New World"" is the third pilot attempt to bring Gene Roddenberry's concept of a world attempt to rebuild after the global collapse of civilizlation due to a catastrophe - this time after asteroids have devestated the planet - not war.  ""Genesis 2"" and ""Planet Earth"" were the first two pilots; and eleven episodes of a ""Planet Earth"" series had been written, but production was never green-lighted.  [Perhaps a future audio production for Big Finish Productions.]
PAX this time is a giant space station that is sent on an orbirt around the Sun designed to bring it back to Earth 200 years after the asteroid impact.  Inside PAX are three astronauts who are in suspended animation.  Their mission/quest is to locate the underground base where their families and others are waiting for them, locked in suspended animation until the astronauts revive them.
""Strange New World"" is an odd mix.  The first part finds the astronaut trio trapped in a colony of clones who need their blood in order to survive.  The second part finds the astronaut trio hunted and trapped between a war of two primative tribes.
I do remember watching ""Strange New World"" when it first aired back in 1975.  The original ending, when the astronaut trio go off in search of a ""ribbon of rock"" to find their loved ones was edited out of this DVD release for some reason.
""Strange New World"" is definately the weakes of the ""Genesis 2"" concept pilots.
Recommended for Gene Roddenberry fans, though I suspect he didn't have much input in this not-so great movie.
