The American actor who did the narration was horrible!  It is most assuredly distracting.  I've checked and he's not even given credit, which is probably a good thing.  When I'm rich I'll purchase the set again, but only if I'm assured  that the brilliant narration is done by the brilliant actor Burt Lancaster.

The beautiful Carla Fracci, one of the great ballet dancers of all time, plays the part of Giuseppina Straponi, the soprano who became Verdi's second wife.  Of course, there is much great music, and since Verdi lived from 1813 to 1901, this film offers a lesson in the history of that time in Europe.",1053907200,16,482,4.593023255813954
353908,5,6301770986,"I was very glad when I found this Video in Amazon.com. I adored this movie of my foremost favorite Maestro. However, I am NOT buying because I have been waiting for this movie to be released in DVD. In other words I like to preserve the maestro in the best Technology available. VHS is a dying technology. One may find a hard time finding the VCR in stores in the next 10 years. So I wonder why they don't they release this in DVD. I bet the DVD release of this masterpiece may rival the sale of the Lord of the Ring (Just kidding). I would have given this movie a 6 stars rating if I can based on the show I watched in PBS in the late 80's. I believe this movie is extremely closed to the book and events in the life of the great composer. The singing was great and as well as the scenes and dialogs. I do not understand what is the problem of the first gentleman who first reviewed this masterpiece and gave it a one star based on ""ACCENTS"". I speak Italian with American accent because I am an American, So what is the big deal if the actors have American accent? Of course they have since they are Americans. What really matter here is the story and how it is presented and not how it is accented. The late Burt Lancaster did a great job in the narration of the story and one can tell his passion and love for Opera and for the great master. I salute Ronald Pickup for his portrayal of the great composer and I do not know anybody can do a better job than he did except the great Verdi himself. BRAVO!!!! BRAVISIMO.!!!!!

354066,5,6301770986,"THE LIFE OF VERDI is a stunning, beautiful and virtually exhaustive (at about 10 hours) chronicle of the life of Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi.  Formerly available on the controversial Kultur label, this new DVD release by Acorn Media is a dream come true for people who appreciate composer biographies, historical epics and, especially, this particular film, which was the last film by Italian director/writer Renato Castellani.  The transfer is excellent, whereas the previously available print was mediocre at best.  This new release looks crisp and does justice to the film's visual artistry--it looks very much like a series of paintings.

Verdi lived a long, rich life and his output was truly amazing, mostly operas--and most of his operas were masterpieces.  There are generous allotments of Verdi's glorious music throughout this film and the period detail is lushly evocative of Verdi's life and times.  Ronald Pickup is perfect as Verdi.  He is probably the only ""name"" and face that will be familiar to at least some outside of Europe.  Pickup has been in countless films and television programs, including several other composer biographies, though here, finally, he plays the title role.  Speaking of names, when THE LIFE OF VERDI was shown on PBS way back in the early eighties, Burt Lancaster was the on camera narrator.  I recall this very clearly because I remember being enthralled by the series even back then.  In this version--perhaps for the better--Lancaster is not seen on camera (his star power was a bit distracting, if I recall).  He does, however, continue to narrate in voice-over.  Lancaster was a big fan of opera and his enthusiasm bubbles through in his voice, despite some mispronunciations that some will find distracting.

That's a minor observance compared to the beauty and lovingly re-created world that director/writer Castellani presents.  Castellani will not be entirely unfamiliar to North American audiences, though your tastes might have to be a bit specialized to recognize his name and style of film making.  One of his first films, from 1954, was a version of Romeo & Juliet starring Laurence Harvey and is a gorgeous evocation of Shakespeare's play, if a bit slowly paced.  It even has John Gielgud as the Chorus!  It took another Italian, Franco Zeffirelli, to bring Italy and Shakespeare to life for a contemporary audience back in 1968.

A few years before making THE LIFE OF VERDI, Castellani turned his attention to another great Italian, Leonardo Da Vinci, in a five part television film that I recall with great fondness, for it really brought Leonardo to life and gave me a deeper appreciation of his incredible achievements.

But back to THE LIFE OF VERDI.  Thank you to the distributors of this magnificent film!  The time you invest in watching it will pay dividends, for like any great work of art, it will stay with you long afterward.",1464825600,2,2900,5.0610526315789475
354067,5,6301770986,"Life of Verdi, with Ronald Pickup, Carla Fracci. This 1982 Italian-made television series was seen on PBSs Great Performances. In this biographical historical miniseries seen on PBS, Ronald Pickup (The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel; The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe) captures the title characters essence, while ballerina Carla Fracci shines as his second wife, opera star Giuseppina Strepponi. Verdi, who lived for nearly a century, from 1813-1901, endured a lifetime of political and personal turmoil while gaining popular acclaim. He was the preeminent operatic composer of his era, beloved for his popular operashe wrote 26which, despite his scandalous love affair, dominated stages all over Italy, Europe and the world. The production, which was filmed on location in Italy, London, Leningrad and Paris, is narrated by Academy Award winner Burt Lancaster, features many clips of Verdis music, including the favorites La Traviata, Rigoletto, Aida and his overwhelming requiem mass.  It is a foreign language production that has been dubbed into English, has additional English subtitles as well. The box set, which I received for an honest unbiased review, consists of four DVDs containing seven episodes, for approximately 659 minutes.  Mind, there is some violence.

Let me emphasize that this is not the hated Kultur release of this production.  This is a new release from Acorn, for which they have done everything possible to make this decades-old release look and sound as well as they could.  It is slow-moving, might move faster if it were redone today, but the scenery, exteriors, interiors, modes of transportation, clothing are all apparently accurate, and there certainly was no skimping on the many named characters, nor the extras, nor the music, stage sets, etc.  The first episode is particularly slow, but the series picks up power when Pickup begins to inhabit the title part.  The episodes are:
 Episode 1. Giuseppe Verdi is born in 1813 to an unremarkable provincial family. His exceptional musical talent becomes clear to all around him at a young age.
Episode 2. Verdi and Margherita build a family while Verdi, with the aid of Margheritas father, pursues his music education. His connections in the cultural hub of Milan provide new opportunities and encourage him to compose his first opera.
Episode 3. Verdis wife Margherita and two young children shockingly die of various diseases mere years apart, but Verdi retains close relations to his greatly helpful father-in-law, -- who continues to be helpful --as he will until the older mans death.  As Verdi's opera Nabucco debuts in Milan, he considers  Guiseppina for the leading part of Abigaille;  her voice deteriorates further;  the two grow closer together.
Episode 4. Verdi and Giuseppina Strepponi are living together in Paris as he continues writing operas. But when the 1848 French revolution begins, its effects stretch across Europe.
Episode 5. Verdi's talent earns him fame, fortune, and a number of accolades, including the French Legion of Honor. During rehearsals of Il Trovatore, Verdi begins work on La Traviata.
Episode 6. Times are changing all around Verdi. New technology and the Bohemian cultural movement are sweeping across Italy: he tries to find his place in the new era.
Episode 7. Following the success of Aida, Verdi mourns the loss of Italian writer Alessandro Manzoni - a man he greatly admired- and writes a requiem in his honor. Giuseppina fears Verdi may have found a new muse.

Mind you, Verdi is an important figure, and not only for his vital, forceful, beautiful music, which still dominates the worlds stages. But for his centrality in the Risorgimentothe struggle to reunite Italy, then, as for centuries past, a crazy quilt of warring independent cities, and free it, as a nation, from its bondage in the Austrian empire.  His operas were sung in the default language of the country, Italian, mostly set in recognizably Italian places, and from his first, Nabucco, to one of his last, Aida, presented themes which notably supported Italian unity and freedom. Consider the triumphal march from Aida.  With his 26 operas, Verdi created  the national soundtrack to Italys struggle for freedom. And the dramatization of the life of this classic Italian composer packs a powerful punch to the end. Important for music lovers, those with an interest in Italian history.",1463702400,2,4383,5.204545454545454
354068,5,6301770986,"2016 improved resolution DVD series review from a media-provided set:
I gained richness by learning Verdis life. My first impressions proved terribly wrong for this delightful look at the 19th century life of the great composer Verdi. The 1980s cinematography (best at the time) is a bit faded on some outdoor scenes but well worth it to have this drama preserved. The 80s Italian cast (An Italian production for the Italian Maestro) is not to todays Downton Abbey standard but the glitches and English dubbing is quite acceptable as the content fast becomes compelling and endearing. The story is fun, educational, touching and sometimes humorous. The music is awesome, and there is a constant flow of Verdis work. This miniseries is like a documentary fully dramatized in excellent period costumes and sets. Much more fun than reading a biographical book.
Ronald Pickup (Rectors Wife Best &- Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel Ivanhoe) deserves a Verdi standing ovation for this unforgettable depiction of Verdi.
And you cant miss the voice of Burt Lancaster doing interspersed narration.

The series is divided into 7 untitled episodes. A must for any music lover; & library shelf.

354073,5,6301770986,"I discovered this bio of Verdi sometime in the early 1990s on VHS and fell in love with it from the first opening shot of Verdi's birth set in what at least looked like his actual childhood house in Le Roncole. It is a completely charming and extremely in-depth biography of the composer set in many of the actual locations where his life took place. I recently went to watch my VHS copy once again only to discover that all the colors had faded to a pale green tint. After seeing all the negative comments here about the picture quality of the Kulture DVD issue and some positive comments about a Spanish version, I ordered the 7 disk , 11 hour version from Amazon.es in Spain. It only cost $40 US including shipping and was delivered to me in the USA in one week. You do need to have an all regions DVD player that plays PAL format to watch this version.

Keeping in mind that this is a TV production from the early 1980s and there has been no restoration work done on it, I have no complaints about the picture quality. I have not experienced any of the issues other reviews have experienced with the Kulture version. Yes, there are some little dirt dots every now and then and some momentary deterioration of the stock creating a one second squiggly line in the image (only happened once so far) and but over all I am very happy with the picture and would highly recommend this version.

The description on the Amazon.es site says it is in ""Castellano"" but you actually can choose between an English or Spanish soundtrack on the DVDs. Remember that this site is in Spanish so you want to search for ""La Vida De Verdi - Serie Completa [DVD]"" . And don't forget you need a DVD player that does PAL and all regions.

The best thing about the life of Giuseppe Verdi is, of course, his music.  This tedious product, with its endless voice-over track, also its risible dubbing, plus the wooden tableau vivant acting, is terrible.  The transfer from some overused tape (that's how it looks:  s-t-r-e-t-c-h-e-d) is hideous.  After an hour and a half, I had to give up, and put on a marvelous DVD of ""Otello"" (my favorite of his operas; the Requiem is right up there, too), sounding superb and looking fine.  This biographical over-ten-hour film is not worth anyone's time, and even at a bargain price, it definitely is not worth the money.",1374105600,2,792,6.035714285714286
354134,4,6301770986,"This is indeed, as most other reviewers boast, a near-epic miniseries. I can't imagine how abridged the storyline would feel if Kultur had released this DVD set in its original abridged-for-TV version...this, at least, is a saving grace to this product.

Some people will complain about the lengthiness of this set, but I wouldn't have it one minute shorter! This story not only discusses Verdi's biography (and in much more detail and depth than any other video I know of), but it tries to talk about some of the actual influences on Verdi as both a man and a composer. These influences were sometimes crippling to his music (the death of his first wife, Margherita) and sometimes sheer blessings (his long and mostly joyous relationship with the singer Giuseppina Strepponi).

Some viewers will be disappointed with the fact that this series does NOT talk all about Verdi's operas all the time, but where on the packaging does it actually claim to be merely a dissection of his operas? I think it would be a sweeping assumption to think that all Verdi ever did in his life was sit behind a desk and scribble music down (not to say that composing wasn't an enormous part of his life and surely his biggest achievement). As the series goes on, be assured that there are plenty of musical examples of his operas and plenty of scenes about performances and rehearsals.

Be aware that there is some hoaky English dubbing going on - there are times when the words you hear only barely match the lip movements of the on-screen actors. Yet both the voice acting and the on-screen acting are generally competent and enthusiastic, so I'm not sure how much I mind. Better to have an accurate and heartfelt translation than a stilted one!

This series is a mixture of documentary and movie drama. For a topic like a musician, this is as good a method as any of presenting a composer's life. In addition to the acted scenes, there is a narrator who explains obscure cultural facets or historical/political tidbits. The narrator's script is a bit overbearing sometimes, but at least they picked someone with a tolerable speaking voice to do it.

Now for the bad: like many reviewers complain, both the picture and sound quality are fairly mediocre. There are actually spots where you can see the source tapes have tracking problems, which makes me very much doubt that this DVD transfer was made using the painstaking but worthwhile process of individual frame-by-frame photographic scanning as is more common with DVDs these days. Having said that, the picture quality is viewable in general. The sound is listenable, but has many apparently mono recordings because the sound frequently ""clips"" when a singer goes forte (or when an actor screams loudly). They are mostly very excellent musical examples from excellent singers, so this is a shame. Curiously, the aforementioned narrator has much better sound quality and seems like it is 10-15 years younger than the film itself.

It still gets 4 stars from me, because technical problems aside, this is mostly a downright fun and impassioned miniseries. My attention never once wavered during the approximately 13 hours of running time. This set should be near the top of must-watch video biographies for any serious musician, singer, or music trivia buff.",1372550400,,3295,4.906642728904847

I remember finding this TV series enthralling when I saw it in the early 1980s, and have ever since hoped to see it again. My disappointment was colossal on receiving the product. I couldn't bear to see more than half a minute of it. WHY oh why couldn't the original soundtack have been kept, so the watcher could at least choose?

The viewer is immersed in all of the best-loved arias and orchestral passages from his operas, while learning about nineteenth-century politics in the city-states that finally became a united Italy.

At the time, I enjoyed the series and shared the VHS tapes with friends because the series was actually quite well done.  I hadn't realized that the DVDs from Kultur were less than full copies of the original broadcasts.  I will not miss Burt Lancaster standing in Verdi's former home as I always questioned why he was selected for that task since he brought nothing of value to the series, but when I watched parts of the DVDs last night, I could barely force myself to stay awake.  Only then did I read the other comments here and realize what had happened.  I am not suffering from memory loss but Kultur did a wretched job producing this set.

What Kultur could not damage was wonderful costuming and a few memorable moments, such as Verdi showing a tenor how to die in the last act of Otello.  I felt the DVDs focused on banalties, endless speculation about the relationship Verdi may or may not have had with Teresa Stoltz, incoherent handling of the Mariani issue . . . all in all, the original series suffered horribly from third rate editorial decisions.

354198,1,6301770986,"I just finished another 5 hours of the DVD ""The Life of Verdi"". Interesting what music is left out and the performances
seem to be from the just okay performances from Cetra recordings from the 50s. The hostess Roberta Peters announced Birgit Nilsson was singing in Macbeth- she did for about [10] seconds. I have no idea except for Verdi and Strepponi who is portraying the characters as just the actors names are mentioned and the singers not mentioned by Peters are mysteries and not given credit. The cover says Renata Tebaldi is one of the artists. Did not hear her and I have heard her voice for over fifty years. IMO poor Verdi's music is given second billing in both quantity and quality - how ironic.

Who thought up the nonsense of having so much of the music sung by the Verdi character while playing the piano like Horowitz?

The announcers voice is boring and this like an Opera Without Words production.

Just finished the last 2 hours of ""The Life of Verdi"". Otello is represented by the beginning through ""Esultate"" and the death of Otello. ""Falstaff"" has less than 30 seconds of music. This documentary is better if one is not especially interested in Verdi's music. YUCK !!!!!!

354200,3,6301770986,"I enjoyed watching ""The Life of Verdi"" when it was on Television. I like it so much I bought the series when it came out on VHS tapes. When it came out with the DVD version, I bought it without reading the reviews, thinking it would be even better in video quality. It was the biggest mistake I ever done. The quality of the DVD was so bad it is shocking. With its many visual flaws, it is actually worse than my video tape version.

I will never have the confidence to buy from this company again. Never in my life have I bought a DVD with such regret. They should be ashamed for ruining such a enchanting mini series.

As much as I enjoy the series, I would not recommend it to anyone until they can do a proper transfer from the original source. The company should not be rewarded for such scandalous effort.",1235520000,21,811,4.225806451612903

354202,5,6301770986,"The transfer is poor, apparently it was cut, and nevertheless this is a must seen by anyone who enjoys Verdi and, maybe, by whoever enjoys good cinema.

Verdi was not only a tremendous composer, but also a great man. He was not flawless or a saint. But he was a fairly good hearted man, with nice intentions and down to earth. Verdi was far from being the racist and bigot as other nationalists of his time as, for example, Wagner.

This production is really amazing. They did a wonderful job to reconstitute the 19th century Europe and we really fell like we are living that moment. Ronald Pickup, the actor that plays Verdi, deserves all the praises in the world. Whenever I see or imagine Verdi, I think about his portrait. The same can be said about Carla Fracci, the actress that gave life to Strepponi, and about everybody else.

I could never imagine that I could watch a movie that lasts 10 hours in 2 days. When it finished I wanted even more.",1219622400,,952,4.459770114942529
354233,5,6301770986,"Giuseppe Verdi borrowed liberally from writers Victor Hugo and William Shakespeare, and so it's ironically appropriate that Verdi's life has all the earmarks of a Shakespearian tragic hero, complete with tragic flaw. Music is his strength, but also his weakness. He has the passion to feel love, but not passion enough to boldly go after love. Opera lovers will find themselves absorbed by the operatic treatment of Verdi's life, which includes many scenes performed from Verdi operas: Nabucco, Ernani, Rigoletto, Trovatore, Traviata, Aida, Otello, and Falstaff.

The plot is really second to the music, and I don't mean the standard background fare. Substantial operatic performance clips and background music of Verdi's operas wash over you as you watch. Verdi's musical education began at an early age, although it is not known exactly when he began formal study. It is known that he was captivated by music and that his parents early on decided to give him an instrument of his own, a little spinet piano. Verdi was born to a poor family in a tiny Italian village. He began studying music in a nearby town Busseto, where he was taken into the home of a wealthy patron who later also supported his education in Milan. When he completed his studies, he became municipal music director in Busseto and married his patron's daughter; three years later he returned to Milan with the score of his first opera, Oberto. Oberto was produced at La Scala and had a modest success which brought Verdi a contract for more operas. Then disaster struck. Verdi's wife and their two children died within a very short time. Verdi managed to complete his next opera, but it was a failure and in despair he persuaded himself that there was no consolation in his art and vowed to never compose again.

A few years later the film shows when Verdi composed Rigoletto and La Traviata. Although the public loved them, critics were often scandalized by their subject matter. They seemed to condone rape, suicide, and free love. But Verdi was fiercely independent and himself lived openly with his second wife for ten years before marrying her. Verdi composed not for the musical elite but for a mass public whose main entertainment was opera. He wanted subjects that were as Verdi said ""original, interesting and passionate; passions about all!""  Almost all his mature works are serious and end unhappily; they move quickly and involve extremes of hatred, love, jealousy, and fear and his powerful music underlines the dramatic situations.

By the end of the film, opera lovers will have felt as if they had just attended a ""highlights"" concert combined with a sometimes somber treatment of the composer's semi tragic life. Those who aren't so familiar with opera will come away with a better sense of the music. If there's one surprise, it's that apart from the performance clips there's very little in the way of dramatic score. Most of the scenes that drive the plot are presented in silence, although music is used for transitions and to heighten emotional moments. People in this day and age aren't exactly known for being opera lovers, on the whole. They generally get their arias from tv commercials and movies. Ask someone to hum a few bars of Verdi's ""Libiamo ne lieti calici"" and you'll get a blank stare or a laugh. Play a few bars for them, and many of them will beam, ""Hey, I've heard that from a commercial on television."" Even if you are not an opera fan, but you're a fan of musical biographies, you'll like this film.",1198800000,5,3511,4.846666666666667

The edition I purchased is technically somewhat dated and has been slightly edited, with some interesting scenes -such as the account of Verdi's last hours from his faithful friend and libretist Arrigo Boito- deleted.  The movie was filmed largely on location, which makes for a very realistic setting. For example the scenes done in Busseto, which aside for modern conveniences is as charming as it must have been a century ago are particularly moving.

There is no option to select language sub-titles, and die-hard italianophiles will have to settle for English. The performance by all actors is superb, and after a while one forgets they are not speaking Verdi's mother tongue.

I can only imagine the stress. 2] The missed early oportunity of even a glance betwen Verdi and Toscanini, in the second chair of the cellos at La Scala orchestra during rehersals and premier of Otello. He eventually saw him conducting, recommending him to the baritone Maurel, who recomended to Leoncavallo, eventually resulting in Toscanini conducting the premier of Pagliacci. 3] His role in 1899 as arbitrer betwen tenor Tamagno (original Otello), in favor of Toscanini, about tempis.

This mini-series dubbed in English on DVD is a dramatized biography of one of the great opera composers, Giuseppe Verdi (1813 to 1901).  The narrated biographical events are played out against the background of Italy's struggle for unity and independence, a cause to which Verdi (Ron Pickup) dedicated his art.

There is also romance in this movie as Verdi meets the significant women in his life: Margheritta (Daria Nicolodi), Giuseppina (Italian ballerina Carla Fracci), and Teresa (Eva Christian).  All three along with an older Verdi are shown on the DVD's container cover.

The music in this movie is fantastic.  It has recordings of leading operatic voices such as Luciano Pavarotti, Maria Callas, and Renata Tebaldi.  The movie is stunningly photographed and includes actual highlights of many of Verdi's operas such as Nabucco (Nebuchadneezzar, King of Babylon, 1842), I Lombardi, Ernani, Rigoletto, La Traviata (The Lost One), Un Ballo in Maschera (A Masked Ball), Aida, Otello (his greatest lyric tragedy) and Falstaff (1893, his last opera).

Each part of this movie has a brief introduction given by a female host.  Here is her introduction for the entire series:

""This is a seven-part dramatization of the life of the world's most important and beloved operatic composers.  For the opera fans in the audience, we hope it will enhance your enjoyment...but you don't have to be a devoted opera buff to enjoy this exceptional docudrama.  Some seven million dollars and two years time went into the making of [this mini-series].  It was filmed on location in Italy, France, England, and the Soviet Union.  Great care was taken to ensure the accuracy of historical events, settings, and costuming as you will see.  The result is an intriguing portrait of a man, a country, and the events that shaped their destinies.  The series is a compelling human drama and a tribute to a man that gave us more than twenty-five operas.""

Ron Pickup as Verdi gives, I feel, an exceptional performance.  As well, I feel that the male English narrator (who is not given credit) also does a good job.  (Note that in this version, Burt Lancaster is not the narrator.)

The sound quality of this DVD is very good.  However, occasionally there are split second disturbances in picture quality.  Because I was so absorbed in the story, I did not find these distracting.  I think its better to own this DVD than to own the video cassette of this mini-series.

Finally, this mini-series focuses on Verdi's operas giving the impression he composed only operas.  However, this is not true!  He also composed beautiful vocal and chamber music.

In conclusion, this is a spectacular mini-series/movie.  Be sure to see it so as to learn more about the man who said, ""It is better to invent reality than to copy it.""

354238,5,6301770986,"Some years ago, I had watched the original TV series that is superb, and left me with vivid memories. This is one of the very best biographies of a great artist that I ever watched on TV. A landmark. Definitely 5-star. I have great admiration and respect for the quality and authenticity of all the works of director Renato Castellani. So I was really happy to find that I could buy this biography of Verdi in DVD's.
However, this company KULTUR and its staff deserve to be taken to the woodshed -- maybe to court?
From a user point of view, there are several problems: (1) the quality of the recording is poor, video tracking pops-up from time to time. Images of large scale views such at the stage in La Scala are not sharp. It is readily apparent that this DVD series has not been made from the original tapes from some copy: this is conspicuous at the start of Episode 2 where the introducer's blue dress ""bleeds"" startingly on the screen. [I have not yet found the time to watch the last three episodes. Maybe there are surprises there too. I hope not.] (2) Switching from one episod to another is a true hassle because the programing is not set up properly. The episodes do not load on their own and start only after repeated clicks. Left unattended, the opening trailers at the start of each episode keep cycling endlessly. (3) There is also no background information about the series on paper: not on the cover box, not in a simple paper flyer inside the CD containers. The cover box only carries a quote from a review in a source named as ""Booklist"".  The only basic information on how the series were made is embedded in the original PBS introductions to each episode.
Disappointedly, but not objectionable there no additional information inside the CDs in the form of video interviews of the director or actors, nor segments deleted from the original movie, which a very common value- added item in DVD movies, particularly expected in a 4-DVD series.
The strength and beauty of the original work is such that once the action gets started we are immediatly absorbed in Verdi's life and music. But not thanks to Kultur.
Commercially, could it be that Amazon.com is selling a pirated product? I am suspicious, but I am not a professional in those matters. Why suspicious? because, I was looking for the release date of the original TV series, but I could not find it anywhere. To my astonishment there is no reference to the date of the movie nor any listing of main actors on the box, or inside. On closer scrutiny, I then noticed also that there is not copyright statement on the cover box.  I distincly recall also that such statements -- and the date of production again --are absent from the end trailers of credits at the end of every individual episode I have watched so far.
Is this KULTUR outfit legitimate? or were these DVDs made in some US or Asian garage?
Conclusion: a superb biography of one of the greatest opera composers of all times that is worth being part of a permanent DVD collection. But, a flawed and suspicious DVD transfer by KULTUR.",1078012800,100,3069,4.5883424408014575
354239,4,6301770986,"On all counts the original presentation of ""Life of Verdi"" was a well-conceived and well-executed treat on all counts. What fails us now is Kultur's amateurish transfer. First of all, viewers can't skip past Robert Peter's introductions (which could easily have been omitted but at least she, unlike Burt Lancaster on PBS, could pronounce ""Verdi""). Second, the transfer is from a flawed video tape. Tracking problems occur occasionally which they wouldn't had Kultur bothered to go back to the originals. How cheap!!

It should have been Italian all the way, with appropiate subtitles for other languages.  Likewise, the mispronunciation of proper names by Burt Lancaster as narrator is deplorable.  Especially noticable is his pronunciation of 'verdi' to sound like 'birdie'.  Also no dirty linen was brought out, especially about Strepponi and her abandoning her children at birth as unknowns, and never making any effort to ever see or contact them at anytime afterwards.  The film also never raises the question as to why Giuseppe and Giuseppina produced no children of their own.
Ok, it's not the ideal film that I would make.  But, hey, it is amazing that this film even exists.  By the last hour of the film, you begin to feel almost privileged that you had the opportunity to see a great, great man and musician, and a great, great woman live out their life togheter in unconventional ways.
