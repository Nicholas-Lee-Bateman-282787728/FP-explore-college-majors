8435546,5,B004M5HIIG,"A thoughtful documentary of the work by Henry Butler, Pete Eckert and Bruce Hall, who each happen to be blind. As the daughter of a man who lost most of his sight and was declared legally blind when I was seven, I've always known that ""vision"" is a gift that is about more than what we ""see."" If my dad were still alive, he would love this documentary and the men in it. In large part, I became a fine art photographer directly because of his blindness. I only learned of this small film two days ago and was delighted to receive and watch it this afternoon. Kudos to the photographers who have pursued fine art photography which is a difficult field in the best of circumstances.",1389916800,2,680,4.362204724409449
