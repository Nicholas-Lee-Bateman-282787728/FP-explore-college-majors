3787651,3,B001SXZ7TM,"Two of Disney's excellent live action adventures are nicely packaged together in this affordable 2-disc set. They are both in the full-screen mode. This works fine for the 1950 ""Treasure Island"". A great version of the Robert Louis Stevenson story starring Robert Newton. Now the bad news: Jules Verne's ""In Search Of The Castaways"" is shown here in full-screen and suffers for the treatment. This would have been much improved if shown in a widescreen version. Shame that Disney doesn't give this entertaining movie with Hayley Mills a proper release. Cmon, Disney! Get with the program.",1267315200,13,588,5.135416666666667

8340251,5,B001SXZ7TM,"Incredible adventures made entertaining by great actors. In treasure Island, it is the old story of Jim and the pirate looking for treasure. The bond they form with each other throws a kink into the plans of the pirate. Jim isn't the usual victim of his pirating. Jim shows he has integrity while at the same time a loyalty to friends. Great movie. In Search of the Castaways takes a group comprised the children of a missing sea captain, the owner of the ship company, the son of the owner, and a school teacher who finds a note in a bottle, on a series of journeys and adventures that are dangerous and beautiful. Incredible scenes with fire and flood and volcanoes keep up the action is this great  movie.",1468627200,,708,4.488372093023256
