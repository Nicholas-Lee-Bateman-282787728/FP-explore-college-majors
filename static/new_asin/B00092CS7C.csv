8056698,4,B00092CS7C,"I bought this on a whim, and am glad I did. The story is about a hooker named Daisy who befriends an older man who is a famous novelist Georges. She charges him for her time but all he wants is to speak to her, to use her experiences as the basis for his next book. Slowly, they get closer together but she holds a devastating secret.

The music was annoying and well, I have to say it was improbable for Georges to get interested in racy talk after his novels dealt little with sex. That said, it was a good film and I don't regret viewing it.",1181088000,,544,4.037037037037037
