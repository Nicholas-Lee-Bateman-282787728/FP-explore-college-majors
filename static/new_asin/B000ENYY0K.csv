2524387,5,B000ENYY0K,"I happened upon this brilliant documentary just as it was beginning late one night on PBS and was held rapt through the closing credits.  Beautifully executed, entertaining, chilling and poignant, perhaps the highest praise I can give is that it's simply a terrific story well told.  Filmmaker Bill Rose has done a masterful job of capturing the essence of a one-of-a-kind time and place and the people who lived to tell the tale.  Part testament, part mystery, this amazing work will haunt you long after the screen goes dark.  To provide more detail would diminish the first-time viewer's experience.  There's magic in the way this film unfolds, and you'll find yourself honored to have been its witness.",1141257600,4,706,5.0
2524388,5,B000ENYY0K,"Loss can sometimes be a gain, sadly art and life can be funny that way. The story of Oakley Hall III intrigued me so much I had to seek out more information, I had to know if Oakley had rediscovered that loss sense of community that I knew he hungered for. Ironically, the big tragedy for me wasn't the accident, no one could have really predicted that act. The true tragedy, the true injustice was how this man was left to suffer for years in convenient isolation afterwards, spiraling through the cracks of both an indifferent healthcare system and rarefied social fabric. Thank god, he finally received the dignity, compassion, and equality that supposedly creates the core sense of our human rights and values in this society. This film should not be seen for the nostalgic road gap of ""what could have been"", but rather a signal to what became the precursor for the ""me generation"", the failures of the Great Society, and the present systemic tide of homeless. Again, thank god, Oakley had family and friends to fall back on, for he would surely be suffering in prison nowadays.
A film that begs the true questions, values and quality of life issues that we so often in this culture decide to cleverly duck out of. The only other film I could compare this to in scope and power would be ""The Elephant Man"".",1141257600,3,1311,4.6068376068376065
2524389,5,B000ENYY0K,"I wish I was more articulate....not a writer, actor, nor do I have anything to do with theater except that I enjoy it a lot..

but something caught me in your film and I couldn't turn away for even a minute.

Some kind of familiarity...can't put my finger on it.  Oak looked strangely familiar, yet I don't think I'd ever even heard of him.  The interviews, seeing the pictures of Lexington and Oak before the accident, was somewhat confused at first when some of the photos were blurred - maybe his wife didn't want to be a part of the project.  Molly Fisk - can't place her, but I think I know her from somewhere.  Maybe our paths crossed at some point - who knows....could be anywhere - L.A. , Carmel, Chicago.

I think what moved me so much that is actually just now becoming clear to me as I write to you is how sadly familiar it is when something tragic happens and part of you - arguably the best part - ceases to exist....last night watching it, I only saw this as it related to Oak - and was so taken with the story, the narrative, the visual - that I couldn't distill the emotion of it all into anything tangible.  Now, it just feels immensly hopeful. Sad, (weepingly sad at my desk here in Type-A- personality-corporate-Chicago), but kinda hopefull.

I could go on...but you don't know me...and, well,  I think you probably will be getting lots of emails from folks equally moved.  Fundamentally shifted in a big way.

With thanks and admiration for a great work-

8111752,3,B000ENYY0K,"THE LOSS OF NAMELESS THINGS (2006) is a documentary dealing with numerous aspects of a catastrophic head injury suffered by Oakley Hall III in 1978. It is a very uneven film with some excellent parts, but it has far too many interviews of aging 5th-rate actors/actresses who are not too bright, not well informed, and much of the time not believable.

The editing is often poor, and the continuity is fuzzy at best. It seems that Bill Rose, the maker of the film, ended up with hours of footage that could be used to tell perhaps a dozen or more different stories, but he could not make up his mind which one to place in the foreground, which ones to make subordinate, and which others to eliminate ... so he jumped around and tried to do them all.

Among other stories, we get (1) the personal tragedy of Oakley Hall III; (2) the personal tragedy of his family (his wife, child, parents, and siblings); (3) the tragedy of society's supposed loss of a huge literary genius, cut down just as he was about to bloom into greatness; (4) the inspiring story of Oakley Hall III surviving a terrible brain injury and gradually recovering many of his mental functions; (5) the cautionary tale of an irresponsible community of youngish, twenty-something theater folks who abused their minds and bodies with excessive alcohol and various drugs before and after Oakley Hall was injured; (6) the cautionary tale of an irresponsible array of aging, fifty-something theater folks who misremember much of what occurred (or they never knew) and who in pretentious, self-aggrandizing ways ""invent"" stories about their past with Oakley Hall III; and (7) a polemical tale about how our society and most individuals are unwilling and/or unable to deal with and/or care for people whose brains are damaged.

Besides several of my life experiences as a Hospice Care volunteer, I am reminded of some other fact-based films that have dealt with people who have suffered the loss of some mental functions, usually due to schizophrenia, and how lucky or unlucky they were in receiving treatment and humane care from others. THE STORY OF ADELE H (1975) showed, among other things, that even a great genius like Victor Hugo was unable to do much when his adult child lost her mind. SHINE (1996) showed a talented musician suffering a disastrous nervous breakdown and, with luck and tenacity, achieving a comeback of sorts. A BEAUTIFUL MIND (2001) showed an undoubted genius, who with luck and ""proper care"" was able to regain parts of his mental function. THE SOLOIST (2008) showed another talented musician, again with luck, after many years of hardship, regaining some of what he'd lost. And A GUY CALLED DAD (2011) showed how a caring daughter was coping with her father's schizophrenia.

Significantly, in 2008 Bill Rose released a similar but far superior documentary about the life and death of Elizabeth Wiltsee, a brilliant woman with a 200 I.Q. and a huge talent for languages, who suffered a mental breakdown. Titled THIS DUST OF WORDS, it clearly shows how she became homeless because of her disability and how, decades later, she was mercifully ""adopted"" and cared for by a group Catholic women in a small California town for a short time before her death.

To return to THE LOSS OF NAMELESS THINGS, like Victor Hugo, Hall's parents were unable to provide any intelligent care for their child after his fall from the bridge ... ditto his sisters. Some of the film's footage had interviews with them, probably done almost 20 years after his accident. And most of the other folks, chiefly actors Hall had worked with, were similarly useless as any sorts of caregivers or helpers in the years following his injury.

After his wife divorced him, however, Oakley Hall III was very lucky with the pair of women who served (not simultaneously but serially) as his caregivers while his brain mended somewhat. It truly WAS remarkable that Oakley Hall regained as much mental function as he did: in the footage presented, Hall is able to speak cogently and move in a ""normal looking"" way and has an excellent, educated vocabulary.

In my judgment, if I were giving this film a letter grade, it would be a ""C+"". Undoubtedly, a really good film could have been made about Oakley Hall, his injury, and its aftermath. It is too bad an editor with more experience or a more balanced view wasn't brought in to sort out the various threads of this documentary and discard the material that distracts viewers and detracts from its overall effect.

POSTSCRIPT: Throughout this documentary there is lots of f-word usage in the interviews, especially by two or three of the women, and there also are some clips from home movies with total nudity, male and female. It seems fair to mention these things in case your parents or your children would be bothered in any way by these factors while watching the film with you.",1386460800,,4882,4.83133971291866
8111753,3,B000ENYY0K,"Of the many documentaries available for streaming on Netflix, very few are worth watching. Some have potentially interesting subject matter, but are ill wrought. Others are just paint by numbers formula documentaries with a political, religious, or philosophic agenda. Still others are just plain amateurish. Then there are documentaries like Bill Rose's 2005 The Loss Of Nameless Things, about the rise and violent fall of a playwright and dramaturg whose critical and artistic star seemed to be waxing, before, like many clichd artists of talent, he kyboshed it all and nearly killed himself. Instead, he ended up destroying his brain, his marriage, his past, and his future. The artist in question was Oakley `Tad' Hall III, son of the fairly well known novelist and Academic, Oakley Hall II.

  Rose's film is odd because it is compelling, due to its structural innovation (its first 70% details Hall's rise, until his 1978 accident, without a single contemporaneous image of Hall, and the last 30% shows the brain damaged Hall dominating the film), even as the life it tells of is both trite and rather tritely conveyed by the man's peers and friends. Of course, like Arthur Rimbaud, Jim Morrison, Vincent Van Gogh, and countless other artists of merit who flamed out early, Hall is hagiographized as a potential great, even though the little bits of his art the film presents is, well, trite. Naturally, he had an obsession: for Hall it was the mediocre French playwright Alfred Jarry, and his rather over the top work, Ubu Roi. If that's not enough to give one a sense of the man's easy box, Hall is portrayed as a sexual magnet for the opposite sex and an artistic outsider and rebel, even though his father was a well known and influential leader of the MFA movement in California in the middle of last century. To say that Tad Hall was `connected' is an understatement. To top matters off, of course, this rebel, in the late 60s, was into partying, sex, drugs, free love, etc. Stories of his `brilliance' and `genius' and other good qualities are neverending, it seems.",1340236800,2,2079,4.88385269121813
8111754,1,B000ENYY0K,"Self-indulgent aggrandizement of a mediocre talent who happened to fall off a bridge while drunk and stoned and became a vegetable.

Oakley Hall's hero was Alfred Jarry and UBU ROI. Jarry and UBU ROI happen to be mediocrities themselves. No one who knows French literature takes Jarry seriously.

Hall's actors make him out to be Arthur Miller, Lee Strasberg and Ibsen combined, but one soon senses that this is naive hero-worship on their part is a reflection of their own mediocrity.

The whole thing has an aroma of inauthenticity that leaves a bad taste in your mouth if you love theater.",1339545600,,592,4.841584158415841
8111755,3,B000ENYY0K,"The second half of this film was excellent and gives the viewer a real insight into traumatic brain injuries. Unfortunately, the first half is a lot of talking heads, mostly middle-aged actors recalling the details of their mispent youth and supposed artistic glories, much of which is repetetive.",1314576000,,297,5.208333333333333

Very moving and sad, but hopeful.",1177718400,3,343,4.296875
8111757,5,B000ENYY0K,"Oakley Hall III was the resident genius, guru, and inspiration behind the 1970s Lexington Conservatory Theater, a high water mark in the history of energetic and inspired American theater. His play ""Grinders' Stand"" is a little known classic, the story of Meriwether Lewis in blank iambic pentameter. In 1978, Hall fell from a bridge and suffered massive brain damage, changing his personality and robbing him of his genius. He lost years. Life has its own genius, however, and Hall's post-fall life resonates with the indestructibility of the human spirit.  Documentary filmmaker Bill Rose has made a great film: hard-edged, strong, inspiring.  It's good.",1175126400,5,656,5.359223300970874

As you watch the life story of the protagonist, Oakley Hall, unfold, you will probably begin to ask yourself some difficult and often painful questions about who you really are and what truly defines you--questions that everyone should attempt to answer even if they have not been challenged with a life-changing injury or illness. I recommend you take the time to view this film. You will have the opportunity to learn something by doing so.",1141430400,3,678,4.705882352941177

8111760,5,B000ENYY0K,"A recent airing of Bill Rose's THE LOSS OF NAMELESS THINGS on PBS's ""Independent Lens"" afforded me the opportunity to see this extraordinary documentary film about an extraordinary playwright, Oakley Hall, III. Like so many of life's chance discoveries, I was completely surprised by the beauty of this film  - both in its subject matter and its crafting.

It is more than apparent that Mr. Hall was - is - one of those uniquely gifted individuals who appear rarely on life's stage. Unfortunately, such exceptional characters seem inevitably to be cursed with flaws which lead to their own ""falls."" Though this was largely the case with Oakley, too, his tale ends on notes of redemption and rebirth.

Changed though he may be today, few among us will ever be able to create anything of lasting significance as Oakley has done. In his achievements, he is a fortunate man, indeed.

Bill Rose has captured this man's dramatic life in an artful and sensitive way. His use of old photos and films, interviews with friends and family, and visual references back to the LTC environs (especially, the haunting old bridge and the river below) are all superbly done. The care that has obviously been put into the creation of this documentary betrays a  genuine fondness for the subject and the genius of the film artist behind its production.

Though Oakley appears at least contented with his life today, much was lost at the time of his accident. The saddest piece of the story, of course, is the apparent lack of reconciliation that exists between Oakley and his first wife. Hopefully, she - and their son - will one day see this film and it will serve to awaken those memories that are good ones; and, perhaps, they will be proud and thankful to have participated in Oakley's life.",1141257600,6,1775,4.784313725490196
8111761,5,B000ENYY0K,"This movie is beautifully written and painstakingly researched, photographed, and edited.  I woke up in the middle of the night and it was just coming on PBS--no more sleep for me!  This is very compelling stuff--

--A charismatic, almost feral male with a name like a college dorm room who can literally charm the pants off anyone.

--A ramshackle old barn in the Catskills transformed by a ragtag troupe of theatre-obsessed, let's-do-the-show-right-here types.

--A story that unfolds through the remembrances of the now fifty-somethings who lived it, and through the eyes of anguished parents.

--A gathering sense of foreboding, made more so by glimpses of the favorite writers and the stories that interested the man in the eye of the storm, Oakley Hall III.

--Rich metaphors, including a Frankenstein adaptation Oakley wrote and produced, explored beautifully and unobtrusively (sometimes a difficult feat.)

There's more, but it's easier to just urge anyone and everyone to see it.  You won't be sorry.  By the way, I've never met anyone associated with the movie, so this is all from the heart.  We need much, much more of this--good, quality independent films that intrigue and sometimes provoke, but always entertain.",1141257600,5,1228,5.214285714285714
