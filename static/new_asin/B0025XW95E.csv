3850069,5,B0025XW95E,"When I first heard of this piece I thought it would be another ballet danced to Orchestrated Chopin, like Les Sylphide, but it isn't. The music is authentic Chopin played on the piano. The first act is danced to the second piano concerto so there's an orchestra involved in that but it's the real thing. There on after it's just piano solo.  This beautiful music combined with a beautiful visual performance by young dancers makes it an absolute joy to behold. And this is combined with a technically brilliant blue ray DVD. You can't go wrong.",1254960000,9,544,4.666666666666667

All 3 come together in ""La Dame aux camelias"" with bonuses of colourful costumes and a poignant storyline.  The first Act impressed me less than the other two as I did not feel the Chopin Piano Concerto particularly apt for either the dancing or storyline but I was won over with the beautiful Act 2, danced only to lovely piano music.  It was surprising just how effective a solo piano can be to evoke emotion when so beautifully choreographed as is the case in this production.  The story does not follow the same path as in Verdi's opera but is faithful to the essential Dumas tale.
There is no doubt the Opera National de Paris is one of the world's leading ballet companies with some superb dancers in its ranks.  Some of that dancing is spectacular with lots of tricky lifts all melded in seamlessly and gracefully.  If you love ballet and like a moving story then this is a must for your collection.",1252281600,9,1197,5.285714285714286

Agnes Letestu is truly in a class of her own in this role.  The plot and the choreography fit her perfectly.  The choreography itself is very interesting, both the pas de deux parts and the solo parts.  The cast is very strong throughout.  I recommend to all.",1347494400,,382,4.8
3850102,5,B0025XW95E,"This is a fantastic ballet and this DVD does it credit. Sometimes ballet on film can be disappointing or not filmed very well. But this DVD manages to capture the essence and beauty of this sadly overlooked work.

Based on La Dame aux Camelias by Dumas and originally made for the Stuttgart Ballet to feature the great Marcia Haydee, this is real ballet at its romantic best. The Marguerite and Armand pas de deux is one of the most sensuous pieces of choreography I have ever seen. And the choice to use music by Chopin was a wise one as so much of his music is, as a dancer friend of mine likes to say, dancey (the New York City Ballet's Dances at a Gathering also show how well Chopin and dance go together). The performances are superb, especially Agnes Letestu as Marguerite. My mother saw Marcia Haydee dance this role on stage and raved about it. But I cannot imagine it was that much better than the way Agnes Letestu dances and acts it. This is a ballet well worth seeing and remembering.",1332806400,2,997,4.418478260869565

On the other hand I think she is a beautiful technician. I have now changed my mind based on this ballet, ""La Dame aux Camellias"", and ""Paquita"", another ballet she is exceptional in.
To even bring this story to the stage in the form of a ballet, and tell it as well as Neumeier did, was a feat in itself, and even though some people did not like the choice of music, I thought it fit the scenes perfectly. In some places Chopin's music was simply dripping with pathos. If anything, Agnes looked a little old for this part, because Marie (her real name) was only 23 years old and considered one of the most beautiful women in Paris when she died, but Agnes played the part of a woman dying of tuberculosis brilliantly.

If not, I can tell you it is a very touching love story. It's a story about a prostitute, pure and simple, but told in such a way that by the end of the novel you may believe this prostitute was a virgin, the way the author toys with your sympathies.

3850105,5,B0025XW95E,"One of my favorite ballets, and also among the favorite roles of Agns Letestu and Aurlie Dupont.  My 1st blu-ray and it looks fantastic, especially in the medium and close shots (I have an older 1080i set, not the current 1080p which I imagine would be even better).  I saw Aurlie Dupont in the role in Paris last February; she was magnificent, but I love Agns Letestu's performance on this disc.  The only thing I miss from the live performance is Michal Denard (Armand's father) who was off to the left in front of the proscenium throughout most of Act I, as if remembering episodes from Armand and Marguerite's life.  He was perfectly still, but a very magnetic presence and it added something special to the production.  I don't know why they didn't keep that for the filming, fading from him to each scene, or perhaps it was something new they added in 2010.  But in short, the music of Chopin, the choreography of John Neumeier, the production of the Paris Opera, and superlative performances in the primary and even secondary roles make this a very special ballet that I'm glad to own, and hope will also inspire my daughter one day.",1290816000,,1140,4.618811881188119
3850106,5,B0025XW95E,"Acclaimed John Neumeier created this ballet (premiered in November 1978)for the Stuttgarter Ballet and his friend Marcia Hayde who danced the first Margerite. He followed Dumas'novel closely and chose Chopin's music as score to his choreography (one of the two composers suggested by conductor Gerhard Markson - either Chopin or Berlioz, or both). In fact, Chopin's music proved to be essential to the drama, the polish composer having been a contemporary of Dumas Fils and Marie(Alphonsine)Duplessis whose real three-year love affair the writer himself immortalised first in a novel(1848)and later in a play (1852).Curiously, Chopin had also died of tuberculosis, like Marie - Marguerite Gautier in the novel. Chopin's exalted music thus underlines truthfully the whole ballet contributing to its great romantic dimention. Neumeier chose to paralell the story of Armand and Marguerite to Abb's Des Grieux and Manon whose passion also meets death in the end. The ominous performance of Manon Lescault in the theater where they first meet will follow their own destinies,Neumeir ingeniously creating a drama within a drama.
toiles Jos Martinez and Delphine Moussin are Des Grieux and Manon:they dance beautifully, bestowing their solid technique as well as Dorothe Gilbert(Prudence Duvernoy) and Karl Paquette(Gaston Rieux).A chance to watch again Michal Denard(a retired toile who dances, along with Nureyev and Thesmar,Lacotte's Marco Spada - Rome,1982 - on a DVD released last year)playing Armand Duval's father.
What about Marguerite er Armand? In fact, in my humble opinion, Agns Letestu is undoubtedly unforgettable as a dancer and as an actress. Her beauty and her superior technique have the companionship of her acting which overwhelms you. If the close-up reveals not a 23 year-old Marguerite but a mature woman, on the other side it gives the viewer the chance to feel Letestu's immense, pathetic sadness (Marguerite knows death is approaching), her eyes filled with passion and despair, each gesture crying out her misery. Stphane Bouillon(certainly a future toile) offers a passionate Armand, executing Neumeier's difficult steps with brilliance,responding accurately to Letestu's chemistry. A special reference to the pianists(F.Vaysse-Knitter and E.Strosser)who play Chopin's music warmly. The costumes are superb(Jrgen Rose), Schmidtsdorf's conducting excellent. Absolutely not to loose. Last but not the least, the blu-ray offers a most perfect image.",1269820800,3,2467,5.706521739130435

3850108,5,B0025XW95E,"If you ask me 2 of the best neo-classical ballet productions that came out in blu-ray in 2009 would be Frederick Ashton's whimsical version of Herold's La Fille Mal Gardee with Carlos ACosta and Marianela Nunez, and this wonderful Lady of the Camelias disc with the stars of the Paris Opera Ballet. Completely different in character they nevertheless represent the cream of last year's crop.
The tale of a French courtesan,torn between amour of the professional kind and personal love, withs its inevitable tragic ending has been made well known in opera by Massenet and Puccini( Manon Lescaut) and Verdi (La Traviata). Indeed Verdi wrote the story of his famous work after attending Dumas' play La Dame Aux Camelias, so we know who begot what. Now, along comes John Neumeier's creation of a full length narrative ballet based on Dumas's play using the piano music of Chopin, and what a tour de force this is.
First off, the choreography is astounding. And the famous stars of the the Paris Opera Ballet do it full justice, with flawless dancing that will take your breath away. Agnes Letestu shows why she is so highly regarded in the rarefied world of the ballet etoile with a stunning performance here as Marguerite Gautier, the famous courtesan. Her male partner Stephane Bullion, whose smoldering looks would set more than a few female hearts palpitating,is equally brilliant and their riveting pas de deux in Acts 2 and 3 can only be described as ravishing. In equal parts tender, passionate and even erotic, and set to the slow movement of Chopin's Opus 58 piano sonata in B flat minor, these are magical performances you would want to watch and re-watch.  Noteworthy too is Dorothee Gilbert, whose beauty and grace make a deep impression. The sets are interesting, the costumes beautiful and the dancing by the corps de ballet excellent and especially in the Country scene exuberant and memorable. If you are like me (so used to lavish orchestral scores for ballet), you may wonder whether a sparse piano solo, even if it is Chopin, would really 'do' for a full length dance drama, but have no fear, it works very  well with the wonderful choreography. So there you have it. Five stars , nothing less.",1268265600,14,2209,4.841269841269841
3850109,2,B0025XW95E,"I agree with other reviewers that the Blueray filming & costumes were excellent. However, the most important thing about a ballet is the choreography, and here it it frequently boring. I also don't feel that Chopin's music fits the story or the choreography very well, so sometimes it seems to be simply background music unrelated to what is happening on stage.",1266883200,3,361,4.934426229508197
3850110,5,B0025XW95E,"Again, another one I bought just to see Stephane Bullion. He's so romantic and passionate in this one. There are some strong suggestions of sex, so I don't really reccomend this for children. It's not just Stephane that makes this good. The whole thing is good. I think it has a good storyline, too.",1266451200,5,299,4.555555555555555
8351410,5,B0025XW95E,"By and large, I agree with the other 5-star reviews.
Interweaving the Marguerite Gautier and Manon Lescaut stories is effective and poignant.  It would be even more so if it were more clearly emphasized that Manon dies in the arms of her lover, whereas Marguerite dies alone.
One small observation on the choreography: in my opinion, there are too many lifts (Marguerite/Armand).",1517184000,,379,5.112903225806452

8351413,3,B0025XW95E,"It goes without saying that the music is splendid, The quality of the color and sound of the blu ray is superb. So musically and technically I have no comments. My principal criticism is with the choreography. It's of the modern 'dance' idiom involving a lot of statuesque lifting, bending and contorting which, to me, adds little to the story line and doesn't blend with the flow of the music. Some parts are a bit comical. During a few sequences of emotional lifting the ballerinas volumous dress falls over the lifters eyes so he can't see where he's going but she surreptitiously pushes them away while maintaining in her dramatic pose. The second act, after the Piano Concerto, consists of more or less conventional ballet to waltzes and other Chopin miniatures. This is truly delightful but it's not long before the 'neo-dancing' is resumed. It's a pity because ones mind is distracted by the contortions and loses track of the story and the music.",1418256000,,954,4.823170731707317

8351415,5,B0025XW95E,"I never imagined that a ballet could transmit more emotions than the opera,in this case LA TRAVIATA. Agnes Letestu and Stephane Bullion deliver a choreography so filled with love and despair you will reach for a Kleenex.
Dorothe Gilbert is also a joy to see.
The rest of the corps de ballet is also very good. In a word ,a masterpiece!",1390262400,,335,4.508196721311475

There won't be any spoilers, only enlightenment.",1388534400,2,411,4.971014492753623
8351417,5,B0025XW95E,"I could find no fault at all with this performance or the manner in which it is presented.  The music is superb, of course, being Chopin's piano music. and it complements the performance without ever being intrusive.",1388448000,,216,4.837837837837838
8351418,5,B0025XW95E,"This is a beautifully filmed presentation of a wonderful ballet.  With close ups, you get to see the dancers act, showing their emotions, something you would miss in your seat in the second balcony.  Agnes Letestu and the entire cast are terrific.  The Chopin score is so emotionally charged, it perfectly fits the varying moods.  The instrumentalists, especially the pianists, are superb throughout.  The DVD includes a helpful synopsis of the story and a documentary that features interviews with the dancers, the ballet's creator, the costume designer, and others.  Very informative.

As I write this, in late 2013, Agnes Letestu has just retired as an active dancer.  Her last performance with the Paris Opera Ballet company was in this ballet.  This DVD serves as a fitting tribute to a great dancer in a role that fit her perfectly.",1384473600,,838,5.0144927536231885

There is no arguing with the 5-star reviews that as a modern form of visual entertainment (movie), this product is awesome. So if you don't care about this product's ability to recreate the stage as it was during the actual performance, my advise is to STOP READING AND BUY IT NOW.

The rest of this review views this film as a STAGE PERFORMANCE, where you would expect to observe the stage as a whole and find harmony across on-stage performers. And this is precisely what this product fails to deliver.

** THE BALLET ON STAGE **
I will start by saying that ballet-wise, this production is top-notch. Its placement of props shines with a strong sense of aesthetics. Its costumes are elaborate, yet not superficial. Its staging is action-packed, yet it leaves ample space for the audience to breathe. And its dance moves are breathtaking. Overall, the stage reminds me of professional European floral arrangement. If I were to review this production for its ballet, it would definitely have been 5 stars.

** THE BALLET IN THE FILM **
But the film makers put a ton of effort into making sure they deliver a movie. They piece together lots of zoomed in camera shots of important actions, at the cost of rarely filming the entire stage. The problem with this particular La Dame aux Camelias is that it is so action-packed across the stage that it's impossible to capture everything with cameras zoomed in on particular characters.

The stage is very frequently divided into 3-4 groups of people. Each group plays their own roles--and the film makers decided to zoom in on all groups. They even went so far as to
- insert zoomed-in facial expressions of non-moving groups right in the center of a ballet dance, and
- zoom in on 2 dancers when the whole stage of 12 dancers is dancing. (this may not seem much if you are used to watching ballets or ice performances involving 2 people only. But if you, like me, watch this as a stage performance, you're concerned with how the group balances the stage. And every member on the stage is crucial to the balance. You cannot zoom in on 2 performers without overthrowing that balance.)

The end result is that we get an constant stream of scene cuts that makes it impossible to capture the stage as a whole, miss lots of off-camera details, and cuts all ballets into small segments.

** IS IT POSSIBLE TO CAPTURE THE STAGE? **
The film makers also put in a few shots of the whole screen from time to time, enough for me to tell that these shots can indeed capture the stage with all of its details. It is these screens that remind me of the professional European Floral Arrangement. So yes, the stage can indeed be captured. But these shots appear so  infrequently in this product, and they have such short duration, that I simply cannot grasp the 3-hour stage performance from this product.

** CONCLUSION **
Overall, the superfluous change in camera angles really destroys the ballet's harmony and flow and makes this product edgily unpleasant to watch as a stage performance.",1357344000,6,3058,4.6604823747680895
