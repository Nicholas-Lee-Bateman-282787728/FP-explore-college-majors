8229445,3,B000XSKDJM,"DVD Review: Good Picture in 2:35 ratio, good subs (I guess), and all that.

Movie Review: It's not a bad movie but it's too lighthearted for my tastes. The lead chick is cute, personality driven with a tight butt and nice boobs and can carry the movie through but I just don't give a crap. I get why people like this film but I prefer the Pinky Violence movies to be more dramatic and bloody and psychotic. So THERE!

Conclusion: 4 stars for the DVD and 3 stars for Delinquent Girl Boss: Blossoming Night Dreams.",1426118400,,512,4.378947368421053
8229446,4,B000XSKDJM,"Terrible storyline. Excellent reminiscences of the '70s, nevertheless, if you are interested in Japanese culture. It is worth to buy this DVD even only for the scene of singing by Keiko Fuji.",1423008000,,191,5.0
8229447,5,B000XSKDJM,I'm happy with the price of this classic movie. Thanks for selling such an interesting title. Best of luck to your company.,1403222400,,123,4.636363636363637
8229448,5,B000XSKDJM,"Delinquent Girl Boss: Blossoming Night Dreams is a Pink Violence classic starring Reiko Oshida and Junko Miyazono. This is one of my favorites; though I have so many favorites: Sasori series, Rica Trilogy, Bohachi Bushido, Lady Snowblood 1 and 2, Zero Woman Red Handcuffs, Legend Of The Poisonous Seductress Trilogy, Sex & Fury, Female Yakuza Tale, Stray Cat Rock series, Girl Boss Guerilla, Girl Boss Sukeban (Sukeban series) and so many more. Definitely a must-buy if you enjoy these kinds of films.",1262476800,2,501,5.121951219512195
8229449,5,B000XSKDJM,"One of my favorite pinky violence films from the 70's - it is pretty much a rehashed, done to death story, but what makes this one stand out is the performance of Reiko Ooshida!",1252108800,2,177,4.235294117647059
8229450,4,B000XSKDJM,"A comedic and often self-parodic entry, DELINQUENT GIRL BOSS: BLOSSOMING NIGHT DREAMS is a fun and undemanding way to spend an hour and a half.
Reiko Oshida is certainly not of the screen-grabbing caliber of hell-raisers Miki Sugimoto and Reiko Ike, but it's a light-weight movie that bears little comparison to the more hard-edged ""Pinky Violence"" stuff so she doesn't have to be. Spunky Reiko does have an unsophisticated charm which makes her an engaging enough lead, but all in all she's not in the same league as the other girls of her era.
The bulk of the story follows the usual routine of evil Yakuza boss without honor (although he is played as a direct parody) trying to swindle the local madam out of her hostess bar, in which Reiko works after being released from reform school.
One amusing moment early on has Reiko introducing herself full Yakuza-style to the most intentionally ludicrous bunch of trippy, hippy-gals who make up the local girl-gang. One of them even tells Reiko that she's been watching too many Yakuza films after her spiel!
We're presented with the stock-standard assortment of girls and an emasculated, comic-relief male. Notably one of the ""girls"" is actually a male cross-dresser who our tomboyish Reiko pals around with in a hilarious sequence when a rich old geezer arrives with his own red carpet!!! In fact that whole scene in the restaurant with the old guy is a real hoot and, maybe it's just me, but when he gropes Reiko on the way out her reaction seems to have more than a little genuine surprise about it! An ad-lib maybe?! There's also a fun fight with plenty of fan service that follows soon after.
Look out for the cool Junko Natsu who plays Oharu, Reiko's bad-girl rival. She steals most of the scenes she's in, especially at the start when she attacks a bride! (Yep, really!)
DELINQUENT GIRL BOSS is mostly played for laughs but the movie takes a more serious tone in the last 30 minutes or so and in all fairness it becomes a bit camp in its pathos. Thankfully the mock-seriousness is only shortlived and the showdown in a pachinko parlor is worthwhile for its mix of goofy slapstick with bloody swordplay and an outfit that Reiko wears which can only be described as a tribute to Pocahontas!",1248048000,4,2244,4.712468193384224
