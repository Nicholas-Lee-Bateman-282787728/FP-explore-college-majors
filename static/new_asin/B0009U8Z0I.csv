8066663,5,B0009U8Z0I,"I was shocked to read a review about how ""violent"" these animated stories are.  Not at all.  They are family cartoons and have a great spirit about them.  They end on a positive note and are true to the Bible.  My children have watched them over and over and have learned wonderful lessons from the scriptures.  Many of my friends' children also watch these animated stories and love them.  They are uplifting and contain beautiful, touching songs which bring a warm feeling into our home.
There is far more violence in your average TV cartoon than in these Bible stories.",1307318400,2,572,4.67
8066664,1,B0009U8Z0I,"All these vidoes are too violent.  None of them end on a positive note.  I was looking for a good kids' movie that focused on the true meaning of christmas.  Well, this one it not it.  You would think it would stop with the birth of Christ but it ends with killing all the babies. They all go way too far and focus on the violence.  My kids don't even want to watch them because of all the violence.",1272585600,,399,4.0
