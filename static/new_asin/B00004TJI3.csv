7922806,1,B00004TJI3,I got the DVD(not the video) as a gift but it was clearly just a dupe of the video.  Here the summarization:  There is a 5 minute speach/introduction while two people on of which could be Otsuka is doing Kihon Kumite in the background.  After the first five minutes there is no longer any commentary and the quality of the footage gets progressively worse.  By the end you can barely see what is going on.  This is the complete commercialization of the Martial Arts and is not worth the DVD/Video Tape itself.,1198454400,,509,4.489130434782608
