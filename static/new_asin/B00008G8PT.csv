I thought this would be a cute show like with mecha robots, but, yuck, it's just---all over the place! the story-line, well, their isn't one! I have to admit the animation is very crisp, but the voice actors stink, everythings just so wrong. When i rented this from block-bursters, i thought i'd like it, but---nope! a definate 2-out-of-five! (because i like the theme song!)",1162944000,,427,4.944444444444445
7982959,4,B00008G8PT,"I'm not quite sure why I never paid any attention to this series.  Other than the fact that robot fighting machines are not my preferred anime genre, especially when manned by psychic young ladies who tend to be nasty or grumpy with each other.  After a brief momentary lapse in which I viewed that introductory OVA and actually enjoyed it I decided to check out the series.  While the story is indeed what I thought it was, it's also something else entirely, and that hard to define something else is what makes this series a success where similar stories fail.

Sakura Shinjugi is a young woman with a talent for spiritual swordsmanship.  She is called to Tokyo to join the Imperial Flower Combat Troop and defend the capital from demonic invasions.  What Sakura finds, a theatrical troop that spends their off hours riding giant robots and slaughtering demons, is not quite what she expected.  She starts off on the wrong foot with everyone especially Kanzaki Sumire - obnoxious grand-daughter of the man who has invented the spiritual armor the troop uses, Maria Tachibana - first captain of the team, and Iris Chateaubriand - a very young and powerful psychic.

Part of Sakura's problems come from finding herself in a team, when she has previously been alone.  She starts off rushing into things without any thought, to the discomfiture of all.  She lacks self confidence, and fears her own powers.  Even so, by the end of this first DVD she has found a niche and we, as viewer. Have reached a level of comfort with the dynamics of the team.  Other than Sumire, for whom there is no hope at all.

There actually isn't all that much fighting in these first episodes.  What makes things tick is the writing and acting, which are surprisingly good for a television series of this type.  The artwork is well done as well, which a lot of use of shadow and close shots to build the atmospherics.  As I did the film, I found myself enjoying the DVD in spite of myself.  It's easy enough to see why Sakura Wars became a hit.",1128816000,3,2022,4.603351955307263
7982960,5,B00008G8PT,"now, this is a very cool title! steam powered robots and tanks in a fedual time along with aristocratic ninjas, a very interesting combination! not only is this a popular anime, but the action figures are a hot seller as well! the storyline is almost like a clan war based theme and the animation is quite good.",1127865600,,311,4.473684210526316
7982961,5,B00008G8PT,"Sakura Wars is a great series. ADV films did a fantastic job realsing this series.
Sakura Wars is a fantastic series you won't be disaponted
The ova and movie can be boring but the tv series rules.",1072396800,3,197,4.351351351351352
7982962,4,B00008G8PT,"I've never played the game(s) but I know in #1, you play as Ohgami, who is not introduced until episode 4 (of the 5 on this disc). I thought this was odd, but the first three focus on Sakura and the other members of the group, letting you get to know them.  Thus, it starts off a bit slowly but picks up speed towards the end of the disc. You really have to watch the whole disc before you decide whether you like it or not.
The music sounded very unique to me. Oftentimes, the tones would catch my attention and make me listen further. It's a nice, rich sound.
I didn't listen to the dub and had no issues with the orginal voice actors.
The graphic presentation is very...varied. Mad House (the studio) used a variety of filters on the video so sometimes it looks like you're watching a weak TV signal, a film reel, etc. For the most part, they used soft colours, which take a bit of getting used to.
My box is slightly snug around the DVDs, but it's not hard too get them out.
Overall, looks to be an interesting ride.",1071273600,,1020,4.204081632653061
7982963,4,B00008G8PT,"I'm not too happy about the Sakura Wars TV series. First off, the first episodes are filled with Sakura torture and that's about it. Ohgami enters and things get a little more lighter, but things don't get good until Kohran and Kanna enter...which is around episode 6 or 7.
The good: simple and sometimes beautiful animation with soft colors. There's a lot more character development to be found in this series which is great.
The bad: Sometimes the animation goes from good to fair to poor to REALLY poor. All the characters, except for Sakura, Kohran and Kanna, have completely changed. Maria is extremely, extremely cold which ticks me off because in the first OVAs, she was the only one who accepted Sakura before Kohran and Kanna came. Sumire is a mega-you-know-what now but thankfully, she gets better as the series goes on. Iris is extremely quiet and not cheery at all. Her lines constist of those breathy sounds she does and whimpering. But what really urks me is the overall darker tone of the series. Blood, violence and people being chopped in half, I dunno... I miss the lighter mood of the games and OVAs. Plus Orihime and Reni only make a 30 second appearance later on in a film reel. (Boo!)
I strongly recommend that if you know the story of Sakura Wars, you skip this DVD and get the others. If you really want it, prepare to be disappointed if you're a mega-fan of Sakura Wars like me. Although, that's my opinion...
I gave it four stars because ADV's dvd deserves it! Extras include production sketches, clean opening and closing animation (I love the closing animation!)and a printed booklet with background information ^_^. And once again, listen to the Japanese version...for the love of corn... XP;;;",1048896000,5,1723,4.765886287625418
