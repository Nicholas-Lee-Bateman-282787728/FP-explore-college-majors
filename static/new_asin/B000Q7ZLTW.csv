I highly suggest Amazon.com for those hard to find items or bargains that people are searching for - 'thanks Amazon.com'",1209427200,,224,5.25
2833907,1,B000Q7ZLTW,This was okay... and I'm glad it was on dvd.. I don't think it would have made it at the theatre...,1203638400,,99,3.761904761904762
2833908,5,B000Q7ZLTW,"I can see why this movie when straight to DVD.  The sistas would NOT support it!

Because it provides a critical look at why many sistas are alone.  This is the type of movie Tyler Perry will not make...he would lose his female following.  Too many black women are in denial and focused solely on the black men whom they have dated or had been married to.

I was gleefully surprised to see that a woman provided the storyline and co-produced the film!

I recommend this film to men and women.",1203120000,7,492,4.351648351648351
2833909,5,B000Q7ZLTW,"Jazsmin Lewis, who plays Traci, is on-screen for almost every minute of this movie.  And that's a GOOD thing.  Lewis is just unbelievably beautiful and it's fun to watch her in this movie.  She has really nice legs and she and the producer take every opportunity to show them off - to the point of being very obvious that this was intended to be part of the production.  And the plot is very, very good also.  Women these days go around wondering why no man wants to marry them.  This movie explains it.",1202428800,5,503,4.354838709677419
2833910,3,B000Q7ZLTW,"I did not enjoy this movie that much. It was a low budget film to me.  Although you can relate to this, the jumping through scenes made it not so good.",1202342400,,151,3.870967741935484
2833911,4,B000Q7ZLTW,this movie was very good.the star as well as the other female actors were very pleasant to look at which sewed it up for me.the storyline is good also.i am looking forward to finding other movies starring this gorgeous star.,1200873600,,224,4.625
2833912,5,B000Q7ZLTW,This movie is one of my favorites. I could totally relate to Tracy and the things that she went through with these men. Sometimes ladies it's not all about us.,1196380800,6,159,4.333333333333333
2833913,5,B000Q7ZLTW,This is A good movie to watch for women who need A reality check sometimes we need someone to put a mirror in our faces to see who and what we truly are this is A real movie please check it out if your going around blaming your unhappiness on other people.,1190073600,5,256,3.9423076923076925
2833914,4,B000Q7ZLTW,"I thought it showed women the way they think, when you think you are all that and you find out you're not. You can be good in the bed but if you want a good man he wants it all, cause sex is not all a relationship is about",1187827200,6,222,3.5510204081632653
8195076,4,B000Q7ZLTW,"I enjoyed the movie. it was a quick watch, and interesting concept . Jazsmin Lewis looks stunning all throughout the movie and shines onscreen. This is also unofficially a foot fetish flick as the director gratuitously highlights Jazsmins' legs and pretty toes shamelessly. I'm talking point blank range shots of jazsmins Lewis's legs and feet. A good movie about self reflection and honest self evaluation",1489449600,,406,5.2615384615384615

8195081,2,B000Q7ZLTW,"This DVD is horrible, it displayed how not dealing with yourself, and your past issues, causes a person to be desperate and seek ""TIME AND ATTENTION"" from anyone willing to give it to the main character with no regard for her self esteem. And there was no plot or display of other ways that were neutral and/or positive to get through the tough issues in life, and that homosexuality with desperate weak-minded emotionally neurotic so-called supportive female friends is ""OK"", to me it is not.",1375142400,,493,4.811764705882353
8195082,5,B000Q7ZLTW,"I would recommend this movie.  Perhaps it is silly, but I appreciate seeing my own name as part of the movie title!",1370995200,2,115,4.2272727272727275
8195083,5,B000Q7ZLTW,This Is Good Stuff Anything Possible In Love And War. Great Art Work Here . Things Waver Back And forth well Through-Out. No One Screen Told The Outcome You Earned My 5 Stars.,1369353600,,175,4.333333333333333
8195084,4,B000Q7ZLTW,"Good movie, entertaining from beginning to end! Real life situations depicted. It didn't hurt that the lead actress is easy on the eyes, either.",1324252800,,144,5.041666666666667
8195085,5,B000Q7ZLTW,"I got the DVD in a timely manner, the quality of this product is excellent, I have previously seen the movie so I knew what to expect from it. I saw this movie on TV and I randomly watched it and enjoyed it. I ususally watch free movies on the internet and was disapointed when I could not find this particular film. Then I found it on amazon for a cheap price and I jumped at it because I have already seen the movie. If you haven't seen any movie I wouldn't recommend you purchase any movie because you might be disapointed. But like I said, I have already seen the movie and was excited when I recieved it in the mail in a timely matter.",1319500800,,640,4.087301587301587
