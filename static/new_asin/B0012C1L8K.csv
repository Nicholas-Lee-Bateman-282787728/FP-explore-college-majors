So, I'm not Russian, I'm not too familiar with modern Russian films outside of the Night, Day, whatever trilogy, and thus, probably shouldn't even be reviewing this flick.  But for those of you out there who just looked at the cover art and thought, well, hey this might be a cool, badass Russian action picture to purchase, stand warned that A) There's not a whole lot of action and B) it becomes mind-numbingly surreal, and I'm not talking in a heavy message Ferreri or Antonioni kind of way.  I think what I was seeing was a little punk Alice in Wonderland mixed in with a not-so-futuristic Mad Max vibe.  Woman reporter is assigned a story to uncover more about a deranged serial killer who's being held at an insane asylum.  Said killer then escapes into a deserted Russian village (remnants of the old Communist planned community thing), and our girl finds herself dropped down (literally by helicopter) right into this closed society of anarchic deviants.  I'm not even going to try to continue with what turns out to be, hell, to me anyway, a lot of disjointed vignettes, which lead up to some sort of vision in a department store window (really, I should've hit the vodka way before I put this DVD in).  Good luck, turn down the lights, and watch some Junk, er, Zhest'.",1285545600,,1290,4.656387665198238
