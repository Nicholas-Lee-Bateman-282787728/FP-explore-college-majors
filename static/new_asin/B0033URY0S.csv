4065637,5,B0033URY0S,"JAMAICA INN [1939 / 2016] [75th Anniversary Edition] [Blu-ray + DVD] [UK Release] Superb Direction . . . Charles Laughton is Colourful and Sinister! An Entertaining and Surprisingly Dark Period Drama!

Here is a rediscovered classic by the master of suspense, fully restored in 4K in collaboration with the British Film Institute from an archival picture negative. Alfred Hitchcock turned to the work of Daphne Du Maurier a number of times throughout his career. When he made the move to Hollywood, Alfred Hitchcock adapted her novel Rebecca, the end results securing the Academy Award for Best Picture. When he needed to follow up the ground-breaking horror of Psycho, and adapted her short story The Birds and created another milestone of the genre. JAMAICA INN is based on Daphne Du Mauriers classic tale of wreckers in 19th century Cornwall.

In this dark period drama, recently orphaned Mary Yellan [Maureen O Hara] in her first major film role, arrives at Jamaica Inn from Ireland to live with her aunt. Unaware that it serves as the headquarters for a murderous gang responsible for shipwrecks along the Cornish coast, she soon finds herself embroiled in backstabbing; conspiracy and villainy presided over by the local squire, Sir Humphrey Pengallan [Charles Laughton] and Mary Yellans efforts to stop their wicked ways lead her down a path filled with murder and betrayal.

Though dominated by Charles Laughtons wonderfully flamboyant performance, JAMAICA INN also finds room for a rogue s gallery of British character actors including Robert Newton [David Leans Oliver Twist], Basil Radford [The Lady Vanishes], Leslie Banks [The Most Dangerous Game] and Mervyn Johns [Dead of Night]. It also stands out as one of the most atmospheric of Alfred Hitchcocks British films as well as one of his most unfairly neglected works. JAMAICA INN was the first of Alfred Hitchcock's adaptations of Daphne Du Maurier's novels including REBECCA and THE BIRDS. It was also Alfred Hitchcock's last film made in the UK before coming to America. The 75th Anniversary Edition of the original theatrical release of JAMAICA INN.'

FILM FACT: Besides Charles Laughton and Maureen O'Hara, secondary characters are played by several notable stage-and-screen character actors of the time, including ""bruiser-type"" actor Leslie Banks (who played General Zharov in 'The Most Dangerous Game') as Joss Merlin, and Robert Newton in an uncharacteristic role as James 'Jem' Traherne, a suave young secret-police agent. In March 1939, Hitchcock moved to Hollywood to begin his contract with David O. Selznick. Thus, as it was said in the beginning of this article, JAMAICA INN ' was his last British picture, as well as one of his most successful. It is the last film Alfred Hitchcock made in the United Kingdom before he moved to the United States. The film is a period piece set in Cornwall in 1819; and the real Jamaica Inn still exists, and is on the edge of Bodmin Moor, which is in the north-eastern part of Cornwall in England. The film still garnered a large profit of US $3.7 million, a huge success at the time at the box office. Daphne du Maurier was not pleased with the finished production and for a while considered withholding the film rights to the film Rebecca.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: JAMAICA INN [1939] is set in 19th century the county of Cornwall, that is situated on Englands rugged southwestern tip, and Jamaica Inn is home to a group of pirates who make their living by robbing ships that run aground on the treacherous nearby coast. Their schemes begin to unravel with the arrival of a young Irish woman Mary Yellen [Maureen O'Hara] who uncovers their plot with the help of a dashing undercover naval officer. A ship runs aground off the Cornish coast near Jamaica Inn, somebody having extinguished the beacon, and some men kill all the surviving sailors and loot the cargo. Mary Yellen, is the orphaned niece of Joss Merlyn [Leslie Banks] the innkeeper, is heading for Jamaica Inn to live there but the carriage driver refuses to stop there, instead dumping her outside the house of Sir Humphrey Pangellan [Charles Laughton], who takes her to her destination.

The opening scene of the ship being lured onto the rocks and the smugglers rushing down to slaughter the crew is vivid and very well pulled off, the cutting from a quite impressive model of the ship to the actors trying to steer it to safety and the smugglers on the rocks, all in Elstree Studios huge water tank, being almost seamless. The brutality of the killing of the sailors, though bloodless, is quite shocking, especially when one guy seems to survive and a smuggler goes to knife him off-screen.

'JAMAICA INN [1939] was the first of three Daphne Du Maurier adaptations that Alfred Hitchcock directed, which would seem to indicate something of the esteem in which he held the novelist. (The other two films were, of course, 'Rebecca' [1940] and 'The Birds' [1963]. But in fact it was lead actor Charles Laughton who initially suggested that Alfred Hitchcock direct the project. Charles Laughton had just established a production company named Mayflower Films with the famed German producer Erich Pommer, who had relocated to England after the rise of the Nazis in Germany. From the very start 'JAMAICA INN was conceived as a starring vehicle for Charles Laughton, and the presence of a competing creative force in the film  perhaps contributed to Alfred Hitchcock's general unease about directing it. During this time Alfred Hitchcock also read the galleys for the soon-to-be-published 'Rebecca' and decided at once to adapt as his first feature in Hollywood.

Mary Yellen [Maureen O'Hara], a young Irish woman whose parents  have passed away, has come to Cornwall to stay with her aunt Patience Merlyn [Marie Ney] and Patience's husband Joss Merlyn  [Leslie Banks], who manages the seaside Jamaica Inn. Mary Yellen discovers that Joss Merlyn heads a gang of criminals who use a beacon to lure ships to their doom on the rocks, then slaughter the men on board and seize the valuables. Unbeknownst to all except Joss Merlyn [Leslie Banks], the mastermind behind the scheme is none other than Sir Humphrey Pengallan [Charles Laughton], a local magistrate who has a predilection for beautiful objects, becomes obsessed with Mary Yellen and decides he must possess her. But when Mary Yellen saves the life of James 'Jem' Traherne [Robert Newton], a member of the gang wrongly accused of skimming the loot, and falls in love with him, and Mary Yellens own life is suddenly in danger.

With Charles Laughton setting the pace then, which is jolly enough, though slower than Alfred Hitchcock would have liked, 'JAMAICA INN has become a pardonably free translation of Daphne Du  Maurier's romantic novel about the disreputable tavern on the Cornish coast in the Eighteenth century where an innocent country girl, seeking her Aunt Patience, found herself in a den of ship-wreckers and murderers led by her uncle under the secret patronage of the local squire, Sir Humphrey Pengallan. The unmasking of the squire, who loves nice things and never lets us forget the strain of insanity in the Sir Humphrey Pengallan breed, is a matter less of suspense than of straightforward narration, but the tale-spinning has been glib and picturesque.

There are other virtues, especially the marvellous Maureen O'Hara, who is lovely, and who plays Mary Yellen well this side of ing&eacute;nue hysteria, with charming naturalness and poise, with even a trace of self-control in her screams. Leslie Banks is capital as Joss Merlyn, the wrecker ringleader, with a fine crew of cutthroats around him and Emlyn Williams, Wylie Watson, Edwin Greenwood among them. Marie Ney as the girl's aunt, Robert Newton as the undercover man, George Curzon as one of Sir Humphrey's blanker friends is splendid in their degree.

Daphne Du Maurier's original novel of Jamaica Inn contains of many elements from gothic literature, including a bleak, windswept landscape, a mysterious inn, and violent passions, anticipating the author's full embrace of the genre in 'Rebecca.' Alfred Hitchcock and his screenwriters made some significant changes to the original story: in the book Mary Yellan's love interest was Joss Merlyn's younger brother and the villain was a mad vicar named Davey. Naturally, Charles Laughton had that juicy part in mind for himself. However, since they wanted to achieve the widest possible distribution in the USA, they decided to consult with the Hays Production Code Administration during the script development stage. Not surprisingly, the American censors balked at the idea of a clergyman being the villain, so the scriptwriters invented the character of Sir Humphrey Pengallan instead. During its original cinema release, 'JAMAICA INN was usually regarded as more of a Charles Laughton vehicle than an Alfred Hitchcock film.

Blu-ray Video Quality  This brand new 4K restoration look of 'JAMAICA INN is totally stunning and especially with its 1080p encoded image and equally presented in the 1.37:1 aspect ratio, the image is incredibly stable throughout, offering impressive amounts of fine detail. Contrast is very solid, providing deep blacks and impressively gradated grey scale. Resolution is superb. This is just a pristine restoration. The results here are by and large stupendous, offering a wonderfully stable smooth looking image which preserves its natural grain field while offering excellent amounts of fine detail. Contrast is solid, providing support for some lustrously deep blacks and impressively graduated grey scale. Resolution is so much improved that at times it seems possible to see little snippets of spirit gum affixed to Charles Laughton's face in order to give him his comically bushy eyebrows. Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  This 'JAMAICA INN Blu-ray disc features an uncompressed 1.0 LPCM Audio Mono track which is much better than expected, especially with the release of the previous inferior DVD release. The sounds are quite full throughout, with just a slight drop in the upper registers. Dialogue is very clean throughout, with no notable hisses or pops. Any age related wear and tear has been largely mitigated by the brilliant restorative process, and the result is a very commendable and listenable audio track.

Special Feature: Shipwrecked in a Studio: The Making of Alfred Hitchcocks JAMAICA INN [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [13:05] A visual essay by Donald Spoto, author of The Dark Side Of Genius: The Life Of Alfred Hitchcock and Spellbound by Beauty: Alfred Hitchcock and His Leading Ladies. This is a new video essay which is hosted by author Donald Spoto, and here we get to see on camera Donald Spoto, talking about the genius of the director Alfred Hitchcock. Donald Spoto tells us that in the 1930s, an Irish teenager, Maureen Fitzsimmons [Maureen O'Hara] had considerable success on stage in her native Dublin, but everything changed when Maureen Fitzsimmons met Charles Laughton, the famous actor and producer and was very impressed when he met Maureen Fitzsimmons and decided to put her under an exclusive contract to  Charles Laughton, who then decided to change her name to Maureen O'Hara, which in her autobiography hated the name and always referred herself in later life as Maureen Fitzsimmons. Charles Laughton decided to cast her in the 1936 Daphne Du Maurier best-selling novel Jamaica Inn and of course the film was directed by Alfred Hitchcock, who hated making the film, which was shot in September and October of 1938, after his great success of the film 'The Lady Vanishes' and his outr&eacute; expressionist style of filming was when Alfred Hitchcock worked in Berlin and Munich film studios in the 1920s. In the Daphne Du Maurier novel, the leading character was a sadistic parson of the church, which Alfred Hitchcock wanted to be portrayed in the film, but because of the Hays Code of Censorship restrictions, the character had to be changed to a deranged sadistic country squire, and of course Alfred Hitchcock was very upset, as he loved to challenge the system, especially of the split personality of the Charles Laughton character in the film. Alfred Hitchcock was exasperated and frustrated with Charles Laughton, because of his erratic behaviour and attitude in wanting to take too many takes of a certain scene, but because Charles Laughton was the producer, Alfred Hitchcock hands were tied. But when Charles Laughton direct Charles Laughton in the 1947 film 'The Paradine Case' Charles Laughton had mellowed quite a lot and was perfect in his role in the film as the sadistic judge character. JAMAICA INN was a total nightmare to film and several actors were injured and one died from pneumonia, but the critics praised the look of the film, especially when the ship crashes on the rocks, and especially amazing, as it was all filmed in the Elstree Studios in London. Because Daphne Du Maurier novel had long sprawling pages of words, Alfred Hitchcock had to bring in the great English playwright J. B. Priestley, and the witty dialogue was contributed by Emlyn Williams, who is the main villainous character in JAMAICA INN. Despite everyone's effort, especially all of the writers, Daphne Du Maurier complained about the film not being true to her novel, but of course the novel is always going to be slightly different from the film in many ways and at one point Daphne Du Maurier was contemplating withholding the rights to two of her films, especially 'Rebeca' and JAMAICA INN, but because David O. Selznick offered Daphne Du Maurier a substantial heavy money incentive, the author dropped her claim of was contemplating withholding the rights. Donald Spoto points out that Maureen O'Hara is the only surviving member of the entire team of 'Jamaica Inn' and in 2014 Maureen O'Hara celebrated her 94th Birthday. Another interesting fact that Donald Spoto mentions, is that in Cornwall in England, there is indeed a lodging place named Jamaica Inn and dates from the 18th Century and was originally a haven for smugglers and pirates and it both inspired Daphne Du Maurier novel and Alfred Hitchcock film and to day you can actually visit the Jamaica Inn in Cornwall and stay in their cosy rooms, but beware, as many a visitor informs us that the place is haunted by a crew of very disturbed ghosts. So there ends a really fascinating insight into the behind-the-scenes of the making of the Alfred Hitchcock 'Jamaica Inn' film and this special is well worth viewing. The only slightly negative aspect to this Donal Spoto special is that you can actually see him reading either his notes or a script of some sort.

Theatrical Trailer [1939] [1080p] [1.37:1] [1:26] This is a re-release of the Original Theatrical Trailer for the film JAMAICA INN, but this time it is presented in a stunning 4K presentation. Just shows you how the professional video company Arrow Academy can produce something spectacular with this Blu-ray disc, and especially in conjunction with Cohen Media Group, can make an effort in spending considerable amount of money, so why can't other Video Companies do the same. But with this trailer, they announce that it is Alfred Hitchcocks Final British Film. S Rediscovered Classic Fully Restored in 4K. Based on the Novel by Daphe Du Maurier. Author of REBECCA and THE BIRDS. Official Selection CANNES CLASSICS Festival De Cannes 2014. NYFF52: The New York Film Festival 2014. All in all it is a brilliant presentation, especially showing off a brilliant stunning print.

Feature-length Audio Commentary by film critic Jeremy Arnold: Here we get an introduction to the film by the film critic Jeremy Arnold, and announces that you are watching the film JAMAICA INN' with him with this 1939 film, starring Charles Laughton and Maureen O'Hara and based on the novel by Daphne Du Maurier and directed by Alfred Hitchcock before he left England to pursue his career in Hollywood. Jeremy Arnold informs us that he personally has written about Movies and Hollywood over a very long period of time. Jeremy Arnold also informs us that the fact you are listening to his audio commentary, and hopefully it means you have already watched JAMAICA INN' and you also agree that the restoration people have done a fantastic job in producing this stunning and beautiful 4K restoration, but sadly mentions that the Alfred Hitchcock film has had a lot of critics who have said very disparaging negative remarks about this film and sadly Alfred Hitchcock rarely wanted to talk about JAMAICA INN.' Alfred Hitchcock had such a terrible negative experience in making the film, especially as Jeremy Arnold points out that people do not think it as a typical Alfred Hitchcock's film, but despite this, Jeremy Arnold thinks it is an enjoyable splendid film, exceptional British actors, and all of the professional people behind-the-scene who helped to make this film, which I totally agree with him 100%, especially with this stunning 4K restoration presentation, compared to the inferior and ghastly inferior DVD release that I use to have in my DVD collection. Jeremy Arnold talks extensively about the musical score, which is basically the samethroughout the film, until the end credits. Jeremy Arnold also points out that Alfred Hitchcock does not like to have lots of composed music in his films, and tends to make sound a much greater priority to be more prominent feature of his films. Another thing Jeremy Arnold points out that when we first see Charles Laughton acting as a madman, which was like his performance when Charles Laughton was in the 1933 Alexander Korda film 'The Private Life of Henry VIII.' We find out the process of how they eventually got to film JAMAICA INN,' where we have to go back to 1937, when  Charles Laughton was acting in a major film that was never complete and that was 'I, Claudius' which was produced by Alexander Korda and directed by Josef von Sternberg, and because the actress Merle Oberon had a nasty car accident and took a while to recover, it was a good excuse to close down the production of 'I, Claudius,' because it was going massively over budget, and consequently the film was never completed, but one nice consequence of this, the BBC used the existing footage in a 70-minute documentary 'The Epic That Never Was' [1965], which was hosted by Dirk Bogarde and featuring the opening of Thus Spoke Zarathustra composition. But because Charles Laughton felt he had no control over his destiny and his acting career and especially with any film he was involved in, especially in the directing and producing department, Charles Laughton decided to form a partnership with producer Erich Pommer  in 1937 and they named their new company Mayfair Pictures Corporation. When we get to Chapter 6, Jeremy Arnold mentions about the beautiful restoration of the print of JAMAICA INN' and is a total revelation, because for many decades there have been no good looking prints available of JAMAICA INN' or any good audio sound for that matter and is really first time in ages that anyone has had a chance to view and hear this film properly, and Jeremy Arnold feels the previous poor technical quality of the print up to now is a big reason why JAMAICA INN' has been so badly dismissed by its critics and he now hopes that will all changed when people see this stunning Blu-ray disc, which I totally agree with him 100%, because as I have informed you before, especially when I had the atrocious inferior DVD release and totally amazed how that Company was allowed to ever release such a bad quality video onto the DVD format and I soon dumped it out of my collection, that is why this print is totally awesome and you can now see what Alfred Hitchcock was trying to produce with this film. Jeremy Arnold also informs us the bizarre story about Maureen O'Hara getting married to a production assistant named Harry Brown, that Maureen states in her autobiography that she did not love the man, despite being winded and dined by the man while making 'Jamaica Inn' and near the end of the filming the gentleman invited Maureen out one last time and took her to a house that was already set up for a wedding and had a totally bizarre out of body experience and got married to Harry Brown, but the next thing to happen is that Maureen O'Hara is next on a ship going to America without Harry Brown, but when Charles Laughton heard about this marriage, he was very angry and furious with Maureen O'Hara, because he had signed her to a contract and did not want any negative publicity scandal about this marriage business being found out, but in later years because Maureen O'Hara had no more contact with Harry Brown, the marriage was annulled. As I informed you earlier that Daphne Du Maurier was really upset and disappointed with the film portrayal compared to her novel 'Jamaica Inn' as she felt the pirates were not violent and murderess thugs enough and was equally upset with Alfred Hitchcock on directing JAMAICA INN,' and was very reluctant to have him direct the film 'Rebeca,' but on seeing the film 'Rebeca' Daphne felt that Hitchcock had stayed much more true towards the novel 'Rebeca.' Jeremy Arnold also informs us that JAMAICA INN' did actually do very well at the box office and got  mostly positive reviews, but in England the critics were very scathing that Alfred Hitchcock was moving to America, but for a film that is so maligned today, Jeremy Arnold went back to read the critics reviews again and concluded that they ranged from fair to very strong reviews and mentions the Variety critic review in 1939, and gave it great praise, but the New York Times in 1939 thought it was more a Charles Laughton film, that an Alfred Hitchcock film. And so we finally come to the end of the film and Jeremy Arnold gives his final conclusion in saying that with someone like Alfred Hitchcock, a minor film that is good, but not sensational, often gets lost and now hopes JAMAICA INN' will get rescued from fate, and it demonstrates a level of craft, that shows Alfred Hitchcock to be ready for America and the machinery of Hollywood and 'Rebeca' will prove it and Jeremy Arnold thanks us for listening to his audio commentary and hopes you have enjoyed the experience of viewing this film like he did and bids you farewell. Well I for one second that opinion of Jeremy Arnold's impression of 'Jamaica Inn' and I can categorically say that Jeremy Arnold does such a professional audio commentary and definitely get a 5 star rating from me and is a must view experience, as Jeremy Arnold is so informative about the film JAMAICA INN.'

Nathalie Morriss research interests include Stoll Studios, the careers of Alfred Hitchcock, Powell and Pressburger and the promotion and marketing of Ealing Film Studios, British Womens Cinema and Sherlock Holmes adaptations.

Finally, press material touts JAMAICA INN is a ""rediscovered classic,"" which I totally agree with, especially after seeing this brand new brilliant 4K restoration presentation, which gives you a whole new perspective of this Black-and-White film. One of the least well known and forgotten Alfred Hitchcock's classic films, and there are massive amounts of elements to enjoy here. Again with this brilliant 4K restoration that is a real stunning marvel, however, anyone who has seen previous shoddy inferior DVD home video releases of JAMAICA INN will probably be totally amazed and staggered at the 100% stunning video image results. As it was Alfred Hitchcock's (temporary) swan song to England and JAMAICA INN is bittersweet at best, but Alfred Hitchcock aficionados will no doubt be thrilled to include this Blu-ray outing in their collections and has now gone pride of place in my ever increasing Alfred Hitchcock Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

4065641,4,B0033URY0S,"A new Alfred Hitchcock film on Blu-ray should be a cause for celebration for fans of one of cinema's greatest directors and that is certainly the case with Cohen Film Group's new Blu-ray of Hitchcock's last British film ""Jamaica Inn""(1939). Coming right after ""The Lady Vanishes""(1938) and right before ""Rebecca""(1940) this Daphne Du Maurier story of smugglers and shipwreakers off the coast of Cornwall in 19th Century England has been lovely restored by Cohen and the BFI(British Film Institute) and the results are simply amazing. Re-mastered in 4K from the original nitrate negative after an extensive frame by frame restoration, ""Jamaica Inn"" is a wonder to behold on Blu-ray(Bitrate 34.06) and far surpasses the standard(and terrible) DVD versions of the film. Despite it's uneven screenplay and interference from star Charles Laughton during filming(Laughton was the producer of the film), Hitchcock manages to put together a exciting and sinister story due in no small part by his excellent production crew. With the film taking place almost entirely at night, longtime Hitchcock cinematographer Harry Stradling gets some incredible images with shadows and lighting being especially prominent now on Blu-ray. Blacks, whites and grays are balanced throughout with a very stable image. Costumes, props, and set designs are very detailed. There are no vertical lines, dirt, torn or faded frames and ""Jamaica Inn"" probably hasn't looked this good since it's original theatrical run back in 1939. Although Hitchcock had trouble with Laughton during the production(he insisted on multiple takes) the acclaimed actor does give one of his classic performances, although he tends to overact a lot. Hitchcock does better with the supporting cast with Maureen O'Hara giving an excellent account of herself in one of her first films. Viewers will be stunned by her beauty now that the film is finally on Blu-ray. Robert Newton and Emlyn Williams are equally excellent in their respective roles. The Audio(LPCM 2.0 mono) has been extensively cleaned up too and there are no noise artifacts(hiss, pops, crackles, etc.) but is a bit on the loud side. However, dialogue is clear and understandable. ""Jamaica Inn"" is 99 minutes(Aspect Ratio: 1.37:1) and contains no subtitles. Special features include a video essay by Hitchcock biographer Donald Spoto and a feature length audio commentary. The Blu-ray itself is housed in a solid clear Blu-ray case(like Criterion) and includes a booklet with cast and credits for the film. ""Jamaica Inn"" might not rank very high on a list of great Alfred Hitchcock films but it certainly deserves a second look and fans of the director might want to consider adding it to their film collection now that it has been released on Blu-ray. Hopefully we'll see more Hitchcock on Blu-ray in the future. Until then, ""Jamaica Inn"" is certainly recommended.",1432166400,19,2875,5.279475982532751

Excellent performances by Charles Laughton and Maureen O'Hara. My only quibble is that the sound quality, though light years ahead of any previously existing public domain release of this film, is still muffled in spots.  I suspect the flaw was in the original recording of the dialog.  I had to play with my audio system to get an acceptable sound.  What would have made up for the sound would have been inclusion of sub-titles.  Sadly there are none, which is why I give it 4 instead of 5 stars.",1431561600,37,615,4.657407407407407

4065646,1,B0033URY0S,"""Jamaica Inn"" is a fine, if unusually traditional, film by Alfred Hitchcock.  The inimitable Charles Laughton plays a wonderfully sly and venal nobleman.  He is assisted by great performances by Maureen O'Hara and the hugely underrated Robert Newton.  Others of the cast also turn in good performances.  There is a copy of this great 1939 film in a collection of period and modern pirate films, available on Amazon.

OK, so why only 1 star?  Well, ""Jamaica Inn"" was filmed in a visual aspect of 1.33:1, as were 1939 films.  This shady outfit offers you a version that's 16:9.  Now, how do you suppose they did that?  There's 2 ways and either one is a mutilation of the original film.

First, you can cut off the top and bottom of each frame.  This is the way many ""widescreen"" films were made immediately after 1953.  Converting to 16:9 will lose about 1/3 of the image.  You want to pay full price for only 2/3 of the film?

Second, you can expand the image to the widescreen aspect.  This means everyone and everything is bloated.  Try it yourself:  while watching anything that's 1.33:1, use your controller to convert the screen to the wide aspect.  If you like what you see -- say, Humphry Bogart looking like Sidney Greenstreet -- then maybe this travesty is for you -- assuming they didn't just chop it to pieces.

Please note they don't even bother to tell you how they do the deed.  They don't want you to find out how they butchered this film.  These people are not doing you a service.  They're trying to capitalize on the widespread and utterly stupid fear of black bars on the TV screen.  ""This picture has been modified to fit your screen.""  What a bunch of irrational hogwash.

4065648,2,B0033URY0S,"This film has 3 giants of the English film industry yet it is so poor you should avoid seeing it.

Charles Laughton (1899-1962) won the Oscar for Henry VIII (1933) and was nominated twice more for Mutiny on the Bounty (1935) and Witness for the Prosecution (1957). These 3 performances alone are among the top 25 performances ever captured on the big screen, but in addition he gave us such compelling characters as police inspector Javert in Le Miserables (1935), Quasimodo in The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939), Herod in Salome (1953), and Senator Cooley in Advise and Consent (1962). This film, however, is probably his worst film of all, and stories from director Hitchcock confirm this.

Laughton liked Maureen OHara (1920-2015) and decided to give her a break in this film, which he co-produced. He took her with him to Hollywood and put her in Hunchback of Notre Dame and the rest is history. She could play comedy (Miracle on 34th Street in 1947), or action (Bagdad in 1949) and is maybe best known for her 5 films with John Wayne - Rio Grande (1950), The Quiet Man (1952), Big Jake (1971), McClintock (1963), and Wings of Eagles (1957).

Director Alfred Hitchcock (1899-1980) was at his peak during his English period, coming off The Man who Knew Too much (1934), The 39 Steps (1935), Secret Agent (1936), and The Lady Vanishes (1938). This film was the last one he made before moving to the US and beginning an even more distinguished career.

How could it then be so bad, making the list of The 50 Worst Films of All Time? For one reason, Laughton and Hitchcock clashed, and Hitchcock later said he referred rather than directed. Its one of the few films Hitch doesnt even appear in.

For another, Laughton was beset with financial problems, and his production company was on the verge of bankruptcy.

Regardless, unless you are a diehard fan of any of these 3 (and who isnt) there really is nothing worthwhile to see here. Of course OHara is beautiful, but the rest of the film fails to work.",1450051200,,2004,4.662889518413598
4065649,5,B0033URY0S,"5 stars for entertainment value if watched on Amazon streaming and for Maureen O'Hara's beauty. 4 stars for this release if bought on dvd or blu-ray. Why? The streaming version offers closed captions, the hardcopies do not. Why and how is this?
Though an atypical Hitchcock offering, Jamaica Inn is as much fun to watch as his other more well known British films. Rarely heralded and previously only available in scratchy public domain versions, this Cohen version is finally given its due with a spectacular visual restoration. The print is pristine with a clean soundtrack. As a few others have mentioned it's a shame that subtitles are not included, especially to hear much of Laughton's mumbled delivery. Still, the film is the thing.
Reports of difficulty with Charles Laughton during its production do not show, he delivers a memorable morally challenged lord of the manor, an upper class man gone wild with an entitled appetite for the finer things. The foppish Henry Pengallen is among Laughton's great character portrayals.
Hitchcock's style had conflicting tendencies, veering from ""pure cinema"" montage in some films and simply filming stage pieces in others. This one tends towards the latter; much of it takes place in the interior of the Inn and at Pengallen's estate. Though not suspenseful in his typical montage way, the feeling of menace underlying the charm of the sociopathic Pengallen is pure Hitchcock. The sense of physical and sexual danger from the band of cutthroats, often humorous, against O'Hara's vulnerability, beauty, and innocence is palpable and a perfect touch.",1444953600,,1596,5.189922480620155

8388085,4,B0033URY0S,"Jamaica Inn released in the early spring of 1939, was the last UK made film by Hitchcock who left for Hollywood right after WW II broke out.  The film is named after the country inn where at least half of the film takes place.  The film was shot in the English county of Cornwall (south-western most part of England) a region characteristic for its rocky surface interluded with pastures. The film features Charles Laughton (the guy who directed the cult film The Night of the Hunter (1955).  Laughton was no doubt a very talented actor/performer/director. He was an artist in a true sense of that word.  His acting is the highlight of the film...his facial expressions, mannerism, the way he walks and moves, talks, and his relationship towards his butler by the name of Chadwick is full dark-humor,

Synopsis: The film is about a group of cut-throat pirates who live of wrecking ships and robbing them of their possession.  Their group leader is a inn keeper who together with his wife runs the nearby Jamaica Inn.  The inn also serves as the group's meeting place.  One day, a young orphaned girl comes to visit her aunt (the wife of the inn keeper), and she witnesses a hanging of one of the wreckers...",1452297600,,1207,4.660377358490566
