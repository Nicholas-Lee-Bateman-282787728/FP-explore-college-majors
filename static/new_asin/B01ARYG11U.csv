Which should tell you a little about the director's talent. The story is simplistic and pointless. They use film, everything is lighted well, the sound is good and a couple of the actors would not real bad.",1473724800,,344,4.390625
7610281,1,B01ARYG11U,"I thought that maybe the recent reviews were incorrect...  Nope.

I would say this movie is bad but I don't want to tarnish the word 'movie'.  This waste of time is badly acted, directed, produced, cast, costumed, animated and written, and that is the fault of Tiziano Cella who filled all of those roles in this steaming pile of doo.  The only good thing to come out of this is that you can probably make some sort of drinking game out of taking a shot every time his name shows up in the credits, except that most people would likely die of alcohol poisoning by the end.

The initial reviews are almost 100% bogus and were spammed to give this an artificially high rating.  Sorry if you were suckered in as well.",1473552000,,714,4.371212121212121

No one's taste level is THAT bad. No. One. I'd rather brush my teeth with my own feces than watch even 10 seconds of this film again.

written to promote the movie. Most of these same reviews were written in a 2-day span, and the
reviewers had reviewed no other products...just this one movie. Amazon needs to do a better job at
policing this type of abuse. There is nothing worse than sitting down to watch what you think is going
to be a highly rated (and thus good) movie only to find out not only is the movie really, really bad,
but when you go back and read the actual reviews you find them to be ""suspicious"" and obviously fake.
Just my opinion. Avoid like the plague.",1472428800,2,643,4.366666666666666

With a 4+ star rating I expect decent acting, some plot, etc.  However, the 5 star reviews were clearly left by someone connected with this film instead people who actually enjoyed watching it.

7610307,1,B01ARYG11U,"Another independent film with spurious ratings.  As one reviewer pointed out: 54 five-star reviews in a span of two days.  And if you look at those five-star reviewers, this film is the only product review theyve made.  Clearly disingenuous.

An automatic 'one-star' to these filmmakers, if only to normalize the ginned-up stats on this miasma of a movie.  Amateur acting, glacial pacing, clumsy dialog, and many other questionable filmmaking choices throughout.  They clearly have the resources and the drive to complete a feature film...I only wish they had spent less effort generating bogus reviews, and more effort in pre-production trying to craft a coherent, compelling story.",1468540800,23,683,5.39622641509434
7610308,1,B01ARYG11U,"54 of the 60 reviews were written in a two day span (likely single day span, given a different timezone), many are two or three words, and all but one are misleading.
I was skeptical when I saw this had a solid 5 stars and 60 reviews. Turns out I should have listened to my instincts.
The soundtrack is horrifying. And by that, I mean a tense piece more fit for an espionage scene was used in a short scene of a man going out into the junkyard to copy VINs down. Every use of music is terribly out of place, and thus far the music itself is pretty forgettable, save for the fur Elise ring tone.
The entire opening is a poorly animated storyboard. It does not feel like it was done for artistic reasons, it feels like it was done to skip many days of shooting or many thousands of dollars to pay an actual artist to do something worthwhile.
The acting is extremely stilted and unnatural. To cite the first truly unbearable scene, look about 9 minutes in. It is so bad that better direction (ie, not cutting back and forth between the actor and actress for monosyllabic dialog) would have actually made it worse.
As mentioned before, the direction consists mostly of cutting rapidly back and forth between face shots of the cast as they talk. At one point, someone even crouches down for no discernible reason except to leave the frame. The kiss scenes look like the couples are dead fish trying to eat each other's faces. As a bonus, you get to watch some random guy attempt to make a pizza.
The story itself nonsensical and trite at the same time; a poor reinterpretation of the Manchurian Candidate scenario, in a head-on trainwreck with a Slasher film. There is nothing particularly thrilling, sexy, gory or surprising about this movie. I'd recommend looking at Martyrs instead.",1468540800,79,1780,4.548286604361371

Acting is absolutely monotonous and dreadful, audio seems out of place, and, well, I don't even want to continue thinking about it.

Foolish me, I kept watching waiting for the film to kick into gear hoping the reviews were true, but about an hour in I had to quit. I hope none of you have to endure this movie for that long.
