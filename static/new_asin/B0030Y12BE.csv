4047133,1,B0030Y12BE,"Have Gun Will Travel is one of the best westerns ever written. Often the mysterious Paladin who works just as well with a gun as he does with his brain, will solve problems not with violence, but with knowledge. I will always hold a special place in my heart for this wonderful series as it taught me so much in life. But, I will not give payment to a blood sucking corporation making millions of $$$ at the expense of the fans, by selling half seasons. I will buy this, but only used and when I can get it for around $6 a half season, making my total cost for the season no more than $12. Not because I am cheap, but simply because used DVD's are no more than that in value to me. New I would pay up to $20 for a full season.

The shows that make up this season are well written and stand up to the test of time. The show overall is well done. I believe that if the corporations were not so greedy they would make a lot more in sales which would more than make up for the money they are overcharging. There is a great episode in this season with Ben Johnson playing a white man who lived with the Sue for 10 years. He plays an alcoholic tracker who wants to take Paladin's scalp as Coo so that he might return to his tribe. Paladin of course hires him, and well I don't want to spoil it for anyone. It's a great episode though.

If you can get this at a reasonable price, I recommend it, if not. Wait, it will come down.

4047134,5,B0030Y12BE,"5 stars is for the show itself. What a great western series! And Richard Boone is awesome as Paladin. But I do agree with others that after the first 3 years were sold as complete seasons, it is a shame that we are now asked to pay big money for half a season at a time for upcoming seasons. I really want the series badly so I will pony up the money but this corporate greed needs to stop. - Fortunately HGWT has about 39 episodes per season so you will still get alot viewing pleasure even in half a season.",1261353600,5,509,4.0495049504950495
4047135,5,B0030Y12BE,"I understand the complaints of some of the other reviewers regarding season four, volume one of ""Have Gun Will Travel"". I hope there are those out there who likewise will understand me. I was told that season three of this show did NOT sell well, hence, the long delay waiting for season four. Other studios have split up seasons of TV shows in order for them to sell better and these should be at least a little cheaper than a full season set. I for one missed new releases being released of this show after season three was released. If season four volume one sells well, then we will soon have season four volume two. I have seen other first volumes of series sell well and then the second half follows soon after. I would like to have all six seasons and frankly, if this is the way for it to happen, I am glad at least the show is being released on DVD again. I for one plan to purchase it when it is available.",1261267200,11,916,4.2102272727272725
4047136,1,B0030Y12BE,"I own all three previous season (complete) releases. I loved this show as a kid when it was on TV. I have a personal policy that I will not purchase TV shows that have been sliced into multiple volumns because the studio(s) want their pound of flesh from consumers. This will be no different. While I would love to have the fourth season, I cannot justify paying full season prices for only half of a season. So, as far as I'm concerned Paramount might as well have kept this goodie in the vault and not bothered to release it. If I eventually see it cheaper (as in at least half the whole season price) I'll consider buying it. Until than, forget it.  Sorry Paramount!",1261267200,22,669,4.395161290322581

The video and audio is crisp and clear.  As such CBS Television spent a bit on improving the DVDs.  Sadly the excellent data on the cast in each episode that is contained in the ""Wire Paladin"" additions provided in the first three seasons is not included.  Younger viewers of this the 1960s viewing season will probably not care as the cast members are probably, by and large, no longer living.

4047212,5,B0030Y12BE,I grew up watching Gunsmoke reruns with my dad. Never watched this show until I caught some episodes on the western channel. Loved it immediately. Have watched every episode from the 6 seasons. I feel the first few seasons were the best but all are enjoyable. DVDs are of good quality. The negatives are they are too expensive and the division of each season is definitely a sign the networks are desperate and trying to squeeze every last penny they can before this media is obsolete. Get the first 3 seasons and you will have a ton of great shows to watch. Not your typical western. Richard Boone was a great actor and his laugh is infectious.,1393545600,,645,4.521367521367521

4047216,3,B0030Y12BE,"Still some top notch writing, but some of the stories are a bit odd, almost inexplicable.  I suppose they were experimenting with allegory to serve as social commentary, but it didn't always ring true, especially for the time period (1870s).  Boone and his ensemble of oft recurring guest stars, as always, give fine performances, and there is a lot of beautiful scenic location filming, which was most unusual for the time.  What a pity it wasn't shot in color.  Some of the stories needed more time for development than a half-hour format allows.

I can view very high quality versions of all these episodes online and even download them from a multitude of file sharing sites. While I prefer to encourage the studios to release more titles and invest in extras, etc., this is like a slap in the face (or more like a 1-finger salute). Don't encourage them. Stay away.

As I've written in the past, my one star reviews are generally for the half season releases at inflated prices...

Paramount's (and similar other companies) implied and prevailing attitude to or about the consumer is something of this order...

""Go ahead and complain, but as long as our cash register is ringing, we'll keep releasing half seasons at inflated prices. Much more profitable than releasing complete seasons at lower, competitive pricing."" ""Thanks for buying and making our day.""

My understanding is that Gunsmoke came to a halt because sales tanked. Consumers have said enough is enough.

Consumers have made it clear they prefer complete seasons and reasonable, competitive pricing.

Paramount (and others) could be raking it in big time if they followed the above simple formula.

It would seem their marketing people should be axed, due to incompetency.",1274140800,20,922,5.2312925170068025

Five stars! Five stars for what it is...

Five stars for the content. Five stars for the fine stories. Five stars for the clean, crisp pictures. Five stars for the clean, crisp sound. And five for the packaging.

Oh, and five stars to CBS/Paramount for producing this quality series on DVD.

If you paid out your hard-earned cash for the old Columbia House tapes, you'd be correct in your disdain for them--now there you're talkin' ""overpriced"" and ""rip-off.""

That CBS/Paramount is willing to give the show another shot is a positive thing, IMO. As someone who has actually purchased the product (unlike most of the whiners here), I can say that the remastering job is beautiful, a big improvement on the previous season. The blacks are rich, there is no grain or debris. This is typical of CBS/Paramount's restoration work on B&W series. The episodes are uncut and, most importantly for a CBS release, not a note of music has been tampered with. The presentation is far superior to my old CH tapes.

I did purchase the set, but it wasn't an automatic decision and I stalled on making the purchase for a few weeks to see if the price would be adjusted.  However, once I received the set I did notice that the picture quality appeared to be superior to the quality of the first 3 seasons that were released.  The picture and audio seem much crisper.  And as far as I can tell, CBS did not mess with the original music, as they unfortunately have done with such a classic TV series as ""The Fugitive"".  I was disappointed that they did not include the ""Wire Paladin"" feature that was a part of the first 3 seasons, which gave you background information on the episodes and the guest stars that appeared in a particular episode.  Overall, I'm glad that the show is being released again and I hope that if sales for this half season are not as spectacular as CBS hopes for, that they recognize their own role in possibly discouraging sales by the split season treatment.  However, the acting work of Richard Boone in this series, the excellent writing that dealt progressively with many social issues within the context of a Western still deserves to be seen and enjoyed by the public.

Ultimately, though, I feel I must agree with the other 1-star reviewers --  the series is 5-star, but greedy CBS and Paramount are beneath contempt for splitting the season in two and raising the price. I bought this on pre-order without noticing the ""Volume 1"" caption (and I'm pretty sure that it didn't appear in the description at that time). Still, I'll keep the DVD and buy Volume 2, but that's all at these high prices.",1268092800,10,572,4.447619047619048
4047287,4,B0030Y12BE,"We have a 40-inch television screen and as soon as I viewed the first disc of the fourth season it was immediately clear that CBS finally took the time to clean up the video.  Also, the audio sounds clearer and no longer varies in volume so much from show-to-show as it does in the previous seasons.  However, no extras and no captioning for the hearing impaired.  And this is a minor gripe, the discs no longer have pictures on them, only gray labels with print (I thought the pictures were a nice touch in seasons one through three).  It's good to know that the rest of season four, as well as season five and six will look and sound this good.  But, this means CBS needs to go back and clean up seasons 1-3 and re-release them (which they will no doubt do in separate expensive double volumes).  I give the show five stars.  Many of the episodes feature wonderful writing, terrific guest stars and I can't praise Richard Boone's performance enough.  This is not the definitive DVD set.  CBS hasn't gotten it right yet and from what I'm reading they are losing business by so clumsily managing this release of a series that deserves so much better.",1268006400,12,1150,4.490384615384615

4047299,5,B0030Y12BE,"After a couple years of hesitation, CBS has finally released HGWT Season Four. In my honest opinion, Season Four is the best season of the series. Hey Girl replaces Hey Boy (the actor departed for a career opportunity that ultimately failed) and there is chemistry between Paladin and Hey Girl. I think it should be noted that the radio program of the same name had Missy Wong before the TV version premiered Hey Girl and I suspect the radio program influenced the decision to replace Hey Boy with a female.

Some of the best episodes of the series appear in Season Four. I noticed that CBS also decided to release only half of the season. True, they will make more money splitting the season in half, rather than package the entire season in one box set as they did with the three prior seasons. It comes down to economics. The second and third season failed to meet the studio's expectations so this was a compromise. And God bless CBS for continuing the release of HGWT Season Four. Here's hope Season Five and and Season Six come out on DVD.

Oh, yes, I co-wrote the HAVE GUN-WILL TRAVEL COMPANION for OTR Publishing with Les Rayburn. It was a labor of love. Yes, the book is still available on Amazon.com. No, this is not a shameless pitch, but rather full disclosure of my credentials as a fan and authority on the TV and radio series. If R.G. Bright had not done a thorough job with his Season Four review, I would have done the same thing. So please accept my review as a second motion vote for encouraging people to buy the DVD set. And Radio Spirits has released the radio program commercially on CD. If you have never heard the radio program, I recommend you check it out.",1264809600,44,1683,4.478827361563518
4047300,5,B0030Y12BE,"Finally. Season four of ""Have Gun-Will Travel"" is coming after a four year wait. I agree with Sir Paw Paw. Let's not whine. I am glad these shows will be available and at least they will cost less for a half season rather than a full season. It shouldn't be too hard on the pocket book. Hopefully volume two will come out shortly afterwards.

This is a great western with morals and fine acting and often was very well written. Can't wait.",1262390400,9,439,4.353658536585366
4047301,5,B0030Y12BE,"For anyone not aware, Season Four of HAVE GUN-WILL TRAVEL was the second best season of the series (following the superb Second Season). Frank Pierson was the producer, having recently replaced Sam Rolfe, the creator of the TV western. Rolfe came to blows with Richard Boone and conflict behind the camera led to Rolfe leaving the series and quitting on CBS. Pierson got along VERY well with Boone, allowing the actor to take control of the series (including directing a few episodes). Season Three was mildly weak as a result of Boone's insistence that each episode be filmed in two days instead of three, so he and actor Martin Gabel could play the starring leads in Norman Corwin's THE RIVALRY on Broadway. The season's filming had to conclude early in order for them to appear on schedule. With Season Four, there was no rush-job and each episode was made with care. In fact, at Boone's pleasure, the series became a text book example of how an actor can explore the character he played and you see a number of different sides of Paladin. ""Love's Young Dream"" is a sequel to a third-season episode, with a pre-Festus Ken Curtis as Monk, applying his real singing voice before the camera. ""Out at the Old Ballpark"" is perhaps the silliest episode of the series, but the fourth season brings to life some of the best episodes of the series such as ""A Head of Hair,"" ""Saturday Night,"" ""The Poker Fiend,"" ""The Marshal's Boy"" (which dealt with mental illness, tricky subject matter for the time), the series' only two-part episode ""A Quiet Night in Town"" which explores a darker side of Paladin and introduces us to Sydney Pollack as an actor before he became a director, ""The Princess and the Gunfighter"" which was clearly a rip-off of ROMAN HOLIDAY, ""El Paso Stage"" (with a crooked Buddy Ebsen), and my personal favorite, ""Broken Image."" (Keep in mind that a couple of these episodes were in the latter half of the fourth season and will appear in volume 2.)

""The Shooting of Jessie May"" was the episode that brought William Talman back to Perry Mason. The actor was banned from the courtroom drama as a result of a drug charge, but after his appearance on this episode of HAVE GUN, CBS read the fan mail and reconsidered.

""The Long Way Home,"" which will probably appear in the second volume of this season, will have my interest. When Columbia House initially released the entire series on 56 VHS videos many years ago, that was the only episode that suffered damage to the original studio archival negative. The damage was during the closing credits but some speculate the closing credits had a mistake and for legal reasons the studio could not include the complete cast. So the closing credits was computerized and not the original closing credits as it aired on TV. My hope is that when this episode appears on DVD, CBS will go back to the original master and not the altered print. No one wants to see an altered version of the closing credits.

This fourth season is a welcome addition to my collection. If anyone wants to know how I know so much about the series, please consult THE HAVE GUN WILL TRAVEL COMPANION by Les Rayburn and Martin Grams. The book was not released by a major publishing house, course those companies have no interest in books like these. But it's not only a wealth of information, but gives behind-the-scenes stories and details for each episode. Sydney Pollack recalled how the scene where he smashes Boone's hand was done too real and the actor had to have his hand mended. Betsy-Jones Moreland recalled how she thought she was going to die as a result of the behind-the-scenes parties. Even the musicians recalled working on the series. Lots of stories and memories and recollections. The book is available on Amazon.com (that's where I got my copy) so I recommend you get both and enjoy the fourth season.",1262304000,85,3845,4.710252600297177
4047302,5,B0030Y12BE,I am so glad I did not listen to the whiners. I bought v1 of season 4 and it was worth every penny. I can hardly wait for the next volume. Have gun is a 5 star show that deserves 10. Nuff said.,1262217600,2,193,3.511627906976744
4047303,1,B0030Y12BE,"HGWT was a great series.  I own the first 3 seasons.  I'm passing on this & giving a 1 star rating because of Paramount's continuing practice of releasing partial season sets at full season prices.  That's twice the cost, twice the space the show takes up on my shelf and twice as often I have to change out the DVD's in my player.  Massive FAIL. I'll wait until vol. 1&2(if it ever arrives) are bundled into a $30.00 set.  If that never happens, so be it.  Or I'll get a bootleg or used copy somewhere.  F-Paramount & their corporate greed!  Enough is enough!",1261958400,5,560,4.368932038834951
4047304,5,B0030Y12BE,"Like the first reviewer, I've been waiting years for this, yet am angry and disgusted that the seasons are now being released in two parts to double the profits of the corporation. And CBS did not release the first three seasons with any bells and whistles -- no special features, not even English for the hard of hearing subtitles. The DVD transfers are also not remastered and far from pristine.

Yet I bought the first three seasons on DVD because I wanted to see the seasons in sequence. Then I sold them back as an Amazon seller (at a profit -- what a shrewd wheeler dealer I am -- ha!). Then I bought them again when Amazon had a price slashing sale.

I have all the Columbia House VHS tapes. There are four episodes a tape, but a random mix of seasons on each tape, totally out of sequence. Fifty-six tapes @ $19.99/tape (plus s/h and tax) purchased in 1999/2000. A lot of money, but worth every penny for the joy they gave me. And it was the only place you could get them at the time.

I guess I'll stick with the tapes till the next three seasons are all out for a while and Amazon sells them dirt cheap.

Have Gun Will Travel is one of the best westerns ever and Richard Boone as Paladin one of the greatest TV characters. May they NEVER do some lame movie ""re-imagining,"" as they're doing too often these days. There have been threats of John Travolta (ugh!) and the rapper Eminem (?!?) playing Paladin. His version was to be a modern day bounty hunter in the urban Wild, Wild Midwest of Detroit! Why even call that HGWT? Kids don't remember this show so they wouldn't be cashing in on any name recognition factor, and Marshall Mathers is to Paladin what Moe Howard of the 3 Stooges is to Cary Grant -- the complete antithesis.",1261958400,17,1738,4.371517027863777

8386228,4,B0030Y12BE,"I can confirm the video and audio improvements, mentioned by others, as well as the technical faults (like the lack of close-captioning) in this and the Season 4 companion set. It's a mixed bag of good and poor, and CBS owes its customers better for such a classic series.

By its fourth season (1960-61) ""HGWT"" was also something of a mixed bag. Lisa Lu, subbing for Kam Tong, as Paladin's assistant at the Hotel Carlton, is charming in the episodes in which she appears: she takes a nothing role and gives it a delightful blend of Old World respect and New World tease. The series' mainstay scriptwritersAlbert Aley, Harry Julian Fink, Shimon Wincelberg, Gene Roddenberry, and Bruce Gellerare all represented here. Guest stars from previous episodesa few in the same roles, most in different onesmake their bows. The series still took us on location, though the cut-backs to Paramount's soundstage interiors are painfully obvious. The most noticeable thing in the series' fourth season, which, unfortunately, would not improve in the remaining two years, is the unevenness of the scripts, some of which obviously went into production because they could be made on the cheap. After three years, with about 38 episodes a year (!), you run out of good stories fast. Thus, you must suffer through an unfunny haircut on Jules Verne (""Fogg Bound"") and the very offbeat ""Out at the Old Ball Park"" in order to watch some bona fide classics: ""A Head of Hair"" (which preserves the mystique of Native Americans), ""El Paso Stage"" (in which lovable Buddy Ebsen shinesor corrodesas one nasty S.O.B. who wears a badge), and the excellent two-parter, ""A Quiet Night in Town"" (in which Paladin gets into such serious trouble that it takes him two weeks to get out of itjust barely). Come rain or shine, Richard Boone continues to deliver the goods. You have the sense that, when handed a mediocre script, he and his fellow actors kicked things up a notch to try to give us a good 25 minutes of drama.",1509235200,,1985,4.821114369501466
