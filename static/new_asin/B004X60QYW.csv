8446072,2,B004X60QYW,"Wisconsin Project X (2011)

 In a small town an experiment goes haywire and a group of flesh eating humanoids runs amok.  A band of geeks, slackers and a hair dresser team up with a pair of cops to survive.  Good Zombie fun.  These ghouls can be dispatched with coffee, some kind of chemical reaction.
 Director Christian Ackerman claimed in the commentary for the film that he made this film with no budget, using things he found around the house and garage for props and make up.  He used his family members and his pals as the cast.  Ackerman himself wrote the sparse script and stared as well.  Chris Ackerman did the film editing.  Chris Ackerman produced.  He also served as special effects coordinator and provided the visual effects.  Wisconsin Project X is his film from start to finish.
 His wife Danielle Ackerman became his co-star.  Both Jack Kolberg and Timothy Kolberg have acting roles.  Timothy also provided the music.  Art director Thomas Robinson also did the special effects makeup.  In an innovation I hadn't come across before Robinson made Zombie masks of duct tape covered with regular stage make up to make the Zombies look more frightening.
 No money, no actual actors but Ackerman and his buddies had a load of imagination.  The direction and the film editing make this film actually watchable.
 Ackerman uses filters to wash out the film, making it dark, drab and scary with flashes of color here and there which I liked.  The Zombies look pretty silly all in all but the camera just rests upon them in the briefest of moments so we don't really register their actual looks beyond the fact that they scare us.  In fact, he uses images that explode upon our eye balls to generate a series of startle reflexes in us.  We do in fact jump in our seat from time to time.
 This film lasts only one hour and three minutes.  I can give it no more than two brains but given that the film had no budget that actually comes as a compliment.  It shows what can be done even if the main ingredient for the stew is imagination.
 In entertainment value this one rates will above its scant two brains and also well above many other Zombie flicks made by famous directors with studio budgets behind them.  The production values are dim and the actors unskilled but the directing and editing obscures much of that.  It seems like some of the grainy black and white films of the olden days in Hollywood.
 Ackerman has now directed six feature length films.  Coming up in 2015 is Zombies of the Living Dead.  He has come a fair way from his 1999 film Zombie Spoof which he reportedly made for $50. I wish him well.",1427068800,,2623,4.562231759656652

8446075,1,B004X60QYW,"This is an extreme low budget zombie style film. Zombie humanoids are accidentally created at a lab in a small western looking town in Wisconsin. The director didn't know where to go with this film. The movie gives us the worse of all possible worlds. It is both drive-in grainy and shot with a hand held camera at mostly a 40-45 degree angle. Why? Who knows because the effect was terrible. Coffee can kill these zombies, clearly an attempt at being a campy film, but the dialouge and rest of the film didn't match it. The zombies were a combination of foot dragging zombies and those with super human strength. The zombie special effect was created by wrapping duct tape around a guy's head and applying some make-up. Some body parts remain animated and apparently capable of thinking as in ""Evil Dead,"" but they are not possessed by spirits so they should just flop around. The movie claims to be 2011, but if you look at their phones, clearly this movie is at least 10 years old. Not entertaining even when stoned.

Out of respect for the careers of those who were in this film, I won't mention their name.

8446076,3,B004X60QYW,"OKAY, Who thought of filming in Sepiatone colors,Brilliant move for atmosphere.
There is more than enough scares for all types of viewers...Never could anticipate the next undead strike.
COFFEE as a weapon ? Come on,You're kicking yourself for not coming up with that premise.
Some moments remind you of John Carpenter ( Including some musical interludes) and his original PRECINCT 13 movie.
The bad was the title,We hate what this movie is called...Cannot fathom this movie being called that...Yuck...Ptuiiiii ....
Well,To sum up almost perfect endeavor with some great kills and acting and humor sparsely place.",1309305600,5,613,5.395833333333333
