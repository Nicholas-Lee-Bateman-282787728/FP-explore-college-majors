3730237,5,B001OI36RQ,"This film contained a lot of information regarding all of those involved with these murders.  Scott Michaels takes you step by step through the days of Aug 9th and 10th, going location to location.  It was interesting to see actual footage of each house, as well as places in and around Death Valley.  Micheals and his crew had an ""anniversary"" dinner at the El Coyote restaraunt on the night of Aug 8th which was tastefully done, and done in honor of the victims, not in celebration of the murders.  This film also made me aware of some facts that I have not heard before (hollywood connections, etc) that were interesting.  If you are interested in Manson and/or the Tate/LaBianca murders this video is a great buy.",1238544000,3,717,4.658730158730159

3730240,5,B001OI36RQ,"I wasn't entirely versed on the Charles Manson murders so this movie was, first of all, terrifyingly eye-opening for me. This is seriously one of the creepiest murders not only in Hollywood history but in American history, and the documentary retells the story in chilling detail with all the gruesome images to accompany it. Yes, the film is historically accurate and educational, but it is also surprisingly edge-of-your-seat and scary! If you're waiting for a calm moment to take that next bite of popcorn, you're going to be waiting a long time (like I was)! I watched this movie with friends for two different movie nights and everyone was successfully creeped out and impressed!! Buy this movie, you won't be disappointed!",1235260800,46,728,5.024793388429752
3730241,5,B001OI36RQ,"TO ALL AND ANY MANSON AND TRUE CRIME BUFFS, YOU SIMPLY CANNOT MISS THIS DVD.  I AM VERY FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO SAY, THAT I DID NOT GET MY COPY OF THE DVD THRU AMAZON.  I GOT MY COPY FROM SCOTT MICHEALS HIMSELF, WHEN I FLEW FROM BOSTON TO LOS ANGELES, TO TAKE A PRIVATE TOUR WITH THE MAN HIMSELF.  I SAW FIRST HAND,UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL EXACTLY WHAT IS ON THE VIDEO...SCOTT IS THE MOST INFORMATIVE AND ENTERTAINING SOURCE ON THE MANSON CASE IVE EVER MET, ONLY VINCENT BUGLIOSI COULD TOP SCOTT, AND EVEN THEN IT WOULD BE CLOSE.... BY ALL MEANS ORDER THIS DVD, BUT YOU MUST ALSO TAKE THE TOUR ITSELF IF YOU EVER FIND YOURSELF IN LA.",1234569600,4,626,4.2
3730242,5,B001OI36RQ,I think Scott Michaels is the absolute best at what he does. I am a daily viewer of his website 'find a death'. I have taken his hollywood tour and I loved this dvd. I thought that I knew alot about the Manson killings..I did not know even a fraction of what this dvd reveals. Scott takes you everywhere that you could possibly think of that was involved in these crimes. I highly recommend this dvd. I hope that Mr. Michaels produces more true crime documentaries.,1233619200,,465,4.4186046511627906
3730243,5,B001OI36RQ,"Veteran LA Tour Guide Scott Michaels has done it again with the release of his second documentary, The Six Degrees of Helter Skelter. In this 90 minute tour, Michaels takes you behind the scenes and inside the minds of the Manson Family as he explores the murders of August 1969 and visits the sites today, not only of the murder locations, but of every site associated with the victims, the killers, the friends and hangers-on. By the time he winds up at Barker Ranch out in Death Valley, the last spot on earth where Charles Manson was a free man, where the remnants of Tex Watson's car remain today, you will know you have seen the definitive Manson documentary, the likes of which have never been seen before.",1233446400,9,713,4.578125
3730244,5,B001OI36RQ,"The events of August 1969 were horrible beyond belief. With the passage of time, it is possible to forget the tragedy and the horror. For those who were born after the murders happened, it is possible to not even know about them and, therefore, not care. Scott Michaels obviously cares. He cares about the lives lost and about getting the facts straight. He presents the information about the murders from the actual locations where they occurred. This is an excellent history of the Tate/LaBianca murders.",1231804800,3,506,4.964705882352941
3730245,5,B001OI36RQ,"This DVD is excellent. A great deal of time and research has been put into the creation of it and to me it is one of the best at showing the viewer the world that surrounded The Manson Family as well as Sharon Tate and the other victims.

Scott Michaels films the locations where the horrific events of August 9th & 10th, 1969 took place.  He in informed and clearly has a passion for presenting the facts.  I look forward to buying other DVD's of his.",1231372800,11,452,4.232558139534884
3730246,5,B001OI36RQ,"This is the best current Helter Skelter documentary. Host Scott Michaels takes you step by step through the events of that fateful night and you get to see the actual locations where these events occured. If you live in California you can find some of these places on your own, but for those of us who don't, this is the next best thing to taking the actual tour.

There are little tid bits here and there that are interesting as well. In the 'extras' section we get to see the spot where there was the house that Squeaky Fromme grew up in, did you know she signed her name in the concrete? It is these little bits of info that make this a cut above the rest. We also get a trip through the house next to the Tate house, the owner believes it's haunted.

The main documentary is great at showing you these places and the things that you just don't get when looking at photographs. If this case is of interest to you this is a must have. The production quality of the DVD is very good- and the presentation is both entertaining and informative. An eerie scene is the host walking up Cielo Drive near midnight on the anniversary of the murders toward the gate at the former Tate residence. This is the stuff you don't see on A&E!

***UPDATE 12/2009*** - The review written above is for the original release (now out of print) of this documentary. The version available now is released through 'Echo Bridge Entertainment' and does not include the extras mentioned above. It is still the same documentary with an added mention about the fire that ripped through Barkers Ranch - but nothing on Squeaky Fromme's house - no extras.",1231200000,54,1624,4.461279461279461

3730263,5,B001OI36RQ,"First of all, you will watch this film with skepticism and finish up with an 'icky' feeling, but the research, information and details is astounding.  This is one of those all thought-provoking films.  Once you watch this film it will be all you think about for days.  Anything with Manson is truly thought-provoking, but not necessarily in a good way.  Serial killers do not give us a good feeling, even when we may think we understand their reason for doing what they do.  Ugly is ugly, no matter how we try to justify it.  But this writer/director did one heckuva job researching information about the Sharon Tate and La Bianca murders, and a lot of dots were connected through a great deal of effort on the filmmaker's behalf.  My only wish was to see more on Manson's personal profile, and his 'following'.  I like to see more on the psychological aspect of a killer, and a little less on the details as to the actual killing.  What did catch me off guard was seeing the actual bodies of the deceased.  In all the books I had previously read about Manson (and I've read nearly every one) they only show the police outlines of the bodies.  This is the first time I've actually seen the bodies, include Sharon Tate's.  Granted, this is sensationalism at it's best, and sadly that does little justice for the deceased as most of us that watch these films are intrigued by the killer's violence in what he did, and we all want to know what makes him tick, right?  But for the macabre that enjoy 'details' about the murders and where Manson and his 'family' lived and their thought processes about the murders, this is an excellent film that fills in a lot of the holes and is much more accurate than anything I've read in the past.  Though I did feel like I needed a shower after watching this film.  That doesn't negate the fact that it is well made, very well researched, and I'm certain I will watch this film many times over in the future.  Now, what does that say about me?",1434153600,5,1979,4.47075208913649

3730266,5,B001OI36RQ,"This movie is a must have for any manson-fanatics or hollywood tragedy lovers. Scott Michaels is passionate and a no-nonsense type of fellow, very credible. Side note-my husband and I went to LA for our honeymoon and went on the Tragical History Tour, Scott Michaels Hollywood tour, and he was in the storefront off Sunset. A gentleman and very polite, and took the time to talk to everyone who came for the tour and still had time to talk about artifacts he had in the store.

3730285,1,B001OI36RQ,"This video is mostly a waste  of money.  There is zero new information in this video and at first appears to be more of an advertisement for the narrator who is a Hollywood tour guide.  The video was only a few bucks but a waste of valuable time.  The only interesting and worthwhile part of the video is the last about one-fourth, where the narrator takes you to the Barker Ranch, out in the middle of nowhere in Death Valley where Manson sent his ""family"" when the heat got too heavy nearer to LA at the Spahn Ranch.  It is a desolate and rather inhabitable area and at least here the video became rather interesting to see what the day to day life of these poor lost souls must have been like.

Otherwise, look elsewhere for any real info on Manson and his dirty deeds.",1405296000,2,772,4.289655172413793
3730286,5,B001OI36RQ,"I personally loved this documentary.  The host really seems to have done his homework.  Its not your average documentary that glosses over the highlights and tells you things you already know.  I especially enjoyed the minute details and intricate connections made between different people, places, and events.  It gets a little creepy at times, but hey it's about the Manson family.  I have watched it at least 3 times just to absorb all the facts.",1403827200,2,449,4.933333333333334
3730287,5,B001OI36RQ,"Scott Michaels and Mike Dorsey do an excellent job on this subject.  You actually get a chill watching the evidence photos and the actual places that these horrible people committed these terrible crimes.  Also check out the DVD called ""Dearly Departed Vol. 1"" that these guys did.",1403481600,,281,4.957446808510638
3730288,1,B001OI36RQ,"Humphft.....this guy Dorsey is a creep because he's a typical uber fan who pretends to know more than he actually does and who cares if he ""thinks"" he does anyway! My father in law was a young police officer at the Tate home on Cielo Drive that horrible day in August and told us more about the case than I already knew. This person doesn't know much except what he ripped off from other books and information from his ""witnesses"".
As a southern California native I was was 13 at the time of the murders, and wouldn't even think of conducting tours or any of this as we would call them ""kooks"". I was attending summer school in Venice and had to walk there every day and it was hot and uncomfortable when we all heard the reports of these sick crimes. All I thought was 'whomever did this was possessed by the devil' and we were all genuinely frightened. This guy doesn't speak well & thought he acted like a stalker. I wouldn't think of going up to the murder scenes on any day. He is obsessed like many others I've seen about other dead stars. My father in laws brother who used to belong to a biker gang, once hung out with Manson at a party one night and was offered his jug of wine. Luckily he said no and teased Manson with something to the effect of ""no thanks, I don't know where you've been"". So Cal natives are used to seeing famous people It's not unusual & I'm not impressed by sensationalism and see this as bothersome and lame. This film didn't teach me anything. Let the victims rest in peace, especially Sharon's baby boy and stop glorifying their killers. ""Charlie"" is rotting in jail with the rest of his ""family"" and taking up space and using the tax payer money.",1395014400,2,1682,4.3428571428571425

This creates a very watchable piece and immersive experience.

I also found it more frightening than Vince's book, which is also excellent, and quite frightening in it's own right. I guess the reason for that is that Scott takes us on a tour of the actual murder sites as well as places and landmarks the murderers visited both before and after. This is impossible for a bound book to do effectively and it brings the events of over 40 years ago to life.

I therefore can highly recommend this very well done documentary to anyone interested in impactive history and horror stories.",1391472000,,809,5.113636363636363
3730292,4,B001OI36RQ,"This DVD takes the viewer on a tour of the landmarks in the Manson case.  Hollywood historian Scott Michaels provides a chronology of the dates and events in the case while visiting the houses and locations.  His location commentaries stay to the facts and he never offers an opinion or an elaboration about where he is, or what happened there.  He lets the locations and the events tell their own story.

And it is quite a story.  As it unfolds we are given glimpses into Manson's desire to be a singer songwriter.  His pure chance meeting and relationship with Dennis Wilson. His drifting around from place to place in the Los Angeles area.  And finally to the last place Manson stayed at before his arrest and prosecution, the lonely and desolate Barker Ranch in Death Valley.  As you see the locations and listen to Michaels' narration you will get a feel for the true madness in Manson's mind.

With all of that said, this is a DVD for those with a real interest in the case.  It's a video for those who have heard the stories, read the books, and maybe watched a few youtube clips on the subject.  It's a video for those have a curiosity to see where these events occurred.  It's a video for those who want to put a tangibility to what they have only read about and could not conceive of otherwise.

This DVD helped me understand what happened.  I offer that I was 8 years old when these events happened.  It was during my first ever visit to California.  My desire to learn about the mind and how it functions is derived from theses events in August 1969.",1389139200,4,1562,4.447183098591549

I went into this film wondering, ""What on Earth am I going to learn about these murders that everyone doesn't already know?"", and I was pleasantly surprised.

3730301,2,B001OI36RQ,"I ordered this dvd based on the cheap price and outstanding 5 star reviews. I am beyond disappointed. The dvd is nothing more than a tour of L.A. and shows you places that you just don't care to see, like the Whiskey a go go where Manson supposedly got kicked out....okay, so? Who cares? And all you see is the guy standing outside talking about it. Also showws you places like where Jay Sebring worked (yawn), and where an apartment once stood where Manson supposedly shot someone. The entire dvd I'm waiting for the actual ""story"" to begin and it simply doesn't. Basically, I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 simply because if you know the story by heart and know just about everything there is to know about the Manson Family then you might find this semi interesting, but for anyone who is not very familiar with the story then you will absolutely be bored to death, annoyed and definitely left scratching your head saying ""what the f*** was that??"" ******** Also, if you're interested in ordering this dvd based on the supposed ""awesome reviews"" it got, then you should think again and read the other ""not so awesome"" reviews because I do believe they are 100% fake reviews either made by the guy who made the dvd or someone who hasn't seen it.

3730302,5,B001OI36RQ,"I have been interested in the ""Helter Skelter"" story since I first picked up the book back when I was 12 years old or so.  I remember reading that book cover to cover in about two weeks.  I have been fascinated ever since.  I really enjoyed The Six Degrees of Helter Skelter.  I didn't really learn anything new, but I did pick up on a few interesting tidbits here and there.  The main reason I enjoyed this video so much, is because of getting to view all the sites that played a role in the story of ""Helter Skelter"".  From the places the victims frequented, to the places the victims were murdered, to the places the murderers stayed (Spahn Ranch and Barker Ranch), and everything in between.  I would highly recommend The Six Degrees of Separation.  I didn't want it to end.  Scott Michaels is a great host, and extremely informative.  You also can't beat it for the price.

What I got instead was basically a Hollywood tour of sites loosely associated with the people involved, given by a man talking so fast that one might believe that he was trying to run an auction instead of narrating a film.

3730313,4,B001OI36RQ,"If you are really, REALLY interested in the Manson Murders, this documentary should be worth your time. ""True Crime"" afficionados, provided they know the basic story and more important details of the 1969 cult killing spree, may also find it worthwhile.

Be advised, however, that much of THE SIX DEGREES of HELTER SKELTER consists of ""Here's a brick from the original Tate/Polanski fireplace,"" ""Here's one of the supermarkets that were managed by Leno LaBianca,"" and so forth. Still, there are  many other details that are strangely fascinating: a tour of Cielo Drive as it appeared in 2007, the narrator's discovery of an old green pick-up which may very well have belonged to the ""Family"" out in the desert near the old Spahn movie ranch, and various other items. There is also examination of the autopsy reports and (be warned) graphic photos of the murder scenes.

While there is more focus on the victims than the murderers, the ""Family""'s music is played and their talent (or lack thereof) as musicians is discussed, along with the connections some of the Mansonites had with certain members of the Hollywood ""elite."" Although there is little or nothing in the way of interviews with the incarcerated killers, the police, prosecutors, or anyone else directly involved with the murders or their prosecution, that omission is not too glaring and somehow fits the everyperson quality of the film.

Despite a long fascination with the Manson murders, I often found myself groaning ""Okay, okay, OKAY--show me something interesting!"" Yet, the narration by Scott Michaels (creator of findadeath.com) does much to keep SIX DEGREES from degenerating into tabloid tripe. There is something about Michaels's friendly, informal style that makes even the duller parts of SIX DEGREES palatable. The Manson case is complex and heavily laced with misconceptions, and Michaels's narration, despite its frequent rambles, is objective and nonpartisan, sticking to known facts and qualifying speculation as such.

Anyone who's seriously studied/been interested in the Manson murders will probably not learn any new significant facts from this film. Nevertheless, its whole big picture provides a very unique, entertaining, and well-worth-it perspective.",1359763200,2,2240,5.37037037037037

3730322,4,B001OI36RQ,"This is a scene-of-the-crime tour expanded to include many additional homes and neighborhoods associated with both the perpetrators and the victims of the Manson Family murders. Scott Michaels recreates the bus tour he provides for tourists who come to the Los Angeles area wanting to see where it happened.

Michaels makes the point that many tour directors who drive visitors around celebrity homes and landmarks confabulate most of their tours in order to make it easy on themselves. They have Cary Grant, James Dean, and Marilyn Monroe, all having lived next-door to each other just to make short work of the tours. But Michaels has a sincere interest in all of LA's celebrity history, so you get the feeling that he can be trusted to take you to the real scenes.

At first I was disappointed at this DVD's approach. I had hoped for some psychological insights into how such a murderous mindset could develop. Contrary to the blurb on the DVD cover, this video doesn't offer much along those lines. But it has some interesting insights of its own to offer. I felt I got to see the geography and outlook of Los Angeles from a unique viewpoint.

Michaels takes you along some of the winding lanes in the hills overlooking Hollywood, past some of the posh estates that had been occupied by people who either were or who knew the Manson victims in 1969. Then, by contrast, he takes you to the razed site of Spahn Ranch where the Manson family first gathered its forces, and to the Baker Ranch where some of their members were finally arrested. You feel the literal desertion of these places.

Michaels also takes the viewer to some downtown and other LA locations - where the perpetrators and victims might have crossed paths in earlier months as they shopped, dined, and socialized. He includes a view of some other residences as far afield as London where members of various rock groups and others associated with the victims once lived. This all helps to demonstrate the ""Six Degrees"" mentioned in the DVD title - the chain of connection between Manson, with his song-writing/recording ambitions, and a host of other people in the recording/performing industry.  Scott plays a rare recording of an original song composed by Manson.

All-in-all, this DVD takes you onto the terrain and into the lifestyles of the rich and famous in a way that you probably wouldn't otherwise get to see, even on the best tours of LA. Many of the locales have an eerily classic, farther-back 1940's Hollywood noir quality to them - with the contrast between the beauty of the classic LA houses and the unimaginable ugliness that took place inside some of them",1346371200,2,2643,4.797802197802198
3730323,5,B001OI36RQ,"I recently have become more interested in the Tate/La Bianca murders.  I read the book, Helter Skelter, saw the movie and now got a hold of this documentary that had me glued to my seat.  I first remember the murders in 1969 when I was nine years old and my parents wanted to hide that kind of news from me, but I was always intrigued by Manson, the man, the cult or aura about him and his motives. After all these years I finally understand all the insanity and senselessness of it all. And what a story it is.  The book is the best for information and it can't be put down.  The movie is quite boring and ""clinical"".  But The Six Degrees of Helter Skelter gives you a coherent, down to earth visual of the people and places where it all happened.  Ive been to L.A. several times in my younger years and drove around looking for famous people and places and have been near almost all the places of this story without knowing it, so it gets a little creepy thinking about it all. What a fascinating video.  A must have for anyone interested in this story.

So sad that those victims were at that residence that nite. Sharon was only there due to the fact a doctor wasn't available to give her the ok to fly with polanski to Europe. polanski was due home and was going to ask frykowski and folger to leave, sharon was tired of all the partying. sebring was there  giving sharon comfort, with her baby due soon. an overall tragedy.",1337731200,,1278,4.756756756756757
3730325,4,B001OI36RQ,"Few crimes have permanently entered the American psyche as the Tate/La Bianca murders that terrified Los Angeles in August 1969. On two nights, 7 people were brutally murdered by members of the Charles Manson family. Most of us know the story but Scott Michaels takes us deeper into the background with a fascinating tour of places relating to the Tate/La Bianca murder victims and the Manson family.
Although this is a simple and modest production, the documentary is well-done and informative. Michaels runs the Dearly Departed Tours in Los Angeles and is well versed in the darker side of Hollywood history. He takes us to many sites that most of us have never seen before. There is a brief interview with the man who bought the Jay Sebring house from his grieving parents. The interview have been longer with more scenes of this architecturally-unusual home.
Michaels takes us to homes inhabited by the victims at some point along with businesses run by the victims. The businesses have changed and some buildings are gone but history lives in the locations. One of the eery parts of the documentary is the actual recordings song by the Mansion families along with explanations of Charles Manson's connection to the Beach Boys and Doris Days music producer son Terry Melcher.
Michaels has no hestitation to sneak into locations that are off-limits to the public such as the road leading to the Tate home.
This dvd was incredibly inexpensive and it was well worth the cost to get some deeper insight into a crazy time. Although it is low budget, it is a well-done documentary and worth the time for anyone interested in this tragic series of events.",1335398400,4,1652,4.861702127659575
3730326,5,B001OI36RQ,"Brilliant. The narrator takes us to all the locations associated with the Tate -- La Bianca murders. Those of us who have read Bugliosi's HELTER SKELTER many times can finally see Gary Hinman's house, the rear view of the Cielo Drive house as it overlooks the canyon where people heard the gunshots and the screams. Patty Duke's house, where Polanski and Tate lived before they moved to Cielo Drive. The Weiss house where the gun was thrown and a comedy of errors ensued, the police identifying the weapon many months later.

Pictures of all the people we've heard about, Dennis Wilson, Terry Melcher, are shown. Everything in the Bugliosi book becomes visible. The Spahn Ranch before and after it burned down, the boulder in which the Manson girls were photographed. Barker Ranch.

The gas station where Linda Kasabian hid the wallet is shown, along with the Denny's next door where the killers had milkshakes.

An abandoned truck registered to Bobby Beausoleil's wife. Charles Watson's abandoned truck in Death Valley, with ""Helter Skelter"" painted on it.

Most eerily, Manson singing one of his own compositions on a demo disc.

A coroner describes the wounds and the causes of death, and grisly pictures of the victims are seen.

Everything is here except the trial. For the trial, read the Bugliosi book, which is entirely devoted to the effort to convict Manson as the guru who ordered the killings without being personally present. Presenting ""Helter Skelter"" as a motive was supremely difficult, but Bugliosi convicted Manson and his minions.",1334188800,2,1550,5.03515625

I love that Mr. Michaels travels to various locations connected with the infamous Charles Manson murders of 1969.

3730328,5,B001OI36RQ,"Watched this today and was completely riveted. Also this film made me want to visit California for the history there is dense and mythic. The documentary works on various levels. What really grabbed me was seeing the actual houses of the victims, and also the Spahn Ranch where Manson & his following shacked up. More disconcerting are the actual crime scene color photos showing the victims (which also have been on the Internet for a while now). Some myths are set straight too. No, Sharon Tate's baby was not cut out of her womb, and the evidence is right here. What a cast of characters in addition to the freak show we already knew about: Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys, Terry Melcher, Doris Day's son, Robert Evans, head of Paramount, Jack Nicholson, Warren Beatty (friends of Sharon Tate's husband Roman Polanski) and the Beatles re song ""Helter Skelter."" Also musician Trent Reznor lived in hair stylist and Manson victim Jay Sebring's house (scene of the Tate murder - I think), so you see interior of that house as well. While moving out, Trent helped himself to the front door which infamously had the word PIG painted in blood on it courtesy of Susan Atkins.  The house has now been demolished but it's surprising what has remained - like Tex Watson's truck still sitting in a very remote area.

Interesting fact revealed: the killers left watermelon rinds in the sink at one crime scene so investigators would deduct black people were behind the murders.  At the core of Manson's philosophy was his belief that a race war was coming, and he was a true racist. Also, a man whom Manson thought he had murdered, but actually survived, showed up at the trial to testify, and Mansion upon seeing him in the courthouse corridor shrugged and offered ""No hard feelings."" And did you know the Mansion clan moved in w/ Beach Boy Dennis Wilson and raided his house of gold records and other valuables? To even the score somewhat, the Beach Boys went on to record a Mansion song w/o paying any compensation to Charlie. Also, story about Charles Mansion getting thrown of rock club the Whiskey A-Go-Go for insulting a waitress. Oh, and the house band for the club? None other than The Doors! I mean, could it get any crazier or more fascinating?

Kudos to narrator and Hollywood historian, Scott Michaels. He explains everything relating to this devastating chapter in American history and is totally engaging & down to earth in a refreshing way. If there was a degree offered on the topic, I'd want this man to be my professor!

All the players here are interesting, and, over 40 years later, the shock of what went down on August 9th and 10th, 1969 never fails to grab you by the jugular. Disclaimer: while most of footage herein involves location shots and interiors, the grisly crime photos might cause distress to the faint of heart. No discussion of these murders would be complete w/o including mention  of the required text ""Helter Skelter"" (which was misspelled by Manson crew as ""Healter"") written by Vincent Bugliosi, the prosecutor who tried the case against Mansion et al.

One of my favorite styles of documentary is when the filmmaker places himself on the journey of sorting through the evidence and information.  Scott is a terrific navigator -- funny, light, and unique.  I think of him as a historian of American/Hollywood folklore and history.  This film offers interesting tidbits of the major players and sites, and the viewer benefits from Scott's prodigious reading and research.

What I think is most important with this film is that Scott successfully argues that the Manson story is a significant event in our national history that has impacted law enforcement, language, art, and culture.  This isn't just a sordid case of Hollywood murder that should be confined to gossip columns or the E True Hollywood Story.  Scott says that this case is a part of our history and relevant Manson sites should be preserved and studied.

Instead, the film spends the first 10 or so minutes with the narrator who owns some sort of strange ""graveyard"" tour company. He spends time showing off his collection of death related bric-a-brac from pieces of tile to sinks. It's most uninteresting.

From the there the film becomes one long and boring tour of sites tangentially related to the murders. He sits outside the home of Jay Sebring with the current owner and ends up swapping ghost stories. Then we hear all about Sebring's career and see his salon and a list of his clients! After that it's just a long series of exterior shots of buildings and utterly banal recitations of Hollywood trivia.

The only real highlight was when he did briefly touch on Manson's relationship with Wilson and actually played a recording of a song written by Charles Manson that the Beach Boys, supposedly re-worked for an album.

Later, as many of these ghoulish amateur profiteers are won't to do he spends a good deal of time pumping himself up and namedropping. He then wanders around the ranch where Manson lived with a metal detector picking up pieces of trash to cart off for his collection.

Honestly, it was quite boring and seemed to be more the work of a couple amateurs with some money. Obviously, this was not meant to be a really serious documentary and expansion of any material about the Manson Family and the Tate/Labianca Murders, but rather a long commercial for this man's tour company.

The tour itself might be great, but as a documentary it's really quite a waste of time for anyone seriously interested in this case and particularly in how such an insane monster could drift in and out of Hollywood society.",1260316800,10,1856,4.766355140186916
3730355,1,B001OI36RQ,"As someone who has always found the Manson case quite fascinating, and based on all the positive reviews, I bought this documentary, expecting something really profound.  What a waste of time!  This video told me nothing that I didn't already know about the case, was really boring for the most part, and wasted my time.

The narrator runs a Hollywood-based tour service that apparently specializes in celebrity homes and graves, as well as high-profile crime scenes.  Frankly, based on this video, I think his tours are probably a really great time.  The problem is that this video consists of not much more than a video version of a tour of sites related to the Manson family and the Tate/La Bianca murders.

Seriously, I'm not interested in seeing the garage where the Manson family got their dune buggies modified and repaired (""it's still there after all these years!""), the former bicycle shop where Abigail Folger ordered a Schwinn shortly before her death, or the mexican restaurant where the Tate victims ate their final meal.  I'm definitely not at all interested in an interview with the current owner of Jay Sebring's house, and a late-night walk up the lane to the former site of the Tate/Polanski home holds no interest at all.  I also don't care at all about the narrator's personal collection of celebrity memorabilia (a piece of tile from Jayne Mansfield's pool?  Really?).

If these sights are of interest to you, go ahead and buy.  If not, you might find the visit to the Barker ranch moderately interesting, but for me, it's definitely not worth the price of the video.",1257033600,17,1589,4.848148148148148

3730357,4,B001OI36RQ,"So many Manson documentaries have given the viewing public such scant information over the years,that the mythical urban legend has completely replaced any shred a truth left. This documentary hits upon some interesting connections not widely known,and unfortunately reinforces some of the false fables of Helter Skelter. I don't believe in opening wounds ,just to pour salt into. Yet,there needs to be a clear record of what went on. This documentary shows all the places the 'Family' traveled to,and giving some interesting stories about the various sites and people. Halfway through,the narrator points out that Roman Polansky believed that rock legends John Phillips and Mama Cass Elliot were behind the Helter Skelter murders. Vrytek Frykovsky recieved some fifty-one stab wounds,while others received only a dozen or two stab wounds. It seems Vrytek was the main intended victim,over a disputed drug-deal. Roman Polansky obtained Cass Elliot's little list of connections,and found names crossed out with the words 'PIG' written in. The same word was smeared across the blood bespeckled frontdoor. Something strange went on during those hot August days of 1969. The video provides the best visual documentary of the various crime scenes and places of interest. I think the one main thing I got out of watching this travel documentary,was that Manson was already 'Dead Man Walking'.Charlie didn't want to be released into public society again. Charlie was a mark man,by well-connected prisoners who knew how to manipulate the system,inside and outside the walls. The Helter-Skelter plot was just a way for the real players to blame a Hollywood newby ,like Manson,if their drug-schemes every fell apart. And indeed it did. Manson frustrated at his artistic failures,relished the sub-lime light,and his new found notority. All the places,left standing,that the Mansons stumbled into,are shown. Many places ,long time gone,are not discussed. The 'Yellow Submarine' house,Cole street,Henry Haight/Ashbury,and Ralph's Market are just a few of the places skipped over. This is perhaps the best visual roadmap around yet,from the devil-may-care dune-buggy days til the final fortnight of Helter Skelter.",1255651200,3,2200,5.531157270029674

He talks about as fast as the guy on the old Micro Machines commercials, but he fits a lot of info into this 105 minute ""tour guide"" style documentary.  The most riveting part for me was when he visits the former Manson family hideout in Death Valley.  The place has since burned to the ground so this is probably the final glimpse you'll get of that location.  I highly recommend this to those interested in this case.",1254873600,4,522,4.51063829787234

3730362,5,B001OI36RQ,"Scott Michaels clearly loves what he does, and it shows.  We get a personal tour of the germane points of interest in the Manson case: Spahn ranch (now demolished), Barker Ranch (in a state of decay), the LaBianca home (just the outside), the site of the Tate house on Cielo Drive, which now has an absolutely hideous monstrosity sitting on it. (As an aside, I found out that Rudi Altobelli, the owner of the house on Cielo who leased it to Roman and Sharon, continued to live in the house for some 25 years after the murders. Don't know if I could have done that!) We also see the tangential houses: Where Mama Cass lived then, who knew 4 of the 5 Tate house victims; the house Gaby and Voytek were renting when Sharon and Roman asked them to come to Cielo and keep Sharon company; the apartment house the daughter of the LaBiancas was living in when her parents were murdered (also used as the exterior to Melrose Place, we learn). We see the exterior of Gary Himman's house, the Hall of Justice where the Manson trial was held, and the street corner outside where the Manson girls, heads shaved and foreheads X'd, sat and chanted for Manson's release.  There are also recordings of Manson and the Manson girls singing songs Manson wrote. We also see the exterior of Dennis Wilson's house that the Manson gang trashed while living there and the marina where Wilson drowned.  We also see a lot of the exterior of the house where Sebring lived at the time of his death (where Jean Harlow lived with Paul Bern, who died there and also where Sharon had her eerie premonition of death). Michaels interviews one of the owners, who bought the house from Sebing's parents in 1970 and has lived there ever since. Is the house haunted? Hear what the owner has to say.

There are coroner's reports and pictures of the Tate and LaBianca victims, a warning for the faint of heart.

The extras at the end of the DVD include a visit to the street Lynette Fromme grew up on, with her name written by her in 1960 on the concrete sidewalk; a house 4 doors down from Cielo which is supposedly haunted; a preview of Dearly Departed vol. 1, where Michaels covers RFK, Marilyn Monroe, and many others; plus a lot more.

This is just jam packed with into relevant to the case and also just random. It's a fascinating DVD tour and I hope Michaels does more of them.",1251417600,6,2343,4.462616822429907

I have read many other books and have other documentaries of the murders, and after reading the glowing reviews of this DVD, I SOOO anticipated watching it.  Afterwards, I am greatly disappointed.  I didn't learn anything new from the DVD.  Actually, this is nothing more than a Hollywood tour guide--where we see the outside of a home or some other site, while the guide recites verbatim information from the book 'Helter Skelter'.  And in regards to the sites we see, I find little interest in seeing where Jay Sebring and Sharon Tate lived while dating, or where Frykowski and Folger lived prior to moving to Cielo Drive, or the school Steven Parent attended, etc.

It was very interesting to see the places where events connected to the case took place and that are mentioned many times in ""Helter Skelter"" and other books and movies relating to this case.  Mr. Michaels is an excellent host in this documentary.  Having said all of this, I also have to admit my disappointment with the last few minutes of the dvd, i.e., when Mr. Michaels goes to one of his friend's houses that is supposedly located close to where the Tate house once stood at 10050 Cielo Drive.  Where did Mr. Michaels come up with this Nimrod?  He claimed that he believes that the spirits of Sharon, Jay, and the other victims at the Tate house are present in his house......all because of some electronic monitor he was using that registered some kind of vibes when it turned it on and wielded it around the room.

8330604,4,B001OI36RQ,"Released in 2009 and directed by Michael Dorsey, Six Degrees of Helter Skelter is a micro-budget documentary that examines the Manson family and the infamous Tate/LeBianca murders that shocked the world in August, 1969, bringing to end the idealism of the hippie movement. Host Scott Michaels visits more than 40 locations in Southern California as he goes into detail about the victims, their murderers and Mansons ties to the Hollywood elite.

Charles Manson was a decent singer/songwriter and the documentary includes (a snippet of) one of his songs, Cease to Exist, performed by the Manson family. Although he wasn't anything phenomenal, Manson had a real shot at making it, but his narcissism, paranoia, and general malice toward everything destroyed it. He ruined everything he touched, everyTHING and everyONE. He wreaked havoc on dozens, no hundreds, of lives, probably thousands. And his psychopathic acts were the death knell of the good side of the counter-culture movement. Technically, a psychopath is not actually insane. These types simply have no conscience. Hurting & killing people, doing horrible things and wreaking havoc on society doesn't bother them in the least.

Costing only $200,000, this documentary is not a polished production. Its only a couple steps above a typical Youtube video and mostly consists of Michaels visiting the many locations and elaborating details in a freeform manner. He often throws in interesting side bits here and there. Some people criticize that he tends to ramble and sometimes stumbles over his words, but I understood everything he was saying perfectly and appreciated his casual, non-rehearsed, fact-oriented delivery. Micro-budget or not, the film is very informative and takes you to the actual locations of the infamous crimes, combined with a lot of stock footage of the people and events. For a documentary, it fulfills its purpose.

The film runs 103 minutes.
