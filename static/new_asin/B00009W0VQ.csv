1891743,5,B00009W0VQ,"i am not a fitness enthusiast, but my doctor told me to find something i could enjoy during pregnancy and then to do the same after i delivered, and i have thoroughly enjoyed Leisa Harts pregnancy videos. The Prenatal was excellent, and now the Postnatal has impressed me as well. I love the music and pace at whic she teaches, i am carrying extra weight and do not like feeling so heavy, but she makes me feel as though I can get my figure back and that is very motivating. I still don't love working, but who does! I do like doing this video and even like the FitMama & Me workout to alter things and give me a change of pace with my little boy. I really do appreciate the FITMAMA collection.",1064620800,,694,4.225563909774436
1891744,5,B00009W0VQ,"I love Leisa Hart's choreography and the Postnatal Fitmama and FitMama & Me videos are so great, they are just what my body needs to get back into shape....FitMama & Me baby workouts are  adorably fun, I can't believe the resistance my baby provided, he is heavier than i thought(at least 9 pounds is heavier than i thought). This was a blast and a great way to rediscover my body.",1062806400,,381,4.442857142857143
1891745,5,B00009W0VQ,"I loved the way my baby boy smiled and cooed and enjoyed working out with me during Leisa hart's FitMama & Me video. I have her other pre and post natal videos, and I strongly recommend those videos also. She was a godsend, I absolutely could not have felt this good without her and her videos, try these you'll like them.",1061164800,,322,4.295081967213115
1891746,5,B00009W0VQ,"this was a blast, my little baby was smiling and gigglin the entire time, we had a terrific time bonding while i was getting pretty sore with the great toning moves while holding onto my baby...Leisa was giving great tips on how to spend quality wxercise time with me and the baby and this was well worth, the babies on screen were adorable and Leisa's boy was so precious, i loved this , and would recommend it to anyone wanting a fun and intense toning workout all in one.",1058832000,,474,4.337078651685394
1891767,5,B00009W0VQ,i really like having some fun play time with my baby and this short video is a great alternative for me when i don't really feel that working out that hard or that much.,1076544000,,169,4.0
1891768,5,B00009W0VQ,"i am always short on time with three kids, especially with a new born, and i love doing a short five or ten minute workout with my baby as resistance, if it was much longer i think i couldn't carry my baby, my arms feels it the next day, that little bundle of love gets heavy after a while, so i am glad this is broken down into short segments....although on the video the babies are looking at the camera, i turn my baby and watch her, its fun to see her expressions. this is a great alternative when i don't have 20 or 30 minutes to do a full workout, its very creative, i can't imagine how hard it would be to keep 3 babies quiet while filming this, that's an accomplishment in or of itself for leisa hart...i think you'll enjoy this variety",1075939200,,744,4.137931034482759
1891769,5,B00009W0VQ,"fitmama is an absolutely brilliant set of pregnancy videos...leisa hart is a doll, i loved her prenatal video and am doing her postnatal video and this wonderfully fun baby workout, it is so much fun and really worth it.",1075248000,,220,4.666666666666667
1891770,5,B00009W0VQ,"my bundle of love is so heavy at 15 pounds that i can't believe how sore i can be doing such a short workout, but i do, and my baby is so cute and cuddly that i have a hard time not spending every minute with her, so this video has been fun. plus, i think i can see some muscles forming in my arms that i have never seen before.., i love all the fitmama videos!",1074729600,,361,3.7012987012987013
1891771,5,B00009W0VQ,"I loved this video. My baby is two months old and really is showing personality with me. I am slowly building up some strenght, and Leisa does plenty of moves with the baby to give me some ideas to do stuff alone. I could only imagaine how hard it must have been to film this, with three little babies. I think that this is a great educational and fitness video for new mommies to have fun working out a bit with the baby, plus, i think the stroller exercises will be great at the park. My little one loves smiling with me and moving to the music. I loved Leisa Hart's Prenatal video and really enjoy this baby video as well as the Postnatal Fitmama.",1074643200,,650,4.208
1891772,5,B00009W0VQ,"this is a neat way to spend some quality time with your baby and have some fun working out...the movements are controlled and my baby is so incredibly happyn doing this with me, the music is great and entire production is excellent!",1073347200,,232,4.5476190476190474
1891773,5,B00009W0VQ,"my wife and little two month old love this video, my wife is getting in a great workout led by a top class master instrucotr who has dozens of videos, and the baby and mommy just seem to forget that mommy is sweating and feeling the burn, they are playing together and bonding and it is beautiful to watch. We recommend this video to any mom who is short on time to do a workout on her own and wants to be with the baby, this is 5 STAR!!!",1072569600,,438,3.932584269662921
1891774,5,B00009W0VQ,"i was given this video, along with fitmama postnatal, and i really loved both of these videos. my baby seems to perk up and feel so happy when i move around with her, and we bond and feel closer by each move, plus i am benefiting by getting a pretty good workout in at the same time, how clever! i suggest you get all of leisa hart's fitmama videos if you are pregnant, or get them for someone who is, i truly love mine and am sending them to other girlfriends this christmas.",1070236800,2,476,4.129032258064516
1891775,5,B00009W0VQ,"I loved the idea of doing some mild aerobics with my baby, as I have reduced some pounds doing Leisa Hart's FitMama Postnatal video I have also cherished the additional bonding I have with my baby doing the FitMama & Me video. Both videos are superb, I loved the idea of saving time by doing a shorter workout, plus I cannot believe how much my arms and legs felt it the next day. Leisa is very beautiful and fit, she is perky but not over the top, she is really the best instructor I have used videos to workout to. This is a must have video. Get all of Leisa hart's videos they are so well done, better than anything else out there. Plus, she's the Buns of Steel girl, so she's worked hard for years to get where she's at. Thanks Leisa! :-)",1070150400,2,742,4.159722222222222
1891776,5,B00009W0VQ,"I had a blast moving and getting a workout in while holding my baby. THe moves were easy and fun and Leisa Hart is the ideal teacher, i loved her prenatal FitMama and her Postnatal, what a great inspiration. This is a great pick me up to do with the baby!",1068422400,,255,4.019607843137255
7993408,5,B00009W0VQ,"i enjoy seeing other moms having fun with their babies, and seeing a fitness star like leisa hart doing something with her little boy made me feel good. i enjoyed seeing the human element that is sometimes lost when you buy a video, this is a neat video with cute ideas to have fun with the baby, and i really enjoy seeing my better giggle and goo at the tv set while moving with me, its a blast.",1108598400,,396,4.089743589743589
7993409,3,B00009W0VQ,"As a new mom of a 6 month old, who used to have time to exercise, I was very excited to get this.  I was disappointed with how basic it was though.  Not really anything that I couldn't come up with on my own, or wasn't already doing with out the tape.  Don't waste your $, just dance and play with your baby on your own.",1105920000,,320,3.8181818181818183
7993410,5,B00009W0VQ,"my darling husband gives me grief for having a new video collection, but he LOVES doing FITMAMA & ME with our third child, its a short woorkout that is a PRICELESS experience for him, and me, and our baby....this is a great addition to any post pregnancy fitness program!",1103500800,,271,4.551020408163265
7993411,5,B00009W0VQ,"I love this VHS, it so cute. I don't have much time to do much with 4 little ones under 7, so when i can dance for five minutes with my infant this is ideal. I wish i had a dvd player, but this works great, and i enjoy Leisa hart immensely...this is very fun and enjoyable.",1089072000,,273,3.807017543859649
7993412,5,B00009W0VQ,"I loved this video, it is so FUN! My baby gets heavier and heavier and I use her for resistance in ways I didn't think I would like, but is is so much fun that I find myself doing some of these moves at the park or while using the stroller. Leisa Hart makes you feel great and makes it a super special time with your baby, I loved this short and sweet video, very good and plain fun!!!",1088467200,,385,3.8860759493670884
7993413,5,B00009W0VQ,"i hvae so much love for my little baby Toby, that when i hold him i almost cry sometimes i am so happy. It's rewarding to be able to get a little fun time in doing Leisa Hart's video, its short and sweet and gets my heart rate going, especially the heavier he starts to weigh. It's fun and worth it.",1086912000,,299,3.918032786885246

7993415,5,B00009W0VQ,"I did a similar review for Leisa Hart's Fitmama Postnatal video. They are both excellent time savers for me. It's hard to find time for me, as in my body, now that my baby has arrived, but I find just enought time to squeeze in a FitMama workout, or even the FitMama & Me baby workout. I love the way they both have short segments, which is all the time i have. I do ten minutes here, ten minutes there, and feel good about doing anything. Leisa Hart is very positive and real, she is a great motivating mother-instructor.",1078358400,,522,4.282828282828283
7993416,5,B00009W0VQ,"I loved working out to FITMAMA PRENATAL while prego, and it is so cooooool to see Leisa and her baby now that I am holding my first child. Hart was captivating in the Fitmama Prenatal, and this is an adorable time in FitMama & Me to smile with my little girl and hold her and swing her to easy moves that i can do after i turn off the tv. Leisa is precious, and I loved this video.",1077667200,,381,3.8974358974358974

It's great to have along with Leisa Hart's FitMama Postnatal video. Hart is so encouraging and pleasant, she's fit and fun to workout to....and I love her videos.",1077494400,,347,4.2727272727272725
