942187,1,6304967160,It wasn't the one I wanted. I saw a special on TV about snipers including Carlos Hathcock and it showed how Carlos laid in wait by a river and picked off a bunch of the enemy one by one as they entered the water. The video I rec'd wasn't the one I wanted.,1412812800,,255,3.830188679245283
942188,5,6304967160,Awesome man,1410652800,,11,5.0
942189,4,6304967160,"Really amazing stories from the master sniper of all time.
A little bit to short, but the interview captures Mr. Hathcock with his very vivid memories of the Vietnam war.
A complement the the books about him.
The sound is poor and the image is so so.
But is worth having it at home.",1387411200,,282,4.2407407407407405
942190,1,6304967160,A complete waste of time and too high a price!!! He told virtually no stories and the tips were non-existent!! My friends and I did as much and didn't get killed either.,1385942400,,169,4.3125
942191,5,6304967160,"Interview with Gunnery Sgt. Carlos Hathcock ""White Feather"" who was a great man, patriot, hero, and extraordinary Marine Sniper. Sgt Hathcock describes some of his very harrowing missions, some of which, were deep behind enemy lines.",1384387200,2,233,5.5
942192,5,6304967160,Must have for all fans of Hathcock and those interested in snipe tactics as he recounts highlights of his career during the Vietnam War.,1367452800,3,136,4.708333333333333
942193,5,6304967160,"you buy this because you've read his books and would like a little peek at the man behind the story. this is not an action film--it's an interview. if you loved reading books about him, you'll love watching this.",1318464000,,212,4.461538461538462
942194,2,6304967160,"If you are looking for in-depth tips into sniper tactics or a biography of the great Carlos Hathcock, don't expect to find it in this video.  It was a poorly conceived production that did not do him justice.  Sgt. Hathcock told a few stories and gave a couple of general suggestions on sniping from behind a desk throughout the entire tape.  The sound quality was terrible and the videography could have been done better by my 8 year old daughter.
  Don't waste your money on this.",1012089600,21,481,4.546511627906977
