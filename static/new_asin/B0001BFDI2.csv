1985958,3,B0001BFDI2,"Having gone through all the Zatoichi DVD's at the local video store several times, I was compelled to purchase the titles missing from their stock.  I purchased this and Zatoichi at large.  I must admit I thought this to be the weakest of all the Zatoichi series up to this point.  The film at times seems to be slightly out of character as it borders on  parody.  The fight scenes featuring Zatoichi are comical and unbelievable.  Especially in the bathhouse, I almost expected to see animated BAM and POW flash across the screen ala Batman, (however, the fighting style of the Samurai trailing Zatoichi was superb). The film seems to go on in this vain with an over the top villain and the climactic ""Festival of Fire"".  Perhaps, taking in the complete series this may be a welcome break from the other films.  The film definitely has its moments and some good characters, but seemed to me to be directed in a more modern style which reminded me of the 2003 release at times.  Is it a bad movie?  Heavens no.  The film is growing on me.  But I would recommend renting this film first, if like me you choose not to own the entire series but rather a few choice selections.  In general I'm not as pleased with the Animeigo releases.  As for Zatoichi the Outlaw... 5 stars!",1093392000,3,1272,4.497816593886463

8009549,5,B0001BFDI2,"See my reviews of Zatoichi 15, 17, 23, and 25.  I have nearly the entire 26 Zatoichi films that Shintaro Katsu made in the 1960's through the mid 1970's, plus most of the tv series he produced after the 26th film.  Zatoichi films can be watched over and over again without getting bored.  Classic good vs evil sword play dramas with comedic and romantic touches.  Consider also the excellent Baian series with Ken Watanabe, a strong Clint Eastwood like presence, who plays a medicine man who wields a mean acupuncture needle when necessary to take out a nefarious gangster type.",1403568000,,578,4.75

What more could you want?  Just add humor, lots of sword action, and a pool of fire!  And Zatoichi falling in love, of course.  Some almost-nudity and strong language - the films are starting to become maybe a tad too realistic.
The DVD came with some extras, such as some notes about the historical background but get it for the main feature, the film!  Enjoy!",1308873600,,529,4.357142857142857
8009551,5,B0001BFDI2,"In a series as long as Zatoichi (26 films in total) you are bound to have some hits and misses.  By any standards ""Zatoichi: The Festival of Fire"" (Japanese title: ""Zatoichi abare-himatsur"" or ""Zatoich: The Raging Fire Festival"") is a full-fledged home run.

First, let's talk about that cast.  Aside from Zatoichi himself, Katsu Shintaro, you have the amazing actor Nakadai Tatsuya (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harakiri/dp/B0009WIE2A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harakiri</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sword-of-Doom/dp/B0007989YS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sword of Doom</a>), the flamboyant Peter (best known as the jester Kyoami in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ran/dp/B000BB14YY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ran</a>, or the voice of Rem in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Note-II-The-Last-Name/dp/B001JTTJ94/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Note II: The Last Name</a>) and making his final film appearance Mori Masayuki (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ugetsu/dp/B000BB14I0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ugetsu</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bushido/dp/B002VRNJDA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bushido</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bad-Sleep-Well/dp/B000BR6QCI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bad Sleep Well</a>).  Back in the director's chair is original ""Zatoichi"" director Misumi Kenji (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Tale-of-Zatoichi/dp/B000063UQU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Tale of Zatoichi</a>).  That is some serious talent coming together for a ""Zatoichi"" flick.

Plot-wise, it is a classic set up.  Zatoichi rescues a beautiful young woman who has fallen on hard times and was forced to sell herself.  Her jealous ex-husband however, (Nakadai) follows her killing anyone who has touched her, finally killing the woman herself.  He thinks that Zatoichi is one of his wife's purchasers, and so dedicates himself to slaying the blind masseur.  Zatoichi, on the other hand, has other things going on when he comes across the promotion ceremony for a new yakuza boss and promptly inserts himself.  The boss (Mori) is a blind man like Zatoichi himself, and serves as Zatoichi's opposite, immune to his usual tricks.  Complicating matters even further is a young pimp (Peter) looking to get himself in good with the mob boss while still remaining essentially a pure heart. As you can guess, swords are drawn, alliances are created and broken, friends become enemies and enemies friends, and Zatoichi's cane sword will run red with blood before the final credits roll.

There is lots of good stuff going on in ""Zatoichi: Festival of Fire.""  Nakadai's character is almost a re-play of ""Sword of Doom,"" a man so dead inside he kills without joy or remorse.  His desire to kill Zatoichi is not based on revenge or passion, as he has killed too many over his wife's betrayal.  Being the last on his list, Zatoichi is all that keeps him going, and he knows when he has struck the blind man down the next act will be to take his own life.  Mori is a classic character as well, charming and sensitive on the surface but hiding a black heart.  Being blind himself, he is immune to Zatoichi's tricks, as he shows them when the two set down to gamble at dice.

Animeigo has done their usual top notch job with this release.  Not a lot of extras or anything, but they have the best subtitles available for Japanese films, and always treat every movie with respect and care.

8009552,5,B0001BFDI2,"This 21st episode of the long running Zatoichi series is highly recommended. This is a truly great film! The cinematography and acting is great! Zatoichi [Shintaro Katsu] and many of the character actors in this film did an excellent acting job in their respective roles. In particular, [Masayuki Mori] of ""Rashomon"" fame. And the twisted and sick-minded Ronin [Tatsuya Nakadai].

In this terrific film, Ichi rescues a woman who has just been sold at an auction. However, she is murdered by an unknown assailant. The murderer is a Ronin [Tatsuya Nakadai], who also happens to be the murdered woman's husband. The Ronin is a hate-filled and jealous man who claims he will kill anyone who touches or ever touched his wife. Zatoichi, who is a masseur, is suspected by this Ronin as having touched her and he vows to kill Ichi: whom the Ronin suspects as having slept with his wife.

Moreover, not only is the Ronin out to get Zatoichi, but Ichi also makes an enemy of the local mob boss played to the hilt by [Masayuki Mori] This mob boss, who like Ichi, is also blind, is incredibly devious, wicked and downright mean. Therefore, you have Ichi caught in the middle of two dangerous men. A dementedly sick Ronin, and a dispicably twisted and evil mob boss. Also, there is a very funny nude yakuza fight scene in a bathhouse: One of many excellent and terrific scenes.

Zatoichi goes through one hell of a time with both of these demented characters. The confrontation with the evil mob boss is incredibly great, and the final confrontation with the demented Ronin is outstanding! Moreover, you have a hilarious scene with [Peter] of ""Ran"" fame trying to seduce and kill Zatoichi. The entire film is a roller-coaster thrill of suspense, drama, hilarity, and just exciting cinema. The cinematography in the film is terrific, as is the musical score in the film. The entire film is a delightful and thoroughly entertaining Zatoichi film. Highly, highly recommended. [Stars: 5+]",1156896000,7,1971,4.8601190476190474
8009553,5,B0001BFDI2,"wonderful human being as hero, brilliant swordplay, captures the human condition. Tatsuya Nakadai adds weight with an excellent performance and gripping showdown

my favorite series, always hits a home run",1142640000,37,205,5.833333333333333
8009554,5,B0001BFDI2,"Personally, this is my favorite Ichi movie.  Any fan of the series will enjoy this, because it has what you've come to expect from Ichi.  As for people new to the series, if you don't like this one you probably shouldn't bother with the others.

As always, the sword choreography was above par.  Katsu's blade passes through untold scores of ne'er-do-wells, and the number of adversaries in the climactic fight is cause for alarm, even if they are facing down Ichi.  For those of you placing a high importance on sword choreography, I would like to mention that this movie contains a a style I've only ever seen once before, in the underrated 'Sword of Doom'.  The 'soundless' form used by Ichi's counterpart is more than impressive, and action followers will want to see this movie just for that alone.

The acting in this particular film is also worth note.  Katsu is always incredible as Ichi, it goes without saying, but the real goods here today is the intense performance of Tatsuya Nakadai, playing a nameless ronin.  Were it not for Shintaro's genius, I would almost say Nakadai stole the show from Ichi himself.  The unrelenting conviction of the nameless ronin is done brilliantly.  If you've seen Sword of Doom, it is essentially the same character as Ryunosuke.

The acting from the rest of the cast is decent.  There is one female of note, but I was left unimpressed by the primary enemy, and no characters other than Ichi and the ronin left an impression on me.  Fortunately, either one of those two more than make up for it, and in fact interactions between the two are some of my favorite scenes in film.

There is a scene midway into the film which seems to have been the basis for the musical choreography we saw in the Beat Takeshi 2003 movie.  Kinda fun.

So my final verdict is a hearty smile and a cheery thumbs up to anybody who does not follow the series, an enthusiastic outburst for those who do, and a 'definite must' for anybody who really liked Sword of Doom, since this might as well be kind of an unofficial sequel.  The acting by the few was unbelievable, the choreography as good as always (perhaps a bit faster than earlier installments), and the two story arcs came together in an exceptionally satisfying way.

I consider this a first tier movie.",1125964800,46,2282,4.617866004962779
8009555,5,B0001BFDI2,"I've seen several films in the Zatoichi, and I have to rate this as the best.  I could see several ties to film noir in this movie, from the outlaw connections and shady bosses (never named) to the femme fatales and grey-shaded hero.

I was particularly drawn to the unnnamed Husband that shadows Zatoichi throughout the movie - here was a man honor-bound to avenge the ""treachery"" of his wife, and even when Zatoichi tells him that nothing occurred between them, the Husband's honor must be upheld.  Driven increasingly eratic by his knowledge, the man pursues his enemy, even helping the blind swordsman when it appears that Zatoichi's life is in danger.  After all, none but him may have the honor of slaying our hero.  Their final fight is one of the most emotional that I have ever seen.

Zatoichi's closing words are chilling, not because he's moving on, but because he's (unsuccessfully) convincing himself that everything is fine.  The blind swordsman is emotionally drained from the resolution of the conflict, and it will be some time before he can open up that much of himself again.",1107129600,56,1094,4.818181818181818
8009556,5,B0001BFDI2,"Here are the goods and bads:

GOODS:

* PERFECT cinematoghraphy (just like Lord of the Rings)

* Good final fight.

* The bad guy is very similar to a evil samurai in japanese animation!

* Zatoichi is surrounded by fire.

* FAST movements by Shintaro Katsu (Zatoichi).

* Zatoichi fights 30 men at the end.

BADS:

* The final fight was good but not AWESOME as ""Zatoichi meets the one armed swordman"".

P.S: Many people are telling me that ""Zatoichi the Outlaw"" is the best but the film was made in the late 60's, I really don't trust in the 60's production because I saw ""Zatoichi Zamatarian"" in 1968 and the movie didn't have the best camera movements as the 70's cameras. But I will give it a try some of this days to watch ""The Outlaw"".

Adios!!!!",1102032000,28,752,4.3768115942028984
