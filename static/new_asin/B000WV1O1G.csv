8225761,4,B000WV1O1G,"Am I understanding this? $65.00 for a used ""Dummy Hoy: A Deaf Hero""? Did anyone know there is a ""3rd Edition"" of the Dummy Hoy DVD story? DOes this one you are selling has a bar code on it? If so thats the 2nd edition. The first Hoy DVD was no bar coded on it. Now there is a third one. Does anyone know that?
If you can see on the doicumentary, the one with Reds cap, red shirt with Hoy image, gold frame glasses, then you have seen me like that back in 2006.
Anyone interested in knowing the 3rd edition? Just inquire.",1321142400,3,520,4.009615384615385
8225762,3,B000WV1O1G,"In docu-drama style, this production helps tell a story that needs to be told more often. Dummy Hoy was, beyond being a deaf ballplayer, a very good ballplayer. Hoy is even referenced in Lawrence Ritter's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Glory-of-Their-Times-The-Story-of-Baseball-Told-By-the-Men-Who-Played-It/dp/0688112730/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Glory of Their Times : The Story of Baseball Told By the Men Who Played It</a>"" I purchased this film with hopes that I would be able to get a bit more substantial knowledge out if it. However, it reads like an elementary biography. The production quality is pretty rough. At times, it feels like it was made as a college term project.
]This film tells an important story about an amazing and amazingly underrated individual. I will be donating this film to my local college's special education department because the story needs to be told. However, of you are a big baseball fan looking for a real baseball film, you might want to pass on this one - unfortunately. Just read up on this guy a bit.",1261094400,2,1096,5.568862275449102
8225763,5,B000WV1O1G,"For any serious baseball fan or student of the game or its history this is a must.  Well done, compelling true story done in docudrama style, of a deaf ball player that had great stats and who influenced the game in many ways in the early days of baseball.......those influences are still with us today.  I found the story quite amazing and was very surprised that it has not been told long before......for baseball movie buffs, make sure you add this to your collection now.",1236902400,3,475,4.576470588235294
8225764,5,B000WV1O1G,"This is an absolutely delightful documentary film about one of the all time great baseball players who happens to be Deaf, William ""Dummy"" Hoy.  The film presents a mixture of pictures and live actors performing select events in the life of Hoy.  The actor who performed as Hoy is Ryan Lane, a fine performer who is also Deaf.  I read bits and pieces about Dummy Hoy and can assure you that this represents among the best.  It presented information which I was not previously aware of.  Some of the individuals who participated in the film to discuss about Hoy were themselves prominent Deaf individuals, including Larry Fleischer and Dr. King Jordan.  Let us all work together and get this great athlete admitted into the Professional Baseball Hall of Fame!",1200700800,8,758,4.837209302325581
