2701876,4,B000LC4WQK,"This is more than 8 hours worth of a telenovela, which is about typical for telenovelas on DVD. Anything less is difficult to fill in the blanks and anything longer--well the better. There are very, very few production companies that release the entire story. I think of telenovelas on DVD as ""souvenirs"".

I was not fortunate to watch it on TV, but I get the jest of the story. Destiny brings together an older, well established business woman (Paz) with spirtually free younger man of the land (Juan Manuel). Both respectfully of their committments to marriage and a chain of events leads them to each other, then marriage and family. Always struggling along the way, just like your typical telenovela.

It has a different story, and has a bit of action in it when Paz hires Juan Manuel to protect her from threats on her life. I really like the story around Nicolas and Barbara. Nicolas is the other bodyguard that is hired to protect Paz's naughty, eating disordered daughter Barbara.",1213142400,,988,4.771929824561403
2701877,2,B000LC4WQK,"I saw this whole 'novela' on cable (560 capitulos), but missed the last 2 'captulos'. So i decided to order this item. I was astonished 2 see that it was like this very first part of the 'novela' and then suddenly the end. They let important parts out of this. Maybe someone who didn't see this 'novela' will think this is a good one. But i saw it! And i would not recommend it to anyone!",1212624000,4,388,4.118421052631579
2701878,4,B000LC4WQK,"Before I start my review I just have to comment on the other reviews. Let's be serious, do you honestly think they should and/or could include the entire novela?? You know how long that would take to watch. The whole point of these that are released on DVD (w/ the rare exceptions, 'Azul Tequila' for example) is to edit out all the useless filler scenes. I for one don't have time to watch a soap every day, so I love these dumbed down versions as they give you all the necesarry parts. I also had no problem following along w/ the storyline. Never was I confused.

Now that I got that off my chest...this was a nice storyline, good actors for the most part (I don't know why but Sergio Basaez irks me for some reason). It's nice that so many TV Azteca soaps are finding their way to the US.",1202860800,2,792,4.245033112582782
2701879,1,B000LC4WQK,"The DVD was horrible because it was so short. While watching it, you are always trying to figure out what is happening. They cut off more than half of the novela, so buying it is a waist.",1202428800,3,187,4.081081081081081

8160898,1,B000LC4WQK,"La verdad no la recomiendo, la Edicin del Dvd Es Pesima!!!
La Telenovela esta muy mal editada, hasta la muerte de Gabriela tiene coherencia despues faltan muchisimos detalles que hacen que se pierda el hilo de la historia y se torne todo muy confuso. No esta el Final de Carolina Costas, no estan las participaciones/actuaciones de Mauro Mendoza/Sebastian Estevanez ni la de Magdalena Millan/Soledad Silveyra. Quitaron todo sobre Samantha, la hermana gemela de Paz, no se ve el Final de Santiago Achaval, la verdad me decepciono, en todo sentido de la palabra. Sinceramente esperaba otra cosa, al menos que tuviera el Final de los Villanos, era lo mas justo, pero ni eso.
Este DVD y el de Un Nuevo Amor son una verdadera decepcin. No los recomiendo a ninguno de los dos!!!",1370131200,,772,4.856060606060606
8160899,3,B000LC4WQK,The video was in very good conditions. I didn't have a problem with that but it is only 8 hours long in total which cuts out many important parts from the original novela. If you are a big fan of this novela you will be dissapointed because its a really really short version of the novela but if u just want to remember the story then go for it.,1303603200,,345,4.0144927536231885
