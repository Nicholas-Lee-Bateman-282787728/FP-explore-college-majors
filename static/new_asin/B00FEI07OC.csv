8614821,3,B00FEI07OC,"It is more like a Geology lesson than what I expected about be told about Glacier National Park.  I expected to find out which is the closest city to fly to, what tours to take etc.. Instead he goes on about the bible saying that the earth exists for 5000 years and in the same breath mentions the millions of years that the Glaciers exists.  He goes on and on quoting the bible, but I could not figure out the connection with the age of the glaciers.  Also, he gesticulates as if he does his daily  exercise.  After a while I got exhausted just watching him.  The photography is beautiful and if I had not taken geology in college, I would have learned a lot.  However, it did not give me what I hoped to find out.",1516492800,,715,4.175182481751825
