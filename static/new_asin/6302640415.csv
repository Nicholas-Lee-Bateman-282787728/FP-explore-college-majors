487950,5,6302640415,"No matter how many times I watch this movie, it never seems to get old.  Combining elements of American action shoot 'em ups with the chop-socky combat of the Hong Kong martial arts genre, ""Rapid Fire"" seems bent on squeezing as many action sequences as possible into its brisk 90-minute running time.  However, in between fight scenes, the writers and director actually take time for little things like plot and character development, which are too often lacking in martial arts flicks (can you say Steven Seagal)?  The main characters, Brandon Lee's reluctant crime fighter and Powers Boothe's grizzled cop, actually have some beliefs and internal conflicts that motivate their actions.  And on top of that, there are some actors in this movie who can actually act!  In the action department, the fight scenes are extremely well done, devoid of camera tricks, multiple angles, fancing directing, or any other gimmicks that distract from the fight scenes themselves.  It seems the makers of this film knew what they had in Brandon Lee and let him and the other actors carry the action on their own, a decision that definitely paid off.  Highly recommended for those who want a little brains to go with their action.",1021161600,28,1216,4.960591133004926
487951,4,6302640415,"Finally, they released this movie on DVD! This is Brandon's best movie, unfortunately he didn't have the chance to keep climbing the ladder of success and make greater movies. Well it's a good action movie. Cops vs. Mobsters and Lee gets caught up in the middle of it! Could have had more features like deleted scenes and trailer and so on, but good it's available on DVD.",1018742400,,372,4.567164179104478
487952,5,6302640415,"Brandon Lee, an exceptional martial artist in his own right, stars in this Hong Kong style action movie. Full of flying feet, guns blasting, and bombs blowing up. Lee shows us his skills in kung fu and Muay Thai as he goes up against the Italian mafia and the Chinese triads. His physical abilities are incredible, with his body sculpted to near perfection, like his father, Bruce Lee. Lee keeps up the legend using his father's style but he also takes it a step further when he combines it with Jackie Chan's style when he engages in battle. Also full of amazing stunts this movie is a must watch if you are an action fan, martial arts fan, or a fan of the legendary Lees. It is sad that Brandon Lee is gone, but in ""Rapid Fire"" and his other movies, he will live forever.",959126400,13,773,4.337931034482758

Man I misses those type of movies from the 90`s (Die Hard, Hard To Kill, Double Impact, etc.) where you could kick back and just enjoy the over exaggerated violence and like the movie for exactly what it's worth.

488233,5,6302640415,One of the best action and martial arts flicks of all time. Like how they use the raw gritty streets of Chicago for their backdrop. Really bumed out about  the passing of what would've been one of the best martial artist on the screen. But at least we got Rapid Fire.

488280,1,6302640415,"I'm old enough to have seen Enter the Dragon in its first release. I am really not hypercritical about fun, silly, action movies. But the reviews on this movie really need some non-fanboy calibration. Brandon Lee is a wooden actor at best. There was probably no better role for him than in the ill-fated Crow. Lots of makeup and violence, not much need to act. In this movie he is called upon to be a real person and just doesn't have the chops to pull it off. It is embarrassing to watch. Couple that with fight scenes that aren't as good as most modern television series (or youtube), terrible dialogue and all sorts of plot holes - boom - you get Rapid Fire.  Don't do it to yourself unless drunk, high or desperate. The 3, 4, 5 star reviews - shame on you.

This film features Brandon as an art student who witnesses a murder and is then caught between the Chinese and Italian mafias, the FBI, and the Chicago police department.  Lee's martial arts style is unique and fun to watch--sort of a cross between Jackie Chan's acrobatics and Jason Statham's fisticuffs.",1238457600,,551,4.729166666666667
488370,4,6302640415,"As a teen, I was a huge Bruce Lee fan. Naturally, I practiced martial arts as well. Most of my kicks aren't courtesy of the Sensei at the dojo where I practiced karate, no that honor goes to the TV. I remember myself pressing, rewind-play-rewind at every move Bruce made and attempted to copy them.

Then I found out about his son's movie ""The Crow"" and to say it was a big hit with me is an understatement. I loved it. But I wanted to know if he'd made anything else that was notable. Since none of his other movies were big budget blockbusters, I had small expectations.

Enter Rapid Fire.

It seemed like your average Seagal B movie. But then, Brandon Lee wasn't B-movie material. He literally carried the movie to new heights. Okay, I may be biased, but this movie really made me fall in love with the guy.
He's got it all. Feet that kick like David Beckham, trip hammers for fists and a look in his eyes that makes glass wanting to go back to being sand. Sure the plot is thin, but the action scenes make up for it.

No, Brandon Lee wasn't a dud who had a lucky shot in a blockbuster movie. Hollywood really lost talent and that's a shame. As with Heath Ledger, I'm left wondering: ""why do the good die young?""",1237593600,,1215,4.269565217391304

488372,3,6302640415,"After the consummate disaster of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Laser-Mission/dp/B00005A0Q9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Laser Mission</a>, the late Brandon Lee needed a new vehicle to reintroduce himself as a potential solo star, and ""Rapid Fire"" came at just the right time. Nevertheless, this one isn't perfect, either. While Lee's fifth starring picture is a neat little action flick, its unambitious plot and screenplay consistently trouble the film, rendering it less noteworthy than it should be.

The story: After a martial arts-practicing college student (Lee) witnesses an underworld crime, he's caught up in a deadly mafia war and the mission of a maverick cop (Powers Booth) to take down a Chinese drug lord (Tzi Ma).

""Rapid Fire"" hints that had his life not been cut short, Lee would've been on his way to become one of the mainstay stars of the action era. While the film is less remarkable, Lee smoothly switches between the actor and the fighting machine: his kung fu is good and he's miles ahead of the likes of Jean-Claude Van Damme or Arnold Schwarzenegger when it comes to acting. The supporting cast does fine, too: though the movie doesn't invest much in character development, costars Powers Booth and Raymond Berry in particular are memorable in making the most of their roles.

However, the most important aspect of the movie - the action content - is a hit-and-miss. To break it down, the scenes in the club and the in the laundromat are good, the one in the hotel is decent, and the first one at the bar is rather poor. While Lee certainly has the moves, the choreography and camerawork tend to be a bit lacking, and give the impression that he's not as good as he really is. And as aforementioned, the film's story is terrifically bland. It  feels as though the director (Dwight Little,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marked-for-Death/dp/6305168873/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marked for Death</a>) was going down a checklist of action-movie clichs (the obligatory romance angle, Lee boneheaded struggling with his dead father's legacy, etc.) and sticking them in the movie wherever they seemed to fit.

While ""Rapid Fire"" isn't about to match&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Crow/dp/6304765231/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Crow</a>, it also kind of fails to measure up to other action-adventures of the time - be it&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Under-Siege/dp/0790732238/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Under Siege</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Timecop/dp/0783225520/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Timecop</a>. But that doesn't mean it isn't a fun movie. Though slightly disappointing, ""Rapid Fire"" is enough to make you miss Brandon Lee and make you dream of what he might've contributed to film had he lived longer.

488394,4,6302640415,"For any martial arts movie fans out there, Rapid Fire is a must own.  This is a well-made martial arts film, but also stars a great martial artist - the late Brandon Lee (son of the great Bruce Lee).  Brandon may not have the skills of his father (who ever has?), but he is wonderful to watch in action, with a fluidity and gracefullness to all his moves.  Rapide Fire has it all - a good lead, great action, and a story that actually works hard.

The film is made well.  Picture quality and sound are all good.  There is a ton of action, combining lots of gun fire & exlposions with large amounts of kung-fu.  Between the action scenes, unlike most martial art films, there is plot, and plenty of it.  The story is actually more 3-dimensional, if you will, compared to many action movies.  The actors do a decent job, and their characters actually have some presence.

The action is probably what its all about when one thinks about purchasing this film.  The action is not only a plenty, but superb.  Brandon Lee can obviously make any fight scene look great, and the choreographer and camera man knew what they were doing in this film.  The fights are just wonderful and I am pleased to see that there was little editing done.  The final fight in the film takes place on the Subway tracks at night - quite cool and original.  Though it is a nice little final fight, there are a few more one on one's I loved even more involving Brandon Lee throughout the film.

Rapid Fire is one of the better martial art movies out there.  It has everything.  If you don't enjoy this, you may want to stay away from the majority of martial arts films.",1184803200,,1639,4.370860927152318

As far as movies go this one has intense action, good characters, strong plot with a dash of romance and decent acting for this type of film. This movie would be ok for teenagers but not for young kids, it has a LOT of violence, some cursing and a hot love scene!

488397,4,6302640415,"Rapid Fire will forever stand as the movie that landed Brandon Lee the star making role of the Crow, which sadly as we all know, would be the last time he graced the screen.  Lee plays a college student and martial artist with a tragic past who witnesses a mob hit and is soon on the run.  Eventually he allies himself with an obsessed cop (Powers Boothe) to bring down the mob and the heroin smuggling drug ring it fronts, with plenty of greatly coreographed action along the way.  Lee alone makes Rapid Fire worth seeing, not only because it was one of his last screen roles and a look at what might have been, but because he could have become the biggest action star of his time, much like his legendary father.  Lee has all the right moves here, and his swaggering performance is reason enough to see the film.  Boothe is great as well in one of his rare good guy roles, and the cast is rounded out by an ultra sleezy Nick Mancuso as a mob boss and Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3's Kate Hodge.  The story isn't always coherent, and the editing is a bit triteful, but for action fans and fans of Lee's short lived legacy, this is worth picking up.",1128384000,5,1158,4.337962962962963

488399,5,6302640415,"To the strains of sitar music, a lithe figure dressed in white moves in slow motion against a black background, his graceful movements funneling seamlessly into violence. One by one, opponents present themselves. One by one they're smashed aside. Slowly we segue into a close-up of an intense, handsome young man's face, and we see the words BRANDON LEE. Thus begins Rapid Fire. If you wanted to build a martial arts movie superstar - and obviously that was the goal - you couldn't have done it better than with that sequence.

Serious martial artists were aware of Brandon Lee's existence since his birth. They also knew he wanted to follow in his father's footsteps as an actor. All across America - probably the world - untold thousands of people rooted for him. Brandon paid his dues in a few ultra-low-budget projects before co-starring with Dolph Lundgren in Showdown In Little Tokyo. Not a great film, but Brandon was good in it, and that got him Rapid Fire, his first lead role and, as it turned out, an absolute starmaker. (On the strength of Rapid Fire, Brandon got The Crow - and we all know how that turned out.)

It's fascinating to compare Brandon as a martial artist in Rapid Fire to his dad. Bruce Lee started out a highly skilled martial artist with real-world capabilities who became an actor. Brandon by contrast always wanted to be an actor, thus his martial arts training was geared toward flashy techniques that would look good on-screen. What the hell, they DID look great. Brandon, though obviously a fine athlete, didn't have his father's explosive speed and power. But then, who does?

So many martial arts movies are dumb chock-socky. By contrast Rapid Fire is well-written and directed, and decently acted, especially by Brandon, Powers Boothe as Detective Lieutenant Mace Ryan (God, you gotta love that name), and Nick Mancuso in a cheerfully over-the-top performance as a crazed mob boss. On top of that, Rapid Fire fulfills the greatest requirement of a martial arts flick: the sense, as you watch the actors in motion on the screen, of ""Oh my God, I didn't know human beings could DO that."" This is not a love of violence per se, but rather a love of watching hard, competent people push the human body's design parameters in violent conflict.

The fights in Rapid Fire were choreographed by Brandon and Jeff Imada. The standout scene is a fight to the death between Brandon and Al Leong (probably best known as Endo, the torturer from Lethal Weapon, and Uli, the chocolate eating terrorist from Die Hard). All the fight scenes are top-notch, though several stunts, like using a motorcycle to drive a bad guy through a row of glass display cases, and employing a clothing rack to trip an opponent during a fight, were lifted from Jackie Chan's Police Story. However (a) in all honesty I have to say that both these moments were done better in Rapid Fire, (b) in 1992 in the US only a handful of hardcore kung fu movie buffs had ever seen a Jackie Chan film; even those few recognizing the influence probably smiled at the homage rather than considering it a rip-off.

There are other smile-making moments in Rapid Fire, like comments on how Jake Lo's (Brandon's) deceased father was such a great martial artist; Brandon's summary clocking of a bad guy dramatically swinging nunchukas, his dad's most famous weapon (obviously this fellow had watched way too many Bruce Lee movies); Brandon using as a disguise an outfit incorporating the same sort of Coke bottle glasses his dad used for the same purpose in The Chinese Connection; and I laughed out loud at the scene where Jake explodes all over a treacherous FBI agent, beating him like a red-headed stepchild, leading Mace Ryan to comment, ""Jake, why don't you take those fists of fury of yours outside?"" That little in-joke requires no explanation to any Bruce Lee fan.

So for Brandon a handful of crappy roles led to Showdown In Little Tokyo (so-so) begat Rapid Fire (a truly, deeply enjoyable action adventure flick) and then The Crow (an absolute masterpiece). And that's all we're ever going to have of Brandon Lee.",1101427200,19,4105,4.790960451977401

488402,5,6302640415,"Just like his father, Brandon Lee was tragically taken from us way too early. From the opening sequence we can see a little glimpse of Bruce Lee in him. Rapid fire is an excellent martial arts movie with some very good fight scenes and explosive action. Brandon Lee using only his hands as weapons unleashes his own fists of fury on the bad guys. Jake Lo witnesses a brutal killing by a drug boss played by Nick Mancuso and quickly realizes he is being hunted by mobsters and corrupt Federal agents.  With nowhere to go, He is forced into helping an obsessed Chicago cop and his unit take down the drug cartel once and for all. With the help of the only cop he can trust, Jake Lo sets out to single handedly take down the drug boss for good.

What this movie lacks in dialogue it definitely makes up in action. I have read that some of the reviewers have had freezing problems with their discs; fortunately I have not encountered this problem. In my opinion the picture is very clear and the sound in Dolby Digital 4.0 is good but inconsistent and sound levels drop at certain times during the movie. This is pretty much a bare bones release, however there is a Brandon Lee profile, featurette and trailer but that's about it.

If you're a fan of martial arts or action movies check this one out, I'm sure it won't disappoint. If you're looking for the ultimate Brandon Lee film you must check out the ""Crow"". Due to Bruce Lee's untimely death in 1973 and Brandon's tragic death in 1993 we'll never see what this father and son martial arts duo could have done on screen together.

488444,4,6302640415,"Well, I just got my order of Rapid Fire today and just like some of the customers who posted an interview, I too am having slight problems with the disc. Actually, just 1 minor problem. It freezes in the middle of the fight in the bar just before Brandon fights the big man. I don't how it's possible for many people to have this same problem with different 'Rapid Fire' DVD discs. I thought it was either the disc or my DVD player. Luckily, I came here to and found out that I'm not the only one with this disc defect. I guess the company that made the Rapid Fire disc are the ones responsible(manufacture defect). Please correct me if I'm wrong on that one.
I've already found out from other people that they have returned their Rapid Fire disc to replace it with the same copy and still they have the same problem. I won't even bother returning it after finding this out.
Another problem I experience is the poor quality sound. I have Rapid Fire on tape. Actually, my dad recorded it on a tape in EP(extended play) when I was little and to this day the sound comes out better than the one on DVD. When I say that, I mean that in my tape, a punching sound can be heard and felt better than the one on DVD. The sound on DVD(gun shots, punches, etc.) was toned down a bit. I also have some other movies on DVD where some sounds cannot be heard or were toned down whereas on VHS, the sound effects are better heard.
Does anyone know why the ""pause"" happens in the bar fight? I once tried to fast forward it but it froze and nothing happens. I even tried to rewind, press stop, and even push the OFF button on my DVD player and it still wouldn't do anything. It completely froze my whole DVD player....then after 5 seconds it turned off cause I pressed the OFF button. Reminds me of my computer everytime it freezes. I guess it's because I have to fast forward right BEFORE it freezes, NOT WHILE it is frozen. Anyone here ever tried that?
Other than that, the movie was good. I've always like this movie and Brandon Lee is amazing. It's just that damn defect though that ruins my interest in watching the movie on DVD. Damn, now I have to resort to my VHS version, which I don't mind but the problem is, my VHS player isn't working at the moment. Heheh.
Well, that's it. Someone please respond back if you are in the same position as I am. Thanks!",1051833600,2,2345,4.260089686098655
488445,5,6302640415,"RAPID FIRE is definitely a kung fu movie classic, and right now, my favorite Brandon Lee movie (Just about to watch the rather under-recognized LASER MISSION.) Brandon Lee stars as college student/martial arts master Jake Lo, who refuses to join Chinese Democracy activists, since his father was murdered for the very same cause. Lo becomes entangled in a web of diaster when mafia druglord Antonio Serrano (Nick Mancuso) murders the chief distributor of a competing drug lord Kinman Tau (Tzi Ma, from RUSH HOUR)to get ahold of his drug trade. Lo has the unenviable misfortune of witnessing the whole damn thing and must join forces with crusty chicago cop Ryan (Powers Booth) and his beautiful partner (Kate Hodge) to take down both Serrano AND Tau. Once the action starts, it doesn't stop. I think the climatic battle between Brandon and asian bad guy Al Leong (whose had duels with guys like Jean-Claude Van Damme and Bruce Willis) is this movies best and easily the best in '92, and finally one of the best ever. One of the quite abundant brawls even occurs on the chicago el, where Brandon and his opponent mostly just use steel rods as their weapons. A kung fu flick to be cherished by kung fu fans, as well as Brandon Lee fans all over the world. Buy this one right now, you won't regret it.",1051574400,3,1298,4.672489082969432

488447,3,6302640415,"I agree with Mr. Tindall of Colorado, I would have given ""Rapid Fire"" 4 and a 1/2 stars but with the problems with the discs I lower my rating to 3 stars.  (I realize this is not a 2-disc set, I will clarify my statement in a sec!)  I enjoyed this film in which Brandon Lee starred as student Jake Lo.
  It was a great film, and it was great to see veteran stunt actor Gene LeBell as one of Cerano's ( Nick Mancuso ) thugs.  Gene LeBell ( former pro-wrestler Hank Hangman ) has been in tons of movies over the years most recently ( to my mind ) as the cabbie that pulls his gun on both Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker in the first ""Rush Hour"" movie.  It's ironic and rather fitting that Gene also appeared with Brandon's dad Bruce / ""Kato"" on the TV show ""The Green Hornet"" as seen on the Brentwood Home Video DVD collection.  Gene the burly redhead can be seen in ""Rapid Fire"" in the big shootout in the bar between Powers Boothe's cops and Cerano's thugs in the middle of the movie.  Gene is the one wheeling out the big portable mounted machine gun.
  It is here notably, that I experienced my problem with the disc.  The next scene where Brandon / Jake fights with Cerano's big Lummox behind the bar, like Mr. Tindall I experience a pause flutter that I have to skip to get around.  I've returned the DVD and bought other copies to have them all stop / ""flutter"" in the same spot.  I have a second generation DVD player (i.e. pre- DTS, progressive scan) yet I have played 100's of DVD's in my collection without such problems.  I've only experienced one other American DVD problem (I won't touch on problematic import discs) and that is Disney's ""Emperor's New Groove"" (Similar pause-stop/ flutter at the beginning of that film).  I'm curious if this was a bad print run of discs, if anyone else has experienced this problem, or if the defect is in the ""Master"".  I would appreciate if  anyone who has bought this DVD without this problem would state so, just so I know good copies exist!
  I have been a big fan of Brandon Lee and have eagerly awaited this film to be made available on  DVD.  Brandon's death greatly affected me, more so than his famous father's for I was very young when Bruce died (I'm close to Brandon's age).  It's hard to imagine what a vacuum Bruce's untimely death left in young Brandon's life.  I can only begin to imagine what a large shadow Brandon had to grow into manhood under!  I followed Brandon's career closely and rooted for his successes.  I know ""Laser Mission"" sucks, but as a completist I have it in my collection.  Brandon's fans are doing themselves a disservice if they ignore the little known Hong Kong film ""Legacy of Rage"".  I enjoyed ""Showdown in Little Tokyo"" when Brandon played second fiddle to ""Duh-Dolph"", I felt he should have been first chair! (I understand! He was paying his dues)  I  enjoyed the fight choreography, Brandon's quips, the ever present Cary- Hariyuki Tagawa  (""Pearl Harbor"", ""Planet of the Apes""2001).  It was great up until Brandon uttered that embarrassing BS ego-trip line for Dolph's bruised self-esteem (talk about ""cutting the cables"" to the suspension of disbelief).  ""Rapid Fire"" is a great fight fan film!  With inventive choreography (for Hollywood!), remember this was pre- ""Matrix"", ""Crouching Tiger""...  Brandon displayed blossoming acting chops as well as kicks, which fans know bloomed in his poignant performance in ""The Crow"".  His performances foretold of greatness tragically cut short by his accidental death.  I viewed both ""Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story"", and ""The Crow"" with a heavy heart haunted by the prophetic nature of both films.
  On a lighter note, I agree with the lady down under, who's review stated she enjoyed the fight at the end of ""Rapid Fire"" between Brandon and the little guy coming down the stairs.  That ""little guy"" was Al Leong (not to be confused with ""Aki""Al Leong).  Al Leong the veteran Martial Artist / choreographer has been in many memorable movies (most notably as ""Endo"" the torturer in the first ""Lethal Weapon"", or as the candy eating terrorist in Alan Rickman's ""crew""in ""Die Hard"".  Al's presence these days seem relegated to quick death cameos (if you blinked you missed him in the Japanese fish cannery boat in ""Godzilla""*American flop*, and in the end gun battle of Chow Yun Fat's American Debut ""The Replacement Killers"".  Al seems to be more behind the scenes now choreographing films like ""The Scorpion King"" (Al's visible in the fight choreography documentary on that DVD)  Al Leong can be seen in the films ""Big Trouble in Little China""(a personal fave!), ""The Perfect Weapon"", as well as ""Showdown in Little Tokyo"".
  I noted, as any fan of Hong Kong / Jackie Chan films would, that many Jackie Chan specific fight moves were borrowed and used in ""Rapid Fire"". Most notably Brandon's use of the rolling clothes rack to sweep the legs out from under the thugs at the laundry, and the motorcycle ""crash / ride"" of the thug on the front of the bike through glass cases was lifted from Jackie Chan's first ""Police Story"" movie.  Oh well, as Colton said ""Imitation is the sincerest of flattery"".",1042329600,6,5129,4.655172413793103

This movie is full of great martial arts moves, comedy, and a decent cast. Powers Boothe is really great in this, one of the few movies i've liked him in besides Red Dawn. It has it's stupid moments and corny one liners, but in no way are they as bad as Showndown in Little Tokyo. Brandon Lee looks great in this movie and has some great moves i would love to learn for myself. I'm suprised he didn't get more recognition from this movie before The Crow came out.
This movie is entertaining and a certain scene with a ""train"" was even copied in a video game called ""blood"" as a tribute, it's a classic movie moment. Good action flick, great Brandon Lee Movie. Add this to your collection if your a martial arts and a Brand Lee Fan and you won't regret it. I'll be buying this on DVD asap. One of my favorite moves from this movie is definetly the double punch of ""Cerrano"", Fist first then the elbow, in one quick motion. Awesome.",1035244800,,1087,4.281553398058253

I don't know, it's Brandon Lee, it's action, it's not Laser Mission, it's maybe just a little sickening that it took someone this long to make a move.  How [sad].

488452,4,6302640415,"Rapid Fire does not aim at greatness the way The Crow does.  But within its own parameters and ambitions, it succeeds quite well:  As the first showcase for Brandon Lee as a leading man, and as a tight, small-scale action movie with a little more attention to emotional resonance than usual.
As art student Jake Lo, Lee has not quite matured fully at this stage, but he is already great to watch -- while not quite possessing of Bruce Lee's charisma and rock-hard machismo, Brandon has much more acting finesse, a terrific blend of youthful cockiness and vulnerable sensitivity, and of course, much better dialogue delivery than his venerable father.  He is ably supported by the beautiful Kate Hodge, who plays a stronger and smarter female counterpart than in most action movies of this breed.  Powers Boothe as crusader cop Mace is an acquired taste and Nick Mancuso overdoes his greasy-mobster thing, but it doesn't really detract from the brisk pacing, well choreographed fight scenes and a nice subplot involving the main character's involvement in the Chinese student democratic movement.
The only real dud in this movie is the sound.  The gunfire in Rapid Fire sounds as weak as a food processor, many martial-arts sequences suffer from weak or missing sounds, and the '80s power-rock that accompanies the (pretty well executed) love scene and the ending definitely makes this movie seem dated.  Nevertheless, a good action showpiece.",1022544000,,1442,5.063291139240507
488453,5,6302640415,"For once a martial arts film that has a half decent plot and is not completely butchered by the Americans.
Considering what the Americans have done to Brandon's other films (Legacy of Rage and Showdown in LT) I was impressed.
There's equity between the Asian and American actors and the film is enjoyable and furthermore, something you can sit through and not curse Western filmmaking.
The relationship between Brandon and Power's relationship makes for some interesting viewing and the acting is realistic for once and not overacted like in other flicks.
However, more importantly and let's face it, what we watch it for, are the martial arts sequences.
The one towards the end between Brandon and that small guy who comes down the stairs is brilliant - the choreography is great and the way Brandon works his hands is amazing.
Overall, a bloody good martial arts film featuring one of the best, after his father, and a must see for Lee fans.",1021680000,,943,4.827160493827161

From 1992, we get the story (typical) of a pacifist California Student who saw his father killed in Tienamen Square and then witnesses the murder of a man in an art gallery and the killer happens to be a notorious Mafia guy that the cops and feds are trying to get. They draft our hero, who is a karate expert against his will into the seedy world of underground crime. He has to help and has no idea who to trust and who has been bought off. I adored Brandon and loved his fighting style very much, not too much of a shock that he fights like his dad did, another one I will miss. The story isn't the best and a lot of the acting isn't the best, but you have to know what you are getting....Brandon Kicking Butt!",1516752000,,762,4.086666666666667

Unfortunately he never got the chance to develop into a better actor.  The movie is well-cast.  Somewhat sadly, the last time I got the urge to watch this movie, as soon as I turned it off I learned Powers Boothe had just died. I even liked the nod to Bruce Lee's use of the nunchaku in the laundry scene, where Brandon Lee faces a bad guy with a nunchaku and fouls it by throwing some of the laundry at it.

This used to be a 5 star film for me, but ever since I saw Jackie Chan's first Police Story and saw how many stunts were taken directly from it, it ceased to be as enjoyable.  I can say Pat Johnson's choreography improved since Showdown in Little Tokyo, although he kept the move where the bad guy catches Lee's leg in mid-kick, only to have Lee flip over and kick him with the other leg.",1513814400,,1010,4.322751322751323
