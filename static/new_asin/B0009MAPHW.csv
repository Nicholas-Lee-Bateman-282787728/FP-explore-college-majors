2299718,1,B0009MAPHW,"This DVD compilation was a big disappointment.  It contains none of Anna's most famous pieces, e,g, The Ring, Hamlet or G & S, and a lot of the pieces which are contained are rather unfunny and dated.",1176163200,11,200,4.405405405405405
2299719,4,B0009MAPHW,"if you have never seen or heard anna russell, this is not where to start. one MUST start with ""anna russell explains the ring"" (available on another of her dvds) but this compilation of television appearances from the early 60s is a terrific find for those previously acquainted with the work of the brilliant comedienne/singer, who punctures the pomposity of classical music while still offering",1174867200,22,396,5.107692307692307
2299720,3,B0009MAPHW,Sad to say this dvd covers only a small section of Anna Russel's talent the first section is sadly a let down there are far better showings of Anna's talent than the ones selected  the second section in colour is slightly better at least one gets to see her humour  this section is far too short again they could have chosen a better segment of her send ups eg the ring cycle the last section the interview is a saving factor with this dvd  still one must be thankful  that you have a record of Anna's amazing talent inspite of the let downs it is still worth having,1162425600,19,566,4.212962962962963

8063050,5,B0009MAPHW,So funny!!!  Highly recommended.,1451174400,,32,7.0
8063051,5,B0009MAPHW,A lend in our time.  Her view of Opera is unique and very funny.,1426464000,,64,3.5714285714285716
8063052,4,B0009MAPHW,"I saw Anna Russell perform in St. Louis (Washington University) in about 1958 and was so enthralled that I bought a vinyl record at that time.  Some of the freshness that characterized that performance is gone from this performance by a considerably older Ms. Russell, but the humor and sharp satire still come shining through.  Her ""analysis of the Ring"" has to be a high point of classical music spoofs.",1420761600,2,405,4.771428571428571
8063053,4,B0009MAPHW,"As enthusiastic Anna Russell fans, my wife and I would recommend purchasing all of audio CDs which show her to better advantage then television.",1417132800,,144,5.041666666666667
8063054,5,B0009MAPHW,"What is there to say except only in a lifetime does the magnificent person of Anna come to share her talent.
Afetr seven decades of life there is only one, and better than Rusty Warren who also managed tears of joy.",1366156800,,215,4.2682926829268295
8063055,5,B0009MAPHW,"This lady is SO entertaining.  My uncle and I enjoy opera, and watching Ms. Russell's parody was wonderfully entertaining. (By the way, my uncle is 94, and he had tears in his eyes from laughing so hard!)",1355443200,,204,4.513513513513513
8063056,5,B0009MAPHW,"These are some earlier performances of Anna Russell but are just as hilarious as later one, the best being her ""The (First) Farewell Concert"".  A true comedian who knows her music and her comedy!",1354492800,,195,4.735294117647059
8063057,5,B0009MAPHW,"I grew up with Anna Russell from the Town Hall concert in the early 50's to this DVD.  With her parodies she gave to me the appreciation of Wagner, Verdi, Mozart and all the others.  The routines never grow old; they are like a fine wine, they improve with age.  Even 30 + years later, they are still funny.  I highly recommend ALL her recordings.  She has no equal in this field.  I admit she might have been a little long in the tooth in this DVD, but she was still a great entertainer.  ""I'M NOT MAKING THIS UP, YOU KNOW!!!""",1334448000,,527,4.158415841584159
8063058,5,B0009MAPHW,"I've been a fan of this talented lady for over 60 years.
She was a top quality performer then and I'm so grateful for the recorded preservation of her work which clearly shows that she is a top quality performer now.
  Thanks to AMAZON for making this possible, at a fair and reasonable price as is true of a multitude of and variety of products one can acquire through AMAZON.",1313280000,3,377,4.371428571428571
