8561244,1,B00B21BWH6,"2012 Japanese Drama ""Ooku - Tanjou"" is a high-level production with popular actors and actresses, great costumes, settings, etc. But the ""English"" subtitles are incomprehensible. Here is an example: the main character says, ""Just who is what kind of person who does not is a girl."" The other character answers, ""Now that you have knowledge of then you will life can not take this large Austrian half step.""
Unless you understand Japanese or have a Japanese or Chinese friend who can translate for you (assuming the Chinese translation is more accurate), you will not understand what people are saying. I have several of the other Ooku DVDs which also have horrendous subtitles. However, this one takes the cake. The subtitles are completely worthless.",1364256000,2,751,5.1138211382113825
