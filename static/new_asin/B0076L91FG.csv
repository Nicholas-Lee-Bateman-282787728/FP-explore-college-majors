I am a fan of fun, raunchy and campy good times, but I got burned by both films. I ordered this, Cannibal Lolita, Tomboys, and Sledge all at the same time. I watched them all in 2 days, and I am still in a downward spiral of depression. I should have just took my $75.00, s*** on it, then set it on fire. I collect raunchy, sleazy, grindhouse, exploitation, nazisploitation, nunsploitation, slasher, extreme horror,etc. I usually know what I'm doing when I order movies. I could go on forever about how bad the 4 movies I mentioned above are. If you are still thinking about buying one of these films, you can't say I didn't warn you.",1415577600,,805,4.337748344370861

8510979,4,B0076L91FG,"To say this movie is minimalist would be overstating it.

Essentially, this movie is nothing more than one guy and three (or four?) women filming something akin to a porn. There is no plot, as such, the movie is strictly a bizarre movie hailing towards Wes Craven's ""The Last House on the Left"" with extra nudity and explicit female masturbation. Or, alternately, something modern out of the ""Something Weird Video"" portfolio that Herschel Gordon Lewis might have directed. Well, OK, Herschel Gordon Lewis would have had 20% more plot in the movie.

There are three rape victims and the principal character's (Peter Gruber) sister who seems to be systematically trying to seduce him after having been their father's main squeeze. This and the principal character's obsession with sexually driving the devil out of young women seem to be the only hints of plot, but again, to call the plot threadbare would be a fulsome compliment. The special effects are craptacular. The editing is terrible. The background score was deplorable (Although my friend liked the music). The makeup is amateurish. As another reviewer made note of, the women in the movie are...less than hot. Suffice it to say this movie lacked a lot of what would have made it a contender. It has an anticipation associated with it...It has a ""Can't turn away, there's a car accident on the side of the road...I have to see if anything interesting is going to happen."" quality to it.

So, on to a rating. There are Hollywood movies and there is hardcore porn. Some porn companies have attempted to make a movie that attempts to bridge the gap between Hollywood and hardcore porn, but have largely failed. Softcore and independent movies have touched the gap, but usually lack a lot of things including something even coming close to hardcore porn. There is no hardcore porn in this movie, just to be clear. Its much harder than what you would find in a softcore porn or in a ""Skinemax"" movie. Some of the old softcore porns did a decent job of making the gap between the two pretty small, but its been 20-some years since anything decent came out. This movie somehow makes the divide seem smaller. It lacks plot. It lacks lots of stuff, but it has some sexual energy to it, although its energy is sick, abusive and incestuous. So, on its merits, I would give this movie 2 stars. I give it generously one-and-a-half bonus stars for making something that made a place between opposite spheres of movies. 7/10",1337126400,9,2469,4.77751756440281
