5494656,2,B00ARKYT3C,"This movie is really very, bad.  The two stars are for Susan Hampshire who gives a performance very different from any other I've ever seen.  She's an amoral foul mouthed painter making a living through forgery.  Gina L. is very, very beautiful, but really gets little to do but posture, looking alternatively love sick, and heart broken.  The script is not at all logical, very disjointed and pretty repellant.  The male lead is a pretty boy type but without much charisma which makes one wonder why gorgeous women would throw themselves at such an obvious louse.  It's one of the longest 70 minute movies I've ever seen but it seems to have been edited severely do don't expect any kind of development from situation to situation.  It wasn't expensive and the print is ok, but I doubt I'll ever watch it again.",1366934400,14,812,4.676056338028169

8556899,1,B00ARKYT3C,"This is truly dreadful. Probably a very low point in her career, but the ""quality"" (I use this term sarcastically) of the print is atrocious.

The film clocks in at 69 minutes and every one of them is a task of mediocrity. The pacing is terrible, as another writer pointed out; this ""story"" plays out like a bad porn flick (only without any gratuitous nudity). The only selling point is Gina Lolllobrigida. I am a fan of her early work; this seems like something an actress would do as a favor or on a downward spiraling alcoholic binge. [and I don't believe she's had issues with substance abuse]

Not even recommended for completists. This is bargain basement production with seemingly public domain ""street scene/beat music"" all over it. Pretty much trash and nothing much savory about it. The audio even sounds like mud. I've actually seen a better VHS transfer of this too!

Anyways, I regret buying this crud. Stay away from it. AND DONT HOLD YOUR BREATH FOR A CRITERION EDITION.",1489363200,,985,4.715116279069767

8556906,1,B00ARKYT3C,"The come-on is the cast:  Gina Lollobrigida, Susan Hampshire and Danielle Darrieux.  But the real ""star"" is a young male hustler - played by Renaud Verley.  Thus the title is misleading  --implying the film is about Lollobrigida's character.  I knew I had been ""had"" even before viewing when I read the back cover of the package and learned this film had been released in America for Drive-In theater audiences!  Everything about this 1976  film is reminiscent of a 1970's porno flick -- the acting, direction, dialogue, and film score are all pathetic and hilarious at the same time!",1398038400,5,584,4.8979591836734695
