8474513,3,B002TJPAVO,I saw a preview for this movie a long time ago and I wanted to see it really bad. I decided to purchase it and I don't regret the purchase but I would have rented it if I had the option. The movie is cute and sad in the fact that it shows holes in the legal system when it comes to the custody of children in the system.,1332633600,,320,3.652173913043478

Mark Webber was enjoyable to watch - I am not familiar with his work but would definitely check out his other projects at this point.
The 6 year old child lead was impressive as well except I don't see many real life six year olds so well behaved and able to express themselves so clearly. It was delightful to watch Mr. Webber's character ""become a man"" during their time together.

Daniel is the 20 year old sentenced to do community service at an elementary school where he meets Boone. They bond, Boone is sent off to ""an orphanage"" (I wasn't clear what happened to his mum) and Daniel decides to kidnap and drive him to his sister's out of state. (Not clear why the sister wasn't contacted more traditionally?)

It is about their relationship, Daniel growing, and Boone just being delightful. The time flew by while watching which is always a good sign.

It was a bit flawed (see comments above) but overall it was a fine watch. I would have preferred a more satisfying ending and perhaps closure with Boone's character - to know Daniel's ""kidnapping"" was worth it.

Rosie Perez's character (as school principal) was written and performed well. I also enjoyed Daniel's best friend portrayal by Brendan Sexton III (where only in film can the jobless petty criminials afford nice apartments in NYC).",1312329600,,1345,4.730769230769231

It is by far THE ""feel good"" movie of the decade that somehow never got noticed or picked up by major distributors. STRONGLY RECOMEND TO SEE IT!!!!",1265155200,,252,4.270833333333333
