7505239,4,B017HMM38K,Really sombering story in fact depressing but the message is so powerful that most humans can't comprehend. Mr. Hackett did good and people who watch this have to remember that he had to keep his raw emotion in check in doing such a harsh story or it could have serious consequences on his emotions (my 2 cents).,1461110400,,312,4.491228070175438

7505243,5,B017HMM38K,"for those giving bad reviews, you must not have been through some thangs. we as humans do blame God as the 1st line of questioning. That is normal as we all do that. The thing is to realize that God sends the trials and tribulations to see how faithful we are to His teachings. forgiveness is very hard, especially when the same hurt is done to you over and over again; by the one person you love more than life. I have been in the boat of the strange man and I asked God was it me, am I doing this marriage thing wrong, what do I need to do? He gave me the answers and it was not all me, it was my spouse and his lies and deceit. once I gave him to the Lord in serious prayer, his health started fading and Oct 26, 2010 he was told he had kidney failure. prior to that I warned him that I saw him in a hole that I couldn't get him out of; about 1.5 to 2 years later he was on dialysis, he has had his gallbladder removed, all his teeth pulled and wears dentures, blind in his right eye, erectile dysfunction, cannot pee but once a day due to kidney failure and he is stage 5. God don't like ugly and when you abuse a child of His unjustly, things happen. the pastor still had a job as a pastor to show His devotion to God and his religion. it is hard for me to forgive everything as even though we have been divorce since April 12, 2016 he is still doing wrong and not able to be a man for his own health and sense of mind.",1495929600,,1424,3.8801369863013697

I couldn't connect with the characters at all and never really felt their pain.

The man on the phone makes the parents do whatever he wants which leads to the mom killing herself to save her baby, then baby is killed anyway. The end is the pastor visiting the man in prison and forgiving him. There is supposed to be a moral here, of how ""people"" have acted in the same way as the man on the phone, but towards God, and how God still forgives us. I'm sorry, but the ending didn't in any way make up for the horror that came before.

7505248,1,B017HMM38K,"I watched this movie at the recommendation and urging of someone I know.  Part-way in, I felt I should turn it off, but I decided to try to give it the benefit of the doubt.  That said, I was very disturbed by this film.  Here is my list of issues about this film (spoiler alert):

1.  The producer obviously wanted to portray a message of forgiveness, but there really was NO gospel story in the entire movie. The gospel = the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ. A non-Christian who had never heard about Christ would most likely be left confused and wondering ""what was all that about""?  Actually, in reading through some of the other reviews on Amazon, it's obvious some people were truly clueless.

2.  The film had an extreme spirit of ""fear"" throughout the entire thing.  It was like watching a horror film with a psycho killer.  Some might say that the producer had to be extreme with the film to get his points across, but I strongly disagree.  You don't ""entertain"" people by showing a psychopath unfold his psychotic plan.  It's a kin to swimming through a sewer pit because you dropped a good biscuit in there and you're trying to find it.  There's absolutely NO doubt in my mind that the devil uses this kind of ""Christian entertainment"" to further desensitize people in to thinking it's ok to watch just because it has some seemingly good message in it.  Even the music was something out of a horror film - eerie at times and has a way, bad, wrong spirit.

3.  There is a scene where the wife tells the husband that someone has kidnapped their child.  She does not respond the way you'd expect, with hysteria.  However, a few scenes later, she shows more emotion when she find out the psycho caller has wiped their bank account.  This really bothered me on many levels.  Money is more important than your own son?

4.  I was VERY disturbed by how they portrayed Christians.  They portrayed a Pastor who's hooked on porn and never gets it right before God, but yet then continues his ""ministry"".  They portray a young, engaged couple as complete idiots.  When the caller makes the pastor admit that he's hooked on porn in front of the young couple, they LAUGH it off and then are heard saying ""that was awkward, yeah, it was probably just the Chinese food"".  It's almost like they tried to throw a ""funny"" scene right in the middle of a crisis scene.  This makes light of sin and it makes light of pornography and Christians in general.  This was NO laughing matter.  Side note:  it's not that I don't think a Pastor can't get caught up in some kind of sin, but what bothers me if that you never see this sin resolved.

5.  In one scene, the Pastor prays to God and tells God that he forgives the man, and says God forgives the man too for what he's done.  The caller never asked for forgiveness.  God just doesn't GRANT forgiveness automatically.  Yes, Jesus Christ died and paid for our sins, but that was just the payment.  You aren't forgiven until you ask and seek that forgiveness.  To say that God forgives him before he's sought it portrays a very skewed view of God and forgiveness!

6.  The movie credits actually say GOD himself is the producer.  Need I explain why this is wrong?

7.  The movie gives the idea that we all killed Jesus.  I understand where the writers are coming from, but let's compare this to Scripture.  The Bible says it pleased the Lord to bruise Him.  That he lay down his life for us, meaning he gave it willingly.  While it was our sins that he had to die for, he didn't die because we ""killed"" him.  He died because he was obedient to the Father, and he gave up his life so that we could become free men.  Killing someone, and giving up life willingly are two different things.  He could have called a legion of angels to help him get off that cross at any moment.  While the Roman soldiers may have carried out the killing, Jesus Christ WILLINGLY died.  That message is skewed in this film.

Overall, I think my main issue is that the storyline is quite evil and dark.  It's not necessary to show such psychotic thoughts and actions.  There are plenty of evil and dark things that happen on a daily basis, that to bring it into our living rooms as a form of ""entertainment"" or a ""witnessing tool"" is just plain wrong.

While the producer did a good job of having a paradigm shift in the story line, I feel that the movie should be critically looked at with a Biblical perspective, rather than a cinematic review.  Sure, I could go on about how bad the acting was, how cheesy all the close up face shots were, how they took too long with certain scenes (ie: him making breakfast), etc.  But that's not the real issue.  The real issue is that this movie has a weak Biblical message, and at times a quite skewed one.  All at the expense of further desensitizing people to blood, murder, gore, violence, etc.  It also portrays a WRONG message about forgiveness - that you don't even have to ask.",1492646400,3,4953,4.443826473859844

There was a decent scene about 45 minutes into the film when two people walked, (I should have taken the hint.) but other than that, watching a guy talk on the phone for over an hour, is what you are going to get.

I won't get into details; I simply can't see anyone entertaining the caller for that many hours in today's world. There were too many ways to stop the nonsense during the day. Poor writing can be overcome with strong acting. That did not happen here. The wife was borderline annoying. He lacked common sense and I can't even address the young couple in counseling. It truly felt like watching a quickly thrown together church anniversary or Easter play... this was just drawn out for far too long. I do believe it was drawn out to better connect the audience to the overall message. As with the writing, the acting could have been overcome with strong direction. This movie fell short on that as well. I had to break the movie up over three days to tolerate it. It could be a discussion piece for a church group or a group on forgiveness (if the participants are okay with faith based discussions). I REALLY wanted to like this movie but it just fell short.

The camera angels allowed the film to feel more like a high budget film.",1502496000,,357,4.774193548387097

8739300,5,B017HMM38K,"Great plot, great storyline. From the beginning it had me thinking he was the one in jail. To understand why he forgave you have to already have been forgiven. It was just as hard for the pastor to visit the guy, as much as it was hard for the guy to see the pastor after everything he had done. The pastor's message was, he was just as guilty as the guy in prison because of what we all have done to the Father's Son, Jesus Christ. We defamed his name, hurt people, and killed Christ. If the pastor was living the life he was supposed to be living, the things that happened most likely wouldn't have happened. It was a warning to all people. Christians, live the life you claim. Non believers, don't put your trust in man. At the end of the day all our actions effect each other and we will all be judged by God regardless.

Still forgive, because we want God to forgive us when we Sin.  ""and forgive us our debts,  as we forgive our debtors"" Matthew 6:12",1497484800,,244,4.5
8739302,1,B017HMM38K,Warning: please reconsider watching this movie.  At least read some of the 1-star reviews first.  Cannot believe this was on Pureflix.  Just because a movie uses Christian themes material doesn't make kidnapping and suicide ok.,1496793600,,227,5.428571428571429
