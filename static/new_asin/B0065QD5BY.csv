8493544,2,B0065QD5BY,"The content was relatively good, but the video and audio quality is very poor.  The audio of the interviews does not match the video, making it appear like a very badly dubbed movie.  I rowed with Bryan Volpenhein in college, so it was interesting for me to see him in this film.",1420588800,,279,4.346153846153846
8493545,5,B0065QD5BY,"""the WORST man in the boat has 2 gold medals"". Classic!",1407024000,,55,4.090909090909091
8493546,4,B0065QD5BY,"This is a very well-done documentary that really lets the subjects tell the story. It's almost painful to watch the team prepare with such well-earned confidence, knowing how it ends up. I thought the film-making was quite good (though low budget). Very restrained style and some interesting character development techniques. My only disappointment is the ending. Lewis jumps straight to the Olympic final, with no buildup or time spent capturing the atmosphere, what it's like to live in the village, and particularly huge a missed opportunity to build tension, since he doesn't show any of the heat, repechage, or semi races. Maybe there were other considerations, but the jump to the final seemed very abrupt to me. Still one of the better rowing movies out there.",1396828800,,767,5.095238095238095
8493547,5,B0065QD5BY,Wonderful book. Couldn't put it down.  Left me thinking. ...I love that about a book.  I Don't often recommend books. ... but this one I recommend with enthusiasm,1396483200,,162,4.75
8493548,1,B0065QD5BY,"Looks like it was shot with a cam-corder from 1984.  Awful!  Turned it off after 10 minutes.  Sound horrid!  Bad, bad, bad.",1388620800,,123,4.454545454545454
8493549,4,B0065QD5BY,Movie didn't sync with the words....people were talking before their mouths started to move! Really annoying! Tried to get in contact with Amazon about their Instant Video issues but no luck so I watched the rest. Great movie which is why I gave 4 stars!,1384905600,,254,4.666666666666667
8493550,2,B0065QD5BY,Poor quality sound. The voice did not match with the sound. Also the filming was not that great. I would not have paid $2.99 for it if I had know how poor quality it was.,1376524800,,170,3.8857142857142857
