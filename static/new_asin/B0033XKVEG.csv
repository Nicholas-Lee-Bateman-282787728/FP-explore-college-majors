4065718,4,B0033XKVEG,"The bad economy has hit the DVD market as well, and WB has shelved future plans for the Golden Collection series according to Looney Tunes expert Jerry Beck in a recent interview.  The reason these later titles are being collected is because they already have had some remastering done, so that saves some time and money.  While some of the selections may be on the mediocre side, there are some goodies here and in the upcoming Daffy collection as well.  Maybe if the market improves in the future we will see more of what we want, but in the meantime I'm glad that WB hasn't discontinued the Looney Tunes DVD's altogether.  I say buy these sets as soon as they come out, so the powers that be will know that we are still interested in future releases and keep our fingers crossed.",1276646400,24,782,4.485915492957746

4065738,3,B0033XKVEG,"Me-eh okay, I can see the legitimacy of people's gripe about most of these cartoons being wide-screen. It's pretty obvious where they cropped it and yes, it's a little annoying. But for myself, I enjoyed the cartoons enough that it really wasn't that big of an issue for me. That being said, the original ratio was much better and thank you WB for at least doing that for some of the cartoons included (which happened to be my favorite ones). The powers that be might want to check on volume control issues. I had to turn down the volume on several of them.

Overall, being that some of these cartoons are not available elsewhere, it is worth it to get this collection. I can tolerate the cropped images okay. As I continue to watch them, I might be changing my mind, though.",1387497600,4,775,4.457746478873239
4065739,4,B0033XKVEG,"I got this set since A) I love Looney Tunes, and grew up watching them on Saturday mornings, and B) so that my son could see them, and enjoy them as he grows up.  I hated how these have been censored in recent decades when rebroadcast on Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon, so I wanted my son to see them how I saw them, and judge for himself.  He loves all the other DVD sets of Looney Tunes that I have, and doesn't care about cropping one way or the other.  I watched the set expecting to see Bugs beheaded, having read some of the reviews here before i bought this set. I did look for the shots that several people complain were the most obvious crops, ok so they were cropped a bit.  This does not detract from their overall entertainment value to me and my son. I think they are a wonderful addition to anyone's Looney Tunes collection child or adult, since even though most of them are over 50 years old they are still better than a lot of the 'kids television' out there today (I'm looking at you Spongebob).  If the cropping is your sole issue, fine, whine to WB, but don't put off people who would buy this for their children or grandchildren because of a technical issue your average viewer won't notice. Some of you people are worse that Star Wars fan boys who whine about the prequels, sheesh.  Get over yourselves...",1361491200,3,1327,4.352226720647773
4065750,3,B0033XKVEG,"Cartoons older than 1953 were filmed in different aspects as to when they are put into widescreen, it will look a little odd. That is why Warner Bros used the fake widescreen matting. It is as simple as that. I have the majority of the shorts on other Looney Tunes releases, but they have a better video quality on this single disc than on the previous releases. These are cute cartoons for young kids to watch, but older fans probably already own these shorts. Overall, I enjoyed watching each one.

The shorts on the single disc are:

Mutiny on the Bunny
Bush Hare
Hare We Go
Foxy by Proxy
Hare Trimmed
Lumber Jack-Rabbit
Napoleon Bunny-Part
Bedevilled Rabbit
Apes of Wrath

These are not the finest Bugs Bunny cartoons ever made, but they are being presented correctly - if ""correctly"" means the way the filmmaker intended.

When I compared the full screen version to the wide screen version of the 2 I looked at, I noticed the wide versions actually have MORE information on the sides and the 1.33:1 versions have more information above and below. How is this possible? Are there more than one version of these cartoons? If so, Warners should have included both versions. There are some that appear cropped though. So the whole thing is a mess unless the studio would like to truthfully clarify what's happening here.

There were some classic stuff I was looking for too and got it. The problem here was the cropping to widescreen. Tops of heads were cutoff and it makes me wonder who was the editor that ruined these collections. Did anyone checkout the finished product?

4065761,1,B0033XKVEG,"Hmmm.  Let's take a journey in the way-back machine to those long-ago days of the late '90's, and remember when that wonderful new amazing invention, the Digital Versatile Disc, first appeared on the market...

Remember how excited everyone was to have their films finally available in an affordable digital format that (with proper care) would never degrade and would probably last them for all of their lives?  But the excitement quickly gave way to indignation and disappointment when it was found that the powers-that-be releasing these glorious ground-breaking inventions still clung to outmoded ways of the past when it came to the format they chose to release their films in.  Many, too many, films were released full-frame to ""fit"" the then standard for home viewing available to the majority of people, that is, the 1:33 ratio, cathode ray tube television.  No matter that this cropping eliminated major portions of the image, in many cases effecting the stories because characters and/or scenery was glaringly excised out of the viewable image.

So flash forward to the distant future of today, 2011...  Such problems are a thing of the silly past now due to the widespread availability of high-def, widescreen, televisions, right?  WRONG!  Seems there are just as many fools around today seeking to ""improve"" our home-viewing experience who feel they have the wisdom to mess with the original ratio of created works in order to ""improve"" them for the home-viewers, such as these moron at Warner Brothers who actually thought they were doing someone a favor by altering what were originally full-frame cartoons drawn and designed to be seen that way into cropped versions now desecrated in order to fill the image of all the widescreen televisions that are commonplace now.

Oh man, it is to laugh (a certain silly aquatic fowl might say), that is if I wasn't so ticked-off about this.  Who are these jagoffs who are now running the Home Video Dept. at Warner Brothers?  If it's not this, it's those over-priced Warner Archive releases they have the nerve to charge top dollar of $20 for and not even properly remaster or go to the trouble of including some extras (hell, or even subtitles or chapter stops).",1299974400,7,2218,4.997282608695652
4065762,1,B0033XKVEG,..But I won't because the cartoons are cropped.  Is Warner going to reissue this product or issue replacement discs?,1297728000,4,116,5.105263157894737
4065763,4,B0033XKVEG,"Having heard about all the complaints about this DVD's fake wide-screen matting, I initially had the idea to boycott this DVD as well as ""Daffy Duck: Frustrated Fowl"". I received it as a Christmas gift from my cousin who knew I loved old classics, and didn't know what to do with it. I decided to open it and watch it on my TV, and I realized that the widescreen matting wasn't such a big deal after all! I mean, at least the first five of the cartoons are in their proper screen format. In my opinion, the appearance of the wide-screen bars in the affected cartoons does more to detract from viewing than the artwork it obscures (which isn't much).

Besides, it doesn't cover up too much of the picture, only the upper and lower tenths of it. No big deal for me, except in ""Napoleon Bunny-Part""; there's a scene where, in the uncensored version, Bugs runs under a curved sign that reads ""Le Grand Ball Room"". But because of the fake matting effects, we only see ""Le Gra"". THAT's what bothers me.

So overall, I can't be TOO unhappy with this DVD. I mean after all, I have a special DVD player that can remove wide-screen bars from movies that are played on it which I use to watch this DVD. And besides, the restoration quality of these cartoons literally FASCINATES me! Still, I think it would be a good idea for Warner Home Video to recall this disc (and the Daffy Duck one), so that ALL cartoons are in their proper screen format. If they can fix that problem, then I will gladly give this 5 stars!

If you don't care too much about the minor cropping issue with most of this DVD's cartoons and LOVE watching professionally remastered cartoons, then buy this!",1297036800,,1663,4.445901639344262

I checked the back of the box and found the verbiage ""Standard version presented in a format preserving the aspect ratio of their original theatrical exhibition.""

I did a little research and apparently, in the mid-50s, the studio began formatting their cartoons so that they could be matted for theaters who wanted to show them in widescreen, which had become popular by then. They were still produced in the 4:3 aspect ratio though, so by showing them in widescreen, we are missing much of the original image.

I just hope that when they restored these, they restored the entire image. It would be a crime if the top and bottom were not touched in the restoration process because I doubt they'll ever go back to them for further restoration.",1286323200,8,993,4.734104046242774

4065782,3,B0033XKVEG,"These may not be the best Bugs cartoons, but some of them are favorites of mine, and they are new to DVD.  ""Hare Trimmed"" is one that I never had on tape or laserdisc (although I had a tape recorded from TV, back in the waning days of the Saturday morning Bugs Bunny-Road Runner Show).  ""Bedevilled Rabbit"" is a must-have, along with ""Mutiny on the Bunny"" and ""The Apes of Wrath.""  (So I'm a sucker for puns.)

Of the 15 cartoons, the first five are presented in their original format.  The bad news is that the other ten have been cropped to fit widescreen TVs.  I don't understand the reason for this.  These shorts were not filmed for widescreen, and when they were shown in theaters, they were shown flat.  (Yes, I'm old enough to remember seeing cartoons in theaters.)

I didn't know any of this when I bought the set; the packaging says ""Standard Version"", which usually means 4 x 3.  Amazon's information was doubtless based on that, but with all the reviews posted here, they must know about it by now.

It's puzzling to see Warner putting out such a shoddy release, especially when the earlier volumes of Looney Tunes were fully loaded with extras and meticulously presented.  The picture quality is excellent in this set, with bold, brilliant colors, but it's nonsensical to reformat them for widescreen.

What is more unsettling is that Warner Bros keeps doing this all over again, tampering with content (censorship, cropping...) showing no respect at all for intellectual property but most of all no respect whatsoever for the customer. It is disgusting.

The other reason I can't recommend this disk is that most of the cartoons aren't all that good, which is the reason most of them haven't been on video before.  By the end of the 1950s, Warners was cutting costs in the cartoon department, and these simply don't compare to the classic stuff from the 40s and early 50s.

Yet, with all the hype lately around other animated favorites like Spongebob Squarepants, and recently with The Penguins Of Madagascar going for so much joy for kids young and old, it is just too easy for many people to forget the originals that have made so many impacts on what animation was like nearly 70 or 80 yeras ago. For Bugs, it is a new chance for his greats to be recognized with a whole new era of fans alike. What's really up doc, it could be found here.

Bugs Bunny: Hare Extraordinare is the latest as part of the new Looney Tunes Superstars series, is a collection of 15 animated gems from the classic Looney Tunes library. The collection of cartoons is a great trip back to the past, and a great addition for anyone whom already owns all 6 volumes of the Looney Tunes: Golden Collection DVD sets. The compilation includes a lot of greats that have never before made it to DVD before including favorites like Napoleon Bunny-Parte, where Bugs travels to France by accident by making yet another wrong turn, and battling Napoleon in a game of funny wits, The Million Hare where Daffy Duck & Bugs find themselves contestants on a TV game show trying to battle on who is going to win a cross-country race to the studio for ""The Million Box,"" and favorites with Bugs battling the Tasmainian Devil of gems like Dr. Devil & Mr. Hare and Bedeviled Rabbit. The cartoons have all been remastered nicely, and are displayed in their original letterbox format, which was like the way they were when they debuted in the movie screens around 50 years ago. There aren't any extras unlike the Looney Tunes Golden Collection series had shown, but it is still worth the effort.

All in all, Bugs Bunny: Hare Extraordinare is a great buy for hard core Looney Tunes fans all these years, but not for anyone whom has not yet seen what wacky tales Bugs had been a part of for 70 years. For those as starters, I'd honestly recommend The Essential Bugs Bunny which is coming soon to DVD in a few months. What really should be up for Bugs, a great 70th birthday for all his fans, and anyone who loves that ""looney, tuney, wascally wabbit.""

These DVDs (the Bugs AND the Daffy one) are, simply put, defective products.  I returned both of mine to the store after discovering the formatting issue.  How this got through quality control is beyond me.  Warner Bros released a broken product to retail....I'd assumed it was an honest mistake but based on other information presented here it would appear that when called out on it they labeled it an artistic decision.  Ludicrous....these discs are as broken as if they'd shipped without sound.  If you're a fan of Looney Tunes buy the wonderful Golden Collections and hope that they get around to making more of those.....skip this set and the equally defective Daffy set.

Here's a hint WB, when you describe, truthfully, the picture formatting of your disc to a retail store clerk and they immediately offer you a full refund and an apology, something is not right.  When there is picture that was fully filmed/animated and is not being seen, something is not right.  These discs?  Not right.

4065807,1,B0033XKVEG,"The only reason that I will not be buying ""Bugs Bunny: Hare Extraordinaire,"" and the only reason for my 1-star rating, is because someone at Warner Bros decided to use matting to cover up the tops and bottoms of most of the cartoons on this DVD.

For example, in the original version of ""Napoleon Bunny-Part,"" Bugs Bunny walks under a doorway with a curved sign on top which says ""Le Grande Ball Room."" But on this DVD, the only part of the sign that can be seen is ""Le Gra.""

Warner Bros claims that their reason for doing this is because that's what the artists originally intended. I very much doubt this claim. Why would they draw a sign if they never intended for anyone to be able to read it? Furthermore, none of the cartoons on the six Looney Tunes Golden Collections are matted, and no one ever complained about the fact that those cartoons weren't matted.

I bought all six Golden Collections. But I will not be buying ""Hare Extraordinaire.""",1282089600,100,951,4.517441860465116

Hopefully if any more Super Stars DVD's come out (e.g. Foghorn Leghorn in November 2010) there won't be any issues.",1282003200,4,417,4.358974358974359

But, there is a serious flaw with this, and the Daffy Duck disc.  The aspect ratio is screwed up.  The first few cartoons are just find, presented in a proper ""pillar box"" format on a wide screen TV.  But then, at the end of Lumber Jack Rabbit, the cartoons are suddenly full screen, cropping the top and bottom of the image.  At first I thought I had a defective disc, but when both this and the Daffy disc showed the same problem, it suggested to me that WB has screwed up on the mastering of these discs.  And yes, it is a formatting error with the disc.  If you play the disc on an older 4:3 TV, the ones that are stretched on the wide screen sets are squished inward on the older style ones.  This is really sad becuase these are excellent cartoons, but I refuse to pay good money for a defective product.  I'll be returning my copies for a refund.  :(",1281916800,31,1066,4.306532663316583
4065820,1,B0033XKVEG,"When I learned about the cropping issue, I planned to stay away from this set, as well as the Daffy Duck Frustrated Fowl set. But because my son was expecting to see them, I bought them, anyway. We watched a bunch of them Saturday and all I can say is that the cropped picture on some of the cartoons looks lousy. It's ridiculous.

It's so ridiculous that, on some of the cartoons, you can't even see all of the information of the credits. And why Warner Bros. decided to crop ""Lumber Jack-Rabbit"" is beyond me. This cartoon obviously was not designed for a widescreen picture. For the opening credits, Warner had to use the 4:3 format to ensure all of the credit information was there. When the cartoon started, however, it transformed to widescreen and you could tell there was a lot of information missing from the picture.

Most of the widescreen cartoons in both sets are a mess. Tops of heads are missing, snippets of animation are gone, etc.

I'm extremely disappointed with this set. I know there are many people out there who will say this doesn't matter, but to some people it matters greatly. There was NO REASON to do this. NONE.

I will not buy any future Looney Tunes releases if this is how these cartoons are going to be treated. If somebody wants to watch these cartoons in widescreen, they could easily set their televisions to stretch-o-matic format or zoom in the picture. The way it is now, if somebody wants to see the full animated image, no such choice is available.

Whoever was behind the decision to do this is an absolute maroon. Yosemite Sam and Elmer Fudd aren't even that stupid.",1281830400,50,1610,4.576388888888889
4065821,2,B0033XKVEG,"Warner has done something here that they never did with the Golden Collection DVDs, they CROPPED the picture of the 1954+ cartoons to make them look widescreen. The animators at Warner Brothers NEVER animated for wide screen until the 1980 revival. There are jokes missing because they are in the upper or lower portions of the picture which are not there now. Maybe these were shown at the theaters this way, but I want to see them the way the animators intended us to see them.

I have already contacted the powers that be at Warner Home Video to request a re-call and issue a proper un-cropped DVD of these classic cartoons.

This would have NEVER happened in the Golden Collection sets. Someone who does not know better must be in charge now!

This will be the LAST Looney Tunes DVD that I buy if this is going to be the new standard. Keep the old un-cropped Laserdiscs, a TRAVESTY has been committed here!

Even as a kid I noticed that these later cartoons were designed for mild widescreen.  The most obvious point was in the opening titles as there was plenty of empty space above and below the titles when they were shown in full screen, thus begging for a matt.  I'll admit it takes a bit getting used to, but it's OK for me.  And of course, there's ""Bushy Hare"" which I have been waiting for years to see again!",1281744000,2,570,4.4

4065824,5,B0033XKVEG,"I don't agree with all the folks that say the early Bugs was the best. The mid to late 40's and into the 50's to me is where Bugs really found his groove. They were slick and very funny. I do have a very big question. Where in the world are all of the Foghorn Leghorn 'toons? Foggy and also that fox trying to steal the chickens are sorely missed from these collections. I had made a list of all the cartoons I wanted to get on DVD and to this point probably 50% have become available. Please Warner Brothers take a note from Disney and get on the ball. The world does not revolve around Mickey Mouse!!!! Lets give some back to us ""adult"" cartoon lovers.",1281657600,2,654,4.15748031496063
4065825,4,B0033XKVEG,"You see, the Looney Tunes post-1953 were animated in the same square, old fashioned TV shape that they always were, and it's in that form that we've seen them on TV all these years, but because widescreen was becoming the norm for movie theaters in the early '50s from that point on the toons were usually ""matted,"" or had a bit of the top and bottom of the frame cut off to fit the toon on the widescreen screen. The animaters knew this and tried to keep all the important visual info out of the parts of the picture that would probably be cut off.

Fast-forward to today: in an era of widescreen TVs being the norm the WB home video department decided to show these post-'53 shorts on this disc (there are ten)in their matted version, i.e. missing a bit of the top and the bottom of the picture that people have seen on decades on TV. The five cartoons on this disc from before '53 are presented in their full version and despite the cropping of the picture all of them have been remastered and look quite lovely.

So write your letters saying you want all further Looney Tunes DVDs in their proper aspect ratios... and then buy this release. Despite it's problems this is a very enjoyable DVD. Like I said, the cartoons that were matted were planned to be matted so you won't miss anything but the very tops of some hats and the tops of Marvin the Martian's bristles in a few scenes and that doesn't really interfere with your enjoyment of the shorts.

I didn't see a lot of these as a kid, so most of these were new to me. There are a couple of stinkers, most from late in the Looney Tune era when the creativity was winding down, but there were far more pleasant suprises. The two best cartoons on this DVD (IMO) are Hare Trimmed, which features Granny as an old widow who Yosemite Sam is trying to woo (and swindle) with Bugs disguising himself as a rival suitor to stop him and Napoleon Bunny-Part which has Bugs run afoul of, well, you can guess from the title. Hare We Go and From Hare to Heir are great too, and I have a soft spot for Lighter Than Hare, an odd later (1960) cartoon which features Sam as an an alien trying to capture Bugs and take him to his home planet. In this short Bugs' home is a junkyard and the wascally wabbit has technical know-how enabling him to build devices out of junk that he uses to thwart Sam.

So, the one star I ducked was for the missing bits of the picture, but I enjoyed it far too much to not give it at least four.",1281657600,8,2465,4.249466950959488
4065826,1,B0033XKVEG,"Warners really dropped the ball with this release.  And I'm not talking about the cartoon selection, as a great many of them are lackluster to downright terrible.

I'm very disgusted with the ""widescreen"" presentation of most of the cartoons on what could have been a decent compilation of cartoons never-before on DVD.  The statement of ""well, they were screened in theaters like this""/""they designed them for widescreen"" argument is disingenuous at best, disregarding that not all theaters showed the cartoons matted. How anyone can watch these abominations thinking that Chuck Jones, Friz Freleng, and Bob McKimson intended for the cartoons to have chunks of animation cut off is beyond me.  Let me add too that a great number of pre-1953 Warner cartoons were reissued to theaters well into the late 1960s.  And those were matted too.  There was no art or method to this whatsoever.  They only formatted the titles to work in widescreen because they needed to have all the copyright and credit information in the picture by law.  Why does nobody seem to understand this?

I won't let this bother me much.  The cartoons were restored full-frame, but Warner Home Video stupidly chose to cater to the Blu-Ray/plasma screen whores who stretch the picture for widescreen no matter what.  I'm certain they'll be released properly in future Looney Tunes box sets.  But in good conscience I can _not_ recommend this release to anyone, unless you must own restored versions of the first five cartoons, which coincidentally include two of my very favorite Freleng Bugs shorts, ""Hare Trimmed"" and ""Foxy By Proxy"".  Keep in mind too that these releases also are _not_ a continuation of the Golden Collection series in any shape or form.  Stay tuned, folks!",1281484800,23,1747,5.020833333333333
4065827,1,B0033XKVEG,"Agreed that this is a MUCH less desirable presentation. I understand that economics have made it unfeasible to continue the Golden series at retail, but what about on-demand or limited mail-order only releases? This historical body of work is now shamefully incomplete as regards access not only for fans, but historians, film scholars, etc. There has to be a creative way to make it available legally... otherwise, I'm sure an enterprising bootlegger out there will be selling it on the internet. It would be great to see WB head that off.",1281484800,8,540,4.945054945054945
4065828,4,B0033XKVEG,"There has been much discussion here and at the corresponding Daffy Duck DVD release on this question.  I offer the following simply as food for thought and, perhaps, to continue the discussion.  Ultimately, of course, it comes down to a matter of individual taste.

In his 1994 book ""The 50 Greatest Cartoons,"" Jerry Beck polled over a thousand animation professionals and historians, asking them to rate their favorite cartoons from 1 - 50. When all the votes were tallied, 17 Warner Brother cartoons made the top 50.  At the end of the book, an additional 53 cartoons were listed as a sort of honorable mention, having just missed the top 50 by a vote or two.  Seventeen more WB cartoons made this honorable mention list.  Of those 34 Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies that made the book, 24 were released prior to 1950.  However, the 17 that made the top 50 showed a more even split: eight pre-1950 and nine post-1950.  Further, of the five top ranked cartoons in the poll, four of them were post-1950 Warner Brothers releases.  Considering specifically Bugs Bunny cartoons, a total of seven made the top 50.  Of those, five were post 1950, including numbers 1 & 2.  On the other hand, of the 10 Bugs cartoons listed in the honorable mention category, nine were pre-1950 releases.

What conclusions may be drawn?  At least for those who contributed to Jerry Beck's book, the 1950s era Looney Tunes were more represented at the very top of the list -the best of the best, if you will.  But the further you went down the list, the more likely you would find releases from the 30s and 40s, about 70% of all the Warner Brothers cartoons making the survey.

Beck came out with a similar type of book just last month, ""The 100 Greatest Looney Tunes.""  This time he extended his poll beyond those who work in the animation field, opening it up to fans that frequent his website.  The results again show an overall preference for the pre-1950 releases by a 60 - 40 margin.  This consistency extended to the 35 Bugs Bunny's that made the list as well, with 23 coming from the pre-1950 era.  (Beck decided not to rank the cartoons in this book but rather to simply list them in alphabetical order.)

I don't believe any of the titles on the present DVD made the list of either book, though two cartoons - ""Bushy Hare"" and ""Hare Trimmed"" - were cited as being among the 58 best Bugs Bunny's by Steven Schneider, author of the book length tribute to Warner Brothers animation ""That's All Folks.""  There are also a couple of other titles on this DVD that are interesting for historical purposes. ""Jack Rabbit Bunny"" is the only Warner Brothers cartoon to have been shot in 3-D, and ""False Hare"" was the last Bugs Bunny theatrical cartoon release, not counting the compilations and later features that began to appear in the 1980s.

I am not suggesting that this DVD represents anything like the greatest of Bugs Bunny.  In my opinion, there is an overrepresentation of the 1960s while there are still earlier gems that have yet to appear on DVD. Nevertheless, for my money, there is enough here to make a purchase worthwhile. If, as a consequence, it helps to spur future releases of Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies, so much the better.",1280016000,11,3218,4.656637168141593
4065829,4,B0033XKVEG,"I agree with the other reviewers lamenting the lack of pre-1950 cartoons. However, as none of these cartoons have appeared on previous collections, I think it's good that at the very least, WB isn't asking us to buy the same thing again. And again! (Look! Finally! A collection WITHOUT ""Baton Bunny!"" That's cause for celebration right there!)

That said, some things I'm looking forward to about this collection:

1) Yosemite Sam and Tasmanian Devil are all over this collection. All of the pre-1950 YS cartoons are on previous collections, and Taz didn't come along until the mid-50's. I, for one, am thankful to have all of them in one collection. (""From Hare to Heir"" is the one where Sam has to be nice or forfeit 1,000,000 pounds; tell me you don't giggle remembering Sam crashing down the stairs in the knight-suit after taking a swing at Bugs!)

2) Some of those later-era cartoons may be funnier than you remember. ""The Million Hare"" from 1963 is the one with Bugs and Daffy racing to the TV studio to win a million bucks. (""I wonder if that silly duck will remember he can fly?"" {{{CRASH}}} ""Guess not."") ""Lighter than Hare"" is the one where Sam is a space alien.

(All of that said, I recognize that this has the potential to be another case of ""Wow, that wasn't as funny as I remember it."" This is what keeps me from giving it five stars. For now.)

3) ""Bushy Hare."" Has that been on any collection EVER? DVD or VHS?

All I know is I'm eagerly awaiting August 10, when I can hopefully add the fifth star! Hopefully, this will be the beginning of a series of discs showcasing characters or eras or themes that haven't been touched on in previous issues.",1277596800,20,1664,4.548494983277592

8388140,3,B0033XKVEG,"Warner Bros put out these Looney Tunes Super Stars DVDs after they stopped putting out the 4-DVD Golden Collections (the 6th set was the last). The Super Stars DVDs focused on specific characters (Bugs, Daffy, Foghorn Leghorn, etc.) but got mixed reviews because some used cropped images (as this one does) and some repeated cartoons that were already on the Golden Collections, etc. Overall, fans are not too happy with these.

I'd previously picked up the Daffy and Foghorn Leghorn Super Stars DVDs rather cheaply and thought they were good... I did not notice any cropping, the remastered image was very good and clean, the cartoon selections were all very good indeed and none (or only 1-2, if any) were repeated from the Golden Collection sets. So, despite the warnings of others on the net, I picked this one up via Amazon, paying more than I did for the other two.

As much as I like the cartoon selections and clear image of this Bugs collection, it's obvious the images have been cropped. I notice it and it bothers me. So, while I hope Warner Brothers rectifies this soon, I also hate the thought of paying twice for the same product.
