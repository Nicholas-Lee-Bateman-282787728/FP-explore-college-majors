I've always been curious about it, but unfortunately, it's been virtually unknown here in the US.  When I saw the DVD on Amazon, I ordered it at once.  (It arrived quickly, and the print-quality is excellent!)
Let me say right up front that, just like Marilyn Monroe, I've always thought that Diana was very underrated as an actress.  This film proved my point - just as ""Bus Stop"" and ""The Misfits"" did with Marilyn - that, given the chance, Diana Dors was more than another brainless blonde bombshell.  ""Yield To The Night"" is slow-moving, but mesmerizing, and Diana's performance as the condemned murderess is electrifying!
Contrasting the prison scenes where she's shown with absolutely no makeup, dark roots growing in on her carelessly ponytailed hair, to the scenes done in flashback where we see the glamorous platinum blonde Diana, it's a bit of a jolt to remember that this was 1956 - this kind of thing was not commonly done in Hollywood films in those days -(Susan Hayward in 1958's ""I Want To Live"", looked like she had just come from the beauty-parlor, even as she walked towards the gas chamber!)
Diana's characterization rings true from beginning to end - the tension increases as the execution approaches, and the claustrophobic atmosphere is nearly palpable...an amazing performance from an amazing actress!",1333843200,,1540,4.844106463878327
8234773,4,B000Z63Z5Q,"Before the movie's opening credits begin, the film opens with a blonde (Diana Dors) shooting a woman (Mercia Shaw) in cold blood several times in front of her home. The rest of the film is devoted to the monotonous day to day existence awaiting her execution while she recollects her past and the events leading up to the murder. If the film seems tedious and slow moving at times, it's just being real and eschewing the melodramatic cliches of prison movies. Dors' character is hard to read. She doesn't seem to have any remorse over her murder yet she's not a brazen, cold blooded killer either which makes it more difficult to condemn her but we can't quite shed any tears over her either. For those who only know Dors as a blonde bombshell, Britain's answer to Marilyn Monroe, her performance is a revelation and a pity that she didn't get more roles that taxed her as an actress. This was her last English film before she left to conquer Hollywood which emphasized her sex symbol status rather than her talents as an actress. Directed by J. Lee Thompson (GUNS OF NAVARONE) and based on the book by Joan Henry who also co-wrote the screenplay. With Michael Craig as Dors' lover and the reason for her fall, Yvonne Mitchell as a sympathetic prison matron, Geoffrey Keen, Marjorie Rhodes, Mona Washbourne, Athene Seyler, Dandy Nichols and Marianne Stone.

The Optimum DVD from Great Britian is a decent transfer in a full frame 1.33 aspect ratio.",1328054400,2,1448,4.700787401574803
8234774,4,B000Z63Z5Q,"This was a very good movie with Diana Dors. She gave a great performance  and  dominated the film, but I much preferred ""The  Long  Haul"".  I guess the subject matter of a woman imprisoned for murder awaiting execution left me a little cold.  I found  it  reminiscent  of  ""I want to live"" and ""Dance with a Stranger"".  Too bad she didn`t cut more record albums like ""Swingin` Dors"" which I feel is a masterpiece.  I recently saw a clip of her with Bob Hope from UTUBE when she was in her voluptous prime  and also saw Hitchcock`s ""The Sorcer`s Apprentice"". ""Children of the Full Moon"" showed a much older Diana minus the old glamour.  Alas, only those who die young retain their youthful image  It is only available as an import which I purchased from Amazon.",1311724800,2,760,4.485294117647059
8234775,5,B000Z63Z5Q,"It seems strange no one has reviewed this great film. J. Lee Thompson directed based on Joan Henry's book about Mary Hilton and the agony she feels while awaiting her execution in prison for murder. Flashbacks reveal her musician/boyfriend's affair with another woman who promised him phoney career advantages but rejected his love to marry a wealthier man. That caused him to commit suicide, thus provoking Hilton's furious gunfire crime of passion. Rumored to be based on the story of the last woman in Britain to be executed by hanging, the book and film came out some time before that happened. Thompson somehow convinces us in some sharply edited scenes that even the most unrepentent killers don't deserve to be sentenced to die.  Movie is also available in a boxed set, The Diana Dors Icon Collection.",1263168000,2,808,4.9411764705882355
