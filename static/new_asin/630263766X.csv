7829128,5,630263766X,"My kids absolutely LOVE this movie!! I agree with the other person who said they should re-release it. I would love it on DVD. Even a remake would be fabulous. If your kids love music, they will love this video.",1222992000,,211,4.3
7829129,5,630263766X,"Well, what can I say. This tape is aimed at a very young audience. When they were [...], my grandkids loved it. The songs have catchy tunes and the lyrics both entertain and teach. There's something here for everyone. Give 'em a try.

Dan Crow: ""Oops"" -- a song for all clumsy people. ""Kiss a Cow"" - well, what can you say to that?

Chic Street Man: ""Everybody Be Your Self"" -- tap along to a Caribbean beat while learning the world has room for all kinds of different people and it's okay to be who you are. ""Follow, Follow Me"" -- sing along, clap along, interactive fun.

Lori Lieberman: ""Monster Man"" -- a sensitive story about a scary monster sung and strummed by the personable Lori, oh gosh, oh gee.

Janet & Judy: ""ABC"" -- the alphabet song pepped up. ""Fruits & Vegetables"" -- like you've never, ever seen them before. ""Thank A Plant"" -- a fun song with a message.

Yes, this is all silly but it's silly and happy and fun. Try it. ""They are so good for you. Ah!""

This is not a flashy maniacal thrill ride. It's a gentle fun time singing together. The grandkids still love it but they watch mostly DVDs now. Some studio would do well to pick this one up and release it on DVD.

Janet & Judy fans will be happy to know they do have their own self-titled website with good, clean fun!",1125446400,,1289,4.258196721311475

There is little participation by the kids.  My 16 mo. old daughter banged on the TV yelling ""baby?  baby?"" wondering when I was going to put one of her videos on.  ""If were a bird, I'd fly to the store"" to return this video.",1014422400,2,366,4.388059701492537
