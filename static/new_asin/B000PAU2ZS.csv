2814993,5,B000PAU2ZS,"I like the ""Egoscue:Pain Free Workout"" very much. It is one of the best workouts I've tried over the years; it leaves my body not only pain free, but feeling stronger!",1189209600,13,167,4.419354838709677
2814994,5,B000PAU2ZS,"I only wish I started this program earlier. I spent almost a year doing PT, visiting orthopedic surgeons/sport medicine specialists, and going through massages, acupuncture, and chiropractors. It was all palliative. This is eliminating my shoulder and hip pain, addressing the etiology. I am a medical professional with very physically demanding, ergonomically- stressful job. I was also exercising and doing yoga a lot.

2814997,3,B000PAU2ZS,"The concept that pain comes from misalignment seems very reasonable.  However i exacerbated my chronic neck pain so badly using this DVD that I could  not continue.  I found the music irritating as it looped, and the set very barebone and dated.  In the closet, back to yoga",1504396800,,274,4.645833333333333

2815002,4,B000PAU2ZS,"I am an athlete with functional scoliosis so improving my body alignment is a high priority. After trying a myriad of things, I thought I'd give this a go. After using the first DVD a few times, I have hope with with regular use, this will help. This is not a glossy, fancy production. It's no nonsense, clear instruction with decent form pointers. Just what anyone serious about working on improving their functionality needs. After using it once, my upper back and hips were much looser.  I think that for $20, it's a good investment, especially since you get two DVDs.",1483315200,5,571,4.653465346534653
2815003,5,B000PAU2ZS,We can't believe how much better we feel after doing the exercises. I used to wake up feeling like I've been hit by a truck and I don't anymore.  We noticed a difference after the first time doing them.,1480723200,4,202,4.17948717948718

2815006,3,B000PAU2ZS,"The beginner workout is pretty good--very relaxing and great stretching. My husband timed each of the exercises and noticed that they are held unevenly on each side--for example, a supposedly 1-minute stretch might last 2 min 30 sec on the right side while it's explained and 1 min 20 sec on the left side. Still, they go quickly and I feel refreshed afterwards.

After a few weeks at the beginner level, we tried the advanced workout--and it is definitely advanced. I think I would have hurt myself if I'd pushed myself to complete the exercises. Why no intermediate?

And I agree with others--at $19.99, these workouts feel a little faded and dated.",1471305600,11,651,4.803571428571429

2815016,4,B000PAU2ZS,"With 110 reviews (right now) this review might get lost in the shuffle, but I gave it 4 stars hoping that it doesn't.  After messing up my back bad enough to have to go to the Chiropractor, I decided to take matters into my own hands and purchase this DVD in order to strengthen my back (the exercises/stretches have been very helpful with an occasional hip pain I've also suffered from).  I have appreciated Volume I of Egoscue to such an extent that whenever a family member or friend would complain about having back problems, I would order and send them one of these DVDs.  Someone else mentioned about the danger of doing the free crunches with the lifted legs, I'm not giving up this DVD just because of that!! Listen to your body; make the necessary adjustments.  On the bird dog -he clearly tells his assistant that you shouldn't over arch as they're demonstrating the exercise. I LOVE EGOSCUE and like someone else commented, would love to see a DVD that follows the exercises in the book, as well.",1436227200,22,1007,4.5777777777777775

2815019,2,B000PAU2ZS,"I had found a couple of 40 minute, Egoscue stretching workouts on Youtube so bought this DVD hoping it would be more of the same. Unfortunately it was EXACTLY the same as the videos on Youtube. The marketing is a little misleading, it says it's a 2 DVD set which to me, implies there will be more than just one workout on each disc. The disc packaging and the sales blurb do not  say anything at all about how many workouts there are either.
Not sure if it was my disc but it had a 19 minute workout on the first one, which then cut out abruptly mid exercise, then went onto to the full version of the same set of exercises. Overall very poor quality and I paid $18 for it!!!

Would not recommend anybody buying this when you can get the contents of both discs for free on Youtube.",1432857600,13,781,4.1655629139072845

The beginner workout is my favorite, but I sometimes include a little from the advanced dvd.  I have recommended this dvd to many of my friends.",1427328000,3,298,4.462962962962963
2815026,5,B000PAU2ZS,Excellent workout. Low impact. I am able to perform the beginner's even when I am feeling tired at the end of a long day. I needed to stop the video and replay some of the exercises at first to understand the correct approach. Recently I performed the workout after several hours of gardening. I wanted to see if it would make a difference in my back pain level as I typically have some pain after gardening.  I was amazed at how well I felt after the workout and my pain was reduced even the next day.,1427241600,3,502,4.229166666666667
2815027,5,B000PAU2ZS,"In constant excruciating pain (on a pain scale of 0-10, I was always 7-8) , it took more than a year before I could do more than the first (""elementary"") disc. Sciatic in right leg, carpal tunnel in left arm. However, now I can stand and shop and drive the car at pain 0-2 in the leg, rarely any pain in the arm. I worked up to doing the static poses for 2 minutes, much longer than on the DVD. It is also extremely important to identify everything in your life that aggravates the pain, and that can take awhile. I had to give my beautiful couch away, only use chairs with good lumbar support, stop much of the outdoor work, never walk barefoot (every shoe has a thick pad), never lean my head on my hands, and be ever-mindful of keeping the proper curve in my lower (L4-L5) back. The last is absolutely essential--yoga that put my back in the wrong direction, over a lifetime, was part of the problem also. I bought the Egoscue book as well, but the DVD is much better. I might even start my daily walks again soon... Good Luck!",1425513600,4,1030,4.260204081632653

You WILL be amazed, don't trust me, just follow for three days straight and you'll know what I'm talking about.  The flexibility you will feel is amazing!  Yes I did this stretch program for the recommended three months, after that your body will let you know when it's needed, it will crave the stretches.  I purchased the book on Amazon but purchased the DVD thru Walmart online & they shipped to my local store for $10. total.",1423958400,18,509,4.440860215053763

2815030,5,B000PAU2ZS,I've been doing these exercises for six weeks. The pain I'd been experiencing in my hips has greatly diminished. I have regained range of motion that I didn't even realize that I had lost. I highly recommend this workout series.,1421625600,2,228,4.725

2815032,4,B000PAU2ZS,I have had great success with volume  1 and am moving into vol 2. Unfortunately the female instructor as good as she is does not know her right from her left which can be confusing when you are taking verbal queues. It also diminishes the validity a bit if you let it. Strange how this got by. Other than that...outstanding!,1419984000,,324,4.4
2815033,5,B000PAU2ZS,"I discovered this exercise program through my violin teacher, and it allowed me to regain strength and balance that even physical therapy couldn't after hip surgery. The beginning level is possible for just about anyone, and you feel good afterwards, not exhausted.  Once you experience the stretching and realignment of these exercises, you will want to do them every day.  Beginning and more challenging levels are available.  All of the exercises are based on body anatomy and protecting against injury.  I recently had to have a hip revision surgery, and this program is part of my recovery and rebalancing my body.  Highly recommended!",1419811200,5,640,5.174757281553398
2815034,4,B000PAU2ZS,I don't know about pain free but I sure do like the stretches.  I enjoy the DVD and sometimes when I only have a few minutes and my muscles seem really tight I  will just pick 2-3 stretches from the DVD to do.  It really help loosens up my back.,1419120000,3,245,3.86

2815036,5,B000PAU2ZS,I had been going to the chiropractor  and  I felt I was getting worse when the physical therapy was added. I decided to try the exercises on the beginners and they really helped. Got my husband to do them and his back improved. After I thought I was really doing well I tried the advanced because I always have moved up to advance on all of my exercise videos. The advance caused my back pain to return so I went back to the beginners and included my Winsor Pilates Accelerated Body Sculpting video and my back has been great. Fired the Chiropractor and when I feel I need it I go in for some deep tissue massage (not for the faint of heart). I would buy it again just for the beginners video,1418342400,,692,4.195488721804511

The explanations and demonstrations are very good.  The second tape is more difficult and I haven't done that one as much.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to increase range of motion and feel aligned.

2815048,1,B000PAU2ZS,"I was excited to finally review these videos however in Vol 1 I was disappointed to see the instruction for bird dog being taught with excessive arching of the spine into lordosis, this is incorrect. One should sweep the leg back and NOT promote lordosis which will injure the LS junction and L5 disc. Additionally we see crunches with the legs raised up in the air, another good way to herniate your spinal discs. This information is dated and not current with what we know about back pain. I suggest no investigating these DVDs an would recommend investigating Stuart McGill and his progressive research on proper pain free exercise. -Dr. SS",1399766400,10,643,4.801801801801802

I have not gone a day without back pain for several years, have to be very careful how I walk and what type of chair I sit in. After doing the workouts daily for a couple of weeks, I'm not yet totally pain-free, but I'm really, really close! Your experience might differ from mine depending upon your back issues. My husband cannot do all of the exercises; his back issues are different from mine. That said, I highly recommend these exercises!! This DVD would be of better quality if the trainers counted for real. They say one thing and then do another as far as time or repetition. And the workout with only the music is just that--the same mis-counting but without the instructional talking.",1399248000,2,788,4.556338028169014

With the help of the egoscue method, the back pain is gone.  Developed a bit of a shoulder problem.  With focused exercises for the rotator cuff, pain is gone.

You could watch and to the exercises without the audio, once you get the hang of the exercises. I""ve only used the first set of beginner exercises. I had used the egoscue books off and on for years but really wanted to see what the exercises look like and have guidance to make sure I was doing them correctly.

This DVD provides that. I look forward to trying the advanced exercises over time. While the DVD does not contain all of the exercise from Pete's Pain Free book, it does contain enough to start the healing process and improve flexibility, strength, and mobility.

After 4 times I graduated myself to the advanced program and it is where things started changing for the best for me. I injured my upper back in a sledding accident 10 months ago. With the help of chiropractic, massage therapy, supplementation and exercises I was 90% better. The 10% remaining worried me as I didn't want to develop arthritis in the area. I was away for the last 3 days and didn't do my Egoscue program. I was on my bicycle (we live in Florida) this morning and realized I had absolutely NO pain at all in my mid back!

I tend to slump in my posture and my knees have started to bother me.  In the book I learned that I was Knock-kneed and that my lack of alignment in my posture and body use was causing me pain.  I have no discomfort now (I do the exercises daily), I'm standing up straight, naturally, and my neck and shoulder tightness is reduced by 85% - that happened after only one go through.  Also, my stomach is flattening after only 4 repetitions of doing the video.  I'd call this DVD preventative and curative, for people who have not injured themselves.

My only caution for beginners is that if you have had surgery on your knees or shoulders, or have known damage to your joints, you should probably arrange for a Skype consult from Egoscue.com for a personalized view on what you can do.  Misalignment is what set-up the current issue in your joints which will need to be addressed whether you get surgery or not, but personalized service is called for, I think, before you do a video like this.  For me, I had warning pain to alert me that I needed help and found this book and video.

2815081,4,B000PAU2ZS,"I started using this tape mostly because it had a great flow, went fast and augmented my morning cardio with ab work and stretching.  BUT, suddenly and out of the blue, I developed an excruciating case frozen shoulder.  It is disabling and prevents me from doing my normal day to day. Spin classes and weight classes out the door.  Dr's., shots and PT's in the door.  And then I had to travel for 5 months for work, so I was never home to attend to this problem.  So I started do the Egoscue beginners (I used to be able to do the advanced).  Right from the get-go, my shoulder felt better after the routine and it's been improving. I've been doing this every day for 4 weeks, and I am starting to see a noticeable range of motion improvement in my shoulder and I'm in a lot less pain.

Here's the thing.  What I know from years of exercise and fitness, is that this is a well designed program to essentially align your body with a teeny bit of strength training thrown in.  If you can't do 2 sets of 50 abs, do 2 sets of 10 or 5 or whatever you can.  Do the best you can.  The aligning of the body is essential to my recovery.  I am completely aware now of how much compensation movement my body is doing to work around my frozen shoulder.  My hips go up at the wrong time, my body turns when it shouldn't and my shoulder goes in odd directions at times.  Doing this program helps get things put back - even for only for a short while.  But it's working and for the foreseeable future, I plan to do this every morning.  Once the shoulder issue is remediated, I'll be doing this routine 3-4 days a week for a long while for the foreseeable future.

Do note that I agree with others, the quality of the recording stinks. I've laughed out loud at the gaffes that should have been edited out.  But I've gotten used to it, so now I can ignore them

I've got the book, but somehow have never been able to get through it.  Maybe I'll reread the section on shoulders again tonight.

2815083,4,B000PAU2ZS,"I'm an Irish step dance instructor, so I'm writing this as a fairly fit individual; I'm also a certified personal trainer. I bought this hoping it would make getting through the book's exercises easier. It is not the book in DVD form, although it does cover some exercies from the book. In general, I think it's a sound program but, despite the informational skew, it offers no real caveats for individuals with back, knee, or shoulder problems. If you have a serious back problem, I'd take it easy with this program. Here's what I found:

*The beginner program has some surprising challenges (100 crunches, anyone?). A male instructor ""guides"" a female co-instructor through the exercise series. He (mainly) explains what is being worked, and what you might feel. She will occasionally ask if she should relax, or feel tension, or might say ""the big mistake here is to do x, do y instead"". No suggestions of what to do if you feel pain or discomfort with certain moves, or how to modify anything, which is unfortunate. [The lunge, for expample, was not good on my three-surgery knee; you could put a pillow under the knee to remedy this.] I found their dialogue occasionally clumsy, and there were obvious gaffes that weren't edited out. I tried the ""no voiceover"" track and found the music extremely annoying and the transitional cues only indicate when to start the next exercise, not when to shift from the right side to the left side (which pertains to about half the progrm!), so it's rather a waste.

*The advanced program is not very advanced for anyone with much experience doing exercise dvds. It's just the female instructor, who is pleasant enough, and it's an improvement over the beginner setup. Many of the exercises are crossovers from the beginner tape, and some new ones are not really more difficult, just different. There are level changes and head-down positions that are something to beware of for people with high blood pressure. If you treat the program as a more meditational kind of affair, you'll be happier than if you expect this to be an energizing or make-you-sweat workout. I haven't tried this without the voice track, since I expected the same issues from the beginner program would carry over.

There is a lot of good in these programs. One big flaw is poor production values, which others have mentioned, and for many this will make repeated viewing more tedious. The main menu graphic is so low resolution it looks like something your kid nephew made. While you don't need a slick set like a Firm or Kathy Smith video, this rather looks like it was filmed in someone's nice basement. The soundtrack is indy folky-rocky guitar [the vocal, mercifully, is only at the main menu and credits]. You either like it or you don't. I very much like the suggestion made by another reviewer that you memorize/write down the exercises and perform them to your own music, or none at all. Problem is, many stretches are timed, so it's nice to have the video where someone does the timing for you (although I wish they had someone counting for them, because their reptitions are not always accurate, and as a dance teacher, I can count!). I think they rather don't put themselves in the same category as the popular mass-market exercise tapes, but with just a little better planning they could have avoided some silly problems many of these pros have long since learned to eliminate. At a certain point, a tape has to be fun, or at least not set your teeth on edge, to bear repeating playing, which is what they're trying to get you to do.",1327190400,13,3560,4.729468599033816

2815086,5,B000PAU2ZS,"I was hesitant about trying this because I didn't see any reviews from clients with Fibromyalgia or Chronic Fatigue symptoms, and I wasn't sure if this would work since so much of my pain is amplified. I'm writing this review because I wanted to do my part to make 100% sure that noone else suffering like I am missed out. First of all, just to be clear, this is not a miraculous too good to be true overnight cure. That being said, it is DEFINITELY working!

My story. If you can relate to any of this in any way, you owe it to yourself to try these dvds!
I've been all but housebound with severe totally disabling Fibro/Myofascial Pain/CFS/Sleep disorders for more than 6 years now, since I was 29 years old. I've tried just about everything (more than 20 mild workout plans and physical therapy, about 40 different prescription drugs including narcotic pain killers, electronic medicine such as rife machines, Bi-Pap device for sleep, and every vitamin supplement and natural medicine aid under the sun) and been disappointed time and time again when my symptoms didn't improve. ANY physical activity, even things as mild as aquatic therapy, yoga and tai chi, caused me so much pain and such severe exhaustion that it was all but impossible for me to endure, and took days to recover. Even something as simple as washing hair in shower has been a real struggle. But I also knew that restricting my movement was seriously exacerbating my condition. I was basically just stuck... not able to move, but also knowing that I couldn't endure living virtually flat on my back indefinitely. I was just absolutely desperate, in other words, and living every day at an unrelenting 7 on the pain scale was killing me slowly.

I got these dvds, plus the Pain Free book by Egoscue, because I'm basically willing to try anything at this point, but not having much confidence that they would be any more effective than the slew of other things I've tried and discarded. I was actually scared to do the workout the first time, as I knew from experience that I'd be causing myself a huge amount of pain. Yep. It hurt the first time. I was definitely pushing myself to get through the beginner series of e-cises, and for about 15 minutes after I was done, I was hurting in a big way. Then something unexpected happened. I started to feel a little better! I don't know how or why, because honestly, these stretches and movements don't seem that much different than a ton of other mild workouts that I've tried. But they absolutely are. This WORKS! I'm baffled by how it works so much better than seemingly similar types of activity, but it does. I'm still very new to the Egoscue Method. I've been through it 4x now, and am forcing myself to do it every day, no matter what. Every single time I go through the stretches, I feel a little better. Its not just my pain symptoms that are improving, either. My energy levels are on the rise. I'm sleeping better. And let me tell ya, when NOTHING has worked, and then something gives you a glimmer of hope, you start to feel much more positive and hopeful about everything in your world. And the cost of this hope? $20. If you're suffering, try this! I can't see the future, so no idea how much overall improvement this method will bring me, but so far I'm about 4 days and 4 workouts into it, and I've probably had about a 10% reduction in pain, and 10% improvement in energy levels. That is substantive improvement in my world, and I can't wait to see how much better I feel after a few months!

BTW, I recommend the Pain Free book, as well. The info is very helpful and easily digestible. The e-cises in the book are targeted to specific body areas, and are different than what's in the dvd workout. You will probably need some yoga blocks to do the book e-cises, just fyi. The dvds require only your body and maybe a yoga mat to lie on. So, I'm crossing my fingers that someone out there whose situation is as dire as mine is reads this, and gives this a whirl, and starts to feel better bit by bit. From one woman who is fed up and sick and tired of being sick and tired... trust me, the Egoscue Method is definitely a step in the right direction!",1319414400,96,4180,4.482939632545932

I am 49 years old and have been an active athlete all my life.  Unfortunately as the years have passed, I've found it harder to recover from injuries including acute achilles tendonitis that I was dealing with on and off for almost ten years.  Last year I started training seriously for my third marathon but was forced to pull out of the New York City Marathon because of my achilles compounded by piriformis.  My brother-in-law recommended I try Egoscue.  I was pretty skeptical, thinking it was some sort of fad.  But I started doing the Beginner Exercises every day and within several sessions found my hips feeling much more open and relief from my piriformis.  It's now been four months that I've been doing Egoscue but am now back to running and up to 30 miles a week, including a 12 mile long run.  I am planning again for a marathon this year since my achilles tendonitis is completely gone and my piriformis is almost completely cured.

2815098,5,B000PAU2ZS,"I have suffered from lower lumbar back pain for 40 years.  Forty years ago, the Veterans Administration Hospital strongly recommended surgery. And meanwhile provided grocery bags of pain killers.

Due to a long search for back self help, my library of back books now fills shelves and boxes. A common pattern runs through the hundreds of ""back books"" and seminars which I have read or attended over forty years. Whether the subject is Tai Chi, Yoga, or Pilates, I always find that some exercises seem to help, but there are unhappily always a few exercises that do further injury. And there is the rub.

Thankfully, I eventually found right here - at Amazon - some back books and DVD's which have given me relief from back pain for the first time in 40 years  - as well as a new found ability to run and ice skate again.

Admittedly, my search was a long journey, with a lot of rabbit trails, but I found the best self help yet in the books and DVD's of Peter Egoscue.  Book by book, I became so impressed with the functional results, that I eventually bought every book and DVD Peter has written or produced.

In this DVD series, pay attention to an easily overlooked section of the ""Advanced DVD"" directed toward the health practioner. Brian Brady clearly explains the functional purpose and specific benefits of each position.
Some of the Egoscue DVD's are not yet available on Amazon. But 90% of them are here at Amazon.

My back problems are largely confined to the lower lumbar area, due to injuries sustained in Vietnam in 1970.

Ironically, Peter Egoscue is also a Vietnam veteran who sustained injuries while on duty. Peter embarked on his own search to heal himself.

What a marvelous, simple and robust approach he has pioneered.  Not one of Peter egoscue's procedures has ever caused my back further injury or pain!

Friends and family often remark that I just don't look like I could be in my mid 60's.  Functional posture and balance can do so much to one's overall health.

2815105,5,B000PAU2ZS,"the egoscue method of pain reduction (back ache, feet hurt.etc) has a real basis in logic and anatomy...just correcting my posture as i walk has stopped some minor knee pain...i know the exercises are going to really help more chronic pain...they are very simple...like lying on your back facing your bed with your knees and legs flat on the top of the bed...
this is not hard to understand or to perform..

2815106,5,B000PAU2ZS,"The book ""Pain Free"" translated into Korean which is better than the original copy (English version) saved my uncle, who had had a car accident, from a surgery.  MY uncle had MRI three times and was advised to have a surgery.

The reason I say that the translaed one is better is that it attched photos of models to show how to do excercises at the end of the book clearly but the original one didn't have any attachment. The original copy contained pictures drawn by hand in the middle of books whenever necessary, which makes it difficult to understand how to do exercises.",1251504000,3,575,4.519230769230769
2815107,2,B000PAU2ZS,"While the egoscue program is a good one this DVD is NOT for everyone and definitly should NOT be used until an individual has achieved proper realignmnet. I give this DVD a 2 star because it implies you can achieve proper alignment using the exercises on this DVD when in fact you can not. Most of the exercises in the DVD are for building strength and flexibility once you have returned to proper alignment through the use of the exercises in the book or with a certified egoscue instructor. The exercises on the DVD are NOT the same as the ones in the book and can actually cause more pain if you are still out of alignment and use them as was the case with me. Sadly there is nothing in the editorial review or on the DVD package that tells you this.
This information regarding the DVD exercises was told to me by Michael Bellofatto from Egoscue.
Get the book FIRST and do those exercises first, that's where you need to start before spending money on this DVD!
The best would be if Egoscue would make a DVD of the exercises in the book so we all could learn how to do them correctly and help ourselves, for those of us who can't afford or don't have access to and Egoscue clinic or instructor. Plus exercising from a book is just darn awkward!",1248566400,320,1247,4.333333333333333
2815108,5,B000PAU2ZS,This is a great way to release pain and tension in your body. Both the beginner and advanced CD's are excellent (although I agree with other reviewers on the low production quality). I am 55 and was in fairly good shape to begin with but didn't feel well (was always tight and achy) even after a good workout at the gym. The Egoscue method is amazing but there is one thing: you have to do it! This is not a quick fix and many people (including my doctor who admitted she had lots of aches and pains) aren't willing to spend the 45 minutes required. If you do either of the CD's at least three to four times a week you will definitely feel ALOT better!,1241827200,7,652,4.182539682539683
2815109,5,B000PAU2ZS,"I ordered this DVD to see if this could help with a persistent but mild shoulder pain. The next day after the DVD arrived, I met an accident - a head on car collision. Although there were no apparent injuries on the spot , the whiplash kicked in that night and I barely slept a wink. The next day was a complete write off with the pain and the Advils didn't seem to help much. I decided to try out this new DVD the next morning . I am so glad I did! Immediately after the workout, I felt a lot lighter and the pain just seemed to lift off. By non I was 75% better than the previous day. It has been 10 days since my accident and I have done this work out about 4 times. The day I do this workout I feel light as a feather.  Thank you Pete Egoscue for this awesome DVD that works like magic!!  I am going to read the books and be regular with this wonderful workout!  Highly recommended!!!",1235692800,13,888,3.9775280898876404
2815110,4,B000PAU2ZS,"After just the first time using the beginner video my left thumb could be moved without excruciating pain and I could open and close my hands easier and gained back a bunch of hand strength! To say that I am pleased is an understatement!
I already use workout videos 3 times a week, so exercising it not a foreign idea to me.  Now, I still do the regular workouts, but have added the pain free stretches 2-4 times a week. It is just amazing to me how it is adding strength and flexibility and my posture is improving too!
I find this workout to be very helpful and relaxing.  I feel energized and more flexible. Warning: you must DO the workout to get the results. Does not work by osmosis. I say this because I brag about it to everyone who will listen.  Very few are willing to get off their butts and take action, even with the hope of getting out of pain.  Go figure.
I recommend the book Pain Free by Pete Egoscue to go with the videos, as it gives more details and more exercises for targeting your pain.  Good luck, and get moving!",1234051200,19,1038,4.248730964467005

2815114,5,B000PAU2ZS,"I have the DVD set and the book.  I am 62, a retired Marine, and very fit.  That means I can run over 3 miles, sprint, play soccer with 22 year olds, do lots of pull-ups, sit-ups, push-ups, etc.  But because of my desk bound job, I think, I have developed a forward leaning slouching posture.  I have noticed a difference within a week of using this series of beginning exercises.  I am more aware of standing and sitting straight and my major postural muscles are putting me in a better position.  The workout takes 45 minutes which is time consuming since I also want to do fitness training.  The exercises are physically easy for me, so after I continue for 30 days, I will step up to the workout DVD, so I can get some fitness as well as posture/flexibility training.  I believe that this kind of exercise would have been very beneficial much earlier in my life.  Proper flexibility and attention to some completely ignored muscles should be part of everyone's exercise regimen along with strength and cardiovascular work.  I am confident that nearly anybody can do these exercises.  I plan to show them to my 86 year old dad, also a retired Marine, whose bending posture takes his head closer to the ground every year.  I found the quality of the production to be more than adequate.  Based on one of the reviews here, I was prepared for something substandard.  I didn't see it that way.  It is in color, with clear voice over background music.  The presentation is informative with explanations to support demonstration of the exercises.  Both presenters are pleasant to watch and listen to.  The program is a single take without edits because they really aren't necessary.  The dialogue is spontaneous rather than scripted.

2815116,4,B000PAU2ZS,"Let me begin by saying that I have a lot of workout books and DVD's on my shelf that promised big and didn't work out...  The first time I tried this exercise routine, I worked through both the beginners and advanced cd's one after the other.  Sounds pretty standard huh!  However, what isn't standard is the fact that there is something about this routine that allowed me to do certain poses and moves that I haven't been able to do for many, many years.  I have overstretched ligaments throughout my body and normally could not do the majority of exercises in the advanced DVD (such as putting weight on my wrist in any way - even the Cats and Dogs used to be too hard on my wrist - or doing deep knee bends etc.); yet, I am able to do these exercises within the sequence.  One presumes the reason is becasue of the well thought out routine that works out and stretches the right muscles in the right order without over taxing the body.  I highly recommend this DVD to young and 'old' alike.  You'll all love the way you feel a foot taller after the workout.",1209254400,32,1060,4.3232323232323235

I've found these exercises to help with chronic pain that I have been having for years. The chronic pain comes from a tailbone injury that I received as a teen that a doctor then tried to do an adjustment on my spine and damaged a nerve.

As one reviewer has already pointed out, you practically have to be in possession of super-human powers to successfully navigate the second disc.  (After two grueling, profanity-laden attempts, I've more or less shelved it--and I'm in decent physical condition--I think.)  Be that as it may, there's plenty to keep the highly motivated user busy on the beginner disc, and it doesn't take long to begin seeing and feeling the benefits.  Granted, some may find the lengthy explanations of each exercise overwhelming, as Mr. Exercise Physiologist fires off the names of muscle after muscle, at times grappling with his tortured diction.  And the ultra-fit, middle-aged exercise model of Continental origin does pose some unnecessary (i.e., stupid) questions.  Nevertheless, I, for one, am simply glad to have a knowledgeable human being guiding me through these E-cises, pointing out subtleties that I've sometimes missed in the books.",1198368000,33,1122,5.346590909090909

Form is the key to all of these exercises.  Do them properly or don't bother.  Brian has put together a great series of exercises to help you realign each major joint and muscle section, allowing them to 'communicate' properly and thereby allow your body to work as one unit.  I'm very impressed with the program and strongly disagree with the reviewers who called them ""faded and dated.""  While some of these exercises may resemble some that you have done in the past, they really are quite different.  They are performed slowly and deliberately, with mindfulness.  You need to achieve the pose and hold each one for a minute.  The effect of the proper performance of this set of exercises is like performing a chiropractic adjustment on yourself through movement and relaxing into each pose. That means it is critical to do them properly.",1524009600,,1056,4.926553672316384
