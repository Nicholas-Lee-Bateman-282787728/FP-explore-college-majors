7956899,4,B00005Y7Z4,"A warning against the dangers of video games is offered by ""Star Trek: The Next Generation,"" Episode 106, ""The Game"" (Story by Susan Sackett, Fred Bronson, & Brannon Braga, Teleplay by Brannon Braga, Aired October 28, 1991).  There is nothing like a visit to Risa, the legendary pleasure planet of the ""Star Trek"" universe and Will Riker (Jonathan Frakes) is having big time fun with a pleasure girl who introduces him to an exciting little game you play by putting on a visor like device.  When Riker returns he brings with him ""The Game"" with him and starts replicating it for all of his friends. The game basically interfaces directly with your brain and the next thing you know everybody on board the Enterprise is hooked. Everyone except for Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton), on board for a short vacation from Starfleet Academy. Wesley has hooked up with Mission Specialist Robin Leflar (Ashley Judd), a young engineer, and they become suspicious when people try to pressure them into trying the game. When they check out one of the devices they discover that not only is the game psychologically addictive, it also affects the brain's ability to reason. Wesley takes his findings to the captain, but discovers Picard has already become addicted to the game. The only person on the Enterprise immune from the game's effects is Data, but Wesley's mom has already turned him off and rewired him so Data is in an android coma. Now that we are totally confused as to what is going on, a spaceship approaches with Riker's ""pleasure girl"" in command of an alien invasion force. The game gives her mind control over everyone who has played. Picard gives orders to force everyone who has not played the game to do so, which quickly leaves Wesley the only one left aboard the Enterprise who has yet to be enthralled by the device.
Star Trek has always been known for dressing up contemporary social issues in futuristic trappings and in ""The Game"" we have a not too subtle indictment of video games (computer games were just starting to take off way back then, but they would also be covered under this indictment). Turn corporate giants like Atari or Nintendo into hostile aliens bent on taking over to the world and the rest of the extended metaphor certainly holds up. If the previous episode (""Disaster"") was the wrong people in the wrong place at the wrong time, ""The Game"" is one of those where the Enterprise lucks out because Wesley happened to have dropped by for a visit. This is really the last episode with the ""old"" Wesley, since from here on in his character takes a significant turn in a new direction that will get him out of the series and the ""Star Trek"" universe for good. Final Note: Robin Leflar went on to be one of the characters serving on the ""Excalibur"" in Peter David's ""Star Trek: New Frontier"" series, but nobody knows what ever happend to Ashley Judd...",1073347200,,2876,4.715705765407555
