6611642,5,B00N57H6SE,Received a promo disc.  I actually enjoyed it and will be sending a full copy to my grandkids.  I find the modern movies too action packed.  Kids don't need constant action to be entertained.  This movie was light and fun and even had a sing a long bonus.,1416182400,,255,4.25

6611644,5,B00N57H6SE,"This is a short DVD Christmas story.

Sherman is an apprentice elf in the North Pole and it is almost Christmas Eve. He desires to become a full fledged elf but he is unable to find the right spot for his talents. He is moved from department to department and just about gives up and leaves until Santa shows him how very special he truly is.

This is a story about finding the ""magic"" in you. All the other elves knew you had to find your own confidence and talent and magic. They could not help Sherman. Sherman finds his talent and magic through accidentally shrinking Santa's magic toy bag.

It is a delightful story. The characters are similar to the Muppet puppet characters. There is singing in the movie . It is a nice family story.
