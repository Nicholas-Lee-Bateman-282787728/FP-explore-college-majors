7933261,3,B000059H9J,"This is a documentary. not a film of stand up comedy. it gives you a true perspective of the craft of comedy.
How it is on the road, how the industry treats you and the struggle to make a name for yourself.",1305244800,,206,3.9285714285714284
7933262,5,B000059H9J,Very funny and insightful look at several comics trying to reach stardom. A look into TryFlynn's life as he struggles in the business. His Answering Machine bit is hilarious and the commentary from his ex-girlfriend about the real-life incident makes it priceless. A must have for any real comic fan because stand-up comedy is the only pure entertainment artform. Eddie Griffin makes a great contribution.,989884800,12,405,5.246153846153846
