3796605,3,B001U41838,Purchassed this just cause I am a Michael Pare' Fan and it was a really good movie and I enjoyed Michael in it. However if I was a fan of Dolph's it would probaby be a 5 star rating,1254355200,,181,3.6666666666666665
3796606,1,B001U41838,"It's hard to summarize how many things are wrong with this film.  The box says it's ""R"" for violence, language and nudity.  Lie.  Half of the dialog is Lundgren saying to May (the girl he's rescuing) ""This way!"" or ""Over here!"" or ""Get down!"" Oh-those are the more subtle lines in the dialog by the way.  I recall no vulgarity.  Nudity?  If you count a picture of May's back-which is a very nice back, and a picture of Lundgren's chest-which is a pretty decent chest-then OK, nudity. Violence? Not much more than you can see on TV every night.
Plot?  Nothing is as it is presented to be in the beginning--but nobody cares.  The actors and actresses sure don't seem to care.  Neither will you.  It's about the most insipid good vs. evil story I've seen in an action film.  Action sequences? That's the worst.  ""High-speed"" car (or truck) chases that look like they're going 4 mph-which they probably really are.  Bad guys 10 ft away from the good guy's vehicle firing automatic weapons at it for miles-and they never think to shoot out the tires?  Guess that would be un-manly or something.  Scenes like the parody in ""Hot Shots"" where Rambo faces about 100 vietcong who fire their automatic weapons at him and all miss, then he fires 1 burst of his automatic and all 100 fall down dead--except in this movie you're supposed to believe these kinds of scenes.  It would be nice if it were amusing, but it is not.  Blue-ray cannot save this film.  Save yourself!",1251072000,5,1459,4.546153846153846
3796607,1,B001U41838,"This is the worst movie I have seen in a while. Dolph Lundgreen is old but it doesnt't really look that bad. He is moving and speaking in slow motion but manages to kill everybody. The script is really bad and the acting unconvincing. If you must see it, do yourself a favor and rent it. It is not worth the disc is recorded on.

What is it with old ""stars"" and young girls in these movies anyway ? I find it lame and disgraceful.... The girl could definetely be his daughter.

The bluray transfer however, is not bad...",1249603200,8,520,4.242424242424242
3796608,3,B001U41838,"Direct Contact: 6 out of 10: This is one of the most action packed movies I have ever seen. Now keep in mind the action is not always good and the script does write checks that the budget cannot cash. In addition, Dolph Lundgren gives the best performance in the film...

However, one cannot deny that compare to those bloated (in more than one-way mind you) Segal films such as Driven to Kill; this is a fit, fast and fun ride.

Dolph starts the film in an eastern European prison but is let out to rescue an American girl from a concentration camp located just to the east of a World War 2 film. (Direct Contact takes place in modern times but both the camp commander, and the camp victims, would not be out of place in Schindler's List had that Academy Award winning treat been directed by Uwe Boll and produced by Full Moon Productions.) Bashar Rahal plays camp commandant General Drago with such a silly vigor, that when he shoots children in the head you just cannot help but laugh. Not to mention that any character with the name General Drago belongs in a film with either Lightsabers or Dragons, not Fiddler on the Roof extras being mowed down by machine guns.

Gina May plays the damsel in distress, whom is much easier on the eyes than she is the ears. Her acting could have been improved with more nudity and less dialogue: much less dialogue. The rest of the cast includes Michael Pare, random Bulgarians and James Chalke who gives the kind of horrible performance that makes one wonder if he financed the entire film.

Now back to the reason to watch the film, the action. Dolph is in good shape and makes a surprisingly agile action star. Moreover, even though Bulgaria has no native word for continuity, it is a country that for a couple of bucks you can drive tanks through buildings in its scenic downtown like some sort of Goldeneye road show.

Overall, I enjoyed the film more than I should have. Lord knows it could have been better. However, as the good lord above also knows, it could have been a lot worse. Direct Contact may commit countless cinematic sins but it is never less than entertaining.",1248912000,3,2121,4.513020833333333
3796609,1,B001U41838,"After reading the two pretty positive reviews I decided to take a chance on this one. Boy was that a mistake :) It wasn't horrible, but I actually kind of feel sorry for ol' Dolph. I was curious to see how he turned out. Why did his career tank so bad? The acting in this is terrible. The fight scenes are pretty darn bad also. There are lots and lots of shooting but its all super ridiculous. Dozens of men firing automatic rifles and yet nobody's windshield gets even one hole in it? Some of the scenes just didn't seem to even make sense. Save yourself some money and time and avoid this movie. The only way this movie could possibly have been worse would if Steven Seagal was the star and then we would have had to watch his squinty-faced joke of a dialogue worst acting out there and body doubles used for scenes that involve more than just Seagal's head :) Yes, this movie was actually that darn bad.",1245542400,4,906,4.304093567251462
3796610,5,B001U41838,I didn't think the DVD could get any better until I saw the Blu-ray. The action feels like it's in your living room. Hi-def Dolph. Done and done.,1244592000,4,145,4.214285714285714
3796611,5,B001U41838,"All you need to know is Dolph Lundgren. What is better than slow-mo action sequences, kicks & punches, lots of bullets and blood. If you're an action fan, a Dolph fan or just a fan of entertaining movies in general, you need to see this one. Lundgren plays Mike Riggins, a former imprisoned tough guy who's on a mission to save a kidnapped woman somewhere in Eastern Europe. The action sequences are awesome, the hand-to-hand combat is killer and Dolph Lundgren is nothing short of action-legend status.",1244592000,4,503,4.793103448275862
3796612,3,B001U41838,"I don't have high hopes on movies written and directed by Danny Lerner and Dolph's direct-to-DVD movies have been of varying quality. ""Direct Contact"" was better than I expected. There's nothing original about the plot but it's entertaining, with a fast pace and plenty of action. This is Dolphh's best movie in some time. Recommended for action fans. 3+",1240444800,3,354,5.016949152542373
3796613,5,B001U41838,I was quite impressed with how much this film was a tribute to all the 80s action films and also how good the action was in this film. If you love Dolph and even his past films. This one is for you!,1370217600,,198,3.738095238095238
3796614,2,B001U41838,"How could this man be a hero? But the ""Bad guys"" and the ""hero""(Mike)killing at random aprox 60 innocent towns people and at least 100 more solders for no reason, to save one girl, is not a good guy. It spent so much time in car chases (32min), killing people (26min), gasoline explosions(32min) with 3 minutes of story and 1min of kissing you MIGHT Love this story. I am sorry I rated this so high, but with all the action I could not give it only one star. SORRY!",1367539200,,465,4.235955056179775

3796616,1,B001U41838,"Wow! What an incredibly bad movie. Yes the 80's created action movies like this, but so did the 80's create crack. Does that mean we should all go out and enjoy trying crack just because it was created in the 80's? HELL NO!

Horrible chase scenes from alternating weather (sunny/cloudy days all in one action scene) to cars suddenly driving slower than Grandma Moses to show a close up. But wait, it gets worse, the script is amazingly disjointed only superseded by the atrocious acting that make a soft porn movie look like an academy award winning guarantee. What a mess!

There is a reason why Lundgren (now looking a bit haggard) is the star of this movie, nobody else would get caught dead in such tripe. I cannot really give you much of a storyline as the script is nonsensical.

The only way one could truly enjoy this movie would be to knock oneself up with laughing gas while at the same time hitting oneself repeatedly with a meat mallet so as not to fall asleep.

Aside from the fact that good 80's style Action flicks were that of Die Hard and Lethal Weapon, this pathetic movie was made in 2009, primarily to sucker Dolph fans into paying to see this and it succeeded (base on some of the 5 star ratings).

All I can say at this point is that I am now seriously contemplating to discontinue my cable subscription if it airs another movie as bad as this one.

This movie gives justification for a new rating based upon the risk level of permanent brain damage caused in seeing such a movie.",1347235200,,1502,4.443636363636363
3796617,3,B001U41838,"The story: Mike Riggins (Lundgren), an ex-Special Forces veteran of Kosovo, is promised release from his unjust incarceration at a Bulgarian prison by a shady businessman (Michael Par,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Streets-of-Fire/dp/0783227876/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Streets of Fire</a>) if he can rescue an American woman (Gina May, ""Undressed"", ""Malibu, CA"") from the control of a sadistic general (Bashar Rahal,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hannibal-Rome-s-Worst-Nightmare/dp/B0018UZCVS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hannibal: Rome's Worst Nightmare</a>). However, when it becomes clear that the girl was not kidnapped but is being stalked for darker reasons, Mike must fight for his life as he attempts to bring her safely to the American embassy.

If nothing else, ""Direct Contact"" stands out for being the most action-packed of all of Lundgren's recent pre-<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Expendables/dp/B002ZG999U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Expendables</a>&nbsp;fare. More so than any of the no-namers who wrangled Dolph's fare in the last several years, director Danny Lerner (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sharks-in-Venice/dp/B001GJ4TV0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sharks in Venice</a>) realized what fans want to see the Swedish Superman involved in and delivers it satisfactorily: three hand-to-hand fights, three big car chases, a smattering of shootouts, and more blowing up of stuff than in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/latest-Rambo-movie/dp/B0015XHP2C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">latest Rambo movie</a>. Van Damme and Seagal have yet to find themselves a vehicle which so admirably brings back the over-the-top action content of yesteryear like Lundgren has, and for this, this one should be of immediate interest to fans.

However, the styling of all this mayhem might be a bit too over-the-top for some more conservative action fans. The car chases in particular are notable for the sheer amount of destruction they cause to the city environment - so much that it almost seems cartoony. Make no mistake, everything is pretty well put together (not to mention exciting: shades of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Race/dp/B001ILHY1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Race</a>&nbsp;on the second chase), but you could make an argument whether requiring this much suspension of disbelief is appropriate for an action film that's otherwise played straight. I mean, these goons practically rip the entire city apart in their hunt for one guy on a motorcycle! Additionally, the fistfights aren't the best you should expect from the karate expert: while there's at least one roundly satisfying exchange Dolph has with a no-name soldier, the two others are a bit too awkwardly-staged to count as great. A few short skirmishes are sprinkled between the main brawls, but these hardly count towards anything: a good representative of these occurs when Lundgren is lifted up bodily and slammed against the wall by an attacker but cuts the fight short by promptly shooting him. What, was he afraid of being upstaged?

The production values are good all around. The movie team makes fine use of its shooting locations in the Bulgarian capital, so that despite the relative grayness of the color palate, the movie is never dull to look at. The acting from everybody is acceptably hammy, although I couldn't help but feel that Michael Par was miscast as the slimy, underhanded villain: sure, he has a decent little punching exchange with Dolph at the end of the movie (SPOILER! - not to mention a pretty spectacular death), but considering his credentials, it would've been nice to see him in a more physical and/or intimidating role. On the other hand, the villains in general are certainly done up something nasty: never before have so many innocent bystanders kicked it just because the bad guys were jerks, as seen when Par's character shoots an entire homeless family to death just because they couldn't understand English. In Bulgaria. What I said: over-the-top.

It's kinda hard to describe the general temperament of the film. On one hand, the director and production team were obviously trying to make ""Direct Contact"" the most explosive flick Dolph had gunned to in a while, but Lundgren himself almost seems to be phoning it in, especially when it comes to his sorry-looking kicks. When it comes to enthusiasm, the film is certainly unbalanced, but in the end, it's definitely worth buying. With a bit more oomph from the right participants, this one could've been a classic, but at this stage in Dolph's career, fans must be content with ""pretty good.""",1285632000,2,4830,6.098529411764706

3796620,1,B001U41838,"Direct Contact is the worst and most stupid Dolp Lundgren movie ever !!! The action is laughable and Dolphs preformance is so bad you will not believe it . And the dialog , HA HA ,  even more laughable so STUPID . I use to like Dolp a lot , BUT please if this is the future crap from good ol Lundgren PLEASE RETIRE , thank you .",1262390400,2,328,3.823529411764706
3796621,4,B001U41838,"Watching Dolph Lundgren portraying an American in Danny Lerner's ""Direct Contact"" reminded me of the Swedish actor's early films, when he could barely speak English! At 52, he has mastered the language, has aged and weathered into a tough, believable action hero, and makes the implausibilities of this multi-national production much easier to ignore! This isn't great cinema, but it is fun, with beautiful Bulgarian locations, the underrated Michael Par&eacute; (""Streets of Fire"") a quite servicable villain, and very youthful-looking Gina May, at 35, making up for a lack of acting skill with beauty and a surprising physical prowess as the female lead.

Lundgren, with his height and presence, reminds me of John Wayne, in his films of the 1950s. Neither actor is particularly graceful, but whenever action is required, both brawl with unbelievable power. Lundgren disposes of the private army of villainous General Drago (Bashar Rahal) as efficiently as Arnold Schwarzenegger did, in ""Commando"", taking two bullet wounds stoically as the body count rises. While you know he and May will fall for each other, their love scene is short and surprisingly well-played, with Lundgren's huge grin erasing his years, and making the moment less far-fetched than you'd initially think.

If you aren't hung up on reality, like your fights more 'real' than CGI-created, and are a fan of the action genre, you could do a LOT worse than ""Direct Contact""...I liked it!",1260748800,4,1458,5.226495726495727
3796622,3,B001U41838,"Although the action scenes are decent, the stunts executed fairly well, and the story fairly plausible, Direct Contact (2009) suffers from `lazy filmmaking'.  There is a lack of attention to detail, a lack of effort in the writing of dialog, and a basic disregard for logic and reality, that detracts from what is otherwise a serviceable comic book action adventure.  Since Danny Lenner both wrote and directed the film, the source of the problems appears clear.

Dolph Lungren is Mike Riggins, a former US marine doing time in a Balkan prison, for dealing in contraband.  Riggins is offered money and his freedom, in return for freeing a kidnapped woman named Ana Gale, (Gina Marie May) who is being held captive in a guarded military compound.  Clive Connelly (Michael Pare), supposedly associated with the US embassy, brokers the deal and arranges for Riggins release.

Riggins speaks to Vlado Karadjov (Vladimir Vladimirov), the man holding the woman hostage.  After Vlado refuses to free her, Riggins raids the encampment, takes Ana by force, and leaves the place in flames.  Things get confusing, as Ana says she has not been kidnapped, and after showing up at a meeting with Connelly without Ana, Riggins is fleeing across the city on a motorcycle, dodging bullets.  He catches up with Ana at a train station, and from there the pair is continuously on the run, as she is actually the heir to a huge fortune.  At 35, Gina May is in excellent physical condition.

Dolph Lundgren has been doing pretty well directing his own films, and probably would have done a better job directing this one than Danny Lenner.  With numerous explosions, several vehicle chases, plenty of hand to hand combat, several flying cars, and a slew of gunfights, Direct Contact solidly delivers gratuitous violence and destruction.  Unfortunately, very little effort was made to produce a polished or credible film.  Command Performance (2009), which was directed by Lundgren, and is scheduled for release soon, is getting good reviews, and hopefully will be an improvement.

Direct Contact is presented in widescreen, and is closed captioned.  The DVD contains no bonus features.  The film is recommended to Lundgren fans, and lightly recommended to those with minimal standards for action movies.",1255737600,9,2280,5.1024258760107815
