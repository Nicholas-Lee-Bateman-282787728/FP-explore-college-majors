3959217,4,B002NB425S,"Interesting, informative and accurate documentary of (by far) the most prolific firearm inventor in history.  It starts with his father, Jonathan Browning's firearms, and then covers John M. Browning's invention of his single shot rifle, his years inventing firearms for Winchester, FN Herstal in Belgium, Remington, Colt, and his invention of automatic firearms(and 1911 pistol) for the US military.  This documentary would probably be of interest to anyone who has a general interest in inventors, not just firearm enthusiasts.  The only minor criticism I have is that it was apparently copied from an older, unrestored film print, and has a few glitches during its 58 minutes.",1355702400,3,679,5.386792452830188

3959219,5,B002NB425S,For any firearm historian/collector it is a must-see as it describes one of the most influential figures of the 1900's. John Browning was a brilliant inventor responsible for the first repeating gun and many more engineering marvels of the time still used and unchanged today. The documentary is very informative and accurate. Highly recommended.,1267488000,4,346,5.425925925925926
