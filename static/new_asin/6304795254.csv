925453,5,6304795254,"This is a fantastic movie!! Douglas, whom I have always enjoyed, and Penn, whom I have never really liked, deliver superb performances in their roles. Once the action really started moving, I found myself staying one step  ahead of Douglas, which actually added to my enjoyment. I did fall behind  at the ending, where my first reaction was ""What's that doing  there?"". Unless you are a die-hard Douglas fan and collector, rent  this great suspenseful thriller for your first viewing:  knowing the ending  will take away the suspense, but not the thrills, of subsequent viewings.

925762,5,6304795254,"Michael Douglas as Nicholas Van Orton, an arrogant and self-centered investment banker who receives a birthday gift from his younger brother (Sean Penn, in one of his best supporting roles) that is sure to change his life, or at least his outlook on life. There's a strong supporting cast, most notably besides Penn, Deborah Kara Unger as Van Orton's (semi-spoiler alert) seemingly nemesis, then ally, and eventually love interest, whom Van Orton doesn't suspect as being part of ""the game"" until it's too late to prevent himself from being drugged and left for dead in Mexico.

As good as the players who surround Douglas in this one are, none steal the show from him. They all have their shining moments, but this is Douglas in one of his best, and lesser-known films. He seems to be at his best when his character is an arrogant prick and Van Orton sure is, which is why he's so suited for ""the game.""

926134,5,6304795254,"Do not try to reduce this film to only one meaning.

It is obviously a film centered on the relationship between an elder son and his father when the father commits suicide in front of the childs eyes when he is 48 and the child is about six or eight. The case is made more complex with the fact that there is a younger son who the elder son took care of as his brother, which is natural, but in a way oppressive in the absence of the father. Even trickier is the fact that the elder son has taken over the family estate (and business), has been married but is divorced and lives alone on the estate with the housekeeper of long ago, of the time when he was a child, hence who has known his father, though she is either older than she looks, and hence too old to take care of such an estate, or she was very young at the time of the suicide and hence cannot really remember much about the father. That connection to the past is rather loose since Ilsa should be at the least 20 at the time of the suicide and should have been hired when she was eighteen. But that is young for a servant who is now the housekeeper and has been for a long time. Otherwise forty years later she should be at retiring age and should have entered that service when she was rathe
r 25 or 28.

The second element is the rivalry between two brothers in the absence of the father who spectacularly stepped out of life. Then the whole shebang being devised by the younger brother, it is a very perverse way for him to remind his elder brother whose forty-eighth birthday is celebrated today that their father committed suicide on exactly the same occasion by jumping from the top of a high chimney onto the flagstones of a terrace behind the family estate. Perverse and morbid if not even worse than morbid. With a suicide note supposedly signed by the elder son, Nicholas or Nick, saying Like my father before me, I choose eternal sleep. Note this suicide note is slightly bizarre because of the present tense directed at Nicholas himself in the game. But it is supposed to be read after the death of the suicidee, and that is hyper important for the suicidee who would use the preterit, the past if you prefer, because he is before committing his suicide projecting himself mentally into what is going to happen after his suicide is in the past. And in the past, it would even be worse because the effect would be multiplied on Nicholas since it might mean for Nicholas in the game he is dead. This rivalry is enacted to the very end of the game: harsh confrontation of the two brothers in the night in some San Francisco street stairs; the accidental killing of Conrad, the younger brother, by Nicholas on the roof of the skyscraper from which he is going to jump (or he would have been thrown over by one actor, if he had not jumped by himself), reenacting his fathers own suicide; and the new confrontation of the two after Conrads rebirth, resurrection and Nicholas great fall like some Humpty Dumpty. The last touch on the two brothers will be some kind of reconciliation when Nicholas suggests sharing the bill and Conrad accepts.

So far that is banal and that would only make a good psychological melodrama, a drama with a good ending. But it is so much more.

First, it is a game but the game is played in the real world with real means and with as little visible cheating as possible. All the bullets have been changed to blanks, though the gun Nicholas uses is from the To Kill a Mockingbird copy hiding a very powerful handgun (at the top of the library in the family estate), and at the end the actress playing Christine will have to convince Nicholas that his gun has real bullets whereas all the other guns used in the game only had blanks. This is slightly hard to believe for us because the shooting of a gun from the game punctures a tire in one of the chasing episodes, and the machine guns, or so, used by the CRS posse when they try to neutralize him when he gets berserk at Christines do make many holes in the setting. Of course, it is nothing but a cinema scene, so everything is fake but in the film, it is a real situation that probably explains the price of the game because of all the hundreds of bullets holes that have to be exploded artificially to make Nicholas believe the CRS agents are using real bullets. We, of course, can see the treachery at every corner in that labyrinthine plot, but Nicholas is not supposed to see it though at times it is slightly too obvious. Some scenes are even comical and emphasized as such by some comment from Nicholas like Dinner for two, please when Christine and Nicholas emerge from the two dumpsters behind a Chinese restaurant. As some would say, too good to be true.

Second, we are projected into a world where crazy adventures can happen virtually but as if they were real. The film is a metaphor for virtual reality and games in that virtual world, virtual reality games that are so true that we believe they are real life. What is surprising is that several times, often to save their skins, some actors reveal it is a game, to the point that Nicholas believes it and wants to step out, to pull the curtain, to stop the game. And he discovers he cannot, and he also discovers the actors who have revealed it is a game are still in the game and still working for it, even when they are supposed to be in their own private life. An effort is even made to prove to Nicholas the main CRS man, Jim Feingold, is a simple family man with children visiting the zoo. A metaphor that could mean in the future (of the film as well as our own future) reality will be a blend of virtual reality and real reality and the divide between the two could be difficult to capture all the time.

Beyond this idea of a metaphor it could also be considered as a real description of the mind of a person involved in some kind of psychotic episode (I will not say schizophrenia because psychiatrists are finally realizing schizophrenia does not exist and is only an extreme form of psychosis) when the real reality of his/her experience cannot be easily disentangled from the virtual reality of his/her second personality, the two sides of this split personality not being clearly separated and distinguishable for the subject him/herself. And a few times Nicholas thinks he is getting crazy and some of the characters, like his lawyer, Sam Sutherland, plays the game by insisting on his having to be worried or not, or the clerk at the hotel who plays surprised when Nicholas does not remember the night before there, though he did not come to that hotel on the night before. Why on earth do they have his credit card at the reception counter?

The fourth approach is what some people insisted upon: it is a demonstration of how easily we can be manipulated by people; organizations, criminal or not, political or not; social networks or other neutral organizations of the type; not to speak of the media and the manipulators of the media, politicians, advertisers, and other gurus or preachers who want to influence the people into believing this or that, into doing this or that. The film, of course, shows that such a game requires hundreds of people being hired to play the game in very simple and ordinary structures, including the police and other security institutions, lawyers and businessmen or businesswomen. If we push aside this game concept and just consider the manipulation we can say this film reveals how easy it is to make someone believe in anything at any time with some immediate reactions from these people who are being manipulated, reactions that can be irreversible or quasi-irreversible. It is such manipulations that enable some political organizations to become powerful in spite of the unethical arguments they use in the shape of fear and anger. It is through such channels that racism, white supremacy, sexism, genderism and many other ideologies targeting a certain type of people they want to be ostracized and segregated against manage to make their opinions valid.

Consider the case of Catalonia where only 40% or so of the people voted in an illegal referendum giving a majority, but if we consider that all those who would have voted no decided not to vote at all since the vote was illegal, 95% of 40% is only about 38% of the population. Even if we consider a 20% abstention rate we do not have a majority. This explains then that the President of Catalonia decided, probably under strong pressure from Europe and some countries like France, to go on negotiating with Madrid towards more autonomy but not secession. It is obvious when a situation like this referendum is dramatized by courts, governments, political organizations and businesses into some kind of civil strife that could lead to a civil war, people are pushed into corners and very strict and strong opinions and actions that do not represent reason or any sensible approach.

As such this film should be pondered upon and meditated.

I didn't particularly care for the story line, but i just enjoyed watching Michael Douglas and Sean Penn. Both are outstanding actors.  Each person was cast very well and played their parts that complimented the whole movie.

I also have to say i have a crush on Armin Mueller Stahl.  Who's always played an amazing lead as well as character actor.

As for the movie itself?  I would have had some serious trust issues after that.  It would have been hard to know what's real or if the game was really over.

Michael Douglas was handsome as always and phenomenal, even when serious, he was comedic in a very satiric way.

The chick just got on my nerves, and the last thing in the world i would do , is invite someone out for dinner, who lies constantly.  Whether it's for a living or not.",1472774400,,978,4.348066298342541

927782,5,6304795254,"What do you get a rich man who has everything he thinks he wants?  If you're his brother, maybe you get him an experience.  CRS (Consumer Recreation Services) provides a ""game"" for the elite that caters itself to the player.  But who is the player and who is being played?  When the game begins to go sideways and your property, your wealth, your family and your life are in danger is there any way out with your sanity in tact?

Michael Douglas and Sean Penn shine as brothers who get ""trapped"" within a game when what was a birthday gift turns into a nightmare.  This is one of those movies that once you've seen it and know what's happening you want to see it again to see if there were signs, and then you want each of your friends to see it to see if they figure it out, and soon you're buying boxes of the movie to give as gifts to everyone you know.  Maybe the game owns us all.

927786,4,6304795254,"I haven't seen the Criterion re-release of this movie so for all I know my ideas on it may be misinformed. Oh well!

The movie seems to be a story about events that are distorted through the mind of a troubled character. In that respect, it reminds me of Polanski's Rosemary's Baby and Cronenberg's Spider. All three movies use a detailed, realistic tone and visual style only to upend the realism with paradox and absurdity.

The Game, and all of its minutiae and complexity, comes to seem more and more like a paranoid delusion on Douglas's part. The smooth jet blacks and gleaming chrome finish of his life--so soothing and reassuring--start to reveal uncertainty and chaos beneath their surface.

His biggest problem is that he believes he is either different or better than the people around him. The movie's most effective scenes come at the end when he walks into the CRS cafeteria and sees everyone--bankers, drivers, lawyers, cops, janitors--eating and socializing happily. I think this moment is meant to visualize Douglas's inner recognition of his own kinship with the rest of the people and world around him. Later, at his birthday party, all of his acquaintances are there, including Ilsa the family maid. She looks much different. Her hair is done up very well, and she bears herself like any of the other aristocrats. This incident drives home the point that Ilsa is more than his servant who makes his dinner and cleans up after him. She has as much dignity and humanity as anyone else at that party, including Douglas.

The movie ends ambiguously because it really can't end any other way. Fincher, like Polanski and Cronenberg, creates a world in which surface details hint at deeper meanings but never reveal them. This world is like quicksand where people appear one moment, then vanish without a trace the next. I admire The Game very much, but ultimately its chill detachment makes Douglas and his rich boy problems a little too hard to care about. Despite her flaws, we always cared about Rosemary during her downward spiral. I can't say the same for Mr. Nicholas Van Orton.",1457136000,,2098,4.851955307262569

928089,4,6304795254,"In this psychological thriller, wealthy investment banker Nicholas Van Orton's estranged brother Conrad gives him an unusual present for his 48th birthday: a voucher to a ""game"" from a  company called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS).  Nicholas is curious enough to take the psychological and physical tests required to participate, and soon finds his life take some very unexpected turns, as he struggles to know what is part of his real life, and what is staged as part of ""The Game"".  He gets caught up with a waitress, but soon discovers that even she can't be taken at face value, as his world turns upside down, and nothing is as it seems.

The film does have some weaknesses, not the least of which is that the not everything is plausible, and many critics have suggested ""holes in the plot"" - although a second viewing will in many cases show these to be less problematic than one might think.  But rather than let this frustrate you (as it has understandably done for some viewers), just assume that the tests undertaken by Van Orton make the rest of the film possible, suspend your disbelief, and enjoy the ride, including the elements that may seem far-fetched.  Be aware that there's multiple uses of the F word, and there's a few instances of blasphemy and crude humour; but for the most part it's the language and violence that have given this film its rating.

What I enjoyed most is that you're seeing the action through the eyes of the protagonist Van Orton, and like him you don't know what is real anymore, and can't distinguish between what is being orchestrated and what is actual.  The aim of ""The Game"" is to figure out what ""The Game"" is, and just when you think you've figured out what is actually happening, there's an unexpected twist that turns everything on its head.  It is truly mind-bending, and the twists just keep coming.  You can't be sure what is really going on even right to the very end, until the curtain is finally raised when all becomes clear in the last few minutes.  And the ride there is a fun one; in fact I watched the film again immediately afterwards, enjoying it as much the second time with the benefit of knowing the outcome and understanding what actually is happening.  While it's not as profound or intellectually satisfying as films like The Truman Show, it is still entertaining and offers similar kind of enjoyment.

Another thing to be appreciated is how the protagonist's character develops in the course of the film.  He's clearly a selfish and self-made man at the outset, with absolutely no concern for others, but the events in his life give Van Orton opportunity for self-reflection and change in a positive way.  In some ways it's a redemption story, designed to steer Nicholas away from the emptiness that brought his own father to suicide.

The Game is a clever film, and although I personally regret the need to include some of the elements that gave it an R rating, I did enjoy it as an entertaining, suspenseful, mind-bending ride. - GODLY GADFLY (November 2015)",1448323200,,3037,4.723484848484849

928181,5,6304795254,"It has been a while since I watched the thriller movie entitled, The Game starring Michael Douglas and Sean Penn.  On those rare occasions, that I've gained an opportunity to view it on television, I always seem to gather a new perspective and/or enlarge my vision regarding life.  Essentially, after Douglas's character survived various challenging levels of the rather annoying, and later death defying game, theres one crucial scene that provided clarity, an affirmation, and a subsequent pause.  At some point in the movie, he decided to place his faith in an appealing, perplexing, but mysterious woman.  Normally, he would not entertain such a woman, but hes compelled to do so, in an effort to retrieve information about his undesirable dilemma.  Eventually, she drugs him, and when he abruptly awakes, he realizes that he was left for dead in a flimsy grave, which he was compelled to utilize some physical force, in order to escape.
As he promptly walks out of a smoky cemetery (something nearby was burning), located in an unknown shanty town in Mexico.  What followed was the most thought-provoking scene in the movie.  Despite being rich, successful, handsome, he comes to realizes that hes been betrayed.  More importantly, hes sitting in front of a small dirty shop, bungalow, who knows??  However, one thing is for certain, hes lost, bleeding, penniless, filthy, grubby, and for a vulnerable moment, he begins to cry.  At this point, I could only imagined that he thought, I lived my entire life with such precision, how could I be in this predicament??
After briefly licking his wounds, noticeably, Douglas facial expression does a 180.  His entire attitude changed from  Woe is me to Lets get to stepping.  At this very moment, I thought, thank GOD for the spirit of determination and perseverance.  Thereafter, he promptly stood up, and started walking in hopes of finding a way out, which he did.  He indeed became the hero in his own life.  Thus, I determined that however long it takes a person to lick their wounds (i.e. one minute, one month, five years, etc.), after an unfortunate and/or unpleasant experience, is considered a defining moment.  Needless to say, I cant truthfully say that Ive relished every single movie that Michael Douglas has starred in, but for those who need to witness how to properly lick your wounds, move forward, and become the hero that youve been waiting for, then watch this consummate, exemplary, and season actor show you how its done.",1446508800,4,2492,4.966265060240964

928753,5,6304795254,"The Game is an interesting film in that it has grown on me over the years into one of my all time favorite David Fincher films. I saw it back in the theater when it first came out and thought it was a decent thriller with some scenes I didn't really agree with (the ending in particular with the fall through the skylight) or find believable. And yet, year after year whenever this film would pop up on cable TV, I'd find myself watching at whatever point the film was at. I started to really pay attention to the subtleties in a film that doesn't seem subtle upon first viewing. I just found myself drawn to the sheer mind f*** of the entire film and the incredibly well cast characters. Michael Douglas is perfect in his role as uptight Nicholas Van Orton. And as each sequence unfolds around him and he becomes more and more disheveled and distraught I'd find myself cheering CRS and their ""game."" Fincher's directing and the film's art direction, cinematography, aspect ratio, Howard Shore's music, etc. are incredibly enhanced in this Blu-ray release from the always outstanding Criterion. This Blu-ray set is far superior to the other two older DVD's I own of this film. The extras are worth a look and the extra audio voice tracks are informative as well. Michael Douglas has some interesting comments regarding his experiences on this film as does Fincher. If you don't own this Blu-ray version of The Game I highly recommend that you invest in a copy. The Game is a lot of fun and I wish I could sign up for my own personally tailored adventure with CRS asap!",1420761600,,1568,4.5638297872340425

The title should really be The Mind Game.  That says it all.  The cast is very good.  I particularly enjoyed the late James Rebhorn's performance.  I first saw him act in As The World Turns.

I had watched ""Falling Down"" again the day before viewing this movie and feel Mr. Douglas has been a top tier male actor unfortunately receiving less recognition than his performances merit.  I place him in the same category I place Jeff Bridges, an actor I believe gives an academy award winning performance almost every time he is on screen.
I had not seen this since its original release back in 1991, only remembering it as a ""good movie"".  It turned out to be a very fine film indeed!  Highly recommended.",1414454400,,690,4.822033898305085

For anyone who hasn't seen it, I would recommend this only if you aren't the critical type. I liked the premise and I'd heard good things about it, so I decided to check it out. VERY MILD SPOILER. I should have known I was in trouble when he brings the clown into his house. Guys like that (rich, powerful, ruthless, and lots of enemies) leave the clown on the ground and call the police. They might not even get out of their car to check it out, and they definitely don't bring it into their house. Admittedly, that's being picky, and I would have easily overlooked it, but it is literally the tip of the iceberg. Each sequence from this point on is built upon the previous and most would have been all but impossible to pull off in real life without serious risk to Douglas's life. The possibilities of what could have happened to him are endless, and no amount of ""explaining"" in the film changes that. Plus any number of their ""stunts"" could have drawn in the police and ended ""the game"". Like another reviewer said, this might have been awesome when I was eleven, but I found it pretty insulting as an adult. These guys got together, got baked, killed off the critical thinkers (if there were any) and then wrote this screenplay. Happens all the time, I'm sure. What's amazing is that they actually got the film made.",1407369600,6,1452,4.483018867924528

The level of embarrassing desperation and childish stubborness is absolutely glorious to watch. Coming from an esteemed actor usually portraying strong hero types, this was an inspired choice.  I forgive David Fincher for Alien3 because of this film. I live in San Fran and it hasn't been shot this beautifully since Hitchock was behind the camera. Fantastic cast, fantastic film. I'm so happy Criterion chose this to add to its cannon. I do feel like this film was lost in a mix of more commercial films at the time of it's release. I saw it in theaters as a last minute choice on a slow weekend afternoon going only on its poster. I loved it. A truly wonderful suprise. Exciting, tense, mysterious. Absolutely wonderful. Reminded me of a game could buy in the 90's that would actually call you to leave mysterious game hints and send you emails with more clues. Very creepy.",1405123200,,1010,4.771428571428571

up tight, rigid investment banker whose given a very real to life crazy game given to him by his brother, Sean Penn. Michael Doughlas finds hisself in all kinds of dangerous real life situations, which, is really a game !!! His father in the beginning of the movie had committed suicide when Michael Douglas was a small boy. He grew up very rich and depressed. had been married and
divorced with no children. You would have to see this film in order to appreciate my description of it. It is indeed a cliff hanger and a
movie where you are on the edge of your seat. Michael Douglas is one of the finest actors and sexiest actors in hollywood and plays these types of character quite well.  Sean Penn, is another great actor. Probably one of the finest actors in the world. He has great range and depth in every character he plays in. Madonna eat your heart out !!!  Mrs. Dione  L.

929317,5,6304795254,What a rare and suspenseful movie this is. The Game keeps you guessing and holds your attention. I wish more movies like this were made as the thriller genre has kind of died out. Douglas as usual is believable and a strong lead. He's the everyday man we can sympathise with and he never takes you out of a scene with shoddy acting. The setup of the movie is superb as we're given vague clues about what The Game actually entails and if it will even play a role in the main character's life. Kudos to the filmmakers for not rushing this early aspect. The story begins to build tension as we wonder if the so-called Game is behind the bizarre and dangerous situations that start to happen in Michael Douglas's life. A surprise ending ties it all together and answers all your questions.,1398384000,2,785,4.458333333333333

The vandalism of his house, the taking of his finances, creating paranoia, attempting to murder him via drowning, drugging him and then making him find his way back from another country, and then the play on a sensitive issue relating to his fathers death.

929606,4,6304795254,"The Game (David Fincher, 1997)
[originally posted 16Oct2000]

Having now seen The Game, I've seen (aside from a few of the music videos) everything David Fincher has put his hand to. And now I'm even more depressed about the last five minutes of Fight Club, because to a one, all of Fincher's other films are purely fantastic from beginning to end.

The Game follows Nicholas van Orton (Michael Douglas) through the eight days following his forty-eighth birthday. Van Orton's father committed suicide on his forty-eighth birthday, so Nicholas' deadbeat brother, Conrad (Sean Penn), decides to get him a really bang-up birthday present: a game from a shadowy company that's tailored to each player. All well and good, but after a day or so, Nicholas is starting to wonder whether it's a game at all, and exactly how far these people will go to protect their identities and create the fantasy world into which they're pushing Nicholas.

Fincher's trademarks are all heredarkness, claustrophobia, quick camera cuts, little tricks that heighten the suspense for the viewer and allow him to identify a little better with the character the movie is following. It's wonderful stuff, aside from one little nagging out-of-character piece (Michael Douglas' character really is a complete jerk, and one wonders why he'd have ever agreed to get involved with The Game in the first place), but by the end of the film, that particular question is lost in the dust that the rest of the movie manages to kick up. It's not on the same reality-jarring level as Se7en was; more along the lines of Fincher's earlier contribution to the Alien series: a whole lot of fun, a great way to kill two and a half hours, and a movie that kind of manages to leave you feeling both good and slightly nauseated at the end. All that was missing were the big, gooey monsters. *** ",1386806400,,1846,4.832278481012659
929607,5,6304795254,"You have to be able to let yourself be absorbed by this movie. If you can't maintain a reasonable (sometimes unreasonable) suspension of disbelief, don't bother; you will not like it. There are quite a lot of very far-fetched scenarios in this film, some that certainly could never happen in real life but it is, after all, a movie. It blurs the line between thriller and fantasy pretty well in my opinion.

Acting is excellent, film itself is shot almost impeccably and the story is superbly written. Mr. Fincher has created an atmosphere in which you are never certain of what's going on, driving your curiosity until the very end of the movie.

My only con for this movie is the soundtrack. It's not terrible and it certainly suits the movie but it's sometimes a little distracting during suspenseful scenes.",1386806400,,811,4.785714285714286

929744,5,6304795254,"Please note: This review is for the Criterion Blu-ray of ""The Game"" and, if you are reading it under another listing, it's because Amazon has combined reviews.

David Fincher's ""The Game"" takes us and the main character the cold, aloof and wealthy Nicholas Van Orten (Michael Douglas) on a Hitchcockian thrill ride. Van Orten finds his structured, well manicured life suddenly very messy and unpredictable after he is given an unusual gift by his brother Conrad (Sean Penn)for his birthday. Conrad hands him a card with a phone number that, when Van Orten calls it, pulls him into a live action game where his life is threatened and his whole life is turned upside down, inside out.

That isn't to say that ""The Game"" is perfect. Watching the film for the first time, you'll get caught up in trying to put together the puzzle. Is Van Orten's life in danger? Are those around him to be trusted? On later viewings, you'll discover that there are flaws in the plot but you can at least enjoy the ride. (especially if you can suspend your disbelief)

The Criterion edition of this well regarded thriller boasts a beautifully rendered transfer. Personally supervised by director of photography Harris Sevides and approved by director Fincher. Detail is remarkably sharp throughout and there's no noticeable visual imperfections.

The audio presentation is quite good with two tracks--the former a Theatrical DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track and a Near Field DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track. The latter is carried over from the original laserdisc that Criterion did back in the day which was designed with a home theater sound system in mind.

As with all Criterion editions we get some terrific special features many of them are carried over from the original laserdisc that was released over fifteen years ago. The commentary track features the director Fincher, star Michael Douglas, writers John Brancato  (recorded together)and Michael Ferris, DP Savides, production designer Jeffrey Beecroft and visual effects supervisor Kevin Haug.

Fincher's alternate ending is also presented (and is in its complete, raw form--including the slate at the beginning of the take).

We also get four sequences that compare storyboards to the finished film presented split screen. These four sequences are also presented again (without the split screen comparison) with optional commentary with behind-the-scenes footage. The uncut psychological visual ""test"" that Van Orten is given is presented in full (it is, however, presented without a commentary or any soundtrack for that matter).

Finally the last extras include the teaser trailer, and full trailer are presented with an optional commentary track.  As with all Criterion titles we get a booklet with an essay. I found the booklet to be less extensive than many other titles and the insights fall into two categories--quite good and quite a stretch categories.

My only complaint about this set is that we don't anything new in the way of special features. It would be nice to have a discussion with those who made the film looking at it again 16 years after the original release of the film.

""The Game"" receives a top notch high definition transfer as well as including the special features from the original laserdisc release.",1384560000,6,3266,5.106941838649155

He , in actuality was 53 when he made this movie as he was born Michael Kirk Douglas on September 25th, 1944. Most movies are made a year before their theatrical release. So , let's say he was 52 to be fair. A 4 long years cry from 48 years old. I guess he could play the role of a 48 year old at 52 or 53 I guess. But , play a role closer to your age , which I guess whoever is reading this might think Michael is closer to that age & a majority , if not everyone will think that age is nothing , but a number. Those who think that must be really geriatrically old to say & think that. Great movie though , but why not have the movie set on Michael's character turning 52 or 53. That would be more believable & more realistic. Not 48. Not when fans who are true fans of him know his real age in real life.",1377907200,,938,3.8153846153846156

929922,5,6304795254,"It's hard to review David Fincher's psychological thriller The Game without running the risk of giving away the twists and turns in this tense thriller. Let's backtrack a moment and consider Fincher's previous film, the harrowing Se7en. Though he had directed Alien 3 in 1992, 1995's Se7en upped the ante in the dread department. Though a great film in its own right, Se7en was, in a certain sense, a working out of ideas that came to fruition in The Game. And though Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman acquitted themselves very well in Se7en, Michael Douglas delivers a tour de force performance in The Game. In retrospect, it's hard to imagine anyone else soaking that character with as much self-loathing, guilt, arrogance and hostility. Douglas had already demonstrated his acting chops with Wall Street and Falling Down, so it's no great surprise that he was able to stand his ground against Fincher's twisting and shocking plot turns. And this plot sneaks up on you, subtle in the beginning then delivering massive blows to your emotions and sense of equilibrium. It's a testament to Douglas and Sean Penn's acting chops that they make this wild ride not only seem plausible but suffocatingly real. The first time I watched the film I remember grabbing my chair, all white knuckles at more than one point, gripped by Douglas' hallucinogenic ride. When a friend asked me what other films I'd seen that reminded me of this I couldn't honestly say. This was simply a brilliant one-off by Fincher and Douglas and a film that surprisingly, given that it relies on plot twists the viewer can't see coming, reveals subtle pleasures in repeat viewings.",1375315200,,1644,4.91726618705036

930033,3,6304795254,"This movie is fun to watch and by being as sometimes unsettling as it is and often very frustrating the thing kind of pulls your psychological chain in an entertaining way, even though it is about as implausible as the most wild of sci-fi movies.

However, technically I had problems with my DVD copy (stock number 22447). I watched it a couple of years back when I still did not an HDMI hookup and I used the three-wire, component-video alternative. My set (a Samsung) easily expanded the non-anamorphic image to fill out my 56-inch screen, and so THAT time it was a pleasure to watch, in spite of the loss of resolution with that kind of low-tech letterboxing.

However, I recently watched it again (or, rather, tried to watch it), this time with a full HDMI connection from my player. Guess what? My Samsung TV actually LOSES some of its image-expansion and shaping abilities with the HDMI feed, and so the best I could do with the movie was watch it with the 4:3 setting, which delivered a reduced-size wide-screen image in the middle of the TV screen.

What this movie needs (and perhaps later versions have it) is a true anamorphic squeeze, so that not only do we get more resolution with the image ""un-squeezed,"" but also so that my Samsung TV's more high-tech image expansion feature with the HDMI hookup will work properly.

The version I have is too retro-tech, in spite of the THX certification, to operate to best effect with an HDMI link - at least with my set. Admittedly, the 5.1 sound quality was excellent.

I am reluctant to purchase a replacement via Amazon, because I fear that what will be delivered will have the same limitations as the copy I have now.",1373328000,,1675,4.60738255033557

I hit not one, but two cars in a parking lot near my house and received a notice from my insurance company about their ""On Your Side Repair Program"", which is pure fantasy, and yes, surrealistic. The body shop guy didn't show up to tow my car. And when I went to my house, two men were taking my house apart and left with all the water turned off. After viewing The Game, I realized that all my problems were minor compared to those of Investment Banker Nicholas van Orton (aka Michael Douglas) of San Francisco, who lost 600 million dollars in his investment accounts. If you don't know San Francisco, we see a sign for Sansome Street, which is in the financial district, followed by a shot of Lombard Street, well known as the most crooked street in the US. Then his world begins to crumble. The song White Rabbit by Grace Slick of Jefferson Airplane at the end of the film was totally appropriate, and yes, surrealistic.
If you're not familiar with surrealism, it was a big movement in Europe in art and literature during the last century. If you saw the painting of limp watches by Salvador Dali, it was surrealistic.

  everything ?

  For wealthy Nicholas Van Orton, that  may be a  question
  that turned his life of  stock options, IPO's, arbitrage,
  tuxedo banquets for his strategic clients, and endless lonely
  dinners at his kitchen table, into a  nightmare  without
  end.

  His all-but-estranged brother, Conrad,  has  blown  into
  San Francisco, to honor Nick with a  birthday  present:
  a  birthday present that will  send his life careening
  around corners, down dark alleys, dropping  from light
  poles  into  garbage  dumpsters, a  trip through  the
  streets of  San Francisco  with  an  insane  cab  driver,
  and  into  the  life of  a  beautiful and mysterious girl
  that  calls  herself ""Christine"". Or....is  it  the  other
  way  around ?

  Van Orton's  48th  birthday is just two days away, and
  his  dignified and too-quiet life  is  unraveling  before
  his  eyes.  After  a  shattering  visit with  Christine,
  he  finds  that  six hundred  million dollars  seems  to
  missing  from  a  special  Swiss  account.

  Is  Christine the  "" X factor "" ?

  Things, strange things, are happening to him, that seem
  to surround an enigma known as CRS: Consumer  Rec-
  reation  Services.

  Michael Douglas  (TRAFFIC), Sean Penn ( MYSTIC RIVER), Deborah Kara Unger,
  Carroll Baker, and  Armin Mueller-Stahl (THE MUSIC BOX)( are  all  imbedded
  in this  mystery  turned  inside-out.

  Once you've started this picture, like  Nick Van Orton, you'll  be  swept
  up in it, and  you'll know  that  there's  no going back.

  Director  David  Fincher ( ALIEN 3)  expertly plants seeds of  paranoia,
  chaos, dread, and  the  feeling  that  someone is  turning  reality into a
  drama about a man whose life is  becoming a  study of  the  bizarre.

  But...don't ask what's the object  of  the game....Finding out the
  object  of the  game,  is,  the  object  of  the game.

  Chaos, like  gold  and  silver, is  where  you  find  it.  And
  you'll  find  plenty  in  ""The Game"".

  Even  Daniel  Schorr, the  newscaster, is in on the  action.

  If  I  were  you, I  wouldn't  blink,  after  the  credits
  roll...

930334,4,6304795254,"David Fincher manages to take this story and screenplay (John Brancato & Michael Ferris) and makes it almost believable.  The film is a mash-up between Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"" and Philip K. Dick's ""Total Recall.""  Michael Douglas is very good in the Scrooge-like role of Nicholas Van Orton, a high powered San Francisco investment banker.  He's very wealthy, probably in the top 1/2%, let alone 1%.

He's also very lonely and seemingly unhappy.  As a surprise, his gadfly, devil-may-care younger brother, Conrad (Sean Penn) shows up and gives him a gift certificate for his 48th birthday.  It requires Nicholas  to show up for a series of interviews which allows a company called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS) to design a ""game"" for him.  You know, it's for the man who has everything.

When Nick gets a phone call advising him CRS won't be able to work with him, he thinks nothing of it.  What he doesn't know is that the game has just begun.  Like Douglas Quaid in ""Total Recall,"" Nick isn't quite sure what is going on.  He is put in physical, financial and mental danger.  The film is beautifully shot and has surprise after surprise.  Eventually Nick and the rest of us catch on.

But what is real and what is part of the game, is sometimes hard to discern.  The story tends to jump-the-shark in the final act which left me shaking my head.  Still, ""The Game"" is a well-made film with some solid acting, great sets and photography and an invigorating score by Howard Shore.  The Criterion version is certainly a significant upgrade from the DVD in terms of picture and sound.",1355097600,5,1590,4.72

This Criterion edition of The Game on Blu-Ray is a huge step up from the budget release I previously owned on DVD. The transfer seems to be a new one as a lot of the black crush in the many dim scenes present on the DVD release are nowhere to be found.

When Sean Penn disappears early in the movie you know right away that he's behind all of it, and then at the end when he pops up and it's all a big joke, I would have shot him right there. Rarely have I left a theater pissed off but to have everything that happens explained away in the end as just a big elaborate practical joke, I just felt cheated.

930338,5,6304795254,"On its 15th anniversary, The Game has been given its best treatment ever by the good folks at The Criterion Collection - it's never looked or sounded better!

I missed this movie in the theaters in 1997 but saw it immediately upon its video release and it instantly became one of my favorite thrillers.  Michael Douglas is spot-on as an emotionally detached, wealthy investment banker given an unusual birthday gift from his younger brother.  I actually prefer this performance over the similar but more bombastic role of Gordon Gekko.  As Nicholas Van Orton, Douglas gets to breathe a full range of emotion into his character and he really makes the most of it.  Sean Penn is great as usual as Van Orton's unstable brother Connie and Deborah Kara Unger turns in a strong performance as a mystery woman who may or may not be on Van Orton's side.

Where to rank this among David Fincher's other great films is hard to say (it's my 2nd favorite) but I would say that it is the most overlooked.  I don't know if that's because of the simplistic name of the film, how it was marketed or something else entirely but like The Shawshank Redemption, it seem seems to be one of those films that most people discovered far beyond its initial release.  Having just watched it again, I was delighted to see that it had not aged a bit - something that cannot be said of other films of the 90s which are already showing their age.

As I said, the film has never looked better.  It was never given very good treatment on video as it was (and that's being charitable) but this version hits it out of the park.  The dark scenes that dominate the film are more clear than ever and Fincher's use of colored light has dramatic impact.  Special features include 5 major set detail pieces exclusive to Criterion, trailer, teaser and audio commentary from all the principals throughout.  It also includes an alternate ending that I'm thankful they didn't use.  If you're a fan of this film, this Criterion release is essential.

Lastly, a little about the plot itself.  There's not much that can be said without ruining the film's twists and turns but I cannot agree with the films few detractors who found it ""too clever"" or worse, those to whom it didn't make sense.  Watch it again; it's pretty much all there within the scenes & the dialogue.  Can you poke holes in parts of it?  Of course you can, but I've yet to see a film where that is not the case - life itself has lapses of reason.  What I like about The Game is that it does a more than adequate job of providing a tether to reality while it creates a mysterious world of its own - as long as you're willing to play along.",1354406400,40,2661,4.458677685950414

930409,5,6304795254,"David Fincher has always had a loyal fan base. His films have been winning people over for twenty years with films like ""Fight Club"" and ""Se7en"" developing a cult-like following. Criterion Collection's release of ""The Game"" feels like some lucky schmuck discovered diamonds in an abandoned coal mine. Now remastered with loads of special features, ""The Game"" continues Fincher's near flawless streak of impeccable filmmaking.

Films that are capable of making you think and turning your brain inside out are personal favorites; ""Inception,"" ""Oldboy,"" ""The Machinist,"" and ""Fight Club"" are spectacular examples. ""The Game"" can be categorized right along with the best of them. Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) is a successful investment banker complete with Swiss bank accounts, fancy cars, and a huge house; Nicholas has it all. But he was noticeably unhappy and the death of his father from when he was a boy still haunts him.

On his 48th birthday, his ex-wife Elizabeth (Anna Katarina) along with all of his co-workers and his maid Ilsa (Carroll Baker) wish him a happy birthday but Nicholas views it as just another day. That is until his brother Conrad (Sean Penn) introduces him to CRS - Consumer Recreational Services. Shrouded in secrecy, Nicholas has no idea what to expect. Little does he realize that his life is about to be on the line along with his fortune.

The choreography in this psychological thriller is brilliant. It helps establish the rich atmosphere of the film whether it's the fluorescent hum of office building lighting, the slow rotating shots as Nicholas eats his birthday dinner in his home, or the incredible break-in sequence filled with graffiti that's infused by black lighting. Just like all of Fincher's work, it pulls you in so easily. The story is constantly engaging. It's nearly impossible to predict how far this game is going to go and at what lengths Nicholas will go to discover the truth.

The performances are fantastically solid. Michael Douglas does an excellent job of portraying a man who once had everything and basically has nothing by the end of the film. While Sean Penn has a small amount of screen time, his performance is different every time he shows up; calm and collected, frantic and borderline insane, and eventually the understanding brother. It's also worth paying particular attention to Deborah Kara Unger because it's so difficult to determine just whose side the Christine character is on.

Well-written, expertly paced, and undeniably riveting, ""The Game"" is perhaps most impressive in the way it strips down the Nicholas Van Orton character. The whole process is very layered and each layer breaks down Nicholas even more than the last. Never seeing the film beforehand certainly helped, but Criterion Collection's release of ""The Game"" is definitely a must own.

The Criterion Collection director-approved special edition Blu-ray includes a new, restored digital transfer, supervised by director of photography Harris Savides with original theatrical 5.1 surround soundtrack and presented in DTS-HD Master Audio, Alternate 5.1 surround mix optimized for home theater viewing, supervised by sound designer Ren Klyce and presented in DTS-HD Master Audio, Audio Commentary by director David Fincher, actor Michael Douglas, screenwriters John Brancato and Michael Farris, director of Photography Harris Savides, production designer Jeffrey Beecroft, and visual effets supervisor Kevin Haug, an Alternate Ending, an hour's worth of behind the scenes footage and film-to storyboard comparisons for four of the film's major set pieces (Dog Chase, The Taxi, Christine's House, The Fall), the Psychological Test Film in its entirety, the teaser and trailer of the film with optional commentary, and a booklet featuring an essay by film critic David Sterritt.",1349481600,3,3824,5.312396694214876

The bad - unfortuantely there are not many special features on this disc. I have been a huge fan of the movie for the last decade-plus and was hoping for some great extras, but there wasn't much and what was included was not anything mind blowing. This is why it's getting a 4/5 from me instead of a 5.

The fun - the one feature it does have (which was only available on laserdisc before this) is the alternate ending.

This great thriller is one of the better films by David Fincher (SEVEN wins the best) and Criterion has treated us to the best this dark movie has ever looked! This was always a hard film to transfer to home video and I was scared to risk getting another retread transfer. The first being the awesome Laserdisc from Criterion and the last on a horrible looking HD-DVD. I am glad I took the risk and upgraded to the Criterion blu ray. This is one fabulous looking visual feast. The detail in the dark picture is unbelievable. Have always been unable to see what is going on. Not anymore. I don't know how Criterion did it, but you can see in the darkness without the blacks looking gray. And they tweaked the color where the Polygram DVD looked golden colored. Just make sure you watch this in a dimly lit room because most of this movie is dark. It is presented in its original 2.35 Super 35 widescreen format. With two soundtracks in DTS-HD. The ""newest"" being an alternate 5.1 optimized for home theater. Looks like most of the special features are carried over from Criterion's Laserdisc (like the commentary), except for this fantastic looking transfer and this wonderful newer soundtrack. I can't say it enough: upgrade to the blu ray if you are a fan of this thriller. I realize it is costly, but with Criterion you shouldn't be disappointed.
Just wished Criterion would get the rights to release SEVEN on blu ray. Their Laserdisc was awesome back in the day and the Warner blu ray can't touch the brilliance that Criterion brought to that dark movie.

930508,5,6304795254,"Reviewing the Criterion version of the film:

David Fincher is my favorite director. Aside from his first two films, I've seen every one in order of their release and each film strengthen my admiration for his work. ""The Game"" would have been the 2nd or 3rd film I saw from him and absolutely loved it. I guessed until the last scene and was engrossed and excited for the whole thing.

I had this film on DVD for a while. It was the United States release which had no features whatsoever, it wasn't even formatted for widescreen TVs (the anamorphic image was shrunk down to fit inside a 4:3 ratio). I did not have a laserdisc player for the Criterion laserdisc, nor did I have an all-region player to get the DVD that at least had commentary. Meanwhile, each new film would come out on a DVD that was not only packed with special features, but had amazing packaging too. I love the care and treatment Fincher's films get from beginning to being in the hands of a consumer. (The only exception being Se7en which took a while to come out in a special 2-disc edition, having me wait even after Fight Club was released).

But even then... The Game DVD remained for me a not only boring but frustrating DVD experience without any features, with a boring, ugly case. Finally, Criterion came through and released a spectacular DVD.

Commentary, 1-hour making of video comprised of several locations, each with optional commentary, storyboard to film comparison, teaser trailer and trailer with optional commentary, a booklet and a fantastic design for the case artwork. My ONLY issue with the casing is that the two DVDs sit atop one another. If you want to watch Disc 2, you have to take out Disc 1 to do so. Kind of a bummer having to remove both discs, especially for me who likes to keep a DVD in it's case as much as possible if I'm not watching it to avoid any scratches.

Still though, so glad to have this DVD, even if Criterion decided to have a 50% off sale after I ordered it (boo!) But I'd pay almost any price for it. Because I love Fincher. I love The Game and I love the care Criterion put into their releases.",1348617600,,2118,4.462532299741602

But I must admit you are not let down when the film does end. I like most of Michael Douglas films so this one is no exception, so I would certainly recomend this one.",1347148800,2,343,3.7777777777777777

930512,5,6304795254,"Michael Douglas does one of the best jobs in his career playing the wealthy-but-jaded investment banker, Nicolas Van Orton, a man who tells his secretary, ""You don't know about society, so you don't have the pleasure of avoiding it."" Divorced and living alone in his magnificent San Francisco mansion, Nicolas is enduring yet another birthday (his 48th, the same age his father was when he committed suicide) when he receives an unexpected visit from his younger brother, Conrad (a gleefully-going-for-broke Sean Penn), the black sheep of the family with a history of drug use. Conrad looks good, though, and he comes bearing an unusual birthday gift: a game.

What follows is a chaotic, uncertain series of events that could be anything: social terrorism, a massive con, financial sabotage, or the world's most elaborate mind game. Run by a company called Consumer Recreation Services (or CRS), the game ends up infecting every aspect of Nicolas's life, from chance encounters with homeless men to the guy who reads the evening news. Nicolas's mind and life fray ever further as he struggles to figure out just what is going on. He is given an 800 number at the start of the game and told, ""Do not call asking for the object of the game. Figuring that out is the object of the game.""

Others have argued about plotholes in the script -- the game is unbelievably complex in both its planning and execution, and it relies on events adhering to a finely-tuned sense of timing and place -- but these concerns are dealt with deftly by the dialogue if you're paying attention. Ultimately, the point of the film -- what it takes to re-engage with life (let's just say it costs someone an exorbitant amount of money and someone else an exorbitant amount of pain) -- is so beautifully managed by Fincher's meticulous directing that whatever questions you might have about the reality of it all take a backseat to the intricate and masterful psychology of the whole thing. Maybe the point is that -- like the Bible says -- it is easier for a camel to enter the eye of a needle than it is for a rich man to enter heaven, even if heaven is just another word for whatever joy there is to find in life, be it family, friends, or love.

Enjoy the ride, then watch it and enjoy it again. Each viewing, for me, reveals even more attention to detail and continues to be -- as it was when I first saw it -- a rewarding experience. Even still, as one character says, ""I wish I could go back and do it again for the first time."" I can't do that with this film, but the message of the movie is that even when life feels like it has been lived to the end, maybe -- no matter how outrageous the cost -- there is a way to go back and start it over again.

Film Buff Factoid: Pay close attention to the end of the film for a blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo by Spike Jonze.",1346889600,8,2846,4.50968992248062

930514,3,6304795254,"Michael Douglas accepts an invitation to join a mysterious exclusive ""recreation activity"" at the insistence of his loser brother, and is then thoroughly terrorized by the game makers. It's a mile-a-minute barrel ride over the edge of a waterfall, with the audience left in the dark right alongside the protagonist. Young director David Fincher plays up the suspense gorgeously, but isn't quite able to compensate for a few inherent flaws with the premise. First and foremost is Douglas's leading part, a thoroughly unlikeable one-percenter who's such a Scrooge it's impossible to grow too invested in his fate. In a way it's cathartic to see him tormented by such a brutal series of twists and turns, especially in the afterglow of the Wall Street bailout, but the film goes out of its way to paint him as a sort of tragic hero. The plot's reckless yanks on the steering wheel, too, aren't all they're cracked up to be. Those constant swerves provide a great series of unpredictable thrills, but ultimately ring hollow when our suspension of disbelief is nudged too far beyond the coincidental. The entire closing sequence, in particular, is just so dependent on things happening in precisely the right place, at precisely the right time, in precisely the right way, that it left me questioning the validity of everything that had come before.

I expected to see more explaining at the end of the movies. The character Christine said to Van Orton (Michael Douglas) that there is a ""safety net"" on every plot and scene in the game. But how the safety net was done is never known. It was as if the game has proceeded in a very precise path, without unexpected twists on Van Orton's part.

However, towards the climax of the film, the rug is rudely ripped out from under the feet of the viewer as we are now treated to a film that decided to be a thinking man's thriller. In order for the Game to be a thriller, there would have to be genuine thrills instead of jaw-droppingly pallid scenes involving Douglas plunging to near-certain death only to ""miraculously"" survive. Apparently, the filmmaker has mistaken roller-coaster ride style shocks for thrills of a psychological bent.

The pseudo twist ending made the film an incoherent mess and failed to invite the viewer to reflect at all. And I watched this film closely.

You give them nothing, or at least the experience of nothing.  I took in this movie with a pair of studio headphones with some good enhancements and didn't miss a single line just in case people wondered if ""I actually watched the movie"".  Yes, it all worked out in the end, but to be honest, I probably would not have taken the conclusion as well if this experience happened to me personally.  I would have been filled with wrath that someone would manipulate my emotions like that by making me believe I killed someone close to me regardless of their intentions.  I definitely would not be partying until I could recover my sanity.  That is really the only thing about this movie is how quickly Nick regains his composure after the conclusion.  It just didn't seem realistic.  I think a tad more drama between him and his bro via a shouting match a la ""How could you do this to me?"" with everyone looking on in awe should have ensued and maybe tearful verbal explanation bringing up issues from the past that may have affected their present before the big hug would have made it seem a bit more real to me.

930632,2,6304795254,"I will get out in the open that I consider David Fincher one of the freshest and more mature voices of this generation of film directors.  He is a marvelous storyteller and he understands how to mesh style with substance in remarkable ways.

Sadly, `The Game' is easily his weakest effort.

Really, `The Game' fails in areas outside of the direction, which is very well orchestrated despite the film's many limitations.  The tension is amicable and reminds me a lower end De Palma film actually; a little copy-cattish and not at all original but effective for the most part.  Michael Douglas is always adept to playing a self-absorbed business man, and he nails that side of character with ease, but he also grapples with the growing panic and eventual paranoia of his character very well.  I'll admit, I was impressed, especially since I consider Douglas an actor of minimal range.  The rest of the cast is slightly laughable.  James Rebhorn is awful here and Sean Penn, while utilizing his youthful charisma, is a tad overdone in some scenes (his paranoid breakdown lacks real conviction) and Deborah Kara Unger is about as convincing as a two-by-four.

I'll say that the film's biggest asset is easily the production designers who really worked great angles at making this an entrenched thriller.  Those sets are outstanding.

But really, the film's ultimate downfall is the ridiculous screenplay.  The film is just a preposterous mess, and while suspension of disbelief is best used in film's like this, the pure ridiculous of the plot itself it just irritating.  I thought that the initial concept seemed intriguing (the whole `hand someone a profound life experience in the form of a game they don't understand but have to play out') but the way in which the script fleshes itself is so full of plot holes and lapses in possibility that it is a complete mess.

Skip this; it's dumb.",1329782400,7,1888,4.859375

Douglas of course seems to enjoy playing a seemingly unlikeable character in both films but in ""The Game"" he finds himself in a web of contradictions.  Perhaps the unconventionality of the film turned off Douglas fans and they opted for the former but if you like your intellect and senses challenged, do check out this original film.

It is all about HIS journey that will teach him many things about life itself. He went from being in control of everything  finances, safety, commodity, friendships, trust) from being a millionaire to being a no body, to be humbled , to feel hunger, to feel insecurity, to feel despair, to feel fear, to feel poor.

930710,4,6304795254,"I believe 'Game' falls into the 'Action-Adventure' genre a genre which, very generally speaking, leaves me nonplussed because of multiple unlikelihoods or out-and-out impossibiities.  On the other hand, 'Game' is well acted and scripted and held my attention from the beginning to the end.  The Michael Douglas character--a highly successful and [to me] rather unlikeable millionaire --volunteers to play a real-life 'game' the rules and nature of which he doesn't understand.  He is told by his brother and others that 'The Game' and its results, will really jazz up his constrained life.  The implication, of course, is that his life will be 'improved.'

'The Game' involves multiple harrowing adventures bound to increase the paranoia titer in any normal human being.  Implicit in the film, is that the Douglas-character's survival is always under close control of the Gramers.  I don't see it that way.  There are multiple incidents in which Douglas' behavior--and survival--is largely controlled by chance rather than the gamers.  Add them up and Douglas should die or be physically destroyed not once, but multiple times.

In a sense, however, this is fairly typical of Action-Adventure films.  The final unlikelihood is that Douglas' life will be 'improved' by a succession of horrific events that could easily unmask a hidden psychosis, bare minimum.  It is definitely difficult to understand how such events could improve anyone's life.

More realistically, Douglas is obliged to pay real dollars for 'fun' that would necessarily have cost millions.  Like I said, it is difficult to see how this would have improved his or anyone else's life.",1306022400,,1651,5.3

It's well acted, and it will keep you at the edge of your seat wanting to know what the ending will be. The main character may even resemble someone you know. Nicholas (played by Michael Douglas) is sort of a boring but rich, middle-aged man who feels himself to be superior to his wild and less stable brother Conrad (played by Sean Penn). As a birthday gift, Conrad gets Nicholas a chance to play ""The Game"", in hopes that it will change Nicholas's life for the better.

Throughout the film, you are taken on a suspenseful and rather violent adventure. When you reach the end, however, you find out the twist, and it is rather disappointing considering all the blood, sweat, and tears Nicholas had to go through to play the ""game"". I understand that Conrad was hoping the ""game"" would enrich his brother, but he could have done that without threatening the safety of his life. Sure, this is just a movie, so it's okay that the ending is unrealistic given everything that happened, but the movie still takes itself seriously in communicating that sometimes people need thrills to positively change their life. But frankly, I don't see how that would work if the thrills end your life rather than change it. There are other movies out there that more effectively express that one should cherish their life more.

Warning: The DVD version is all that is currently available in widescreen (unless you have one of those discontinued format 'HD DVD' players).

There are bars all-around the image (yes, right and left sides too!)  I believe that's because it was not been scaled as Anamorphic widescreen - but, for whatever reason, this is very annoying to watch on a quality widescreen TV.

Well, a partial answer to that would be a deluxe DVD edition or, heaven forbid, a blu-ray release! I've only ever seen old, bare bones releases of the film. While a turkey like Alien 3 get the deluxe treatment as well as infinitely better films (than Alien 3) like Seven and Fight Club have had multiple releases, I can't understand why The Game is stuck with, really, a lousy DVD release.

If I had been the wealthy business man character and I had a younger brother like that I would not have been so forgiving. That is the problem for me with this movie. I think not all things are forgivable even within the frame of family, while the producer says all is forgivable, and to forgive is supreme even in the face of total garbage. The premise remains all consuming even though the film is filmed with excellent technical skill and the acting is perfect. The overall concept is just wrong.

Nicholas Van Orton lives a cold, sterile life, haunted by the suicide of his father which has indelibly marked him as a child who witnessed it - he can't get it out of his mind.

His birthday is coming up, another one of them he doesn't see any use for.  Everyone wishes him well, from a distance, because that is what is required of anyone who knows him.  His estranged little brother, Conrad, the exact opposite of himself in personality, but who also had personal issues he had to deal with, calls him, posing as an old friend, Seymore Butts - because he obviously thinks that's the only way the invitation will be accepted since his social standing has suffered in comparison with his successful, distant older brother - requesting his presence at dinner.  This does draw a sort of smile from the cast iron face of Nicholas, and he sets it up through his secretary.  A painful dinner conversation ensues, and the roguish little brother presents Nicholas with a gift - a gift certificate to play a reality game, although nothing is known or revealed about it.  He thinks it's a bunch of hooey, but it's paid for, so he decides what the heck.

Things happen rapidly from there on and it is best to not reveal the plot, mainly because it's impossible.  But there is a message if one wants to look for it through the fray.

My Summary:  It was an action flick with an embedded message:  Life is what you make it and you need to live it while it is in front of you rather than using crutches or casting blame for things you cannot control.  That may be easier said than done but the concept is a truth.  You don't need drugs, alcohol or psychiatrists because real life is a trip of it's own if you have the nerve to go for it - no excuses, and the devil take the hindmost.  But you DO need to live it and enjoy it;  you DO need love and your own people around you or the whole thing is for nothing.  And sometimes that should be worthy of a self-analysis before it's too late.",1246060800,,2112,4.3063291139240505

However..I purchased this movie for a hearing impaired relative of mine based on the fact that Amazon's Product Details description CLEARLY states..

There are in fact NO English subtitles, but only Spanish. And my relative now has a movie that is totally useless to her!

Some of the best storytelling, historically, starts off with a quick preface of sorts that gives some foreshadow or insight into something that's going to unfold in front of you in a very insidious way. Most of the time, the majority of observers and readers never see any of it coming. And that's always the point of it, too.

In the case of `The Game', I think it's safe to say now that no one saw any of it coming and there was nothing predictable about what David Fincher was trying to pull off. Those that say something to the contrary are probably lying to save face. Those folks might also tell you that they saw Bruce Willis being dead in `The Six Sense', too. Don't get mad if I spoiled it for you with either film, it's been over a decade for both - you should've seen it.

So what kind of a mind would even think to envision something as dark as CRS and all that follows? Fincher pulls out all the stops and beats the viewer with a stick from the first moment to the very end.  And to his credit and not detriment, either.  Fascination with the Godon Gecko archetype is about as timely now as any other time in history. I can see this film making a comeback of sorts either on cable or as a touchstone, with perhaps even a follow-up production to come.

The question is: ""What binds us together?"" -- Money? Reputation? Class division? Gold-plated lifestyle? Family? Love? Death? Apathy? It's a very simple question that leads us down a dark road to a very complicated answer with Sean Penn screaming at us in frustration. It's almost like a dream, or a nightmare depending on how you see the world. The idea of tinkering with a person's framework of mortality and whittling away at it slowly is enough to send the most hardened minds into a state of panic. Dead parents, suicide, invasion of privacy, paranoia, blackmail, embezzlement and so on. Watching the master of controlled emotions have his most epiphanic meltdown may be one of the great silver screen performances of all time, just because the emotions are so well documented. Peel away everything, at your expense, and let's see what's left is really the knock-out blow.

Every time I watch this film with someone, I always catch folks wiping their eyes because of the ending. This kind of emotional response is normal with this film and be prepared for several of them throughout. Critics often say the ending is cheap and creates problems with the storyline, but they're just upset at being forced into an emotional state.

The film opened during dark days and was derailed during its scheduled release because of the death of Princess Diana. Anyone with a subscription to the Los Angeles Times archives can go back and read the articles that covered the demise of the film, which was well-documented.

The film slipped through the theatres almost unnoticed and then vanished. The buzz was minimal but it did leave a lasting impression. I would bet more folks saw it on cable than anywhere else. People then talked about the idea of the film as something very novel and very original. IMDb message boards are full of requests from viewers to list other films that are like it. The lists are short. But several people through the millennia since have noted that John Fowles book `The Magus' is the unofficial originator. Having read the book, I don't believe it is, but there are similarities for sure and it's a very worthy and forgotten read to say the least.

Masterpiece of film? Yeah. Overlooked? Yeah. A worthy sequel from Fincher? Hope so.",1237680000,,3552,4.614896988906498
930855,5,6304795254,"Reading some of the reviews here what seems missing is what I believe is the essential theme of this work --- personal transformation.  Michael Douglas' character is trapped, or to be more precise stuck.  He is stuck at a level of personal development (mean spirited, suspicious, cynical, isolated and alone --- he is an Investment Banker) in which he is intensely dissatisfied with himself and all around him.  Though he does not realize it, he must move beyond his current ""self"" if he is to realize his full (though currently latent) potential as a human being.  His brother - Sean Penn - realizes this and hence gives him a ""game"" for his birthday  - since Penn the ""black sheep"" of the family had had a game given to him by some unnamed character and it had helped ""awaken"" him to a new self.

The game is the necessary transformative vehicle for Douglas' character which forces a reassessment of himself and his outlook on life --- but only through a complete breakdown and displacement of his current self and his connection with the world that he had made --- and had in turn now trapped him.

It is through the ensuing trauma and the culminating attempted suicide that allows him to emerge ""reborn"" and with a new outlook and new ""self"".  Thus the climactic and happy ending with the well wishers at his birthday party in spite of the fact that a moment ago he had just ""murdered"" his brother and leapt to his ""death"".

What this movie portrays is the classical mythological journey of trial and trauma where the old self is destroyed and a new self emerges like a beautiful butterfly from an ugly caterpillar.",1236038400,2,1619,4.6328671328671325

930860,5,6304795254,"Great movie! Most of the reviews indicate that most people see this as a movie about a man who plays a life-changing game given as a gift from a brother who also benefited from playing the game. I think it's really about a rich guy who never understood why his father committed suicide at the age of 48 and on his own 48th birthday he finds himself rich, but alone, miserable, depressed, and wondering how much he might be like his father, heading in the same direction (maybe toward suicide). His brother, knowing his rigid, responsible, analytical, and no-fun nature, and that he's miserable in spite of his wealth, tries to help him by giving him an unusual but life-changing gift, ""The Game"".

The story is great fun to follow, but the climactic ending is about how the man is finally driven to the brink of sanity playing this game, and falls (jumps) from a building to end the torment. When he actually ends up safe and at the expected outcome of the game, he realizes it was all to teach him 2 things in such a dramatic way as to change his life: Finally, an understanding of why his father could be driven to suicide (since he was himself driven to it).  And, that his wealth and life situation are tenuous, that he can now relax, not be so rigid and serious and begin to enjoy life again, before it's too late.

His brother understood that, by giving him the game as a gift, how it would help him so profoundly, because his brother had a life-changing experience playing the game.  We never find out how much the game cost the brother, but you figure it's gotta be, perhaps, millions. Don't try to pick the movie apart as being too unrealistic. Of course something like this is not meant to be real life.  A movie doesn't have to be real to be thoroughly enjoyed.  Sometimes, one's ability to let their imagination suspend reality briefly, also let's them thoroughly enjoy a movie like this. This is just a great story with a lesson. Isn't that what movies are supposed to be?

930861,4,6304795254,"Michael Douglas completely dominates ""The Game"", with nobody else, even Sean Penn, appearing in major minutes. He goes from the ""Greed is Good"" style investment banker, rich but alone, to a harried victim of ""The Game"", struggling to decide what is going on, and perhaps struggling for survival. Douglas' versatility is on solid display here, and he gets fine backup from the others.

I watched this the day after Batman (""Dark Knight"") and enjoyed this one more, except for Heath Ledger as ""Joker"". The action moves more swiftly and the script is tighter than Batman's, played more around the edges, even though Batman films are also dark. The film's goal was achieved: I was confused and wondering whether the ""game"" had really become an elaborate con with theft and murder involved.

My advice is to try ignoring the huge plot holes and implausibilities while watching. ""How could they do that?"" or ""How could they know Nicholas would do that?"" are fair questions, although not essential and not helpful. I don't know if the director is trying to claim our lives, even for a sophisticated person such as Nicholas, are so predictable. I would be depressed to experience a sequence of events such as these, where I was both easily controlled and easily anticipated, especially by people who didn't even know me before.

930862,4,6304795254,"In the Game director David Fincher would introduce many of the same themes he would expand upon in his next film Fight Club. Both films tell the tale of wealthy but bored men who feel dead inside, they don't feel like they belong or have any connection with anyone. Both men decide that they need a life changing experience to shake them out of their apathy and get them to start living again. In the case of the Game that lost man is Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) a multimillionaire who oversees a publishing company. On his forty eight birthday he gets a mysterious gift from his younger and irresponsible brother Conrad (Sean Penn). The gift is actually a gift card to a shadowy company called CRS and Nicholas has his reservations. He happens upon their headquarters by chance and is subjected to a barrage of mental and physical tests before he is even accepted. One of my favorite character actors James Rebhorn plays the man behind CRS Dr. Feingold. All Feingold will tell an inquisitive Nicholas is "" Admit to yourself that it sounds interesting. We provide what is lacking in your life."" Soon Nicholas's game begins and he finds his life in danger almost immediately. This film which could also be a sort of precursor to the Saw films as well has no graphic violence the torture is all psychological. Nicholas is haunted by the memory of his father who killed himself on Nicholas's birthday over thirty years ago and the fact that he was Nicholas's age when he did it weighs heavy on his mind. He wonders how much of his father is in him. Conrad who has battled drug addiction will only tell Nicholas that he too has played the Game and that he has never felt better. "" They make your life fun again."" is what he tells his younger brother. Nicholas does get some help in the form of Kathleen (Deborah Kara Unger) a waitress he meets along the way and who may know more about the Game than she lets on to Nicholas. The film has a fantastic ominous mood enhanced by the cinematography of Harris Savides and especially a jangling piano score from Howard Shore. To reveal too much of what happens to Nicholas during his Game would take away from several scenes that play like a nightmare. I loved the acting and the feel of the film but had a problem with the ending. I didn't find it completely believable and a little too convenient. Still the film is very good and Douglas in the lead does an amazing job as he slowly begins to unravel.

The story, although hard to swallow and farfetched, was exceptionally engaging and kept my interest from start to finish. I thought on my first viewing that this film would have a sequel, but was proven wrong by events.

THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION COULD RUIN ENJOYMENT OF THE PLOT:

Nicholas Van Orton played by Michael Douglas is a wealthy banker, but a loner who even spends his birthday away from people. In the year of his 48th birthday (the age his father committed suicide and on the verge of classic mid-life crisis) his distant brother gives Nicholas a card giving him entry to unusual entertainment provided by something called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). Giving in to curiosity, Nicholas visits CRS and all kinds of weird things start to happen to him. Prior to admitting him to participate he is required to take a series of mental and physical tests which were apparently run to determine his strengths, weaknesses, and perhaps map out some sort of efficient ""game plan"" tailored just for him. One statement I remember CRS telling him is that if you don't go to THE GAME, it will come to you.

He receives a phone call telling him that he failed the tests and is rejected by the organization. He forgets about CRS, but then overhears several people talking about ""the game"" and what life-changing opportunities it provides. He notices several such ""loud"" conversations in public, and goes to the trouble of introducing himself and speaking with a couple of apparently new members of his private club. All they will tell him is they wish they were just starting ""the game"" and one man quotes the bible saying ""where I was once blind I now can see"". Once he is certain he has actually been admitted to THE GAME, he tries to return to the offices of CRS where he received his tests, only to find that no signs of their facilities remain and for all effects, this organization never even ""existed"".

This initially ""mild"" form of harassment (i.e., being misinformed of his membership status, having drinks spilled on him in restaurants, strange people banging into him, folks behaving very strangely in rest rooms and other public places, empty toilets overflowing, his attach case jamming at important business meetings, the pen CRS told him to keep leaking on his shirt, individuals collapsing in the street at his feet, etc.), gradually transitions to increasingly overt and often potentially life-threatening experiences which slowly work on his mental condition. All the more strange is the fact that he is provided the means of barely escaping his next experience by receiving an item or remembering a fact he learned during a prior event.  Some examples of these increasingly life threatening events include: his estate being broken into and ransacked, being stranded in a darkened elevator, his cab driver driving his CRS taxi into the river almost drowning him, large crowds of people disappearing in a coordinated way from public places, being drugged, attacked by hooded gun men emerging from a large van marked Cable Repair Services, abducted and ultimately waking up in a crypt and stranded without cash, credit cards or passport in Mexico).

The mental harassment is designed at first to merely embarrass or make uncomfortable, mildly inconvenience, then to be serious and painful, and after enough repetition and conditioning for him to associate these strange events, to effectively torture and eventually drive insane. Since almost every detail is staged redundantly there are no correct decisions left for him to make, and no avoiding the sequence of painful situations. He is ultimately like a caged animal walking wall to wall in a classic avoidance-avoidance conflict leading to insanity.  The issue of the cost-effectiveness of this game plan is something the film never addresses, but we are too engrossed to think about this during the movie.

One thing is certain, these people do not want to publicly kill him or leave any permanent record of injury due to anything other than a random event. The purpose of THE GAME seems not to be simple murder, but to professionally destroy, discredit and cause a very gradual physical and mental breakdown which will result in his being either jailed because of acting out displaced aggressions, hospitalized or institutionalized where he can ""die"" or be subjected to something while well out of public scrutiny.

In his former professional life he could certainly have made enemies, and what better means could they use to destroy him with impunity? While his financial and mental conditions still enable him to investigate CRS, he believes he acquires ""evidence"" that one of the office workers at CRS was a hired professional actor, more likely to have been provided by Actors Equity than some private detective or intelligence agency (CIA?). As the story unfolds this evidence was probably ""fed"" to him as part of the plot which is just full of strange twists and complications, all leading him no place.

His entire personality changes as he undergoes transformation from a strong business-world predator to the cowering subject of physical and mental harassment. It is sad but interesting to watch his gradual disintegration as forces outside of his control consume him. The ending was a bit strange and is the reason I thought there would be a sequel.

IF THE ABOVE MATERIAL CAN RUIN THE ENDING THE FOLLOWING IS WORSE:

The film can only be said to have a rediculous ending when Van Orton confronts his brother who he now believes is in on the game plan on the roof of the CRS building.  At the end of the story after Van Orton believes he has shot his brother he actually jumps off the roof of the high rise CRS building intent on suicide because of his grief.  He is surprised to learn after smashing through the break away glass of a fake skylight, that he safely lands on a huge airbag carefully placed to break his tremendous fall.  He then sees his resurrected brother and all the other people dressed up in black tie to celebrate his birthday.  It was, after all, just a ""harmless"" gag.

At the end of the story there are no hard feelings and all gracious smiles as he is presented with the check for the elaborate hoaxes that CRS has staged for his ""entertainment"". Even though he has probably aged over 30 years as a result of continuous mental trauma in just a number of days, he goes from table to table thanking the guests for making it a very special party. He even asks out the very beautiful and treacherous lady who slipped him a mickey during the ordeal. Well, the film was too entertaining for that very weak and silly ending to ruin it, but it did erode what I thought was (up until then) a very well done and thought out thriller.",1205452800,4,6895,4.849489795918367

So for the HD version.  I have to agree with most of the BAD HD reviews.  This is a total ""embarrassment"" on the part of Universal for releasing such an obviously, un-remastered version of it in HD.  You actually can tell there is a slight difference on a 56"" HD screen but for smaller TV's, I can imagine there is almost no gain at all in quality over the standard dvd (which was an earlier generation transfer to begin with).  This is such a shame because this film along with a lot of Fincher's other ""dark"" (actual film quality vs. content) films deserve better treatment.  Do not waste your money thinking it will look better because it's on HD-DVD.  We'll have to wait for it to get remastered which does not look good at this point.  I doubt Universal will follow Sony's suit in remastering, like the fifth element after bad bluray reviews.

""What do you get for the man who has everything?""

This is the question Conrad Van Orton (Sean Penn) asks himself.  Conrad is the wayward brother of control-freak Nicholas (Michael Douglas), a wealthy and aloof San Francisco investment banker whose 48th birthday is coming up.

Conrad finally decides on a unique birthday present: a gift certificate to ""Consumer Recreation Services"" (or ""CRS"").  The service provided by CRS is a game.

A friend of Nicks who has already ""played"" the game gives him a hint of what it's about by quoting a passage from the Bible:

""Whereas once I was blind, now I can see.""

Once Nick officially signs up for the game a series of bad and bizarre things begin happening to him, things beyond his control and things designed to make him lose his high status.

There is actually a double climatic ending that, in my case, I found emotionally satisfying.

Michael Douglas does a good job of portraying the aloof investment banker whose life has suddenly spun out of control.  Sean Penn who only appears in a few scenes makes the best of his limited screen time.

The background music enhanced each scene.  This movie was also well photographed.

There are two major problems I found with this movie:

First, it is far-fetched.  This is supposed to be a game where everything is controlled.  However, some of the things that happen to Nick are totally uncontrollable.

Second, the movie is much to long.  Because of its long length, it became tedious for me to watch.  In my opinion, this movie could have been a half hour shorter and still presented an effective story.

Finally, the DVD itself is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has the movie in wide screen on one side and full screen on the other.  There are minimal extras.

In conclusion, despite its problems, this is still an interesting and unique movie!!

This is ""The Game"" starring Michael Douglas as Nicholas Van Orton, an investment banker who apparently has forgotten, or never learned, how to be a kind human being. Mr. Van Orton is short, rude, and a pompous ass to every person he seems to come in contact with. His wealth and power have gone to his head in a big way.

Then as a birthday gift, Nicholas' brother Conrad (played by Sean Penn) gives him a present: a gift certificate to a company known as ""CRS"". Nicholas has no clue what he is in store for. When he eventually goes to CRS to fill out the forms and take the tests needed to get started, he is informed by cel phone during an important meeting that he has been rejected. But this is just a ruse, as from this point on, he is thrown into ""The Game"".

Having to experience humility for probably the first time in his life, Nicholas finds himself in one catastrophe after another, and finds himself completely and totally out of his element as the events unfold in wicked fashion. In the end, he gets exactly what he deserves.

I think we've all run into the Nicholas Van Ortons in the world at some point or another, and there's something satisfying about watching someone who believes to be above everybody and everything get knocked down to Earth.

A delirious and fascinating picture that - at least to my mind - deserved to David Fincher (Seven and The fight club)an emblematic status among the most creative and original filmmakers of his generation, considering all these three films have acquired cult status.

931039,4,6304795254,"The Game is an enjoyable movie.

Enjoyable isn't the same thing as ""realistic.""

And it's not the same thing as ""brilliant.""

But that doesn't take anything away from the fact that enjoyable movies are, well, enjoyable, and that's a good thing.

The Game follows a humorless business man, caught in the same kind of rut that had led his father before him to suicide, as he is ensnared in ""The Game""--an intense, real-life psychological thriller that threatens to become ""too real"" at any moment. In the same way that Total Recall always kept alive the question of ""what's really going on?"", The Game keeps twisting and turning, refusing to show its cards until the very last scene. It's fun to watch, so long as you don't ask yourself too many questions, because the plot is quite unrealistic if you're the sort to care about that kind of thing.

The twisting and turning, the suspense, all of it is done well technically, but sometimes the story feels a little muted--a little ""going through the motions."" The flashback sequences, meant to feel arty and unsettling, don't really contribute much and feel slightly pretentious. It's as though this movie was overly conscious of what it was trying to be, and what it was trying to do, and so it came out feeling manufactured and artificial. It is done well, but not brilliantly so.

So, The Game isn't realistic, and it's not brilliant, but if you have a few hours to spend, it will entertain you. ""Entertaining""'s nothing to sneeze at--most movies don't get that far. A solid 3 3/4 stars, rounded up here to 4.",1147132800,4,1559,4.713235294117647

But this time, the adventure happens in a city environment - in San Francisco. The ""game"" is organized by a company called ""Consumer Recreation Services"", who make your life more ""FUN"".

This movie kept me on the edge of my seat. The reason is that the things which happen to Van Orton (the banker played by Michael Douglas) have happened to me as well - in some way or another. Perhaps they have happened to you too. For example, you visit some company, and at your next visit - the company is gone. Or sometimes, you may experience that someone is draining your bank account without your knowledge. Or, a waitress splashes food and drinks on your suit.

I definitely recommend this movie, because it is captivating to watch. For example, the house in which the banker Van Orton lives, is large and luxurious. It is nice to imagine yourself in the interior of this house. The ""waitress"" than ruins the banker's suit is very beautiful. I would say that Michael Douglas definitely has a taste for luxirious living and beautiful women - this shows in most of his movies.

Nicholas suddenly finds himself immersed in a series of unexplainable events that become increasingly dangerous and manage to shatter the secure, controlled environment that he has built for himself.

This film does an excellent job of illustrating what happens when a person's world literally comes crashing down around them. Douglas does an amazing job of showing how ""the game"" takes over his character's entire life and transforms a once powerful, conniving man into someone who is completely overwhelmed with sheer terror. Unfortunately, the movie drags a lot (especially in the beginning) and the ending leaves a lot to be desired. The whole concept of ""the game"" is so ridiculously absurd...I think the film could have gone in several different directions, and I was ultimately disappointed with the way things turned out.

Overall, ""The Game"" boasts excellent performances by Douglas and the rest of supporting cast.

Cast:  Michael Douglas, Sean Penn, Deborah Kara Unger, James Rebhorn, Peter Donat, Carroll Baker, Anna Katarina, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Charles Martinet.

Running Time:  128 minutes

Rated R for language, and for some violence and sexuality.

Michael Douglas is on reliably good form as Nicholas Van Orton, a millionaire investment banker who lives in stately, joyless, isolated splendour in the mansion he inherited from his millionaire father. His father, Nicholas Van Orton Sr., died at 48 by hurling himself off the mansion's roof. Now having reached 48 himself, Nick, the man who has everything, is given an intriguing birthday gift by his rebellious younger brother Conrad (Sean Penn, sadly under-utilized here): an invitation to participate in a 'game' staged by the mysterious Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). Their games involve the individual participant in a seemingly real-life scenario which blurs the edges between fact and fantasy, and which is deliberately tailored to suit each participant's personality. Reluctantly Nick signs up, as much out of boredom as anything else. It seems that for CRS, Nick's highly charged but emotionally austere and control-freakish personality calls for a high octane adventure in which he risks losing all control of events, and will thus be forced to depend on others for his physical, if not his psychological, salvation. And so the game begins.  Nick soon comes to doubt that he is playing any kind of game. Has he instead become the latest victim of a monumentally sophisticated scam? Or is it all a bad dream? Throughout this is all very gripping, and being a David Fincher (""Seven"") film it has a dark atmospheric gloss which keeps you unpleasantly hooked; however, as the plot unfolds like a Chinese puzzle, the film gradually reveals itself to be pure surface. Despite Douglas essaying yet another hard-nosed anti-heroic establishment outsider with characteristic intensity, there is only an intermittent sense that Nick is in psychological rather than physical danger, even though this, underlined by the constant home-movie flashbacks to Van Orton Senior's demise, seems to be what's actually at stake. The lack of psychological menace in the film hinges on the fact that no other character in the film is properly developed, so no one really seems to carry any real threat. Perhaps the real threat to Nick is within himself, his own demons, which somehow the game is intended to help him exorcize. But it's questionable that this is what we actually see portrayed.

The film is boistered by superb performances, including Douglas' best since ""Wall Street"". Deborah Kara Unger impresses as Christine, the waitress (or is she a waitress?), while Sean Penn is quite good at playing the somewhat spoiled and mouthy little brother. The script has wickedly funny dialogue and gives the film a slight ""black comedy"" feel. As usual in a Fincher film, the cinematography is dark and forebodding and creates a noir atmosphere of sorts. Howard Shore's music is excellent: Instead of attacking us with bombastic chords, a sound as simple as a piano tinkling is used to make our hearts race. The plotting is ingenious and one plot twist after another is instigated until the film creates a spider-web of fear and paranoia that has us mind-boggled. The films themes of redemption and paranoia are followed through right to the end in an ending that some think is supremely contrived.  Despite its pretentious packaging, the constant hints that we are watching a dark psychological thriller, a morality tale, 'The Game' turns out to be merely a well-executed action adventure that plays on the audience's paranoid fantasies, and it is to this end that Nicholas Van Orton seems ultimately to have been created by the film-makers.",1136073600,,3800,5.194444444444445
931044,4,6304795254,"Directed by David Fincher, 1997's ""The Game"" is a very cleverly constructed and engaging thriller, although the implausibility of the whole 'game' leaves one with such a ""give me a break"" taste in their mouth that it simply can't be hailed as a masterpiece.

Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) is an incredibly wealthy investment banker who seems to be incredibly miserable, partly because of the daily grind of his work, and also because he's divorced and basically lives alone. His brother Conrad (Sean Penn) is seemingly aware of this, and in attempt to 'spice things up' for Nick, tells him about a suspicious company he should call named CRS, i.e. Consumer Recreation Services. Conrad tells his brother he's called them before and that they gave him a life changing experience in his own right. Nick ultimately gives in to temptation, not really knowing what he's getting into, and before he knows it, the 'game' begins.

On the positive side, the mostly dark cinematography of the movie is extremely fitting and effective, and with the construction of the script being as engagingly clever as it is, we don't get the first real inkling as to just how impossibly far-fetched it all is until about  of the way into this 2+ hour film. And the movie's 'big climax' IS suspenseful and surprising, albeit ultimately outrageous, and the final scene amusingly provides one last macabre twist.

The film is also a tour-de-force for Michael Douglas, who appears in every single scene.  It really is intriguing to watch a painstakingly maintained control freak have the proverbial rugs pulled out from under him at every turn, and Douglas is perfect for the role--intense, yet natural, and capturing the various emotions of his character masterfully.  Deborah Kara Unger's performance is also memorable--Douglas and she have an excellent on-screen chemistry.  Sean Penn, on the other hand, strikes me as being considerably miscast, but he doesn't have that much screen time anyway.

In the end, this is a better-than-average thriller. It's highly entertaining despite its extreme implausibility and the rather underwhelming & laughable ending.",1134950400,3,2140,5.164739884393064
931045,5,6304795254,"I can't help but harken back to Michael Douglas's terriffic portrayal as a stock market financier in Wall Street. His character in The Game is strikingly similar to Gordon Gecco, except the dissimilarity of the Game's Orton is that instead of truly enjoying the merits of massive money monkey malarchy, he seems only interested in attaining more of it at the cost of no personal life whatsoever.

Douglas is again, his usual thriller great self. We see him at the true zenith of perfection in his attempts to discover the secrets of the corporation that set forth this intriguing but upsetting game which seems to be much more than the simplicity originally implied.

Oh sure, we expect something special in his brother's gift, but we certainly don't expect to be so far on the edge of our seat that we are getting cramps in our butts just trying to stay there.

What I truly loved about this movie is my own lack of ability to come to a true answer as to what was really going on. So often, it is within my and other's nature to try and be smart and figure out the intended ending, only to be found right and then slightly disappointed that the writer and director didn't go past our expectations. Not so with The Game. Game takes you so deep into this man's downward spiral while ""playing"" this deceptive game, figuring out it's true intent becomes second nature. By the end, your nerves are so shatterred from the journey, you feel like you've been right there with Van Orton experiencing every nuance of the events in reality yourself.

At a superficial level, a psychological thriller, but as is usual with Fincher's films, it goes way beyond that. 'Alien 3' did much the same for me. At first viewing I was deeply underwhelmed. This was as in part due to James Cameron's phenonomenal 'Alien's', as it was to Fincher's unique cinematic style. His style again came to the fore in 'Panic Room', his film after 'The Game.'

However the cause for initial lack of love for the film, again probably is due to his previous masterpiece, 'Seven'. 'The Game' does take some getting into, but on repeated viewing has the capacity to reward viewers, not only with superlative acting perfomances, but a great script and a pace that is deliberately slow enough to make the viewer share Michael Douglas' sense of torment and unease at where his 'game' is all going.

But when his younger brother gives him a very mysterious gift to play ""the game"", everything goes awry. The game has no rules and he doesn't know who he can trust.

With an intensity which few films can rival, The Game quickly moves from one surprising scene to the next, always catching its audience off guard and creating a thrilling, edge-of-your-seat atmosphere. If you haven't seen The Game, you have no idea what you've been missing...

Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) is an extremely wealthy San Francisco banker, living in an opulent estate just outside of the city. But Nicholas is not a happy man. He generally spends his time alone, the exception being when he spends time with his clients brokering lucrative business deals. Nicholas even spends his birthday alone, and on his forty-eighth birthday, Nicholas is forced to reflect on the fact that his father committed suicide at the same age.

But this year, Nicholas's birthday takes an unexpected twist when his estranged younger brother Conrad (Sean Penn) arrives unannounced at the Van Orton estate. A former drug addict involved in all sorts of nefarious schemes in the past, Nicholas remains skeptical of the true reasons for his brother's return. However, Conrad soon manages to convince Nicholas that his only reason for returning is to give his lonely, boring brother a birthday present he'll never forget. What exactly is the gift?

It's a very expensive entertainment package provided by a firm called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). Curious as to what sort of entertainment they provide, Nicholas visits CRS where he undergoes a series of mental, physical, and psychological tests to make sure he can handle what they offer. In return, CRS agrees to customize the adventure of a lifetime for Nicholas - as they do for famous and wealthy executives all over the globe...

But when strange things start to take place and those are followed by seemingly horrendous events, Nicholas must make use of his intellect and his instincts in order to survive. Afraid the events are part of a misguiding sense of humor on the part of the employees at CRS, Nicholas arrives at their office building prepared to cancel the entertainment package. But to his dismay, the office space is vacant and the landlord has never heard of CRS. Even worse, Nicholas finds out that every financial account he owns has been wiped clean and that a criminal organization has been pulling similar heists on wealthy industrialists all over the world. Uncertain of his future, Nicholas sets out to get to the bottom of the truth, and in doing so, he finds out the truth about himself...

Far from a blockbuster commercial success when it was first released in 1997, The Game is an unknown entity among most casual movie watchers. As such, those who stumble upon The Game will be duly impressed with the quality of this cinematic gem. Featuring two show-stopping performances by Michael Douglas and Sean Penn, The Game is an instant fan favorite among those who've seen it. Boasting one of the more suspense riddled screenplays of the past decade, The Game is a definite must-see film you won't want to miss...

The film's momentum is based entirely on mystery; the suspense building up with each of the main character's unexplainable predicaments which seem to have no rhyme or reason.

The movie could have been subtitled 'The initiation of a millionaire', because Van Orton undergoes numerous archetypal trials: he is stuck in a car underwater (in the belly of the monster); he is buried alive; his descensus ad infernos is such that he (literally) has to make a death-defying jump in a garbage dump; he has to find his way through mazes and use secret keys; most scenes take place in darkness.

Unfortunately, he is also extremely lonely, because he has no one to share it with. Nicholas is turning 48, and his strange and eccentric brother Conrad ( Sean Penn)wants to give Nicholas the perfect gift for his birthday. Conrad gives him an invitation to a company called Consumer Recreation Services, that specializes in creating games that are designed specifically for the participant. Unable to resist, Nicholas decides to go through with it. However, soon after Nicholas signs up, very strange and horrible things start to happen to him, which leads Nicholas to believe that the game he is involved in, will have him playing for his life.
""The Game"" is without a doubt one of the most thrilling and suspenseful films I have ever seen. I was literally drawn into the film from beginning to end. Nothing is what it seems in this film. The end is perhaps the film's best feature because it is completely unpredictable. There are so many twists and turns, that the movie may appear confusing at times. But if you are willing to give the concentration and patience that is needed, watching The Game can be a very rewarding experience. Michael Douglas is an amazing actor, and it shows in this film. You legitimately come to feel for his character, because of how well he portrays the character breaking down. Watching Michael Douglas's character lose control of his life is frightening and somewhat amusing as well. Sean Penn, Deborah Unger, and the rest of the cast all do a great job as well.
Overall, ""The Game"" is probably one of the best psychological thrillers ever made. The film is unpredictable and suspenseful from beginning to end, and the performances given from Michael Douglas and company could not have been better. My only advice with this film is that you be willing to pay attention and concentrate on what is going on. This is a film that you need to use your mind when watching.",1078963200,7,2027,4.810888252148997
931179,3,6304795254,"Michael Douglas is Nicholas Van Orton, a not very likeable, rather unscrupulous bigshot investment banker (with echoes of the character he played in `Wall Street'). His troubled brother Conrad (Sean Penn) offers him as birthday present, a chance to play the `Game' on offer from an outfit calling itself `Consumer Recreation Services'. Intrigued but so far not very impressed, Van Orton visits the CRS offices and is subjected to several hours of psychometric testing. Then odd stuff starts to happen. A toy clown turns up in front of his house with a key in its mouth. A newsreader on TV breaks off reading the news and engages him in conversation. A man collapes in the street and when Van Orton helps he is taken along in the ambulance to..., well, somewhere quite frightening that is certainly not a hospital.
This is the movie David Fincher made in between `Seven' and `Fight Club'. Like `Fight Club' it's a very interesting movie that fails to live up to the promise suggested by `Seven'. In fact it is like `Fight Club' in other ways too. Like `Fight Club' it starts out well, with a really interesting first half. Here we are set up with a delightfully intriguing mystery: here is Van Orton caught up in this utterly baffling nightmare; what on earth is going on? Are these guys out to destroy him? If so why? And why go about it in such a perversely elaborate way? And if not, what on earth are they doing? But, exactly as with `Fight Club' a really satisfying first half is followed by a really silly second half. The movie just tries to be too clever, and slowly starts to disappear up its own backside. Then, having got us all excited with a lovely intriguing mystery, it cops out with the most feeble and unconvincing of denouements. So after one hour, you are sat there thinking, ""Hey, what an interesting, fresh, original movie""; but after two and a bit, as the credits roll, you are sat there thinking: ""How disappointing, all a bit silly, hopelessly unbelievable and a serious letdown after first hour.""",1078617600,10,2020,4.676966292134831
931180,4,6304795254,"Last night I was surfing the channels trying to find something entertaining and found ""The Game"".....What I was immediately struck by was Douglas' close resemblance to his character in ""Wall Street'....but in this film his personality, if you want to call it that, is much more restrained.
Stated simply, his life is essentially a boring repetition of getting up in the morning, eating breakfast in the kitchen with Elsa, his housekeeper, portrayed by Carol Baker, and going to work.....Enter his brother 'Connie', portrayed by Sean Penn, who introduces him to 'CRS'.....as a birthday gift....He is at home one night and decides that perhaps watching the stock market report is not challenging him anymore so the next day he heads to CRS....
The first thing I noted was despite his retrained personality, he allowed a group of people who he only knew as ""CRS"" to take him apart, psychologically and physically (they did allot of testing e.g. treadmill etc.)....he allowed this to happen even tho he could not find out what was the essence of 'the game'....I am adventurous but NOT to the point where I would allow that to happen....frankly find it hard to believe that an investment banker would just accept this kind of thing.
His adventures, as he gets further and further into 'the game', are what intrigued me. I will not state what the end was like because I feel it rude to do that.....However, I will say that it was refreshing to watch this all unfold.....
""White Rabbit"" was the theme song thru most of the film.....I think whoever selected that song was right on target because Alice suffered the same consequences when her curiosity got the best of her.......",1078012800,3,1670,4.883802816901408
931181,4,6304795254,"Having read about 60 of the reviews for this film, I can't believe no-one has offered the opinion that this film is basically a religious allegory - a sinner, whose disdain for other people shows in his attitude to his ex-wife, and brother - has taken away from him all that he possesses (or is possessed by). He is restored, redeemed if you will, by the mysterious operations of CRS. It seems fairly obvious.
Looked at like this, the plot and the ending (which seem to have outraged so many of the reviewers) don't call so much for a suspension of disbelief as a willingness to participate in the symbolic coherence of the allegory. I'm not a Christian, but I can admire the courage of a film that dares to push the narrative so far, and in such a direction.
Douglas is excellent as the central character hardly trying at all not to repeat the ""fall"" of his father (until CRS comes along), while Penn, to his enormous credit, makes a credible brother. Unger I like to think of as the presiding angel of the film, one who appears as a nuisance to Douglas, but leads him eventually through the shadows - and she does very well too.
One other thing - the score, by Howard Shore, is terrifically simple, plangent and tense by turns; the film would not please so much without it.",1077148800,10,1275,4.452991452991453
931182,4,6304795254,"""The Game"" stars Michael Douglas as Nicholas Van Orton, a wealthy San Francisco investment banker staidly running his financial empire.  Nichola's estranged ne'er-do-well brother Conrad (played by Sean Penn) presents a birthday gift to 48-year-old Nicholas -- a paid membership to The Game.
The Game is a chaotic intervention -- Murphy's Law applied proactively.  Suddenly Nicholas' controlling lifestyle is flooded with annoyances and emergencies including embarrassing restaurant accidents, police encounters, questionable meetings in hotel rooms, armed mercenaries and a taxi ride off a pier into San Francisco Bay.  Friends and associates become suspect as The Game drives Nicholas towards financial and personal ruin.
Michael Douglas portrays powerful men well and his performance is excellent.  And ""The Game"" portrays chaotic ruination effectively.  But the 1997 plot of ""The Game"" is not original.  Dan Ackroyd's film ""Trading Places"" included a comedic rendition of The Game.  And the television series ""Mission Impossible"" starring Peter Graves, Martin Land au and Greg Morris had a similar theme -- use chaos to weaken and destroy targeted individuals.  IMO the similarity between ""The Game"" and ""Mission Impossible"" suggests an interesting speculation: 'How did the Mission Impossible team stay sharp between Government missions?'",1076198400,3,1342,5.846153846153846
931183,4,6304795254,"David Fincher, the director behind Se7en and Fight Club, makes an extravagant suspenseful thriller with The Game. The noir-ish theme from Se7en remains, but this isn't a story about a crime being uncovered; only The Game is about a crime in the making (or is it?)
Michael Douglas plays a successful rich businessman (an echo image of Gordon Gekko from Wall Street) who's haunted by his father's suicide. His life is typical; no adventures, just the same old, same old everyday. Things change when he recieves an unusual gift from his younger brother, played charmfully by Sean Penn. Nothing else should be said after this for I do not wish to ruin the plot if you haven't already seen it. But just to give you a glimpse, Michael Douglas' life turns very bumpy, dark, mysterious; in other words, it turns completely upside down in one of the worst nightmarish mind-boggling roller coaster trips any rich successful businessman stuck in a routine and haunted by his past could ever have!

931274,4,6304795254,"THE GAME is definitely a director's movie.  David Fincher (Seven, Panic Room, Fight Club) propels us into the nightmarish world of Michael Douglas' Scroogish investment banker.  Nicholas is cold; lonely; bearing a lot of anguish over the suicide of his father, the seeming failure of his brother (Sean Penn in a rather small role, almost overacting, but tolerable).  What in this movie is real and what is a game?  The use of news commentator Daniel Schorr to set the rules for Douglas is very good, and unique.  Deborah Kara Unger fills the role of Christine nicely, although sometimes she seems in a vague fog.  Peter Donat as Douglas' lawyer is sturdy; James Rebhorn as the smarmy employee of CRS is also good.
The movie rests on Douglas' shoulders and thought it may be a combination of his other roles, he still does a commendable job in carrying the movie.  It is bizarre, nightmarish, ominous and a director's triumph.  Some of the things that go on toward the end of the movie and stretch the credibility factor, but I can't divulge those without spoiling the ending.

931276,4,6304795254,"Less than a full year before A PERFECT MURDER (1998) was released, Michael Douglas starred in THE GAME (1997), which is not simply a Michael Douglas movie, it's a David Fincher film-and you know what that means!  From a screenplay by John D. Brancato & Michael Ferris, THE GAME is classic Fincher: dark, mysterious and with a constant sense of brooding danger in which lets you know that somehow, somewhere, something is not quite kosher.
In THE GAME, Douglas is Nicholas Van Orton; a man of great wealth and power and totally devoid of any human compassion (as evidenced by the cold and callous way in which he fires a longtime employee).  If this sounds like Gordon Gekko to you, it's because Michael Douglas, at this stage in his career, plays cold callousness like no one else.  Call it typecasting; I call it brilliant acting ability and being smart enough to stick with what works.  However, Gordon Gekko in the legendary Oliver Stone-directed WALL STREET (1987) didn't have a younger brother; Nicholas Van Orton does.  On Nick's 48th birthday (the same age at which his father died, hint hint), his black-sheep-of-the-family brother Conrad, as brilliantly played by Sean Penn, visits him in his sprawling, cherry-wood office and hands his older sibling his birthday present: a business card with the name Consumer Recreation Services (CRS) on it.  ""What is this,"" Nicholas cynically asks.  The sly answer given by Penn is one of my favorite lines in the film, and one that tells us that his elder bro's life will never be the same, once he begins to play THE GAME.
Along the way, Nicholas Van Orton encounters CRS and its primary spokesman (or so he thinks) Jim Feingold (played with disarming confidence by character actor James Rebhorn), a mouthy cocktail waitress (Deborah Kara Unger) who seems to hold the secret to THE GAME, and a spooky-looking full-size inanimate clown who appears to watch everything he does.  Also along the way are near-brushes with death that culminate with Conrad Van Orton's tearful admission that he ""didn't know what the $#@! he had gotten them into"" when he had signed his brother up for THE GAME. But that's still just the beginning...
Everyone is superbly cast in this film, including BABY DOLL (1956) herself, Carroll Baker, and the always-watchable Armin Mueller-Stahl.  But the real star here is David Fincher; he is so adept at guiding us down a labyrinthic path of which only he knows the end, that all we can do is hang on and enjoy the rollercoaster ride on which he breathlessly takes us.  He primarily relies on small, subtle signs of foreboding to generate suspense, as opposed to full-blown violence and gore.  Although this is one of those films that relies on first-time viewers' lack of knowledge of what to expect, and thusly loses something on repeated viewings, it is still a very good film to re-visit on occasion, if only to experience Fincher's unique style (this film and A PERFECT MURDER are miles apart in this respect, believe me), Douglas and Penn's acting and the production values, which are first-rate.
See and experience THE GAME for yourself.

931277,2,6304795254,"I'm not sure which film most of the other reviewers below have seen, but this clunker easily earns its reputation as David Fincher's ""bad"" movie. Where ""Fight Club,"" ""Se7en,"" and even ""Panic Room"" were all more or less successful in portraying engaging characters, setting convincing moods, and effortlessly bringing the viewer along with the narrative (all signs of a truly great director), ""The Game"" lamely prods us through just over two sadistic hours of largely predictable plot points. I've heard others claim that this film references ""The Trial"" or the story of Job somehow, but this story is fully spiritually removed from either of these sources--especially given the unbearably treacly ending.
It probably wasn't Fincher's fault -- it appears that he just got caught up in what he thought to be, at the time, a really revolutionary script -- so I'm willing to forgive him this one. (No surprise, incidentally, that this is the only one of his DVDs without commentary or other features.) The actors nearly rescue the situation, although not too well. Douglas warms over a chilly re-hash of ""Wall Street""'s Gordon Gekko just for the occasion, Sean Penn embarrasses himself in every scene right up to the horrible denouement and ""surprise"" finale, and Michelle Unger... well, she looks nice. Which was enough to merit a star more than I thought this deserved.

The big brother game agency speaks of the loss of privacy, and how our lives can be changed by technology. And then there is the underlying seed of it all, revenge.

931280,5,6304795254,"What happens when you are a powerful multi-millionaire and have everything you ever wanted?  While you and I might think this situation is highly desirable, for Nicholas Van Orton, played by Michael Douglas, it is very boring.  In fact, you might say that Nicholas is miserable.  However, Nicholas' brother Conrad Van Orton, played by Sean Penn, has bought Nicholas a gift for his 48th birthday, an invitation to play ""The Game.""

From this point forward the movie drags for what seems forever.  I was beginning to regret watching this movie.  Looking back, though, I now know that this beginning helps us to more fully understand how boring and awful Nicholas's life is, and provides an excellent contrast with what happens later in the movie.

Nicholas is in a very upscale restaurant when a waitress (Deborah Unger as Christine) spills wine on his shirt.  Christine is fired by the restaurant manager and leaves, very upset.  Before you can say white rabbit, a waiter rushes by Nicholas' table and drops off a note that tells Nicholas to follow the girl.  Prepare for the roller coaster ride.

Within moments Nicholas finds himself involved with an apparently dying man, then just as quickly he finds he is being chased by the police, and police dogs, and things just get worse and worse.  The list of things to which Nicholas is subjected is too long to describe, and would leave you with no surprises.

Nicholas tries to figure out how to make all the action and events to which he is being subjected stop.  Nicholas can't handle the loss of control.  Further, the chaos of his experiences seems to follow no pattern or order.  Eventually Nicholas gets back to where he thinks it all began for a showdown that left me surprised and amazed.  You'll have to watch the end for yourself.

There are several lapses in credibility, but unless you are an obsessive control freak (sort of like Nicholas Van Orton, for instance) you'll likely consider the lapses minor.  This movie ultimately is an intelligent thriller that relies on action only when necessary to heighten Nicholas' fears and to pull him into what seems like a deeply nefarious conspiracy.  After watching, this movie became one of my favorites, and I've now seen it several times.

The most difficult part of this movie is the relatively slow first part.  However, have patience; what you learn in the first part helps you to understand Nicholas and to be drawn more fully into his situation.  Sympathy with Nicholas and his situation is highly desirable to fully appreciate the end of the movie.  I was sympathetic, and enjoyed this movie.  5 stars for an intelligent thriller that relies on intelligent plot versus guns, fast cars and special effects.

Nicholas's life promptly disintegrates. Is it all part of the elaborate game, or has he become embroiled in something far more sinister?  ""The Game"" not only plays with contemporary paranoia about upper-class, white-collar vulnerability to scams - it also neatly subverts audience expectations. By putting us in precisely the same position as Nicholas, the film doesn't let us solve the mystery before he does. Though Act 2 of the screenplay wanders, it's easily the best work yet from John Brancato and Michael Ferris (the team who also penned the hideous ""The Net""), and David Fincher elevates it enormously with his slick shooting style and trademark noirish unease.

Its one of those earlier, 2 sided dvd's (which I despise), with widescreen on one side, and full screen on the other.  Thats basically it, it has bios of the cast and filmmakers, but nothin even close to what could be called ""special features"".  Ok, now 'bout the movie....I love the direction of David Fincher almost so much that I forget about the story. A rich, anti-social, reclusive, yet successful businessman, played by Michael Douglas, is introduced to a ""game"". This game shoves him into situations that push him to the edge, and in a sense, bring him out of his anti-social shell, making this almost a ""coming of age"" movie. This is probably David Fincher's most under-rated movie, 2nd behind Fight Club, which even though got recognized, didn't get near the amount of recognition it deserved. Douglas does a great job playing a yuppie, which is nothing new to him, but I love Sean Penn's performance the most. Penn is already known for his intensity as an actor, and the blown tire scene in this movie lets you see just what everyone is talking about. Much like Fincher's Se7en and Fight Club, this movie is more fun to watch the second time around, for reasons I cant disclose on the assumption that people who haven't seen The Game might read this. If you like Se7en, you like this one. If you love both, hopefully you've seen Fight Club and Panic Room, if not.....don't wait doing so, you won't be disappointed.",1018396800,4,1509,4.665413533834586

It was only after I had watched it for the 3rd time that I realized that I understood it. The movie itself is well crafted and fast paced. It has a first class cast and produciton quality. Michael Douglas and Sean Penn are two accomplished actors and they are in good form here. Douglas especialy is spot on as the bewildered and confused banker whose tranquil life is suddenly turned upside down as he redeems a gift coupon given to him by his brother played by Penn. The gift coupon belongs to a company which promises to bring a bit of spice and vitality back in Douglas' life. But it is actually a passport to hell. As the game progresses Douglas' life is turned upside down. He is left homeless and pennyless and $600 million stolen from his bank. Either everyone is part of this elaborate practical joke or this nightmare is for real, you will never be able to guess till the end. Even after the end you are left a little dazed and confused. What we don't realize is that deliberately or perhaps unintentionally Fincher is commenting on the human condition.

Nicholas is given a birthday present from his wayward brother Conrad, skillfully played by Sean Penn, and this is where the fun and GAMES begin.  I don't want to spoil the plot for anyone but I guarantee if you sit down and watch this movie 'The Game' will take over your life just as it does to Nicholas Van Orten in film.  I am certain that this film will become more respected as it gets older and other than Douglas this mainly down to David Fincher who does an excellent job keeping the complicated plot moving and I feel it is his best effort behind the camera.

Michael Douglas stars as Nicholas Van Orton, a divorced wealthy businessman who has acquired all the material wealth one could ever want, but something is lacking.
Enter The Game.
It is Nicholas's 48th birthday and his rebellious brother, played by Sean Penn, gives as a gift an invitation to play The Game.
Nicholas is not informed of the rules of said game or even when it will start.  He is told that it is sort of like a vacation only you don't go to it--it comes to you.
He is thrown into a series of events which at the beginning he is slightly amused. But the stakes increase and when his world is so unpredictable and turned upside down and he thinks he's lost everything, he is convinced that this is no longer a game. It becomes a struggle for his very life.

 The incredible Douglas and Penn combo, along with the thrillingly unpredictable action sequences, are what make The Game such a great, `edge of your seat' experience.
 Nicholas Van Ortan (Michael Douglas) is a millionaire tycoon who resides in San Francisco. Soon it becomes obvious that Nick is not the perpetually contented man that the ideal millionaire is thought to be. He is in fact very dissatisfied and bored by life.
On his birthday, he meets with one of his only remaining relatives, Conrad Van Ortan (Sean Penn), at a fancy restaurant. Conrad, Nick's brother, convinces him to spice up his life by calling the latest new corporation, known as Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). Nick makes an appointment, in which an odd series of tests are conducted on him, taking up a total of 24 hours.
CRS takes Douglas on a wild thrill ride of implausible, yet fantastic events, as the movie will for you. The Game's lack of realism does not lower its status in any way, as Nick finds himself in deserted hospitals, talking to inanimate objects, driving off piers, jumping off buildings, and much more, with the frequent, brief, and mysterious appearances of Conrad. The Game is sheer fun and excitement as well as a must-see movie for all action/adventure lovers.",1001116800,,1307,4.882882882882883
931569,4,6304795254,"When watching ""The Game"" for the first time, one will be pleasantly surprised by the film's continuous twist and turns literally leaving the viewer on the edge of their seat. It's almost impossible to predict the outcome of this mystery/thriller, all the more so because of director David Fincher's penchant for draping his film with ominous shadows and uncomfortable flashbacks dealing with alienation and suicide. ""The Game"" does not feel like the kind of film headed anywhere near a comfortable resolution. And if one recalls Fincher's previous effort, the dark and thoroughly depressing ""Seven,"" you know he is a director uninhibited when it comes to detailing the demons which haunt his psyche.
In ""The Game,"" rarely has the San Francisco locale seemed so dark and dreary. The rain-soaked streets, abandoned skyscrapers and lonely mansions are displayed in an almost gothic fashion, reminding one of the lonely fog-shrouded sets of early Hammer horror films. Drop into this desolate atmosphere the alienated and secluded protagonist played by Michael Douglas, and viewers find themselves in a most uncomfortable motion picture. The tension rarely lets up, as Sean Penn, who plays Douglas' kid brother, appears on the scene to offer a birthday present to his brother -- a game that will have a profound affect on his life.
Douglas, out of boredom more than anything else, eventually visits the company which will offer ""The Game."" He soon discovers that the private and lonely existence he has forged has been violated with eerie mannequin clowns appearing in his driveway and television sets talking to him rather than reporting the stocks. Soon, nothing is what it seems, not even his relationship with his brother, and Douglas finds himself hunted by mysterious men and answering phone calls that play back conversations he's had previously.
Throw into this tumultuous mix a wise-cracking waitress (played with silky ease by Deborah Unger) who becomes Douglas' ally, and the viewer is in for a halloween-like rollercoaster ride complete with runaway taxi cabs, blazing machine guns and chases through lonely alley ways. All of this frantic activity eventually leads to the top of a downtown office building, where Douglas is confronted with a desperate choice -- either accept ""The Game"" as just that, or realize his life is truly in danger, protecting himself at all costs. His decision may not surprise the viewer, but the resolution absolutely will.
I'm not sure why I enjoy ""The Game"" so much, having seen it multiple times. Douglas' performance is fine, if not a bit derivative of his past work. Penn seems to enjoy himself in what is essentially a thankless cameo role. Unger, who steals many of her scenes, is appealing though nothing to write home about.
Perhaps what sets ""The Game"" apart is its atmosphere, undoubtedly fueled by Fincher. This is a director's film if ever there was one, complete with frantic pace, symbolic flashbacks, strategic camera angles and already-mentioned dark vision. While the over-the-top intensity of Fincher's better known efforts ""Seven"" and ""The Fight Club"" is definitely in full bloom here, he does hold back just enough of those mischievous demons to make ""The Game"" his most mature and accessible effort. And thus, it is one of the finest works to date by one of the most interesting directors working today.",999388800,2,3361,5.135036496350365

This doesn't let up even to the very last minute of the film.  You actually live the life of the character you are watching because like him, you are stupefied and confounded at every turn.

Director David Fincher provides a really creepy, eerie atmosphere to the story.  The cinematography has a dark, eerie look (as in Seven).  The music (such as the tinkering piano) has a way of creeping up on you.  Michael Douglas is terrific, as usual.  Towards the 2nd half however, I started to lose interest.  I found the story was just cranking on and on with no point.  By the end, I was dissappointed with the payoff.  I felt it didn't have to go on so long to explain it's point.  I guess this is the reason it didn't perform so well at the box office. The 2nd time I watched this was a different story.  Knowing in advance about the ending, I could pay more attention to the meaning of all of the scenes (I don't want to give too much away).  The early flashbacks are there to tell you what kind of unhappy, selfish, lonely person Douglas is like.  As the movie progresses, you begin to see him changing as he is going through the game.  This is the whole point of the story, not what is really going on.  By the time the payoff has come around, you are touched with what has occured.  The viewer is not really supposed to be surprised at the end, but emotionally moved. What I really would like to see someday is a DVD with Fincher's director's commentary.  This is such a complex movie where each scene needs to be explained.  I hope David Fincher does that someday (like the new Seven DVD). One minor note:  For those of you complaining about how far fetched the movie is, this movie is supposed to be unreal.  I could not believe one minute of it, but Fincher makes it clear he doesn't want you to believe in it.

For his 48th birthday, Van Orton's brother, Conrad (Sean Penn) buys him a ticket to ""The Game."" The game is a fictional attempt to destroy Van Orton's secure life of power and affluence. The adventure begins with Van Orton the multi-millionaire, and ends with Van Orton the pauper. ""The Game"" forces Van Orton to doubt and confuse fact with fiction, the real from the unreal. The viewer also faces the same dilemma constantly guessing whether he's watching a game or a real scenario.
""The Game"" reminds me of John Fowles' novel ""The Magus,"" except that the movie lacks magic and mysticism. The object of ""The Game"" (like ""The Magus"") is to force the involuntary pawn (Van Orton) to experience a catharsis; that is, to change from a callous and uncaring individual, to one of humane endeavors and compassion. The movie is partially successful. Van Orton is certainly ""changed"" by the game, but I doubt that he gives his millions to charity, and lives a life pursuing causes more noble than the buck.
""The Game"" is filled with adventure, drama, intrigue and ""sitting on the edge of the seat"" scenes, but it's hardly plausible. In order for the game to work, for it to be convincing, a cast of a thousand actors must complete each minute detail with no mistakes, no errors.

There are dozens of examples.  He had to go to a  certain apartment.  He had to get a gun from a certain drawer of an empty  house and not from anywhere else on this thousand-mile journey from Mexico.  When he's running from bullets through San Francisco, for instance, his  enemies know that not a single neighbor will look out a window, come to his  aid, shoot back, or even call the police.  For god's sake, in one  laughable moment he had to jump from a specific spot even though nothing  keeps him from being several feet to either side.  If you've seen the flick  already, just think about that one scene and how high the stakes were.  How  could anyone short of God Himself predict that Douglas would do what he did  from the EXACT SPOT he did it?",963446400,22,1217,4.541666666666667

932269,3,6304795254,"57. THE GAME (thriller, 1997) On the day of his birthday millionaire businessman Nicholas (Michael Douglas) is visited by his brother Conrad (Sean Penn) with a gift. The gift involves Nicholas signing up for a  mysterious company which offers a `game', which in turn offers the  participants a series of surprises that ""provides whatever is lacking"" in  their lives. Though a rather pessimistic and somber individual Nicholas  accepts in the hopes of escaping the memory of a solitary childhood and  witnessing his father's suicide. When the surprises the `game' issues  become seriously deadly Nicholas wants out. But this particular game offers  no escape.
Critique: Nerve-wracking, high wire act of a movie directed  with guile precision by David Fincher (`Seven', `Alien 3'). So far all of  David Fincher's films have been good which is rare for someone who has been  dubbed as a purely commercial director. The sort of tagline that is a  deathnail for anyone seeking true legitimacy in Hollywood. Michael Douglas  is good in the role of another heartless tycoon type character in the mold  of Gordon Gekko from `Wall Street'. Douglas gives the character just a  slight insidious turn and taking him into Twilight Zone territory. It's  also good seeing Sean Penn in a first rate mainstream movie for a change.  Film is made in such a way that every detail has to be dissected in order  to make a logical progression of events. Which otherwise would seem chaotic  and purely coincidental. Towards the climax it all makes perfect sense and  provides a most welcome escape ending. When the credits roll and you know  it is truly over it is strangely satisfying and disappointing.

932272,5,6304795254,"The Game is better than that.  Written by John Brancato and Michael Ferris and directed by David Fincher, of the recent and creepy-Catholic inspired Seven, The Game is an entirely orthodox vision of a man who is forced - by  his own choices - to his own breaking point, which is the only point that  will release him from the trap his life has become. Without the religious  jargon as its delimiters, The Game nevertheless powerfully portrays the  entire human drama of sin, confession, penance, absolution, forgiveness,  oh, and crucifixion and resurrection - all in just over two hours.  The  Game is equal parts Adam, Cain, Abel, Jonah and Lazarus all rolled into one  of the most taught psychological thrillers that I've seen.  Some of the  film's most beautiful moments are the deft touches that seem incidental at  first blush, but nevertheless point to the underlying allegory:  first  communion, a statuette of the Virgin Mary, a reference to the book of John,  and not one, but two resurrection scenes unlike anything you've ever  seen.
If only Walker Percy were still alive!  If writers Brancato and  Ferris aren't Walker Percy fans I'll eat my foot.  The author of The  Moviegoer would recognize his ideas unmistakably by the film's exquisite  rendering of a man so lost in the cosmos that he isn't even aware of his  despair. The question that Walker Percy spent his entire life asking - How  do you speak to a man sensibly about ultimate truth in a Christ-haunted and  Christ-forgetting culture?  -- is not only truthfully but beautifully  answered by The Game. Nicholas Van Orton is the man who has everything, and  thus values nothing.  As an insanely successful control-freak investment  banker who disdains all those who should be closest to him, Van Orton is at  once, as Percy puts it, ""both the hero and ******* of the  cosmos.""  His wealth and power have sated him to the point of extreme  boredom, and it is clear that all viable re-entry points have either  already been attempted or are simply too base for a man of his stature.  What are the conditions under which such a man could actually see the  Parthenon and not be bored, or in this case, the Golden Gate Bridge?  In  Van Orton's case, it takes the work of Consumer Recreation Services, a gift  that Van Orton receives from his younger brother for his 48th birthday --  the age at which his father before him (like another father and son in  another Percy novel) has committed suicide.
Van Orton is mildly amused  by his brother's gift, and one day finds himself coincidentally in their  new San Francisco office, so he decides to inquire.  Here he meets an  administrator named Feingold who tempts him into trying the game with the  same logic that Satan used on Eve:  first, admit that you're interested;  it's a no-risk obligation.  Van Orton then fills out a questionnaire that  sounds more like a confessional transcription than an application to a  recreational service:  I sometimes hurt small animals,  I feel guilty when  masturbating, etc.
But CRS might as well stand for Character Redemption  Services, because the company and its omniscient database immediately  begins pursuing Van Orton like some deranged hound of heaven on steroids,  backing him up against the wall of his greeds, gluttonies and lusts for  what reason neither we nor Van Orton know.  Initially, Van Orton is  intrigued by the attention; he smiles as he walks into the airport and  realizes, with the shock of discovery, that every exchange, glance and  action is imbued with tremendous potential significance.  He is returned to  that state of innocent childhood belief that around each corner the scene  has been constructed just prior to his arrival and will collapse just after  his departure.  But he doesn't know how far it goes, where it starts and  ends, and why.  Like life, he is only armed with the one clue that the  purpose of the game is to discover the purpose of the game.
CRS gives Van  Orton the full Job treatment:  as his security, safety, and luxury are all  pulled out from under him with astonishing speed, he is forced to confront  the bankruptcy of his own soul and the fragility of his own life.  What he  doesn't know, and nor do we until the end, is that he has his own personal  Beatrice guiding him through the underworld his life has become, and  passively but definitively leading his action every misstep of the way.  The waitress Christine is almost always with him, and there are little  clues here and there, that she is in on it, such as when she mutters to  herself, ""Watch out for boards and nails, there should be a fire  escape"" as she leads Van Orton through the second floor of an  abandoned building before jumping into the garbage cans in the alley below.  One of the nice touches comes at the end when we learn that his guide's  real name is not Christine, but Clare, who happens to be the patron saint  of television, a perfect choice for a story so completely layered and  selectively filtered.
From the allegorical point of view, The Game's  great strength is in its depiction of the relationship between free will  and original sin.  With CRS in place of God, Van Orton is placed into  situations where by varying degrees he is or is not allowed to exercise his  controlling tendencies.  When Van Orton is least curious about CRS, they  are casually there in the form of a bum asking for money or a toilet stall  occupant whose run out of toilet paper.  By the film's end, when Van Orton  believes he has regained his control, he is actually playing as tightly and  closely to the CRS script as is possible.  The climactic scene has Van  Orton discovering that this is his crime, and that he cannot actually have  control.  Facing the mirror of his own soul, Van Orton judges and condemns  himself to death, choosing the inheritance of his father's and  grandfather's death. In the most incredible scene of  free-will-as-God's-destiny ever played, Van Orton jumps to his death and  lands perfectly inside the circled X that CRS has scripted for his game.  Van Orton falls, quite literally, of his own choosing, and lands squarely  in the arms of his savior.  After reviving him and checking for cuts, one  of the medics says, ""It's always quite a fall."" At the film's  conclusion, Feingold congratulates Van Orton saying, ""It's a good  thing you jumped, because if you didn't I was supposed to push  you.""
Ultimately, The Game pulls off in allegory what the majority  of modern cinema has failed to do convincingly or persuasively for as long  as I've been alive. The Game, as one of the CRS decoys says to Van Orton  early on, is all about John 9:25 -  ""Whereas once I was blind, now I  can see.""  The Game delivers the old eternal truth in the wrappings of  a new mystery.  Without a single preachy cliche, without any embarrassment  or camp, The Game forces Van Orton and the viewer to recognize the most  fundamental paradox of the Christian faith:  he who would save his life  must first lose it.",917827200,9,7014,4.708367854183927
