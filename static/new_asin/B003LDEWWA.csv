8501063,5,B003LDEWWA,Denzell Washington's action thrillers are fun to watch.  He is such a great actor.  It was kinda hard watching him in Flight however because I hold him up to high standards and he plays an alcoholic and drug user.  I had to keep reminding myself that it was just a movie.,1375401600,,271,4.2745098039215685
