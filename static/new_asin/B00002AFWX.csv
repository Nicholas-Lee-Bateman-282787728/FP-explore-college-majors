7915507,3,B00002AFWX,"I had been looking for a good ""body-weight"" or Dynamic tension exercise program for some time. I had previously seen and used Harry Wong's ""Dynamic Tension"" book and video, but there were some gaps in the training that weren't made clear. So, I decided to take a chance on this video.

It's pretty good. Narrated by David Carradine (and thankfully not demonstrated by), this video shows the basics of what I assume to be a traditional kung fu dynamic tension exercise program. I hesitate to call this a ""program"" because, as the title suggests, this is very beginner stuff. Not to say that the exercises are worthless, but they focus on only the major muscle groups in the torso while almost ignoring the lower half of the body.

The video is nicely shot and well produced and the demonstrators do a fine job of performing the moves in an easy to understand manner. The whole workout lasts about 25 minutes (if I recall correctly), and leaves you wanting more. I wish there was a beginner part 2 or an intermediate video, but no such luck.

Overall, the video is worth the purchase if you are new to dynamic tension exercises, but I would also explore Harry Wong's book ""Dynamic Tension"" and his video of the same title (if they still make it). They are not perfect either, but Harry Wong has some nice variations not covered in this Shaolin video. Maybe try John E. Peterson's book ""Pushing Yourself to Power"" also. He borrows a lot from Matt Furry, and I also recognized some Harry Wong-like exercises as well (which doesn't mean he stole them, they may just be common exercises). I have Matt Furry's book ""Combat Conditioning"" which everyone raves about, but frankly, I don't get it. There are far better books than his out on the market. But that's a story for another review.",1115856000,4,1780,4.644444444444445
7915508,5,B00002AFWX,It took me two years to fully appreciate the hidden gifts of this excellent Shaolin workout. The narration by David is refreshing and the forms by the Sifus are spectacular. This is an award winning training aid. A must for any Hung Gar student.,1017792000,4,245,4.590909090909091
