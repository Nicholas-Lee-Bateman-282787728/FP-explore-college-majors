The animation in this movie is stunning and the movie is worth watching just for this alone. But, that's not all it has. This movie has a deep, emotional, and quick story.",1373068800,19,334,4.775862068965517
5724067,5,B00CJ7Y0US,"Having just received the Japanese release of Makoto Shinkai's latest work, The Garden of Words, in the mail and having viewed it twice as of now, I am certain that this film can be called the latest masterpiece in recent anime films. The animation is visually stunning and a huge treat to the eyes, from rain drops to the details of the garden, the city, and characters, everything is very crisp, clean, and beautiful. Unlike most reviews, I think the 46 minute length of the film is perfect, it isn't short nor does it need to be longer. I believe its more of people ""wanting more"" since it is Makoto Shinkai's latest masterpiece. It would be a treat to be immersed in Shinkai's new world for a bit longer but it isn't necessary.

Especially loved the Tanka used in the story. Very beautiful and touching.

Not going to dive into the story, as the synopsis should pretty much cover what the story is about anyways.

The voice acting is superbly done. Another film starring Miyu Irino and Kana Hanazawa as the two main leads. Both of them have done another amazing job, from the perspective narration of the characters, interactions between them, to the film's beautiful conclusion, both of them did spectacularly in conveying how the characters felt and the atmosphere of the scenes.

Although the Japanese version has English subtitles, the Makoto Shinkai and cast interview remains untranslated which is a huge shame, but is still good to have since I'm not a huge fan of English VA commentaries anyways which is what the English release will be getting.

The soundtrack CD is also nice, don't think the English release will be getting the same treatment though.

All in all, The Garden of Words is an anime film that deserves to be in anyone's collection(one who watches and can appreciate them).",1372204800,30,1800,4.753205128205129
5724068,4,B00CJ7Y0US,"This movie is only 46 minutes, but this movie offers more in that short amount of time than most 90 minute films. First, the visuals are absolutely stunning. This is a true visual feat, although there is no fantasy in this film, obviously, just the simple look of the outdoors is done very tastefully and artistically.

The movie itself is a love story, its short, sweet, and enjoyable. The problem is that its really short, and although its all character development, you could use more time to care about the characters. The story is great, especially the conclusion, the ending scenes are executed perfectly, but again, its WAY too short.

I suggest you watch it before you buy it, if you love it, you'll want it in your collection.",1372204800,100,735,4.689922480620155

And I have to say, I had high expectations because this film is ranked very high on most lists, and has very good ratings. I just don't see the hype. Don't get me wrong, the animation and imagery was gorgeous and extremely detailed and realistic. But the plot line, to me personally, was just so. so. so stupid.

 The movie is about a student and a teacher having a deeper relationship than the usual but it is not a sexual one----at least not yet...the very end of the credits may allude to a future relationship but I personally don't think so.

5724074,5,B00CJ7Y0US,"My introduction to Makoto Shinkai's works was through his wonderful film ""Your Name"" I had to see the rest of his work. I was intrigued by the picture of the rainy garden and Takao measuring Yukino's foot.

One thing I really like from his work his backgrounds.  They are practically pictures. The rain drops hitting the pond look quite real. Just watching the garden shots and city shots are worth the time alone.

I found the story moving. Takao is a new high school student who lives a lonely existence dreaming of making shoes. He is truly alone. His mother (seen once in a background scene) appears to be an unhappy alcoholic who spends much time away from home. His brother moves out. Not really fitting in with the ""normal"" expectations; he likes to cut morning classes on rainy days sit in an arbor and sketch shoe designs. How he becomes attracted to shoe design is both touching and sad. It's not clearly defined; it's what I interpreted. In the arbor is a young woman. Obviously older as she is drinking beer and eating chocolate. Never mind the fact it's morning. She is another lonely person and carries pain.  Hidden but I perceived it. They start talking to each other and over time start an unusual relationship. He has a crush and over time I noticed the beer consumption drops and she starts eating better.

You almost wish they could be together.  But the age difference makes this impossible. There is a final show down which is bitter sweet.

Do watch the scenes through the credits.

The disk also includes interviews, the usual trailers, a story board example, and an English comentary.

5724080,4,B00CJ7Y0US,"Makoto Shinkai's ""The Garden of Words"" is an odd duck. Contrary to its title, there is minimal dialogue, and clocking in at just under forty minutes, it's surprisingly short as well.

Takao is an old fifteen year old, and Yukino a young twenty-seven year old, each dealing with an unexpected upheaval in their lives. In the attempt to regain a sense of tranquillity, they both escape to the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden on rainy mornings, and there meet under the shelter of a pagoda. While Yukino is charmed by Takao's innocence and ambition in becoming a shoemaker, Takao is left wondering why such a lovely woman is so adrift in the world, drinking beer and eating chocolate as she skips work.

Their conversations involve the art of shoemaking, Japanese poetry, and their dreams for the future, though the two never formally introduce themselves. At all times, the question hovers in the audience's mind: is this a budding romance? Or is the age difference too profound? Dealing with the themes of loneliness and discovering one's place in society, ""The Garden of Words"" is a beautiful film with stunning animation and the recurring use of shoes as a metaphor for life (Yukino for example must ""learn to walk again"" after a career setback).

As it happened, the film very much reminded me of ""She and Her Cat"", and only afterwards did I realize both were written and directed by Makoto Shinkai. They each have the same gentle pace and introspective commentary, with emphasis on two carefully drawn individuals who form an unlikely (and indefinable) bond.

If there's one problem it's that the soundtrack is too invasive and sentimental  especially at the film's climax when a cheesy pop song starts playing over the characters' dialogue. I've noticed this often with Japanese anime, even Studio Ghibli.

As with most Western DVD releases, the audio track involves both the original Japanese and an English dub. As ever, it's best to listen in Japanese with English subtitles  there's simply more nuance to the dialogue when heard in its original language (for example, at a critical moment Takao says: arigato gozaimashta to Yukino; a much more formal ""thank you"" than you'd expect at that point in the relationship. Inevitably this distinction is lost in the translation).

The DVD also includes interviews with the cast and crew (which amusingly clocks in at a longer time than the film itself) and several trailers for Makoto Shinkai's other works.

""The Garden of Words"" is deeply character driven and moves at a slow pace, which may not be to everyone's taste. But the animation makes the journey worth it: on-screen Shinjuku Gyoen is brought vividly to life, to the point where you can almost feel the rain and smell the foliage. And at under an hour long, it's not a huge time commitment  why not give it a try?",1508630400,2,2824,4.889121338912134

5724087,4,B00CJ7Y0US,"I have to admit, I had high hopes for this movie. However, the story fell short in my opinion. I don't feel like it was very well thought out, and I don't feel like there was really any closure. The description on the packaging says ""A chance encounter becomes so much more..."" and literally that's what you could say the movie is about. There is no depth, no great character development - the characters were both very vague and shallow so it was hard to connect to them - and again, there was just no closure. No real beginning middle and ending. It was just a simple story. I was really hoping for something more like Hotarubi no Mori e (Into the Forest of Fireflies' Light), but that was probably what had my expectations set so high.

The animation was fantastic. Very rarely do I see such quality animation and graphics - blending 2D characters with almost lifelike surroundings is very difficult because the characters stand out so bad, but this movie did a fantastic job at merging the two.

I guess I would recommend this movie for its animation quality, but you really won't connect to this movie much. It had great potential, but the story just fell short of what it could have been.

Otherwise, I don't have much else to say. I don't know why the movie is titled ""the Garden of Words"" because at no point did the title have to do anything with the movie, but that's not something that takes away from the movie. Just a random thought I had.",1502841600,,1452,4.451127819548872

5724099,4,B00CJ7Y0US,"Note: To a greater extent than with any other anime I urge you to watch this video first before purchasing, either here&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Garden-of-Words/dp/B01MS4VEJU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Garden of Words</a>&nbsp;or elsewhere, because this is not a movie, an OVA, or a TV episode.  At just 46 minutes it is a video short story.

The short story is a form of literature that, at least in English, was once a lot more popular (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/F-Scott-Fitzgerald/dp/068480445X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">F. Scott Fitzgerald</a>), but today you rarely see them outside of particular niches like science fiction or mystery.  What this means is that we only get pieces of the story: a couple of misfits, divided by age, are nevertheless drawn together by circumstances and weather until they are driven apart but with hope for the future.

Takao Akizuki is a 15-year-old high schooler, planning to become a cobbler, whose maturity so towers over his eleven years older brother and his divorced mother dating younger men that other high school kids barely even register with him, Yukari Yukino is a 27-year-old so bullied by the world around her that she has all but ceased to function, but following a chance meeting in a park during the rain, they find themselves drawn to each other.  What follows is a rainy season's worth of casual meetings, culminating in a crisis.

The animation, though computer aided, is spectacular; I've never seen it done so well, which is a reason to go Blu-ray.  To the creators' credit, we get five different full versions on this disc: English, Japanese with subtitles, English commentary, Japanese commentary (including Makoto Shinkai) with subtitles, and even storyboards.  We also get a subtitled interview with Shinkai and the two Japanese leads that runs longer than the film and The Works of Makoto Shinkai, a sequence of info and trailers.  Assuming you have taken my advice and watched the film somewhere else at least once, you are likely to be pleased by this,... assuming you are not paying thirty plus for the Blu-ray.

So is it perfect?  Uh,... no, and for support I call upon the evidence provided by... Makoto Shinkai.  Shortly after finishing the film, Mr. Shinkai wrote a manga version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Garden-of-Words/dp/1939130832/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Garden of Words</a>, illustrated by Midori Motohashi, and while it is mostly the same, I could not help but notice that everywhere it is different, it is better than the film.  The thought balloons, the less accusatory rant by Takao, and most especially the extra scene at the end, which has Yukari WEARING the shoes, all improve the story IMHO, and given Mr. Shinkai's participation in both, that is rather telling.",1489449600,,2923,5.646118721461187

5724111,5,B00CJ7Y0US,"I honestly have no idea how Makoto Shinkai, the maker of this movie, does it. I've now seen all of his movies up to date and I have absolutely no clue how he manages to make such amazing films, whether it be 20 minutes to 2 hours. This particular movie, being his second to most recent with the new released ""Your Name"" movie that just came out, manages to depict a real world meeting and home life centered around a student who has his own dreams he wants to accomplish, one of his main dreams being to be a shoemaker. He meets a girl in a chance encounter in his spot on a bench, which seems to be a garden area with water running by. He comes there only when it rains and spends the time usually drawing things to help with what to make for shoes. His encounter with a new lady changes everything, and all within a 40 some minute period we end up with a real version of events from family to love and hardship. All I can say is this director doesn't need any long span of time to depict what he wants. I'm willing to bet if he was just talking out a story he could simplify it to a couple minutes.

Wonderful and amazing, I've only recently found out about this director, who's been acquainted twice with the renowned director Hayao Miyazaki, the co-founder of Studio Ghibli as well as maker of several well known films such as ""Spirited Away"" and ""Howl's Moving Castle,"" in interviews. Even though he's quite modest, and if you get to read the interviews he actually puts the renowned director above himself, he's got quite a bit of talent, and his movies keep improving every time. I highly recommend taking the time to search out his movies and watch them for yourself. And I suggest taking some time to go through this movie most especially, I wasn't sure what to expect when I started watching this, but I'm sure now, having seen to the end, it's perfect, and I love it, and I hope you do as well.",1484784000,,1905,4.306406685236769

I felt an immense sense of comfort as I was watching the rainy scenes, especially the scenes taking place in the characters' apartments.

It is a love story between two people different in almost every respect: he is 12 years younger, he just entered as a student the school where she works a teacher and which she is considering to leave, hes never been in love whereas shes never been happy in love. Yet destiny chooses that they should meet one rainy June morning in Shinjuku Garden and little by little, politely first, then shy, they draw closer and closer and start a story where hope, longing, uncertainty, joys and pain are tightly woven. It is the story of two beings learning (again) to step into life, to find their way, to tend wounds (old or new), a story of everyday life which may not end by the And they lived happily ever after.
It is a movie to be seen time and again because of the breathtaking images, because of the craftsmanship of the painting, because of the light it shines on the human soul, because from time to time we need to remember that we are spirit too beside flesh, and above all because it blends joys and sorrows, kindness and disappointment, anger and resilience and, most of all, hope in something that can be called nothing else but pure poetry.
Yes, the movie is short, it has little (if any) action (strictly speaking) and no happy-ending all it has to offer you folks is sheer beauty.

The animation is like nothing I've seen before especially the amount of detail whether it is rain hitting the surface of a pond or just the stuning greenery of the park they meet at. The story overall is pretty simple which was told well for a 45 minute film. Both of the characters I could sympothize and connect with and found myself rooting for both of them even though of the age difference which I'm sure is controversial. My only complaint is honestly it went by very fast. But what was done in 45 minutes was done well.",1465862400,,797,4.215686274509804
5724141,5,B00CJ7Y0US,"Just as in many Makoto Shinkai films, this is not a love story. It is about a love that was never intended to work out. This story is about the distance and the loneliness that accompanies love. It's an absolutely beautiful story about a boy who fall in love with a woman much older than him.

The English voice acting was adequate, but left something to be desired. I think that they went with the right choice by focusing on emotion rather than accuracy.

This met all of my expectations of a Blu Ray release.",1464998400,,511,4.368421052631579

Maybe it was because so many people had spoken highly about that film, that I had held it to a much higher standard, which inevitably led to my downfall.

5724153,5,B00CJ7Y0US,"It's been quite awhile since I've seen a visual masterpiece such as this! Even as the opening credits were on the screen I was blown away by the visuals. I don't care if it was hand-drawn or computer generated ( I couldn't quite tell) but the visuals were mouth-dropping. Simply gorgeous.

Yes, you could say that this is a love story of sorts, and I understand some reviewers hated the ending. I put it this way...if you're used to watching TV anime with high episode counts (Naruto, DB, Bleach, etc.), this might not be for you. My question is, was the story told well enough in the time provided? My answer: HELL YES.

In my honest opinion, if you've experienced real/true love and heartbreak or rejection in your life you will probably understand exactly why this story ended the way it did. But make sure you keep watching past the end credits-there's a bit more story.

I also enjoyed hearing English voice talent I haven't heard before and I think the main characters actors knocked it OUT THE BOX, especially Maggie Flecknoe. When the film was at it's climax, I'm not ashamed to say that a tear or two did roll down my cheek and I got a rush of goosebumps. And THAT'S what great movies do. They move you.

So, in conclusion, if this is your thing, you can't go wrong with this title. The cinematography is breathtaking, English dub was very well-done, stunning visuals and the musical score was spellbinding.
I wanted to give this a 9 or 9.5 but I simply can't find a single flaw to warrant it. It's simply a masterpiece.",1456790400,7,1529,4.528985507246377

And seriously, the rain in this cartoon is more real and more beautiful than the rain in a live movie. And so is the sound -- the click of a lock, the click of shoes on the floor, the sound of pencils and doors, and on and on, the sound effects are gorgeously accurate.",1455926400,,490,4.104166666666667
5724157,4,B00CJ7Y0US,"Garden of Words is the story of a teenage boys who hopes to design and make shoes when he older. One rainy day he meets a woman in a park. She is much older than him and as the movie progresses we learn more about each one. He is a bit of a dreamer who doesn't exactly fit in and she is a teacher (from his school, but he doesn't know it) who is the victim of a rumor being spread by a group of teenage girls which has pushed to to drink and not attending work.

I didn't find there relationship as creepy as other reviewers had - and I'm a teacher. I think there was a need which each had filled by the other - he needed encouragement to pursue his dream and she needed a wake up call to make a decision about her life and career. A small part towards the end of the movie I thought was a little odd - you'll know it when you see it - as it seemed a big over-the-top considering the tone of the rest of the movie. The conclusion though I found satisfying.

A lot of people have already commented on the use of a certain 4-letter. Please be advised it is only in the English version - if you watch the Japanese version with English-subtitles that word is missing. I also felt the inclusion of that word was unnecessary and perhaps more included to appeal to western countries...but me, I like the Japanese version.

Boy was I in for a rude shock with this particular one. It blew up in my face. There are a lot of very harsh curse words and violence, and more mature romantic themes suitable at best for an older teenager, not young kids.

Needless to say, after the movie was over I was pulled aside by my wife and got an earful for not looking at the rating before getting it. So just beware.

But for the film, of course, it cannot be fulfilled. In fact, this VERY short movie (more like a very long short, I would say, at 47 minutes), while leaving the pair in a teary clinch, does not tell us the end of their story.

To my deception, I found myself watching a movie with degrading elements: swearing, violence against women, substance abuse, yelling and emotions out of control. Nothing uplifting, as you get from Miyazakis movies.

If you're into anime's that has a lot of symbolism and has characters that you can relate to like in a slice-of-life anime, I HIGHLY recommend this movie. On the other hand though, if you're more into the wacky comedy, or action type anime's, I'm afraid you won't be getting to much of a thrill from this film. The film itself is very short (like 40 minutes) but what goes on in the film will give enough understanding on the powerful message Makoto Shinkai is portraying and doing all that with beautiful, I mean BEAUTIFUL artwork!",1427760000,,710,4.5546875

While I could watch it over and over for the visuals--the love of nature and the jarring contrast between the natural life and the urban rat race were just so lovingly portrayed.
But but but. . . I have to back up what other reviewers have said about the relationship being disturbing.  I'd be more worried about teenagers internalizing this than younger kids--[Spoiler alert]--the fifteen year old ends up having dinner at the teacher's apartment, and after a misunderstanding/blowup she clings to him, telling him he is the only one who could have saved her.
It over-simplifies and idealizes this connection.  So sad; the movie deserved better.  At its best, it was like Wordsworth vs. Kafka.  At its worst, a high school version of an AA pickup.",1426377600,2,891,4.746753246753247
5724204,2,B00CJ7Y0US,"I was quite disappointed with this movie and I will never watch it again. I purchased this movie after reading several outstanding reviews on the internet, including mention on several lists of top anime films. And the visuals were gorgeous: especially those involving rain and water and trees. The first 30-35 minutes of the movie were also good: it was slow to develop (which is fine) though some of the relationships among the characters were confusing. And I thought the major surprise of the movie was well done. But after the discovery of the womens secret, the movie shifted gears and the young boy's character morphed into something unrecognizable. The first confrontation (with the school kids) was weird and showed a lack of imagination on the part of the writers. The movie suddenly changed into an idiotic schoolboy fantasy. The second confrontation towards the end of the movie was even more disturbing, unrealistic, and out-of-character. And the final conclusion was creepy, as well as out-of-character for the woman. It appears that the writers ran out of ideas and decided to use clichs from previous teenage boy fantasy movies. I do not recommend this movie. I award it a 2, which is an average of 5 for visuals and negative 1 for story.",1426377600,4,1254,4.919811320754717

It is about a 15 YO who skips school on rainy days to spend time in a park trying to design shoes (he is trying to be a shoemaker).  During his excursions to the park, he encounters a woman who only drinks beer and eats chocolate.

The only issue I had with the storyline is that the boy is 15 and the woman is in her mid-20s.  He obviously will fall in love with her, but the age gap is pretty large.  The ending leaves you questioning the outcome.

One thing to note, the movie is very short, only about 45 minutes..",1424908800,,602,4.008403361344538

The loneliness you feel from certain characters, the weight and dreams of another the pain from both it was truly felt at the right times and made you really hope for them in the end. A truly splendid movie that I'm glad is now part of my collection.

I love the rain so when I saw the artwork of the rain in pictures of this movie I had to check it out. I was not disappointed at the attention to detail in the rain...as well as the attention to detail in practically everything else for the movie.

It has all the hallmark features of a cheesy J-Pop tune (occasional English word thrown in, male voice pretty but without any inflection, sweet harmonies) but it works. The song has nice textures and bears up to repeated listenings ... either that or I'm becoming more sentimental as I get older than I think healthy. Was it a good movie?

I've since rewatched it a couple more times, and I absolutely love it.  It's a bit slow and subtle, but I can appreciate it for what it is.  It really is another gem from Makoto Shinkai.

5724234,5,B00CJ7Y0US,"The artwork is completely breathtaking in this latest installation of Shinkai's work. I think he only gets better with time. That said, this is definitely not your typical film plot. It's more of a philosophical, rainy day, sit back and enjoy a cup of tea with it kind of film. I personally think the plot is very relatable to a lot of different age groups and personality types. Skinkai has a way of highlighting the real life problems, dreams, and heartbreaks of everyday people. In a world where Hollywood explosions and sappy Nicolas Sparks movies are the norm, Shinkai's films are a refreshing take on story telling and Garden of Words in particular is very ""human"" and definitely speaks to the heart. It's never really a good thing to compare one artist's work to another's but Shinkai reminds me of a mature version of Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki. If you grew up on those films, like I did, I highly recommend all of Shinkai's films.",1412726400,,939,4.696969696969697

Others may differ but I find animation a great way to demonstrate those things normally only seen in real person movies.

Aside from being one of his most visually impressive works, it captures a heartfelt story of two people with different paths in life as they try to find solace in the one thing that remains constant in their lives. Or at least, appears to be constant.

It's short, but pieces together nicely with decent character development. The dub is surprisingly impressive, as they act rather than voice-act. It's reminiscent of the Ghibli dubs. That difference gives the film a much more somber, realistic tone. However, there's always the Japanese dub with subtitles if English dubs aren't your thing.

5724267,5,B00CJ7Y0US,"I can not recommend this film enough, it is a masterpiece in its genre. Shinkai just seems to be going from strength to strength and what with the master, Hayao Miyazaki retiring, Shinkai's only serious rival is Hosoda.

The Garden of Words tells the story of a rather shy young man with an ambition to become a women's fashion shoe designer and a slightly irresponsible slightly older woman who sits with him in Shinjuku Park on rainy days. As the title suggests, the story is about communications, the things we say and the things we don't say. I shan't say much more because I don't want to spoil the story.

The environment created by the animators is really the third character in this beautiful, gentle story and boy-oh-boy, I bet few of you have ever seen animation this good and this stylish. Disney, eat your heart out!

The background music is almost entirely played on the piano and the score is as delicate and graceful as the animation. Children Who Chase Lost Voices, also by Shinkai, featured a similarly sensitive musical score.

5724268,3,B00CJ7Y0US,"""The Garden of Words"" had the potential to be an original, heartfelt movie. Takao's interest in making shoes intrigued me, and I liked that there was a substantial age gap between him and Yoshino.

Unfortunately, there just wasn't enough character development here to make me care about the characters or their relationship. We're privy to only a few of their conversations (the rest are skipped over in montage) before the dramatic twist. The climax is very dramatic, but since it doesn't feel earned, it errs on the side of melodrama. I was especially disappointed that the age difference didn't really come into play, except for the social stigma it causes; Takao is mature for a high schooler, and he and Yoshino might as well have been the same age.

There were some good things here. As in all of Makoto Shinkai's works, the environments are gorgeously drawn. I also liked how much of the characters' backstories were hinted at, such as when Takao remembers giving his mother shoes as a gift when he was a child. This didn't really make up for the lack of character development, since we don't actually get to see the characters respond to their situations, but it was a nice touch.

I think the main problem with ""The Garden of Words"" is that it's just too short to do everything it wants to do. It would've been a lot better if it'd shown more of the characters' struggles, given them more time to interact. As it is, it's not a bad way to spend 45 minutes, but I'm glad I only rented it.",1399161600,2,1496,4.574626865671642

The design of the environment, the colors and the animation show a great technique but wasted in a story of love that shows anything, the first minutes are about rain and how a man and a woman always go to the same shelter when it rains. Little by little they start to know each other better until they fall in love, the surprise comes when he realizes she's a teacher at her high school. At the end like any other story of Makoto Shinkai the interest is gone, sadness everywhere and the idea the characters are going to suicide.

5724272,5,B00CJ7Y0US,"To be blunt, I didn't find ""Children Who Chase Lost Voices"" to be very good.  But after hearing all the stuff about being the next Miyazaki, it's no wonder he wanted to take on a more food for the masses approach and bang out something a lot of  people would want to watch.  He even said himself he wanted a style, art style as well similar to what people expect of a Ghibli film.  But I loved the almost home-made feel I get when I look at some of those wonderful backgrounds in 5 cm.  It's like the difference between eating via a drive through, fast food joint or sitting down for a home cooked meal.  I'll take the homemade one every time.

I truly hope that Shinkai is not going to spend even an ounce of his time/effort trying to be the next Miyazaki.  But that years down the road people may call the next talented up & coming Anime creator ""the next  Shinkai""...  that's what I'd like to see.  And seeing him return to a piece that gives you many of the same things you got (and loved) out of 5cm... gives me hope that he will be true to himself.

This is where he shines.  Slice of life animes with themes (often) centered around loving & losing, and moving on... as time, distance, and circumstances beyond your control tear you apart.  And his beautiful background art... he really puts in the extra hours to make sure that not 1 (even seemingly minor) detail is overlooked.

If he bangs out a few more films like this he'll be at top of my list.  5cm is already in my top 5.  Also I like that you don't feel all films have to be 1:30+, to even 2 hours.  1 is plenty.  And also I like the chapters thing you did with 5 cm.  It got you to see it from 3 different perspectives, without making it feel like they were separate parts... clearly  all 1 finished product.",1396915200,,1775,4.1923076923076925

5724280,4,B00CJ7Y0US,"The art is what grabbed me at first sight of this short film. That, and the fact that it is a Makoto Shinkai work. This is a story about a love that blossoms between a mature 15 year old and a 27 year old who admits she's in arrested development since age 15. It is a relationship that could be considered controversial, due to the adult/minor nature of it.
27 year old Yukari doesn't have a lot going on in her life, romantically, hence when she chances to meet 15 year old Takao at Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden, time and again, and always on rainy days, the combination of chemistry, coupled with her arrested emotional development, leads to an impractical relationship with a much younger person.
As the story progresses, it emerges that she is a teacher at the same school which he attends. At some point, rumors fly and she loses her job as a result. There isn't a lot positive that happens here, on the surface.
While this is all happening, we're treated to absolutely stunning scenery and animation that is breathtaking. An incoming thunderstorm, with it's sudden gust of wind, followed by the first few large raindrops, rapidly escalating into a deluge, as our subjects seek shelter under a gazebo, is astonishingly portrayed with perfect sound and visuals. The viewer almost FEELS the rain and the moisture in the air, it's that realistic. The garden is a nice setting for a romantic story, and we bounce back and forth between apartment living, riding the transit system and this park several times as the story unfolds. It's all amazingly real.
I would rate it 5 stars if the story were as good as the animation. It's not a bad story. It's somewhat pathetic because it portrays a dysfunctional relationship. Like most of Shinkai's films, Garden of Words is less than satisfyingly happy. But there may be a tiny hint of hope, if they can hang on a few years until Takao graduates and finds a stable career.
If you appreciate fine art in motion, then this film deserves a place in your collection. It is a marvel in terms of artistic design and execution. It's story is secondary, but may appeal to some viewers more than others.",1394409600,6,2140,4.649076517150395

5724285,4,B00CJ7Y0US,"Anyone who is seriously interested in the art and craft of modern animation should put this short movie at the top of his or hers ""Must Watch"" list.
As an exercise in depicting the world around us, it is one the best animated films in the realistic style I have ever seen.
The portrait of nature and the urban landscape is remarkable in its beauty and richness of detail.
The blu-ray version includes an hour-long interview with the director and the two Japanese voice artists that impersonate the main characters.
The story has been stripped down to the barest of plots: it has essentially two characters -- and there is hardly any conversation between them. (In fact, the narration felt a little too thin to me, that's why four stars.) They are, for most of the 46 minutes of the film, an enigma to each other, and to the audience. We know more about one of them because the ""camera"" follows him for much of the time, so we learn that he is a rather mature and serious 15-year old in middle school, who thinks he has found an uncommon vocation (making beautiful shoes) that might take him somewhere else, beyond the confines of his unremarkable life, and is keen to find out if he is up to it. The other one is a 27-year old woman going through a rough patch. They meet repeatedly, at first by chance, at a gazebo in a park in central Tokyo during rainy days (he uses rain as an excuse to cut classes). This gives the animators plenty of opportunity to show some masterful visualization of clouds, rain and running water. There is a little drama towards the end, but nothing much happens that can be seen - there is plenty going on deep down, but one can only guess what that might be based on one's own experience of life. Definitely a movie for adults.
This short piece of graphic chamber music comes after Shinkai's previous full-orchestra, operatic fantasy-action movie ""Children Who Chase Lost Voices"", and shows that he can do equally well telling such different types of story.
After Hayao Miyazaki's retirement and Satoshi Kon's untimely death, Makoto Shinkai should be welcome as one of the most promising and brightest stars of Japanese animation.",1391385600,2,2159,4.639686684073107
5724286,4,B00CJ7Y0US,"The Garden of Words is about two people who are both, in a manner of speaking, Learning to walk. Takao, a 15-year-old high school student, is just starting to take his first steps in pursuing his goals despite the obstacles and with the encouragement of a woman he meets in the park. But he later finds that in the process he was able to help her back onto her feet after a hard fall.

The whole movie is really like one 46-minute music video. The characters movements and facial expressions have improved greatly since Makoto Shinkais last film, Children Who Chase Lost Voices, though they still retain a certain unnatural stiffness. The scenery is absolutely gorgeous, especially the water, which looks shockingly real. The music, while nice, is nothing really extraordinary except for the last piece, which is extremely beautiful and disguises the melodies of the credits song.

Neither of the main characters are so superficial as those in Shinkais previous films sometimes seemed to be; they don't simply exist to play out his latest bittersweet storyline. They are the focus of the story themselves, and they are as complex as real human beings.

All in all, this movie skillfully tells an honest story, and I think it is one of Makoto Shinkai's better films.",1391212800,,1265,4.874418604651162

It's about having someone there for you that you could connect with, in a emotion and real level, but not in a romantic way. I love how the rain represents their feelings and it also represents love, because love will always be there, even when you push it away. The english dub is very well done, it does have a couple of parts where the lipsync was a little off, but nothing bad, nothing that would distract you from the film. The music is amazing, and it fit's the mood of the film perfectly. So, like I said before, I don't think this film is about love in a romantic way, but love in the sense of companionship.

The rainy-day scenes in the park stand out especially, with leafy branches hanging low over water, but Shinkai devotes the same attention to urban scenes. He portrays the trains and rail station in just as much detail as the natural scenes - not better or worse, but an equal partner in the characters' surroundings and lives. I have to admit, I felt huge empathy for the high-schooler with interests far from other people's. Then there's that nasty whispering campaign - well, I actually saw one of those, with similar outcome.

Too much else really didn't work, though. Once Yukino's job became known, her relationship to Takao took on a creepy edge. And I have to wonder why her absenteeism (and drinking) didn't affect her job much sooner.

I suppose this might be OK for a teenager looking for a ""relationships"" movie, or someone so taken by the visuals that nothing else matters. Neither describes me, though. Five stars for the visuals, but the rest dragged my experience of this movie down - way down.

However, once I read that the film clocks in at 46 minutes of run-time I was preemptively disappointed and expected it to be way below the level of 5cm, BUT Shinkai managed to pull through and deliver because ""Garden of Words"" is simply fantastic! In some ways it's good therapy after 5cm's ending left me dysfunctional for a few hours.

All of them are works of art with the best character development in films I have seen. The most unforgettable part of Shinkai's works is the vivid portrayal of character emotions, and through which the inner struggles of multiple characters are steadily laid bare. In summary Shinkai's works are never action driven, but rather they are character driven.

In Shinkai's early works, one can sense a disturbing trend of faint silent despair permeated in all the protagonists; Distant Star and 5 cm are the most obvious ones. With Lost Voices and Garden of Words, a steady shift of Shinkai's outlook on the world is evident; the protagonists stopped being portrayed as the victims of circumstances in the society. With Shinkai's latest work, The Garden of Words, the old theme of lamentation has become a journey of inner strength and emotional growth. No scifi action, nor any grand scheme, is needed to steer the story to a satisfying conclusion in The Garden of Words. With two believable protagonists, a well crafted plot, and scores of artistic scenery decorated with masterful background music; I believe Shinkai has delivered his best masterpiece with The Garden of Words.",1383177600,,1373,5.021929824561403

What led to her drink beer and eat chocolate in the park? Why is she leading this kid along? Maybe Shinkai is adhering to the freshman film student maxim ""Show, don't tell"" a little to slavishly, because stark imagery and people staring longingly out of windows can only take you so far. By the time the climactic confrontation on the staircase occurred, I was ready to leave these two. If felt like I was trapped on a train with a couple having an embarrasing argument about nothing in particular.

If you're looking for a really good story this movie probably won't work for you (watch From Up On Poppy Hill or 5cm Per Sec.)  Despite that I believe it has a decent story with a very real and convincing issue, but the art is what I bought this movie for.

The characters don't really develop too much throughout the movie, but because it is so beautiful, you want to keep going because surely it must be going some where, right? Well, I was wrong. It goes nowhere. Just when you think some catharsis or breakthrough is going to happen, an incredibly annoying song breaks into the movie and overtakes the whole thing. Then, credits.

The backgrounds were lush and detailed, and the rain! When it was raining, which was a lot for a bit of the show, it looked so good and the raindrops landing on stoic water was PERFECT. The voice acting also needs an admirable nod (the English that is, I didn't watch it in Japanese). I had no idea what this was about, again, emphasizing the appeal of the animation, but I was pleasantly surprised.

A heartwarming tale (cliche phrase, I know) about unconventional love that must be prolonged until a more appropriate time, a story of redemption through love, and about finding the courage to believe in oneself and chase one's dreams. This really is not just a visually beautiful masterpiece, despite it's short length, it also has a strong foundation by way of the story to give structure for the art. This made me want to get 5 Centimeters Per Second (by the same director), but that is probably not going to happen (price and availability both suck).

5724343,5,B00CJ7Y0US,"With VOICES OF A DISTANT STAR (2002), director Makoto Shinkai proved that one person, working essentially alone at a desktop personal computer, could create breath-taking anime.  Working with others, he later fashioned longer more complex stories [THE PLACE PROMISED IN OUR EARLY DAYS (2004), 5 CENTIMETERS PER SECOND (2007), CHILDREN WHO CHASE LOST VOICES (2011)],  All of these films are visually stunning, but they remain centered on young people caught in the toils of emotions they can not clearly articulate or fully understand.  With GARDEN OF WORDS Shinkai takes on adult emotions and presents a situation that is both highly unconventional yet at the same time fully believable.  The director's unique ability to capture visual beauty in anime form is evident here in every frame (the story unfolds almost entirely on a series of rainy days and the views Shinkai gives us of water in its many forms are simply magical). But now there is also a clear plot with ""grownup"" goals at its center to capture and focus our minds as Shinkai's images delight our eyes.  The productions of Hayao Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli team, and works like this one by Makoto Shinkai, convince me that the medium of anime itself is slowly maturing. Just as ""manga"" in Japan and now ""graphic novels"" here in the West have evolved beyond plots and images calculated to interest adolescent boys (i.e., violence and sex), thoughtful, well-crafted anime capable of being watched again and again over the years, as you might keep coming back to a really good book, are out there if you look for them.  In my view, GARDEN OF WORDS  is clearly one such work.",1379289600,2,1633,4.916363636363636
5724344,5,B00CJ7Y0US,"Regarding the animation, it is deserving of it's praise. To be absolutely critical though, it's beautiful scenery is so well-animated that masks some of its recycled ""panning over the bridge"" and ""branches over the water"" scenes. Even so, it was pleasant to see, recycled or not. The animation of the characters and their daily routines outside of the beautiful scenery (i.e. at school, home or work) were also average. It's very possible though that said scenery just dwarfed everything else.

This is more a feat of animation from Shinkai, as the general theme is all too familiar with his other work and not quite as moving; It's a realistic telling, not always happy, of love. I felt like a scene from the end was almost chopped out to add that hole-in-your-heart/pondering sensation (of your life, the film or something in general) that I think shinkai goes for.

Overall - A worthy 45 min. If you like work from Shinkai, this is a familiar piece of work. If you haven't heard of him, this is a great introduction piece to his type of work. The films animation (whos sagging points are completely overrided by its great ones) will be talked about for a while too.

If your going to buy this, BUY ON BLURAY! This looks absolutely amazing on Bluray, and you will be missing out otherwise.",1379289600,,1291,4.70353982300885
5724345,5,B00CJ7Y0US,"Having just recently viewed this anime short film I am suddenly enamored with both inspiration and nostalgia once again for the culture and emotional drive creators, artists, and writers pour into a single moment in the genre. Truly, Shinkai derives his inspiration not only from studying the workings of fellow masters but also from endless hours, days, even years to develop his own style and focus to bring these masterpieces to life. Against the odds, and against all who judged it to be impossible, he has forged his own path.",1378684800,,531,4.911111111111111
5724346,5,B00CJ7Y0US,"Makoto Shinkai is a very interesting director/creator. His previous films have all been favorites of mine, and pretty much anyone I've convinced to sit and watch with me. The Place Promised in Our Early Days seems to be out of print and costs an arm and a leg on most sales sites. So instead of doing the whole rental thing (because eventually folks 'keep' the rented copies - then I'm out of luck!), I decided to start purchasing his films.

In his interesting and alternating fashion, this story, much like 5 Centimeters Per Second is in a more realistic and modern setting. I won't get into too many details, but it mainly involves a student and a young woman who meet by chance in a park based on Shinjuku Gyoen in Tokyo. (I love the warning at the end of the film: alcohol and tobacco are NOT allowed to be consumed in Shinjuku Gyoen park! Look for it in the credits!) Both seem to have their own personal issues, but instead of venting and whining, they quietly continue their respective introversion. One of the first lines in the film is a form of haiku (a tanka) that the young woman speaks to the young man. This tanka sets the tone for the remainder of the film.

Like 5 Cm, this is a slow film with sparse dialogue. Instead of filling gaps with words, Shinkai decides to use sound effects and beautiful imagery to convey his message. He has used a lot of very interesting themes and metaphors in this film. One will notice the use of water quite often. Also, much of the film is animated with windows or other clear objects separating the viewer and the character or the character and the scenery.

Though this is a shorter film from Shinkai, it is still a great film nonetheless. It is a beautiful piece of animated art. The combination of hand drawn art, painted backdrops, and computer enhanced and animated settings is splendid. I am a huge fan of his and this film is a worthy addition to his creations. Buy it now before it goes out of print and the price jumps to $70+!

It's the story about two people with complicated life's, looking forward to see each other on a rainy day. Ironically, as much as they are seemed to be ""away from the world"" they are actually been passing each other by for years. I never even heard about this artist until now, however I'm pursuing more of his works. The animations are amazing, the story is rare and unique, yet highly realistic and the music is perfect. The only negative was that the movie is only 40 minutes long! While the story does an amazing job telling everything with this time frame, it hits at the point where you ""fall for the characters"" and you would like to see more.

Shinkai declared that he wanted to do a true love story, but this movie seems to retread ground covered in his previous works namely ""5 Centimeters Per Second."" This would be a great love story if it weren't for the uncomfortable subtext created by the young man / older woman, student / teacher aspect of the tale. The ending, while hopeful and optimistic, still isn't 100% satisfying, in my view, which, like ""5 Cm"", leaves the viewer wanting more.

This blu-ray release is simply amazing. I want to see all of his movies on blu-ray now. Imagine if every Shinkai release could come with a director's commentary. I would love to have a BD release of ""5 Cm"" with a running commentary track. The Japanese commentary track IS translated and it's very entertaining to listen to. There is even a hidden surprise in the commentary track, Shinkai reveals an exchange of dialogue that occurs at the end of the film which was dialed down and inaudible in the final version.",1378166400,,1125,4.710659898477157

5724353,3,B00CJ7Y0US,"...I wasn't quite enamored with it.  As usual, Shinkai's animation is breathtaking.  Some of the shots had a palpable reality;  quite breathtaking actually.

The story line, to me, felt contrived.  It didn't grab me and pull me along.  More importantly, I never felt empathy for the main protagonists.  I'm hoping that  future viewings will soften my opinion of the characters.

Concerning the soundtrack by Kashiwa Daisuke;  some of the tracks in the film felt incongruent to me.  The music didn't quite click with me the way Tenmon's music did with prior Shinkai works.  To me, it felt like the music was written just to fill space while the film moved along.  The beautifully heart breaking and melancholy music needed in this film was not there; it needed Tenmon.

Let me say that I do not regret buying this disc but my  preconceived (and probably prejudiced) expectations of this film weren't quite meet.  Maybe next time?

It's probably just me but I have this sinking suspicion that ""5cm per second"" may be Shinkai's magnum opus.  Time will tell....",1377993600,47,1057,4.875706214689266

They slowly get to know each other, and as they get to know each other, they also get to know themselves better too.

It's an incredibly short movie, I really wish it had been just a little longer, but it is also very well made.  The story, animation, and cell coloring for this film is incredibly beautiful.  It's much like 5 Centimeters Per Second, but it focuses more on two people finding themselves with the help of each other.",1376870400,,721,4.303703703703704
5724356,5,B00CJ7Y0US,"ABSOLUTELY Beautiful!! Makoto Shinkai's Garden of Words portrayal of life is true beauty and a tearful hope. Showing life's difficulties, neglects, and lost of identity being silently accepted and ignored, Shinkai portrays life in need of care through the romance of two random strangers. The randomness of life, portrayed by the scenic animation, like the two characters, is itself romantic and a spontaneous harmony. The director still sees the beauty in life and its need of care. The whole movie concerns the neglected beauty of everyday life, which is metaphorically expressed through the couple's romance. Even their relationship results as a painful happiness and sad yearning.

This anime movies is very short but it will captivate/engross you like an infinite loop. You'll see life much differently after watching this.

Guilty Count #1: VISUALS

To this date, I have never, NEVER, seen an animated film with such flawlessness in the visuals. Reflections in windows or off the water were spectacular. There are some very beautiful scenes that definitely contribute positively to the story. I dare anyone to count the number of definable, individual leaves present on a single video still of the garden.

Guilty Count #2: STORY/PACING

Shinkai has found his niche in storytelling. He does a wonderful job with his focus on human emotions and relationship interactions. In my opinion, this is the FIRST time he has gotten the perfect pacing on a story. He has made many worthy attempts in the past, but this one takes the cake. Also, after the credits, he leaves you with enough to keep you from hanging endlessly off a cliff. I was very worried that would be the case, but I was pleasantly surprised with the end.

Guilty Count #3: VOICE ACTING

I cannot believe the quality of the English voice acting in The Garden of Words. It is outstanding beyond my wildest imaginations. The raw emotion can be felt in some scenes; it is shocking, dramatic, and immediately gets your attention. Never have I ever seen such great quality in voice acting before.

OVERALL

I like all of Shinkais' works, so I may be biased. When it comes down to it though, this would have to be my absolute favorite by him. I cannot wait to see another feature length from him. The only downside is that The Garden of Words is 45 minutes. I think it is perfect for the pacing, but I cannot blame others for wanting more out of the story. For $9, I would definitely recommend purchasing it before it goes up. It is a worthy buy for Shinkai lovers.

If you have never seen a Shinkai film before, I would recommend starting with The Place Promised In Our Early Days. If you start with The Garden of Words, I feel that it would set the bar far too high.",1375747200,,2041,4.46505376344086
5724360,4,B00CJ7Y0US,"Makoto Shinkai's latest film ""garden of words"" is another gorgeous piece of animation and storytelling. The tale of two people who meet by chance in a park one rainy day is filled with Shinkai's gorgeous skies, thoughtful attention to minor details and an appropriate music score. At about 45 minutes this movie does what it's supposed to do without a lot of filler or unnecessary scenes.

I wanted to give this film 5 stars but I did feel that this film explored themes already done in Shinkai's earlier film ""5cm per second"". I don't want to spoil it for anyone but there were similarities to me between both films conclusions. Still, this was a great film and had its own story, characters and issues to resolve by film's conclusion.

I recommend this film highly. It is absolutely gorgeous, intelligent and quite an emotional journey.",1375574400,7,838,4.8125
5724361,5,B00CJ7Y0US,"**Some mild-ish spoiler info**

There is quite literally nothing negative to be said about ""Garden of Words"" save for its run time. As emotional and dramatic as it is, I could have easily watched it - at its existing caliber - for several hours. I may have run out of tears, but I would have done it.

The match between this 15 year old boy (Akizuki) and a woman he meets in the park (but only when it's raining) grows from barely a nod and a random tanka as she walks away from their first meeting, into what can only be described as something quite possibly more powerful than love. If there is such a thing. Yukino's need for someone to listen, to understand and accept her isn't something I saw as ""tragic"" per se...more so something that she simply hadn't found yet even when she thought she had. Through a quick series of ""bad luck actions / reactions"" Yukino is thrown under the proverbial bus by some of her students and can't remain in the school where she is a teacher.

In an ironic spin, the one person who DOES understand her - and cares for her even before he realizes it himself - is a student from her school...though neither has ever seen the other at school. He is a self-trained cobbler, though he admits not a good one. He finally decides he wants to make shoes FOR HER; but shoes that will make her *want* to walk in them. And while the events aren't necessarily rushed in the 45 minutes of run time, we see the events unfold where she allows him to do just that, including being a foot model as they sit in ""their garden"".

Because I hate to say more than I have already, I will wrap it with: watching the ending is worth EVERY, SINGLE MOMENT spent to reach it. And by this point I was a blubbering mess! The emotions that riddled the screen and story, by and within all, but especially the final scenes simply MUST have been difficult to perform...because as a simple viewer it's difficult to watch and not want to drag Yukino into your arms.

These are two very powerful characters, brought to life in the most superb way and who create once of the most beautiful stories I have ever watched - whether anime or mainstream. I can only finish with, I am glad I own it because this is one title I will watch many times over...and while I have written many of them here, 'words' are incapable of doing justice to this utterly perfect artwork.",1375401600,52,2362,4.359090909090909

As expected from Makoto Shinkai the artwork is breathtaking and vibrant from open to close. Ending up around 45 minutes, I was left wanting more, however, thats better then a film being 20 minutes too long, and it is at least a satisfying ending. Sentai included a few extras, which they usually don't do, and they are a nice addition. It was nice getting to see stills of the VA's recording their lines.
