8197063,1,B000QRIKUY,"This is a complete and total kick in the teeth to our industry. This SOB has no respect for the art and history of tattooing if he is so quick to make a buck with 'do it yourself' DVDs to teach scratchers in their garages how to mess people up. Remember kids - you can't erase when you tattoo.

You want to be a tattoo artist - get a respectable apprenticeship from a reputable artist/shop and start at the bottom like we all did. You're not going to be Kat Von Dee after watching some low life's DVD. Hopefully you won't be Kat Von Dee at all - the world would be better if she fell off the face of it.",1231372800,5,603,3.9834710743801653

8197065,1,B000QRIKUY,"These videos are absolutely no help. I didn't learn anything from these, it was pretty much common sense.  He just tattooed and didn't explain the techniques. These are not informational or how-to DVD's. Do not waste your money!",1220313600,6,228,5.0
