Perhaps his name be reserved to minuscule halls of Art and Essay, recondite Cinema halls in France or maybe some cycle dedicated to revive the Japanese Cinema. But the certain of case is his minimalist style is closer to Bresson than any other filmmaker I have ever known. The word is a complement of the image, the organic edition allows to link two sequences thanks to the dissolving device, so common in Griffith and other giants of the mute Cinema. There is a great economy of resources but that is not obstacle for him, the agile and very human  script turns around the efforts of a beloved mother who knew to put over herself to the cruel adversities of the destiny after having lost a son and a husband, but with ferrous will and steeled conviction for making a better future for her remaining sons.

One of the most extraordinary Japanese films of the early Fifties.",1211846400,6,1125,4.788659793814433
