1675749,4,B00005Y8AA,"The three DVDs in MILL CREEK's KOREA: THE FORGOTTEN WAR contain primarily Defense Department films (""Combat Bulletin""), 30 minute episodes of a mid-1950s TV documentary series called ""The Big Picture,"" plus other miscellaneous contemporary war footage. Expect the usual amount of propaganda that comes with ""concerned party"" coverage. The images themselves (derived from vintage 16mm film stock) speak eloquently and reveal much more than any scripted narrator could ever do, so listen with a grain of salt, and watch with both eyes wide open.

1675750,3,B00005Y8AA,"The Korean War has been terribly under-represented in both print and documentary.  The late David Halberstam's work, ""The Coldest Winter,"" should hopefully rekindle some interest in it. This war certainly deserves better than this documentary. As typical of Timeless Media, this is really a series of newsreels of with a heavy dose of propaganda (decisively anti-Communist as a sign of the McCarthy era) trying to pass itself off as a ""documentary"" to the unsuspecting buyer.  While slightly better than ""The Great War: WWI"" another disappointing production of Timeless Media, it is, by no means, definitive.

Those seeking a more comprehensive examination of the Korean conflict would be better served by other series available elsewhere like, for instance, ""The History Channel.""  Buyer Beware...$9.99 is too much to pay for this set; I purchased mine at Ross-Dress for Less for only $4.99.",1210291200,31,892,5.35
1675751,5,B00005Y8AA,"This is another great package at a great price made by timeless media. This one has all of the Universal newsreels in chronological order. This serves to present you with something nostalgic, but also to show the propaganda that the american public was shown. You only get half the story here from the standpoint of the us military censors. This does include some great footage, but mostly in rear areas. This is a must have for Korean war history, even though other sources are needed for an accurate representation.",1196380800,24,517,4.820224719101123
1675772,2,B00005Y8AA,"boring.  black and white.  old.  it's cheap, and yea, it's informative.  but that's about the only positive things I can say about it.",1384473600,,134,4.695652173913044
1675773,5,B00005Y8AA,"Again, my father in law enjoyed watching this. Wanted to compare the history on this film versus him being there.",1382918400,,113,4.7
1675774,4,B00005Y8AA,"It is always enjoyable listening to other veterans speak of their experiences in the ""Forgotten War"" being one myself it keeps the memories fresh in this old head as it should.",1378339200,,176,4.709677419354839
1675775,5,B00005Y8AA,"With 2 exceptions, this is just a couple dozen episodes of The Big Picture, a Army signal corp propaganda news show dedicated to spinning history and footage in ways favorable to Uncle Sam. If you know your korean war history, you will see several distorions, half truths, and qualified statements designed specifically to give a better, false impression of the conflict and its conditions. There are even a few outright lies. I find the host, Captain Carl Zimmerman, to be insidious and I just generally don't trust him.

However, the footage is EXCELLENT. It was shot by very brave signal corps cameraman, some of whom died to bring this footage home. Right up there on the front lines, just about all the footage you'll ever see of korea comes from these examples. Many of those shots I've seen a half dozen times or more in different places, and one documentary on Youtube has them all but in COLOR with better sound!

Also, every show they interview at least one veteran, usually 2 and ask them about their experiences. It seems they were given strict orders about how to respond to most of these questions, and if you pay attention and know your history you can perceive them being slightly bullied by Capt. Zimmerman to give the ""right spin"" to events, but they sneak little hints through every so often, and one Infantry commander refuses to be manipulated to uses his 2 minutes in an awesome monologue in episode 3 or 4, where he pretty much tells the host to shove it!

2 episodes are independtly made documentaries, not The Big Picture, and the first is just as bad, the second is, while still propaganda for the US marines, has a few advantages. 1. its in color  2. the narrarator ""in the voice of the soldier"" is much more believable 3. the ammount of spin is down to reasonable levels and about issues any half patriotic and human person can sympathize with. Its called ""This is Korea"" on the 2nd disc

I highly reccomend this as a SUPPLEMENT to your Korean War education, otherwise the propagand WILL most likely severely taint your objective understanding of the war. Make sure youve read The Forgotten War and The Coldest Winter first to get a good idea of what actually happened with regards to things like winter clothing, ammunition stocks, equipment lost, etc... Or if you're a Korean War veteran, you already know, so watch, enjoy, and maybe youll see an old friend on the interview portion.",1371513600,,2413,4.695035460992908
1675776,5,B00005Y8AA,I really enjoyed this film.  I belong to a Korean War Veterans Color Guard and we're going to watch this sometime soon at the local hall.  It makes a nice addition to my collection.,1361750400,,181,4.294117647058823
1675777,4,B00005Y8AA,it was very interesting---people do not realize what our boys went through during those times---our service men should really be commended because they kept us free---they are not appreciated like they should be--,1357344000,,213,5.484848484848484
1675778,2,B00005Y8AA,"I served in Korea shortly after the ""cease fire"", and purchased this DVD for its historical content.  I was disappointed to find that it tuned out to be a collection of ""Big Picture"" propaganda films of the 50's era, and sadly lacking in history of the ""conflict"" outside of sketchy descriptions of the progress of the war.  It might better serve as a study of propaganda as it existed during that period, but its usefulness ends there.

This should not be confused with another CD collection with a virtually identical title: ""Korea: The Forgotten War 1950 - 1953"", and subtitled ""The true story of a brutal and bloody war.""  This I found to be a factual presentation of events, well organized and tastefully done - if war can be described in those terms.  There are in excess of 25 titles on Amazon combining the words ""Korea"" and ""forgotten"" so buyer beware.",1355875200,7,861,4.675496688741722
1675779,4,B00005Y8AA,"For the men and women who fought in this desolate ""Police Action"" I salute you. We forget how many men and women died in Korea in those three short years; 54,000+. We lost that many in Vietnam after eleven long years of battle. To claim this was only a ""Police Action"" was a serious blunder by Harry Truman and the United Nations. As the intro constantly reminds the viewer, ""this is war.""

I know it would have been in poor form for the United States Signal Corp to make mention of why the Chinese became so heavily involved and attacked our brave men while enjoying Thanksgiving Dinner. MacArthur was told numerous times ""not to bomb the Yalu bridges,"" or else. We found out what the or else was and Truman was forced to relieve MacArthur. Even after his brilliant execution of the Inchon Amphibious Assault he let his glory go to his head and decided he knew better then Washington. This is the problem when the glories of military victory are attempted to be parlayed into political positioning. Once again, MacArthur skated out with no appreciable damage. Wait no damage? Ask the Army and Marines at the Chosin Reservoir who paid for his arrogance with their blood.

I read many of the reviews that cater to the notion this a propaganda package. Look at the time frame when this was made. We were embroiled in the ""Cold War"" with Russia and her satellites. Is it full of American Propaganda? Yes. Was it a bit overpowering at times? Yes. But in reality it was perfect for its era. This was a recruiting tool for the Armed forces. Because of the current world atmosphere concerning Communism the Army was hoping to instill a volunteer army instead of obtaining men through conscription. We knew what Russia was capable off after the Berlin Airlift, but what of China? We were still feeling out Mao after he overthrew Chiang Kaishek who had escaped to Formosa. What the general public realized was, that communism in any form was unacceptable and threatened our American way of life of the time. If any of the local channels (three at the time) carried it, I never saw an episode, maybe because my parents weren't keen on war and didn't want it to peek the curiosity of their only son. I'm sure I would have been watching it.

I did have a problem with the sequencing of the selected stories. They didn't always follow what Captain Zimmerman and the other moderators said ""you will see next week."" I lay the blame for this problem solely with Mill Creek Publishing. Shows me the quality control was a bit thin and lapse.

Overall the video quality was okay. There were one too many repeats of various fighting scenes but they were appropriate for the topic of the day.

I did enjoy the story with General William Dean. I had never heard of him and did some research. He was awarded the Medal of Honor for his act in making sure his men were safely evacuated in the face overwhelming odds. He single handedly took out a T-34. That is no small task. Many Germans in WWII were not so fortunate. The T-34 might have been thirteen years old, but its sloped armor and 85mm gun were still a potent foe.

The interviews at the end seemed more natural with the soldiers especially with the nurse. She wasn't reading a script and her experiences were painted in her words and expressions. Maybe Larry Gelbart and Alan Alda would have benefited from watching some of these stories before they produced Mash for way too many years--eleven to be exact.

Overall, the three disk set gives a good overall picture of how brutal the Korean Conflict, excuse me, Korean War was and the political feelings of the time. It would be interesting to see how historians view and discuss this work in the next hundred years.",1337299200,4,3701,4.590015128593041
1675780,3,B00005Y8AA,"Despite less than perfect quality, this collection of 1950s-era film news clips about the Korean War is ideal for those interested in scenes of the war not often depicted in more recent documentaries. Worth the price.",1308096000,2,217,5.055555555555555
1675781,4,B00005Y8AA,"This set has been maligned by some reviewers for being propaganda from the Cold War and to a degree it is, but still the basics of the conflict are presented.  If you want an accurate overview of the Korean War, get the Timeless Media Group set ""Korea: The Forgotten War"" (I know, they're all called that - you'll have to look for the studio name); that set gives the basic rundown of the war with interviews of veterans and historians.  For my part, I have plenty of books on the Korean War to get an idea of what it was about; I wanted films from that era, free from editing, and that's what this set is.  This set is a collection of installments of ""The Big Picture"", a TV show produced by the Army to show the folks at home what Korea was like.  The Pusan Perimeter, the battle of Taejon, the retreat from the Yalu in the bitter cold are all covered.  So if you want scenes of the same tank rolling past some trees  over and over again with commentary by fat, smug historians, get the Timeless Media Group set;  if you want the original footage, get this one.  I've watched mine several times already.",1301011200,3,1105,4.304347826086956
1675802,1,B00005Y8AA,"Recently developed a strong interest in learning as much as possible about the Korean War.  Watched a few good series on PBS and the History Channel, so I went looking for DVDs on Amazon.  Really disappointed in this offering.  Here's why:

The product description states the program is ""a collection of documentary footage.""  In fact, it is a collection of newsreel shorts they used to play in movie theaters between features.  I guess you could describe that as documentary footage, but it is not documentary in the traditional sense of the term.  This is slightly misleading.

Everything else about the offering (packaging, quality of film-to-video transfer) was completely first-rate.

If you are interested in the newsreel shorts produced during the Korean War, then this will be a valuable addition to your collection.  For my money, did not find it interesting at all.",1296604800,16,875,5.098591549295775
1675803,1,B00005Y8AA,"This is the worst documentary DVD I have ever purchased and I have many. I wanted to learn as much as I could on the Korean Conflict and all I got was this... This is a U.S. propaganda film and nothing more. It is more about the people (from the US point of view which is slanted at the least) and NOTHING on the war, the strategy and the why. I tried to return it to Amazon but could not due to time of purchase. I wish I could get my money back!",1287532800,10,447,3.817204301075269
1675804,3,B00005Y8AA,"This was compiled from U.S. Army propaganda footage which softens the true reality of war. It gives good information, but misses on capturing just how intense the fighting was, i.e. ""The Bowling Alley"" seems to be missing. And the beginning of the war is not portayed correctly, although it does reflect how time was bought until we stood ground at the Pusan Parameter long enough for heavy tanks to arrive, etc. that allowed us to turn the war. Since I haven't compared it to other videos I do not want to be too critical. I wanted to experience, for example, what it might have been like to drive a tank as they were so important, but we weren't even shown inside of a Tank, etc. One last point - the Video fails to honestly explain how the Chinese gave us a day to engage in one of the largest mass evacuations by ship in a short duration perhaps in the history of warfare. Our Marines by the Chosen Resevoir had to fight their way in adverse conditions and losing half their force to make it to the Third Army that was preparing its evacuation to avoid an all out armed conflict with the Chinese Army who had come to the assistance of the North Koreans. Our intelligence failures about the involvement and impact of China's involvement is too down played.",1274486400,4,1259,4.478260869565218

1675807,4,B00005Y8AA,"Marathon Music and Video's production ""The Forgotten War: Korea"" is a good documentary of the Korean War.  So far, this is the most comprehensive compilation of Korean War footage I have seen.  The narration is good and supported by musical accompaniment of good quality.  The blow-by-blow of the war is accurately told as the videos constantly support the story.  I appreciated how nearly none of the footage was re-used in this documentary.  There are several interviews with U.S. Veterans, including at least two medal of honor recipients.  Their detailed accounts really made this documentary.  It is quite long, approx. 3 hours, but considering the war was over three years long, it is well justified and the result is greater detail and more footage.

I recommend this film for serious students of the Korean War and for high school and college level (combat footage with dead corpses are shown).  If used in a classroom setting, I highly recommend watching this with a map in order to follow the action as it moves across rivers, towns, cities, etc.",1261180800,,1056,4.954545454545454

1675809,4,B00005Y8AA,"Hsaving served during the Korean War, the DVDs brought back memories.  Some of the merories I would just as soon forget.  The coverage of the war was excellent.  It provided information that was not normally known by those who served outside of Korean.  The DVDs provided a good idea of the mountainous country our service men and to climb and the difficulties the mountains provided.  It provided good coverage of both the ground and air operations and the value of each.",1231200000,37,472,4.777777777777778

The DVD came up recently and I seized the opportunity to see the ""forgotten"" war, or in my case ""missed"" war. The DVD is based on consecutive newsreels which tell the story of how the war started, the allies who fought, the McArthur situation, and how the war ended, setting up a political situation that is with us today.

7956837,4,B00005Y8AA,"If you want the North Korea version of the war told by the likes of Frank Burn's from MASH, this is a great documentary.... This is not to say it's a bad thing, it's just saying that it's VERY 1950's propaganda....

There is a different version, that is told by soldiers who were actually there, on camera, describing exactly what occurred, along with the pertinent footage, in a storied and proper timeline. That version is the 2010 version under the same name as these disks ""Korea: The Forgotten War"" a 4 disk series.

However, you can get both copies for under $15, and it's totally worth it, because you get both versions, the way it was sold to the American people too keep their hopes up in the fight against communism, and also the soldiers version who had their own opinions on what happened, and I will let them speak for themselves.",1453593600,,843,4.5394736842105265

They actually are rather old footage and commentary from the period or at least 1950s. Not that I will say they are bad but certainly not as engaging. It also seems to be slanted towards the Gung Ho side instead of closer to the reality of what the soldiers and pilots experienced. I'd guess that most of these were newsreels or at least made for a similar purpose.

They are not bad, but with today's use of computer maps and interviews with the veterans who were involved makes viewers want to get into the subject. Unfortunately, when it comes to Korea I haven't been able to find a series like that.",1425254400,,748,4.420289855072464

Useful for its visuals of American soldiers in combat, observing their uniforms, equipment, transport, aircraft, etc. Very helpful in picturing the hilly, scrub land of much of Korea and its hot summers and freezing winters. As a historical document portraying the actual combatants and battlefields its priceless - for the very interested viewer.

However, it's also incredibly dull. The newsreels provide minimal information (the viewer at that time was likely assumed to have newspaper accounts for background) and the narrators mostly merely describe what's on-screen. There's no analysis of events, no interpretation from a historical perspective, no discussion of the Korea War's significance.

I give it two stars for the visuals.",1385942400,,804,5.628099173553719
7956845,2,B00005Y8AA,"I can't recommend this DVD much at all. It's wartime era newsreel footage with no analysis or interpretation. The presentation is so dull that it's hard to stay awake through it; even if you do (and I did) you won't learn much about the Forgotten War in terms of its origins, significance, battles, strategy, tactics, politics. I think this is because the newsreels weren't intended, at the time, of being informative as the general public then had the basic details.

However, I did think the DVD's visual presentation could give interested viewers an idea of how the American troops were equipped and outfitted, the hilly terrain they fought in, the hot summers and freezing winters they endured. The sense of this being a thoroughly unglamorous war fought in scrub-land for villages and burnt-out cities is also conveyed. So that's something I suppose; this wasn't WW2 Pacific fighting nor Vietnam jungle warfare.

Still, I think you'd have to really be motivated to watch this more than once. If that.

Two stars for visuals.",1385942400,,1029,4.97093023255814
