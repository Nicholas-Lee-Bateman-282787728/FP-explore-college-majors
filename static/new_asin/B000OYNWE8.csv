8187735,3,B000OYNWE8,I love to see films in praise of old women......I mean how often do you?  I liked the different women they showed and talked about but found myself wishing the quality was a bit better and that the film flowed more and then I would want it to be longer.  Still it is certainly worth a look to see what these amazing women are doing!,1351641600,,332,4.092307692307692
