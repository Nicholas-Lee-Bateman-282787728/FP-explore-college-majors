7904981,5,B000006RYF,"Great movie in the widescreen director's cut format. They should come out with this widescreen director's cut on Blu Ray. The theater version of this movie is terrible and destroys the story line. I saw the director's cut first before the theater version and really enjoyed it. If it was the other way around, I probably would have never watched it again. The difference between the theater version and the director's cut is incredible. The THX has better sound quality and the picture is obviously better with the widescreen from the non-widescreen director's cut. This version is a must have for a fan of this movie.",1491696000,,618,4.839622641509434
