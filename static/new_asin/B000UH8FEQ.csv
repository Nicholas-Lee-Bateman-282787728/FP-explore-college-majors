8213277,4,B000UH8FEQ,"I enjoyed this film, especially because it wasn't predictable! It examines the lengths to which a man will go through just to become what everyone else expects of him, even deceiving those he loves most. His unhappiness with life and ultimate descend into his tragic conclusion is poignant. The film is shot very well and the acting is great.",1233100800,,342,4.813559322033898
