926039,1,6304806450,"This is one of those ""Flavor of the Month"" flicks. It does good in the box-office and at the video store but there's nothing more to it. I found myself bored on the second viewing. It's like the movie ""Bad Boys"" it just had stars that you wanted to see but the plot was rather dull and predictable. I recommend ""Rush Hour"" if you want fast paced action and laughs.",983923200,3,364,4.214285714285714
926040,4,6304806450,"Perhaps the biggest problem in Eddie Murphy's career always was, that people expected him to be a fast talking guy whose mouth gets him in and out of trouble. As soon as he tried to escape that formula, viewers were in for a disappointment and found his movies below than average.
If you leave that behind, ""Metro"" is a solid action movie with a couple of remarkable stunt scenes. It's also very delightful to see that it tries to leave some of the usual ""veteran cop gets rookie partner"" routine behind and playfully mocks some standard suspense elements: you see a young girl in front of her opened bathroom mirror searching for something. The music swells. She starts to close it and what does the viewer expect? To see the face of the killer in the mirror. But nada. Those are really refreshing bits.
Murphy's performance is quite solid, the story is what to expect from an action movie and refreshed, as I said, by the bits above.",978998400,11,935,4.571428571428571
926041,5,6304806450,"It says on the box, ""Murphy is funnier than ever!"" Well in parts he is, but generally I wouldn't agree with this statement. It is not supposed to be a funny movie, on the contrary, it's quite serious, but it's  probably the best action movie I've seen, particularly interesting at the  end when his partner who is a sniper can lip-read what he is saying and  helps him. From beginning to end, and excellent movie, highly recommended.",954201600,5,433,4.597402597402597
926042,5,6304806450,"Eddie Murphy is just superb(he's never made a bad movie) as a San Francisco PD hostage negotiator who's the best in the business. When his partner is murdered while visiting a suspect in a jewellery robbery, he  tries all he can to get his revenge and track him down. As well as all  this, he's trying hard to sort out his personal life! There's a good twist  to which member of his family he's wanting to visit all the time(just when  you think OH MY GOD IT'S NOT ANOTHER DIVORCED COP WHO WANTS CUSTODY OF HIS  KID, you'll be pleasantly surprised!), and there's also one hell of a  spectacular car chase down San Francisco's steep streets! The DVD quality  on this recording is just fine in sound and picture quality, the action  never stops and Murphy, in a partially serious role, manages to throw in a  few funny lines to please his comedy aficionados.

is a winner.  Eddie Murphy is a hoot as one of the good guys chasing a seemingly unstoppable bad guy throughout the City.
The chase scene involving the cable car is one of the best and scariest chases I've seen in a movie.  If you loved the one in
Bullit,  you are going to be thrilled by this one.  It's like a unrelenting ride on a roller coaster,  Good fun.

926181,4,6304806450,"If you enjoyed BHC 1-xxx, you'll enjoy this. The white ppl are less stupid in this compared to bhc movies. So the ""judge reinhold character"" is actually a real character with real conversation and talking points (even if somewhat out of order) - looks soooooooo much like judge reinhold and I say this as a fellow totally pale person.

It was a decent movie. Nothing ground breaking, you're not going to feel compelled to do anything moving/better/awesome in your life, but you may feel compelled to visit Tahiti. But you know, your commute might do that so....

Fine flick.

I'd watch again.

Enough tension to be concerned about gore/violent against individuals that I looked away from the screen - hey, I'm freaked by harry potter and even Bridget Jones so fyi(commitment issues, don't judge me). Reasonable flick. Okay for kids 8+ with some guidance. What I actually appreciated the most was that the characters of color were no different from everyone else - this is an old movie (i'm viewing in 2016 for the 1st time) but there was no agenda about color, creed, or gender which is AMAZING because everything since 2001 seems to be about crazy-f-ing-uber-""tolerance"" even if those same ppl hate my values. Worst I can say is - if you stretch it - made the Italians look prone to stupidity or mental illness. In all fairness the Sopranos made Italians look worse so.... And, travel to Italy (#anywheremediterranean) with a natural blonde and you'll see worse behavior. I speak from much experience.",1472256000,,1502,4.85546875

926326,5,6304806450,Metro was one of my favorite Eddie Murphy movies because it was similar to the Beverly Hills Cop movies and the 48 Hours movies.,1408924800,,128,4.375

926328,4,6304806450,"In my opinion, this movie, Metro, is the best Eddie Murphy movie that I have ever seen and known, and it's my all-time favortite Eddie Murphy movie. I would watch this movie over and over again with my favorite regular and fight scenes with Eddie Murphy. I even like the romantic scenes with Eddie Murphy and his girlfriend in this movie. Movies with Eddie Murphy I don't like is Life, The Nutty Profesor, Norbit, Dr. Dolittle, and most of his newer movies. Along with this movie, I would watch Eddie Murphy's 80's and early 90's movies; except Boomerang, Vampire In Brooklyn, and The Nutty Professor. I would even watch the Daddy Day Care movie that came out in 2003 along with this movie; that wasn't too bad of one of Eddie Murphy's newer movies. I remember back in 2011, the very same year and time when the Tower Heist movie came out in theaters, I bought this movie for christmas as a gift to myself and I have pretty much enjoyed watching it. I just know that I wouldn't want to see anymore movies than this movie, Metro, with Eddie Murphy. In this movie, I also find that Eddie Murphy looked more distinguished and did a real good job acting in this movie, and it would hurt for me to see him play other characters in other movies that came out after this movie; like Life, which is something I don't ever want to see or watch again; plus it would be a waste of money for me to buy them. One thing about Eddie Muphy I don't like is seeing him dress up like a woman or an old man in his movies; except ""Coming To America,"" and he doesn't do any of that in this movie. This is the Eddie Murphy that I like to see play a cop, fight bad guys, and play regular roles.

I also remember that this was a movie that came out in 1997, and it is still a good movie with Eddie Murphy. I would say that I would even watch this movie, along with Eddie Murphy's 2011 movie, ""Tower Heist."" I find the scenes from that movie looks similar like this movie, Metro. Even when that movie, ""Tower Heist,"" came out in theaters back in 2011, I went to go see it with Eddie Murphy and I found it interesting.

Other movies with Eddie Murphy that I would watch is

""48 Hours""
""Another 48 Hours""

""Trading Places""
""The Golden Child""
""Coming To America""
""Harlem Nights""
""Boomerang""
""The Distinguished Gentlemen""

""Beverly Hills Cop""
""Beverly Hills Cop 2""
""Beverly Hills Cop 3""

""Daddy Day Care""

I have all these other set of movies with Eddie Murphy, and I would sometimes watch them, along with this movie. This movie, Metro, is also a movie that I would want to best know Eddie Murphy for.",1408060800,,2572,4.345833333333333

926404,4,6304806450,"The greatest movie ever? No.  But, I've never visited Sand Francisco.  A friend who lived there recommended watching this.  He supplied a commentary on all the background shots, so I felt like I had had a great tour of SF until I can get there myself.  The film is entertaining and it will catch you up.  So, if you want an intro to SF or if you're an Eddie Murphy fan you will win.  If you're both, then go for it ASAP.",1392249600,,420,4.060975609756097

926407,1,6304806450,Eddie Murphy's attempt at a serious crime drama was even less than lack luster.  Murphy has proven himself a good comedic actor and should continue that genre.,1369699200,,159,4.888888888888889

926474,3,6304806450,"as I said in another review, this is one of those movies Mr Murphy made due to name recognition in the hopes of cashing in some money in between Beverly Hills and 48 hrs. This one he's not anywhere near the caliber of those two.films. (forget Beverly Hills II and III) not even worth mentioning them. It contains a bit of action and funny lines from time to time, but nothing extra ordinary.",1354752000,,391,4.36986301369863
926475,5,6304806450,"As I was looking through Eddie Murphy movies I came across Metro, and thought, ""Hmmm let's take a look at this, it may be interesting."" By the look of the cover it looked like a comedy...Boy was I wrong. The first 5 minutes alone proved that the movie was going to be an action pack thriller.

When people think of Eddie Murphy they think of The Klumps, Coming to America, Trading Places, Norbit, and movies of that nature....basically comedies, but this movie showed that Eddie can play a serious role and do a good job of it. I give this movie 5 stars and 2 thumbs up. I highly recommend! Enjoy",1310256000,2,596,4.36936936936937
926476,4,6304806450,"Michael Wincott made the movie as the physco killer, the movie was predictable as Murphy being superman saving the day.  I almost expected him to start flying with a cape.  Some of the action situation scenes has Murphy catching the bad Guy with unbelievable stunts.  Michael Wincott is by far a superior actor, and should be the starring actor, but, he's not Black.  Murphy should stick to comedy on stage.",1247270400,,407,4.771428571428571
926477,4,6304806450,"I agree with the spotlight reviewer that every time  Eddie Murphy plays a different character from Axel Foley everybody starts to dismiss the movie. But Metro was pretty good and Eddie Murphy excelled in a role nobody expected him to excel in: the serious role.

Plot/spoiler: Eddie Murphy plays a cop/negotiator who meets his match with a twisted villain, Michael Korda(Michael Wincott) kills his partner and he sets out to bust him. With the help of a new trainee, Kevin McCall(Michael Rapaport) Scott sets out to catch the elusive killer.

Opinion: Eddie Murphy does well as Scott Roper. even though its a serious role he does have his moments of hilarity. The only flaw of this movie is Michael Wincott. Its not like he cant be a great villain(remember him in The Crow?) but he looks agitated as if he didn't want to be there and you can see it in his face. Other than that the action scenes are pretty good and Murphy's character has chemistry with Carmen Ejogo's character(Veronica) as well as Rapaport's character. If you can let go of the Beverly Hills Cop days you might like this one.",1226275200,,1094,4.6875
926478,5,6304806450,"I can't believe some of these reviews. Eddie Murphy gave a great performance in this one, as did everyone else. Metro is the story of how a big-shot detective, Scott Roper (Eddie Murphy) cracks a hard case. Now, the convict has actually broken out and taken someone dear to Roper hostage. It's up to Roper to retrieve not only the stolen goods, but now to rescue his girlfriend and put an end to all this chaos. This is a well-played Murphy role and should be seen at least once.",1114819200,13,479,4.393258426966292
926479,3,6304806450,"This not Murphy's best movie. However, it is a very good movie. Not predictable as some believe. The bad guy, Michael Rappaport, is especially well known from other similar roles. So do expect some nasty treatment to people. I for one kept expecting his partner or girlfriend to be killed. I wasn't exactly on the edge of my seat, but you will have to wait till the end to see if they survive. The rest the cast does a good job of support.

I paid about half of what Amazon is selling this movie for so I don't feel cheated at all. I bought this for little more than the price of a rental so I went in with few expectations. With Eddie Murphy in it I figured I wasn't taking much of a chance. I was glad to see I was right. There are several other recognizable people in the cast. Picture and sound quality was excellent. The directing, sets, and music are all as good as you will see in most movies. I imagine if it had just a little better story with more Murphy comedic antics it might have been a hit. This is pretty much a serious role. I bought it thinking I would probably watch it once and give it away, but I ended up sticking it on my shelf for future reviewings.",1089158400,6,1173,4.144736842105263
926480,2,6304806450,"This film is lackluster and often unintentionally comical. Eddie Murphy is the Johnny Appleseed of handguns is this film.  He uses a clip, tosses the weapon, uses a clip, tosses the weapon over and over and over again.  San Francisco PD could solve their armed street crime problem easily if they would just get Murphy off the streets.  He litters the streets with enough guns to arm a small army.  Too much gun play, not enough consideration for a quality script.  Give this picture a miss.",1066953600,2,491,4.662790697674419
926481,2,6304806450,"This is the kind of boring, by-the-numbers kind of movie that you find yourself forgetting even as you are watching it. Eddie Murphy hasn't made any good movies in years (unless you count his voiceover in Shrek) and is still living off his reputation from Saturday Night Live and 48 Hours and those were a LONG time ago.
Basically, a ""This Time It's Personal!"" thriller about a hostage negotiator who turns homicide detective -- breaking all the ...uh...rules, pissing off his boss, etc. -- when his partner is killed by a master jewel thief (Michael Wincott). There is a hint of something interesting (maybe in an earlier draft of the script?) when the jewel thief is initially introduced as a kind of gentleman crook,a mild-mannered jazz buff and for about five minutes you think that maybe something clever and sophisticated will develop here. But the thief quickly metamorphized into a psychotic killer who stages his theft as an ordinary smash-and-grab event with lots of carnage and hostages taken. (Think about how STUPID this is, to draw this kind of attention to your crime and how it just about ensures you will not make a clean getaway and that the police will pursue you endlessly.)
After the thief is captured, he makes an improbable escape and goes after Murphy's beautiful girlfriend, although there is not the slightest way he could have known who Murphy was dating, let alone where she lived. A dumb, silly plot device and one that has been used and used and used, especially on TV, so it's REALLY tired in a big budget film.
Similarly, hints that Murphy's character has a gambling problem and money problems are presented and then disappear as if they also belonged to earlier (and better) drafts of the script.
Trust me, you will forget this one even before your VCR finishes rewinding. A COMPLETE waste of an otherwise talented cast. You won't miss missing this one.",1065225600,5,1886,4.824074074074074
