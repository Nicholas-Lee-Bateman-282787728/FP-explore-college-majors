659846,2,6303358365,"A well-worn story about a marketing executive who starts a phoney religion only to discover that bilking people out of their money isn't worth the loss of his morals and his love. The actors all do a good job (including Sandra Bullock, in what I assume is an early role), but the elements of this film are just too tired to really make it worth the time it takes to watch.",991008000,7,372,4.253521126760563
659927,4,6303358365,I enjoyed the topic this movie is about. Forming a corporation for a new religion and the turn around of the originator is a new idea. Not a remake of an old idea.,1354406400,,163,3.9696969696969697
659928,2,6303358365,"This movie was a waste of time, weak plot and uninteresting.  However, Sandra Bullock was as beautiful as ever.  Was not something I would watch again.",1352937600,,151,4.769230769230769
659929,4,6303358365,"Ms. Bullock is in this movie, (and gives an excellent performance in her small, but pithy part), but this is not a Bullock movie for those who want to view Bullock.

This is a neatly-crafted, 1989-vintage ethics and morals spoof on what happens when success becomes your god.  (In this case, George Plimpton).",1301011200,,309,4.811320754716981
659930,1,6303358365,This is obviously an early movie of Sandra Bullock's and not up to her current standard. The plot is totally predictable. Not a recommended movie.,1283644800,,146,4.88
659931,1,6303358365,"This movie is by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  It's not worth buying it, let alone renting it.  Even the cover of this movie is bad.  It shows Sandra Bullock in the foreground but she only plays a supporting role in the movie.  It's the man in the background (Jonathan Penner) who has the lead role.  It makes me wonder if the cover was made this way just to sell the movie.  Penner loses his job and starts his own business by making his own religion but it was done in poor taste.  Even if you are a Sanra Bullock fan, there are far better movies than this one.",1187395200,2,580,4.035087719298246
659932,3,6303358365,"I saw this film for two reasons. First of all, the plot sounded interesting, and the second reason was Sandra Bullock. The story is about a man who starts a new religion in order to make money. It's a great idea, but it could have been carried out in a better way. As for Sandra Bullock, she only plays a minor role and it's far from her best work.

Overall, ""A Fool and His Money"" is an average late-1980s comedy. I didn't think it was as bad as the other reviewers, but also not great. Sandra Bullock fans may want to check it out, but be aware that she only plays a supporting role. The DVD has no special features and is pan & scanned (fullscreen).",1158796800,3,652,4.174603174603175
659933,1,6303358365,"Without a doubt, this is the worst movie ever made, in any genre, in any decade, by any movie making company since the begining of motion pictures. Who ever put Sandra Bullock's image on the cover of the DVD should be arrested for false advertising, since Sandra is only in the movie a few minutes, and isn't very good in her role anyway. What a bomb, and that's an understatement. Don't rent it, don't buy it, and don't ever watch it, unless you are completely without anything to do, and want to find out for yourself just how bad a movie can be.",1137196800,6,548,4.330097087378641
659934,1,6303358365,"WARNING! Do not waste your money or your time.

Sandra Bullock is not in this movie enough to warrent the packaging headling her as the star. [...]

The sound quality is really bad, as well as the lighting and if they used a script that too.

Run from this movie.",1126828800,20,263,4.22
659935,1,6303358365,"Being a huge fan of Sandra Bullock, I bought this movie thinking it would be fun and cute like her other work. Nope, this movie is garbage. First thing I noticed was that the sound quality is extremely poor which goes along hand in hand with the poor camera angles and shoots. The acting is very bad and the story line is simply ridiculous. Over all, it's not a movie worth buying.",1125100800,20,381,4.305555555555555
659936,2,6303358365,"I admit it. I bought this one because I think Sandra Bullock is beautiful and she looked nice on the box. I need not have bothered. She is a very minor character with minimal screen time. She does well in her few moments but that is not enough to make this a ""good show"".

The story revolves around a Madison Avenue type who thinks he has a divine mission to found a new religion. He sets about hsi task with all of the market research tools at his disposal and manages to fleece his flock of much of their disposable income. Near the end, he begins to see the light and reforms himself.

There are a few brief moments of laughter, a few moments of Sandra in briefs but the the redeeming moments are all too brief.",1113955200,34,714,4.204379562043796
7848139,1,6303358365,I was very disappoint in this movie.  I love Sandra Bullock but she as a very small part and the scripted is very poor,1463961600,,118,3.9166666666666665

7848144,2,6303358365,"The DVD is incredibly poor quality.  Appears to be a direct transfer from VHS. Not at all restored for DVD quality. Audio and picture are poor.  Unless you're a fan of Jonathan Penner and/or Sandra Bullock, do not buy.  On IMDB this is known as ""Religion, Inc."" by the way.  The film, the screenplay, well, it's pretty weak and kind of bizarre.",1384646400,,344,4.5
7848145,1,6303358365,"If the only reason you pick up this movie is to see Sandra...like me and my wife did don't bother, she's only in the movie for about 4 minutes onscreen.",1364601600,,152,4.1
7848146,3,6303358365,The film was okay but the presentation of the packaging makes it look as though it is a major Sandra Bullock film when her part in the film is of very small time.,1362182400,,162,3.9393939393939394
7848147,1,6303358365,"I'm a huge fan of Jonathan Penner based on his winning personality on three seasons of Survivor, and because of that, I've started tracking down his films. When I happened across this one, I was surprised I had never heard of it--especially considering that it apparently starred Sandra Bullock. So, I bought it, watched it, and now I know why. The 2004 DVD cover has more production value than the movie itself. This looks extremely low-budget. Not Clerks low-budget, but about as close as you can get in color. It looks like it was shot on VHS. Sandra Bullock is barely in this movie and Penner is terrible. I mean, really bad. I feel bad, because I like the guy, but this is not his best. even Down Periscope is better than this--by a lot! In fact, Penner's own personality in real life is far more charming than most of the characters he's gotten to play, which is a shame because he is so likeable. He needs something developed just for him. Wish I had the means. If I were going to recommend a Penner movie, I'd say The Last Supper or Let the Devil Wear Black, both directed by his wife and both solid, under-seen films (the latter is really hard to find, though). Or, maybe just watch Survivor Phillipines again.",1361750400,,1219,4.495495495495495
7848148,1,6303358365,"I do love Sandra Bullock and that is the only reason I rented it. I set a record and pulled it out of the DVD player after three minutes. I usually give a bad movie longer than that. Forget this one. The sound is bad, the camera angles are hideous, the dialogue is forgettable and inane, the scene lighting horrific. It does not deserve a quarter of one star.",1355097600,,359,4.217391304347826
