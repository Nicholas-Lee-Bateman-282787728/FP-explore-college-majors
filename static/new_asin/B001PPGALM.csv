8334091,3,B001PPGALM,"My frustration with this DVD is that the quality isn't great and it only has 4 episodes picked at random from the entire 14 year series.  I found out that Sam Nelson (Ricky Nelson's son) is actually raising money to restore the entire 435-episode series of ""The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet"" and include the original commercials too! He hopes to have the entire series restored by the time ""The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet"" is inducted into the Smithsonian.  Apparently, the completed series will be ready roughly around Dec. 2014.",1319500800,,538,4.9010989010989015
