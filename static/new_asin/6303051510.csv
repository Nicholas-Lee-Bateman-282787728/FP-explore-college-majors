7835481,1,6303051510,This may very well be the worst film I have ever seen.  I can not believe that it won the awards the cover states it did.  It is confusing and very difficult to follow what is happening.  You have to figure it out on your own.  It did have an interesting twist on the Merlin story and possibly had potential.  Don't waste your time on this one.  Your not missing anything.,1018137600,,372,4.169014084507042
