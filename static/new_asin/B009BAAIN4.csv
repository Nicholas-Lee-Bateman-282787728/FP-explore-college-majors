8539406,3,B009BAAIN4,"I really enjoyed the first episode (Route 30) and was looking forward to this sequel.  However, the acting was disappointing and the story line fell short of being entertaining.  I'm debating whether to get the third episode when it's released.",1362614400,,244,5.075

8539408,5,B009BAAIN4,"My husband loves to find strange, funny quirky films - I usually sit there and read - but this was FUNNY - recognized most of the actors in the film - as a matter of fact I think one of the leads is the girl from that TV show ""Two Broke Girls"" (or something like that) - we never saw the first film but now we want to get that . . .",1348185600,,332,3.5616438356164384

8539411,5,B009BAAIN4,"I stumbled upon the first movie on netflix. It was a lovely depiction of life in a simple, rural area. I honestly didn't know what to expect from part 2. I love it. Great story and very funny. Love the characters as well. Bravo. I can wait for part 3",1347840000,,250,4.02
8539412,5,B009BAAIN4,"I laughed from beginning to end.  You don't have to be from rural Pennsylvania to recognize these characters; there's a part of all of us in them.  You also don't have to have seen the first of the films in John Putch's Route 30 trilogy to enjoy this one--though I recommend it, as well.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Route-30-Special-Edition-DVD/dp/B0068R65QM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Route 30 (Special Edition DVD)</a>

Writer/Director Putch has assembled a very strong cast and his quirky sense of humor, creativity, and great visual eye come through in this film.  Guys will particularly have a blast watching this.  Grab a beer and some peanuts and enjoy the show!",1347753600,,716,5.912621359223301
8539413,5,B009BAAIN4,"Since I was familiar with John Putch's acting and directing work, when I found out he also made his own independent films I decided to check some of them out. The first one I saw was Mojave Phone Booth and it blew me away. It was dark, sexy  and emotionally moving. There are images from that film that stay with me still, (Christine Elise McCarthy standing by a swimming pool while wisps of black video tape fall from the sky all around her is one. Check out the film to see what I'm talking about.) Then, I saw the hilarious, Route 30. Like Mojave Phone Booth, the structure of the film is separate stories linked by a common theme.  In one of them, Dana Delany turns in an extraordinarily deep and funny performance as an Amish woman who plays hooky from her daily life by popping over to a neighbor's house to watch soap operas and drink beer. If that performance was the only good thing in this film, (which it isn't), it would be worth the price of the DVD.  So when I saw that Mr. Putch had a new film available I rushed to snap it up. This new film is wonderful. It's charming, kooky hilariously funny. Its different in structure than the other films I mentioned in that it is one continuous story in which all the characters interact with each other instead of a series of separate episodes, and I think this new structure is his best work so far as a writer (although knowing something about film-making  [I'm an actor] I'm guessing it was a bear to make). The cinematography is fantastic. Even the special  effects are great and so funny (watch for the tomahawks coming out of  adorable Beth Behrs of TV's Two Broke Girls, chest). Like in the other Putch films I've seen, the acting is top notch. Curtis Armstrong kills (no pun intended) as an overzealous deer hunter, and Tony nominated actor Lee Wilkof who originated the role of  ""Seymour"" in Little Shop of Horrors on Broadway (yes, I'm a theater buff too) is great as ""Rotten Egg."" One of the things I most appreciate about Putch's films (at least the ones I've seen) is that they all have rich, multi-layered roles for women. In Route 30, Too! he does it again. Brigid Ryan's performance as ""Mean Mary"" is the standout here. Her ""Chambersburg PA"" accent alone had me on the  floor. Route 30 Too is a funny, heart-warming, eat-a-large-bowl-of-popcorn-while-watching, good time. I recommend it highly. And as an independent film supporter, I  can't wait to see what Putch comes up with next.",1347753600,,2456,4.551020408163265
8539414,5,B009BAAIN4,I saw this film in Chambersberg PA I laughed from the opening moment to the closing moment...  It was a wonderful heartfelt trip with these creatures and characters...,1347753600,,167,4.964285714285714
