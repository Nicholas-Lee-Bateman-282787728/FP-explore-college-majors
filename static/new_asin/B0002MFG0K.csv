2104549,3,B0002MFG0K,"It did nothing for me.

I'm a fan of the comic from back in the day, but this movie fell short for me.

The animation was weak - way weak compared to today's standards. It reminded me of the animation for the Spawn Animated series that was on HBO in the late 90s.

The voice acting was okay, but the sound quality wasn't all there.

The story was fun, but the ""big"" fight scenes could've had a little more punch, and not seemed so one sided.

I hope this movie revitalizes Lady Death and makes the comic #1 again :) Thus hopefully spawning more dvd releases :)

2104551,5,B0002MFG0K,"I've been a longtime fan of the Lady Death comics so it was with great anticipation that I looked forward to this anime. For the most part, I was pleased with it. Although, there were certain things that I disliked about it but it didn't take away from an otherwise awesome cartoon. Chaos Comics fans are definitely going to like it, that's for sure.

Hopefully, with this anime out, it will generate interest in Lady Death comics again. True, she fell while she was on top(as Chaos Comics went under) but she is making a comeback. Slowly but surely, we'll find out the continuing story in the life in hell she leads and see if she'll make it back to the world of the living.

2104552,5,B0002MFG0K,"Coming from probably one of the biggest Chaos! Comics fan in the world, I loved this movie. To me, it redefined Lady Death and without compromising the original Chaos! Comics story too much. The backgrounds were amazing and really set a convincing Hellish atmosphere. The characters looked great. Pagan, Lucifer, and Vassago looked exceptionally well but I didn't think that Lady Death herself lived up to the others. There were key moments where her looks stood out as larger than life, while other moments she looked a bit silly. I think that the main reason why I didn't always like the looks of Lady Death in the Movie was because I am usually spoiled by seeing her beautifully illustrated by very talented artists such as Steven Hughes or Ivan Reis (just to name a couple) and seeing her in any other way requires more adjustment than I was able to give. I loved Lady Death's outfit. It resembled her classic clothing in ""The Reckoning"" but had hints of the gold royalty look displayed in the ""Crucible.""
The sounds in the movie were also good. I liked the added touch of random screams from the unseen souls in Hell. The sounds that Lady Death's energy made was unexpected. I'm not sure if that's how I imagined it sounding or if I ever really thought about it at all. I never anticipated it to sound electrical, but more as a bass-humming. The voice acting was well done. Lucifer sounded threatening, with no care and Lady Death sounded powerful, yet not as deep as I thought, but it doesn't mean that is a negative response. Plus, the music was enjoyable and added to the excitement mainly towards the end, building up a climactic finish. It wasn't as noticeable in the beginning, but really added to the story during the finale.
The story featured in the movie was also based on ""The Reckoning."" It wasn't huge and complex, but it was enough to make a satisfying movie. I was worried that Lady Death would be a bit tame in this movie but not to worry, she is still the classic Bad Girl as she has always been. Not as much of a [...]-goddess as I know her as, but she hasn't lost her touch. I won't bother breaking down the story, you can get that from every other review and description.
The DVD packaging and menu is nicely done as well. The cover art features a chromium finish and the layout is top-notch. The menu's are animated and look very professional, and impressive.
On the flipside, there were a few things that I didn't like about the movie. The only character I wasn't really thrilled about was Niccolo. His character was a bit too exaggerated in the way where he was too perfect. Even though I do understand that he was apart of Hope's innocence, he still looked and acted a bit too fake. And I was thankful that the After-burning Hope with the short hair didn't last long because I couldn't stand the thought of Lady Death without her long, flowing, almost-alive, hair. At times, the animation looked a bit rough but the landscapes, story, and characters always directed your attention away from the flaws.

[...]

Overall, it is a great movie, and a great achievement for Lady Death. I was glad that it didn't abandon the comic and also happy that it didn't conform it too much for the movie, but that is probably because Brian Pulido was an active participant in the making of this film. Whether you like the comic or not, this movie is still excellent. If you are a Chaos! Comics Fan, you already own it, if you are not, what are you waiting for?",1096934400,6,3473,4.5374800637958534

2104564,4,B0002MFG0K,"I've been a follower of Lady Death for more than 5+ years.  I will say the movie is not a perfect rendering of the original comic book series, however it is very close to the original story.
If you give yourself a good suspension of disbelief you will probably enjoy the settings, and the plot of good vs. evil.
What is best is Lady Death herself, the strong heroine that defies many odds to overcome the evil she sees.  The problem with this movie is more a result of its shortness.  If it was a little longer, and focused more on some side filler it would be nearly perfect to story.
However, for what it is I give it good reviews.  It is perfect for any Lady Death collector, or anyone who loves a good classic story of good vs. evil.  There are strong christian elements to this story, despite what critics might think, it does have depth.
Also, it has some mature themes, and violence so probably not good for kids.  It would be appropriate for teens, and young adults however.  There is of course some suggestive sexual themes, but no real interface so to speak.
I would give it a 4/5.  So, if you like a dark fantasy, with some strong undercurrents of hope against terrible opposition, it is great!",1364601600,,1205,4.396396396396397

2104572,2,B0002MFG0K,"Director Andy Orjuela drags us to Hell, where the Devil's minions rebel and bikinis are the only protective gear you get.  Based on the comic by Brian Pulido (who co-wrote the script), the film centers on the daughter of a Swedish warlord--actually Lucifer in disguise--who challenges her father after taking the rap for his rampage on Earth.  One of the movie's selling points (besides the obvious) is the solid plot that it could've had.  But Lady Death spends so much time sword-sparring, sleeping, and dragging around severed heads, that it makes her hour-and-a-half run feel much longer.  Add to that the stiff animation and endless bloodshed and by the film's climax, you just stop caring.  It feels like you've lost years of your life, and that's how I'll remember this.

I am one of the biggest Lady Death fans with having comics,litho's,statues,and a full picture tattoo of her from head to heel on my back and even with all the so-called negative reviews I still love this movie. The anime style actually works really well for this picture. Hope is wrongly accussed by the town of devil worship after her father escapes into hell leaving her behind. She is then burned at the stake only to be saved by a prayer her father taught her. Hope realizes her father is Satan after he saves her and Hope is delivered to hell. Satan has his own evil plan in the works the whole time. Hope receives help from  an unlikely ally and is transformed into Lady Death during her training. Lady Death must now stop Satan in a battle for hell. The movie does stay true to the comic and the origins of Lady Death for one hell of a thrill ride from start to finish. This is an awesome movie that any true Lady Death fan will love. If you want to nitpick about every detail then you won't enjoy it,but if you take Lady Death for what she is,a sexy as hell, ass-kickin,demon slaying vixen that will set your heart racing,then you will appreciate this picture. There is plenty of blood,and gore with sweet battle scenes that are very cool with the anime style. Bottom line take the good with the bad and enjoy Lady Death kicking some ass!!!

2104576,4,B0002MFG0K,"I'm submitting this review because I disagree with the overwhelming 1-star reviews (or maybe I have low standards).  One thing I critisize about American-made animation is the emphasis on entertaining the toddlers and childish-minded audiences.  If I want to watch animation with drama, suspence, & adventure geared towards adults, I have to look towards Japanese manga.  I was pleasantly surprised to find this story (graphic characters & violent scenes) was geared towards mature audiences.  However, I must factor the possibility the reason I found appeal in this movie is because I've always had a fascination for femme fatale characters, both fiction & real.  It's my personal belief that archeologist are holding back on their reports.  If ancient armies were comprised of mostly men (as depicted in movies) and ancient battles were a test of attrition between 2 forces, it leaves to reason with so many men being killed in combat, there should've been a shortage of fighting men.  Towns, villages, & cities should've experienced at least a 2 to 1 ratio of women to men, with so many men getting killed in combat.  Yet ancient records reported no disparity in the population ratio of men to women, which implies ancient armies were comprised of both men & women'  From a strategic perspective, it's logical to train women to be skilled archers and have fighting men on the front lines, while women armed with bows & arrows in the rear; or to assist in operating the catapults (trebuchet).  In WW1,  European nations began training and using women in the trench wars due to a shortage of men to recruit.  I've digressed from the main topic, but getting back to the movie, I hope to see a sequel to Lady Death.  I will summarize this story as your classic I've-been-wronged-&-I-want-retribution story. ---  Furthermore, I must respond to ""Twist's"" review, posted 4-26-2010.  Recollect as she was burning at the stake, demon hordes answered her prayer when she invoked the devil's prayer.  She went to Hell in both, body & soul (or at least that's my interpretation of the movie).  It was only her mother's soul that was imprisoned by Lucifer.  Niccolo was never shown dying in real life, but only in her dreams, to imply he was no longer in the world of the living.  Lucifer had taken Niccolo in body & soul and imprisoned him for eternity.  This is why he was coughing, bleeding, and had lesions throughout his body when he was reunited with Hope (Lady Death); though he was in hell, he was still in his physical form.  The story is a 5 star, but I'm subtracting 1 star because I believe she should have saved Niccolo by carrying him to a safe location, then returning to battle Lucifer.  I judge animation by it's story, not graphic imagery.  Thus, there are others who will disagree with my rating because they place (too much) value on the graphic quality of animation.",1302998400,,2877,4.826530612244898
2104577,3,B0002MFG0K,"I wasn't completely stunned with the movie. They could have done certain things with it. But overall, this movie just lacked what I wanted of a Lady Death movie. I only got this movie just to see what it was about & for it to go with my Lady Death collection.

Sadly I am disappointed with this movie. The animation wasn't what it was cracked up to be. I would only recommend this if you're a hardcore collector of Lady Death. But rather than unwrapping it and seeing this movie, keep it sealed. It's not that great.

P.S. Those who were expecting nudity, you'll be very disappointed because it doesn't show any.",1299283200,,612,4.455357142857143
2104578,4,B0002MFG0K,"Does she look like lady death? Hell yeah...

Does this feel like the comics? NO.

The animation could be better, there is no doubt about that. I have to agree with the other reviewers as well that the movie felt like it just ran too fast. The explanation of why she wants to kill Lucifer? Absolutely understandable...How she became Lady Death? Also understandable, but more time should have been spent on her training and understanding her powers. Instead they showed a midling length training session where we are supposed to assume that she spent ""years"" training (this is accomplished by wardrobe changes in the ""extended"" fight scene).

Addtionally we are supposed to simply understand why souls in Hell are afraid of dying. There is only one explanation that makes any sense at all in this regard; you are already dead, you exist only as a soul in Hell. Soo what's left if the soul is destroyed? Nothing. Since I have read a lot of religious and occult texts this wasn't too much of a stretch for me but since most people don't read such things this really should have been explained in the movie but it wasn't.

Normally I don't do or like spoilers but there is one thing in this movie that REALLY bothers me; mainly because it throws my explanation of soul destruction under a bus. In order to save his soul Lady Death must kill Nicolo so that his soul can be released and go to Heaven. My problem is simple; how the Hell is Nicolo ALIVE in Hell? Living creatures cannot exist in HELL!

My final complaint is the ending: It does end but it also has an open ending?! C'mon! They aren't going to make another one, they never intended to make another one; so why give it an open ending? That's just mean!

Call me crazy, but regardless of my complaints I still found this to be a thoroughly enjoyable show.",1272240000,,1810,4.519877675840979

The story like is more creative license with the comic book character. The origin story is good..BUT it is not the comic book's Lady Death.

With many under animated films lately, this is quality anime which  shows thru.  The lead  animator had previous worked on Batman the animated Series and It shows in some of the action scenes. This is an adult cartoon, not something that Disney or Warners would do

I found this less gory than it should be. It should have had more violence..and It was a let down. Especially when Death challedges the Lord of Darkness.

Okay that's oversimplifying, but the parallels are several and Lady Death debuted but a year after Todd McFarlane's demonic anti-hero took the comic world by storm.  Her foray into animation isn't awful by any means, but it does look shockingly like a more violent and sexual version of something that would have aired on Saturday mornings when I was a kid.  That is not a compliment.  But first let's set up the story.

Hope is a sweet young girl in love with a lame dweeb named Niccolo.  Her daddy is a crusader for the Church who claims to be taking villagers for God's army.  That is, until it turns out he's The Devil himself stealing souls in the name of God because he's a jerk like that.  Daddy escapes, leaving Hope to bear the horrific brunt of the villager's wrath and offering her a chant that will grant her eternal life as a parting gift.  As the pyre's flames burn the flesh from her body, she screams the words out in agony and is taken to Hell by flying demons who pluck her from her demise.  Once she gets home, she finds Satan holding no only the soul of her lover, but that of her long-departed mother hostage and demanding her obedience.  She spits in his face and is banished into the depths of The Abyss where she meets Lucifer's ex-blacksmith who has designs to overthrow big red, who apparently spends most of his time on a throne watching his fork-tongued concubines feel each other up.  Not a bad life, I suppose.  Anyways, turns out being the daughter of the Prince of Lies brings along with it some pretty killer telekinetic powers which the newly anointed Lady Death (having abandoned Hope) learns she can channel through objects such as swords.  She begins gathering an army of disloyal demons to overthrow her father and there the fun begins.  Pretty cool, yeah?

The first thing I noticed about ""Lady Death"" was the rather dated look to the animation even with the anime-influenced art style.  This film was made five years ago.  Come on now!  I have no problems with old school animation for the most part.  Heck,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vampire-Hunter-D/dp/B00004Y7JH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vampire Hunter D</a>&nbsp;is among my favorite films of all time.  But for an adult feature film that came out just a few years ago to look like an early-90's kid's show, I've got to take a point away right off the bat.  I haven't read the comics, but I've seen many images of the character and the illustrations I've seen are striking, ethereal, and less in the tone of 80's adult animation cheesefest&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heavy-Metal/dp/0767836316/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heavy Metal</a>&nbsp;the this.  The voice acting is average which I find shocking considering ADV Films once had an amazing stable of voice actors that infused their early anime DVD releases with dubs that were often superior to the original Japanese language tracks.

All superficiality aside this is still not an outstanding production by any stretch, but it's certainly not a total loss.  I mean, did you not read the plot summary?  Naturally, there comes with the infernal setting a fair amount of dark and demonic imagery. Lots of maggot-ridden corpses and beasties, and did I not mention fork-tongued lesbian concubines?  There's also some decent violence, mostly beheadings and the like, and of course plenty of fanservice from The Lady herself, but I've seen it all done better before.  But what can I say?  I've got a thing for animated anti-heroines crusading through Hell on a mission of bloodshed.  It's not the best comic book adaptation out there, but I do think it's really cool that a company like ADV is trying to branch out and bring animation fans something really cool that isn't just a Japanese import so kudos on that.  Unfortunately, animation costs a lot of money and this one was very obviously made on a small budget.  Better art and animation could have made this really killer.  But still ""Lady Death"" is worth a look if this is your kind of thing and is worth supporting because American animation for grown-ups can be hard to find.",1251849600,2,4786,5.319148936170213

I got into Lady Death when I was in junior high; naturally my motives weren't completely intellectually driven, as you should be able to tell from the cover of this movie.  As I got older I still appreciated the character and comics for what they were, but I certainly wasn't expecting anything profound at this point, nor was I when I picked up this movie.  I was pretty excited at first because I thought this story would be a great animated movie.  I was looking forward to seeing ""The Reckoning"" in film format... that's definitely not what us fans got.

Unfortunately if you're a fan of this comic then this does not recount the tale like you read in the comics.  This feels way more haphazardly thrown together and really doesn't do the original writing justice.  Frankly, I don't exactly know what happened.  What I do know is that Chaos! Comics ended up going bankrupt during this time.  They actually filed for a chapter that requires you to sell off all assets, not the one where you get government protection to keep your business going, no, everything had to go.  However, Brian Pulido did manage to hold onto his rights of the Lady Death character and she now appears with him under Avatar Press.  During this fiasco this motion picture was being made, and I suspect that because everything else was tied up in legal issues he couldn't use the original story line from ""The Reckoning"".  Maybe he no longer held that copyright.  I think Pulido wanted to give his fans a film somewhat in the spirit of Lady Death at least, but his original story line was so much better than what we got here.  I know the man is a film major and really into film in general, but I really think this could have been done a little bit better.  Personally rather than recounting the origins of Lady Death I think maybe he should have written a whole different tale considering everything else was tied up, but maybe he couldn't?  I really don't know.

In the end we have a film that is very loosely based on the original ""The Reckoning"" story line, but with a way more disjointed feel.  Like Lady Death ends up in Hell for totally different reasons, also her father is a vastly different person as well.  Cremator's role isn't explained very well at all, but they probably weren't allowed to use his original concept.  Not to mention whoever did the voice acting for Cremator was not a good fit at all, in my opinion.  However, I thought Lady Death's voice actor was suitable, so for that I was glad.  Even Purgatori's character was all wrong in this and she's my favorite Pulido character!  I don't know what more to say about this because I don't want to give too much away, because it doesn't make a lot of sense anyway and people will just get confused.  But for example, Lady Death ends up fighting all these demon lords that aren't even in the comics, never mind the fact they have nothing to do with her rise to power in Hell story line, but yet they're worked in?  Lady Death's realization of her powers in this is so sudden and haphazard, that it doesn't show that she was in Hell for a while before she really started figuring out how things work there in the original concept.

Overall the animation is on par with cartoons you'd watch in the early 1990's.  I know this will seem quite poor for a 2004 release, but you have to remember the creators and artists are into nostalgia.  It's really no different than the art we saw in the original comic book series back in 1994.  I can see why people would complain about the animation in light of today's work if they never read this comic from 1994.  The most impressive thing about this movie was the soundtrack, which I thought was excellently powerful.  However, I really can't see many people buying into this film, fans of Lady Death and anyone else for that matter.  I can see what Pulido was trying to do, but I really don't think it worked overall.  I mean, I don't remember ""real"" Death showing up at all in ""The Reckoning"" and then her stealing his powers?  Basically she realized desire is power and then made the eternal graveyard in the comics.  That didn't really happen at all here... ah well, if it comes to take it or leave it, I'm leaving it.",1215475200,,4556,4.472154963680388
2104584,3,B0002MFG0K,"If you're a Lady death fan then this is a fairly straight animation of the Chaos comics character, there are a few variations to the storyline, which outlines the transformation of Hope the nave girl to Lady Death Queen of hell, but nothing drastic. The style of the characters is also not that far removed from the graphic comic originals, though Lady Death herself is perhaps too much of a goody two shoes to jel with fan expectations. But despite this keeping faith with the source material it's not particularly good, in the extras the production team blather on about the wonders that new technology have brought to the film animation scene, but unfortunately Lady Death itself is a very poor illustration of this technology. Ten years ago and we'd have thought it a competent if uninspiring anim, but when you compare it with its contemporaries, Ghost in the Shell 2, Metropolis, Appleseed and Sky Blue which are all a qualitative quantum leap ahead of this and you'll see how low budget and disappointing it looks.
Now I happen to think Lady Death is worthy of a sequel, but it needs to be much better than this. The world of animation moved on and somehow Sunmin studios missed it, producing something a decade out of date before it hit the screen. They make much of having done Batman the animated series and that appears to be about their level, when the chance came to step up to the plate and do a movie, they fluffed it.",1204243200,,1433,4.6015625
2104585,1,B0002MFG0K,"I just wanted to add to everyone else, and say that this movie sucked if your a fan of the comic or just someone who like more adult animation please skip this movie. The animation is terrible, and the voice acting is craptastic. When the devil is speaking you cant even hear what he is saying. The audio on his voice is way lower then the rest of the cast. The frame rate on the animation is so pore that sometimes the characters look like they are moving in slow motion.

2104586,1,B0002MFG0K,"I just finished watching this movie and I can honestly say I am truly dissapointed. I am not very fussy with animation as I am a big fan of the genre but I highly doubt this will remain in my collection. The cover art is soooooo good you just can't wait to get home and watch it but the  animation is actually very poor (for a motion picture) and lacks that detail and shading you enjoy in most anime's. It is of the quality of your saturday morning cartoons (I have seen some with better). I also found a lot of the action sequences very repetitive. The story moves too fast and you feel no connection with any of the characters introduced. This is a real shame as I can see potential in these characters.

In regard to the dvd the sound and picture quality are fine and it has a couple of extra's.

In conclusion don't waste your money unless it's super cheap!! You will enjoy Vampire Hunter D or the short film Blood much much more than this.",1182643200,2,945,4.238888888888889

with names like cremator it totally blows.... lol..... not even worth getting as a free copy.... we caved half way through and put in something else.... full metal panic was a better thing to watch on halloween.

2104589,1,B0002MFG0K,"You might think I don't have a right to review this film, since I never finished watching it. But I spent nearly twenty dollars on this turd of a film, and I feel obligated to prevent others from wasting their valuable money.

To start, it's published by ADV Films, which will throw you off since it's an American style animation done by a Korean studio. Now, I've seen some animation produced in Korea, and I can say that none of them looked this bad. Lady Death reminded me a lot of Thundercats (sorry Thundercats) in style, only in today's world that's unacceptable. The story, at least as far as I got into it, is about a young girl banished to hell by Lucifer where she gains strength and returns as the Lady of Death. Controversial, sure, but in a way that has already been done (remember Spawn).

I'd recommend anything else over this. If you truly want something animated, buy the Spawn series that started on HBO, or get Thundercats, which are available now on DVD.",1129680000,4,974,4.528409090909091
2104590,4,B0002MFG0K,"I have seen several bad reviews and thought I would add my two cents. I had no idea that this was based on a comic series when I saw it.

The plot is simple and easy to follow. A girl in dark ages has her world turned upside down when it is discovered her father is actually the Lord of Lies (Satan). He escapes into a gate to hell and leaves her behind to face the villagers. They burn her at the stake for the sins of her father. At the last moment she recites the prayer of her father and decends into hell. (This all happens very early in the movie so I'm not giving anything away really.)

She discovers she has been tricked by her father, that whole Lord of Lies thing. She vows revenge. The movie then follows how she goes about it.

If you are looking for a mentally challenging anime this isn't it.  If you are looking for one you can follow easily and just enjoy then this is a good anime for.  A kind of popcorn anime. Just something nice and light even if the premise is dark and slightly disturbing.

This movie is best enjoyed for accepting it as it is. Comparing it to Vampire Hunter D is unfair as they are very different in concept and style. Just remember anime is like American live action movies; they are all different and not meant to be all alike.",1127001600,5,1270,4.163265306122449
2104591,3,B0002MFG0K,"I have to admit that I hadn't read the comic book version of ""Lady Death"". I rented this out of sheer curiosity when I saw it on the website of my online dvd rental service. The premise of the film sounded intriguing. A young girl Hope is the daughter of a mercenary named Matthias who isn't what he appears to be. When villagers make accusations against Matthias for a fiery incident at his castle, Hope is punished for her father's crimes by the townsfolk and is burned at the stake. When Hope is reunited with her father in the underworld, she finds out his real identity as Lucifer. She quickly rejects her father's offer to rule the underworld and conquer the world together. Her rejection automatically sends her to Lucifer's former comrade Cremator. Under Cremator's tutelage, Hope slowly transforms into Lady Death both physically and emotionally. Lady Death is determined to bring down her father once and for all.

I personally liked this movie. It isn't perfect. I have seen better animation from other anime films. The animation just seemed dated and didn't lack the vibrant colors or the amazing visuals that films like ""Ghost in the Shell"" or any of Hayao Miyazaki films possesses. The dialogue was terribly cheesy and unintentionally hilarious. I bet a chimpanzee could have written better dialogue than the humans that came up with this script. Despite the unimpressive animation, thin plot, and unintentionally funny dialogue, I still found this film rather entertaining. I guess I can chalk it up as a guilty pleasure for this reviewer.",1123200000,10,1554,4.931297709923665

2104598,1,B0002MFG0K,"Well, I can honestly say that this is the first time that I experienced a film that had literally no meat or potatoes in it.  The entire film felt like it was just the salad with no main course.  The story line was fallible and laughable, the characters were one-dimensional, the realism was out the window, and the animation was done by four-year olds.  Does that cover it?  I have never been more embarrassed for a concept in my entire life.  I have never read the comics or seen the other programs with this character, but from the looks of the other reviews I am not off base with my observation.

To begin, the story moved too quickly.  For someone new to this character and situations, I needed more built into creating the reasons instead of finding the solution.  I have seen other Anime (if you could call this one an Anime) that do great things with their characters because they take the time to develop them.  There was nothing set aside for Lady Death.  In a few short scenes, we see her train with Cremator and instantly become this aggressive she-beast of Hell.  This was hard for me to swallow, considering moments before she was introduced as this weak and feeble woman controlled by her father.  Suddenly, she is immersed with hatred and can do battle with an existence that has been around for millions of years.  This was absurd.  The presentation of Lady Death was poor, to say the least.  I felt as if she was nothing more than an animated character instead of a desperate woman with revenge on the mind.  For me, it just didn't work.  She was nothing more than eye-candy for prepubescent boys wanting to ogle the mass quantities of skin that she suddenly grew on her chest when training with Cremator.  Oh, I felt sick just watching her.  The same goes for the character of Cremator.  Who was this random person?  The explanation they gave wasn't enough, and instead I was left with more incoherent babbling than actual development.  It is a very sad day in Hell when we forgo characters to show more violence and action, especially in an animated feature.

Next, there was Lucifer himself.  Let me just say that I think I could do battle with the King of Hell and survive.  He was weak, his voice was laughable, and he just didn't represent the image that I had in my mind.  It was as if Disney was in control and wanted to make him semi-PC.  He lacked the darkness and corrupt nature that Lucifer embodies.  He was not the ruler of Hell, but instead just a lackey that had a bigger place to live.  Speaking of living or dying, how can you die again in Hell?  That was a concept that definitely needed more explanation.  Most of the characters were worrying about dying, when they didn't even consider the option that they were already dead.  That is how they got to Hell.  I think it was this level of thinking that ruined the film for me.  I didn't quite capture the notion that your soul was still in a solid body in Hell, but that could just be me ... or maybe it was because there was NO DEVELOPMENT in this story.  There was nothing built, just preparing.

The battle sequences were hysterically bad.  The animation in this cartoon felt like it was made in the early 90s.  There was nothing impressive about the way that this film was drawn.  Why are we, America, so behind on animation?  It is huge in Asia, and it is creeping in hardcore here because we keep making films like Lady Death that do not challenge or use any part of imagination.  We are cheap, and this film shows it.

Overall, this film was bad.  The animation coupled with the horrendous voice work was cheap.  I had head somewhere that this film as in production for a long time, which is hard to understand because I think I could have made this film on my credit card.  The production was horrendous as well as the story.  Nothing was developed, leaving huge gaping plot holes that nearly everyone fell into.  The strength of the characters was missing, and nothing was explained.  I wasted my time with this one and would like to warn others so that when Death does come, you don't find yourself in my state and regretting the fact that you wasted 80 minutes on this piece of garbage.

Oh heck, just for giggles, lets also point out her trusty companion is a horse (She-ra..cough).  With all that said, this movie still rocks.
