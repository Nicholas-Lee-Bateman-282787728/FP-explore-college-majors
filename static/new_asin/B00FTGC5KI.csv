8618565,4,B00FTGC5KI,"This is one in a series of reviews that will eventually be posted for every Alice in Wonderland title available on Amazon. When the Tim Burton rendition of AIW with Johnny Depp was due out in 2010 I thought it might be a good time to go back and watch the benchmark Walt Disney production from 1951, which I saw -or assumed I saw- as a child. It was a chance to get reacquainted with the many varied characters from the story as sort of a warm up for the Burton film. Upon viewing the Disney classic I was astonished to realize that I had likely never seen more than a few clips (at most) of that beautifully rendered Alice in Wonderland. So much seemed brand new. Nor did I have a memory of ever seeing any other ""Alice"" production. Then I realized that I had never read the book! Wait a minute. Where then did my memory of the Alice story come from? The curiosity sparked by that question ultimately led me over the next two years to accumulate every version of Alice in Wonderland still in existence. Well over 40 by the way!

This general commentary continues over in the review sections for both the 1951 AIW production from Walt Disney (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland-Masterpiece-Edition/dp/B0000TG9E2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland (Masterpiece Edition)</a>) and the 2010 production starring Johnny Depp (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland/dp/B001HN694K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland</a>). As these are the two most well known Alice's, rather then attempt to add yet-another-review for those two films, it seemed like it might be a more fun use of the provided space to muse a bit on the popularity and remarkable longevity of the story spawned by Lewis Carroll in 1865, as well as to share with you a bit of what I picked up while watching these 40 or so renderings of Alice in Wonderland. All other Alice productions listed by Amazon have a specific review for that title.

REVIEW OF THIS 2010 VERSION...
This is a very kid friendly telling of the Alice in Wonderland story that adults will love as well. It is unique ensemble piece in that the producers got their hands on a copy of a 1948 broadcast of the ""Alice"" story told over radio, and then hand crafted some very distinctive animation footage to accompany the audio.

First, to describe the audio portion, the character of Alice was voiced by a thirty-two year old Dinah Shore, a very popular singer and actress of the time whose career spanned radio, movies and TV. She had been doing radio for a decade when they broadcast this special, so her clear and bright voice was very recognizable to the listening audience. It's a pleasure to hear her talk and sing her way through this rendition of Alice in Wonderland.

The animation is something you've likely never seen before. An artist listened to the 1948 tape, envisioned the characters in her head, and then hand drew them. The drawings were then transferred to computer where a digital animator brought the drawings to life. The result was this funky, silly, very creative two-dimensional rendering of the characters and the background. Every time you see Alice move and talk you almost can't help but giggle.

The 1948 broadcast had stuck pretty well to the actual Lewis Carroll story. The Father William story was included, and of course Dinah sang the poem, as well as a few others. Another notable voice on the recording is none other than the man who voiced Elmer Fudd in the Bugs Bunny cartoons. I won't tell you which character he voiced in this production as anyone who knows Elmer Fudd will easily pick it out. ;>

There are many tellings of the Alice story suitable for children (of course). This one is high on my list because not only will kids love it, it's tolerable by parents. And since the recording was made without video originally, the audio portion could be played alone to keep the little ones entertained in restricted venues.
