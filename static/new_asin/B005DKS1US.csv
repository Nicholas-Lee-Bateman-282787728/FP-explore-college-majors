4660795,5,B005DKS1US,"I just picked this up this week the picture and sound quality are excellent for an 80s show It's nice to view these without watermarks. The song goodness makes the badness go away is really a song that gets stuck in your head, but it is cute. Ti's the season to be Smurfy, Sassette and Grandpa help out a poor elderly couple celebrate Christmas. This makes a nice addition to any Christmas collection Smurfy Fun For The whole Family!
One Mistake on the back cover it says Tis the season to be Smurfy is first but the DVD menu screen it says The smurfs Christmas Special is first and Tis the season to be Smurfy is second.",1317945600,3,621,4.316239316239316

4660815,5,B005DKS1US,"Heaven knows why, but The Smurfs' Christmas Special from 1982, and 'Tis The Season to be Smurfy from 1987, are the only Christmas specials on this Smurfy DVD. The other 2 original Christmas specials, Baby's First Christmas from 1983, and its follow-up The Magic Sack of Mr. Nicholas from 1987, remain unavailable on authorized DVDs, as with most of the whole series. Oh well, like with the Flintstones' Christmas specials, half of their specials on DVD is better than none. The Smurfs' Christmas Special is about a certain devilish stranger wanting revenge on William and Gwenevere's uncle after their grandpa's sleigh tipped over; as the kids were found by the Smurfs, they mistake Papa for Santa himself, due to his similarities to Mr. Nicholas himself. Luckily, their uncle and his search party found their grandpa before the stranger could ever cook their geese. It won't be such a merry Christmas when Gargamel and Azrael get their just desserts from an even worse bad guy, unless the Smurfs' song in their hearts intervene. In 'Tis The Season to be Smurfy, Grandpa Smurf shows Sassette what Christmas is like for people, including a poor old couple who really deserve a merry Christmas with all the help they can get, thanks to the rest of the Smurfs coming to their senses from being too busy with their own Christmas chores. As with many other Hanna-Barbera Christmas classics, my family's been complaining about these not being on DVD, until 2011 when half of their original Christmas specials came to DVD with this collection. The other half still ain't on DVD if you're wondering about this one's contents. There's also Sony's Smurfs' Christmas Carol from 2011, sold separately, if you're interested in it, since surviving creators of the series helped bring that special's 2D animation to life, like with Smurfy Hollow in 2013. For once, having a Blue Christmas is a good thing, with the Smurfs' Christmas specials on DVD, even if 3 out of 5 isn't bad!",1418774400,,1964,4.900900900900901

4660828,3,B005DKS1US,"First of all, this is ""The Smurfs,"" one of the most maligned '80s-era cartoons ever (deservedly so). Some people blamed this show for ruining Saturday morning cartoons, although I don't believe that that is entirely fair.

So what I'm saying is, don't expect high art.

There are two different Christmas specials included; the older, ""The Smurfs Christmas Special,"" is pretty painful and formulaic. Remember how for more than five years, every episode of the show featured Gargamel's trying to kill Smurfs for no good reason? Yeah, that's what this is, except some guy even more evil (and less bumbling) labeled ""the Stranger"" inexplicably arrives on the scene armed with a magic scroll that not only can tell Gargamel where the Smurf village is, but also how to kill the little blue Shirtless Ones. Luckily we have an ample dose of God in the Machine here to get the horrible scriptwriters out of the corner that they put themselves into.

The second and much better special is the later ""'Tis the Season to Be Smurfy,"" in which the Smurfs decide to help out an older struggling couple on Christmas Eve. There actually are some pretty interesting animation techniques used in this one, and the plot doesn't seem like it was written by a third grader.

No DVD extras here.

I suppose that if you were a fan of ""The Smurfs"" growing up (I always hated it), you'd definitely want to buy this. Anybody else probably can pass on it and not be missing out.",1356307200,,1450,4.715415019762846
4660829,4,B005DKS1US,"The Smurfs Holiday Celebration may be a little pricey for only two episodes, but I'm a Smurf fan so I went ahead and bought the DVD last year.

'Tis the Season to be Smurfy originally aired on December 13, 1987 and The Smurfs Christmas Special aired on December 12, 1982. Both episodes are fun to watch and brings me back to my childhood days.",1347926400,6,343,4.359375

It is so silly, but adorable.  Just like every other Smurftastic episode!",1323561600,,250,4.391304347826087
4660838,3,B005DKS1US,"At one point or another, most all family friendly television programs air some sort of holiday special. Just one special you say? Well smurf that! How about two?! Taken from their TV show, that ran for nine seasons, we are offered two Christmas (not Holiday) specials starring those tiny blue...whatever they are. The animation quality signifies that one special comes from the earliest seasons, while the other come from somewhere later in the nine year run.

The simply titled The Smurfs Christmas Special is the older offering. It is a tale of two lost children whom the Smurfs attempt to save from a mysterious, magical stranger. Meanwhile, Gargamel uses a spell from this same stranger to try and destroy the Smurf village once and for all. The tale is simple and once again, love is used to conquer all (expressed in song).

The second episode on this DVD, 'Tis the Season to be Smurfy features a little more madcap hijinx as a couple of pursuits break out while some of the Smurfs try to learn the true meaning of Christmas (now there's an original theme for you) after befriending an elderly couple. Of course, the Smurfs burst into song frequently to raise spirits.

In both films the Smurfs are mistaken for elves, and in one case Papa Smurf is thought to be Santa Claus. This helps to make their adventures have a more Christmas feel. Otherwise, these would just be regular episodes of the Smurfs, in snow.

4660839,4,B005DKS1US,"You could say that the little blue denizens of Smurf village might be Santa's little helpers.  Well, they are helpful in some way or other.  Smurf up your holiday season with the ""Smurfs Holiday Celebration"" DVD.  In it are two Christmas episodes as seen on Cartoon Network.

""The Smurfs Christmas Special"" has our little friends help two lost children find their family.  But alas, the wicked wizard Gargamel kidnaps the children for his own misdeeds like making a deal to another evil wizard, but in due time, the Smurfs triumph.

In ""'Tis the Season to be Smurfy"", the Smurfs are busy on yet another Christmas celebration.  In fact, they're so busy, they didn't realize that an elderly couple in a human village are in need of some Christmas cheer.  So the Smurfs decide to brighten the couple's season by lending a few hands.

Seems to me that the first special is from the second season whereas the second special jumps ahead to the sixth or seventh season.  Either way, it's a must have for any Smurfs or holiday collection.  There's even supposed to be a Smurf version of ""A Christmas Carol"" on the Smurfs movie DVD and Blu-ray set.  Just in time, too.",1322611200,,1159,4.655172413793103
4660840,4,B005DKS1US,"Given how Grinchy Warner Bros has become in regards to releasing volume sets of the Smurfs cartoon show beyond Season 1, it's fortunate that they are even bothering to give the Christmas specials any attention. Not that I think they are the best of the specials, mind you, but at least it's something to watch and they're somewhat enjoyable. Now they need to get off their smurfs and start really showing the love that this long-running cartoon show of the 1980s deserves.",1320537600,,472,4.7682926829268295

4660842,4,B005DKS1US,"I ordered The Smurf's Holiday Celebration DVD to watch this Christmas season with my grandchildren and decided to watch it first.  It is 48 minutes long and contains two stories;  ""The Smurfs' Christmas Special"" and ""Tis the Season to be Smurfy.""  My daughter used to love the Smurfs when she was growing up, so now her children can enjoy them as well.

""The Smurf's Christmas Special"" finds the Smurfs busy preparing for Christmas, decorating their village and making Great Pudding, while Gargamel, as always, is busy thinking of ways to destroy the little blue folks.  Along comes a horse and sleigh carrying two children and their grandfather.  Their sleigh overturns, and the story's focus turns to the two lost children seeking help.  The Smurfs find the frightened children and take them to their village where they share with them their presents, pudding, and songs.  The children think Papa Smurf is Santa Claus.  Gargamel teams up with an evil stranger to kidnap the children, but evil is thwarted when the Smurfs repeatedly sing the song ""Goodness makes the badness go away.""  There is, of course, a happy ending.

The evil stranger, the kidnapping of the children, and a circle of fire that they are trapped in may be a bit scary for very young children, but I would say this show would be fine for ages 5 and up.  For younger children, a parent might want to watch it with them to answer any questions about what is taking place.

In the second movie, ""Tis the Season to be Smurfy"", the Smurfs are again busy decorating their village for Christmas.  Grandpa Smurf takes Sassette to the human village  to see how they celebrate Christmas Eve, and they discover that not all humans are as ""smurfy"" as they should be, meaning some of them are bad.  They discover an elderly puppet maker who has an ailing wife, and she has a wish of seeing Christmas elves.  Grandpa Smurf and Sassette decide to find a way to make their Christmas Eve smurfier, but they have a hard time convincing the other Smurfs to take the time to help.  Papa Smurf shows up to remind all the Smurfs that they shouldn't be so busy with their own holiday preparations that they fail to see that there are people who have greater needs.  And so the entire Smurf clan trudges their way through a snow storm to bring Christmas cheer to the old couple.  An evil thief causes a mixup that almost gets the old couple arrested, but the thief is convinced by the Smurfs that giving is better than taking.

Again, I would suggest this movie for ages 5 and up unless you watch it with them.  The story line is a little too fast paced and complicated for children younger than that.  Both movies share the values of helping those in need, sharing what you have with others, and caring for those less fortunate.",1318464000,23,2777,4.610997963340123
