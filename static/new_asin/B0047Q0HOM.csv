8418280,3,B0047Q0HOM,"I had most recently purchased this DVD as a belated birthday gift for a young male friend of mine, who's had quite A LOT of trouble satisfying women in the bedroom!! Anyway, he's ALWAYS been aroused by reading lesbian erotica, as well as seeing his fave lesbian romantic films (one of them is ""Claire of the Moon""). He's quite confident that he'll SCORE BIG if he can sexually satisfy a woman the way a lesbian can-if he just takes his time and not go too fast-LOL!! So I gave him this video in order to learn step-by-step on how to sensually please a woman by understanding her body-and her senses. Well, after having just seen it once by listening carefully to the sex therapist's voiceover, he was greatly disappointed, mainly because the video itself is simply a montage of 1990's lesbian porno, with a (repetitive) outdated smooth jazz soundtrack (he just CANNOT STAND smooth jazz, btw). But what REALLY irked him was that he could not hear the erotic sounds of lesbian lovemaking, simply because they were DROWNED OUT by the instructional voiceover. Yet the only thing he enjoyed about this video were the excerpts of the legendary Sappho's poetry having appeared and read over *beautifully* by the female voiceover (prior to the erotic love scenes). Anyway, it really disheartened me that he was, overall, very dissatisfied with this DVD. Yet in order to compensate for his disappointment and dissatisfaction, I just decided to print out several online lesbian erotica short stories from various sites, which made him VERY HAPPY!! And since I cannot return this DVD on Amazon, I'll just give it to my other male friend, who simply doesn't give a hoot if this is an instructional lesbian sex video-he just LOVES to see several different scenes of two hot and horny women get it on!!",1484956800,,1788,4.808441558441558
