8481613,5,B00004YZFZ,"Larry Anderson's relaxed manner and excellent video shots clearly instruct the application of 11 great ""Jaw-Dropping"" routines you can do with just a little preparation. Most of the principles can be applied to a variety of routines you can develop and adapt to your own personality and situation.

The basic approach in the video is to show the jaw-dropper in action followed by a very careful and detailed explanation and a re-do of the illusion. Beginners and more advanced magicians will find lots to work from on this tape.",1165968000,,528,4.932584269662922
