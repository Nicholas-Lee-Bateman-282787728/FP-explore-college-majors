5101899,5,B007OXB1J0,I am so glad I found this DVD for my shoulder problem.  I was surfing the web in the middle of the night because I couldn't sleep because of my shoulder pain and I saw the You Tube clip for it. I just received the DVD last Saturday and have been doing the exercises with it two times a day since. It only takes 20 minutes and it is so worth it!  My shoulder is so much better now.  Now I'm going to order his other DVD regarding the lower back.  These exercises are so simple and work so much better then the ones I received from physical therapy.  Thank you David Wicker!,1338854400,5,572,4.0265486725663715

8519968,5,B007OXB1J0,"After 3 months, This has done wonders for my shoulder, I was in such pain, I finally had an X-Ray and got a referral for therapy.
I have been to therapy 2 x and I still prefer the video. Since I am 60,  I will continue to use it, everyday, for a Healthy Shoulder & Rotator Cuff .  I think the amount of time on the video is enough, especially after I have healed and what to incorporate it with other workouts.",1452556800,3,410,3.9878048780487805

8519973,5,B007OXB1J0,"I've had shoulder problems for nearly 10 years.  I have been using this video for only a few weeks and recently noticed that I am not having as much shoulder pain.  I've tried just about everything, but this actually seems to be working.",1367107200,2,237,4.488372093023256
8519974,2,B007OXB1J0,"Excellent exercises, what there are of them.  The video is very short and only includes a minimal number of exercises.  I wish there were a few more because the ones on the video are very effective.  For the price, I expected more variety.",1361145600,5,239,4.511627906976744
8519975,2,B007OXB1J0,"It has some effective stretches, but right when you think you're getting the hang of it, the video ends in less than 30 minutes!!! And the worst part is that the actual video content is only about 15 minutes. The guy repeats the same stretches on one shoulder and then the next. I paid almost $40 for this DVD and I am a bit disapointed now.",1350604800,10,341,4.181818181818182
8519976,5,B007OXB1J0,"I have been suffering from shoulder bursitis and tendonitis for about twelve months and have had tried acupuncture, massage, physio, anti-inflammatory tablets and also herbal remedies with no relief at all.

I bought this DVD about a month ago and have been doing the exercises twice a day for the first two weeks and now once a day and the results are amazing.  I can now move my shoulder in all directions without pain and I don't have that constant aching all day.

This DVD is well worth the money and is one of the best things I have ever bought.",1344384000,4,551,4.435643564356436
