8557273,1,B002JVX0HI,"If you are looking for practices or exercises to learn how to raise your own kundalini energy then this video is not for you. Basically this video is an interview of an energy healer, about how he got interested in energy healing and stories of how he has healed people. I wish they would have put a trailer or something of the video to give you an idea of what the video is about...instead of a small vague description. The description they had was rather misleading in making you think this is a self-help video when it really isn't. I wish I could get my $8 back.",1345852800,,566,4.299065420560748
8557274,2,B002JVX0HI,The shipping was great. The video however wasn't all that exciting. It's more or less an interview. I don't feel that I learned a lot from it. But maybe it's just me. I would have troubles recommending this to others.,1265155200,3,217,4.45
