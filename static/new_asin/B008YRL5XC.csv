5191386,4,B008YRL5XC,"When it comes to video games that feature samurai's and a general taking on hoards of enemies, in the US, ""Samurai Warriors"" (similar to Dynasty Warriors) from KOEI is well-known. But in Japan, CAPCOM began their own series known as ""Sengoku Basara"" (Devil Kings) which takes place during the Sengoku period and a similar concept as their rivals and has also earned its strong fan following.

In 2005, the first game was released for the Sony Playstation 2 and was released in the U.S. (as ""Devil Kings"") but unfortunately, CAPCOM tried to change the whole story of the Sengoku period by trying to connect it to their ""Devil May Cry"" series in order to attract players but because of the changes and the localization crew feeling they needed to make it more difficult in America, needless to say, it was a failure. People wanted the same game that was in Japan and within the last six years, there have been four video game releases and now CAPCOM has released ""Sengoku Basara: Samurai Heroes"" for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable and the Nintendo Wii in the US in October 2010.

In Japan, two seasons of ""Sengoku Basara: Samurai Kings"" aired. And in 2010, to coincide with this videogame release, FUNimation Entertainment released the first season of the anime series ""Sengoku Basara: Samurai Kings"" on Blu-ray and DVD (including the first 12 TV episodes + Blu-ray/DVD only 13th episode).

On Feb. 2012, with the release of the second season on Blu-ray and DVD, FUNimation Entertainment will be re-releasing the first season of ""Sengoku Basara: Samurai Kings"" via a Blu-ray+DVD Combo Pack.

What is ""Sengoku Basara: The Last Party"" about?

The anime series is produced by Production I.G. and is directed by Itsuro Kawasaki (""Arc the Lad"", ""Rental Magica"", ""Yumedamaya Kidan""), screenplay by Yasuyuki Muto (""Afro Samurai: Resurrection"", ""Basilisk"", ""Mobil Suit Gundam UC""), character designs by Tooru Ookubo, art direction by Shunichiro Yoshihara (""Gurren Lagann"", ""Cromartie High School"", ""Slayers"") and music by Hiroyuki Sawano (""Soul Link"", ""Mobil Suit Gundam UC"").

The anime series takes place during the Sengoku Period. Various generals and their warriors are fighting each other. For the Takeda clan led by Lord Takeda Shingen, his young hot-headed warrior Sanada Yukimura has a rivalry with the cocky warlord Date Masamune. Both are hot-headed that they fight against each other but they also value their battles with one another because they are equally matched.

As the two occasionally battle one another, all warring clans are worried about Oda Nobunaga, the devil king. The ruthless king who wants to destroy everything in his path and his followers Akechi Mitsuhide, a sadistic psychopath and the weapons master Nohime (Nobunaga's wife) intend to carryout his wishes by killing the leaders of the various clans.

The only way to stop Nobunaga is for each of the warring generals to work and team up together in order to stop him. But can these warriors all work together or will their ego and pride get in the way?

In the second season of ""Sengoku Basara"", And as the two sides begin to fight again, they are interrupted by the soldiers of Toyotomi Hideyoshi.  Toyotomi wants to unite Japan and make the country stronger but as each warrior supports their own clan and leader, he warns everyone that if they oppose him, they will be face his wrath.

Quickly, clans who try to take on Toyotomi Hideyoshi and his soldiers are quickly met with defeat.  He is too powerful and for Masamune, Shingen and Kenshin, they stand no chance against him.

But as each clan tries to find a way to defeat Hideyoshi, Maeda Kanji who knows Toyotomi very well, tries to get his friends Maeda Toshiie and Matsu to stop Toyotomi's tirade against the other clans, but he finds out that even his friends have aligned with Toyotomi.

Meanwhile, the other clans begin to visit others with the hope of rival clans joining forces to fight against Toyotomi Hideyoshi and his army.

And now, here we are with the conclusion to ""Sengoku Basara"" with ""The Last Party"".

Ishida Mitsunari, who worked as a minion of Toyotomi Hideyoshi is now carrying a major grudge against Date Masamune for killing his master.  With Tokugawa now choosing a different path for unity, Date Masamune knows that he must prepare for the final battle against Ishida, but unknown to everyone in the land, a new evil force is looming in the land and a former enemy has been resurrected!

VIDEO:

""Sengoku Basara: The Last Party"" is presented in 1080p High Definition and like most Production I.G. releases, they always provide excellent artistic backgrounds for their series and the same goes for the film.  Mountains, rocks, trees, skies are very well painted and the animation is also nice and fluid. It's important to note that this is a film and not a TV series, so characters are better shaded, art backgrounds are better detailed and really good of CG elements in the film.

Colors are absolutely vibrant and bold. Also, very good lighting effects throughout the film. Personally, I expected nothing less from Production I.G., the series definitely looks absolutely awesome on Blu-ray! Also, I detected no banding, artifacting or anything negative about the picture quality for ""Sengoku Basara: The Last Party"".

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Sengoku Basara: The Last Party"" is presented in lossless English and Japanese 5.1 Dolby TrueHD.  Personally, I enjoyed the Japanese soundtrack because the generals sound much more menacing while I felt the English dub, as good as it is, sometimes I feel certain voice talent are overly used and they sound the same for no matter what characters they play.

Personally, I enjoyed the Japanese soundtrack because the generals sound much more menacing while I felt the English dub, as good as it is, sometimes I feel certain voice talent are overly used and they sound the same for no matter what characters they play. In the first season, I mentioned that although I enjoy Johnny Yong Bosch's acting work when it comes to ""Bleach"", but his Yukimura (Sengoku Basara) sounds like an annoying version of Ichigo (Bleach). But with that being said, the English dub has grown on me and felt the FUNimation English dub actors did a fine job.

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""SSengoku Basara: The Last Party"" contains the following special features:

  Four Panel Theater: Another Last Party - (7:48) Still panel theater featuring chibi versions of the characters.
  Making of The Last Party - (49:27) A very cool featurette about the popularity of ""Sengoku Basara"" and what was involved in the making of ""Sengoku Basara: The Last Party"".
  Textless Opening and Closing Song - Featuring T.M. Revolution's ""FLAGS"" and ""The Party Must Go On"".
  Trailer and Commercial Collection - (8:58) The Japanese film and television commercials for ""Sengoku Basara: The Last Party"".

JUDGMENT CALL:

There is no doubt that in Japan, ""Sengoku Basara"" has a pretty strong fan following from its video games and anime series, especially among the cosplayers who are often seen doing group cosplay of the characters from the series.

For ""Sengoku Basara"", it's a popular video game series that has tried to make these warring clans (that happen to live in the same time period) and generals with amazing abilities take on each other.  And with the first two seasons of the anime series and also with this final film, what people enjoy is the humor and the action involved.

With ""Sengoku Basara: The Last Party"", the series and the video games have always focused on Masamune Date, Yukimura Sanada, Mitsunari Ishida and Tokogawa Ieyasu and the final film ends with these primary characters as they must join forces in taking on the latest evil to cause chaos in the land.

Like the television series before it, there is a new threat and the four must put away their egos in order to join forces and work for the greater good.  But the question is can they.  With Mitsunari wanting revenge on Masamune for killing Hideyoshi Toyotomi.  And of course, there is Yukimura always wanting to see who is more powerful, he or Masamune and both wanting to get into a duel with each other.  And this time, Tokogawa Ieyasu is the peace keeper trying to achieve unity.

And as much as ""Sengoku Basara: The Last Party"" may seem like the final, I really have a hard time believing that.  This series will continue in video games, as it was recently continuing via live action drama in Japan (""Sengoku Basara: Moonlight Party"") and I'm sure we will see more of these guys in some new anime series, OVA or film in the near future.

As for the Blu-ray release, one of the positive aspects of ""Sengoku Basara: The Last Party"" is that it's a film, so that means better animation and better detailed backgrounds coming from Production I.G.  Also, no more 2.0 lossless soundtrack in Japanese, this time around both English and Japanese soundtracks are presented in Dolby TrueHD5.1.  And as for special features, I'm quite happy that a making of feature showing the making of the film but also the popularity of the series has been in Japanese pop culture.

For those who have already committed themselves to watching the first two seasons of ""Sengoku Basara"" will definitely want to watch the film.  I don't recommend watching the film first, as you want to know the context of the characters, their rivalries and respective clans.  But for those who have no time to watch the TV series, fortunately there is an opening introduction explaining what had taken place from those two seasons before the movie.

Overall, ""Sengoku Basara: The Last Party"" is an action-packed, samurai fighting storyline that continues where the first two seasons have left off.  For fans of the video game and anime series, ""Sengoku Basara: The Last Party"" is recommended!",1354320000,,9821,4.932563791008506
5191387,4,B008YRL5XC,It arrived on time. But the only problem was that the box the DVDS are in was damaged. other than that everything else was ok.,1352851200,2,126,4.08
5191388,5,B008YRL5XC,If your into samurais and the endo period then you will love this anmie the action is stunning. I recommend you watch the series first to get a better understanding of this movie it is worth it,1400889600,,193,4.243243243243243
5191389,4,B008YRL5XC,"Ok, I am not a diehard anime genre fan, but I enjoy it. This selection was my daughter's pick.

Not knowing a thing about the series, she invited me to watch this movie with her one night, and I did rather reluctantly.

I watched, and I paid attention. It was interesting. I didn't hate it. I could probably watch it again. I could not possibly regurgitate to anyone what it was about only seeing it once. Sorry. (Ask me after I view it a second time, then, perhaps...)

I watch this movie through to the end and could not help but to sit with my jaw gaping open and my eyes fixed in a perplexed stare as the credits begin to roll by....accompanied by what my daughter has informed me is kind of a ""niche"" thing for this series...a totally choreographed full on animated dance sequence...

Unexpected? Yes. I watched with the same curiosity and hidden horror as one does when there's police or EMT activity in their neighborhood.

If you're a fan of the series, by all means, give it a go. If you're not, but know someone who is, buy it for them so you can skip to the end credits and watch these characters bust dance moves that will make you question your own skills....",1394668800,,1172,4.3577981651376145
5191390,5,B008YRL5XC,Such an awesome series so the movie is a must buy! Seriously the movie is beautiful with such great actors and all the voice actors did such a great job! Definitely a must buy!,1393545600,,176,4.205882352941177
5191391,5,B008YRL5XC,"First time watching this! First time being introduced to Sengoku! I have been seeing the trailers of the show on the other animes I watched so decided to rent it to check it out and I don't regret it, other than the fact that I rented it instead of bought it! It was that good, it is very easy to follow since they recap events that took place before the movie. Then the movie starts with action, doesnt get dragged out and gets to the point, and leads all up to an exciting brawl! Great for people who like anime for action, such as Dragon Ball Z, and for people who like samurai animes such as samurai champloo. either or I love it and will look into watching the entire series which they sell on amazon for around 40 bucks, and i will be looking forward to purchasing this movie as well. That guy with the white/gray hair, Ishida, was off the hook!!! EPIC!",1391472000,2,859,4.2439024390243905

5191394,5,B008YRL5XC,"I become a fan of the series when I found samurai heroes in the used game bin. when I heard about the anime I had to get it. With this I've completed my collection. The action scenes are great and the story was good and the film ends as it should since you can choose the character you play as.

I just wished they had dub the extra 4 panel theater.",1360281600,3,349,3.915492957746479

5191396,5,B008YRL5XC,"This was really a anime TREAT! This should be a standard for all anime movies. From the plot down to ever last detail, this was a good movie from beginning to end. It makes you love the characters  more as the  game it comes from. PLUS EXTRA'S ON OVERLOAD! It's  rare you get to see how it's  made from A TO Z , storyboard. to lines ,to video,music, and all. Usually you get to see the voice actors or hear the voice actors through commentary or other . BUT this take the cake! You get to see them in action, in the booth, and what it really TAKES TO PUT IT TOGETHER. Perfect addition to any anime collector.  NOT A SINGLE THING  disappointing at all.",1357862400,,651,4.168
5191397,4,B008YRL5XC,"The animation quality is great, but not much better then the anime series so when you're watching this movie it may feel like you're watching an extended anime episode.
