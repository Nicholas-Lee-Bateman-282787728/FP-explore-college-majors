2679079,5,B000JU7JE6,"In my opinion, this is the most fair and balanced description of the amazing event told from both the view of our white and American Indian brothers and sisters. America owes a great debt of gratitude to the American Indian. This program which accuratly tells the story of the Mayflower shows not only where America wrong, but also where they went right, when it came to the treatment for our American Indian brothers and sisters.",1202428800,2,430,4.746666666666667
2679080,5,B000JU7JE6,"I saw this advertised on TV, then bought it for our elementary school library.  This is an excellent video,  with accuracy in both script and physical setting. Being of Native American heritage, I appreciate the portrayal of their roll in assisting the very survival of the Pilgrims.  I highly recommend this for home schools, elementary schools, or to own personally!",1197849600,4,368,5.1
2679081,5,B000JU7JE6,"Everyone needs to see this. Schools in America have intentionally told lies about this story. Yes, they left England because of persecution...but that's NOT why they came here! They had their freedom in Holland, but it was, and still is, a decadent society. They wanted something better and they wanted to spread the Gospel. That's the truth and public schools can't handle it so they lie!",1189296000,7,389,4.909090909090909
2679082,5,B000JU7JE6,"I felt cheated - went to school in a town where a significant percentage of graduating seniors attend Ivy League colleges - in other words, not a school system that is light on educational effort...but I never heard even 1/2 of this information about the Pilgrims!  If this sort of information (and its excellent presentation) had been available when I was in grade school, I would have been much more interested and engaged US history and in history in general.",1185148800,25,462,4.775
2679083,5,B000JU7JE6,This was a great program for understanding the difficulties encountered in the early founding of our country.  I was really astonished at how dangerous it was to be able to leave England and get to America.  This show is very interesting and captivates your interest throughout.,1175472000,7,278,5.021739130434782
2679084,5,B000JU7JE6,"This History Channel presentation of the pilgrims is two and a half hours of a well-known and very important part of our American history, although you may not realize how little you actually do know of these separatists and of the times they lived. In fact, it certainly is more movie than documentary and, although interspersed throughout are historians filling in the gaps, this docu-drama is as engulfing and riveting as any full-length period movie I have seen. The lives and times of these early European settlers are authentically portrayed by use of English Shakespearian actors, and the quality shows. Never have I seen any other film put flesh on the bones of the pilgrims to the extent this one does. A social history extravaganza!
The clothing, lighting, effects (especially while on the Mayflower), and, at times, even some of the speech patterns are reflected fairly accurately. I did not see the typical revisionist history so often reflected in many of today's historical depictions. They were very religious folk bent on keeping their practices, even if they had to cross the ocean to do it, and this movie shows that in no uncertain terms.
The Indian dramatization was done very well for the most part, although I would have preferred to have their speech in their original (or close to their original) language and include the use of sub-titles.
Oh well, can't have everything.
As an extra added bonus, by the way, there are a couple of short (too short!) extra's - one features the making of this extraordinary documentary, and the other has outtakes and bloopers.
For teachers and lovers of history I recommend this docu-drama very highly. A wonderful way to learn about our early American history.",1170720000,257,1719,4.951557093425605
2679085,4,B000JU7JE6,"Most Americans know the story of the Pilgrims and Mayflower...or do they?  The History Channel has done a great job here, showing us that there is more to the story than we'd been taught.  For example, who knew that many of the Pilgrims had actually moved to the Netherlands for an extended period (12 years or so) before deciding to try their luck in the New World?  Or that there were actually two ships (the other being called The Speedwell), but the 2nd one was left behind because it was deemed un-seaworthy?  Or that the Pilgrims landed first, not at Plymouth, but on Cape Cod, only to be driven off by the Native Americans there?  These facts and many others are revealed in this interesting film.

Four stars.  A bit long (almost 140 minutes) but I found it worth the time!",1165968000,93,781,4.49645390070922
2679086,5,B000JU7JE6,"Excellent.  Well Done.  Even the Native American portrayal is very, very good.  Only a few tiny details with the Native Clothing of the time is a bit off.

Too bad it was not ready before the holiday - most American Teachers really needed this so they can stop doing stupid Pilgrim/Indian Paegents and Plays.  Hopefully many will use this in the future and correct the miss-information about the Mayflower and more.

As for the previous review: why do so many diss-pell how many Native Americans were here before and right at White Contact?  They just can't give us any credit for anything - indcluding just being here in vast numbers.  A Native population of 50,000,000 is not hard to believe when we know that the Aztec Empire alone was in the millions.  It seems as though people keep forgetting how freaking big North America is as a continent.  Really think about it and 50,000,000 people is not that much for a Continent the size of North America!  Give us a break and give us the respect we so richly deserve.",1164412800,17,1016,4.588888888888889
2679087,5,B000JU7JE6,"It will be worth the dvd coming out the end of January. Shown now as Thanksgiving day fare. It is really an untold story. That is, the story of the struggles of the Separatist (Pilgims) in the 13 years before the Mayflower ever sailed. That was 1607, the year the first sucessful permanent colony was established in Virginia, named after King James. England was Protestant & The Anglican Church of England was the only lawful religion. James seemed to be quite pious in that regard. Not to the Separatist, who were loyal to the king in every way except religious. They printed tracts & even accused the King of popishness. This angered him & he harassed them until they left England for Holland. There they were tolerated but somewhat isolated & empoverished. This could not be a permanent solution & they decided that America might be option to consider. They needed a charter from King James who was basically angry with them but readily agree. He did not like them in Holland & in America they would be far away & out of his hair. Obtaining a ship, crew & provisions for the long trip was not cheap. Eventually they had to take non-believers with them who had money & for various reasons also wanted to leave. They had several fitful starts & even had to turn back several times. Finally they left England in late summer of 1620, a bad time to leave & even worse to land for it got them to America with winter bearing down & no chance to plant crops. They never got to Virginia. Instead they landed in Massachuetts Bay, outside of the area of their charter from the king. The weather prevented them from sailing out & around Cape Cod & south to Viginia. So there they stayed. Technically, they were no longer ruled by English law & the non-believers aboard knew this. They were not going to be governed by the rules that the separatist proposed once they landed. Both groups were of about equal size & what came about was the first great document in our history, The Mayflower Compact. Essentially a consensus document setting up a government with laws that all groups could live with. Quite remarkable. This document saved their lives. If they had split they surely would have perished. As it was, half the people died that winter. They pulled together & made it. These events were recorded for posterity by one of the original Pilgrims, William Bradford, who was there & later would become Govenor of the colony until shortly before his death in 1657. The reenactments for this documentary were quite well done. They choose a permenant site but not before fleeing & fighting some Native American tribes for stealing their seed corn & making friends with another tribe. A claim that there were over 50,000,000 people in  North America at this time is hard to believe. But if true the number that died from disease & at the hands of Europeans over the next 250 years is truly a disaster eclipsing other examples of mass extinctions in history. By fall 1621 there was enough bounty to have a festival. According to this telling, the natives just dropped in bringing wild turkeys & both groups partied together for three days & nights. They ate all of the Pilgrims food. Later, they brought in supplies of venision, a high prestige gift of respect. The Pilgims were expected to do the same, that is drop in any time uninvited to eat & stay overnight. This version did not mention a story I had heard. The Pligims landed where they did because they were in a hurry to set up a brewery, having run through the ship's supply of beer. One thing that is important to point out is the Pilgrims did not come to America to practice religious freedom. They came to America for the freedom to practice their religion.",1164326400,85,3708,4.601208459214502

I thought some of the Native American spokespeople still hadn't gotten over the ""invasion"".  They seemed somewhat put out with we European folk even though 400 years have passed.

2679135,1,B000JU7JE6,"This documentary is excellently done. I give it a five for it's choreograph. Or at least a four. But only give it a one because it is revisionist history suiting the liberal agenda. The writers and historians who put this together do not want you to know the truth. Just like they don't want you to know the truth how Christianity played an important part in the founding of our country. They don't want you to know the truth about the Democrat Party or how the Republican Party was formed. These people can't tell the truth when the truth fits better.

Much of what is indicated in the documentary is true but what does it tell you about the authors when you find out what is missing. They hate Christianity and Free Enterprise and want to pump their collective mind set into our culture. And just so you know, the greatest haters of Christianity and Free Enterprise are Communists. And they must over come it to push their collective agenda.

What's missing?

1. They did mention Luther and his quest against the State managed Catholic Church. But left out one of the main reasons King James was against these people. They were using the Geneva Bible which he hated. The reason he hated it was because it did not favor Divine Right to Rule by Kings. The Geneva Bible was the first Bible printed in English and given to the common people of Europe and England. Only the clergy and ruling class had Bibles up till then. It also was the first study Bible printed in English with Chapters and Verses. King James so despised the Geneva Bible he outlawed it (1610) after he had the King James version created. The Geneva Bible was about personal responsibility and Christ was King, not the church or some human king. The Geneva Bible is partially responsible for our freedom in the United States. It has a great history as the people who translated it from ancient writings were persecuted, fled England for their lives. The originator was strangled to death in prison for giving the world the first Bible that the masses could read.

2. What built our nation was the engine of Free Enterprise not Plato's collectivism. They left out the first raw experiment with unbridled by government Free Enterprise in the new world which affected our culture as much as the Geneva Bible. The Mayflower Compact was a socialist document and by Bradford's own words it did not work. I wonder how our economy would be if the government got out of the way of ""We The People""?

3. In one of the other posts, revisionist history is mentioned and one of the comments says that there was no basis for the comment because proof was not put forward. Below you will find quotes from William Bradford writings that prove what actually occurred but was not in the documentary because the last thing those historians want is for you to know the truth about your heritage because of their collectivism mind set that they wish to push on you.

4. The most Thanksgiving was because of Free Enterprise.

5. This documentary is another hate America story.

Thanksgiving Story: The Pilgrims, Socialism, and Free Enterprise!

The story of the Mayflower, the Pilgrims, and Thanksgiving is widely taught in all our schools.  What is seldom taught, however, is what those Pilgrims learned, at great pain, about Free Enterprise versus Socialism. That story stands as perhaps the clearest and starkest-ever comparison between those two rival systems for human interaction.

We all know how the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock in November, 1620, and how they lost half their population to starvation, sickness, and exposure that first winter. We all know how a Native American named Squanto taught the survivors to fish, plant corn, use fertilizer, and hunt deer. And we know that following their first harvest, Governor William Bradford declared a day of Thanksgiving that we celebrate to this day.

What most of us never learned was that the original contract the Pilgrims brokered with their London sponsors required that everything the Pilgrims produced was to go into a common store, and every member was to be allotted one equal share.  Further, all the land they cleared and all the buildings they constructed were to belong the whole community.

It must have sounded like the ideal society.  Free of outside evil influences, greed and personal property were to be banished.  Everyone was to work for the common good, and altruism was to be its own reward.

How did it work out?  Horribly.  In the three winters of 1621-1623, many died from starvation, pneumonia, or both.  Here is Governor Bradford's own summary of the community's results with what we now call Socialism:

""The experience that was had in this common course and condition, tried sundry years and that amongst godly and sober men, may well evince the vanity of that conceit of Plato's and other ancients applauded by some of later times; that the taking away of property and bringing in community into a commonwealth would make them happy and flourishing; as if they were wiser than God. For this community (so far as it was) was found to breed much confusion and discontent and retard much employment that would have been to their benefit and comfort. For the young men, that were most able and fit for labour and service, did repine that they should spend their time and strength to work for other men's wives and children without any recompense.""

In other words, said the Governor, it simply didn't work.

Wisely, in April, 1623, Bradford abruptly abandoned the idealistic practice of collectivism. Instead, he assigned a plot of land to each family, permitting them to keep everything they grew or made and to market anything they didn't consume themselves.  He actually harnessed all that awful ""greed"" and put it to work in a Free Enterprise system.  Bradford had discovered that even these most idealistic of peoples had no reason to put in any extra effort without the motivation of personal incentives to do so.

So how did Free Enterprise work out for the same people in the same place under the same circumstances?  Boffo!

The Pilgrims soon had more food than they could eat or trade amongst themselves.  So they set up trading posts and exchanged goods with the Native Americans.  They paid off their debts to their London sponsors and soon attracted a great European migration.

As Bradford summarized the new approach:

This had very good success, for it made all hands very industrious, so as much more corn was planted than otherwise would have been by any means the Governor or any other could use, and saved him a great deal of trouble, and gave far better content.

This was an essential and timeless lesson, learned the hard way.  So why isn't this lesson featured up front, in neon lights, in American history classes?  Why isn't it the lead story of the Pilgrim experience?  Perhaps it's because the people who write our history textbooks still don't want to believe it.  Perhaps those authors still cling to the hope that some form of Socialism will one day triumph over Free Enterprise.  Unfortunately for those authors, the historical record couldn't be clearer, and the Pilgrims' experience is Exhibit One:  when it comes to bettering the life of the common man, Free Enterprise works -- and Socialism fails.

For more than 3000 years at Passover, Jews around the world have been re-telling the story of their deliverance from slavery, and for over 2000 years at Easter, Christians have been re-telling the story of their redemption.  Now that it's been nearly 400 years since the Pilgrims landed in America, perhaps we could begin re-telling the real story of Thanksgiving every year, headlining those life-and-death lessons the Pilgrims learned about the differences between Socialism and Free Enterprise.

It leaves out the fact the Catholic Church wouldn't grant the King's divorce and that is what led him to start his own Church but picks up pretty well from there. This has some acting demonstrations and tells the story in the usual semi flat way that history usually gets told.

 I preferred the DVD called Monumental to this. The story is told with more passion and interviews and deeper explanation of the religious freedom aspect and the relevance to us today of what they did then.

They compliment each other though. Desparate Crossing tells more about the other people that they made the voyage with and lived with ealy on and Monumental tells the story more from the Puritan/Pilgrim perspective and purpose.",1362096000,2,750,4.7984496124031

2679149,4,B000JU7JE6,Was quite enjoyable if you don't know much about how the English settled in a new land with religious freedoms they could not expect from the English monarchy back home.  It seemed that whilst almost half who started on the journey to the new world perished from disease and horrible living conditions before setting foot on land at Plymouth that this expedition whilst not without danger seemed more friendlier then what the English colonists experienced when they landed at Jamestowne Virginia some twenty years earlier.  Was a fascinating DVD of about 1hr 30mins in duration just enough to keep you interested without feeling bored.  Highly recommend the DVD to anyone interested in the English Monarchy and early North American civilisation.,1348963200,,745,5.191666666666666
2679150,5,B000JU7JE6,"I am glad I read the reviews on the product page of this DVD. Otherwise I would not have purchased this DVD and would have missed a very good, even-handed and well-researched documentary.

This DVD, ""Desperate Crossing: The Untold Story Of The Mayflower"", impressed me as a very well made and carefully researched documentary that presented the facts of the story quite well and in a comprehensive fashion. It tells the story of the ""Pilgrims"", the English separatists who left England for the New World (with a stopover in Holland) to found the Plymouth Colony in what is today Massachusetts.

The story begins in England where separatists (those opposed to the Church Of England theologically), are hounded and persecuted for their beliefs. They believe they must leave their homeland for the freedom to worship as they choose. After moving to the more tolerant Holland, they become concerned that they are losing their identity in their new home and make the radical decision to go to the New World - America.

Their crossing of the ocean is fraught with delays and perils - uncluding damage to the ship which they make temporary repairs with a giant screw. When they reach the coast of north America, they find hostile indians, scurvy and sickness and hunger. The DVD highlights the first document of self-government in North America - the Mayflower Compact - even though it was but a temporary expedient. Their struggle to create a colony is well documented and told factually. I was surprised that the Wampanoag indians decide to assist the Pilgrims in part because they sought them as allies in their conflicts with other indian tribes.

The story of Squanto is well told as is the Pilgrims' attitude of peaceful intentions toward the indians. We come to know of the terrible effects of Old World diseases upon the indians and their understandable aversion to the newcomers.

This is a good documentary that is well worth the price. It is 180 minutes long - long enough to give in-depth treatment to the subject. I heartily recommend this DVD and give it five stars!",1340323200,,2073,4.877840909090909
2679151,5,B000JU7JE6,"Excellent DVD for all ages. Great for the homeschooling family to find truth in the meaning of Thanksgiving...answers all the ""why"" questions they may have in a laid out, honest and appropriate manner. Good entertainment value as well.",1321920000,2,235,5.2105263157894735

It has just enough Historian`s inter-posing their thoughts to make it not get bogged down at all. The most pleasent suprise was the way they treated the Pilgrims faith, it was honest and accurate and being a lover of the Puritans and Non-conformists I was glad to see them treated in a good light. I collect the works of the period from the 1600`s and it was quite accurate in who these people were. They were not up-tight religious people, just those whom wanted to worship in true spirit and truth. The Indians were also shown in an accurate picture.

I would have liked to have seen or heard the names of those in the first encounter with the native peoples in the first documented armed conflict.

Facet's of lives that have changed dramatically over the past few centuries.  The film includes everything from an interesting glimpse of life as a member of a non-approved religious sect, to the lack of sanitation and privacy on-board a ship at the time, and their relationship with the indigenous people in Massachusetts at the time.

2679156,5,B000JU7JE6,"Without pandering to either the revisionists or the 1950's version of the Pilgrim's first few years, this is an in-depth study of a great many issues faced by the curious religious sect from Leiden. I appreciated that it retained some of the characteristicss from the book MAYFLOWER, but wished for more. This documentary dealt very well with representation of the Native tribes and the goof-ups if not actual larcenous behavior of the newcomers. Great detail in costuming, shot on locations in Plymouth colony using the Mayflower II to re-create added reality was fantastic.
One serious caveat: plenty of gratuitous vomiting during the sea voyage. I mean, disgusting ewwww factor. You TOLD us people died of disease but didn't make the viewer suffer through it, couldn't you just TELL us they puked? Or made do with one actual hurl and some gagging noises? Did we have to witness a dozen?

2679157,5,B000JU7JE6,"After showing most of this video to my eighth grade American history classes, I find that it actively engages students to the story of the ordeals and hardships of the Separatists (Pilgrims). The beginning of the video tells the story of the lack of freedom of the press, speech, and religion in England in the seventeenth century. English, Dutch, and Native cultures are shown in the form of reenactments and primary source images. This video has quality acting, excellent historian commentary, and great reenactments. In watching the video many times, these are notes that I took from a Desperate Crossing.

Scrooby, England: This is the city and country where the story of the Pilgrims began.
Pilgrims: They were emigrants to a new world and history refers to the group of people on the Mayflower as Pilgrims.
William Bradford: He wrote most most of the information that is known about the Pilgrims. In 1607 he was an orphan, but was passionate about theology.
Church of England: It was established in 1534 by King Henry VIII.
Protestants: Martin Luther and others hoped to reform the Catholic Church. Many English people were happy when King Henry VIII broke away from the Catholic Church because they hoped the Church would be reformed.
Separatists: Some people felt the king's church could never be purified and wanted to separate from it. They thought there shouldn't be a church of England, but the English courts moved against these people.
Puritans: They wanted to make the Church a better place and remove bad practices from the Catholic Church.
King James: James is intellectual, a practical Scottish politician, and believes he is God's right hand man on earth because he was king. He believed in religious unity and obedience. (10 minutes)
Holland: The separatists decided to go to this country because they heard there was Freedom of Religion for all people. They were forced to secretly leave England for Holland, but were captured by an English magistrate. They were finally allowed to leave and emigrate to the Netherlands.
Netherlands: It is a country that is a melting pot. The Dutch state has seven sovereignties that allow religious tolerance. (15 minutes)
Amsterdam: The city is more industrial than agrarian and caused Bradford difficulty because his background was in farming.
Dorothy May: She was a separatist who came to Holland and eventually became the wife of William Bradford.
congregation: This is a religious assembly of persons or believers. Separatists, Pilgrims, and other Protestants had various congregations.
John Robinson: The pastor to the 300 English refugees or Separatists living in Holland.
William Brewster: He was a church elder and learned how to use a printing press in his fifties. He used the press for profit and publishing pamphlets against the oppressive rule of King James. (20 minutes)
Dutch: Many of the Separatists became concerned that the Dutch were too worldly and set poor Christian examples for their children.
America: This was home to only about 2,000 Europeans and millions of native inhabitants.
Jamestown: This was not a very successful colony, but the Separatists still discussed the possibility of moving to this area of America.
Native Americans: Some of these people were captured or kidnapped and brought back to Europe as human specimens or living advertisements of the Americas.
Virginia: The Pilgrims decided to settle in this location because it was claimed by the king of England.
Leiden, Netherlands in 1618: The Pilgrims had to get permission from King James in this year to go to Virginia in America.
Edward Winslow: He was a young printer who worked for Brewster and became a member of the Separatist congregation
Speedwell: Fifty-five Separatist colonists left Holland on July 23, 1620 to England on this small ship that was purchased for their voyage to the New World. (43 minutes)
Mayflower: In Southampton, England, the Pilgrims locate this ship. Its was a merchant vessel or cargo ship. It was not designed as a passenger vessel, but it was a standard form of transportation in the seventeenth century. There are 102 passengers that end up traveling on the Mayflower.
Tradesmen or Strangers: This group of people also traveled with the Pilgrims. Many of the people had special skills, such as a barrel maker. Bradford called the people ""strangers.""
voyage: On August 5, 1620, the Mayflower and Speedwell left on the trip to America. (52 minutes) The Speedwell was left behind and more people were forced to travel on the Mayflower because it was not seaworthy. Twenty passengers left the journey at Plymouth, England. The main beam almost broke in October and nearly caused the ship to split in two. Fortunately, a Pilgrim had brought a large screw that was used to jack up the main beam. A sailor died on the journey and a baby named Oceanus was born to the Hopkin parents. The journey took nine weeks.
Master Christopher Jones: He is the captain of the Mayflower was hired to take the Separatists to Virginia.
diet: hardtack, salted beef, and beer was the main food for passengers on the Mayflower
Hudson River: On November 9, 1620, land located at Cape Cod was spotted. This was the location that the Pilgrims hoped to establish their colony. It was far north of Jamestown, but legally still part of the English colony of Virginia. Master Jones was forced to go to another location because of bad weather.
Mayflower Compact: Pilgrims and the laborers argued over the leadership of the new colony when Master Christopher Jones was forced to land the Mayflower outside of the original patent for the Hudson River location. All settlers came e up with an agreement or compact that acted as a temporary government for the colony. The document does not create democracy, but an elected authority.
Nauset: This is the name of the land where the Pilgrims first arrived. It was also the name of a local tribe that attacked the Pilgrim.
scurvey: Bradford wrote that a lot of the settlers were sick with this illness because of their poor diet. Symptoms include bleeding of the gums, bruising, and bad pain.
hospitalization: Many settlers died in the months of January and February; two to three people sometimes died a day. The few structures the settlers had made were used for hospitals. In the ""heart of winter,"" fifty settlers died.
Samoset: He was the first Indian to make contact with the Pilgrims and other settlers. He knew basic English and was able to understand both cultures and communicate with the Pilgrims.
Massasoit: He was the chief of the Wampanoag tribe and brought sixty men from his tribe to meet the Pilgrims. Squanto accompanied this chief at the alliance meeting.
Wampanoag: The tribe was weakened by disease and made an alliance with the Pilgrims as a protection from the larger tribes in the region.
Squanto: He spoke English better than Samoset and ended up staying with the Pilgrims and teaching them about his native culture and farming. He learned English from John Slany, a shipbuilder, and lived for three years in Corn Hill. He was taken back to Newfoundland and traveled back to his tribe where he discovered everyone had died of plague.
England: Due to the harsh winter, illnesses, and deaths, the Mayflower crew brought nothing of value back to England. Investors were very disappointed to learn the cargo was a bunch of rocks, which helped provide balance to the Mayflower.
Thanksgiving: The first Thanksgiving was a three day feast with the Pilgrims and Wampanoags. They feasted on turkey, geese, bass, fish, and five deer that the Wampanoag brought. This feast was a time of celebration and giving thanks to God.",1290124800,17,7632,4.990580847723705
2679158,4,B000JU7JE6,"This documentary/docu-drama provides insights into the backgrounds and trials of the Pilgrims.  the focus of this show is the telling of the story of the Mayflower Company, focusing on the reformers of John Bradford's sect.  I knew about their travels and travails in England and then Holland.  One thing I'd forgotten,though, was that about 1/2 of the passengers on the Mayflower were not part of his group, but were an assortment of people who had been recruited to join the colonizing expedition to the northern Virginia colony.  Circumstances had them land even farther north than that though, and they founded an entirely new colony in what is now Mass.

If it weren't for the Native Americans and their willingness to help the Pilgrims plant their firt crop and give them time to establish themselves we may never have heard much about the Pilgrims because they all would probably have starved to death that first winter instead of half of them dying that winter.

The narration was good, the costuming, also good.  There was some acting here and there, and that was OK, but the show has a definite made-for-TV feeling to it.  Nevertheless, it's a good review of what we know about their situation and what they did to survive.

I don't know that I'd be all that comfortable crossing the Atlantic on a modern ship even with all the technology and knowledge we have today.
But to get on a vessel that probably wasn't even sea-worthy and head across that great expanse of water into the unknown back in 1620?  Can you imagine being on board this small ship and crashing the waves of the Atlantic Ocean for 66 days?
Things had obviously gotten pretty bad for these pilgrims in order for them to take such a huge risk and leave all they knew, properties and family, to start over in a totally foreign and unknown territory!

When the white men landed, ""We saw them but they didn't see us.  We were one with nature.""  And the like.

Unfortunately, the DVD is seriously flawed. Amazon lists the aspect ration as 1.78:1 but technically that is not correct. Just as the History Channel did with the Dogfight series, the DVD is actually letterboxed 16:9 matted into a 4:3 frame. Why the History Channel continues to use this outmoded format for their DVD releases is a mystery. Even cheap direct to video DVD releases are in anamorphic format. I can author a disc in anamorphic format on my home PC so it can't be that hard or expensive to do.

If you have an older home theater system, this disc being letterboxed may not matter to you but if you have a HDTV with your DVD player connected via HDMI, it is likely that you will not be able to watch this in other than letterbox format without lowering the resolution of your system.
