I wanted to order all 3 Mike Seeger videos at once, but this will keep me busy with new ideas.  It's also fun just to watch and listen if you are in the Clawhammer camp or the Scruggs camp.  Humans create music no matter what.",1504569600,,370,4.397058823529412
8154635,5,B000K7UBW0,"If you want to learn CH banjo, skip a lot of the other beginners books and start here...you may be challenged a little, but at least you'll know how to play the style with the right technique.  If you've played for a while, you'll still get plenty out of this instructional guide.",1498348800,,280,4.384615384615385

8154638,4,B000K7UBW0,"I must admit, this book and DVD were not what I expected. I was expecting and instructional manual.  It was instead a highly interesting and entertaining history of various types of banjos and styles of playing..  Mr Seeger's knowledge and skill cannot be over-emphasized.  Highly entertaining.",1380758400,2,294,5.3478260869565215
8154639,4,B000K7UBW0,"In his own way Mike Seeger introduces you to old timey banjo. It's not a method. It presents some history and shows a variety of styles, not just clawhammer. It's more about the songs and the individual playing styles that originated that song. Historically it's cool, and there are some patterns that he'll teach you. The accompanying booklet is helpful and gives a lot of info.",1313539200,7,379,4.757575757575758
8154640,5,B000K7UBW0,"I've never written a review before, but feel compelled to since no one else has. This is the first in a 3-DVD set that Mike Seeger made to teach the banjo styles presented on his Grammy-nominated CD,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Southern-Banjo-Sounds/dp/B00000AFQR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Southern Banjo Sounds</a>. Included here are early styles that Seeger learned from older traditional banjo players, including rare right-hand techniques learned from African American players Lucious Smith and Josh Thomas. Songs in both up-picking and down-picking (stroke, frailing, rapping, clawhammer, etc.) styles are taught, with each piece performed through at full tempo, then broken down into small sections and played through slowly. Especially noteworthy is Seeger's ability to play very slowly, yet retain musicality.

Production values on these DVDs is excellent, with exceptional sound and picture quality, camera work and editing. I've found these DVDs to be invaluable in learning to play some banjo styles I'd found inscrutable before. Highly recommended.
