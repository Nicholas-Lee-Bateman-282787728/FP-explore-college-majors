8038790,5,B0006530TC,"This production by Puerto Rico's Banco Popular is a wonderful video not only for lovers of traditional music and dance, but also for anyone looking for information on the Afro-Puerto Rican traditions of Bomba and Plena.  The version I have seen is in Spanish without subtitles, but the music and dance is incredible and worth experiencing even if you can't understand the interviews.  Banco Popular included many of the most important families who have been preserveing Bomba and Plena over the years in the interviews, explanations, and perfomances in this film.  They also included popular artists interpreting and giving honor to the musical traditions that preceded the modern popular forms of Salsa.  Exceptional interviews with wonderful anecdotes give a glimpse into the world of La Familia Cepeda and how the music has been passed down for generations in this amazing family.  The production also includes and highlights the differences in the music in various regions of Puerto Rico like Ponce, Santurce, Mayaguez and more.  Other performers, gifted in the creation of music and dance from these different regions, show us the variances in the music from town to town.  Raices is a very nice display of the rich African influences on the folk music and dance of Puerto Rico.  A must for anyone intersted in the history of Puerto Rican music and dance or African influences on the Spanish speaking Caribbean.  Beautifully done!",1102377600,15,1435,5.124463519313305
