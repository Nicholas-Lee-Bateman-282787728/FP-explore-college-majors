3718921,5,B001NH4CEY,"Another powerhouse series from ITC, features antique dealer John Mannering, assisted by apprentices David and Cordelia, on the trail of artifacts and criminals. The platonic pairing of Mannering's The Baron, and Cordelia, is very well presented, although unlike Peel and Steed from The Avengers, there is no real sexual tension between them. Steve Forrest, who died this month at age 87, turns out a solid performance in this adaptation from the John Creasey novels.",1369785600,9,466,5.3108108108108105

3718924,5,B001NH4CEY,"This is good stuff. If you liked Secret Agent you'll like this. I found it better than Mannix (not that I don't like Mike Connors). Steve Forrest got here better scripts than, later, in SWAT. The dialogue at least is superior. Solid, British, entertaining value. Rule Britannia!",1325462400,5,278,4.9361702127659575
3718925,5,B001NH4CEY,"I had never heard of this series so I didn't know what to expect when I bought it.  I knew it was made by ITC which produced many of my favorite series.
I found the series to be fast-paced and interesting for the most part.  The first 10 to 12 episodes are the best but they do tend to drag a little at the end of the series which may be why it only had 1 season.
I believe anyone who liked the Roger Moore ""Saint"" series from the sixties will also enjoy these.",1281657600,17,461,3.893617021276596
3718926,5,B001NH4CEY,"The Baron (1966-67), is an entertaining, action-packed series that delivers excitement and thrills, in much the same style as The Saint.  The program was produced by Britain's Incorporated Television Company (ITC), whose credits at this time included The Saint, Danger Man, and supermarionation programs like The Thunderbirds, and Fireball XL5.  What made The Baron unusual, was that it featured an American actor, Steve Forrest, as its star.

John Mannering, nicknamed `The Baron', was originally a creation of British mystery writer John Creasy.  Mannering was British, but for television, ITC changed him to a Texas cattle 'baron', who owned antique shops in London, Paris, and Boston.  The series ran for just one season, producing 30 episodes, and was the first ITC production featuring live actors, to be shot in color.  Like The Saint, The Baron was also distributed in the US, but because of poor ratings, was not renewed for a second season.

This was unfortunate, as the tall and handsome Forrest clearly demonstrated that an American could perform as a lead in a British action series, with dashing coolness, comparable to Roger Moore.  Forrest, is physically a little smaller than Moore, but with fiery blue eyes, a similar wardrobe, and slicked back hair, there is more than a passing resemblance between the two.  Forrest has a serious, tough, attitude which differs from the mischievous charm that Roger Moore brought to Simon Templar.  The Saint and The Baron, have an extremely similar look, feel, and sound, as Edwin Astley, who provided the music for Danger Man and The Saint, also did the same for The Baron.  Long time partners Robert S. Baker and Monty Berman co-created The Baron.  Their partnership split, with Baker continuing to work on The Saint, and Berman taking control of The Baron.

Being an antique dealer, proves to be a gateway to thrilling adventure, as Mannering becomes embroiled in a variety of intrigue, with no shortage of mystery, murder, greedy villains, and beautiful women.  Mannering mainly moves in the upper echelons of society, and though based in England, also travels to exotic locations.  Mannering operates with the help of his associate David Marlowe (Paul Feriss), who is later replaced by Cordelia Winfield (Sue Lloyd, The Ipcress File), a government agent.

Mannering blends in wherever he goes, and has a fair for physical action.  His car, a Jensen CV8 Mark II, has the personalized license plate 'BAR1', and is equipped with a car phone, quite an exclusive accessory for 1966.  The Baron is a more action oriented program, with a higher level of violence, and use of firearms (many with silencers!), than either The Saint or Danger Man.  Dead bodies stack up like cordwood.

The series features some of Britain's best acting talent.  Lois Maxwell, Sylvia Syms, Annette Andre, Jane Merrow, Yvonne Furneaux, Bernard Lee, Jeremy Brett, Mike Pratt, Joseph Furst, Anton Diffring, Edward Woodward, Vladek Sheybal, Kenneth J. Warren, Raymond Huntley, Sam Wannamaker, Walter Gotell, David Bauer, and John Orchard, are among the many familiar faces.

The stories usually concern crime, intrigue, or espionage, as John Mannering tangles with crooks, criminals, and agents of foreign governments.  The tone of the program changes after Cordelia Winfield replaces David Marlowe as Mannering's sidekick, as her presence helps to soften Mannering's 'all business' attitude.  John Mannering isn't one that chases the ladies much, and there is no romance Cordelia.  She knows nothing about antiques, but soon becomes a competent aide.  On the flip side, as the series progresses, although a government agent, she seems to become less capable physically, and frequently is captured or needs rescuing.

Under the supervision of Terry Nation, the quality of the writing is very good.  The action is lively, set in a wide variety of places, and with a very high level of violence.  The stories don't repeat themselves, but the series has a few amusing clichs, that seem to be favored by the writers.  The biggest, is the ubiquitous use of silencers.  Others include cars flying off cliffs, bodies dropping from buildings, corpses falling out of closets, Cordelia's fainting spells, car crashes, and people overhearing conversations at doorways.

Image quality is probably about as good as it gets for an ITC series of this era, although the colors are rather flat.  There isn't much dirt or print damage, but there is some softness, strange color shifts (typical for ITC), and most things shot at night look pretty dreadful.  Except for long shots, Forrest is rarely doubled, and does most of his own stunts and fights.

The Baron is a tough, solid, action series, that almost always packs a wallop.  Steve Forest's performance as an American who never seems out of place, at any level of British society, is impressive and convincing.  Unfortunately Forrest is not featured in any of the extras, however Sue Lloyd and others in the production team, provide commentary for three of the episodes.  For straight ahead no nonsense action, The Baron is one of ITE's best, and this eight DVD set is definitely recommended to fans of 1960's crime dramas.  Steve Forrest would later star in the police drama SWAT (1975).",1267056000,31,5253,5.1280846063454755
3718927,4,B001NH4CEY,"I enjoyed this quite a bit even though it frequently appeared dated with bad cold war accents and even worse impressions of Asians by White actors.
This was especially true of the first few episodes, but it hit its stride and was certainly well worth watching.  Fans of the Avengers might enjoy this even though it is not as outre and well acted (there was an important overlap in the writers).  If you like shows of the 1960s, as I do, definitely get this.",1246924800,6,457,4.428571428571429
3718928,2,B001NH4CEY,"In the very small subgenre of mystery series revolving around the art world, you can add The Baron ($59.98; Koch) to the list (which I think includes Lovejoy and precious little else). One of an endless string of interchangeable British action series, The Baron was the first live action UK show that premiered in color and starred a Texan who fought crime with his handsome assistant until American networks said ""Give us a broad"" and they dumped the guy in favor of a glamorous female sidekick. You get the entire 30 episode series which is fine but will appeal mostly to those who are already fans of the show. Visit me at michaelgiltz dot com.",1245369600,5,647,4.6347826086956525

8327079,5,B001NH4CEY,"Being a fan of 1960's spy/intrigue series such as The Prisoner, The Avengers, Danger Man/Secret Agent, The Saint, and Mission Impossible, I purchased The Baron as a blind buy and I couldn't be happier!  The show is very well done and Steve Forrest is terrific as the lead.  The storylines are very engaging and entertaining.  If you are a fan of the shows mentioned above, you won't be disappointed.  I highly recommend buying this complete series set.",1490745600,,452,4.8311688311688314
8327080,5,B001NH4CEY,"In the day,when Primetime TV was Top Quality,the 3 TV networks once gave American viewers a taste of British creativity,and no where was that more evident,but with Sir Lew Grade's ITC company,which gave American viewers the best British Primetime shows there was! ABC-TV's ""THE BARON"",starring Steve Forrest,some ten years before his other hit ABC series ""S.W.A.T."" in 1975,plays an American antique dealer in Great Britain,with a flair for intrigue and adventure! running only one season,the show was a trademark of America's love affair with British TV,especially with ""THE SAINT"" on NBC,,""SECRET AGENT"" aka ""DANGER MAN"" which ran on CBS in 1966,and the hit classic,""THE PRISONER"",the Summer 1968 replacement for ""THE JACKIE GLEASON SHOW"",were all of ITC's elite corps! and i didn't forget ""THE AVENGERS"",which also had an ABC-TV run in 1966! but ""THE BARON"" was one of those British adventure shows,that had its own style. i recommend this DVD to viewers,who knew and loved such shows,and who grew-up watching these British imports,with great appeal!",1478044800,,1053,5.426829268292683
8327081,5,B001NH4CEY,"The Baron was a surprise. Well written and in keeping with the likes of the Saint and Man of the World with Craig Stevenson was exciting and full of mystery not to mention the styles of the time period, wonderful. Steve Forrest was better than I thought he would have been, he to was a surprise. That car he drove was something else a Jensen, I had never seen one before. Did a little research on it and was pleasantly surprised. Loyd, Forrest's co-star in the mid to later shows was something else also; very stylish.",1434844800,,518,4.40625

8327084,5,B001NH4CEY,"May not have been a successful series,only 2 seasons,but my mother and I both agreed way back when that Steve Forrest was a hunk. Watched him in anything I could catch on TV.He may not have had as much movie success as his brother,Dana Andrews,but he had similar looks,albeit blonde and blue-eyed,but he was always convincing. Will treasure this series in memory of Mr Forrest's passing,and hope his family are doing okay. We miss and love both him and Dana Andrews,brothers forever.",1403654400,2,483,4.902439024390244
8327085,4,B001NH4CEY,"The Baron aired at a time when everyone was spy crazy.  This was the era of James Bond, The Man From U.N.C.L.E., I spy and a plethora of other shows in the secret agent genre, even Get Smart.  It was the cold war, and everyone wanted to be a spy and get the most beautiful women.  The Baron really fits the bill, and of course it was made by the Brits, after all, who knew spies better than the Brits.  Steve Forrest is a very good actor and is completely believable in the lead role of The Baron, John Mannering, dealer an antique dealer, an American living in London.  After doing a little private undercover work to help out a few friends he is sought out by the British Intelligence agency to do a little free lance work for them.  Sort of like Mission Impossible covert activities, ""of course if you are caught Mr. Mannering we will disavow any knowledge of you.""  The Baron uses his vast knowledge of antique art etc. to help solve the missions he is sent on.  This show is very timely now, since some of the back story of John Mannering is that he was one of the experts seeking out the stolen art by the Nazi's to return it to its proper origin.  His character was a Monuments Man.  It is a shame this show only lasted one season in the mid 60's it was a wonderful show.  I really enjoyed it as a school boy, and I am very glad I can see it again.  Well worth the investment.  The only drawback is that some of the scenery and effects appear somewhat out of date, but one can overlook this considering it is 50 years old.  Steve Forrest was a tremendous actor, often overlooked.  He refused to cash in on the celebrity of his more well known older brother Dana Andrews.  R.I.P. Steve Forrest you are missed.",1394323200,6,1715,4.246913580246914
8327086,5,B001NH4CEY,"I found the dvd very good quality, and the audio extras very interesting.  I didn't remember the series from when I was a kid but love spy shows.  With the cost so very reasonable I took a chance and I'm glad I did.  It's like watching a brand new show but in the format I love.  The great Steve Forest (who just passed away)  I sat and watch about have of the series as a memorial to him.  I did remember enjoying Sue LLyod when I was a teenage and she was hot, she looks great. IF you liked Danger Man (Secret Agent) The Saint or even I Spy then the Baron is just what you are looking for.",1371254400,5,591,3.9243697478991595
8327087,4,B001NH4CEY,"I am enjoying this show. I did not remember many episodes but I watched it and enjoyed the series. It is good has well paced stories.
 The Late Steve Forrest is well cast as the lead and does an excellent job he is a very underated actor.
 The show was one of many out from England at this time around 1966 and this one is a definite collectors item for those of us that believe the 60s were the most original time for creative television.",1370995200,3,439,4.152941176470589
8327088,5,B001NH4CEY,"The 60's / 70's was full of mystery series that were fun to watch, not gross and full of blood, violence and hatred.  This short series was in the same vein as the Saint (Roger Moore), The Avengers (Diana Rigg need I say more) and The Persuaders (Tony Curtis).

Great European locations, plots easy and fun  to follow.  For the price you get 30 shows, plus all kinds of extras about the stars, directors and locations.  Neat stuff and for the re-runs of summer 2013 we have something new to watch!",1370390400,7,497,4.417582417582418
