7834177,4,6302980666,"Okay so, it was made in the 70s so the picture quality is not that great. They should consider digitally remastering it. It is 100% in Spanish with NO subtitles so if you don't understand you should skip it ( or try to understand, lol). The story being told is a pretty timeless one (poor guy , rich girl etc). AND, it just happens to be pretty funny. I personally would consider it a musical since Sr. Fernandez sings sooooo much, but that's ok since that is what he is known for and has an amazing voice.",1374883200,,506,4.22680412371134
7834178,4,6302980666,"Vicente Fernandez is a cab driver in this 1974 film, which is about class struggles, the joys of a simple life, and a man who knows how to communicate better with his horse than the pretty women in his life. Vicente gets involved with rich girl Ofelia (Marcela Lopez Rey), who he takes as a fare one day, with such bad results that he decides to leave the city and go to a ranch with his abuelita Chenta (the great cigar smoking Sara Garcia), but he can't escape the cute girls, with lovely Lucia Mendez as Carmen, and Rebeca Silva as Maria, crash landing their plane onto his property, and into his life, to complicate it, and give him more to sing about.

There are quite a few funny scenes, some touching ones, and a smattering of songs, which as one can always expect from Chente, are excellent, among them the title song, and ""Ojala que te vaya bonito."" One of the most endearing facets of Vicente is his ability to make fun of himself, and he does a lot of self-deprecating humor in this film. ""El Hijo del Pueblo"" is a far cry from the classics of Mexico's Golden Era of filmmaking, but it's a winner for Chente fans, shows the many sides of his talent, and is very entertaining.",1164326400,,1186,4.366515837104072
7834179,5,6302980666,"Comedy, drama, a cantankerous but loving Grandma, the struggle between the rich and the poor, this movie has it all! Chock full of songs I remember my parents playing during my youth, finally being able to understand the feelings they conveyed.  An excellent film defining the classes.  One of Vicente's best performances.",1132099200,,322,5.173076923076923
