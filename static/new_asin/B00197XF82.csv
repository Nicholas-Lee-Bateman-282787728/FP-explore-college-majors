8272376,1,B00197XF82,"Others have already correctly pointed out that the film quality is poor, I thought it might even date from the sixties. My comment is that the title itself and the lead editorial review are dishonest and deceptive. This series does not focus on predators any more than anything else in the ocean. As a final nail in the coffin, much of the information is outdated and very wrong.

My review evaluates the critical and scientific value of the set. For one penny plus shipping for about ten hours of video it is not such a bad deal. But remember you get what you pay for.",1418601600,,569,4.419047619047619
8272377,3,B00197XF82,"A classic but could be better done. it is like watching a 35mm film in picture and sound. They should have converted it to HD. The information is good, the animals are cool I just wish it looked and sounded better. I paid $10 at a grocery store and paid too much. Tin is nice and the insert is thick cardboard not wood.",1406073600,,319,4.079365079365079
8272378,1,B00197XF82,"The tin is nice.  The picture on the front of the tin makes it look more up to date.  The picture and sound are horrible.  I am not one of these picky people who  has to have the clearsest sound and volume, but this was BAD!!  Lots of humans.  Very dark in color.  Very boring.  I bought it at Sam's Club for 10 bucks and still feel like I was ripped.  I decided to use it as punishment.  It will make the perfect timeout.  Don't waste your money on this.  Skip it unless you want the tin.  I will have to say it was packaged well inside too.  I have never gotten DVDs with wood ""holders"".  I don't know what to call them.",1335916800,2,622,3.9430894308943087
