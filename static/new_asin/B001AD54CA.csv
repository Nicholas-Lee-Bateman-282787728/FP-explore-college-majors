8276789,3,B001AD54CA,"(1975, aka DIARY OF A MURDERESS) Marisa Mell, Richard Conte, Anthony Steffen.  A femme fatale (the ever-luscious Marisa Mell) worms her way into the art-filled mansion of a millionaire played by Richard Conte, under the premise of being an art scholar and psychologist willing to look after his 'retarded' son (their words, not mine). After disposing of him, she goes after his son. Then come several twists we saw coming, as they`re part and parcel in these movies. An interesting Italian, gothic thriller with a twisted, sardonic ending. The print source is somewhat faded and blurry and scratched at various points. It also appears that several scenes are edited or missing. Good ending to a rather predictable plot, I`d recommend this only to fans of Marisa (I`ve loved her since I saw her in Bava`s brilliant 'Danger: Diabolik') and Eurosleaze in general. A rare artifact unearthed by Sinister Cinema some will have wished stayed buried, others will revel in its obscurity as I did.",1266278400,3,987,5.0182926829268295
