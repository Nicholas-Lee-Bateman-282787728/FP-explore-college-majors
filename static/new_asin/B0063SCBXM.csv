The plot was great and so was the acting. This has to be one of Shawnee's best roles yet (obviously next to her great Saw character. The movie was about Newlywed Wendy Crews(Shawnee Smith) whom has the shock of her life when her husband is arrested by the FBI on their wedding day. When he's convicted of murder and embezzlement, Wendy goes undercover to discover the truth. Definitely worth the watch, I watched it on youtube. You should definitely watch it and if you like it buy the DVD! Can't go wrong their!",1357948800,,666,4.4227642276422765
