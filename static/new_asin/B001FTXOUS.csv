8302767,4,B001FTXOUS,"Frank Webb is in my opinion, one of the finest contemporary watercolor artists on earth. Mr. Webb truly takes advantage of all the rich features of the watercolor medium- from it's jewel-like transparency to it's opulent wet-into-wet explosions of color, to it's subtle gradations. Frank is one of the best teachers also, in that he doesn't just show you how to emulate his techniques, but rather teaches you to think like an artist and always proffers a good smattering of artistic theory and philosophy as he instructs. It is a great benefit just to watch him work, and it will inspire you to paint.",1304208000,,601,4.788461538461538
