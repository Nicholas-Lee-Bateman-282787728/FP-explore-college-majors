4672432,5,B005F44X36,"Great film, the advertised one that states ""This all-region DVD (NTSC format) will play in North America"" worked no problem in my US DVD players.  Would like to see in the theater if it came locally.

Previously saw a ""long"" version of the movie (165 minutes) and frankly the 106 minute version was better since it has no talking heads such as John Bisignano trying to act deep.",1314662400,35,378,4.544117647058823

4672434,1,B005F44X36,"""Product Details"" in Amazon shows ""Language: Italian, Portuguese, Japanese"".
However, this Blu-ray disk (ASIN: B004OBQQPY?) was Italian disk which has  Italian voice over ""original sound"" which is mixture of English, Portguese, and very few Japanese. This means that Japanese language is not actually supported in language selection on disk-menu (only Italian and Portuguese is selectable as the disk function. Even English is not selectable).
This means that the product description in Amazon.com page is wrong (not same as disc package description) and very confusing. It shouled be corrected urgently.",1313884800,13,604,5.786516853932584
4672435,4,B005F44X36,"This is a Italian DVD, I bought ir because it says in the description that  have english subtitles, but the english subtitles are only for the Bonus Disc.  If you are a Ayrton Senna fan, you must have this film.",1313539200,3,211,4.25
4672436,5,B005F44X36,"To quote Top Gear, which stole a march on this kid and wrote exactly what I would've penned after a screening of '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Senna/dp/B004OBQQPY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Senna</a>,' ""The year after [the tragic death of Formula 1 superstar Ayrton Senna], Spanish actor Antonio Banderas was set to play [the Brasilian driver] in a $100m Hollywood bio-pic. Of course, it never happened, and now it never will. With the release of 'Senna,' a feature-length documentary about arguably the greatest and certainly the most charismatic racing driver of all time, the real story has been told. Definitively, thrillingly and with real emotion.

Big movies usually follow a three-act narrative arc and Senna's life lends itself naturally to that. It opens with never-before-seen footage of him karting in Brazil, and reaches a mesmerising and moving climax with the dreadful events at Imola in May 1994. In between, Senna's racing career unfolds in a way that even the most optimistic Hollywood screenwriter would scarcely have dared imagine. It's all here: the first glimmers of genius, the ascent to greatness, the period of domination, the bitter rivalries and intense politicking, disillusion and dismay, flawed heroism, the final grim chapter.""

Please don't be led astray by any 1, 2, or even 3-star reviews. 'Senna' is a spectacular film and a moving and dramatic work of art that honors Senna the man and satisfies the yearnings of his fans to reconnect with a sporting god, while still respecting his memory and treating with dignity Ayrton's family and friends, colleagues and even rivals. I'm not ashamed to admit that the funeral coverage moved me to tears...

""The circumstances of Senna's demise are as chilling as ever. The feeling that he somehow knew something terrible was going to befall him is inescapable. But in the midst of the tragedy, the film strives for an elegiac note and achieves it. Formula One still misses Ayrton Senna but this is an appropriate memorial.""

4672438,4,B005F44X36,"The first thing you need to know is this is a Region 2 PAL DVD. I have a region-free DVD player so I could play it no problem but most DVD players in the U.S. will not play this movie.

This is a first rate documentary of the racing career of Senna and I really enjoyed it. Interviews are recorded in the original languages (some are in English) and have subtitles available in Portugese and Italian. The second 'Extra Features' disk has English subtitles available. I didn't really see much there to watch.

Enough of the interviews are in English so even without subtitles, I could follow much of the story and it is a great story.

I have this movie in Blu-Ray also and bought this thinking it would add English subtitles so I could see what was missing from the Blu-Ray.  The main feature is the same -- Portugese and Italian subtitles only.",1311552000,34,845,4.432258064516129

4672454,5,B005F44X36,"I first learned about Aryton Senna a few years back through Gran Turismo 6. There was a mode in the game in which you drove some of the race cars he drove around the same track, with the goal of beating his time around the track. The closest I ever came was about a half a second from his record around Brands Hatch in the Lotus. He always inspired me to want to race, and to pursue cars. I never knew the influence he had outside of racing. I think this film should be watched by everyone, whether you love racing, or hate it. Whether you love Formula 1, or hate it. Its a beautiful film that brings emotion and passion and tells the story of one of the best drivers the world has ever seen.",1497225600,,692,4.095588235294118

4672458,5,B005F44X36,"I feel like every F1 fan has watched this movie at one point or another. This was actually the film that got me into formula 1. It does a really good job portraying most of Senna's career, and his days at Mclaren, but it is a bit biased in painting Prost as the villain, but I understand that most of it was probably for increasing the drama and theatrics of their relationship. It's one of those documentaries I've watched multiple times and never really get sick of.",1489795200,,468,4.390804597701149
4672459,5,B005F44X36,"One of the best! Documentaries ever, that is.
This is one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. Extremely well done. Gives an insight into perhaps the most naturally talented Formula One driver who ever raced. Senna was a peculiar character. And sometimes ruthless. No driver was more talented in the car, however, with the possible exception of Fangio. I was lucky enough to see Senna race twice, in Phoenix. And he was awe inspiring. Making the rest of the field , the best drivers in the world, look like they were giving only 90 %. But that extra ten was all Ayrton. A cut above.
This excellent film gives a great look into this life, and his psyche. Senna was a one of a kind. Watch this movie.",1488758400,,703,4.457364341085271

I am a life long gearhead that has shared this movie with my wife, that let me say is not quite as enthusiastic about the glamor of racing. The last movie that we enjoyed together that had the main topic of motor racing, involved just enough eye candy for her to remain interested. This picture provided a more human side to the track, and exposed the life of a passion. By the end she had tears in her eyes. I would like to believe that it was from the passion and emotion that is from motor racing, but in reality, it was the story of an amazing person. Gone long before his time, Senna brings passion of living close to the edge, and believing in something greater than yourself. I would recommend this documentary to any person. A great watch, and a story that should be shared with everyone.",1485475200,,841,4.397435897435898

4672483,5,B005F44X36,"I came to know about this magnificent all-around person(not just racer), from a friend who is obsessed. I have already known about him for about a decade, and I knew this video was out for a few years already, but i don't know..  I guess it didn't really grab my attention all that much.
Recently I've become a bit more absorbed into racing and formula 1 and well, my interest for all things racing-related expanded. From the date of this review, I've owned this for about two weeks. Before owning it, I watched it online for the first time. Then I had to watch it again right after. Then I made my daughter watch it,  just so I could watch it again, haha!  I have probably seen this 10 times already.
I made my sister (who doesn't care at all for racing) watch it and she was biting her nails during some of the Senna vs Prost racing footage. She said she felt a deep sense of loss and sadness after having watched this.
I agree with all the reviewers that state you don't have to be a racing/Ayrton Senna fan to enjoy this.

4672495,4,B005F44X36,"Ayrton Senna, a racing driver won three Formula One championships (Europe's NASCAR) in 1988, 1990, and 1991. The rivalry between Senna and Alain Prost is like that depicted in ""Rush"" between James Hunt and Niki Lauda. With a camera mounted on his car, you watch from the driver's seat, Senna maneuvering at speeds of 180 to 200 mph.  Senna began racing go-karts competitively at age 13 and was encouraged and supported by his affluent parents. The documentary is presented from Senna's point of view, from his perspective. He felt the political hierarchy in the racing sport held a favoritism toward Prost, and he was treated unfairly. Senna may have brought it on himself through his own actions. He was asked in an interview by a T.V. reporter about his high frequency of crashes with other drivers. He attempted to excuse them as a necessity in order to win, the cost of doing business. Collisions that resulted when he tried to squeeze past opposing drivers going around a turn. Rounding these turns in the track at high speeds allow only one car to safely negotiate. To Senna, winning meant everything, no matter the price. He did not show enough propriety or sportsmanship. This rankled opponents, Prost, who grew to dislike him. Conversely, he was beloved by his fellow countrymen, the Brazilians, as an inspiration and a phenomenal success story. He contributed millions of dollars helping the poor in Brazil.",1466640000,,1417,4.953781512605042

Senna wouldn't have targeted Prost if he had not been a legitimate threat. I am a big fan of Senna, but also I am a big fan of Prost, and the two can go together without any conflict. I feel treating Prost like a cheater only cheapens Senna's accomplishments. Senna's greatness doesn't need padding of belittling others. Senna and Prost were two geniuses with different strengths and very different views of life, and that was the most fascinating part, but I bet it will fall on deaf ears of Senna fanatics.

The unique style of overlaying the race scenes with beautiful music and commentary of his contemporaries who saw him and competed/worked with Ayrton up close, is brilliant documentary style. I loved it, and I keep watching it over and over again. I wish this documentary was longer and not just 90 minutes or so.

You can watch it for free on Youtube, but I would recommend that you buy it, because some of the commentary is in foreign languages, and the official documentary on Amazon, provides sub-titles, whereas the free version does not have any subtitles for the foreign language
commentary clips.

Update 5/19/2015: I would not recommend buying any videos from Amazon. You are basically beholden to Amazon to access your Video. Unlike buying a DVD and using it as you wish, in your car, or your BD player or anywhere else (offline or online being irrelevant), you must be online and be logged in Amazon. My expectation was that once I buy the video, I will be given a copy of it which I can use as I wish as I do with a DVD. This is my gripe in general with Amazon and/or any other provider/seller of video content. If I buy the content I must be given a copy of it which I can use whether online or offline or whether logged into the provider's website or not being irrelevant. After talking to Amazon customer service about this and not getting a satisfactory answer, I will no longer be buying any video content from Amazon, nor can I recommend anyone buying it.",1430438400,,1640,4.5

4672611,5,B005F44X36,"I have only two regrets in life:
1. When I used to go to the bullfights in Mexico City, I used to take photos of the fights but never took a single photo, of or with, the lovely ticket vendor who sold me my tickets. The sweetest of men in a very macho world who was one of my greatest teachers and guardians, without ever being condescending, and I found out long distance that he had just passed.
2. I had never seen live nor met Ayrton Senna and even though I became an F1 fan just about three years ago, it punches a hole in my heart.

I became a fan of Senna's through a piece that Top Gear BBC ran on his life, his work ethic and his racing. At the end of that piece, they recommended this documentary. So I watched it.

A proud Brazilian who was a God-fearing man who raced because that was his life blood, even when that life blood was slowly becoming crushed and blackened by political decisions out of his control, this documentary runs through Senna's karting beginnings all the way to his tragic death in Imola. You go through the loveliness of his personality, combined with a perfectionist-driven driver who drives to win. You fall in love with his complexity and his heart and this is wholly reflected during his funeral where it was a day of national mourning.

There is one very harsh scene of very gruesome accident so you have been warned.

To say I was a terrible mess after watching this is an understatement. I cannot think of this documentary without getting teary-eyed and absolutely gutted that I had never gotten the pleasure to talk to him. But it does bring you as close as you can get to the caliber of this driver among drivers. Most Brazilians are fiercely protective of him, and go even as far as to blow off the terrible accident of Michael Schumacher, who had raced Senna on numerous occasions, only because on that fateful day at Imola, Schumacher was the only one who wanted to keep racing after Senna was taken to the hospital. And even though he passed in 1994, there are people who still hold this grudge.

That's how important of a figure Ayrton was. And all I can say is thank you to those who put this film together because without it, I would have never had this painfully beautiful regret. My life is fuller because of it.",1425168000,,2265,4.39618138424821

4672613,5,B005F44X36,"SENNA  The Movie

I went to see Senna with my daughter and friends this past weekend.  My wholehearted recommendation:  GO SEE IT!  First of all, this is for sure no ordinary documentary.  I was struck after the fact by how little outside narration there was to tell the uninitiated what is going on in the story.  With the exception of some historic clips of race commentary provided by John Bisignano,  the story of Senna keeps unfolding simply through successive scenes and the words of the participants themselves, Ayrton Senna, Alain Prost, Jean-Marie Balestre, and Nelson Piquet among others.  Periodically, titles appear on the screen to give you the name of a race, a date, and a location but otherwise, there is very little structure.  You get to re-live the events if you are familiar with the  history but if not, you simply get to live the drama as it unfolds  and it does not matter.

Make no mistake in that this film is not un-biased.  It is, as closely as possible, a reconstruction of Sennas own views of Formula One at the time he raced:  the politics, the money,  the rivalry with Prost, etc.  No doubt that while Prost might enjoy a right of reply, ex-FIA President Jean-Marie Balestre is a far greater villain,  cast as both dictatorial and openly-biased toward Prost.  If you have not guessed it, Ayrton Senna comes across as a  principled,  pure racer who is aggrieved to have to deal with the partisanship and unfairness at the top level of racing in contrast to the joys of  real racing which he had known during his early karting days in his native Brazil and maybe later in Formula Three.  Sennas spiritual faith in God translates into faith in himself, in his absolutely extraordinary talent, and in an almost divine right to be the winner, to be the champion as a result.  It is said in a way as if to suggest that the other drivers, because they lacked Sennas skill, did not have God on their side!  There is no doubt that Senna was supremely talented.  I  rate him as without peer among his contemporaries  Prost came the closest.  But he was an even  more complicated (and conflicted) individual than is understandably presented in this movie,  authorized by the Senna family who are intent on preserving his legacy.  In 1988, Senna was headed toward a  convincing win at Monaco when he lost concentration near the end and crashed his McLaren upon exiting Portier corner, handing victory to his teammate Prost.  The movie characterizes this race result as a bitter lesson (in overconfidence?)  from which Senna would learn.  Yet at Monza later that year (and NOT included in the movie), Senna was again leading the race comfortably in the final stages when he collided with back-marker Jean-Louis Schlesser.  Overconfidence or arrogance?  Senna is seen in an interview with Jackie Stewart in which Stewart legitimately asks him about the high rate of collisions in which he has been involved during his career and Senna is clearly annoyed, even irritated.  There is also no reference to Sennas post-race altercation with Eddie Irvine after the 1993 Japanese Grand Prix which did not reflect credit on either driver  Irvine for his driving while out on the track and Senna for losing his cool afterward.

For all of his legendary on-track ruthlessness toward other drivers, Senna would become personally very distraught when other drivers were injured or killed.  The movie shows him going to the scene of  Martin Donnellys testing accident at Jerez, brooding over the death of rookie Roland Ratzenberger at Imola, and one of the clips during the credits at the end shows Senna racing back across the track to see how Eric Comas is doing after a big crash in 1992.  Senna could then erase these scenes from his mind and summon the total concentration needed to go out and turn-in the scintillating lap needed for a Pole Position.

Sennas attachment to his native Brazil and the reasons for his enormous popularity back home  are conveyed through numerous scenes of him interacting with fans, appearing on TV talk shows, going back to his country to relax at home or on a boat with family and friends, or slowing down after a race win to get a Brazilian flag before proceeding on his victory lap.  His profound attachment to his country is genuine and his charity work to help educate poor children in Brazil began well before it became institutionalized as the Senna Foundation.

One of  Sennas  core strengths comes from the various dialogues which were selected by the film director to draw the viewer into the complicated relationship between Senna and Prost at McLaren.  At first, there is gentle bantering and camaraderie between them as the world watches in anticipation to see what will happen with the two top drivers paired in the same team.  As the on-track controversies mount, the rhetoric becomes more strained, the recriminations fly, and there follows a scene showing Prost brushing past Senna in the McLaren pits when the two are obviously no longer on speaking terms  an image now replaces words to sum up the new situation!

After the second Prost-Senna collision at Suzuka in 1990 which held World Driving Championship implications, the viewer is left to judge from both race footage and Sennas own comments the extent to which he either deliberately provoked the accident as revenge against Prost and the FIA for the ruling he had suffered the previous year, or whether he simply dove to make the pass, aware that any outcome would be a win-win situation for him.

Senna is foremost a drama about the conflicts and emotions surrounding the top drivers and the FIA during an amazing era of Formula One.  It is the human side of this story which makes the film so engrossing to even the non-race fan.  The story leaves the viewer conflicted at times and misty-eyed at others until its heart-wrenching finale.  For the race fan, however, the extraordinary and copious amounts of previously unseen race footage is the real treat!  First of all, the on-board camera is far superior to what we see in F1 coverage today because the in-car camera back then was mounted above the right-shoulder of the driver  truly giving an eye-level appreciation of what the driver sees as he negotiates some of the worlds toughest circuits.  In my book, nothing ever equaled the thrilling sequence of corners from Monacos Tabac going around the swimming pool  to La Rascasse in terms of sheer gripping, ragged-edge terror with the guardrails and concrete walls so close alongside.  The other amazing thing is the amount of previously unseen film drawn from pre-race FIA driver briefings and track-side conversations where one would never have suspected a camera was allowed.  Who would have thought that a camera and microphone might have captured one of the final pre-race conversations between McLaren Team principal Ron Dennis and Senna when it was already known Senna was leaving the team for Williams in1994?  Or the contentious arguments from within the pre-Suzuka driver meeting from which Senna walked-out?  One is led to wonder just how much more unpublished F1 footage Bernie Ecclestone is holding onto in his archives which might somehow alter the perceptions we have of racing during the modern era?

Ayrton Senna hated electronic gizmos  those technological drivers aids which began creeping into F1 racing in the early 1990s and which greatly helped the driver control his car.  He quite understandably resented anything which might help close the talent gap between great drivers like himself and less-skilled drivers.  Sennas comments about the 1992 season in this regard are on the mark and sadly prophetic.  While the FIA began legislating against artificial devices such as launch control, traction control, adjustable ride-heights, etc, it also became more difficult to police electronic innovation and the degree to which technology would allow cheating to take place.

 The period since Sennas death has seen Formula One racing increasingly turn into a show where entertainment which boosts TV ratings with the general public matters more than pure racing.  Grand Prix races became mini-sprints between refueling and tire-change pit stops whose purpose was perhaps to better display sponsor logos close-up while at a standstill on TV screens and to guarantee excitement by trying to keep the race order artificially tight and suspenseful right to the end.  After Sennas death, the FIA were quick to enact safety improvements but ironically, this subsequently took its toll on driving skill and finesse.  Acting perhaps with greater self-confidence that they would not get hurt, drivers became increasingly reckless and collisions, both accidental and deliberate, sadly became commonplace with no consistent system of arbitration in place to adjudicate penalties.  While the best drivers still usually found their way into the best teams,  the resource and technology gap between the big three (McLaren, Williams, and Ferrari) and the rest of the starting grid would lead to over twenty years of near-total domination of  F1 by these three marques.  Technology was fast-becoming far more important than the driver.  Unchecked aerodynamics rules and the concurrent lack of passing opportunities dulled the contest for many years along with the resurgence of  team orders which essentially guaranteed that great racing rivalries within a team such as Mansell-Piquet at Williams or Prost-Senna at McLaren would not be allowed to happen.  And of course, there was certainly no downturn in the level of political bickering at the top!  The transformation from motor sport to motor business was almost complete.  For many, the death of Ayrton Senna would also come to symbolize the end of what Senna himself had hoped to preserve and which he defined as real racing.",1424822400,,9810,5.003703703703704

4672619,5,B005F44X36,"I first heard about Ayrton Senna in the Guinness Book of World Records.  Most consecutive victories, fastest recorded speed--I don't remember what he was in there for, but he was my introduction to F1 racing.  I also remember reading about Senna's fatal crash--how could the best driver in the world die in a crash?

Senna is one of the most most moving, most human, most disturbing films I've seen in a long time.  I've just never seen anything like this movie.  The footage is up close and personal; the language is raw.  The press conferences, as you've always suspected, don't tell the real story.

The film chronicles Senna's life, his rivalry with Alain Proust, his impact on Brazil, and the chaotic events of his final season.  There's so much contrast in Senna's life: he's well-off, but from an extremely poor country.  He's a courageous driver, but is treated unfairly by the racing establishment.  Until, surprisingly, he isn't.  He's clearly a sex symbol, but hasn't settled down with anyone.  He's a symbol of hope and joy to Brazil, but he doesn't always handle adversity with grace.  He changes teams to get a better car, only for Formula 1 to change the rules--he ends up with a worse car than he had the year before.  He's a three-time World Champion, yet he feels like there's something more out there, that there's room for him to grow.  Senna was as human as they come.

Finally and chillingly, the film covers Senna's final race in extreme detail.  It shows a young Rubens Barrichello clearly in awe of Senna, then crashing during a practice lap.  It shows a 33-year-old driver, Roland Ratzenberger, crashing fatally during qualifying.  Senna is clearly upset, but has qualified in pole position, and starts the race the next day.  We find out that Senna had read the Bible that morning--the passage was about receiving the gift of God's presence.  At this point, in-car footage shows Senna's final laps.  We already know the outcome, but seeing it from Senna's point of view is almost like watching your own death--as close as you can possibly get without going there yourself.  At the final moment, the camera cuts away.

The end credits both show Senna's funeral, and at the same time, make you feel like you're at a _real_ funeral: there's a montage of family photographs and videos, all from Senna's pre-F1 days.  What might have been had Senna not raced at Imola?  Why didn't he just ""quit and go fishing,"" as the race doctor suggests?  Why, when there had been no fatal crashes in Formula 1 in decades, were there suddenly two on the same weekend?  What actually happened during Senna's fatal crash?  Was it simply coincidence and bad luck?  A faulty car?  Something preordained by fate?  The final scenes beg for resolution, but in life, sometimes you don't get it.",1423872000,4,2794,4.7803347280334725
4672620,5,B005F44X36,"First, thank you to a well-known online movie subscription site for offering this at one point otherwise I'd have not known a thing about it. I'd heard the name 'Senna' at different points through the years but knew basically nothing at all about F1 racing, the drivers, culture, etc. The first thing to grip you is the intro piece, it sets the documentary off and Antonio Pinto's soundtrack is extremely emotional. Just something about Ayrton's charisma hooked me like nobody I can remember. I couldn't imagine the emotions felt by the Brazilian people when this man was at the top and the bottom with the soundtrack perfectly conveying mood. I don't technically have a bucket list, but seeing his final resting place in Sao Paulo is now on it. I would also love to someday be able to see that, his memorial at Imola circuit, and the Monaco Grand Prix in recognizance of his mastery there.  This documentary chokes me up nearly every time at around 20 viewings in all. If heaven is real, I hope to someday meet him there.

I found myself growing to like Alain Prost quite a bit after much researching.  (Quoted from Wikipedia: ""Though it didn't make the film, Ayrton's message to him during the fateful weekend: ""We all miss you Alain"" and how touched he was about it.
Only a couple of days before his death, when filming an in-car lap of Imola for French television channel TF1, he greeted Prost, by then a pundit on the channel: ""A special hello to my,... to our dear friend Alain. We all miss you Alain."" Prost said that he was amazed and very touched by the comment.  I really admire Prost and he is also a well spoken man and legend.",1423440000,,1639,4.545762711864406

From racing go-karts to Formula 1, the film holds nothing back from a man completely committed to the sport. We witness the fed up and frustrated driver say his peace and walk out of a sanctions meeting, along with his often acrimonious relationship with rival Alain Prost--on and off the track. This is a rich and deeply moving motion picture that had the most macho among us in the audience in tears. The only shortcoming was the film ended without revealing that Prost and Senna resolved their conflicts and were best of friends at the time of his death. A filmmaker has only so much time to convey a story, and I am sympathetic to this oversight. However, it should be noted that one of the most heated, and intense rivalries in the history of Formula 1 was resolved after Prost retired. To wit, Prost was not only a pallbearer, but a member of the board of trustee's for the Ayton Senna Foundation, which lives on. This film is not to be missed.

Sure some of the footage is old and of much lower quality but that was the state of videography back in this 80s (GoPros weren't even a twinkle in the inventors eye :) ).  Despite being a documentary, it still has the 'feel' of a movie/story.  I also like how they put some scenes about Ayrton's philanthropy in the movie as well.

However, that said, I will agree with the Alain Prost interview that I have watched that this movie does paint a more bleak picture about Ayrton and Alain's relationship than was really the case.  It was a friendly rivalry with a lot of respect between the two but sure, there were a few bouts of argument/feud but I'd say that is healthy between a pair of incredible athletes competing against each other.

For those who just took the movies stance on Prost at face value, which made him seem like a jerk, hopefully he was redeemed when the text about him being a trustee for the Senna Foundation.",1414800000,4,1020,4.486486486486487

 I know how they double park on a two lane road to run into the markets to buy last minute food they forgot and they don't come back to their car for ten minutes because they know the owner of the mercato and they are having a cappuccino with them!! .

Why wait till they come back when the sidewalk is a perfect place to drive. No double parking and I just have to drive around the Italian's as they swear at me!!  Lots of hand gestures, I wonder what they mean?  Ha Ha!!

I really loved the movie and all the real footage of all the great F1 drivers at that time.

I didn't know that there were so many casualties in every season. Safety was not a priority from the promoter's and owner's of the companies that built the race cars and unfortunately many great F! drivers were killed on the track!!  It was to me a real eye opener for me.

Senna and Niki Lauder were the two drivers who really finally got more safety features on the tracks.

Unfortunately Senna crashed and died before they finally took safety seriously.

I loved the whole movie but I wasn't excepting to see them taking Senna's body out of the car.

""These things bring you to reality as to how fragile you are; at the same moment you are doing something that nobody else is able to do. The same moment that you are seen as the best, the fastest and somebody that cannot be touched, you are enormously fragile""

It doesn't matter a bit if you aren't an F1 fan or historian.  Ayrton Senna continues to inspire people in all walks of like to this day, that's why I give this a strong 5 star rating.",1405555200,,932,4.658536585365853

Senna was, arguably, one of the best, if not the best Formula One driver ever, based on his sheer talent and hard work. Amazing view of some politics going on in Formula One (if you can't beat the best, well you can bend the rules to disqualify him; see the film and draw your own conclusions). The documentary is very well put together and it has a rhythm, a flow to it, more like an action movie (Rush comes to mind) than a documentary.
It is a marvelous piece of cinematographic art, written very well, putting a very human face (with his triumphs and greatness, but also with his failures and errors) on one of the greatest champions.",1398729600,,772,4.4822695035460995

His McLaren car where he won 3 out of 4 titles.
How technology of Williams lured him into their car, and how the rules always were against him,
but he still managed to beat the odds until the last race in Imola in 1994!

4672712,5,B005F44X36,"I knew little about Senna before my brother requested this DVD for Xmas.  I love performance driving and F1, but don't follow it that closely.  I love the way the film captures the political hierarchy that existed in racing at the time, and how the drivers were often the last ones consulted regarding decisions and changes.  The final race footage is suspenseful and horrifying at the same time, since you knew it was the actual footage from his final race.  You come away feeling Senna's death didn't have to happen, although it did create a firestorm that helped make F1 safer going forward.",1391472000,,594,4.737864077669903

4672715,5,B005F44X36,"This is a challenging review to write because there are absolutely NO surprises. All of the publicity material tells us that Ayrton Senna was a three-time World Champion Formula One race-car driver who died at age 34 (""No fear. No limits. No equal.""). What else can a documentary tell us?

Three things stood out for me:
  1. Senna was from a well-to-do Brazilian family, so his storied career was well documented, from his trophy-winning go-kart days up to and including his death. His pit crew would hand him a Brazilian flag to wave during his victory lap, thus insuring his status as a beloved hero for millions of Brazilians.
  2. The arc of the relationship between Senna and his arch rival, Frenchman Alain Prost, also a three-time World Champion. These two highly competitive drivers started as rivals but became teammates. What happened after that, was unexpected.
  3. The problem the professional drivers had with bureaucratic oversight is also well documented. Racing officials arbitrarily removed many of the safety features from those high- performance cars over the drivers' strenuous objections. It took a martyr to prove their point.

It is clear why Senna was so popular in Brazil. Not only was he a proud citizen, but he contributed millions to the poor and was a handsome, well-behaved young man. His victories were a source of great pride to his countrymen and his charities insured his reputation as a generous, almost saintly national icon.

A Formula One driver has a camera mounted over his right shoulder, so we see the real thing! Be prepared for high-speed racetrack film clips, along with horrific crashes. I came out of the screening with great respect for a (to me) formerly unknown, fine young man. All Formula One fans should get this documentary; it's available from Amazon...",1391299200,2,1810,4.98671096345515
4672716,4,B005F44X36,"OK, so I must be the only F1 fan who is not and was not a Senna fan. Yes he was talented, but he was a ""dirty driver."" Sportsmanship meant nothing to him. That said, he is commendable in life for trying to do so much for Brazil's youngsters and his foundation continues to do so today. This is a very good documentary of that era in F1.",1391212800,,336,3.9558823529411766
4672717,5,B005F44X36,Many of us revered Senna as a driver.  This documentary gives you a much clearer picture of Senna the man.  He was complicated like most of us and we learn some of the reasons why.,1391126400,,180,4.114285714285714

4672719,5,B005F44X36,"I saw this film twice within a week when it first came out in theaters. The first time with my buddies. The second time with my wife who is not a racing fan. After seeing it, she has come to appreciate Formula One. I asked her to go because after watching it the first time, I realized that this is not just a racing film. It is a film about greatness. About what one man sacrificed to be great. About his passion. About his struggles. It could be about any sport, or goal in life. It just happens to take place around Formula One. And to top it off, the footage is unbelieveable.
My only complaint is the heavily biased portrayal of Alain Prost as the bad guy. I'm as great a fan of Senna as I am of Prost and found the films portrayal of ""The Professor"" very unfair. Despite this, I loved this film.

This is a fantastic movie about his life and his religious nature, which I found refreshing in these politically correct times. It shows his meteor-like rise through the ranks of the junior leagues and into F1.  He was an insane fast driver--especially in the rain. The race footage is outstanding. You get a feel for the Man, who he was, how he conducted himself on and off the track.  He was as romantic about the sport as he was for women---a real racing gentleman.  They don't make them like this anymore.  He wasn't fearless, he had faith in God and truly felt that angels were with him during several miraculous wins.

It also shows rules may be arbitrarily changed depending on how many points behind and what nationality the 2nd place driver is .

Was it worth the wait.  Definitely yes.

The documentary details the life of Ayrton Senna, from his early childhood days in carting up through his tremendous formula 1 career and his legendary battles with Alan Prost right through to his life ending crash during the San Marino Grand Prix in 1994.

I've now watched the documentary twice and will likely go back to it again in the future.

4672795,5,B005F44X36,"I've been a TV follower of F1 for many years, ever since I went to Brands Hatch to see Senna drive for Lotus in the 80s in the British Grand Prix; hence my initial interest in this film.

This is a gripping film, wonderful in concept since it uses only contemporary footage and commnentary. No doubt there could have been scores of interviews analysing Senna's talents and being lavish (justifiably) in their praise but that would have spoiled the concept and the flow. Naturally there would be many F1 geeks who would have liked to have seen in depth analysis of engineering, driving style, tactics, preparation of the various cars but in my view they are missing the point of this film. This is not a film about motor racing, it is to do with sporting talent, determination and personal values.

I would have liked to have heard more commentary from Murray Walker (who incidentally is the joint best sports commentator of all time, along with Bill McLaren) but I would have thought that Murray's sheer enthusiasm for all that he saw would have changed the calm and atmospheric tone of the film. It was good to hear James Hunt's praise for Senna. Sure, it would have been good to see additional scenes - the race at Donnington being near the top of the list. Perhaps there was not sufficient contemporary material available; that goes for the other scenes that other reviewers have listed. It would have been detrimental to add interviews and talking head pieces to camera to cover the gaps, since that would also have changed the feel of the film. As I said, this is not about F1, so did not need to include absolutely everything.

Highlights for me included the scenes from the drivers' briefings and the immediate aftermath of the 1991 Brazil GP. If you're not affected by those post-race scenes then you might as well stop watching the rest of the film. The geeks will have noticed that although the car was stuck in 6th gear, the soundtrack included a gear-change; this film is a work of art so I don't care.

It was touching to hear Senna speak of the purity of racing juxtaposed with most of F1 life - but then that's true of life generally probably. As to the build up during the Imola weekend; the selection of the scenes was phenominal. I agree as to the level of detail, it must have been tempting to go on at length as to why Senna was gesticulating at the safety car, the effects of cold tyres and ride-height, and so on.

A tremendous film, could only have been improved by at bit less ESPN and a bit more Murray Walker and James Hunt - and a couple of additional races if the footage had been available.",1371859200,,2619,4.5168776371308015

4672798,5,B005F44X36,"I have been watching this for the 4th time, and for me new details emerge with each viewing. The brilliance of his driving shines though - with - at the beginning of his F1 career, having a car that clearly was not a favorite and through sheer brilliant driving, on the verge of winning had it not been called short because of heavy rain.

The film takes you from his earliest go-kart days (from family movies), right up to the end. And in an interview towards the end of his life he is asked what driver he has faced impressed him the most, and his answer will surprise you.

The circumstances of his death - which is unanswered to this day, I had  researched a bit - one of 3 things - broken steering column, tires not heated enough after the previous cautionary lap, or a broken suspension piece - seeing the segment of his crash - and one thing I do know - with virtually all the greats who have died in this sport - it was a defect in the car - not his driving.

One had to believe, had he lived, if he would have eclipsed Juan Fangio's record.

One thing others have mentioned - the bitter rivalry between him & Prost and in surfing around the Net lately, I read that Prost was upset with the movie (he devotes a lot of time in the movie) - his complaint is that the director did not devote any time explaining that their rift was healed by the end of his life.

While it is true the movie does not have any footage showing this at the end we know that Prost was one of the pallbearers and he is a trustee to Ayrton's charity fund - so in my mind I know the rift was gone and they were friends.

It is a great movie on several levels - the human angle on his sheer determination and talent to get to the top, and a wonderful overview of ""The Circus"" for those who don't really follow formula 1.",1371254400,,1800,4.111111111111111

4672803,4,B005F44X36,"Senna is a 2010 documentary about the life and untimely death of Brazilian racecar driver Ayrton Senna. The film focuses on his Formula One career, from his debut in the 1984 Brazilian Grand Prix to his death at age 34 in the San Marino Grand Prix in 1994, with particular emphasis on his rivalry with fellow racer Alain Prost. As a compilation of archival racing footage and home video clips, the film is an example of Direct Cinema (Observational Mode). There is no voice-of-God narration, and the filmmakers are not seen or heard on camera. Yet while the film is comprised of actual footage, the filmmaker's editorial touch is evident in the way he uses the footage to tell the story.

The editor's influence is felt in such things as the way film clips are organized, the use of slow motion, shots that zoom in or flash back, and diegetic sound that is either brought to the foreground or muted to allow voiceovers to be emphasized. The melancholy music that accompanies even the opening credits of Senna portends the tragic ending to the life of this world-champion racer. It is an ending that racecar fans viewing the film already know, and the tension of knowing what is to come is palpable throughout the film. The soundtrack, at times melancholy and mournful, at other times tense and suspenseful, serves to contextualize events that would otherwise be exciting but not necessarily tragic. We know what is going to happen, and the soundtrack conveys the drama and tension that accompany that knowledge.

The soundtrack is the only non-diegetic sound in the film. All other sounds are diegetic, or intrinsic, to the scene - crowds cheering, people talking, airplanes flying overhead, and particularly the Formula One engines themselves, which emit a high-pitched howling sound unique to this type of racecar. It is a sound that builds excitement among the spectators, but contextually in this film, the engines sometimes sound like someone screaming and give a sense of foreboding. In one scene just before a crash, the soundtrack becomes a literary element, with dramatic crescendos and a slow drumbeat in the background sounding like a heartbeat.

Editorial choices are felt in the choices of footage that show zooming in, panning out, holding a shot, or giving us a bird's eye view. While all of these techniques were part of the original footage, the filmmaker made intentional choices about which segments to cull from the thousands of hours of original footage. He included bird's eye views of racetracks, which communicate power and omniscience. We, the viewers, know what is to come, and it gives us an uneasy feeling. It is a sense of power that we don't want.

The filmmaker uses many close-up shots of Senna's face, which creates intimacy with the subject; we come to know this man and care about him. There are numerous extreme close-ups while he is seated in his car with only the top half of his face exposed through his helmet. These shots are so close we can practically count his freckles. The camera lingers there and gives us a chance to imagine what he is feeling. The close-ups also convey intensity; we see the anxiety on Senna's face after computerized improvements were banned from the cars, and we see animosity in the face of Alain Prost, as the rivalry between the two drivers escalates. The filmmaker seems to have chosen the shots intentionally to play up the contention between the two drivers and to cast Prost in a negative light. The viewer wonders how many shots of a smiling Prost were left on the cutting table.

The onboard camera of a racecar traveling over 200 miles per hour gives the viewers a thrilling ride. We are at eye-level, seeing the road from the driver's perspective. Low-angle shots are used to record the winners accepting their trophies on the podium. We look up to them, they are our heroes. Slow motion is used for footage of Senna walking off the track at the end of a race, perhaps to show contrast or even to convey an emotional letdown after the breakneck speeds of the race. Slow motion is also used for the signing of autographs; Senna was beloved by his fans, and he gave back to them with unhurried attention.

We see Senna's fatal crash after a long-stretch of onboard camera footage from his car. We are racing with him. The climactic moment of the fatal crash sneaks up on us, as it would have on the driver. The scene is absent of gratuitous emotional pulls, such as a crescendo of music or dramatic cutaways to alarmed faces. The crash was unexpected, and the filmmaker allows it to be play out in a natural way. It is somehow more heartbreaking suddenly to see Senna's still figure slumped in the seat. The footage shows emergency personnel working on him; then it cuts away to the crew members viewing the scene on a television screen. This has the effect of creating emotional distance from the raw sight of the carnage.

At the end of the documentary, the filmmaker uses cross-cutting to good effect at Senna's funeral; the camera alternates rapidly from mourners walking by the casket to scenes of Senna interacting with them in life. The effect is to give a sense of the life - and death - of this individual. This is a compelling film with mesmerizing footage and an engaging back story. By his selection of footage, the director has chosen camera shots that portray the subject as a gifted racer, a popular hero, and a humble man. Though not unbiased, he has given us a rich portrayal of these aspects of Ayrton Senna in the format of an engrossing documentary film.",1370649600,4,5551,4.7580477673935615

4672812,5,B005F44X36,"This is every bit a documentary piece but it's setup in a 3-stage movie progression that it appears like an actual movie.  Basically you have the beginning in which Senna's early life is introduced and it sets up how there was reluctance from his family to have him continue racing into Formula One so already there is drama there that would build and continue onto his racing career.  Then there is the actual hardship he faced in Formula One in which there is a ""Bad Guy,"" if you will and Senna's character is tested.  Then there  are the scenes that build onto the end of piece and everything is done very nicely, from the never before seen footage's to the commentary by the selected people who knew him and were/are very knowledgeable with the sport of Formula One.  Senna was not just a race car driver.  He was a man, a God-fearing man, who lived his life through racing.  This is no different from a painter living and learning through his/her paintings or a musician playing in front of a crowd in a small bar just because of the desire for artistic expression.

4672825,5,B005F44X36,"I followed Ayrton's career since the beginning, he's my favorite driver.
Simply amazing, not without faults like all of us but inside an F1 car no one will come close.  Some of his qualifying runs and especially wet races were beyond belief.  I must admit, I'm a biased fan of Ayrton as a driver and human being and I enjoyed the documentary immensely, but you need not be a fan to appreciate the insights and politics of F1 racing presented in the movie, during his time.  His expressed contempt of Balestre, the F1 chief at the time,  the suspicions he had that the Benetton team was cheating and other relevant events are covered.

Not a lot of racing footage, but instead we get to see the man, not solely the driver.  I really liked it when we were taken back to his karting days and we also got to see him relax with family and friends.

If you're a fan, much of what is shown in the movie you already know but it's super nice to have it presented all in one shot in chronological order.  For those of you with a passing interest:  watch the movie, you'll not waist your time, it's a great account of Ayrton's short but truly remarkable life.",1362009600,,1148,4.352112676056338

In racing, nothing is promised. There are no guarantees. There are ups and downs. I used to run track and was able to relate in some way. I was touched by his life and the man that he was. It ended in a sad way but I wasn't too sad because that is how life is. It's unpredictable and just because you expect things to happen, doesn't mean they will happen.

4672865,5,B005F44X36,"Senna was more than a man. He was the last of a group of race car drivers who raced in its purest sense. This movie tells the Formula One career of a driver in a way only Ayrton Senna could be attempted to be encapsulated: Through those that were there.

Coming up through the ranks of a gokart racer, Senna made it quite clear that he set his sights for Formula One. He broke into a brotherhood that seemed to be weary of outsiders (those from outside of Europe). Senna called ranking officals out in public on their handlings of situations. One can only hope that Senna made Formula One a better sport because of his presence.

He was a purist driver. He believed in racing like this because of his gokart background which he stated was about as racing as it could get. Gokarting had no politics, no electronics, nothing but pure racing. He pulled that approach into Formula One and stood out immediately. He showed the world how to race the most advanced cars in the rain. Because of his purist approach, he rubbed many people the wrong way.

Sometimes Senna was conflicted. His legendary battles with one-time teammate and rival Alain Prost exposed a personality that perhaps Senna would regret. He dabbled in the affairs of European racers and struggled with impure approach to racing. His call for purity included the safety for drivers. He was the voice of drivers who seemingly were afraid to speak up to the directors of FIA. Senna was more than happy to express his displeasure.

It is interesting to note that as Formula One was ushering in an electronic age, Senna would lose his life in a car provided by a team that began the new age. It was in the Williams at Imola (a weekend that in retrospect could have been warning the world) on lap six that Senna left the world. One can only feel a sense of loss watching the weekend at Imola as well as the on-board camera as we, the viewer, ride along with Ayrton on that fateful lap with Schumacher following on his wing.

He raced at the end of an inspirational era. Race cars were no longer ground-breaking. They were only being corralled. Instead of innovation, cars were only being limited. As stated before, hopefully Senna's existance in FIA brought about some change. Formula One has not (to date) had a fatality since. One can only hope that it was Senna's sacrifice that prevented many other deaths in the spirit of motor sports. Whether you agree with motor sports or not, this film is a fantastic view into a man who only wanted the playing field to be fair in a time when it was the farthest from. To hear the constant comments from Brazilians who repeated, ""He is the only good thing in our country"" showed that Senna was more than a man, more than a driver, more than a three-time World Champion - he was a god dabbling among mere mortals.

One interesting note about Senna's death: Under Italian law, any time a driver is pronounced dead on a race track, the race is to be stopped and a full investigation is to be conducted. With this in mind, the Italian authorities stated that Senna was pronounced dead during the helicopter flight to the hospital, thus circumnavigating the law. The interesting part about this is the doctor stated that Senna, ""sighed...as if that was the moment his soul left his body."" It seems as if the doctor knew that Senna was dead at the scene. Even in death Senna earned very little respect from European directors in Formula One.",1354147200,5,3434,4.5575364667747165

I became a F1-Fan long years after Senna, at a time when M Schuhmacher dominated the scene. I was always intrigued by the precision, the pushing of limits, the passion but also the shear international impact F1-Racing had.

The movie shows wonderfully the progress F1-Racing made in the 80 and 90th - a sport of kings. It shows the competitive nature of the race car drivers, and the limits / demons they are facing.

The movie could serve in multiple ways: ... love for the Brazilian people, love for competitive sports, for passion, ... but also as a reminder that true sportsman-ship should always depend on human abilities and not on technical gimmicks, while the gimmicks should be used to improve safety. And, on that note: ... there were clear warning signs which SENNA ignored, and which potentially cost him his life.

It's tough to find a balance between strive for victory, and control of risks involved.

A much more complex movie / documentary than it intended to be. ...  AN AMAZING MOVIE ...",1347580800,,1184,4.641148325358851
4672880,5,B005F44X36,"I was an F1 fan since I was in college in the 60s and followed to F1 circus through the 90s. I have attended many F1 races in the US and Canada. One of the aspects that attracted me to this form of racing was the great variety of characters you found there - James Hunt and the Teddy Bear team, the suave Graham Hill, the fiery Rodriquez brothers, etc., etc.

One who I respected because of his incredible driving ability was Ayrton Senna. I watched the drama of his first great F1 race at Monte Carlo on TV. I could not believe that this new driver was so incredibly fast and fearless as he reeled in Alain Prost and was destined to triumph in bad rainy conditions until politics overcame the natural process and the race was stopped handing the victory to Prost.

Senna was a figure in racing that was misunderstood by me and many others. He was often depicted as a prima donna and someone that insisted on getting his way all the time. This movie showed the other side of the story and revealed the human being that he was. One might assume that the story may have been slanted to his favor. However as all the content came from actual newsreel and television footage, it seems hard to dispute that this probably reveals more of the truth than we have had before.

Already knowing the details of the story being told did not prepare me for the impact that it had on me. Nothing seemed to be hidden from the viewer including the tragic scenes of the racing shunts. When the movie ended I sat staring at the screen trying to comprehend and deal with what I had just seen. I will never forget this film and plan to see it again very soon.

The actual video footage of Ayrton Senna, both personal and professional, is heart-wrenching and the film is so well constructed that it becomes much more than just a story about a Formula 1 driver.  It's a story of a gifted but humble man, who had faith and persevered against all odds to accomplish extraordinary things.  He was devoted to his family and his country and they were devoted to him.  He was brilliant, charismatic, and passionate about his sport.  Asif Kapadia has created a truly stunning documentary about a truly extraordinary man.

4672885,4,B005F44X36,"Really, there should be nothing wrong with this film, in fact there is not but I did find it unfortunate that 2 major highllights to give the uninformed viewer complete understanding of the brilliance of this man would want to see, were sadly not mentioned. First, while shown in the finishing credits, nothing in the film shows the heroism of Senna more than when he rushed to the crashed car of Erik Comas during qualifying for the 1992 Belgium Grand Prix in Spa. Comas crashed in front of Senna who, by his weaving clear of the carnage stopped his McLaren and ran to cut the engine of Comas' car. Senna stayed on the scene, in fact many other cars continued past without stopping, while tending to the driver until medics, notably Prof. Sid Watkins could get there. Second, the famed driving dominance of Senna (in the rain of course) during the 1993 European Grand Prix in Donington Park, UK. What could illustrate better the incredible talent of Senna than his drive in those torrential conditions that day than that? He was driving the underperforming McLaren-Ford racing the dominant Williams-Renault combination of Hill/Prost to sheer brilliance, winning the race by lapping the complete field except the second place Williams of Damon Hill who incidently Senna finished more than 1 minute in front of. While I can undertand the editing process, these two notable rememberances can be found for the viewer on YouTube should they want to watch. My last comment is I found the subtitles difficult to read for some reason but really the film is the best there is right now on who was clearly the greatest.",1346371200,,1610,4.815884476534296

The producers of this movie have done such a superb job putting old footages of Senna together that you forget this documentary was made in 2010, some ten years after Senna's death. It is a very emotional, touching story about a superb driver with certain beliefs. The interviews at the end of the DVD are a testimony to the unique story and existence of an individual by the name of Senna even after his death. Although this is about Senna in F1, the reality is that it is about Senna, the human being in F1, not F1. A must see production. Unbelievable, emotional, gripping true story.

4672889,5,B005F44X36,"While an overwhelming feeling of sadness is the ultimate result of watching this well produced film,  a sense of outrage is nearly as great.  Not only was Senna treated very unfairly by the F1 powers in large part because he was not European, the Williams team knew well that their revised car was very unbalanced and essentially a deathtrap.  What is not mentioned in the film are the criminal charges brought against the Williams team as a result of the crash.

While never ""officially"" proven, the crash that killed Senna likely occured when the steering column broke.  The Williams team had moved the steering column on Senna's request but did a very poor welding job and there was much evidence it fractured prior to the crash which explains why there was no steering correction applied before impact.  Why this part was left out by the film makers can only be explained by the fact that they were British and the Williams team was British.  Many think that Frank Williams was essentially responsible for Senna's death.

I would have hoped for better archival footage both in camera and out from his later years but their is nothing remotely HD about this film.  It is a powerful movie in laying out what we know is inevitable.  It is only too bad that it does not tell the whole story.  BTW,  Alain Prost, who was largely and understandably to some degree, vilified in the film, was invited to the funeral and continues to be a trustee of the Senna foundation.

A very good movie that could have been a great movie.  You should by all means see it and then research what was not included for yourself.",1345507200,2,1607,4.612676056338028

4672896,5,B005F44X36,"This outstanding bio-pic about the life of three-times Formula One World Champion Ayrton Senna is an exemplary textbook study in documentary film-making. Regardless of whether or not you have any interest in motor racing or in Senna himself, this film really is one of the finest-ever examples of the genre you're ever likely to see.

All F1 fans know that Senna (full name Ayrton Senna de Silva) died on 1st May 1994 following a fatal crash in the Italian Grand Prix at San Morino, the last driver (to date, August 2012) to die in a F1 racing accident. The film pieces together archive footage tracing early life and go-karting success, obsession with driving and winning and later days of international super-stardom of this most talented and fearless driver. His career-long rivalry with cool-as-ice French driver Alain Prost is revealed in a direct and no-holds barred narrative containing some astounding unguarded, off-the-record moments of interaction between these two individuals of contrasting (and clashing) temperaments.

Senna's unique driving talent and personal modesty, the enormous impact his success had on popular sentiment in Brazil, his heartfelt religious convictions and the work and money he dedicated to the education of under-privileged children in his native land are all revealed. On the way we are shown rare peeks into confrontations at F1 pre-race drivers' meetings, and some of the F1 engineering innovations which made their way into mass-production vehicles - like traction control for example.

Overall this is a gripping, well-paced film which holds the attention throughout with never a dull moment. The choice to forego a voiceover-narrator and allow the archive film to speak for itself makes the film's impact on the viewer  all the more powerful. Some of the driver's-eye-from-the-car camera-work during F1 races is genuinely edge-of-the-seat terrifying, and allows you to appreciate just what phenomenal speeds were and are involved.

If you appreciate good film-making with fine editing, regardless of the subject matter, you really should see this. If you are a student of film or aspiring film-maker then seeing and studying `Senna' - several times, not just once - is a must, and if you're a F1 fan you are gonna love it.

The in-car sounds and views are outstanding, hair raising.  The candid shots and interviews are even more remarkable.

4672931,4,B005F44X36,"Get out your flamethrowers, Senna fans. I just watched this documentary, and after all they build-up, I've come away a bit disappointed. I can't jump blindly on the five-star wagon. Some background:  I got hooked on F1 while watching Mario race a Lotus in the Long Beach GP. I've attended a few F1 races, along with watching them religiously when they were live on ESPN, and now on Speed. Also have done a bit of road racing in my 72 Datsun 510 painted like a BRE car; point being I'm not an expert or a wanker, but somewhere in between. I remember the race in Monoco when they called it due to rain, and thought at the time these Senna and Bellof (no mention of him in the documentary) guys were going to be great.
The good:
-Had forgotten the details of the 1st wreck with Prost, and now have to agree that Senna got a bad deal, but also think he made up for it the next year by taking out Prost.  So, call that one even.
-Some of the early shots of karting and personal interviews are great - gives you an insight into the man's thought process
-Although probably unintended by the documentary, I though it showed Prost to be the better man (maybe not the racer) in that he did not seem to make the rivalry personal, and was big enough to be a pallbearer.
-Was not aware how deep his love of country and the less fortunate - that was touching

The not so good:
-It downplays the skills of his nemesis, Prost - they were both great drivers, just went about it differently
-The documentary also fails to present anything that would show Senna in a bad light - no mention of his aggressive driving that at times was reckless. In fact, hardly anything negative is said, which is required to present a true picture of the man.
-Not enough in-car stuff for me; expected more. Perhaps that's my racing bias.
-Complaints about politics in F1 - that's been going on for years, so just deal with it.

In closing, I plan to watch the film at least two more times, so my opinions after the initial pass may change.
An F1 documentary I would recommend is ""Jackie Stewart - The Flying Scot"" available on Amazon.  It's fair to say that Jackie created the modern F1 driver image, and had the skills to back it up. He came from humble beginnings, both personally and professionally. I really enjoyed the shots of him with Ken Tyrrell at the old garage, and the fade-in sequence of him driving the car again at Monaco years later over top the original race.",1331769600,6,2442,4.370044052863436

The AMERICAN version was released March 6, and while there is still some Portuguese dialog with English subtitles, 90% is in English. In fact, at least 90% of Senna's own dialog is in English!

I've read where the Senna family is approached multiple times a year by one screenwriter, producer, director or another about making a film based on Ayrton Senna, his life, and his career.  This film has emasculated any efforts of interested parties in producing a film on Senna for at least the next five years.  Kapadia's Senna is a wonderful story magically produced through the use of archival footage.  Having been only a slightly passive observer of auto racing since the early 1990s, I was not too familiar with Ayrton Senna and as I set out to see this film for the first time, I was unaware of the ending and what was in store for me emotionally.  This story is woven into three distinct acts that move smoothly from one scene to the next and, quite honestly, I cannot see how a feature-length film with high budget actors and directors could have done a better job in the telling of this story. As the film progressed, I went from curious interest to immersion into excitement, joy, frustration, and, finally dread as I suddenly pieced together what I was about to see as the film awakened my memory of what I thought was coming.  The ending is particularly powerful as we see the highest of the highs and lowest of the lows brought together with the starkest contrast I can imagine.  The musical score is fantastic; a perfect fit for the movie.  This film is not only for Formula 1 fans, it's not only for auto racing fans, it's a film for anyone who enjoys good storytelling about a personality that Hollywood could only imagine as real and could probably never, ever, capture the essence of who Senna was and what he meant to his countrymen through the use of actors.  The DVD (non Blu-Ray) has special features which include short family videos, commentary, and interviews not used in the film.  Be aware, however, the non-english commentaries DO NOT have subtitles so you should brush up on your Italian or Portuguese.  The Blu-Ray version, I am told, has many more minutes of extra footage not used in the film.  I'm buying that and giving my standard DVD copy as a gift.",1331424000,9,2257,4.587064676616915

During the mid 80's until '93, I preferred Prost and Mansell but always respected Senna. I have always been surprised at how distraught I was watching that crash.  Berger had a massive shunt and was trapped for 16 seconds in a huge ball of flame at Tamburello in '89 and he missed just one race. Senna had a relatively tame shunt at the same corner and died.  Senna the movie demands a visceral reaction just as the man himself did. (Does anybody know when the blu-ray for region A {North America} will be released?)",1327881600,,614,4.368421052631579

He made racing interesting in an era when defensive driving to slow and beat better drivers was the norm. He RACED!

The film brought much to the table including home movies and private moments about Senna's life that gave a great insight into him as a competitor on the track and a man who cared deeply for his country and the children who live there.  These children  needed a chance at a better life and Senna fought tirelessly for them despite coming from a rich background himself.  His charities are active and strong to this day and have helped countless children get a shot at a better life.

As a professional video editor myself, I found this to be an astonishing feat the likes of which I've never really seen before. There are no overarching VO helping us to understand the political nuances or emotional tension in a scene and no cuts to interviews that interpret or reinterpret the scenes.

4672950,4,B005F44X36,"""Senna"" is a documentary about Brazilian, three-time World Champion Formula One driver, Ayrton Senna. Many feel he is the greatest F1 driver of all time. Known for a swashbuckling, spiritually possessed, maverick style of driving, Senna earned the top pole position in Formula One races more times than any other driver in the history of the sport. He was a Brazilian national hero, at a time his country desperately needed one. Fans from Japan to Mexico revered this driving sensation, and would fill the stands to see him- until an early, tragic death ended his career and life in 1994.

This 2010 documentary from Asif Kapadia is a brilliant tribute to not only a sports hero, but also a truly (I would go so far as to say) messianic man. Full of restored family videos, sport television coverage, and interviews from friends and experts- this film is well-paced, visually and audibly pleasing. Crafted to inspire, this film succeeds on all fronts.

Senna was born into a prominent and wealthy family on the outskirts of Sao Paulo, Brazil, the da Silva's (Ayrton was born Ayrton Senna da Silva, but dropped da Silva later in his life, due to the name being so common throughout Brazil. Senna is his mother's maiden name). Far from feeling entitled because of his wealth and privilege, Senna never wanted special advantages. He had a calling in life, and pursued it with tireless hunger.

According to his mother, it was clear Senna wanted to be a racecar driver at a very young age. Ayrton's father made his son his first go-cart at the age of four. As the documentary notes, Senna would work hard in class to get all his schoolwork done before he had to return home, so that when he got home he could work on his driving.

At age twenty-one, Senna moved to Europe to pursue his career as a driver- first, in single-seater racing. By age twenty-two, Senna began his career in the Formula circuit. This was only after Senna questioned his career as a driver, and contemplated going back home to Brazil work in the family business, at his mother's coaxing.

A lot was going on in Senna's personal life at this time (he had a failed marriage to a woman he grew up with in Brazil, and who he had known his whole life). Tellingly, as Senna was pursuing a career as a driver in his early twenties, he refused financial support from his parents. He wanted to go at it alone. His wife, it is presumed, wanted to live in Brazil, or at very least did not share his driving ambitions. This is important to the Senna story: driving was not the easy path in his life.

Senna gets his first break into the Formula One world with the Toleman team in 1984. But it was with the Lotus team in 1985-87 that a true star starts to emerge. It is beginning in 1984 that this documentary really catches its stride, and that the film's rather quick flyby of Senna's personal life, and some aspects of his youth, makes sense in the context of this film's larger ambitions.

With Senna's rise to fame, a spiritual, ethical, ambitious, and humble gentleman emerges on screen. One thinks of recent debacles of other world champion athletes, and the imperfect ways that they have handled their fame, and this only makes Senna's humility in the face of his greatness all the more amazing.

As a Frank Williams quote in the documentary notes, Senna was a far greater man than he was a driver on the track.

The quilt of interviews that Kapadia strings together in this film, from Senna and his peers, makes this man's greatness clear. Senna felt, rightly or wrongly, that he had a higher calling. His focus was unparalleled. My favorite interview was one in which Senna was talking about how if his learning curve ever flattened out in racing, he would walk away. He was obsessed with self-improvement. When Senna had a large lead, despite the point implications, he simply could not take his foot off the gas. He was driven by perfection, wanted to get closer to God through his talents and belief.

This, at least in his mind, he achieved. He inspired seas of people. He lived a principled life. Thankfully, Senna's family has finally opened their vault of memories and videos to a gifted filmmaker, some sixteen years after the death of their son, to allow for this wonderful, touching, and inspiring documentary.",1325462400,15,4287,4.658730158730159

4672958,5,B005F44X36,"This biographical documentary is profoundly great on multiple levels.

We learn something about racing, but more importantly we get a real sense of what kind of man Senna was: intelligent, reflective, articulate, and humble, but also very ambitious.  He couldn't be truly happy unless he achieved all that he knew he was capable of, compelled almost against his will to self-actualize - unfortunately in a sport where the penalty for small mistakes could be grave.

We also learn about Senna's connection to other people, especially the people of Brazil, who were badly struggling at the time and needed someone like Senna as evidence that their country was capable of greatness and had hope.

I found this documentary to be beautifully crafted and deeply moving, though of course also deeply saddening at the end.",1324252800,5,814,5.097744360902255
4672959,5,B005F44X36,"During the last year of my undergraduate college, sitting in a small room I watched the horror at Imola with my devastated room-mate. I had no clue about Formula One, still do not and will never will care about it. Ayrton Senna had just crashed his car and this accident was fatal.
Senna was an inspiration and certainly one of the most influential racing driver of all time. This documentary follows his early-years, his success, his rivalry with Alain Prost and reaches the moving climax at Imola. The funeral in Brazil had me teary eyed. It is rare that a documentary can move you so much, especially if you had no knowledge of the subject matter. Truly a serendipitous find. Senna is a terrific film, which will no doubt move you. Full marks to Asif Kapadia the director and his script writer Manish Panday for researching archives and putting together such a fine portrait.

4672962,1,B005F44X36,"This is a criminally poor attempt to document the career of a gifted driver. Both the format and content of the movie are far, far short of what you might expect, especially since F1 is inherently a richly complex, suspenseful sport.

First, the format: We're all used to fine documentaries produced by National Geographic, The Discovery Channel, and myriad other sources. ""Senna"" begins with archival footage and a voiceover with several people discussing the assembly of the information. Every so often, there's a comment about the man himself. Then the neutral commentary returns, and you'll be convinced that you're watching a preview on ""The Making of Senna"", especially since one of the voices keeps referring to material that is or is not included in the final cut. After 20 minutes of this swill, you'll drop back to check the DVD menu, because you've apparently been watching the ""bonus"" material. But when you check the list of scenes, it dawns on you that this IS the movie! This IS what passes for professional production and direction! And...it...never...changes...for...100...minutes. There's no true structure, no professional engineering, and when it's over, you're left knowing very little about a very special person.

And the content: What content? Nothing about the machines, nothing about race strategies, nothing that sets a scene, especially since F1 is contested all over the world in some very cool locations. Watching this, you start to believe that there's Monte Carlo here, and a gray rest-of-the-world over there. Bernie Ecclestone may have granted the ""filmmakers"" extensive access to the F1 archives, but that didn't keep these dolts from insulting Senna's memory with a hokey, gray little piece of home video.

Don't buy it.",1323734400,4,1756,5.241992882562277
4672963,5,B005F44X36,"I was amazed to see a 3-star average for this excellent film here, but then saw it was all about Am selling the wrong region disc. Well fear thee not, as this is the right, English-language version, and it is excellent.

I knew next to nothing about Senna going in, and am glad I didn't. This is such a crisp introduction to and summation of his life. The best bits again and again are his interviews. This man had found true inner peace at 200 miles an hour. His emphasis on karting as a more pure sport than F1 is revealing; just wait until Bernie Ecclestone gets his mitts on it!

The film builds beautifully and is always entertaining. Senna's life played out like a Hollywood script in reality, so it was tailor-made for a doc like this. He was a strong character and the best at what he did, and he's done justice by this movie. The extras are decent, especially the home movies, and are bound to please any serious Senna devotee, but for me the movie was the true revelation, as it uses the documentary form to truly dramatic impact.

Highly recommended...especially this version!

4672966,5,B005F44X36,"I don't particularly like Formula One yet was gripped by this documentary which is just as much about probing the psychology of Brazilian driver Ayrton Senna as it is about his championship winning drives. The family cooperated with the film maker so we see plenty of valuable early home footage of the young go kart driver who gradually works his way up through the racing world and then starts winning races. He slowly became involved in an ever nastier rivalry with the cool professorial Alain Prost of France, who was a very different and much more reserved man. Senna looks more and more stressed as the years go by and despite three championship titles, he changes teams when it appears he has a better chance of winning elsewhere. But the rules change and the car he thought would bring more victories turns out to be highly unpredictable. He is visibly broken up when a young driver is killed during practice for the Italian grand prix in 1994 and yet decides to take part in the race proper the next day.

The end of the film is so tense you can barely look at the screen. You know Senna is about to be killed in a crash and it takes a few seconds for it to sink in that you are looking at the video from his car and seeing what he saw. Senna takes bend after bend and accelerates into the straits and you know he will be dead in just a few seconds. Suddenly the car seems to slip out of control and then there is the shuddering impact and the screen goes black. I don't think I breathed much that last minute. The documentary is also good at highlighting Senna's importance to the morale of people in Brazil, who otherwise were having a very tough time.

Highly recommended.",1320019200,49,1684,4.429032258064516
4672967,4,B005F44X36,"There are documentaries and then there are documentaries, Senna is the latter.  It is no less than any gripping movie and keeping F1 in mind, very fast paced.  The nature of F1 requires the driver to be out of the ordinary with a degree of stubbornness, some luck and a lot of skill and like all F1 champions Senna had all of these qualities.  My personal interest in F1 started in the era of Shumacher and his utter dominance.  Although some of his acts may cast doubt on Shumacher's level of fairness to the sport but he will also remain one of the great drivers in the history of motorsport and there obviously are a handful of others.  But after watching Senna and irregularly reading about him on the net this movie has revived his greatness particularly for all those who have interest in F1.  The movie tells you that Senna was 'speed' at a time when technology and safety features were going through a transition in F1.

The research conducted to get the material and put it together in the right chronological order is praiseworthy.  His death played a key role in taking his level many notches up but it does not mean that he was not a great driver.  He was a storm in F1 which came, saw and conquered like Alexander.  The movie is worth watching and thoroughly entertaining.",1319932800,8,1285,4.5

The viewer is treated to extensive interviews and footage of Senna. This is also complemented by detailed reflections of his life and career from family, friends, team mates, and numerous identities from the F1 racing fraternity.

They read like the translation from Chinese for a cheap electronic device, and are a terrible distraction.  When the voice over is in English, one can see how far off base the subtitles are.  I hope that there is a better subtitled version forthcoming.

As for the film itself, I was disappointed.  I didn't follow Formula 1 during Senna's time, but have watched clips of his career and read of him on-line.  The film didn't show me anything that a few hours on You Tube hadn't shown me already. You Tube clips had shown me that he was fast, had an intense rivalry with Alain Prost, etc.  SPOILER? Although the film puts a lot of energy into setting up his fatal accident as the film's climax (e.g., plenty of that motor racing photo journalism cliche, the driver's haunted eyes as seen through the eye port of his helmet), the accident is almost completely unexplored.

I found the shorter version wonderfully unfolded the story af Ayrton Senna life and carefully told/structured the way his life/career developed. Although I knew a fair bit about him I didn't reliaze the extent of his good work he untertook for his country and its people. His story on the track and his rivalry with Alain Prost was legend at the time and is pure theatre in retrospect. As someone else notes you get the sense he knew the equipment he was driving was quite likely to cause his death or serious injury - that weekend at Imola was a landmark for F1 and in credit to the sport they took on extensive changes after that race to ensure driver safety became a priority. His was the last death in F1 - 17+ years ago. It was not just Senna death but the extent of other crashs, death and injury at that meeting that changed F1 for the positive.

I highly recommend this film, its very well crafted and I am surpised I have not heard more of it. This man won 41 times in 161 starts, he held pole position 65 times and won the world championship 3 times. If you watch F1 try to see this film or at least watch the 1984 Monaco GP - Senna's win still sends chills up my spine - what a racer he was and this films tells us he left a legacy of honour, compassion and a credit to his Country.
