Click the above blue-links for further details. ""The Return..."" is NOT a reunion movie/episode.
It IS a collection of documentaries/interviews with surviving cast members, and, heirs... with
other tidbits thrown in; such as the dog that became BENJI, and a music video by ""the 3 Jo's"".
""...lots of curves---you BET---even m-o-r-e when you GET...to the junction; Petticoat Junction.""

The first two seasons are in luxurious Black and White. Season Three beigins the era of COLOR...
the blonde,
the brunette,
and, my favorite,
the redhead... and, yes! I prefer Mary Ann to Ginger.

8633112,5,B00HJQM9ZM,"Probably the best rural-based sitcom ever created by producer Paul Henning following the success of his first series The Beverly Hillbillies. This was one of my favorite 60s sitcoms of all time but as a kid I never saw the first two seasons, which were in black and white, in rerun syndications only the color episodes from seasons three through seven. Yet it wasn't until my early 30s I finally witnessed the first the black and white episodes on TV Land in 1996 and I'm so lucky to have these two seasons together in a 2-pack collection. Oddly enough I first saw the series Petticoat Junction as a kid back when my family had a black and white set[We didn't have a color set until the spring of 1971].
This series became a vehicle starring Bea Benaderet upon being cast by Paul Henning after previously casting her in a recurring role as Cousin Pearl Bodine in The Beverly Hillbillies in its first season['62/''63]. Believe it or not she was originally going to be cast as Granny but that role of course went to Irene Ryan. At that time and even during the first season of Petticoat Junction, Bea Benaderet was the original voice of Betty Rubble on The Flintstones, then won TV audiences over as the owner of the Shady Rest Hotel Kate Bradley in the series' lead character. Rounding out the cast is Edgar Buchanan as the hotel proprietor Uncle Joe Carson; Frank Cady as Sam Drucker who owns the general store where Kate gets her supplies for the hotel; Smiley Burnette who plays Charlie Pratt operator of the Hooterville Cannonball owned by C&FW Railroad Co. and is assisted by conductor Floyd Smoot played by Rufe Davis who both help Kate transport her between the towns of Hooterville[Location of The Shady Rest] and Pixley along with Kate's daughters each named after Uncle Joe-Billie Jo, the flirtatious blonde bombshell(Jeannine Riley); Bobbie Jo, the brunette bookworm(Pat Woodell) and Betty Jo, the auburn-haired tomboy(Linda Kaye Henning), who also helps Charley operate the Cannonball during after school hours. That lovable dog Higgins, who was just called ""Dog"", didn't arrive until season two and provided some comic relief then on. Making constant recurring roles are Roy Roberts as Norman Curtis, president of the C & FW Railroad and Charles Lane as Homer Bedloe, the mean vice-president who is highly determined to scrap the Hooterville Cannonball and its service as well as the Shady Rest down to nothing.
Making notable guest appearances during these first two seasons are Ken Osmond[Leave It To Beaver], Adam West[Batman], Rosemary DeCamp[That Girl], Sheila James[Dobie Gillis]-who appears in the Beatles-inspired episode ""The Ladybugs"" as the fourth member of the group along with the three Bradley girls(They even appeared as The Ladybugs on The Ed Sullivan Show for the episode's teaser doing ""I Saw Him Standing There""), Dennis Hopper in the episode ""Bobbie Jo And The Beatnik"", Hayden Roarke[I Dream Of Jeannie], Everett Sloane[Citizen Kane], Elena Verdugo[Marcus Welby, M.D.] and Reginald Gardiner[The Flying Deuces] to name a few.
Always enjoyable to view these shows on my trusty Sylvania DVD player which is better than what's on today. I can definitely identify with this series being the fact that I had born during that very first season of that show[That's no pun intended during that time of the year]. In fact I was born three days short of the airing of episode three come to think of it. Not to be an old school baby-boomer here but these old series actually meant something. I always get a kick out of the line Uncle Joe used when people disagreed with him-""You're Pathetic!"". Plus he always tried his get-rich-quick schemes much to the dismay of Kate and the girls and other people in Hooterville(That's Uncle Joe who's moving kinda slow at The Junction).
If you love this series honor its rural flavor and come ride the little train going around the tracks at the junction. Petticoooat Junction!",1517270400,,3935,4.9366515837104075

8633114,3,B00HJQM9ZM,"I ordered the above described Petticoat Junction seasons 1 & 2 as a Christmas present. Instead I was sent season 1 and a Penn&Teller DVD. We don't like Penn&Teller. I've never had this problem with Amazon before. I'm very disappointed, as is the person I bought it for.  :(",1514592000,,273,4.571428571428571
8633115,3,B00HJQM9ZM,"Three stars for Season One, and none for the season that I didn't get (Season Two).  Some other garbage DVD was substituted for what I was supposed to get.

I suggest others not purchase this double set or you may also end up with Penn and Teller's DVD which I threw out and reordered Season Two.  It isn't worth the hassle of sending back since the cost isn't much.  Also if I sent the unopened package I might get another wrong DVD.  This is the first time this has happened to me so I guess I'm luckier than others.

Now I need to change some pending orders that are also double sets.  Obviously somebody at Amazon isn't paying attention when packaging these.",1509667200,,662,4.377049180327869

 I was surprised that most all of the stories were very entertaining! I had not seen since a child, 12 years old or so, but sure remembered the cute theme song!
We absolutely fell in love with these characters and wish we could watch the early type seasons forever, of such simpler and sweeter days.
Again, ya hear a lot, but nothing like that today, sadly.  When will Hollywood get it!",1492041600,,454,4.380952380952381
