8359569,4,B002AK7SB2,"The movie's less entertaining than the other Passolini films.i thing it was too long and the storyline is quite confusing. It was still a shocking film from a controversial director,i suggest you buy his other films.",1462147200,,216,5.027777777777778

8359573,2,B002AK7SB2,"The rich and varied ""The Thousand and One Nights"", also known as ""The Arabian Nights"", came to us from what is presumed to be the original version, dating from Egypt in the eighth century.  It has been parodied by the story tellers of campfires, royal courts and cafs, it has been written and rewritten and often translated.  Presumibly a French translation of the seventeenth century guided Richard Francis Burton in his monumental British edition of the nineteenth century, but every telling is a retelling and the various chapters cover every known editorial, literary or journalistic ploy.  A study of any available text amounts to an advanced course in creative writing, film script, interview, biography, narrative.  No film school, TV script team or creative writing course should be without a copy.  The filming, therefore, of this version is highly personal, eminently selective, and conforms to the taste and parameters of Pasolini himself.  He is nonetheless an outsider looking in, and while this is valid, the line of the film wanders and the images are often arbitrary.  Nevertheless worthwhile as yet another lesson in story-telling, culled from the work that covers every known plot line.  For readers unfamiliar with the substance it seems a King of antiquity adores story telling and takes a fair damsel to his bedchambers each night to hear her weave a tale of magic and mystery, but he always guesses the end, is bored before dawn, and has her put to death.  That is, until one day a very special lady creates a story that never ends.  Each night the King is left with an unfinished story and his pique is aroused.  After one thousand nights he is still captivated and on the following night, one thousand and one, he declares his love and devotion and marries the woman who is now indispensable to his romantic fantasy.",1390003200,2,1840,4.922330097087379
8359574,3,B002AK7SB2,"Unfortunately this film does not come with English subtitles so it is very difficult to follow.  Lots of full male frontal nudity and some cute guys, (bad teeth) but cute.  I understand that there are two other filmes that were made prior to this one.  Seems to be three different segments (storylines) to this film also but without knowing what is going on, it is difficult follow.",1386547200,,382,4.6716417910447765
8359575,5,B002AK7SB2,"""Arabian Nights"" is a tragic and beautiful film,this is Pasolini at his best. The main plot involves young Nurudin(the handsome Franco Merli) who falls in love with a girl,Zumurud(Ines Pellegrini) who chooses to be his slave. Nurudin is tricked by some evil men and Zumurud is kidnapped. Nurudin spends the rest of the film in search of his beloved. The people he meets tell him tragic tales of love and loss. The characters in these tales are sympathetic for the most part,most viewers will empathize with them. There is some disturbing violence in the film just to warn you,you may want to avert your eyes. But this is also a very romantic,sexy film despite the violence and tragedy-The young men in the film-Italians,Ethiopians,Eritreans are lively and attractive in an unassuming ""guy next door"" way. The cinematography in this film is exquisite, and each scene/setting is well constructed with layers of meaning. I recommend the film, you'll laugh,cry,think, and be entertained.",1306022400,4,983,5.15
8359576,4,B002AK7SB2,"This is Pasolini's third film in his ""Trilogy Of Life"" (the first two being ""The Decameron"" and ""Canterbury Nights."") This film was shot on location in Yemen, Persia, Nepal, Ethiopia, and India. Pasolini's practice of using non-actors and real people really shines in this, the people are as real, and often as ugly and as desert-beaten as the buildings. These locations give this film a degree of reality and authenticity never seen in any Hollywood Arabian Nights/Sinbad/Thief Of Baghdad genre film.

This film does present several tales of the ""One Thousand Nights And A Night"", but only someone who has read the unexpurgated 10-volume set of Burton's magnum opus would be familiar with The Tale of Ali Shar and Zumurud, the main story in this film, in which a Slave Girl gives a young man, Ali Shar, the funds to buy her, only to later lose her, and who spends the rest of the story searching for her.  The several other stories are equally obscure to an American audience.

Be aware that this film is generally released in its' original Italian, without overdubbing. Such subtitles as exist on Region 2 and Region 1 & 4 editions may not contain English subtitles. Criterion has been proposing to release all three of Pasolini's ""Trilogy Of Life"" films, so the potential buyer might wish to wait for that edition to be released.

Viewers with certain politically correct sensibilities should be warned: There is violence in this film. Animals were obviously killed in the filming of this movie. There is full frontal nudity of both sexes and of varying ages. The actor who plays Ali Shar doesn't appear to be more than 16, but he delightedly has sex on-film with a woman 10 years older than he. Several times. This film wouldn't be allowed to be screened in America in 2012. This film is not for Family Viewing. But if you are an open-minded consenting adult, this is a very accessible film from one of the geniuses of 60's & 70's Italian Cinema that truly classifies as ""Art.""",1269907200,22,1981,4.75
