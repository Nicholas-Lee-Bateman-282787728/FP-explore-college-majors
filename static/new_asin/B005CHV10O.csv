I think if you are looking for a flick that is a good bit of action, then check it out.  hope you like it just as much!",1320192000,6,255,3.7735849056603774
4653307,3,B005CHV10O,"The movie opens with 4 Orientals killing everyone they encounter in the sleek corporate office of a company called ""Archangel."" As the assassins wait outside the door of one of the offices, the movie flashes to a CIA field chief on the wrong side of the interrogation table. He claims that this all happened before the killings at archangel...cue credits and my confusion.

The movie opens up with a person listed on the screen as being deceased. I am assuming this is the story leading up to what we just saw. Now is this person deceased now or is that just how he is classified by the CIA? The characters are introduced by a very fast on screen lettering (have pause button ready) that gives you their name and official CIA or KCIA (Korean CIA?) status.

Julian Lee stars as Paul Thorn, who was retired and in hiding from the CIA after a bad accident. He is recruited back by a scruffy Daniel Dodd (Christopher Atkins) for a vital mission. Thorn refuses, but when the ""issue"" is brought to his Colorado home, things change.

We soon discover the initial killings were part of the story being told by the field chief who provides periodic narration during the film. Agents are killing each for possession of a computer disc that no one seems to know what is on it (schematics for a deadly weapon). The movie was tiresome. The acting was dull and the direction was cliche. The soundtrack was fairly lame too.

Without any fancy moves and armed only with a .45 Thorn is able to take out a group of ""the best"" agents as well as a swat team with automatic weapons and bullet proof vests (that don't seem to work). Tiffany Yee plays a swanky assassin without much in the way of lines. Min-su Choi plays Karl Kim, a Korean agent/assassin who wants the disc. John Savage plays Arlo who partners with Thorn. This movie is more akin to an old fashion spy/assassin drama than an action film, but it doesn't score too well as a drama as the characterization is limited to that of an action film.

It's starts off kind of ok with a nice Ferrari, making it look like they put some money into this film, but I think the Ferrari was the best thing about it. I just began to notice about a half hour into the film, that it's just really dry, and almost puts you to sleep.  It has a bit of an 80's-type action movie feel, and the acting, in my opinion, is subpar. Like I said, worth borrowing, but I wouldn't waist money on it.",1337040000,,587,4.060344827586207

Have you seen movies where people fall over BEFORE the gun even FIRES?  OK what about CONSISTENTLY then?
Yeah and the hero--we're supposed to believe he's some top secret agent, a 007 type.  Actually he looks more like Kim Jong Il accidentaly stumbled onto a movie set.  HEY WAIT--maybe this IS Kim Jong Il and the film was released posthumously?  After all, he had a passion for movies...THIS may be the whole secret of the film!

Sharknado in quality, Hard Boiled in movie type

What was enjoyable

The movie was directed and written by a script writing professor, and so the movie has action movie dialogue that can be funny at times. It follows a recognizably structured format that plays with tropes and structure at the end to leave me guessing the possible outcome. I was genuinely pleased with the trope twists at the end.

What could use more work

For following a structured format, the story, especially for this genre of action, is a bit too slow. Most of the pace seems to be due to weak editing. If you watch a lot of action movies as I do, you know what most of the scenes try to establish because they're all the same. This is alright and actually encouraged because regular action viewers like me appreciate the familiarity. An issue with this movie is that you know what each scene (except the last few scenes) are trying to establish, but it takes a long time to get to that point. I think proper editing would have fixed that issue.

While familiar actors such as Martin Kove (Cobra Kai Sensei), Kirk Baltz (tortured cop from Reservoir Dogs), and Richard Moll (Bull Shannon from the show Night Court) are in it, the movie overall had some serious cringe in delivery. The script seemed fine enough, but the directing of these performances came off awkward and often portraying the wrong emotion. The three actors mentioned did an adequate job, but the movie struggled in respectability at times because of the delivery and direction of the other actors.

First time watch value

If you can get through it, I think you will genuinely enjoy the ending if you enjoy trope manipulation. I would understand if you could not get through this because the journey can get slow and the acting can be a turn off at times. 6/10 (if you can make it to the end and you're a trope educated and action viewer)

Rewatch value

None unless you want to watch the ending to remember how interesting it was.",1425686400,,1989,4.593220338983051

8465439,1,B005CHV10O,"This is by far the WORST movie ever made. Assassin's Code should be proverbial poster child for HOW NOT TO MAKE A MOVIE.

Of the many, and I mean plenty, of crappy scenes and dialogues, the one that sticks out the most is the voice over of the main character/actor.

This must of been one of those movies that got financed because someone was seriously sleeping with someone with lots of money.

I literally could not sit thru this mess -turned it off after 30 hellish minutes. I have NEVER left a movie EVER in my life.

What a waste. Only redeeming quality was that it was free with Prime.

AVOID at all cost. Save yourself from the misery
