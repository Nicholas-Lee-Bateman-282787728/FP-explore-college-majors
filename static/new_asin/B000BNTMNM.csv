The Dvd has its moments mostly thanks to Blueprint who seems to have become a natural at rocking a crowd. The only problem is that the music is mixed with commentary that is utterly uninteresting. No-where is this more noticeable than on the Mr. Dibbs' section where any sense of Mr. Dibbs' DJ techniques is lost in a lot of completly unnecessary commentary.

Then there is the bonus. The biggest disappointment is seeing Killafornia (Ex- Freestylesession World Champions) are just messing around in their Bboy section. I would have liked to have seen better footage of them. On top of that you get 3 good Mc battles (Thanks to Mcs Thesaurus, Iron Solomon and New Mc), a couple of alright ones (Unforgiven and H-bomb stand up) and the two worst Mc battles ever recorded (Roadblock and Wolly Vinyl hang your heads in shame).

Basically is it worth full price? No way! If you can get it cheap or want some footage of the prelims to one of the greatest Scribble Jams ever it might just be worth the money.",1207612800,,1167,4.4186046511627906
8370607,1,B000BNTMNM,"This is not for someone who is looking for alot of good MC battles braking battles, scratching battles or even beatbox battles this is basicly a compilation CD that comes with a dvd. the dvd is a 30min review of the favorite things that happened from the tour accourding to blueprint, adeem & mr. dibbs. the bonus stuff has all the mc battles but its like 30mins and is all prelims from different citys. i think there is like 1 maybe 2 good battles on there, not worth getting for the dvd. as for the CD i dunno i haven't listened to it, theres 21 tracks it might be good but when i buy a scribble jam dvd i assume that the dvd would be longer than the bonus CD that comes with it. it almost seems like the scribble jam event is used to sell this CD.....not cool.",1206316800,,763,4.12751677852349
