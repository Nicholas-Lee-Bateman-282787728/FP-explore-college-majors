8625663,3,B00GOT1DNO,Not in Japanese language. We were trying to get this in Original Japanese because learning language. We like digimon. But it is cheeper to get the whole box set if you just want it in English. This is only good and cheep if you are wanting  just an episode but not the whole series. We like the whole series.,1460592000,,308,4.220338983050848
