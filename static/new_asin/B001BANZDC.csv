8530172,1,B001BANZDC,I had high expectation for this DVD only to be greatly disappointed by the poor quality and a damaged DVD.  Sad to write this review but I expected better quality and above all else a DVD that plays.  It is an iMovie style with poor footage.  Dr. Hilliard and Dick Gregory deserve more respect than what the folks that that made the DVD gave.  Damn shame.,1379289600,,355,4.333333333333333
