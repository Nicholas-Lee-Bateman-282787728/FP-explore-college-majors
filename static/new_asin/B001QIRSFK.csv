8335700,2,B001QIRSFK,"This show has a charming concept: make over two neighboring yards and teach viewers a bit about gardening without manufactured drama. The final gardens are much improved and the two gardeners discuss their plans with each other.

The execution is disappointing at times. The site, scale, climate and homeowners' wants are all well-considered, but some of the plants and materials aren't. (I've used some of these myself.) In episode 1, the unbordered lattice looks cheap; the terra cotta pots are likely to be broken and full of dirt and weeds within a year unless the homeowner takes care to trim (not mow) around, and clean out, those hundreds of little pots bordering her path. Episode 2 shows one of the gardeners using Japanese barberry, an invasive plant in Ontario (the show's location). Japanese barberry was known to be invasive there back in 2002.

Considering this, the show is fine purely as entertainment, but I wouldn't get gardening advice from it.",1524960000,2,963,5.0125
8335701,5,B001QIRSFK,"I agree with another poster: none of the made up drama as occurs in current HGTV type shows! I especially liked how the two co-hosts (a man and a woman) worked together professionally and collegially, sharing ideas and asking for each others' opinions. I found this to be chock full of useful tips, as well as recommendations for specific varieties of plants (and why they were chosen). Take a trip back to 2002 and enjoy this show while you dream about your own backyard!",1524873600,,472,4.630952380952381

8335703,5,B001QIRSFK,"I rent a lot of HGTV/DIY Network programs when I can (I no longer have cable), and I'm always looking for a good gardening show (well, that and a good interior design show).  Unfortunately, both networks seem to be quickly going the route of obnoxious reality-TV style programming, and their gardening/yard shows are no different (""Yard Crashers"" comes to mind here).  While I can still occasionally glean some enjoyment out of their shows, I usually have to put up with irritating drama, stupid contrived time limits/other rules, or annoying competitive nonsense on the side, too.  On the other end of the scale, I've occasionally rented gardening programs that weren't affiliated with major networks, and they were either extremely boring or completely impractical (either way too basic, or for people with mansion-sized yards and millions of dollars).  Thankfully, I finally found a nice gardening program that fits between these extremes.

Out of all the gardening/landscaping programs I've ever seen, ""One Garden, Two Looks"" is definitely the best.  For anyone who isn't familiar with the premise of the show, here's how it works:  the hosts, Charlie and Dennis, pick two side-by-side neighboring yards that are similar in size/shape, and each one takes a yard to work on.  They each come up with a different garden style to incorporate, and then they redo the spaces.  Oh, and don't worry, I know I said that there's two hosts, but this isn't an annoying reality-TV style competition  they are quite cooperative and helpful towards each other, and the tone of the program is relaxing and enjoyable.  Speaking of which, I strongly appreciate the fact that there are no trappings of reality-TV to be found here at all.  The hosts are pleasant and there's no needless drama/arguments, which makes for a very refreshing show to watch.

In fact, there are no gimmicks to this show, other than the fact that there are two yards being done side-by-side.  The real value to this program is its focus on showing you two different ways that very similar yards could be done, allowing you to see alternate possibilities.  What's really excellent is that they also go into detail with various useful tips, such as how to lay flagstone, how to space plantings, and how to prune various plants.  I also appreciate the fact that they address some common and realistic problems in the average person's yard, such as hiding eyesores like air-conditioners and gas meters, or how to hide an old concrete slab that would otherwise be pricey to have removed.  It's this sort of useful advice that I really appreciate.

I also love the fact that these designs are practical, and could actually be potentially accomplished by people of average income and average-sized yards.  There are no over-the-top designs incorporated here (such as fancy ""outdoor kitchens"" and uber-expensive Jacuzzis/firepits)  nope, there's only nice, pleasant gardens in cozy-sized front and backyards.  In fact, if there was any downside to this program, it would be that the backyards they look at seem to be pretty small  this may be typical for their location in England, but a lot of yards in the U.S. are bigger than this, so the tips in this program might be of limited usefulness here in the U.S.  Actually, watching this show just makes me want to make sure that when I buy a house, it has a small yard so that I can use some of their designs!

Overall, I'd have to say that this is definitely the best gardening/landscaping program I've encountered thus far.  I love their designs, and there isn't a single garden they've done that I wouldn't want for myself.  The only limitations to keep in mind for this show are that the yards they look at tend to be on the smaller side, and that even though the word ""garden"" is in the title, they are using it in a more generic sense to refer to landscaping, and do not focus solely on growing vegetables (they do occasionally touch on growing herbs, though).  If my description of this show appeals to you, then go ahead and pick up the DVD.  My only regret is that they never made a Season 2 of this fantastic show!",1437004800,8,4126,4.822443181818182

The design techniques presented in this dvd are great.

Season one was excellent.",1370476800,7,260,5.475
8335705,5,B001QIRSFK,"Charlie and Denis do an outstanding job at redoing problem or just lackluster gardens.  The series shows many creative and practical treatments for typical issues.  If your garden doesn't share faults with at least a couple of these projects, a professional must have already been out to your place! Everyone that I have loaned this DVD set to has loved it.  Both entertaining and educational. Beware! You may find their enthusiasm contagious!",1334880000,4,443,5.125
