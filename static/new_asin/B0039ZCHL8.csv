The rest of the cast support him well.",1496707200,,137,5.0

8392645,1,B0039ZCHL8,"The Cavalleria Rusticana is a short opera.  The music from the beginning to the end is beautiful. That's why I purchased this DVD but I am very disappointed in regard to the singing, the acting and the choreography.  The setting of the opera is supposed to be a 19th century Sicilian Village on Easter morning, at the rising of the curtains, however, you are looking at a sort of gray medieval castle, the sky is dark and you have to deal with this depressing scenario for the rest of the opera.  The village's inhabitants are supposed to look happy because is spring and Easter but they are dressed like gangsters and not as peasants.  Santuzza looks more like a widow than the girl she is supposed to be, Lola has blond hair and a white dress that make her look more like a middle age woman than the sexy girl Turiddu is going to die for.  Alfio, the ""carrettiere"" looks  like if he is exiting from a limo instead of a carriage even if he carries a whip.  I would forgive all the above if the singing is good but unfortunately it is not.  I would not recommend to buy this DVD.  There are many other versions of the Cavalleria which are excellent.
I have not jet played the Pagliacci so I cant review it.",1343260800,4,1206,4.3244444444444445
8392646,5,B0039ZCHL8,"I own the film version of Cavalleria Rusticanna with Domingo produced by Franco Zeffirelli.  I love that version.  I did not own the stage version and Jose Cura does a wonderful job in this one.  This version is good and I believe anyone would enjoy this production.

Pagliacci is very good as well and if you like these Operas I highly recommend this product.",1290297600,2,360,4.578125
