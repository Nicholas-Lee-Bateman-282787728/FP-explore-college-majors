I understand many consumers are frustrated by the different regional codes.  This DVD was made for sale in the Middle East which uses the PAL system, as does all of Europe.  North America and South America use the NTSC system.  That is why PAL DVDs and televisions for that matter cannot operate properly in the United States.  It just so happens I know someone who can transfer the DVD from PAL to NTSC.  I can play it with the English subtitles.

Once again, great way to learn a language.  The dialogue is not verbatim to the English version because the translators have to match syllables.  But if you are familiar with the film and now the meaning, you can pick up a lot.",1477785600,,760,4.562962962962963
