6931999,3,B00RLR1WIY,"The Metropolitan Opera's PBS pledge bait, initially aired in late 2014, is repackaged for DVD release. In a program running 80 minutes, Deborah Voigt introduces 18 brief clips that are said to represent the best from the first eight seasons of the Met's popular Live in HD cinema series, the oldest selection being Matthew Polenzani's Tamino in the English-language abridgement of Mozart's MAGIC FLUTE (2006), the newest a Kristine Opolais/Vittorio Grigolo duet from Puccini's LA BOH&Egrave;ME (2014).

Everyone's highlights from the HD series will be different, and everyone's highlights among *these* clips will vary as well, but this struck me as a fair sampling of eight years of broadcasts. Everything chosen is very ""bread and butter,"" calculated to appeal to a broad audience of potential pledges, with nothing from the likes of NIXON IN CHINA, SATYAGRAHA, or THE TEMPEST. The death scene from Mussorgsky's BORIS GODUNOV (Ren&eacute; Pape, 2010) and Wotan's Farewell from Wagner's DIE WALK&Uuml;RE (Bryn Terfel, 2011) are as musically radical as it gets.

There are a few superb clips that I could not look away from, even when I had seen the complete performance several times, and they made me want to see it all again. There are many other good ones, and only a few I did not think were worthy of inclusion.  Again, individual taste inevitably comes into it. Three of my own favorites were scenes for a pair of performers: Joyce DiDonato and Elza van den Heever as the dueling queens in ""Figlia impura di Bolena"" from Donizetti's MARIA STUARDA (2013), Ren&eacute;e Fleming and Dmitri Hvorostovksy in the final scene of Tchaikovsky's EUGENE ONEGIN (2007), and Elna Garana and Roberto Alagna in their last confrontation from Bizet's CARMEN (2010) -- in roughly ascending order of intensity. All three were great opera not only for our time but for any time, in my opinion.

Of the solo numbers, I might say the same for Juan Diego Fl&oacute;rez (Donizetti's FILLE DU REGIMENT, 2008), Peter Mattei (Rossini's BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA, 2007), and, as pure vocal artistry if not interpretation, Pape in BORIS. Anna Netrebko plays her flirtatious shtick to the hilt in Norina's cavatina from Donizetti's DON PASQUALE (2010), and she looks and sounds lovely. Some contractual hang-up must have prevented the inclusion of Jonas Kaufmann's 2014 ""Pourquoi me r&eacute;veiller"" from Massenet's WERTHER, which was part of the original broadcast, and this aria is a great loss.

The not-so-great: Sondra Radvanovsky's tense, tremulous, shrill-on-high ""D'amor sull'ali rosee"" (Verdi's IL TROVATORE, 2011) brought me no more pleasure this time than the other times I have heard it. Pl&agrave;cido Domingo's late-career Boccanegra (Verdi's SIMON BOCCANEGRA, 2010) probably does not benefit from being seen in a short excerpt, and he was in better voice in the role later that year in London, a complete performance on DVD. Opolais and Grigolo in the unremarkable BOH&Egrave;ME seem to have made the cut only so the story of Opolais's last-minute substitution for Anita Hartig can be told yet again, complete with Peter Gelb's pre-performance announcement to the live audience. Hostess Voigt herself is heard in a Liebestod (Wagner's TRISTAN UND ISOLDE, 2008), and at the end of a long afternoon, in a period in which she was not in the best health, she sounds precarious and unsettled, the sound not atop a solid column but carried on gusts. The excellent tenor Piotr Beczala's ""Questa o quella"" from Verdi's RIGOLETTO (2013) is undermined by insensitive conducting by Michele Mariotti, which robs the piece of charm and life. Despite a great orchestra and a fine singer, it is as musical as factory machinery whirring and thudding.

The singer introductions written for Voigt get monotonous. Almost everyone seems to have a modifier, ""the [adjective] [voice type] [full name]."" If you want to try to sort out a hierarchy, here they are in alphabetical order: Beczala: Glorious. Dessay: Dazzling. DiDonato: Luminous. Fleming: Radiant. Garana: Brilliant. Grigolo: Sensational. Hvorostovsky: Glamorous. Kwiecien: Gifted. Mattei: Dashing. Netrebko: Divine (what is she, a gay icon?). Pape: Incomparable. Racette: Moving. Terfel: Amazing.

The disc suffices for what it is. It might make a good gift for someone just getting into opera. It will test no attention span, and if you don't like something, you know it will end soon and you'll be on to something different. Maybe it would turn someone on to an interesting performance as yet untried -- fortunately, 11 of the 18 selections come from performances that have been released on DVD in whole. The seven that have not: the Dessay and Fl&oacute;rez numbers from the New York FILLE DU REGIMENT (the same production in its London airing with the same singers is available); the BORIS GODUNOV; the BOH&Egrave;ME; the DON GIOVANNI (Mariusz Kwiecien in the Champagne Aria); the BARBIERE; the TRISTAN.

But the best of what is on display here, glimpses of Anthony Minghella's spectacularly beautiful MADAMA BUTTERFLY and Robert Carsen's evocative EUGENE ONEGIN (the latter a now-replaced Met show), and the most outstanding singing/acting performances I have mentioned above, will leave the hopeless opera lover hankering for the whole shooting match.",1424736000,52,5285,5.253554502369668
8695507,5,B00RLR1WIY,Bought it as a gift for an opera buff and they said they loved it. The person I gave it to has seen a lot of opera (including at the Met) so I trust them that they were not just being nice when they said it.,1529884800,,207,3.5217391304347827
8695508,3,B00RLR1WIY,The full length dvd's are best - not the best scenes extracted.  The Carmen is outstanding as is the Onegin.  I have all in my collection and recommend them.,1528761600,,157,4.379310344827586

8695516,5,B00RLR1WIY,Radvanovsky's Trovatore excerpt is worth the price of this DVD. I watched it repeatedly until someone stole the DVD. High praise in my opinion.,1460332800,8,143,5.0
