8350879,4,B0024WD3JC,"""Haunted Histories"" is produced by the History Channel. The 5 episodes in this set originally aired in 2000-2001. Altogether they total 3 hrs 55 minutes of easy-viewing fun. Unfortunately, no subtitles are available on the discs of these oldies but goodies.

To quote Mark Twain: ""I do not believe in ghosts, but I'm afraid of them.""

...1... Tombstone Arizona. After silver was found in the surrounding hills, Tombstone grew to 100 people in 1879. By 1881, it had exploded to 7,000 people. The boom only lasted a decade, but that was apparently time enough for several people to die and not rightly leave. Some of them are malignant and some benign. In this show, eight people talk about the ghosts they've seen. One of them, William Hunley, owns the Bird Cage Theater, ""ground zero for spectral visitations"". Hunley held a seance in the theater one night, and it was cut short by something choking him.
...2... Washington D.C. The White House isn't the only building where specters have been sighted. There's the Willard Inter-Continental Hotel (learn where we got the term ""lobbyist""), the Decator House, the Octagon and Halcyon House. Seven people talk about sightings, including Natalie Zanin, of the Washington D.C. Historical Society, about the time Dolly Madison chased away gardeners trying to move her rose bushes.
...3... Savannah Georgia. Any city that saw the horrors of slavery and the Civil War is bound to have its share of ghosts. Sixteen people talk about their ghostly experiences. Buildings involved include the Hampton-Lillybridge House, which had been restored to its glory by antiques dealer Jim Williams. In December, 1963, an Episcopal priest was called in to perform an exorcism after renovations workers complained. (Williams is the man tried 4 times for the same murder,  of ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"" infamy.)
...4...Hawaii. Eight people are interviewed. Pele, the goddess of fire, ""has appeared hundreds of times to Hawaiians and tourists"" on the big island. Most interesting is another kind of sighting in the remote Wapi'o Valley. Dr. Linda Beech, owner of the Wapi'o Tree House (rentals), four people have seen the Night Marchers in the 30 years she's owned it. Check this episode to learn the best way to survive an encounter.
...5... Chicago. Twelve people are interviewed. You'd almost expect to have a ghost at the garage where the 1929 St. Valentines Day Massacre occurred. It's now an open lot with a couple trees. People have seen not only shadowy figures in the lot, but dog walkers report that their dogs get anxious going by the lot too. Maybe because in 1929, one of the men killed had brought his german shepherd, Highball. How about a cemetery where the ground breathes?

Fun viewing.

8350885,3,B0024WD3JC,"Haunted History visits Tombstone, Washington, D.C., Savannah, Hawaii, and Chicago to find out the local ghost. Chicago forgets to mention it's most famous ghost, Resurrection Mary but you can find it on the much better dvd Unsolved Mystery's Ghosts Stories. I watched most of the dvds but I found it just too damn boring and most stories seem rushed and could have been fleshed out more. If your a fan of ghost stories I prefer you pick up A Haunting or Unsolved Mystery's Best of Ghost Stories. I believe Haunted History did visit most of all the states just type in Haunted History and a state on Amazon to find if they did your state. The will be releasing this as part of a ""mega-set"" and i'd recommend that instead if you must buy the set.",1253491200,8,744,4.477941176470588
