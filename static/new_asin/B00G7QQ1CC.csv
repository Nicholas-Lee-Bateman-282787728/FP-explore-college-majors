6065318,4,B00G7QQ1CC,"Bonnie & Clyde are a couple that went on a robbery & murder spree during the depression ending with them killed in a shoot-out with the law.
Bonnies letters and poems set them apart from other gangs.
This film tries to capture being poor, not very bright and on the wrong side of the law in early 19th Century rural America.
Bonnie is the leader pushing Clyde to bigger jobs.
Clyde is her not totally unwilling follower, mesmerized by sex and headlines.
The film makes some interesting comments on the press and law enforcement both of which add to the story.
Adding sex and violence results in a surprising adult move for television think PG-13.

Any Bonnie & Clyde suffers from the its not accurate history group and the Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway movie group.
One or both of these groups will dislike any new effort.
They have valid points but something can be enjoyable without meeting their high standards.
Broadcast in two-hour blocks on consecutive nights this is an entertaining reasonably accurate movie with good acting.",1387065600,7,1034,4.808988764044944
6065319,2,B00G7QQ1CC,"When making a historical movie, it doesn't matter how much detail the production pays to the sets, clothing, cars, hairstyles, buildings, etc. if the actual characters aren't convincing for that particular era.

This version of Bonnie and Clyde suffers a fatal blow because none of the main characters are remotely convincing as 30's depression era Americans. This entire cast of very modern, blow-dried, cyber-age actors ruined the entire production. All throughout the movie, I was expecting Bonnie and Clyde to whip out their smart phones and start texting their BFFs.
Everything about their voices and mannerisms just screamed 'trendy shopping mall youngsters' and never once did they convey poverty stricken, violent, white trash gangsters.

British actress Holliday Grainger as Bonnie Parker tried very hard, and she actually performed a decent southern accent, but unfortunately it wasn't a Texan accent, but more of an Alabamian or Georgian. (Trust me, there is a huge difference.) I think actress Kirsten Dunst would have made a great and much more convincing Bonnie.

Emile Hirsch as Clyde Barrow just may be the worst casting of the year. I think he's talented, but this very distinct role was not meant for him, at all. (actor Lucas Black would have been much more appropriate.)

Like my heading states, the Americans should learn from the British. When they make those impressive 'period' movies from various eras, they pay close attention when casting the proper actors who can successfully capture the right dialog, dialects and mannerisms. It makes a world of difference in the final product.

I would give this version of Bonnie and Clyde a 2 out of 5 rating and suggest skipping it.
Watch the masterful film from 1967 instead.
Although the 2013 mini-series tried to be more accurate with the actual story of Bonnie and Clyde, the 1967 film is far superior in its entertainment value and realistic characters for that era.
Whoever cast the 2013 version should perhaps consider a different career choice.",1386979200,8,2020,5.146341463414634
6065320,3,B00G7QQ1CC,"I'm a Bonnie & Clyde history buff that reads/watches everything about them that I can get my hands on. So I'm used to the story being tweaked every time it's told. I try to enjoy each project for what it is despite any creative license taken.  But as History was one of the channels this aired on, I was hoping for a version that would finally come closer to the truth. While they did nail some of the lesser known smaller details that are often left out, they drastically changed the ""big picture"" in ways that will be startling to those who are at all familiar with the history. The heart of Bonnie & Clyde's relationship itself falls victim to this strange storytelling, which is quite frustrating to watch.  I don't want to give away too much, but the set-up leading into the ambush scene left me staring at my TV with my mouth open in disbelief. I had to watch it a couple of times before I finally accepted that my eyes really were not playing tricks on me & they really did choose to play it out the way they did.

So why did I even give it 3 stars?  It's very nice visually speaking.  I enjoyed the period costumes especially.  I thought the actors did a fine job playing the roles as they were written, even though the best actor probably wouldn't be able to make some of this material work. They certainly didn't shy away from the the violent nature of their crime spree, though they did change the motivations and level of involvement by certain participants. And despite my critique of the set-up leading into the ambush, the ambush itself was very well done.  Overall, I found it to be more enjoyable watching a second time after the initial shock wore off from the first viewing.",1386892800,5,1693,4.42443729903537
6065321,4,B00G7QQ1CC,"Not the most historically accurate to be sure, but it's very entertaining and well put together for what it is. While all the acting is impressive, Grainger's performance is particularly noteworthy. I'm not going to go into all the differences between what actually happened and how the movie portrays the events because that would be a waste of time. Just be aware they exist. Bottom line: if you're a ""the book was better than the movie"" kind of a person, or if you're any type of history buff, you will likely be disappointed and slightly irritated. If you're a lover of the movies, you're not going to care or be inconvenienced by, much less even notice the errors incurring its criticism.",1386720000,16,693,4.735537190082645
6065322,2,B00G7QQ1CC,"This is just a mess from the view point of history. The History Channel has never let the facts stand in the way of their story. Events in B&C 's short  run of fame were placed  at the wrong time (Hamer showed up in 1934 not 1932), had the wrong people (Bonnie Parker and Ralph Fults were in jail when Clyde Barrow, Ted Rogers and a third robber killed Bucher) and it goes on and on. This movie is pure escapism and should be viewed as such.",1386720000,2,441,4.057471264367816

6065381,4,B00G7QQ1CC,"Fictionalized but exciting account of the legendary 'Gangster Lovers' Bonnie and Clyde.  The script gets failing marks for historic accuracy:  Clyde was smart, but it was street-smarts; he knew cars well and could tune them up to outrun the cops.  But he was never recorded has having any sort of 'sixth sense' about what was going to happen.  Sure, there is little doubt that they could see how their lives were likely to end (Bonnie Parker even wrote a poem about it, and once joked to an undertaker that he might soon have them on his slab), but their eventual deaths were obvious to almost everyone considering how they lived.  Also historians now agree that Bonnie Parker most likely never killed anyone, and that she was not even present at some of the hold-ups she supposedly took part in.  Most of all, the film errs by portraying Bonnie and the aggressor and master manipulator when her own writings and letters clearly show that she was not.  This is actually a typical Hollywood gloss-over, since having a female lead be submissive to a male is frowned upon today as a stereotype, so they replace it with a new stereotype - the bitchy, tougher-than-any-man woman.  Unfortunately this attitude robs the film of the historical truth.  For something that was aired on the History Channel, this is doubly sad.

On the plus side, this miniseries is well directed.  The pace moves along nicely and the actors bring zeal to their roles.  Holliday Grainger is particularly good - she is both alluring and repulsive as Bonnie Parker.  Of course William Hurt brings a no-nonsense performance as the lawman determined to end the duo's crime spree no matter what it takes.  In addition, the sets, vehicles and costumes bring a level of authenticity lacking in most period productions.

As entertainment, I would highly recommend this version of 'Bonnie and Clyde'.  Just be sure that, if it interests you the the real-life duo you check out some of the more historically accurate documentaries on the subject.",1457654400,,2008,4.8617647058823525

This movie satisfies with great acting, following their story well, and lots of believable action. The clothing, cars, lifestyle all fits the Era and tells their story well. So tragic and horrible how it ended. But it felt like I was looking back in history. I loved the fashion and style of cars and it was eerily good.

6065402,5,B00G7QQ1CC,"With all due respect, what the folks objecting to the lack of so-called ""biographical accuracy"" and ""fictionalizing"" are forgetting is that Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow were and are fabled and legendary icons in the annals of American crime---back in a time in which a still-primitive and often illiterate country, especially in the widespread region sense, the average person, especially during the Great Depression, went only at least or as far as the third or tenth grades, were provincial in their thinking and perceptions because of geographic isolation, the ""accuracy"" behind the unerring ""truth"" of these famed criminal ""heroes"" became chunks of fact that soon were mutated, through ""tall tale"" speculation and retelling, depending how newspaper and radio reportage was (often inaccurately) read, heard, and interpreted (a favorite pastime in early 20th Century America, even before 1929 gutted the country financially and aesthetically).

 I therefore tend to agree with the people who have left comments on this page who say there's really NO way of knowing, giving contradictory (and, most likely, sloppy and unintelligible) record-keeping, then-unorganized and heavily regionalized and thus mediocre law enforcement cohesion (unlike today), and the heavily rural ""fat-chewers"" of the vast parts of the country Bonnie and Clyde and the gang were said to have been seen or to have committed their crimes adding accurate or inaccurate hearsay to the entire mix of information upon which biographers and historian draw.  Even historical documentaries and biographical experts don't always agree about these two, except that, together, they were incendiary and combustible.  Their crime spree was so widespread that we will probably never know if Bonnie killed anyone, but my feeling is that, despite what seemed a basic good nature before she met up with Clyde (her first husband, with whom she split in 1929, was also an ex-con---the woman demonstrated a definite pattern of having a ""bad boy"" fixation), and her deepening love for Clyde and the frantic crime spree the shared toughened her beyond the sentiments expressed in her earliest letters to him.  She undeniably was, like any woman in love, able to sway ""her man"" to her way of thinking and get pretty dangerously lost in some pipedreams and delusions of her own that only became pronounced after growing up in a life of poverty and taking on a life of crime with a man who became genuinely and  psychopathically vengeful due to the surreal brutality of serving time in the state prison system; also, there is no recorded evidence to doubt that Clyde had premonitions about his fate, as Bonnie certainly did, as expressed through her poetry.

Yes, there are incident changes and liberties taken with what little we know, for certain, to be fact, but that's typical Hollywood---this version is certainly an improvement on that even less accurate, appalling slapstickish 1967 mess that inexplicably won an Oscar for Estelle Parsons portraying Blanche Barrow as a screeching banshee/""twirly-bird"" twit, when the actual woman was in fact a rather reserved, observant, and intelligent-enough woman to pen her own biographical account of life with the Parker-Barrow gang while serving ten years in prison for her and husband Buck Barrow's participation in the gang.",1449014400,3,3328,5.303605313092979

6065427,5,B00G7QQ1CC,"Lots of people think that this movie is inaccurate, when in fact, it is.  But I love this movie anyways, as it provides good entertainment.  And a truly perfect, accurate ""movie"" about Bonnie and Clyde would be quite a long miniseries in reality.

So first, I kept seeing TONS of commercials for this movie on the History Channel when it first came out.  And then finally I'm like, ""Meh, okay, I'll watch it.""  So I watched it and loved it!  I found this couple to be by far the most romantic couple in history, and claimed first place as my favorite historical characters.

After watching the movie, I simply couldn't get enough of them.  So I found a book and started reading about them.  After reading the book, I found many inaccuracies in the movie.  For one, Bonnie was not some mentally ill psycho like the movie might suggest, she was actually a very sweet girl.  Also, she was very severely crippled in the book as a result of a car accident, whereas in the movie it was not nearly as bad.

Anyways, if you want a good movie to watch with SOME history, get this movie.  If you really want to know the true story of this amazing, romantic couple, get the book, Go Down Together by Jeff Guinn.  The book also has some pictures of the real couple (black and white, of course), and Bonnie was actually really pretty and Clyde was quite cute.

All of the actors and actresses did amazing jobs though, and the movie was very convincing.  It actually makes you feel like you're right there with them in the Depression-era.

Some side notes:
Even though Amazon says it's ""Not Rated"", I would rate this as PG-13 due to violence, blood and gore, and some sexually suggestive scenes.
It's quite a downer, Bonnie and Clyde didn't deserve their fate, and watching this movie might put you in a depressed mood.
Like I (and other reviewers) said before, it's inaccurate.  So therefore, if you want this for educational purposes, I'd get the book instead.

Not like the original, but another interesting unique perspective. Some correct accuracy.
though a lot of people didn't care for it, i happened to like it. Even though it seemed like
Bonnie was more of the leader and instigator, fame hungry, when Clyde truly was the leader
of the Barrow Gang and made all the decisions.
You can see that in 1967's Warren Beatty's version along the beautiful Faye Dunaway.
Holliday Grainger and Emile Hirsch had the look down and that intense tension and chemistry.
Interesting way it ended compared to first film and the book ""Go Down Together"" by Jeff Guinn.
Fun but in most cases fictional. I never would've thought of Clyde Barrow as a 6th sense future visions.
It was very entertaining, but brutal when it came to the prison scenes, but that was true.
I give praise to the costume designer and the pictures scene, Grainger & Hirsch captured the look
amazingly and it looked just like the real pictures!

6065447,4,B00G7QQ1CC,"Entertaining mix of Fact and Fiction as Bonnie and Clyde rampage through The Depression, firing off guns aplenty, essentially for that Great American Raison D`etra;  Something To Do.

The Good: The actors are well-chosen, bearing the closest similarity to the real B&C that has ever been attempted on screen. (Dunaway and Beatty were waaay off)...The narrative follows closer to the real chronology of B&C`s crime spree than the much-lauded `67 film....Frank Hamer is treated far closer to his true self than he has been before, with William Hurt doing his usual solid acting job and the characterisation far closer to the real Frank Hamer than that ridiculous Denver Pyle portrayal in the `67 film.... Numerous details of the real  B&C story are added, seemingly as a small wink to historians and those who have actually read up on the real B&C. Details, such as the name of  Texas Sheriff Smoot Schmid, given however fleetingly, do help raise this effort above the rest. (for me, anyway)...and yet, strangely.....

The Bad: Why are so many important details skewed and altered??  Example: Bonnie`s pics--the infamous 'cigar' photo as well as the other playful pics of her and Clyde cavorting with their firepower--were recovered by the law after a hideout of theirs was raided, NOT mailed to some fictional female reporter that Bonnie chose as her press agent. Also; according to this; Clyde was PSYCHIC ! This story begins right off with Clyde --apparently speaking from Beyond The Grave--talking of how he 'Sees Visions'...and then through-out the tale, Clyde sees precognitive hallucinations...VISIONS of events to come !..BLOODY events to come.
Well, I am no expert...But I have read a bit on B&C... NEVER have I read that Clyde was a psychic wonder !

Another narrative aspect is that Bonnie was the driving force behind the robbery/murder spree, that her Ego pushed Clyde into greater crimes...
I don`t know....
I will say that--flaws and fictions included--this still stands as the closest thing to The True Story of Bonnie & Clyde....(sigh)",1423440000,,2050,5.101492537313433

Now if you want the facts if someone actually knows them all,then look for a book or documentary. Truth is even the real Blanche Barrow did gave conflicting interviews at different times in her life. I like the character of PJ Lane she did not existed but represents the media that aide the duo into celebrity status. The "" friendship"" that they had for me it was a symbol of the fascination Bonnie had with the press and vice versa. The actors are all excellent specially Holly Hunter and William Hurt.  The film does not claim to be the real story of the duo, but they should have worked a bit more on helping Holliday Granger sound more American.",1404604800,,807,4.38
6065480,4,B00G7QQ1CC,"Considering this was a television portrayal of the infamous duo, it really wasn't all that bad.  What could have been better though would have been a better use of the allotted time to delve more into Bonnie & Clyde's actual life than the general stuff shown in its place.

Yes, the acting was good.  It was especially good considering it was made for television.  The storyline was very much the same as too many other writings and whatnot.

It's enjoyable to watch.  As the movie/series progresses one begins to lose respect for the pair.  Bonnie is a celebrity wannabe not so different than far too many current ""celebrities"".  If we were to believe what is shown, we are lead to believe Bonnie was the reason for the escalation of both violence and frequency of the crimes committed.",1404259200,2,787,4.693430656934306

To anyone who knows anything about Bonnie and Clyde this a work of fiction.  There are so many things that the movie portrays that never ever happened.  Clyde never: met Frank Hammer, attended Bonnies wedding, or had premonitions.  Bonnie never: sent photos to the press, killed a guy on x-mas, or talked to the press.  One of the biggest events was left out of the movie, the shoot out in Joplin.  This was the event that put them on the front page.  They left behind undeveloped rolls of film and Bonnie's poem ""the death of Bonnie and Clyde"".  These items made front page news.  There are a ton of other mistakes, too many to name.  If you want to watch an old school gangster movie on Saturday night this will work.

For one thing Bonnie Parker isn't known to have killed anyone. She had pictures taken posing with guns and cigars but was never documented as shooting a gun let alone killing anyone.

I don't want to get to down on the actors, but it seemed more like they were characters from 2013 wearing clothes from the 30's.  The story was slow to start and then rushed towards the end.  I would have expected a little more from A&E.  Also, there were a lot of historical inaccuracies that were sacrificed for the sake of drama.  The story on its own has so much drama, I'm not sure why things have to be made up to try and add to it.  A lot of events and some main characters, like W. D. Jones was left out of the story entirely.  The 1992 movie was closer but still missed in a lot of areas.  I hope one day, someone will make an historically accurate version of this story.",1393027200,4,752,4.20979020979021

The ladies that do that, are just ""White Hot""!!!!  Thank you Holliday, I hope you inspire billions of females to do the same.  I am confident Bonnie's personallity was identical to this brilliant job by Holliday.

Poor acting.  BUT mainly 90% or more of this movie is fake, false, and not accurate.  This crappy movie was nearly all FICTION.  The actors, directors, producers and so called re-writers should be completely ashamed of even putting this out.  How Bonnie and Clyde met in the movie is not how they met in real life.  I was laughing hysterically when in the movie Bonnie tells Clyde that he needed a makeover.  Are you kidding me?  Makeover was a word that wasn't even used then.  I could go on and on about how crappy and fake this movie was, but you and I don't have all day.  So glad I have a couple great books to read on the subject.  And by the way the Warren Beatty film had many fake and false things about it too, but at least for the most part is was a well done movie.",1389484800,14,954,4.216666666666667
6065540,3,B00G7QQ1CC,"Holliday Grainger and Emile HIrsch are appealing and exciting as Bonnie and Clyde.  Both actors give strong performances. This period piece is done well as far as the weapons, cars, costumes and set design. Even the golden look in certain scenes gives a gritty 1930's feel to the film.  William Hurt is wonderful as Frank Hamer, the relentless Texas Ranger in hot pursuit of Bonnie and Clyde.  Holly Hunter, as Bonnie's mom also turns in a solid performance.  I really wanted to like this film and it is very entertaining.  But the story is far from being accurate.  There was plenty of creative license taken in this Bonnie and Clyde version. For one thing, portraying Bonnie as the instigator in several bank robberies and whose ego was primarily fueled by being famous and seeing her name in lights is not true. Bonnie's letters to Clyde (in prison) show quite the opposite.  She wanted Clyde to ""not be a thug"" and urged him to go straight. Many of her letters are quoted in published and film biographies of Bonnie and Clyde. As for the witness who initially reported Bonnie shot one of the Grapevine police officers and heard her say, ""his head bounced like a rubber ball"", was later discredited.  That scene in the movie never took place. However, newspapers of the day ran with the first story and helped turn public sentiment against Bonnie and Clyde. There are documentaries available that give a more accurate historical account of these two notorious outlaws.  This version of ""Bonnie and Clyde"" is compelling.  But for historical accuracy, this Roman a Clef is way off the mark.  If you want the true story, check out ""A & E's Bonnie and Clyde,"" History Channel's documentary ""Bonnie & Clyde: The Real Story"" or read John Neal Phillips book ""Blanche Barrow, my life with Bonnie and Clyde.""  Not only was Blanche married to Clyde's brother Buck, she ran around with the Barrow gang and left journals (1933 - 1935) during her prison stint after being shot and captured.",1388707200,14,1980,4.774193548387097

this version was made in 2013~ of depression era Bonnie and Clyde~ Girl loves bad boy theme is how it starts. Bonnie is attracted to bad boy Clyde Barrow who spends time in and out of the state prison. Bonnie is soon on the run with Clyde where a series of bank robberies and killings are building the *killer couples* fame. Emile Hirsch is Clyde and is good. But the real gem here is Holiday Granger a lovely girl who takes on Bonnie and is an excellent (Holiday is an English girl ) who has a real talent for accents. Very hard to guess this girl is really from the UK. William Hurt is the Texas Ranger who ends up planning the final demise of Bonnie and Clyde. Low budget but the sets and the scenery are well done and the period piece is entertaining.
