I also just read a fantastic review on fangoria mag august issue they did a great write up on the twin brothers Brent and Blake cousins,I highly recomend this movie, I put this movie in my top ten zombie movies ever made.",1187827200,6,838,4.630872483221476

8201653,1,B000RO8UBA,"This movie is very very bad.  Please understand that I love zombie flicks and I like the low budget ones.  There are some good zombie genre movies out there that were made by independants on a low budget.  So don't think I am saying this movie is bad just because of low production values or I am not happy if the effects were not multi million dollar scale.

The movie had several things going for it.  Some of the music was pretty creepy and a couple of times they came close to setting up some pretty good scenes. The concept for the story is good.  The plot could have been good if they had developed it.  Hell, the bad acting did not really sink it.  I mean, you expect some of that with these types of films.

What kills this movie and subjects the audience to a most excruciatingly painful ride is that they abandoned the premise of the movie.  It was supposed to be about some plane crash survivors who were trying to reach a survival shelter ten miles from the crash site so they could wait out the zombie apocalypse.  Instead, what we got was a string of very contrived scenes that showed Blake Cousins coming in to save the day.

Watching this movie is like having to watch some muscle baby with Fabio hair, who really really thinks he is cool, trying to impress all the girls at some cheesy night club.  One of his first lines is "" Maybe they put me on the plane because I have Presidential connections, or maybe because I was special forces, or maybe because I know about Nuclear reactors.""  What's it gonna be Blake, do you want to be a cowboy or an astronaut when you grow up? The whole movie is this guy running in to save somebody, and usually failing as they get eaten, or he is doing the cool guy swagger while cocking one of his guns every 5 minutes.  I guess it is no surprise that he also helped write and direct this bomb as well as star in it.

If you like Zombie movies, you probably won't like this one.  If you like posers, this flick is what you have been waiting for.",1278547200,,1996,4.238095238095238

8201655,1,B000RO8UBA,"This is a great bad movie. It's kind of like a high school production of the Thriller video...
Insomnia is a funny thing sometimes...gives you a chance to watch bad movies on the internet that you might never get a chance to see otherwise. This one is hilariously bad...bad writing, bad acting, dumb zombies, dumber ""zombie bait"", beautiful location, attractive cast. One of my favorite quotes was ""He has as much courage as his Dad. His Dad was also courageous...and brave."" (Turns out his Dad was the President...turned into a zombie).  This isn't really worth watching unless you have some time to really waste...but a really bad movie is so much more entertaining than an hour of American Idol...and much more memorable.
I hope the production of this movie worked for the guys that made it...that they ""got some chicks"" and somehow made all this worthwhile.  This movie is a great bad movie...really funny for all the reasons they never meant for it to be funny.",1207267200,5,966,4.813253012048193
8201656,2,B000RO8UBA,"Not TOO bad...

1) ACTING: The acting was so-so, I really think some of these people need a few more acting classes and they could be okay. The lead was okay as ""the hero.""

2) PRODUCTION: As with all no / low budget movies, it shows. It is up to the director to take what he's got and make the best of it. And, amazingly, this director does. I'm not saying that he was always successful, but from the way certain scenes were filmed, you could tell he was trying. There was a good chunk of blood and gore in this one as well. I think the biggest problem this one had was that the script needed some work. The basic plot wasn't all that bad, it just needed some serious polish. And while I realize the lead actor was probably wearing an old suit, His secret-service image was kinda shot when the viewer could see that he was wearing pants that were too short for him, because of the WHITE SOCKS. Also, I do not know if this movie was dubbed or what, but the voices were odd, like they weren't in synch.

3) THE ZOMBIES: The zombies in this one consisted of both ""Romero shamblers"" and ""Snyder runners."" Nothing new here is brought to the zombie genre.

4) THE CAUSE: Germ warfare

5) NUDITY: None.

Not a bad entry for the no / low budget zombie genre. I would like to see what the director could do if he had some serious money to work with. This movie isn't incredible, and most likely will be easily forgotten, but it surely isn't the worst of what's out there either. I would say rent it, invite over some friends, and laugh at the cheesiness of it all.

8201657,2,B000RO8UBA,"Ok, so I was just gonna watch the movie, keep my thoughts to myself and get on with my life... until I saw some pretty outlandish reviews. I thought, ""Those poor zombie-lovin' folks are gonna fall right into that trap of thinking this is a great movie unless someone stops them!"" Someone's gotta set the record straight.

""The Rising Dead"" is your basic low-budget zombie flick and like so many others, falls prey to the same elements, over and over again. The shaky acting, the thin, drawn-out script, etc. ""Fast paced action""? It's about as fast-paced as a lullaby. I will be honest, the movie does boast an attractive cast, and I will give them points for their attempt at special effects. Also, filming in the lush tropical jungle was nice but don't be deceived. ""The Rising Dead"" probably won't make any Top 10 Lists.",1193702400,4,822,4.6689655172413795
8201658,1,B000RO8UBA,"I have never written a review before. This movie was so bad that it moved me to warn other people to save your money and your time. The acting was horrible at best, the special effects were missing. The camera they used was something like that of a 7-11 type security camera. I think the purchase price of the dvd cost more than the movie did to make. I forced myself to watch the whole thing as punishment for spending the money. I gave the movie a 1 star because the system would not let me rate it 0 stars like it should be.",1192406400,4,527,4.076923076923077
8201659,1,B000RO8UBA,"Do not trust the review by Mr John Blake. He is a member of the cast/crew.
I will start this review by saying this is not the worst zombie movie I've ever seen. That honor goes to Forest of the Dead(not to be confused with Severed: Forest of the Dead) or Ghoul School. This was still a bad movie though. The voiceover is terrible, the echo annoying. The acting in this film is bad but with some work the cast could do a better job next time around. The effects were passable but not great in any way. The fact that at least 5 times during the movie a black screen appeared with the words Cousins Brothers Productions was extremely annoying and stupid. This movie is very forgetable. In fact I'm having a hard time writing this review because i've already started to forget about the bad script,etc. There are much better ways to waste an hour and a half. Do yourself a favor and don't watch this. Or if you do make sure its a free rental.",1191369600,3,938,4.275280898876405
