VOL 2 EXCELLENT = THANKS AGAIN",1356998400,,110,4.285714285714286
5013685,5,B006QVRWH6,"When I purchased Volume 1, I was disappointed to find that it did not include all of season one. In fact, much of season one is in Volume 2. Nevertheless, they are both worth the money as Larry is in fine form. I actually like this show more than his standup. History Channel needs to do a better job telling prospective customers what the content of the ""Volumes"" is.",1337299200,5,368,4.3478260869565215

5013692,5,B006QVRWH6,"Great show that showcases America and why we are a great society.  We come from all over the world to become American and take care of each other.  Larry shows that we take ideas and improve on them to make them something only found in America.  Way to go Larry, and thank-you for really loving America, and showing us our roots.",1407542400,,329,4.360655737704918
5013693,4,B006QVRWH6,"This is a very fun series, I've caught a few on the History Channel and they are HD so I was hoping to find them on BR but DVD is fine.  Larry is a great host and unlike normal travelogues this show features a very odd look at our wonderful country.  I didn't pay close attention though when ordering and was surprised to see that the 3 DVDs are not finished but DVD Rs from Amazon.com.  They look great but need to be handled with extra care or they will more easily scratch than finished DVDs.  Amazon.com also in the creation of these discs has mislabeled many of the episodes on the MENUS... so a star is deducted for the useless menus.",1407110400,4,640,4.221311475409836

5013696,4,B006QVRWH6,Well it is two of two and hopefully there will be more to come. It is good to see America even from the stand point of a comedian.,1393200000,,130,3.6785714285714284

8503227,5,B006QVRWH6,"Highly amusing. Some may call it ""low-brow"" humor, but let's admit it. Poo and Fart jokes are funny.  Larry is engaging and his ad-libs with the people he is covering can be hilarious. The show also accomplishes it's purpose .... giving insight to different facets of the nation and it's people. Highly recommend it.  Definitely family friendly as well.  The kids will enjoy it with the parents.",1424390400,,395,4.865671641791045
