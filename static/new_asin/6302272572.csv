7823470,2,6302272572,"Set in the desolate expanses of working-class and sub-criminal Montana and Oklahoma, it's a kinda-sorta coming of age story where characters wander through the plot without any particular purpose and things just seem to happen without any particular reason.
That's great in real life--people do tend to wander aimlessly in and out of each other's lives and things do just sort of happen without any discernable pattern--but it makes for a bad movie. The only real drama of the film happens about 3/4ths of the way through it... and it's way too brief.
Lili Taylor and Bill Pullman give nice performances (which is why the flick gets two stars instead of one), but there's not much else worthwhile here. Pass on this one unless you're the world's greatest Lili Taylor fan or don't have anything else to spend the $8 on.",991094400,4,818,4.808510638297872
7823471,5,6302272572,"I was one of the few people to see this movie when it first came out, and I thought it was amazing.  A strong sense of place and mood, and a haunting performance from Mulroney,",952300800,6,176,4.0285714285714285
7823472,4,6302272572,"This somewhat flawed coming of age film is remarkable for the performance of Lili Taylor as Lucy, a world-weary young woman out to save her brother from jail.  Richard Ford has written some wonderful dialogue for her  character but to appreciate it you have to see her delivery.  Wonderful  cast includes Sam Shepherd, Mary Kay Place, Valerie Perrine and Bill  Pulliam.  Score is original and interesting.",946857600,5,405,5.0606060606060606
7823473,4,6302272572,"I love Lili Taylor and her body of work, and this indie film is just one example of how good of an actress she is. The story is great and the Montanan country side is breath taking. It's a great film.",936835200,5,200,3.902439024390244
