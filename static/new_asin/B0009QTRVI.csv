2313346,5,B0009QTRVI,It lets people who do not live in the gay and lesbian world have an insight on what we go thru. See all they see is two people wanting to be with the same sex. but these series show that we are human to. I give this two thumbs way up.,1122940800,9,234,3.607843137254902
2313347,5,B0009QTRVI,"I love this show! I love the characters! The first season was great, but this season is even better. The only thing that I would change, is the pace, it could have moved just a bit faster, but it was still great though. What makes this season better than the last is how much we see of the characters, all of them are opened up for us to view. Theres even a few new characters that add even more spice to the drama. That is what I love about The L Word, the drama! It truly reminds me of the crazy things that can happen to a group of friends when love and lust is mixed in with friendship- I love that! I realy do reccomend anyone to buy this, it isn't only about lesbian issues, it goes beyond that.",1121644800,16,701,4.014285714285714
2313348,5,B0009QTRVI,"Love this show, haven't missed a single episode. The second season stands out from the last one in that you feel more attempt by the directors to give you an insight to the characters and their internal struggles and flaws.  You see new connections from the last season amongst different characters.

One thing I love about the L word is its ability to show you a side of yourself. You cannot help but watch the show and feel for what one or more of the characters is experiencing at one time or another.

The show's emphasis is not solely on the fact that these are lesbians but that they experience personal and relationship issues that you too might have experienced and how they overcome and fight through the struggle.

I love the 2nd season, though, theres far too much emphasis on music. Every episode seems to leave this pume of music - though good - becomes overbearing. It just sounds like they we're feeding fuel for their soundtrack fire. Which I believe they did. Too much Betty, Too much EZGirl. Besides filling the audience with concerts and musical artists, its a great show, and worth buying.",1121385600,8,1109,4.642857142857143
2313349,4,B0009QTRVI,"This season delves more deeply into the lives of the L.A framily. Can't really put my finger on what I feel about this second season. It was more serious than the first, which in a way is a good thing (not all lesbians have fun ALL of the time lol) but also it kind of took something away. The spirit, the 'network' if you will. The friends have kind of gone seperate ways (Shane and Jenny are practically best buds, which I LOVE by the way) Alice and Dana become lovers, Bette is on her own for the most part, which I'm glad of, and Tina is with THE biggest div ever lol.

I liked the season, loved it infact, but I was expecting more I think. Season 1 was so huge, so awesome, I was hoping that the same level of greatness would be carried through. I think this hasn't been realised in season 2.

The success of the show may have clouded people's judgement. It's now being written 'trendily' for trends sake, because they knew they got it down perfectly in season one, only then they weren't trying to impress. It was real then, natural. Now it seems somewhat 'performed' for the audience, giving them what they want and trying to get the gay world right out there. Slighty tright and self apreciating.

That makes me sound like I don't like the show anymore, which is far from the truth. I do love it, I just think that the writers should be careful not to go overboard. It's sink or swim now. Take it slow, built on relationships. At the end of the gay....sorry, day (laughs), it seems they are trying to sell tickets into the big gay club that is the world; showing us the fashions, the trends, the life...but not the people living it. Come down a peg or too, and they'll be fine.

P.S Shane and Jenny need to end up together, I'm serious.",1120262400,28,1744,4.291793313069909

2313351,3,B0009QTRVI,"I am reveiwing this dvd before the special features have been anounced. The commentary on the last season dvd set was great but only the pilot had it. Lets hope there is more this time around. I thought this season had alot of high peeks but also alot of low moments. I gave it 4 stars because no matter what, I think this show is one of the best on television. It has wonderful complex character development and with that very respectable acting, but my  biggest problem is that of the addition of BETTY! I want them out of my life and out of the L-Word. That theme song is absolutely terrible. I heard the creater of the show defending BETTY, saying that they are ""cutting edge"". Le Tigre is cutting edge, Peaches is cutting edge, but in no way is BETTY. They are always there, ruining which ever scene they happen to be infecting. They need their own tv show so they can spread their propaganda somewhere else and stop taking up our lovely ladies time. Other wise The L-Word is a great show and Jennifer Beals deserves an Emmy. I Just hope there are more special features and I hope Betty is gone by next season.",1118620800,24,1115,4.360576923076923
