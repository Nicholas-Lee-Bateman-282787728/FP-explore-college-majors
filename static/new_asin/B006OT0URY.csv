Great screenplay by Scott Fivelson and Junior Burke, tightly directed by Mark Archer, convincingly acted by David Carradine, Michael Maloney, and Mariel Hemingway, with enjoyable music by Thom Bishop--and by Carradine himself.  Unique role for Carradine, acting and singing, which should be not be missed by those who have enjoyed his other work.  Recommended.",1506297600,,420,5.53125
