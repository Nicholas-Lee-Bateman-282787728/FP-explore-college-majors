8442580,4,B004V2D6Q8,ootpath is a great under rated movie in bollywood. It borrows a little from Sean Penn movie State of Grace. It even borrows from an older Mahesh Bhatt movie with Akshay Kumar. Cant remember the name of the previous film it copied. Footpath is a far better version with great acting and plot. This is the debut of Emraan Hasmi and he has done a fantastic job playing the bullied little brother. Rahul Dev delivers a strong performance and suits the character. Aftab is decent compared to his other films. Bipasa Basu is ermm well cant think o what to say. She looks sexy and id like to get naughty with her. The other actress is pretty. It has a nice song and it is definitely worth watching.,1304467200,,691,4.40625
