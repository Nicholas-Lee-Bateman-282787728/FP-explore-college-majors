2526162,4,B000EOTWGK,"My kids who are 2, 3, and 5 love this video! They have asked for it everyday since it has arrived. With that said it is only of VHS quality not the new age DVD's clarity, coloring or sound. It's not a big deal since the kids don't seem to mind.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Growing-Up-with-Winnie-the-Pooh-It-s-Playtime-with-Pooh/dp/B000EOTWGK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Growing Up with Winnie the Pooh - It's Playtime with Pooh</a>",1344729600,,478,6.484375
2526163,2,B000EOTWGK,"We ordered this Pooh and another one for our 3 year old.  He only periodically watched DVD's we have gotten for him, and these are  pretty tame.  We thought we would have a winner with Winnie the Pooh.  We were very wrong.  We were very surprised that the DVD's put our son in tears.  They are very chaotic and actually kind of scary.  We will stick with Kipper, Elmo and Noddy for now.  Pooh will go on the shelf for a couple of years.",1205020800,,436,4.107142857142857
2526164,4,B000EOTWGK,"I have two small boys ages 2 and 4 years old.  They love Winnie the Pooh, Tigger, Roo, Piglet, and Lumpy.  They absolutely love this show.  They have so many of the other ones and they got this one for Christmas and keep watching it over and over.  It's fun and captivating for their age.  It really holds their interest.  Each of the Disney shows always teach life lessons also as this one does which is fantastic.  We love this video!

2526165,3,B000EOTWGK,"These DVD titles are entirely misleading. Yes, it's Winnie the Pooh, but the Disney studios are making this DVD out to be an educational tool for children. It's really repackaged episodes of the successful late 80's television show ""the New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh."" Yes, this show is intended for a young audience, but there might be ""scary"" scenes for children. But I've been watching this show since I was very young and I never got scared, but who knows, different kids have different personalities. Just please don't go bashing this show if it scares your children, complain at Disney for making this product misleading. Now if you're a purist like I am, you'll be upset that the theme song is replaced with a cutesy version, this was indeed frustrating since I am a big fan of this show and the Disney studios should be ashamed of this inferior theme song. I'm sorry I opened this review with so many complaints, but I like to get the bad aspects out of the way first. Now here are the good aspects of this DVD. Well first of all, this is the first time that ""the New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" has been released on DVD, the originally released VHS's included three episodes on each video cassette, and while yet a small increase, each DVD includes four episodes. The episodes have not been re-mastered but the audio sounds much better than on the video tapes. The episodes included are;

April Pooh

The Good, the Bad and the Tigger

Bubble Trouble

What's the Score Pooh?

Don't get excited over bonus features though, the only feature is a game and it's entitled ""Soccer Playtime with Pooh"" and it's very tedious. So just skip this one unless you really want to play a DVD game.

A newcomer to ""the New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" will probably appreciate this set more than I do, but if you grew up with this show you'll be disappointed with it. More episodes and the original theme song would make these DVD's five stars, so Disney, if you want my money you'll have to make better DVD's than this.",1165795200,9,2021,4.569060773480663
