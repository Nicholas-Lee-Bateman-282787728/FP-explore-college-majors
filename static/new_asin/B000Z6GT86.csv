8234856,5,B000Z6GT86,"This title Girl's High is perhaps one of my favorite series.  Should your taste be of the type that liked Love Hina, a title suited for broader market IMO, this may not be your cup of tea.  This series has no English sound track and I believe was a good choice to keep costs down for the majority of consumers of this title.  Besides, most of the time the English voice talent is terrible although IMO Neon Genesis Evangelion was done especially well.

Perhaps the reason why this title is to my liking is the studio.  Anime Works is said to be the studio but I believe the original studio was Geneon.  As you already know there has been much consolidation in the anime marketplace and Geneon was one of the many casualties.

While the box is a flimsy thin hard paper material and the individual plastic disc cases are a plain white color, the extras are nice with interviews of the voice actors and an extra episode.  This extra episode is spread across the three volumes.

I bought this title via Amazon at about $17 OTD (out the door) a year or two ago.  Unlike most videos that I rent, anime is bought because of rental availability and/or logistics.  Unfortunately I can't afford to be spending in the area of $100 or more per series during its prime that has a runtime of about 300 minutes.  And its secondary market value is not any better than most other videos, actually in many cases years past its prime the value is worse.

Yet I'll continue to search for the elusive buy.",1310342400,,1484,4.431734317343174
8234857,5,B000Z6GT86,"""Girl's High"" is a wonderful anime; not because it shows fanservice (which it does), but because it acurately depicts some true developmental issues that girls go through in the teen years whether they live in Japan or elsewhere. There are some things that regular anime watchers will recognize as regular high school events such as sports day, joining clubs, getting big-time school physicals, and more. But ""Girl's High"" is deeper than that. Issues such as first-time sex, being so truly concerned for the safety of your friend that you would be willing to kick your boyfriend to the curb, getting a ""monthly"" at the most inconvenient time imaginable, etc. These are just some of the ""real-life"" issues that are dealt with in this anime (if you are willing to look past the lingerie) and remember that this story was originally autobiographical. Hopefully, we as a culture have come a long way from the 1966 Hayley Mill ""The Trouble With Angels"" http://www.amazon.com/Trouble-Angels-Rosalind-Russell/dp/B0000CDRW2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1214025613&sr=1-1  where loads of girls were also running around in their shortie nighties at an all girls boarding school. I'm sure that was scandalous to some then but thankfully most stuck around long enough for the great story it told of dedication, friendship, and ultimately becoming an adult. Hopefully, this funny, crisply-drawn anime will attract the same crowd who loved all of the Beverly Cleary books that so honestly portrayed childhood for her character ""Margret"" and many other kids who read about her.",1213920000,,1562,5.42798353909465
8234858,4,B000Z6GT86,"I picked this series after having read the manga series, so I knew what to expect. The manga has it's fill of panty shots & blatant fanservice, yet those shots are usually worked into the plotline of the manga relatively well. (It's still fanservice, but they manage to work it into the plot without using the usual cliches that most series use.) However, I wasn't prepared for the sheer amount of fanservice shown in the animated series! The characters can't go 10 minutes without someone showing their underwear or getting caught in a compromising position. While that's fine for a while, eventually it gets old & a bit annoying. Now, I don't mind watching fanservice (I'm not the target audience, but I know that fanservice is a guaranteed selling point), but it's when it's used to extreme that I get a little irked with it.

That aside, this anime is a pretty faithful adaptation of the manga. Most of the stories are left relatively in tact (apart from one or two changes) & most of the stories translate well. I do have to admit that during one or two episodes I began to get a little bored, though. This show isn't for marathon episode watching unless you have something else to occupy your time during it.

Would I recommend this to a friend? Maybe. The sheer amount of fanservice will turn many people off to this anime, which is a shame since the characters are so appealing & the stories are relatively fresh (not too many anime cliches in this anime). However, the manga version really is much better than the anime & not everything translated well. All in all, I'd recommend renting this before buying it. It's worth seeing, but it won't be to everyone's tastes.",1209513600,,1676,4.63973063973064
8234859,1,B000Z6GT86,"Now, I'm not one to knock shows with fan-service, I own all of DearS after all.  But if you're thinking about buying this show, just buy real porn.  It has no plot what-so-ever, just a bunch of contrived situations where high school girls randomly flash their panties.  It is so asinine, it hurts to watch.",1208563200,,306,4.527272727272727
8234860,1,B000Z6GT86,"This is a pretty good anime, but I had to 1-star it just because the details are wrong. Amazon lists this collection as having the English audio track, and it does not. This collection only contains Japanese audio with English subtitles.
I made the mistake of purchasing the 3 individual DVD's and then also buying the collection thinking that it has additional audio tracks, but IT DOES NOT. They are both exactly the same.

With that out of the way, this is an amazing price on a fairly good anime, so you should buy it right now. Just know what to expect before you order.",1208131200,3,575,4.476190476190476

Though it was a little short on story, I completely enjoyed it.
Plenty of laughs and some decent character development make this
an imperfect yet fun series.

If you like pratfalls and common indecency than you'll probably like
the Girls High series.",1207440000,2,428,7.54
8234862,5,B000Z6GT86,"These animes are very funny and, on occasion, very serious and thought provoking, if you look for it (especially episode 3).

Well executed characters who maintain their characterisation throughout; nice animation and great voices. Himeji's voice I particularly like.

The bonus episode, cast interviews, textless titles (one of the coolest opening/closing title sequences around) and, to a less extent, the trailers are all very welcome.

I came across this series on YouTube and just had to have the full quality product (missed a few meals to afford it!!!).

My only complaint is that the subtitles have been Americanised; and the language toned down.  I much prefer the 'real' subtitles (with the YouTube rips) but I guess I can live with it.

10 out of 10 but shoot the subtitler... (I know enough Japanese, and the story-lines of these, to just about do without these subtitles anyway).",1206921600,4,892,5.075342465753424
