5370974,5,B009XID04I,This is such a cute story.,1453593600,,26,3.5
5370975,5,B009XID04I,"Hard to diss Ha Ji-Won. I really like her as an actress. The male lead also looks good and acted well, if more restrained (as is his job). This was a light-hearted romantic comedy with the humor dribbled in bits & pieces rather than using heavy-handed embarassment for comic relief. As others commented, the plot could have been more developed, but that would probably have required more minutes of run time. As it stands, I loved the film for what it is. I don't downgrade it because it doesn't represent great ideas and situation. I really liked the non-preachy approach to religion and agree that one can serve religious causes without being in the priesthood (and what a sad situation it would be if the only people who practiced religion were members of the priesthood).",1451260800,3,775,4.7481481481481485

5370977,4,B009XID04I,"Good acting. Subtitles actually indicated what was said unlike the ""Pet"" movie.

The female lead is so impetuous that you want to put a rope around her neck or give her the epic spanking she deserves. F***ing wench!

Cute story and the male sidekick provides comic relief at times. The schoolgirls need a beat-down too.

The male lead is all business and at times looks like he is into the rectal transport of steel rods! Lighten up, little camper!",1449014400,,448,4.6455696202531644
5370978,5,B009XID04I,This was a beautiful love story that's edifying and memorable with all the emotions. Very pure and decent love story- loved it! Made me cry at the end.,1448496000,,151,4.428571428571429

5370988,5,B009XID04I,"This movie is light and fun. Two seminarians on the path of being ordained priests is the main plot. One of the seminarians is serious about becoming a priest, the other seminarian is very serious and intense as he seeks to find his way. The setting is a local parish, enter the American educated niece of the Church Pastor. Sparks fly. The adventure begins. The ending is not a surprise but it is enjoyable watching the plot unweave. The movie is a nice distraction, a nice change of pace and may elicit a hearty chuckle.",1426896000,,522,4.505263157894737

5370990,4,B009XID04I,Cute romance film with religion thrown in.  The romance between the two saved this film otherwise this would have been a religious story shoved down the audience throats.,1425168000,,170,5.071428571428571

5370998,5,B009XID04I,"""you can't force religion or romance."" Great line, I loved this movie. I'm Christian (not Catholic), but you don't have to be either to enjoy this movie. I would criticize the ending but I don't want to spoil anything for anyone who hasn't seen it. Still with my criticisms (that are common with k-drama's), I can't rate it below a 5 star. Great love story.",1413504000,,357,4.507692307692308
5370999,1,B009XID04I,I did not enjoy it. I stopped watching it about 1/4 of the way.  Saying the bible is good for toilet tissue or using it to catch a fly with it is not good,1411171200,2,154,3.5294117647058822
5371000,2,B009XID04I,"I must be jaded, because I didn't notice a lot of swear words that other people have complained about.  It's not a bad story, in fact I liked the story,  however the actress is so horrible in it that I can not believe that any man would change any thing about his life for her.  (Let alone give up the cloth.)  I adore Korean films and have seen many Korean series on Drama Fever, but the actress's part is so silly I skipped parts of it.  The Koreans have a lot of silly women roles, but this actress went over the top. It had to be the director of the film, because I have seen her do better.",1409097600,,594,4.0
5371001,3,B009XID04I,Had too much swearing . Not your typical clean dramas . Why do they have to be like the U.S.?,1398124800,,93,3.7

5371003,4,B009XID04I,"Have literally watched hundreds of Korean films, and I rate this a strong 4 stars. The priest is gorgeous and both leads play their roles well. It held my interest, was somewhat predictable but still absorbing, funny but with some wisdom-laden points, and overall just a nice film that could really make you think, if you allow yourself to (re: life choice, the true meaning of spirituality vs. religion, and ""Divine"" love which can be represented in human relationships such as was presented in this film.",1395705600,,506,4.895348837209302
5371004,1,B009XID04I,"Cute little ""love lost and gained"" story with lots of filthy language that is not worth your time to watch...wished I hadn't.",1391990400,2,125,4.7272727272727275
5371005,4,B009XID04I,"Pros: This movie had excellent writing, acting, and production values.  In my opinion, the religious setting helped to distinguish it as an original story, and it wasn't simply a gimmick for cheap laughs but was treated in a serious manner.  The writing had some nice touches.

Cons: I would have liked to have seen bigger roles for the supporting cast (especially from the uncle and the second priest).  As with most romantic comedies, it has lighthearted bits sprinkled throughout but isn't uproariously funny.  And there was less physical expression of love than in most such films.",1391731200,,585,5.052083333333333
5371006,4,B009XID04I,Enjoyed this movie.  Very light and entertaining.  Just an enjoyable little movie.  Sweet and enjoyable to watch.  Could just relax and enjoy,1391040000,,141,5.2727272727272725
5371007,2,B009XID04I,"The premise was interesting and the setting different, so I embarked with the expectation of a nice foreign film, only to find it poorly developed and disjointed. Not worth your time.",1389225600,,183,4.935483870967742
5371008,1,B009XID04I,"Hard to say what was the worst part of this movie. Was it the absurd characters? Scenes that were cringe-inducingly formulaic and manufactured? The highly annoying lead female character? No, I have to go with the song-and-dance number at a wedding, with dancing priests and the leads singing basically a theme song for the movie. You might be thinking, ""That could be funny in a Mel Brooks kind of way."" It is not.",1387929600,,414,4.684931506849315
5371009,5,B009XID04I,I love Ha Ji Won! It's fun to watch her movies to see how she grows as an actress. This film has a great theme and the acting was very good.,1384300800,,140,3.5483870967741935
5371010,1,B009XID04I,"very poor acting, bad script, bad story. not good at all. was very disappointed! what a waste of time. poor!",1383264000,,108,4.45
5371011,4,B009XID04I,No big surprises for a K-RomCom. Definitely more interesting than the typical uber rich spoiled guy and lowly woman which many K-RomComs use as their standard formula. Worth seeing if your a fan of the K-RomCom genre.,1381190400,,217,4.891891891891892
5371012,5,B009XID04I,Ha Ji Won and Kwon Sang Woo perfect. It was a joy to watch. Wonderful story and acting. Great Ending.,1380326400,,101,4.1
5371013,5,B009XID04I,"This film boasts an excellent script that is magnificently delivered by the actors. As Always, Ha Ji Won's talent reigns supremely!
It is an added bonus that the leading man is heartbreakingly beautiful to look at. It is an appealing movie emotionally, and visually.",1379721600,,266,5.068181818181818
5371014,5,B009XID04I,"These are one of my fav Korean female and male actors.  This movie is funny and very cute. KSWoo is great in Stairway to Heaven, and ji -Won is the best in Secret Garden.",1376784000,7,170,4.0
5371015,3,B009XID04I,"Typical slapstick humor mixed with romance that you expect from this type of Korean film. Although I Like the main actress,her character in this movie is selfish, immature & mean...there's nothing but her looks to attract the priest,so he's more in lust but thinks it's love. She gives the impression of just playing with his feelings and he's just totally confused & hot for her...fun for comedy but it gets serious when his future is at stake, is she really worth it ? It's nice that they treat the subject of religion nicely. This is really just a movie about a guy who's never fallen in love, finding out that it's a life changer",1371168000,2,633,4.56140350877193
5371016,4,B009XID04I,"The movie was light, cute and funny. It transported me back to my younger days and reminded me of my first love who was also a seminarian (a priest in training) when we met.

Back to the movie.. I have seen the actor in several movies already and he always plays his role so well. His portrayal in this movie is no different. I recommend this movie if you just want to be entertained and forget all the stress of real life.",1370649600,,423,4.158536585365853
5371017,4,B009XID04I,"Not sure how I ended up watching this movie.  Maybe because it was free with Amazon Prime and had semi-decent reviews.  Either way, it was worth watching.

The love story is nothing new to Korean drama.  A cute feisty girl and a clueless nice guy meet in unlikely circumstances and end up discovering something more about each other.  Mixed in there are the obligatory cheesy humor and sappy lines common to all these films.

What saved the movie from being another ""My Sassy girl"" meets ""Windstruck"" was the religious aspect of it.  The movie shows a more accurate side of God and faith (buried somewhat by the love story.)  It breaks the misconception that in order to please God, we must be robots, living a life without feelings or love, when just the opposite is true.  I think if people had a better understanding of the God that this movie tried to portray, people wouldn't see Him as a demanding and unloving being indifferent to our human struggles.",1368489600,30,958,4.654761904761905
5371018,3,B009XID04I,Love So Divine was a slow movie without a true begaining or ending. The two main characters were naive and silly. It is a clean movie which families will enjoy. If one is looking for a real religious movie this is not it.,1366156800,,221,4.162790697674419
5371019,2,B009XID04I,"Ha Ji-won shines as usual in typical opposites attracts story.  The voice of the mail lead drove me crazy, but maybe that's just me.  I turned off the volumn entirely.  It was sortof childish, but then it is a comedy.  IF you are a big fan of the female lead, Ms. Ha makes this bearable.",1366156800,,287,4.163636363636364
5371020,3,B009XID04I,"Sent to training to learn his calling, he is told to convert a flighty darling young woman who does not believe.  After a movie long struggle, she is converted, and he questions the meaning of love and whether to be ordained or leave the calling to be with her.  In the end he chooses being a pastor. There is some good dialog, some clever interactions with the characters but there is something lacking in the emotional depth,  Don't think I would watch it again",1363737600,2,463,4.488095238095238

8544981,2,B009XID04I,"Somewhat interesting plot but as with some Korean movies, this one goes way over the top when the female co-star shows her disdain for Christian religion by using a Bible as a fly swatter and then threatening to use it in more vulgar ways.  Obviously this Korean director has a problem with the religious establishment, but why not attack the Koran too? Oh yeah, you'd be marked for death the rest of your life. When the director/ writer goes out of his way to slam a religion with such weak jokes, you've lost a significant element of viewers to include me.",1504396800,,558,4.524752475247524
