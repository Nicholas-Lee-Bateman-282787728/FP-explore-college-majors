7433043,1,B015DG7V9S,"Listening to Amy Schumer talk about her sex life was less interesting than watching paint dry, more frightening than watching an amputation without anesthesia and likely as aesthetically pleasing as wiping up vomit from your own passenger seat door.

If you have a problem with the fact that she doesn't limit her comedy topics based on her gender or that she wears short skirts even though she has thighs capable of support a human body, that's your issue, but it doesn't mean she isn't funny.",1500595200,,400,4.346666666666667

You are a fraud and you know it and now we know it.

7433075,1,B015DG7V9S,"I used to be a big fan, but her ""jokes"" are the same thing over and over.... and... over again.  I guess her show is funnier because she's not the one writing it.  Her comedy has just gotten really lazy.  Now in hind sight it's confusing how she even got so popular.

This show reminds me of a kid telling a joke.  They'll get one laugh then retell the same joke 1000s of times to anyone that will listen.  Except in that instance I feel obligated to fake a laugh. Save yourself the money and time and watch Schumer' s old stuff... ((in a whisper)) It's the same material.",1493942400,2,572,4.201834862385321

I wish I could say I enjoy her shows like I used to, but after seeing how she copied/stole jokes and the same old routine about having female parts, its just become so baseless and humorless.  Its like she makes jokes so people can complain and give her the right to be ""offended"".

Then the fat jokes. Um Amy you are a less than average sized woman....even slender.  She spends so much energy on body shame as body positivism and it just isn't. If you are an average size or less it's kind of bizarre to watch. I can only image what it is like for a really large person to hear this. So Nope. Watch something funnier like Wanda Sykes, Lewis C.K or something. They are crude in a hilarious way. I wanna be a fan but not this show this time.
