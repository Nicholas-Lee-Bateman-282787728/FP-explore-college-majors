186564,5,1564427277,This movie was one of the best that I have seen lately.  Hannah was just a character that you loved.  She was wonderful when she realized that she loved Ned.  Ned was just so tormented in the beginning and transformed by  his love for Hannah. I just wich I could find the book to read.,956793600,8,285,4.127272727272727

I normally enjoy the Catherine Cookson movies, but this one was so ridiculous I had to comment on it. I found Hannah to be such an unsympathetic character for being so meek and foolish and full of self-pity. How can she think it was ok to want to marry her half-brother? She took advantage of the well-meaning Fred and trampled on his hopes without a second thought. In comparison, we see her step-sister Margaret, who also experienced disappointment in love, go out and make something happen for herself. Hannah's treatment of her husband was appaling. Fred cared for her while she was sick (after roaming in the rain with another man on her wedding day) and took her on in good faith. In return she cheated on him and had the gall to expect to inherit all his possessions to use for her lover. Hannah showed a level of callousness and disregard that's hard to swallow in a heroine. She lacked the courage and steadiness of character that Margaret had. I kept hoping for Margaret and Fred to get together instead. Ned, played by Clive Owen look-a-like Jonathan Cake,  could have been better as well. His acting was generally good but a bit over the top in some parts. Maybe the weak script was to blame for some of his dialogue. On the plus side, there's a strong supporting cast and great production details to achieve the period look.",1209859200,5,1355,4.622406639004149
7796436,2,1564427277,"The Girl, based on a Catherine Cookson novel, is a period drama set in Victorian times.  While the sets, costumes are actors are all exceptional, the story itself is one of the darkest and disturbing ones I've seen.

 While  in all probability more realistic to the times,  Cooksons portrayal of a young girl, born on the ""wrong"" side of the bed, and her eventual life with her illegitimate father, and terribly sadistic stepmother is very hard to watch.  Be forewarned-this is not a ""family"" film, as brutal beatings of children, forced sex, adultery, attempted murder, someones hand almost cut off in a ""man trap"", and many more throughly unpleasant scenes make up this mini series.

In the end, I found no characters worth any empathy, in fact the ""heroine"" herself becomes so sneaky and underhanded that I for one wished she would NOT end up with the hero at the end.

A depressing way to kill several hours and one I would not recommend.
1.5 stars for the sets and costuming.",1206403200,10,980,4.690058479532164
7796437,4,1564427277,"This three-part miniseries is based on the book written by Catherine Cookson: it tells the story of ""the girl"", Hannah, who's ups and downs through life are followed in great detail, as she is left by her poor, dying mother with an upper class family. The man of the house, her ""father"", she calls fondly ""Mister""...the woman of the house hates her fiercely, and refuses to call her by name: she makes Hannah work in the house like a servant, and refers to her always as ""the girl""...

It's the story of life, love, and experience for one young woman who must learn the meaning of love & friendship.

For those of you worried about content: be aware that this film is like a period drama soap opera! There are instances of violence, scenes of adultery and premarital sex (although some inferred, some bits shown), a violent beating, quite a bit of blood (a butcher is a main character, although blood is also shown in an accident in the woods), etc.

All in all, it was fairly well done, well filmed and entertaining: just be aware that the storyline is not family-friendly: if you are a die-hard period film lover like me, you will want to watch it anyways, to learn more about the time period. This story gives you a peek into a different perspective on life in those times, than if it focused on the grandeur and ease of the upper class: that alone made this film a great peek into the realistic lives of the ""normal"" people of this era.",1132185600,29,1440,4.467680608365019
7796438,2,1564427277,"Actually the title is, 'The Girl'. Why amazom.com has it as, 'Girl', i can't understand. Maybe they need new glasses.

Anyways, i was really wanting to see this movie.

 The film was very well made (as are most British period films), but i was very disapointed. First of all, no one in the story (set in the 1850's), was very Christian. Seems to me most proper ladies in England, at that time, were much more Christian than portrayed here. I haven't read any of Catherine Cookson's books, but i think the screenplay must have swayed from the original story, at least in that respect.

There was way too much emphasis on sadistic attitudes and adulterous characters. Even the character of the heroine cannot be much liked (unless you're a modern-day Jezebel).

You want to empathize with her, but her lack of certain morals makes it difficult. Maybe the family in this story just wasn't very Christian, but that's what makes this film lack, in redeeming qualities.

Although the costumes and sets, and the acting, were very good...overall, the story was not edifying, or even greatly interesting. If you're a hard-core lover of English period films, you may want to see it...but if you care more for what a family should be able to view, together, then you'd be better off skipping this one.

I cannot recommend it for family viewing.

*** For period film lovers.

** For anyone else.",1126569600,16,1383,4.7531380753138075
7796439,5,1564427277,"Old fashioned storytelling in a movie. I recommend all the Catherine Cookson videos or DVD's. They are better (better at keeping you interested) than most Hallmark movies. Of course Masterpiece Theater movies are even better and richer. Hottie Nathaniel Parker is in one of these movies, and other hunkie British men are in the others.",1096502400,12,335,5.109090909090909
7796440,2,1564427277,"This movie is shameful to say the lest! If you like Pride & Prejudice, Sense & Sensiblity, Mansfield Park, The Girl is not a romantic story at all. Movie will be a waste of time and money.
Hannah is a thief from the very beginning as a child, she commits adultry, profanity is used throughout the movie every now and then. Not worth seeing, but you judge for yourself
Be warned!",1085356800,32,378,4.338028169014085
7796441,5,1564427277,"A must see film!  A few changes from the book but the characters and plot are wonderful!  Hannah(Siobhan Flynn)you just root for from the begining to end. Hannah grows from a meek young girl to a splendidly beautiful woman. She overcomes many hardships and challanges in her quest for happiness. Ned Ridley(Jonathan Cake) is the very handsome and proud ""bad boy"" you just can't help but fall in love with.  Who, unknown to Hannah, is her ""knight in shining armor"".  The settings, costumes and scenery are beautiful as are Ned and Hannah! The English countryside is just breath taking in the film. All the cast is very convincing in  their roles in the film. But, in the end, it's the casting of Hannah and Ned that makes you want to meet Siobhan Flynn and Jonathan Cake.  I loved their preformance.",1015200000,31,798,4.664285714285715
