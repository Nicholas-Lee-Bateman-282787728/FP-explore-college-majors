7958955,3,B0000639EQ,"Kenshin Himura was an assassin for the imperialist army during the revolution. At the turning point something happened and he just vanished. 11 years later he encounters a girl named Kaoru while wandering through Tokyo. He saves her life just before she is killed trying to fight a notorious murderer. He begins living with her at her dojo. They gain new friends and have many adventures, but one day ghosts from Kenshin's murderous past come back to haunt him. His gentle nature gives way to a murderous side and Kaoru must stand by him to keep him from changing forever.

This is not some of the better Kenshin material, but it's still pretty good. Kenshin fights Shogo again and Sano loses the 1st woman he loves. There is a bit of drama in this part, but it's not too bad. You didn't have enough time to get attached to the characters that died to really feel much for them. Overall this part is just a little weak.

Rurouni Kenshin is an amazing anime series. Maybe even one of the best ever made. It has everything. Action, comedy, drama, suspense, romance, and mystery are all common themes in this anime. The amazing part is that it is based loosely on actual historical characters. The animation, voice acting, soundtrack, and plot are all very well done. There are dozens of great and unforgettable characters. This anime is a legend, and is a must see for any anime fan. It's also pretty family friendly. It has violence, but it's pretty conservative. All in all this show owns.",1353196800,,1489,4.636363636363637
7958956,5,B0000639EQ,"These episodes certainly are not like the Shishio Arc. But really, I cannot say that I wanted a 'shishio type arc' right away because the Shishio Arc took so long to develop all of the various subplots involved. Therefore, these episodes do not have the same kind of emotional battles or dire showdowns the Shishio Arc did, but the developing love story between Sanosuke and Magodalia along with the urgency of the battle between the christians and the government made these episodes very interesting. Basically, you won't know how you feel about these episodes until you watch them...so just form your own opinion, and see them. I came in real pessimist about this arc because I had no idea how they could make it work...but I have been impressed by these episodes, so they just check them out.",1104624000,,795,4.768115942028985
7958957,5,B0000639EQ,once again it's me saying don't listen to the guys that say this is bad because it isn't this is great just like all the other filler episodes. THIS RULES!!!!!!! AND SCREW ANYONE WHO'S OPINION IS DIFFERENT YOU ARE IRRELEVAT.,1077321600,,224,4.625
7958958,4,B0000639EQ,"In Volume 17 of the ""Rurouni Kenshin: Holy War,"" Himura Kenshin, the former Hitokiri Battousai is reduced to a minor character, not only because he has been blinded by Shougo's Rai Ryu Sen, but also because Sanosuke is the key figure in this particular story arc.  Episodes 71-74 are part of the ""Tales of the Meiji"" period of the series and contiunes the saga of the persecuted Christians and the efforts of Shougo Amakusa, who believes himself to be a god and that his destiny is to claim vengeance for the dead by commanding an army of the faithful and fighting with the Hiten Mitsurugi style.  Meanwhile, Sanosuke is falling for Shougo's sister, the devoute Magdaria.
The four episode included are Episode 71 ""The Conspiracy of Kaiou: Shougo Caught in a Trap,"" Episode 72 ""Days of Remorse: The Sad Past of Shougo and Sayo,"" Episode 73 ""The Sneering Demon: Shouzo and Karyu Sacattered in the Explosive Flames, and Episode 74 ""Sanouske's Tears: An Enternal Farewell Befalls the Two.""  I thought that Volume 17 ""The Holy War"" would end the saga, but we still have the big fight between Shouzo and Kenshin to go.  Shouzo is turned into a slightly more sympathetic figure as we learn the story of what happened to his parents and discover that Kaiou has been manipulating Shogo to further his own agenda of ruling Japan.  But, of course, for fans of this anime it is the developing relationship between Sanosuke and Magdalia that is the most compelling.  She is such a pure soul that she gets through his gruff exterior; but then she ends up changing more than him, which is not only a violation of our expectations but rather strange given her religious beliefs.
If you have ever seen a Western version of Japan, such as the mini-series ""Shogun"" or the recent film ""The Last Samurai,"" the episodes in this story arc represent the flips side as we get to see a Japanese perspective on Christianity.  Of course I cannot vouch for either the historical accuracy or the cultural valditiy of these views, but it is certainly an interesting story line.  Granted, this story line does not have the epic arc of the Kyoto storyline, but trying to do something that big again this soon was not the way to go.  My main complaint is that when Magdalia's beliefs suddenly change it really undoes a lot of the pathos of her character.",1077148800,6,2320,4.680589680589681
7958959,5,B0000639EQ,"There are four episodes on this DVD, eps 71-74
""The Conspiracy of Kaiou: Shougo Caught in a Trap""
""Days of Remorse: The Sad Past of Shougo and Sayo""
""The Sneering Demon: Shouzo and Karyu Sacattered in the Explosive Flames""
""Sanouske's Tears: An Enternal Farewell Befalls the Two""
In these epsiodes, Sayo and Shougo's painful past is revealed. The tables turn on Shougo, as he and his followers are unknowingly put into mortal danger.
The relationship between Sanosuke and Sayo grows stronger as the two become somewhat understanding of each other.

A very exiting point in the series, not only in terms of the incoming battle between Kenshin and Shougo, but with the escalation of character conflcits and smaller conflicts that take center stage.

Plotline stays loyal to Watsuki's style, IMO.",1071273600,,793,5.092307692307692
7958960,2,B0000639EQ,"What happened to the Kenshin saga?? The kyoto arc ended and in the manga the Jinchuu arc was not complete.  So they made fillers.  The shimabara arc (if you can even call it an arc since it only lasts a few episodes long) is about another Hiten Mitsurugi Ryu master (ok........) who is christian. Some boring sh** happens and he and kenshin end up dueling it out in the most unexciting final battle ever.
I really wish they would have waited for the manga to finish.  Even Nobuhiro Watsuki (RK's creator) was wondering why they gave it the Shimabara theme.  At anime expo 2002 he was asked what he thought about the filler episodes, and he wondered why they couldn't do something more interesting, like make kenshin go to America.  (That would be pretty funny)
Dont waste your money on this.  download it at the most.",1039305600,4,817,4.561643835616438
