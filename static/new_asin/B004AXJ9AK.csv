4312543,3,B004AXJ9AK,"THE music and muscianship is bar none excellent,,,too bad the picture qaulity on the dvd is HORRIBLE and the set list is only (7)songs. not sure if they make a bluray version out their,but i would not spend the money again..",1394496000,,224,4.487804878048781
4312544,4,B004AXJ9AK,"I am a big Robert Plant fan, the DVD I received played and looked great on my Sony Blu Ray player, the only downside was it only has 7 songs and is about 30 minutes long, I bought the DVD brand new and only paid $7.58 plus shipping on Amazon Marketplace, so it was a good deal for me and I enjoyed the concert, I never saw the original TV broadcast.",1394236800,4,349,3.9295774647887325
4312545,4,B004AXJ9AK,"I saw this show when it aired and it was a great new twist on some great old favorites! I had purchased the ""Raising Sand"" cd previously, which is the cd that was promoted via this show. Unfortunately all the songs from the show are not on the cd. Plus the interviews were cut out of the dvd. Nice try guys, but just stick to the original format on dvd and cd's",1393200000,,361,4.027777777777778
4312546,2,B004AXJ9AK,"This DVD ""buzzed"" loudly when I tried to play it in my Sony DVD player then displayed a ""Disc is Dirty"" message on my screen. The disk, however was new and pristine. My Sony DVD player plays all my other DVDs just fine. I then tried to play it in my expensive high-end Pioneer Elite Blu-Ray player and got the same loud buzzing sound again. The video played this time but I was worried that the buzzing from the transport mechanism might cause problems with my expensive BD player so I skipped through the tracks and noticed that the buzzing only happened when playing tracks 1 and 2.

As another reviewer has stated, the video quality is poor - even by DVD standards although the DTS audio track is good.

I paid just $ 7.33 for the disc so it's hardly worth the effort and hassle to return it as most of the disc plays ok in my Blu-Ray player but this is a badly authored and/or manufactured DVD. It appears to be symmetrical and true so physically it looks ok, therefore the software may be at fault.",1342656000,7,1003,4.329787234042553
4312547,2,B004AXJ9AK,"This edited edition of the CMT Crossroads TV program featuring Robert Plant and Alison Krauss is disappointing, to say the least. All the chats between Plant and Krauss have been removed. Also, the video transfer was obviously not make from original elements; it is much inferior to broadcasts of the show on the Palladium high-definition TV channel. However, the sound quality is perfectly acceptable, so it does serve as a way to enjoy a few songs not included on their ""Raising Sand"" CD. But other than that, not recommended.",1296345600,23,528,4.943820224719101
8421105,3,B004AXJ9AK,Giving it a 3 stars only because I'm a big Krauss & Plant fan. This is from the CMT Crossroads series performance with some heavy editing and poor video quality. Very crude. The sound is good. The funny thing is on the dvd case cover it shows no affiliation to CMT Crossroads show. No logo or print. Whoever put this together got away with murder. Lol. But like me as a big fan you might buy it since this was a awesome collaboration effort from these two. (Producer T Bone Burnett performs as well.),1473897600,,500,4.329787234042553

8421107,2,B004AXJ9AK,Poor quality video & audio! Paid too much for such a great performance by great artists that was copied so poorly. Did not provide entire original video! would not recommend this product.,1464220800,,187,4.875

8421109,3,B004AXJ9AK,The concert on CMT was so much better. Wish it was the whole concert with the interviews and the same quality of the CMT concert. Was really disappointed for the amount of money I spent for it.,1459209600,,193,4.243243243243243
8421110,1,B004AXJ9AK,"VERY disappointing. Poor audio and video quality. Half of the actual program songs, none of the CMTR program discussions or conversations between Plant and Krauss. Terrible partial recording of what had been an excellent performance. Strongly recommend avoiding this product.",1452297600,,275,5.9
8421111,5,B004AXJ9AK,"This collaboration is one of, if not THE BEST I have ever heard!!",1442880000,,65,4.076923076923077
