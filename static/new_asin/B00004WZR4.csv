1366530,5,B00004WZR4,"This is one of my absolute favorite movies. Prisoner of the Mountains portrays all of the main characters with warmth and dignity--there are no one-dimensional characters in this film. It is the story of two Russian prisoners, the man who hopes to trade them for his son, and his daughter. The director and the screen writers handled the relationships between them all with warmth and sensitivity.",993772800,14,397,5.03030303030303
1366531,4,B00004WZR4,"In order to understand this movie you have to understand the situation of the Chechnya war.  This movie shows how a soldier's mother tries everything  in order to help save her son.  This movie shows unfair the Chechnya war  was.  It shows how Russian army doesn't really care about it's soldiers.  It shows how the Chechnians will do anything in order to get what they  want.  This movie is hard to watch.  A lot of people may dislike this  movie, but that's only because they don't like to look at realism.",966297600,11,508,4.483516483516484

1366539,5,B00004WZR4,"Loosely inspired by one of Chekov's short stories, (I think it was 'The Wedding') where-in a Tsarist soldier escapes captivity by similar mountain people in very similar circumstances, this is an engrossing film as much for its portrayal of the way of life of the Caucasus muslims ---------- who have been fighting for independence from Moscow for the past 200 years or so.
For anyone interested in this eternal struggle for freedom, which occasionally captures media headlines around the world, think Beslan School debacle and massacre, the Dubrovka Theatre seige or more recently the Boston Marathon Bombings, or anyone who just wants to see a first rate bit of Russian cinema, with sub-titles in English - this is a must see.

1366543,5,B00004WZR4,"The cover of this DVD has to be one of the most misleading advertisements ever. Suggesting an up-lifting action adventure, the film is in fact an almost delicate, supremely objective yet lyrical tale of two soldiers taken hostage in the Caucasian Mountains during war with Russia. A film gratifyingly more interested in character development than action sequences.

Bodrov Sr. seems not to want to impose any kind of style on his narrative, which made me rather suspicious watching it (was the director an auteur or just an amateur?!). As if not resisting the temptation to be flamboyant and maximize tension would have made the film better rather than just more obvious. Bodrov eschews tension, even when it would be justified.

Bodrov tells his story from several perspectives rather than privileging good over bad personages. You come away understanding what's at stake for everyone involved. When justice is meted out it seems both horrific and karmically motivated. In his objectivity Bodrov reminds me especially of Otto Preminger, well-known for his refusal to privilege anyone's perspective or to simplify ambiguities of character. Both in his mis-en-scene and camera style, Bodrov is very much a classicist: the elements of cinematic style take a back seat to the story being told.

The events unfold as seen from a distance. Against the desolate and serene beauty of the Caucasian mountains the actions of men appear miniscule; an element in the landscape destined to be submerged and forgotten in its vast, super-human dimension.

The camera seems to love Sergei Bodrov Jr. (the director's son), who calls attention to himself with his luminous eyes, awkwardly ample lips, and shy, buck-toothed grin. He's got real screen presence. Or had: he died in a land-slide about six years after this while directing his own film. His body was never found.

This is a very special film about a part of the world few people will ever get to experience first-hand. By all means take the journey.

MGM has for once managed to issue a film in an immaculate and detailed transfer. Kudos!",1283990400,4,2083,5.058309037900875

1366545,5,B00004WZR4,"The movie does seem to start off a bit slow, with some plot development that is necessary but somewhat slow. Looking back, I think it is slow so the audience can develop more of an emotional bond with the characters, which is why I do not think this was such a bad thing. The film has a great ending that conveys a message heard a million times in a very unique way. The film criticizes the idea of war for war's sake in a new and touching way.
The characters and scenery are also unforgettable. Everyone changes during the film, and there is a considerable amount of character development. The scenery of Dagestan is amazing, especially considering how difficult it would be to visit there. The scenery really provides the audience a trip to the Caucasus Mountains, as real villagers were casted in the film. The real image of such a forgotten land is a gem in itself, and the story only adds to the magnificence.
The topic of war is timeless, but the lesson is still relevant today, which is also a strength of the film. Violence in the Caucasus region is becoming more and more prevalent today. Regional warfare between different Russian and Georgian clans are mainly over deep-seeded rivalries. This idea of fighting for the sheer sake of rivalry is heavily questioned in this film, and the Caucasus are possibly the best location for such a question.
Overall, this film provides a trip to the forgotten region of Dagestan, and with great stories and character development, the story is a truly unforgettable journey. The questions raised by the story are worthy of consideration, and the slow start actually only adds to the fantastic ending.",1274659200,,1647,4.7421602787456445
1366546,3,B00004WZR4,"An interesting look at war and an area of the world that most of us will never see in person.  Good performances and nice location photography on obviously a fairly low budget.  The story keeps your attention but it's a little slow paced at times, still worth the visit.  I don't speak Russian but found the English subtitles easy to follow.

A Russian friend viewed the film as well and she enjoyed it.  Her only complaint was that much of the Russian language did not always translate well into English or didn't have the same meaning as was coming up as English.",1235088000,3,565,4.5

1366551,5,B00004WZR4,"I was rather confused about ""The Prisoner of the Mountains"" from the synopsis and reviews I read.  I postponed ordering the DVD because of that.  What I saw when I finally watched the movie was one of the most outstanding anti-war movies I have seen.  I won't delve too far into the plot because what I watched took me by surprise and I wouldn't want to spoil that for anyone else.

The story is about two Russian soldiers who are captured in an ambush by Chetnyn rebels.  A Chetnyn father had asked for a hostage as ransom for his son.  He got two instead.  What happens after that point is the essence of the film.

While the storyline is very compelling, I really enjoyed the setting for the movie.  High in the Causcasion mountains in a village that couldn't have been designed by any set director, I witnessed a world that I was grateful to be able to see.  The Chetnyn village was a step back a century or so.

The events that transpired were a transcension of cultures in a way that left a lasting impression.  That impression was very satisfying but it became all the more educational with the ending.  At first I sensed a transition from hope to dispair but I understood the director's message to be that the hope is real but it will take some work by all parties.",1217894400,2,1273,4.388888888888889
1366552,5,B00004WZR4,"This was truely a good film.

WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILERS

It's a tale about Russia being at war with Chechnya.  There are two solders involved, Sasha (Oleg Menshikov, from ""Burnt by the Sun"", which I hope to God I never see), a very Chechnyan hating solder, and Vanya(Sergei Bodrov Jr, God rest his soul), a younger naive, yet more openminded solder.  They both get captured by the Chechnyans, after their platoon has been killed.

It so happens that the Chechnyan who's holding the men hostage other sons have died, except one son who is currently being held a prisoner by the Russians.  So he plans to trade the two solders for his son.

Well while they're being held prioners, some themes come into the plot.  The most important, comradeship and friendship.  Heck even Vanya falls in love with a girl who is like about 13 or 14 years old, and he's either in his late teens or his early to late twenties.  But this girl happens to be the daughter of the Chechnyan who is holding them hostage.

Vanya and Sasha must help each other escape so that they don't suffer the same fate as their platoon.

This is a very sad film that sends out the message that the Chechnyans and Russians must get along or there will be no end to this war!",1201219200,2,1233,4.455357142857143
1366553,4,B00004WZR4,"Two Russian soldiers, a seasoned sergeant and a raw recruit, are captured in an ambush by Chechen separatists during the war in Chechnya in the 90s.  The leader of the guerrillas wants the captives to exchange for his son who is being held by the Russians.  The captives are taken to a small village high in the mountains where they are chained to each other to prevent their escape.  Initially the battle-hardened, cynical sergeant has little time for the youngster, and they almost come to blows several times.  As the film develops, they develop a friendship, the sergeant becoming a mentor to the younger soldier.  We also learn a great deal about small town life of the Chechens, some of their customs and habits.  Both the Chechen and Russians develop a grudging respect for each other during their close interaction, even if they are at war.  The tense, tragic ending of the film is particularly well done.

This is nominally a war film, but there isn't very much action, it is largely character driven.  The primary interest of this film will be, for  most viewers, to see and experience some of the moral complexities of the Chechen war from a Russian perspective.  From an American's perspective, many of the issues discussed in this film are probably relevant the US occupation of Iraq and (more directly relevant) Afghanistan.  The political issues surrounding the war are not discussed at all, this is really a study of the effect of the war on those who actually have to do the fighting and dying.  I think some of the most glowing reviews overrate this film a bit (it isn't something you are going to watch over and over again), but it is still a very nice story.  The developing, complex relationships between the captives and their captors are well portrayed.  These are a people at war, but both sides come to realize that the others are not animals.  The cinematography is outstanding.  I never realized how bleak and forboding the landscape of the Caucasus was (having never been there myself).  This alone is worth the price of admission.

Bottom line - not destined to be an all time classic, but definitely worth a look, particularly if you want to learn a little bit about Chechnya or the Russian-Chechan war.",1196467200,,2233,4.753246753246753
1366554,4,B00004WZR4,"I first saw this film in the spring of 2001 in my Modern Russian Culture class and enjoyed it, so it was a pleasure to finally revisit it so many years later, particularly since it stars two of the best Russian actors in recent times, Oleg Menshikov and Sergey Bodrov, Jr. (who would star together again three years later in 'East-West').  Though it's never explicitly spelled out, we know that this is set during the disastrous Chechen conflict and takes place in Chechnya.  People used to American war movies might complain because it seems pretty slow-paced in comparison, with not a lot of action, but that's because this is a character-driven film.  It proceeds at the leisurely pace so we can get to know the characters and watch as their relationships unfold.  It makes the viewer think about things like the futility of war, whether there really are clear-cut good guys and bad guys, and what happens when cultures collide.

Private Ivan Zhilin (Vanya), played by Bodrov, has just joined the Army and been sent into Chechnya.  Not long after arriving, his party is ambushed, and only he and the sergeant, Aleksandr Kostylin (Sasha), played by Menshikov, are left alive.  The two of them are taken prisoner by the rebels.  Normally they'd only take one hostage, but this time they decide to take both in case one of them should die of his injuries before they're able to use them as a bargaining chip.  They end up in chains in the house of Abdul Murat, whose son has been taken prisoner by the Russians.  While in captivity, these two soldiers, who are complete opposites, find themselves developing an unlikely friendship, with Sasha even becoming a bit of a father figure to Vanya, who doesn't have a father.  They also develop unlikely friendships with Hasan, the tongueless man who is guarding them, and Dina, Abdul's beautiful 13 year old daughter.  The plot thickens when Abdul orders them to write to their mothers asking them to come to the area and ask for a prisoner exchange.  Sasha doesn't have parents, but Vanya's mother is absolutely devoted to him, and he is confident that she's going to come through for him no matter what.  Overall, it shows the human side of war instead of endless battles and an us vs. them mentality, nor does it have the typical ending one would expect from an American film.  The photography is also absolutely gorgeous.

This film is highly recommended to those who are interested in anti-war films, particularly when they're such a radical change of pace from the types of films made in Hollywood.  The acting is also first-rate, in spite of not being a very action-packed film.  It's a pity so few of the films of Oleg Menshikov and Sergey Bodrov, Jr. are available in the West.  Menshikov had been established as one of Russia's best younger actors for awhile, but this was only Bodrov's second film, and helped to make him one of Russia's most popular rising young stars.  Knowing he was killed in an avalanche in September of 2002 at the age of only 30 makes watching some parts of this film, given the perceived nearness of death and the topics of conversation the characters sometimes have, even sadder and more poignant.  What a waste of looks and talent.  Also very notable is the young woman playing Dina, the Chechen girl who forms an unlikely friendship with Vanya and whom Vanya falls in love with.  And what with barely any films having been made about the Chechen war, this can help to give the Western viewer an insightful look into what it was all about, beyond simplistic media headlines.",1187049600,,3556,4.72771474878444
1366555,3,B00004WZR4,"I liked this movie, but the soundtrack was horrible. Very loud and soft. Had the volume at ""59"" on my sound scale a number of times. The acting and the plot were memorable. The scenery brings the rugged countryside to life. Oleg Menshikov was excellent as always. All the actors were perfect in their roles.",1174521600,,307,4.6
1366556,4,B00004WZR4,"Like many of the other reviewers, I went into the movie thinking it would be about the horrors of war. But it was much more than that. It was a story about prejudices and how they can exacerbate already terrible situations. It was remarkable to see the interactions between the Chechens and their Russian prisoner. On a human level, they were so similar. In another life, they could have been friends. But in that moment, they were enemies, and no matter how comfortable each were acting, you could tell they never forgot that.

The movie started out very slow, but toward the middle it started to pick up. There were some very funny moments. I'm not sure they were supposed to be funny, but I had a good laugh. Overall, not a bad movie, but not for everybody.",1165104000,3,760,4.507246376811594
1366557,5,B00004WZR4,"The movie brought the Chechan Conflict into perspective for me. Two Russian soldiers, a seasoned fighter Sasha and a new trainee Vanya, are captured by a Chechen Soldier  Abdul. Abdul hopes to trade Sasha and Vanya for his son  who had been imprisoned by the Russian army. As the characters of the soldiers and the villagers develop, the Chechan and the Russian Soldiers come to appreciate one another.

The movie was great. I am not into war movies but this movie had an actual story line and a great ending. I give the movie A-.",1164585600,3,530,4.557894736842106
1366558,4,B00004WZR4,"Set in a small village in Chechnya, Prisoner of the Mountains isn't so much a war film as it is a drama.  Going into the movie I expected to see a lot more action but it was pleasantly surprising to watch a film based on social interaction between cultures.  There are brief moments of action during the film, including the ambush at the beginning and the two soldiers attempt at escaping.  But for the most part the movie focuses on the interactions between the various characters.  I found myself more interested in Dina, the young daughter of Abdul.  Abdul is an older man who decides to capture Vanya and Sacha in an attempt to trade them for his son in the local prison.

Throughout the film you begin to sympathize for all the characters and their different circumstances.  But for me, I was most sympathetic to Dina.  She had gone through so much in her life that she almost seemed numb to it all.  Mentioning that her fathers aid Hasan had murdered his wife after she cheated on him, she casually throws in there that it was her sister.  I found her situation quite sad and to me, Dina was the prisoner of the mountains.",1160870400,5,1128,4.458536585365854
1366559,2,B00004WZR4,"This is a film about two soldiers captured during the Chechen war.  Normally the Chechen rebels don't take prisoners but one of the men is hoping to trade the soldiers for his son who is being held by the Russians.  As time passes the younger of the two soldiers, Ivan, begins to feel for the rebels and to wish he could live among them.  The soldiers are told to write to their families and have them ask the commander to trade them for the rebel's son.  Ivan's mother tries but ultimately fails in her attempt.  Eventually the rebels get tired to waiting and kill the older soldier.  Ivan gets free and runs for the hills ending the movie with his escape.",1160524800,,657,4.3884297520661155
1366560,2,B00004WZR4,I thought this movie was decent but nothing spectacular.  It kept me awake but just on the verge.  The few comical scenes helped to keep me interested as did the totally unexpected ending which was probably the best part of the entire movie.  I thought the acting in this movie was just mediocre at best. Overall I was not impressed with the movie but the few good scenes earned it two stars over just the lonely one star.,1160524800,,422,4.384615384615385
1366561,5,B00004WZR4,"I was impressed with the prisoner of the mountains from the beginning.  The miltiary aspect of the movie drew me in from the start. I didn't expect the ambush to occur as fast as it did in the movie, very exciting however.  The movie wasn't choppy or boring, nor did the subtitles really bother me.  It was easy to understand and like actually.  The roles seemed to be well researched, the Sergeant was infact a rough around the edges NCO type, that treated his subordinant exactly as a Sergeant would.  Funniest moment in the movie in my opinion, also which added alot of humor was when they found the cache of alcohol in the barn.  I laughed pretty hard when they offered their guard a drink.

I thoughth the movie seemed alittle long while waiting for the privates mother to come to the region.  They didn't plot out their escape in great detail, simply break the chain and run.  I enjoyed the action at times, nothing quite as exciting as seeing troop carriers, AK-47's and high ranking officers get sucking chest wounds at the hands of old men.

Overall I would highly recommend prisoner of the mountains, it really showed how men in captivity who hate each other (well the sergeant anyway) bond to escape.  Beyond that it an Ambush, escapes, killing, drinking, and isn't to boring.  Favorite Line-- ""whats your name again I forgot""...  you think after so much time in captivity the sergeant would finally know the privates name.  But I guess thats asking too much.",1160524800,,1470,4.647286821705427
1366562,4,B00004WZR4,"The storyline of the movie is a simple one: two soldiers are captured by people who live in the mountains. The leader of the people of the mountains wants to trade them for his son, who is in prison. So the leader tells the two captured men to write their mothers and tell them to come and get them and they will make a deal, and so on and so forth.

The movie is not one of the greatest movies that I have seen, but it was not a terrible piece. The ending is great and completely unexpected. And, I'm not sure if it's just me, but the plot and character motivation seemed to be derived from the viewer's common sense rather than from any real motive in the movie. For example the older soldier kills a sheep herder; the whole exchange seems like something out of Monty Python. Throughout the movie there is a sense of humor, me and the person i watched it with were laughing hysterically at a few scenes (most notable when the prisoners get drunk) and at random times throughout.

Overall the film gave off a surrealist feel. It never quite seemed real at all. The exchanges between the characters just keep getting more and more unrealistic (i'm not sure if the writer planned that or not, but it does seem to lag near the end). The movie definitely loses points on that front.

Also there never seemed to be any real connection between things. The beginning threw me off, and when they attacked them and brought them back on horses that threw me off. It was somewhat difficult to get into the movie, but once it got going it was easier to watch, then it drug and then it was over. Not a recipe for success in my eyes. Although I'm not sure if that is the way Russian cinema is, but that certainly isn't the way American cinema runs, at least not the kind that is deemed of good quality.

But overall I would recommend watching it, it is a good movie. But be sure you're watching it with someone else so that you are able to laugh with them and share a few raised eyebrows at the plot and how doesn't seem to be realistic.",1160438400,,2024,4.276762402088773
1366563,3,B00004WZR4,"Prisoner of the Mountains does not focus on the events of the Chechen war, but tells the story of two Russians that were captured by Abdul Marat to be exchanged for his son.  The movie chooses a different depiction of the war, as the two prisoners develop friendships with, each other,  their captives, including those within the village that would rather kill the Russians than offer them hospitality, and the other Chechen villagers; while their Russian commanders ignore their plight.

 Sacha, the older, more experienced soldier, despises the younger Vanya at the beginning of the movie.  Believing that they will be executed, he insults the younger soldier's honor and his ability to fight.  By the end of the movie, the two are friends, having been forced to be together since their captivity.

 Throughout the movie, the two soldiers develop friendships with their captives.  Originally captured to be exchanged for a Russian prisoner, they become fast friends with their guard Hasan, as well as Dina, the daughter of Adbdul Marat, becomes infatuated with Vanya.  The villagers who had originally wanted to kill them, were warmed by the courage that the two prisoners had when faced with hand-to-hand combat with the Chechen rebels, as well as enjoyed the technical skills that fixed the seemingly random requirements of the village.  Meanwhile, the Russian military command was depicted as unwilling to assist the two captives.

 As Abdul Marat attempts to barter for the release of his son, the Russian response was half-hearted.  At one point, the two forces approached each other to trade the prisoners, yet the Russians were not observed to be carrying their prisoner, thus the Chechens did not come forward to carry out the deal.  Aiming for an emotional impact, Marat asks the prisoners to write their mothers, and Vanya's mother arrives to ask the Russian commanders to negotiate again, and they inform her that they have written off her son and see any future negotiations as fruitless.

 Although Abdul Marat's son is killed while attempting to escape, Vanya successfully escapes and is reunited with his mother.",1160438400,,2129,5.106936416184971
1366564,3,B00004WZR4,"Before watching this movie I thought it was a war movie. But in reality it was story about people, both Russian and Chechen. There really isn`t any battle scenes expect the one in the beginning.

Two most important characters in the movie are the Russian soldiers, who are captured by a Chechen man. They are strangers at the beginning, but being captured together forces them to get to know each other. They become friends -or last something like that.

There are some powerful women roles in this movie. The Chechen girl Dina is by far the best character in this movie. She is young but strong. (The actress was only 13 when the movie was filmed; she did a really good job). I also liked Vanya`s mother -she didn`t settle for the answers she got from Russian army and tried to do something by herself.

Scenery is this film was really beautiful with the mountains and small Chechen village in the middle of nowhere.",1160265600,,917,4.579268292682927
1366565,4,B00004WZR4,"Two Russian soldiers (Oleg Menshikov & Sergei Bodrov, Jr.) are taken prisoner in a remote Muslim village by a man (Dzhemal Sikharulidze) who wishes to exchange them for his imprisoned son.  During their captivity, both the Russians and their Muslim captors begin to appreciate the humanity in each other.  However, the war continues to exert its dehumanizing influence, pressuring everyone concerned to follow the path of violence.  When one character makes a quiet break from this pattern, it is a small triumph in this low-key but affecting film.  Though it is never referred to explicitly (at least not in the subtitles), this is clearly intended as a story of the Chechen conflict, even though it is based on a novella by Leo Tolstoy.  It is amazing how timely it remains.  The cast of mostly nonprofessional actors delivers marvelously natural performances.",1136678400,2,862,5.121428571428571
1366566,4,B00004WZR4,"THE STORY: Two Russian soldiers are taken hostage by a small Chechen establishment. The idea was to trade them for the POW son of one of the Chechen men.

WHAT'S GOOD: The soundtrack is amazing. The filming is simple, raw and honest. This is not a special effects war movie. It's a story about friendship and breaking down barriers between people that technically should not be associating.

STANDOUT CHARACTERS: The young Russian soldier does a good job of being innocent and naive..The girl who plays the Chechen Dina..she's memorable. Hasan, with his tongue cut off by the Russians, somehow makes up for the fact that he has no audible means of communicating.

WHO IS IT FOR: Not for people who can't follow subtitles, and knowing a little Russian helped me when all the words were not translated. Definitely not for anyone seeking a high paced, blood and guts war movie.",1127433600,10,874,4.8133333333333335
1366567,3,B00004WZR4,"I personally believe that some background information about the current situation in Russia is essential for the viewer to get a full grip of this movie. Though it is possible to say that it lacks artistic sophistication, the Prisoner of the Mountains is a film which takes the viewer all the way into a world unknown, a world which fortunately fails to link with the superficial environment and rotten values of the modern man.

It would be worthwhile to keep in mind that this is one of those movies which mean more or less nothing if not watched in original language.",1112486400,4,570,4.643564356435643
1366577,5,B00004WZR4,"Sergei Bodrov has made a film which captivates the viewer. The two young Russians, soldier Vanya and sergeant Sasha are captured by Chechen guerillas during an ambush and they are held in a mountainous muslim village in order to be exchanged with a Chechen prisoner. Their stay among the Chechens will cause very different sentiments to each one: Vanya will come to admire them and even fall in love with a young girl, despite the imminent danger, while Sasha tries to uphold the image of the tough and dedicated Russian military man who does not yeld to the enemy. Their story takes an unexpected and tragic turn when they try to escape, but the finale is also dramatic. I found the most touching scene in a minor episode, when the two prisoners sit back to back on a rooftop looking at the surrounding mountains and the village and Sasha starts to sing a military song (V. Agapkin's immortal ""Farewell to the Slavonian girl"") which goes to a magnificent musical crescento while the sergeant tries to stop his tears, tame his fear and pull himself together.",1101686400,12,1058,4.724324324324324
1366578,5,B00004WZR4,"This film is absolutly amazing. Everything fits together, from the soundtrack, to the action, to the perfectly balanced love interest. It delves into a sensitive subject without seeming to be preachy or overly romantic or anything like that.
An Americanized audience may have trouble with this movie. One of the most frequent complaints I hear is that it is 'slow moving.' It is true that since the film is character driven, there are many long scenes of contemplation, just watching the character's face to see his reaction to something. And while that may appear 'boring' to an audience accustomed to something blowing up every couple minutes, it does really make you appreciate and sympathize with the characters.
This DVD is in the original Russian with English subtitles. I was overjoyed at this because many of my favorite foreign films can only be bought here in a dubbed version, and those just never do justice to the originals. The only extra on the disk is the English trailer.
If you want to see a really good movie and don't mind reading subtitles, watch this one.",1097020800,29,1077,4.858695652173913
1366579,5,B00004WZR4,"If there were an annual international awards ceremony exclusively for films about war, the Russians would maul us Americans every time. In the case of ""Prisoner of the Mountains,"" they walk away with best director, best actor, best supporting cast, and best script I've seen in years.

 One of the most effective film techniques used by the Euros and Russians are the avoidance of close-ups in favor of medium shots, which allow the actors to say more with their bodies and which at the same time places them within a socio-historical context. I have yet to see a scene more moving than the one in which the two Russian soldiers, apparently having been abandoned in captivity by their own government, pass the time by dancing to the American spiritual ""Let My People Go."" Anyone who can remain dry-eyed during that sequence should ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.

 In powerful yet beautifully understated performances, the entire cast fills the viewer with a sense of the strength of humanity. Truly a masterpiece!",1091404800,18,1016,4.855491329479769

After all it is a war flick.  It will make you think, cringe, laugh, and then think some more.  A very Russian quality that Menshikov does a excellent job of conveying.  It is subtle at one time and bowl you over at the next.  Hollywood could learn something from this movie.  It is that good and well worth the subtitles.

1366586,5,B00004WZR4,"This beautiful award winner moves me every time I watch it, and there are scenes that are forever etched in my mind.
Taking place in Chechnya, it has the same Central Asian rugged terrain that we've seen in recent news stories of Afghanistan, one of the many reasons that makes this an interesting film to view...a glimpse into what is an enigmatic part of the world for most of us.
The cinematography (Pavel Lebeshev) and soundtrack (Leonid Desyatnikov) are marvelous, and the performances perfect. How director Sergei Bodrov managed to get such fine acting from the local villagers (like Susanna Mekhalieva, who plays ""Dina""), is a marvel. As the two soldiers tied by fate, he cast his son, Sergei Bodrov Jr., and Oleg Menshikov (who was so brilliant in ""Burnt by the Sun""), and they are superb.
Losely based on Tolstoy's tale for children, ""Prisoner of the Caucausus"", it's a film full of compassion and love, and has plot subtleties that make this rare gem of a film deserve several viewings.",1003363200,57,996,4.830409356725146

7925773,5,B00004WZR4,"A candidate for one of the top films of all time! I have watched my DVD three times, and I think I need to watch it three more, at least, before I see all the things I need to see in this complex and sophisticated movie. I have to laugh at the reviewers who say it starts slowly. (Spoiler?) , because it begins with a tasteful and lovely scene of nudity--young men walking through the steps of their medical exam to see if they are ""fit for duty."" They place their hands carefully to prevent this nudity from being complete--a sensible alternative to having to take clothes off and on over and over. To an American, at least, nude scenes do not seem ""slow.""

The movie has plenty of violence and rude language, which does limit the audience, but to those who are old and ""adult"" enough to watch it, it is unforgettable!.",1454371200,2,820,4.359477124183006

It is set in the first Chechan war and two Russian soldiers are captured to ransom a Chechan school teacher.  The Russians spend a lengthy time with the Chechans in their village and learn about the lives they live eeking out a life in the mountains.  There are many moments of great poignancy.  The ending is not expected to those not familiar with the first chechan war.  The fact that the story is told by a Russian Director and actors is amazing.

A girl will capture your heart through her surrender to the fact that brutality is unavoidable as the mountains that surround her life. Yet, in every scene humanity comes to the foreground, via our common drives to survive, to love, to feel--joy or sorrow.
Superb landscape and music. Enjoy the movie.",1353110400,,537,4.78494623655914
