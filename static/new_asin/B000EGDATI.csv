8109060,2,B000EGDATI,"It's a book of Hans Christian Andersen cartoons, but the animation is pretty lame and the animated stories lack something major that the written stories created. It's possible to do, but this animated collection did not follow through.",1409184000,,235,5.2105263157894735
8109061,5,B000EGDATI,"This is awsome, my girls adore these dvd's so do I, I like the british accents too.",1257465600,,83,3.9411764705882355
8109062,3,B000EGDATI,"I didn't really know what to expect from this DVD, but what the short description said. Didn't know it would just be a burned copy of someone's personal video of the events. It's edited pretty well, and flows ok, but it's not anything crazy professional.
I expected more from this DVD, but all in all, if you're a huge Disney or Disneyland fan, you'll enjoy it.",1242604800,,361,4.484848484848484
8109063,5,B000EGDATI,"Let's start with the:

Pros: Beautiful animation, solid story-telling in the spirit of HC Andersen, impressive opening scenes and narration, good box quality, colorful 6-page episode list and nine (9) colorful discs.

Cons: Price... $10 more and this will reach a hundred dollars. Outer episode guide is in paper and placed in the back of the box making it subject to easy tearing when the box gets moved around. Discs are placed in ordinary plastic CD jackets instead of thinkpaks (slimpacks) and this is a $90 item! :\

So what does this DVD box set offer? A lot in terms of telling great and classical fairytales. The animation is colorful enough to get the attention of kids. They are rich and vibrant which reminded me of backgrounds made by Hayao Miyazaki (""Spirited Away""). The voice-overs are perfect and well-suited for the characters portayed. Most of all, they end up with a good morale story.

All in all, this is a great DVD set and worth getting. Your kids will defintely have a great time watching this set.",1218326400,12,1022,4.757062146892656
8109064,5,B000EGDATI,"When the below reviewer says its ""not great animation"", what I think she means is it's not DIGITAL animation. This series is less in the tradition of ""Cars"" and ""Antz"" and more like ""Redwall"" or the old ""Sleepy Hollow"" movie that I grew up with.

The stories themselves are interesting little parables that even adults can appreciate. In fact, it has given me a whole new respect for Andersen and the seemingly simplistic art of the fairy tale.

These are great little DVDs to put in on a cozy, rainy day and watch with your kids!",1185062400,14,530,4.510416666666667
8109065,4,B000EGDATI,"I just received this set of DVD.  I gave only 4 stars because when I try to watch on my laptop, the picture makes me giddy.  But when I switch it to watch on TV, the picture is good.  The story are in british english.  I wish they do have subtitle for this DVD.",1165017600,4,261,3.7777777777777777
