3063274,5,B00118VEGY,"I'm very picky about TV, but this show is hilarious. The originality, cleverness, and above all humor of the writing was a pleasant surprise, plus it's nice to see a cast of women allowed to be funny, crass, and violent without apologizing. I remember reading some tagline comparing it to Desperate Housewives, but I say nerts to that! It's better! I'm so bored with the numerous depictions of women as materialistic, fashion, man, and money obsessed, with some half hearted message of female empowerment shoe horned in. The women of ""Suburban"" are gangster cliches wrapped in house wife cliches, and the actresses bring heaps of fun and charisma to each character. It's just completely driven by ridiculous humor and surprises. So totally worth checking out!

...plus, I love Bill and Jewel. He's super funny and adorable, and she's completely nuts. They're great :)",1315008000,2,867,5.062937062937063

3063277,4,B00118VEGY,"This UK comedy series takes a dark look at the competitiveness between wives in a small British town.  A couple from the city end up in the burbs and things are not simple.

3063278,2,B00118VEGY,"My husband and I love the baudy British shows, but this was a disappointment. The storyline is uneven, implausible and the dialog mumbled...no subtitles, unforunately. The premise is that in this sleepy little English village, the housewives have formed two rival gangs who battle with each other for turf and new members. Sounds hilarious, doesn't it? We thought so, but the newcomer is portrayed as a wide eyed innocent who is hoodwinked into doing very bad things. She can't tell because her policeman husband would lock her up. She is so appalled and shocked all the time, that she seems to have wandered off of a more serious show. I wish the writers had just had the sense to work her into the story in a more believable way...say, have her rescued from harm by one of the housewife gangs, as it is her very important main character just doesn't work.
When all is said and done, I think the writers, two men by the way, wrote out some male fantasies about women with guns, and then just didn't know where to go. In the hands of better writers, this could have been a truly funny show.",1217721600,2,1090,4.538071065989848
