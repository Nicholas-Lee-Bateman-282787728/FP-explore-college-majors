3093443,2,B0012Q732O,"In a nutshell: This movie was long and boring. There were many wasted scenes with pointless activities during the movie, where I had to wonder what the hell was going on. I kept seeing this old woman who kept almost dying (eventually she did), and a bunch of people in some barbaric activities. To me this movie was a dissapointment, and was almost impossible to follow. I have to admit, the fight scenes are awesome, but they are few and far in between in this movie, and you have to sit and wait for them to come. I mean the movie was about 1 hour and 45 minutes, but if those waisted scenes were trimmed, it would have been cut down to an hour. Thats how long and boring this movie was. Either way, I cannot recommend this movie, or atleast wait for it to come on DVD so you can rent it. Peace.",1205020800,2,797,4.181818181818182
3093444,3,B0012Q732O,"About a year ago I saw a teaser for this movie and I must say it really got me excited.  I think, however, the preview is a bit misleading and I will wager that a lot of men are gonna be complaining after seeing this movie, which disquised itself as an action film, and is in truth at its core, a love story.

  The story follows D'leh (played by actor Steven Strait) a young man who lives in a snowy village of hunters.  The villagers have been slowly loosing their food supply (wooly mammoths) and the leader of the people, a woman called Old Mother, prophesies the rise of a leader during the last hunt of her people.  She makes this prophesy after a small group of hunters bring to the village a young girl with piercing blue eyes, called Evolet, who was abandoned after her people were killed by four legged demons (men on horses).  Over time, D'leh and Evolet fall in love and part of the prophesy is that the man who rises up to lead their people will also take Evolet as his wife.

  After the men on horses arrive and take many of the villagers, including Evolet, D'leh and his mentor, Tic Tic, follow the captors and their new slaves in hopes of freeing their family and friends.  Along the way, they come across other tribes who have also been attacked and enslaved by the mauraders and whose remaining members will join the fight if their own prophesy of a warrior to lead them comes true (which, does indeed with D'leh).  The rest of the story is these men trying to find a way to retrieve the slaves from the huge city occupied by the mysterious men who enslave the tribesmen and villagers to build their expanding empire.  And, for D'leh, to free the girl with whom he bonded years ago and swore his love.

  The whole time I was watching this film I was struck at how similar the plot is to Mel Gibson's ""Apocalypto"", which is a much better film.  That said, I don't think its as horrible as some reviewers are posting but its not the action-packed, prehistoric war epic I think many fan boys were hoping for.  The saber tooth tiger, which looked so awesome and fearful in the teaser, basically had a cameo but the scenes with the mammoths were impressive and great to watch.  Steven Strait, the lead actor is a handsome, charming guy who may have a career ahead of him.  I think he has possiblity, if given time to work on his acting.  The rest of the cast did fairly well in their roles but its more of a popcorn summer film that relies heavily on action sequences and special effects.  If you are in the mood for something to watch, its an okay movie to see.  But you might prefer to stay at home at wait for the dvd release.",1205020800,3,2644,4.318458417849898
3093445,2,B0012Q732O,"If you have seen the many trailers you have pretty much seen all the special effects this film has to offer. The rest is filled with bad dialogue and some pathetic acting. The woolly mammoths are the best looking SFX creatures in the film, but the saber-toothed tiger was barely even in the movie at all. I might say it's worth a DVD rental in the future, but nothing more.",1204934400,11,373,4.3428571428571425
3093446,2,B0012Q732O,"I went to this movie expecting it to be a fantasy; therefore, I suspended my logic. I just wanted to enjoy the special effects. They turned out to be a mixed bag. They are riveting, and look real in the scenes where the doldos (giant birds) chase and kill the men. The mastodons look impressive and convincing too. However the saber-toothed tiger look obviously fake. The ending scenes where the pyramid was being built are one of the most spectacular I ever seen. It looks huge, lively and beautiful.

The plot is an exact copy of Apocalypto. Yet this film does not have the suspense and intensity of Apocalypto. The acting is not convincing either. At the end, a few people laughed when the female character was resurrected from her death but I didn't mind. I had already expected it to be a fantasy.

Overall, it's worth watching once for curiosity. Everybody who likes dinosaurs will certainly wants to see this picture. As for me, after seeing this, I pulled out the DVD copies of ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" from BBC and viewed them. They look  real and much more interesting.",1204934400,2,1079,4.668421052631579
3093447,2,B0012Q732O,"I deliberately chose to watch this movie on a languid afternoon because I expected it not to be intellectually challenging and it happened to be true.  To a certain extent, it felt like Acapalypto but it didn't have the intensity.  It felt like an epic National Geographic's special on an IMAX screen.  The tour started in New Zealand and the Maori actors, actresses and the Central Otago scenery betrayed the location.  The special effect was less than perfect and in many scenes, we could detect that the performance was acted in front of a green or blue screen.  As the main character chased after his girl to a warmer climate, that's when we shifted the focal point to Africa and ended up in Egypt.  The greatest flaw of the movie was having the characters speaking English as if it's already been established as the lingua franca of its time.  Then, there were scenes of sabre tooth, mammoths, giant vultures and doldos which didn't seem to fit in with geography of places that they went to.  The soundtrack was a bit syrupy for my liking and just imagine if Hans Zimmer was used instead, it would have increased the impact quite significantly.  The script wasn't tight at all and the dialogues were corny at best.  Cliff Curtis, arguably the veteran among the youngsters here added a bit of grunt and screen presence.  Otherwise, the rest were simply bubble-ish and forgettable at best.  There were instances we were reminded that we were back in Jurassic Park, Godzilla or even King Kong with the stampede scene.  I think Roland has the same problem that George Lucas might have during filming of Star Wars where technology ruled supreme whilst character development was relegated to second priority.  Amid the tight structure that's imposed into this movie, there's no much margin the crew could really work on.  As a result, the overall performance became rather trite and wooden.  It really could have been better.  Alas, another hit and miss.  The best way to enjoy this movie is not to have any expectation at all prior to watching the movie.  By the way, Omar Sharif's narration was overcooked too!",1204934400,2,2111,4.781767955801105
3093448,4,B0012Q732O,"I don't think anything about Roland Emmerich's ""10,000 B.C."" is accurate, historically, geographically, or culturally. But who cares? I see these movies to be entertained, not to be enlightened. Indeed, this is Emmerich's most entertaining film since ""Independence Day,"" to say absolutely nothing of ""Godzilla,"" ""The Patriot,"" or ""The Day After Tomorrow."" This isn't to say that it's a masterpiece or even that it's great. In all likelihood, it will be completely forgotten ten years from now. But as long as we do know about it, we might as well make the most of what it has to offer; ""10,000 B.C."" is a mindless adventure epic that achieves exactly what it wants to achieve without laboring over complicated details. The special effects and the action effectively serve as padding for a story so paper-thin and routine that it goes well beyond an archetypal clich.

How could I possibly recommend a film like that? That's easy: I knew ahead of time to not expect cinematic genius. If you hope to get anything out of it, I recommend you do the same thing. Not that there's much to get out of it, anyway. The story is about as simple as they get, boiling down to a hero on a journey to save the woman he loves. Taking place in the distant past (and you'll forgive me if I don't take the film's title seriously), it begins when a young girl is brought to live among the people of a mountain tribe. As the sole survivor of massacre, she sets into motion a prophecy stated by the wise elder, called Old Mother (Mona Hammond)--a warrior will prove himself upon the return of the now-elusive mastodons, meaning that the girl will forever be his. But this will not happen for a long time, so naturally, years pass for the sake of the story. As adults, the girl--Evolet (Camilla Belle)--and the destined warrior--D'Leh (Steven Strait)--address each other kindly yet distantly, rubbing in the fact that he has yet to become what he was destined to be.

After slaying a mastodon in a long-winded hunting sequence, D'Leh is awarded with his tribe's special spear, a long stick topped with pointy animal bones. He feels unworthy, not only because the mastodon's death was more of a fluke, but also because of his past. His father abandoned the tribe years ago, leaving D'Leh feeling ashamed about his own existence. All that changes when a warring tribe attacks the village and kidnaps almost everyone, including Evolet; D'Leh and his surrogate father Tic'Tic (Cliff Curtis) are determined to save their people, even if it means traveling for weeks over steep mountains, through cold snows, through hot jungles, and across arid deserts. They face all four conditions on their journey, and that makes me wonder what region of the world this film takes place in, since (1) no such place exists in real life, and (2) they end up in Ancient Egypt. Never mind--I forgot that I'm not supposed to question this movie.

Evolet, meanwhile, is in the clutches of a tribe who make it its mission to gather slaves. A deep-voiced warlord (Affif Ben Badra) has taken a special liking to Evolet, especially since she has a rebellious streak (she's been dropping items on the ground for D'Leh to follow, like a trail of breadcrumbs). He tries to reassure her with calming words, no small task considering he speaks a foreign language she's not familiar with. By the time they reach Egypt, we begin to wonder whether or not we're supposed to hate him. It's quite possible he was meant to be somewhat of a sympathetic character, despite kidnapping Evolet and whipping her hands for being sneaky.

D'Leh and Tic'Tic eventually team up with a warrior tribe. This is for reasons other than a connection between the tribe and D'Leh's father; D'Leh is able to tame the heart of a saber-tooth tiger with no effort at all. Apparently, this tribe had prophesized the arrival of The One Who Speaks to the Spear-Tooth, and this is why they welcome him with open arms. D'Leh soon befriends Nakudu (Joel Virgil), the one member that conveniently speaks many languages; together, they convince a number of neighboring tribes to join forces. Thus the foundation is laid for the final major sequence, which sees D'Leh in Ancient Egypt fighting a group of slave-owners claiming to serve a living god.

I can describe the plot until I'm blue in the face, but to really understand how derivative and mindless this movie is, you will have to see it for yourself. ""10,000 B.C."" is like a summer-popcorn version of Mel Gibson's ""Apocalypto,"" with everything even remotely complex and meaningful stripped away for the sake of action and special effects. But again, who cares? If the ads haven't made it clear by now, this was never meant to be a compelling human drama, even with Omar Sharif's continuous narration. It's an escapist movie and nothing more. It's meant to be entertaining, and to hell with pesky details like originality, character development, and substance. Yes, it would be easy to tear this film apart, but since it's not trying to be anything more than what it is, maybe we should just leave it alone. At the very least, we were spared a sequel to ""Godzilla."" Surely something can be said for that.",1204848000,10,5167,4.781634938409854
3093449,4,B0012Q732O,"First of all, the movie is great.  The epic nature, the chases, the battles, everything is done to the max.  The viewer can really get the feel of living eons ago, with the struggles of daily life.  I truly enjoyed the entire movie.

However, it may as well have been called Apocalypto II.

A village of people lives peacefully enough.  They hunt giant mastadons and their entire way of life is dependent upon the yearly migration of the beasts.  Basically it's the B.C. version of the tatanka from ""Dances With Wolves"".  Each year the hunt gets more and more difficult, and the hunger of the village follows downward.  They must use their specially honed hunting tactics to take down their prey (Apocalypto!).  Unfortunately, the wise, witchdoctor woman - who apparently is capable of some serious magic - prophecizes that with the last hunt comes the end of their way.

Actually, this movie is so full of mysticism, voodoo, mumbo-jumbo, signs, and legends that it's a little bit much to digest.  It seems that everyone in the movie has some kind of tale to tell.

Anyway, the hunters from this village, who all vie for the sign of dominance in the village (the white spear), are not able to stop a group of hunter-collectors from a far away land from capturing many of their people during a raid (Apocalypto!).  It's up to a select few to chase after the enemies, and free their loved ones (Apocalypto!).

Along the way the protagonist encounters a great sabertooth tiger who is trapped under a log, in a giant pit, and about to drown (Apocalypto!)  The hero saves the beast and becomes some kind of prehistoric Dr. Doolittle.

Naturally, they gather hundreds of warriors from neighboring tribes as they march on through snow, a jungle, as well as a desert.  And when they finally catch up to the abductors, they just happen to find thousands of slaves being used to build the great pyramids (Apocalypto!).  Before they are able to gather all of their strength, and convince the slaves to revolt, one of the members from the village is sacrificed (Apocalypto!).

Eventually the overthrow happens, the bad guys lose and their leader suffers a demoralizing death (Apocalypto!), the good guys use their previously established hunting tricks against their enemies (Apocalypto!), and the star returns to his home to begin anew (Apocalypto!).

The movie is incredibly worthwhile, told fairly well, with superb acting and action.  It's just a shameless Apocalypto ripoff is all.",1204848000,8,2473,4.880095923261391
3093450,4,B0012Q732O,"The trailers for 10,000 B.C. says ""...Journey back to a time of darkness, Journey to a world lost in time"" and boy oh boy, do you journey. From the opening of the film you are swept up into a stone age village in the lofty peaks of the Himalayas, next a jungle filled with prehistoric creatures, then it is an African desert plain complete with a saber-tooth tiger, all before coming to the banks of the Nile to witness the building of the Great Pyramid. All this and more is delivered to you in the diverse locations covered in 10,000 B.C. a film about the beginning of time and civilization.

The film opens with narration from Omar Sharif and the story begins in a tiny mountain top village of mammoth hunters which is ravaged by ""four-legged demons"" (Hun-style soldiers on horses) who capture and kill most of the villagers, save for a handful. Among that handful is a man, D'leh (played by Steven Strait), whose lover, Evolet (played by Camilla Belle) was among the many dragged off as slaves. D'leh and two other warriors waste no time in setting off in hot pursuit of demon raiders. So the journey starts as they trek across every possible extreme landscape up until they find their villagers have been put to work as slaves to build the Great Pyramid. As the three warriors plan a way to free them they are joined by thousands of other African tribe warriors who have also lost loved ones to the slave-seeking raiders, and the final climax is one spectacular epic battle atop the pyramids including more mammoths (they apparently helped the Egyptians pull the massive stones to build the pyramids, debunking the long held theory that aliens did!).

10,000 B.C. is complete eye-candy with its' extravagant CGI, vast sets, detailed costumes, and sweeping cinematography. The acting is average, nothing amazing, but nothing bad. The script is very basic but it works because you would not expect our prehistoric ancestors to break out in eloquent or snappy dialogue.

Overall I was highly entertained and satisfied with outcome. Despite the film having less historical accuracy than even the recent atrocious flop, The Other Boleyn Girl, it still manages to be a good film that holds your eyes with its' magnificent visuals as well as your interest with its' characters that have just enough emotion and heart to be able to invest and connect with them (even if just slightly). 10,000 B.C. is pure exhilarating entertainment, and does what a film should--lets you escape back to a time of darkness, to a world lost in time!

(8/10)",1204848000,18,2536,4.78310502283105
3093451,2,B0012Q732O,"Far too predictable and constantly dragged down by plot holes and epic clichs, Roland Emmerich's latest special effects extravaganza still showcases enough silly fun for those who can easily suspend their disbelief and don't demand well-conceived characters. Basically, no one should like such a film, yet it's still hard not to enjoy the sight of a herd of stampeding mammoths causing death and destruction.

The year is 10,000 B.C., and a remote mountain tribe of mammoth-hunters is attacked by a marauding group of slavers who capture Evolet (Camilla Belle), the promised wife to unwilling leader D'Leh (Steven Strait). Desperate to retrieve his beloved Eve, D'Leh embarks on a perilous mission across treacherous mountains, predator-infested jungles, and burning deserts, that will find him uniting several warrior tribes to overthrow the tyrannical leader of a lost civilization.

It's as clear as white rain that 10,000 B.C. isn't striving for any manner of authenticity in its portrayal of ancient anything. At best mimicking an Apocalypto in Egypt and at worst an inferior retelling of One Million Years B.C., Emmerich's film attempts to shadow what could have been in ""300: The Bedtime Story,"" but sacrifices any true power and intensity with sappiness and stereotypes. The decision to have the protagonist's tribe speak English may seem logical to entice the average moviegoer, but a careful examination isn't required to find several contradictory and unnecessary narrations. In an attempt to feign authenticity, much of the dialogue feels contrived and pointless. Lines like ""just try it"" as a contemptuous retort just don't belong in a pre-history epic.

Another area that betrays the film's setting is the casting. Faces that are far too pretty and teeth that are way too white scream Hollywood, though this film isn't exactly meant to be a history lesson. All of the primary cast do the best with the dialogue they're given and Camilla Belle certainly looks like a prize worth chasing after, but don't expect the energy or thrills of something like Apocalypto.

10,000 B.C. thrives on its CGI effects, and while not all it portrays is flawless or very realistic (as realistic as giant dodos and wooly mammoths can be anyway), what it attempts is still satisfyingly grand. Stampeding furry elephants, velociraptor-esque dodos and a not-so-mean saber-toothed tiger round out the brunt of the prehistoric creatures and much of their resulting action sequences do entertain. The most impressive special effects, however, belong to the long shots of gargantuan pyramids being constructed by thousands of scurrying people. When these massive monuments inevitably come crashing down, that's pretty thrilling too. Quite a bit of creativity (though probably not much authenticity) went into the unique and varied costumes that adorn each tribe of warriors, as well as the enslaving tyrants who recall their majestic and garishly dressed counterparts in the earlier ancient tale, 300.

If you were excited by the trailer for 10,000 B.C., you'll probably go see it regardless of how many ill words we can throw at it, and maybe you shouldn't let a lack of story, character development, and realism stop you from enjoying a little mindless, guilty-pleasure, action-adventure fun. Well, maybe it should.

3093496,3,B0012Q732O,"The reality is that maybe this movie should have been titled ""The Girl with Blue Eyes"" or some other mystical name, not a historical date.  It makes you believe that you are going to get a historical account of what it was like to live in 10,000 B.C., and it simply doesn't do that.  It's a tale, a story, complete with mythical and magical elements.

The story itself is decent.  A young girl is found and she is quite lovely with blue eyes, a rarity at the time.  Her town was destroyed by ""four-legged demons,"" men on horses.  Years later, the elder woman, a seer, predicts that these demons will come to her people as well.  A young boy falls in love with the young girl and they grow up together.  The four-legged demons do, in fact, come and the story starts to unfold centering around these two star-crossed lovers.

There are a lot of logistical problems with the tale such as, men walking for days and going through several different types of climate zones and also the question of understanding different dialects and languages seamlessly.

Sounds a bit like the role of white fundamentalists in modern day East Africa. As an American of Swedish heritage, I suppose I should feel honoured, but the truth is I find the racial politics of this film absurd and offensive. ""The blue eyed child will save."" I can't but help think of those images of a blue eyed and blond Jesus., so popular with both 19th Century colonialists and 20th Century Southern American racists,

3093569,3,B0012Q732O,"I gave it 3 star because the film is decent and the effects for being an older film hold up well. It's basically a cave man film if you're into that. At first I was a little afraid the CGI was going to look bad, since older films with CGI look fake on HD sets. They held up well.

The film starts with a tribe of cavemen that encounter a group of egyptian people (Pyramids are being constructed) and they take some of thier men and woman to force them into slavery. Along the way, they encounter more tribes that also lost people to the egyptians. The Egyptians are portrayed as very advanced with boats and massive buildings structure and machinery. The film is rated as an adventure film, but to me it played out more like a quest to get his people back. Along the way random events happen like running into massive land birds and random animals. I liked how they portrayed out of place looking people like albinos, blue eyed people as unique and different for that era. Also the egyptians costumes are normal and not over the top like some films make them out to be. (This feels/looks more real)

The film is not a documentary it's fantasy adventure.  I know some people were upset because its not 100% accurate especially with cavemen speaking english. That is petty, its fun popcorn flick. The reason I rated it 3 stars was because it lacked big moments and i'm not a fan of slow motion battles.",1472860800,,1400,4.4186046511627906

3093614,1,B0012Q732O,"my positive review of the great film ""Quest for Fire"" has led me here, just to this worst of all Emmerich crappy films. It's so bad, it hurts!

My time is too precious to more than just briefly refer to the film-defects that make me downright angry. Angry because a truely great film like ""Quest for Fire"" is less well known and less profitable than Swabian-Spielbergs ""kunterbunte mammoth sause"". (untranslateable)
The shortcomings are mentionened sufficiently in the 1-stars. Nevertheless, the most important aspect:

Emmerich charcters are generally so stereotyped, one-dimensional, bloodless and fake, that they do not actually touch me at all. So as much as 0.0. They only serve as extras, as a human dummy for CGI bombastic overkill effects. As a spectator one should at least care for certain characters, hope for them or fear. Emmerich has the ""talent"" that I do not care about all his characters.
Whether someone dies or not, I simply don't care at all. And I had this feeling even stronger than in other films here of R.E.
Because due to the setting in 10,000 bc, it is even more obvious, that the assembled troop of pop-batches here act in sheer mummery like a bunch of carnival astray - hilarious.
Nothing seems authentic, just fake in every way.

Sorry, but a director who refuses to take his characters seriously or cannot even make them lovable, ""wastes"" all his technical FX.

3093664,2,B0012Q732O,"Roland Emmerich seems unable to think small.  The word is clearly not in his vocabulary.  He gives us things like ""Independence Day,"" ""Godzilla,"" ""The Patriot,"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow"":  big movies filled with big casts and big special effects.  With ""ID4"" the spectacle worked because he did the film tongue in cheek.  With the others, the scale tended to overwhelm the subject matter.  So, has he learned his lesson?  Not with ""10,000 BC.""  The only thing he scaled down in this 2008 production was leaving the punctuation out of B.C.  Otherwise, it's more of the same:  lots of CGI and a minimum of story and character.  This gets tiresome really fast, even in a movie with a clear, high-definition image and robust Dolby TrueHD sound.

On the plus side, at least we don't have Raquel Welch or Ringo Starr battling dinosaurs.  On the minus side, we don't get much that resembles serious historical accuracy.  I mean, the story starts out OK, with prehistoric Man hunting mammoths in the northern lands of Europe (or Asia; it's unclear), but it soon disintegrates into melodramatic hogwash about pyramids and domesticated mammoths and hints of higher intelligences, gods, or Atlanteans helping to advance civilization.

Maybe Emmerich thought he was doing another ""2001,"" I dunno.  He gets away with playing fast and loose with archaeological events by having his film's narrator (Omar Sharif) explain that the story is about myth and legend.  Maybe he should also have said it was about fantasy and science fiction because that's pretty much what it comes down to.

The main character in the story is D'Leh (Steven Strait).  At least, I think he's the main character since he shows up more often than anybody else.  It's hard to tell, though, as the characters look so much alike under their heavy clothing, dark hairpieces, and thick makeup.  An old woman, considered a shaman of sorts by D'Leh's people, foretells that four-legged demons will come among them and that D'Leh will become their savior.  They do, and he does.

The first things we learn about people twelve thousand years ago is that they apparently never washed, and they had oddities with their language.  Dubious.  Even animals in the wild keep clean, but D'Leh's people seem dirty all the time, with matted, knotted hair and faces that look as though they use mud for mascara.  Worse, his people speak modern English haltingly and with an accent.  Sure, having characters speak in a movie audience's native tongue is a convention we have come to accept, unless we want subtitles, but why do these characters speak as though they had just recently learned to speak a second language?

Anyway, the object of D'Leh's eye is the lovely Evolet (Camilla Belle), whom the prophecy says D'Leh will marry.  The trouble is, it ain't going to be easy.  When the four-legged demons arrive (on horseback; therefore, four legs), they are slave traders who raid and pillage D'Leh's village, taking prisoners with them to sell into captivity.  Evolet is one of the prisoners they take.  Incidentally, while the others of D'Leh's people look like that five-thousand-year-old mummified ""Iceman"" that scientists found frozen in the snow some years ago, Ms. Belle looks like she just stepped through the front portals of Hollywood High.  Only in the movies, I suppose.

D'Leh survives the raid and heads out to rescue his love and the others taken captive, thus potentially fulfilling his mythic destiny.  What he gets into is utterly preposterous.  He and several companions travel from their frozen homeland in the North, over snowcapped mountains, through humid tropical rain forests, into arid, rocky wastelands, and finally to a flat, desert terrain, all within what appears to be a few days.  Along the trek, D'Leh frees and befriends a huge, saber-toothed cat, battles gigantic, flightless birds, and gathers an army to fight the great nations of the South.  He makes it look easy.

This is where the story really falls apart.  D'Leh presumably winds up in Egypt, where he finds a highly advanced civilization using slave labor and trained mammoths to build pyramids as instructed by a ruler known only as the ""Almighty.""  (Am I giving away too much?  I think not, since the movie's trailers showed these very scenes.)  Now, I know there are some people who subscribe to such radical theories about early pyramid building, but recent archaeological evidence suggests that the Egyptians started constructing their first pyramids about five thousand years ago, not twelve thousand, and that they did not use massive armies of slaves to build them but small groups of highly skilled workers whom they probably paid well for their efforts.

And domesticated mammoths?  If we were to believe that, common sense would lead us to ask, Then why did mammoths become extinct?  And why didn't the Egyptians ever mention mammoths in their hieroglyphics or portray them in their paintings (if, indeed, the people D'Leh encounters are ancestors of Egyptians at all--the movie never refers to them by name, although it does show us what appears to be the Sphinx under construction)?

Emmerich presents the entire story in a slow, solemn procession of scenes that would suggest he thought of it as some kind of religious ceremony.  None of his characters ever laughs or jokes.  Or bare smile, as far I could tell.  It's as if he thought human nature was somehow different back then; that life was so hard and the people so uncivilized, no one had any fun.  People are people, and I'm sure our ancestors had as much of a good time as we do today.  Still, that might spoil the tenor of Emmerich's picture, so everybody's got to be deadly serious.  D'Leh and his companions even walk to slow, solemn, heroic-sounding music.  It gets awfully silly, awfully fast.

""10,000 BC"" has all the excitement of a National Geographic Channel special but with none of the content.  Although the CGI work is OK, the cinematography is pleasing, the high-def picture and sound are nice, and a couple of segments--notably a mammoth hunt early on--are reasonably exciting, most of the film is simply a matter of waiting for it to end.

Video:
The high-definition Blu-ray picture, using a VC-1, 1080p, BD25 transfer, is somewhat better than the standard-definition version, but that should be a given.  Both versions capture the film's 2.40:1 aspect ratio and do what they can with the film's dusky tone.  The director no doubt wanted to portray our ancient ancestors in the darkest, most-primitive possible light, thus using a subdued color pallette throughout the film.  At its best, the high-def picture is clean, with strong contrasts, fairly deep black levels, and sharp object outlines.  Unlike its SD cousin, it never becomes outright fuzzy, although it is somewhat soft on inner detailing, especially noticeable in facial close-ups.  When things do lighten up for a few minutes, the HD video is fine, the whites of the snow showing up particularly well and the scenery well delineated.  Moreover, you'll find print grain at a minimum, which is either a blessing or a curse depending on how much detail you prefer.

Audio:
Warner engineers offer the sound in regular Dolby Digital 5.1 or Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  As with the SD edition, the audio easily upstages the picture quality.  Switching back and forth between the regular and the lossless tracks, one hears a greater clarity in the TrueHD, a tauter bass, and perhaps, at least subjectively, a stronger dynamic thrust.

Again it's the mammoth hunt near the beginning of the story and then the coming of the four-legged demons that demonstrate the soundtrack to its best advantage.  While I found the TrueHD track a little bright and forward, it does an excellent job with surround sounds, even subtle ones like the noises of the forest, the beasts, and the hubbub of the crowds that envelop the listener immpressively.

Extras:
Warners have added several more extras to the Blu-ray edition that you won't find on the standard-definition version of the movie.  The first item is the thirteen-minute featurette ""A Wild and Wooly Ride,"" which takes us behind the scenes of the movie's CGI and set designs.  The second item is the thirteen-minute featurette ""Inspiring an Epic,"" which explains how Emmerich got his fanciful inspiration from a book called ""Fingerprints of the Gods"" by Graham Hancock.  Emmerich tells us that just making a movie about primitive people hunting mammoths might have been a bit boring, so he wanted to throw in something more unusual.  He did, and it didn't help.

Next, we have the extras carried over from the SD edition, which include an alternate ending, about three minutes, and a series of additional scenes, about ten minutes total.  WB present all of these deleted segments in widescreen, by the way, and I wonder why they didn't use them in the theatrical cut to flesh it out.  The extras conclude with twenty-six scene selections but no chapter insert; English, French, and Spanish spoken languages; French and Spanish subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.

You can also download a digital copy of the movie by going to a specified Warner Bros. Web site, selecting a preferred file format (iTunes or Windows Media), and when prompted entering an authorization code.

Parting Shots:
The first big-scale movies I remember seeing in my youth were a rerelease of ""Gone With the Wind"" and later the premire of ""The Ten Commandments.""  They were enormously long, epic films, but they seemed to move along quite briskly.  By contrast, ""10,000 BC"" is only 109 minutes, counting about ten minutes of closing credits, yet it goes by in what seems like six hours.  Not all ""big"" movies are the same.  This one has a story that fails to engage us and characters who fail to involve us.  The Blu-ray picture and sound may be good, but the movie is plain, old-fashioned dull.",1432771200,,9901,4.954517889630079

3093666,5,B0012Q732O,"I saw this movie in theaters and remember loving it. The next day, I went online and was amazed to realize that it got about 10% positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. Most of the complaints were regarding historical accuracy. Really??? It's a fantasy movie, and all you're interested in is historical accuracy?
This is one of those situations where critics largely disagreed with viewers, as the movie was a box office success and is getting almost 3.5 stars here on Amazon. Unlike critics, most people prefer action filled entertainment over scientific facts. And this movie delivered that by the bucketload. Critics generally agreed that this movie was visually stunning, drawing visual comparisons to Jurassic Park or even Lord of the Rings. However, unlike viewers, they were expecting a historical documentary instead of an epic fantasy.
In conclusion, if you want to watch a documentary, go watch Blue Planet. However, if far fetched fantasies don't make your blood boil, give this movie a try.",1431907200,2,999,5.134969325153374

People need to calm the heck down and stop looking for perfection. Stop being the person who ruins it for everyone else because it wasn't up to your level.

I adore this movie. Camilla Belle is a fantastic actress. Steven Strait is a fantastic actor. I believed the love story and I sympathized with the characters when need be.

This movie is endearing and light hearted fun with awesome FANTASTICAL! (THATS RIGHT PEOPLE, ALL THE HISTORICAL INACCURACIES WERE DONE ON PURPOSE! IT IS CLEARLY LABELED FANTASY! DUH!) Elements woven into it. If you want to watch a historical  movie, next time read the genres of a movie first before you rant out on something totally dumb. Grow up and learn to read, thank you!

I like this movie because it's different, If you enjoyed 'Clan of the Cave Bear' or 'Quest for Fire' you'll like this film.

This is a kind of sci-fi film in reverse, not about the future, but an imaginative impossible past. We don't have to believe that the clan's mother can predict the future and control the weather. We do not have to think that a cave man would give up his leadership of the clan because he did not kill the mammoth elephant directly but only by stealth. We also need not accept the notion that a tribal leader would leave his tribe to find a better place for his people but do so acting as if he is a coward running away so that no one would want to join him in the search. Nor must we accept as true that a cave man can save a saber-tooth tiger who will remember that the man saved him and come to do the same for the man. No, we need not accept any of these things as true to enjoy the film.",1421280000,,884,4.115606936416185

 This is not so much a cave man movie, although you might think so from the title, as an adventure fantasy.  Think more Conan the Barbarian rather than Quest for Fire.  In the story a little band of Stone Age folk is attacked by slavers who round up, for reasons that become clear latter in the film, the men of the band, and the heros fey and fated girlfriend.
 The middle of the movie is burned up with a long chase where the hero gathers allies and tracks the slavers.  Eventually, the good guys catch up with the bad guys.  At that time we discover that the slavers wanted the men to help build the pyramids.  Of course the Godlike man in charge, a refugee from Atlantis, also had the help of trained Mastodons to move the big rocks around.  So now we know how it was done.  Slaves and Mastodons built the pyramids.
 The good parts of the movie are first and foremost the stunning photography.  The wide views of mountains and desserts are to the eye what hot fudge is to the taste buds.  There are two, count them two, separate and distinct Mastodon stampedes.  You cant get that sort of thing just anywhere.  I found the slave revolt to be exciting and inspirational.
 The down side includes the hero who speaks cave man with a Scottish accent.  The dialog in general sounds like it was translated from the words of a particularly pretentious Algonquin elder.
 The cast is made up of actors from New Zealand and South Africa that we in the US haven't seen before.  Big name actors would have been wasted in this special effects epic.  Camilla Belle played the leading female role.  She is so beautiful that she is sure to appear in future films that allow her to act.
This film is rated PG 13 for violence.  It runs one hour and 49 minutes.  It generated $36 million in its first three days, so lots of people are going to see the Mastodons.  Two and a half stars.  If you liked Scorpion King you will like this movie, its better looking.",1412380800,,1955,4.363888888888889

If you're going to make a movie about pre-historic times, why on Earth would you make the dumbest possible movie ever?  Would you not want to make something that's both good and accurate that everyone can enjoy?

Instead we get mister pop-paranoia-psychology himself making what has got to be one of the worst movies in the Pre-historic genre regarding a very clean looking ""caveman"" who is confronted with a movie director's vision of the challenges of living with primitive technology.

This thing could have been so much better, just like another reviewer stated, but it wasn't.  And what's worse is that people flocked to this film, and continue to flock to it.

3093768,4,B0012Q732O,"I honestly do not understand the hatred surrounding Roland Emmerich's 10,000 BC, as it is a very entertaining and well-made adventure movie that takes us back in time to a world of discovery, superstition, and an epic quest for survival and love. I don't know if I was the only one to pick up on this, but the action in this movie was very similar to that of Avatar, which I seem to notice every day as the most un-original film ever made. 10,000 B.C., while its script may not have been award-worthy or truly memorable, the visuals, action sequences and awesome scale were enough. Roland has always delivered when it comes to disaster films, as he is the master (ID4, Day After Tomorrow and 2012), but he also has his more subtle and very memorable films as well, for being different (The Patriot and Anonymous), even if they didn't have a liking by everyone. But it's 10,000 B.C. that is his most interesting film because, well, it was successful, and different. We can speculate and determine some specifics of what life was before the death of Christ, before the building of the Pyramids, but after the Cavemen left their caves, but we don't know much, and his vision of this truly lost world is very incredible. Of every blockbuster released in the past decade, this was among the best half, honestly. Not even half of Michael Bay's films are as good as 10,000 B.C., specifically the Bad Boys movies, Transformers sequels and The Island.

All-in-all, when counting in the great visuals, superb musical score and good directing with the decent script and alright acting, 10,000 B.C. is a good, entertaining movie that's ultimately an underrated gem. It's not for everyone, but it is a good movie",1370736000,,1699,4.720538720538721

Tribal customs and the such. Highly entertaining and also surprisingly educating.

However, I will say that this is a good work of *fiction* that explores some fantasy and yes, some facts, about pre-historic man. I found the relativity of technology interesting. For example, one civilization is purely stone, but gets attacked by a civilization that uses metal (copper?). The metal users also have horses, so to the stone civ seems like 4-legged demons. (spoilers) Then later you see an even FAR more advanced civ. Obviously these types of boundaries must have existed, and it is interesting to imagine what would happen if these bumped up against each other. This movie does explore that.

Man, or some form of man, existed for millions of years before present day. Rarely do movies, or books for that matter, try to explore what life must have been like at those times. This movie attempts to do that. It is not perfect, but I give them credit for making a competent attempt and coming up with an interesting story. I know a lot of people will laugh at historical inaccuracies. Remember, though, anything that is 100% historically accurate would probably not be exciting for 90 minutes.

And, I could spend all day picking this film apart - BUT IT""S A FANTASY STORY! HELLO! Remember: FANTASY! That's what I paid my money for! Not a documentary or historical fiction, but a FANTASTIC, DREAM-LIKE story.

Nor do you have to be a genius to figure this out!

The movie works on many levels. First, as an adventure story, a saga, like Lord of the Rings. I felt swept away. It's also an enjoyable love story. The chemistry between the actors is excellent. I cared about the characters. In addition to being erotic! - Its been a long time since I've seen so many good looking men and women on the Big Screen all at one time!

Very little of the violence is graphic or gratuitous. You can tell a fantastic story without blood and guts flying everywhere. It's also a movie suitable for older children.

Tribal people and people of color are shown with respect. Their rich variety of physical features, skin colors, dress, languages and architecture are shown in all its glory. Before the White Man came, and ruined everything, there was mind boggling cultural diversity on this planet!

What is most striking to me is the very moving and insightful portrayal of a Medicine Women performing profound acts of shamanism in order to help protect her people as best as she can. This is the very first time I seen such a pivotal role for tribal spiritual beliefs in a big Hollywood fantasy film! My hats off to the whomever wrote the screenplay! You did your homework!

Granted the ending did bother me a bit. It begs the question: Did the ancient Egyptians actually treat their workers that poorly? If only the Egyptians didn't use slaves, and treated their workers well. And what a metaphor for the year 2008, where most workers in the world are treated like dirt and instead of whips, the fear of dire poverty is used to keep most of the world's workers in line.

But I digress, this is a great movie. At the end a tear rolled down my cheek, and I felt good when I left the theater. That's all I can ask of a story. My money was well spent, for a change!

While any caveman/prehistoric movie is more often than not meant as campy fun, this one is an exception.

The story is okay.

I liked that the movie didn't have crude or foul language. I think that aspect created an appropriate ambiance for the simple lifestyle of the prehistoric tribe.

One of the earlier scenes with the woolly mammoths reminds me of the old elephant jokes. In tribute to them I'd like to say: When the wild herd of stampeding mammoths came running across the terrain the ancient tribe recognized them immediately because they weren't wearing sunglasses.",1342915200,,996,4.685714285714286

3093801,5,B0012Q732O,"n 10,000 BC, a tribe of hunter-gatherers called the Yagahl live in a remote mountain range in the Urals and survive by killing woolly mammoths. D'Leh, a young hunter, has a companion named Evolet, an orphan who was found by the tribe. D'Leh, while hunting mammoths, manages to kill one and wins the ""White Spear"". He also wins Evolet in marriage, but feels he deserves neither since he killed the mammoth by accident.

One day, D'Leh and several others are away when horse-raiders called the ""Four Legged Demons"" attack the Yaghal camp. The horse raiders enslave Evolet; D'Leh, Tic'Tic, KaRen, and Baku pursue them to save her. They enter a rainforest where they are attacked by a large pack of terror birds. In this encounter, Tic'Tic gets wounded and Baku and Ka'Ren are captured. D'Leh rescues Evolet, but she is later re-captured. Continuing on, they meet others whose loved ones were taken by the raiders. D'Leh and Tic'Tic befriend Nakudu, leader of the Naku tribe. He tells D'Leh of a prophecy: whoever talks to a Smilodon that they call the ""Spear-Tooth"" will help free their people. D'Leh had earlier saved the Spear-Tooth from drowning in a trap and it had spared his life. D'Leh realizes the prophecy was about him. Nakudu explains that his loved ones were taken in the ""Great Red Birds"", ships with large red sails, to the ""Mountains of the Gods"", from which no one has ever returned. They then come together with other tribes, who agree to form a coalition to pursue the raiders.

They find the ships with red sails holding Evolet and Baku. They have no means to follow the ships, so they journey through a vast desert, discovering an advanced civilization similar to ancient Egypt, ruled by an enigmatic figure known as ""The Almighty"", who is said to be the last survivor of his kind. The Almighty, who is regarded as a living god, possesses many thousands of slaves that he is using to build a huge pyramid complex in his honor. D'Leh finds an escaped servant of the Almighty and notices he is wearing a bracelet worn by D'Leh's father. D'Leh's father left his tribe for food and found the Naku tribe before being stolen by the raiders. In a night attack, the guards of the slaves discover D'Leh behind a pyramid. Tic'Tic dies from injuries from killing the guards before they raise the alarm. Meanwhile, the Almighty's priests discover Evolet bears scars on her hand patterned after the ""Mark of the Hunter"", the constellation Orion. The priests believe it is part of a prophecy that whoever wears the mark of the Hunter is destined to kill The Almighty. D'Leh starts a full-scale rebellion amongst the slaves. They cause the mammoth herd, used in building the pyramid, to stampede and kill a large number of troops.

The Almighty offers Evolet to D'Leh in exchange for abandoning his rebellion. The Almighty says that if D'Leh takes his wife, his warriors can return, but the rest must be his slaves forever. D'Leh feigns acceptance of the deal which allows him to throw a spear at The Almighty and kill him, proving that he is not a god. During the ensuing battle, the raider obsessed with Evolet kidnaps her on horseback. Evolet grabs an arrow and stabs the warlord in the side, knocking them both off the horse. D'Leh rushes towards her, but the raider shoots her in the back. D'Leh kills him and returns to Evolet, and she dies in his arms. The scene shifts to the tribe's wise woman as she breathes in deeply and then breathes out her last breath. The scene then returns to D'Leh still holding Evolet's body when she suddenly awakens, restored by the wise woman's sacrifice. They depart for home and bid farewell to the other tribes.

In an alternative ending, the scene shifts forward many years into the future, showing Baku's retelling of the story by the camp fire. It ends with a child asking what had happened to the ""Mountains of the Gods"", and Baku responds ""They were taken back by the sands. Lost to time, lost to man.""",1337040000,2,3951,4.696969696969697
3093802,3,B0012Q732O,"Roland Emmerich has a style of movie making that is very impressive. Even when I don't love the project, it is usually pleasing to the eye and leaves me with something to think about. 10,000 BC is his most recent project and while it is not his best work, it is one of the most unique and memorable.

Mammoths are a way of life for the people of the small village in the midst of the ancient wilds. They provide food, clothing, and opportunities for trade with neighboring tribes. But in recent years their presence has become more scarce and thus far more valuable. They are also extremely dangerous and almost impossible to kill except in massive hunting parties. D'Leh (Steven Strait) is far from the best huntsman among his people. He's also something of an outcast since his father abandoned him and the village many years before. But he does have the eye of the beautiful Evolet (Camilla Belle). But she is destined to be the wife of the best hunter among them... and it's not likely to be him. Until fortune changes and by sheer dumb luck, he manages to kill a mammoth all by himself, something that earns him the right to brandish the white spear and choose his bride. Too humble to accept the spear under false pretenses, he mourns that he will never marry Evolet...

The grandmother of the tribe has professed that four-legged demons will come into their midst and take away something precious. That very night, foreign tribesmen on horseback steal into the community and make off with what they can carry, including D'Leh's beloved Evolet, since her blue eyes are rare. Along with a handful of his friends, D'Leh sets out to save her and his trek through the wilds that lay over the mountains will take him to more dangerous places than he could have ever envisioned.

I am not a big fan of movies set in prehistoric times but this one is surprisingly good for the genre. It does ask you to suspend your belief on many occasions but is depicted as a sort of ancient grand adventure, complete with saber tooth tigers, wooly mammoths, and cavemen so ragged and filthy that you know they must smell even worse. What actually amazed me the most was that underneath ragged dreadlocks and a bucket full of dirt, Camilla Belle can still be outstandingly gorgeous -- maybe even more so due to Evolet's uniquely blue eyes. She isn't just a throwaway heroine either but has some spunk, which she needs as she carries her half of the story on with the tradesmen. The animation is flawless and the creatures look fairly realistic (although they seem to be about twice as big as history tells us they were). It is something of a sprawling epic so don't expect to see just wild lands... there is a towering city complete with an evil ""god"" and lots of sinister minions.

This film presents a very noble and moral set of ethic guidelines that implies that in order to survive, a civilization must be governed through forces of good rather than an interest in evil. Heroism is applauded, evil abhorred. And that is a good thing in our modern age.",1332374400,2,3041,4.584558823529412

3093804,2,B0012Q732O,"I went to this movie expecting it to be a fantasy; therefore, I suspended my logic. I just wanted to enjoy the special effects. They turned out to be a mixed bag. They are riveting, and look real in the scenes where the doldos (giant birds) chase and kill the men. The mastodons look impressive and convincing too. However the saber-toothed tiger look obviously fake. The ending scenes where the pyramid was being built are one of the most spectacular I ever seen. It looks huge, lively and beautiful.

The plot is an exact copy of Apocalypto. Yet this film does not have the suspense and intensity of Apocalypto. The acting is not convincing either. At the end, a few people laughed when the female character was resurrected from her death but I didn't mind. I had already expected it to be a fantasy.

Overall, it's worth watching once for curiosity. Everybody who likes dinosaurs will certainly wants to see this picture.

3093805,2,B0012Q732O,"Admittedly, my memory of 10,000 B.C. is a bit unstable after watching it on HBO a few years ago.  I remember the rudimentary plot - young warrior of woolly mammoth hunting tribe is predestined to save his azure-eyed girlfriend from a more advanced Egyptian-like race.  I remember (I think) the opening shot of the mammoth hunt where the young warrior earns his stripes by standing his ground and holding a spear for a mammoth to impale itself upon.  I remember the mammoth tribes journey across several jumbled climate zones (grassland, jungle, desert) to retrieve the young woman, Evolet.  I certainly remember the encounter with the carnivorous terror-birds (Phorusracos), one of the few exciting parts of the movie.  I sorta remember a man from another tribe agreeing to help the young mammoth hunter (can't remember his name) in his quest.  I remember the young hunter being trapped in some watery hole with an enormous saber-tooth cat and the hunter saying something hilariously to the effect, ""I'll free you if you promise not to eat me"". He frees the cat and the cat doesn't eat him.  However, the sabertooth doesn't do much else in the movie.  And, yeah, I remember, the Egyptian-like civilization using mammoths to construct their monuments and pyramids (actually not a bad touch).

However, what I most remember is a physical impossibility - mammoths galloping like horses over the meadows.  Now, like most elephants, mammoths would have managed at best a shuffling walk - pretty fast but no gallop.  It was logical gaffes like this that actually made me realize what a junk heap of a movie 10,000 B.C. really is, if you stop to think about it.

3093814,1,B0012Q732O,"""10,000 B.C."" is a classic example of a film where all the budget was put into the cinematography and special effect, with little regard given to the script and acting. The results are an epic adventure tale, that is neither adventurous or epic.

This story of a young hunter who faces his predestined fate to lead his tribe, could have been a compelling and intense story of human history. But the script is so horribly flawed and the acting so bland, that there is nothing to emotionally connect the audience to the characters or the story. You simply don't really care about any of it.

I never bought the love story between the two lead characters. Their unemotive acting skills, hampered by a scripted romance that is so schmaltzy and unbelievable, that it isn't even worthy of being used as a dime store romance novel, much less a major budget motion picture, never brings about any sense of true emotion from the viewer. You not only don't believe these two people love each other, you don't even care enough to wonder why you feel that way. I'll admit I wasn't around back then to see how these people interacted with each other, but I can tell you it was probably nothing at all like this. And the way the girl survives to be with her man in the end, is so mind-numbingly unbelievable, it is more of an insult to the viewers intelligence, rather than the uplifting emotional moment the writers and director probably intended it to be.

Another problem with the film is all the historical inaccuracies. When you want to make a film that is based on the history of the human race on Earth, if you can't create a stirring tale of fiction with human history as the backdrop, you'd do well to try to keep as close to the facts as you can. I mean, while the ancient Egyptians did use slave labor to build their vast cities and monuments, I don't believe that Woolly Mammoths were there to help in that. If this movie was about some alien world, I might be able to overlook this kind of thing, but if you are going to use actual Earth history as your setting, either use it right or don't use it at all. When it can be said that ""One Million Years B.C."" is a more historically accurate film, you know something is seriously wrong with your film's script and research.

Of course, the biggest problem I personally had with the film was the extremely slow and plodding pace, as the characters spend lots of time just walking around. I could have taken mini-naps between the major scenes of the film and not felt lost when I awoke and started watching it again. We get it, alright? They are traveling great distances. You don't need to make the audience feel like they are on one themselves, as they watch the film. An adventure tale is supposed to be exciting, not boring.

The one place the film does get it right, though, is the cinematography. There is some brilliant and breathtaking camera work here, with some very gorgeous wide angle shots of the lands the characters travel through. It is the one place where the film truly shines. It is not, however, anywhere near enough to reverse the detriments in the script, acting and researching of the film to make the story even remotely enjoyable.

""10,000 B.C."" could have been one of the great epic adventure stories of the the last decade, but being saddled with poorly emoting actors, an unbelievable soap opera romance, historical inaccuracies you could fly a jumbo jet through, and a pace so slow and tedious it would put a snail to sleep, the film instead becomes one of the biggest and most costly of viewing disappointments, perhaps of all time (""Waterworld"" has nothing on this film, believe me)!

This is not intended to be Casablanca, the Godfather, or Schindler's List. This is a popcorn movie, and it should be reviewed as such. Perspective, people. If you want multidimensional characters and a deep meaty story, go read A Song of Fire and Ice. If you want a fun escape on a Friday night after a long working week, this is your movie.

As for my review, I'll keep it short and sweet. Beautiful vistas, unwilling heroes, GREAT action set pieces, some good CGI and some nasty villains. What more do you need from an A-class trash masterpiece like this?  And as a lover of trash movies, I use that word as a compliment.

Five stars, for this genre. If you enjoy silly trash like One Million Years BC or 1960's The Time Machine, you'll probably get a kick out of this. Just remember, it's only a story, it's not intended to be real.

3093818,2,B0012Q732O,"One nice thing about the period from 30,000 BC to about 7000 BC, from the little we know from archeology (Maritja Gimbutas), is that during this Paleolithic age, the Goddess reigned.  A massive amount of Goddess statuary exists from this time period, and we do not see ""God"" sculptures until closer to 7000 BC, when a God comes into existence as a son/consort of the Goddess.

Unfortunately, we don't see anything like this in this movie.  I don't believe that movies have to be true to life: they're often more fun if they're not.  However, we have far too many male warrior-hero movies: we really don't need more and more and more of this type of story, particularly when our civilization is under threat of collapse because of the male-dominated warrior-hero way it's been run for the last 5000 years.  We need a return to the GOddess, and this movie missed a good opportunity to help in that.

In this movie, there are hundreds, no -- thousands -- of male characters, but only two female characters.  One of the female characters is nothing much more than a prize for the male hero, and the other, a Shamanic priestess of her ancient tribe, ends up sacrificing her own life in order that the life of the young male hero might be happier and fruitful.  So this story, instead of being centered on the Goddess, is really about the ""death"" of the GOddess as a sort of sacrifice for the birth of a male-centered, warrior-based, patriarchal culture in which women really have no signifcant role to play as individuals in their own right.

3093819,2,B0012Q732O,"A movie as bonkers as Roland Emmerich's 10,000 B.C. really ought to be a lot more fun than this actually is. Partially inspired by some of Graham Hancock's less daffy theories of a lost higher civilisation in the Stone Age who really built the pyramids, this sees Steven Strait's hunter-gatherer setting off after the slavers who took the love of his life and the village's other hunters to build the pyramids (with a little bit of help from mammoths, of course). The title promises enjoyable nonsense along the lines of the Harryhausen One Million Years B.C., and with a sabre-tooth tiger and some Terror Birds thrown into the mix the elements are certainly there for good old fashioned brain-off entertainment, but at times it feels almost as long a slog as the one that takes its hero from the barren mountains of New Zealand across Namibia to the plains of Giza. Certainly the first half is pretty dull, with even the scene with Terror Birds (think big turkeys with big teeth, which is at least appropriate for Christmas) picking off slaves and slavers alike in long grass playing like a considerably less effective version of the velociraptor attack from Spielberg's The Lost World with a bit of Mysterious Island thrown in for bad measure.

Things do finally pick up a bit when they finally reach `the mountains of the Gods,' but not really enough. It may be the most spectacular part of the picture but at times it feels like an early rejected draft of Stargate - oh look, another evil godlike villain who may be an alien or from Atlantis, and what's this, revolting slaves led by a white man from a far-off land? Clich&eacute;s like this really need more panache than they're given here to come off, and the casting doesn't exactly help you overlook the film's shortcomings. Steven Strait isn't exactly blessed with much charisma as the reluctant hero, coming over a bit like Colin Farrell's well meaning younger brother, Camilla Belle is awful pretty but it's hard to tell if she can actually act when she doesn't have much to do except look confused, the ever-erratic Cliff Curtis is pretty awful here and Omar Sharif manages the almost impressive feat of both underplaying and overacting his narration that seems intended to paper over the gaps and add a bit of emotion to the proceedings (the deletion of his cameo in the original ending spared audiences the worst of his performance, though it can be found on the DVD and all-region BluRay along with 10 deleted scenes and a couple of brief featurettes). Matters aren't helped by co-writer/co-producer/co-composer (with Thomas Wander, ne Wanker) Harold Kloser's score which constantly turns into Hans Zimmer's main theme from King Arthur with such monotonous regularity that you start expecting Maire Brennan to start singing.

It's not historically accurate but if you take it for what it is ( just entertainment ) then it's really not a bad film. I wouldn't pay full retail price for it but if you can get it for a few bucks on here I say it's worth a watch.,1287014400,2,401,3.6206896551724137
3093826,4,B0012Q732O,"First of all, if historical innaccuracies and a visionary tale that uses creative license to the max are not your style, then this is not the film for you. BUT......least we all be reminded that recently (within the last 10-15 years) many worldly discoveries have shaped or re-shaped many peoples ideas of the past. The idea that Atlantis is or was what we now know as Cuba. The oldest ruins actually carbon dated on earth are not found in Egypt, England, the Netherlands or even Iceland, but on the island of Malta. And there is still some debate about different types of ore being used for weapons long before iron was used, or better put KNOWN to be used. So if you can, or even want to, open your mind a little, and watch this story for what it is, a visionary tale that is not great by any means, but uses a lot of creative license and somewhat imaginitive story telling that crosses many boundries. I gave the movie a 4 star rating, because I took it for what it was, or what I thought it was meant to be, a story that was more fantasy than just fiction, more about imagination than accuracy. If you can do that, you might enjoy this film. As always, the best way is to judge for yourself. By the way, this movie looks great on Blu-Ray and a Plasma HDTV.",1282348800,3,1260,4.298319327731092

Its in probably totally inaccurate in its portrayal of ancient man(if they existed) definitely. But it is one visually stunning and non boring movie to watch. There is never a dull moment as the son of a tribe hunter takes off in search of his girl friend who he was foretold to be so at the beginning. The best scenes are the hunting of the wully mammoths and the parts where the saber tooth tiger shows his face, after the young man saves him. Yes they speak broken English which if there were cave man i'm guessing they didn't have a language of there own. So its either make up a fake language with subtitles throughout or let them speak English, which i prefer instead. The story is flimsy but the journey is pretty exciting, also why the so called ""four legged demon"" people speak in a processed low electronic voice i have no clue, obviously because they think they aren't human. So yes its a decent movie that holds your attention, yet if you want something historically accurate your barking in the wrong cave, though if you want a fictional type journey like Lord Of The Rings this movie is just right for you.",1278115200,3,1281,4.364016736401673

The plot is exceptionally trite: Woman stolen by raiders as sex object (Evolet) and chased after by amorous male (D'Le).  The ending falls apart when Evolet is gratuitously killed and brought back to life. The viewer is constantly asked to suspend disbelief when confronted with totally inaccurate representations: slave traders on horseback with saddles and rope stirrups (but then, in the absence of discretely hidden saddle horns and rope stirrups, how could the slavers drag a line of people behind them, let alone one person, without being jerked off their horse), having to travel from Northern Europe, across Africa and the Sahara Dessert to arrive at the Nile from the West (How did they ever walk across the Mediterranean Sea?), having an advanced civilization with a full command of navigation, textiles and metallurgy exist only within the construction sited of the pyramids, having the pyramids at Giza being build by slaves and Woolly Mammoths (there has never been any evidence of slave labor, and, I doubt that Wooly Mammoth bones have never been found at the site), having the pyramids of Giza left unfinished after the slaves destroy the advanced civilization, and, having the Sahara exist as it does today (desert) rather than as it did 12,000 years ago (tropical forest).  One must also ask the question, Why did a small band of slavers travel thousands of mile to the glacial peaks of Northern Europe to capture a handful of slaves when they had all of the Near East and North Africa at their door step?

The PQ and AQ on the Blu-Ray were stellar-close to a 5/5 for me. However the story was so preposterous and the pace so irritating that the film had few redeeming qualities aside from this. Though I am not a history scholar, I was a little unnerved by the total confusion along the timeline. I don't know if Emmerich intended to explain history on his own terms, but why horses and Mammoths and Sabertooth Tigers existed at the same time, as ""regular-looking"" horses was a bit strange. I was also a little put off by the smidgeons of humor interjected (the lead character speaking to the Tiger in the pit?). There were numerous stellar shots that panned over the Egyptian pyramid scenes, and several sweeping shots over the journey of the combined tribes but the story had so many holes in it, I felt like I was watching a parody/ Not recommended.

And don't get me started on the whole, ridiculous saber-tooth tiger scenes!

You really don't give a damn what happens to them. And then there's an absurd ""geist ex machina"" ending.

Though Emmerich claims to have studied what's known about paleolithic life (he at least gets the pole star right), the principal characters live in a winter wonderland only a few days' walk from appears to be Egypt! That's carrying plate-tectonic theory a bit too far, don'tcha think?

3093850,3,B0012Q732O,"Much of the negative criticism leveled at Roland Emmerich's ""10,000 BC"" is valid.  The film is derivative of other (better) films including ""The Searchers"", ""King Kong"", ""The Wizard of Oz"" and dozens more; it's chock full of anachronisms and dubious history; and the story is at times unbearably cheesy, especially when the screenplay cheats the audience by using mysticism and magic to achieve contrived emotional effects (this is particularly true of the story's hokey happy ending).

And yet, despite these flaws, the film is not without its charms.  For those viewers able to suspend logic and focus simply on its visual qualities, ""10,000 BC"" offers up some splendid special effects, gorgeous art direction and set decorations, and best of all, exquisite cinematography by Ueli Steiger that truly stimulates the imagination.  I experienced the film on Blu-ray disc screened on a 60 inch 1080i monitor, and was so impressed by the lavishness of the production that I frequently forgot and forgave the vagaries of the screenplay.  This is a movie that is perfect for those nights when you want to disengage your mind, relax with a bowl of popcorn, and simply pass two hours enjoying an inconsequential spectacle that requires a minimum amount of concentration.  If you can appreciate it for what it is, and not be disappointed by what it isn't, you may very well get a kick out of ""10,000 BC"".",1250380800,,1396,4.995689655172414

 One thing that I liked about it was that I was not familiar with most of the film's cast, and their progressive character development was really excellent, which allows the viewer to get very absorbed with the story.
 The director, Roland Emmerich,and his staff really did a great techical research job of making this story quite believable, and the editing was excellent on a film that should become a cult classic someday like Star Wars, but time will tell about that.
 I like films like this when these fictional, historical-based productions are produced,i.e.:the HBO series ""Rome"" and Deadwood"" were, as it makes one think about the sacrifices by those who came before us lived in their time.",1250035200,7,927,4.967741935483871

I hadn't watched the DVD until after I read several reviews, so, when I did watch it today, I didn't expect much at all.  And, in the beginning, I thought I was going to be right.  However, little by little, the plot began picking up, the acting was a bit better, and the action began moving.  As the film finished (I never give away endings!), I thought, slow-moving, but still a good watch!  I didn't feel like I had wasted 1.5-2 hours; instead, I felt lifted and wanting just a little to cheer with everyone on the screen.

So, what I guess I am trying to say is that:
If you are looking for blood and gore; if you are looking for sex; if you are looking for violence that blasts off the screen; then, pass this one up.

It starts off ok, but once the story kicks in, it just goes from mess to mess. Firstly, there's no historical accuracy in any of it, not that it's TRYING to be historically accurate, but it would have been good to see them do something a little more realistic. There's no structure to the landscape or the people that live in it. The characters walk from ice mountains to amazon forests and deserts like they're in walking distance of each other. It makes no sense and became really annoying.
The people that live in the lands are also really random, from Eskimos to Africans to Egyptians [?], and just when you least expect it, one white guy too. The ""villains"" in the film make no sense either, what are they? Egyptians, Myans, Asians? it's this random mish mosh of cultures and styles that has no explanation. They also have SHIPS?..........i've never heard of any SAVAGE CAVE PEOPLE building BOATS and going across seas.

As for the visual effects, surprisingly average, i thought they'd at least get that right. There's some really obvious blue screen pasted backgrounds in the beginning, and the abnormally large Sabertooth tiger looked very cartoony.

It didn't take 20 minutes before I issued my first apology; by the time the film was over I was groveling.  But she was a good sport about it.  (Thank goodness.)

I recently caught this howler on cable; a clunker is a clunker, but watching a clunker still beats cleaning the commode (but not by much), so I pulled up a chair and allowed the ridiculous tale that is 10,000 B.C. unfold.  A clan of hunters (and they hunt the big boys, the woolly mammoths) living in the Alps gets their prized possession (a blue-eyed chick) stolen by evil slave traders.  Led by young D'Leh (Steven Strait, who no doubt is still thanking his agent), a small group pursues; hiking only a couple of days, they're suddenly in a steamy jungle (Europe is well known for having them); hiking a couple more, they're in barren north Africa (no need to cross that pesky Mediterranean).  Magically uniting countless nomadic tribes, they assault a massive, pre-Egyptian city being constructed (by the blue-eyed chick and thousands of other slaves).  All the while, the dialogue, plot, pacing, goes from laughable, to hysterical, then back to laughable.

One thing I will say for director Roland Emmerich:  Dude can bring visuals to a movie.  There are some impressive vistas, and the CGI mammoths were equally impressive.  As for Strait, he could definitely use a good dose of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pert-Plus/dp/B0018PG2HG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pert Plus</a>.

*Spoilers*

This is a fun romp through a variety of mish-mashed primitive societies and locales - there's frozen mountainous country, fevered jungle terrains, and arid deserts of both the African and Egyptian flavors. The action starts early and stays at a decently fevered pitch; the love story is well done and never lapses into boredom.

The best part about this movie isn't really the plot but in the little extra character touches included. For once, we have a damsel in distress who remains calm and reasonably collected in the face of peril, leaves clues, and proactively swipes a knife from her captors. If we must have captive females, I admire a strong and realistic stoic-yet-hopeful attitude in said captive female. We also have African ""supporting"" characters who are allowed to outshine the ""main"" characters: the African tribes that rally in support of the hero are composed of individual, brave, witty, intelligent people, not just some token leader and a handful of grunting followers. To top it all off, we have a wise old mentor who manages to stay alive for *most* of the movie, and a missing father who (quite realistically) *stays* missing, rather than being trotted out as a Deus Ex Machina in the final act.

I enjoyed this movie partly for the front-and-center plot, but mostly for the extra touches that buck the accepted movie stereotypes that we all labor under. Don't go into it expecting a masterpiece because you won't get one, but this is a perfect way to waste a cold evening at home.

5) Even isolated arctic tribes have tremendous racial diversity.

7) Egyptian pharaohs were white guys who spit a lot.

Guy loses girl; guy fights to get girl back; guy gets girl. And that's probably all the script itself said, considering the quality of acting and dialogue.

But my biggest problem with this pile of garbage is the marketing. When you look at the packaging, you see a guy going up against a monstrous saber-tooth tiger. And again on the back of the case they show this creature. You think, wow, this must be man battling the hellish monsters of old. With today's CGI that could've been so cool. Instead, the tiger is in the movie for about 60 seconds - there's no battle, the thing doesn't even bloody its claws.

Oh, there's a few mammoths that stampede, yeah. But when you compare that to the similar elements in the climax battle of Return of the King, it's an absolutely pitiful scene.

The only saving grace is the giant bird scene. If the movie could have developed along similar lines it could really have been a great movie. It's this few minutes that give it the one star, otherwise I'd have complained about not having a zero star option!

The marketing is a con. Don't be suckered. Let this garbage rot then maybe the producers will get the message and give us something decent to watch next time out.",1230422400,3,1339,4.475409836065574

I'm not going to list all of them here, but a few really stick out: 1) the stupid accents for the dreadlocked Valley people, whatever their made-up names were, 2) the dreadlocks, 3) the obviously fake blue contact lenses that Camilla Belle had to wear - they couldn't find an actress with blue eyes if it's so central to the plot? 4) Duh'bleh's (lead) father leaves at the beginning of the film to ""save his people,"" but everyone thinks he's abandoned his tribe.  It's never explained what exactly he was doing aside from leaving and why he left - HUGE plot hole.

PLOT: There's all these soothsayers/old people saying things about this caveman kid. And he fulfills them (by accident). He wasn't trying to fulfill prophecy, he just fell into it. That was one of the little parts I liked about the movie - the whole ""cant escape your destiny"" part. I wanted to type ""feel"" of the movie, but I couldn't - because there was no feel.

Im anti excessive CGI - you could definitely notice it with the tiger, not so much with the mammoth, and sometimes during the background scenery.

3093886,2,B0012Q732O,"I picked up this film based largely on the previews I saw on TV, and in hopes of interesting graphics and effects. Also, director Roland Emmerich was responsible for _The Patriot_ and _Independence Day_. With a title like this one, though, I wasn't expecting much of a plot line -- so I wasn't too disappointed to discover I was correct in that regard, even if you ignore the anachronisms and treat it as a pure fantasy. Such as it is, the story turns on a classic quest: The newly chosen leader of a prehistoric tribe of mammoth hunters (out in what is probably meant to be the mountains of central Asia, or maybe it's Africa -- it's difficult to tell) has to go on an impossibly long trek with a few companions to rescue his woman, who has been kidnapped in a raid by a gang of horse-mounted slavers, who drag their captives home over mountains and deserts and through jungles, in order to put them to work building . . . something. Not a pyramid, exactly, but similar. I think. And the reason they're doing this is because they've been ordered to by some mysterious figures who are either aliens or refugees from Atlantis. Anyway, going all that way for a handful of laborers seems pretty inefficient, but the journey gives the hunter chief time to recruit an army of allies among the tribes he meets along the way. He also makes friends with a large sabertooth cat, learns about sailboats, and regrets not having invented the compass. Finally, the Good Guys reach the city of the Bad Guys, infiltrate the slave quarters, and foment a rebellion. All in all, the plot isn't bad, if you're not expecting Academy Award material, and the acting (all by actors you've never heard of, except for Omar Sharif supplying the narrative voice-over) isn't that bad. The camera work, however, sucks. So much of the film is set at night, or in dark surroundings, you'll find yourself squinting.",1228780800,,1883,4.623880597014925
3093887,4,B0012Q732O,"I was intrigued by the thought of this flick having been a fan of the Saber Tooth Tiger ever since learning about it as a kid.  Okay, the tiger is really way too big, maybe people were much smaller then but, wow, this thing was huge, but, the scenes around the mammoths and the tiger were just great, well done FX.

I had not seen many of the actors that were in this movie before, being filmed on location in New Zealand, South Africa and Namibia, this must have been a small economic boon for the latter two where obviously hundreds were given 'extra' opportunities.

I wonder though if after making the Day After Tomorrow, if the interloper being lily white has anything to do with his perspective.(?)  What the movie does include is the concept of 'the One' coming to save his people from slavery.  Instead of it being an alien race that is overlording others, it is a person who remains from others who had fled a land that had long since been destroyed.  So, the story has an apparent message or messages, but bravery and being willing to stand against tyranny is one of them.

The movie takes us from a small village on the tops of the mountains, great scenery in New Zealand, across a semi arid plain, through a tropical jungle repleat with giant birds, akin to the large bird that inhabits northern Australia and guts its prey.  However, these were like the raptors of Jurassic Park.  Even so, we go through more environments until we reach the desert.  I was fascinated by the large river in the desert that was reminiscent to the Nile or the Suez Canal ala 'Lawrence of Arabia.""

We have a story of liberation, a bit slow in places, but the graphics are very well done, the last few minutes are rather exciting as a method to get a job done.  We see the mammoths once again at the end.

If you want to watch a fantasy and like movies that have action, a story and an apparent message, this is worth it.  Omar Sharif narrates, but on the DVD you will find he was left on the cutting floor.

We'd slipped into some ruinous territory. Bad acting. Bad story. Laughable CGI wolves. And an ending that was putrid in both the film sense and science.

But I sucked it up and decided to give Roland another shot. I'd seen some extremely cool reviews of 10,000 BC prior to deciding on this course. But I'd seen bad reviews of movies I'd turned out to love, too. Alright, Roland, this was it. I slipped the Blu-Ray disc in and braced myself...

Yikes! What the...! Was this supposed to be some sort of joke? I mean, I don't mind suspending disbelief when I watch a piece of fiction, but let's try and make it at least watchable! What was so bad, you might ask?

First is you'd have to believe that prehistoric man could build temples, navigate rivers and maybe even oceans, smelt metals (come on!), and then come home and talk romantically to the love of his life. Gimme a break!

Steven Strait (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sky-High/dp/B000J6I0VG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sky High</a>) was given the unfortunate lead role as D'Leh, a hunter-gatherer turned warrior after the woman he loves (and will marry?) is kidnapped from his village by slave traders.

Okay, I do have to admit that the CGI/Blu-Ray transfer was nice. Particularly the representation of the Wooly Mammoths and the Sabertooth Tiger came across decent if over-the-top (the Sabertooth looked a tad bigger than I imagine they were).

""Native"" dialects soon give way to strong modern accents including more than a few who have apparently invented British inflections and the 'broken' language of 'primitives' becomes intermixed with complete grammatically correct sentences bearing $10 words.
I love the part where our hero falls into a pit trap containing a Saber-toothed tiger who apparently fell in, recovered the hole then pinned himself under a log so he couldn't move.

As for historical inaccuracies... well, really, who cares? Can we say '300'? Or any of the other hundreds of movies set in prehistoric/ancient/classical times that swerves so far from reality as to be completely unrelated? If it really bothers viewers so much, just do what I do: pretend it's somewhere else. Pretty easy, really.

I will say that the best part of this movie had nothing to do with special effects (which I thought were fairly impressive) or the acting (which... did leave something to the imagination) or the plot (yeah...), but with the music. Harold Kloser did an amazing job with this music, even if parts of it do sound strangely similar to 'The Day After Tomorrow'. Eh, who cares? There are times when I can't tell the 'Independence Day' and 'Stargate' soundtracks apart, but they are both very good.

The cover is misleading because the interaction between him and the tiger was surprisingly little.

The ending to the movie is what makes this into a fantasy over having any historical value. I never expected pyramids to be anywhere near. I was sort of wondering why the writer wanted to end it that way.

The movie does have a good message. It's about finding out who you are, learing to face fears and determination can win out against adversity. Of course we've seen movies that have dealt with these themes before, and better, but this movie is a nice escape for an hour or two.",1225238400,,942,4.371428571428571

3093901,2,B0012Q732O,"This movie is about a tribe of people living somewhere in the Eurasian landmass.  One day during winter, an adopted girl in their tribe is carried of by horsemen.  Three men (Ka'ren, D'leh, Tic-Tic) and one boy of the tribe follow them all the way to North Africa where they come across a pyramid being built by slave labor.  D'leh leads an uprising which frees the slaves and free the girl.  So that is the entire storyline.  Along the way the meet and befriend other tribes, and encounter various beasts.  As a movie, this would have been above-par if it was released in the 1980s.  But for the 21st century, this is a sub-par movie; for several reasons.  The primal flaw of the movie is the perfect English spoken by the main characters.  Though grunts and groans would have been awkward, the writers did give other tribes in the movie distinct, yet unreconizable languages, so why couldn't they do it with the main characters also?  The 2nd flaw of the movie is the simplicity, and plain orthodoxy of the plot.  Basically, we have a simple boy grow up, falls in love, travels across the known world to save her, and in the process rescue thousands from slavery.  Sounds like a adhoc mix of Spartacus, Kingdom of Heaven, Stargate, Pirates of the Caribbean, and a dozen other action - adventure movies over the past several decades.  The good thing is the family - friendliness of the movie; minimal blood, no gore, no nudity or close-up shots of anyone getting eaten.  Overall, an OK movie.",1224460800,,1493,4.6273764258555135

I had a couple of free coupons for Previously Viewed Movies at Blockbuster, so while browsing I came across this DVD at the local store and pounced on it like a big woolly mammoth! Upon checkout, the clerk asked me, ""Have you seen this film?""  I answered, ""Yes, and I really liked it.""  She shook her head and said, ""I have to agree with all the bad reviews; it's not even historically accurate.""  I don't know about the rest of you, but I grew up in the 60's and 70's and caught sci-fi movies from the 50's and 60's en masse, as well as King Kong, Godzilla and monster movies!  None of those could ever be deemed historically accurate, but that's not why I watched them.  They were entertaining as anything offered today, and my friends and I still engage in our memories of watching Saturday B movies back then!  What FUN!  Does anyone here remember ""Robinson Crusoe on Mars?""  An astronaut, crash lands on Mars, befriends a runaway slave whom he teaches English.  Along the way they eat and drink from Mars surface (and breathe as well) along with their pet Monkey, Mona.  Eventually, all three are rescued from the melting polar ice cap.  It was a suspended fun journey of disbelief, and to this day I remember that film fondly.  Ironically, I was reminded of the same fun journey of disbelief with ""10,000 BC.""

3093908,3,B0012Q732O,"I looked forward to watching this movie with great anticipation.  Unfortunately, after viewing it, I felt like I had been cheated.  I found the story somewhat difficult to follow, and I had a difficult time with the dialogue.

As for the movie's story, D'Leh (Steven Strait) is a young leader in his tribe.  Despite his father's betrayal to the tribe years ago, D'Leh has risen to a rank of leadership.  He has proven to be a fine hunter and is adept at handling a spear as well as hunting mastadons.  He has grown to love Evolet (Camilla Belle), a young, blue-eyed woman who was taken in by the tribe.  However, their dream of being together is shattered as the ""four-legged demons"" rampage through the camp and take hostages who are to become slaves in the serice of ""the Almighty"".

Throughout the film, D'Leh tracks the intruders who took his beloved Evolet.  His journey takes him from the heights of mountains to the depths of the jungle, and across the desert.  Along the way, D'Leh recruits the assistance of other peoples who have been put asunder by the almighty's minions.  Ultimately, D'Leh and his army reach the stronghold of the Almighty and his followers.  A great battle ensues, but will D'Leh and Evolet survive and finally be together?

Overall, I was somewhat disappointed with this film.  There are some very good parts, including the mastadon hunt, the race to escape from the large ostrich-like birds, and the encounter with the saber-toothed tiger.  But, unfortunately, these moments are cancelled out by many others that are not as good.  I can only give this movie an average rating.

3093915,3,B0012Q732O,"10,000 B.C. follows the character of D'Leh (Steven Strait), a member of a mountain-living tribe that makes their living from hunting mastodons.  D'Leh's father was the tribe's chief, but left the tribe and abandoned his family many years ago because of a prophecy.  D'Leh becomes an outcast.  Years later, because of his skills as a hunter and his sacrificial nature, D'Leh becomes a leader in his tribe.  The tribe is attacked by a group of warrior horsemen who take many captives, including the beautiful Evolet (Camilla Belle), D'Leh's fianc.  D'Leh sets forth on a dangerous journey south to rescue his tribemates.  His journey takes him from the plains, through the jungle, and across the desert.  He comes face to face with a saber-tooth tiger, is stalked by giant-lizard birds, and is joined by others who have lost friends and family to the invading horsemen.  Their journey culminates at Giza, Egypt.  It is there that D'Leh meets his destiny and fulfills a prophecy given years before.

The first thirty-minutes of 10, 000 B.C. moves rather slow.  Many films have a slow beginning because this is when filmmakers usually attempt to give whatever exposition they need for the story to progress.  10, 000 B.C. moves at a much slower rate than usual.  Once the exposition is set, the movie rockets forward.

I enjoyed watching 10,000 B.C.  I thought it was good for what it was, a complete mind-candy movie without any moral, message, or teachable moment.  The majority of complaints made about the film is that it is completely historical inaccurate.  I won't argue with anyone about that, but that's kind of the point of the whole movie.  The film was directed by Roland Emmerich, a director who's not known for staying true to historical accuracy or real-life plausibility.  It's just fun to watch people, mastodons, saber-toothed tigers, dinosaurs, and advanced Egyptian (alien?) technology come together in a fun, entertaining, and imaginative way on the screen.  Also, for as much action that happens in the film, one would think that the movie is not kid-friendly.  That is not the case.  10,000 B.C. is filled with action and some minor scenes of violence, but there is no gushing blood, no foul language, and no sex.

Then I realized it was directed by Roland Emmerich, the genius behind such classic travesties such as Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow.  Still, I remained undeterred.  CAVEMEN!  DINOSAURS!  Finally untethered from the shackles of fact, they were going to do glorious battle!  How can you possibly mess that up?  That's a question only Mr. Emmerich can answer, because he messed it up like a professional disaster.  In the end, the movie was too long and ACTUALLY BORING.  When you have no real intentions on making a quality movie about real characters, please don't spend time trying to developing.  That's like planting a rock in a ground and watering it and telling people it's going to grow into a beautiful tree.

3093918,5,B0012Q732O,"10,000 BC is an imaginative interpretation of the past that connects us to who we are today.  It is timeless mythology that could be told to hunter and gathers around a camp fire, and also touch our human yearning for mythology today.  Our need for mythology has not changed in 12,000 years.  We are basically the same humans.

 10,000 BC celebrates the beautiful social bonding humans have with each other, and says this quality is really what makes us civilized.  It completely made me rethink what we typically call an ""advanced"" civilization.  Does ""advanced"" mean technology, mathematics, and great architectural achievements?  Or is what truly makes us advanced is how we love our families, friends, and villagers, and how we can work together, using this social bonding to give us meaning?  It made me rethink respect for the Egyptian civilization and the great pyramids.  If you think about it, the pyramids are great accomplishment of human stupidity.  What ""great"" civilization would expend huge amounts of human effort to build enormous, pointless structures?  Was the Egyptian civilization really a totalitarian social structure that relied on huge amounts of slaves to carry out the religious wishes of the minority?  The next time you think ""wow"" about the Egyptian civilization, think about the probable human rights vialoations needed to build the pyramids, then your ""wow"" might change to ""yuk"".

 D,Ley grows into the hero in this epic story.  At first, he really just wants to save his girl.  Romantic love is his basic drive.  As his journey unfolds, he learns of his father.  He learns his father was a great man that allowed his people to believe he was a coward just so he could keep his struggling tribe together.  D,Ley's first attempt to rescue his girl Evolet shows lack of experience and impatience.  Tic'Tic, an older and wiser hunter, and friend of D,Ley's father, takes the time to pass his wisdom to D,Ley.  He teaches D,Ley some men take on a circle of responsibility that encloses many people.  When D,Ley has achieved full hero status, he leads thousands from various cultures to ""take them down"".  Joseph Campbell would have loved it.

 There is also something about 10,000 BC that is genius.  10,000 BC turns mythology inside out and shows how myth is intertwined with prophecy.  Tic'Tic teaches prophecy can be fulfilled in many ways.  Prophecy is what aids our hero.  Without the prophecy, D,Ley could not have gathered such an army, and could not have exploited the weakness of the Almighty.  D'Ley fulfills these prophecies because people want to see them fulfilled.  When you watch 10,000 BC, you are watching the mythology unfold in all its accidental luck but ultimately fueled by our greater human qualities.  Qualities such as love, friendship, loyalty, courage, respect, and honor is the real driving force, not prophecy.  These qualities are really what makes our hero and his people the more advanced civilization.  When you watch 10,000 BC, you may not realize it, but you become a participant of mythology.  Your very own yearning for great, meaningful story telling is awakened.  The alternate ending shows the narator concluding the story to a future generation.  I'm thinking they should have stuck with that ending to bring home the fact you are watching a fictionalized story packaged as a handed down myth.  This would have helped some people ""get"" this movie.  It justifies why the saber-tooth tiger was so big.  It's a story.  Stories exaggerate for effect.

 Many people have criticized 10,000 BC as being historically a farce.  Well, watch the bonus material on the blu-ray about the book ""Fingerprints of the Gods"" by Graham Hancock.  Hancock is interviewed and talks about maps found showing land mass before the ice age in their predicted location given continental drift.  This is a complete unaddressed mystery.  It suggests there were advanced civilizations way earlier than 2,500 BC.  So ""10,000 BC"" takes some liberty on a possibility for this mystery.  We don't know everything about our past.  But what makes ""10,000 BC"" so great is that it helps us realize to understand the value of our current civilization, we need to understand our fundamental nature as hunter and gathers.  Our basic social instincts come from living in small groups.  A civilization that drifts too far from our social origins will eventually fall, as many ""advanced"" civilization in the past have.",1220227200,6,4443,5.031593406593407

And that cool tiger on the poster had me expecting some great special effects.

Well, the special effects were very good.  And the score was good at times too, though it did seem over-done after a while with very few softer parts.  But that's where the good ends.

For starters, this movie really made me resent the over-use of narration in movies.  When you watch the deleted scenes and alternate ending, it's clear the narrator was telling the story to the next generation.  Yet the final cut of this movie doesn't let you see that.  It didn't really matter though, because I found myself alternately wondering ""is this just a little over-dramatic"" and ""they spoke english with a British accent in 10000 BC?""

And of course the historical inaccuracies were unavoidable.  I understand some want to give them a pass on that, but then they shouldn't have named this after a year.  Apparantly, all white people had dreadlocks 10000 BC.  And all the races of the world were within a few days walk of each other too.  Still,  I can accept a movie as a work of fantasy except when the story is weak.  And the story is very weak.

The movie starts off with cheesy prophecies and the young hero speaking way more seriously than a kid could about ""eternal love"" in his heart. Never mind, everything that happens was in a prophecy.  And oh yeah, no matter where this guy walks everybody knew his father. In fact, the entire story line is unbelievable even as a fantasy movie because it's inconsistent with itself.  It gets funny fast.

Other than the aforementioned deleted scenes and alternate ending, there's no special features to speak of.  Some of those scenes have some incomplete CG sequences that made me laugh too.

If you are not too critical, sure you can enjoy this.  But there are just too many better movies to watch to really go out of your way to see this.  Wait for it to play on cable.

We have a young girl with blue eyes taken in by a primitive tribe.  They have a prophecy that she and one of their warriors will save their people.  And until she is kidnapped by four legged demons (men on horses) all the viewer gets is the narrator talking and the men hunting.  That's it.  While ""Clan"" was based on a heavily researched book, with an engaging heroine and interesting historical details, ""BC"" is a hodgepodge of history and the narrator doesn't have anything vital to reveal.  I agree with the reviewer who felt there should be more sex and violence befitting such a savage time.  Normally, I don't care for gratuitous sex or violence but in this instance I heartily agree.  Something needed to jump start this film.  After the kidnapping, things didn't pick up much either.  Our hero goes after her and we follow the three men tracking them for far too long.  Along the way, our hero runs into a tribe of african people, who happily form an army for him since he fulfills one of their prophecies, and the climax is all set up. Finally, the film starts moving along, only viewers will feel like they are suddenly watching Stargate.

The hero arrives at a huge construction site by the river.  Many thousands of slaves are building a pyramid for ""The Almighty,"" a mysterious figure attended by robed men and young boys - just like Ra in Stargate.  Even his building and chambers look like Ra's!  And he'll face defeat from a primitive people to boot.  And guess what?  The Almighty has a prophecy that a Hunter with a mark will come to destroy him!  Despite the total lack of originality, and yet another prophecy, the very predictable ending still managed to make the movie worth watching.  A stampede of Mammoths, thousands of extras, lots of fighting, and a triumph of good over evil are always attention grabbing.  And, I just love a happy ending.

Overall, this movie could have been so much better if they had cut out the boring overview of the tribe in the beginning in favor of more information about The Almighty.  We never learn where he came from, how he took control, nothing.  He was far more interesting a character than the hero, and he didn't get much screen time.  Still, if you're looking for a movie to pass the time, this wasn't bad.  But, I'd recommend renting it.",1218585600,46,3419,5.48565965583174
3093934,3,B0012Q732O,"10,000 BC brings to the screen a fictional portrayal of life 12,000 years ago, where a young man embarks on a journey to free his beloved from the clutches of ruthless slavers that have ventured into his clan's icy domain. His journey will take him to foreign lands where he will meet exotic peoples, frightening creatures, and mysterious cultures. What awaits at the end of his travels, however, may be more than he bargained for...
There are slight hints of Conan, Mad Max, the Last of the Mohicans, and Jurassic Park, and strong/obvious elements of Quest for Fire, Mel Gibson's Apokalypto, and most importantly Stargate.

The major setbacks are in relation to:
1) The movie starting off slow and failing to catch the viewer's attention.
2) Very little accuracy regarding the human civilization of that era.
3) The movie should have included sex and violence for the sake of realism and not a mellowed down version of the era in order to sell more tickets.
4) The acting is mediocre and it seems as though the chemistry between the actors is not all that great.
5) To that, one has to add the poor dialogues and the bad choice of lines that the actors are given.
6) As for the characters, they are weak, bland and just plain uninteresting.

In short, the acting and the music are mediocre, the setting is great, the plot is interesting though predictable and unoriginal (could have been amazing!), while the dialogues are `below average.'
The potential for a good movie was there, however, it fails to take off.

(*NOTE* Some SPOILERS)

A simple tribe of prehistoric hunters finds its way of life threatened when attacked by ""four-legged demons."" Homes are burned and people taken to lands unknown. The village's best hunters take off in pursuit, becoming, as the narrator says, hunters no longer, but warriors.

D'Leh, the lead character played by Steven Strait, is determined to rescue Evolet, the love of his life, along with the other hunters who were taken from the tribe, and without whom the people will starve. Thrust into the unasked-for role of Hero, D'Leh leads an army of many tribes to liberate thousands of captives-now slaves.

Visually, this is a decent film. CG effects are well blended with the action, and the cast acted out their roles in an acceptable manner. That said, this movie left a lot to be desired. The plot is based on a tired storyline with predictable turns: Hero's village is attacked; Hero must rescue people; Hero displays special ability or fits prophecy; Hero faces danger; Hero wins, with minimal losses.

One thing that annoyed me was that D'Leh seemed to care more about getting his girl back than anything else around him. He pulls it out in the end and even manages to care, but until that point, he is very one-dimensional.

Hollywood loves its beasties. The production team behind 10,000 B.C. is no exception, with massive prehistoric monstrosities, which was the most impressive part of the movie. Mastodons (""Mannak""), a saber-toothed tiger (""Spear Tooth""), and a herd of two-story carnivorous emu-like birds provide some action-oriented eye candy. Other than that, however, the entire movies comes off flat.

It's not horrible, but it's not great. If you have Netflix, go for it. Is it worth buying a copy? Not on my dime.

3093961,3,B0012Q732O,"Steven Strait dons animal skins and sets out to save the prophesied ""child with blue eyes"" (who happens to be his love interest) in Roland Emmerich's ""10,000 B.C.""

While it's enjoyable enough to watch, ""B.C."" just doesn't feel like the grand epic it should be.  It has all the necessary ingredients to be an epic:  an unlikely hero, a beautiful damsel (and tribe) in distress, a menacing enemy with seemingly supernatural powers, an angry god/ruler and gigantic roadblocks for the hero.  Despite having all of these components, though, it just doesn't click as an epic.

Steven Strait's portrayal of the hero, D'leh, is sufficient, but I never felt that he truly took charge of the adventure.  Camilla Belle's role as the blue-eyed love interest has a ton of potential, but she's relegated to a lot of long looks (with emphasis on the eyes, of course) into valleys, fearful looks into the general direction of a god, and a couple of weak attempts at taking matters into her own hands.  The most interesting character of the lot was, to me, Nathanael Baring's portrayal of Baku.  The rest of the cast, though gamely played, never really interested me that much.

Granted, the mammoths, giant birds and (somewhat fake-looking) sabertooth tiger were fun to watch and the final battle was nothing short of grand, but the overall feel of this film was ho-hum.

As far as the DVD is concerned, the film looks wonderful.  The special features include some deleted scenes and an alternate ending that, in my opinion, works better than the one actually used in the film.

Would I recommend it as a purchase?  Probably not.  While it's an okay film, there's just nothing about it that makes it very special.  If it comes on television, be sure to watch it unless there's a football game on or one of Emmerich's other films.

This was a fantastic movie!
In defense of the historical aspects of the film: I applaud the writers and directors for giving us a better view of civilization in ancient times than what we are used to. We are not often told that Homo Sapien has existed in its exact form since 250,000 B.C. Same brain size, same body size, same ability to reason, same capacity to love. Pick up a history book and prove it to yourself. Amazon has thousands of them! They were masters of the world they lived in at the time, like we are masters of the world we live in today. Historically, this film is more accurate than inaccurate. Put aside the presupposition that the pyramids were built around 2500 B.C. according to our accepted historical time-line and what you have is a wealth of imagery describing how we hunted the mammoth, how we captured the saber tooth tiger and how we were hunted and eaten by downgraded dinosaurs in the form of giant birds!
Is it conceivable that racism didn't exist between the dark skinned tribes of the African savannah and the pale skinned men of the mountains? Or did they wonder at each other? Dreams and visions are often mentioned in ancient literature as belonging to the most sacred member of a tribe. It's Shaman, mystic, medicine man, etc! These people busied themselves with knowledge and wisdom while everyone else in the clan had their purpose and goals. Wouldn't you want to see how they might have lived, created, communicated, learned, stood together side by side united for a cause and died for what they believed in! And how appropriate that this work is a love story! No one can deny that as a race, man's awareness to love spans the ages, knows no limit and sets us apart from animal instinct!
I can understand how those who are not fans of ancient history can sit back and wonder why the dumb cave man isn't poking sticks into an anthill to eat the ants but the reality is, that cave man is you without technology! Could you hunt the African elephant without a rifle? Could you feed you family without a grocery store? Would you travel hundreds of miles on foot? Ancients were not dumb! They were brilliant at surviving and learning how to control their environment, or we would not be here today.
Most of what we think we know of ancient history is merely a lot of guesswork anyway. Compared to the complexity of human life, facts from these times are limited. The filmmakers have put together an incredible interpretation based on a mixture of fact, guesswork and pure fantasy! You want a documentary watch the history channel, you want a good story see this movie.",1217289600,7,2733,4.602459016393443

Slightly before 10,000 BC...I guess; a small tribe resides in mountains somewhere. Old Mother, the tribe's profit, has a prophecy when the tribe finds a small blue eyed girl in the arms of a dead woman near their camp. The prophecy tells of four legged demons who will come to end their way of life which is already starting to crack as the mannicks (Woolly Mammoth) from which the tribe gets much of it's food and leather have begun to come later and later with each passing year. Most believe the prophecy but one man doesn't and he sets off to find an answer to the tribe's problem leaving his son behind. Fast forward to 10,000 BC, the four legged demons arrive and capture much of the tribe. The remaining members set off to rescue the members of the tribe with D'Leh at the head of the group motivated to rescue his woman the blue eyed girl...

If popcorn flicks with poor plots, acting, dialogue and special effects are for you, then you have found your line of entertainment for the next 109 minutes.

The Good: There are very few bright points in this dud of a flick. The movie doesn't lack for action and fight scenes which are up to par for the caliber of this movie. The lead girl is kind of hot in a ""Cave woman"" type of way, so theres that.

The Bad: I don't know when the continental shift took place but it would appear that the creators of this movie believe it took place sometime after 10,000 BC. Our hero and his band set off from mountains that look like something you would expect to see in Europe and then traverse rather quickly into something that looks very much like a rain forest then immediately traverse into the desert. I looked at an atlas after viewing this and just can't seem to find the path our band of adventurers took to reach their final destination.

The dialogue in this is absolutely horrid, and the plot and way the story unfolds is ludicrous. All of the action in the movie feels very inserted like the producers were sitting around going over the script and said ""Alright, it's been 5 pages without an action beat, what can we add here?"" I could go on and on but, a poor plot, poor dialogue, and a lack of logic make something that could have been a mediocre movie into a sub par one.

The hairy elephants (don't know what they're called in English :) ) were ok. About as nice as the ones in LOTR. But the Sabretooth Tiger was just not realistic enough. And the ""interaction"" with it was too far fedged! Come on, this is a wild beast! not some nice little kitten!
 Lots of deja vu's as well. Especially from LOTR and Jurassic park. The whole ""run through high vegetation area while being chased by unknown beasts"" is just a Jurassic Park rip off.

This one tells a tale of good over evil, of the banding together of different people to right a wrong. The special effects are very good and the battle scenes are done well.
I'm certainly not a film student and I don't like picking a film apart to analyze every nuance of a movie, but I think that even with a big budget, well known stars and big special effects you can still put out a real stinker, if you have no story.

3094036,1,B0012Q732O,"Why does this movie suck so much?

Because it is stupid as hell. And boring and very unoriginal. I'm kinda tired of people saying that a movie like this is just for fun, blah, blah, blah. Of coarse it is. My idea of fun can include -and very often does- the improbable and fantastic. It's when it is done in ways that don't make any sense and aren't interesting or original that I think a movie sucks and deserves 1 star on Amazon. (Actually I don't care as much about stuff making a whole lot of sense if it's interesting and entertaining and smart. Ex. the plot of Hellboy 2) When you call the movie 10,000 B.C., I don't know, I just sort of assume that part of the idea is to have a movie set on Earth about 10,000 years ago about prehistoric people. That sounds interesting except they gave the middle finger to not only good, exciting story telling but trying to portray what the world 10,000 years ago was actually like. If you want to do a fantasy world call it Middle Earth or something. The movie is screwy in multiple ways: right next to a frozen mountain range ice age environment lies a lush tropical jungle which borders a vast desert; the silly accents and tribes and a completely fictional civilization that is part rip off of ancient Egypt and the Persian Empire as depicted in ""300""; an absurd plot -it's like a dull highchool kid read some Joseph Campbell and this is his first effort at script writing (maybe not too much worse than George Lucas); bad dialogue; bad editing; etc. I can chill and let somethings slide if it all overall works. It doesn't. Sadly, most Americans would probably consider it more or less accurate and a pretty good movie.. The general public has a very low standard for what counts as a good movie.

I found the flawed but fascinating ""Quest for Fire"" to be very well done and better worth your time if you feel like watching a story about cavemen.

The story was all over the place and there were many flaws to be had. I am not talking about flaws in history.  None of us were alive then, so nobody knows what it was like anyway. A few of the special effects were done horribly.  The sabertooth was obviously fake. The golden pyramid tip falling down looked very fake.

Another flaw in the story was the giant birds. The one guy gets attacked and even injured, but when whats his name returns, the guy is still alive.  So everyone is dead and eaten except for him.  So what? His bird got full and gave up?

Did anyone notice how well groomed these ""cave men"" were.  If you pay very good attention, did anyone notice that the women had shaved legs and arm-pits?  Wow, didn't ever think they would shave those things way back when.  I so hate when the film makers do not pay attention to detail.

I don't know. We watch a lot of movies and usually find the good in even the bad ones. This one has nothing good. We were never so bored in our lives waiting for something to happen. We got the blu-ray version and it really doesn't look all that good compared to other movies.

I picked it up hoping it would have some semblance to human history, and see how the director had visualized a time about twelve thousand years ago. This movie has nothing to do with history. I am not an expert but 12,000 ago years humans were in the stone age (at least accoring to wiki) - there were no metal spear heads, saber-tooth cats were nowhere as large as they are depicted. The geographic location is not clear - where they in Africa, or Europe? The characters seem racially diverse - how did such mingling happen so long ago? And there were definitely no large Egyptian-structures built that long ago.
Well, ok. So, you stretch your imagination - maybe a civilization did exist that got wiped out. But first the movie seems a rip-off of so many others - Gibson's Apocalypto foremost, a bit of Jurassic Park and some others. Then, the dialogs appear very discontinuous - maybe an amateur screenplay writer? And finally, the storyline is very weak - sometimes it makes you feel that the story was just made along.
The CGI animation was not too bad as some reviewers said - about the same standard as King Kong, but less slick. There is violence, but far less gore than apocalypto.

3094066,1,B0012Q732O,"Recently, the category of politically-biased action films is growing exponentially.  Some are right-wing (Lord of the Rings), some are left-wing (Lions for Lambs), some are pro-Christian (Narnia), some are pro-integration, some are anti, some want more funding in Congress to save the environment (The Day After Tomorrow), etc...  It's getting harder and harder to find films without an agenda, for the purposes of pure entertainment (like Ocean's 13, for example).  This one has such an obvious message, and such a negligible and linear plot, that a child can figure it out. Even the actors can tell that this film is a racket, judging by their minimum effort. Here goes:  The good guys, all look Middle-Eastern and African.  The corrupt dictator is white.  The eunuch minions serve the corrupt dictator, in a way designed to make them look like pro-west Arab leaders.  The tiger in the plot, obviously symbolizes China. ('The Great Tiger' being it's nickname, even though it's not it's National Animal). The leading man, becomes the hero when he liberates the tiger and the tiger in turn doesn't eat him, but is grateful instead. Finally, the wooly-mammoths are the good-guys' most precious resource, being exploited by the corrupt dictator to build his great pyramids.  Obviously, the mammoths represent OIL and the pyramids represent THE WEST.  So here is the subconscious plot:  This film is designed to empower the Middle East and Africa to sell their oil to China, and to not be afraid of deposing pro-west governments (symbolized, again, by the Anglo-looking, illegitimate demigod).  It would be interesting to ""follow the money"" and see exactly who the hell paid for this lump of crap, and who and why wrote the script. One thing is certain:  It reeks of Chinese-intel psy-ops.  Typical Marxist/Maoist propaganda to create class-struggles along racial lines, much like Soviet propaganda in Latin America during the Cold War.  Of course, the film is 'coincidentally' released when Iraq is gearing up to (finally) hand-out oil contracts. The fact they got a good director is beyond me, but I suspect that 'money is money'.

Well, no movie is accurate to history simply because we weren't there, we'll never know, and half to writing history is covering up the truth.  So stop whining about it you fools, nothing is EVER going to be accurate.  Not only that but it was totally obvious from the commercials this wouldn't be an accurate movie, let alone the fact that its made by Ranold or whatever his name is that made bloody GODZILLA, or INDEPENDENCE DAY.

Here is a good summary for many retards and their moronic comments on various topics.  I found this from a commentor named Adam:
As for the cavemen speaking English, this is simple. 1) They weren't cave men, they lived in huts. This denotes some sort of movement to an agricultural based society. This is further given proof by the fact that they WAIT for the herd of mammoths to come; they don't follow them like nomadic hunters would. 2) The answer to the English is very simple. They didn't speak English. How did you not pick up on this fact? Whenever they went to other areas the new people spoke in a different language, THEN they switched to English. This was done so the entire movie wouldn't be in subtitles like Apocalypto.
Well put Adam.

But aside from that people are right, everything in this was boring.  Dialogue, interactions, characters, story, everything was totally boring.  There was virtually no saber-tooth tiger in the entire movie, maybe like 2 minutes worth, which was a real bummer.  He looked badarse.

CGI was great, though its all in the eye of the beholder, no hard fact saying its great or not.  I liked it.

This is actually a decent family Summer movie. There is no bad language or sex, but some normal fighting violence. Even the violence is not the typical grossly spatter everyone with blood. I found the movie entertaining and the acting was actually pretty good. I would have given it three and a half stars if I could of and I even considered four stars. In fact with a bit more money this might have rivaled ""Apocalypto"". This may not have had the budget or directing capability of such a movie, but rating it with typical B movies like ""One Million Years B. C."", with Raquel Welch, is ridiculous. Don't get me wrong I found even that one fun to watch. But this is far more entertaining than most caveman movies I have seen before, even if it is not entirely historically accurate. Considering recent discoveries about cavemen though this is not as far fetched as some would have you believe.

The story centers around a prophecy of a man that is a hunter who speaks with a spear tooth (Sabertooth Tiger) leading people to their freedom. We see this man from childhood along with several others so we don't instantly know for sure who our hero will be. As a young boy he meets a beautiful blue eyed girl that was found by his tribe. They are linked from then on as he does everything he can to ensure her safety and make her his woman. The story, acting, directing, camera work, music, sets, and effects are reasonably good. The scenery is a key part as they travel from snow covered mountains through desert and jungle. The exceptional photography makes it stand out in detail.

Never were there wooly mammoth sized pauses or unnecessary delays in the story or action. (Thanks to 'Independence Day' director Roland Emmerich and editor Alexander Berner.) Visually, the action is well framed and expertly shot.  They may have taken liberties with history, but we're not really supposed to care.  Giant ostriches and saber tooth tigers?  Well, I thought man wasn't as well developed by then and animal evolution was far behind, but the movie isn't  pretentious (well, okay, except maybe the title); it's an adventure meant to entertain.  We even reach a well-developed civilization by then, far beyond cave man culture.

The plot is about as simple as the people who fill the screen.  O'Leh (Steven Strait) is the Beowulf of cavemen times.  He must rescue his woman, Evolet (Camilla Belle), and free his people while repairing the reputation of his allegedly cowardly father.  (I guess chivalry didn't start in medieval times after all.)  His companions, like Tic'Tic (Cliff Curtis) provide more conflict and tension to the story, and, in the prehistoric fray are visions and visionaries (like Old Woman) who forecast the future and give advice.  Most warriors rely on signs and wonders rather than on primitive compasses.  Customs bind them all, and a handle on nature is the key to tribal success.

Compared to other cave men movies, this one is ahead by every frame.  Wisely, we mostly get people talking in our own language without all the ""Ugh's"" and grunts of past early man movies.  I can't emphasize enough how beautiful the scenes are shot as the tribe whizzes through snowy mountains, endless jungles, and vast deserts.  As dangers come before them, the menace is close to the camera and harrowing to watch.

Don't expect the film to be the next `Jurassic Park' or as intense as '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mel-Gibson-s-Apocalypto-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000NOKFHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mel Gibson's Apocalypto (Widescreen Edition)</a>' or '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/300-Full-Screen-Edition/dp/B000QXDEDG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">300 (Full Screen Edition)</a>,' but if you want a movie that gives you something to look at for nearly two hours and never lets up, '10,000 B.C.' is essential viewing.

I think the film is very likely influenced by the writings of fantasy action writer Robert E. Howard and certainly bears resemblance to the Conan films.  The film takes place in prehistoric times when mammoths, saber-toothed cats, and giant birds roamed the landscape and men lived a simple hunter-gatherer type existence in the central Eurasian mountains (probably taking some liberty with actual historical fact of course).  The film focuses on the Yagahl tribe who live in harmony with nature hunting mammoths.  Two important characters from this tribe will serve as the central protagonists for the story - the young hunter D'Leh and the beautiful Evolet.  In addition, the old mother, a shaman woman of the Yagahl tribe, plays a central role in the story.  One day while hunting the mammoth, a group of warlords manage to kidnap Evolet and the young hunter must pursue them across the Levant in his effort to save her.  However, after passing through many terrors, the hunter and his band of warriors encounter an evil civilization where they must work as slaves building great pyramids for ""the Almighty"", a mysterious god-man who controls the slaves and for whom they must pay constant tribute.  ""The Almighty"" demands that one of their own must be sacrificed to show the slaves that they must work harder for him.  Ultimately, it is D'Leh who must lead the slaves in a rebellion against this evil man worshipped as a god and in an effort to rescue his love Evolet.  Unfortunately, Evolet bears a mark upon her hand which shows her to be one of great power which ""the Almighty"" fears.  In a fitting end, the noble D'Leh leads his people and the other slave peoples in a glorious revolt against the wicked masters.  The masters show themselves to be cowards as they beg before their god ""the Almighty"".  However, D'Leh manages to throw a spear piercing ""the Almighty"" and thus killing him proving once and for all that he was no god but a mere mortal and evil man.  Sic semper tyrannis!  The slaves escape their masters, but first a last challenge must be faced by D'Leh and Evolet, and oddly the role of the old mother is to play an important part here.  Thus, ends this film.

I found this film to be highly enjoyable and was particularly fond of the brilliant scenes.  This film has been compared to Mel Gibson's _Apocalypto_ (2006) and I believe that makes a good comparison.

3094145,5,B0012Q732O,"10,000 BC wasn't all that bad. All right, yes it was, but I managed to sit through the whole thing, which is more than I can say for a lot of movies these days. It was entertaining in a mindless, drooling sort of way and the effects were good enough to keep me borderline conscious from start to finish. The geography in this thing was seriously confused, to say the least. The main characters, apparently northern European mammoth hunters, cross a mountain range which appears to be the Alps, emerging in sub-Saharan Africa, at which point they head back across the desert to find themselves in Egypt, where woolly mammoths are being used to build the pyramids. Now, I'm too lazy to actually look this up, but I was under the impression that there were no mammoths in Ancient Egypt and everybody knows that shape-shifting reptilian aliens actually built the pyramids, not that it really matters. I don't want to give away the plot, so I'll just say that it's basically the same as Apocalypto, a truly great movie, proving once again that no concept is immune to recycling by midgets. The grand finale of 10,000 BC is almost as stupid as the ending of the TV version of The Stand, one of the dumbest scenes ever filmed, but the body count was high enough to keep me amused for a couple of hours, so I'll give it a five stars. What the hey.  Is it worth watching? Hell, no, but if you're determined to stare blankly at something, dribbling all over yourself, it might as well be this.

Maybe they could have spoken caveman and we could have read the whole movie in subtitles. Who cares if mammoths didn't live in Egypt, or at least some place that reminded one of Egypt? There are no such things as invisible goblins and stuff but I still liked the spiderwick chronicles. Was it boring? Well, it was not non stop action to be sure but it wasn't boring either. At least blood and gore wasn't relied on to carry the story line.

I love campy shows like Xena: Warrior Princess, Sheena, Baywatch, classic cartoon Masters of the Universe, and Cleopatra 2525.

3094214,3,B0012Q732O,"Coming off some rather poor reviews, I expected failure from this movie, and the first ten minutes delivered all the fail I anticipated. After that, it drastically improved, and while it didn't succeed as an epic, it was very lively and highly imaginative.

Starting with the bad, most of the dialogue just plain sucks. It's great that they tried to make the people sound simple, being this is 10,000 BC, but the kids (D'leh and Evolet) had these really painfully Arab-esque accents and awkward dialogue reminiscent of Attack of the Clones Padme and Anakin. The dumb little kid who follows the hunters also is an embarrassing addition, but thankfully his dialogue is limited.

The minor characters, such as the English-speaking African chief, are the only characters who really shine with their simplistic dialogue, and even D'leh sometimes narrowly misses having his lines crumble to sheer stupidity.

Also a major detractment is the narrator, who is mostly completely un-needed save to further some events. Other times, we really don't need to hear him, such as the very end when the Old Mother supposedly 'breathes life' into Evolet. The images showed this clearly enough without needless narration.

In the beginning, the special effects are rather poor, as you can very clearly see that a character doesn't fit in the background environment, as if they were filmed in front of a green screen, and then attempts at digitally removing the green glare only smeared the picture.

Also, it was clearly not necessary to have the ice people of D'leh speak English, as they are the only English-speaking tribe in the movie, and it would have far better served the atmosphere to have them speaking a more primitive language, with more hand and facial gestures than verbosity.

The action sequences, costumes, cinematography, and sets were spectacular, and managed to tell the greater story (oppressed tribes banding together to overthrow a tyrant) in a way that far supersedes the main individual story of D'leh trying to save Evolet, though from the prophetic viewpoint, it was interesting how they twisted the two together, having it be that only D'leh's desire to save Evolet could make him lead the tribes to freedom. To sum, the movie succeeds in macro-storytelling, but fails in micro-storytelling.

As for the historical accuracy... it's very imaginative. And it requires you to use your imagination to explain certain things.

For one, the pyramids in what is clearly Egypt. I thought it was a great explanation to show them using Mammoths to pull their limestone (since even today historians are marveled at how they could have pulled such stones with manpower alone), and though the first pyramids were built some 7,000 years after this movie takes place, the movie makes sure that it is left open to interpretation.

What? The pyramids are barely half-way completed in the movie, and the slaves and tribes revolt against their ruler (a tall, godlike figure who must maintain his illusion of divinity to a point of never being seen; his personal slaves are all blind), leaving the pyramids incomplete. You could easily imagine that the pyramids could left incomplete for thousands of years, before a civilization known to us as the Egyptians of hieroglyphs and mummies worked to complete them. Sands could have eroded the pyramids, covering them up completely, or who knows? The movie doesn't definitively say the pyramids were built in 10,000 BC: only that they were begun, and presumably not completed by the original builders.

In all, it's a beautifully done movie, which suffers from poor micro-storytelling. If the total story were in the forefront, and the love story reduced to a subplot, I think it would have been a far better movie.",1214524800,2,3749,5.051779935275081

It may or may not be on the mark about Mammoths, Saber Tooth, and Man-eating birds, but this was twelve millenniums ago.  Can anyone watching this movie state with any first hand experience what our ancient ancestors did or did not see or do?

This is about entertainment, not historical fact.  The story line is appealing, the acting is far better than what most of the anti-BC crowd states and the cinematography is very good.

Camilla Bell the main attraction was almost speechless and acted like in ""the Quiet"" where she played deaf. The lead character happen to wondered upon some prehistoric Terror Bird from 62-2 million years ago. Maybe there were saber-tooth tiger in the desert of African right by the Pyramid. Or somehow slave woolly mammoth were used to help build the pyramid. I believed the first Egyptian's Pyramid was built in 2600bc way later.

This is a pointless movie that took elements from other great movies and decided the timeline that would fit all this mess is 10,000BC.

Gladiators had better acting then this. The Geiko's Cavemen are a lot funnier then this. Being in the desert seem more agonizing in Passions of the Christ then this movie.

The main actors deliver for the genre: Steven Strait- muscular, ruggedly handsome, angst; Camilla Belle- beautiful, wistful, longing, angst.  The evil guys evil.

The downers: the story's a bit hokey and, of course, it's predictable. And the romance could be richer.

3094258,3,B0012Q732O,"If, while munching popcorn and viewing Roland Emmerich's latest saga, ""10,000 B.C."", you keep sensing an acute case of deja-vu, don't be alarmed...the film is eerily similar to Mel Gibson's 2006 ""Apocalypto"" (simply switch the Mayans to Atlanteans, and toss in some mastodons), with moments of the Karl Urban 2007 Viking/Native American epic, ""Pathfinder"" slipped in for good measure, and a finale lifted from Emmerich's own 1994 Sci-Fi near-classic, ""Stargate"" (I half expected Kurt Russell and James Spader to emerge from the rubble of the fallen pyramid). Clearly, these 'lifts' are something for the Writer's Guild of America to muse over, but for a non-discriminating viewer, the film is an acceptable time-passer, if no classic.

The story, surprisingly, is often a bit flat, although the CGI mastodons, man-eating ostriches, and a saber-tooth tiger are fun (if not particularly believable). As is frequently the case in these tales (at least since ""Conan the Barbarian""), prehistoric humans were so hardy that they could survive near-Arctic cold in a minimum of clothing, were so unfamiliar with horses and boats that they referred to them as ""four-legged monsters"" and ""big birds"", yet had mastered engineering to a point where they were creating spectacular structures rivaling modern Las Vegas at it's gaudiest. The logic of all this escapes me, but Emmerich is a master of ""don't think, just watch"" storytelling, and makes it all work.

With bloodless battles, little romance (other than talk), and clearly-defined 'good guys' and 'bad guys', this is a film you can view with the entire family, which is a plus, these days! So, if your expectations aren't too high, this may be a good addition for your library.",1214265600,9,1722,5.190647482014389

Numerous reviews have already compared this film to `Apocalypto' and I hate to be repetitive but I must agree.

For me the most fascinating aspects of the film were the inclusion of pyramids and the beginnings of the Sphinx emerging from the sand. Further enhanced by the mention of rulers coming from the stars, or arriving from a sinking continent (i.e.: Altantis) there were definitely strong hints of a `Stargate' type ending on the horizon. From a personal perspective I believe the writers missed a great opportunity by not exploring the mythic and extraterrestrial aspects further.

However that's just wishful thinking on my part. Not much here of interest for the adults, but a young audience will probably love it, you know how they feel about dinosaurs.",1214265600,6,953,4.913043478260869

Let me be honest when I tell you that it is what it may have appeared, it is the typical Emmerich piece and it lacks serious depth and contains some terrible acting along with ridiculous dialogue. At times the CGI simply doesn't blend into what's actually taking place, during a scene where one of the tribesmen is running with a hoard of Mammoth there are parts where you clearly see that when one of the men is looking up at the Mammoth, you clearly see he's looking in the wrong direction and mistakes like this occur during the entire movie constantly ruining the illusion. With these mistakes however it's not to say that this is the worst film I've ever seen as, at times it is a very exciting picture and something that can entertain you for the runtime duration, the CGI although with the mistakes is impressive and does have your imagination running wild, which I guess is a good point.

The story is of an ancient Eurasian mountain tribe known as the Yaghal who in order to survive must hunt and kill wild Mammoth. One of the young hunters known as D'leh meets his true love Evolet and they become instantly attached, but one day that relationship is torn apart when a tribe of horse riding Warlords invade their village and kidnap Evolet. Following this D'leh and a small troop of hunters set on a quest in order to rescue Evolet and punish the warlords, but along the way they face dangers like Sabre-Tooth Cats and Terror Birds. Further on their journey they encounter other tribes who have faced the same wrath of the warlords and they all band together to form an army which will take on the ""God"" who has taken Evolet as his slave to build pyramids that reach into the skies.

As historically incorrect as it may be, it's still a worth while entertaining movie, but all you have to manage is to put the fact that you're watching terrible acting and try your best to ignore the dialogue.",1214006400,,2129,4.4704370179948585

3094321,1,B0012Q732O,"I really don't expect film greatness from Roland Emmerich. His films may not be great but at least they are enjoyable, well, except for Godzilla. But even Godzilla was better than this mess which is why I nominate this flick for the 'BM' Award (I know what you're thinking....BM means Bad Movie). All previous criticisms aside, this is a badly acted, badly edited film. And let's not get into the awful storyline. The CGI work is cheesy, especially the laughable saber-toothed tiger. The Mastodon sequence is fine, if you don't look real hard, but much of the rest of the CGI work is woefully bad.

Any film, good or mediocre, must pass the audience test. The test: Can the audience willfully suspend disbelief of what he or she sees on the screen. 10,000 BC does not pass this test. Not even as a fantasy film.

 I recently saw Pathfinder, a film similar in its directed intended audience. Like 10,000 BC, Pathfinder bears little resemblance to actual history, human culture,  or geography but it works well as a popcorn fantasy film. You can enjoy Pathfinder even though you know it is just fantasy and not real history. Pathfinder correctly imitates its comic book origins. 10,000 BC does not.

I can go on forever about the historical inaccuracies in 10,000 BC.  Some writers here have praised this film as a great fantasy and have criticized other reviewers for reviewing this film as historically accurate stating that it was not meant to be historical. But the film never indicates that it is a fantasy. In fact it attempts to convince the audience that the film is an accurate portrayal of life in 10,000 BC from the start. Obviously it is not historical. But many viewers, especially the young, will not know that. Haven't we had enough films that distort history? Is not this film just another version of One Million BC which shows humans living side-by-side with dinosaurs?

Even a fantasy must adhere to basic rules of logic. The film violates many rules of the physical universe. It begins with garbled geography that would never occur in reality. Where on earth can one travel from snow-capped mountains, to jungle, to desert? I also laughed at the CGI spear throwing as well, so obvious fake. Even if we accept that this is a fantasy world, spears cannot be cast as shown in this film. It is a physical impossibility.

I could go one but what's the point. Save your money except if you are a student of bad film and need a lesson on how not to do it. I do have to hand it to Mr Emmerich though. He knows how to make a film that has audience appeal and makes loads of dough for his investors whether or not the film itself is good or bad.",1213833600,10,2652,4.580168776371308

3094323,4,B0012Q732O,"I like it.  Yes, the story is a weird mish-mash of almost everything conceivable but, it's a FANTASY, not history.  It's more like ""Eregon"" than Louis Leakey.

These are mammoth dependent people, similar to the mammoth-societies of the Siberian steppe.  Yes, their mammoths and sabre-tooth are too big.  The sabre-tooth stuff is drawn, whole-cloth, from ""Androcles and the Lion"" [shameless really].  Somehow these Siberians live right next to Africa and manage to ally with with tribes of primitive but noble black Africans.  They do this to liberate their people, including the blue-eyed woman, who has been captured by proto-historic Egyptian slave traders.

They pursue the slavers over Sahara-like sand dunes do discover the Egyptins building pyramids with slave and mammoth power.  It looks great and is a rip-off of the theory that the Egyptian monuments are far older than the vast majority of archaeologists think.  No matter.  It makes for great Hollywood.

Our small band of primitive hunter-gatherers manages to wreck the Egyptians and liberate their people as well as the long-suffering mammoths.

Yeah, I know it's crazy, ridiculous--much like Michael Moore films--but, as long as you know it's crazy-ridiculous, you can sit back and enjoy he fun.

Yes, they speak english, but not every movie has the budget of Apocalypto. Yes, they look the same as us, but again not every movie has a crazy budget. Some producers/directors are more into how they can make us relate to the characters.
In todays world it's easier to relate if they A: speak the same language and B: look similar. Those things draw more people in.

3094325,4,B0012Q732O,"Truthfully, the main complaint about this movie is the historical inaccuracy. While reviewers have valid points, I believe that this is more of a Fantasy film rather than a ""based on facts"" offering. (I would suggest people looking for accuracy check out Walking with Prehistoric Beasts""

What I liked about the film: There has been nothing like this in quite some time. Sure, we have had many Jurassic Park films with great looking dinosaurs, but I have always been interested in the mammals that came after. The creatures looked great! I loved the Saber-toothed Cat and the Mammoths running like buffalo was amazing. The Terror Birds were well done, also. I thought the acting was good and the line delivery was decent. Someone complained in another review about them talking in complete sentences, etc. I saw that as being immersed in the language of the day - in other words, this is what we understood. The story was fairly decent even though this was the least believable part. I think the writers were going for a pc theme, which was mostly okay.

What I didn't like (and this contains Spoilers) - Not enough creatures. I thought the Cat was going to be around more than 2 minutes to look after the hero, but no. I would have liked to have seen other mammals besides Cats and Mammoths (I'm not counting the horses). The thing that bothered me most was the evil Pharaoh/Leader with all of the slaves was just some old White guy. What is that about? Honestly. I expected an Alien or some type of creature or at least something a little more interesting. It made me wonder what they were trying to say. There were a few slow spots, but everything did seem to correlate to the story in the end.

Overall, it was a good movie. I would say it was a throwback to movies like Conan the Barbarian and Death stalker and even One Million BC. People that are looking for an educational aspect will be disappointed, although the creatures in the movie DID exist at the same time as humans (some reviewers are stating that they did not, this is not true. There were mammoths, terror birds, and saber-toothed cats up until around 10,000 years ago as well as other mammals such as Giant Ground Sloths, Dire Wolves, and Cave Bears). Again - Fantasy fare that is for the most part, well done, just don't expect a lot of creatures (which I was doing) as this is more of a Man vs. Man movie.",1213574400,3,2378,4.538461538461538

3094394,3,B0012Q732O,"A ridiculous but pleasantly entertaining prehistoric epic by the director of ""Independence Day"". Set in 10,000 BC, it starts showing a tribe sporting Rastafarian dreadlocks as they hunt down woolly mammoths. After one of the warriors called D'Leh kills one beast all by himself, he gains as a trophy the hand of Evolet, the beauty of the tribe (played by Camilla Belle, a Lindsay Lohan look alike). But before D'Leh can enjoys his prize, a group of slave raiders attacks the tribe during dawn, and takes Evolet as captive. D'Leh along with some other tribesmen decides to track the raiders in order to free Evolet. In alliance with other tribes, they pursue the slave traffickers down to their home, a civilization building pyramids and ruled by an androgynous ruler that seems inspired by Ancient Egypt. The movie is full of inaccuracies, both historical and geographical (to name just a few, there were no domesticated horses in 10,000 BC, much less pyramids; at the start of the movie, the action seems to be happening in Northern Eurasia, but our heroes find themselves soon in Africa) but that's not the point, but to enjoy a good popcorn movie.

3094395,2,B0012Q732O,"""10,000 BC"" is a Roland Emmerich film. Check out the list of his films - ""Independence Day"" ""Godzilla"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow"" - and you know you need quite a lot of suspension disbelief. But I enjoyed myself watching these films - CGI-created actions and set-pieces and all, and they are often silly, I admit (Will Smith punching the alien in the face?), but it was certainly fun.

Now I have seen his latest film ""10,000 BC"" and I find myself sadly disappointed. I don't think the film is as terrible as critics say. At least special effects are top-notch, like the stampede of mammoths or the roaring saber-tooth tiger, but I cannot help thinking something is missing here and despite its first-rate special effects the film is mostly boring.

Perhaps dull characters are to blame. Or maybe the generic story should be responsible. Actions are largely bland despite superb effects. The story follows Steven Strait's self-doubting hero D'Leh whose blue-eyed sweetheart Evolet (Camilla Belle) is kidnapped by the warriors invading his community. Supporting characters are mostly forgettable ciphers and you cannot tell one from another.

But I was willing to forget the weakness of the film's story, which is linear and predictable; I didn't care the actors' accents (or the fact that they speak English). I don't need ""historical accuracies."" But I need something engaging or exciting and that is what I got in ""Apocalypto"" (there is a similarity between these films). Unfortunately, you don't get it in ""10,000 BC."" Instead, it borrows from other films, bits from this, bits from that, but gives no original idea, no imagination. The locations such as ice-capped mountains or hot deserts are all beautiful to see, but the problem is, they all look today's New Zealand and Namibia.

I know I shouldn't expect the intensity of the Mel Gibson film, but Roland Emmerich could have done something unique or original to entertain us. Some say, probably rightly, that this is homage to Burroughs-like old-fashioned action adventures. I know, but they have more imagination and original vision, or the will and power to invite us into their fictional worlds, which ""10,000 BC sorely lacks.",1209686400,,2189,5.038674033149171

3094434,3,B0012Q732O,"I have to admit that I enjoyed ""The Day After Tomorrow"" enough to want to go and see the next movie these developers put out.  Here we have ""10,000 B.C."", clearly a fantasy epic.  The historical concepts might be the one thing that holds a few people from getting really into the film, so I warn you now, this film is not all that historically accurate.  The movie is made to enjoy the adventure and that is all, so enjoy it!  I'll go over some of the historical discrepancies later.

I think this movie was funded to speak to the movie going fans that would see films such as ""Apocalypto"" which was a pretty good success.  Not to mention epics in general have been doing fairly well these recent years.  However, I like the way ""10,000 B.C."" handled the language barrier problems.  In ""Apocalypto"" we basically had to read most of the movie in subtitles because no one spoke that language.  In ""10,000 B.C."" the main characters all speak English, which obviously isn't what they spoke back then.  However, when they come upon another people the other people speak a different language and we have sub titles.  However, you'll notice that when people from the different areas speak to each other they start in a different language then switch to English.  It appears that the developers didn't want the audience reading the film, so rather than make this minutely accurate they took some artistic license and dealt with the problem that way.  An interesting idea and I think it would work for most moviegoers.

Basically we're brought into a very primitive world, I hesitate to call the people ""cave men"" like everyone else because they clearly built their own shelters and they don't appear to be nomadic either.  Their culture seems more akin to the Native American's in North America, and we don't call them cave men because they constructed teepees.  The movie delves into topics of prophecy, love, and unity.  I think that's kind of the overall concept behind the film.  Basically you're dealing with people that explain things in very mystical terms.  For example, they have a wise woman, who is also a mystic.  Similar to what you find in Native American culture or even in Old Norse cultures and in many others.  So this isn't a new concept.  Anyway, the people in the tribe we're looking at come across a little girl with blue eyes, Evolet.  The old mother says that her people were destroyed by four legged demons (men on horses).  Anyway, in order to become leader of this tribe you need to slay a mastodon.  So the person who kills the mammoth gets to marry the girl.  As is typical of these kinds of films, she and another boy, D'Leh (Steven Straight) had already fallen in love by the time this happens.  So naturally this boy needs to kill the mammoth if he wants to marry her.

Regardless of background story and I don't want to give too much away, the point is they were in love.  The four legged demons that took her family and destroyed her tribe eventually come to this tribe and enslave the people, including the blue eyed girl.  So now the chase is on and a group leaves with D'Leh to go after these people that would steal theirs.  What the tribes were a victim of was the expansion of the Egyptian empire.  That much was clearly obvious when we see the three pyramids in Giza.  The Great Pyramid is currently being constructed and the golden top is already in place!  ""10,000 B.C."" really combines reality and fantasy during this period, but it is loosely plausible they would enslave people that far north.  I don't think it's entirely realistic because there were possibly other nations in between.  It ends up turning into a story that requires people to unite and save more than just the girl.  In their travels they meet other peoples who also had been terrorized by the Egyptian empire and they gather a great many people to storm Egypt.  Along the way D'Leh finds out he is beginning to fulfill this ancient prophecy that would lead to the people's freedom.  Typical, I know.  I personally hated the end of this movie because it became horribly clich to give one last feeling of ""tragedy"" so it can end on some ultra-high note of love as anyone watching this film could easily predict.  Personally, I would've just ended it about ten minutes earlier, and done away with the unnecessary annoyance of appealing to an overly clich fan base.

I only name Steven Straight above because he's really the only person I've seen in another movie that I recognized.  He was in that movie ""Covenant"" that was clearly geared towards the same crowed that enjoyed ""The Craft"", only it was geared more towards girls to watch.  Either way, I most commend him on doing this film.  Steven did a superior job in this film than he did in such a silly movie as ""Covenant.""  In fact I didn't even recognize him as the same character until I went and looked him up, that usually means an actor is good at playing a diverse amount of roles.  Let's hope this wasn't a one shot, because it definitely doesn't look like he's falling into being type-casted as the pretty boy role to be a female heart throb.

It's clearly a fantasy film for anyone who knows any kind of rudimentary history. Is it possible that mankind and saber tooth tigers and mastodons existed in conjunctions, most certainly?  But did all this take place in 10,000 B.C.  That's loose at best.  While it's pretty well founded that mankind would have hunted the mastodons, the way the dates time out it seems these animals would have been nearly extinct around this time frame.  It's taking place at the end of the Pleistocene era and this is during the end of an ice age so the climate is changing drastically.  As my first proof of fantasy I submit the trek to the south.  The tribes are in the snowy mountains and then all of a sudden they walk into very thick jungle.  I'm serious, snow ends and jungle begins.  The jungle is so thick that the blades of grass are taller than the people.  Normally changes like this don't happen instantaneously like that and the characters even complain that it is hot, yet there is snow a whopping two feet away from them. Usually climate shifts will taper off gradually and the only time you find drastic shifts is in the desert when all of a sudden a flood takes place and water is available to turn the desert into a lush area (and this happens today).  Regardless, even when that happens the grass isn't taller than a man or nearly as thick here.  Anyway, when they're traveling through this lush jungle they are attacked by these giant birds, which I seriously tried to go and look up because it looked like they were using real creatures to add an air of realism.  The closest I found was Phorusrhacos, which seems to be in the right period and existed in the Pleistocene era.  They are described as being ostrich like and predatory... that meets my requirement.  I must say, I do like the fact that these real creatures were being readily used in the film!  The only other creature that they come upon is the Saber Tooth tiger, which also falls into the correct time frame for this era.  I was disappointed that there was actually only one and it didn't kill anything.

Now I should point out that the animals are all clearly computer generated.  If anyone remembers the wolves from ""The Day After Tomorrow"" you'll remember how fake and foolish those looked.  Frankly, these don't look all that much better.  It looks like they upgraded their rendering image because these animals look a bit more realistic, but they are still very obviously out of place against the strikingly realistic scenery!  Again, if anyone remembers ""The Day After Tomorrow"" it was the landscape scenes that were the most impressive; the same is true for ""10,000 B.C.""  The saving grace in ""The Day After Tomorrow"" was that the wolves were barely even in the movie; unfortunately in ""10,000 B.C."" the presence of animal is far more integral to the movie.  So that definitely worked against the film for my ability to enjoy it.

Okay, so everything seems somewhat up to par for being historically reasonable.  Then the Egyptian empire is brought into the fold.  This is where fantasy became overly obvious.  First off the Great Pyramid was still under construction and historically that's the oldest pyramid out of the three in Giza (it's not the oldest in existence!)... the other two smaller pyramids are already fully constructed next to it.  I think a lot of this theory comes into play with a psychic named Edgar Cayce who ""channeled"" an ancient spirit who told him the pyramids were constructed after the fall of Atlantis from the remnants of that civilization.  I've read a book based around Cayce's Atlantis concept and if I remember it correctly he has it dated around 100,000 years old.  That date is pretty unequivocally unrealistic if you ask me.  There's no evidence of a super civilization existing that long ago that would have influenced the major religions.  If Cayce had proffered a date like 10,000 B.C. for Atlantis, maybe that would make more logical sense, either way, no one has found Atlantis in the form he spoke of yet.  The closest we have to Plato's Atlantis is that he was possibly talking about the Minoans.  Okay tangent done, most historians date the Great Pyramid to be built by Khufu (or Cheops), with construction ending around 2,560 B.C.  This is drastically different from the 10,000 B.C. date that Cayce ""channeled"".  So the Cayce Foundation funded some expedition to date elements from the Great Pyramid, such as wood used in the construction, to find out how old the pyramid was.  This dating came up with a range of 3,090-2,723 B.C. (plus or minus 100 to 400 years).  This was in the lower rim and even in the higher range of 3,809B.C. (plus or minus 160 years) we can see it's nowhere near the date of 10,000 B.C. that Cayce got from his spirit contact.  Either Cayce is wrong or Radiocarbon dating is wrong.  I'll stick with Radiocarbon for now.  Either way that doesn't change the fact that this pyramid was built first in that particular strip.

Furthermore during this construction it shows the Egyptians using Mastodon's as work animals to haul the stone.  This may make sense for a 10,000 B.C. time frame, but doesn't for a realistic construction time frame since they would have been extinct by then.  Actually, in terms of climate I would say it doesn't even fit the 10,000 B.C. time frame because a Mastodon was more of an artic animal and not really suited for desert survival.  However, I will admit the use of the mastodon was fairly integral to the story-line so I can see why it was used in the Egyptian scenes.  Egypt appears to have a full branching society at this point, but realistically Sumer would have pre-dated Egypt's rise to power, so we'd have to push all the dates for Sumer back to earlier times if Egypt was doing this in 10,000 B.C.  Naturally I don't think anyone will look at this as being remotely historically accurate, especially given the size of the Egyptian civilization at the time frame this movie is presenting.

In another part of the movie it does give a very Stargate styled explanation for all this knowledge.  The movie alludes to the fact that there were once three pharaohs and the one building the great pyramid is the last one alive.  You don't ever really see the pharaoh's face, but you do see him standing next to people and he is far taller than anyone else, practically a giant!  In a discussion between characters it is mentioned that some say they came from the stars, presenting the space alien theory.

In the end I thought it was a decent adventure to go on.  I don't regret seeing it, but you really need to take the movie for what it is.  It's an attempt at making an adventure epic that was clearly influenced by something like ""Apocalypto.""  Frankly ""Apocalypto"" was a better movie and I would surely recommend it over this.  I also think that ""The Day After Tomorrow"" was a little better than what was made here, but I think it's great to get people's interest sparked in the ancient world.  Granted some people will surely be foolish enough to believe this film is accurate, but you'll get that with anyone.  I've even read a book where the author truly believed that it was Satan that built the pyramids in Giza to make a mock Heaven, because pyramids were originally in Heaven (and presumably still are).  Seriously, people will believe anything you throw at them.",1206316800,2,12465,4.633090246125797
3094435,2,B0012Q732O,"About the best thing that can be said for ""10,000 B.C."" is that it at least doesn't have the human characters sharing screen time with a bunch of rampaging dinosaurs (which puts it light years ahead of ""One Million Years B.C."" in terms of historical realism, though that's not exactly a very high bar for any film to get over). But that's about the only anachronism that doesn't find its way into this film, which seems otherwise designed to give any serious anthropologist or historian a severe case of the professional heebie-jeebies. For here is a movie in which people live in thatch-roofed villages, travel on elaborately designed wooden sailboats, and worship at massive pyramids and temples, thousands of years before any of those things actually existed. Of course, one doesn't expect to find the stark documentary realism of a ""Quest For Fire"" in any project by Roland Emmerich - the purveyor of such high class pop culture schlock as ""Independence Day,"" ""Godzilla,"" ""The Day After Tomorrow,"" etc. - but couldn't somebody have done at least a modicum of historical research before sending this out to a public as woefully uninformed about ancient history as polls seem to indicate this one is?

""10,000 B.C."" actually starts off promisingly, with a fairly exciting chase scene involving a bunch of underdressed homo sapiens pursuing a herd of overdressed woolly mammoths. Then, regrettably, the plot itself takes over, the umpteenth version of that oldie about the evildoers who come from over the mountains to ransack the peace-loving tribe's village and make off with some of their members. It is then up to the hunkiest guy in the group to mount a rescue attempt, braving threats both manmade and natural on the way to his goal.

Because we have so little to engage our interest either intellectually or emotionally, our minds are free to ponder some of the truly profound questions of the ages such as how such primitive people, living out in the harshest elements imaginable, still manage to have their eyebrows neatly tweezed and their hands softly manicured at all times.

There's not much point in discussing the dialogue or the acting - both largely irrelevant in a film of this type anyway - but it should be pointed out that while the mammoths are really quite impressive in their movements and appearance, the giant dodo birds and saber-toothed tigers with which our heroes also have to contend feel much more like the CGI effects that they clearly are.

Who knows, but ""10,000 B.C."" may one day achieve the status of a camp classic - yet, the way I see it, there's nothing quite like a scantily-clad Raquel Welch being chased by an angry Tyrannosaurus Rex to up a movie's chances at achieving cinematic immortality.",1206230400,,2737,4.9049676025917925
3094436,5,B0012Q732O,"No doubt about it, I'm a contrarian, and that pattern holds concerning this fictional kids' film.

I know that history is askew in this film, yet there are so many pieces that work. Within this fiction, the characterizations, portrayals of prehistoric animals (mammoths, saber-toothed tigers and birds) and cinematography are all dazzling.

More importantly, the tale carries several wonderful messages that kids appreciate---the need to protect one's own people as well as others, the need to preserve and restore human rights, and the need to work with others, despite seeming differences. The saga also includes a romance, and legend.

And all this comes (as one other reviewer noted) without blood and guts. I wouldn't say the film portrays the world ""before the White Man came and ruined everything.""

True enough, the chronology is way off kilter---as the ancient Egyptians reigned long after 10000 B.C. And they undoubtedly did not harness mastodons while building the pyramids. But never mind that.

The ancient Egyptians did treat their slaves cruelly.

3094480,1,B0012Q732O,"A number of years ago, I read a piece of film criticism written by Roger Ebert. The Pulitzer Prize winning movie critic wrote a review of ""Caveman"", a film starring Ringo Starr and Barbara Bach - the filmmakers provided a press kit for the screening listing the words used within the film, the caveman's vocabulary, and the meaning of these words - Ebert used these words to describe how bad ""Caveman"" was and it was quite a memorable movie review. I only wish ""10,000 B.C."" was as inventive. Actually, it is inventive in one regard; the depiction of history within the film is laughably inventive.

""10,000 B.C"" begins even a few years earlier when a small tribe of cavemen takes in a strange orphan girl with blue eyes. The Old Mother (Mona Hammond) predicts this girl, whom they name Evolet, must become a part of the tribe, and she and D'Leh, a young boy whose father mysteriously leaves the tribe, become friends. Flash forward to 10,000 B.C. and the last Mammoth hunt is here. Now, D'Leh (Steven Strait) and Evolet (Camilla Belle) are attracted to one another. But Tic Tic (Cliff Curtis), D'Leh's defacto father figure claims the warrior who kills a mammoth wins the white spear and Evolet. Well, D'Leh is gonna do both, I tell you what. D'Leh manages to kill the only mammoth and claims his prize. Later that evening, the four-legged beasts (horses to you and I) carry another tribe invading the tribe and they carry Evolet and a number of other women off. D'Leh and Tic Tic set-off to find her and bring her back. They set out leaving Baku (Nathaniel Baring) behind, but the precocious young kid trails behind and soon joins them. Their trek takes them across Africa, where they meet other tribes who have fallen victim to the same marauders and want to help. They join forces with D'Leh. Eventually, they arrive in Egypt and find a number of slaves and wooly mammoths helping to build the pyramids. And Evolet is being held captive. How can they free Evolet and all of their other tribesmen who have become slaves?

Co-written and directed by Roland Emmerich (""Independence Day"" - one of the best summer movies ever, ""The Day After Tomorrow""), the film has a grand scale and does a pretty good job of recreating some icons of the caveman era, but pretty bad acting and playing fast and loose with what little we actually know of this period help to ruin the film.

We have all seen this type of film before; the director and rest of the production team are so intent on recreating a specific time or place, using all of their skills and tricks to recreate the icons of this era, that they have no time left for the actors. Time or money. The film is filled with actors we have never seen before and they are adequate for the purpose and are certainly no better or no worse than the material they are appearing in. Steven Strait plays D'Leh, the lead. He is handsome, even under the gunk and dirt painted on his body to help him portray the caveman he is supposed to be. I have never seen him in anything before, probably from television or soap operas, and his performance is unremarkable and serviceable to the CGI creatures and effects. Camilla Belle plays Evolet, the love interest and again, she is serviceable to the special effects and unremarkable. This isn't a film you go to expecting to watch the next great Academy Award winning performance. All of the money, time and attention went into recreating wooly mammoths, saber tooth tigers and the ancient pyramids.

The film begins with narration by Omar Sharif. He talks about the tribe, the Old Mother, how D'Leh and Evolet met. Throughout the film, he tells us what particular characters are thinking, and experiencing. It is an interesting idea and his voice is fun to listen to. But because he is telling us about people's feelings and motivations, and we aren't seeing this in their performance, it makes the actors seem even more awkward and wooden. Not a good thing for these young actors.

During the course of the film, D'Leh and Nakudu come across other tribes during their journey to rescue Evolet. D'Leh's tribe speaks English, but no one else does. This just makes no sense. Of course, they aren't really speaking ""English"", but their tribe's language is translated for us and that is what we hear. Every time they come into contact with some other tribe of people, they are speaking a tongue that requires subtitles for us to understand. Worse, when D'Leh and his warriors come into contact with an African tribe, one of their members can speak the same language and communicate with them. But of course, the rest can't. This makes is especially easy for them to become allies and move through Africa enlisting the aid of other troops. It would've been easier for the filmmakers to simply create a language, as the people who made ""Caveman"" did. It makes about as much sense.

Worse, when the people are speaking English, they use strange, affected accents making their dialogue sound like a badly dubbed Italian gladiator film. Even more unnerving, the tribe of marauders who invade D'Leh's camp and take Evolet speak in some strange tongue, which also sounds as though they might be aliens; their voices sound like they are given the same treatment James Earl Jones voice was given when he voiced Darth Vader.

The key obstacle for films recreating periods of time from long ago, times we have little or spotty knowledge of is to make these worlds seem real. Because Emmerich does little to maintain what we actually do know about the timeline of this period, or to make the geography seem real, the film seems completely phony. There just isn't enough in the film to help us believe we are watching a real moment in this history.

So, let's talk a little about the ""history"" of this film. Cavemen make a trek from their home camp, which is located in a mountain range somewhere, complete with snow and cold temperatures. Their journey takes them into Africa, where they meet many other tribes, and they all band together to rescue the people kidnapped from their tribes and taken to Egypt to help build the pyramids. Okay, so where are these cavemen coming from? Snowy mountains, then trekking through Africa to Egypt? Did they make a u-turn somewhere? Yeah, that's it. They even journey through what looks like a rainforest at one point. Must be one of those fabled rainforests that have completely dried up in the intervening 12000 plus years. Yeah, that's it.

But then, the cavemen eventually make it to Egypt where the evil king - priest - priestess - eunuch (not sure) is using the slaves to build the pyramids. Uh huh. Sorry, but even my limited knowledge of history is enough to tell me this never happened. Never could have happened. Yes, I know it is a film, and it isn't trying to be a history lesson.

But when a filmmaker makes a film like this, intended for a mass audience, primarily aimed at teens, playing this fast and loose with history, seems, at best, problematic. I know that for every group of teenage boys who goes to this film, at least one of them will end up thinking some caveman was able to travel to Egypt and at least temporarily delay the building of the pyramids. Then, maybe this same teenager will one day believe the ramblings of someone else who believed the Romans never had slaves and will one day grow up to believe the Holocaust never happened.

Okay, that is a stretch. ""10,000 B.C."" isn't good enough to be that powerful.

3094482,3,B0012Q732O,"10,000 BC is one of those films that is not meant to be taken seriously by dedicated students of history or paleontology.  It is to these two disciplines that Raquel Welch was to ONE MILLION BC.  Director Roland Emmerich eschewed accuracy for entertainment and the result is an action-packed film that delivers the dramatic goods.  Some critics have further complained of what they saw as gratuitous violence, but for a film that deals with a brutal age, the violence is far more  subdued than gorishly up front.

The plot is simple enough.  Some bad guy cavemen on horseback attack a peaceful tribe and carry off some tribespeople, one of whom is the mate of the hero.  The bulk of the action consists of his attempts to free them.  What makes this film a crowd pleaser is the convincing special effects that dominate.  There are several scenes of marauding wooley mammoths that have to be seen to be believed.  As long as Emmerich keeps audience focus of the logistics of mammoth killing, he is on firm historical ground. The background scenery is glacial western Europe, and one can sense that this was pretty much the way it was.  The tribes people speak impeccable English and we can see that they have a rich tapestry of religion and culture.  After the kidnapping of the hero's mate, Emmerich distorts geological fact in a way that surprisingly enough does not intrude on viewer interest.  Within the latter part of the film, he has the hero trek across a bewildering variety of landscape that ranges from glacial cold to tropical jungle to desert sands.  But because we are so involved in the hero's quest we wink at even scenes of pre-dynastic Egyptian pyramid building and hints of a connection between the deluge of lost Atlantis and the earliest of the Pharoahs.  What emerges by the end is the realization that viewer interest is once again maintained by characters with whom we can identify.  All the other eye candy of computer graphics takes a back seat.  In 10,000 BC, Roland Emmerich found this hard to achieve balance.",1205625600,,2037,4.7578347578347575

I did like to velociraptor-like giant chickens / dodoes / whatever - very large man-eating birds are scary AND cool!

The non-specific geographic location and lack of time orientation were disappointing, though.  Another reviewer remarked that they weren't sure if it took days, weeks, months, or years.  From what I could tell, the whole story only took, like, four or five days!  That's a lot of hiking, man!

3094484,2,B0012Q732O,"10,000 B.C. is a sprawling, messy, jaw-dropping, silly, enjoyable bit of forgettable fun.  It's the most disposable epic movie I've ever seen.  Roland Emmerich, who has brought us fluffy epic fun before with INDEPENDENCE DAY and DAY AFTER TOMORROW, certainly has a grasp on how to bring moments to film that will stick with the viewer.  Long after forgetting the details of these former blockbusters, I still remember the image of the White House being blasted to bits or Manhattan encrusted in ice.  With this latest effort, I suppose I might remember the stampeding wooly mammoths.  Or I might not.  It's been 5 days since I saw the movie, and I can barely remember half of what happened.

It tells the story of a tribe of early humans who survive by hunting mammoths.  They live in the foothills of a giant mountain range, and are pretty isolated from the rest of the world.  But when another tribe invades and snags many of their best hunters, presumably to enslave them...our intrepid hero and his older mentor head off into unknown lands to save their fellow tribesmen.  Naturally, one of the prisoners is also the love interest for our hero.

As this little band of travelers moves, they go from the blistering cold of the high mountains to the grassy lowlands where they meet a friendly tribe who join them on their quest.  What began as a tiny group determined to win the freedom of some friends turns into a guerilla army comprised of members of several tribes...all eager to free their comrades and bring down an empire that is enslaving all these folks in order to build what looks suspiciously like the Egyptian pyramids...thousands of years before they were really built, of course.

It became almost laughable to see the climactic changes these men went through.  As I said, from foothills to snowcapped mountains, to savannahs, to grasslands, to marshy country to a Saharan desert to a fertile river valley.  We get no sense of how long they have traveled.  Heck, it might have been a journey of two years or two weeks for all we can tell.  And each climate has its own distinctive group of indigenous peoples...so we end up with a truly multi-racial and multi-cultural army.  But instead of sending a message about unity...I was mostly perplexed in trying to figure out just where in the world this story was taking place.  Probably Africa...but some of the geography felt more like the Andes mountains of South America.  So it all ended up feeling very generic.

There were a few impressive scenes.  Early on, we see a mammoth hunt, and the scenes of grazing mammoths, turned into stampeding mammoths was well done.  The CGI effects were credible and for about 2 minutes, you can really believe you're getting a sense of how our early ancestors behaved.  (Later CGI of a saber tooth tiger is NOT very believable at all...I have yet to see a large cat done convincingly via CG...just think of Aslan in NARNIA).  Towards the end, the scenes at the city where thousands of slaves and hundreds of mammoths are toiling to build a series of pyramids is nothing short of impressive.  Again, the CG is first-rate, and briefly a sense of awe IS inspired.  I emphasize the word ""briefly.""  Most of the movie is incredibly generic questing stuff, done far better in many movies that have come before...mostly notably in Mel Gibson's brilliant and very exciting APOCALYPTO.

The generic feel is not much helped by the average performances.  The only truly recognizable face is that of Camilla Belle (BALLAD OF JACK & ROSE), who plays the love interest.  She is striking to look at and absolutely, 100% boring.  Everyone else is bland.  An Omar Sharif provides grating narration in a voice that is so filled with silkiness and wonder that it bordered on camp.

I had a decent time watching this film, but I doubt if it will recoup its budget.  I sensed no true enthusiasm for it from the audience I sat with.  Yes, we all came to see the big epic in a very dutiful manner...sheep trained to attend all things where a giant wide-screen is advised.  But we also filed out in a dutiful manner, and no voices were overheard saying, ""that was fun.""

And I could spend all day picking this film apart - BUT IT""S A FANTASY STORY! HELLO! Remember: FANTASY! That's what I paid my money for!  Not a documentary or historical fiction, but a FANTASTIC, DREAM-LIKE story.

Nor do you have to be a genius to figure this out!

The movie works on many levels. First, as an adventure story, a saga, like Lord of the Rings. I felt swept away. It's also an enjoyable love story. The  chemistry between the actors is excellent. I cared about the characters. In addition to being erotic! - Its been a long time since I've seen so many good looking men and women on the Big Screen all at one time!

Very little of the violence is graphic or gratuitous. You can tell a fantastic story without blood and guts flying everywhere. It's also a movie suitable for older children.

Tribal people and people of color are shown with respect. Their rich variety of  physical features, skin colors, dress, languages and architecture are shown in all its glory. Before the White Man came, and ruined everything, there was mind boggling cultural diversity on this planet!

What is most striking to me is the very moving and insightful portrayal of a Medicine Women performing profound acts of shamanism in order to help protect her people as best as she can. This is the very first time I seen such a pivotal role for tribal spiritual beliefs in a big Hollywood fantasy film! My hats off to the whomever wrote the screenplay! You did your homework!

Granted the ending did bother me a bit. It begs the question: Did the ancient Egyptians actually treat their workers that poorly?  If only the Egyptians didn't use slaves, and treated their workers well. And what a metaphor for the year 2008, where most workers in the world are treated like dirt and instead of whips, the fear of dire poverty is used to keep most of the world's workers in line.

But I digress, this is a great movie. At the end a tear rolled down my cheek,  and I felt good when I left the theater. That's all I can ask of a  story.  My money was well spent, for a change!

3094488,4,B0012Q732O,"I LOVE primeval or primitive-type films like ""One Million Years B.C.,"" ""Conan the Barbarian,"" ""Planet of the Apes,"" ""Beneath TPOTA,"" ""Sands of the Kalahari"" and Tarzan, which of course explains my interest in seeing Roland Emmerich's brand new ""10,000 B.C."" (even despite the mediocre reviews and the fact that I dislike other Emmerich films like ""Independence Day"" and ""Day After Tomorrow"").

What does one expect in seeing a film titled ""10,000 B.C""? ""Citizen Kane""? No, you would likely expect raw, primordial landscapes, mountains, deserts and jungles, 'cavemen' (and women), chisiled bods with zero fat, giant beasts of terror and ominous music. ""10,000 B.C."" has all this and, surprisingly, more.

THE PLOT: The mammoths are slowly disappearing in the mountainous regions where D'Leh's tribe dwells, but when a herd finally appears he proves his courage by slaying one of the mighty beasts. Suddenly slavers from the deserts raid D'Leh's ""village"" (more like a campsite) and make off with his beloved Evolet and numerous others. D'Leh and three more pursue them into the jungles and then the desert. Along the way, many different tribes and peoples join their cause to end the tyrannical slave raids. The journey and climax brings profound spiritual growth to D'Leh as his ""Circle of love"" expands to include far more than merely Evolet, blood relatives and fellow tribe members.

In a film like this I demand great locations and ""10,000 B.C"" delivers spectacularly! Seriously, the landscapes are so breathtaking that seeing 'em on the big screen is a must. The rugged mountainous scenes were filmed in New Zealand, the jungle scenes in South Africa and the desert segment in Namibia.

Many of the visuals are just magnificent, like the slave ships and their red butterfly sails. Needless to say, incredible cinematography.

Much of the F/X work is great, like the woolly mammoths, but the sabertooth tiger is a tad fake-looking, albeit serviceable. The entire mammoth hunt segment is incredible filmmaking and truly thrilling.

D'Leh and his associates are all likable while the slavers & pyramid people are all fittingly loathesome. Great casting.

D'Leh is played by Steven Strait and Evolet by Camilla Belle. You'll note that Camilla has one of the most beautiful faces you'll ever happen to see, especially in the close-ups near the end.

Some have criticized that D'Leh's tribe speaks English (while other tribes speak different languages). Aduh, the filmmakers are hoping that viewers have a brain and can figure out that they aren't really speaking English (modern English didn't exist for another 9,750 years or so); D'Leh's tribe are obviously speaking some caveman lingo like every other tribe, but the filmmakers have translated their language for our convenience so we don't have to read subtitles the entire film.

Contrary to what some say ""10,000 B.C."" is not a remake of 1966's ""One Million Years B.C."" (the one with Raquel Welch and her infamous animal-skin bikini). The basic plot is the same as Mel Gibson's ""Apocalypto"" but there's enough differences to make ""10,000 B.C."" worthwhile if you've seen the Gibson film. In fact, even though ""10,000 B.C."" is a bit more cartooney than ""Apocalypto"" you get more bang for your buck. ""Apocalypto"" may have more action but ""10,000 B.C."" has a better variety of locations and breathtaking landscapes. Not to mention ""Apocalypto's"" message is simple: Civilization bad, rural tribes good, invaders from across the sea evil incarnate. (That last part's a joke, sort of).

By contrast, ""10,000 B.C."" surprisingly has a spiritual depth that transcends the usual action/adventure fare. Love is a strong theme here. There's a scene near the beginning of the film where D'Leh (still a kid) grabs Evolet's hand and declares his undying love for her. Unrealistic? Not really. Kids back then would naturally be more developed at an earlier age due to the fact that they weren't spoiled or distracted from spiritual growth by absent parents, materialism, video games, Britney Spears, MTV and the internet (or whatever). Anyway, D'Leh's love for Evolet later propels him to take the long journey to rescue her and the other tribe members. During this journey his ""circle of love"" grows well beyond just Evolet, blood relatives and fellow tribemen to encompass many peoples of varying races and even a sabertooth tiger (!) (think Marvel's Ka-Zar, Lord of the Hidden Jungle). I wasn't expecting this.

That's right, the film even adresses love and respect for animals. For instance, D'Leh has the opportunity to slay a ferocious beast but instead decides to save it despite the possiblity of being devoured or mauled. Also, his tribe regularly kills the mighty mammoths for necessities but they clearly respect the beast. Later in the film they are shocked to see the ""civilized"" pyramid people abuse the great animals.

In ""10,000 B.C."" love is like a warm life-giving ray of sun in a cold, rugged world. This is very different to the subtext of ""One Million Years B.C."" which blatantly states (in the narration) that the world is a hard and unfriendly place. Generally speaking, the message of ""One Million Years B.C."" is that life in this world is hard, hateful and meaningless, whereas the moral of ""10,000 B.C."" is that life is indeed hard, but it doesn't have to be hateful, hopeless or meaningless, and love indeed conquers all (that is, if peoople are open to it).

Some have criticized the many mystical elements in the story but, despite what Spock-like intellectuals would have you believe, life extends far beyond the limited parameters of science and reason. How do we explain the numerous mysteries of life and the universe? How do we explain the amazing prophecy the Aztecs had concerning Cortes and his arrival? A few years ago a prophet who didn't know me from adam called me up (from my seat) and spoke over me for a few minutes. He miraculously knew things and ""predicted"" others that he couldn't possibly have known apart from a powerful spiritual gift. People who view life exclusively from the narrow scope of reason and science are proud fools. Enough said.

""10,000 B.C"" is reminiscent of a few other films aside from ""Apocalypto."" The slave raider's attack on the village strongly brings to mind ""Conan the Barbarian"" (in fact, the entire film has a strong Conan vibe) while the giant birds in the jungle recall the raptors of ""Jurassic Park."" You'll also see glimpses of ""Last of the Mohicans"" here and there.

If you're a fan of these pictures and primeval/primitive-style films in general ""10,000 B.C."" is a must. Don't listen to the overly critical reviewers. No, it's not a perfect film -- the final Act falters, losing the captivating appeal of the first two Acts -- and, yes, there's a bit of cartoonishness, but ""10,000 B.C."" surprisingly exceeds the superficiality of most action/adventure flicks with a profound subtext.",1205107200,12,6907,5.067781690140845

I think, however, the preview is a bit misleading and I will wager that a lot of men are gonna be complaining after seeing this movie, which disquised itself as an action film, and is in truth at its core, a love story.

  The story follows D'leh (played by actor Steven Strait) a young man who lives in a snowy village of hunters.  The villagers have been slowly loosing their food supply (wooly mammoths) and the leader of the people, a woman called Old Mother, prophesies the rise of a leader during the last hunt of her people.  She makes this prophesy after a small group of hunters bring to the village a young girl with piercing blue eyes, called Evolet, who was abandoned after her people were killed by four legged demons (men on horses).  Over time, D'leh and Evolet fall in love and part of the prophesy is that the man who rises up to lead their people will also take Evolet as his wife.

  After the men on horses arrive and take many of the villagers, including Evolet, D'leh and his mentor, Tic Tic, follow the captors and their new slaves in hopes of freeing their family and friends.  Along the way, they come across other tribes who have also been attacked and enslaved by the mauraders and whose remaining members will join the fight if their own prophesy of a warrior to lead them comes true (which, does indeed with D'leh).  The rest of the story is these men trying to find a way to retrieve the slaves from the huge city occupied by the mysterious men who enslave the tribesmen and villagers to build their expanding empire.  And, for D'leh, to free the girl with whom he bonded years ago and swore his love.

  The whole time I was watching this film I was struck at how similar the plot is to Mel Gibson's ""Apocalypto"", which is a much better film.  That said, I don't think its as horrible as some reviewers are posting but its not the action-packed, prehistoric war epic I think many fan boys were hoping for.  The saber tooth tiger, which looked so awesome and fearful in the teaser, basically had a cameo but the scenes with the mammoths were impressive and great to watch.  Steven Strait, the lead actor is a handsome, charming guy who may have a career ahead of him.  I think he has possiblity, if given time to work on his acting.  The rest of the cast did fairly well in their roles but its more of a popcorn summer film that relies heavily on action sequences and special effects.

However the saber-toothed tiger look obviously fake. The ending scenes where the pyramid was being built are one of the most spectacular I ever seen. It looks huge, lively and beautiful.

The plot is an exact copy of Apocalypto. Yet this film does not have the suspense and intensity of Apocalypto. The acting is not convincing either.

3327944,2,B0012Q732O,"I deliberately chose to watch this movie on a languid afternoon because I expected it not to be intellectually challenging and it happened to be true.  To a certain extent, it felt like Acapalypto but it didn't have the intensity.  It felt like an epic National Geographic's special on an IMAX screen.  The tour started in New Zealand and the Maori actors, actresses and the Central Otago scenery betrayed the location.  The special effect was less than perfect and in many scenes, we could detect that the performance was acted in front of a green or blue screen.  As the main character chased after his girl to a warmer climate, that's when we shifted the focal point to Africa and ended up in Egypt.  The greatest flaw of the movie was having the characters speaking English as if it's already been established as the lingua franca of its time.  Then, there were scenes of sabre tooth, mammoths, giant vultures and doldos which didn't seem to fit in with geography of places that they went to.  The soundtrack was a bit syrupy for my liking and just imagine if Hans Zimmer was used instead, it would have increased the impact quite significantly.  The script wasn't tight at all and the dialogues were corny at best.  Cliff Curtis, arguably the veteran among the youngsters here added a bit of grunt and screen presence.  Otherwise, the rest were simply bubble-ish and forgettable at best.  There were instances we were reminded that we were back in Jurassic Park, Godzilla or even King Kong with the stampede scene.  I think Roland has the same problem that George Lucas might have during filming of Star Wars where technology ruled supreme whilst character development was relegated to second priority.  Amid the tight structure that's imposed into this movie, there's no much margin the crew could really work on.  As a result, the overall performance became rather trite and wooden.  It really could have been better.  Alas, another hit and miss.  The best way to enjoy this movie is not to have any expectation at all prior to watching the movie.  By the way, Omar Sharif's narration was overcooked too!",1204934400,2,2111,4.781767955801105
3327945,4,B0012Q732O,"I don't think anything about Roland Emmerich's ""10,000 B.C."" is accurate, historically, geographically, or culturally. But who cares? I see these movies to be entertained, not to be enlightened. Indeed, this is Emmerich's most entertaining film since ""Independence Day,"" to say absolutely nothing of ""Godzilla,"" ""The Patriot,"" or ""The Day After Tomorrow."" This isn't to say that it's a masterpiece or even that it's great. In all likelihood, it will be completely forgotten ten years from now. But as long as we do know about it, we might as well make the most of what it has to offer; ""10,000 B.C."" is a mindless adventure epic that achieves exactly what it wants to achieve without laboring over complicated details. The special effects and the action effectively serve as padding for a story so paper-thin and routine that it goes well beyond an archetypal clich.

How could I possibly recommend a film like that? That's easy: I knew ahead of time to not expect cinematic genius. If you hope to get anything out of it, I recommend you do the same thing. Not that there's much to get out of it, anyway. The story is about as simple as they get, boiling down to a hero on a journey to save the woman he loves. Taking place in the distant past (and you'll forgive me if I don't take the film's title seriously), it begins when a young girl is brought to live among the people of a mountain tribe. As the sole survivor of massacre, she sets into motion a prophecy stated by the wise elder, called Old Mother (Mona Hammond)--a warrior will prove himself upon the return of the now-elusive mastodons, meaning that the girl will forever be his. But this will not happen for a long time, so naturally, years pass for the sake of the story. As adults, the girl--Evolet (Camilla Belle)--and the destined warrior--D'Leh (Steven Strait)--address each other kindly yet distantly, rubbing in the fact that he has yet to become what he was destined to be.

After slaying a mastodon in a long-winded hunting sequence, D'Leh is awarded with his tribe's special spear, a long stick topped with pointy animal bones. He feels unworthy, not only because the mastodon's death was more of a fluke, but also because of his past. His father abandoned the tribe years ago, leaving D'Leh feeling ashamed about his own existence. All that changes when a warring tribe attacks the village and kidnaps almost everyone, including Evolet; D'Leh and his surrogate father Tic'Tic (Cliff Curtis) are determined to save their people, even if it means traveling for weeks over steep mountains, through cold snows, through hot jungles, and across arid deserts. They face all four conditions on their journey, and that makes me wonder what region of the world this film takes place in, since (1) no such place exists in real life, and (2) they end up in Ancient Egypt. Never mind--I forgot that I'm not supposed to question this movie.

Evolet, meanwhile, is in the clutches of a tribe who make it its mission to gather slaves. A deep-voiced warlord (Affif Ben Badra) has taken a special liking to Evolet, especially since she has a rebellious streak (she's been dropping items on the ground for D'Leh to follow, like a trail of breadcrumbs). He tries to reassure her with calming words, no small task considering he speaks a foreign language she's not familiar with. By the time they reach Egypt, we begin to wonder whether or not we're supposed to hate him. It's quite possible he was meant to be somewhat of a sympathetic character, despite kidnapping Evolet and whipping her hands for being sneaky.

D'Leh and Tic'Tic eventually team up with a warrior tribe. This is for reasons other than a connection between the tribe and D'Leh's father; D'Leh is able to tame the heart of a saber-tooth tiger with no effort at all. Apparently, this tribe had prophesized the arrival of The One Who Speaks to the Spear-Tooth, and this is why they welcome him with open arms. D'Leh soon befriends Nakudu (Joel Virgil), the one member that conveniently speaks many languages; together, they convince a number of neighboring tribes to join forces. Thus the foundation is laid for the final major sequence, which sees D'Leh in Ancient Egypt fighting a group of slave-owners claiming to serve a living god.

I can describe the plot until I'm blue in the face, but to really understand how derivative and mindless this movie is, you will have to see it for yourself. ""10,000 B.C."" is like a summer-popcorn version of Mel Gibson's ""Apocalypto,"" with everything even remotely complex and meaningful stripped away for the sake of action and special effects. But again, who cares? If the ads haven't made it clear by now, this was never meant to be a compelling human drama, even with Omar Sharif's continuous narration. It's an escapist movie and nothing more. It's meant to be entertaining, and to hell with pesky details like originality, character development, and substance. Yes, it would be easy to tear this film apart, but since it's not trying to be anything more than what it is, maybe we should just leave it alone. At the very least, we were spared a sequel to ""Godzilla."" Surely something can be said for that.",1204848000,10,5167,4.781634938409854
3327946,4,B0012Q732O,"First of all, the movie is great.  The epic nature, the chases, the battles, everything is done to the max.  The viewer can really get the feel of living eons ago, with the struggles of daily life.  I truly enjoyed the entire movie.

However, it may as well have been called Apocalypto II.

A village of people lives peacefully enough.  They hunt giant mastadons and their entire way of life is dependent upon the yearly migration of the beasts.  Basically it's the B.C. version of the tatanka from ""Dances With Wolves"".  Each year the hunt gets more and more difficult, and the hunger of the village follows downward.  They must use their specially honed hunting tactics to take down their prey (Apocalypto!).  Unfortunately, the wise, witchdoctor woman - who apparently is capable of some serious magic - prophecizes that with the last hunt comes the end of their way.

Actually, this movie is so full of mysticism, voodoo, mumbo-jumbo, signs, and legends that it's a little bit much to digest.  It seems that everyone in the movie has some kind of tale to tell.

Anyway, the hunters from this village, who all vie for the sign of dominance in the village (the white spear), are not able to stop a group of hunter-collectors from a far away land from capturing many of their people during a raid (Apocalypto!).  It's up to a select few to chase after the enemies, and free their loved ones (Apocalypto!).

Along the way the protagonist encounters a great sabertooth tiger who is trapped under a log, in a giant pit, and about to drown (Apocalypto!)  The hero saves the beast and becomes some kind of prehistoric Dr. Doolittle.

Naturally, they gather hundreds of warriors from neighboring tribes as they march on through snow, a jungle, as well as a desert.  And when they finally catch up to the abductors, they just happen to find thousands of slaves being used to build the great pyramids (Apocalypto!).  Before they are able to gather all of their strength, and convince the slaves to revolt, one of the members from the village is sacrificed (Apocalypto!).

Eventually the overthrow happens, the bad guys lose and their leader suffers a demoralizing death (Apocalypto!), the good guys use their previously established hunting tricks against their enemies (Apocalypto!), and the star returns to his home to begin anew (Apocalypto!).

The movie is incredibly worthwhile, told fairly well, with superb acting and action.  It's just a shameless Apocalypto ripoff is all.",1204848000,8,2473,4.880095923261391
3327947,4,B0012Q732O,"The trailers for 10,000 B.C. says ""...Journey back to a time of darkness, Journey to a world lost in time"" and boy oh boy, do you journey. From the opening of the film you are swept up into a stone age village in the lofty peaks of the Himalayas, next a jungle filled with prehistoric creatures, then it is an African desert plain complete with a saber-tooth tiger, all before coming to the banks of the Nile to witness the building of the Great Pyramid. All this and more is delivered to you in the diverse locations covered in 10,000 B.C. a film about the beginning of time and civilization.

The film opens with narration from Omar Sharif and the story begins in a tiny mountain top village of mammoth hunters which is ravaged by ""four-legged demons"" (Hun-style soldiers on horses) who capture and kill most of the villagers, save for a handful. Among that handful is a man, D'leh (played by Steven Strait), whose lover, Evolet (played by Camilla Belle) was among the many dragged off as slaves. D'leh and two other warriors waste no time in setting off in hot pursuit of demon raiders. So the journey starts as they trek across every possible extreme landscape up until they find their villagers have been put to work as slaves to build the Great Pyramid. As the three warriors plan a way to free them they are joined by thousands of other African tribe warriors who have also lost loved ones to the slave-seeking raiders, and the final climax is one spectacular epic battle atop the pyramids including more mammoths (they apparently helped the Egyptians pull the massive stones to build the pyramids, debunking the long held theory that aliens did!).

10,000 B.C. is complete eye-candy with its' extravagant CGI, vast sets, detailed costumes, and sweeping cinematography. The acting is average, nothing amazing, but nothing bad. The script is very basic but it works because you would not expect our prehistoric ancestors to break out in eloquent or snappy dialogue.

Overall I was highly entertained and satisfied with outcome. Despite the film having less historical accuracy than even the recent atrocious flop, The Other Boleyn Girl, it still manages to be a good film that holds your eyes with its' magnificent visuals as well as your interest with its' characters that have just enough emotion and heart to be able to invest and connect with them (even if just slightly). 10,000 B.C. is pure exhilarating entertainment, and does what a film should--lets you escape back to a time of darkness, to a world lost in time!

(8/10)",1204848000,18,2536,4.78310502283105
3327948,2,B0012Q732O,"Far too predictable and constantly dragged down by plot holes and epic clichs, Roland Emmerich's latest special effects extravaganza still showcases enough silly fun for those who can easily suspend their disbelief and don't demand well-conceived characters. Basically, no one should like such a film, yet it's still hard not to enjoy the sight of a herd of stampeding mammoths causing death and destruction.

The year is 10,000 B.C., and a remote mountain tribe of mammoth-hunters is attacked by a marauding group of slavers who capture Evolet (Camilla Belle), the promised wife to unwilling leader D'Leh (Steven Strait). Desperate to retrieve his beloved Eve, D'Leh embarks on a perilous mission across treacherous mountains, predator-infested jungles, and burning deserts, that will find him uniting several warrior tribes to overthrow the tyrannical leader of a lost civilization.

It's as clear as white rain that 10,000 B.C. isn't striving for any manner of authenticity in its portrayal of ancient anything. At best mimicking an Apocalypto in Egypt and at worst an inferior retelling of One Million Years B.C., Emmerich's film attempts to shadow what could have been in ""300: The Bedtime Story,"" but sacrifices any true power and intensity with sappiness and stereotypes. The decision to have the protagonist's tribe speak English may seem logical to entice the average moviegoer, but a careful examination isn't required to find several contradictory and unnecessary narrations. In an attempt to feign authenticity, much of the dialogue feels contrived and pointless. Lines like ""just try it"" as a contemptuous retort just don't belong in a pre-history epic.

Another area that betrays the film's setting is the casting. Faces that are far too pretty and teeth that are way too white scream Hollywood, though this film isn't exactly meant to be a history lesson. All of the primary cast do the best with the dialogue they're given and Camilla Belle certainly looks like a prize worth chasing after, but don't expect the energy or thrills of something like Apocalypto.

10,000 B.C. thrives on its CGI effects, and while not all it portrays is flawless or very realistic (as realistic as giant dodos and wooly mammoths can be anyway), what it attempts is still satisfyingly grand. Stampeding furry elephants, velociraptor-esque dodos and a not-so-mean saber-toothed tiger round out the brunt of the prehistoric creatures and much of their resulting action sequences do entertain. The most impressive special effects, however, belong to the long shots of gargantuan pyramids being constructed by thousands of scurrying people. When these massive monuments inevitably come crashing down, that's pretty thrilling too. Quite a bit of creativity (though probably not much authenticity) went into the unique and varied costumes that adorn each tribe of warriors, as well as the enslaving tyrants who recall their majestic and garishly dressed counterparts in the earlier ancient tale, 300.

If you were excited by the trailer for 10,000 B.C., you'll probably go see it regardless of how many ill words we can throw at it, and maybe you shouldn't let a lack of story, character development, and realism stop you from enjoying a little mindless, guilty-pleasure, action-adventure fun. Well, maybe it should.

3327993,3,B0012Q732O,"The reality is that maybe this movie should have been titled ""The Girl with Blue Eyes"" or some other mystical name, not a historical date.  It makes you believe that you are going to get a historical account of what it was like to live in 10,000 B.C., and it simply doesn't do that.  It's a tale, a story, complete with mythical and magical elements.

The story itself is decent.  A young girl is found and she is quite lovely with blue eyes, a rarity at the time.  Her town was destroyed by ""four-legged demons,"" men on horses.  Years later, the elder woman, a seer, predicts that these demons will come to her people as well.  A young boy falls in love with the young girl and they grow up together.  The four-legged demons do, in fact, come and the story starts to unfold centering around these two star-crossed lovers.

There are a lot of logistical problems with the tale such as, men walking for days and going through several different types of climate zones and also the question of understanding different dialects and languages seamlessly.  This can all be overlooked if we simply look at this as a tale that perhaps was told around campfires to pass the time.",1494115200,,1170,4.5285714285714285

but movies like 10,000BC, which are fun, fantasy, adventure, romance, buddy-bonding, etc and so on, are the ones that the public consumes, AND, the ones that allow the ""artistes"" of Hollywood to finance their grand failures at the box office.

3328066,3,B0012Q732O,"I gave it 3 star because the film is decent and the effects for being an older film hold up well. It's basically a cave man film if you're into that. At first I was a little afraid the CGI was going to look bad, since older films with CGI look fake on HD sets. They held up well.

The film starts with a tribe of cavemen that encounter a group of egyptian people (Pyramids are being constructed) and they take some of thier men and woman to force them into slavery. Along the way, they encounter more tribes that also lost people to the egyptians. The Egyptians are portrayed as very advanced with boats and massive buildings structure and machinery. The film is rated as an adventure film, but to me it played out more like a quest to get his people back. Along the way random events happen like running into massive land birds and random animals. I liked how they portrayed out of place looking people like albinos, blue eyed people as unique and different for that era. Also the egyptians costumes are normal and not over the top like some films make them out to be. (This feels/looks more real)

The film is not a documentary it's fantasy adventure.  I know some people were upset because its not 100% accurate especially with cavemen speaking english. That is petty, its fun popcorn flick. The reason I rated it 3 stars was because it lacked big moments and i'm not a fan of slow motion battles.",1472860800,,1400,4.4186046511627906

3328111,1,B0012Q732O,"my positive review of the great film ""Quest for Fire"" has led me here, just to this worst of all Emmerich crappy films. It's so bad, it hurts!

My time is too precious to more than just briefly refer to the film-defects that make me downright angry. Angry because a truely great film like ""Quest for Fire"" is less well known and less profitable than Swabian-Spielbergs ""kunterbunte mammoth sause"". (untranslateable)
The shortcomings are mentionened sufficiently in the 1-stars. Nevertheless, the most important aspect:

Emmerich charcters are generally so stereotyped, one-dimensional, bloodless and fake, that they do not actually touch me at all. So as much as 0.0. They only serve as extras, as a human dummy for CGI bombastic overkill effects. As a spectator one should at least care for certain characters, hope for them or fear. Emmerich has the ""talent"" that I do not care about all his characters.
Whether someone dies or not, I simply don't care at all. And I had this feeling even stronger than in other films here of R.E.
Because due to the setting in 10,000 bc, it is even more obvious, that the assembled troop of pop-batches here act in sheer mummery like a bunch of carnival astray - hilarious.
Nothing seems authentic, just fake in every way.

Sorry, but a director who refuses to take his characters seriously or cannot even make them lovable, ""wastes"" all his technical FX.

3328161,2,B0012Q732O,"Roland Emmerich seems unable to think small.  The word is clearly not in his vocabulary.  He gives us things like ""Independence Day,"" ""Godzilla,"" ""The Patriot,"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow"":  big movies filled with big casts and big special effects.  With ""ID4"" the spectacle worked because he did the film tongue in cheek.  With the others, the scale tended to overwhelm the subject matter.  So, has he learned his lesson?  Not with ""10,000 BC.""  The only thing he scaled down in this 2008 production was leaving the punctuation out of B.C.  Otherwise, it's more of the same:  lots of CGI and a minimum of story and character.  This gets tiresome really fast, even in a movie with a clear, high-definition image and robust Dolby TrueHD sound.

On the plus side, at least we don't have Raquel Welch or Ringo Starr battling dinosaurs.  On the minus side, we don't get much that resembles serious historical accuracy.  I mean, the story starts out OK, with prehistoric Man hunting mammoths in the northern lands of Europe (or Asia; it's unclear), but it soon disintegrates into melodramatic hogwash about pyramids and domesticated mammoths and hints of higher intelligences, gods, or Atlanteans helping to advance civilization.

Maybe Emmerich thought he was doing another ""2001,"" I dunno.  He gets away with playing fast and loose with archaeological events by having his film's narrator (Omar Sharif) explain that the story is about myth and legend.  Maybe he should also have said it was about fantasy and science fiction because that's pretty much what it comes down to.

The main character in the story is D'Leh (Steven Strait).  At least, I think he's the main character since he shows up more often than anybody else.  It's hard to tell, though, as the characters look so much alike under their heavy clothing, dark hairpieces, and thick makeup.  An old woman, considered a shaman of sorts by D'Leh's people, foretells that four-legged demons will come among them and that D'Leh will become their savior.  They do, and he does.

The first things we learn about people twelve thousand years ago is that they apparently never washed, and they had oddities with their language.  Dubious.  Even animals in the wild keep clean, but D'Leh's people seem dirty all the time, with matted, knotted hair and faces that look as though they use mud for mascara.  Worse, his people speak modern English haltingly and with an accent.  Sure, having characters speak in a movie audience's native tongue is a convention we have come to accept, unless we want subtitles, but why do these characters speak as though they had just recently learned to speak a second language?

Anyway, the object of D'Leh's eye is the lovely Evolet (Camilla Belle), whom the prophecy says D'Leh will marry.  The trouble is, it ain't going to be easy.  When the four-legged demons arrive (on horseback; therefore, four legs), they are slave traders who raid and pillage D'Leh's village, taking prisoners with them to sell into captivity.  Evolet is one of the prisoners they take.  Incidentally, while the others of D'Leh's people look like that five-thousand-year-old mummified ""Iceman"" that scientists found frozen in the snow some years ago, Ms. Belle looks like she just stepped through the front portals of Hollywood High.  Only in the movies, I suppose.

D'Leh survives the raid and heads out to rescue his love and the others taken captive, thus potentially fulfilling his mythic destiny.  What he gets into is utterly preposterous.  He and several companions travel from their frozen homeland in the North, over snowcapped mountains, through humid tropical rain forests, into arid, rocky wastelands, and finally to a flat, desert terrain, all within what appears to be a few days.  Along the trek, D'Leh frees and befriends a huge, saber-toothed cat, battles gigantic, flightless birds, and gathers an army to fight the great nations of the South.  He makes it look easy.

This is where the story really falls apart.  D'Leh presumably winds up in Egypt, where he finds a highly advanced civilization using slave labor and trained mammoths to build pyramids as instructed by a ruler known only as the ""Almighty.""  (Am I giving away too much?  I think not, since the movie's trailers showed these very scenes.)  Now, I know there are some people who subscribe to such radical theories about early pyramid building, but recent archaeological evidence suggests that the Egyptians started constructing their first pyramids about five thousand years ago, not twelve thousand, and that they did not use massive armies of slaves to build them but small groups of highly skilled workers whom they probably paid well for their efforts.

And domesticated mammoths?  If we were to believe that, common sense would lead us to ask, Then why did mammoths become extinct?  And why didn't the Egyptians ever mention mammoths in their hieroglyphics or portray them in their paintings (if, indeed, the people D'Leh encounters are ancestors of Egyptians at all--the movie never refers to them by name, although it does show us what appears to be the Sphinx under construction)?

Emmerich presents the entire story in a slow, solemn procession of scenes that would suggest he thought of it as some kind of religious ceremony.  None of his characters ever laughs or jokes.  Or bare smile, as far I could tell.  It's as if he thought human nature was somehow different back then; that life was so hard and the people so uncivilized, no one had any fun.  People are people, and I'm sure our ancestors had as much of a good time as we do today.  Still, that might spoil the tenor of Emmerich's picture, so everybody's got to be deadly serious.  D'Leh and his companions even walk to slow, solemn, heroic-sounding music.  It gets awfully silly, awfully fast.

""10,000 BC"" has all the excitement of a National Geographic Channel special but with none of the content.  Although the CGI work is OK, the cinematography is pleasing, the high-def picture and sound are nice, and a couple of segments--notably a mammoth hunt early on--are reasonably exciting, most of the film is simply a matter of waiting for it to end.

Video:
The high-definition Blu-ray picture, using a VC-1, 1080p, BD25 transfer, is somewhat better than the standard-definition version, but that should be a given.  Both versions capture the film's 2.40:1 aspect ratio and do what they can with the film's dusky tone.  The director no doubt wanted to portray our ancient ancestors in the darkest, most-primitive possible light, thus using a subdued color pallette throughout the film.  At its best, the high-def picture is clean, with strong contrasts, fairly deep black levels, and sharp object outlines.  Unlike its SD cousin, it never becomes outright fuzzy, although it is somewhat soft on inner detailing, especially noticeable in facial close-ups.  When things do lighten up for a few minutes, the HD video is fine, the whites of the snow showing up particularly well and the scenery well delineated.  Moreover, you'll find print grain at a minimum, which is either a blessing or a curse depending on how much detail you prefer.

Audio:
Warner engineers offer the sound in regular Dolby Digital 5.1 or Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  As with the SD edition, the audio easily upstages the picture quality.  Switching back and forth between the regular and the lossless tracks, one hears a greater clarity in the TrueHD, a tauter bass, and perhaps, at least subjectively, a stronger dynamic thrust.

Again it's the mammoth hunt near the beginning of the story and then the coming of the four-legged demons that demonstrate the soundtrack to its best advantage.  While I found the TrueHD track a little bright and forward, it does an excellent job with surround sounds, even subtle ones like the noises of the forest, the beasts, and the hubbub of the crowds that envelop the listener immpressively.

Extras:
Warners have added several more extras to the Blu-ray edition that you won't find on the standard-definition version of the movie.  The first item is the thirteen-minute featurette ""A Wild and Wooly Ride,"" which takes us behind the scenes of the movie's CGI and set designs.  The second item is the thirteen-minute featurette ""Inspiring an Epic,"" which explains how Emmerich got his fanciful inspiration from a book called ""Fingerprints of the Gods"" by Graham Hancock.  Emmerich tells us that just making a movie about primitive people hunting mammoths might have been a bit boring, so he wanted to throw in something more unusual.  He did, and it didn't help.

Next, we have the extras carried over from the SD edition, which include an alternate ending, about three minutes, and a series of additional scenes, about ten minutes total.  WB present all of these deleted segments in widescreen, by the way, and I wonder why they didn't use them in the theatrical cut to flesh it out.  The extras conclude with twenty-six scene selections but no chapter insert; English, French, and Spanish spoken languages; French and Spanish subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.

You can also download a digital copy of the movie by going to a specified Warner Bros. Web site, selecting a preferred file format (iTunes or Windows Media), and when prompted entering an authorization code.

Parting Shots:
The first big-scale movies I remember seeing in my youth were a rerelease of ""Gone With the Wind"" and later the premire of ""The Ten Commandments.""  They were enormously long, epic films, but they seemed to move along quite briskly.  By contrast, ""10,000 BC"" is only 109 minutes, counting about ten minutes of closing credits, yet it goes by in what seems like six hours.  Not all ""big"" movies are the same.  This one has a story that fails to engage us and characters who fail to involve us.

3328163,5,B0012Q732O,"I saw this movie in theaters and remember loving it. The next day, I went online and was amazed to realize that it got about 10% positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. Most of the complaints were regarding historical accuracy. Really??? It's a fantasy movie, and all you're interested in is historical accuracy?
This is one of those situations where critics largely disagreed with viewers, as the movie was a box office success and is getting almost 3.5 stars here on Amazon. Unlike critics, most people prefer action filled entertainment over scientific facts. And this movie delivered that by the bucketload. Critics generally agreed that this movie was visually stunning, drawing visual comparisons to Jurassic Park or even Lord of the Rings. However, unlike viewers, they were expecting a historical documentary instead of an epic fantasy.
In conclusion, if you want to watch a documentary, go watch Blue Planet. However, if far fetched fantasies don't make your blood boil, give this movie a try.",1431907200,2,999,5.134969325153374

People need to calm the heck down and stop looking for perfection. Stop being the person who ruins it for everyone else because it wasn't up to your level.

I adore this movie. Camilla Belle is a fantastic actress. Steven Strait is a fantastic actor. I believed the love story and I sympathized with the characters when need be.

This movie is endearing and light hearted fun with awesome FANTASTICAL! (THATS RIGHT PEOPLE, ALL THE HISTORICAL INACCURACIES WERE DONE ON PURPOSE! IT IS CLEARLY LABELED FANTASY! DUH!) Elements woven into it. If you want to watch a historical  movie, next time read the genres of a movie first before you rant out on something totally dumb. Grow up and learn to read, thank you!

Now, I'm sorry for being ""rude"" (if that's what you're thinking). But this movie deserves some credit. It is pretty great if you don't have you're head shoved some where not very nice.",1422230400,,923,4.672839506172839

There are solid memorable moments like the encounter with the saber tooth cat and the mammoth hunt. Over all not a top of the heap, spectacular film but enjoyable and entertaining. I like this movie because it's different, If you enjoyed 'Clan of the Cave Bear' or 'Quest for Fire' you'll like this film.

This is a kind of sci-fi film in reverse, not about the future, but an imaginative impossible past. We don't have to believe that the clan's mother can predict the future and control the weather. We do not have to think that a cave man would give up his leadership of the clan because he did not kill the mammoth elephant directly but only by stealth. We also need not accept the notion that a tribal leader would leave his tribe to find a better place for his people but do so acting as if he is a coward running away so that no one would want to join him in the search. Nor must we accept as true that a cave man can save a saber-tooth tiger who will remember that the man saved him and come to do the same for the man. No, we need not accept any of these things as true to enjoy the film.",1421280000,,884,4.115606936416185

 This is not so much a cave man movie, although you might think so from the title, as an adventure fantasy.  Think more Conan the Barbarian rather than Quest for Fire.  In the story a little band of Stone Age folk is attacked by slavers who round up, for reasons that become clear latter in the film, the men of the band, and the heros fey and fated girlfriend.
 The middle of the movie is burned up with a long chase where the hero gathers allies and tracks the slavers.  Eventually, the good guys catch up with the bad guys.  At that time we discover that the slavers wanted the men to help build the pyramids.  Of course the Godlike man in charge, a refugee from Atlantis, also had the help of trained Mastodons to move the big rocks around.  So now we know how it was done.  Slaves and Mastodons built the pyramids.
 The good parts of the movie are first and foremost the stunning photography.  The wide views of mountains and desserts are to the eye what hot fudge is to the taste buds.  There are two, count them two, separate and distinct Mastodon stampedes.  You cant get that sort of thing just anywhere.  I found the slave revolt to be exciting and inspirational.
 The down side includes the hero who speaks cave man with a Scottish accent.  The dialog in general sounds like it was translated from the words of a particularly pretentious Algonquin elder.
 The cast is made up of actors from New Zealand and South Africa that we in the US haven't seen before.  Big name actors would have been wasted in this special effects epic.  Camilla Belle played the leading female role.  She is so beautiful that she is sure to appear in future films that allow her to act.
This film is rated PG 13 for violence.  It runs one hour and 49 minutes.  It generated $36 million in its first three days, so lots of people are going to see the Mastodons.  Two and a half stars.  If you liked Scorpion King you will like this movie, its better looking.",1412380800,,1955,4.363888888888889

Instead we get mister pop-paranoia-psychology himself making what has got to be one of the worst movies in the Pre-historic genre regarding a very clean looking ""caveman"" who is confronted with a movie director's vision of the challenges of living with primitive technology.

This thing could have been so much better, just like another reviewer stated, but it wasn't.  And what's worse is that people flocked to this film, and continue to flock to it.

I don't know if I was the only one to pick up on this, but the action in this movie was very similar to that of Avatar, which I seem to notice every day as the most un-original film ever made. 10,000 B.C., while its script may not have been award-worthy or truly memorable, the visuals, action sequences and awesome scale were enough. Roland has always delivered when it comes to disaster films, as he is the master (ID4, Day After Tomorrow and 2012), but he also has his more subtle and very memorable films as well, for being different (The Patriot and Anonymous), even if they didn't have a liking by everyone. But it's 10,000 B.C. that is his most interesting film because, well, it was successful, and different. We can speculate and determine some specifics of what life was before the death of Christ, before the building of the Pyramids, but after the Cavemen left their caves, but we don't know much, and his vision of this truly lost world is very incredible. Of every blockbuster released in the past decade, this was among the best half, honestly. Not even half of Michael Bay's films are as good as 10,000 B.C., specifically the Bad Boys movies, Transformers sequels and The Island.

All-in-all, when counting in the great visuals, superb musical score and good directing with the decent script and alright acting, 10,000 B.C. is a good, entertaining movie that's ultimately an underrated gem. It's not for everyone, but it is a good movie",1370736000,,1699,4.720538720538721

However, I will say that this is a good work of *fiction* that explores some fantasy and yes, some facts, about pre-historic man. I found the relativity of technology interesting. For example, one civilization is purely stone, but gets attacked by a civilization that uses metal (copper?). The metal users also have horses, so to the stone civ seems like 4-legged demons. (spoilers) Then later you see an even FAR more advanced civ. Obviously these types of boundaries must have existed, and it is interesting to imagine what would happen if these bumped up against each other. This movie does explore that.

Man, or some form of man, existed for millions of years before present day. Rarely do movies, or books for that matter, try to explore what life must have been like at those times. This movie attempts to do that. It is not perfect, but I give them credit for making a competent attempt and coming up with an interesting story. I know a lot of people will laugh at historical inaccuracies. Remember, though, anything that is 100% historically accurate would probably not be exciting for 90 minutes.

And, I could spend all day picking this film apart - BUT IT""S A FANTASY STORY! HELLO! Remember: FANTASY! That's what I paid my money for! Not a documentary or historical fiction, but a FANTASTIC, DREAM-LIKE story.

Nor do you have to be a genius to figure this out!

The movie works on many levels. First, as an adventure story, a saga, like Lord of the Rings. I felt swept away. It's also an enjoyable love story. The chemistry between the actors is excellent. I cared about the characters. In addition to being erotic! - Its been a long time since I've seen so many good looking men and women on the Big Screen all at one time!

Very little of the violence is graphic or gratuitous. You can tell a fantastic story without blood and guts flying everywhere. It's also a movie suitable for older children.

Tribal people and people of color are shown with respect. Their rich variety of physical features, skin colors, dress, languages and architecture are shown in all its glory. Before the White Man came, and ruined everything, there was mind boggling cultural diversity on this planet!

What is most striking to me is the very moving and insightful portrayal of a Medicine Women performing profound acts of shamanism in order to help protect her people as best as she can. This is the very first time I seen such a pivotal role for tribal spiritual beliefs in a big Hollywood fantasy film! My hats off to the whomever wrote the screenplay! You did your homework!

Granted the ending did bother me a bit. It begs the question: Did the ancient Egyptians actually treat their workers that poorly? If only the Egyptians didn't use slaves, and treated their workers well. And what a metaphor for the year 2008, where most workers in the world are treated like dirt and instead of whips, the fear of dire poverty is used to keep most of the world's workers in line.

But I digress, this is a great movie. At the end a tear rolled down my cheek, and I felt good when I left the theater. That's all I can ask of a story. My money was well spent, for a change!

The story is okay. At the beginning of the movie, a narrator tells the legend of how a beautiful blue eyed girl, the lone survivor of her people, came to live with the tribe and the prophecy associated with her. I liked that the movie didn't have crude or foul language. I think that aspect created an appropriate ambiance for the simple lifestyle of the prehistoric tribe.

3328298,5,B0012Q732O,"n 10,000 BC, a tribe of hunter-gatherers called the Yagahl live in a remote mountain range in the Urals and survive by killing woolly mammoths. D'Leh, a young hunter, has a companion named Evolet, an orphan who was found by the tribe. D'Leh, while hunting mammoths, manages to kill one and wins the ""White Spear"". He also wins Evolet in marriage, but feels he deserves neither since he killed the mammoth by accident.

One day, D'Leh and several others are away when horse-raiders called the ""Four Legged Demons"" attack the Yaghal camp. The horse raiders enslave Evolet; D'Leh, Tic'Tic, KaRen, and Baku pursue them to save her. They enter a rainforest where they are attacked by a large pack of terror birds. In this encounter, Tic'Tic gets wounded and Baku and Ka'Ren are captured. D'Leh rescues Evolet, but she is later re-captured. Continuing on, they meet others whose loved ones were taken by the raiders. D'Leh and Tic'Tic befriend Nakudu, leader of the Naku tribe. He tells D'Leh of a prophecy: whoever talks to a Smilodon that they call the ""Spear-Tooth"" will help free their people. D'Leh had earlier saved the Spear-Tooth from drowning in a trap and it had spared his life. D'Leh realizes the prophecy was about him. Nakudu explains that his loved ones were taken in the ""Great Red Birds"", ships with large red sails, to the ""Mountains of the Gods"", from which no one has ever returned. They then come together with other tribes, who agree to form a coalition to pursue the raiders.

They find the ships with red sails holding Evolet and Baku. They have no means to follow the ships, so they journey through a vast desert, discovering an advanced civilization similar to ancient Egypt, ruled by an enigmatic figure known as ""The Almighty"", who is said to be the last survivor of his kind. The Almighty, who is regarded as a living god, possesses many thousands of slaves that he is using to build a huge pyramid complex in his honor. D'Leh finds an escaped servant of the Almighty and notices he is wearing a bracelet worn by D'Leh's father. D'Leh's father left his tribe for food and found the Naku tribe before being stolen by the raiders. In a night attack, the guards of the slaves discover D'Leh behind a pyramid. Tic'Tic dies from injuries from killing the guards before they raise the alarm. Meanwhile, the Almighty's priests discover Evolet bears scars on her hand patterned after the ""Mark of the Hunter"", the constellation Orion. The priests believe it is part of a prophecy that whoever wears the mark of the Hunter is destined to kill The Almighty. D'Leh starts a full-scale rebellion amongst the slaves. They cause the mammoth herd, used in building the pyramid, to stampede and kill a large number of troops.

The Almighty offers Evolet to D'Leh in exchange for abandoning his rebellion. The Almighty says that if D'Leh takes his wife, his warriors can return, but the rest must be his slaves forever. D'Leh feigns acceptance of the deal which allows him to throw a spear at The Almighty and kill him, proving that he is not a god. During the ensuing battle, the raider obsessed with Evolet kidnaps her on horseback. Evolet grabs an arrow and stabs the warlord in the side, knocking them both off the horse. D'Leh rushes towards her, but the raider shoots her in the back. D'Leh kills him and returns to Evolet, and she dies in his arms. The scene shifts to the tribe's wise woman as she breathes in deeply and then breathes out her last breath. The scene then returns to D'Leh still holding Evolet's body when she suddenly awakens, restored by the wise woman's sacrifice. They depart for home and bid farewell to the other tribes.

In an alternative ending, the scene shifts forward many years into the future, showing Baku's retelling of the story by the camp fire. It ends with a child asking what had happened to the ""Mountains of the Gods"", and Baku responds ""They were taken back by the sands. Lost to time, lost to man.""",1337040000,2,3951,4.696969696969697
3328299,3,B0012Q732O,"Roland Emmerich has a style of movie making that is very impressive. Even when I don't love the project, it is usually pleasing to the eye and leaves me with something to think about. 10,000 BC is his most recent project and while it is not his best work, it is one of the most unique and memorable.

Mammoths are a way of life for the people of the small village in the midst of the ancient wilds. They provide food, clothing, and opportunities for trade with neighboring tribes. But in recent years their presence has become more scarce and thus far more valuable. They are also extremely dangerous and almost impossible to kill except in massive hunting parties. D'Leh (Steven Strait) is far from the best huntsman among his people. He's also something of an outcast since his father abandoned him and the village many years before. But he does have the eye of the beautiful Evolet (Camilla Belle). But she is destined to be the wife of the best hunter among them... and it's not likely to be him. Until fortune changes and by sheer dumb luck, he manages to kill a mammoth all by himself, something that earns him the right to brandish the white spear and choose his bride. Too humble to accept the spear under false pretenses, he mourns that he will never marry Evolet...

The grandmother of the tribe has professed that four-legged demons will come into their midst and take away something precious. That very night, foreign tribesmen on horseback steal into the community and make off with what they can carry, including D'Leh's beloved Evolet, since her blue eyes are rare. Along with a handful of his friends, D'Leh sets out to save her and his trek through the wilds that lay over the mountains will take him to more dangerous places than he could have ever envisioned.

I am not a big fan of movies set in prehistoric times but this one is surprisingly good for the genre. It does ask you to suspend your belief on many occasions but is depicted as a sort of ancient grand adventure, complete with saber tooth tigers, wooly mammoths, and cavemen so ragged and filthy that you know they must smell even worse. What actually amazed me the most was that underneath ragged dreadlocks and a bucket full of dirt, Camilla Belle can still be outstandingly gorgeous -- maybe even more so due to Evolet's uniquely blue eyes. She isn't just a throwaway heroine either but has some spunk, which she needs as she carries her half of the story on with the tradesmen. The animation is flawless and the creatures look fairly realistic (although they seem to be about twice as big as history tells us they were). It is something of a sprawling epic so don't expect to see just wild lands... there is a towering city complete with an evil ""god"" and lots of sinister minions.

This film presents a very noble and moral set of ethic guidelines that implies that in order to survive, a civilization must be governed through forces of good rather than an interest in evil. Heroism is applauded, evil abhorred. And that is a good thing in our modern age.",1332374400,2,3041,4.584558823529412

3328301,2,B0012Q732O,"I went to this movie expecting it to be a fantasy; therefore, I suspended my logic. I just wanted to enjoy the special effects. They turned out to be a mixed bag. They are riveting, and look real in the scenes where the doldos (giant birds) chase and kill the men. The mastodons look impressive and convincing too. However the saber-toothed tiger look obviously fake. The ending scenes where the pyramid was being built are one of the most spectacular I ever seen. It looks huge, lively and beautiful.

The plot is an exact copy of Apocalypto. Yet this film does not have the suspense and intensity of Apocalypto. The acting is not convincing either. At the end, a few people laughed when the female character was resurrected from her death but I didn't mind. I had already expected it to be a fantasy.

Overall, it's worth watching once for curiosity. Everybody who likes dinosaurs will certainly wants to see this picture. As for me, after seeing this, I pulled out the DVD copies of ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" from BBC and viewed them. They look real and much more interesting",1323820800,,1077,4.663157894736842
3328302,2,B0012Q732O,"Admittedly, my memory of 10,000 B.C. is a bit unstable after watching it on HBO a few years ago.  I remember the rudimentary plot - young warrior of woolly mammoth hunting tribe is predestined to save his azure-eyed girlfriend from a more advanced Egyptian-like race.  I remember (I think) the opening shot of the mammoth hunt where the young warrior earns his stripes by standing his ground and holding a spear for a mammoth to impale itself upon.  I remember the mammoth tribes journey across several jumbled climate zones (grassland, jungle, desert) to retrieve the young woman, Evolet.  I certainly remember the encounter with the carnivorous terror-birds (Phorusracos), one of the few exciting parts of the movie.  I sorta remember a man from another tribe agreeing to help the young mammoth hunter (can't remember his name) in his quest.  I remember the young hunter being trapped in some watery hole with an enormous saber-tooth cat and the hunter saying something hilariously to the effect, ""I'll free you if you promise not to eat me"". He frees the cat and the cat doesn't eat him.  However, the sabertooth doesn't do much else in the movie.  And, yeah, I remember, the Egyptian-like civilization using mammoths to construct their monuments and pyramids (actually not a bad touch).

However, what I most remember is a physical impossibility - mammoths galloping like horses over the meadows.  Now, like most elephants, mammoths would have managed at best a shuffling walk - pretty fast but no gallop.  It was logical gaffes like this that actually made me realize what a junk heap of a movie 10,000 B.C. really is, if you stop to think about it.

3328311,1,B0012Q732O,"""10,000 B.C."" is a classic example of a film where all the budget was put into the cinematography and special effect, with little regard given to the script and acting. The results are an epic adventure tale, that is neither adventurous or epic.

This story of a young hunter who faces his predestined fate to lead his tribe, could have been a compelling and intense story of human history. But the script is so horribly flawed and the acting so bland, that there is nothing to emotionally connect the audience to the characters or the story. You simply don't really care about any of it.

I never bought the love story between the two lead characters. Their unemotive acting skills, hampered by a scripted romance that is so schmaltzy and unbelievable, that it isn't even worthy of being used as a dime store romance novel, much less a major budget motion picture, never brings about any sense of true emotion from the viewer. You not only don't believe these two people love each other, you don't even care enough to wonder why you feel that way. I'll admit I wasn't around back then to see how these people interacted with each other, but I can tell you it was probably nothing at all like this. And the way the girl survives to be with her man in the end, is so mind-numbingly unbelievable, it is more of an insult to the viewers intelligence, rather than the uplifting emotional moment the writers and director probably intended it to be.

Another problem with the film is all the historical inaccuracies. When you want to make a film that is based on the history of the human race on Earth, if you can't create a stirring tale of fiction with human history as the backdrop, you'd do well to try to keep as close to the facts as you can. I mean, while the ancient Egyptians did use slave labor to build their vast cities and monuments, I don't believe that Woolly Mammoths were there to help in that. If this movie was about some alien world, I might be able to overlook this kind of thing, but if you are going to use actual Earth history as your setting, either use it right or don't use it at all. When it can be said that ""One Million Years B.C."" is a more historically accurate film, you know something is seriously wrong with your film's script and research.

Of course, the biggest problem I personally had with the film was the extremely slow and plodding pace, as the characters spend lots of time just walking around. I could have taken mini-naps between the major scenes of the film and not felt lost when I awoke and started watching it again. We get it, alright? They are traveling great distances. You don't need to make the audience feel like they are on one themselves, as they watch the film. An adventure tale is supposed to be exciting, not boring.

The one place the film does get it right, though, is the cinematography. There is some brilliant and breathtaking camera work here, with some very gorgeous wide angle shots of the lands the characters travel through. It is the one place where the film truly shines. It is not, however, anywhere near enough to reverse the detriments in the script, acting and researching of the film to make the story even remotely enjoyable.

""10,000 B.C."" could have been one of the great epic adventure stories of the the last decade, but being saddled with poorly emoting actors, an unbelievable soap opera romance, historical inaccuracies you could fly a jumbo jet through, and a pace so slow and tedious it would put a snail to sleep, the film instead becomes one of the biggest and most costly of viewing disappointments, perhaps of all time (""Waterworld"" has nothing on this film, believe me)! Unless you have a bad case of insomnia, give this film a major pass.",1311552000,,3727,4.555223880597015

Give it a rest.

This is not intended to be Casablanca, the Godfather, or Schindler's List. This is a popcorn movie, and it should be reviewed as such. Perspective, people. If you want multidimensional characters and a deep meaty story, go read A Song of Fire and Ice. If you want a fun escape on a Friday night after a long working week, this is your movie.

As for my review, I'll keep it short and sweet. Beautiful vistas, unwilling heroes, GREAT action set pieces, some good CGI and some nasty villains. What more do you need from an A-class trash masterpiece like this?  And as a lover of trash movies, I use that word as a compliment.

Five stars, for this genre. If you enjoy silly trash like One Million Years BC or 1960's The Time Machine, you'll probably get a kick out of this. Just remember, it's only a story, it's not intended to be real.

And thank you, Roland Emmerich, for making such great escapist trash, from Stargate to 2012. All of Emmerich's movies are absurd, ridiculous junk, and all of them are as entertaining as hell.

3328315,2,B0012Q732O,"One nice thing about the period from 30,000 BC to about 7000 BC, from the little we know from archeology (Maritja Gimbutas), is that during this Paleolithic age, the Goddess reigned.  A massive amount of Goddess statuary exists from this time period, and we do not see ""God"" sculptures until closer to 7000 BC, when a God comes into existence as a son/consort of the Goddess.

Unfortunately, we don't see anything like this in this movie.  I don't believe that movies have to be true to life: they're often more fun if they're not.  However, we have far too many male warrior-hero movies: we really don't need more and more and more of this type of story, particularly when our civilization is under threat of collapse because of the male-dominated warrior-hero way it's been run for the last 5000 years.  We need a return to the GOddess, and this movie missed a good opportunity to help in that.

In this movie, there are hundreds, no -- thousands -- of male characters, but only two female characters.  One of the female characters is nothing much more than a prize for the male hero, and the other, a Shamanic priestess of her ancient tribe, ends up sacrificing her own life in order that the life of the young male hero might be happier and fruitful.  So this story, instead of being centered on the Goddess, is really about the ""death"" of the GOddess as a sort of sacrifice for the birth of a male-centered, warrior-based, patriarchal culture in which women really have no signifcant role to play as individuals in their own right.  WHich is not really the story of 10,000 BC, it's the story of 3000 BC to the present time.",1304812800,2,1628,4.586206896551724
3328316,2,B0012Q732O,"A movie as bonkers as Roland Emmerich's 10,000 B.C. really ought to be a lot more fun than this actually is. Partially inspired by some of Graham Hancock's less daffy theories of a lost higher civilisation in the Stone Age who really built the pyramids, this sees Steven Strait's hunter-gatherer setting off after the slavers who took the love of his life and the village's other hunters to build the pyramids (with a little bit of help from mammoths, of course). The title promises enjoyable nonsense along the lines of the Harryhausen One Million Years B.C., and with a sabre-tooth tiger and some Terror Birds thrown into the mix the elements are certainly there for good old fashioned brain-off entertainment, but at times it feels almost as long a slog as the one that takes its hero from the barren mountains of New Zealand across Namibia to the plains of Giza. Certainly the first half is pretty dull, with even the scene with Terror Birds (think big turkeys with big teeth, which is at least appropriate for Christmas) picking off slaves and slavers alike in long grass playing like a considerably less effective version of the velociraptor attack from Spielberg's The Lost World with a bit of Mysterious Island thrown in for bad measure.

Things do finally pick up a bit when they finally reach `the mountains of the Gods,' but not really enough. It may be the most spectacular part of the picture but at times it feels like an early rejected draft of Stargate - oh look, another evil godlike villain who may be an alien or from Atlantis, and what's this, revolting slaves led by a white man from a far-off land? Clich&eacute;s like this really need more panache than they're given here to come off, and the casting doesn't exactly help you overlook the film's shortcomings. Steven Strait isn't exactly blessed with much charisma as the reluctant hero, coming over a bit like Colin Farrell's well meaning younger brother, Camilla Belle is awful pretty but it's hard to tell if she can actually act when she doesn't have much to do except look confused, the ever-erratic Cliff Curtis is pretty awful here and Omar Sharif manages the almost impressive feat of both underplaying and overacting his narration that seems intended to paper over the gaps and add a bit of emotion to the proceedings (the deletion of his cameo in the original ending spared audiences the worst of his performance, though it can be found on the DVD and all-region BluRay along with 10 deleted scenes and a couple of brief featurettes). Matters aren't helped by co-writer/co-producer/co-composer (with Thomas Wander, ne Wanker) Harold Kloser's score which constantly turns into Hans Zimmer's main theme from King Arthur with such monotonous regularity that you start expecting Maire Brennan to start singing.

The idea that Atlantis is or was what we now know as Cuba. The oldest ruins actually carbon dated on earth are not found in Egypt, England, the Netherlands or even Iceland, but on the island of Malta. And there is still some debate about different types of ore being used for weapons long before iron was used, or better put KNOWN to be used. So if you can, or even want to, open your mind a little, and watch this story for what it is, a visionary tale that is not great by any means, but uses a lot of creative license and somewhat imaginitive story telling that crosses many boundries. I gave the movie a 4 star rating, because I took it for what it was, or what I thought it was meant to be, a story that was more fantasy than just fiction, more about imagination than accuracy.

The plot is exceptionally trite: Woman stolen by raiders as sex object (Evolet) and chased after by amorous male (D'Le).  The ending falls apart when Evolet is gratuitously killed and brought back to life. The viewer is constantly asked to suspend disbelief when confronted with totally inaccurate representations: slave traders on horseback with saddles and rope stirrups (but then, in the absence of discretely hidden saddle horns and rope stirrups, how could the slavers drag a line of people behind them, let alone one person, without being jerked off their horse), having to travel from Northern Europe, across Africa and the Sahara Dessert to arrive at the Nile from the West (How did they ever walk across the Mediterranean Sea?), having an advanced civilization with a full command of navigation, textiles and metallurgy exist only within the construction sited of the pyramids, having the pyramids at Giza being build by slaves and Woolly Mammoths (there has never been any evidence of slave labor, and, I doubt that Wooly Mammoth bones have never been found at the site), having the pyramids of Giza left unfinished after the slaves destroy the advanced civilization, and, having the Sahara exist as it does today (desert) rather than as it did 12,000 years ago (tropical forest).  One must also ask the question, Why did a small band of slavers travel thousands of mile to the glacial peaks of Northern Europe to capture a handful of slaves when they had all of the Near East and North Africa at their door step?

The PQ and AQ on the Blu-Ray were stellar-close to a 5/5 for me. However the story was so preposterous and the pace so irritating that the film had few redeeming qualities aside from this. Though I am not a history scholar, I was a little unnerved by the total confusion along the timeline. I don't know if Emmerich intended to explain history on his own terms, but why horses and Mammoths and Sabertooth Tigers existed at the same time, as ""regular-looking"" horses was a bit strange. I was also a little put off by the smidgeons of humor interjected (the lead character speaking to the Tiger in the pit?).

And don't get me started on the whole, ridiculous saber-tooth tiger scenes!

The film is derivative of other (better) films including ""The Searchers"", ""King Kong"", ""The Wizard of Oz"" and dozens more; it's chock full of anachronisms and dubious history; and the story is at times unbearably cheesy, especially when the screenplay cheats the audience by using mysticism and magic to achieve contrived emotional effects (this is particularly true of the story's hokey happy ending).

And yet, despite these flaws, the film is not without its charms.  For those viewers able to suspend logic and focus simply on its visual qualities, ""10,000 BC"" offers up some splendid special effects, gorgeous art direction and set decorations, and best of all, exquisite cinematography by Ueli Steiger that truly stimulates the imagination.  I experienced the film on Blu-ray disc screened on a 60 inch 1080i monitor, and was so impressed by the lavishness of the production that I frequently forgot and forgave the vagaries of the screenplay.  This is a movie that is perfect for those nights when you want to disengage your mind, relax with a bowl of popcorn, and simply pass two hours enjoying an inconsequential spectacle that requires a minimum amount of concentration.  If you can appreciate it for what it is, and not be disappointed by what it isn't, you may very well get a kick out of ""10,000 BC"".",1250380800,,1396,4.995689655172414

 One thing that I liked about it was that I was not familiar with most of the film's cast, and their progressive character development was really excellent, which allows the viewer to get very absorbed with the story.
 The director, Roland Emmerich,and his staff really did a great techical research job of making this story quite believable, and the editing was excellent on a film that should become a cult classic someday like Star Wars, but time will tell about that.

It starts off ok, but once the story kicks in, it just goes from mess to mess. Firstly, there's no historical accuracy in any of it, not that it's TRYING to be historically accurate, but it would have been good to see them do something a little more realistic. There's no structure to the landscape or the people that live in it. The characters walk from ice mountains to amazon forests and deserts like they're in walking distance of each other. It makes no sense and became really annoying.
The people that live in the lands are also really random, from Eskimos to Africans to Egyptians [?], and just when you least expect it, one white guy too. The ""villains"" in the film make no sense either, what are they? Egyptians, Myans, Asians? it's this random mish mosh of cultures and styles that has no explanation. They also have SHIPS?..........i've never heard of any SAVAGE CAVE PEOPLE building BOATS and going across seas.

As for the visual effects, surprisingly average, i thought they'd at least get that right. There's some really obvious blue screen pasted backgrounds in the beginning, and the abnormally large Sabertooth tiger looked very cartoony.

I recently caught this howler on cable; a clunker is a clunker, but watching a clunker still beats cleaning the commode (but not by much), so I pulled up a chair and allowed the ridiculous tale that is 10,000 B.C. unfold.  A clan of hunters (and they hunt the big boys, the woolly mammoths) living in the Alps gets their prized possession (a blue-eyed chick) stolen by evil slave traders.  Led by young D'Leh (Steven Strait, who no doubt is still thanking his agent), a small group pursues; hiking only a couple of days, they're suddenly in a steamy jungle (Europe is well known for having them); hiking a couple more, they're in barren north Africa (no need to cross that pesky Mediterranean).  Magically uniting countless nomadic tribes, they assault a massive, pre-Egyptian city being constructed (by the blue-eyed chick and thousands of other slaves).  All the while, the dialogue, plot, pacing, goes from laughable, to hysterical, then back to laughable.

One thing I will say for director Roland Emmerich:  Dude can bring visuals to a movie.  There are some impressive vistas, and the CGI mammoths were equally impressive.  As for Strait, he could definitely use a good dose of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pert-Plus/dp/B0018PG2HG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pert Plus</a>.

*Spoilers*

This is a fun romp through a variety of mish-mashed primitive societies and locales - there's frozen mountainous country, fevered jungle terrains, and arid deserts of both the African and Egyptian flavors. The action starts early and stays at a decently fevered pitch; the love story is well done and never lapses into boredom.

The best part about this movie isn't really the plot but in the little extra character touches included. For once, we have a damsel in distress who remains calm and reasonably collected in the face of peril, leaves clues, and proactively swipes a knife from her captors. If we must have captive females, I admire a strong and realistic stoic-yet-hopeful attitude in said captive female. We also have African ""supporting"" characters who are allowed to outshine the ""main"" characters: the African tribes that rally in support of the hero are composed of individual, brave, witty, intelligent people, not just some token leader and a handful of grunting followers. To top it all off, we have a wise old mentor who manages to stay alive for *most* of the movie, and a missing father who (quite realistically) *stays* missing, rather than being trotted out as a Deus Ex Machina in the final act.

I enjoyed this movie partly for the front-and-center plot, but mostly for the extra touches that buck the accepted movie stereotypes that we all labor under. Don't go into it expecting a masterpiece because you won't get one, but this is a perfect way to waste a cold evening at home.

1) Nobody speaks in contractions.
2) Everybody is dirty.
3) Nobody speaks the same language except for one guy in Africa, and yet the translation of ""Mammoths"" is ""Mannak.""
4) The way to get a bull mammoth to stampede is to stand up in the middle of the herd and scream your head off.
5) Even isolated arctic tribes have tremendous racial diversity.
6) The pyramids were built either by space aliens or Atlanteans.
7) Egyptian pharaohs were white guys who spit a lot.

3328377,1,B0012Q732O,"10,000BC? The story could've been set any time any place - and has been, and has been told far, far better in many other movies. Guy loses girl; guy fights to get girl back; guy gets girl. And that's probably all the script itself said, considering the quality of acting and dialogue.

But my biggest problem with this pile of garbage is the marketing. When you look at the packaging, you see a guy going up against a monstrous saber-tooth tiger. And again on the back of the case they show this creature. You think, wow, this must be man battling the hellish monsters of old. With today's CGI that could've been so cool. Instead, the tiger is in the movie for about 60 seconds - there's no battle, the thing doesn't even bloody its claws.

Oh, there's a few mammoths that stampede, yeah. But when you compare that to the similar elements in the climax battle of Return of the King, it's an absolutely pitiful scene.

The only saving grace is the giant bird scene. If the movie could have developed along similar lines it could really have been a great movie. It's this few minutes that give it the one star, otherwise I'd have complained about not having a zero star option!

The marketing is a con. Don't be suckered. Let this garbage rot then maybe the producers will get the message and give us something decent to watch next time out.",1230422400,3,1339,4.475409836065574

I'm not going to list all of them here, but a few really stick out: 1) the stupid accents for the dreadlocked Valley people, whatever their made-up names were, 2) the dreadlocks, 3) the obviously fake blue contact lenses that Camilla Belle had to wear - they couldn't find an actress with blue eyes if it's so central to the plot? 4) Duh'bleh's (lead) father leaves at the beginning of the film to ""save his people,"" but everyone thinks he's abandoned his tribe.  It's never explained what exactly he was doing aside from leaving and why he left - HUGE plot hole.  Makes absolutely no sense other than it sets up a total BS reason for the main characters to have a way to communicate with everyone else. 5) the story in general is absurd, but everyone knows that.

I know these types of movies (on weird origins of civilization) are Emmerich's thing, but 10,000 BC is no Stargate.  It's no Day After Tomorrow either.  Worth a rent, but that's it.

PLOT: There's all these soothsayers/old people saying things about this caveman kid. And he fulfills them (by accident). He wasn't trying to fulfill prophecy, he just fell into it. That was one of the little parts I liked about the movie - the whole ""cant escape your destiny"" part. I wanted to type ""feel"" of the movie, but I couldn't - because there was no feel. So the movie, he is dumbheartedly going after this girl with impetuosity and little to no thought of the others traveling with him - that bugged me.

I also thought it was really funny when the caveman girl cried, you could see her mascara running. And we all know Waterproof L'Oreal didn't come out until 9,000 BC.

Im anti excessive CGI - you could definitely notice it with the tiger, not so much with the mammoth, and sometimes during the background scenery.

There was a hint of mysticism and that bugged me. Not because of the existence of the mysticism in the movie, but because I felt since they introduced that aspect they should have run with it and expand on that part.",1229299200,8,1375,4.558704453441296
3328383,2,B0012Q732O,"I picked up this film based largely on the previews I saw on TV, and in hopes of interesting graphics and effects. Also, director Roland Emmerich was responsible for _The Patriot_ and _Independence Day_. With a title like this one, though, I wasn't expecting much of a plot line -- so I wasn't too disappointed to discover I was correct in that regard, even if you ignore the anachronisms and treat it as a pure fantasy. Such as it is, the story turns on a classic quest: The newly chosen leader of a prehistoric tribe of mammoth hunters (out in what is probably meant to be the mountains of central Asia, or maybe it's Africa -- it's difficult to tell) has to go on an impossibly long trek with a few companions to rescue his woman, who has been kidnapped in a raid by a gang of horse-mounted slavers, who drag their captives home over mountains and deserts and through jungles, in order to put them to work building . . . something. Not a pyramid, exactly, but similar. I think. And the reason they're doing this is because they've been ordered to by some mysterious figures who are either aliens or refugees from Atlantis. Anyway, going all that way for a handful of laborers seems pretty inefficient, but the journey gives the hunter chief time to recruit an army of allies among the tribes he meets along the way. He also makes friends with a large sabertooth cat, learns about sailboats, and regrets not having invented the compass. Finally, the Good Guys reach the city of the Bad Guys, infiltrate the slave quarters, and foment a rebellion. All in all, the plot isn't bad, if you're not expecting Academy Award material, and the acting (all by actors you've never heard of, except for Omar Sharif supplying the narrative voice-over) isn't that bad. The camera work, however, sucks. So much of the film is set at night, or in dark surroundings, you'll find yourself squinting.",1228780800,,1883,4.623880597014925
3328384,4,B0012Q732O,"I was intrigued by the thought of this flick having been a fan of the Saber Tooth Tiger ever since learning about it as a kid.  Okay, the tiger is really way too big, maybe people were much smaller then but, wow, this thing was huge, but, the scenes around the mammoths and the tiger were just great, well done FX.

I had not seen many of the actors that were in this movie before, being filmed on location in New Zealand, South Africa and Namibia, this must have been a small economic boon for the latter two where obviously hundreds were given 'extra' opportunities.

I wonder though if after making the Day After Tomorrow, if the interloper being lily white has anything to do with his perspective.(?)  What the movie does include is the concept of 'the One' coming to save his people from slavery.  Instead of it being an alien race that is overlording others, it is a person who remains from others who had fled a land that had long since been destroyed.  So, the story has an apparent message or messages, but bravery and being willing to stand against tyranny is one of them.

The movie takes us from a small village on the tops of the mountains, great scenery in New Zealand, across a semi arid plain, through a tropical jungle repleat with giant birds, akin to the large bird that inhabits northern Australia and guts its prey.  However, these were like the raptors of Jurassic Park.  Even so, we go through more environments until we reach the desert.  I was fascinated by the large river in the desert that was reminiscent to the Nile or the Suez Canal ala 'Lawrence of Arabia.""

We have a story of liberation, a bit slow in places, but the graphics are very well done, the last few minutes are rather exciting as a method to get a job done.  We see the mammoths once again at the end.

If you want to watch a fantasy and like movies that have action, a story and an apparent message, this is worth it.  Omar Sharif narrates, but on the DVD you will find he was left on the cutting floor.  Actually, a couple of extra minutes and having Shariff cameoed would have been an added touch.",1228694400,,2095,4.391191709844559

We'd slipped into some ruinous territory. Bad acting. Bad story. Laughable CGI wolves. And an ending that was putrid in both the film sense and science.

But I sucked it up and decided to give Roland another shot. I'd seen some extremely cool reviews of 10,000 BC prior to deciding on this course. But I'd seen bad reviews of movies I'd turned out to love, too. Alright, Roland, this was it. I slipped the Blu-Ray disc in and braced myself...

Yikes! What the...! Was this supposed to be some sort of joke? I mean, I don't mind suspending disbelief when I watch a piece of fiction, but let's try and make it at least watchable! What was so bad, you might ask?

First is you'd have to believe that prehistoric man could build temples, navigate rivers and maybe even oceans, smelt metals (come on!), and then come home and talk romantically to the love of his life. Gimme a break!

Steven Strait (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sky-High/dp/B000J6I0VG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sky High</a>) was given the unfortunate lead role as D'Leh, a hunter-gatherer turned warrior after the woman he loves (and will marry?) is kidnapped from his village by slave traders. D'Leh sets out to get his blue-eyed Evolet (Camilla Belle) back. He and a smattering of soon-to-be-warriors strike out across unknown territory, battling sabertooth Tigers, deadly horseback riders (???), dinosaurs (????) and D'Leh's feelings of inadequacy because of his father's abandonment of him years before (Oh yes, it's THAT bad).

Okay, I do have to admit that the CGI/Blu-Ray transfer was nice. Particularly the representation of the Wooly Mammoths and the Sabertooth Tiger came across decent if over-the-top (the Sabertooth looked a tad bigger than I imagine they were).

But this movie stunk; it was lust-in-the-prehistoric-dust meets cro-Magnon-with-a-conscience. Completely ridiculous and unreal. Mr. Emmerich, you've lost me.",1228521600,4,2880,6.68716577540107

The opens in a snowy land where the guys are too stupid to wear shirts and coat themselves with mud. The girls though have been smart enough to invent bras. They also invented mascara, eyeliner, rouge and lipstick and in the beginning of the movie they have apparently been working under cars as they are greasy smudged as opposed to the mud smeared men.
""Native"" dialects soon give way to strong modern accents including more than a few who have apparently invented British inflections and the 'broken' language of 'primitives' becomes intermixed with complete grammatically correct sentences bearing $10 words.
I love the part where our hero falls into a pit trap containing a Saber-toothed tiger who apparently fell in, recovered the hole then pinned himself under a log so he couldn't move.
I still can't figure out the reasoning behind stampeding the mammoths and chasing them miles for a kill. I would have dropped one where he stood grazing so I wouldn't have to carry it all so far back home, I guess I'm just a spoiled lazy movie buff.

First off, I love Stargate so I thought the not-so-surprising resemblance in certain areas extremely amusing. Also, the story itself is not so bad. Love conquers all, good vs evil, man vs nature, conincedence vs fate--they pretty much have it all.

As for historical inaccuracies... well, really, who cares? Can we say '300'? Or any of the other hundreds of movies set in prehistoric/ancient/classical times that swerves so far from reality as to be completely unrelated? If it really bothers viewers so much, just do what I do: pretend it's somewhere else. Pretty easy, really.

I will say that the best part of this movie had nothing to do with special effects (which I thought were fairly impressive) or the acting (which... did leave something to the imagination) or the plot (yeah...), but with the music. Harold Kloser did an amazing job with this music, even if parts of it do sound strangely similar to 'The Day After Tomorrow'. Eh, who cares? There are times when I can't tell the 'Independence Day' and 'Stargate' soundtracks apart, but they are both very good.

Anyway, the movie was good and even if it isn't a I-must-have-this-movie flick, it's still good fun when your in the mood for a movie that's filled with beautiful scenery and cool prehistoric animals and Egyptian/Stargate-style sets.",1227225600,,1416,4.891666666666667

The cover is misleading because the interaction between him and the tiger was surprisingly little.

The ending to the movie is what makes this into a fantasy over having any historical value. I never expected pyramids to be anywhere near. I was sort of wondering why the writer wanted to end it that way.

Though grunts and groans would have been awkward, the writers did give other tribes in the movie distinct, yet unreconizable languages, so why couldn't they do it with the main characters also?  The 2nd flaw of the movie is the simplicity, and plain orthodoxy of the plot.

Upon checkout, the clerk asked me, ""Have you seen this film?""  I answered, ""Yes, and I really liked it.""  She shook her head and said, ""I have to agree with all the bad reviews; it's not even historically accurate.""  I don't know about the rest of you, but I grew up in the 60's and 70's and caught sci-fi movies from the 50's and 60's en masse, as well as King Kong, Godzilla and monster movies!

Along the way they eat and drink from Mars surface (and breathe as well) along with their pet Monkey, Mona.  Eventually, all three are rescued from the melting polar ice cap.

3328405,3,B0012Q732O,"I looked forward to watching this movie with great anticipation.  Unfortunately, after viewing it, I felt like I had been cheated.  I found the story somewhat difficult to follow, and I had a difficult time with the dialogue.

As for the movie's story, D'Leh (Steven Strait) is a young leader in his tribe.  Despite his father's betrayal to the tribe years ago, D'Leh has risen to a rank of leadership.  He has proven to be a fine hunter and is adept at handling a spear as well as hunting mastadons.  He has grown to love Evolet (Camilla Belle), a young, blue-eyed woman who was taken in by the tribe.  However, their dream of being together is shattered as the ""four-legged demons"" rampage through the camp and take hostages who are to become slaves in the serice of ""the Almighty"".

Throughout the film, D'Leh tracks the intruders who took his beloved Evolet.  His journey takes him from the heights of mountains to the depths of the jungle, and across the desert.  Along the way, D'Leh recruits the assistance of other peoples who have been put asunder by the almighty's minions.  Ultimately, D'Leh and his army reach the stronghold of the Almighty and his followers.  A great battle ensues, but will D'Leh and Evolet survive and finally be together?

Overall, I was somewhat disappointed with this film.  There are some very good parts, including the mastadon hunt, the race to escape from the large ostrich-like birds, and the encounter with the saber-toothed tiger.  But, unfortunately, these moments are cancelled out by many others that are not as good.  I can only give this movie an average rating.

3328412,3,B0012Q732O,"10,000 B.C. follows the character of D'Leh (Steven Strait), a member of a mountain-living tribe that makes their living from hunting mastodons.  D'Leh's father was the tribe's chief, but left the tribe and abandoned his family many years ago because of a prophecy.  D'Leh becomes an outcast.  Years later, because of his skills as a hunter and his sacrificial nature, D'Leh becomes a leader in his tribe.  The tribe is attacked by a group of warrior horsemen who take many captives, including the beautiful Evolet (Camilla Belle), D'Leh's fianc.  D'Leh sets forth on a dangerous journey south to rescue his tribemates.  His journey takes him from the plains, through the jungle, and across the desert.  He comes face to face with a saber-tooth tiger, is stalked by giant-lizard birds, and is joined by others who have lost friends and family to the invading horsemen.  Their journey culminates at Giza, Egypt.  It is there that D'Leh meets his destiny and fulfills a prophecy given years before.

The first thirty-minutes of 10, 000 B.C. moves rather slow.  Many films have a slow beginning because this is when filmmakers usually attempt to give whatever exposition they need for the story to progress.  10, 000 B.C. moves at a much slower rate than usual.  Once the exposition is set, the movie rockets forward.

I enjoyed watching 10,000 B.C.  I thought it was good for what it was, a complete mind-candy movie without any moral, message, or teachable moment.  The majority of complaints made about the film is that it is completely historical inaccurate.  I won't argue with anyone about that, but that's kind of the point of the whole movie.  The film was directed by Roland Emmerich, a director who's not known for staying true to historical accuracy or real-life plausibility.  It's just fun to watch people, mastodons, saber-toothed tigers, dinosaurs, and advanced Egyptian (alien?) technology come together in a fun, entertaining, and imaginative way on the screen.  Also, for as much action that happens in the film, one would think that the movie is not kid-friendly.  That is not the case.  10,000 B.C. is filled with action and some minor scenes of violence, but there is no gushing blood, no foul language, and no sex.

Then I realized it was directed by Roland Emmerich, the genius behind such classic travesties such as Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow.  Still, I remained undeterred.  CAVEMEN!  DINOSAURS!  Finally untethered from the shackles of fact, they were going to do glorious battle!  How can you possibly mess that up?  That's a question only Mr. Emmerich can answer, because he messed it up like a professional disaster.  In the end, the movie was too long and ACTUALLY BORING.  When you have no real intentions on making a quality movie about real characters, please don't spend time trying to developing.  That's like planting a rock in a ground and watering it and telling people it's going to grow into a beautiful tree.

3328415,5,B0012Q732O,"10,000 BC is an imaginative interpretation of the past that connects us to who we are today.  It is timeless mythology that could be told to hunter and gathers around a camp fire, and also touch our human yearning for mythology today.  Our need for mythology has not changed in 12,000 years.  We are basically the same humans.

 10,000 BC celebrates the beautiful social bonding humans have with each other, and says this quality is really what makes us civilized.  It completely made me rethink what we typically call an ""advanced"" civilization.  Does ""advanced"" mean technology, mathematics, and great architectural achievements?  Or is what truly makes us advanced is how we love our families, friends, and villagers, and how we can work together, using this social bonding to give us meaning?  It made me rethink respect for the Egyptian civilization and the great pyramids.  If you think about it, the pyramids are great accomplishment of human stupidity.  What ""great"" civilization would expend huge amounts of human effort to build enormous, pointless structures?  Was the Egyptian civilization really a totalitarian social structure that relied on huge amounts of slaves to carry out the religious wishes of the minority?  The next time you think ""wow"" about the Egyptian civilization, think about the probable human rights vialoations needed to build the pyramids, then your ""wow"" might change to ""yuk"".

 D,Ley grows into the hero in this epic story.  At first, he really just wants to save his girl.  Romantic love is his basic drive.  As his journey unfolds, he learns of his father.  He learns his father was a great man that allowed his people to believe he was a coward just so he could keep his struggling tribe together.  D,Ley's first attempt to rescue his girl Evolet shows lack of experience and impatience.  Tic'Tic, an older and wiser hunter, and friend of D,Ley's father, takes the time to pass his wisdom to D,Ley.  He teaches D,Ley some men take on a circle of responsibility that encloses many people.  When D,Ley has achieved full hero status, he leads thousands from various cultures to ""take them down"".  Joseph Campbell would have loved it.

 There is also something about 10,000 BC that is genius.  10,000 BC turns mythology inside out and shows how myth is intertwined with prophecy.  Tic'Tic teaches prophecy can be fulfilled in many ways.  Prophecy is what aids our hero.  Without the prophecy, D,Ley could not have gathered such an army, and could not have exploited the weakness of the Almighty.  D'Ley fulfills these prophecies because people want to see them fulfilled.  When you watch 10,000 BC, you are watching the mythology unfold in all its accidental luck but ultimately fueled by our greater human qualities.  Qualities such as love, friendship, loyalty, courage, respect, and honor is the real driving force, not prophecy.  These qualities are really what makes our hero and his people the more advanced civilization.  When you watch 10,000 BC, you may not realize it, but you become a participant of mythology.  Your very own yearning for great, meaningful story telling is awakened.  The alternate ending shows the narator concluding the story to a future generation.  I'm thinking they should have stuck with that ending to bring home the fact you are watching a fictionalized story packaged as a handed down myth.  This would have helped some people ""get"" this movie.  It justifies why the saber-tooth tiger was so big.  It's a story.  Stories exaggerate for effect.

 Many people have criticized 10,000 BC as being historically a farce.  Well, watch the bonus material on the blu-ray about the book ""Fingerprints of the Gods"" by Graham Hancock.  Hancock is interviewed and talks about maps found showing land mass before the ice age in their predicted location given continental drift.  This is a complete unaddressed mystery.  It suggests there were advanced civilizations way earlier than 2,500 BC.  So ""10,000 BC"" takes some liberty on a possibility for this mystery.  We don't know everything about our past.  But what makes ""10,000 BC"" so great is that it helps us realize to understand the value of our current civilization, we need to understand our fundamental nature as hunter and gathers.  Our basic social instincts come from living in small groups.  A civilization that drifts too far from our social origins will eventually fall, as many ""advanced"" civilization in the past have.",1220227200,6,4443,5.031593406593407

And that cool tiger on the poster had me expecting some great special effects.

Well, the special effects were very good.  And the score was good at times too, though it did seem over-done after a while with very few softer parts.  But that's where the good ends.

For starters, this movie really made me resent the over-use of narration in movies.  When you watch the deleted scenes and alternate ending, it's clear the narrator was telling the story to the next generation.  Yet the final cut of this movie doesn't let you see that.  It didn't really matter though, because I found myself alternately wondering ""is this just a little over-dramatic"" and ""they spoke english with a British accent in 10000 BC?""

And of course the historical inaccuracies were unavoidable.  I understand some want to give them a pass on that, but then they shouldn't have named this after a year.  Apparantly, all white people had dreadlocks 10000 BC.  And all the races of the world were within a few days walk of each other too.  Still,  I can accept a movie as a work of fantasy except when the story is weak.  And the story is very weak.

The movie starts off with cheesy prophecies and the young hero speaking way more seriously than a kid could about ""eternal love"" in his heart. Never mind, everything that happens was in a prophecy.  And oh yeah, no matter where this guy walks everybody knew his father. In fact, the entire story line is unbelievable even as a fantasy movie because it's inconsistent with itself.  It gets funny fast.

Other than the aforementioned deleted scenes and alternate ending, there's no special features to speak of.  Some of those scenes have some incomplete CG sequences that made me laugh too.

If you are not too critical, sure you can enjoy this.  But there are just too many better movies to watch to really go out of your way to see this.  Wait for it to play on cable.

We have a young girl with blue eyes taken in by a primitive tribe.  They have a prophecy that she and one of their warriors will save their people.  And until she is kidnapped by four legged demons (men on horses) all the viewer gets is the narrator talking and the men hunting.  That's it.  While ""Clan"" was based on a heavily researched book, with an engaging heroine and interesting historical details, ""BC"" is a hodgepodge of history and the narrator doesn't have anything vital to reveal.  I agree with the reviewer who felt there should be more sex and violence befitting such a savage time.  Normally, I don't care for gratuitous sex or violence but in this instance I heartily agree.  Something needed to jump start this film.  After the kidnapping, things didn't pick up much either.  Our hero goes after her and we follow the three men tracking them for far too long.  Along the way, our hero runs into a tribe of african people, who happily form an army for him since he fulfills one of their prophecies, and the climax is all set up. Finally, the film starts moving along, only viewers will feel like they are suddenly watching Stargate.

The hero arrives at a huge construction site by the river.  Many thousands of slaves are building a pyramid for ""The Almighty,"" a mysterious figure attended by robed men and young boys - just like Ra in Stargate.  Even his building and chambers look like Ra's!  And he'll face defeat from a primitive people to boot.  And guess what?  The Almighty has a prophecy that a Hunter with a mark will come to destroy him!  Despite the total lack of originality, and yet another prophecy, the very predictable ending still managed to make the movie worth watching.  A stampede of Mammoths, thousands of extras, lots of fighting, and a triumph of good over evil are always attention grabbing.  And, I just love a happy ending.

Overall, this movie could have been so much better if they had cut out the boring overview of the tribe in the beginning in favor of more information about The Almighty.  We never learn where he came from, how he took control, nothing.  He was far more interesting a character than the hero, and he didn't get much screen time.  Still, if you're looking for a movie to pass the time, this wasn't bad.  But, I'd recommend renting it.",1218585600,46,3419,5.48565965583174

His journey will take him to foreign lands where he will meet exotic peoples, frightening creatures, and mysterious cultures.

There are slight hints of Conan, Mad Max, the Last of the Mohicans, and Jurassic Park, and strong/obvious elements of Quest for Fire, Mel Gibson's Apokalypto, and most importantly Stargate.

The major setbacks are in relation to:
1) The movie starting off slow and failing to catch the viewer's attention.
2) Very little accuracy regarding the human civilization of that era.
3) The movie should have included sex and violence for the sake of realism and not a mellowed down version of the era in order to sell more tickets.
4) The acting is mediocre and it seems as though the chemistry between the actors is not all that great.
5) To that, one has to add the poor dialogues and the bad choice of lines that the actors are given.
6) As for the characters, they are weak, bland and just plain uninteresting.

In short, the acting and the music are mediocre, the setting is great, the plot is interesting though predictable and unoriginal (could have been amazing!), while the dialogues are `below average.'

I'd recommend it on Blu-ray rather than DVD if you watch it over a large enough screen, as it is mostly a visual story. There are epic battle scenes (an Emmerich  speciality), but I think the movie goes beyond that.
Also there are more efficient top notch image blu-rays (Planet Earth series, Pixars, etc.).

The main characters speak english in the movie.  There was another language in the movie used by the African tribes, but I'm not sure if the language was real.  It doesn't matter really because the movie makers translated.

My favorite character was the teenage boy.  He wasn't the lead character, and I don't know his name.  But his mother died in the movie, and he followed the heros on their quest, joining them later.  He had no one, and I think he was brave and stronger than they thought he was.

(*NOTE* Some SPOILERS)

A simple tribe of prehistoric hunters finds its way of life threatened when attacked by ""four-legged demons."" Homes are burned and people taken to lands unknown. The village's best hunters take off in pursuit, becoming, as the narrator says, hunters no longer, but warriors.

D'Leh, the lead character played by Steven Strait, is determined to rescue Evolet, the love of his life, along with the other hunters who were taken from the tribe, and without whom the people will starve. Thrust into the unasked-for role of Hero, D'Leh leads an army of many tribes to liberate thousands of captives-now slaves.

Visually, this is a decent film. CG effects are well blended with the action, and the cast acted out their roles in an acceptable manner. That said, this movie left a lot to be desired. The plot is based on a tired storyline with predictable turns: Hero's village is attacked; Hero must rescue people; Hero displays special ability or fits prophecy; Hero faces danger; Hero wins, with minimal losses.

One thing that annoyed me was that D'Leh seemed to care more about getting his girl back than anything else around him. He pulls it out in the end and even manages to care, but until that point, he is very one-dimensional.

Hollywood loves its beasties. The production team behind 10,000 B.C. is no exception, with massive prehistoric monstrosities, which was the most impressive part of the movie. Mastodons (""Mannak""), a saber-toothed tiger (""Spear Tooth""), and a herd of two-story carnivorous emu-like birds provide some action-oriented eye candy. Other than that, however, the entire movies comes off flat.

It's not horrible, but it's not great. If you have Netflix, go for it. Is it worth buying a copy? Not on my dime.

While it's enjoyable enough to watch, ""B.C."" just doesn't feel like the grand epic it should be.  It has all the necessary ingredients to be an epic:  an unlikely hero, a beautiful damsel (and tribe) in distress, a menacing enemy with seemingly supernatural powers, an angry god/ruler and gigantic roadblocks for the hero.  Despite having all of these components, though, it just doesn't click as an epic.

Steven Strait's portrayal of the hero, D'leh, is sufficient, but I never felt that he truly took charge of the adventure.  Camilla Belle's role as the blue-eyed love interest has a ton of potential, but she's relegated to a lot of long looks (with emphasis on the eyes, of course) into valleys, fearful looks into the general direction of a god, and a couple of weak attempts at taking matters into her own hands.  The most interesting character of the lot was, to me, Nathanael Baring's portrayal of Baku.  The rest of the cast, though gamely played, never really interested me that much.

Granted, the mammoths, giant birds and (somewhat fake-looking) sabertooth tiger were fun to watch and the final battle was nothing short of grand, but the overall feel of this film was ho-hum.

As far as the DVD is concerned, the film looks wonderful.  The special features include some deleted scenes and an alternate ending that, in my opinion, works better than the one actually used in the film.

Would I recommend it as a purchase?  Probably not.  While it's an okay film, there's just nothing about it that makes it very special.  If it comes on television, be sure to watch it unless there's a football game on or one of Emmerich's other films.

This was a fantastic movie!
In defense of the historical aspects of the film: I applaud the writers and directors for giving us a better view of civilization in ancient times than what we are used to. We are not often told that Homo Sapien has existed in its exact form since 250,000 B.C. Same brain size, same body size, same ability to reason, same capacity to love. Pick up a history book and prove it to yourself. Amazon has thousands of them! They were masters of the world they lived in at the time, like we are masters of the world we live in today. Historically, this film is more accurate than inaccurate. Put aside the presupposition that the pyramids were built around 2500 B.C. according to our accepted historical time-line and what you have is a wealth of imagery describing how we hunted the mammoth, how we captured the saber tooth tiger and how we were hunted and eaten by downgraded dinosaurs in the form of giant birds!
Is it conceivable that racism didn't exist between the dark skinned tribes of the African savannah and the pale skinned men of the mountains? Or did they wonder at each other? Dreams and visions are often mentioned in ancient literature as belonging to the most sacred member of a tribe. It's Shaman, mystic, medicine man, etc! These people busied themselves with knowledge and wisdom while everyone else in the clan had their purpose and goals. Wouldn't you want to see how they might have lived, created, communicated, learned, stood together side by side united for a cause and died for what they believed in! And how appropriate that this work is a love story! No one can deny that as a race, man's awareness to love spans the ages, knows no limit and sets us apart from animal instinct!
I can understand how those who are not fans of ancient history can sit back and wonder why the dumb cave man isn't poking sticks into an anthill to eat the ants but the reality is, that cave man is you without technology! Could you hunt the African elephant without a rifle? Could you feed you family without a grocery store? Would you travel hundreds of miles on foot? Ancients were not dumb! They were brilliant at surviving and learning how to control their environment, or we would not be here today.
Most of what we think we know of ancient history is merely a lot of guesswork anyway. Compared to the complexity of human life, facts from these times are limited. The filmmakers have put together an incredible interpretation based on a mixture of fact, guesswork and pure fantasy! You want a documentary watch the history channel, you want a good story see this movie.",1217289600,7,2733,4.602459016393443

Slightly before 10,000 BC...I guess; a small tribe resides in mountains somewhere. Old Mother, the tribe's profit, has a prophecy when the tribe finds a small blue eyed girl in the arms of a dead woman near their camp. The prophecy tells of four legged demons who will come to end their way of life which is already starting to crack as the mannicks (Woolly Mammoth) from which the tribe gets much of it's food and leather have begun to come later and later with each passing year. Most believe the prophecy but one man doesn't and he sets off to find an answer to the tribe's problem leaving his son behind. Fast forward to 10,000 BC, the four legged demons arrive and capture much of the tribe. The remaining members set off to rescue the members of the tribe with D'Leh at the head of the group motivated to rescue his woman the blue eyed girl...

If popcorn flicks with poor plots, acting, dialogue and special effects are for you, then you have found your line of entertainment for the next 109 minutes.

The Good: There are very few bright points in this dud of a flick. The movie doesn't lack for action and fight scenes which are up to par for the caliber of this movie. The lead girl is kind of hot in a ""Cave woman"" type of way, so theres that.

The Bad: I don't know when the continental shift took place but it would appear that the creators of this movie believe it took place sometime after 10,000 BC. Our hero and his band set off from mountains that look like something you would expect to see in Europe and then traverse rather quickly into something that looks very much like a rain forest then immediately traverse into the desert. I looked at an atlas after viewing this and just can't seem to find the path our band of adventurers took to reach their final destination.

The dialogue in this is absolutely horrid, and the plot and way the story unfolds is ludicrous. All of the action in the movie feels very inserted like the producers were sitting around going over the script and said ""Alright, it's been 5 pages without an action beat, what can we add here?"" I could go on and on but, a poor plot, poor dialogue, and a lack of logic make something that could have been a mediocre movie into a sub par one.

Overall: There are so many ways to better spend 109 minutes than watching ""10,000 BC"".  Pass on ""10,000 BC"" if at all possible.",1217203200,6,2415,4.401345291479821

It's like after doing 'The Day After Tomorrow' he went ""Wow, they actually bought that; why even bother with a story, they'll buy anything!!!""  Do these big hot shot movie executives really think that we as Americans are really this stupid?  Maybe we are, maybe we deserve this kind of garbage on our silver screens & maybe that's how we put bUSH in the White House for eight excruciatingly long years.  Oh, and can we please officially put the kibosh on Miss Camilla ""Bushy Brow"" Belle's career now?

3328533,1,B0012Q732O,"Why does this movie suck so much?

Because it is stupid as hell. And boring and very unoriginal. I'm kinda tired of people saying that a movie like this is just for fun, blah, blah, blah. Of coarse it is. My idea of fun can include -and very often does- the improbable and fantastic. It's when it is done in ways that don't make any sense and aren't interesting or original that I think a movie sucks and deserves 1 star on Amazon. (Actually I don't care as much about stuff making a whole lot of sense if it's interesting and entertaining and smart. Ex. the plot of Hellboy 2) When you call the movie 10,000 B.C., I don't know, I just sort of assume that part of the idea is to have a movie set on Earth about 10,000 years ago about prehistoric people. That sounds interesting except they gave the middle finger to not only good, exciting story telling but trying to portray what the world 10,000 years ago was actually like. If you want to do a fantasy world call it Middle Earth or something. The movie is screwy in multiple ways: right next to a frozen mountain range ice age environment lies a lush tropical jungle which borders a vast desert; the silly accents and tribes and a completely fictional civilization that is part rip off of ancient Egypt and the Persian Empire as depicted in ""300""; an absurd plot -it's like a dull highchool kid read some Joseph Campbell and this is his first effort at script writing (maybe not too much worse than George Lucas); bad dialogue; bad editing; etc. I can chill and let somethings slide if it all overall works. It doesn't. Sadly, most Americans would probably consider it more or less accurate and a pretty good movie.. The general public has a very low standard for what counts as a good movie.

I found the flawed but fascinating ""Quest for Fire"" to be very well done and better worth your time if you feel like watching a story about cavemen. They didn't even have a huge budget and CG animals! And Ron Perlman plays a caveman. He required no makeup for the part.",1216166400,13,2016,4.416666666666667

The story was all over the place and there were many flaws to be had. I am not talking about flaws in history.  None of us were alive then, so nobody knows what it was like anyway. A few of the special effects were done horribly.  The sabertooth was obviously fake. The golden pyramid tip falling down looked very fake.

Another flaw in the story was the giant birds. The one guy gets attacked and even injured, but when whats his name returns, the guy is still alive.  So everyone is dead and eaten except for him.  So what? His bird got full and gave up?

Did anyone notice how well groomed these ""cave men"" were.  If you pay very good attention, did anyone notice that the women had shaved legs and arm-pits?  Wow, didn't ever think they would shave those things way back when.  I so hate when the film makers do not pay attention to detail.

I don't know. We watch a lot of movies and usually find the good in even the bad ones. This one has nothing good. We were never so bored in our lives waiting for something to happen. We got the blu-ray version and it really doesn't look all that good compared to other movies.

I picked it up hoping it would have some semblance to human history, and see how the director had visualized a time about twelve thousand years ago. This movie has nothing to do with history. I am not an expert but 12,000 ago years humans were in the stone age (at least accoring to wiki) - there were no metal spear heads, saber-tooth cats were nowhere as large as they are depicted. The geographic location is not clear - where they in Africa, or Europe? The characters seem racially diverse - how did such mingling happen so long ago? And there were definitely no large Egyptian-structures built that long ago.
Well, ok. So, you stretch your imagination - maybe a civilization did exist that got wiped out. But first the movie seems a rip-off of so many others - Gibson's Apocalypto foremost, a bit of Jurassic Park and some others. Then, the dialogs appear very discontinuous - maybe an amateur screenplay writer? And finally, the storyline is very weak - sometimes it makes you feel that the story was just made along.
The CGI animation was not too bad as some reviewers said - about the same standard as King Kong, but less slick. There is violence, but far less gore than apocalypto.

3328563,1,B0012Q732O,"Recently, the category of politically-biased action films is growing exponentially.  Some are right-wing (Lord of the Rings), some are left-wing (Lions for Lambs), some are pro-Christian (Narnia), some are pro-integration, some are anti, some want more funding in Congress to save the environment (The Day After Tomorrow), etc...  It's getting harder and harder to find films without an agenda, for the purposes of pure entertainment (like Ocean's 13, for example).  This one has such an obvious message, and such a negligible and linear plot, that a child can figure it out. Even the actors can tell that this film is a racket, judging by their minimum effort. Here goes:  The good guys, all look Middle-Eastern and African.  The corrupt dictator is white.  The eunuch minions serve the corrupt dictator, in a way designed to make them look like pro-west Arab leaders.  The tiger in the plot, obviously symbolizes China. ('The Great Tiger' being it's nickname, even though it's not it's National Animal). The leading man, becomes the hero when he liberates the tiger and the tiger in turn doesn't eat him, but is grateful instead. Finally, the wooly-mammoths are the good-guys' most precious resource, being exploited by the corrupt dictator to build his great pyramids.  Obviously, the mammoths represent OIL and the pyramids represent THE WEST.  So here is the subconscious plot:  This film is designed to empower the Middle East and Africa to sell their oil to China, and to not be afraid of deposing pro-west governments (symbolized, again, by the Anglo-looking, illegitimate demigod).  It would be interesting to ""follow the money"" and see exactly who the hell paid for this lump of crap, and who and why wrote the script. One thing is certain:  It reeks of Chinese-intel psy-ops.  Typical Marxist/Maoist propaganda to create class-struggles along racial lines, much like Soviet propaganda in Latin America during the Cold War.  Of course, the film is 'coincidentally' released when Iraq is gearing up to (finally) hand-out oil contracts. The fact they got a good director is beyond me, but I suspect that 'money is money'.

Well, no movie is accurate to history simply because we weren't there, we'll never know, and half to writing history is covering up the truth.  So stop whining about it you fools, nothing is EVER going to be accurate.  Not only that but it was totally obvious from the commercials this wouldn't be an accurate movie, let alone the fact that its made by Ranold or whatever his name is that made bloody GODZILLA, or INDEPENDENCE DAY.

Here is a good summary for many retards and their moronic comments on various topics.  I found this from a commentor named Adam:
As for the cavemen speaking English, this is simple. 1) They weren't cave men, they lived in huts. This denotes some sort of movement to an agricultural based society. This is further given proof by the fact that they WAIT for the herd of mammoths to come; they don't follow them like nomadic hunters would. 2) The answer to the English is very simple. They didn't speak English. How did you not pick up on this fact? Whenever they went to other areas the new people spoke in a different language, THEN they switched to English. This was done so the entire movie wouldn't be in subtitles like Apocalypto.
Well put Adam.

But aside from that people are right, everything in this was boring.  Dialogue, interactions, characters, story, everything was totally boring.  There was virtually no saber-tooth tiger in the entire movie, maybe like 2 minutes worth, which was a real bummer.  He looked badarse.

CGI was great, though its all in the eye of the beholder, no hard fact saying its great or not.  I liked it.

The war and action scenes in Chronicles of Narnia, The Witch...Wardrobe, a movie for children, is far superior to the action scenes in this movie. The most conspicuous fault in the movie was the construction of the Pyramids which is historically inaccurate.

Many of you who are planning to watch the movie only for the special effects (just as I did) are also going to be disappointed because there are not a lot of them.

This is actually a decent family Summer movie. There is no bad language or sex, but some normal fighting violence. Even the violence is not the typical grossly spatter everyone with blood. I found the movie entertaining and the acting was actually pretty good. I would have given it three and a half stars if I could of and I even considered four stars. In fact with a bit more money this might have rivaled ""Apocalypto"". This may not have had the budget or directing capability of such a movie, but rating it with typical B movies like ""One Million Years B. C."", with Raquel Welch, is ridiculous. Don't get me wrong I found even that one fun to watch. But this is far more entertaining than most caveman movies I have seen before, even if it is not entirely historically accurate. Considering recent discoveries about cavemen though this is not as far fetched as some would have you believe.

The story centers around a prophecy of a man that is a hunter who speaks with a spear tooth (Sabertooth Tiger) leading people to their freedom. We see this man from childhood along with several others so we don't instantly know for sure who our hero will be. As a young boy he meets a beautiful blue eyed girl that was found by his tribe. They are linked from then on as he does everything he can to ensure her safety and make her his woman. The story, acting, directing, camera work, music, sets, and effects are reasonably good. The scenery is a key part as they travel from snow covered mountains through desert and jungle. The exceptional photography makes it stand out in detail.

Never were there wooly mammoth sized pauses or unnecessary delays in the story or action. (Thanks to 'Independence Day' director Roland Emmerich and editor Alexander Berner.) Visually, the action is well framed and expertly shot.  They may have taken liberties with history, but we're not really supposed to care.  Giant ostriches and saber tooth tigers?  Well, I thought man wasn't as well developed by then and animal evolution was far behind, but the movie isn't  pretentious (well, okay, except maybe the title); it's an adventure meant to entertain.  We even reach a well-developed civilization by then, far beyond cave man culture.

The plot is about as simple as the people who fill the screen.  O'Leh (Steven Strait) is the Beowulf of cavemen times.  He must rescue his woman, Evolet (Camilla Belle), and free his people while repairing the reputation of his allegedly cowardly father.  (I guess chivalry didn't start in medieval times after all.)  His companions, like Tic'Tic (Cliff Curtis) provide more conflict and tension to the story, and, in the prehistoric fray are visions and visionaries (like Old Woman) who forecast the future and give advice.  Most warriors rely on signs and wonders rather than on primitive compasses.  Customs bind them all, and a handle on nature is the key to tribal success.

Compared to other cave men movies, this one is ahead by every frame.  Wisely, we mostly get people talking in our own language without all the ""Ugh's"" and grunts of past early man movies.  I can't emphasize enough how beautiful the scenes are shot as the tribe whizzes through snowy mountains, endless jungles, and vast deserts.  As dangers come before them, the menace is close to the camera and harrowing to watch.

Don't expect the film to be the next `Jurassic Park' or as intense as '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mel-Gibson-s-Apocalypto-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000NOKFHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mel Gibson's Apocalypto (Widescreen Edition)</a>' or '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/300-Full-Screen-Edition/dp/B000QXDEDG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">300 (Full Screen Edition)</a>,' but if you want a movie that gives you something to look at for nearly two hours and never lets up, '10,000 B.C.' is essential viewing.

3328639,5,B0012Q732O,"The film _10,000 B.C._ (2008) directed by Roland Emmerich is an excellent film set in prehistoric times with a unique and panoramic vision.  I think the film is very likely influenced by the writings of fantasy action writer Robert E. Howard and certainly bears resemblance to the Conan films.  The film takes place in prehistoric times when mammoths, saber-toothed cats, and giant birds roamed the landscape and men lived a simple hunter-gatherer type existence in the central Eurasian mountains (probably taking some liberty with actual historical fact of course).  The film focuses on the Yagahl tribe who live in harmony with nature hunting mammoths.  Two important characters from this tribe will serve as the central protagonists for the story - the young hunter D'Leh and the beautiful Evolet.  In addition, the old mother, a shaman woman of the Yagahl tribe, plays a central role in the story.  One day while hunting the mammoth, a group of warlords manage to kidnap Evolet and the young hunter must pursue them across the Levant in his effort to save her.  However, after passing through many terrors, the hunter and his band of warriors encounter an evil civilization where they must work as slaves building great pyramids for ""the Almighty"", a mysterious god-man who controls the slaves and for whom they must pay constant tribute.  ""The Almighty"" demands that one of their own must be sacrificed to show the slaves that they must work harder for him.  Ultimately, it is D'Leh who must lead the slaves in a rebellion against this evil man worshipped as a god and in an effort to rescue his love Evolet.  Unfortunately, Evolet bears a mark upon her hand which shows her to be one of great power which ""the Almighty"" fears.  In a fitting end, the noble D'Leh leads his people and the other slave peoples in a glorious revolt against the wicked masters.  The masters show themselves to be cowards as they beg before their god ""the Almighty"".  However, D'Leh manages to throw a spear piercing ""the Almighty"" and thus killing him proving once and for all that he was no god but a mere mortal and evil man.  Sic semper tyrannis!  The slaves escape their masters, but first a last challenge must be faced by D'Leh and Evolet, and oddly the role of the old mother is to play an important part here.  Thus, ends this film.

It was entertaining in a mindless, drooling sort of way and the effects were good enough to keep me borderline conscious from start to finish. The geography in this thing was seriously confused, to say the least. The main characters, apparently northern European mammoth hunters, cross a mountain range which appears to be the Alps, emerging in sub-Saharan Africa, at which point they head back across the desert to find themselves in Egypt, where woolly mammoths are being used to build the pyramids. Now, I'm too lazy to actually look this up, but I was under the impression that there were no mammoths in Ancient Egypt and everybody knows that shape-shifting reptilian aliens actually built the pyramids, not that it really matters. I don't want to give away the plot, so I'll just say that it's basically the same as Apocalypto, a truly great movie, proving once again that no concept is immune to recycling by midgets. The grand finale of 10,000 BC is almost as stupid as the ending of the TV version of The Stand, one of the dumbest scenes ever filmed, but the body count was high enough to keep me amused for a couple of hours, so I'll give it a five stars.

He painted flowers of all colors only to be corrected by the teacher who taught him flowers are red and green and that's the only way they should be painted. The little boy moved to a new school where the students were painting flowers in a rainbow of colors but the little boy now only painted flowers green and red. I thought about this song while I read the negative reviews. 2 and a half stars? Seriously? What were you expecting? A National Geo documentary or something? History Channel maybe? The movie does not try to pass itself off as history, it's just a fantasy movie. A Romance / Quest / Adventure / Fantasy movie and that's all. Who cares if the actors had british accents or not? Maybe they could have spoken caveman and we could have read the whole movie in subtitles. Who cares if mammoths didn't live in Egypt, or at least some place that reminded one of Egypt? There are no such things as invisible goblins and stuff but I still liked the spiderwick chronicles. Was it boring? Well, it was not non stop action to be sure but it wasn't boring either. At least blood and gore wasn't relied on to carry the story line. If you like fantasy movies, and you don't mind suspending belief in reality for the duration of a movie, you will most probably like this movie. It had a good ending and I thought was well done.

I love campy shows like Xena: Warrior Princess, Sheena, Baywatch, classic cartoon Masters of the Universe, and Cleopatra 2525.

3328711,3,B0012Q732O,"Coming off some rather poor reviews, I expected failure from this movie, and the first ten minutes delivered all the fail I anticipated. After that, it drastically improved, and while it didn't succeed as an epic, it was very lively and highly imaginative.

Starting with the bad, most of the dialogue just plain sucks. It's great that they tried to make the people sound simple, being this is 10,000 BC, but the kids (D'leh and Evolet) had these really painfully Arab-esque accents and awkward dialogue reminiscent of Attack of the Clones Padme and Anakin. The dumb little kid who follows the hunters also is an embarrassing addition, but thankfully his dialogue is limited.

The minor characters, such as the English-speaking African chief, are the only characters who really shine with their simplistic dialogue, and even D'leh sometimes narrowly misses having his lines crumble to sheer stupidity.

Also a major detractment is the narrator, who is mostly completely un-needed save to further some events. Other times, we really don't need to hear him, such as the very end when the Old Mother supposedly 'breathes life' into Evolet. The images showed this clearly enough without needless narration.

In the beginning, the special effects are rather poor, as you can very clearly see that a character doesn't fit in the background environment, as if they were filmed in front of a green screen, and then attempts at digitally removing the green glare only smeared the picture.

Also, it was clearly not necessary to have the ice people of D'leh speak English, as they are the only English-speaking tribe in the movie, and it would have far better served the atmosphere to have them speaking a more primitive language, with more hand and facial gestures than verbosity.

The action sequences, costumes, cinematography, and sets were spectacular, and managed to tell the greater story (oppressed tribes banding together to overthrow a tyrant) in a way that far supersedes the main individual story of D'leh trying to save Evolet, though from the prophetic viewpoint, it was interesting how they twisted the two together, having it be that only D'leh's desire to save Evolet could make him lead the tribes to freedom. To sum, the movie succeeds in macro-storytelling, but fails in micro-storytelling.

As for the historical accuracy... it's very imaginative. And it requires you to use your imagination to explain certain things.

For one, the pyramids in what is clearly Egypt. I thought it was a great explanation to show them using Mammoths to pull their limestone (since even today historians are marveled at how they could have pulled such stones with manpower alone), and though the first pyramids were built some 7,000 years after this movie takes place, the movie makes sure that it is left open to interpretation.

What? The pyramids are barely half-way completed in the movie, and the slaves and tribes revolt against their ruler (a tall, godlike figure who must maintain his illusion of divinity to a point of never being seen; his personal slaves are all blind), leaving the pyramids incomplete. You could easily imagine that the pyramids could left incomplete for thousands of years, before a civilization known to us as the Egyptians of hieroglyphs and mummies worked to complete them. Sands could have eroded the pyramids, covering them up completely, or who knows? The movie doesn't definitively say the pyramids were built in 10,000 BC: only that they were begun, and presumably not completed by the original builders.

In all, it's a beautifully done movie, which suffers from poor micro-storytelling. If the total story were in the forefront, and the love story reduced to a subplot, I think it would have been a far better movie.",1214524800,2,3749,5.051779935275081

It may or may not be on the mark about Mammoths, Saber Tooth, and Man-eating birds, but this was twelve millenniums ago.  Can anyone watching this movie state with any first hand experience what our ancient ancestors did or did not see or do?

This is about entertainment, not historical fact.  The story line is appealing, the acting is far better than what most of the anti-BC crowd states and the cinematography is very good.  So what is the big fuss? I have seen the Hulk and Iron Man recently and there are horrible flaws in riddling both films, yet where is all the criticism of these films?

It started off fine with a Eurasian hunter/ gather clad in an Ice Age period of 11,000BC chasing woolly mammoths. Strangely a raiding clan that looked like they were from the Iron Age (with metal) or even the Persian Empire plundered the small tribe like in Pathfinder. After that, things just doesn't make any senses anymore, nor was the acting very intriguing. Camilla Bell the main attraction was almost speechless and acted like in ""the Quiet"" where she played deaf. The lead character happen to wondered upon some prehistoric Terror Bird from 62-2 million years ago. Maybe there were saber-tooth tiger in the desert of African right by the Pyramid. Or somehow slave woolly mammoth were used to help build the pyramid. I believed the first Egyptian's Pyramid was built in 2600bc way later. We can forgive the movie for the bad science if the characters were more interesting or believiable, but they weren't. Why weren't there any sloth in this movie.

This is a pointless movie that took elements from other great movies and decided the timeline that would fit all this mess is 10,000BC.

Apocalypto - better pyramid slavery movie. Pathfinder- better raiding clan movie. This isn't a very good caveman movie either. Ice Age I and II had better human to animal interaction/relationship. Gladiators had better acting then this. The Geiko's Cavemen are a lot funnier then this. Being in the desert seem more agonizing in Passions of the Christ then this movie.

The main actors deliver for the genre: Steven Strait- muscular, ruggedly handsome, angst; Camilla Belle- beautiful, wistful, longing, angst.  The evil guys evil.

The downers: the story's a bit hokey and, of course, it's predictable. And the romance could be richer.

Clearly, these 'lifts' are something for the Writer's Guild of America to muse over, but for a non-discriminating viewer, the film is an acceptable time-passer, if no classic.

The story, surprisingly, is often a bit flat, although the CGI mastodons, man-eating ostriches, and a saber-tooth tiger are fun (if not particularly believable). As is frequently the case in these tales (at least since ""Conan the Barbarian""), prehistoric humans were so hardy that they could survive near-Arctic cold in a minimum of clothing, were so unfamiliar with horses and boats that they referred to them as ""four-legged monsters"" and ""big birds"", yet had mastered engineering to a point where they were creating spectacular structures rivaling modern Las Vegas at it's gaudiest. The logic of all this escapes me, but Emmerich is a master of ""don't think, just watch"" storytelling, and makes it all work.

With bloodless battles, little romance (other than talk), and clearly-defined 'good guys' and 'bad guys', this is a film you can view with the entire family, which is a plus, these days!

For me the most fascinating aspects of the film were the inclusion of pyramids and the beginnings of the Sphinx emerging from the sand. Further enhanced by the mention of rulers coming from the stars, or arriving from a sinking continent (i.e.: Altantis) there were definitely strong hints of a `Stargate' type ending on the horizon. From a personal perspective I believe the writers missed a great opportunity by not exploring the mythic and extraterrestrial aspects further.

Let me be honest when I tell you that it is what it may have appeared, it is the typical Emmerich piece and it lacks serious depth and contains some terrible acting along with ridiculous dialogue. At times the CGI simply doesn't blend into what's actually taking place, during a scene where one of the tribesmen is running with a hoard of Mammoth there are parts where you clearly see that when one of the men is looking up at the Mammoth, you clearly see he's looking in the wrong direction and mistakes like this occur during the entire movie constantly ruining the illusion. With these mistakes however it's not to say that this is the worst film I've ever seen as, at times it is a very exciting picture and something that can entertain you for the runtime duration, the CGI although with the mistakes is impressive and does have your imagination running wild, which I guess is a good point.

The story is of an ancient Eurasian mountain tribe known as the Yaghal who in order to survive must hunt and kill wild Mammoth. One of the young hunters known as D'leh meets his true love Evolet and they become instantly attached, but one day that relationship is torn apart when a tribe of horse riding Warlords invade their village and kidnap Evolet. Following this D'leh and a small troop of hunters set on a quest in order to rescue Evolet and punish the warlords, but along the way they face dangers like Sabre-Tooth Cats and Terror Birds. Further on their journey they encounter other tribes who have faced the same wrath of the warlords and they all band together to form an army which will take on the ""God"" who has taken Evolet as his slave to build pyramids that reach into the skies.

As historically incorrect as it may be, it's still a worth while entertaining movie, but all you have to manage is to put the fact that you're watching terrible acting and try your best to ignore the dialogue.",1214006400,,2129,4.4704370179948585

But even Godzilla was better than this mess which is why I nominate this flick for the 'BM' Award (I know what you're thinking....BM means Bad Movie). All previous criticisms aside, this is a badly acted, badly edited film. And let's not get into the awful storyline. The CGI work is cheesy, especially the laughable saber-toothed tiger. The Mastodon sequence is fine, if you don't look real hard, but much of the rest of the CGI work is woefully bad.

Any film, good or mediocre, must pass the audience test. The test: Can the audience willfully suspend disbelief of what he or she sees on the screen. 10,000 BC does not pass this test. Not even as a fantasy film.

 I recently saw Pathfinder, a film similar in its directed intended audience. Like 10,000 BC, Pathfinder bears little resemblance to actual history, human culture,  or geography but it works well as a popcorn fantasy film. You can enjoy Pathfinder even though you know it is just fantasy and not real history. Pathfinder correctly imitates its comic book origins. 10,000 BC does not.

I can go on forever about the historical inaccuracies in 10,000 BC.  Some writers here have praised this film as a great fantasy and have criticized other reviewers for reviewing this film as historically accurate stating that it was not meant to be historical. But the film never indicates that it is a fantasy. In fact it attempts to convince the audience that the film is an accurate portrayal of life in 10,000 BC from the start. Obviously it is not historical. But many viewers, especially the young, will not know that. Haven't we had enough films that distort history? Is not this film just another version of One Million BC which shows humans living side-by-side with dinosaurs?

Even a fantasy must adhere to basic rules of logic. The film violates many rules of the physical universe. It begins with garbled geography that would never occur in reality. Where on earth can one travel from snow-capped mountains, to jungle, to desert? I also laughed at the CGI spear throwing as well, so obvious fake. Even if we accept that this is a fantasy world, spears cannot be cast as shown in this film. It is a physical impossibility.

I could go one but what's the point. Save your money except if you are a student of bad film and need a lesson on how not to do it. I do have to hand it to Mr Emmerich though. He knows how to make a film that has audience appeal and makes loads of dough for his investors whether or not the film itself is good or bad.",1213833600,10,2652,4.580168776371308

These are mammoth dependent people, similar to the mammoth-societies of the Siberian steppe.  Yes, their mammoths and sabre-tooth are too big.  The sabre-tooth stuff is drawn, whole-cloth, from ""Androcles and the Lion"" [shameless really].  Somehow these Siberians live right next to Africa and manage to ally with with tribes of primitive but noble black Africans.  They do this to liberate their people, including the blue-eyed woman, who has been captured by proto-historic Egyptian slave traders.

They pursue the slavers over Sahara-like sand dunes do discover the Egyptins building pyramids with slave and mammoth power.  It looks great and is a rip-off of the theory that the Egyptian monuments are far older than the vast majority of archaeologists think.  No matter.  It makes for great Hollywood.

Our small band of primitive hunter-gatherers manages to wreck the Egyptians and liberate their people as well as the long-suffering mammoths.

Yes, they speak english, but not every movie has the budget of Apocalypto. Yes, they look the same as us, but again not every movie has a crazy budget. Some producers/directors are more into how they can make us relate to the characters.

3328822,4,B0012Q732O,"Truthfully, the main complaint about this movie is the historical inaccuracy. While reviewers have valid points, I believe that this is more of a Fantasy film rather than a ""based on facts"" offering. (I would suggest people looking for accuracy check out Walking with Prehistoric Beasts""

What I liked about the film: There has been nothing like this in quite some time. Sure, we have had many Jurassic Park films with great looking dinosaurs, but I have always been interested in the mammals that came after. The creatures looked great! I loved the Saber-toothed Cat and the Mammoths running like buffalo was amazing. The Terror Birds were well done, also. I thought the acting was good and the line delivery was decent. Someone complained in another review about them talking in complete sentences, etc. I saw that as being immersed in the language of the day - in other words, this is what we understood. The story was fairly decent even though this was the least believable part. I think the writers were going for a pc theme, which was mostly okay.

What I didn't like (and this contains Spoilers) - Not enough creatures. I thought the Cat was going to be around more than 2 minutes to look after the hero, but no. I would have liked to have seen other mammals besides Cats and Mammoths (I'm not counting the horses). The thing that bothered me most was the evil Pharaoh/Leader with all of the slaves was just some old White guy. What is that about? Honestly. I expected an Alien or some type of creature or at least something a little more interesting. It made me wonder what they were trying to say. There were a few slow spots, but everything did seem to correlate to the story in the end.

Overall, it was a good movie. I would say it was a throwback to movies like Conan the Barbarian and Death stalker and even One Million BC. People that are looking for an educational aspect will be disappointed, although the creatures in the movie DID exist at the same time as humans (some reviewers are stating that they did not, this is not true. There were mammoths, terror birds, and saber-toothed cats up until around 10,000 years ago as well as other mammals such as Giant Ground Sloths, Dire Wolves, and Cave Bears). Again - Fantasy fare that is for the most part, well done, just don't expect a lot of creatures (which I was doing) as this is more of a Man vs. Man movie.",1213574400,3,2378,4.538461538461538

3328892,2,B0012Q732O,"""10,000 BC"" is a Roland Emmerich film. Check out the list of his films - ""Independence Day"" ""Godzilla"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow"" - and you know you need quite a lot of suspension disbelief. But I enjoyed myself watching these films - CGI-created actions and set-pieces and all, and they are often silly, I admit (Will Smith punching the alien in the face?), but it was certainly fun.

Now I have seen his latest film ""10,000 BC"" and I find myself sadly disappointed. I don't think the film is as terrible as critics say. At least special effects are top-notch, like the stampede of mammoths or the roaring saber-tooth tiger, but I cannot help thinking something is missing here and despite its first-rate special effects the film is mostly boring.

Perhaps dull characters are to blame. Or maybe the generic story should be responsible. Actions are largely bland despite superb effects. The story follows Steven Strait's self-doubting hero D'Leh whose blue-eyed sweetheart Evolet (Camilla Belle) is kidnapped by the warriors invading his community. Supporting characters are mostly forgettable ciphers and you cannot tell one from another.

But I was willing to forget the weakness of the film's story, which is linear and predictable; I didn't care the actors' accents (or the fact that they speak English). I don't need ""historical accuracies."" But I need something engaging or exciting and that is what I got in ""Apocalypto"" (there is a similarity between these films). Unfortunately, you don't get it in ""10,000 BC."" Instead, it borrows from other films, bits from this, bits from that, but gives no original idea, no imagination. The locations such as ice-capped mountains or hot deserts are all beautiful to see, but the problem is, they all look today's New Zealand and Namibia.

I know I shouldn't expect the intensity of the Mel Gibson film, but Roland Emmerich could have done something unique or original to entertain us. Some say, probably rightly, that this is homage to Burroughs-like old-fashioned action adventures. I know, but they have more imagination and original vision, or the will and power to invite us into their fictional worlds, which ""10,000 BC sorely lacks.",1209686400,,2189,5.038674033149171

The main character units many tribes ravaged by this evil and puts together a rag-tag army to overthrough the god and free all the slaves including his beloved.

Like i said the film is basicaly a male version of a chick flick. Loads of FX driven action and spectacular visuals ""10,000 B.C."" actually has nothing to do with any time period, rather its takes the best from many periods and puts them together in one film. It works but it is misleading.

3328931,3,B0012Q732O,"I have to admit that I enjoyed ""The Day After Tomorrow"" enough to want to go and see the next movie these developers put out.  Here we have ""10,000 B.C."", clearly a fantasy epic.  The historical concepts might be the one thing that holds a few people from getting really into the film, so I warn you now, this film is not all that historically accurate.  The movie is made to enjoy the adventure and that is all, so enjoy it!  I'll go over some of the historical discrepancies later.

I think this movie was funded to speak to the movie going fans that would see films such as ""Apocalypto"" which was a pretty good success.  Not to mention epics in general have been doing fairly well these recent years.  However, I like the way ""10,000 B.C."" handled the language barrier problems.  In ""Apocalypto"" we basically had to read most of the movie in subtitles because no one spoke that language.  In ""10,000 B.C."" the main characters all speak English, which obviously isn't what they spoke back then.  However, when they come upon another people the other people speak a different language and we have sub titles.  However, you'll notice that when people from the different areas speak to each other they start in a different language then switch to English.  It appears that the developers didn't want the audience reading the film, so rather than make this minutely accurate they took some artistic license and dealt with the problem that way.  An interesting idea and I think it would work for most moviegoers.

Basically we're brought into a very primitive world, I hesitate to call the people ""cave men"" like everyone else because they clearly built their own shelters and they don't appear to be nomadic either.  Their culture seems more akin to the Native American's in North America, and we don't call them cave men because they constructed teepees.  The movie delves into topics of prophecy, love, and unity.  I think that's kind of the overall concept behind the film.  Basically you're dealing with people that explain things in very mystical terms.  For example, they have a wise woman, who is also a mystic.  Similar to what you find in Native American culture or even in Old Norse cultures and in many others.  So this isn't a new concept.  Anyway, the people in the tribe we're looking at come across a little girl with blue eyes, Evolet.  The old mother says that her people were destroyed by four legged demons (men on horses).  Anyway, in order to become leader of this tribe you need to slay a mastodon.  So the person who kills the mammoth gets to marry the girl.  As is typical of these kinds of films, she and another boy, D'Leh (Steven Straight) had already fallen in love by the time this happens.  So naturally this boy needs to kill the mammoth if he wants to marry her.

Regardless of background story and I don't want to give too much away, the point is they were in love.  The four legged demons that took her family and destroyed her tribe eventually come to this tribe and enslave the people, including the blue eyed girl.  So now the chase is on and a group leaves with D'Leh to go after these people that would steal theirs.  What the tribes were a victim of was the expansion of the Egyptian empire.  That much was clearly obvious when we see the three pyramids in Giza.  The Great Pyramid is currently being constructed and the golden top is already in place!  ""10,000 B.C."" really combines reality and fantasy during this period, but it is loosely plausible they would enslave people that far north.  I don't think it's entirely realistic because there were possibly other nations in between.  It ends up turning into a story that requires people to unite and save more than just the girl.  In their travels they meet other peoples who also had been terrorized by the Egyptian empire and they gather a great many people to storm Egypt.  Along the way D'Leh finds out he is beginning to fulfill this ancient prophecy that would lead to the people's freedom.  Typical, I know.  I personally hated the end of this movie because it became horribly clich to give one last feeling of ""tragedy"" so it can end on some ultra-high note of love as anyone watching this film could easily predict.  Personally, I would've just ended it about ten minutes earlier, and done away with the unnecessary annoyance of appealing to an overly clich fan base.

I only name Steven Straight above because he's really the only person I've seen in another movie that I recognized.  He was in that movie ""Covenant"" that was clearly geared towards the same crowed that enjoyed ""The Craft"", only it was geared more towards girls to watch.  Either way, I most commend him on doing this film.  Steven did a superior job in this film than he did in such a silly movie as ""Covenant.""  In fact I didn't even recognize him as the same character until I went and looked him up, that usually means an actor is good at playing a diverse amount of roles.  Let's hope this wasn't a one shot, because it definitely doesn't look like he's falling into being type-casted as the pretty boy role to be a female heart throb.

It's clearly a fantasy film for anyone who knows any kind of rudimentary history. Is it possible that mankind and saber tooth tigers and mastodons existed in conjunctions, most certainly?  But did all this take place in 10,000 B.C.  That's loose at best.  While it's pretty well founded that mankind would have hunted the mastodons, the way the dates time out it seems these animals would have been nearly extinct around this time frame.  It's taking place at the end of the Pleistocene era and this is during the end of an ice age so the climate is changing drastically.  As my first proof of fantasy I submit the trek to the south.  The tribes are in the snowy mountains and then all of a sudden they walk into very thick jungle.  I'm serious, snow ends and jungle begins.  The jungle is so thick that the blades of grass are taller than the people.  Normally changes like this don't happen instantaneously like that and the characters even complain that it is hot, yet there is snow a whopping two feet away from them. Usually climate shifts will taper off gradually and the only time you find drastic shifts is in the desert when all of a sudden a flood takes place and water is available to turn the desert into a lush area (and this happens today).  Regardless, even when that happens the grass isn't taller than a man or nearly as thick here.  Anyway, when they're traveling through this lush jungle they are attacked by these giant birds, which I seriously tried to go and look up because it looked like they were using real creatures to add an air of realism.  The closest I found was Phorusrhacos, which seems to be in the right period and existed in the Pleistocene era.  They are described as being ostrich like and predatory... that meets my requirement.  I must say, I do like the fact that these real creatures were being readily used in the film!  The only other creature that they come upon is the Saber Tooth tiger, which also falls into the correct time frame for this era.  I was disappointed that there was actually only one and it didn't kill anything.

Now I should point out that the animals are all clearly computer generated.  If anyone remembers the wolves from ""The Day After Tomorrow"" you'll remember how fake and foolish those looked.  Frankly, these don't look all that much better.  It looks like they upgraded their rendering image because these animals look a bit more realistic, but they are still very obviously out of place against the strikingly realistic scenery!  Again, if anyone remembers ""The Day After Tomorrow"" it was the landscape scenes that were the most impressive; the same is true for ""10,000 B.C.""  The saving grace in ""The Day After Tomorrow"" was that the wolves were barely even in the movie; unfortunately in ""10,000 B.C."" the presence of animal is far more integral to the movie.  So that definitely worked against the film for my ability to enjoy it.

Okay, so everything seems somewhat up to par for being historically reasonable.  Then the Egyptian empire is brought into the fold.  This is where fantasy became overly obvious.  First off the Great Pyramid was still under construction and historically that's the oldest pyramid out of the three in Giza (it's not the oldest in existence!)... the other two smaller pyramids are already fully constructed next to it.  I think a lot of this theory comes into play with a psychic named Edgar Cayce who ""channeled"" an ancient spirit who told him the pyramids were constructed after the fall of Atlantis from the remnants of that civilization.  I've read a book based around Cayce's Atlantis concept and if I remember it correctly he has it dated around 100,000 years old.  That date is pretty unequivocally unrealistic if you ask me.  There's no evidence of a super civilization existing that long ago that would have influenced the major religions.  If Cayce had proffered a date like 10,000 B.C. for Atlantis, maybe that would make more logical sense, either way, no one has found Atlantis in the form he spoke of yet.  The closest we have to Plato's Atlantis is that he was possibly talking about the Minoans.  Okay tangent done, most historians date the Great Pyramid to be built by Khufu (or Cheops), with construction ending around 2,560 B.C.  This is drastically different from the 10,000 B.C. date that Cayce ""channeled"".  So the Cayce Foundation funded some expedition to date elements from the Great Pyramid, such as wood used in the construction, to find out how old the pyramid was.  This dating came up with a range of 3,090-2,723 B.C. (plus or minus 100 to 400 years).  This was in the lower rim and even in the higher range of 3,809B.C. (plus or minus 160 years) we can see it's nowhere near the date of 10,000 B.C. that Cayce got from his spirit contact.  Either Cayce is wrong or Radiocarbon dating is wrong.  I'll stick with Radiocarbon for now.  Either way that doesn't change the fact that this pyramid was built first in that particular strip.

Furthermore during this construction it shows the Egyptians using Mastodon's as work animals to haul the stone.  This may make sense for a 10,000 B.C. time frame, but doesn't for a realistic construction time frame since they would have been extinct by then.  Actually, in terms of climate I would say it doesn't even fit the 10,000 B.C. time frame because a Mastodon was more of an artic animal and not really suited for desert survival.  However, I will admit the use of the mastodon was fairly integral to the story-line so I can see why it was used in the Egyptian scenes.  Egypt appears to have a full branching society at this point, but realistically Sumer would have pre-dated Egypt's rise to power, so we'd have to push all the dates for Sumer back to earlier times if Egypt was doing this in 10,000 B.C.  Naturally I don't think anyone will look at this as being remotely historically accurate, especially given the size of the Egyptian civilization at the time frame this movie is presenting.

In another part of the movie it does give a very Stargate styled explanation for all this knowledge.  The movie alludes to the fact that there were once three pharaohs and the one building the great pyramid is the last one alive.  You don't ever really see the pharaoh's face, but you do see him standing next to people and he is far taller than anyone else, practically a giant!  In a discussion between characters it is mentioned that some say they came from the stars, presenting the space alien theory.

In the end I thought it was a decent adventure to go on.  I don't regret seeing it, but you really need to take the movie for what it is.  It's an attempt at making an adventure epic that was clearly influenced by something like ""Apocalypto.""  Frankly ""Apocalypto"" was a better movie and I would surely recommend it over this.  I also think that ""The Day After Tomorrow"" was a little better than what was made here, but I think it's great to get people's interest sparked in the ancient world.  Granted some people will surely be foolish enough to believe this film is accurate, but you'll get that with anyone.  I've even read a book where the author truly believed that it was Satan that built the pyramids in Giza to make a mock Heaven, because pyramids were originally in Heaven (and presumably still are).  Seriously, people will believe anything you throw at them.",1206316800,2,12465,4.633090246125797
3328932,2,B0012Q732O,"About the best thing that can be said for ""10,000 B.C."" is that it at least doesn't have the human characters sharing screen time with a bunch of rampaging dinosaurs (which puts it light years ahead of ""One Million Years B.C."" in terms of historical realism, though that's not exactly a very high bar for any film to get over). But that's about the only anachronism that doesn't find its way into this film, which seems otherwise designed to give any serious anthropologist or historian a severe case of the professional heebie-jeebies. For here is a movie in which people live in thatch-roofed villages, travel on elaborately designed wooden sailboats, and worship at massive pyramids and temples, thousands of years before any of those things actually existed. Of course, one doesn't expect to find the stark documentary realism of a ""Quest For Fire"" in any project by Roland Emmerich - the purveyor of such high class pop culture schlock as ""Independence Day,"" ""Godzilla,"" ""The Day After Tomorrow,"" etc. - but couldn't somebody have done at least a modicum of historical research before sending this out to a public as woefully uninformed about ancient history as polls seem to indicate this one is?

""10,000 B.C."" actually starts off promisingly, with a fairly exciting chase scene involving a bunch of underdressed homo sapiens pursuing a herd of overdressed woolly mammoths. Then, regrettably, the plot itself takes over, the umpteenth version of that oldie about the evildoers who come from over the mountains to ransack the peace-loving tribe's village and make off with some of their members. It is then up to the hunkiest guy in the group to mount a rescue attempt, braving threats both manmade and natural on the way to his goal.

Because we have so little to engage our interest either intellectually or emotionally, our minds are free to ponder some of the truly profound questions of the ages such as how such primitive people, living out in the harshest elements imaginable, still manage to have their eyebrows neatly tweezed and their hands softly manicured at all times.

There's not much point in discussing the dialogue or the acting - both largely irrelevant in a film of this type anyway - but it should be pointed out that while the mammoths are really quite impressive in their movements and appearance, the giant dodo birds and saber-toothed tigers with which our heroes also have to contend feel much more like the CGI effects that they clearly are.

Who knows, but ""10,000 B.C."" may one day achieve the status of a camp classic - yet, the way I see it, there's nothing quite like a scantily-clad Raquel Welch being chased by an angry Tyrannosaurus Rex to up a movie's chances at achieving cinematic immortality.",1206230400,,2737,4.9049676025917925
3328933,5,B0012Q732O,"No doubt about it, I'm a contrarian, and that pattern holds concerning this fictional kids' film.

I know that history is askew in this film, yet there are so many pieces that work. Within this fiction, the characterizations, portrayals of prehistoric animals (mammoths, saber-toothed tigers and birds) and cinematography are all dazzling.

More importantly, the tale carries several wonderful messages that kids appreciate---the need to protect one's own people as well as others, the need to preserve and restore human rights, and the need to work with others, despite seeming differences. The saga also includes a romance, and legend.

And all this comes (as one other reviewer noted) without blood and guts. I wouldn't say the film portrays the world ""before the White Man came and ruined everything.""

True enough, the chronology is way off kilter---as the ancient Egyptians reigned long after 10000 B.C. And they undoubtedly did not harness mastodons while building the pyramids. But never mind that.

The ancient Egyptians did treat their slaves cruelly.

And history aside, this action and adventure film provides authentic representations of prehistoric living conditions, as well as the myths and medicine men of early civilizations. The movie also includes a large dollop of humanism, which sticks with viewers long after the last scene.

3328977,1,B0012Q732O,"A number of years ago, I read a piece of film criticism written by Roger Ebert. The Pulitzer Prize winning movie critic wrote a review of ""Caveman"", a film starring Ringo Starr and Barbara Bach - the filmmakers provided a press kit for the screening listing the words used within the film, the caveman's vocabulary, and the meaning of these words - Ebert used these words to describe how bad ""Caveman"" was and it was quite a memorable movie review. I only wish ""10,000 B.C."" was as inventive. Actually, it is inventive in one regard; the depiction of history within the film is laughably inventive.

""10,000 B.C"" begins even a few years earlier when a small tribe of cavemen takes in a strange orphan girl with blue eyes. The Old Mother (Mona Hammond) predicts this girl, whom they name Evolet, must become a part of the tribe, and she and D'Leh, a young boy whose father mysteriously leaves the tribe, become friends. Flash forward to 10,000 B.C. and the last Mammoth hunt is here. Now, D'Leh (Steven Strait) and Evolet (Camilla Belle) are attracted to one another. But Tic Tic (Cliff Curtis), D'Leh's defacto father figure claims the warrior who kills a mammoth wins the white spear and Evolet. Well, D'Leh is gonna do both, I tell you what. D'Leh manages to kill the only mammoth and claims his prize. Later that evening, the four-legged beasts (horses to you and I) carry another tribe invading the tribe and they carry Evolet and a number of other women off. D'Leh and Tic Tic set-off to find her and bring her back. They set out leaving Baku (Nathaniel Baring) behind, but the precocious young kid trails behind and soon joins them. Their trek takes them across Africa, where they meet other tribes who have fallen victim to the same marauders and want to help. They join forces with D'Leh. Eventually, they arrive in Egypt and find a number of slaves and wooly mammoths helping to build the pyramids. And Evolet is being held captive. How can they free Evolet and all of their other tribesmen who have become slaves?

Co-written and directed by Roland Emmerich (""Independence Day"" - one of the best summer movies ever, ""The Day After Tomorrow""), the film has a grand scale and does a pretty good job of recreating some icons of the caveman era, but pretty bad acting and playing fast and loose with what little we actually know of this period help to ruin the film.

We have all seen this type of film before; the director and rest of the production team are so intent on recreating a specific time or place, using all of their skills and tricks to recreate the icons of this era, that they have no time left for the actors. Time or money. The film is filled with actors we have never seen before and they are adequate for the purpose and are certainly no better or no worse than the material they are appearing in. Steven Strait plays D'Leh, the lead. He is handsome, even under the gunk and dirt painted on his body to help him portray the caveman he is supposed to be. I have never seen him in anything before, probably from television or soap operas, and his performance is unremarkable and serviceable to the CGI creatures and effects. Camilla Belle plays Evolet, the love interest and again, she is serviceable to the special effects and unremarkable. This isn't a film you go to expecting to watch the next great Academy Award winning performance. All of the money, time and attention went into recreating wooly mammoths, saber tooth tigers and the ancient pyramids.

The film begins with narration by Omar Sharif. He talks about the tribe, the Old Mother, how D'Leh and Evolet met. Throughout the film, he tells us what particular characters are thinking, and experiencing. It is an interesting idea and his voice is fun to listen to. But because he is telling us about people's feelings and motivations, and we aren't seeing this in their performance, it makes the actors seem even more awkward and wooden. Not a good thing for these young actors.

During the course of the film, D'Leh and Nakudu come across other tribes during their journey to rescue Evolet. D'Leh's tribe speaks English, but no one else does. This just makes no sense. Of course, they aren't really speaking ""English"", but their tribe's language is translated for us and that is what we hear. Every time they come into contact with some other tribe of people, they are speaking a tongue that requires subtitles for us to understand. Worse, when D'Leh and his warriors come into contact with an African tribe, one of their members can speak the same language and communicate with them. But of course, the rest can't. This makes is especially easy for them to become allies and move through Africa enlisting the aid of other troops. It would've been easier for the filmmakers to simply create a language, as the people who made ""Caveman"" did. It makes about as much sense.

Worse, when the people are speaking English, they use strange, affected accents making their dialogue sound like a badly dubbed Italian gladiator film. Even more unnerving, the tribe of marauders who invade D'Leh's camp and take Evolet speak in some strange tongue, which also sounds as though they might be aliens; their voices sound like they are given the same treatment James Earl Jones voice was given when he voiced Darth Vader.

The key obstacle for films recreating periods of time from long ago, times we have little or spotty knowledge of is to make these worlds seem real. Because Emmerich does little to maintain what we actually do know about the timeline of this period, or to make the geography seem real, the film seems completely phony. There just isn't enough in the film to help us believe we are watching a real moment in this history.

So, let's talk a little about the ""history"" of this film. Cavemen make a trek from their home camp, which is located in a mountain range somewhere, complete with snow and cold temperatures. Their journey takes them into Africa, where they meet many other tribes, and they all band together to rescue the people kidnapped from their tribes and taken to Egypt to help build the pyramids. Okay, so where are these cavemen coming from? Snowy mountains, then trekking through Africa to Egypt? Did they make a u-turn somewhere? Yeah, that's it. They even journey through what looks like a rainforest at one point. Must be one of those fabled rainforests that have completely dried up in the intervening 12000 plus years. Yeah, that's it.

But then, the cavemen eventually make it to Egypt where the evil king - priest - priestess - eunuch (not sure) is using the slaves to build the pyramids. Uh huh. Sorry, but even my limited knowledge of history is enough to tell me this never happened. Never could have happened. Yes, I know it is a film, and it isn't trying to be a history lesson.

But when a filmmaker makes a film like this, intended for a mass audience, primarily aimed at teens, playing this fast and loose with history, seems, at best, problematic. I know that for every group of teenage boys who goes to this film, at least one of them will end up thinking some caveman was able to travel to Egypt and at least temporarily delay the building of the pyramids. Then, maybe this same teenager will one day believe the ramblings of someone else who believed the Romans never had slaves and will one day grow up to believe the Holocaust never happened.

Okay, that is a stretch. ""10,000 B.C."" isn't good enough to be that powerful.

3328979,3,B0012Q732O,"10,000 BC is one of those films that is not meant to be taken seriously by dedicated students of history or paleontology.  It is to these two disciplines that Raquel Welch was to ONE MILLION BC.  Director Roland Emmerich eschewed accuracy for entertainment and the result is an action-packed film that delivers the dramatic goods.  Some critics have further complained of what they saw as gratuitous violence, but for a film that deals with a brutal age, the violence is far more  subdued than gorishly up front.

The plot is simple enough.  Some bad guy cavemen on horseback attack a peaceful tribe and carry off some tribespeople, one of whom is the mate of the hero.  The bulk of the action consists of his attempts to free them.  What makes this film a crowd pleaser is the convincing special effects that dominate.  There are several scenes of marauding wooley mammoths that have to be seen to be believed.  As long as Emmerich keeps audience focus of the logistics of mammoth killing, he is on firm historical ground. The background scenery is glacial western Europe, and one can sense that this was pretty much the way it was.  The tribes people speak impeccable English and we can see that they have a rich tapestry of religion and culture.  After the kidnapping of the hero's mate, Emmerich distorts geological fact in a way that surprisingly enough does not intrude on viewer interest.  Within the latter part of the film, he has the hero trek across a bewildering variety of landscape that ranges from glacial cold to tropical jungle to desert sands.  But because we are so involved in the hero's quest we wink at even scenes of pre-dynastic Egyptian pyramid building and hints of a connection between the deluge of lost Atlantis and the earliest of the Pharoahs.  What emerges by the end is the realization that viewer interest is once again maintained by characters with whom we can identify.  All the other eye candy of computer graphics takes a back seat.  In 10,000 BC, Roland Emmerich found this hard to achieve balance.",1205625600,,2037,4.7578347578347575

I did like to velociraptor-like giant chickens / dodoes / whatever - very large man-eating birds are scary AND cool!

The non-specific geographic location and lack of time orientation were disappointing, though.  Another reviewer remarked that they weren't sure if it took days, weeks, months, or years.  From what I could tell, the whole story only took, like, four or five days!  That's a lot of hiking, man!

Overall - okay.  I'll buy it when on clearance next year :)",1205452800,2,808,4.817518248175182
3328981,2,B0012Q732O,"10,000 B.C. is a sprawling, messy, jaw-dropping, silly, enjoyable bit of forgettable fun.  It's the most disposable epic movie I've ever seen.  Roland Emmerich, who has brought us fluffy epic fun before with INDEPENDENCE DAY and DAY AFTER TOMORROW, certainly has a grasp on how to bring moments to film that will stick with the viewer.  Long after forgetting the details of these former blockbusters, I still remember the image of the White House being blasted to bits or Manhattan encrusted in ice.  With this latest effort, I suppose I might remember the stampeding wooly mammoths.  Or I might not.  It's been 5 days since I saw the movie, and I can barely remember half of what happened.

It tells the story of a tribe of early humans who survive by hunting mammoths.  They live in the foothills of a giant mountain range, and are pretty isolated from the rest of the world.  But when another tribe invades and snags many of their best hunters, presumably to enslave them...our intrepid hero and his older mentor head off into unknown lands to save their fellow tribesmen.  Naturally, one of the prisoners is also the love interest for our hero.

As this little band of travelers moves, they go from the blistering cold of the high mountains to the grassy lowlands where they meet a friendly tribe who join them on their quest.  What began as a tiny group determined to win the freedom of some friends turns into a guerilla army comprised of members of several tribes...all eager to free their comrades and bring down an empire that is enslaving all these folks in order to build what looks suspiciously like the Egyptian pyramids...thousands of years before they were really built, of course.

It became almost laughable to see the climactic changes these men went through.  As I said, from foothills to snowcapped mountains, to savannahs, to grasslands, to marshy country to a Saharan desert to a fertile river valley.  We get no sense of how long they have traveled.  Heck, it might have been a journey of two years or two weeks for all we can tell.  And each climate has its own distinctive group of indigenous peoples...so we end up with a truly multi-racial and multi-cultural army.  But instead of sending a message about unity...I was mostly perplexed in trying to figure out just where in the world this story was taking place.  Probably Africa...but some of the geography felt more like the Andes mountains of South America.  So it all ended up feeling very generic.

There were a few impressive scenes.  Early on, we see a mammoth hunt, and the scenes of grazing mammoths, turned into stampeding mammoths was well done.  The CGI effects were credible and for about 2 minutes, you can really believe you're getting a sense of how our early ancestors behaved.  (Later CGI of a saber tooth tiger is NOT very believable at all...I have yet to see a large cat done convincingly via CG...just think of Aslan in NARNIA).  Towards the end, the scenes at the city where thousands of slaves and hundreds of mammoths are toiling to build a series of pyramids is nothing short of impressive.  Again, the CG is first-rate, and briefly a sense of awe IS inspired.  I emphasize the word ""briefly.""  Most of the movie is incredibly generic questing stuff, done far better in many movies that have come before...mostly notably in Mel Gibson's brilliant and very exciting APOCALYPTO.

The generic feel is not much helped by the average performances.  The only truly recognizable face is that of Camilla Belle (BALLAD OF JACK & ROSE), who plays the love interest.  She is striking to look at and absolutely, 100% boring.  Everyone else is bland.  An Omar Sharif provides grating narration in a voice that is so filled with silkiness and wonder that it bordered on camp.

I had a decent time watching this film, but I doubt if it will recoup its budget.  I sensed no true enthusiasm for it from the audience I sat with.  Yes, we all came to see the big epic in a very dutiful manner...sheep trained to attend all things where a giant wide-screen is advised.  But we also filed out in a dutiful manner, and no voices were overheard saying, ""that was fun.""

And I could spend all day picking this film apart - BUT IT""S A FANTASY STORY! HELLO! Remember: FANTASY! That's what I paid my money for!  Not a documentary or historical fiction, but a FANTASTIC, DREAM-LIKE story.

Nor do you have to be a genius to figure this out!

The movie works on many levels. First, as an adventure story, a saga, like Lord of the Rings. I felt swept away. It's also an enjoyable love story. The  chemistry between the actors is excellent. I cared about the characters. In addition to being erotic! - Its been a long time since I've seen so many good looking men and women on the Big Screen all at one time!

Very little of the violence is graphic or gratuitous. You can tell a fantastic story without blood and guts flying everywhere. It's also a movie suitable for older children.

Tribal people and people of color are shown with respect. Their rich variety of  physical features, skin colors, dress, languages and architecture are shown in all its glory. Before the White Man came, and ruined everything, there was mind boggling cultural diversity on this planet!

What is most striking to me is the very moving and insightful portrayal of a Medicine Women performing profound acts of shamanism in order to help protect her people as best as she can. This is the very first time I seen such a pivotal role for tribal spiritual beliefs in a big Hollywood fantasy film! My hats off to the whomever wrote the screenplay! You did your homework!

Granted the ending did bother me a bit. It begs the question: Did the ancient Egyptians actually treat their workers that poorly?  If only the Egyptians didn't use slaves, and treated their workers well. And what a metaphor for the year 2008, where most workers in the world are treated like dirt and instead of whips, the fear of dire poverty is used to keep most of the world's workers in line.

But I digress, this is a great movie. At the end a tear rolled down my cheek,  and I felt good when I left the theater. That's all I can ask of a  story.  My money was well spent, for a change!

3328985,4,B0012Q732O,"I LOVE primeval or primitive-type films like ""One Million Years B.C.,"" ""Conan the Barbarian,"" ""Planet of the Apes,"" ""Beneath TPOTA,"" ""Sands of the Kalahari"" and Tarzan, which of course explains my interest in seeing Roland Emmerich's brand new ""10,000 B.C."" (even despite the mediocre reviews and the fact that I dislike other Emmerich films like ""Independence Day"" and ""Day After Tomorrow"").

What does one expect in seeing a film titled ""10,000 B.C""? ""Citizen Kane""? No, you would likely expect raw, primordial landscapes, mountains, deserts and jungles, 'cavemen' (and women), chisiled bods with zero fat, giant beasts of terror and ominous music. ""10,000 B.C."" has all this and, surprisingly, more.

THE PLOT: The mammoths are slowly disappearing in the mountainous regions where D'Leh's tribe dwells, but when a herd finally appears he proves his courage by slaying one of the mighty beasts. Suddenly slavers from the deserts raid D'Leh's ""village"" (more like a campsite) and make off with his beloved Evolet and numerous others. D'Leh and three more pursue them into the jungles and then the desert. Along the way, many different tribes and peoples join their cause to end the tyrannical slave raids. The journey and climax brings profound spiritual growth to D'Leh as his ""Circle of love"" expands to include far more than merely Evolet, blood relatives and fellow tribe members.

In a film like this I demand great locations and ""10,000 B.C"" delivers spectacularly! Seriously, the landscapes are so breathtaking that seeing 'em on the big screen is a must. The rugged mountainous scenes were filmed in New Zealand, the jungle scenes in South Africa and the desert segment in Namibia.

Many of the visuals are just magnificent, like the slave ships and their red butterfly sails. Needless to say, incredible cinematography.

Much of the F/X work is great, like the woolly mammoths, but the sabertooth tiger is a tad fake-looking, albeit serviceable. The entire mammoth hunt segment is incredible filmmaking and truly thrilling.

D'Leh and his associates are all likable while the slavers & pyramid people are all fittingly loathesome. Great casting.

D'Leh is played by Steven Strait and Evolet by Camilla Belle. You'll note that Camilla has one of the most beautiful faces you'll ever happen to see, especially in the close-ups near the end.

Some have criticized that D'Leh's tribe speaks English (while other tribes speak different languages). Aduh, the filmmakers are hoping that viewers have a brain and can figure out that they aren't really speaking English (modern English didn't exist for another 9,750 years or so); D'Leh's tribe are obviously speaking some caveman lingo like every other tribe, but the filmmakers have translated their language for our convenience so we don't have to read subtitles the entire film.

Contrary to what some say ""10,000 B.C."" is not a remake of 1966's ""One Million Years B.C."" (the one with Raquel Welch and her infamous animal-skin bikini). The basic plot is the same as Mel Gibson's ""Apocalypto"" but there's enough differences to make ""10,000 B.C."" worthwhile if you've seen the Gibson film. In fact, even though ""10,000 B.C."" is a bit more cartooney than ""Apocalypto"" you get more bang for your buck. ""Apocalypto"" may have more action but ""10,000 B.C."" has a better variety of locations and breathtaking landscapes. Not to mention ""Apocalypto's"" message is simple: Civilization bad, rural tribes good, invaders from across the sea evil incarnate. (That last part's a joke, sort of).

By contrast, ""10,000 B.C."" surprisingly has a spiritual depth that transcends the usual action/adventure fare. Love is a strong theme here. There's a scene near the beginning of the film where D'Leh (still a kid) grabs Evolet's hand and declares his undying love for her. Unrealistic? Not really. Kids back then would naturally be more developed at an earlier age due to the fact that they weren't spoiled or distracted from spiritual growth by absent parents, materialism, video games, Britney Spears, MTV and the internet (or whatever). Anyway, D'Leh's love for Evolet later propels him to take the long journey to rescue her and the other tribe members. During this journey his ""circle of love"" grows well beyond just Evolet, blood relatives and fellow tribemen to encompass many peoples of varying races and even a sabertooth tiger (!) (think Marvel's Ka-Zar, Lord of the Hidden Jungle). I wasn't expecting this.

That's right, the film even adresses love and respect for animals. For instance, D'Leh has the opportunity to slay a ferocious beast but instead decides to save it despite the possiblity of being devoured or mauled. Also, his tribe regularly kills the mighty mammoths for necessities but they clearly respect the beast. Later in the film they are shocked to see the ""civilized"" pyramid people abuse the great animals.

In ""10,000 B.C."" love is like a warm life-giving ray of sun in a cold, rugged world. This is very different to the subtext of ""One Million Years B.C."" which blatantly states (in the narration) that the world is a hard and unfriendly place. Generally speaking, the message of ""One Million Years B.C."" is that life in this world is hard, hateful and meaningless, whereas the moral of ""10,000 B.C."" is that life is indeed hard, but it doesn't have to be hateful, hopeless or meaningless, and love indeed conquers all (that is, if peoople are open to it).

Some have criticized the many mystical elements in the story but, despite what Spock-like intellectuals would have you believe, life extends far beyond the limited parameters of science and reason. How do we explain the numerous mysteries of life and the universe? How do we explain the amazing prophecy the Aztecs had concerning Cortes and his arrival? A few years ago a prophet who didn't know me from adam called me up (from my seat) and spoke over me for a few minutes. He miraculously knew things and ""predicted"" others that he couldn't possibly have known apart from a powerful spiritual gift. People who view life exclusively from the narrow scope of reason and science are proud fools. Enough said.

""10,000 B.C"" is reminiscent of a few other films aside from ""Apocalypto."" The slave raider's attack on the village strongly brings to mind ""Conan the Barbarian"" (in fact, the entire film has a strong Conan vibe) while the giant birds in the jungle recall the raptors of ""Jurassic Park."" You'll also see glimpses of ""Last of the Mohicans"" here and there.

If you're a fan of these pictures and primeval/primitive-style films in general ""10,000 B.C."" is a must. Don't listen to the overly critical reviewers. No, it's not a perfect film -- the final Act falters, losing the captivating appeal of the first two Acts -- and, yes, there's a bit of cartoonishness, but ""10,000 B.C."" surprisingly exceeds the superficiality of most action/adventure flicks with a profound subtext.",1205107200,12,6907,5.067781690140845
