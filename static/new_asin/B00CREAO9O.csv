what i don't understand is why on earth is Season 5 and Season 6 available before Season 4 ??
 that is some pretty messed up logic does anyone know the reason why

other than that as a child growing up in the 80's im pretty chuffed !!",1381104000,3,329,4.190476190476191
5735249,5,B00CREAO9O,"This particular season of the Super Friends, out of it's entire 1973-1985 run on Saturday morning, had for so many years been held back from DVD release for whatever reason. A lot of us felt copyright issues had a big influence over the lack of 1979's episodes being available. Apparently the powers that be are fully aware of how sought after this season is that the release has gone through a rather unique process. Available as a Target exclusive several months ago it's now being made available for pre-order on Amazon for a November release (a month AFTER the DVD release of the 1981 short episodes titled ""Legacy of Super Powers"").

**SPOILERS ARE ABUNDANT**

I love all the episodes! I can't really pick out an absolute favorite but I will lean heavily on the episode titled ""Universe of Evil"". It's just such a drastically different kind of episode from those have come before and those that came after with the possible exception being the 1985 episode, ""The Death of Superman"", and 1978's ""Terror from the Phantom Zone"". In ""Universe of Evil"" we're introduced to a world that's being run by a villainous group called the Super Enemies. The beginning of the episode shows what appears to be the Super Friends rushing to a dam that's about to burst. Once they arrive they proceed to destroy the dam rather than repair it. Then it's revealed that we're watching the exploits of an evil version of the Super Friends in a parallel universe. Later on, in the 'good' universe, a volcano's eruption causes Superman to fly off and attempt to stop it's destruction. In the parallel universe the evil Superman attempts to cause it to erupt. As the two Supermen in parallel universes go about their goal, a split second warp zaps the good Superman into the evil universe as the evil Superman finds himself in a world of good (much to his horror).

In ""Terror at 20,000 Fathoms"" we see Superman, Aquaman, and the Wonder Twins at the Fortress of Solitude where Superman shows his guests the various items kept there...including the bottled city of Kandor. Later on a deranged captain (a spoof of Captain Nemo) attempts to launch missiles from his sub but needs kryptonite as an added ingredient. Superman, by then, had flown off to Saturn but thanks to an unlikely source (the U.N.) the evil captain discovers that Superman had since rid the universe of Kryptonite and that only the Super Friends would know of it's whereabouts. The captain had created an android duplicate of Batman to steal the missiles that the real Batman and Robin were transporting. Once the android attacked Batman, the android duplicate stole the missiles and ejected Robin in mid-flight. Later, the android Batman tricks Aquaman into revealing that the Kryptonite is being stored at Superman's fortress. Given Superman's absence and the fact that the remaining Super Friends have been captured it's up to the small Kandorians to free Batman, Robin, and Aquaman. The Super Friends free the Wonder Twins.

The thing that catches the eye, as far as the DVD cover art is concerned, is how similar the characters look to their comic book illustration with lots of muscular detail. The characters appear much different in the series than how they appear on the DVD's cover art. The same holds true for the previous release of the 1980 short episodes and the DVD release of the first season.

""Lex Luthor Strikes Back"", the second episode, is a bit like an episode of CHALLENGE OF THE SUPER FRIENDS minus the rest of the Legion of Doom. There's the grand scheme and it's seemingly flawless execution as the bad guys appear to have the upper hand but then things start to get complex. Luthor's invented a camera that projects pictures and causes people to take on the image of anyone. At the start of the episode Luthor is being visited in prison by Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen. As Lois interviews Luthor he lets her in on his latest attempt to destroy the Super Friends. As Luthor begins to get closer to her she screams for Jimmy's help...but this causes no reaction since Jimmy is revealed to be Luthor's assistant in disguise. Throughout the episode Luthor uses his camera to cause chaos and confusion amongst the Super Friends until things unravel...he seeks the assistance of sun demons as part of a greater scheme to turn the sun red and cause Superman to lose his powers. The sun demons immediately turn on Luthor and he has no choice but to free the captured Super Friends in an effort to save Earth but to save himself, too. Until the sun returns to it's natural color Superman has to use the Super-Mobile.

""Super Friends meet Frankenstein"" is a story of a descendent of Baron Frankenstein turning to a life of crime and all he needs is to create a monster in order to accomplish his goals. He ends up capturing all of the Super Friends, except Robin. The scientist transforms Batman, Superman, and Wonder woman into his monster and what emerges is a monster with all the powers of the Super Friends rolled into one. Robin, eventually, is turned into a super hero equivalent by draining the rest of the energy from the Super Friends and he goes about defeating the Super Friends monster. He restores all of the Super Friends powers at the last second. Frankenstein is aided by an Igor-type with an exaggerated Peter Lorre flavored voice.

In ""Space Knights of Camelon"" Superman has lost his memory after being struck by a meteor. He awakes in a community known as Camelon. This is a town populated by knights and castles...a reworking of the Camelot tales featuring the adventures of King Arthur, the Black Knight, and the Knights of the Round Table in general. Superman is adopted by the locals as the Black Knight of Camelon and he sets about to rule the territory with a steel fist. It isn't until later that the rest of the Super Friends track him down, realize he's lost his memory, and witness how ruthless he's become. Batman saves the day by coming up with a plan to jar Superman's memory back during a laser lance joust.

In ""Rub Three Times for Disaster"" we see a take on the Aladdin story. The main villain of the story is named Kareem Azar. It's been said by other fans that the character is an illustration of the Ayatollah. The place in which much of the story takes place is a pun on Baghdad called Zagdad. The evil genie from the lamp imprisons the Sultan, the Wonder Twins, Gleek, and Superman. The Sultan leads the way out of the magic lamp based upon stories he had heard during his youth.

In ""Planet of Oz"" Mister Mxyzptlk whisks away the Hall of Justice and turns Superman into the Man of Tin, Wonder woman into the Lion, and Aquaman into the Scarecrow. They are warned to stay on the yellow brick road but they venture off several times. The entire adventure is concocted by Mxyzptlk in an attempt to use the Super Friends to help him come up with key ingredients to a potion that could help him remain in the physical universe forever (rather than the 5th dimension). After the Super Friends find the wizard he refuses to help them and it's then revealed that the wizard is none other than Mxyzptlk! After Mxyzptlk drinks the potion, Superman dares him to say his own name backwards. Those not familiar with the character should be made aware that if Mxyzptlk says his name backwards then he'll be zapped back into the 5th dimension for 90 days. Since Mxyzptlk himself can't stand being tormented or belittled, he triumphantly says his name backwards and he begins to slowly fade back to the 5th dimension. How is this possible if the potion was suppose to work...you'll have to see it yourselves. I don't want to give away every detail!!",1376870400,14,7635,4.691791044776119
5735250,5,B00CREAO9O,"For those fans who missed out on the exclusive Season 4 release of ""World's Greatest Super Friends!"" from Target, the DVD is now available to order from Amazon (and other retail stores) for a November 12th release date.

Season 4 is comprised of 8 thirty-minute cartoons (about 22 minutes without commercials):

1. ""Rub Three Times For Disaster"" (Original air date 9/22/79)
2. ""Lex Luthor Strikes Back"" (Original air date 9/29/79)
3. ""Space Knights of Camelon"" (Original air date 10/06/79)
4. ""The Lord of Middle Earth"" (Original air date 10/13/79)
5. ""Universe of Evil"" (Original air date 10/20/79)
6. ""Terror At 20,000 Fathoms"" (Original air date 10/27/29)
7. ""The Super Friends Meet Frankenstein"" (Original air date 11/03/79)
8. ""The Planet of OZ"" (Original air date 11/10/79)

(1 disc) Total running time approximately 3 hours.

Having already purchased this item from Target, I have to say that the picture and sound quality are quite good.  There are no bonus features other than a few unrelated trailers, but that's okay.  Next to ""Challenge of the Super Friends"" 'World's Greatest' is my personal 2nd favorite season of the series.  Both are fun but also have a bit of darkness to them that still stand out.  Many of Season 4's episodes were influenced by a classic story and/or a famous author, such as Mary Shelly, L. Frank Baum, and J.R.R. Tolkien.  These influences helped improve the storylines quite a bit.  My personal favorites are ""The Super Friends Meet Frankenstein"" and ""Universe of Evil"" which reminded me a lot of the classic Star Trek episode, ""Mirror, Mirror"", written by Jerome Bixby.  The idea of having evil versions of Superman, Batman, Robin, and the others (including Gleek) doing horrendous things was quite something to see back in the day.  The specific look that was given to evil Superman was quite effective and still holds up in my mind.  This episode definitely felt like ""part 1"" of a possible 2-parter, but we never got to see a ""part 2"".  (I wonder if one was ever written?)  But I still highly recommend this DVD to fans and those who haven't seen it but enjoy shows like Justice League and are curious.  It has a tremendous nostalgic influence on me as I'm sure it does many other fans.

Order your copy of ""World's Greatest Super Friends!"" (Season 4) today!  And, depending on sales, maybe Warner Brothers will eventually release a ""Complete Series"" down the road.  I dislike double-dipping as much as the next person, but if they do it right (good packaging, bonus disc of goodies, episode guide, etc.) I'd probably give in and pick it up like I'm sure a lot of us would.

What Im not too happy about is the DVD case I received from the shipper but I believe reviews should be based on the content of actual DVD.  It had a 2 inch gash on the back of the case that went all the way through the plastic case.  I thought about returning the unopened DVD back to Amazon but I really, really wanted to watch the Universe of Evil episode so my impatience over took my sensibility and desire to have an unblemished case.

I like the longer episodes of the Super Friends, instead of the shorter 10minute ones because they can at least get in to the story a little more, even if it is not very original or exciting.  There are only a few seasons of the Super Friends I don't want to see, mainly the First season, which had very simple animation and super simple and even sillier story lines.",1426291200,3,733,4.541984732824427
