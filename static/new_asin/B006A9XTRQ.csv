8495752,3,B006A9XTRQ,"Decent, worth checking out if you like rock documentaries.  OK documentary on a relatively unknown early complex no hold bar musical performer struggling with life. 3.5 stars really.",1448755200,,182,5.5
8495753,5,B006A9XTRQ,"I was lucky enough to know Marian.  She was one of those people who copes with deep injury through art.  I contributed to this film, memorializing her life.  I have bought copies of the film for several people who also knew and loved her, and a few who weren't lucky enough to meet her.

The film is well-made.  I believe that when a good person dies young, it's important to carry on their story, as inspiration and perhaps warning to others.  Ms. Ayers has done that, in a caring, evocative way. The story is sad, but it speaks its truth.",1367971200,4,540,4.35
8495754,5,B006A9XTRQ,"love is doc about a great singer and great band think TEXAS TERRI, GG, and just a raw and wild band with a punk singer who lives fasts and died way too you",1356480000,,155,3.727272727272727
8495755,5,B006A9XTRQ,"I first encountered Marian through a documentary I found called Sadobabies: Runaways In San Francisco. That doc was made in 1987 and published in 1988 and went to all sorts of international film festivals. When I saw the sequel, titled The Loser's Club, I discovered that Marian had gotten off the streets in 1993 and she had a band. Being the avid punk rocker that I am, I discovered The Insaints and fell in love with her. When I heard of this film, I found it online and watched it with a friend. It always stuck with me, her story, her life. So, I bought this DVD and rediscovered what a talent, what a beauty and what a wonderful albeit tortured soul she was.

I never knew Marian, but feel extremely proud of what she was able to accomplish in the East Bay punk community. I am both intrigued and inspired by her experiences. She suffered homelessness, stints in mental institutions, group homes and had to give up her daughter... it's hard to imagine a more difficult life in this modern world, but she seems like she took it all in stride.

This doc runs nearly 90 minutes and as great as it is, I wish there was more. Every time I see this film I am left wanting more. There are some extreme situations, nudity and lewd subject matter, but hey, it's a movie about a punk rock life. If you enjoy punk rock, are intrigued and fascinated by extreme lives or just want to be entertained, this is for you!  5 Stars!",1343088000,,1419,4.367424242424242
8495756,5,B006A9XTRQ,"An informative, chilling and sad tale of the life of a legend, how it all began, and how it ended. The story portrays her wants, needs, failures and success. Thought-provoking and touching from start to finish. The Quality of the film is top-notch, the story will grab the viewers attention as it tugs on the heart-strings. Recommended for Adult viewers only. A haunting Biography that will make you ponder in this provocative and heart-wrenching story!",1340755200,5,453,5.053333333333334

This documentary details the tumultuous life of punk rock ""goddess"" singer/dominatrix/stripper Marian Anderson. I enjoyed the film even though I never heard of this person. Clearly, Marian's corner of the California hardcore scene never traveled in any significant way to us here on the east coast. Marian was w/ a variety of bands in her short life (dead @ 33). She was statuesque and beautiful while being a total exhibitionist on stage. Have always loved punk, but some of Marian's onstage behavior entered the Rated X Zone. And not in a good way IMO. Because of her seriously explicit activities in the public eye, Marian got herself arrested for ""human indecency"" just like Jim Morrison.

There are two negative sides to this film. One, the music. Two, most of the people in the film. Marian was charismatic certainly, but every other person in this hour and one-half film was totally forgettable. None of the music is particularly engaging, just grating, which is probably the point.  Hardcore is up in your face hostile and angry, and for the most part it was a guy's game - both  audience and musicians.

Frankly I didn't really witness anything in this film to qualify the ""Punk Goddess"" label used in this DVD's title. On one hand, you have to admire the sheer guts and audaciousness of any female who could do such craziness on stage while being barely clothed.  (It's no surprise when Marian tells the camera that Wendy O. Williams was one of her role models.)

After watching this doc, I asked myself, ""were any of these performances special in anyway?"" Not so sure, because most of the time, it just felt like venting.",1334016000,10,1658,4.796491228070176
8495758,5,B006A9XTRQ,"Every misfit has a story. Very few of them ever get told, and even fewer get immortalized on film, but this one did. This is a fine film, and to me it holds a special interest since I come from the same town as it's subject: Marian Anderson. I didn't know her at all but we crossed paths at random intervals and had mutual friends.

This film was done with a lot care and respect for Marian. She was abused by her father at a young age, which resulted in her living and working on the fringes of society, namely the sex industry. This film walks a fine line between telling it like it is and exploiting the shocking aspects of her life and her art, but it's all told from a place of understanding. There's a fair amount of adults-only images and references, but things are toned down enough to get an R rating. I think it works better this way. It's less GG Allin-esque. But I still think it's too candid for the Documentary Channel.

Like I said, every misfit has a story, and Marian's is a war story. There's no happy ending. This film portrays real life, real punk, and real chaos. Not everyone will get it. If you're too privileged, or if you lack insight into child abuse, this film may not be for you. But if you have an interest in small town punk history (Modesto, CA) or happen to be a warrior yourself, this is essential viewing. And don't let the big names scare you (Henry Rollins, Tim Armstrong, etc.). This is not a watered down pop culture affair.",1332374400,20,1462,4.3127272727272725
