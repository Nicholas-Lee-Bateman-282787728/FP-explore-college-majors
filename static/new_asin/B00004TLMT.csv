Plus, in this volume, you get to see two evil demons which are cleverly designed. You get a cute nurse who tries to seduce our main hero and a cool old guy who uses sicles to fight. Wow! And the fight scenes are intense and make it a bargain... The dub only makes things greater with notable voices doing great lines. By far, if you haven't seen this extremely intense show, see it now. It has everything. Its like watching a TV series of Wicked City. And I am not making an overstatement. Its just that cool. Buy this now and be amazed!",981072000,,665,4.328
