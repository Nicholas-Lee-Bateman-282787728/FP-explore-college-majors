2527251,5,B000EQ5PZK,"Chuck Norris's Walker Texas Ranger borrow a lot from his film Lone Wolf Mcquad. Created for television and for Norris himself. This was like mini movies for Norris

The idea of Norris in the mold of a martal arts /John wayne style lawman works. Norris, as Steve McQueen taught him, does not say much, let the action do the talking is showcased here in first season of Walker.

so is the box set worth it? YES-great TV without the commerials. However there are NO extras-SOMEONE should  interviews, audio commentary and the behind the scene stuff these DVD are known for would be nice. I woulds have like even a tribute to Noble Willingham) who died of cancer after the last walker episode aired

When is season two coming?

Until I got into ""Walker Texas Ranger"" I hadnt really cared for 'Mr. Norris'. as I am not much of a martial arts fan.

I intend to purchase The entire series of it on DVD from Amazon.  1 Thing I Love about Amazon,  """"Being retired & on a fixed income, I can build my collection of each Seasons ""From the New & Used format"" .And I get Top Quality DVDs & save $$ also. I purchased my Entire Seasons of ""Jag"", The Sopranos And ""The Waltons""  this way through Amazon.  And am Now working on ""Walker"".

2527343,5,B000EQ5PZK,"My brother has always been a huge Walker fan. Me not at all. So I avoided it while he watched it. When I got my first Scottish terrier puppy my brother's comment was he looks like Walker. I couldn't see then what he meant.

Now I know after watching the First season of Walker. My Scottie was short, with a full beard, and a lot of swagger. He never let any bigger dog intimidate him. He would never back down. I had to walk his foolhardy self him away from the likes of St Bernards, Rotties, and Danes. All dogs he could walk easily walk under. Maybe being raised with a German shepherd gave him grandiose ideas.

Anyway getting back to the real Walker it took me over twenty years to discover what my brother has known all this time....what a great series this turned out to be. I had to eat crow and admit to my brother that he'd been right all along--darn him!

I was lucky enough to have this First Season available at my local library. I was so impressed l ordered the remaining Seven seasons from Amazon. I'm expecting delivery on Monday, January 5th. What a way to ring in the 2015 New Year!!

Now every time I see someone put the tailgate of their pickup truck down I think of Walker.",1420070400,,1193,4.265486725663717

2527378,4,B000EQ5PZK,"This police drama that ran on CBS from 1993-01 revived Chuck Norris' acting career when Norris's movie career stalled and the series catapulted him to international icon status of David Hasselhoff proportions. Norris has since been transformed into an affectionate punchline for the likes of Conan O'Brien.

WALKER, TEXAS RANGER is a tailor-made vehicle for Norris, whose eponymous character dispenses somewhat suspect justice. ""You screwed up,"" one particularly nasty miscreant tells Walker. ""You forgot to read us our rights. Walker obliges, but not before kicking him into submission, ""You have the right to remain silent."" Walker's methods may perturb Asst. District Attorney, Alex Cahill (Sheree J. Wilson), but they sure come in handy when she is menaced, Cape Fear-style, by the recently freed corrupt sheriff she sent to jail (""Borderline"") or kidnapped by a cult leader

There are 3 crucial elements for a great Walker episode: A particularly vile villain such as drug dealers, rapists, corrupt politicians, coolly delivered Chuck-isms (""When I want your opinion, I'll beat it out of you,"" used in Norris' flick CODE OF SILENCE, and, to quote his faithful sidekick, Jimmy Trivette (Clarence Gilyard), Walker's new, more by-the-book partner, the ""squinty-eyed make-my-day stuff"" that Walker punishingly dispenses near the 40-minute mark of nearly every episode.

When you've got Chuck Norris, you don't need A-list guest stars, but Walker's 1st Season features some familiar faces, including *the future Spider-Man Tobey Maguire (""The Prodigal Son"")
*Stuart Whitman (""The Reunion"")
*post-Wonder Years Danica ""Winnie"" McKellar (""Stolen Lullaby"").

Norris may not be Oscar or Emmy material, but watching Walker unfailingly lay out the bad guys and making the guilty pay is the essence of comfort television. As Trivette says, ""I hate to admit; the man is good."" In short: don't mess with Texas!

It's also nice to be able to see all these episodes of WALKER TEXAS RANGER commercial-free & uncut without all those deleted scenes you got on TV Land, WGN, Hallmark Channel, and USA too.",1401840000,,2089,5.376146788990826

I have also watched every episode on tv and am an avid fan of the show. The first season has the two hour pilot which was great. It was about a series of bank robberies. This Dvd set has all 26 episodes of season one. This show might and might not be suited for young children the choice is yours I watched it when I was young that was when I first started watching it and it never really bothered me. Walker is not rated. It does have a lot of action in it. There is not a lot of bad language in it but has some in it. It is a must get for Walker fans!

2527453,5,B000EQ5PZK,"In the early 90's, the ever popular martial arts master and action movie star Chuck Norris was not getting many offers for movies. An idea sparked in someone's mind, and Norris was offered the title role for a show called ""Walker Texas Ranger"", he accepted it, and an entirely new legend was born. This show is most likely what makes Norris best known to today's modern audience. I do not see this show as silly, or stupid, or so dumb that it's good, or anything like that. I sincerely, genuinely, and truthfully see it as a great show. The plots are original and imaginitive. This show also starred Sheree J. Wilson as Assistant District Attorney Alex Cahill, Clarence Gilyard Jr. as Sergeant James Trivette, (Walker's partner in the Texas Rangers), and last but not least, Noble Willingham as C.D. Parker, whose bar was a common meetingplace for the main cast. I am now officially debunking the endless theories that every episode contains the same elements - Alex, Walker, Trivette, or C.D. is kidnapped, Walker transforms into legendary Texas Ranger Hayes Cooper, etc. First of all, in many of the episodes, Alex is not kidnapped, not to mention that she sometimes is barely even if not at all in the episode. Second, Hayes Cooper does not appear until the second season (actually the third season). Do not judge this show by what you have heard from others. Believe me when I say that the show is one-of-a-kind, and it is truly awesome in every way. When you do watch it, if you're like me, you will be bending your ear to every line for one of those well known Chuck-isms, such as ""If I wanted a confession, I'd beat it out of you."" Great storytelling, acting, and action is what made this show what it is. Don't miss it! Below is a list of episodes included in this seven-disc DVD set.

THIS REVIEW IS DEDICATED TO ANYONE, LIVING OR DEAD, INVOLVED IN THE MAKING OF ""WALKER TEXAS RANGER"".",1211587200,10,2677,4.541841004184101
2527454,5,B000EQ5PZK,"It's fashionable these days, I suppose, to scoff at a television show like Walker - Texas Ranger because it promoted traditional values.

I suppose that following the exploits of Paris Hilton or Britney Spears is far more ""hip"".

But Walker - Texas Ranger had a very successful 9 year run, despite the fact that the critics universally panned it for its one dimensional characters (the ""good guys"" really were good guys and they always triumphed in the end), the network buried it in a Saturday night slot (traditionally the dead zone for a televsion show)and did nothing to promote it.

But the viewing public watched and enjoyed it for a very long time because each week, you were the recipient of a good story with a very likeable cast of characters led, of couse, by the title character Cordell Walker Texas Ranger.

Each week, Walker,a Texas Ranger cut in the mold of John Wayne, successfully used his investigative and martial arts skills to bring down the bad guys, who were engaged in everything from drugs to good old fashioned cattle rustling in modern-day Texas.

OK - so the guy isn't Lawrence Olivier in terms of his acting ability and the diversity / range of emotions he was required to convey each episode. But he was very, very believable as a resolute and unstoppable force of justice and fair play.

Walker was ably assisted by a supporting cast including Jimmy Trivette, an ex-Dallas Cowboys football player, who turned in his helmet for a badge, Alex Cahill, an assistant district attorney, who provided the love interest for Walker in the latter seasons and CD Parker, an retired Texas Ranger, whose watering hole was the favorite haunt of Walker, Trivette and Cahill in their off-hours. Sadly Noble Winningham (CD Parker) died of cancer during the run of the show.

The show oftentimes was a platform for a number of different issues that Chuck Norris was personally involved in, primarily the fight against drugs and providing healthier lifestyle choices for younger kids who were at risk.

It's easy to be a cynic and laugh at the show's efforts to address these issues. But I'll give Chuck Norris and the producers of the show full marks for not caving in to the critics and trying to create something alittle more ""fashionable"" just to appease them.

The fact is that the show lasted 9 seasons, a long run by television standards so there must have been alot of very ""unfashionable, unhip"" people who were very appreciative of a show which promoted the types of values that it did.

Thanks Chuck and cast for a alot of enjoyment watching this great series.

And thans to CBS Video for releasing this series on DVD - I own every season released so far and have spent countless hours enjoying these episodes all over again.",1211241600,15,2748,4.7642105263157895
2527455,5,B000EQ5PZK,These Walker Texas Ranger movies are action packed and very good to watch. We have watched the tv series over and over again and enjoy being able to watch them when we want to. Thank you and Awsome Chuch Norris,1200096000,2,210,4.275
2527456,5,B000EQ5PZK,Walker Texas Ranger . This is a great DVD collection karate kicking beatin up on the drug lords and the rest of the bad guys . This DVD is great family entertainment . Its too bad they don't have more of these types of shows .,1190937600,,226,3.9347826086956523

2527458,5,B000EQ5PZK,"This is THE classic ""it's so bad it's good"" TV show. While it frightens me somewhat that a lot of the glowing reviews on here are not the least bit tongue in cheek (silent red state majority, THERE you are!), watching a Walker episode has to be one of the most entertaining ways for a modern creature to spend 50 minutes of their time. The producers couldn't have made this show any more awful had their lives depended on it and therein lies the glory! Bad acting, ridiculous story lines, good and evil clearly separated into one dimensional oversimplifications, this is definitely not a program for any thinking person who (tragically) lacks a sense of the crippling irony inherent in life that is simultaneously hilarious and heartbreaking. That you have simple, sadsack souls out there in bumble#$%* America honestly getting off on the cornball morality lessons and good old ""eye for an eye"" vigilante stuff that this show spews out by the ton while at the same time others of us are laughing until we can't breathe at the unfathomable inanity and mindboggling fact that this show was actually produced for 8 years to me sums up the staggering beauty of being alive.

Ah, unintentional humor is often exponentially funnier than the best joke. Ladies and gentleman, I give you Exhibit A: Walker, Texas Ranger!

P.S. And to you serious fans out there in Arkadelphia who don't watch this for yucks wondering why it took so long to come out on DVD, you can probably thank Conan O'Brien and those of like mind for the new hipness of this sacred monstrosity.",1184284800,,1555,4.734317343173432

2527460,5,B000EQ5PZK,"The only part of this set that isn't good is that the theme song that we all came to know and love for this show wasn't part of it yet. Other than that, this show is what kept my family watching for the full run.

  As Walker, Norris found the roll he was born to play. With the belief that Justice should be served no matter what, Walker fought the good fight every week to keep the streets clean. Thank you Mr. Norris and company for giving us this great show.",1177113600,,462,4.054945054945055
2527461,5,B000EQ5PZK,"I love all the episodes of Walker. It is fun to watch. I think part of what made Walker so good was that Chuck Norris and the writers, directors, etc., really understood what many Americans wanted to see. We want to see the good guys win! I watch these episodes over and over. I miss the series.  Maybe they will consider doing a movie down the road to ""let us see what happened to everybody."" This would be great!",1176163200,3,414,4.2405063291139244

2527463,5,B000EQ5PZK,"These shows are compelling viewing, you cant turn away from them in case you miss something. They are a great tribute to a great man.....and promote public awareness about a lot of issues and alternate lifestyles than those of our own. Wonderful, just wish they would release the other series quicker, we have been waiting a long time for them.",1173312000,2,344,4.75

2527465,5,B000EQ5PZK,I bought this season for my father for Christmas and he just loves it I honestly believe that it was the best gift I have thus far given to him.  He never was able to watch it on TV due to the time schedule so owning the first season makes it much easier to view the espisode at his convinience.  This is a great product and would recommend it to anyone who is a Walker Texas Ranger fan.,1169078400,3,387,3.948717948717949

2527468,5,B000EQ5PZK,"I have all of Chuck Norris's movies, and I would highly recommend This TV series. There is not an episode in this season that is not worth watching. If Norris had not began his acting career in films, This would surely have placed him there after the series ended. Besides great action episodes, there are some really touching ones as well. This is a must have for all Chuck norris fans.",1168300800,,387,4.464788732394366
2527469,3,B000EQ5PZK,"Took me a while to like this.

I've seen Walker on TV but I found the later series better.

I actually got the DVD because in the later episodes, Walker had an interesting holster - wasn't so much of a holster as a ring for his gun.

Back to the shows.

Plots were Ok.

Like the way the shows have a moral.

Think the show gets better later on but worth getting this as it gives a nice introduction, especially how Walker didn't like his sidekick.",1162684800,,447,4.1395348837209305

8112662,5,B000EQ5PZK,"High quality video and very well packaged. Although this is an old series, I like the theme of criminal justice portrayed in the series. It's great to see Walker in action, the other main characters are very likable too. Nothing too overwhelming. Always a good fight with fiery kicks from Walker. No bad language.",1494806400,3,313,4.814814814814815

8112664,5,B000EQ5PZK,"I  enjoy  this  season.  Its  the  season  where  CD  Parker  is  still  a  Texas  ranger,  &  is  about  to  retire.  &  the  one  who takes  is  his  place  is  Jimmy  Trivette.  Walker  cleans  house  in  this  season,  protects  a  country  singer  from  her  ex  husband,  Takes  down  drug lords,  stops  cattle  rustlers,  handles  crooked  cops  &  more.
I  like  the  theme  song  at  the  beginning  of  the  show,  its  too  bad  it  wasn't  used  in  seasons  2  or  3  as  well.
This  guy  keeps  bringing  a  lesson  to  the  bad  guys,  even  when  they  fail  to  get  the  message.  He'll  never  stop  until  the  bad  guys  are  arrested  &  brought  to  justice.
Season  1  is  great!",1490918400,,704,4.129310344827586
