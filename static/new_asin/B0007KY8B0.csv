8047865,3,B0007KY8B0,"Good production. This DVD addresses key teenage issues such as marijuana, alcohol and peer pressure. Though I really liked the fact that the DVD highlighted the ill effects of drugs and alcohol on the body, I felt the language used was too technical for pre-teens and younger teens. Nevertheless a good DVD.",1176249600,,307,4.923076923076923
