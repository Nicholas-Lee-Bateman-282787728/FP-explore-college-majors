6760152,1,B00OTADF9A,"don't get me wrong, i give Jeff Dunham's performance 5 stars.  He is hysterically funny as always, especially the bit with Akmed.

6760214,5,B00OTADF9A,"I love most of what Dunham does, and this one is no exception.  What is puzzling, however, is that Amazon says this DVD was released December 9, 2014, when the actual program dates from 2008.  I had seen a Jeff Dunham Christmas video a few years ago, owned by someone else, and thought this was a brand-new video.  Turns out this is what I saw back then.  I remembered some of the content, but not enough to make it an issue.  I just don't understand why Amazon claims it was released in December 2014, when that isn't true.  Even if this was the first DVD release (which seems doubtful), why can't they indicate the date of the content along with the date the media was released?  The former is of much more interest to me.
