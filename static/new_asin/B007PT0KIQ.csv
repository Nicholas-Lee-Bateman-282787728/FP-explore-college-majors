8520648,3,B007PT0KIQ,"I like Scud's work. I really do. However, this is not his best.

The problem I have with Love Actually... Sucks is the same problem I had with Robert Altman's Nashville; a large group of characters are treated superficially instead of just a few being explored in-depth. Three of the stories deserved to be fleshed out in their feature films.

Still, it is well done and beautifully shot.",1485043200,2,388,4.6911764705882355
8520649,4,B007PT0KIQ,"So far I have seen all of Scud's films and never been disappointed. From the opening wedding scene to the trial wrap-up at the end, I was again entertained by the movie itself. Obsessive love, same-sex love, inter-generational, unrequited, romantic, commercial or incestual - they all sucked. Sometimes humorously, sometimes literally but always interestingly at least for me.
My only complaint is the menuless, sceneless, extras-less DVD-R format. I should have waited for the Blue-Ray. So only 4 stars as shipped.",1350777600,4,515,5.37037037037037
8520650,4,B007PT0KIQ,"Very representative of the filmmaker's work. Actors are very sexy. A bit too sophisticated, but the film is worth to be seen.",1349827200,,125,4.7272727272727275
8520651,4,B007PT0KIQ,"But the movie it self. It's cute. Well acted, it hold its own. I enjoyed 'Love Actually sucks'. Entertaining beautiful  shots of Hong Kong.",1349654400,,139,4.791666666666667
