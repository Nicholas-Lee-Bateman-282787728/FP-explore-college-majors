Overall, I am glad that I watched it and being in the beginning stages of adoption, it may mean more to me in a few years.  And it may be just what my adopted child needs to see.  It was sweet and positive-something that we need more of in adoption media.",1209945600,,376,4.3428571428571425
8624217,5,B00020M0LK,"This film is awesome and just goes to show that adoption can be a wonderful experience for everyone involved. Having giving up a child for adoption, it has been a wonderful experience. It was the best thing I could have done for that child, knowing that this child has all the love in the world, and is being cared for and couldn't ask for a better family. I loved this film and have let friends borrow it, that have been adopted or have adopted children. I tell everyone about it that mentions adoption.",1130284800,2,504,4.43010752688172

I saw this film at it's premiere and couldn't get the kids, the music and it's wonderful message out of my head. If you or your family has been touched by adoption, you won't want to miss this film. What a great gift this will make at holiday time for friends whose families are formed through adoption. This film is a positive, thoughtful and honest look at adoption- you hear the voice of the children and the birth mother, from whom the loving journey of adoption begins!",1082937600,4,539,4.56701030927835
