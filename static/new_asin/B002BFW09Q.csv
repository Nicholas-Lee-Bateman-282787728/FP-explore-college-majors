8361341,4,B002BFW09Q,"Fernando Ezequiel Solanas, born in 1936, is an outstanding Argentine documentarist. His first feature film La Hora de los Hornos (The Hour of the Furnaces, co-directed in 1968 with Octavio Getino) is an excellent documentary on neocolonialism, violence and exploitation in Latin America, in fact a revisionist take on the whole history of the region. Filmed and shown clandestinely during a military dictatorship, the film was screened around the world and won several international awards.

Solanas was a founder of the Grupo Cine Liberacin. This group proposed a new path for Argentine cinema, independent of, or opposite to the studio system (which had a rich history in Argentina, beginning in the silent era) and of the ""auteur"", heavily intellectual, European inspired movement that took hold in the period 1956-1975. Together with Getino, Solanas wrote the manifesto  ""Toward a Third Cinema"" which inspired film makers in developing countries in South America and other regions for many years.  Solanas went on to film many other outstanding documentaries (the last in 2011) dealing mostly with recent Latin American history.

Solanas had a parallel career as a fiction filmmaker, although ""fiction"" has a relative meaning here; his movies are always informed by Argentine political and economic reality in the recent past. His style is poetic, intensely personal and at times surrealistic, incorporating musical and dance numbers and mixing freely reality and fantasy, with characters from different eras interacting, both dead and alive. His works in this area are Tangos, the Exile of Gardel (1985), The South (1988), The Journey (1992) and The Cloud (1998). Tangos deals with the plight of exiles during the Argentine Dirty War of 1973-1982. Filmed in Paris and Buenos Aires, it attained popularity both in Europe and in Argentine. The South, although not as popular is perhaps Solanas' best fiction work. It deals with the victims of the Dirty War (both the dead and the survivors) and the plight of their relatives. Excellent acting by Sus Pecoraro, Miguel ngel Sol, Philippe Lotard and a very good supporting cast. Haunting cinematography by Flix Monti. Director Solanas is also credited with production design, art direction (with Hermenegildo Sabat) and music (with Astor Piazzola). Popular tango singer Roberto Goyeneche sings and acts.

It is unfortunate that this film is not presently available in DVD Region 1 format.",1336348800,,2438,5.338541666666667
