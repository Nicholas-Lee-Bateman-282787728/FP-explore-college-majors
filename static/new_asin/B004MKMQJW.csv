4430270,3,B004MKMQJW,"This is the entertainment business, and you know, they try, but probably the most entertaining thing about this movie was how it came to be. There are a lot of great films based on books, and even more great books deserving film adaptations, but rather than take a literary success and bring it to the big screen, Dreamworks decided to buy the rights to, of all things, I Am Number Four. Oh yeah, and they purchased them a year before it was even published! All because James Frey, author of A Million Little Pieces, decided to start a fiction franchise that pumps out books and movies that could be marketed to teens.

But hey, why not? It was bound to be a success. A young man escapes a planet just as it's being destroyed, ending up in a quaint town in Kansas Ohio where he attempts to live a normal life, only to find that he possesses superpowers, which really throw a kink in his small-town romance. That exact story has already worked out once -- why not a second time? All you need to do is get the creators of Smallville to write the script, toss in some beautiful people and a few Michael Bay explosions, and you've got yourself a hit.

I Am Number Four opens on a scene of said beautiful people partying at the beach. Our hero, John Smith (Alex Pettyfer), is having a blast with all his buddies, and even gets invited to a sexy swim with the school hottie, where she delivers such lovely dialogue as ""The big dipper. It's my favorite."" I doubt she could even name another constellation, but that's neither here nor there, because suddenly a scar on John's leg emits a blinding light, signaling that Number Three is dead. For some reason that may or may not be explained in the book but certainly isn't in the movie, the survivors of planet Lorien can only be killed in order, so it's time for Number Four to go on the run. He and his protector, Henri (Timothy Olyphant, whose last name always reminds me of Lord of the Rings), burn all their belongings and hit the road, but an eeeeevil gecko sneaks onto their truck.

Their flight leads them to Paradise, Ohio, where the gecko turns into a cute puppy...of DEATH! At least, that's what I kept expecting. But when the puppy passed up numerous opportunities to transform into a horrible monster and slay everyone, I ended up just being pretty confused about why they built up so much suspense.
Puppies aren't the only danger in Paradise, however. There's also Sarah (Dianna Agron), the school sweetheart. There's an alliterative joke in there somewhere. Something like ""dogs are dangerous, but nothing can match the peril of the..."" I don't know, some word for cat.

Anyway, Sarah is an irresistible clich, the blonde who dated the quarterback of the football team until she picked up photography, thus gaining a lens into the soul and learning the true meaning of love. At least the quarterback is original, except for the fact that he beats up science nerds and can't understand why Sarah doesn't want him and hates John for moving in on his territory. And the science nerd isn't just a science nerd. He happens to have a dad who was totally abducted by aliens so he's obsessed with rooting out all extraterrestrials at the school. All this is nothing at all like Smallville, because in that show, the blonde photographer is the same person who wants to root out the mystery behind the alien occurrences, and a different character is the love interest.

I feel bad bashing this formula so much, because I have to admit, the characters really were hot, which is what really matters. Dianna Agron of Glee fame is a girl next door of no compare, and Alex Pettyfer is, undeniably, a beautiful piece of man. I mean, in his next movie, he literally plays a guy whose main character trait is that he's really really ridiculously good looking. Based on that alone, I figured I'd be able to enjoy their romance, but man, was I wrong. This was supposed to be a superhero movie, darn it, and we end up sitting through more than an hour of plodding romance with no action whatsoever. And it's not good romance either. It's just like Twilight: all meaningful looks, lip biting, and a thirst for blood.

Maybe not the last one so much, but when this movie wasn't Smallville, it really was Twilight. The main guy has a secret that makes him an outsider at the school, but a beautiful girl is intrigued by his mystery and they fall for each other. And Loriens, unlike humans, only fall in love once and it lasts. Isn't it romantic? Blehck. Males everywhere will squirm in their seats. On the other hand, it's a perfect date movie. The guys will be excited to go, the girls will acquiesce, and then the girls will be so pleasantly surprised by the fact that the guy took them to a chick flick that they're sure to sleep with them. Except studies show that scary movies are much more likely to get you laid, so oh well.

Although the whole first hour had me teetering on the edge of boredom, what's scary is how much I actually ended up liking the movie, because, you see, the last 20 minutes kick so much ass! The action sequence is the only place you feel like Michael Bay was attached to this, and it shows. Number Six (Teresa Palmer) arrives, and she's this hot, sarcastic Aussie girl with wavy blonde hair who can kill the evil Mogadorians like nobody's business and deliver one-liners right after. She slides on her knees, hamstringing baddies while Number Four deflects plasma gun blasts with his hands, shooting them back at his foes. Six can turn invisible and teleport and generate a fire shield and all this sick stuff. Which brings up the question, why is John's main superpower the ability to turn his hands into flashlights? I mean, like, I guess that would be sort of useful, but I'd way rather be able to turn invisible. The movie has to find all these excuses to have the battles take place in dark places so that John's power is useful, and it's amusing to see how often they work it in.

Number Six was so cool that she saved the movie. The fact that she arrived at the end meant that I left feeling super stoked, which colored my whole experience with such a positive light that I couldn't help but enjoy myself. I don't know why she wasn't in the movie the entire time. Having someone fun and sarcastic was exactly what the plot needed to keep it from taking itself, and the romance, way too seriously.

So, way too much slow, clumsy romance (and don't get me wrong. I love Titanic and The Notebook), and not nearly enough action, but the premise is good enough (even if it's stolen straight from Superman), and when the fighting actually starts, it's awesome (explosions, fireballs, plasma guns, giant winged monsters). If they made a sequel, I would definitely see it. Therefore, I give I Am Number Four:

3/5 Stars

Why did John decide to reveal himself to so many people in Paradise? The film made it look like he'd had a ton of close friends at his old school, but the second they found out about him, he fled. Within days of moving to Ohio, he was willing to confide in all sorts of people. Seems pretty fickle for a Lorien who's supposed to bond forever, but maybe that same fickleness will mean that Number Six is a love interest later. Who wouldn't pick Number Six over Sarah? Honestly.

4430271,4,B004MKMQJW,"I liked this movie.  I was expecting a lot of action sequences.  What I was surprised to get was a story first.  It's not an Academy Award winner, but I didn't go to see that type of movie.  I'm an action movie type of girl and this one did the trick.  I'd recommend it and definitely gonna buy it on DVD when it comes out.",1298160000,2,323,3.9076923076923076
4430272,4,B004MKMQJW,"Another winner by D.J Caruso. I never read the Ya novel it's based on, but from what I read, it adapts the source well.

This is a solid, fresh, action sci-fi flick combining a lot of elements from alien genre we've seen. The story with Loriens and Mogadorians is interesting.

The story is pretty straightforward: Aliens called Loriens have different powers, ""legacies"" and are being hunted down by the Mogadorians.  The Mogs killing the Loriens will also enable them to take over the Earth.

The performances for this movie are all solid from Timothy Olyphant (Justified), Jake Abel (Supernatural), Alex Pettyfer, and Diana Agron. Very good performances, the actors do a good job of making the characters very real.

Action is good, drama is good, a lot of comedy too. D.J. Caruso is a good director, so this is another winner in his belt of very entertaining flicks. It's aimed, yes at a young audience, but I think anybody who enjoys fun sci-fi flicks will want to watch this one regardless of their age.",1297987200,20,1008,4.7701149425287355
4430273,2,B004MKMQJW,"You've probably seen the ads for I Am Number Four. The TV spots seem to be interesting and confusing at the same time since they leave you with more questions than anything, which can be a good thing. Trailers that reveal everything about the film they're promoting are the worst. However, Michael Bay's involvement (despite only being a producer) probably puts many off right from the start considering all the Platinum Dunes remakes Bay has produced over the years; effectively killing whatever interest they may have originally had. Unfortunately the film seems to leave you with just as many questions that you walked in with.

I Am Number Four is based on the novel sharing the same name by Pittacus Lore (the pen name for authors James Frey and Jobie Hughes). It's also supposed to be the first in a six-part series. The film version of I Am Number Four feels like it doesn't explain half of the things it needs to. The film leaves you with quite a few unanswered questions and while it's obvious a sequel will more than likely be on the cards if the film is a success, I Am Number Four doesn't really feel like an origin story. Well, it actually feels like you walked into an origin story about twenty minutes too late like you missed the entire backstory or something. Interestingly enough, half of the questions you may have can probably be answered with the Wikipedia page for the novel. Why the film doesn't touch on some of these is kind of a mystery though.

The film also left me feeling questionable regarding my opinion of the film. There were certain parts that were enjoyable, but it also felt kind of terrible at the same time. The film revolved around high school more than expected. It felt like the film could've easily been called something like, ""My high school boyfriend glows in the dark and I don't know why."" The whole sideplot of Sam's father seemed kind of pointless, as well. So he discovered Loriens and decided to help them before disappearing. Why should we care? That's never really explained. Sam finally realizing his dad's fantasy becoming a reality and his desire to find him made sense, but why the film had to keep coming back to his dad helping the aliens only for it to go nowhere just seemed unnecessary.

The action scenes are probably the film's highlight. Surprising for a film produced by Michael Bay, eh? Loud, a heavy use of special effects, and explosions and massive destruction around every corner are enough to satisfy even the most deprived action junkie. But the shaky camera technique rears its ugly head to ruin something decent yet again. Whipping the camera back and forth probably didn't help matters either. It was the first special effects heavy film for D.J. Caruso though, so maybe that had something to do with it. Speaking of special effects and awkward camera techniques, the Mogadorians' beasts look incredibly similar to the Cloverfield monster if it had flying squirrel capabilities. The battle scenes between John's shape-shifting beagle Bernie Kosar and one of the beasts is both sour and sweet at the same time. The Godzilla fan in me loved the fact that I got to see two giant monsters fighting each other, but the logical side in me basically reminded me that I was watching a glorified version of the ending to Van Helsing, which isn't a compliment at all.

The cast isn't the greatest, but it gets the job done. Most of the chemistry in the film is shared between Alex Pettyfer and Dianna Agron since the love between their characters is basically the central theme of the story. Although, the two of them seem rather dull on their own. John swears up and down he knows how to ""be invisible"" and ""blend in,"" so that obviously means being as conspicuous as you can possibly be. Wearing a hood when no one else is and flashing lights that reside in your hands probably isn't the best way to try and go unnoticed. Meanwhile, Sarah has a thing for cameras and that's about it. Callan McAuliffe's Sam plays the rather cliche nerdy guy fairly well while the same can be said for Jake Abel's typical jock/scumbag character Mark. Timothy Olyphant is easily the best part of the cast, but still felt a little flat overall. However, he spits out a few speeches that steal whatever scene he's a part of.

I Am Number Four probably isn't a good film at the end of the day, but it does have some good elements and will be mistakenly perceived as a good film because of them. If you're a fan of explosive sci-fi action sequences, it is probably worth seeing for that reason alone. The film's biggest downfall is that it's rather confusing at times if you haven't read the book and the film does a rather haphazard job of getting first time viewers up to speed. However, if you can somehow see it for cheap then it isn't the absolute worst way to waste two hours.",1297987200,6,4826,4.633177570093458
4430274,5,B004MKMQJW,Dying for a sequel. The premise could actually make a pretty good tv show.  Why have they never made another movie for this?  Love it!,1521158400,2,134,4.32

4430279,2,B004MKMQJW,"First, Alex Pettyfer, the protagonist cannot act.  He emoted the entire time. For this to work you needed to believe in the main character but you got nothing from Pettyfer.  Additionally the plot of this movie was totally ripped off from a 1970s show on NBC called the powers of matthew star. That show, had a much better plot.  There a crown prince from another planet, who had powers as the royal family did, was sent to earth to hide until his powers made him strong enough to return and fight the bad guys who held his planet hostage.  He, and his protector, ran while matthew was young and vulnerable until matthew decided to stay put and fight after meeting a girl (and he was slowly getting powers) so it wasn't unreasonable.  Here there are ten refugees of a planet all with various ""legacies"" / powers. The bad guys have managed to kill three though all of them have ""protectors""...  we pick up number four as number three is killed and he runs again. But this time he meets a girl. Of course she is the MOST cliche' girl ever. Pretty but also a rebel because she takes photos... number four falls for her and incurs the wrath of the bully she used to date.  Finally Four decides he wants to stay because of the girl, before he knows anything about his powers or legacies. Of course.  Not too bright. The baddies come and number four would have been toast but for number six who shows up and basically runs the show -- but number six is like some sort of all knowing god while four can hardly tie his shoes.  It is unclear at the end of this movie exactly what these refugees are all bout. Another serious problem with this move is that number six and the girl number four loves look very much alike. It seems odd from a casting perspective. They should have had one of them die their hair.",1520726400,,1800,4.365269461077844
4430280,5,B004MKMQJW,"Loved this movie as it exceeded my expectations.  Better than the more recent superhero movies including the latest Superman movies.  This movie included romance, coming of age situations, unknown superpowers, heroic sensations, aliens, action, good vs. bad, humor, excellent special effects, nice scenery, sexy people, etc.  Everything you want in a superhero movie, it's in this movie.  Great cast and acting.  The movie is about aliens, good and bad, that have landed on Earth.  The alien planet was invaded by the bad aliens and the good guys sent nine good ones with special powers.  The first three have been chased down and killed by the bad aliens.  Now, they are after number 4.  He must remain anonymous, but at the same time he wants to come out of the closet sort of speak as he wants to live among the humans.  Every time someone discovers something odd about him, he has to move to a new place.  One moment he's living on beach front property and the next, he has to move to a small local town.  While there, he decides to attend high school to keep himself busy, but of course he meets new people, some who like him and others don't.  Besides having to watch his back for aliens, he's got to deal with humans who can sometimes be mean and nasty.  As he is maturing, he's learning about his culture and that he has new powers, but he has to learn to control his powers.  He's doing his best to be human as much as being an alien, but it's quite a struggle as he has to deal with mean jocks and falling for a jock's ex-girlfriend.  The movie has a few moments of humor or cuteness, but it's mainly a science fiction action movie with romance.  Great movie and it would be great if they made sequels for this movie as I would like to see the remaining good aliens and how number 4 continues to live on Earth.",1520640000,,1820,4.4174174174174174

The lead character, played by Alex Pettyfor, shows ample emotional depth and range for someone running for his life from alien forces trying to snuff out his power and potential in saving his home planet...the fact there are several other exiles still to be found means the story has infinite possibilities. I didn't care for the portrayal of the alien villains. They seemed fake and over the top. But the other actors did a good job, especially Timothy Olyphant and the young man who is #4's nemesis.

Cheesy dialogue and character development.  Too much time spent on the cliche' high school trials and tribulations (jock vs. unpopular kid, new kid hero facing off against the athletes while protecting unpopular kid, hero's love interest is the jock's ex with a jumping/kidnapping/stalking theme, jock's dad is the local cop, but jock and hero make up in the end)

Stopped reading and watched the movie. It took me three go's... I needed to rest in between watching it because it just didn't work for me. The book was faster paced. Honestly, I was so happy when the movie ended and I didn't have to watch it anymore.
Okay, I really do not like movies where, in the end, it is obvious that ""this was Part 1, stay tuned for Part 2"".
When I started reading ""I Am Number Four"", I had seen that there were follow-ups, but ""I Am Number Four"" was enough by itself. Now that I have seen the movie, I pretty sure I don't want to read the follow-up books.",1500336000,,794,4.096153846153846

4430351,4,B004MKMQJW,"Three and a half RELENTLESS Stars. The interesting and enjoyable SciFi action/adventure film, I AM NUMBER FOUR, is a Y/A adventure about alien teenagers with humanoid features, hiding on earth from pursuers who can kill them but only in a special way. For their part, both groups are very unique. The action begins right away as the plot starts with a jungle encounter but soon jumps to other locations. Its the Lors evading the Mogs in this adventure story aimed at young adults, with some surprising twists & turns and excellent CGI along the way. Starring Alex Pettyfer, Timothy Olyphant, Teresa Palmer, Dianna Agron, Callan McAuliffe, and Kevin Durand. Directed by D.J. Caruso. Very Definitely Recommended. Three and a half DESPERATE Stars.

The main character, John (Alex Pettyfer) is training with his guardian, Henri (Timothy Olyphant). John is trying to develop his legacies (powers) to one day unite with the other refugee aliens to get back to their home planet. You will enjoy this movie if you have read the book or like action and horror. It also has lots of action and plot twists, there is also a little bit of romance. This movie also has excellent special effects and the director, D.J. Caruso, did a fantastic job bringing this movie together. Some people say they don't like this movie because they can't follow the plot because it is too confusing, but John describes what is happening in the beginning. So if you stop freaking out about the movie being bad, and just watch the movie.  If you do not like this movie, you have no imagination and are overthinking everything.

4430409,3,B004MKMQJW,"Casting for the film adaptation of this book involved a search for hunks casting Alex Pettyfer of Magic Mike Fame as John and Timothy Oliphant from Justified as his minder. In selecting a dog to portrait the Chimera who protects them the producers opted for cute in selecting a winsome beagle, hey, rather a beagle than an iguana.

Not unusual for a movie to deviate radically from the original text but the emphasis here is on making a summer action blockbuster. From the opening scenes this flick blows up real good. Gone are many of the scenes between Four and Henri in which Four learns of his past history and is trained for his coming mission.

Some traits and action I liked better in the film, but the book had some very logical behaviors that needed to be part of the film. Timothy Olyphant has very expressive eyes, enriched and defined his character. Alex Pettyfer did an admirable job of effecting an American accent, the English accent slipping through only a couple of times. I'm disappointed there won't be a follow-up film for Number Six.

4430416,3,B004MKMQJW,"If you never read the book, you'll probably enjoy this movie. Good acting, good visual effects, fast paced. If you read the book, be prepared to be thoroughly disappointed.

Plot alert: The screen writers barely followed the book and changed many important themes and details. i.e. Henri doesn't teach Four  about any of his legacies in the movie and instead keeps his chest hidden from him and instead of practicing with Four to strengthen his legacies he tells Four not to use them. The movie doesn't even touch on Four being able to talk to animals (most importantly BK). The movie even changes legacies around...they give Four's fireproof abilities to Six (all Four can do in the movie is shine a light through his hands) and give Four the ability to start cars somehow. The movie changes the whole plot of Sam and his dad too. The swap the order of events too, i.e. in the movie the Mogs put dead bodies in Henri's and Fours house and they are deemed terrorosts before they have the battle in the school and demolish the school). The entire movie is full of changes like this, most of them I see no reason for the changes. It didn't save any time in the overall movie, didn't make it easier to follow if you've never read the book, they only distorted the original story, and in my opinion detracted form the entire plot. The changes are also going to make it difficult to follow up with any other movies in any fashion (it's been 5 years since they made this, so most likely they were one and done....which is probably fine with me if they were going to continue to modify the plot so entirely that it barely resembles the books plot). This is probably the worst degradation of any book plot (I'm comparing it to Harry Potter, Mortal Instruments, Hunger Games, Divergent, Twilight, Fifty Shades, etc).

Anyway, if you go into knowing this is not going to follow the book hardly at all and mentally prepare yourself, it's a good movie.",1474329600,,1940,4.568965517241379

4430421,2,B004MKMQJW,"I was sorely tempted to give this movie 1 star. However, most of my reasons have to do with the massive diversions it takes from the book. Things that weren't really needed, solely to make it contain more ""good guys destorying bad guys"" action filled. Then I thought about how I would have felt if this movie had come before the book. So I gave it 2 stars.

Pros
 - Fun action scenes
 - Semi decent story

Cons
 - Total deviation from the book
 - Never even explains what ""I am number Four"" means.
 - Very jumpy and doesn't flow well at all
 - Acting is mediocre at best
 - Does not set up the next movie well at all (doubt there will be one)

4430466,2,B004MKMQJW,The special effects and CGIs were cool but they could not save the completely lame plot and missing character development. The story line made almost no sense whatsoever and there were many plot holes that the book covered and the movie skipped. Not the worst but not worth 3.99$.

4430519,5,B004MKMQJW,"If you like the recent string of superhero action TV shows and movies, this is certainly one you must have. Rated PG-13 for violence and minor cussing, this is an action packed thriller with X-Men style super powers and abilities. This movie is fast paced with excellent special effects and a young cast that delivers outstanding performances. A young man is realizing he is VERY different from his fellow humans in that he has super powers and must keep them secret. He lives in a small town with his mentor. Very similar to Smallville and Superboy. Some of the writers from the TV show Smallville actually helped make this movie which will be clear to see. He lives a normal life usually including his rather hot new girlfriend. However, he can hide his abilities for only so long. He comes to find out that people know more about him than he thinks and those very people are quite similar to him. The resulting thrill ride will excite you and make you beg for more! Superboy/Smallville meets the X-Men is an idea. Enjoy!",1457049600,9,1023,4.626373626373627

Timothy Olyphant is always superb, and the younger cast members match him well. I just wish they would make a sequel, but I guess that's not going to happen. Apparently, the movie was not well-received, and readers who love the book series hated it. Since I had not read the books, I enjoyed the movie immensely.",1450828800,,486,4.662790697674419

4430571,3,B004MKMQJW,"OK production, but definitely one for the kiddies.  The formula that was capitalized on with Harry Potter of youthful angst pierced by the discovery that you have something redeemingly special about you is again copied in a formulaic way here, along with plenty of contrived plants of digital culture, from the constant soundtrack of cell phone text notifications to the dangers created by publicity on social media.  And of course young love, sex, heartbreak, and over-exuberant illusions of 'forever' love, as well as the usual high school bullies overcome by the 21st-century heroic geek with world-saving secrets of his own.

I say go live real life and don't fall for this distracting illusion. You all have something special about you...even if you're not a sexy, super-hero alien, you're just an amazing human with super-hero value of your own.",1449187200,,851,5.1521739130434785

I would enjoy this much more if you put out one large book and stopped all the little novellas that don't add much to the reader. The five regular books have been enjoyable but I would like an end in my lifetime.

It feels like I am paying just because I think I might miss something. James Frey as half of the mysterious Pitticus Lore I am starting to feel that this will never end or the greed for the novellas.

Now in your Endgame the same little novellas are popping up. I would enjoy all of the story in regular novels. Consider full size books...even a trilogy is better than a never ending run of shorts that don't add much to the over all story.",1444262400,,729,4.163120567375887

I also really didn't like how the protagonists forget their faithful ""dog"" while he is in the midst of a battle protecting them.  Instead of helping him, they abandon him.

4430764,3,B004MKMQJW,"Overall pretty decent film, and Timothy Oliphant is great. But, for this genre, they don't spend enough time on action and the story itself, choosing instead to focus too on character development. This created a drag on both the plot and the action: a spurt of really cool action or plot development followed by 10 minutes of trying to develop empathy for the main character. Either the director or writer (or both) did not understand their own genre and that in action/thriller/suspense films, characters are defined by their actions, not long pauses to develop a relationship.

This had the potential to be a really, really cool film but instead was more like a gifted athlete who discovers the couch is really, really comfortable. Oh, and snacks.",1433635200,,749,4.944444444444445

I won't give too much away, but there's aliens and great fight scenes, lots of secrets that unfold and surprise you and a couple of beautiful girls, (one really kick ass girl and one sweet town girl - a type for each kind of guy).

4430787,4,B004MKMQJW,"From the title alone, I wasn't that interested in I Am Number Four.  But then I started hearing the plot line and saw my first ad, I was intrigued enough I decided to see it.  It has some flaws, but I'm glad I did.

The film opens in a hut in the middle of the jungle.  We pan over the sleeping inhabitants until one is awakened by a noise.  It isn't long before both are killed.

The news of this death quickly reaches a teen living in Florida.  He and his guardian flee from there to Ohio where they start over again as John Smith (Alex Pettyfer) and his father Henri (Timothy Olyphant).  Against Henri's wishes, John goes to the local high school where he makes friends with the local geek (Callan McAuliffe) and runs afoul of the high school quarterback (Jake Abel) when he develops a crush on the quarterback's girl (Dianna Agron).

But John has a secret.  The reality is that John is one of nine children sent to Earth as his planet was being over run by an invading species.  The invaders have followed these kids to Earth and plan to wipe them out before taking over our planet.  They've already killed three of the kids, and John is next on their list.  What will happen when they reach their target?

In some ways, this movie felt like two movies crammed into one.  We've got the high school drama side of things, which felt pretty much like any other high school movie you've seen.  But every so often, we'd be reminded that this was also an alien movie.  The end of the movie switches the proportions as the alien side of things takes over.  In some ways, I felt like neither part was truly given time to develop because we had to have time for both.

Now this isn't to say I didn't enjoy the movie.  I like John, so it was easy to get lost in the story.  The friends he made in his new town were great also.  As a result, I got caught up in the story, high school drama or alien invasion.  And because I cared for them, I found the climax very gripping.

I was mostly unfamiliar with the cast going into this movie, so I had no idea what the acting would be like.  It's not going to win any awards, but everyone did a great job of letting me get lost in the story.  None of the performances threw me out of the movie, and that's all I really needed.

There are several fight sequences.  All of them take place at night, which makes it hard to follow the action at times.  The climatic battle was easy to follow, which I appreciated.

For an alien movie, there weren't a ton of special effects, most of which are also bunched near the climax.  A few of them were obviously computer generated, but my mind only noticed that for a second or two before I got swept back into the story.  Most of the effects were completely believable, however.

My understanding is that I Am Number Four is based on the first in a series of books.  After watching the film, I'd certainly be interested in reading the books.  I wish the movie had the time to fully develop the dueling high school and alien plots, but it was still an enjoyable story.",1431907200,,3041,4.266199649737303

4430820,2,B004MKMQJW,"I love the  Lorien Legacies series. This movie was okay. The focus of the movie seemed to be on the John/Sarah relationship.  That I believe was a mistake.  The book was more about John coming into his legacies.  The relationship between John and Henri was kind of glossed over.  Henri was Johns's teacher, protector and father figure.  In the movie, he was more of a secondary character.  Henri and John were expecting his legacies.  It wasn't something John should have been surprised over. That part didn't ring true in the film.  All his life John is preparing to become a guarde and he asks Henri ""why he didn't tell him.""  And where was the training?  There should have been some ""Rocky like sequences."" And John is the one impervious to fire; not Six. Which is  probably one reason a sequel wasn't made. The characters were too different.  A lot of backstory was also missing. The protective charm was not explained. That was the reason being number 4 was particularly important.  A little history of Lorien couldn't have hurt either.  Scenes that were not in the book were also added into the movie.  I never understood that. The movie would have been better if it stayed closer to the source material.  I hope they make a reboot and have a series that's closer to the books.",1429315200,,1283,4.631111111111111

I would have liked more of these movies and it's too bad this movie was overshadowed by the Twilight franchise.  It was just bad timing as this movie is entertaining and well paced a not a boring moment in the whole movie.

Who has ""bad people"" out to kill him which puts the ""love interest"" at risk and the ""bad people"" use this against him. I'll bet he discovers how to use his untapped ""powers"" to save himself, the girl, the town, and the whole world. Am I right? ......Typical Hollywood formula *snores*

It's all just so lame and typical anymore.  The same old same old same old with lots of explosions and CG monsters.  These kind of movies are just so tiresome.

I won't get into the plot, but let's just say there was enough storyline and interaction between the characters to make me care about them and the fight scenes weren't so over the top as to be boring like in the latest Superman movie.  Shocking, because Michael Bay had a hand in this movie, not as a director, producer, but if anyone knows Bay he seems to be over the top with explosions, which to me detracts from the movie.

In this film, a number of young people from a world far, far away have made their way to Earth and, together with their Guardians (the adults who guide and protect them), blend into Earth's population, growing strong and aware of their powers that they may be prepared to defeat those who destroyed their home world. The story begins when John Smith, played by Alex Pettyfer, who is number four, and his guardian (Timothy Olyphant) are on the run, looking for anonymity in the small town of Paradise, OH.

John experiences all the teen/high school things others do, from first love to standing up to the school bully. Even more he begins to experience and learn to control the amazing powers he has inherited from his people of the long-dead planet. All the while, two separate forces seek him out: a mysterious, beautiful blonde on a motorcycle, and the obviously bad guys. The film climaxes in a fight between John and his friends and the malevolent destroyers of his home planet who now seek to destroy the ""numbers"" that they may destroy Earth.

The film itself has no nudity, little or no bad language and only sci-fi violence akin to that of Star Wars. This film was obviously marketed to teens and tweens and is appropriate for that audience. Although I am considerably older (ahem...), I did enjoy the film and thought it a reasonably good movie with lots of fun and good-guys-vs-bad-guys combat. If your tastes are more sophisticated, this film may bore you. John Smith's life in high school is filled with just about every clich you can think of, from first love to the ""big bully"" to befriending the ""nerd"". The bad guys are all too obviously bad guys and you'd think anyone passing them on the street or looking over at them while stopped at a red light would say, ""Oh look Martha, there are alien bad guys in the car beside us. Don't make eye contact or they may blast us."" Yes, it's that obvious.

On the whole, it would make a good ""family night"" movie everyone can enjoy (some more than others). The special effects are quite good, there are a few surprises (the lizard/beagle) and the actors play their parts quite well. If it is sometimes a little sappy, at least it's a break from the daily deluge of cynicism!

I did enjoy it and bought it for about $5 here on Amazon so it certainly didn't break the bank. On the whole, a good, fun, family film that I recommend with four stars.",1415491200,,2671,4.579497907949791

4431122,3,B004MKMQJW,"This movie's plot has so many holes in it that at some point I actually gave up trying to follow it and just watched the CGI effects.

The basic storyline is that one group of good guy aliens have a battle royal with a group of bad guy aliens and destroy a Midwestern town in the process.

Questions for the writers and directors:

1).  So the hero of this movie is a young man who is sent from his home planet to earth right before his home planet is destroyed by bad guy aliens and when he gets here he discovers he has superpowers?  That would be a very original concept had it not been devised 70 years ago and made into TV shows, comics and movies already.  What was the creative meeting like for this movie?  ""Hey lets make a movie about an alien that comes to earth and has super powers!  Wait, hasn't that been done already in Superman?  No, no... This will be completely different because he won't have a red cape!  Brilliant!  Get casting on it.""

2).  So let me get this straight.  An entire bad guy alien armada fully equipped with ray guns and demonic beasts, which, by the way, destroyed the good guy alien's home planet is parked just outside the galaxy waiting to attack earth but is afraid to advance because of 10 high school students?  Seriously??

3).  If 10 of these good guy aliens is preventing the bad guys from attacking earth, one must ask whether there were not 10 similar individuals on the good guy alien planet that got obliterated first?  You would think there would be at least 10 of them there since its their home planet.

4).  Why do the good guy aliens have to be killed in sequence?  Who assigned the sequence to them?  How do the bad guys know which good guy alien is number 1 or 2 or 3, or so on?  What happens if number 5 gets run over by a bus?  Does number 6 get an email that says ""Dear Good Guy Alien Number 6, due to circumstance beyond our control we have changed your number.  You are no longer number 6.  You are now number 5.  We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you.  Sincerely Good Guy Alien Administration?""

5).  The movie makes a big deal about the fact that the good guy aliens are stronger if they are together.  So then why are they scattered all over the place??  Why not have them all in a good guy alien commune?

6).  So the nerdy kid's dad was abducted by UFOs BUT he was actually helping the good guy aliens?  With what??  How was he helping??  Who abducted him??

7).  The hottest girl in high school goes on 2 dates with good guy alien and then decides to abandon her life and her mother to travel the globe with good guy alien??  Okay, I will buy that.  But how did that conversation go?  ""Mom, I am going to travel the globe to help protect earth.  I love you.  Okay Sweeitie, I love you too and don't forget to floss.""

8).  Why only send 10 or so bad guy aliens to take out the good guy aliens?  I am no military genius, but maybe 2 groups converging in a pincer move would be more effective?  Or maybe they could use whatever spaceship that got the bad guy assassination team here to just blast a 2 mile area with their super weapons when they figure out where one of these guys is.

9).  Miscellaneous category:  How do the aliens get to earth?  Spaceships, transporters, what?  How do they learn English?  Why do they speak English to each other?  Where do they get money?  How are they planning on leaving?  etc.. etc.. etc..

So I will stop here but in a nutshell this movie is like listening to a 3 year old tell a story.  Its cute, but you cant really follow it.",1407283200,,3552,4.230538922155689

4431129,5,B004MKMQJW,Great movie if you like characters with superhuman-like powers. It has moments of X-men-esque feel within the character development. Though it starts out abruptly the story takes some time to really build. As the main character learns more about his abilities he is obviously forced to manage them and find a balance. The ending is great with some fairly impressive action sequences and special effects. A great action/scifi flick!,1406332800,,431,5.260869565217392
4431130,4,B004MKMQJW,"Saw the movie at the theater first & had to have a copy. It has a great story that isn't standard Movie SciFi. Most movie Sci-fi is disappointing except the special effects they show off. You either watch horror movies, police dramas, or good guy very bad guy and put us as the saviors. All with a sci-fi twist to it. Huh? That isn't sci-fi, it's an old story with a different backdrop. There isn't anything to awe the watcher, nothing in it to make us dream of what could be, etc. BUT HOLD ON--- ""I AM NUMBER FOUR"" DOES add the wonder and just enough alien to it (barely) to make you think how much different our world & lives could be. It has the love, unlike ours enough to want it, it has the good vs bad, the monsters but more like loyal dogs than scare your kids type creatures.

This was just one great, worth watching movie.  Aside from the larger screens theaters offer different versions like discs have, ""Director's Cut,"" deleted scenes, etc makes discs the best way to go. The theater is like rent before you buy. Buy this one.",1406332800,,1039,4.323076923076923

4431132,1,B004MKMQJW,"Pretty bad.  I mean, it's not ""The Last Airbender"" bad but it's still got a bit of a stink about it.  Cool concept, poor execution.  The acting was fair, the effects were pretty good (although the aliens were less than stellar (see what I did there? Har-dee-har...)), but it's probably among the most poorly written pieces of cinema ever.  The one redeeming quality?  It had a decent soundtrack.  But, you could probably find that somewhere on the Interwebs (Amazon perhaps?) and have all the pretty songs without subjecting yourself to the sewer-funk that is ""I Am Number Four.""",1406246400,4,579,4.857142857142857

4431175,3,B004MKMQJW,"Apparently there is a book series by two authors pubishing under the name ""Pittacus Lore"", and apparently reading the series might give you some more insight into the characters, their motivations, and the premise of the movie. Basically the main character is one of the last remaining guardians of his (extinct?) race, sent to Earth to hide and grow his powers. The evil dudes come to kill him and he falls in love with an Earth girl, Sarah. Later in the movie another woman enters the picture - she is also a Guardian. There is also side-kick Sam, another human boy, and a rival affection for Sarah who turns out to be surprisingly tame at the end. I felt that they tried too hard to be true to the book (perhaps to continue the series with some follow-on movies?), and the book was apparently poorly written with shallow characters. I don't know - I just came out feeling happy the movie reached a conclusion, but that I didn't like the characters that much, especially John ""flashlight hands"".",1401840000,,997,4.638418079096045

4431181,4,B004MKMQJW,"This movie lacks that magic ingredient that would have put it over the top and made it a hit.  That elusive quality that Hollywood movie makers must go crazy trying to define is not there and just frustratingly an inch or so out of reach.  All the elements are there.  A good story.  An excellent cast (especially Timothy Olyphant).  It's Dreamworks so its pedigree is impeccable.  I can only detect that Alex Pettyfer is a wee bit wooden through the first two thirds of the film as any visible flaw.  But...that aside...it is still wonderful family entertainment within the constraints of today's acceptable violence factor in such endeavors...and is superbly done in the sfx department.  The hero, the overly eager sidekick, the unrequited love, the sexy heroine who has her own eyes on our hero, great viliany done by a wonderful crew of vilians, humor, horror, and hope all mixed up together in a sci fi story with a mystery or two at its core that tugs at the heartstrings and satisfies on the action front.  Dreamwork's specialty all the way round...right...and I enjoyed the heck out of it, but still I wouldn't say it was a true classic...just a hairpin curve short...and darned if I can figure why.

The only reason I wanted to watch the movie was to see the special effects when for example, John is in his suit that they light on fire or when John sees Lorian.  Instead, they took out the parts that would have been awesome in a movie and replaced them with parts that completely changed the way the story went. The relationships between the characters were completely different from the book.

It's difficult to write SyFi without repeating typical story lines.  For that matter, most movies have ""nothing new under the sun"".  With that said, this SyFi (for me) was worth watching all the way through.  Yes, as is typical in good stories, there are bad guys, bullies, good guys, beautiful girls (and guys, for that matter), awesome abilities and powers, love, hate, and good and bad animals; but that's what makes this movie great.

The actors are marvelous and their characters well portrayed.  The main characters go through plenty of change and growth, avoiding stagnation or the appearance of being too one-dimensional.  There's also good character set-up.  The antagonist makes an appearance in the very beginning, which according to creative writing protocol, is preferred.  Each main character's initial appearance sets the stage for the beginning of their character arch.  Very well done in my opinion!

4431214,5,B004MKMQJW,Now this was such a action packed keep you guessing kind of movie that you didn't want to get up or you might miss a great scene or one of the action moves. What a super great movie to watch,1396828800,,190,3.775
4431215,4,B004MKMQJW,"After having read the book, I was eager to see the movie.  There were many differences between the novel and the movie.  Somethings the movie did better, like explaining why Scott left at the end of the book.  However, I didn't like the fact that they didn't explain how John could communicate with animals.  Overall, the book was much better than the movie.",1396828800,2,358,4.634920634920635
4431216,1,B004MKMQJW,"After about 10 minutes, I was able to predict the entire movie.  I knew the blonde was one of the numbers, I figured out the dog was going to somehow shape shift and protect him at the end of the movie, and I knew he would leave at the end to ""protect"" the girl.",1396483200,,262,3.8518518518518516

4431220,3,B004MKMQJW,I thought it was pretty good. A little cheese here and there but overall very good. The main actor did a very nice job. I'd like to see him in more roles.,1395792000,,154,3.84375
4431221,3,B004MKMQJW,I was happy to get this because it had more extras like deleted scenes!! But I don't like 'Digital Copy' I prefer much better Ultra Violet so I can see it on my HDTV thru VUDU.,1395792000,,176,3.9166666666666665

4431235,5,B004MKMQJW,When we do have first contact I hope it's by people like the good guys in this movie. One of the most action-packed thrillers you'll ever see. If you love science fiction you will especially love this movie,1394582400,,206,4.447368421052632

4431242,5,B004MKMQJW,"I love this movie!  The beginning of this, is almost exactly the way the beginning of the book was.  I actually wanted more of that scene because it was so amazing, to me anyway.

Fight scenes were epic!  And you must know... I am an action junkie!!!  Every time 6 kicked some serious butt I was drooling with anticipation to see how'd she take down the bad dudes!

Awesome movie!",1393545600,,380,4.357142857142857

4431248,5,B004MKMQJW,I watched this movie for the second time this month after seeing it when it originally came out. It was so much better than I remembered. Alex Pettyfer did an excellent job and the storyline was entertaining. I loved the action sequences and the female character introduced near the end of this film. I think this film was underrated by a long shot and wish plans for a sequel wouldn't have been shelved.,1393027200,,404,4.5479452054794525

4431255,5,B004MKMQJW,Not trying to make shadowy points. There were clear bad guys. Clear good guys. And even the bad-boy humans had some good points. Life is complicated. I need this type of escapism at times.,1391990400,,188,4.5588235294117645
4431256,5,B004MKMQJW,This was a wonderful movie that my husband and I discovered on a whim one night when we didn't have anything else to watch. The plot and characters drew us in from the start. Very intriguing! It led me to the book series which I completed in a matter of weeks. I was very excited to see the other books made into movies but was heartbroken when some internet searching revealed that someone somewhere had deemed the first attempt (I am Number Four) a failure and that no more of the books would ever see the silver screen. I do not agree that this movie was a flop or failure and truly hope to one day see the entire series made into movies.,1391558400,,641,4.219512195121951
4431257,4,B004MKMQJW,Too bad they never made a sequel. I thought the story had more legs and I wish it were longer.,1391385600,,94,3.75
4431258,1,B004MKMQJW,...but the movie is number 2.  I have forgotten everything about it but that it was a total disappoinment. Yuk.,1391126400,,111,4.55
4431259,4,B004MKMQJW,Love the animal guardian character. Fairly action packed and the bad guys you can truly dislike.  A wild and crazy ride.,1391126400,,120,4.714285714285714

4431261,4,B004MKMQJW,"Not gunna lie, I had no interest in this book series.

Then I heard they were making a movie and I didn't really pay any mind to it.

Then I saw the preview. And oh, boy. Alex Pettyfer. Damn.

I ended up buying it one day. A Blockbuster a town over was closing and I got it for a dollar (along with a s*** ton of other movies) and I guess you can't really complain about a movie that cost $1.

It's actually really interesting! The alien aspect is cool and the acting is great. Although I never really like Dianna Agron and her baby voice, I didn't mind her in this.

The effects are awesome! I love a good action flick.

And if you're not into all that, just watch it for Alex. Cause hes British and adorable.",1389830400,2,710,4.071942446043166

4431272,3,B004MKMQJW,"I like the whole superhero alien take on this which is why I checked it out. It's aimed at teens however. You might've seen Jumper, X-Men, Smallville, Twilight, The Host etc. A good soundtrack. Impressive special effects. Didn't realise No 6 was played by Theresa Palmer (grudge 2, warm bodies).

4431275,4,B004MKMQJW,This is a very decent fantasy adventure flick- lots of action and definitely worth seeing at least one time.  I have seen it several times and am glad it did each time.  Seeing it more than once might be overkill because it's not Avatar but it's very good and certainly worth seeing at least one time.,1388707200,,301,4.357142857142857
4431276,4,B004MKMQJW,"Widely panned by critics, i watched this movie because i love Dianna Agron and was pleasantly surprised at how fun it was to watch.

4431283,5,B004MKMQJW,Rated 5 for personal taste. The acting was good. The story had a lot of back story and missing back story but wasn't drawn out. The romance was minimal but nice. Character personality was nice. The alien powers weren't overused at all.,1387756800,,235,4.619047619047619
4431284,5,B004MKMQJW,My kids wanted to see this and I was not enthused but gave in.  Glad I did.  It's a fun movie that king if reminded me of a cross between the old TV series Dark Angel and the Percy Jackson movies.  It's worth the rental.,1387756800,,220,3.8444444444444446

4431290,4,B004MKMQJW,What an interesting movie.  I watched this not knowing too much about the story and found this movie relatively good.  I love Alex Pettyfer and the chemistry he has onscreen was great.,1386633600,,184,4.71875
4431291,3,B004MKMQJW,"Okay, I'm a science fiction freak and the premise was KINDA all right but they lost my intense interest when they violated the conservation of mass rules (that the director of 'Terminator 2' worked so hard to maintain).  The tiny lizard sneaking into the back of the SUV was cute.  Having it later sneak into the bushes and turn into a beagle was stupid.  Later on, the beagle turns into ... well, watch the movie if you want but it left me thinking that it was a silly movie after all.

4431297,4,B004MKMQJW,"If you enjoy fantasy and science fiction you'll definitely enjoy this film not only because it contains just that, but more importantly the movie contains real human interests with actors playing their parts well enough to pull off the fantasy and science fiction and still keep their feet on the ground (no pun intended). Despite there being aliens, which I believe are more real then many other alien movies, they do get blown up. Hooray for the good guys. Unfortunately, since they don't seem to be making a sequel, we'll never know who wins. Though I guess with most predictable movies the good guy wins, right?",1384819200,,615,4.811320754716981

4431301,5,B004MKMQJW,"The story was told well, no need for deep explanations.  The young actors did a really good job of acting like teenagers and growing into responsible individuals.  The action and effects done well.  Entertained, had a love story, resolving family issues, teenage rivals becoming friends, secrets, special effects and not bad acting.",1384300800,,332,5.346153846153846
4431302,3,B004MKMQJW,"The movie was a good start, but it focused more on the main characters relationship with Sarah, rather than the development of his legacies.

4431303,5,B004MKMQJW,"I really enjoyed this adventure into the unknown. Mr. Pettyer weaves a thrilling and captivating tell of another world and how Earth Is involved with its survival.  Suspense, adventure and anticipation all combine to make a thoroughly enjoyable read wanting you to come back and read more. You become involved in the lives of these struggling aliens and they become your heroes....a very satisfactory tale. Also, a little romance thrown in to make it more palatable to the ladies.",1384214400,,480,5.075949367088608
4431304,4,B004MKMQJW,A Sci-Fi movie that premises we have been invaded by humanoid aliens doing battle with each other and that one of the alien groups can take over the Earth.  The numbered aliens have special telekinetic and other mind powers and evil aliens have technology.  I think the movie spent too much time developing the characters of the human elements of the film and not enough telling us about the alien cultures in the film.  Maybe some scenes depicting memories of the home world being destroyed by the evil aliens would have helped.  I'm hoping they make a sequel that fills in more of the gaps.,1383868800,2,592,4.609523809523809

4431309,3,B004MKMQJW,Good junk food for kids. They left a lot of room for more movies in the future. The overall Alien concept is pretty neat and the bad guys look very cool.

4431325,2,B004MKMQJW,"I'm not overly picky about the movies I watch.  It's not a high bar I have for a Friday night's entertainment. At first I thought I didn't like this movie because it was targeted at 13-14 year old girls - in that the actors are basically all Justin Bieber'ish types . But my 13 year old totally awesome daughter sits here beside me, and her judgement is that this is movie is boring, and the guys are not cute.  In fact she felt worse when the dog (that turns into a monster) dies than when the main characters turn to dust in a puff of synthetic smoke.

My lovely wife (who is always right), and ever the insightful critic, states: ""By the end of the movie, I still didn't know what kind of alien it was. And what was the purpose was of them killing each other.""  ""It's rare that we all agree that it is a terrible movie"".

In fact, the only thing we agreed on and liked about the movie was that the dog was cute and it's acting outdid the main characters. It turns out the acting is so bad, we laughed about it as a family, and as a result, it made us happy.

If you choose to watch this movie, I wish you luck.  You'll need it.

PS - My daughter raised the rating to 2 stars because of the dog.",1378425600,3,1197,4.0423728813559325

If you like action you'll enjoy this since some action leading to the real action later in the movie, as in battling blasts and explosions and fighting. The beginning of the story leads you nicely towards the ending.  I wish they'd make another one, as in make a series. The layout reminds me a little of Harry Potter in the sense that the beginning and tension leads you to the later action (battle), including no parent criticized words or sex. Other movies I liked: Beautiful Creatures,  Pitch Black, Harry Potter,  The Secret of Moonacre, The Mummy.",1378166400,,622,4.627272727272727

To be honest, I bought this movie because of two things, the young actress who plays the love interest of the hot but complicated alien guy, is absolutely adorable.  The second reason is one I discovered while the movie was playing on Showtime for a month several months back, I would begin watching this movie, within 45 minutes into the movie, I would be dead asleep.  This movie is better than a sleeping pill, so this is why I now own it.  I've sometimes seen as much as 50 minutes as of today.......ZZzzz",1378080000,,697,4.464566929133858

4431342,4,B004MKMQJW,"Really rhe only thing that made this a bit corny was the evil aliens (and also their evil animal ""pets""), but even they weren't really SOOO bad.  Also, the reason why the aliens can only kill them IN ORDER was not explained.  The movie was good if you focus on the interaction between the characters.

The setting is that this teenager is unique & important to the world, and he's hiding out trying to grow up like a normal boy in high school.  He has to deal with all the hard-ships of being ""different/special"" from the all mundane kids.  In this way, the setting kinda resembles the high-school-age Clark Kent in Smallville or the teenage John Connor from Terminator Sarah Connor Chronicles.

Here the credibility gap is immense because the caretaker seems clueless about training his young charge and preparing him for what he will have to compete against.  Example; how could the pet dog (etc) be a surprise?  As usual today, fight scenes have humans enduring and surviving way too much, diminishing the movie further.  Bad guys don't seem to be much of a threat to earth although they are supposed to be about to conquer it.  Huh?  Why are the 6 surviving supermen such a threat?  We seem to be missing a lot of the story to make this more credible.  The more I think about it, the less I like this movie.",1373155200,,721,4.409090909090909

4431378,5,B004MKMQJW,I chose this rating because it came in the best condition possible . The box was brand new and completely sealed . I would recommend this movie to anyone who like a little bit of teenage action and some interesting things . Most of these would be classified as a syfi movie but it's not . It has some aspects of syfi but it is very intruging . I would recommend this to anyone .,1372723200,,378,4.053333333333334

4431383,2,B004MKMQJW,"so, we get an interesting introduction and all through the beginning of the movie, you are actually interested, until the main character goes to school. he sees a girl through a window which means that he will fall directly in love with her. the main thing i noticed was how well.. dumb our protagonist is: he is very motivated to go to school, but shows little interest in education ''so and so class was boring''. this character is incredibly predictable, when he saw the nerdy kid, i knew he was going to become a good friend...
as i said earlier, he is very stupid in the sense, he has to stay undercover so he becomes the boyfriend of a girl that he saw got sent to the office for posting a lot of pictures on the internet of everyone. our main character is a bit of a d*** with her, an example would be when his girlfriend (who mumbles every line that i actually had to add subtitles) sent a text about what is going on, he simply ignored.
my favorite moment that showed his intellect was when he knew the cops were on him, and the aliens and he should be running, where does he go? to the school, along with the girl that he showed little emotion to (barely hesitated when dropping her at the end) hence risking her life, all that to develop the pictures from the camera she gave him. and no, nothing on those pictures are actually important to the movie, except maybe getting the protagonist go to school. what he should have done is have ditched her by telling her it is for her own safety. after seeing a car being flipped she would probably think that that is a good idea.
the powers in the movie involve being great at parkour, super strength and telekinesis. oh yeah, it would be nice for the movie to precise when it skips a few months.
back to his awesome powers that he never takes full advantage of. for example for most of the fight scenes he forgot he could just pick up a baddie and sling him off a mile up.
heck he could have stopped baddie who stabs his fake father in the hand that causes his death. yeah, someone can be thrown on to a window a floor high, get slung onto a pole, but being stabbed in the hand is what kills him. talk about the opposite of nuking the fridge.
all that being said, the final climax was pretty cool and showed all the clips taken for the trailer. so it was a (frying the coke finale)
of all the characters, by far the most interesting one is the dog that he got, as the audience didn't know on who's side he is on during most of the movie, which was very interesting, and as the audience knows that this is not a normal dog, this character became quite interesting.
but still, 2/3ds of the movie is designated to the protagonist at school, which wasn't very interesting. as it was quite boring and so is his love romance with mumbling girl.

this movie reminded me of a book series the power of five (which could be interesting as a movie)
and after a bit of research, filming begun before the book was even published!

so, i wouldn' recommend it at all, storm breaker (same actor) was way better, and that says a lot",1372377600,,3070,4.282271944922547

I went into it expecting a B rate movie at best and found it to be very engaging and actually one of the better sci-fi movies to come out lately. The actors did a good job of playing their parts of high school kids with normal issues and the overall story line was interesting with a few twists that added value.,1371513600,,370,4.138888888888889

Throws a football like a stinger missile, fully knowing the school hottie-slash-unscrupulous photographer is watching him, with her camera on her lap. After the throw he looks surprised. Whaaaaaa?  (As as pretty sophisticated movie-goer I still couldn't figure out if this was new strength he had just come into or the director was just being lazy.)  In class, during 1950's documentary showing the detonation of the atomic bomb on the Bikini Atoll, Four's palms go from sweaty to glowing like halogen lamps. What does he do? Does he stick them under his shirt and walk quietly out of the room? No! He sits there. He gasps and stares and he carries on like he's having a grand mal seizure and then stumbles out of the room knocking down desks making as much noise as he possibly can. Is the kid brain dead from too much masturbating? Stupid? Undisciplined?  Disingenuous? ""Legacies? Duh, what's that?"" How can the kid be seventeen years old and have not figured anything out?

This is what the screen writer thinks of kids as I briefly paraphrase some of Four's best lines: Duh? Huh? Whaaaa? ... I'm mad at you (surrogate) Dad! You won't let me run or fly ... but all these things are happening to me and it makes me feel awesome and like I could leap off a cliff, whew, did you just see that? I just did leap off a cliff! You're just trying to control me because you're jealous of me!

You notice that Four doesn't bother to ask any questions; he doesn't seem to have any curiosity; he doesn't have any observational skills (there's an animal that's been following him around for his entire life and he's never noticed); he doesn't want to know anything about what he's supposed to do--all these things should be uppermost in his mind, not going to high school where he lacks social skills and is apparently a ""D"" student.  Here's another example of what a dimwit Four is: he finds a box his father left for him (Easter egg for plot points in the sequel) and doesn't bother to open it. He moves it to another room, makes a telephone call, waits for his friend to pick him up and together they drive to the next state: but he does not open THE BOX. This is the most egregious case of editing problems in the movie and there are LOTS of them. A good editor should've cut out the box at this point. It adds nothing to the story. You start wondering: where's this kid's priorities? Look, while every body is dying and the bad guys are coming it's not like he's in a hurry to leave town, right?  Later he'll spend hours developing photos he claims ""show who I really am"" with the hottie in a dark room [""I Am Number Four"" stops at this point and ""The Notebook"" takes over for an interminable 5 minutes--these scenes are the most excruciating I've ever sat through. Thank god for fast forward.] While Four's in the darkroom getting his--ahem--hand stroked there are at least four separate groups looking for him. The ones he knows about (the police and the Mogs) are just minutes by car away from him.

And the alien enemies? The Mogs? Stock eeeeevil meanies: they scare fat kids! They drop mechanized torture devices down humans' throats! They look mean! And nasty! And clearly they have sinus issues. (Acupuncture could clear that right up, guys.)

Oh, the wild card shows up, because clearly Four is such a dunce if he remains on his own he's toast. The wild card is a chick. She's cool but she's also hot. She's got an Australian accent ... or something ... She dresses like Olivia Newton John ca. ""Grease"" post makeover. She looks like she's fought in the Thunderdome and emerged victorious. Oops, the bad guys attack before anybody can compare playlists. These baddies--if they weren't scary enough we get to meet their pets: giant, frozen turkey-eating flying wargs. Sadly there are only two of them, I wished there'd been a whole flock of them. (The cops don't show up until everything is over which makes me assume that the director isn't capable of handling that many moving parts at once.)

Explosion, explosion, explosion. Kill all the aliens. The End.

I enjoyed the movie enough that I may purchase it.  I am afraid that the studio has set the audience up for potential disappointment.  The movie makes it very clear that there is more story to tell and ends with an undeniable sequel set up, but I find it difficult to believe that the following books will be made into movies.  To me this is 'Push' all over.

The premise of this movie is interesting though.  The storyline of escaping to the Blue Planet and trying to hide amongst the population does not get a lot of screenplay.  Despite critics' scathing reviews of this movie, it is clean fun.  While reading the reviews, the complaints about the acting left me puzzled.  This movie never portends to attract an adult audience.  I never put it into the Blu-ray player expecting to see an award winning movie.  This is a young adult targeted movie that adults can enjoy as well.  The more science fiction movies are dissed, the less likely we are to see them produced in the future.

I hate to say that but it's the truth.  This is the reason it was so painful for me to watch.  There was just no connection not just from character to character but from actor to their own character.  It felt empty to me and that's always a sad thing because I love movies and I watch them to escape a little bit.  There was nothing to escape into with this movie.

Yes, there is some Scarlett O'Hara type drama (i.e. hand to forehead, swoon etc) but not so much that I felt compelled to role my ever cynical eyes. The acting is pretty good for the most part, the story-line is interesting and it was adventurous, which is what I look for in a movie.

4431517,3,B004MKMQJW,"This movie could and should have been better. If you like superhero movies this idea warms your day-dreaming of yourself as a superhero soul. To instantly discover you have powers and there is a greater significance is every boys dream at one point. With that said, all the movies I've seen who attempt to pull this off have failed. I still enjoy them, but always leave wanting a little more.",1362441600,,392,4.614285714285714

Its a great, movie not so much on CGI, like most, and close to the plot, for the book, not too off-skewed, and ruining the book like Percy Jackson series. Great movie, and makes you want to just, jump...off.. into the abyss and find Four and Six <3 It's like my soul...was..unbound....

The ending left us waiting eagerly to see the sequel that surely would be coming to theaters soon. I presumed the sequel was about ready to release as the DVD came out in 2011. So I googled it and discovered that the project has been shelved--no sequel is planned. So, be aware that this movie ends as a bit of a cliff-hanger. For those desiring to know what happens next, I discovered that this is part one of a book series called the Lorien Legacies written by Pittacus Lore. The sequel is called ""The Power of Six.""

4431532,5,B004MKMQJW,"I Am Number Four, was everything I expected and more, I was completly blown away. It is a refreshingly original story about 9 aliens hiding on Earth, from the creatures who destroyed their home planet. These 9 have special powers that threaten these creatures, and they have set out to kill them, but for some unknown reason, must do it in order. Alex Pettyfer is Number Four and the next one in line. Pettyfer was absolutely incredible, having come such a long way since his last major role as Alex Rider. Newcomer Callan McAuliffe is also very likeable as sidekick Sam. I've never seen him in anything before, but he gives the story an added bonus and much needed side story. Many critics bashed this film, saying it was an alien version of Twilight, but it couldn't be further from the truth. I Am Number Four isn't focused on the love aspect, a lot of action occurs and the story actually progresses, and this film isn't dark and narrow minded, the way the Twilight films have been. I Am Number Four kept my attention and interest throughout. I connected to the story and the characters as well as the actors, and I have no problem saying it is one of the best Science Fiction films I have a seen in years! ...and for those who feel the same way, the book sequel, The Power of Six will be released on August 23, and with any luck will hit the big screen next summer.",1361577600,2,1370,4.4189723320158105

(Not a spoiler, you find that out very early.). So, then, it's nothing but ugly looking bad guys from another planet chasing down the gifted young ones from another planet.  A bit of a yawn for these adults. Pre-teens will like it much better. According to my son, the movie falls way short of the book. He said it lacked the tension.",1361145600,,493,4.53932584269663

Resemblance to the book ""I am number Four"" is the usual Hollywood adaptation, much of each (book or movie) has nothing to do with the other- but the story has lots of action and impressive FX work.
I wouldn't mind a sequel, actress Teresa Palmer (in one of the extras) evidently thought there were hopes of one- but I doubt that we'll see one- I haven't heard word of anything. The way the book series is progressing a movie series would've grown increasingly expensive to produce anyway.
Good set of extras, well worth watching, the DVD (haven't  watched the Blu ray) has excellent color and clarity.
Easily worth spending a couple of hours watching.",1360627200,,871,4.619354838709677

At no time did it seem to me that the actors were out of step with the movie or the script.  I especially liked the actor Callan McAuliffe that played the supporting role as Sam Goode.  He was especially realistic and played his role quite well, brilliantly in fact!  The main actor Alex Pettyfer played John Smith and I thought he was good, but not brilliant.  Perhaps he was chosen because he was more show than go?  Regardless, his acting wasn't bad, it just wasn't brilliant and was over-shadowed by Callan.  Regardless, this didn't deter from my movie experience at all.  Its totally an action movie with a slight spin of Sci-fi and even more of a touch of Horror.  All my favorite types of movies all wrapped up in one good movie; The story of youth not only experiencing the first parts of adult life, but finding out that life isn't what their parents warned them it could be!

4431580,4,B004MKMQJW,"When I first began the movie, it looked like an attempt to appeal to the ""Twilight"" fans.  But, after I saw who his protector was I decided to give it a chance a little longer.  I'm glad I did.  The movie had a good story.  The characters were believable.  Unknown actors, as far as I can tell, with the exception of the protector who came out in ""Hitman"", and the mother of the teenage girl the main character falls in love with.  You might recognize her in the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Movie.

The action is sparse, though, until the end.  There were some very unexpected surprises.  Although I don't know why a certain ""animal"" accompanies him.  This is a question for me.  But, the special effects were cool.  The movie itself on Blu Ray is BEAUTIFUL.  The quality, the colors, everything was just clear.  The sound was very good.  Great separation between speakers.  When it rained, you can hear it very clearly behind you.  Any other sounds that surround you immersed you in the story.  Very great job of mixing the sound and engineering.

At the end when I saw the credits and saw Michael Bay's name, I understood why it looked so great.  Being that he did the Transformers.

I do recommend seeing this movie.  To add to your collection...maybe not.  But, if you are a fan of Sci-Fi, aliens, action, etc., you may want to add it.",1358726400,2,1338,4.483333333333333

4431587,4,B004MKMQJW,"First off-casting!  Alex Pettyfer was a great choice as John.  I'd never seen Pettyfer in anything before, and I was pleasantly surprised.  I'd only seen photos of him, and feared an over wrought, pretty-boy performance.  I was happy with his portrayal, and look forward to seeing him in future films. I'm a fan of Timothy Olyphant, and only wish he'd played a bigger role. Dianna Agron was almost exactly how I'd envisioned Sarah while reading the book.

I was not as impressed with the Mogadorians.  I found them repulsive, but not in a very interesting way.  I suppose I'm glad they weren't heavily reliant on CGI, but I thought they lacked depth.

I was pleased to not have to sit through a pandering teen romance.  The love story was sweet and believable.  The performances were solid and not overdone.  So many teen flicks are overacted or syrupy, and this was neither.

The movie isn't Oscar material.  It's not complex or deep in subject matter.  However, it was a fun action movie.  I will definitely read the sequel and check out the next film.",1358467200,,1054,4.683060109289618
4431588,4,B004MKMQJW,"I actually enjoyed this movie, especially since the hero has my kinda dog! As my title suggests, this was a movie made more for young people than adults. But, it's still a whole lot better than almost any of the films in sci-fi you can watch for free on Amazon Instant Videos that it was well worth the $1.99!And a much better love story than Twilight!",1358380800,,352,4.348484848484849

4431591,1,B004MKMQJW,"I'm not sure what I was expecting when I sat down to watch this movie. I suppose I was hoping for something like a new Star Man, Superman or Highlander. An extra-terrestrial here on Earth trying to sort out Galactic issues with some great action and thrills along the way.
  What I found instead was a very mediocre movie that couldn't seem to keep it's mind on it's purported plot. The script writing is very superficial and the characters rather lame. The ""hero"" is among the last of a dying race hiding on Earth from an evil force bent on his destruction and that of the Earth as well. Pretty heavy stuff.
  He however, seems far more concerned with social networking, scoring points with the local high school girls and naming stray dogs after retired Cleveland Browns Quarterbacks (Bernie Kozar)than in saving himself or the Earth, all of this to the steady pounding beat of an endless stream of pop music songs.
  Seriously, there are so many ""special moment songs"" meant to capture and frame different scenes, that if you closed your eyes you'd think that you were listening to the radio rather than watching a movie.
  There's nothing wrong with music in a movie or an appropriate meaningful song now and then - but you get the impression that they sat around and created the song play list from their MP3 player first and then tried to write a movie around it, rather than the other way around.
  Never mind that the ""teenagers"" in the movie are all played by ""actors"" in their mid to late twenties. Must have all been left behind a few times at graduation. But I digress.
  A couple of other things - the evil aliens who are going to destroy the planet seem about as threatening as your Uncle Earl with a few too many beers in him. Their Galactic evil knows no bounds as they alternatly make faces at random strangers out car windows while driving on the highway (ohhh that's scary), go to grocery stores to buy lots of frozen turkeys and apparently have enough free time left in their inter galactic day planner to cut side deals with random human bums hoping to solicit their help in conquering the planet because they just can't seem to get the job done by themselves. It's laughable, but not supposed to be.
  The props and make-up look to be left over from Buckaroo Banzai. The special effects are much more ordinary than they are special. It seems that low budget was a high priority here.
  I'm sure that the writers and producers were hoping to ride the popularity wave of the Twilight moview with this film being the first chapter of a hoped for new franchise. No such luck however, what they cranked out is much much less. Kind of like ordering a T-Bone steak and getting a White Castle burger instead. In a nutshell, this movie (script/acting/effects et all) is Ed Wood quality.
  This movie is not recommended and I suggest you save your two hours for something more likely to please. I think you'll be glad you did.",1358121600,,2938,4.553231939163498

4431616,4,B004MKMQJW,"I read the book, ""I Am Number Four,"" and was excited to know there was a movie coming out.  I was quite surprised that the film did less than stellar box office, particularly since this was released during the Twilight craze, and it seemed that this film would appeal to that fanbase.  I was even more disappointed to learn that there appear to be no plans to release any sequels (last I heard anyway,) so I suppose we will have to be content with this one film.

The film hews closely to the book, which is a good thing.  Alex Pettyfer is always nice to look at, but he typically acts with a somewhat blank expression.  This is not a problem for him here; after all, he's portraying an alien!  Teresa Palmer as Number 6 was just awesome.  I had not seen her before, but I can't imagine another actress in the role.  I'm thrilled to see she's got a huge slate of films lined up - we already know how well she handles action, but I'm ready to see what else she can do. I don't need to say much about Timothy Olyphant. He can do no wrong with me, and he was great as 4's guardian.

The minor problems I had with the book were less of a problem on screen.  One character's seemingly out of the blue personality transplant seemed more believable in the film.  And near the end of the book, there seemed to be a constant string of: ""Let's put 4 and 6 in some impossible situation, and then let's give them some magical tool to escape.  And repeat!""  Again, this just did not seem as noticeable and repetitive in the film.

Special effects were adequate, and I think they were what could be expected from an untested first film of a potential franchise, without a huge budget.

The blu-ray offers some nice special features.  I'm always happy to see some bloopers!",1356652800,9,1758,4.330275229357798

The story line is great! -Yes: this is a sci-fi movie with an actual story line, which is hard to find now days. The special effects are amazing but not overwhelming, very well placed. The acting is good, but it shouldn't have been; the very few parts where the acting wasn't good were probably scripted that way intentionally.

It has some mandatory sci-fi cheese but with a twist. If I had to make a funny comparison with another movie I would say it is the ""Grease"" of science fiction (but with superheroes and without being a musical). Watch it and you'll understand what I mean.",1356307200,,684,4.464

4431681,1,B004MKMQJW,"I love Sci-Fi films, and I'm usually willing to forgive quite a bit in order to get the the kernels of what makes the premise of a film interesting or entertaining, but this is not one of those times.

Starring Dianna Agron, of 'Glee' fame (you may know her as Glee's Quinn Fabray), and Alex Pettyfer, of the film 'Beastly' (a teen drama VERY loosely based on the premise of 'Beauty and the Beast'), and his most recent role in 'Magic Mike', 'I AM FOUR' takes liberties with the Science Fiction genre to create what I can only think of as an incredibly weak hybrid of 'E.T. the Extraterrestrial' meets 'Starman' meets 'Twilight', with a heavy dose of forlorn teen love drama at its center.

While there are scattered scenes throughout the film that might be mistaken as suspenseful, the overall effect left me feeling like I just swallowed a sugary dose of a made-for-the-Disney Channel 'I Was A Teenaged Space Man' afternoon special.  It was just plain bad.  No... it was REALLY bad.

SPOILER ALERT:
Sadly, the opening sequence really grabbed my attention, and I made the mistake of thinking that maybe... just MAYBE any other scene in the film might replicate that same heightened tension.  Unfortunately, nothing else compared.

The beginning of the film starts out with a high-tension suspense sequence in a ramshackle hut in some remote tropical jungle setting ALA 'Predator'.  The hut's occupants are being stalked by something, filmed supposedly through the eyes of the antagonist of the scene.  The young, scrub-faced teen occupant of the hut is warned of the approaching menace via some alleged 'alien artifact' he's wearing on his person (similar to E.T.'s 'heart-light').  Whatever is stalking this boy and his supposed 'guardian' quickly dispatches them both, with an accompaniment of gutteral growls and snarls implying that whatever this creature is-- it's large, dangerous, and lethal.

My interest was piqued.

Unfortunately, the film quickly transforms into a rebellious-teen-alien-goes-rogue-as-he-falls-for-the-small-town-girl-he's-forbidden-to-see scenario.  If you slapped some pasty white make-up on his face and made him sparkle in the sun, he could be another Edward Cullen all over again.  Oh, wait.  He's got an 'alien artifact' too, and it DOES sparkle and glow at inopportune times.  Gosh, that's original.

Throw in some high school rivalry, the 'bad guy' jock character that used to date the small town girl and ruined her reputation, and the cute-but-geeky 'loner' sidekick, and you've got the makings of another formulaic piece of teen drama crap that is better left for the bargain bin.

Better yet, just save yourself the trouble and avoid this dungheap altogether-- you'll just be asking for your time, and your money, back.",1353715200,2,2759,5.1617977528089884

There is the secrets, the hiding, her finding out and not caring and then some individuals from his circles come into the picture and want to kill them.  Big fight at the end, save the girl, etc...  Plot sound familiar?  If the aliens were vampires and Dianna Agron was a klutzy brunette we'd have Twilight...maybe with better acting though.",1353715200,2,586,4.586538461538462

4431692,3,B004MKMQJW,"I am number Four(released Aug/10)stars Alex Pettyfer as John Smith/Number 4/,Timothy Olyphant(Bruce Willis' nemesis in Live Free and Die Hard) as Henri,Dianna Agron as Sarah Hart,Teresa Palmer(unsuccessfully trying hard to hide her Aussie accent)as Number 6 and others. Think teen angst,peer pressure and hormones. Then throw in a mix of Aliens out to get the protagonist,and you have a good idea of the plot of this less than thrilling Sci-Fi jaunt.
Olyphant is Alex Pettyfer's protector on Earth. About nine survivors from an alien home world(all humanoid in appearance,of course)come to Earth to escape another alien race(Magadorians),who decimated their planet. Pettyfer has to move from town to town. He's a teen,so not only is he trying to discover who he is as a person,but is trying to understand his alien roots/power also. After yet another move into a new town he falls in love with a local girl. He also has all the trouble a newbie has in a new school,specifically bullies. Thrown into this mixture is a school geek whose father was abducted by a UFO and who Pettyfer befriends. Eventually the baddie aliens come a-lookin' for number 4(of course)for the final showdown. The film concludes as Pettyfer,his friend and Number 6(what happened to five?)go in search of his friends father.
There is just nothing to grab onto with this film,as much as I wanted to like it. It IS a teen movie and how many of those have we seen,but done better?The bad aliens are humanoid and have a heightened olfactory sense(seen in a line of ""gills"" just behind the nose).Threatening?Yeah,sort of,but not overly so,and certainly not scary enough to go ducking for the pillow to put over ones face. So THAT has been done better too. It is yet another been-there,done-that thing. The film is also mighty predictable. It is not giving too much away to say that Pettfer's protector dies somewhere along the line,as if we didn't see THAT coming light years away. If it isn't focusing on the teen troubles,then of course it is the alien dynamic,and back again. Makes your head spin.

4431699,2,B004MKMQJW,"Ok, I waited for this in my Netflix queue for I don't know how long, so I was pretty excited to finally see it. My reaction was....mixed, if not a little dissapointed at the wasted potential this film had. I expected from the trailers, an action/sci-fi movie with hidden messages, deep character development, and more, considering the premise. But, sadly this turned out to be just your run-of-the-mill tween-ish romance about a normal girl and a mysterious boy with alien powers. Seem familiar?

Yes, I'll admit I compared this to Twilight more than once while watching. I'd even argue that this has less action (or well put together fight scenes) than the vampire movie. The fight scenes in this are forgettable, and some look like the actors are swinging around on cables. Hard to swallow when you know that these are aliens who have been trained to try and protect themselves in self defense.

My next complaint is character development. As soon as I saw the titular Number Four (or ""John Smith"" as they unoriginally decide to name him), I didn't see a distinctive personality. I saw a face that would fill seats with teenage girls. And even besides that fact, I couldn't pin down one distinctive thing about him, and he's the main character! Sure he gets new powers, but he's too busy flirting around with Sarah (Dianna Agron) to develop any of them. Moving onto her character, she's your average every day photographer, doesn't really contribute anything to the plot, which is a shame, because I like her work on Glee. John's sidekick in this is a basic goofy nerdy kid, and I'd lie if I didn't say he was the most annoying part of the movie. Maybe it's the actor's hollow performance, maybe it's because his character's a cliche, etc., I just didn't enjoy the character at all. Henri, John's mentor, is our Obi-Wan Kenobi, whose only purpose it seems is to die, so John can have a reason to finally use his powers. The villains in this, right alongside the sidekick were the worst part of the movie. It's never explained why they want to kill the nine aliens (and if it was I must have missed it), and they're just (to put it bluntly) dumb looking, and don't have much to offer, and if there's one thing I look for in a movie, it's a good villain. If I had to pick one good actor, it would probably be the dog (shapeshifting alien) that John adopts.

Next, is the book to movie translation, and the gaping plot holes we're left with as a result. What happened to the sidekick's dad? Why is John leaving the town at the end? How did that shapeshifting dog survive the slaughter of the planet all these aliens are from? Why does it follow John and Henri around at the beginning of the film. What's the bad guy's motivation again? Most, if not all of these questions are never answered in favor of poorly written romance and badly choreographed action sequences. If you read the book (I didn't) you'll be able to understand most of these situations (hopefully). But if you didn't read the book (or even know it was a book) you will be very confused by the film's end.

The last complaint I have is more of a personal one. The music. Yes, those pointless scenes near the beginning of the film where they play a popular song over what's happening. It wouldn't be so bad, if maybe they were playing on the radio, or had significance to the scene. But nope, ""We used Adele's ""Rolling in The Deep"" for the trailer, gotta put it in with the scene of Number Six blowing up a house."" What? That and some of these are played within five minutes of each other. It doesn't flow.

So, am I saying this film is bad? Yes. It could have been great. The premise looked interesting enough for me to pick it up and watch it. Sadly, the amount of wasted potential in this film made me want to go back and skip it. All I have to say is, if the book is like this, than I will probably skip reading that one.",1348444800,,3890,4.465541490857946

4431704,2,B004MKMQJW,"""I Am Number Four"" is nominally about aliens from outer space hunting other aliens who've been here for a while. The action begins in media res as we watch alien Number Three (Greg Townley) and his Guardian (euben Langdon) fall to the Mogadorians, led by the Commander (Kevin Durand). It's not easy being a number.

Our hero hiding under the pseudonym John Smith (Alex Pettyfer) is a good-looking, buff outcast who just can't fit in. He's Number Four, an alien from the planet Lorien, on the run from the aforementioned Mogadorians that destroyed their home planet. Why? No clue, and director D.J. Caruso isn't in the mood to explain. Number Four is unhappy because he has to keep moving from place to place to hide from the hunters at the insistence of his Guardian Henri (Timothy Olyphant). Number Four's super power, known as legacies, are coming to the fore as he matures, including telekinesis and glowing hands. And you thought hairy palms were bad!

Moving to Paradise, OH, Number Four tries to blend in but does anything but as he makes friends with conspiracy geek Sam Goode (Callan McAuliffe), romances photographer Sarah Hart (Dianna Agron), and crosses paths with her ex-boyfriend and current bully Mark James (Jake Abel). Throw in a hot Australian chick (Teresa Palmer) who can walk away from an explosion in slow-motion, a cute puppy that's not a cute puppy, and two giant flying lizards and it's easy to see the fingerprints of producer Michael Bay all over this film.

The acting in ""I Am Number Four"" is bad. Pettyfer mumbles. Agron shoots pouty glances. Abel sneers. In fact, the most charismatic is Olyphant beneath layers of makeup, with his off-kilter cadence and his delightfully sarcastic tone as he gloats about taking over the planet. Even the dog is a bad actor.

""I Am Number Four"" is shamelessly vapid, playing to stereotypes, ripping off better movies, and covering it up with lots of action. Why do the Loriens need to be killed in a particular order? What's up with Number Six's legacy that seems to make her nigh unstoppable? Why are these ridiculous aliens trying to blow up the Earth? And why do they bring giant pterodactyl monsters with them to do it?

You're not going to get any answers. But then, you shouldn't expect any. The original book upon which this movie was based was written by James Frey author of the fraudulent memoir A Million Little Pieces.",1339459200,,2394,4.800970873786408

OK I'll admit the battle at the end was kind of cool, but not at all how it happened in the book, and they did a good job with the death of number 3 in the very beginning.  After 3 died though this movie just got worse as it went on.  It seemed to me like they thought they could rewrite the whole story and do it better then the author.  WRONG.  They changed just about everything in the movie, and not one thing was even close to being as good as it was in the book.  They changed the relationship between John and Henri.  It felt like there was a lot of conflict between the two of them, and that John just didn't care about anything that Henri had to say.  In the book the two of them have a great relationship there is some conflict as there is in all relationships, but over all they have a great relationship.  Where is that in the movie I didn't see it.  wasn't there a fire in the book that led to teh Mogs finding out about John, and finding him which led to the final battle at the school.  What about Henri it felt like they whre in a rush to get rid of him honestly having him die by the side of the road, and leaving it at that.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME.  Maybe I read a different book but wasn't Henri alive for the final battle at the school.  Wasn't he running around with a shotgon.  Didn't he die at the end of the battle.  One more thing what was with the extra stuff.  They added a lot of stuff in the movie that was not in the book.  Note to the writers if you can't get the movie right when somebody else writes the story then don't try to add extra stuff.  How do you think that is going to end.  All I can say is WOW this was bad.  Perhaps I am deluded but it seems like the writers of this movie followed a different story line, and I'll be honest if I am crazy and the book is like this movie then I think I want to stay crazy because its a much better story.

4431713,3,B004MKMQJW,"*Possible Spoilers*
After reading I Am Number Four by Pittacus Lore, I was really looking forward to seeing I Am Number Four in theaters.  After watching the movie I was disappointed that they had chopped up the book and turned it into this movie.  Important parts that are found in the book are taken out of the movie; I realize that this has to happen due to time restraints, but they added in parts that never happened in the book.  I also felt like a lot of the background information that I felt was important to the understanding of the story was left out or glossed over; the development of his legacies, and the time he spent with Henri was all missing.  The two main characters fell for each other rather quickly in my opinion; they never really had time to get to know one another let alone fall in love.  Also, the ""Mogs"" were not as scary as I had envisioned them, which was a let down seeing as they are here to destroy the earth, not simply scare a few humans.

I think that if I had not read the book I would not have been as disappointed.  The movie was fast paced and the characters were likeable for the most part.  The special effects and CGI were really well done with a few exceptions.  Towards the middle of the movie once Number Six arrives, the action really started to pick up and the movie became much more interesting and kept my attention.  Number Six kicks butt while John sits back and tries to protect his love interest.  Looks wise, I liked who they cast for the main characters; Alex Pettyfer and Dianna Agron fit who I had imagined while reading the book.

Overall this movie was decent, especially if you have not read the books.  If you have read the books, do not expect an accurate translation from book to screen, but based on past experiences, we can never expect an accurate translation.  Check it out if you have some time to spare and are into Sci-fy, action, types of movies.",1333843200,5,1919,4.3841807909604515

I really don't know if I can say I was disappointed, since I really didn't expect a whole lot, but this was exceptionally vapid and somewhat ridiculous in many scenes.  It dissolved into a mere teen angst high school story that had no charisma or intrigue whatsoever.  The saving grace here is the way the special effects are used to bolster our attention.  The fight sequences are very nicely done; but this film truly falls apart thanks to the empty performances by the lead actors.  Alex Pettyfer and Glee's own Dianna Agron are empty souls here, delivering NO EMOTION whatsoever and created two of the most unlikable heartthrobs in recent history.  I mean, who wants to watch them?  And this is coming from a Glee supporter who generally likes Agron in the confines of the show, but here she was awful.  I echo mu fellow disgruntled reviewers who compare this to the `Twilight' films.  I have personally never seen the `Twilight' films, but their targeted audience is VERY obvious, and it is certainly obvious that `I Am Number Four' was attempting to capitalize on that.  Caruso's direction is plagued with clichs (and this is coming from someone who thought that his `Disurbia' was a clever take on `Rear Window', and actually felt it surpassed Hitchcock's classic).  Alas, I'm getting longwinded about something I wanted to devote a marginal amount of my attention to.  Skip this drek.  That is all.",1331251200,,1490,4.865079365079365
4431717,2,B004MKMQJW,"The book was decent, though the plot could be described as ""my girlfriend is more important than the universe itself"".
The movie was so terrible! They should have called it ""I am Number Six"" because that was what the movie was about. The characters were all blonde (except Sam. Yay Sam!) Henri was a creep. The dog was a creep. Number Six was a creep.
I actually liked John and his girlfriend though. They got together wayyyy too fast, but it was still okay.
I find it funny, during the party scene where John goes to get his girlfriend, the sherriff walks through the party (where all the kids are drinking, as mentioned later by the Mogdorian who says ""a drunk young man like you"") and doesn't even say anything about the kids being underage, or having a party in his house, which, by the way, in the book, was a secret party because the bully's parents were out of town. (The house got burned down in the book. Yeah. That was kind of a big part.)
That's just it. The kids did not look like highschoolers.

SPOILER
Henri died way too early. He dies during the battle at the school. And actually, most of the fighting with the beasts took place outside the school. In the forest and whatever.
END SPOILER

The only redeeming thing in this movie was Sam, for one thing, and the floor polisher. That's like the one thing that didn't change from the book. What the HECK was up with those ""Mogs"", which, by the way, they were never referred to as in the book.
Their powers were all wrong. ALL wrong. Is Six Nightcrawler now? Her power is invisibility. It's John that is resistant to heat. What was up with his Lumen?

As the movie progresses we get vicious alien invaders and space monsters, not to mention shape shifters and lovely alien heroines. All told this rather traditional mix results in an entertaining sci-fi adventure that held my attention all the way to the sort of end.

I say sort of end because it definitely screams sequel to me; the story stops with no conclusive resolution to the main problem.

4431729,5,B004MKMQJW,"The plot of this film seems to be loosely modeled on the short-lived 1980s TV show THE POWERS OF MATTHEW STARR.  Like Starr, the story centers around a teenage boy from another planet who has been sent to earth to be hidden-away from bad guys who invaded his home.  Ostensibly, the plan is to have him tucked away to refine his powers so that, when he's ready, he can return to the fight & lead his race to victory over the intruders.  Like STARR, he has a mentor who is tasked with showing him how to use his powers responsibly and effectively.  Also like the TV series, some of the intruders get tipped-off to where he is....and they're going to be looking for him.

Unlike STARR, the main character in this movie is not the only adolescent whom his race has sequestered on Earth (hence the title of the movie).  He has peers stowed away, but the idea is to keep them seperate so that finding any one of them won't lead to the demise of them all.

I found this to be a highly entertaining and fun movie.  The bad-guy aliens are far more menacing than ones from the 1980s TV show were, and the FX are way more spruced~up than STARR could ever dream.  If you're looking for a sci-fi film that's also family-friendly, then this one is highly recommended.",1326844800,2,1253,4.366379310344827
4431730,3,B004MKMQJW,"I went into this movie knowing absolutely nothing about it. I had heard that it was about  aliens, but I really didn't understand at that point. I wasn't necessarily excited about the film, but I still walked away without being disappointed.
I Am Number Four is based on a teen novel about a high school student trying to hide the fact that he is an alien from humans and the monsters that are hunting him.
While I won't say that I loved this movie, it wasn't a bad film, even though there were times that it seemed too Twilight-esque for me. The acting in the film was a bit rough at times and some better performances would have done a lot for this film. The special effects in the film were well done and the action scenes were pretty cool to watch (Michael Bay produced the film and you can sense a lot of his influence in some of the action moments). The story was interesting and kept viewers involved enough to last the film.
Let me expound a little more on that last statement. The pacing of the movie didn't flow well. The first 3/4 of the film was pretty slow-moving mainly because they kept building the intensity of the pace and then breaking it by throwing in some rough and drawn-out get-to-know-the-characters scenes. Not well played. But once the movie finally got going and stayed moving, the film became more engaging and fun. It just took too long to get there. The last 1/4 of the movie is non-stop action and CGI. Pretty cool stuff, really.

**Spoiler Alert**
One scene that irked me the wrong way was after John first engages the Mogadorians and then runs to save Sarah. Despite the danger they are both in, John and Sarah still find time to go down to the school and develop a whole roll of photographs in a darkroom? Seriously? No, they would have died while still waiting for the first picture to develop.
And the monster slipping on the bar of soap...well...
**End Spoiler Alert**

Overall, the film was a fun teen action flick and worth the time.

As far as questionable content:
The film bounces back and forth between kid-friendly and adult quite a bit. There are some pretty violent and scary moments in the film and it certainly earns it's PG-13 rating.

For the action effect, this one may have been good enough for a matinee movie watch.  I caught some of this at a friends house w/o knowing much about it. It has a nice looking group of people cast, who I think did a good job for their roles.  Yeah, some of it was predictable, but I think it was worth the 2 hrs you will set aside for it.  The violence, mostly action scenes are not gory, there isn't much bad language. Parents if your kids are under 11 or 12, i'd just say you watch it first, to see how much shooting and stuff you want your kids exposed to.  The romance is cute, like I said, predictable, but not cheesy.  The movie seems to set itself up for at least one sequel, which I would not mind seeing, so I hope they are able to make that happen. Diana (from Glee)did a nice job, and the main guy is a looker, so he's nice to watch  :-)  The flow of the movie seems to stand and it doesnt seem to have many parts that drag on, so for what it's worth, go for it.  Redbox currently has it available (december 2011), so shell out $1 if you reserve it online first, and then decide if you want to buy it.  It's a good rainy or snowy day movie that would be fun to watch with a group, as since it's not a terribly deep plotted movie, you can chat among your friends when the movie is on and not miss too much.

I figured I might be disappointed when the opening credits mentioned ""the sound track"".  Maybe some teens are going to go to iTunes and buy the music, but really, I was just looking for an above average sci-fi movie...not a sound track.

Some of the bad stuff...
#1 For aliens, John and Henri look and act too human.  #2 As for John keeping out of sight, he doesn't bother.  So, it lacks a believable story-line.  #3 If you want to lay low, then don't have a photographer for a girlfriend.  And the whole girlfriend thing seemed a bit rushed...and why would he do it?  It puts her life at risk and they can't stay together anyway...typical teen drama. #4 John and Sam's friendship should have been developed more. #5 How did John and Henri just happen to live in the same house that Sam and his father lived in?  It's far fetched. #6 The bad aliens were way over the top. #7 At the end, when the bully helps John, that just didn't fit.  Again, far fetched.

""I Am Number Four""
---------------------------------------------------
This was a pretty snoozy teen-oriented sci-fi/soap opera flick, with a tone that was distinctly reminiscent of TV shows such as ""Roswell,"" ""Veronica Mars"" ""Dawson's Creek"" and particularly the lethargic Twilight series. Similarities include a platoon of well-groomed, overly pretty twentysomething actors pretending to be highschool kids, which is made particularly difficult because they were cast for their looks rather than their acting ability. The script is pretty leaden, and pretty predictable -- you have seen this all before: ""Heroes,"" ""Roswell,"" ""Superboy""... Teen-alien-on-the-run poses as human kid, goes to high school and finds loyal friends and love even as bad aliens track him down and cause many explosions and much artless exposition. The film ends on a hopeful note: additional leaden exposition is tacked on telling us that the quest will continue: A sequel?? Wow... let's hope not!! (Axton)",1320796800,,1035,6.144827586206897
4431744,4,B004MKMQJW,"I AM NUMBER FOUR is one of them guilty pleasures. You see the film, find yourself damn entertained, but then can't look yourself in the mirror come the morning. You note the triteness of the plot, the cheesy dialogue, how everyone looks like they stepped out of a fashion magazine (even the resident nerd is, to quote my girlfriend, ""a hottie""), and you marvel that this isn't an even bigger train wreck. Me, I love train wrecks. I am clamoring for a sequel. I mean, the book series already has a sequel.

Not that the film goes much into it, but the title supports the conceit that nine extraterrestrial children from the planet Lorien have fled to Earth seeking sanctuary, pursued by another alien race, the murderous Mogadorians. Having scattered to the winds, the children can only be killed in numerical order (as I've said elsewhere, this sucks for ""Number One""). ""John Smith"" (not his real name) was nine years old near the border of Mexico when the first scar seared itself onto his ankle, heralding the murder of the first child. He was twelve in Colorado in the midst of a spelling bee when the second scar surfaced. The third scar appeared whilst he was at a beach party, while he was, in fact, swimming with a fine chick (who then proceeds to label him a freak when he starts reacting to the painful ankle burn). The film doesn't bother to clearly explain that the charms the Lorien children wear are what keeps the sequential kill mandate activated. This is just one of the many plot holes inhabiting this film, so many plot holes than even Swiss cheese is amazed. Off the top of my head, here are several other wrong turns. I think the story needed to drop a smidge of foreshadowing regarding the beagle Bernie Kosar. Later in the film, when the beagle does what it does, it's one of those jarring ""What the what?"" moments. Also, apparently, not even running for your life should hinder you from setting aside some time to develop film.

I'll be brutally honest and say that Alex Pettyfer doesn't much impress me with his acting skills. He performs his screen obligations stolidly, acquits himself pretty okay. Plus, he's cut and, in the eyes of the Hollywood moguls, that's enough to attract the babes. And he represents well during the action moments, and let me mention that the action sequences are very well-executed. Unfortunately, Pettyfer and his romantic interest, GLEE's Dianna Agron, exhibit the awkward rapport often found between a harried customer and a call center operator on meds. Dianne Agron's character is deeply interested in photography, and this is what the film calls character development. The rest of us call it taking a shortcut.

John Smith - a.k.a. ""Number Four"" - and his guardian Henri (also an alien and not French, although there may not be much difference) relocate to the small town of Paradise, Ohio, and if the plan was for John to stay under the radar, that doesn't work out too well. These nine Lorien children at some point all develop ""Legacies"" (a.k.a. super powers) and when John's legacies begin to flare up, he causes a stir or two or three... John Smith is also one of them righteous kids what can't tolerate someone getting bullied. At his new school, he stands up for a nerdy UFO-obsessed kid named Sam. Except that championing the bottom of the food chain gets you noticed. John isn't exactly blending in. The Mogadorians - sporting the latest reject apparel from the Matrix line and, for some unexplored reason, gills - are soon sniffing out John and Henri's trail.

For all the predictable story beats and the pandering, you can't fault the visual effects and the spectacular fighty fights. And, inasmuch as a late entrance can propel the third act of a narrative, the arrival of the gorgeous, vigorous, kickbuttt Number Six (Teresa Palmer) juices things up, reshuffles the dynamics. I may clown on the film and its pitfalls, but I think the premise is cool and there's enough base mythology introduced here that a well-thought-out sequel can really fuel this franchise. And, also, I'm an action junkie. And the mighty beagle Bernie Kosar - once you get past the ""What the what?"" - is just awesome. On that note, 3.5 out of 5 stars for this puppy.

The DVD's bonus features: Bloopers and ""Becoming Number Six"" (a segment tracking Teresa Palmer as she undergoes training and performs her rigorous stunts; 00:11:43 minutes long).",1320364800,,4392,4.773684210526316
4431745,2,B004MKMQJW,"I'm glad this has been released on DVD: watching a movie this bland in a cinema without being able to mock it out loud was excruciating. It looks and feels like a TV pilot for a series aimed at fans of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but without any of Joss Whedon's flair for characterisation and dialogue, and with a premise that might have been copied from a Scientology pamphlet.

On the plus side, the villainous Mogadorians and CGI monsters look passably cool, and it provided employment for Timothy Olyphant and some Australian actors. I hope they all manage to live it down, but it's sufficiently forgettable that they probably will.

Having been persuaded to watch this by a teenage relative who has since apologized, we did our best to keep ourselves awake (insert Mogadorian/Mogadon joke here) by providing our own commentary, but what this really needs to make it entertaining is the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 crew.",1319846400,,924,4.8789808917197455
4431746,3,B004MKMQJW,"This is the entertainment business, and you know, they try, but probably the most entertaining thing about this movie was how it came to be. There are a lot of great films based on books, and even more great books deserving film adaptations, but rather than take a literary success and bring it to the big screen, Dreamworks decided to buy the rights to, of all things, I Am Number Four. Oh yeah, and they purchased them a year before it was even published! All because James Frey, author of A Million Little Pieces, decided to start a fiction franchise that pumps out books and movies that could be marketed to teens.

But hey, why not? It was bound to be a success. A young man escapes a planet just as it's being destroyed, ending up in a quaint town in Kansas Ohio where he attempts to live a normal life, only to find that he possesses superpowers, which really throw a kink in his small-town romance. That exact story has already worked out once -- why not a second time? All you need to do is get the creators of Smallville to write the script, toss in some beautiful people and a few Michael Bay explosions, and you've got yourself a hit.

I Am Number Four opens on a scene of said beautiful people partying at the beach. Our hero, John Smith (Alex Pettyfer), is having a blast with all his buddies, and even gets invited to a sexy swim with the school hottie, where she delivers such lovely dialogue as ""The big dipper. It's my favorite."" I doubt she could even name another constellation, but that's neither here nor there, because suddenly a scar on John's leg emits a blinding light, signaling that Number Three is dead. For some reason that may or may not be explained in the book but certainly isn't in the movie, the survivors of planet Lorien can only be killed in order, so it's time for Number Four to go on the run. He and his protector, Henri (Timothy Olyphant, whose last name always reminds me of Lord of the Rings), burn all their belongings and hit the road, but an eeeeevil gecko sneaks onto their truck.

Their flight leads them to Paradise, Ohio, where the gecko turns into a cute puppy...of DEATH! At least, that's what I kept expecting. But when the puppy passed up numerous opportunities to transform into a horrible monster and slay everyone, I ended up just being pretty confused about why they built up so much suspense.
Puppies aren't the only danger in Paradise, however. There's also Sarah (Dianna Agron), the school sweetheart. There's an alliterative joke in there somewhere. Something like ""dogs are dangerous, but nothing can match the peril of the..."" I don't know, some word for cat.

Anyway, Sarah is an irresistible clich&eacute;, the blonde who dated the quarterback of the football team until she picked up photography, thus gaining a lens into the soul and learning the true meaning of love. At least the quarterback is original, except for the fact that he beats up science nerds and can't understand why Sarah doesn't want him and hates John for moving in on his territory. And the science nerd isn't just a science nerd. He happens to have a dad who was totally abducted by aliens so he's obsessed with rooting out all extraterrestrials at the school. All this is nothing at all like Smallville, because in that show, the blonde photographer is the same person who wants to root out the mystery behind the alien occurrences, and a different character is the love interest.

I feel bad bashing this formula so much, because I have to admit, the characters really were hot, which is what really matters. Dianna Agron of Glee fame is a girl next door of no compare, and Alex Pettyfer is, undeniably, a beautiful piece of man. I mean, in his next movie, he literally plays a guy whose main character trait is that he's really really ridiculously good looking. Based on that alone, I figured I'd be able to enjoy their romance, but man, was I wrong. This was supposed to be a superhero movie, darn it, and we end up sitting through more than an hour of plodding romance with no action whatsoever. And it's not good romance either. It's just like Twilight: all meaningful looks, lip biting, and a thirst for blood.

Maybe not the last one so much, but when this movie wasn't Smallville, it really was Twilight. The main guy has a secret that makes him an outsider at the school, but a beautiful girl is intrigued by his mystery and they fall for each other. And Loriens, unlike humans, only fall in love once and it lasts. Isn't it romantic? Blehck. Males everywhere will squirm in their seats. On the other hand, it's a perfect date movie. The guys will be excited to go, the girls will acquiesce, and then the girls will be so pleasantly surprised by the fact that the guy took them to a chick flick that they're sure to sleep with them. Except studies show that scary movies are much more likely to get you laid, so oh well.

Although the whole first hour had me teetering on the edge of boredom, what's scary is how much I actually ended up liking the movie, because, you see, the last 20 minutes kick so much ass! The action sequence is the only place you feel like Michael Bay was attached to this, and it shows. Number Six (Teresa Palmer) arrives, and she's this hot, sarcastic Aussie girl with wavy blonde hair who can kill the evil Mogadorians like nobody's business and deliver one-liners right after. She slides on her knees, hamstringing baddies while Number Four deflects plasma gun blasts with his hands, shooting them back at his foes. Six can turn invisible and teleport and generate a fire shield and all this sick stuff. Which brings up the question, why is John's main superpower the ability to turn his hands into flashlights? I mean, like, I guess that would be sort of useful, but I'd way rather be able to turn invisible. The movie has to find all these excuses to have the battles take place in dark places so that John's power is useful, and it's amusing to see how often they work it in.

Number Six was so cool that she saved the movie. The fact that she arrived at the end meant that I left feeling super stoked, which colored my whole experience with such a positive light that I couldn't help but enjoy myself. I don't know why she wasn't in the movie the entire time. Having someone fun and sarcastic was exactly what the plot needed to keep it from taking itself, and the romance, way too seriously.

So, way too much slow, clumsy romance (and don't get me wrong. I love Titanic and The Notebook), and not nearly enough action, but the premise is good enough (even if it's stolen straight from Superman), and when the fighting actually starts, it's awesome (explosions, fireballs, plasma guns, giant winged monsters). If they made a sequel, I would definitely see it. Therefore, I give I Am Number Four:

3/5 Stars

Why did John decide to reveal himself to so many people in Paradise? The film made it look like he'd had a ton of close friends at his old school, but the second they found out about him, he fled. Within days of moving to Ohio, he was willing to confide in all sorts of people. Seems pretty fickle for a Lorien who's supposed to bond forever, but maybe that same fickleness will mean that Number Six is a love interest later. Who wouldn't pick Number Six over Sarah? Honestly.

Generally speaking, the acting is engaging. However, the acting of Alex Pettyfer's sidekick is not convincing.

I had the opportunity to read the book a couple of days before watching this movie. I think the film is better. The reason is ninety percent of the book is dialogues. They can't express the action and suspense as good as  the film.

In this case, I'm happy to say, I'm writing one about an unexpectedly delightful movie.  Full disclosure: I like happy endings.  I read Roger Ebert to make fun of how he only likes depressing, angst filled movies.  I watch movies to relax, not be reminded about how horrible the world can be.

This movie was right up my alley.  I almost felt like a kid again, watching a superhero beat the bad guys again.  It was visually spectacular, some of the fight scenes made great use of super powers, the combat was well directed and fast, the characters were likeable, and even a couple of decent twists.

Really, that's the strength and weakness of this movie. It's a nostalgic movie, modeled after the lighter sci-fi films of the 80s and 90s.  If you're looking for dark drama, brooding anti-heroes, and possibly a depressing ending, this isn't the movie for you.

This is a light movie, and you have to suspend your logic and disbelief.  In some ways it reminded me of X-men series of movies.  The movie ends in such a way that there is a possibility for a sequel.

One more thing: John Smith punishes the bully and his thugs in high school and gets the girl.  I also liked the number six with her special abilities.  The special effects look cheesy, but who cares, it is an entertainment.

The brief glimpses of action and thought-provoking story are so brief that you'll miss them if the overly-serious teenage romance doesn't put you to sleep. What's weird about this movie is as ""made for the WB"" as it feels, it frequently rises above the immature crap, though most of that is due to the performance of Timothy Olyphant, which, unfortunately, is far too underplayed.

What this movie has going for it are the last 15 minutes, when FINALLY the heroes bust loose and there's superpowers bursting out everywhere, monsters battling it out, and guns and explosions galore. All the action of the climax, however, is nearly ruined by the stupid high school football field placement, which, of course, is a metaphor for the level of dim-witted teenage maturity this movie never quite breaks free from.

This is an adventure complicated by romance, rather than a romance complicated by adventure. All of which isn't to knock Twilight - it achieves what it tries to do successfully - but to point out that this is not Twilight. At all. So, enough about what it isn't. Now onto what it is.

I am Number Four is the story of a young alien who has yet to come into his powers; he is one of 9 gifted alien youngsters who were destined to protect their (now destroyed) planet. After Number 3 is killed by the marauding invading aliens who destroyed Number 4's planet, Number 4 and his protector flee to Paradise, Ohio. Number 4 (now ""John Smith"") gets involved in some teen drama (football players who pick on the science nerd, Sam [who claims that his father was abducted by aliens]) and falls for the football player's ex, Sarah. While highschool trouble brews, the evil aliens are getting closer and closer to discovering them; when ""John's"" protector goes missing, he and Sam set out to find him. Things go south from there, ending with a spectacular showdown that includes a fight between dragon-like monsters and a dog/dinosaur-like ""pet"".

I won't say that any of this is original (it's not; it's mostly all been done somewhere). But it is good, and it's done well. The acting is good, the interactions are more or less believable (even with the well-used bully-football-players theme), and it's quite interesting. Would see again. A friend of mine put it like this: ""This was a movie about aliens *and* teens - by all rights, it should have stunk."" Maybe so, but lucky for us, it didn't. 5/5 stars",1310860800,28,2076,4.790502793296089

4431783,4,B004MKMQJW,"OK, maybe it's not Oscar-worthy, and there are a few holes and predictable events here and there.  Overall, though, it's a fun flick with some decent effects and a good concept.  Based on the book (which I will read next to get any back stories), the story takes us into a coming of age tale for a kid who only knows half his story.  Through some adventures, and life-and-death situations, he comes to know his capabilities, and a few life lessons too (naturally).

The ending sort of left me wanting more, so perhaps they will film the next book about number 6?

Anyway, if you enjoy fantasy-based-in-reality type stories with just a touch of sci-fi, and some good popcorn-action, check this one out!",1310688000,4,701,4.666666666666667

I'm glad I didn't purchase this movie, I rented it from Netflix. lacking in Special features as well, only the standard ""Deleted scenes and bloopers"" reel. You would think with Blu-Ray disc being able to fit 50GBs of data that most movies would have a behind the scenes documentary. I will say this, if you are going to get it be sure to get the Blu-Ray because there is a huge difference, The animation was amazing. I will give the movie that.

I like this director D.J Curuso, he did Eagle Eye which was a great film. And Timothy Olyphant was good in this, not his best role but he stood out.

4431785,2,B004MKMQJW,"So I read the really funny review with a similar title and thought I would give this movie a go. I'm a total sucker for any kind of fantasy, scifi or fairytale, provided that it's well done. I was looking forward to an entertaining, predictable scifi action movie, with some eye candy and closing scene battle highlights. Our funny reviewer from the western shores got one thing right: the last fifteen minutes or so are cool and gripping, with a brawny and hot Aussie chick a la Tomb Raider(and I say that as a brainy brunette.) Also, I think the idea that the last surviving members of a species get killed in numerical order is kind of original. Too bad we never find out why.

Unfortunately, the rest of the movie, i.e. the painfully boring first hour and a half or so, is just full of teenage puppy love that is badly executed. There is no action, which might not necessarily be a show stopper, but there is also no real conversation, plot or character development either. Zip zilch zero. We never find out why planet Lorien was destroyed or why the Mangorians looks like a nasty cross between Underworld and Lord of the Rings. In fact, we never find out anything! The main characters might as well be painted flat and all we get is a series of cliche sentences that put you to sleep. As a sedative, this film is the tops. The only redeeming feature is that the actors who can't act are good looking, but you might as well print a poster instead of watching this.

If you want to watch a good recent scifi movie, rent Thor or the Xmen instead. They're definitely more entertaining and well-crafted that this dud of a Twilight / Green Lantern cross.",1310428800,,1653,4.470198675496689

But, I should get a part in the sequel, which should be rightly called, ""I am Number 5"" and well that would be me.

This film, apart from my absence was quite entertaining.  Number 6 seems to be a lot brighter and more versed with her powers than Number 4, who seems to be more distracted by an earthling girl that's into photography.

Henri's  (Timothy Olyphant)  performance is about the best in this film. He adds a certain level of seriousness to the film, and without this character, a lot of depth would have been lost.

The Mogadorians, who are the bad guys in this film, add a nice spark of humor to the film, they are like just so weird. There is also a group of football players that Number 4 gets to try out his powers on,  the special effects are well done throughout the film.

If you are looking for a well acted and definitive sci-fi movie then you probably should skip this one.
If you want a clear plot then you probably should skip this movie, you have to fill-in a lot of gaping holes in this plot.
If you are a die hard sci-fi fanatic then skip this movie, it is a typical ""B"" movie.

The acting is fair, the story line simple and poorly defined by most standards (except for entertainment), full of cliches and not much suspense. The premise behind the story is only brought to light sparingly throughout the movie.

However, if you can overlook all the negatives, this was actually an entertaining movie. It had a cute love story (but cliche ridden), some neat special effects and a good ending.

This combined with the wise mentor in Alex, who for me had the magic of Mister Miyagi in Karate Kid and Obiwan Kenobe in  Star Wars, provides a winning combination.

This movie made no sense and its plot was about as coherent as a reality tv show. The special effects were good, yes, but if it had no effects this movie would not have anything to stand on. The producer's standpoint is fully transparent in that the only function of the movie is to cater to a certain audience (14-16 years old).

4431815,5,B004MKMQJW,"I Am Number Four is an inspiring action movie. The story is packed with a fascinating story as well as hints of true life in a science fiction setting. In I Am Number Four, the main character is an alien whose home planet, Lorien, was destroyed by invading aliens called Mogadorians. He is Number Four and the Mogadorians are hunting down each and every one of the nine who escaped Lorien. These nine have the power, when put together, to eliminate the force of the Mogadorians.
John Smith, number four, has been moving around all his life on Earth since he got here. He was forced to change identity multiple of times by the fact that the Mogadorians were hunting him down. His guardian, Henri, tried to protect John with keeping his profile low and deleting things that got on internet about John. The Mogadorians quickly find Number Four's scent and trace him to Paradise, Ohio.
Meanwhile, John goes to a new school and makes friends and enemies already. Sarah Hart is the first girl John sees and immediately was attracted to her. Another kid named Sam is also in the alien picture without actually being an alien. His father had predicted that true aliens would land on Earth and was taken by the Mogadorians for his knowledge. Sam and John bond together and try to find his father.
Spending more time with Sarah, John realizes he is falling for her. Back on Lorien, love was eternal but that wasn't the case on Earth. However, when Henri forces John to leave Paradise, John knows he must leave but still refuses. The next day he wakes up to find Henri missing. He receives a call to meet up at a predetermined place. He goes there with Sam and finds Henri who informs him that it was actually a trap. They escape but barely and it cost Henri's life. Going to say go bye to Sarah, they get caught by the Mogadorians and the police and flee to the school. They meet up with Number Six, another girl alien. They battle with the Mogadorians, causing destruction of practically the entire building and escape narrowly.
Number Four decides to continue on his already set journey of reuniting all of the escapees of Lorien. He decides to take Sam along and says he final goodbye to his loved Sarah.
I feel I Am Number Four is an inspiring action packed movie. It shows that friends are important throughout life. They help guide you through life and through moments unbearable.

Perhaps it was the lack of depth by the leads' performances or maybe it was the fact that they were upstaged in every scene by the ""bad"" aliens.  Actually, the beagle gained more of my sympathy than the ""heroes"".  Action scenes did not disappoint, though, and were lively punctuations to an otherwise very average movie.  Even fans of Timothy Olyphant will see too little of his sexy lethality to justify sitting through the rest.  The sad part was that the premise and storyline promised to be intriquing and full of potential; the movie just never quite got there.  Movies that doesn't pretend to be significant (and those of us who see lots and lots of movies have experienced plenty of these) can be satisfying to watch in their own way.  A movie that sets itself up as something more significant and isn't, lies to the audience and creates frustration because we expected something more.

Turns out, the producers of the film were the same ones who brought us Smallvlle seasons 1-8. So if you're a Smallville fan, you'll probably love this flick.

There are a few cons. When viewed on anything other than an HDTV with BR player, the film is so darkly unlit as to make it aggravating to watch. The special features are not very heroic; there's a featurette of the actress playing Number 6. That's about it for the DVD. The BR does has quite a bit more, but given the weight of the project - a hopeful launching of a film franchise in and of itself - this movies extra features are pretty skimpy.

The movie is fun, and the special effects are awesome if you are watching in HDTV and BR. I watched it a couple of times back-to-back, trying to notice details I missed before.

John meets a photographer girl Sarah (Dianna Agron) who has been dating pushy Mark (Jake Abel).  Gradually John's alien powers emerge (his hands can be flashlights and he as extraordinary powers of physical strength), he puts his now competitor for in Sarah's affections Mark in place in fights, reveals his identity to Sam who bonds because of his father's being number three, and the trio - John, Sarah and Sam - are off and running.  So far so good for a teenage love n' stuff movie.

The problems (not only for the trio, but also for the audience) begin as the stalking aliens appear - hilariously ugly creatures with silly guns and manners of communicating - as well as a strange fighting girl (we discover later is the one designated number Six - Teresa Palmer).  John, despite Henri's protective insistence that they move on, decides to stay because he has found love with Sarah.  From this point the film just becomes silly as flying squirrels become immense, multifanged prehistoric monsters and the plot deteriorates into a m&eacute;lange of gore, flying body parts, transmogrification of a pet dog into a beastie, etc etc etc.

The film is squeezed out a novel 'Pittacus Lore' by James Frey and Jobie Hughes, molded into its present screenplay form by Alfred Gough, Miles Millar,  and Marti Noxon, and stirred by director D.J. Caruso.  Before it becomes hilariously silly there are some pretty decent performances by Olyphant, Pettyfer and McAuliffe that make the film worth watching.  It is a film that will please some (according to box office receipts it was quite successful) and lose others.  Grady Harp, June 11",1308009600,3,2100,4.837988826815643

There are enough in-depth reviews, so I'll spare mine. But, I will definitely check out the sequel because I liked the story line enough.

I am from the generation of Led Zeppelin, Emerson Lake and Palmer, Yes and Black Sabbath. When I compare ""my"" music to the newest music I say the new music is fluff, light on talent... full of pretty faces but no sole. (no hate mail please) Some of the newest films are the same way. Lots of pretty faces and bodies. That is how I see this movie. When I watched it, I gave it a solid 3 Amazon Stars... that is , for the first two thirds of the film. The last third came to life with some good action. This bumped my rating to four stars. It is obvious that this is the first of a ""few"" films to follow. I can see now that the first two thirds of the movie was to set up the characters and story line. I am convinced that the films that follow will be along the lines of X-Men.

They made to many changes that I didn't agree with and then parts that I would have expected to see... the visions of home, the story of why they are after them in the first place, none of it was really there.

The biggest complaint I have is the relationship between Henri and John is NOTHING like the book. In the book the part I LOVED was the loving honest relationship between them and in the movie hes just a brat kid who won't do what hes told. Not to mention that they only look to be about a 10 year age difference in the characters. In the beginning when I first saw Henri I was like really?...who would think thats his dad?

(Spoiler Alert)
Then the way they portray Sam, like a kid that ONLY SOMETIMES has a problem with his fathers alien abductors... He knows John is an alien and yet just texts him and says ""Hey come on over I know what you are"" and they talk??? In the book Sam is scared out of his mind and with good reason... he just found out that his friend is an ALIEN... as far as he knows could be the ones who abduct his father.

If you have read the book just know that the action scene at the end isn't as long or strategic in the movie instead its shorter and faster pace.

For example, when someone gets killed, he disintegrates into dust, vanishing into the wind.  And two large monsters fight, with the winner mauling the neck of the other, who also disintegrates into dust.

I was also surprised that there was NO bonus feature on the beautiful Dianna Agron, who was the love interest.

4431851,3,B004MKMQJW,"Baby boomers will ""get"" the reference in the title -- couldn't resist it. Ah, if only I Am Number One were even close to the original series, The Prisoner. Alas, it's not to be, but that's not to say that this film is a total loss if you're looking for a date movie or a Saturday afternoon popcorn-cruncher.

In a blend of the displaced but hunky alien of Starman with the telekinetic oomph of the Witch Mountain movies on steroids and the prerequisite serious teenage heaviness of Twilight and certain Life with Archie comics, I Am Number Four strives to launch a series by setting up a teen magazine contender as a haunted yet stalwart hero searching for truth, justice and a lovely young lady. Sound derivative? If you saw Disturbia and Rear Window, the similarity cannot be denied, though Shia LeBeouf's performance often transcends the material in the earlier film helmed by the same director, D.J. Caruso.

Alex Pettyfer will no doubt flutter many a teeny bopper's heart but he tends to speak in a brooding monotone without much facial expression. Understated would be a kind way to describe his performance. He was being directed, so we can't be sure if these were all his choices, since he seems so have more personality in the bloopers.

Teresa Palmer plays the Lara Croft-type super catsuit lady -- a modern-day movie and TV action icon, by the way, that was really created in 1962 by Honor Blackman on TV's The Avengers and perfected by Diana Rigg, who replaced her on the same series in 1965. Dianna Agron is earnest as the object of Pettyfer's affection, but resembles Palmer to the point where you're not sure who's doing what until you sort out the characters (and hear Palmer's Aussie accent).

Best aspects: Timothy Olyphant's standout performance, bringing depth to his character, excellent special effects and some really creepy, easy-to-loathe villains (whose sadistic cruelty makes this a little too strong for younger viewers).

No commentary on the bonus features, but there is a set of bloopers and a short feature focusing on the lovely Ms. Palmer.",1306972800,2,2073,4.861189801699717

4431854,3,B004MKMQJW,"In a nutshell...Number Four is fourth in a series of nine aliens who have fled to earth to escape but now there are only six aliens (Loriens).  Number 3 gets killed early on and Number Four a.k.a John Smith is made instantly aware due to a brutal brand that appears on his leg (oh...this happens during a night of wild partying on the beach).  Apparently, all Loriens receive the brand as the others are killed in numerical order.  Now come the ""killers"" the alien hunters or Mogadorians.  Okay...stick with me here...since the killings are sequential, #4(Alex Pettyfer) knows he's next, so with his protector, Henri (Timothy Olyphant), they instantly pack up and take off, burning every souvenir, photo, even the license plate off their car which...duh...is metal, so of course there's that tiny scrap of evidence that will lead the Mogadorians right to them.

Confused?  So was I.  There was a Gecko that snuck into Henri's bag and then turned into an adorable puppy when they reached Paradise, Ohio and we hear the words every parent dreads, ""Can I keep him?""  Henri, for all his Yoda-ish knowledge, of course has no idea that the puppy is some sort of alien.  We know it's not a Gecko and we know it's not a puppy...but what the heck IS it?  Okay...still with me?...John decides the second he sets foot in their new house that he's bored (whine) and wants to go to school.  Henri reminds him to blend in, not stick out, not give any clues to help the Mogadorians find him.  Day one at high school is a nightmare of bullying in the First Degree.  Why on God's green earth would a kid, who recently narrowly escaped with his life, knowing he's some sort of ""chosen one,"" and going through major teenage angst WANT to go to school...and, after meeting the butt-head, big man on campus, WANT to go back?  I think that may have been something they covered in the book...but got left on the cutting room floor.  The whole time people are being slammed into lockers, having their locker explode with red goop, you know...typical bullying stuff, I'm thinking, ""Just LEAVE.""  But...ah-ah-ah...the allure of school and the daily humiliation is Sarah (Dianna Agron)...who, wait for it, is the ex-girlfriend of the Head Bully.

This movie had so many clichs (OF COURSE Loriens only fall in love once in their lives and that just so happens...wonder of wonders...to be our heroine) and confusing plot lines (why were the evil aliens chasing our Number 4?).  I just never got into it.  Fortunately, Number 6 (Teresa Palmer) shows up and then there's some pretty good fight scenes that liven things up.  But, if you took any really cheesy romance/alien/teenage angst movie and combined it, you would have ""I am Number Four.""

I think that the only redeeming value of this movie was the very end with the fight scenes (enter cute puppy alien who actually is one of the good guys).  Those were entertaining and almost helped make up for the other hour and a half of boredom.  They did hint at a sequel...after all, here was Number 6...he was Number 4...all that's missing is Number 5 and 7 through 9.  But please, dear Touchstone, hear my plea.  Let ""I Am Number 4"" be the last...unless you want to do something wild and crazy and make an ORIGINAL film that is fun from start to finish.

My advice?  Wait for it to come out on HBO or regular t.v. and learn from my mistake...don't waste your money.",1306886400,,3385,4.645378151260505

The man is just beautiful. So I bought this movie because he is in it. Not to say that the movie is awful, it is actually quite interesting. It is about a group of ET's that came to earth as small children escaping the invasion of their home planet. For reasons that I may have missed they are numbered and killed in the order of their numbers. So Number 1 has to die before Number 2, but the goal is to ultimately kill them all. They have the power to return to the planet and destroy the invanders so the invanders come to earth looking for them. Each child is partnered with a ""protector"" which oddly does not have as much power or strength as the child they are protecting. That kind of threw me, but whatever. So NE-Who. The movie revolves around Number Four -hence the title. He is protected by Timothy Olyphant (lucky ass) and is next on the list for execution.  Like I said it is a campy movie that has holes in it, but I have to admit that I did enjoy it on some level. What I did not like was the lack of care the main dude had for the dog. I am a dog lover and that dog was protecting that dude and he couldn't giv-a-funk that bothered me.  But other than that give the movie a chance, it is kind of fun.

Here's what I think happened.  I think the movie set out to be a special effects superhero blockbuster, but then realized it didn't really have much character in the protagonist to build on, and so it wisely figured to cut the funding necessary to be a blockbuster.  With a cut budget, it padded much of the movie with a romantic teeny-bopper subplot, and saved all the good action-packed special-effect stuff until the very end.  I bet it made a good profit too.

Alex Pettyfer looks good but doesn't have a very wide emotional range, but I'm sure that's not what the producers wanted.  Ms. Argon inherits the Kristen Stewart role admirably.  Reliable Timothy Oliphant does well with little to work with.  Kevin Durand's Tim Curry impersonation is fun and Jake Abel's jock is appropriately smarmy.

2)His new friend, the science geek.

3)The attractive female who becomes the love interest of the new kid.

4) The bullies who taunt and attack the new kid and his geeky friend. Oh, and get this - the  leader  of the bullies....his ex-girlfriend is the attractive female lead who's now going out with the sensitive and misunderstood new guy at school/main character. He's really angry about this.

And hey, there were all these cool and original scenes of the bullies harassing the new guy and his buddy at their lockers in the crowded hallways....wow, I've never seen that in a high school film!

Such an amazingly original set of characters.

Oh, and how many high schools have you seen where everyone looks like they're in their 20s and they're ALL amazingly good looking?

There were some interesting action scenes, a somewhat interesting sci-fi storyline, and - admittedly - some beautifully filmed scenes in this film. However, the worn out ""high school film"" formula made this a tiring watch. Too bad, it had some potential that was wasted on the cliches and predictable character development.",1306713600,5,1233,5.029556650246305

In all honesty though, I liked it. The plot moved decently well, the acting was pretty good, and the special effects were pretty sweet. I look forward to a terribly corny, overdone sequel. I think the acting by Timothy Olyphant saved this movie from being a total flop.

4431875,4,B004MKMQJW,"I did not see this movie in the theater,  I think that it might have been more enjoyable if I had done so just because it is in many ways, a big screen action movie.  The movie will appeal to fans of super hero movies, as well as action junkies.  I would also have to agree with some of the other reviews that compared this movie to the Smallville and Super Man Franchise,  but as some one once said their are only so many keys on a piano, so of course certain movies are going to seem similar.  If you enjoyed this genre you will most likely enjoy this movie.  Timothy does a good job acting in this movie,  he tends to fall into that category of actor who always plays the same person,  not a bad thing but he is who he is.  The actress from Glee surprised me with an unusually good performance,  I thought that she actually created a character for this movie as opposed to just being Quinn from Glee, however I do not think that this movie would appeal to fans of Glee unless the LOVE Quinn in which case they might enjoy this movie, and for these people I would suggest renting the movie, borrowing it, or maybe watching it on Netflix watch instantly or cable when it becomes available,  I do not think that this is a movie that any one will need to rush to see,  If you were a fan of the book, which I never read you have probably already seen it, and if you have not seen it,  I think it will be easy to wait instead of paying top dollar for it right now.  I think that this movie is worth watching,  I will not be buying a copy,  I watched it on demand, I payed 5.99 to watch it twice, over the course of the 24 hour period that I had it,  I did spring for the extra buck to get it in HD.  I would have to recommend getting this in HD, as much of the special effects and action sequences will probably not be as Shiny in regular formats,  This is defiantly a big screen movie,  I would recommend turning the lights off and sitting down to watch this movie, so often now a days people multi task,  turn a movie on and do other stuff,  But this movie tries very hard to build a story.  It builds up over the course of the movie,  in the same way the main character,  who I thought did an average acting job,  it is not good and it is not bad, grows so does the movie progress.  The action mainly takes place at the end of the movie,  in this regard it reminded me a little bit of the movie Equilibrium,  (but that movies last action sequence was much shorter and the early action sequences were more plentiful).  I would have to say in order to compare it to something that it is better then the first x-men movie,  Because they had to introduce every one they kind of dropped the action sequences.

I did want to add another thought which is that,  I wish the initial fight scene had shown more of that persons powers or the term that they used in the movie which is ""legacies"",  it would have been cooler if that initial confrontation had a bit more oomph  to it,  but I am guessing that he might be younger, then the others,  It would have been nice if they had clarified the ages of them all,  I am not sure why But I assumed that they were all around the same age, until mid way into the movie when you see number six, who I think is at least a couple of years older.

So this movie is worth sitting down and watching not from the corner of your eye, or you might miss some of the better acting and little things that made this movie worth while for me.  I do not think that I will be buying it,  but I have watched it,  I have described the movies and such that if you are a die hard fan of you should buy or at least watch this movie,  if you are not that big a fan then I would have to recommend waiting until it drops in price, or until it comes out on cable,  another option I forgot to mention is the pre used copies you can get at blockbuster, that would be a great option as well for people to save a little bit of cash.  Bottom line I think this is a good movie,  I would highly recommend watching it, even if you have to wait for the price to drop a little or to find it on cable.  I hope that this review helps any one who was curious about this movie,  Unfortunately the negative reviews here on amazon are not particularly well thought out,  I think this project if much better then they made it out to be, and that you will enjoy it,  I just do not think it is super important that you rush our and buy it or rent it right this second, unless you are a huge super hero fan or Glee, she does a great job,  One other plus for me, was that in most super hero movies you get one guy, in this movie their are a number of super powered people that he has to find, and they are being hunted,  kinda like xmen they have to learn to work together,  the powers and that stuff was much more original then a movie say like, Heros,  and the bad guys were also quite well created.  Some people wanted more background but I think with as much story as they gave in the beginning people would have gotten even more bored before the big action numbers.",1306540800,3,5059,4.025100401606426

4431877,2,B004MKMQJW,"Not having read any of these teen-angst-superpower-secret-lives novels, I have to admit that I enjoyed the '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twilight/dp/B001P5HRMI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twilight</a>' films. But having been exposed to and experienced that world, I am less enthused with the stunning array of wannabes that have been spawned in their wake. Had no idea this movie was based on a similar set of teen storybooks (learned it only after reading fellow Amazon reviews) thinking instead this might be an original concept. So to say I'm disappointed would be an understatement.

That's not to fault the actors, all of whom did a decent job in their archetypical roles. But even solid acting can't save a director's snooze-fest. And this reveals another pitfall of the uninspired - plagiarism, intentional or not, can be deadly for a film. Rarely are copies, in any media, as bold or engaging as the original.

Where Twilight had a quiet electricity, both in terms of performances and tempo, the same formula in Four is incredibly stodgy and the pace molasses slow. Where Twilight is understated, Four is shallow. And I won't count the stunning array of plotholes in this flick, suffice to say there are quite a few. I often wonder if these directors ever take the time to work out the basic framework of these projects in pre-production? How difficult can it be to sit down and ask the writers some basic queries? Seems like there's no end to the simple questions with simple answers that elude these filmmakers.

Won't count them, but I'll highlight a few:

- If their intent is to destroy worlds, and according to Timothy Olyphant's character, that's their purpose: Why are there only a half dozen bad guys? Is their entire race comprised of six humanoids and their two whatchamacallits? And since they were so easily killed, doesn't that put a crimp on their destroy-the-world campaign? Why haven't the bad guys sent in an army? And why stop at an army if your intent is to destroy a planet - wouldn't you basically have an entire battle fleet? In other words, your intent is to destroy a world - what do you do? Send in six of your men with two attack creatures to slowly hunt down the remaining victims from your previous conquest AND THEN set out to destroy the world. No one sees a logical problem with this?

- Why are the bad guys hunting them in order? Is it important? Symbolic? Does it have some significance to the symbols? If so, why wasn't it explained? How long would that have taken - thirty seconds in the film?

- Why only one bodyguard per Number? If you were testifying against the mob - the FBI throws a virtual mini-army around you. Is it the 'Spartan' thing? One man = one army? Another 30 seconds, maybe less for an explanation.

And I'm only asking those few because I don't want this review to become thesis-length, which it easily could do.

There really isn't a nice way of framing this next critique. But I'm really amazed by how incredibly stupid some directors are when it comes to family pets - especially dogs. I'm not certain the current crop of film school graduates understands that there is a vast amount of pet lovers in America, their primary audience and market. And that market does not like seeing pets, even fictional ones, hurt in films. And in truth, stupidity would be a step up from emotional disconnect.

Because if you lack empathy - you're not human. I'm not being glib, I mean it seriously and literally.

My definition of 'humanity' requires empathy as one of the building blocks. If you're missing it, then you're fundamentally flawed. That isn't to say you're not functional, so I'm not suggesting serial killer or the like, but clearly you're damaged goods. And I would certainly never trust you in any capacity, under any circumstance, for any reason however trivial. Essentially, if you think it's okay to hurt a family pet - even a fictional one - you're a certified freak in my book. And again, I would never trust you or ever turn my back to you.

Nor watch any of your films.

I think directors or soon-to-be directors need to quantify who and what they want to be on a professional level. Art house artist, non-traditionalist deviant and avant garde isolationist - all have their fans squirreled away in dark pockets of academia and fringe chic bars filled with the smoke from Gauloises-stained fingers. But acknowledgement and future employment typically goes to the pleasure providers. Think about it.",1306540800,2,4515,4.864583333333333

Here is my opinion:
* Did I like this movie/video? -- Yes, I thought it was action filled and had a unique premise by the original author.
* Better that 'Twilight'? -- Most definitely yes. I gave it 4 stars. (I also think I'm getting a little sick of vampire movies where the female lead is such an stupid ass.)
* More geared towards teens than adults? -- I would have to say yes. Still a thrilling ride for adults, though. Plus, I am a fan of Timothy Olyphant -- Justified is now in my top 5 favorite TV shows. He did a great job as the ""father"" in this film.
* Will there be more? -- Its hard to say. Box office standards being what they are...
* Would I watch a sequel? -- I believe I would, but I think it needs the same or a better vision by the director/producers, etc.
* How does it compare to other action/sci-fi films released in the last few years? -- I've noticed an annoying  trend in the last few years that is driving me a little crazy. Large film studios are sticking with the ""tried and true"" instead of exploring new stories, or new ideas. Which is why we are seeing multiple sequels of the same story (ie: Marvel and DC comics being made over and over and over...) or they are RE-making films from other countries -- like The Ring, Wicker Park, The Tourist, Three Men and a Baby, Let Me In, The Uninvited, etc.
* What about a description of what you like or dislike about the movie? -- Aahh ah, ah! As they say in Dr. Who, ""Spoilers, sweetie."" Descriptions are everywhere on the Web. Trailers tell a portion of it, and if you are desperate for details, there are several reviews listed here that may help you, or not. I'd say, ""Give it a try, what the hay? It's only $3.99 and fairly entertaining at that.""

Other complaints and issues with the latest movies in general:
What happened to our own story tellers?
What is with the 3-D craze? (I think that the 3-D is just a way to pry another $4-$5 out of our almost empty wallets for ill-fitting, ugly glasses.)
Why are we searching so hard for a decent movie hero or heroine when we have books filled with them?
Why are film studios not looking for those books and making good scripts of them?

(1.) Confusing, incomplete storyline of dumping aliens that look and act precisely like any US teen despite the fact that coming - somehow, not explained - from another planet with different gravity, Sun light spectrum, surface biology, etc. and would take centuries at the speed of light to get to our little rock was conveniently and cheaply conceived thus ending up looking just like us.
(2.) Unimaginative advanced aliens still using knives; 1990s lasers; the usual sloth looking creature pets; light emanating from their hands and vampire like running/jumping skills all of which have been used in countless movies before.
(3.) Oh, alien death by turning into clouds of gray swirling dust - sorry, done in vampire flicks many times before. Speaking of aliens - isn't the tattoo graphic design thing getting a bit overused.
(4.) Stereotypic assortment of characters from dumb cops to father figure helper to jocks to nerds to outcast cute girl to kick-ass alien chick. Oh, and lovable pet. Acting, as usual except for pet, daytime TV castoffs.

********EDITED***********

Well, after receiving some comments about my review, I think I will try again.
It is NOT the worst movie Ive ever seen, I was a little over the top on that, but I really did not like the movie. Although I respect the hard work of the people involved in this project (thank GOD we do movies in Hollywood), something didn't work properly. I believe the acting was poor, the relationship between the two main characters didn't show any hint of evolution. Was it love at first sight maybe?
The plot evolves so slow that once you get to the main action, it does not fit in the story. Its like ""wake them up with a few explosions"". But, let me say that the effects were REALLY GOOD, I did like that. There isn't enough background story about the other planet, or the situation they are in. It just happens. Some may like this kind of introduction, but I was expecting something else.
Perhaps Iam wrong, and I was hoping for something that wasn't there at the beginning.
Who knows...next time maybe.

4431891,1,B004MKMQJW,"Firstly, I've never read the book this film is based on.  I don't really care to.  If the book is like this film, even at its base level, then someone owes Shuster and Siegel some credit!

I had no expectations for this film when I plopped down to watch it.  This may be a big part in why I didn't loathe but actually found some entertainment value.  The story is a mix of Superman, Dark City, V, The Matrix, X-Men, and a HUGE helping of Twilight.  Nothing in this film is original.  Nothing is really developed.  Nothing is mind blowing in the effects department or structure.  I know you might be wondering why I even gave the thing two stars, and I have to tell you that the reasons are pretty shallow.
WHY I ENJOYED MYSELF:
-The action was well paced and at moments thrilling despite offering nothing new in the narrative department.
-The cliche's and cribbing from other sources, filmed and written, became funny and fun at a certain point.  You've got your evil Dark City Aliens, your Terminator super alien, even the plot seems a lot like Smallville(the writers of the film also created that show...hmmmm).  The special effects, while good, aren't original or new.  The lead character has 'abilities' like any super hero who finds out they're super heroes while in high school.  There's even a goofy 'playing with my new powers' montage ala Spider-Man(which the writers of this film ghost wrote for and wrote a draft of the sequel's screenplay...hmmmm).
-The hunky and generically pretty young cast actually did a good job.  The romance between alien and human is fairly effective.  It's a lot better written and believable than the one in the Twilight Saga.
-It has creatures!!!!  Big ILM created monsters that battle other creatures and eat up people.  I'm a cheap date and wasn't expecting this aspect of the film and was happy for its inclusion.
-It's not dull, it's not smart or deep, but it moves fast.

Okay, yeah all superficial, I know.  It's not a good movie, but one I caught on a good day.
WHAT IS NOT REALLY THAT GOOD ABOUT THE FILM:
-The premise invovles a secret race of aliens, who of course look human, hiding out on earth.  Why do they look human?  Are they just disguised as humans?  I don't know.  The film never bothers to let us in.  Their planet was distroyed by another group of aliens that look like a cross between the creatures in Dagon and the aliens in Dark City.  Why'd they destroy their home planet?  Don't know.  But our baddies want to take over earth, OF COURSE! Why?  Don't know again.  Our good aliens are here, specially chosen to protect earth from the bad ones.  Why?  AGAIN, I DON'T KNOW!  Gripe number one, and a gripe I have with most films of the last few years, MOVIES DON'T TELL CONTAINED STORIES ANYMORE!  This film wreaks of a 'pilot' film.  In otherwords, despite knowing whether it will make enough money to warrant a sequel, let alone a franchise, a bunch is left open for another film.  This was very disappointing when it happened in The Golden Compass, but that was a MUCH better movie.  I have nothing against making sequels or turning things into franchises.  It's been done before and it has worked before.  Just look how many Planet of the Apes films there are(personally think this series of films invented the movie franchise).  But instead of setting up a franchise, how about telling a full dramatic tale with room for a sequel.  Don't just not tell a story because you know you can tell more of it in a sequel.  ANNOYING.  Just think how much better paced Iron Man 2 would've been if they had just left out all of the Samuel L. Jackson stuff out.
-Secondly, but goes along with the first, we are introduced to a main character who has lost his father, his pops is missing and it ties into the film's main plot.  Never resolved.  Never even dramatized.  How did his father find out so much about the aliens?  Why would they kidnap him instead of killing him?  I DON'T KNOW!  Why is this a point of fact in the film if it GOES NOWHERE????
-Nothing original.  The costumes of the villains is typical movie villain crap.  Black on black with a black trench coat.  Even their weapons are boring call backs to Star Ship Troopers or even Star Wars for that matter.
-The romance while believable becomes pointless in the third act.  It succombs to mindless action set pieces that our female lead has nothing to do with and has no effect on.  Why is she there?
-NO MORE FRIGGIN' BULLIES IN MOVIES. EVER.  I am soooo sick of bullies in movies.  They are cartoons.  They serve no purpose beyond plot functions and cheap dramas.  This film of course has one and he is more snarky looking then actually intimadating.  I've had bullies in my life and I've rarely seen them act the way they do in movies.  If you're going to have a bully in your film, why not make him a CHARACTER.  Why is he a jerk.  Does he do anything else when he's not elaborately bullying our heroes?
-Our aliens, good or bad, seem to want to hide from us, but they don't seem to be trying very hard.  Doing supernatural things all over and in the front of folks.  Our villains look so funnily out of place EVERYWHERE, how could they be kept secret for ANY amount of time.
-The film starts out with our hero knowing he's an alien(through painful narration) but only finds out in the first act that he has super strength, mind powers, and nifty flash lights in his hands.  He's only mildly shocked by this and for some reason he knows how to use and perform with his NEW powers with ease.  We never see him discovering them in awe or fear.  They jus show up, and then he's super jumping and flash lighting things into the air like an old pro.
-NO MORE SHOTS OF LEADS OR VILLAINS WALKING CALMLY AWAY FROM SOMETHING EXPLODING IN THE BACKGROUND.  It's not cool anymore.  It's funny, because it been so over done and become a HUGE cliche'.  STOP.  Enough said.
-Finally, why why do the aliens turn to black dust when they are killed ala Buffy the Vampire Slayer?  Why does this happen?  Is it because all those dead alien bodies would pile up and cause SOMEONE to notice something strange is happening in the state of Denmark?  This is such a cheap way to cover that plot hole it annoys me.  It's also a convenient way to have people stab and blow up other living things in bloodless ways.  Wouldn't want to lose the coveted PG-13 and negate the brain dead tweens from getting their fix, now would we?

I could go on more.  I really could.  This film is equal to a Sy-Fy Original Movie to me with better effects and a much bigger budget.  It made me smile for the wrong reasons and entertained me.  It's so obviously trying to be a new super hero franchise with a Twiligh-like romance thrown in for the girls.  It wants to please all and doesn't seem to want to attempt to be coherant.  Maybe the sequel will be coherant.  Of course modern movies don't have to be coherant anymore.  They'll all have sequels to anser some questions and muddle things up for the next sequel to explain, and so on, and so on, and so on......The mythology of this film is so murky that I just stopped caring and enjoyed the dumb thing on its own terms.  Plus, MONSTERS. Oh, the monsters.  My favorite laugh out loud moment in the film involves the climax's monster fight.  You see, the villains travel in a large truck containing three alien beasts.  Why?  Do they help?  It sure seems they would make it harder to hide from humans in long black trucks that jiggle and roar with monsters in the back.  Whatever.  Anyway, the creatures are released at the end, and our heroes dog, who started the film as a lizard but for some reason shape shifted into a beagle, transforms into a giant monster.  It fights one of the bad monsters in the school shower.  When our hero comes upon the creature it turns to the camera, basically to the audience as well, revealing its face.  It looks like a mutant dog from the Hulk film, and I laughed out loud literally.  Why is this guardian creature here?  Why didn't it reveal itself to the protagonist earlier or at all?  Do the bad monsters have the ability to shape shift?  Who sent the monster to protect the kid?  Did the kid's human in the form of Timothy Olyphant, but really an alien also, know about the shape shifting dog monster? Did......DAMN!  I'm asking more questions that the film didn't answer!  Got to stop.

Wait, I think I hate this move. ;)

Blu ray is lame.  A short doc on this Austrailian actress and her martial arts training. YAWN. Some deleted scenes that hold no impact beyond have a scene where we meet a character's mother played by Karen Allen(Raider of the Lost Ark, Starman).  And we get some bloopers.  If the actors were more charismatic this might have been funny.  That's it.  Not that it matters.

PS: The director of this film is DJ Caruso, who started off his major film career making the great and little seen The Salton Sea.  Hey, DJ, could you please justify your talent and get back to making films like that, pretty please??????",1306281600,7,9010,4.4735547355473555

I Am Number Four is perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. It felt like one of those straight to video B-grade crap you find for two dollars at the bottom of some bargain bin deal that you only look through because it's there. Everything about this movie is horrible: the story is pathetic- teenage kids(who look like 24)with powers (sort of like a toddler version of X-Men) fight evil aliens (rip offs of the truly creepy aliens in Dark City). The acting is pretty bad. When the ""movie"" introduced the ""sexy-girl-blowing-up-her-house-why-she-walks-in-slow-mo-set-to-rock-music"" I actually started laughing. The fact that people stared at me at my local theater with frowns was just plain sad. How stupid are American audiences becoming? Pretty stupid to have this movie chart at number 2 during its release. In fact writing this, having to actually explain why this movie is bad-beyond-belief is just making me nauseated. It doesn't even dignify a review. I felt embarrassed that my friends sat engrossed throughout the entire thing like it was Citizen Kane or something while I waited in the lobby counting carpet stains.

4431900,2,B004MKMQJW,"""I Am Number Four""  is an action science-fiction thriller with an interesting premise.  Number Four (Alex Pettyfer) is an alien whose home planet, Lorien, was destroyed by an evil race of hit men called the Mogadorians.  Four is one of nine Lorien children sent to Earth to escape their planet's destruction.  Legend says that they will eventually gain enough power to vanquish the Modadorians.  So the Mogadorians have tracked them to Earth, intent on wiping out all nine.  One, Two and Three have already been killed.  Four must act quickly and decisively, but first he must hide in plain sight.  How?  By enrolling in his local high school.

This movie is all over the place and far too ambitious.  Sometimes it aspires to be ""The Matrix,"" other times ""The X Files,"" and still others a John Hughes flick.

The story centers around Number 4 and his protecter, as they constantly are on the run from.... some other... aliens, because...well...who know why but that is the plot of the movie. Number 4's power consist of having flash light hands, and jumping really high...whooo. The first half of the movie is the best when he arrives at his new school and of course tries to lay low. Unfortunately the big bad bullies will see that the new guy will receive his just deserts..for..being...new.. i guess. Then Number 4 falls in love with a girl at his new school and is willing to risk everything for love, but the movies gets real Twilight after that. I am not just saying that because there is a love interest plot, he says things like: ""Once our kind loves another we love forever."" Even though they have know each other for two days. I think that Edward and Number 4 should fight to the death for stupid love movie supremacy. The aliens hunting him are a joke, and i much prefer the clich bullies to the cookie cutter aliens. Guess what the aliens want....THEY WANT TO RULE THE WORLD!! Imagine that aliens who want to kill everyone and take our planet.

4431914,3,B004MKMQJW,"No gory violence, constant swearing, awkward sex scenes made it a good choice for movie night with our two teenage boys. In that way, the movie was worth watching. It started off good, lagged for about half an hour or so, then ended well.

The film is sci-fi action with decent special effects and acting. It is about a teen with superpowers, John Smith played by Alex Pettyfer, who is one of nine original survivors from another planet. The first three have been killed by aliens who want to take over Earth and John is next; his guardian warrior Henri, wonderfully played by the gorgeous Timothy Olyphant, whisks him from place to place once routinely as his cover is blown.

In his new town and identity, he meets Sarah, played by Dianna Agron, and becomes serious about her. I felt the romance thing was not really credible since John is told repeatedly by Henri to stay under the radar but within two days, he has the hots for the former girlfriend of the school bully. I found Sarah boring but I did like the guy who played the high school bully (and also quarterback of the football team and son of the sheriff). I also liked the 'science nerd' Sam who John befriends.

When the alien hunters known as Mogadorians kill the third survivor - killings are sequential - the fourth Lorien knows it's time to put on his track shows.  Sounds good, right?  Well wait until the YA source material kicks in.

Number 4 is ""John Smith"" (Alex Pettyfer) a kid whose appearance was perfect for casting purposes, but moronic for plot purposes.  You see, John wants to fit in, to blend, to hide in the shadows.  Despite his guardian Henri (Timothy Olyphant, who gets far too little screen time) possessing some serious powers and better computer hacking skills than those in Napoleon Dynamite's dreams, John is nonetheless going to stand out since he's the prototype for every ""big man on campus"" since the 1950s.  In their new location, John goes to school and immediately bonds with Sarah (Dianna Agron), the clichd social outcast who is far too beautiful to actually be a social outcast in any school known to humanity.  The two soon spend time together admiring Sarah's photography, John's ability to throw a pigskin a quarter mile, each others' attractiveness.  The Twilight formula ensues: staring contests, inane dialogue, more staring.  Then the Mogadorians show up to kill John.

We don't really know WHY they want to kill John, or why they're going in order.  Maybe it's some sort of celestial Hatfield vs. McCoy thing?  We also don't know what's up with the one-by-one approach to the murders.  Maybe they're following some interstellar Lorien phone book like Arnold in Terminator?  Maybe this is just a poorly done YA version of the Predator series?  And that's probably the biggest flaw of this movie.  Too many loose ends.  There are several more that I haven't mentioned.  Nearly nothing is revealed about the feud, the extermination, the history.  Do they live next to Alf or Klingons?  Do they have special powers on their home planet like they do on Earth?

The aspect I quite enjoyed was the combined special effects and action.  There were clear, crisp renditions in which the scene could be realized, absorbed, and appreciated.  The fighting scenes, with or without magic, were well choreographed and fully developed.  Special powers are appropriately extraordinary, with lasers and lights popping up with vibrancy and power from just about every orifice.  Even when John's ""dog"" gets in on the action it's exciting and filmed from appropriate angles and speeds.  Take note special effects coordinators and cameramen; the shaky-cam is not necessary.  In fact, we're sick of it.

Since the source material was originally for doe-eyed, hormonally imbalanced 14 year-olds, you can guess where this film ends up.  Rest assured, goodness and justice prevails, with hints of future righting of the universe's problems.  I guess the intended audience would be perpetually distracted by the cast's dreaminess, which is fine for this type of movie.  The subplots were too underdeveloped for me, however.  Decent popcorn movie for date night.

John Smith is the 4th of only 9 ""gifted"" survivors from the planet Lorien. Mogadorians killed the 3rd survivor, now it is his time. Can John Smith and his guardian warrior Henri join forces with the other survivors in order to save Earth?

""I Am Number Four"" has a decent central plot. However, the film deals with it awfully, failing to establish various aspects of the plot like; why are the Mogadorians so intent on killing the last 9? What exactly are Lorien superpowers? And what exactly are these aliens? The lack of detail between the history of these 2 species really bothered me as while I was watching the film, all these questions were popping up in my head that were only being partially answered through the dialogue/narration in the film as opposed to actual action sequences of the war. The director could have taken it to another level here but took the easy way out which really took away from the interest and depth of the story.

Now onto the subplot. The subplot is essentially the cliche romantic triangle between John, Sarah and her popular ex boyfriend Mark who instantly becomes his enemy. The subplot is rather contrived and implausible. Paraphrasing from film dialogue; after Sarah breaks off the relationship with Mark, Mark convinces the school that Sarah is a bitch, turning her into a social outcast. Therefore enabling Sarah to reflect and find herself through photography. John is touched by her inner turmoil and they spend the middle of the film engaging in meaningful gazing and pointless dialogue ""your hands are warm"", with the central plot basically put on the back burner. With this film, the central and subplot are like 2 completely separate films. They are not woven together at all. Note how the Mogadorians are conveniently absent for a good couple of weeks to allow Mark and Sarah to hit off whereas in the beginning of the film, they appear to be right on John and Henri's trail.

During this time, John also manages to befriend Sam who's father knew about Loriens and Mogadorians but has been missing for years. Again, it is highly implausible that a human would know of their existence let alone have his son befriend a Lorien and the film does not explain what happened to Sam's father despite a montage of Henri investigating his father's history. The father is one of the film's many plot devices that lead nowhere and are basically a waste of time.

Then one night, the Mogs manage to track John, Sarah and Sam but only after Mark reveals their location... but if the Mogs can track John from Hawaii (or wherever he was) to Ohio simply by sniffing a piece of cloth, surely they don't need to ask where he is if they are in the same town... Anyway, John and his friends are then surrounded by the Mogs and their creatures (again unexplained) facing certain death when suddenly, a jaded biker chick (number 6) steps in to save the day... along with John's dog which is now apparently a chimera. A not so epic laser shootout ensures and the hero and heroine drive off into the sunrise.

In my opinion, they could have cut out the romance thing and replaced it with a more indepth/visual view of the Lorien/Mogadorian history and also focus more on the cat and mouse dynamic between them as they move from city to city and cut out the scenes that lead nowhere.

Disappointing film in my opinion. The dialogue was boring, special effects were too fake looking (light shining out of John's palms???), too many parts of the plot were left unexplained or underdeveloped and the romantic subplot was too long, contrived and did not serve the central plot at all.

4431921,3,B004MKMQJW,"To tell you the truth the movie isn't as good if you haven't read the book. Or so I've been told. If it's a book based movie I usually read the books before the movies but I was already engrossed in so many other novels that I had no time to read it and I really wish I had made time.

I think I get the whole premise of the story. There from a different planet so I guess they can be considered aliens. There was ten of them but theres only seven left now. They kill them in order and number four is next. And each has a diffrent gift but fours is the most powerful. Check I got it. Oh I almost forgot they have guardians to help protect them and they need to be kept in secret. Like most people with superpowers.

The beginning of the movie is awful. It was so bad it looked low budget. It wasn't just in the begining throughout the movie you could clearly see that the budget was low in those places.

You know how number four has the blue flash? Well every time he flashed it, it reminded me of Liz from Hellboy when her fire was blue. She couldn't control it it either. Maybe I think fire is still cooler than a giant blue flashlight getting thrown at you.

The romance. I expected a lot but got hardly any. Honestly I don't understand what he saw in her? She sat alone at lunch and took pictures of people without them knowing and posting them on the web. That seemed creepy to me. Her character should have been more fleshed out. But because we didn't get to know a lot about her.

Next the nerdy friend who gets picked one, thrown around,and having a pranks coming out of his locker. The main character helps him and wow the main character and him somehow become friends how ironic. It's cliche at best.

We meet number six. And I can say is that she really made me engrossed in the movie. Her character screemed badass and then she had that country accent. Her scenes were enjoyable.

The best part of the movie was the action and that doesn't really start steaming up until the last twenty five minutes of the movie. And let me tell you, I'm not big on the whole action movies but I liked the action. I had to pee during the movie but I wouldn't miss it for anything that's how good it was.

Now the ending you can clearly see it's going to be a sequel. I didn't even none the movie was over until the credits starting rolling and I still was confused. Because nothing really happend. The whole ending was very unclean.",1298678400,4,2429,4.1862955032119915
