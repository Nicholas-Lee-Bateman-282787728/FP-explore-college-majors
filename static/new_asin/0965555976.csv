Such is the case with this movie, culled from the ""Rocky Jones, Space Ranger"" television show, the first science fiction television show to be put on film.  While the show is relatively crude by even the standards of the next decade, the special effects were quite good for 1954-1955.  The theremin, a musical instrument that provided many of the eerie musical sound effects for early science fiction movies, was liberally used in the show.  The costumes are very dated, including the incredibly short hemline of the beautiful Vena Ray (Sally Mansfield).

In this movie, someone is firing missiles at earth.  The source of the missiles is soon identified as Fornax, a moon of Saturn.  Rocky Jones journeys to Fornax, where he hopes to discover the source of the missiles.  Of course, the second part of his mission is to stop the missiles from being fired.  Once on Fornax, Rocky learns that a criminal has convinced the ruler of Fornax that everyone in the universe is mean and evil, which in the 1950s meant that the criminal was exactly what he, or she, claimed everyone else was.  Fortunately, Rocky, Bobby, and Vena Ray's short hemline convince the ruler that earth people are kinda sorta okay, in an unsophisticated hick sort of way.

This particular episode has a space battle that, other than the impossible maneuvering of the space ships, was good for this era of science fiction.  There are the usual special effects that try hard to look plausible.  I love the theremin music.

This movie has its cheesy moments.  Rocky's sidekick Winky (Scotty Beckett) is unnecessary comic relief.  I assume Bobby was thrown into the mix to appeal to children, who were probably assumed to be a bigger audience than adults in this time frame.  It seems incredible to me, nearly sixty years after the original airing of this show, that Bobby would ever have been allowed to travel into space, but the show was trying to portray that space travel was as routine and safe as flying on an airplane.  One surprise is Vena Ray, who is quite aggressive and typically takes a lead role.  Vena more than holds her own with the rowdy male characters, both physically and intellectually.

I compare this show to ""Star Trek,"" which was another 12 years away.  While ""Star Trek"" was significantly more sophisticated than ""Rocky Jones,"" so were we.  However, both shows were expensive to film, and both are cult classics, though ""Star Trek"" has a much bigger following.  Unfortunately, the cost of ""Rocky Jones"" caused the show to be cancelled after just one season.

Note that Hollingsworth Morse directed the Rocky Jones television show.  Morse directed a host of classic television series during his 30+-year career as a director, from the classic ""Lone Ranger"" to ""The Fall Guy"" and ""Whiz Kids,"" with dozens of other readily recognizable titles in between.  Many of these shows are now considered classic.

If you can roll back your mental clock to the technology of the early 1950s, you can see how this show was relatively cutting edge for the time, with its primitive oscilloscopes, large clunky electronics and devices that have only become practical in the last ten years.  If you are a fan of classic science fiction movies and television, this movie is quite a treat.",1339977600,,3336,4.8462897526501765

7901178,4,0965555976,"I'm really enjoying this set, some great cheesy scifi from the 60s, 70s and 80s, that other value sets don't have, the transfers are much better than mill creek sets, and there is no annoying logos in the corner during the movies. So far I've watched Journy to the Center of Time, Idaho Transfer, Killers from Space, Creature,In The Year 2889,They Came From Beyond Space, Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet, and Abraxas, and they were all great, well if you like cheesy B grade scifi, and I do "") If you like this set I also highly recomend the Sci-Fi Collection V.1 10-DVD Set a few duplicate movies from this set, but, I have a dozen of these value collections and that one is the best IMO all the transfers are from the original masters in that set which is rare, but the transfers are quite good in this set too.",1263686400,2,814,4.397350993377484
7901179,4,0965555976,"I should have probably rated this 5 stars based on value: I mean 20 movies for the price of one?!? Of course as with all the BCI Eclipse multi-disc sets, the quality of the movies varies greatly, and none of these movies are big-budget.  But if that doesn't deter you, read my summary of all 20 from worst to best:

(20) Waiting for the Giants. Sappy, shot-on-video, fairly good idea with a heavy-handed, lame ending.

(19) The Eyes Behind the Stars. Dull Italian attempt to capitalize on the early 80's UFO craze.  Abductions, government conspiracies, and they pronounce it ""yoofo.""

(18) Journey to the Center of Time. Boring 60's time-travel, all shot on one soundstage apparently.  Inept use of stock footage.

(17) Neophytes & Neon Lights. Late 90's (?) Australian effort.  Talky but decent dialogue and performances.  I didn't get the ending.

(14-16) Cosmos: War of the Planets/War of the Robots/Star Odyssey. 1978 Italian Star Wars ripoffs all directed by Al Bradly (Alfonso Brescia). All 3 use the same costumes, sets, props and some of the same actors.  A ""crap trilogy"" if you will, some campy Ed Wood-style fun if you can stand it.

(13) Alien Species.  Shot-on-video; humans battle alien invaders.  Fast-paced cheesy fun; ends abruptly promising ""Alien Species II.""

(12)  Killers from Space.  1954 B&W starring Peter ""Mission Impossible"" Graves.  MS3K-style fun with ping pong ball-eyed aliens.

(11)  Idaho Transfer.  70's acid trip weirdness directed by Peter Fonda.  Gets dull at times but the ending will blow you away.

(10)  Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet.  Color print looks like B&W with some reddish tinting.  Scientists explore said planet and bring a robot.  Fun rubbery monsters here.

(9)  The Day Time Ended.  From 1980: family moves into solar-powered desert house, no explanation for the strange occurrences that take place.  Fans of stop-motion effects will love it.

(8)  Laser Mission.  Not sci-fi, but action-packed Brandon Lee vehicle co-starring Ernest Borgnine.  ""The Crow"" it ain't.

(7)  Slipstream.  The Earth has been wiped clean by powerful winds, forcing people to shelter themselves in small villages and camps.  Runs out of steam by the end, but Bill Paxton is always reliable in the redneck-style role, and Mark Hamill hams it up as a bounty hunter.

(6)  In the Year 2889.  After several nuclear wars, 2889 looks remarkably like the mid-1960's, heh heh.  Motley assortment of characters (scientist/virginal daughter, hillbilly, stripper, etc.) hides out from radiation and mutants.

(5)  They Came from Beyond Space.  60's British effort, well-paced with a good story.  Crashed meteorites control the minds of those who investigate them, bwahahahahaha.

(4)  Abraxas: Guardian of the Universe.  Jesse Ventura plays an intergalactic cop who comes to Earth pursuing a bad guy who sounds like Ah-nold.  Hilariously non-acted, with a brief yet funny scene  featuring Jim Belushi.

(3) Creature.  Alien rip-off with some excellent gore effects.  Klaus Kinski has a supporting role.

(2)  Warriors of the Wasteland.  Fans of 80's Italian horror will recognize familiar faces in this Road Warrior ripoff.  Co-starring blaxploitation icon Fred Williamson who shoots exploding arrows.  Lots of action and crazy weapons.

(1)  Little Shop of Horrors.  Not sci-fi, but classic B&W black comedy directed by Roger Corman, supposedly in three days.  Not the best print available, but great dialogue with tons of double meanings.  If you've only seen the musical remake, do yourself a favor and check it out.",1094083200,19,3542,5.19964349376114
