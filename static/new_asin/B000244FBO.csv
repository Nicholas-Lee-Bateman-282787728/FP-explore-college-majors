2061436,5,B000244FBO,"Wing. Co. Pickard ""Pick"", who stars in this film, ""Target for Tonight"" was my father's C.O. in 1942-2 at Dishforth in Yorkshire.  He was a star, an ace, and everyone idolised him.  I had the great fortune to be invited with my parents to Pick and his wife's house on the station once, for tea to meet Lord Londonerry - I forget what Lord L's RAF rank was, but Pick must have thought a lot of him because it was with him he left a letter about how he wished his son Nicholas to be brought up in the event of his not coming back from 'ops' one day.

I would love to know whether Nicholas is alive and well today.  He was a baby when I was 12, so should be his late sixties.

Pick was totally unassuming, relaxed, a natural leader, very laid back and utterly charming.  See the body language in the film as he slouches into the briefing and debriefing, hands in pockets of his flying jacket.  I was 12 or 13 and had an enormous crush, obviously.  But all the qualities that made him what he was in wartime might have made him quite a daunting father after the war, had he survived and not been killed after he had bombed Amiens prison to allow French Resistance people to escape.  It was said afterwards that he was not really used to low level bombing such as that and may not have been a wise choice.  But I believe the squadron achieved what they set out to do, albeit with inevitable loss of life in the prison as well as to themselves.

I found the film gripping.  I had seen it about twenty years ago with my son and this time with my son and his partner.  We were all sitting on the edge of our seats, although we knew this was not a real-life raid.  However, ""F"" for Freddie was indeed the name of Pick's aircraft and the name used in the film and it came across as very real.

Strongly recommended.

By the time Pick was killed my father, who had been an Intelligence Officer in the ops room for so many of those bombing raids on Germany, was in the Tunisian desert, but he was terribly upset when he heard.  I found the film moving, too, because while my father, George Lindley ""Lyn"" Sparkes, was not actually in it I could see the kind of thing he would have done so many times with Pick and all the other boys in the squadron.  I hate the way those brave men's memories have been tarnished by uninformed 'bashing' of the job they had to do.  I'm afraid they had no alternative.  It was either 'us' or 'them' in those dangerous days.
A lot of rubbish has been written.

2061437,5,B000244FBO,"this is a pretty nifty collection of films.  frankly i enjoy watching this stuff better than watching the history channel since these were made during the war to show the public what was going on, and keep morale up.  you cannot exactly expect them to show war in all of its dirty and dark aspects, but you still get a strong flavor of what it was like for these men.  i highly recommend this and the companion film, target for today, and also there are many similar films that are much more famous like memphis belle and combat america.",1181779200,,537,4.404040404040404
2061438,5,B000244FBO,"This is one of the all time great WWII combat films in the air, Target for Tonight.  It is thrilling to see it again, as I had not seen it for over forty years.  This is a classic, following the crew of the bomber ""F for Freddie"" as they fight for survival over Germany.  The bonus film, which is called ""Target Germany"" is one I had never seen before, and which was also gripping.",1181088000,,381,4.121621621621622
2061439,1,B000244FBO,"Well, i bought this DVD  as i wanted to see those historical propaganda, particularly ""Target for Tonight"" with ""Pick"" PICKARD who was later killed flying a Mosquito during the AMIENS Jail Raid. These films were isued in the 80's on VHS in Europe in the ""After the Battle"" serie. Now my VHS are more than 20 years old and i hoped to get an as good image as can be expected with a DVD. What a disillusion. These poeple from PERISCOPEFILM have allowed themselves to put a (as they say) Digitl Signal at the right low corner of the screen. It means that you've got a grey circle with a periscope during the whole show. How dare they deteriorating theses films this way? By the way, the film restoration is not as good as it could be done techically. Particularly, the beginning of ""TARGET FOR TONIGHT"", with cut frames and missing parts of the music. Where the hell did they find this horrible copy of the film. By comparison, the VHS version of ""After the Battle"" was more viewable!!

Should i have known all of this, i would have kept my money and tried to have a look and my old VHS",1178928000,4,1082,4.351485148514851
2061440,4,B000244FBO,"As others have noted, this is not the famous World War II documentary. It does have some valuable footage and has some interesting sidelines on such things as Mosquito bomber raids. It is worthwhile, but still not the needed documentary that RAF Bomber Command deserves.",1124668800,6,270,5.022222222222222
2061441,1,B000244FBO,"This is a jumble of war-time newsreels, not Pick Pickard in F for Freddie.  The title of the DVD when it plays is The Target for Tonight.

2061443,5,B000244FBO,"I just purchased the DVD in this listing.  It is not the RAF 1941 film, ""Target for Tonight""; it is rather a comprehensive documentary about the bombings of three German Cities, with narration, color footage, and was obviously produced for British television.  I kept the disc because it is well produced; however, if you are expecting the RAF featurette about the bombing of oil storage at Freihausen, Germany, you will be disappointed.  I think somebody dropped the ball.  This DVD is titled ""THE Target for Tonight"".  Oddly, there is about 45 seconds of beautifully restored footage of the RAF film, but it is NOT the original, not the film directed by Harry Watt.",1096761600,10,667,4.867256637168142

2061481,5,B000244FBO,"Even 70 years after it was made, ""Target for Tonight"" is a compelling film.  Portraying a Royal Air Force bombing operation early in World War II, RAF aircrew and ground personnel play themselves, giving this film a realistic flavor different from Hollywood and British films made during or after the war.

The film illustrates the entire process of mission planning and execution, highlighting the many efforts that came together for an operation.  Aviation and military historians, then, can appreciate the movie as much as film buffs.  There's some very good B&W photography.  Those who shoot videos will appreciate the use of light, evocative aerial and airfield scenes, aircraft at night above the clouds, and fog.  Americans will enjoy the various accents of Great Britain and the low-key British humor.

Film historians call this a semi-documentary.  There were no actors, but scenes were staged for the film.  Its ""propaganda"" or ""morale"" dimensions were low key, with the plot enhanced by music in only a few scenes.  On the other hand, this one successful mission is carried out with no loss of life, masking the human cost of the war.  And in 1940 and 1941, RAF bombers, flying at night, seldom hit their targets.

At the 1942 Academy Awards ceremony, two documentaries received special awards (but no statuettes).  ""Target for Tonight"" was one, and ""Kukan: The Battle Cry of China"" the other.  The Academy was already playing its part in the war.

2061482,1,B000244FBO,"TARGET FOR TONIGHT is the title of an ambitious and unusual WWII documentary film about one RAF bomber squadron and featuring one aircraft and crew, ""F for Freddie.""  It's a great film, one I saw in film school long ago and wanted to see again.  Despite the identical title, this is not the classic film.

The producers of this 2004 compilation program used the title of the earlier film and they must have done so knowing that this decision would create confusion.  Other reviewers have commented on the title issue.  I will add that, despite the title and the illustration on the disk jacket, the production company appears to have recycled WWII archival footage, much of it unrelated to the bomber campaign, and then tried to tie it together with the narration.  With a different tile this would perhaps have been a worthwhile production, despite the many similar productions on the same topic.",1338854400,,897,4.830065359477124
2061483,2,B000244FBO,"The disk includes two classic WWII air combat documentaries, TARGET FOR TONIGHT and TARGET GERMANY.  As presented here, both are apparently the result of very inferior video transfers from 16mm prints.  Although these are supposed to be ""...digitally enhanced & restored,"" both show extensive print flaws (dirty and scratched negative marks, dirt on the print, splices and missing frames, low contrast, and other flaws that don't seem to have been either enhanced or restored.  And that is a shame because these were both shot partly or entirely on 35mm and were probably released on 35mm -- you would think a good print should have survived.

I give this two stars because of the content only.  The promotion is somewhat misleading about the print quality but if you want to see TARGET FOR TONIGHT, this seems to be your only option.",1338336000,5,834,4.928571428571429

8021778,3,B000244FBO,It is an informational/propaganda film that accomplishes its mission.  Somewhat informative.  No reason to ignore it.,1475798400,,117,6.25
8021779,5,B000244FBO,"Although radically dated, Target for Tonight is an interesting look at World War II. Created by the British government for public consumption, the 1941 movie is an example of the type of patriotic propaganda that countries involved in the horrific conflict created to keep morale up at home at a time when the privations of the U-boat war were still being felt and when the average person still didn't know if a Nazi horde or two wasn't coming down the High Street.

Created by Britain's War Office, Target for Tonight used real fliers, officers, gunners, clerks and leaders of the Royal Air Force as they showed how a supposed raid on Germany was planned and carried out. The entire cast was made up amateurs who did a pretty good job of showing the realism of the every day jobs of RAF fliers. Like as not, the realism was generated by the fact that the actors were real-life participants in the shooting war that was hot and heavy around them.

Yes, you had to know that all of the air crews would be be coming home in the film and that the wounds that were received wouldn't be fatal because of the nature of the film. That aside, Target for Tonight is an interesting snapshot of a key era in the history of the last century. And though it is outright propaganda, it shows how a nation could stand against tyranny and win.",1473724800,,1326,4.475206611570248
