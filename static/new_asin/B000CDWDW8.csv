8098008,5,B000CDWDW8,"I am on my second VHS video-tape of this performance of ""Amahl and the Night Visitors.""  I am a music teacher and purchased my first identical video of ""Amahl"" years ago to show to my classes every Christmas season.  I used it so much it became worn and started to be difficult to understand. I intended to replace it with a DVD of possibly the same performance, or maybe one performed more recently.  I found it is very difficult to purchase professionally filmed performance of ""Amahl.""  The only DVD I found was in black and white and didn't look as appropriate for today's kids as this one. The only way I could purchase this performance was to buy another video-tape, and so that is what I did.  I like the ""Holy Land"" setting in the authentic-looking hut better than a film of an on-stage performance. I like Teresa Stratas, as well as the other performers. Amahl was portrayed by a young man who did an outstanding job! My new tape is understandable, and as long as you have access to a VCR, I highly recommend this version.",1436313600,,1031,4.491978609625669
8098009,3,B000CDWDW8,This was a better production that the Menotti one but enjoyed that one better than this one.,1421712000,,92,4.470588235294118
8098010,5,B000CDWDW8,"""Amahl and the Night Visitors"" is a charming story of the three kings and a crippled shepherd boy.  Our son played the part of Amahl when a boy so we know the script by memory and enjoy seeing it every Christmas season.",1231977600,2,219,4.214285714285714
