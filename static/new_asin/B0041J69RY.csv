4242853,5,B0041J69RY,The King James Bible is the right Bible for the English speaking people because it is from the correct Greek and Hebrew manuscripts.  All others are from a corrupted North African/Rome Greek.,1361318400,,191,4.96875
4242854,1,B0041J69RY,This item was one of the poorest and sloppiest done histories on the King James Bible and had too much speculation and inaccuracies!!!!!!!!  Would not recommend or buy again!!!!!!,1353628800,8,179,5.172413793103448
4242855,5,B0041J69RY,"I viewed this DVD as supplemental information for a research paper. I enjoyed the content, and the extra interviews. (A ""must see""). The title for this review shares my overall opinion of the DVD.",1343174400,,196,4.794117647058823
4242856,4,B0041J69RY,The movie is historically accurate with opinions held to a minimum. I would reccommend it for those without an extensive knowledge of the background of the making of the KJV.,1319241600,4,174,4.833333333333333
4242857,5,B0041J69RY,"I received this DVD in good shipping condition.
I purchased this DVD for a class studying the bible and found the content & information put forth in video format to be great.
Having done other research on the KJV bible (and others) I find this DVD worthwhile as a purchase for use with a teaching class, that can be used year after year each year with new class students of mainly adult age.
If using for class teaching of 1st year college age or lesser such as High School I might have a few references of other names & dates corresponding to English History of this time period ahead of time.
Over all a good DVD to have in a teaching biblical collection.

4242858,5,B0041J69RY,"Beautifully narrated, well-acted, well-written, unexpectedly engrossing. What a story!  Placed well in its historical context, also filmed in many of the actual locations. Dramatizations have to take a few liberties with aspects of the story that are unknown to history (such as dialogue), but this seems to take few. Made with obvious love for the KJV and a total conviction of Christianity, but without the sentimentality so often found in church film productions. The film refuses to gloss over character flaws of people involved, but doesn't emphasize these flaws, and honors the achievements. Tastefully yet honestly portrayed. Uplifting.",1310169600,13,643,5.561224489795919
4242859,2,B0041J69RY,"This was from the standpoint that all translations are okay, and they are not.  Some would consider this unbiased, but I would not.",1305158400,16,131,4.695652173913044
4242860,1,B0041J69RY,"In short, I was excited about this short (40 minute) film, yet severely disappointed. Beside the laughable acting (a mute point), the biggest issue I have is that it subtly undermines the authority of the Authorized King James Bible. With some historical data the producers have thrown in much speculation and opinion. Just as Satan subtly planted doubt in Gods word in the Garden of Eden, today he is still asking ""Yea, hath God said...?"" (Genesis 3:1). Satan is the Father of lies (John 8:44) and his work is cunning an subtil. instead of ""For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man:but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost."" (2 Peter:21), this film says that the words were picked based upon how they sound and not because God was preserving his word.

I do not question the motives of the producers, but the finished work is wanting and even misleading. Please PRAY before you purchase this film (or any film/literature) which ultimately leads men to believe that we do not have Gods infallible inerrant perfect preserved and inspired word.",1303689600,35,1080,4.684210526315789
4242861,5,B0041J69RY,"ACCURATE AND MOVING

The Making of the King James Bible film is both highly accurate to its history as well as a moving experience to view.  This film draws the viewer into appreciation of both the scholarly accuracy of the King James Bible as well as the richness of language that made the King James Bible such a four-hundred-year hallmark of Bible translations.

I had the opportunity to view The Making of the King James Bible at its world premier in the Dunham Bible Museum, Houston Baptist University.  The movie begins with images of a 1611 First Edition King James Bible from their archives.  Other images of earlier Bible translations as well as a demonstration of the Museum's Gutenberg press weave into scenes as the story of our English Bible unfolds.

Views of England's magnificent cathedrals, universities, palaces and halls, country-side and people draw you to the seventeenth century where Royal politics and conflicts of religious views of faith and church set the stage for the translation of the King James Bible.  Live drama, pictures, narration, scholarly interviews, and costumed actors reading Bible passages in the settings of churches and cathedrals all combine to lead the viewer to participate in the drama of the birth of the King James Bible.

In the magnificent setting of Hampton Court Palace, King James I of England called a conference of England's religious factions to address disputes.  The one great event to come from the conference was Dr. John Reynolds call for a new translation ""more answerable to the truth of the Original.""  King James responded very positively and ordered a translation be made of the whole Bible, as consonant as can be to the original Hebrew and Greek; . . .  set out and printed, without any marginal notes, and only to be used in all churches of England in time of divine service"".
In all the spectacular settings of Oxford, Cambridge, and London, this seven year process comes alive on film as the 49 scholars immediately begin work in scholarship, dialogue, and fraternal compromise to produce the King James Bible.  Accuracy of translation, richness of language that expresses God's greatness, ambiguity in words sometimes that express different theological nuances, all combined to produce an English Bible masterpiece.  In all the spectrum of differences, God was in action in the Bible's production.

Intended for England's churches, the King James Bible took over in the hearts of millions of believers around the world to the present and years to come.  Viewers of The Making of the King James Bible will appreciate their Bibles more after seeing this film and will want their own personal copy for further reference.",1285113600,31,2692,5.031531531531532

4242866,5,B0041J69RY,"I have learned many things from this film. I have learned that colonists came to the New World with the Geneva Bible - a bible that substitutes ""tyrant"" for king in its English translation. Who can evaluate the import on a religious community that such nuanced text can provoke? How much of world history, politics, and attitude was affected?
To learn that each verse was reviewed by biblical scholars familiar with Latin, Greek, and Hebrew 15 times before publication attests to the effort and professionalism of the project.

If is important to know the heritage of our over 400 year old KJV bible. when so many times these days, it is questioned by others as being the true word of God. As God has said, He watches over His word, and the KJV bible is proof of that promise. Nothing can compare to it! This was a great documentary type movie with some acting as well. Very well done!

8412846,3,B0041J69RY,"I suppose it was alright, but certainly not great.  Things like obvious typos in the titles bug me, but what really gets me is that William Tyndale was entirely left out.  Everyone knows that 80% of the KJV is Tyndale's work.  Why not mention that?  It seems, by not mentioning it, that they are HIDING it--but why hide it?  A much better choice would be to read a book on the life of Tyndale.  David Danielle's book (which also contains a completely unprofessional amount of typos), nevertheless does a masterful job of looking not only at the life of Tyndale, but of analyzing and appreciating the actual translation work, with a focus on the beauty of his translation, truly changing the English language itself even inasmuch as Shakespeare did.  I'm just shaking my head at this enormous oversight and wondering what could possibly be the motivation-- manipulation or ignorance?",1519084800,,882,4.879194630872483

8412848,5,B0041J69RY,This DVD explains the effort and energy it took to put this version of the KJV together.  A few comparisons between the different versions available at the time and the languages used in them.  Very interesting.,1493510400,,211,4.833333333333333
8412849,1,B0041J69RY,"After having watched, 'KJB: The Book That Changed the World', which I thought was excellent, I decided to watch 'KJV The Making of the King James Bible'. It wasn't long before I started to discern the subtle bias against the KJV depicted in the movie. I noticed that the first thing said about King James was that he was a sickly man and the cartoonish characterization of him every time he was being talked about showed him in a PINK outfit and very effeminate looking, which perpetuates the long since debunked MYTH that he was a homosexual (the KJV actually uses the term ""sodomite"" which is now considered ""hate speech"", but I digress.

The usual ploys are used very subtly in the film when referring to manuscripts that were 'available at the time', and stating that the translators were influenced by their own bias of being Puritans or Anglicans. There was actually a point where it was directly stated that, (I paraphrase) although there are more accurate translations available today, the KJV remains the most beautiful and rhythmic. Yes, the KJV is the most beautifully written, however, it is NOT true that other translations are more accurate. I have extensively studied the issue of which texts were used: i.e. Textus Receptus (the Received or majority text) vs. the Textus Sinaiticus and Vaticanus (Alexandrian Texts).  The KJV (Authorized Version) is the ONLY translation that uses the Majority text and all other translations of which there are some 400 use corrupted texts that Wescott and Hort in 1881 used to 'revise' the Bible in the Revised Version. (Sinaiticus and Vaticanus disagree with EACH OTHER in 3,000 places in the gospels alone). This information is readily available on the internet for anyone who cares to do even a cursory search for themselves.

Also, it is stated several times in this movie that the KJV is more difficult to understand, which is actually a myth because the translators actually define certain more difficult words right in the verse and thus, the KJV has its own built in dictionary.

A person who is unlearned or who has little discernment who watches this film will come away with doubt as to the accuracy of the KJB and will believe the myth that it is hard to understand, that there have, since 1611 been more accurate translations, and that King James was a homosexual.

2 Corinthians 2:11 (KJV)
Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.

Genesis 3:1 (KJV)
Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?

I recommend people watch, 'KJB: The Book That Changed the World' which explains much more about the actual committees that were set up with the original 54 men, and who these renowned scholars actually were. It is also much better dramatized. So much for the 'Award winning' director of 'The Making of the King James Bible'. He obviously hates the true word of God and is leading many people down the 'broad' way.",1492905600,9,3053,4.738229755178907

8412852,5,B0041J69RY,"Well focused on the topic. A new edition of the bible was commissioned to consolidate and unify scripture in a version  that would serve the Church of England.  Building on the the ""good translation"" largely by Wycliffe in beautifully turned  Elizabethan verse, a committee of six scholars sought to create an edition that remained politically neutral, to streamline some of the verbiage for clarity, and  to imbue the text with poetic power for liturgical readings.",1490400000,,466,5.173333333333333
8412853,5,B0041J69RY,"This is a not a flashy production, nor did it need to be. It's keenly informative plus it takes us back to time of extreme divisions among those Christians who'd already split from the church of Rome. Most remarkable is the transformation of a truly ancient text into prose that possesses lyrical majesty and such sheer power. When you hear almost word for word translations to English you're likely to wince. It's then you appreciate the work of the translators. Add to that the urgent political dimensions and the work becomes even more extraordinary.

Plus it shows the human touch which means human error, such as the version that says you shall commit adultery. Oops. And it reveals political issues that resonate to this day, such in the English bible used by the democratic country of Switzerland - the Geneva Bible - which replaces the 400 instances of the word, King, with the word, tyrant. This was the Bible used by our Pilgrims because they didn't just distrust monarchy, they distrusted government. Sounds familiar I expect.

One flaw, however. In the end the King James Bible is the work of perhaps the finest prose writer in the history of the English language: William Tyndale who was burned at the stake in King Henry VIII's time simply for producing an English translation. Scholars still debate how much of the King James Bible is Tyndale but it's at least 80% his work. This isn't to say the translators were plagiarizing Tyndale. Rather Tyndale's prose was so powerful that every subsequent translator had to yield to its influence.

Finally, this program is worthwhile no matter your religious views. I'm not a Christian but the biggest mistake anyone can make, if you care about Western Civilization, is to fail to read this foundational work. I didn't have children and not a one of my nieces or nephews has ever stepped inside a church. Yet all of us have read the Bible and not a one has ever questioned the value of doing so.",1490313600,3,1952,4.752212389380531
