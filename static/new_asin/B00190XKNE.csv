8271485,5,B00190XKNE,"If you grew up a Mets fan and went to Shea Stadium to watch the NY Mets lose & sometimes even win - especially in 1969 and 1986 - then you have got to watch this - you will absolutely love it!  It talks about the Mets from the beginning, including the years the Jets and the NY Yankees played at Shea Stadium.  It'll leave you in great spirits - reminiscing with some of the announcers and players on all the amazing games and highlights that took place at Shea in a truly heartfelt goodbye.",1475712000,,491,4.157894736842105

8271487,5,B00190XKNE,If you spent alot of time at Shea this will bring back some great memories.  It covers lots of Mets highlights that took place at our beloved Shea.  I would have preferred if it went chronologically (it jumped around a lot)  but I loved it anyway.  It really took me back especially for 1986.  Just super to relive so many great times.  Let's Go Mets!,1372550400,,351,4.323076923076923
8271488,3,B00190XKNE,"For die-hard Mets fans, Shea Goodbye does a reasonably good job of encapsulating the feast, famine and frustration of The New York Metropolitans. Yes, the chapter sequence left me scratching my head however, everything and everyone that have made their tenure in Flushing so mercurial and memorable - Casey, Marvelous Marv, Eddie Kranepool, Todd Pratt, the '69 `Miracle' and the '86 Juggernaut - are all here represented with better than average production quality.

With a running time just north of 75 minutes, Shea Goodbye is a quick and nostalgic jolt of Red Bull for anyone who wants just the highlights close at hand.

Less sentimental for me is the departure of Shea Stadium itself. Shea has been an obsolete, second-world facility since it's opening in 1964. While I know that any stadium is more than the sum of its design and does eventually house decades of emotions and memory - Shea Stadium pushes that thought to its unnatural limits. With Gulag-inspired amenities and the intimacy of a Boeing assembly hanger, Shea has endured as the architectural middle finger to overall fan friendliness - proving with every visit that concrete is no substitute for charm. Good riddance.

In 2009 we'll christen a brand new world-class facility - Ch Stadium - or whatever they wind up calling it once the Cuban Treasury buys CitiGroup for ten cents on the dollar. Viva Mets!",1222387200,,1375,4.969565217391304
8271489,4,B00190XKNE,"If you're a Mets fan you will appreciate this chronicle of Shea's history. I will cherish this DVD forever and any other on Shea as it is Shea's last year. This is a nice addition to your Mets collection. Another Mets must see is Mathematically Alive which is all about NY Mets fans. Hysterically funny and nice to see piece of yourself in the fans in the film. check it out at [...] or on amazon at

8271490,5,B00190XKNE,"Shea Goodbye chronicles the 45-years of Shea Stadium home of the New York Mets and at one time the New York Jets as well. Shea Goodbye is a must have for Mets fans, while the DVD isn't perfect any flaws are more than made up for with the content. It starts off with a brief overview on how the Mets came to be than the focus is mostly about the games played at Shea and there are also some brief mentions of the New York Jets as well.

The only flaw with the DVD is how it jumps around a little too much. It goes from the 60-00's, but than goes back and forth. For instance there's a great section on the 86 Mets, but after it ends they go back to the 69 Mets. It would have been better off simply going through the years rather than jumping around through eras.

Running at 76-Minutes and with all the great moments at Shea some things are bound to be left out, but overall it gets the job done with the great moments. Though the 1988 NLCS is left out and not even brought up. The focus was mainly, 69, 73 and 86, 99 and a slight mention of 2000; a few mentions of the current Mets team from 05-08. There are some mentions of 2006 and we see the catch by Endy Chavez in Game 7 to save the game from what was a HR, maybe the greatest catch in Mets history, too bad the NLCS ended the way it did. The 1986 NLCS is left out with the exception of the Lenny Dykstra HR to win game 3 to give the Mets a 2-1 lead in the series.

The 90s are mostly left out (except 99) with good reason since most Met fans would like to forget 91-96, which were some very dark times for the ball club; but again most of the greatest moments are brought up and some good focus put on some of the players. The one letdown was the lack of players like Howard Johnson, while HoJo does appear on the DVD he was a very popular player and I would have loved to have seen some highlights from some of his games at Shea. Also totally left out are fan favorites such as David Cone and Sid Fernandez.

The highlight for me was the section on the 86 Mets; I was 7-years old when they won the World Series and at that age Baseball was probably the most important thing in the world to me. The focus is mostly put on the big 4 Keith Hernandez, Gary Carter, Doc Gooden and Darryl Strawberry, all of which appear with the exception of Doc Gooden. The greatest moments in the franchise was game 6 of the 86 WS the Mets are down to their last out down by 2 runs and it seemed like it was over until Gary Carter started the rally off with a hit and possibly the greatest moment in Mets history was the ground ball by Mookie Wilson that went through the legs of Bill Buckner, which scored the winning run and many will agree that moment the life was taken out of the Red Sox and game 7 was 100% a win for the Mets.

While the Mookie Wilson grounder might be the greatest moment in the Mets history the one moment that can top that is September 21st 2001. 10 days after 9/11 the Mets played the Atlanta Braves and with the Mets down in the bottom of the 8th Mike Piazza (my fave player of all time) hit a 2-run HR, which would end up being the game winner. After such a horrible tragedy for a very brief moment everything was ok thanks to Piazza and it was very fitting that of all the Met players it was Mike Piazza who hit the HR who in my opinion is the greatest player to ever play for the Mets. Being a New Yorker this part really gets to me and I have to admit this gets me a little teary eyed.

The DVD rounds off with the current Mets and the rebuilding after the disaster of the 02-04 seasons. Most of the focus is on David Wright and Jose Reyes with brief mentions of some other players, but it's all about Wright and Reyes. This section is fun and I just love watching David Wright play so I really enjoyed this one. David Wright is currently my favorite player so again I enjoyed this.

Overall Shea Goodbye is a great DVD for Met fans, while it doesn't go into great detail about the players and franchise you'll learn enough and for those too young to remember certain eras of the team this will be a fun DVD and for those that just wanna relive these moments again this DVD is great. This one is highly recommended for fans.

The bonus features are very good as well, we have the last out of the 69 WS and Iconic last out of the 86 WS as well as the 06 Division Clinch final out and the Game 5 1999 Grand Slam Single by Robin Ventura to win the game. After Ventura hit the Grand Slam as he was rounding 1st base he was mobbed by his teammates and never rounded all the bases so it goes down as a single. There are some other features, but I think most will cite those as the best ones.

Being a Mets fan isn't always easy it seems they have all the makings of something special and it always seems to go wrong anyone remember the 93 Mets? Yeah I'd like to forget them as well, but this DVD shows while we may have had some downtimes, but it also reminds us of how many amazing moments this team has given us fans over the years.

The 2008 season is the last year at Shea as they move to their new Stadium Citi Field in 2009. Might have made more sense for this to come out after the 08 season, but oh well still a great DVD.

8271491,3,B00190XKNE,"This video had no logical flow at all...it wasn't chronological or grouped in any way.  It really detracted from DVD, but the bottom line is that it was a relatively affordable way to commemorate Shea for the die-hard Mets fan.",1218672000,,227,4.675
8271492,5,B00190XKNE,"A wonderful DVD that that shows just how Special Shea Stadium Has been.

8271493,5,B00190XKNE,"Saw this at Best Buy for $44.99 and Shea Goodbye for $19.99. I live near Flushing and have seen the construction of The Overblown Travesty of Citi Field everyday going to and from work and this looked interesting.
This says it has 6 complete games and totals more than 16 hours and Shea Goodbye has just the highlights and totals only 76 minutes. Not really into baseball too much but living in NY less than 5 miles from Shea Stadium thought I might pickup and watch once Shea was destroyed and that $600+ million retro Ebbets Field with the 20 year $20 million naming rights joke called Citi Field replaced it. unless you're a real diehard Mets fan who wants to watch 6 complete games like they show Yankees games on MSG or YES network here in NY, I'd stick to the 76 minutes Shea Goodbye.",1213228800,3,790,4.417808219178082
