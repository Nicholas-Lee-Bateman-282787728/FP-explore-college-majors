8666064,5,B00LI6XO6C,"Lots of rare genre film trailers mixed in with some better-known ones. This is the U.S. release of the popular British DVD collection, so if this one proves popular enough, we may get more volumes that are in the British collection. I certainly hope that happens. This is grand entertainment, as a stand-alone watch or a party DVD that plays in the background. The price is right and people should buy this if they are horror, sexploitation, actions and exploitation fanatics, like myself.",1422057600,3,489,4.903614457831325
8666065,3,B00LI6XO6C,"I hate to do this as I love exploitation/horror trailer compilations, but things are just getting way too repetitive lately, and this DVD is just a bunch of trailers we've already seen a million times on other compilations.  When the first trailer starts off and it's the ""I Drink Your Blood/I Eat Your Skin"" combo trailer (which is a great trailer), all I could think of was that it was way more exciting seeing it on the Mad Ron's Prevues from Hell compilation when it came out in the late 80's.  That's over 25 years ago, and that trailer comp was so much more unique at the time.  Now, with this Grindhouse Trailer Classics DVD all these years later, you're just going to get tons of trailers you've seen over and over again on so many comps that have come since.  How many times can you watch that long ""Blood Spattered Bride/I Dismember Mama trailer?  Or Switchblade Sisters, Caged Heat, Toolbox Murders, Last House on the Left, House of Whipcord, Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things, etc.?  Seen it all before, been there, done that.  All terrific trailers, of course, but if you've been buying these comps for a while, this comp is a serious case of deja vu and you'll be fast forwarding through most of it to find one or two trailers that you may not remember.  But if you're new to this stuff, go for it!",1410825600,16,1319,4.489539748953975
