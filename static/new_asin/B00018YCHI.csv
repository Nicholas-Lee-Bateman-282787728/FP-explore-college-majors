3025800,3,B00018YCHI,Good movie but kept freezing. I don't think it was internet connection problem as other movies on amazon prime worked fine. Kids didn't get chance to finish it up as we got this as 2 day rental. :(,1510012800,,197,4.2105263157894735

3025802,5,B00018YCHI,"This is a great little movie.  What makes it so, is that there is comedy here involving a bit of subterfuge and obsession with being a musician on the part of Jack Black's character, Dewey.  But the comedy doesn't rely on forced gags, bathroom humor or uncomfortable moments (which I generally don't find humorous), it relies on Black's likeable but preposterous character who remains unabashedly focused on doing his thing and accomplishing his goal in the face of whatever arises in his path, by using whatever charm, wit, fraud or heart he can muster to make his dream happen.  Other top humorous moments come from kids being kids of all different kinds and Dewey dealing with them, and in some ways Dewey is more of a kid than any of them, but he has a good heart and passion, and he ends up really caring about the kids.  I have no reservations about my 10 year old watching this, and he and my 13 year old boy loved it.",1509235200,,925,4.455621301775148
