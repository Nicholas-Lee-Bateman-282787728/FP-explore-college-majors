4686829,3,B005G172MM,The box sets used to go on sale for $16-20... now they rarely get under $30... plus they practically halved the number of episodes per boxed set even though we are paying more money per each set.  Disappointed with both amazon and Viz.  Going to spend my money elsewhere.,1319587200,7,271,4.510204081632653
4686830,2,B005G172MM,"My bf and i were really excited when this box set came in the mail, as we always are with the new Naruto Shippuden sets, but this set was disappointing. It was mostly filler, and not even very interesting filler, at that. The newest of Orochimaru's henchmen aren't that interesting, and their jutsu aren't very impressive. Although we will continue to buy these for the collection, we really hope the plot line improves.",1318636800,3,420,4.767123287671233
4686831,5,B005G172MM,"Why isn't their a blu-ray version of this volume, because after epidodes 80 something, the series starts going(Broadcasted)in HD at the time?",1315440000,,141,5.454545454545454
4686832,5,B005G172MM,"While I love the anime Naruto and Naruto Shippuden, I am no longer willing to pay for a mere 10 to 13 episode box sets, as it's just a big money grab. This set is 12 episodes. I have already begun to replace my smaller 12 or so episode sets of Naruto with the Naruto Uncut Box Sets Season 1 -4, all 8 Volumes. I will donate the smaller sets to my local library in the hopes that I will empower the imagination of the next generation of Anime/Manga enthusiasts.",1315267200,8,460,4.122222222222222

4686933,5,B005G172MM,Another fine story arc from this fine series. We need to show it more often on regular television but they took it off the air 2 years ago. Very sad but the DVD's have kept me going!,1391731200,,182,3.945945945945946

4686935,3,B005G172MM,The reason why i gave it a 3 stars is because even though it wasn't damaged the case was banged up. When i opend it the pronges that were in there to keep the cd in place was busted to. But besides that it was ok.,1381795200,,213,3.652173913043478
4686936,5,B005G172MM,Exactly what it was supposed to be.  Naruto shippuden is a very good series.  Very few anime's are good its good I got one of them.,1375747200,,131,4.0
4686937,5,B005G172MM,"Great story. I love when anime progress stories like this. The original naruto series was well written. Each character was interesting. Alot of touching moments. Especially naruto,always trying to inspire an help. This continues in Shippuden. EXcept,the characters aged a few years. Which is what I meant by progression. Im not going to explain what each set is about. Just know this series is addictive. So if you get the chance,buy alot or all sets at once. I got all 15 on sale almost half off. 20ish$$$ a set. Im a little disappointed in the length of time it took to ship from Amazon LLC.5 business days just to be shipped. But arrived shortly after. The sets are kinda a ripoff considering each set is 11-13 episodes. But on sale it was a must buy. For 330$ I got 15 sets instead of paying
660$.I love this show and will keep buying. Set 16 is due to release in october 2013.

4686939,1,B005G172MM,"First off. I love Naruto, and I don't necessarily hate all filler. But c'mon...this runs WAY too long (over three discs...this could have been done in 4 episodes).

Spoiler alerts ahead...but trust me, there's not much to be spoiled.

Orochimaru is using a kid to gain control of the 3-tailed beast. But this kid man...all he does is talk about two things. These red and white flowers (like, ad naseum) and ""going home"" to where someone thinks about you. It's ALL he talks about. for 20 episodes. For one, no one is thinking about this kid because, werp, he's an orphan. Second, think about something else. Why are they feeding you these wacky pills that make you sick? Why are all these ninjas running around?

Second, Naruto's training. Okay, it's cool that we see him learn this new technique with the other frogs. But since it's not part of the main cannon, we are NEVER going to see him use this (fairly lame) technique ever again. OH, are we supposed to believe he's going to call a frog into battle when he's battling Itachi or Pain or Sasuke? No flipping way, man. This training should have lasted 5 minutes...max.

Third, and I may just be missing something here. Why isn't there a jinchuriki for the 3-tailed beast. He's just chilling in a lake. He should have all kinds of people trying to mess him up.

Do yourself a favor. If you want filler, get the movies. At least there's a (short) plot and some production value behind it. Pardon all my misspellings. This review doesn't deserve the time it would take me to Google their names and spell everything correctly.",1359849600,,1576,4.614285714285714
4686940,5,B005G172MM,I thought that this was very amazing. The CDs and the case were in very good shape. I kept watching it because it was so good,1358467200,,125,3.8461538461538463
4686951,4,B005G172MM,"Not bad of an anime, descent price for this set eight. Stays kind of close to the manga series here and there.",1356480000,,110,4.045454545454546
4686952,5,B005G172MM,best show ever action and funny seeing naruto grow as a stronger ninja to save his friends and to become Hokage watching him achive his goals can't wait to see what happen next just wish the english version came out fast on DVD,1347840000,,227,4.3023255813953485
4686953,5,B005G172MM,Bought as a gift for a fan of the show Naruto. They really loved it! So if you are a fan I highly recommend it!,1341446400,,111,3.48
4686954,4,B005G172MM,There is a lot of great action in this set.  And the images of this set is crispy.  Nice subtitles can let those with hearing difficulties understand and those whose English is not mother tongue learn much about how it is spoken.  Great for Naruto fans!,1340755200,,253,4.456521739130435

4686956,5,B005G172MM,I found this set to be awesome as the previous. Here we see a new beast-tail and the story behind one of Orochimarus trust allies. They story is good enough to make you want to watch the episodes one after the other. The quality as very good as it always is. Cant wait for Set9!,1326672000,2,278,4.072727272727272
4686957,5,B005G172MM,This set continues the story of Naruto trying to find a way to control his new power but a mysterious child with a unique ability gets in the way. This set contains 12 episodes and as always its top quality in picture and sound. Naruto fans this is a must buy!,1326672000,3,260,4.117647058823529
4686958,5,B005G172MM,"This was a great story! A lot of my favorite characters...Hinata, Shino,& Kakashi especially. Exciting and a lot of action. It was great to see them in action with team #7 and Naruto. It is Naruto that is a must see. The production quality is superb also. Get it! Forget the rap that it is filler, it is Naruto anime that you will love if you are a Naruto fan!",1324857600,7,360,4.1571428571428575
4686959,2,B005G172MM,"Ok, so i was satisfied with the arc, not the best shippuden but it only gets better from here. My reveiw is more focused on the pkg.

Ok the original naruto box sets were beautiful boxes with a sticker or two, even a short book, nothing great, but something extra for the fans. Then the later releases of the later sets got thinner and cheaper (although i believe the fuller more expensive sets were still out there to find. Then naruto shippuden sets come out, thin packs, which i love, up thru box 4. This is when Viz totally screw its loyal fans and fallowers by switching to a single dvd box w 3 dvds in it, no extras, no inserts, and less episodes... BUT SAME FRIGGEN MONEY!!!! but at least they had a slipcover (i do mean AT LEAST!!!) then box set 8 comes out... I thought i either got a bootleg or a used re shrink wrapped copy. Instead of cellophane, security seal, and slip cover you get the simple dvd box in shrink wrap... 3 dvds inside... Thats it... Not even a viz media post card or episode list...

ABSOLUTE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!! same.. No wait... More money tyen previous, less episodes, NO CONSIDERATION TO THE LOYAL ANIME CONSUMER!

Lastly ill say this to you all... I plan to write a letter to Viz media explaining my sheer disappointment and aggrevation with the lack Of thought thats given to the consumer, its money grubbing and a blaitant F.U. To us loyal
Fans...  I URGE YOU
TO WRITE AS WELL!!! otherwise we can expect more and more disappointment from viz... Theyre doing the same with bleach box sets!",1323302400,8,1524,4.471223021582734
4686960,2,B005G172MM,"Please note this rating has nothing to do with the company who shipped this.  A 5 goes to the company who shipped this out to me, thanks again.

As for the DVD itself as any Naruto it's excellent, but on a major downside extremely slow progressing. I was disappointed this volume was left on a cliff hanger.  As far as Naruto Shippuden goes, at least 3 volumes have to be sold together for a cheaper price.  Naruto going to the hot spring, Naruto eating food with friends, or silly arguments that cut down on the serious parts just waists so much time and makes it very annoying.",1320624000,4,579,4.383177570093458

8470931,4,B005G172MM,"This is the Yukimaru/Guren arc. Its good but like a lot of the other arcs, doesn't compare to the main Akatsuki story line. Its cool to see the masterless 3-tails. Kabuto continues to be a despicable character, giving Yukimaru drugs to activate his power, but damaging him in the process. Guren starts off being despicable, but comes around and eventually you don't dislike her as much. The arc continues into the next set (set 9). I'm determined to own them all. I will never bow to the digital storage of movies or music. I must have something I can own physically and hold in my hand.",1499299200,,587,4.547169811320755
