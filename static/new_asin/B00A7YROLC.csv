5395933,4,B00A7YROLC,"There's good information in the DVD, that covers the rifle, carbine and shotgun. I'm just really happy to see a little bit of everything on the spectrum, especially seeing pistol caliber carbines in the mix.

Entertainment wise the little cut scenes and ""action"" portion are a lot better than some of the stuff out there. It's entertaining and it keeps people watching.

Also one other thing.

STEADY CAM GUN!

(can't wait for volume 3, gun trucks!)",1355011200,,449,4.868421052631579
5395934,5,B00A7YROLC,"Yeah, the zombie theme is corny...who cares!?!?  It's a fun video, inexpensive, and there is good info in it.  I'm a firearms instructor.  When trying to point out to people their bad habits, they look at me like I'm making these things up.  Now, I can show them examples of someone else doing the very same mistakes they are doing.  The only negative I can say is that the ""event"" happened in California.  Chris Costa is using suppressed OBR's, 22's, along with a plethora of high cap magazines.  Also, no AK style guns in the video.  How about the crappy SKS that every redneck seems to own (I'm a Midwestern hillbilly...there's a difference!....Texans are in another description altogether).  He did show several varieties, though.",1354752000,5,734,4.854838709677419
5395935,4,B00A7YROLC,"This was not quite what I expected, but being the firearm enthusiast that I am, I would rather watch this than something on TV that would have been lame otherwise.

So you might as well buy it and check it out.  I do always enjoy Costa....",1372809600,,239,4.173913043478261
5395936,5,B00A7YROLC,Wrapped around the idea of a pandemic outbreak & quarantine and/or the Zombie apocalypse. Good creativity and humor while still getting the points across.,1369872000,,154,5.458333333333333
5395937,5,B00A7YROLC,"The zombie theme is a little cheesy, but there is some great instruction in this video.  It is aimed at those with little or no experience, and I think it does a good job of explaining the fundamentals.  If you're looking for real tactics and training for someone with experience, stick with the Magpul videos.  But if you've never shot a gun, this series is a great starting point.  You get The Beard teaching the basics in his normal style.",1369440000,,442,4.4875
5395938,4,B00A7YROLC,"Shows fundamentals of trigger control and weapon manipulation but not for advanced shooters, better off getting magpul dynamics for really improving skills and combative mindset. Nice part in film for bug out and preparednes. You will always learn something from ""The Beard"" Chris Costa.",1364515200,,287,5.545454545454546
5395939,5,B00A7YROLC,These videos are both informative and entertaining. I recommend for anyone looking for emergency preparation videos this great way to go,1363478400,,136,5.523809523809524
5395940,5,B00A7YROLC,Chris does a great job of covering the basics while adding the zombie twist for a laugh. It was informative and not to long that you would only watch it once.,1362355200,,158,4.129032258064516
5395941,4,B00A7YROLC,"Very basic aiming and firing position techniques, but there few numerous tips I picked up even though I've been shooting for a few years. The extra zombie stories and ""breaks"" were a very nice addition. Great concept and delivery. Sharing with friends.",1358899200,,252,5.023809523809524
5395942,5,B00A7YROLC,I know nothing about guns and have never wanted to own one.  I borrowed this from a friend and was fascinated with the technology involved with guns.  This makes me want to go to the local firing range and practice.  This is an excellent training video for beginners.  The concept kept me interested in something I previously had no interest in.,1356739200,2,345,4.60655737704918
5395943,5,B00A7YROLC,"Volume 2 did a nice job of complimenting what I learned in Volume 1 and there were even more awesome improvised weapons. I've started to really like Chris and he's just so personable but also really talented and effective with a weapon. Tons of great information on this DVD and the producers did it again with this Volume! Very nice, wide selection of weapons and once again, does not talk down to the viewer. I can see it being a nice little collection on my shelf and way cheaper than taking a class with the pros. :)",1355616000,,520,4.371134020618556
5395944,5,B00A7YROLC,"So I like zombies and guns, I own Volume 1, so naturally I needed to get my hands on Volume 2. Came with another map, which was cool and the steadicam gun is sick! How do I get one of those?! This one is a little longer and they get into bigger guns. Felt like a natural progression from Volume 1 and eventually would love to see even some advanced stuff. I think for the price point and how much you can get out of the series, it's a must-have for the zombie lover!",1355356800,,466,3.9680851063829787
8548025,5,B00A7YROLC,"Pretty cool video. Some great lessons inside this video, don't sleep on it.",1488326400,,75,4.846153846153846
8548026,4,B00A7YROLC,If you have very little to no firearms experience or are a massive Chris Costa fanboy then this is for you.  It's a good introductory DVD with a zombie apocalypse setting.,1418169600,,171,4.516129032258065
8548027,5,B00A7YROLC,"The Zombie theme is and entertaining twist, but since i can afford to fly out and get personally trained by Costa, its the next best thing.  I re-watch it every quarter to keep the lessons fresh in my mind, and have made my whole family watch it and practice what Chris teaches.  It has improved my shooting and is a bargain at this price.",1413936000,,339,4.28125
8548028,3,B00A7YROLC,"Video was so so. I enjoyed the breakdown on the guns and the instruction was good for new folks. Ill give him points for trying a different way of presenting the information, but it was really more distracting than anything.",1409529600,,224,4.625
8548029,5,B00A7YROLC,"Costa is a fantastic instructor. The information is basic, but good. Overall, the zombie theme of the DVD is fun.",1399420800,,113,4.7
8548030,4,B00A7YROLC,Not a bad video goes over the various types of long guns you might find or use in a zombie apocalypse.  Love Chris Costa.  You mostly watch inexperienced shooter shoot the various platforms. You do see Chris get on some of the guns.,1390780800,,232,4.372093023255814
8548031,2,B00A7YROLC,"Im a big fan of Chris costa, so i was excited to see an actual training video that uses zombies and makes it fun. This really isn't a training video at all, its an ok video, but I wish I had just found it for rental or somthing, Ill probably never watch either of the volumes again.

At first I really did like the way it was produced, but after awhile it gets really stale, the actors get annoying. Costa is still the beard thou, and its always cool to see him in action. But you can tell he had little to do with any scripting or actual concept.",1380067200,,547,4.018348623853211
8548032,5,B00A7YROLC,"An excellent introduction to weapons, with a zombie film backdrop to make it palatable ! Filmed as well as any feature film.",1376697600,,124,4.681818181818182
8548033,5,B00A7YROLC,"Volume 1 was handguns - Volume 2 is rifles. Interspaced with the newbee firearms training is some excellent information on survival. These are really about surviving and not about Zombies (in fact, if you want to see lots of zombie screen time its not here - only a few minutes of zombies) If you have ever wondered what life would be like if you lived in parts of New Orleans during Katrina or Syria right now as I write this, (of fill in your own blank; WWIII, Major Earthquake, Enemy Invasion, Riot, etc,) then this DVD and the one before it are for you. Chris Costa is an excellent instructor and although I am an experienced rifle shot I still learned things.

The second DVD in the package has Chris explaining what he carries in his survival bags and shows some improvised weapons. Well done and easy to follow. Everything is clearly explained and makes sense. These are good, real life, sensible (not extreme) shooting and urban survival DVDs

I can't wait for Volume 3 - Introduction to Vehicles - the teaser looked GREAT!",1376524800,,1031,4.5978260869565215
8548034,5,B00A7YROLC,"I have to be honest, I am sick of the zombie genre when it comes to tactical training and the shooting sports. I understand it's easier for people to prepare for a 'zombie apocalypse' than civil unrest of the type that followed Hurricane Katrina. But it's taken on a life of its own instead of being a fill in for something real.

All that said if you were to remove the zombie reference from this video what you would get is the best basic introduction to firearms and training I've ever seen on DVD. Chris Costa is a high regarded and respected trainer in the firearms world and it shows. The zombie 'interviews' are a bit silly and campy but Chris does a great job of playing the part. The section on gear selection alone justifies the price point of this video for the new shooters. Chris is an instructor, a teacher, not someone just talking to the camera to get a paycheck. And he does a good job 'teaching' using this DVD. Its not the same a attending a professional level course, but it beats 'learning' on your own, or from a buddy who may be as clueless as any new shooter and just doesn't, or won't, admit it.

Where the video excels is showing a wide variety of firearms, gear and training methods, to a variety of people that combines to make it very accessible. I've spent my entire life shooting and my entire adult life in the military. I was well into my mid 20s before I decided to seek out professional training on my own and my learning truly began. Not everyone has the option, ability, or funds to attend two or three good classes a year. And many new shooters are intimidated initially from seeking out such training. So while not idea, video training is a good way to see what it would be like. My hope is that for everyone that watches this video some will find the time and money to invest in their training by attending an actual class. For those who are new to the shooting world this is a good way of seeing how to do things instead of just going to the range and developing bad habits. As an instructor a good deal of my time is spend retraining over previous bad training my students have developed. This video will do much to show anyone the basics, which doesn't mean simple, but something to help establish a baseline. Just be forewarned about the campy zombie stories.",1374537600,,2303,4.391100702576113
