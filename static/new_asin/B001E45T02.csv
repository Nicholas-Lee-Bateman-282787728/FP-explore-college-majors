3545620,5,B001E45T02,"I was a little bummed the first few times I watched this. I was kicking back during ""Montana"" anticipating the killer guitar solo in that song, but the solo was not there! I know Frank liked to rearrange, change tempo's, and omit parts of songs during live performances, but to leave out the blistering solo during ""Montana"" just bummed me out. However, after several viewings this DVD is killer and a must for Zappa fans.

The concert footage comes from a 1981 show and runs 1 hour 55 minutes. The video and audio (stereo only) are very good. The set list includes lots of songs from ""You Are What You Is"", so if you want Frank's early stuff you may be disappointed. Most of the time, the band is incredible... there are a few vocals out of pitch and some of Vai's leads are really sloppy, but when they play ""Alien Orifice"" my jaw hits the floor.  Is anyone writing cool music like this anymore?

Extras include two bonus tracks - ""Teen-Age Prostitute"" and ""City of Tiny Lights"", the video of ""You Are What You Is"", a photo gallery, a discography, a DVDography, and liner notes from Scott Thunes.

Overall, this is a treat for fans and I hope more releases like this are planned for the future.",1293494400,50,1196,4.472477064220183

3545643,5,B001E45T02,"Frank was way ahead of his and our time, especially when he made this on Halloween 1981 and later on the subsequently tour (I was lucky enough to attend a concert on the european leg of the tour - Kiel, Germany, 1982/5/23 - but he kicked the gig after 75 minutes 'cause some people were throwing repeadly tampoons (these were not used ones by the way) on the stage). Frank had anticipated not only the decadence of the forthcoming 80s by means of music and fashion (the magenta setting of the show, his own kinda 'onesie' clothes. He anticipated the cultural trash even if it appeared decades later in only slightly different 'masks', e.g. the song 'Charlies enormous mouth': I mean, put a 'Paris' ( ... Hilton!) for the 'Charlie' and you have the whole picture as it applies for today. Or the fabulous and til today unsurpassed fabulous rap song 'Dumb all over'.

If you're looking for a ""greatest hits"" kind of thing, or a compilation of Zappa's old stuff from the Mothers of Invention days, this isn't for you. Most of the set list comes ""You Are What You Is,"" Sheik Yerbouti"" and his late 1970s albums, with an eclectic smattering of classics (""Montana,"" for example). But the arrangements are fabulous, the lineup is fantastic and the songs really ""pop"" (perhaps ""rock"" would've been a better adjective) in a live setting.",1383523200,,505,4.952941176470588
3545645,5,B001E45T02,"I was 4 years old when this was apparently aired on MTV and I don't we even had cable then so there is no way I or anyone younger can relate to what was cut out musically. The sound and picture quality of this release is excellent. The band sounds fantastic though I do feel the absence of Ike Willis in this show. You are expecting to hear him sing the parts of You Are What You Is and Bobby Martin ends up doing them. That's not really a criticism because Martin and Ray White fill in well but it was something that I noticed immediately.

What's a little disappointing about this release is that it is JUST music. There is nothing about this show which suggests its a Frank Zappa Halloween Show. The music could've been played at any time during 1981. I was hoping for a little crowd interaction and a better sense of what being at that show was like. Baby Snakes does this extremely well but this is strictly music.",1372982400,,919,4.281609195402299

Not so many years earlier, the double Sheik Yerbouti (live basic tracks with studio overdubs), and as many as three unauthorized releases.  He was very prolific.  This 80s lineup was rather awesome.  Steve Vai stunt guitar.  Pretty much, the entire 80s live concert repertoire is included.  This was actually shown on cable television a lot!  The original MTV broadcast, and two repackaged cable specials.  And if that was not enough, you also get a music video.  FZ made a video for the song You Are What You Is.

3545648,5,B001E45T02,"This is a highly enjoyable and very high quality 2010 Eagle Rock DVD release of Frank Zappa's 1982 feature length (2hr) concert video ""The Torture Never Stops"" which was assembled from the professionally filmed Halloween 1981 shows in New York. It is credited as being transferred direct from Frank's own 1"" video master, and it's hard to imagine it could be any better (however a Blu-ray version would eliminate the split second pause as the layers change on the DVD-9). The video quality is superb - so close to film, but with just a hint of what was unavoidable with even the very best of 1981 video cameras. The stereo audio is huge, crystal clear and so beautifully mixed you could cry with joy. An astounding band too - and incredibly tight with some mind boggling arrangements, while convincing you that it's all just a walk in the park. Great DVD extras - including two out-take songs, and a professionally made video for ""You Are What You Is"" which could never be aired on any conservative TV network. My favourite performances from this are ""Alien Orifice"", ""Dumb All Over"", ""Strictly Genteel"" and ""Stevie's Spanking"" which features a beautiful duet between Frank Zappa and Steve Vai. I don't know if I've used enough superlatives in this mini review yet, so please add a half dozen more for camera work, editing, production, DVD design and the liner notes by Scott Thunes.",1363132800,,1383,4.7907949790794975
3545649,5,B001E45T02,"The video was recieved much faster than expected. The dvd and package were new,as described. I have ordered at this site before and have never been disappointed.
Zappa...what can I say...altho this was a class act!",1352678400,,214,4.972222222222222
3545650,4,B001E45T02,"And what I mean by that title is - there were actually 2 shows that night in NYC, a matinee and an evening, and the DVD seems to be a condensed version of both shows. NOT a complete version of either, or even the complete show that aired live on MTV that night (which, based on the bootleg VHS (and now DVD) that I have was the evening show).

So, what you get is a partial recording of a show that, in my opinion, is better than the 1984 shows, but not up to the standards of the 73-74 band or that Gold Standard of Zappa shows: Baby Snakes. In fact, as many others have pointed out, this concert was somewhat lackluster compared to the 70s shows, like Zappa wasn't enjoying himself as much anymore.

And yes, as many of us already know, this is the exact same footage that was previously released on The Dubroom Special so I guess that's why I was so disappointed, when they announced they were finally releasing this; I naturally assumed they WERE going to release both shows. Or at least the complete program as aired on MTV.

But the band IS awesome; one of Frank's better line-ups and the DVD looks and sounds good. It's not 5.1, only PCM stereo, but if you have a good audio system that won't make much of a difference. Chad Wakerman's drums are a little too buried in the mix, the vocals are too ""forward"" and it's a little bass heavy for my taste, but still pretty good. Better than some that ARE in 5.1 in fact!!

A few other notes; regardless of what Zappa says in the liner notes of YCDTOSA vol I, disc 2, I do not believe the Dumb All Over/Heavenly Bank Account/Suicide Chump sequence on the CD is from these shows, there are no solos on Suicide Chump on the DVD. And, if they were simply edited out, it is hands-down the greatest video editing I have ever seen. You can't tell at all.

And the break between Jumbo Go Away and Stevie's Spanking is also VERY smooth. Not only are they from the 2 different shows (Jumbo from matinee, Spanking evening), shortly into Spanking you can still see Vai and his guitar tech swapping the electric Sitar (or whatever it is) he played on Sinister Footwear for the Stratocaster he uses during Spanking!!

Which is the source of what is probably my greatest gripe.....I LOVE Footwear, think it is one of Zappa's best instrumentals and it IS on the bootleg of the MTV show that I have. So I was GREATLY disappointed to see it was left off this disc and darn near threw something at the TV when discovering so (didn't bother to read the tracklist beforehand)

In fact the one thing I CAN say is that ALL the video editing is excellent, it plays like a continuous concert and if you didn't know the above facts would think it was!

In addition to Sinister Footwear there are several more from that night I would have LOVED to have seen on the DVD - Yo' Mama, What's New In Baltimore?, Moggio , Joes' Garage and Why Does It Hurt When I Pee being the main ones.

As for the bonus section, you do get 2 more songs: Teenage Prostitute and City of Tiny lights, as well as the original conceptual video for You Are What You Is. But a warning if you also own Baby Snakes - DON'T bother watching City of Tiny Lights, it is probably THE greatest example of how lackluster this concert was compared to Baby Snakes. And is also the perfect example of how drastically Zappa's guitar playing talents had declined during the intervening 4 years since Baby Snakes was filmed. No that I'm saying he was bad but, we all know he didn't play guitar near as much as he had in the 70s, focusing more on composing, and it REALLY shows. Playing City of Tiny Lights from 77 and then this one is almost light and day; the 77 version is so superior.

The complete set lists for both shows are as follows:

Matinee: You Are What You Is, Mudd Club, The Meek Shall Inherit Nothing, Dumb All Over/Heavenly Bank Account/Suicide Chump, Jumbo Go Away, Envelopes, Drowning Witch, What's New In Baltimore?, Moggio, We're Turning Again, Alien Orifice, Teenage Prostitute, Flakes, Broken Hearts Are For Assholes, The Blue Light, Tinseltown Rebellion, Yo Mama, Bobby Brown, City Of Tiny Lights, Strictly Genteel, Dancin' Fool, Whipping Post

Evening: Black Napkins, Montana, Easy Meat, Society Pages/I'm A Beautiful Guy/Beauty Knows No Pain/Charlie's Enormous Mouth, Fine Girl, Teenage Wind, Harder Than Your Husband, Bamboozled By Love, Sinister Footwear, Stevie's Spanking, Cocaine Decisions, Nig Biz, Doreen, Goblin Girl, Black Page No. 2, Tryin To Grow A Chin, Strictly Genteel, The Torture Never Stops, Joe's Garage, Why Does It Hurt When I Pee?, Illinois Enema Bandit

The GREATLY castrated track list of this DVD is:

Black Napkins, Montana, Easy Meat, Beauty Knows No Pain, Charlie's Enormous Mouth, Fine Girl, Teenage Wind, Harder than Your Husband, Bamboozled By Love, We're Turning Again, Alien Orifice, Flakes, Broken Hearts Are For Assholes, You Are What You Is, Mudd Club, The Meek Shall Inherit Nothing, Dumb All Over, Heavenly Bank Account, Suicide Chump, Jumbo Go Away, Stevie's Spanking, The Torture Never Stops, Strictly Genteel, Illinois Enema Bandit

So, comparing the set lists to the DVD track list, you can see what a cut-up piece of sub-par work this DVD ended up being, compared to what we COULD have if the ZFT would have released both shows in their entirety. Even so, I consider it a must have for all Zappa fans because it shows the line-up Frank himself considered one of his best in all it's glory.

So, 4 stars (really more like 3.5) for what could have been. A disc (or even 2 discs) with both complete shows, unedited, would certainly rate 5 stars. Even if it doesn't live up to the standards set by Baby Snakes!!",1342915200,,5656,4.568608094768016

3545652,4,B001E45T02,"I enjoy this DVD now as a more mature listener. Parts of this concert can be seen on the Dub Room Special. I had issues with those parts when I saw them as a much younger person and back to back with Baby Snakes. Compared to the ecstatic performance on Baby Snakes there is not much happening here. The interaction among the group is minimal, and so is the interaction with the audience. Watch this for the music. The playing is tight and the song selection does the trick for me. It may not work for casual Zappa fans, those who like a particular period which happens to not be the 'You are what you is' period, or those who expect the entertainment level of earlier performances. Some of the cutting and editing is a bit weird and unnecessary: transitions between songs cut out abruptly and flickering pans between cameras are not my thing.",1336003200,,842,4.474025974025974
3545653,5,B001E45T02,"I was lucky enough to have had a VCR back in 1981 and I taped the original MTV broadcast of this show.  It's great to now have a perfect version to watch after many years of my old stretched out video cassette.  This is my 2nd favourite Zappa lineup and there are several songs here that weren't in the original MTV broadcast, namely the quite rude ones (Easy Meat, Broken Hearts are for A&*^%$#, The Illinois Enema Bandit).  Unfortunately they left out 3 of my favourite songs from the original broadcast (Society Pages, I'm a Beautiful Guy, Tryin' to Grow a Chin).  Even missing these, I still rank this as 5 stars.

I have also had the luck to see him a number of times with different outfits,even with the Ensemble Modern towards the later part in his life...
I consider this phase here ,in the 80's and this band as probably his weakest...
In this concert presented here the light situation is pretty bad and his Guitar sound sucks(what was that?).
It's this crazy spacey flanger type effect he has on each solo...drives me nuts..doesn't have anything to do with the Les Paul he plays here in stead of the more usual SG.He also seems bored and not really full on...

Frank's solo on the studio album is blistering.....what happened?...  someone showed me an interview with Frank where he openly stated that he hadn't played guitar for a couple of years... well, this was probably the pre-stages of that period... too bad... better off going back to earlier material when he still had the fire... in this DVD, ""the torture never stops.""",1300838400,12,841,4.86013986013986

I have had another copy of this, probably recorded from MTV when it originally aired, but the quality of the recording and the fact that it was recorded onto video cassette made it unbearable to watch and listen.

Overall it's a very good performance. It's a great reminder of how great musicianship used to matter. Even on MTV! However I'm not happy about the long, sweeping phase shifter on Frank's guitar but what the hey, he's the boss. Besides, he only picks up the guitar to solo so it's the only time you have to endure a painfully over-effected guitar.

It must have been exhausting to play with Frank Zappa as he was the only one who got a smoke break. Ha-ha
