905995,4,6304679661,"This movie is not as thrilling as the book by any means, but for a rainy afternoon with a fun ""who-dunnit?"", this movie is a real gem. True the ending is a little sappy compared with the original, but those who  REALLY know Dame Christie, know that the ending she wrote for the stageplay  was very much the same.  All in all, not an overwhemllingly suspensful  movie, but an enjoyable one nevertheless.",962409600,,402,4.541666666666667
905996,4,6304679661,"THE MOVIE: I had forgotten how deliciously amusing this film was, not having seen it since the early 1980s. But the comedy doesn't overwhelm the tone, the blend has a perfectly natural feel and the eerie atmosphere is  maintained even among the laughs. The cast of generally lesser-known  performers is good. Mischa Auer is memorable (as usual) even though the  script doesn't allow him much to do; Walter Huston is as engaging as ever.  The movie is appropriate for most ages, the murders are usually off-camera  and are never gruesome. It holds the viewer's interest very well but the  pace seems a bit uneven - it seems to slow down toward the  end.
TECHNICAL: The DVD presentation is average. The image is not stable;  it wobbles quite a bit around the frame which is especially noticeable  during the opening titles. The black and white picture has good contrast  but is a bit on the soft side. The bios are brief but nicely done screens.  There is also a comedy short on the disc which I haven't yet watched. Sound  is good, dialogue is usually clear throughout.
SUM: I'm ignoring  comparisons to the Agatha Christie novel on which the film is based... with  that in mind, the movie is fun, interesting and worth a viewing. I'm not  entirely sure how well the narrative would hold up on repeat viewings, but  the performances are entertaining enough to warrant them.

905997,4,6304679661,"I saw this movie two days ago and thought it wonderfull.  Casting for this movie was superb, and the plot and character development exquisite. If they would've kept the ending the same, it would have been spectacular.  I was  recently in a production of ""Ten Little Indians"", and thought it  an excelent play and decided to watch the movie to see if I played my  character (Mr. William H. Blore) correctly.  The book was great, I suggest  you read the book before you watch the movie.",953683200,2,484,4.558139534883721
905998,2,6304679661,Don't buy if you like the ending of the book. The other reviews said this version follows the book closely but it doesn't. What made the book such a classic is that all ten people die on the island leaving only a note in a  bottle to explain to the reader how it was done and by whom. When will  Hollywood finally make a real version of Ten little indians? I really don't  want to see Vera and Lombard team up to take out the villain like in every  version of the film I've seen. Call me picky but the other reviews are  misleading. It's O.k. for three quarters but the ending makes it  inexcusable. I only wish I could take it back.,948844800,8,633,4.105691056910569
905999,5,6304679661,"Ten people - who are strangers to each other - are invited to Indian Island by an unseen host.  The guests strangely ""die off"" one by one, and their deaths seem to follow suit & are vaguely similar to an old children's nursery rhyme.........This movie is a great adaptation of Agatha Christie's TEN LITTLE INDIANS, which is generally considered to be her finest novel. The actors fit their character roles brilliantly, with Dame Judith Anderson standing out as Emily Brent who wonders whether the ""eggs are fresh"". June Duprez is surprisingly modern in her playing, rather like a forties version of Diana Rigg (a'la THE AVENGERS). Walter Huston and Barry Fitzgerald are a most fascinating duo who SEEM to be ""in cahoots"" with each other. Richard Hadyn possessed one of the most comically unique voices of any actor in films; he and Mischa Auer give the film its best comical moments. The film is unfortunately a bit house-bound but it's VERY atmospheric due to Rene Claire's special touch.",943920000,15,989,4.886904761904762
906000,5,6304679661,"I saw this movie as a child while visting a friend in Switzerland. It was on TV with german subtitles. Since then, I have seen this movie several times as a adult. It still brings form and intrigue to the Agatha Christie  book. Ten ""little indians"" all left alone on a small island. The  movie was cast with some of the best actors and actresses of the time. Well  worth watching on a rainy and stormy night.....",938476800,3,412,4.324675324675325
906001,5,6304679661,"I think that Rene Clair has directed one of the BEST adaptations of an Agatha Christie novel.  I like her books, but bore of Poirot and Marple after a while.  This story manages to have depth, mystery and suspense  without bringing in her 2 most popular characters (thank God!).  I have  loved this movie for years, and am glad that it is now on DVD.  I can watch  and watch and watch without running holes in the tape.  <smile>",934502400,,428,4.329113924050633
906002,5,6304679661,"By far the best screen adaptation of Agatha Christie, (not to be mentioned in the same breath with the tepid ""Death on the Nile,"" and  ""Murder on the Orient Express"") you have tantalizing mystery,  thrilling suspense, black humor, splendid acting, perfect production, and  almost geometrically brilliant direction all in one highly enjoyable  package. Internationally famous director Rene Clair here presents the  classic mystery with such style and skill, that you truly have no idea  what's going to happen next. His craftsmanlike care and attention to detail  make all ten characters at once capable and incapable of the murders. The  careful casting is also inspired, a troupe containing no types to suggest  assured innocence or guilt; yet hardly a collection of no-name  fresh off his Oscar-winning performance; Louis Hayward, a now forgotten,  but hugely appealing playboy sort; Roland Young, delightfully bumbling; and  the adenoidal Richard Haydn, in his most winning performance. These are  particular standouts in a sterling cast which also includes Judith  Anderson, C. Aubrey Smith, and Mischa Auer. The great mansion is also a  triumph of art direction, handsomely photographed in moody black-and-white  by Lucien Androit; and music likewise assists to create tempo and  atmosphere. Humor is also in generous doses, provided by scriptwriter  Dudley Nichols, (""Bringing Up Baby,""""Stagecoach,"" etc.)  a master at pointing up the action with the humor, rather than interrupting  it. Finally, like all great movies, this one gets better and better as it  goes along, culminating in a classic denouement with a neat sting in its  tail. Even after the culprit is revealed, you'll want to go back and study  the skill at which the mystery was sustained! A true classic totally  undeserved of its indifference from the Academy and today's top-ten lists.  It will challenge any armchair sleuth out there!",918432000,17,1909,5.368243243243243
906116,3,6304679661,"My only real problem with this movie is the big reveal at the end. Ordinarily, the final twist is the best part of these kinds of movies but for me I just felt cheated here. Be advised, my explanation below contains slight spoilers:

The villian does an amazing job blending in with his/her victims and, as you would imagine, he/she would go to great lengths to appear innocent. In a situation where people are dying off left and right, the only sure-fire way to appear  innocent is to turn up dead. Near the end of the movie when there are only a few people left alive, you (should) start to think back to those that died. Of the poor victims, a few die what would be a bloody death. However, due to what could/couldn't be shown in films during this time, you never actually see one drop of blood. They make sense of this with some of the deaths (e.g., the murder weapon was cleaned) but not the one that mattered. With one specific death, there should have been an obsene amount of blood and yet there wasn't. I disregarded this as the practical limitations of the movie itself and didn't think anything of it. When the final twist was revealed, I was very disappointed because it made everything surrounding that death truly unbelievable in the movie's universe. As a person watching the movie I understand that not everything in the movie is real (duh). For example, they are in a studio not on an island. When someone dies in the movie, they are not dead in real life. On the other hand, everything is supposed to be real for the characters. The characters are on an island and they are dying off one by one. So when I don't see blood where I would ordinarily see a ton of blood, I disregard it because it's a movie. When the characters SHOULD see  blood but don't, there is really no logical  explanation for why no one would ask, ""If he/she died in this way, why isn't there a single drop of blood?"" Thus, when the movie tries to surprise me by revealing that the specific death was staged, it doesn't make any sense  why the other characters didn't question it earlier. Had they simply asked the previously mentioned question, they would have discovered who the villian was much earlier.",1517184000,,2195,4.491228070175438

Ten people, strangers to each other, are invited to a lavish estate on an island. Through a recording, their mysterious host accuses each of his guests of murder and proceeds to exact justice. The tension mounts as, one by one; the number of people is reduced through the ingenious plotting of the unseen killer. Finally only two are left and each is uncertain as to whether or not the other is the murderer. A top cast of veteran performers, bring the intricate twist of the plot to life. One of the most thrilling novels and best adaptations of Agatha Christie's best-selling mystery novel And Then There Were None, climaxes at the spine tingling conclusion. Though its subject matter is dark, the screenplay injects considerable wit and humour into the proceedings, especially as you watch a thriller that has carved its own special niche in the realm of tales of suspense and mystery.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: This Agatha Christie's murder story film AND THEN THERE WERE NONE ' [aka 'Ten Little Indians'] is by this point so well-known and has been adapted, referenced and spoofed so many times on stage, screen, television, radio and even a video game, that its return to this Blu-ray disc in its best and most famous film version ever, and to have this 1945 edition directed by Ren Clair is very welcome indeed.

If Alfred Hitchcock is considered to be the Master of Suspense, then by all means should Agatha Christie be declared Mistress of the same arena? Her works of mystery have sparked countless stage and screen adaptations, one of the best-known being the 1945's 'AND THERE WERE NONE film. Boasting an impressive cast that includes the likes of Walter Huston and Barry Fitzgerald, this film, based on the Agatha Christie novel Ten Little Indians, has long since proven itself to be the veritable template for a big chunk of the murder mysteries to follow in the years after its release. At first it was considered clich by genre standards, but by no means does that deter from the suspenseful magic that the picture manages to weave over the course of the running time.

The set-up is very simple. Ten seemingly random individuals have been brought together under rather unusual circumstances. The group, which ranges from a wise Judge Francis J. Quinncannon [Barry Fitzgerald] and an alcoholic doctor Dr. Edward G. Armstrong [Walter Huston] to a shy secretary Vera Claythorne [June Duprez] and a dashing explorer Philip Lombard [Louis Hayward], has been invited to a sprawling island mansion as the guests of host of U. N. Owen. It turns out that none of the ten knows or has even seen the elusive ""U. N. Owen,"" but he is certainly familiar with them, as a gramophone record he leaves is to be played condemning each of the ten for their past crimes of misdemeanours they may or may not have committed, as U. N. Owen signed his instructions to the obligatory butler Thomas Rogers [Richard Haydn]; they suddenly realise it stands for ""unknown."" The guests decide to leave, but Thomas Rogers the obligatory butler informs them that the boat will not return until Monday, and it is only Friday.

The situation turns grimmer when one of the guests mysteriously dies, with another strange death following the next day. The survivors quickly determine that these deaths were no coincidences. They surmise that their homicidal host has taken it upon himself to punish them for their misdeeds, picking them off one by one in the style of the ""Ten Little Indians"" nursery rhyme. But as the guests start attempting to weed out U. N. Mr. Owen, they come to another shocking conclusion: the killer they're searching for may just be one of their own.

'AND THEN THERE WERE NONE isn't an especially complex or convoluted mystery, but it doesn't need to be. It's just a simple ""whodunit"" that coasts along rather well on the effective, bare-bones nature of its story. You just have to know what happens next, and for the most part, director Ren Clair does a nifty job of always keeping the story moving in an intriguing direction. He does this by making the wise decision to cast suspicion on each and every one of the characters.

In retrospect, the one who turns out to be the mysterious Mr. Owen is a no-brainer, but watching the film for the first time, the viewer is in a true state of suspense, as little hints and red herrings are scattered throughout, endowing all of the characters with the potential to commit murder. With an island setting that proves to be as expansive as it is claustrophobic, 'AND THEN THERE WERE NONE' really knows how to keep one on your toes, cooking up an atmosphere that goes along perfectly with the story.

The few speed bumps encountered along the way aren't crippling, but the distractions they provide are definitely noticeable. As there tends to be with a lot of murder mysteries, there's quite a bit of down time in between killings. This leaves portions of the film in which the characters just wander around until the next addition to the body count furthers the plot.

There's some investigation involved, but a lot of the time, we get Judge Francis J. Quinncannon [Barry Fitzgerald] character serving as a one-man army, coming up with explanations left and right while the others sit around waiting to be knocked off. The pacing tends to get a little wobbly and repetitive as a result, but as I mentioned before, it's not enough to completely ruin the film as a whole. The varied selection of actors and characters make sure that the viewers are involved one way or another. The film's finest performances belongs to Dr. Edward G. Armstrong [Walter Huston] as the disgraced doctor and Thomas Rogers [Richard Haydn] as the obligatory butler, who, in one of the script's more darkly comedic moments, refuses to serve dinner after being accused of being the killer.

One problem with screen versions of the murder mystery genre is that it is too easy for characters to have their intentions uncovered prematurely due to the directing of the actors and their expressions. Unlike some of the many later adaptations, this version does a good job of maintaining suspense up until the final scene when the truth is revealed. Ren Clair keeps us guessing what will happen next, while offering limited foreshadowing. Suspicion is cast on all parties as the characters grapple with their predicament, and the cast does a fine job relaying their fear and anxiety without exposing the answer to the enigma. The cinematography utilises the location effectively, with constant reminders of their desolation adding to the atmosphere, and odd, deliberate camera angles heighten the tension. Like all Agatha Christie mysteries, the finale puts all the pieces together, and the ending here, while predictable to a point, is satisfying, if liberally adapted for the screen. While not exactly faithful to the novel, it is a good translation in tone. For an excellent, old fashioned whodunit, you cannot go wrong with this very fine Blu-ray release of the film 'AND THEN THERE WERE NONE.'

Blu-ray Image Quality  'AND THEN THERE WERE NONE is presented on Blu-ray courtesy of VCI Entertainment with a 1080p transfer and the usual 1.33:1aspect ratio of that period. In the years after its release, 'AND THEN THERE WERE NONE fell into the public domain, and it has been released onto DVD by various distributors. It hasn't looked pristine in a very long time, and this new release on Blu-ray from VCI Entertainment, is no exception. The sad news, since VCI Entertainment is touting this on its artwork as ""Newly Restored!"" It may be newly restored, but it certainly hasn't been restored to anything resembling immaculate condition. There is graininess, unsteadiness, and most of all a general softness to the image, which looks like it may have been sourced from a 16mm print. While not a terrible transfer, the hope created by the ""newly restored"" verbiage on the box cover makes this a disappointing one. VCI Entertainment is generally a reliable company that puts out good versions of hard-to-see classics and public domain titles, so this is an anomaly for them. But all that being said, this version is still watchable, so this release is still recommended.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  'AND THEN THERE WERE NONE is presented with a 2.0 LPCM Mono Audio track and sounds reasonably problem free, given realistic expectations of the age of the film. There is some very slight distortion evident in the music, but dialogue comes through nicely, albeit with a fair amount of hiss. There are a few pops that have not been completely eliminated, but overall everything is easy to hear, and is sadly not empowered with much dynamic range, which I suppose is all down the master negative.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras: Sadly VCI Entertainment felt there was no need for any extras for this Blu-ray disc, which is a crying shame, as I am sure Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation must have in their vault all manner of extras, like there must be loads of black-and-white photographs from scenes from the film and especially all the actors.

Finally, 'AND THEN THERE WERE NONE is a perfect gem of a classic Black-and-White film of its genre, but sadly VCI Entertainment probably did their best, whatever elements it was able to scrape together, but their efforts are hampered by some odd decisions, notably making this release so very dark. Things aren't horrible here, but there is still is an abundance of grain, so whatever clean-up was done, was done with a naturally filmic look in mind, but my sense is someone is going to need to find much better elements and then really meticulously restore them frame by frame in order for 'AND THEN THERE WERE NONE to really pop in high definition. Despite this being the only high definition Blu-ray copy available at this moment in time, I am really pleased to add this to my extensive Blu-ray Collection and if you are into good Murder Mystery type genre, then this is a definite must view this classic black-and-white film. Highly Recommended!

I enjoyed the Sherlock Holmes short story after the movie ended far more than the movie itself, as a result, because I couldn't help feeling that the movie took all the teeth out of the book.

SPOILERS:

- In the book, everybody was guilty of the crimes of which they were accused, and by the end, everyone is actually dead. This is... kind of integral to the plot. By making the two (good-looking) people in the movie innocent and making it so they both live... it kind of ruined the entire story. Also, in the movie, the person Vera supposedly killed was an adult, not a child as it was in the book, which changes her entire characterization.
- In the book, the first person to die is Tony Marston, who is described as young, incredibly good looking, and is often likened to a Nordic god. He was guilty of running over and killing two children while speeding (he had absolutely no remorse for this). In the movie, rather inexplicably, they change him to this weaselly Russian prince guy. And no mention of the fact that they were children. It's as though audiences at the time were incapable of figuring out that good-looking people are also capable of being morally bankrupt. I kind of got the impression that this was important to the story, and between how they treated Tony, and how they treated Vera and Lombard, the movie completely turned this theme upside-down.
- A really cool feature of the book is that there is an extra mystery at the end, of how the killer managed to completely flummox the investigators. He went to extraordinary lengths to make his suicide match with the account of how he died, leaving no visible sign that he actually died at the end, and not in the middle, as the diary entries would leave the investigators to believe. This is a key part of his characterization... the fact that he really wanted to confuse the investigation afterwards, and how he had it all planned out.

It wasn't all bad. I did like the change they made to Ms Brent's character... if anything, that made her worse (in a good way). And some of the comedy was enjoyable, if out of place. (Although why anybody would think that it's ""strange"" that a butler would get drunk after his wife died, some mystery person was threatening to kill him, and a lot of people were accusing him of being the killer, is beyond me). And the movie was interesting when viewed as a piece of history.

907739,5,6304679661,"Just finished watching ""And Then There Were None"" released 20th Century Fox.""
Perhaps the most atmospheric adaptions of Agatha Christie's suspenseful novel, ""And Then There Were None[Ten Little Indians],"" Rene Clair directed this masterpiece of a unknown mastermind who constructs a carefully laid plan to kill off ten people on a lonely island who he, or quite possibly she, thinks is deserving of death after they had escaped the penalty of their crimes through the criminal justice system.
Clair deftly blended humor and suspense as one-by-one, all the guests of Indian Island are murdered in highly inventive ways right up until the end where the mastermind is revealed.
A Great Classic!
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

This one has a great cast coupled  with an excellent script that is laced with humor. Moreover, it has a most capable director at the helm. So, it is a very atmospheric whodunit. Fan of Agatha Christie will be well pleased with this adaptation.

Ten people are lured to a remote, isolated island. It is soon revealed why they are there, and it does not bode well for them, when one by one they begin being murdered for some past transgression. Is there a murderer among them? If so, who is it? Will they discoverable who  the killer is in time? These are some of the issues with which they have to grapple, and time is of the essence.

I viewed this film on Amazon Prime and the images on this black and white film were crisp, clear, and static free.

One, the movie is slow-moving and feels more like a parlor game than the fearsome situation that the book managed to present. Second, the first man killed in the movie is repentant over his crime, while in the book the first man to die is a guiltless scumbag that the reader doesn't regret being killed. Others in the book are not all sympathetic either, and the murderer deliberately set things up so that the police who come later couldn't possibly figure out who did the killings-until a written confession is found later, where the murderer justifies their actions. I don't remember a cat in the book either.

908630,5,6304679661,"I won't bore you with a repetition of the plot. This review is for a specific DVD issue.

The IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT (Corinth Films) 2001 DVD issue of this little classic is the best version I have seen so far. It is from the Wade Williams collection.

There are a lot of really lousy DVD's out there with absolutely terrible picture quality and almost unintelligible sound. The Image Entertainment DVD has mostly remedied that by combining a very clean British print of the movie with truly terrible titles from the American print that everyone hates because it is in such terrible condition.

Hence, the picture titles open with the usual wavy image that jumps around quite a lot. But don't be discouraged. As soon as the action begins the picture stabilizes and is quite presentable. The sound is particularly good, clear and virtually hiss free.

Why not just give us a complete copy of the British film? Well, this movie was originally released in the UK under the title ""Ten Little N-words"" (Amazon rejected my review for using a direct quote). In deference to today's sensibilities, it was thought best to utilize the American titles, no matter how bad their condition. The original British titles are included as the DVD's only extra. (No mention is made of this extra on the DVD cover artwork.)

Unless someone discovers an original answer print of this movie in some vault, or a full restoration is done by Criterion, this Image Entertainment presentation is likely as good as we can expect to get.",1454716800,,1505,4.817829457364341

I turned 55 this year (2015) so maybe young people wouldn't like it because it's a typical black and white movie with no real musical background to make it more interesting. However, it's really good if young people can overlook the old style (that I personally enjoy) They really should remake it because the story is excellent!.",1451088000,,504,4.43010752688172

910044,4,6304679661,"This film is based on Agatha Christie's play adaptation of her own novel. The premise involves ten strangers invited to a mansion on a deserted island by someone they've never met. Via phonograph, their absent ""host"" accuses each one of them of orchestrating or committing a murder. The plot unfolds with tight suspense as one-by-one, the visitors die mysteriously while alone, and each time one little Indian figurine disappears from the centerpiece on the dining table. The survivors quickly come to suspect one another.  (My bet was on the cat at first... he does seem to pop his cute little face in everywhere.)

The characters are varied and well-developed. Some I grew to love, some I loved to hate, and some kept me guessing. I did not foresee the climactic reveal (though I never like to spoil my own fun, so I don't try very hard to solve the mystery myself).  Unlike some reviewers, I enjoyed the ""Hollywood ending,"" though it was a bit abrupt. On the whole, a very satisfying story.

I have few criticisms. I did think some of the comedy felt forced, especially in the person of the drunken butler. There is some wit in the dialogue, but not as much as I would have liked. (I've been watching a lot of Hitchcock lately, so I'm measuring similar films not directed by him with that yardstick.)  Most of the ingenuity is in the story itself and in one or two of the better characterizations.

I reserve five-star ratings for the very best of the superior, so my rating for this movie is four stars. Or perhaps four-and-a-half.

Note: I streamed this film and viewed it on computer screen.  I therefore cannot comment on the quality of the DVD or Blu-ray transfers.",1420848000,,1673,4.666666666666667

910181,5,6304679661,"This is my favorite filmed version of an Agatha Christie mystery.  Everyone knows the basic premise of the story so it is not necessary to repeat it. Cinema lost something very special when movies made the change from  black & white to color film.  This is especially true for mysteries and horror films.  The light and shadow in this film add so much to the creepy feel of the piece and this is a movie that requires atmosphere.  The mix of characters is also a treat.  The players are stereotypes, in a sense, of certain ""types"" among English character actors.  This gives you, right from the beginning, a feeling of knowing who the characters are.  There is some overacting too which adds some humor to the plot.  The butler is particularly fun in this respect.  Barry Fitzgerald, however, steals the show with his witty, tongue in cheek performance.

As the murders progress and the number of survivors dwindles, there is genuine tension and dread in the film.  The ending is one of the real surprises (at least at the time the film was made) in And Then There Were None.  I give this film 5 stars for plot, characters, atmosphere and fun.",1418515200,4,1143,4.599009900990099

910282,5,6304679661,"Agatha Christie's ""And then there were none"" is an absolutely delicious who-dunnit, one of her very best. Although this film version alters the ending, it is otherwise quite true to Christie'e novel. The cast is full of familiar faces and the well-known actors play their parts to the hilt. Ten strangers moored on an island in a creepy house full of dark shadows are bumped off one by one apparently murdered by the absent host Mr. Owen, who invited the guests. Mr. Owen is acting as executioner of each person, each of whom had secretly committed a murder, but the guests explore the mansion and island, seeking him in vain. The deaths follow a children's song about ten little Indians who dropped by the wayside in some form or other until there's only one little Indian left.

The gaggle of guests is fascinating, especially the butler, Rogers, played by Richard Haydn with his hilariously mobile face and inimitable voice. Mischa Auer as the Russian prince Starloff hams it up outrageously, while Judith Anderson's Emily Brent as the persnickety and disdainful spinster is perfect. Barry Fitzgerald and Walter Huston as a judge and doctor attempt to act as good old boys and buddies, but when the lights go out grab a  poker or a cue stick as weapons as they circle eye each other, wondering if the other guy is Mr. Owen. Roland Young, a detective, runs around in a somewhat scatter-brained fashion seeming to be everywhere at once while accomplishing nothing. C. Aubrey Smith, a retired general, is very deaf, and really hasn't a clue as to what is up, but is strangely sympathetic when he reminisces about his dead wife(although he probably killed her). June Duprez, playing a secretary, looks chic and quite modern in the role and of course the young Explorer, Lombard, again good casting with Louis Hayward, falls for her in spite of the mayhem.

This movie is a real gas, it's just darned fun and there's plenty of suspense and big dollops of humor. Enjoy!",1416787200,3,1966,4.776470588235294

This includes 8 invited guests and two servants - who find themselves facing their own deaths.  At dinner, their unidentified host informs them, via a gramophone record, that they have all been responsible for someone's death and each one will die before the weekend is out.  There is no way for any of them to flee the island because the watercraft that carried them has departed, so they set about trying to determine who their hidden host might be and where he may be hiding.  One of the ten people is killed and it appears that the murderer is maybe the unseen host Mr. U.N. Own.  After searching the premises inside and out they turn up no clues as to the killer and each person then begins to suspect the remaining guests.  The person who is the prime suspect is always the person who is murdered next.  One by one, the guests are killed off until only two people seem to be left.

910655,3,6304679661,"AND THEN THERE WERE NONE, 1945. This  97 minute crime | drama | mystery | thriller  is an adaptation of Agatha Christie's classic murder mystery TEN LITTLE INDIANS, and the stage play based upon it.  In this black and white picture, an enigmatic, unknown host calling himself Mr. U. N. Owen, invites ten strangers to a remote island mansion, where his guests, all of whom Mr. Owen accuses of being killers, discover there's a killer among them. The very strong cast, headed by Barry Fitzgerald and Walter Huston, begins to shrink one by one. It was helmed for M-G-M by the legendary French director Ren Clair, nearing the end of his self-imposed World War II Hollywood exile.

The cast includes Barry Fitzgerald, (THE QUIET MAN, BRINGING UP BABY), as Judge Francis J. Quincannon; Walter Huston,(TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE)  as Dr. Edward G. Armstrong  and  Louis Hayward(REPEAT PERFORMANCE, THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK) as Philip Lombard.  Also  Roland Young as Detective William Henry Blore; June Duprez as Vera Claythorne; Mischa Auer as Prince Nikita Nikki Starloff;  C. Aubrey Smith as Gen. Sir John Mandrake and Judith Anderson as Emily Brent.  Ive actually watched this picture every now and then, whenever it popped up on late night television, for most of my life, as Louis Hayward was my first movie star crush. And no sneering please: who was your first movie star crush?

The movie holds up pretty well in the  suspense department, lightened as it is by various comic bits.  However, if you are thinking of purchasing it, do so with care.  The original copyright owner allowed it to lapse, and the film to fall into the public domain.  There are many poor copies of it out there.",1406073600,,1689,4.7923875432525955

The sets are sumptuous and the acting is fine; however, the movie has not lasted well over the years. There's just too much humor for the movie to have that 40's noir feel, and there's not enough romance to justify that particular subplot's existence.

910662,3,6304679661,"I love both Agatha Christie and B&W films, but this movie did not do it for me.

One point was that they changed the names and the particulars of some of the characters, and I am an Agatha Christie purist. I think she is one of the few authors whose books have great characterization and dialogue and, whilst not expecting a script to be word-for-word, don't think much change is necessary.

Visually - I can only describe the film as ""grainy"" - but that word is not quite right. It just did not have a clarity to it that other films of the period had so am not sure if that was purposefully meant to convey a mood; if so, I did not grasp the meaning, just found it distracting.

Characterization - I didn't think the characters as written came across well on screen. Ms. Brent did not seem as old, Philip Lombard not as dashing and a bit ""other side of the law"" and Marston became a ""Prince""  and (to me, anyway) quite irritating to watch.

BUT it is important for me to say, due to the above, I could not watch the entire movie so am not sure how the ending played out and whether the suspense was built as well as the book.

Ultimately, I think I have just been a bit spoiled by the dead-on casting of David Suchet, Joan Hickson, Francesca Annis and James Warwick...",1403913600,,1269,4.266666666666667

911058,4,6304679661,"First off, as many of you may be aware, Amazon has the odd policy of grouping reviews of ALL releases - whether Bluray, or earlier releases by different companies together. So, eve though this Bluray release from VCI was released last month, there are 222 (!) reviews. So the best way to check the reviews is to sort by ""Newest First"" and then read backwards.

With that said, this is my review of the Bluray from VCI. It may differ from other reviews that say they are of the same title and release date but I have just watched my copy. Though VCI stares on the package ""NEWLY RESTORED!"", I'm guessing that they had a copy with a worn soundtrack to start with. I say that because, except for maybe the first few minutes the image is clean with no scratches, while the sound is less than optimum.  I think I read an recent review that sad there were only 4 chapter stops. In fact, there are 13 stops (chapters). And, though the sound can sometimes be rough, the set up offers English Subtitles.  An unusual ""set up"" feature I've honestly never seen before is ""Audio for the visually handicapped"". YES, audio.! If you choose this option a crystal-clear voice describes the scenes andeven reads all the credits. Can you imagine? A visually handicapped - or blind - person can ""watch "" this film!

I won't go into the plot except to say that it's an Agatha Christie classic and you won't know ""who dunnit?"" until the very end.

So, I enjoyed it - can't give it more than four stars because of the audio quality though - and maybe this is a newer version from VCI to correct some problems others said they had.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

I believe 16mm is the film format used to master this Blu-ray, so it will not look as sharp as a major studio Blu-ray release.  This would probably be better suited as a DVD re-master release and not a Blu-ray as it is still soft for a Blu-ray.

MISSING from the original VCI DVD is the ""20th Century Fox"" logo at the beginning of the film and a BONUS short starring Leon Errol ""TWIN HUSBANDS"".  The omission of the bonus short is no big deal, it is already on VCI's Leon Errol's Comedy Collection,

So if you don't expect a nice re-master like Warner Brothers would do, then you will be happy with this upgrade fromVCI's previous release (even if it is only DVD quality).

AS FOR THE MOVIE ITSELF, this is the best adaptation of Agatha Christie's story.  But it is an adaptation of the play variation that Agatha Christie wrote which differs from the original book novel.",1378339200,7,1742,5.5643939393939394

The movie starts with a view of a rocky coastline. A small boat carries passengers to an island on Friday. We see a large mansion where the people visit. Its very quiet. ""I don't know anything"" says the housekeeper. The visitors introduce themselves. Two guests share a bathroom. Dinner is served at eight. [For the English the word ""Indian"" refers to Asians.] That nursery rhyme is sung. The butler plays a record on the gramophone. Mr. Owen speaks to the group and accuses them of murders! The housekeeper screams. Who is Mr. Owen? Mrs. Rogers gets a sedative. The guests explain how they came to be there (invitation or hired). They can't leave until Monday. The piano player drinks from his glass and collapses on the floor. The next morning the housekeeper doesn't wake up. They must prepare their own breakfast.

A man peeks through a keyhole. ""What do you see?"" The men search the island for Mr. Owen. The General stares out to sea; he will not join the others for dinner. The Judge provides an explanation about Mr. Owen! Who is the likely suspect? Be on your guard! Why would Mr. Owen set himself up as judge, jury, and executioner? There is a cold supper. People are distrustful. A room is locked and the key given to Mr. Rogers. ""Lock your doors."" Miss Brent went out early. They find Rogers outside on the ground. A woman could have done it! [Note the pump in the kitchen.] They gossip about Miss Brent, but no longer is a suspect. One man has a revolver, but it is missing. Do the Judge and the Doctor trust each other? The electricity has failed. The survivors tell about their past. Lombard does not deny the charges. They hear a loud noise and Vera screamed! Where is the Judge? He won't answer. ""Who will be next?"" The Doctor questions Vera. She denies killing a man. Is that suspicious?

That night Vera awakes to see Lombard watching her through the window. He gives her his revolver, and they talk. Vera explains her innocence, and Lombard tells her a secret. They inquire about the other two. The Doctor has gone missing from the house and can't be found. The next morning they go outside to search. The detective thinks of a solution to the murders. Lombard and Vera hear someone outside their rooms. They go to the shore and find a body; its been there for hours! Lombard talks to Vera. ""There's got to be an explanation."" We soon learn the solution. ""Mr. Owen"" explains his search for perfect justice, and how he did it. He tells Vera why she must hang. But no plan is perfect.

You will understand this movie best if you read the book first, but that will remove the surprise ending (even when it is different from the book). Raymond Chandler's ""The Simple Art of Murder"" criticized the mystery novels that are created to present a puzzle for the readers. This famous novel could have caused this essay. Real murders are seldom so well planned so everything goes according to the script. Some of the characters in this movie were changed along with some of the details. This produces an attraction to those who read the book. Agatha Christie used authority figures as ""bad hats"" (judge, doctor, army officer, and policemen). What was the point? The book is more explicit than this movie.",1343520000,,3249,4.606217616580311

911569,3,6304679661,"No question that I like my detective stories to feature hard-boiled, world- wary, world-weary tough guy detectives ready to take a slug or two for some windmill cause, or, better, for some wayward dame, for some two-timing femme fatale who gets her comeuppance (or not) as he keeps that shoulder to the wheel seeking to eke some rough justice out of this wicked old world. Dashiell Hammett's Sam Spade and Raymond Chandler's Phillip Marlowe come easily, and readily, to mind. As do such films as The Big Sleep, The Maltese Falcon, and The Thin Man.

Of course before Hammett and Chandler toughened up the crime-fighting world with their hard-edged windmill seekers of rough justice such heavy lifting was done in parlors, and drawing rooms. Figured out by gallants, professional or not. And the queen of parlor detection was Agatha Christie who spent a life's career creating such works, such works as the film adaptation of her work under review, Then There Were None."" (And a later film version under the title Ten Little Indians)

Now Ms. Christie never recoiled from piling the corpses high (although usually not in the parlor, or drawing room) and she does not fail us here. Here ten people of various class backgrounds and professions are invited to a seaside English manor house (of course, Ms. Christie  was, ah, English and manor houses have lots of rooms to stuff corpses and big parlors too) by a Mr. Owen for some nefarious purpose. What joins the ten together is that all bear various amounts of responsibility for the deaths (murders?) of one or more persons. And while the law was not able to bring them to even rough justice it is soon apparent, as the bodies pile up, that Mr. Owen is seeking to be his own avenger. Except of course one cannot go around committing mass murder by the numbers (literally with a ten, nine..., countdown right on the dinner room table to keep a scorecard tabulation) especially since the villain of the piece (one of the ten) perhaps did not peruse the records as carefully as he/she should have and not everybody is guilty of murder, or anything.

Maybe there are fewer corpses (although sometimes not by much) but give me that windmill-tilting, take a punch for the good of the cause,  hard-boiled  detective, especially those twisting in the wind over some two-timing frail every time.

This is Rene Clair's best film outside France.  The screenplay by Dudley Nichols was excellent in every way and the music by Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco only makes me wish he had contributed more wonderful scores for film.

We don't have here what, perhaps, some critics missed the most - an overbudgeted star-oriented show piece.  It was a quiet thriller, more European than American perhaps.  Again, that might have lost a vote or two.  This is the best Agatha Christie on film, close to its origins and, in this case, with delightful irony.

The murders and the corpses were never seen (maybe a vote or two lost here) but things were hinted at in ever ingenious ways throughout.  Actually, even the very beginning with all the characters on the boat going to the island was amazing - introducing every character, every idiosynchrasy silently!  The actors were superb,yes, and there were quite a few famous ones there although nobody overacted.

Clair was at his best and the movie is an understated classic and a total delight.

One thing that one should NEVER do is to compare it with the book. If you do this, you will feel nauseated with the treatment given to the classic Christie novel.

The director took a lot of unnecessary liberties with characters' names,  backgrounds, and above all the ending.

We would suggest reading the book as a lot of the characters internal thinking was important to the development of the mystery as well as for giving clues to the mysterious U. N. Owen. None of this is in the movie.

  The screen play by Dudley Nichols lifts Christie's rather grim tale to a fasinating mystery where bodies drop like flies over an increasingly long weekend as 10 potential victims wonder if they will still be alive come Monday morning!

  If you've ever read the original book or seen one of the other screen versions you may be surprised to find some humorous elements amongst the mayhem. Famous French director Rene Clair created a wonderful movie but then again he was working with a superb screen writer and a cast which included Barry Fitzgerald; Walter Huston; Louis Hayward (The Count of Monte Cristo); Roland Young (Topper); Sir Aubrey Smith and the great Judith Anderson who also played the sinister housekeeper Mrs. Danvers so brilliantly in ""Rebecca.""

911770,5,6304679661,"One of my favourite films, Ren Clair's AND THEN THERE WERE NONE (1945) is not only based on one of Agatha Christie's best novels, but it has a wonderful ""large house"" set, and a superb ""who's who"" ensemble cast.

Walter Huston is generally the hands-down favourite, but I also like Roland Young and Richard Haydn (the voice of the caterpillar in Disney's ALICE IN WONDERLAND).  The cast also includes Barry Fitzgerald, Mischa Auer, C. Aubrey Smith, and Judith Anderson, among others.

Clair fills the film with visual style, and the Dudley Nichols screenplay has some very good moments:

Emily Brent:  Very stupid to kill the only servant in the house. Now we don't even know where to find the marmalade.

Rogers (the Butler):  Never in my life have I been accused of any crime, sir - and if that's what you think of me, I shan't serve any dinner.
And my favourite:

Dr. Edward G. Armstrong:  No sane person would ever think of using seaweed as a pattern for a shawl!

Hence, this charming, old school black comedy is loosely based upon Agatha Christie's classic psychological mystery, in which a sinister, unseen predator plays out a children's nursery rhyme, ""Ten Little Indians,"" eliminating his/her now-marooned prey one by one.  Over the course of a long weekend, ten seemingly normal people become doomed by their own dark secrets.  The novel's grim British title, ""And Then There Were None,"" proves utterly fitting, with a catch, of course.  As you will discover, this 1945 Hollywood ""B"" movie gem reflects Ms. Christie's surprisingly breezy stage adaptation, in which some comic mischief livens up the macabre storyline making it consistent with the stage play's alternate ending.

Starring are some superb, older character actors: Oscar winners Barry Fitzgerald as the tortoise-like Judge Quincannon and Walter Huston as the sleazy Dr. Armstrong; as well as Judith Anderson as the self-righteous spinster, Emily Brent.  The romantic leads are charismatic Louis Hayward as nonchalant mercenary Phillip Lombard and June Duprez as willowy Vera Claythorne.  Among the other actors, most memorable is probably Mischa Auer's drunken Prince Nikita Starlov (aka the novel's Anthony Marston), whose sole occupation, as Auer amusedly puts it, is a ""professional guest.""

Ultimately, this movie is a wonderful mystery cocktail.  Timeless black & white suspense, a campy musical score, and witty dialogue (often initiated by the amiable Hayward) seamlessly blend into a well-balanced package of first class entertainment.  The bottom line for viewers, we think, is that this film still retains the vital element of surprise, unlike its horde of tired remakes.  Without prior knowledge of its conclusion, most viewers should clearly be baffled by the dwindling number of suspects and no tangible solution in sight.  Though the upbeat final few seconds may ring false, it's still a classic Hollywood ending for a film truly worth re-discovering nearly seventy years later.

As they form small alliances, and finally come to the conclusion it is one of those among them who is eliminating the others, it's splendid fun. Rather than being dark or morbid, or even nail biting, Clair infuses Christie's story with a sense of mischief and mystery fun, as those remaining seem to be aware of the viewer at times. Striking visual touches from photographer Lucien Andriot lend both atmosphere and beauty to the setting and story.

There is a fabulous cast of film veterans along for the ride who play this just right. They include: Walter Huston, Barry Fitzgerald, C. Aubrey Smith, Louis Hayward, Roland Young, Judith Anderson, Mischa Auer, and lovely June Duprez. To get into specifics might give too much away, and you'll have tons of fun trying to figure out who the killer is, and who will be around to catch him! Toss in a bit of romance and a twist at the end and you have a delightful time at the movies. A classy mystery perfect for a rainy night.

If you didn't know any of these actors, the movie would be ""fair"" at best. You can bet if the story were re-done today, it would be faster moving. As it stands, its okay but a film in which 10 people are invited to an island and are systematically murdered one by one, should make for a tense thriller. Here, it's more of a study in paranoia, but that's interesting to view, too.

I especially enjoy watching Walter Huston and Barry Fitzgerald banter back-and-forth and I was glad to see the most annoying character (can't say) be done with first!

Directed by Rene Clair and containing an all-star cast, this film should be a truly excellent thriller; unfortunately, this screen play is a terrible adaptation of Ms. Christie's stellar novel.  The dialogue is awkward and stilted, the suspense never really builds, and the ending is utterly predictable.

As the story goes, eight people, a butler, and a housekeeper are invited by a Mr. U. N. Owen to spend a weekend at a mansion on a barren island somewhere off the English coast. Each person has in some way been responsible for a death, and these sins have gone unpunished...until now. One by one, the 10 individuals are each killed in a manner consistent with the nursery rhyme, Ten Little Indians.  This excellent cast of well-known character actors and actresses is lead by Barry Fitzgerald, Walter Huston, Judith Anderson, and C. Aubrey Smith.  As the characters in this film attempt to identify their murderer, they eventually come to the conclusion that it must be one of them, since they are the only people on the otherwise deserted island.  The mistrust and suspicion then kick into full swing.  At the unsatisfactory end of the film, the identity of the murder and his reasons for killing are a real let down.

This film starts with all of the ingredients to be a winner:  a known director, well loved actors, not to mention a brilliant story.  Unfortunately, once the dreadful screen play is mixed in, the ingredients all curdle, and the over all result is extremely unpalatable.",1218240000,7,1660,4.875444839857651

911840,2,6304679661,"I have to say ""And Then There Were None"" with this great cast and Rene Clair just doesn't measure up.  The script is decent with a name change of one character - from movie star to Prince - and it does have a happy ending that the book doesn't have.  Louis Hayward is a good actor, but does very little with his role as Lombard.  Walter Huston does not make a believable Dr. Armstrong.  And as good as Judy Deprez is in the ""Four Feathers"" and ""The Thief of Bagdad"", she is also not as believable here as Vera Claythorne either.  Same for C. Aubrey Smith and Judith Anderson.  Richard Haydn are better actors, but there really don't get to do much here. There is a lot going on inside these charcters, but the looks between them, the fear, the angers, the suspision just doesn't register.  It's more a by the numbers plot.  This has been redone many times in other films and TV shows.  The One from The Avengers in ""The Superlative Seven"" is great fun.

But mostly the direction of Rene Clair is not up to one of my all time favorite films by Rene Clair:""I Married a Witch"" - superb, by the by.  This is a puzzle and a mystery with a serious situation and real murder.  The First murder was a Hollywood death with all the trimmings.  For the most part other murders happen off the screen, so it does not set up very well.

I have never liked other film versions, but I had very fond memories of this one.  I am deeply diappointed.

Now one more thing.  I have a very inexpensive  Phillips DVD Player.  When I owned a Expensive DVD Player, not every DVD worked - and I had lots of headaches with DVDs I produced for business.  Then I bought this one for $60 - the low end Phillips and it's played everything I put in it.  When I heard there was some fuzzy images at the beginning and unstable playing, I figured for $5.99, I could live with that.  So It comes as a total surprise - and I shouldn't be, but I am - that this DVD was sharp and steady from the opening FBI until the very last frame.  What anyone who orders this DVD should remember is that the best quality DVD may look better in a cheaper more up to date DVD Player and work better than the older, more expensive DVD Player with all the bells and whistles,",1214352000,2,2219,4.206161137440758

There are no blemishes as flickers, specks and faded pictures, the b/w-contrast is very good, the sound of course very mono, the background music rather too loud, and the wide-angle takes could be sharper.

The suspense is really good, and it's actually a very witty movie. One would think that it would be hard to laugh at a movie that has several murders in it, but you will find yourself doing just that on more than one occasion.

While there are no Clark Gable or Cary Grant-level stars in this, if you like old movies you will recognize almost everyone. It has many character actors that do a great job overall. In reality, I would say the only weak spot about this movie is the fact that the quality of the sound and picture isn't very good. It is an old movie that has not been remastered, so it is slightly distracting on that level at times. Overall, though, the quality of the movie itself removes those concerns.

As for the extras on this DVD, I laughed out loud at a couple of them. They are quite ridiculous, really, but very, very amusing.  One of the extras is a movie quiz about ""And Then There Were None."" There are about five questions that are really easy multiple choice questions. The amusing part comes when you get one wrong!

At least the humor here works a little better than the '65 version.

I'm told that this version, as well as the '65 version, heavily rely on the stage adaptation of the Christie novel, the origin of the more upbeat conclusion.  Apparently, the thinking was that- unlike the book- one or two characters had to remain alive at the end to explain things to the audience.  I don't know... I think I could figure out several ways to dramatize the original novel without softening the proceedings.  But maybe I'm just a morbid person and grumble at happy endings.

Storywise, this '45 film and the '65 film not only rely on the same ending, but- for the most part- they feature the same exact story beats, making one wonder why the '65 version was even made. It certainly didn't attempt anything new (besides casting hip actors and employing an out-of-place ""mod"" jazz score).  Though, admittedly, Shirley Eaton was more fetching than any of the actresses on display here.

Anyway, enough with my meandering thoughts about this or that adaptation.  With its nice sets, solid direction, and bevy of old English acting pros, this particular movie is certainly worth a look, and so is the '65 version (though marginally less so).

From the first blustery scene you are almost required to huddle in a blanket with a cup of tea and shortbread.

A small boat of guests who are not acquainted with each other arrives on wild, salty waves. We are introduced to the selection of victims. Thomas the butler has been instructed by letter from their unseen host, a Mr. Owen, to play a record as the weekend visitors partake of wine after their first dinner. They are shocked by what is broadcast. Their host has declared them all to be killers.

Judith Anderson is aloof, composed, but outstanding as the knitting fiend Emily Brent (she is mysteriously chilly in Rebecca). Those interested in vintage knitting styles will be studying her eyelet shawl and fitted cardigan. On the boat she is buttoned up in a sturdy houndstooth coat. Atop her upswept hairdo is secured a brimless hat decorated with spikes of feathers; reminisent of a Victorian velvet creation. We see her later seated in the courtyard, knitting casually. She pauses to remove binoculars from her knitting bag and studies the other guests who are deep in thought as they ramble along the water's edge. Members of the invited group are being deleted in a precise manner. Who is guilty? Indeed, who isn't? The torrid weather plays host to their uneasiness.

Another murder has been discovered and Emily, who has been for an early morning stroll along the beach, calmly walks through the windy entrance holding up a lacy hank of seaweed to the astonished guests. Nonchalently she greets them. ""Good morning. Oh it's such a pretty pattern. I thought I'd like to copy it for a new shawl.""

""I wouldn't have gone out alone"" warns the judge.

I watched this black and white 1945 movie (whose New York premiere was on Halloween day) of almost 100 minutes without first reading the novel that it is based on.  I'm glad I did this!  Why?  Because I was forced to really watch the movie in order to deduce who the murderer was.

According to the opening credits, this movie is ""based on the [1939] novel [of the same name] by [Dame] Agatha Christie"" (1890 to 1976).  However, this is not quite accurate.  This movie is really based on the play version of this book that has a slightly different ending than the book.  (Note: In America, this novel is known as ""Ten Little Indians."")

As a synopsis, ten strangers are invited as weekend guests to the only mansion located on an isolated island.  When the host, with the unusual name of ""U.N. Owen"" and his wife don't show up, the guests start dying, one by one, according to the lines in the children's poem entitled ""Ten Little Indians.""  These guests and the viewer are constantly reminded of the body count as each of the ten figures on a ceramic display are secretly broken, one by one, directly after a murder is committed.

What I did was obtain a copy of this poem.  (You can easily get a copy from the internet.)  I found that doing so added to my enjoyment of the movie.

Who exactly are these ten strangers?  They are as follows (in the order in which they are killed):

1. Russian Prince Starloff (Mischa Auer)
2. Maid Rogers (Queenie Leonard)
3. Retired General Mandrake (Sir C. Aubrey Smith)
4. Butler Rogers (Richard Haydn)
5. Spinster (?) Brent (Dame Judith Anderson)
6. Judge Quinncannon (Barry Fitzgerald)
7. Dr. Armstrong (Walter Huston)
8. Detective Bloor (Roland Young)
9. Explorer Lombard (Louis Hayward)
10. Secretary Claythorne (June Duprez)

The above cast does a stellar job in their roles.  They make the movie come across not only as a mystery but also as a black comedy (thanks to a well-crafted script).  Personally, I think the actor who portrayed the butler did the best job.

As the murders begin to occur, the guests realize that there is a person acting as ""judge, jury, and executioner.""  And that person, they surmise, is Mr. Owen.  Suspense is created when these guests (and the viewer) start asking themselves questions:

(1) Is Owen hiding in the mansion killing them one by one?
(2) Is Owen one of them?  That is, is the ""loose cannon"" one of them?
(3) (Is Owen the boatman that drove them from the mainland to the island?)

The black and white gives the movie a claustrophobic feeling (adding another dimension to this movie).  The cinematography is breathtaking.  The main background music for this movie is unique, something I did not expect.

I thought this movie was a little rushed at the beginning.  However, it slowed down as it progressed.

Finally, the DVD (the one distributed by the studio Image Entertainment) has just one extra.  Even though it lasts less than two minutes, it is VERY interesting.

In conclusion, this is a fun movie, even if you have read the book it's based on!!

One would have to have lived one's life in a cave not to have heard of the story behind this film, based, as it is, on arguably Agatha Christie's most famous novel.  Thankfully, the original title has long since been changed from the inconceivably offensive TEN LITTLE N*GGERS to TEN LITTLE INDIANS (Agatha, what were you thinking?).  Actually, there have been a vast number of permutations of the story in various films, both explicitly based on Christie's story, or only derived from it in some fashion or other.
Ten individuals are mysteriously invited to a mansion that sits alone on an isolated island, all with a dark secret to hide.  Mysteriously, one after another dies a mysterious death.  The plot is excruciatingly simple; the execution by director Rene Clair is phenomenal.
The cast is superb though despite the absence of any leading performers.  Louis Hayward is the ostensible lead, but his career was largely that of a supporting player.  What the film has instead is a collection of absolutely first-rate character actors.  The great Walter Huston (who would win a Best Supporting Actor Oscar three years later in his son's THE TREASURE OF SIERRA MADRE) steals many of the scenes he is in, but one of the talents of a great character actor lies in scene theft.  Barry Fitzgerald robs a few of his own, as does the brilliant Mischa Auer, whose early demise robs him of the opportunity for additional larceny.  Roland Young was one of the greatest character actors of the thirties, and although he made other films after this one before his death in 1953, this was probably his last great role.  I love the vastly underappreciated Richard Haydn, who always looked decades older than he was (only 40 in this film) and who never starred in a film but managed to embellish a large number, my favorite being, perhaps, BALL OF FIRE, where he played Prof. Oddly, the expert on botany (who gives an hysterical account about the birds and the bees).  In this film he plays the Butler.
One could make the case that this is one of the most influential films ever made.  Parts of the plot have been borrowed for countless other films, but in my opinion, none managed it more successfully than this one.  A must see film.",1065312000,5,2436,4.661214953271028

The extras on this bargain disc are fun: ten minutes of movie bloopers, a newsreel and a cartoon from the 40s. Just like a Saturday afternoon at the Bijou.

One night a mysterious record accuses each guest murdered someone long ago. Although they try to prove tier innocence, thier mysterious host ""Mr. Owen"" has found a great deal about them.

Though some may be discouraged due to the fact that the movie is in black and white, it does not detract from the enjoyment of the movie. Also, the film short ""Twin Husbands"" (Included on the DVD) is hilarious, and certainly should not be overlooked. On a note of caution, though, if you're planning to read the book, I suggest you read it before watching the movie, as both the movie and the book reveal the same culprit, which may ruin the ending of the book for you.

Many age groups, inculding my 4-year old sister, were allowed to view the movie. The combanation with the poem is very sleak. The deaths go along with the poem, making the movie very accurate. The characters all have pretty much the same roles as in the book. The movie tends to be very high-paced during the first parts.
Some characters die within five minutes of each other. As the book rolls to an end, the pace slows down. The movie gives a ""Survival of the fittest"" feeling. The whole movie is like one series of ""the mole"", with everyone trying to uncover the villian.
The overall conclusion: And then there were none was a great movie, with lots of tradegy and overall loss. without showing the bloody sceens, And then there were none is a 5- star classic, a good movie for the whole family to watch.",1035417600,4,1048,4.492146596858639

Indeed, given that the film turns the mystery on a comic edge, I feel that retaining the book's original ending would have destroyed the film's own internal consistency.

912122,5,6304679661,"Anyone looking for an explanation of directorial touch should view this movie. It's a crackling good mystery, heightened by Director Rene Clair's exquisitely light comedic touch. The cast responds very capably with subtle tongue-in-cheek (watch Louis Hayward's many priceless expressions, or Walter Huston's slyly oafish doctor) without overdoing it. Oddly, the lighter undercurrent intensifies the suspense by making each suspect in a houseful of suspects an unlikely candidate for murder. Pacing, art direction, and crashing waves, are all expertly blended with other ingredients to produce this classic version of the much reprised Agatha Christie novel. Moreover, the movie remains an enduring testament to the artistic talents of French film-maker Clair, whose American sojourn, as the film demonstrates, was much too brief. Somehow too, I get the feeling that in Clair's touch is a movie Hitchcock would like to have made were he not so preccupied with the darkly psychological side of murder. Anyway, as the many leaden and pointless remakes have proven, this version is truly one of a kind, so don't miss it.",1023926400,,1116,5.419540229885057
912123,4,6304679661,"In this adaptation of Agatha Christie's classic novel, ten people are ferried over to Indian Island, all invited as guests of a mysterious U.N. Owen.  They are greeted by the staff, Mr. and Mrs. Rogers, and after dinner, they hear a voice accusing each of them of murder and sentencing them to death.  ""Prisoners at the bar, do you have anything to say in your defense?""
The voice turns out to be a grammophone recording (LP to those of you who want contemporary terms).  The label on the record reads ""Swan Song.""  How apropos, considering what happens during the course of the movie.
Also in this house are a ringed sculpture of ten little Indians, which reminds one of the guests of the nursery rhyme of the same name.  The upbeat and carefree Prince Nikita 'Nikki' Starloff, who was singing and playing the nursery rhyme on the piano, says, ""I am all for crime!  Here's to crime!""  He downs his drink, and immediately collapses.  ""Just plain drunk,"" says Blore the detective.  To which Dr. Armstrong replies, ""Just plain dead.""  And he's just the first of many.
The killings correspond to the rhyme, beginning with ""Ten little Indians boys went out to dine, one choked his little self, and then there were nine.""  ""Nine little Indians boys sat up very late, one overslept himself and then there were eight.""  And so on, until, ""One little Indian, left all alone, he went and hanged himself, and then there were none.""
After each victim has been killed, one of the Indian statues is broken off and missing.
It is after the third victim, General Mandrake, is stabbed with a knife, that they realize that the previous two deaths were murders, and that Mr. U.N. Owen (read, unknown) is one of them!
Furthering their plight is that they are completely cut off.  There are no phones, and the boat that dropped them off comes once every two weeks.  The remaining survivors try to keep themselves alive, remembering the nursery rhyme, sticking together, forming alliances, and distrusting one another, but to no avail.  In one scene, pairs look at one and indicate their choice of the suspect with a nod, or shake their head in disagreement at their colleague's choice.
Three of the characters names have been changed.  In the movie, Anthony Marston is Nikita Starloff, General MacArthur is General Mandrake, and Justice Wargrave is Judge Quincannon.  Minor changes.  Everybody else's name conforms to the novel.  I wonder if the reason the general's name was changed from the original was due to possible associations to a certain American general currently in the Pacific Theatre during World War II.  After all, this movie was made in 1945.
The casting is top-notch, though, with everyone's personalities coming through without being cardboard, with Louis Hayward (Lombard), Mischa Auer (Starloff), Roland Young (Blore), and Barry Fitzgerald (Quincannon) in particular shining.  And Richard Haydn plays Mr. Rogers as a ridiculous, toffee-nosed twit with a voice to match his character.
There have been other versions of this classic Agatha Christie story, and while this is the best of the lot in terms of the location, sequence of events, etc. the denouement does not accurately follow that of the book, which would have made it perfect.  The book's ending was what made the story a classic, and none of the future adaptations, be it the 1966, 1975, or 1989 versions, conformed to the classic ending.  How frustrating!",1019260800,,3418,4.906086956521739

912155,4,6304679661,"Agatha Christie's 1930s novel AND THEN THERE WERE NONE told the story of ten unrelated people who are lured under various pretexts to an island resort; once assembled, they discover they have been brought to the island by a mysterious homocidal maniac who accuses each of them of having escaped punishment for a past murder--and who then proceeds to pick them off one by one as the ever dwindling party rushes to unmask the hidden killer in their midst.  Nothing like the novel had been seen before, and it was a popular sensation.  So much so that Christie herself adapted the novel to the stage.  In creating the script, Christie discovered that the novel's uncompromising tone and shocking conclusion did not translate well to the stage, and the final script was considerably lighter and had a considerably softer conclusion.  When performed, the script was played as much for comedy as for suspense--and proved as popular as the novel.  A film version became inevitable.

Countless novels, plays, and movies have borrowed the premise Christie presents in AND THEN THERE NONE, and there have been at least four film versions (most often known as TEN LITTLE INDIANS) of the original work.  All of these versions rely more upon the play script than the novel, offering a mix of comedy and suspense, and by far and away the best of them is famed French director Rene Clair's 1940s version.  Brilliantly played by an ensemble cast of famed character actors including Judith Anderson, Barry Fitzgerald, Walter Huston, C. Aubrey Smith, and Roland Young, Clair creates a stylish, somewhat surrealistic romp that satirizes British ""stiff upper lip"" sensibilities with florishes of black comedy while quietly building a sense of increasing unease.  From a modern standpoint, the Clair version seems more comic than suspensful; few will find it in the least unnerving.  This does not, however, change the fact that it is a tremendous amount of fun to watch.  The film creates an air of old-fashioned mischief that is compulsively enjoyable, and even if a contemporary director decided to have another go at the material it seems unlikely that any cast to equal this could be assembled.  If you're prepared for a witty amusement, AND THEN THERE WERE NONE is recommended.

I don't usually comment on the quality of DVDs unless there is a glaring issue--but since there are several DVD versions of this film, and some have been poorly reviewed, I will specify that I purchased the VCI edition.  (The cover of this particular edition is yellow with the faces of the characters appearing in a V-shaped ""wedge."")  When the DVD began to play, the VCI logo was very distorted; when the DVD changed over to the menu, however, the picture became stable.  When I ran the movie, I found the titles had a bit of a flicker, but this quickly vanished; as for overall quality, the picture and sound quality are rather poor as the movie begins but quickly corrects to an acceptable--although not excellent--level.

Ten people are invited to an island, and murders that seem to be inspired by a nursery rhyme ensue.  One of Agatha Christie's most famous whodunits, ""And Then There Were None"", was adapted into one of the best whodunits on film, directed in 1945 by the great Ren Clair, who also directed comedy classics such as ""I Married a Witch"", "" nous la libert"", and ""Le Million"".  This suspenseful and occasionally humourous film is no doubt on the most-favorite lists of many people.  But sadly the new 2013 Blu-ray & DVD editions from VCI do not do it justice.  Hence, the best-looking and sounding edition remains the  Image DVD edition from way back in 2001.

VCI claims that a brand-new restoration has been done for their new discs, and that seems to be true.  Their new Blu-ray & DVD do look pretty clean, and are the cleanest-looking editions currently.  But sadly, the source print itself is far from ideal.  It has a significant lack of sharpness and details to the point that watching the Blu-ray seems like watching a DVD.  See my comment section below for a link to a comparison between the VCI Blu-ray and Image DVD.  It shows the Blu-ray doesn't gain any significant improvement in sharpness and details the way a Blu-ray should.  Note that the VCI picture is cropped pretty significantly on all four sides of the image compared to the Image DVD.

The 2.0 mono soundtrack on the VCI Blu-ray and DVD is lossless, but it also lacks in quality just like the picture.  It has less clarity and more distortion compared to the fine 1.0 mono track of the Image DVD.

One positve thing about the 2013 VCI discs is that they come with optional English subtitles for the hearing impaired, and also an audio description track for the visually impaired.  All other discs include neither.  The new VCI discs don't have any other supplements, however.

If you already have the Image DVD, save your money.  If you don't, and if you must have the best video and audio quality, get the Image DVD.  If you must have subtitles, only the new VCI Blu-ray or DVD offer that.

If you are interested in Amazon's instant video version of the film, rest assured that it uses the same print as the Image DVD.

See my original 2001 review below of the Image DVD and other less desirable DVD editions.

*** ORIGINAL REVIEW, WRITTEN, NOV-26-2001 ***

The new Image DVD version of AND THEN THERE WERE NONE is a vast improvement in video/audio quality over previous DVD releases by VCI in 1999 and Madacy in 2001.  All three versions are currently available at Amazon, so be sure to check the technical info page for each disc to see which company makes it.

The video transfer on the Image DVD, said to be made from ""original elements"", is much, much sharper and more detailed than that on the VCI and Madacy versions.  It also shows a little more picture on all four sides of the screen.  The picture looks somewhat battered during the opening credits, but it looks great the rest of the way.  There is a slight amount of graininess and other blemishes throughout, but it is not detrimental.  I'm especially impressed with the scenes that take place in the dark, in which some of the background details, such as engravings on the wall, the subtle lights and shadows, etc., can be seen with much greater clarity.  The VCI disc, conversely, looks much less sharp, and the Madacy disc even less so.

The monophonic audio tracks on the VCI and Madacy discs are louder but have more noise compared to that on the Image disc.  The problem of the dialogs not being synchronized properly on the VCI and Madacy discs has also been fixed on the Image disc.

The Image disc has one extra: the film's British opening credit sequence, which uses the deplorably offensive title ""Ten Little N******"" (which is also Agatha Christie's original title for her whodunnit).  The sequence is preceded with an  explanation of its use so the viewer has the historical context in mind.  The VCI disc has a biography section on the filmmakers and the 1946 comedy short TWIN HUSBANDS, starring Leon Errol.  The Madacy disc has a 9-minute newsreel footage from 1945, a 12-minute blooper footage (of OTHER films), 3 screenshots of lobby cards, and a trivia quiz section.  All three discs are region-free and without subtitles or closed captioning.",1006732800,376,4322,4.680371352785146

However, there are a few flaws. Many have said that the ending is the same as the play's ending, rather than the book's. That's not true. The ending, while similar to the play ending, is at the same time very different, and much less exciting. Other flaws include the difference in Vera Claythorne's murder: in the book and play, the accusation was that she murdered a young boy to which she was a nursery governess. In the movie, she's accused of murdering her sister's fiance. While not a big difference, it does change a few things. The biggest flaw, though, in my opinion, can be summed up in two words: Charles Morley. To say any more would give away a few things.
The only extras are the ""classic comedy short 'Twin Husbands.'"" While it's a very odd match for ""And Then There Were None,"" it's rather funny. There are also talent files for four of the actors and Rene Clair.
All in all an enjoyable picture. While the flaws are bothersome, they aren't enough to ruin the movie. I would highly reccomend this DVD to any Agatha Christie fan.",982108800,8,1215,4.428571428571429

The ending was not just a ""slight twist"", but a total betrayal of Christie's clever and meticulously crafted work.  It's like touting a film of ""Gone With the Wind"" which ends with Melanie not dying, and Ashley devoting himself to her forever while Rhett and Scarlett ride off blissfully into the sunset.  Or ""Wuthering Heights"" in which Cathy recovers, leaves Linton to live happily ever after with Heathcliff.  Or Romeo performing resuscitative measures on Juliet, bringing her back to life, and ending with all familial conflicts resolved and everyone toasting the young couple's happiness at their marriage.  You get the picture.

My gripe lies with filmmakers appropriating someone else's work, and fame, and reputation, to bolster what they obviously could not accomplish themselves.  They take the lazy way of using a story written by someone else, but then feel free to corrupt it at will, all the while relying on the established reputation of that talented author to draw in viewers.  It's a loathsome practice in my book.

Putting aside the execrable ending, the overall film is no better than thousands already out there.  There is nothing so superlative about it to raise it beyond your typical well-made film.  It's just your average piece of decent filmmaking circa 1945.  Were there anything exceptional about it, I might have rated it higher.
