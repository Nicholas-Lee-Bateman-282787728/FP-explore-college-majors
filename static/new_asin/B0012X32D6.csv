8326044,4,B0012X32D6,"After viewing this movie, I saw the domination of the female actors.
The movie is a psychological thriller. One must understand first, what the purpose of the victim's amnesia was and how it linked to the outcome of the story. The fight scenes were futuristic in nature.",1233446400,2,270,4.76595744680851
8326045,1,B0012X32D6,"There isn't much for me to say about this movie. It made no sense to me. It was poorly written. Did not enjoy it at all, except to see David Anders. If you are a very, very big fan of his this might be worth the money but I suggest renting it if you can.",1213660800,,254,3.6363636363636362
