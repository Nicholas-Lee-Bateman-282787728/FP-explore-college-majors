8016922,5,B0001WJ5QW,"Clay Jenkinson  is dear to me and I enjoy his success.  I have all his books and have not been disappointed in a single one.  He makes the whole experience of Lewis and Clarke come to life for me.  I can't imagine the suffering of a trip such as theirs without a Safeway, a drug store, a place to pick up a bit of bourbon.  They must have been in constant need of things we take for granted.  Yet, they went on.  What an amazing story.",1377475200,3,435,3.988372093023256
8016923,2,B0001WJ5QW,I found this local TV produced television series rather hard to watch and at times much to elementary with regard to the Corps of Discovery.  Would not purchase again or new second in series.,1190073600,,191,4.617647058823529
8016924,5,B0001WJ5QW,Great DVD that I found be very informative and well worth the price. Even with other volumes on the way this DVD stands on its own when it comes to exploring the vast number of things that went into the planning of the expedition. Highly educational!,1085529600,9,250,4.456521739130435
