5931690,2,B00EOMJB1O,not good. just poll results but no evidence to debunk or uphold the public opinion. was hoping for more from the history channel,1385251200,10,128,4.608695652173913
5931691,2,B00EOMJB1O,"This presentation is not what it claims to be from what I viewed on the History Channel. What it does is have a handful of veteran researchers who have actually done their homework on the JFK Assassination such as Robert Groeden who to date has been ticketed and harassed  over 80 times by Dallas Police and the SIxth Floor Muesum for selling his take on the case against media establishment authors such as plagerist Gerald Posner and John McAdams.

The content deals with just about all the conspiracies surrounding the Assassination from UFOs, The Federal Reserve, Vatican, CIA, The Mob. Each is given a poll of who the American people think were involved, removing Lee Oswald from the case entirely.

The result is a very distorted and incoherent mess of a presentation. With surprise a majority of Americans saying we will never know the truth of the case. Hmmmm.....

Does that imply that we can't be sure of what happened in the past? If I we can't be sure of what happened to JFK, than I can argue that you can't even be sure what high school you actually attended, who your first crush was, or what kind of job you had in the recent past.

Is 50 years really that long? Could it be possible that the same people who were responsible, are the ones  still controlling the message five decades after the fact?

The programs contents don't present much evidence that support each  different conspiracy effectively.

With so many theories presented to the viewer you have to consider, why do the people who believe in the lone gunman get more to explain each conspiracy with many more sound bites and air time than any of the others?

If one really wants to know the truth about the JFK assassination, what is TRUELY required is that one actually START READING actual physical 600 page long books. i",1385251200,18,1803,4.6415094339622645

8607550,1,B00EOMJB1O,"Seriously!?

Not including the names Posner and Bugliosi as contributors is like leaving out the name Michael Chrichton on a Jurrasic Park DVD.

C'mon Amazon.com! This happens way too much! Too many media titles and Kindle book listings are deficient of essential information. We need original publication dates and names of major contributors.

Posner and Bugliosi are strangers to logic and evidence. They make unsupported conclusions conjured out of thin air.

Read Mark Lane's ""Rush to Judgment"" and ""Plausible Denial"" if you want the actual Definitive Guide to the JFK Assassination.",1418515200,5,588,5.428571428571429
8607551,1,B00EOMJB1O,"As the DVD progresses, you hear more comments from Vince Bugliosi and Gerald Posner, both advocates of the Warren Commission conclusion. Completely missing is the testimony from Charles A. Crenshaw, a third year resident at Parkland Hospital in the trauma ward when JFK was wheeled in.  His book is ""JFK Has Been Shot"", a must read.  He says clearly, that the two shots they could been see, the throat and head were from the front.  He wrote this book with the first title ""A Conspiracy of Silence"" in 1992 after seeing the autopsy photographs of JFK taken in Washington after the body had been taken out of Parkland, against Texas Law, by GUNPOINT....automatic weapons, ordered by Johnson.  The autopsy photographs taken of JFK showed a head put back together and the front throat wound gouged out to make it look like an exit rather than an entry wound.
They completely left out vast amounts of character information about Johnson, how he stole elections and how he has been implicated in SIX HOMOCIDES before he became President.  In Johnson's Texas, it was Bubba Justice - they owned Judges, representatives, lawyers, sheriffs, marshals and coroners.  One homocide was Henry Marshal  of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration investigating Johnson's business associate Billy Sol Estes. Marshall was found dead on his ranch with five bullets in his body.  The murder weapon was found close by: a bolt action .22 rifle. The official cause of death was ""suicide"". it was claimed by the coroner that Marshall had shot himself with the .22 rifle, then reloaded, five times in a row, until he was dead.  This comes from Barr McClellan's book, ""Blood, Money and Power: How LBJ Killed JFK"".  McClellan was one of Johnson's early attorneys who knew and worked with the insider team for years: He is also the father of Scott McClellan, W. Bush's press secretary.  The DVD also fails to include the analysis on the rifle and scope used by Oswald, also a bolt action Italian Army  Mannlicher-Carcano rifle designed in 1891. The scope was useless when first used in the simulation shots and had to be rebuilt. All simulation tests were done on stationary targets because the rifle could not follow a moving car with any accuracy.  Finally, they left out the fact that Jack Ruby had many friends in the Dallas Police Dept and could walk the halls without escort.  He let himself in the front door, when down to the parking garage unescorted and shot Oswald...a friend of the police...he bought them a lot of drinks.
This is claimed to be a ""Definitive Guide"" but is completely the opposite - an entrenchment of the Warren Commission findings of the ""Lone Assassin"" Theory.",1402963200,,2666,4.882483370288249
8607552,1,B00EOMJB1O,"I was shocked to see that one of the main ""stars"" of this History Channel broadcast is Gerald Posner. A writer for my own humble blog was the person who painstakingly exposed Gerry Posner's serial plagiarism. That exposure basically ended Gerry's career. Since Posner doesn't do his own writing, one must ask: Who REALLY wrote ""Case Closed,"" his much-ballyhooed (and highly deceptive) ""solution"" to the JFK mystery? The book's plywood-flat prose style suggests committee work.

Since that book came out, it has been pretty thoroughly established that Posner has all sorts of links to American intelligence. To prove the point, just hit Google, type in his name plus the words ""intelligence sources"" in quotes.

However, Gerry does have his fans -- mostly people like Daniel Pipes and the other neocons who got us into the Iraq war. Hey, if you can't trust THEM, who CAN you trust?

So in 2009, Gerry admits to a crowd -- and these are his exact words -- ""I'm a thieving c*********."" His rep was in ruins and he looked ready to weep. Yet here he is in 2013, at it again.

There are some vampires that can't be staked.

As for Bugliosi (another ""star"" of this show): He didn't even write the JFK assassination book bearing his name. The man is a sham -- always has been. When we Californians learned the truth about him, we soundly rejected his bids for higher office.

Bugliosi made his rep as the prosecutor who made the case against the Manson family. So what? Was it really that freakin' hard to prosecute a gang that included a drugged-out hippie chick who bragged about the murders to people she didn't know? A gang whose leader carved a swastika in his forehead? Bugliosi was not even the lead prosecutor on that case, despite what most people think. (And Curt Gentry was the primary writer on ""Helter Skelter."" A friend of mine knew Gentry when that book was written.)

Jim DiEugenio has written excellent book-length refutation of Bugliosi's work. There have been many debunkings of Posner over the years. Yet these are the trashy authors that the History Channel has relied upon.",1399161600,3,2087,4.7645429362880884

  This product met all of my expectations because I had already seen it beforehand on the History channel. I thought it was well put together for a documentary of that sort and made you think about the Kennedy  assassination from a different perspective or perspectives. That maybe we haven't been told the whole truth. I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in the Kennedy assassination Incident. Thank you.",1390953600,5,432,5.128571428571429

8607556,2,B00EOMJB1O,"WARNING..this dvd incudes Gerald Posner giving the CIA/FBI mantra of Oswald did it,case closed. The History Channel have tried
to see what Americans think about JFK assassination by using the results of various polls on the subject. The trouble is if you don't ask the right questions then results will always be flawed. To give an example how many Americans know that the limo
windshield had a bullet hole through it and the frame support for the bubble top also had a bullet hole in it? Evidence for
both of these has been around for decades but you won't hear Posner try to disprove it. If this poll had mentioned these two
facts then the single shooter theory becomes impossible and Arlen Specter made to look even more foolish than he already does.
The History Channel has made many dvds on JFK but this one only confuses watchers. Perhaps they should ask Americans if JFK
and L.H.Oswald's graves should be exhumed and tested with DNA?...that would really get the CIA/FBI worried.",1386115200,17,985,4.766081871345029
