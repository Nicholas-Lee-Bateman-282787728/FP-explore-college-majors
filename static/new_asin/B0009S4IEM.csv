Personal note: My consultation with Lance Armstrongs doctor led to my decision to have MY cancer operations handled at the same facility in Indianapolis as Lances. I thought that the experts that brought Lance back from deaths doorstep must know what they are doing. So far so good - for both of us. At that time, partly attributable to my several years of leading and participating in zillions of organized events and several solo tours in USA, Canada and throughout Europe, I sustained very positive feelings towards Lance and those of his caliber in extreme cycling, walking, and running events. I am STILL not ready throw him under the bus. Ive quite a library of books and media on his life and retain a strong interest in him.
Lance Armstrong did not have a perfect childhood. But thanks to his mother, Lance started EARLY to ride A LOT on his way to becoming the 1996 Number One Cyclist of the World, followed by a long list of extraordinary feats culminating in winning Tour de France seven years in a row:
1999 , 2000 , 2001 , 2002 , 2003 , 2004 , 2005 !

Those looking for perfect humans, will find that they are in short supply. Its really sad to learn of all the doping problems of so many heroes in organized bicycling as recently disclosed in more and more books and reports. Lance shares company with some of worlds finest riders in NOT riding clean without doping problems.

GIVE CREDIT WHERE DUE !  The Lifestrong Foundation has raised $500,000,000 !

PROBLEMS WITH AMAZON LISTING:
The DVD (I bought two of them) is described as published on 26 July 2005. This is two days after the 2005 Tour de France. Yet, alas, the DVD covers SOME highlights of Lance Armstrongs rise to fame taking the viewer up to the 2000 Tour de France.  ZERO information on what happened AFTER 2000. Publication DATE deceives one. No mention of what ultimately happened to this model family after Lance's 2003 divorce.

PROBLEMS WITH AMAZON REVIEWS:
System for handling reviews is a great service to the viewing and reading public. It provides much food for thought. Often, my initial reactions to an offering have been adequately covered by one or several other reviewers. But in this case not at all. In none of four reviews, no one even mentions the above AMAZON LISTING problems. See the  four 13 November 2015 , 26 December 2011 , 17 September 2009 , 26 June 2007 viewer reviews:
