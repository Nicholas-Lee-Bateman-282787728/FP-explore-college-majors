3144593,5,B0015FGCGK,"I'm very happy with my purchase. I have seen the movie before,  it is an old favorite so I knew I liked the movie, dated as it is it's still fun. It's nice to see so many people who would later become some of my favorite actors when they were young and virtually unknown.  The thing I was worried about was the quality of the DVD. I have occasionally purchased a DVD only to find that the quality of the picture is not good. I can say that the quality of this DVD is very good including close captioning.",1486512000,2,504,4.08080808080808
