1642143,5,B00005OW0E,"We have a 32"" TV and so I thought I'd give it a try in spite of the negative reviews that those with larger TVs gave it.  For this size and smaller it is great.  Good pictures and the main view lasts long enough that you don't get the feeling that it is simply repeating predictably like the ones I saw in the hospital waiting room.",1358208000,,332,4.015151515151516
1642144,5,B00005OW0E,Can't get enough of watching it when I do not want to watch tv or see a big blank screen in my den.  Very entertaining.,1354406400,,119,3.76
1642145,4,B00005OW0E,"This review is for the entire Aquaria collection. I would've given this set a 5 star rating if the entire collection was on 1 DVD like it said it was. But its not, its on 2 discs. So i was not able to play all 5 fish tanks in one long continuous loop like i wanted to. You could only play 3 of the tanks continuously like that, then you would have to put the other disc in to be able to play the other 2 tanks. That was disappointing because the set is touted as being all 5 tanks in 1 DVD. Now of all the tanks, my favorite is the Natural Aquarium. That one i feel has the most colorful variety of sea life. The other 4 tanks are not too bad either. Not awesome, but not anywhere near as bad as what a lot of these reviewers have said about them. Some of these reviews are downright mean and nasty. I frankly was very suprised at how much i ended up liking these tanks because i read most of the reviews before i bought it. Maybe they paid a whole lot more for their copies than what i did so that could be their issue. But for what i paid, which was one cent plus the 2.98 shipping, THIS IS A VERY GOOD PURCHASE. So for under 3 bucks total, i would say don't hesitate to buy it. And as of the date of this review, there are definately more copies available for the same price i paid. There are also individual copies of each of the 5 tanks available for that same price, but why buy 1 single fish tank DVD when you can get the whole 5 tank series in 1 collection for the same price?",1352937600,,1484,3.9335548172757475

1642147,1,B00005OW0E,Item never arrived.  Contacted seller.  Didn't do any good.  Never received money back.  Doesn't surprise me.  I've heard same comments from other buyers.  I had to rate this item at 1 star; didn't want to.  Had no choice.  Wouldn't let me get to the next screen.,1331769600,,263,4.565217391304348
1642148,4,B00005OW0E,"The aquarium collection was a great party favor(ite) for me.  I had a party with music, candles, wine and cheeses.  The hit of the evening were compliments on my ""42 inch"" flat screen aquarium.  Can't beat it for creating atmosphere inexpensively.",1330732800,,247,4.975609756097561
1642149,4,B00005OW0E,Purchased as ambient background DVD because people just can't seem to stop staring at televisions.  Seems to fit the purpose.  Item arrived on-time and in condition advertised.,1314230400,,176,5.481481481481482
1642150,1,B00005OW0E,You would have a more usable product if you were to film a friend's fish tank with your IPhone.  The colors are washed out and the quality is just above VHS.  I'm glad I only spent a few dollars on this DVD because that's definitely all it's worth.,1291075200,,248,4.145833333333333
1642151,5,B00005OW0E,I have an invalid mother and thought that this would be something she would enjoy watching that wouldn't require a lot of concentration and would be pretty and colorful. She lives in a rural farming community and hasn't been around many aquariums and this type of sea life. Both of us enjoy watching this video.,1262822400,,311,4.672727272727273
1642152,5,B00005OW0E,this video is excelent and i really love it and the dvd is really crystal clear and the color is really great too and it looks so realistic and its actually looks like a  real aquarium and the sounds of the bubbles sound so real too i really enjoy this video and the price is really great too it just looks so great on my 32 inch plasma tv ty so much.,1257120000,,351,3.875
1642153,3,B00005OW0E,Good DVD on Fish but I wish the DVD was in HD,1178928000,,45,2.8333333333333335
1642154,4,B00005OW0E,I very much enjoyed this DvD.  It was exactly what I expected and my children love it.  Very realistic.,1169078400,,103,4.368421052631579
1642155,5,B00005OW0E,I wish I had bought this set of aquariums in the first place.  When I watched it I could tell it was done by a professional company and put together by someone who really enjoyed aquariums.  This aquarium had a great diversity of wonderfully interesting fish.  The close up shots of the fish actually seemed to bring the viewer into the fishes world.  It was like the national geographic specials only better.  I would like to thank this company for their attention to detail lavished on this wonderfully produced set of aquarium DVD's.,1164499200,,536,4.720430107526882
1642156,4,B00005OW0E,This DVD is nothing more or nothing less than promised; a beautiful aquarium full of salt water fish and coral.  The background audio gives a choice of breaking waves or bubbles. One quick attempt to use it as a computer screensaver failed but did not give it a large effort as this is not what I purchased it for.  I have had good comments from several friends who saw it on my television in my RV while on vacation at the beach.,1151193600,,430,4.2317073170731705
1642157,2,B00005OW0E,"I had great expectations of this dvd as I have come to the conclusion that I won't be able to have my own salt water aquarium in the foreseeable future.  I was disappointed with it, I'm afraid to have to say.  Perhaps I have been spoiled by my local salt water aquaria ""petshop"" which has a very nice 1800 liter salt water aquaium with many live corals, anemones and tropical fish species. Now these dvds came out in 1999 and since the WMVHD ""Coral Reef Adventure"" came out, this dvd just cannot compete and doesn't have any of the color quality, focus, or detail that one could hope for.  The better of the various aquaria in my opinion is the ""The Classic Aquarium"" and ""The Fresh Water Aquarium"" so I would recommend just ordering the single dvd instead of the ""The Complete Aquarium DVD Collection"" if you absolutely need one to tide you over until when they start producing HD aquaria dvds.  I found both ""The Natural Aquarium"" and ""The Coral Reef Aquarium"" very disappointing with not-so-clear water, poor focus, unnatural colors, disappointing detail, and not very many different fish to look at.  I do like the idea of a loopable aquarium dvd and with the dawning of HD dvd, it shouldn't be all that difficult to produce a new and better series.  And I am sure there are many more beautiful aquaria to film - with more ""depth"" and content to them - than the ones used for this series.",1142812800,,1392,4.52589641434263
1642158,4,B00005OW0E,"I love this 2-set DVD - it's really like having an aquarium.  I'd recommend it to anyone.  Just a couple of things:  I can only select the bubble sound, the other options don't work.  Nor was I able to access any additional features via computer DVD drive - and I tried it on two different of my computers (a VPR Matrix and a HP Pavillion.)  But if you're not interested in the additional features and just want very lifelike, gorgeous colored, ample selection of aquariums to enjoy, you can't go wrong with this DVD collection.",1142208000,,528,4.515789473684211
1642159,2,B00005OW0E,"I am disappointed in Aquaria's The Coral Reef Aquarium in that the background lacks color and all the fish are small varieties, but those with fish know-how would probably find the setting ""correct"" and some aspects, swaying coral and little creatures would be interesting in a zoomed view.

 But I highly recommend Aquaria's Natural Aquarium. Lot's of color and diversity in the background and colorful fish of all shapes and sizes for those of us just wanting an aquarium. I like the sound tracks, but are they the same on all the ""Aquariums""? Strange.

 Big ""thumbs up"" for the ""Natural Aquarium"", but down for ""The Coral Reef"", unless you know what to expect.",1141257600,,663,4.84070796460177
1642160,1,B00005OW0E,"I just received and watched 'Aquaria' and am astounded that these people see fit to charge money for this trash!!! I recently had a high-end 50"" plasma / surround sound system installed and I thought Aquaria would be something like the impressive aquatic computer generated screen savers available today. What did I get? Some lousey, low-end video (no, not even filmed) of murkey fishtanks. Total ripoff!!! You'll have more fun watching wet towels dry. I would have given it no stars had it been an option!",1096243200,,506,4.895348837209302
1642161,3,B00005OW0E,"the grades I give for the 5 aquarium types are:

Classic: close-up 4 stars, wide 3 stars; Freshwater: close-up 3-4 stars, wide 2-3 stars; Coral Reef: close-up 4 stars, wide 2 stars; Natural: close-up 2-3 stars, wide 1-2 stars; Exotic: close-up 2-3 stars, wide 0-1 star

The playing time (of each aquarium) of close-ups is 7-8 minutes (should've been longer). The wide shots playing time is 25-27 minutes on cd 1 (classic, coral reef, natural) and 40 minutes on cd 2 (exotic, freshwater).

 The classic and freshwater aquaria are nice enough to look at in the wide shots, also because of the background but the other aquaria aren't really examples of fine composition in that area.

 Background music/noise choices: not too bad.

A third cd, more time for the close-ups and more attention for aquarium composition would've made this collection (a lot) better !",1090540800,,859,4.923611111111111
1642162,1,B00005OW0E,"This is the worst attempt of an aquarium I have ever seen.  Having a plain fish bowl with one fish would have been better.  Basicaly the camera stays in one spot, with may be 2 fish to look at, and they barely move around.  Then to make it worst the background is void of any color, its just gray and horrible.  I got my DVD and through it into the trash.  If I had a fire place I would have burned it!  This DVD is only worth .99 cents at the .99 cent store.",1077580800,,459,3.8297872340425534
1642163,1,B00005OW0E,"What a waste of time, money and effort!  This must be the worst screensaver ever made!  It looks like the screensaver was made by an 8 year old kid with a very cheap and old camcorder!  Rarely in focus; this screensaver is just plain junk.  I really don't know how this ended up on the retail market!  Don't buy this one!",1068076800,,321,4.19672131147541
1642164,3,B00005OW0E,"With 5 tanks to choose from (1 freshwater, 4 marine), there's quite a bit of variety on this DVD. The tanks range from your typical fishtank, with species many will recognize, to a really exotic coral reef-like tank with more unusual species. (The ""fishographies"" will tell you more about them.)
There are 4 different soundtracks to choose from while you watch the fish. Meditation and Relaxation, however sound mostly alike to me, being somewhat-weird electronic stuff. Surf is quite pleasant and soothing. The Bubbles soundtrack I find too loud and distracting (even with the volume down), and it doesn't sound like a fish tank's bubbling to me at all.
I prefer the close-up views to the full-tank. It's easier to see the fish, and it's not at all jarring when the focus goes from one fish to the next. You can put the program you've selected on ""repeat"" which will play the track in a continuous loop. According to the box, there are 15 hours of unique programming.
This is an okay DVD; it's not outstanding, and it's not awful. It IS a much easier way to keep fish than to have a real, live tank.",1063238400,,1100,4.61734693877551
1642165,4,B00005OW0E,"While I can understand the former response regarding the realism of this DVD, I will have to say that if a real aquarium is what you want, this DVD comes close, but is no substitute.  If your goal, however, is to have a relaxing moving picture to brighten up your dark square, this DVD is awesome! There is a slight bit of cloudiness, but not enough to warrant a ""pass"" on this opportunity.
Unfortunately, the new age/mood music isn't the best. But, you're not buying this for the music.  You're buying this for the visual spectacle. As for the other audio options, the fish tank sound fx are a bit hollow.  However, the surround sound ocean waves is VERY good! If you have the option on your receiver, it is better to set the video to the DVD, and have a personal CD as the audio.
I am very happy with this purchase. For a [money] investment, I'm very pleased.  Nice work!",1045267200,,873,4.37037037037037
1642166,5,B00005OW0E,"I think the former reviewer missses the point and purpose of this DVD.  It is meant to make you feel as if your television is a real fish aquarium.  It is really about providing an ambience of having a beautiful fish aquarium in your television set you can watch for hours.  For those of us with 43 inch screens, or plasma television, it is a god send.  You can enjoy the beauty of having a real life fish aquarium without the expense of caring for one.  Watching the various unusual fish and their behavior is very soothing to me and takes me to another world.  We are all so caught up in our world and its manmade nature.  It is refreshing to see other living creatures who aren't affected by politics.
I couldn't believe that previous reviewer gave this DVD only 3 stars.  People expect way too much these days not realizing how special it is to be able to pop in a DVD and watch something like this.  It was only 20 years ago we didn't have VHS, now look at what we can enjoy!",1038096000,,980,4.225806451612903
1642167,1,B00005OW0E,"Buyer beware. This is animation, and not the best I've ever seen. Nowhere, that I could find, did it say in the product review or technical notes that this was anything other than real video. I also found the sound monotonous and irritating.",1037664000,,241,4.627906976744186
1642168,1,B00005OW0E,"Beleive me, I'm being generous giving them a whole star - if I could figuire out how to give them less than that I would! I should have listened to the other disatisfied customers. The video quality is terrible (no- it's not my Sony Wega 27"" TV).  It just looked liked someone went to the local Marine Aquarium, paid their [$$$] entrance fee and set a tripod in front of the tank.  The lighting is terrible, the music is [poor].  Do I sound upset?  You bet I am!  I wish I had been smart enough to rent a camcoder and call myself a movie maker!  I am willing to venture all the other Aquaria volumes in this series are equally as [poor].  Why else would the price fall from close to [$$$] to under [$$$] in only about a year?
My advice, save your money and just buy a real fishtank!",1032134400,,782,4.139072847682119
1642169,5,B00005OW0E,"Earlier this year I saved my pennies and bought a 50"" plasma screen. It's great for home cinema but when I'm entertaining guests and not watching the screen, it's a large black hole on the wall of my living room, until now that is.
This DVD is the perfect solution. Instead of being faced with a boring featureless black void, my guests can now gaze at my fabulous collection of marine fish. The bonus is, I never have to clean the tank or feed the fish! I bought the Coral Tank version but I assume they are all variations on a theme and would perform more or less the same function.
I Take on board what other viewers have said about the size of the fish on a smaller screen, but on the plasma screen, the proportions are perfect and I think, very realistic.
The DVD also has some extra features for your PC including a fishy screen-saver, which gives a slideshow of each of the inhabitants of the tank. It also has printable high-quality photos in PDF format and a copy of Acrobat Viewer if you do not already have it.
I love it and I intend to buy the other versions!",1030579200,,1071,4.280788177339901

I was very excited to pop this DVD into my player and watch some dazzeling scenes but was very disappointed.  The picture clarity leaves ALOT to be desired especially on the long shot of the full aquarium.  With no less then 42"" of screen I could barely make out the fish in the tank!

1642173,3,B00005OW0E,"The fish are pretty and active, the photography is good, and the colors are vibrant.  But the 40-minute wide shot of the full tank is not very satisfying.  The edited close-up shots of the individual fish swimming by are much more pleasing, but this segment is only 8 minutes long.  You can select to repeat either segment endlessly, but only 8-minutes makes the ""meditation"" or ""relaxation"" audio choices rather silly.  So I am stuck with using a repeated 8 minutes of pleasent sounding ocean waves breaking on shore (the ""aquarium bubbles"" choice is not pleasing either).  Nice, but this could be much better for little extra production cost, it would seem.",1024099200,,659,4.900900900900901

1642177,3,B00005OW0E,"I was hoping this DVD would be a lot more enjoyable than it is.  I don't know why, but it just doesn't impress me.  The picture quality is good, but it's a DVD so it should be.  Other than that there's not much of interest.  Maybe the fish were having an off day when they were filmed?  I found the music tracks (""Meditation"" and ""Relaxation"") rather annoying.  The sound effects tracks are ok, but the ""Bubbles"" soundtrack doesn't sound like a fish tank to me...it's too busy and too noisy.  The setup that I like the most (or dislike the least) is the Classic tank with the Bubbles soundtrack.  That seems to be the closest to having a real tank in your living room.  If you are really serious about getting into the world of fish, then get a real tank.  If you really want to learn about fish then buy a book.  If you just want a mildly entertaining maintenance free fish tank in your living room then get this DVD.",1005782400,,918,4.27906976744186
1642178,5,B00005OW0E,"Fish tanks are expensive.  Fish are expensive, die, and they eat each other. Unless you have major bucks, and/or have duce taking care of them, fish are a pain. The other guys that said you can't change the view ratio are wrong.  These changes are made at the dvd setup menu, not the software set up, its under monitor output setup on most dvd units.

This horrifying display of aquatic life  should not receive any support.  I hope that the general public does not  believe that this is what coral or salt water fishtanks should look like.

You can loop everything, too, for repeated play. Several choices of sound tracks: my favorite is beach waves, followed by tank bubbles. Didn't like any of the music tracks. Photography nice.
