4694064,4,B005GT3X9K,Pretty excellent melancholy comedy. Now here are the other sixteen words I need to write to make this comment public.,1326758400,,117,4.9
4694065,3,B005GT3X9K,"This film begins slow, so that might let you know right upfront whether you're the intended audience.  However, it picks up steam and soon you become quite fond of the title character.  Is he awkward?  Weird?  A little off-putting?  Sure, he is all these things at one time or another, but that's what makes him so endearing.  He is trying so very hard to figure out who he is, and we get the feeling who he is, is indeed a quite lovable person who has struggled through a very hard life.  So after a bit of stumbling to get started, this film becomes exactly what you might hope it would be from the previews.  It is never pandering, but it does feel real.

Then the third act comes and, for me, the film jumps the tracks.  Why?  Without delving too much into plot details let me just say that the entire final act feels forced and unreal.  After so much effort was spent grounding this film for the first two thirds, it is quite disappointing to get to the end and realize it was all for naught.  This doesn't feel like these characters.  It feels like a plot contrivance, and that's a sad way to close out an otherwise remarkable film.

Roger Ebert named Terri one of his 20 best films of 2011.  I can't give it that high of praise, but it is still worthwhile to see once.  It just wastes so much of its goodwill on an ending that doesn't feel true.",1326585600,,1352,4.25984251968504
4694066,3,B005GT3X9K,"Alright. So. I liked the movie. I liked the performances. There are many very effective and affecting scenes. Still, it left me unsatisfied. The sequence of events never quite got around to being a story.",1325980800,,204,4.857142857142857
4694067,5,B005GT3X9K,"Being totally unfamiliar with director Azazel Jacobs's work, I sat down to watch Terri unsure of what I was in for.  One hundred or so minutes later, I was pleasantly surprised by an intimate movie that reminds us that the small things are what makes life worth living.  Centered around the travails of friendless, overweight teen Terri as he navigates high school, the world of the movie is lovingly crafted with interesting characters, all broken in their own ways.  In tiny bursts of joy, these characters escape the pain and frustration of their lives and find enough momentum to keep moving forward.  Jacob Wysocki gives a perfectly naturalistic performance as Terri, John C. Reilly is a combination of genuine and hilarious as an assistant principal, and Creed Bratton's portrayal of Terri's turning-toward-dementia uncle is surprisingly impressive.  When he experiences a brief moment of clarity, it turns into the movie's best scene.  Terri manages to surpass the clichs of the indie high school movie, and should be experienced by anyone who has ever managed to find joy in the little things.",1325635200,9,1101,5.088888888888889
4694068,2,B005GT3X9K,"This movie needed a less-than-ecstatic review. It gave me the thoughts:
""Was this film really necessary?
Was I just taken for a chump after, once again, purchasing an 'okay' movie that would have been better to rent from Red Box or check out from the library?
Is this Indy film practically a parody of itself, what with the unattractive(except for the delicious young Olivia Crocicchia) characters and the lilting piano score and the many wasted minutes?""
If a person is in the right kind of funk, this film might cheer them up, I can imagine that.
John C. Reilly practically saved it for me with his likeable character.
Not for buying, this dvd!!
It needs at least one two-star review to offer a more realistic or honest impression. If I were feeling truly critical it would have received one star. I should be angry for wasting my hard-earned money.",1321056000,,851,4.718120805369128
4694069,4,B005GT3X9K,"Positives:
Good acting; engaging storyline; good cinematography. More realistic portrayals than in the teacher/issues movie ""An Invisible Sign"".

Caveats:
The storyline is more believable if the intra-school banter and interactions with students, teachers and administration took place in an alternative school or in a small town, small school setting. What was shown in the film would not be likely in a larger populated school. Some alternative schools and their teachers or even some  small schools, where it's easier to bypass administrative/legal hurdles, would have interceded more overtly from buying him clothes to contacting social service agencies for help at home. Most schools would have a student group to assist students like Terri by addressing both the student population as a whole and Terri personally on dealing with his differences.

Negatives:
The drinking and sex scenes were over played in the movie relative to all that takes place in a high school student's life and certainly relative to how Terri developed into due to his unique physical characteristics, isolation and home hospice challenges.
What is it with music as filler or to set tone in Indie style movies - it's becoming too much of a crutch for not attending to good stories, writing, research and acting. Also, what's with close to thirty producers and sixty special thanks contributors? I think the person who's in charge of finding free crew snack allocation is now an associate producer.",1320883200,,1478,5.280851063829787
4694070,3,B005GT3X9K,"This is a contemplative film about an alienated teen with some new unlikely friends, including his school principal. There is a lot of sexual content that may make some uncomfortable and parents would not like to watch it with their kids, I imagine.  Also, if you are looking for resolution and a lot of action, this is not the film for you.",1319241600,3,341,4.5
4694071,4,B005GT3X9K,"Terri (Jacob Wysocki), is a boy. Normally Terri for males is spelled with a ""Y"" as opposed to the cutesy ""I"" for females. This is symbolic of his role as a ""victim of circumstance"" in this awkward coming of age story. Terri is 15, obese and pathetic. He cares for his uncle who has memory lapses and bad days. Terri goes to school wearing pajamas and has a nemesis (Justin Prentice as Dirty Zach) who picks on him as well as is semi-intimate with a blond girl (Olivia Crocicchia as Heather) in which Terri is interested.

John C. Reilly plays the semi-cool, slightly creepy, misfit school principal Mr. Fitzgerald who takes an interest in Terri's life as he is frequently late for homeroom. Terri quickly realizes that the principal only meets with misfits and is upset he is in that group. We see Terri and Heather's relationship bloom during a very bad music montage. The movie lumbers along slow and steady like Terri. At times I found myself waiting for something to happen that wasn't as boring as real life. Like most Indy movies it relishes in its uncomfortable scenes, substituting real human drama, which we get enough in our own life, for exploding heads on the screen. I admit it, I am shallow and enjoy exploding heads.

If you are a big fan of Indie films and John C. Reilly this is a 5 star must see movie. The characters were unique and realistic. The dialogue flowed but was not abundantly witty or clever. There is a scene where graffiti states ""Fitzgerald is a zombie."" John C. Reilly played an uncredited ""bathroom zombie"" in ""Zombieland,"" perhaps an inside indie joke. The movie includes some real life views and philosophy expressed through the understanding John C. Reilly. Good Indie.

F bomb, sex talk,  near sex. No nudity.",1318723200,4,1748,4.684039087947883
4694072,5,B005GT3X9K,"Clark Douglas, DVD Verdict --The cast is terrific, with Wysocki making a terrific impression in his first major role. I hope he doesn't become one of those actors who everyone admires but who is still shipped off to TV guest star obscurity due to his unconventional appearance. He never permits himself to slip into melodrama, nor does he oversell his material at any point. This is the kind of terrific performance which is likely to be ignored during awards season simply because you never catch Wysocki acting. Reilly is also quite strong as Fitzgerald, delivering a performance which circles similar territory to the characters he essayed so well in Cyrus and Magnolia: an earnest, good-hearted man who's trying so hard not to screw up the positive relationships he's formed. Fans of The Office will also find Bratton's work a revelation; he's affecting in the role and has considerable screen presence.

Terri arrives on Blu-ray sporting a very attractive 1080p/1.85:1 transfer. Cinematography doesn't tend to be a strong point of character-driven indie flicks in general, but this one looks terrific and benefits from quite a bit of graceful visual storytelling. There were times when I was reminded of Andrea Arnold's Fish Tank, another small film which found many striking images in drab surroundings. Detail is superb throughout and blacks are deep and inky. Audio is also solid, with clean dialogue, a few moments of impressively detailed sound design and a resonant musical score (which oh-so-occasionally threatens to become too precious, but generally manages to deliver the right amount of emotional punch without becoming cloying). Supplements are limited a disposable featurette (the 10-minute ""A Look Inside Terri"") and some deleted scenes.

4694073,3,B005GT3X9K,"""There's good hearted kids and there's bad hearted kids. When I look at you I see a good heart."" Terri (Wysocki) is a larger then average 15 year old. Feeling like an out cast and having to take care of his sick uncle he seems to give up. After repeated tardiness to school and his new wardrobe of pajamas only, the school's principal (Reilly) decides to take Terri under his wing. This is a new take on the outcast school kid movie. The actor playing Terri does a fantastic job with this and even Reilly is subdued and adds a lot to the character. While the movie is not anything original you really feel for this character and want things to go his way. Unlike most other outcast movies like ""She's The One"" or even ""Naploean Dynamite"" this one seems much more realistic and that makes it better then most of the movies in this type of genre. The humor in this is more subdued but still a pretty funny watch. Overall, not a bad movie with the type of humor that not everyone will get. Worth checking out though. I say B.

Would I watch again? - No I don't think so.

*Also try - Cyrus & Youth In Revolt",1316563200,7,1104,4.2274881516587675

4694125,4,B005GT3X9K,Being an ideal middle school principal probably involves catching troubled kids very much like these at the worst moment of their lives and trying to gain their trust without being manipulated.  His two most challenging boys don't have mothers and waffle between deep depression and rebellion.  The girl is complex enough that it's better to draw your own conclusions.  I'm glad there are no fake happy or fake tragic endings here to distract you from their personalities.,1360540800,,472,5.103896103896104

4694127,5,B005GT3X9K,"Great movie with a great cast.

4694129,1,B005GT3X9K,"I rented this move for two reasons. 1. It had John C. Reilly and 2 because the synopsis posed this as a coming of age buddy comedy. The movie is well acted but the problem isn't the actors it's the script. The indie genre is filled with nothing more than awkward characters put in normal situations and this is just another one of those movies. The basis of this movie is about adolescence and the problems that comes along with growing up as a fat teenage outcast with little social grace and a pension for beans and toast. You can try and read into the movie and look for the symbolism as to why the main character is the way he is but let me save you some time. He's fat and lonely end of story. There is one poignant moment in the film when John C. Reilly is explaining the truth about human nature but the rest of the story is just a bunch of useless drivel used to fill in time. This movie is 1 hour and 46 minutes of your life that you will never get back. The ending is predictable and the resolution of the movie is basically that all the main character ever needed in life is one true friend. Amazing isn't it? I could smear my own feces on celluloid and show it at the Sundance film festival and it would make for a better viewing than this farce of a movie. Do yourself a favor and don't watch it. If I was rich I would buy every copy of this movie that was ever produced, put them all in a rocket and launch it into outer space just so the human race wouldn't have to be subjected to this movie.",1347408000,,1508,4.08080808080808
4694130,5,B005GT3X9K,"To the average viewer it may not seem like much, but It is truly remarkable to anyone that can relate. A clear demonstration of how a person who truly cares can make a big difference.  To put things in perspective, growing up was not an easy task, but thanks to someone very much like John Riley's character those ""growing pains"" were a lot more bearable because someone with truly a heart of gold was there when I needed them.",1341964800,,427,4.405063291139241
4694131,2,B005GT3X9K,"The  ""i"" in the spelling of the title character should give you fair warning 0of the pretentious aspirations of this comic infused coming of age drama that should have - could have - been a sleeper.  The first half of the story (and film) really works.  The sad/funny relationship of the depressed, pajama clad student (Jacob Wysocki) and the well-meaning vice principal and counselor (a spot on John C. Reilly) is full of promise, but that thread unravels with a longish, sexual coming of age sequence that seems forced and motivated only by an attempt at politically correctness.  The movie never gets back on track and all the things that were set up are never satisfactorily actualized.  I wanted to like this so much and felt betrayed.  Not a good feeling.  Azazal Jacobs directs with uncertainty about what story he wants to tell.",1332979200,,836,4.804195804195804
4694132,3,B005GT3X9K,"Terri is a sweet, modern fable about a quirky, giant kid who really likes wearing pajamas. Not only does Terri, the giant teen, have to suffer the daily humiliation of being the weird giant kid who wears pajamas to high school, he also has to take care of Creed from NBC's The Office, who plays against type as the old man. Terri learns life lessons from John C. Reilly, the goofy Vice Principal, falls in love with a girl of average height, and befriends a misfit who pees on his pants on purpose and then puts them on---a true depiction of high school, if ever there was one. Terri is basically The Station Agent meets My Giant meets Glee (without any singing or dancing) and just like all three, it was alright.",1330819200,,714,4.416666666666667
4694133,2,B005GT3X9K,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Another quirky indie comes down the pike by the name of 'Terri'. It's about an obese kid who goes to school in his pajamas and tries to cope in a world of peers who are against him. 'Terri' basically fits my definition of the classic quirky indie which puts forth a ""quirky protagonist who must go on a journey of self-discovery, shedding a repressed upbringing while thwarting the goals of a reactionary group that wishes to maintain the status quo."" Here the ""reactionary"" group consists of the bullies who mock Terri and other ostracized kids at the school as well as unsympathetic teachers, who all seem to feel that any acts of kindness toward their students would be detrimental to their overall growth.

Other quirky indies such as 'The Descendants', have a protagonist that begins as a member of a reactionary group, but then rebels against them (think of George Clooney's character taking a stand against those members of his family who side with the developers). With Terri, there's a variation on the common theme: he must shed his repressed upbringing but is never part of the reactionary group he's opposed to. In fact, Terri is an outcast from that group, from day one! In contrast to the punks at school, Terri actually has a good heart. This is manifested in his loving concern for his Uncle James, who is afflicted with early onset Alzheimer's. Terri's issues revolve around lack of self-esteem, exacerbated by the bullying at school as well as a wellspring of anger that sometimes emerges at inopportune times. Early on, after trapping mice in the attic, Terri begins trapping mice in the woods which upsets Uncle James, as he feels Terri might be getting enjoyment from the act of killing instead of merely taking care of a rodent problem.

Enter John C. Reilly as Assistant Principal Mr. Fitzgerald, who appears to be in charge of all the school misfits. Fitzgerald is also an oddball himself, and pretends to yell at his charges behind closed doors, only to reassure them that's it's only an act. Fitzgerald tells the kids that the 'tough guy act' is primarily for the benefit of his secretary, Mrs. Hamish, who he views as needing some kind of invigoration as she is gravely ill and about to kick the proverbial bucket.

A good part of the film revolves around Terri bonding with the kindly Mr. Fitzgerald. At first Terri feels betrayed by Fitzgerald after he claims to be giving Terri an exclusive peek at a childhood yearbook . But when Chad Markson (Terri's new potential friend and fellow outcast) informs Terri that Fitzgerald also let him take a look at the 'exclusive' yearbook, Terri turns on him, in a fit of jealousy. Later, Terri apologizes to Chad for 'losing it' and eventually grows closer to Fitzgerald, who by film's end, has morphed into the teenager's good 'buddy'.

The plot thickens when Terri sticks up for the cute Heather Mills, who is also the victim of classroom bullies. Soon afterward Terri, Heather and Chad are popping pills (Uncle James' Alzheimer medication), down in the basement of Terri's home and strange things ensue. For one, Chad accepts a dare to urinate on his own pants. Later, Heather strips to her underclothes, and offers to have some kind of sexual contact with Terri. The shy Terri knows his limits and declines, but clearly Heather's offer has done wonders for his self-esteem.

Nothing much happens after that! Fitzgerald takes Terri and Chad to Mrs. Hamish's funeral and later Fitzgerald reveals to Terri that he's been having some problems with his wife at home. The conflict with the bullies at school has been dropped and Fitzgerald never goes mano a mano with any of his disinterested colleagues.

I'm sure 'Terri' has a good many boosters who are attracted to the offbeat characters and situations. But my problem with this kind of 'quirky' dramedy, is that there's something inherently distasteful in films of this ilk. Somehow the quirky outcasts (despite a few shortcomings) always manage to be of high noble stock, and the antagonists who they're pitted against, invariably are rotten to the core. It's a formula that's repeated over and over again and I find myself not wanting to root for the Terri's of this world, precisely because their underdog status is so undeserved (just about anyone would look good, if they were pitted against such nasty opponents).

I enjoy watching John C. Reilly since he's in so many films and I always wonder what kind of character he's going to take on next. Here he's a sweet guy who's helping kids who need some positive reinforcement. Jacob Wysocki ably conveys the loner Terri but the character is too distasteful at times to be considered even near heroic. The same goes for Bridger Zadina as the equally weird Chad, who's urination routine at film's end, is also thoroughly off-putting. I kept wondering why Olivia Crocicchia as Heather ends up on the misfit list, considering that she's the cutest girl in the school. Finally, there's Creed Bratton as Uncle James. Catch the DVD extras and you'll be amazed that Bratton is a sensational blues singer and guitarist. Of course he should be, as he's the former member of the Grass Roots, the eminent pop rock band from the 60s.",1329782400,,5238,4.838169642857143

8472301,4,B005GT3X9K,"The older I get (I'm 40) and the more I experience of life's highs and lows (more low than high lately), the more I gravitate to these type of quirky, offbeat, indie ""dramedies"".  The stories and characters just feel more real, human, and relateable than most Hollywood stuff.  Right up my alley.  Its like they opened up a new world to me and made me realize its ok to just be myself, not some ""normal"", soulless, successful, macho, ""alpha male"" cliche.  Highly flawed but basically good hearted people just trying to do their best, in their own messed up way, to make sense of and survive this Type A, capitalist, Trump-loving society and scary world of ""normal"" people and ""grown-ups"" ::shudder::.  Sign me up.  My kind of people.

Probably my favorite movie so far from director Azazel Jacobs.  Related to protagonist Terri, but possibly even more to his principal played by the great John C. Reilly.  He had the great line: ""I screw up all the time because that's what people do.""  So painfully true.  My only complaint is the film kinda petered out at the end, but otherwise a worthwhile watch.  Anyway, so if anyone out there (of all ages) has ever felt different from the herd, ever felt lost, alienated, or like they don't belong in this world, I'd definitely recommend this movie to you, my fellow misfit and kindred spirit :)  If you agree with my review at all, you can mostly find me these days at twitter dot com/ShyLivesMatter Peace :)",1494547200,,1450,4.63921568627451
