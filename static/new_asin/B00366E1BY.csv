4073643,5,B00366E1BY,"I randomly stumbled on this on Netflix, and boy am I happy! This is an amazing documentary of how people met their dogs and how their dogs affect their lives. The background music goes extremely well with everything, which makes the movie 10 times better.

Also, is it just me or did anyone else cry during the adopting and dying segments?",1306281600,2,339,4.557377049180328

8389595,4,B00366E1BY,"This was a sweet, short documentary about celebrities/wealthy people and their dogs. Halfway through I realized that it wasn't going to tell me anything about owning a dog that I didn't know. Its focus seems to be, ""Wow, rich people have pets too.""  On the other hand, everybody interviewed was nice, and they delivered accurate, though typical, sentiments about owning a dog. Yes, dogs will keep you going when you are ill, even slowly dying, and yes, dogs can help developmentally challenged people function better. And dogs are fun, and cute, etc. I don't think there is any compelling reason to buy this video (I got it for free), unless you want to see an interview of one of your favorite actors from the 90's. But it is well shot and well done, technically. And the dogs are cute.",1438387200,,787,4.661870503597123
8389596,3,B00366E1BY,I was expecting a little more.  I wish I had rented it instead of purchasing.  Rent first and then buy if you want.,1397952000,,115,3.9565217391304346
8389597,5,B00366E1BY,"The dog helping the autistic child is an amazing entrance into a fabulous film. You'll see sides of famous people you never expected to see. I was laughing so hard with Lasse Hallstrom saying, ""They know how to go outside. Other than that, it's horrendous.""  Billy Collins, our poet laureate, states, ""I'll fetch the bone.."" when his dog ignores him. When they speak of losing their dogs, it's powerful as heck. A must for anyone who loves his/her dog...and a must for those thinking of dog rescue. Just do it. I watched it with my two old ""pups"" who are 8 and 9, and we loved it; the part about heaven *and having your dog with you there* is mesmerizing.",1391299200,,655,4.458333333333333
8389598,4,B00366E1BY,"A fine stocking stuffer for dog-lovers.  This is a well made film.  The participants are articulate, and the dogs are charmers.",1386633600,,127,5.0
8389599,5,B00366E1BY,"Just a brilliant film that through the stories of people, many of them famous actors, poets, writers paint an express with heartfelt reverence the incredible, spiritual and privileged bond that exists between dogs and the people who love them.

At 54 I've never been without a dog, we are passionate about them, devoted and feel blessed to be able to share our lives with how Richard Gere says in the film "" These wonderful life forms disguised in dog suits are the personification of unconditional love.

Moving, hilarious and tear jerking - this is one extraordinary documentary.

When it comes to dogs I think the world is divided between those that ""get it"" and those that don't. The bond that can develop between dog and human is unrivaled and unique. The film makes this point with the often moving testimony of and eclectic group of people telling their stories - and of course you get to meet the dogs too.

This gorgeous film is the most eloquent expression of the deep bond between human and dog that can in every way enrich your life. A must have ,must see film for anyone who shares their life with a dog - and knows in their heart and soul the relationship is profound in every way and enriches the fabric of our lives.",1340064000,3,1232,4.5610859728506785
