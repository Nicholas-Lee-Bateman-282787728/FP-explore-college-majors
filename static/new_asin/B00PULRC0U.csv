6821945,5,B00PULRC0U,"It has taken many years, but finally fans of Watership Down in the United States can enjoy a HD transfer of the feature film directed by Martin Rosen.  To give a little background, I own two previous DVD releases of this film:

- the 2002 DVD release from Warner Brothers in the US
- the 2003 DVD release from Big Sky Studio in Australia (named the 25th Anniversary Edition)

The version from Warner had the film and basically no extras.  The Australian release brought a slightly softer film transfer, and a commentary with director Martin Rosen that lasted as long as the film itself, and went into great detail about how difficult it was to make this film.  When I heard Criterion was going to release Watership Down on Blu-ray in the states, I was very excited as this company takes film transfers seriously and I knew they would do the job right.

The wait was worth it.

**Video Quality**

I watch my blu-ray's on a 40"" LG lcd tv which is probably about seven years old by now.  The first thing I immediately noticed watching this film is the annoying film flicker that was always present on my DVD copies was GONE!  The film was cleaned up, and film grain and specks that used to be visible on the DVD prints when you watch certain scenes are so minimized, you wouldn't guess that this film is over thirty five years old.  Lastly, one thing that I clearly noticed is the color palette of the film seemed different from the DVD versions.  This could have to do with the master used (Criterion says its a 35mm negative from Warner) and how it was transferred digitally compared to the releases from ten years before.  Either way, its very accurate, and soft.  The film was never made in the sense that everything had sharp, dark lines to outline the character designs.  The lush painted backgrounds of the English countryside look amazing as well.  This is not a modern animated film with colors that will jump off the screen and say ""look at me"".  The colors are natural, muted, and just perfect for the scene and the video transfer in my opinion, shows them as best as I have ever viewed them.

**Audio Quality**

One thing I do not have is a floor-standing stereo system.  I use Sony MDR-7506 headphones and a Behringer headphone amp for watching movies, so I can't speak to how it would sound with large speakers.  Given that these are very analytic headphones and they're used for mastering all sorts of stuff in studios, it gave me a good idea of how the film's soundtrack held up.  The DVD releases had thin sound, almost as if someone forgot that there were sounds below 300hz.  Criterion digitally edited the film soundtrack in 24-bit 2.0 stereo and honestly, the sound isn't all that different from the DVD releases.  This tells me, its more likely a limitation of whatever magnetic tape and system was used to edit the sound in the 1970s when preparing the final mix.  Oddly though, the CD album soundtrack (long out of print) sounds great, so its clear Watership Down was recorded well.  Compare Kehaar's flight in the film to ""Kehaar's Theme"" from the CD album and you'll see just how lacking the sound quality is on the film.  Again, I don't believe this was Criterion's fault.  The voices are clear as they have ever been, and there's only so much you can do about tape hiss which is still evident in some scenes.  The only negative I can point out with headphone listening is that it seems to be mastered very loud, and that there are even parts where tape hiss can be heard getting louder as gain is applied.

**Extras/Special Features**

The special features are minimal with this release.  I have been spoiled by the interview on the Australian DVD release, and I was aware that the director interview with Martin Rosen on this release would probably be a very truncated version of that other interview.  However, I was pleased to see that during the interview we get to see photos of the cast and crew (also seen on the Australian DVD) and some of the movie stills and character designs.  Martin Rosen really does love this film!  I didn't care too much for the reflection from Guillermo del Toro about how Watership Down made him enjoy the animated medium more.  I have not had an opportunity to watch the storyboard picture-in-picture run through of the entire film, preferring the see the film in its HD glory so I cannot comment on what that is like at this time.

**Conclusion**

Is this worth buying?  If you're a fan of Watership Down--absolutely!  The film has never looked this good before, and I don't believe it will ever look any better, and blu-ray is more than capable of meeting the mark when it comes to a proper HD version of this film.  The audio offered no substantial improvement over previous versions, and if you've never seen any special features or heard Martin Rosen talk about this film before, the 15 minute interview will be a delight.  It won't hold a candle to the interview given on the Big Sky DVD release from 2003, but that DVD is so long out of print and hard to find, that this new updated interview is very much worth it for people who have seen nothing.  Yes, Criterion releases cost more, but its worth it!",1424908800,72,5170,4.555796316359697

Awesome animated movie finally getting the Criterion treatment it so deserves.

Please do not scare or traumatise your younger children by being confused with the cartoon aspect of this video. It contains animated violence and pseudo-gore in some scenes, and scary allusive scenes that can and will potentially scare young viewers.

Fantastic movie, timeless classic, and with excellent voice casting. Animation here is wonderful and is based on an actual book by the same name.",1420588800,15,462,5.133333333333334

I am very glad it entered the CRITIRION COLLECTABLE COLLECTION. Deriving from the ancient & still used kritirion(look it up). Guys & Gal's.  You have the world famous song, that everyone must at least heard one time, bright eyes.  Art garfunkle. It got many an award.  & even the respect it deserves by entering the above category mentioned.  Seriously this one set the bar very high.  & with all the super technology, to this day it's still up there.

6821949,5,B00PULRC0U,"This is exciting! I watched Watership Down a long time ago and I absolutely love it. It was a film that freaked me out as a kid but still liked it. Now I love it since I'm old enough to really appreciate it. Images in this film always stuck in my mind and I was kind of blown away at how bloody it could be at time. Even as a kid I liked how adult it was.  And now Criterion is releasing it. I hope this is the start of a trend of releasing more animated films in the Criterion Collection since animation is also an important part of film history (they did release Fantastic Mr Fox earlier this year and Katsuhiro Otomo's Akira on Laserdisc back in 1993 but goodness knows more can get released in the collection like Mamoru Oshii's Angel's Egg, The Richard Williams cut of ""The Thief and the Cobbler,"" ""Macross Do You Remember Love,"" ""End of Evangelion"" and so on).

6821950,4,B00PULRC0U,"Obviously the problem Criterion didn't factor in with these current competitors releasing and even Criterion's own revising of it's own titles. is that reviews here and abroad maybe conflicting. And this may hinder sales for either their Blu Ray and/or DVD versions. DO NOT HEED PREVIOUS COMPLAINTS OF REGION AND PAL ISSUES HERE!  Criterion versions will play fine in North America, And from what I garner from Criterions site, this version doesn't offer much more than the already current DVD that's on the market. So unless you're a ardent fan of this movie and/or don't posses the current DVD, this version doesn't hold much more significance. Other than the fact the Blu Ray version may appease a small contingent of customers previously duped by the overseas Blu Ray PAL version.

6821956,5,B00PULRC0U,"This review is for the Criterion Blu-Ray version. If you're reading this review, you probably already know that ""Watership Down"" is a stunning example of non-Disney American animation. It has received many compliments and accolades over the years and rightfully deserves them all. So let's move ahead to the worthiness of the Criterion edition.

Bottom line: worth every penny at double the current asking price! The adventures of Hazel, Fiver, Bigwig and gang has never looked better. The animation is captured beautifully and is a joy to watch. The extra features add an additional level of enjoyment. Watching the creators proudly speak of their successes while lamenting their few mistakes is rewarding for interested fans. It is clear that the makers reflect fondly on the experience.

If anything, I found myself wanting more. This copy will bring satisfaction to long time fans awaiting a great version. NOW, if only Criterion would do the same for ""The Plague Dogs""...that would really make fans of Richard Adams and this style of animation happy!",1506124800,3,1055,5.16374269005848

6821962,5,B00PULRC0U,"Among the greatest in animation movies both for storytelling and for artwork, Watership Down has finally been released on Blu-ray. The story itself is great. The artwork may not impress you if you are accustomed to superheros or anime, with characters jumping and fighting in the air while shooting lasers and causing explosions. You will not find that sort of action here, but what you will find is far more realistic, even though it is from the perspective of rabbits. This is hand-made animation, old school artwork, nothing computerized about this. The rabbits move like rabbits. Their realistic movements contribute to the suspension of disbelief, once you accept the idea of talking rabbits. This is not a cartoon for young children. Animals fight and die in this cartoon. There is nothing gory, but some scenes might be quite disturbing for young children. Until your kids are old enough to know about death, they shouldn't watch this. I let my kids watch it when my youngest was 6 and the oldest 8, and while that may be too young for some, mine handled it fine; however, they had already experienced the deaths of two close grandparents, so it wasn't something new to them. That's just a warning to those who see a cartoon rabbit and instantly think this will keep the kids occupied for two hours. Don't be that guy. Watch it with the kids if you think they are old enough. Or even if you don't have kids it is worth watching. Without giving away the story, many of the themes are really only understood by adults, so this was never intended to be a kids movie.

The blu-ray transfer is excellent, much clearer than the DVD, as you might expect. Drawn lines are sharp. Colors are more vibrant. The sound is better. They have done a top notch job on this blu-ray. It is worth buying even if you already own the DVD.",1499644800,6,1823,4.6265432098765435
6821963,4,B00PULRC0U,"Good old school movie, but it sure as heck is not for kids! Too much blood and violence, plus I'm not sure they would be able to understand the message the movie is trying to convey. This needs to be PG 13 at least.",1499558400,,215,3.909090909090909

The art direction and animation production (plus the digital transfer) hold up very well and look rather smooth.

The film is a bit violent for small kids, IMO.  (A couple of rabbits getting their throats ripped right out, pretty graphically is the worst of it.)

I would also say I might like the movie a tad bit better than the book.  The book got a bit much in the ""RabbitSpeak"" and made it slightly hard to read.  But it was my first time reading it through... and I'm ailing.  So there's that.",1484697600,4,674,4.414634146341464

Back when cartoons & animated films had a seriousness and gritty realism and class that modern times have smothered with dumb down drivel. I pity the younger generations because they simply don't have it as good as we did,back when people took pride in their work, and also when films were  not made so obtusely timid or overly PC to show children some harsh realities in the world (as seen here in Watership, Secret of Nimh, the Dark Crystal, etc. all classics that were brilliantly done) The Dark side of epic storytelling & fairy tales is an important detail, because it prepares us for the horrors we all face later in life. They educate, enthrall and entertain. But I digress; this is an excellent addition to my classic collection, and has great voice acting by John Hurt, Terrence Rigby, and many other stars.

The first time I saw Watership Down, I was in high school.  Some parts of the movie bothered me even then, so if you are worried about showing it to young kids, I wouldn't.  It's not so much terrible and scary as it is raw.  Some little ones may not be ready for it, so I would use caution.  All in all a great film and I think everyone should see it at least once.",1441152000,2,691,4.142857142857143

6822026,4,B00PULRC0U,"A softly told story of rabits trying to make it on their own. The story starts off almost right away. The bird Kehaar is hilarious. The characters despite being in watercolors are vivid and animated. The ending is quite bloody so you do need to pay attention when it says ""animation for adults"" Adults would appreciate it better anyhow. However I would probably say 12 and up is fine to watch this. (I base that age on the fact they allow that age to play video games like Deadpool, Far Cry etc that are ONLY about killing and no one has an issue with those)",1437523200,2,558,4.3238095238095235

6822044,5,B00PULRC0U,I had never seen this film since the its original release.  This is a story that touches the vital core of human existence.  It affected me so deeply that I did not want to see it again.  I read the book and the inferences are so profound and so human that I could never forget this book.  It's such an apt portrayal of man's need to conquer and subject others.  That it was a about rabbits was so apt because a rabbit is the purest form of innocence and love.  I have never forgot this story and the poignancy of its content.  I believe still in the innocence of life and the strength of love and the desire to believe.  Such stories are rare and seldom seen today.  This is an excellent purchase.,1427155200,16,698,4.18796992481203

6822046,5,B00PULRC0U,"Not only is Watership down one of my favorite animated movies its of my favorite movies of all time. It's epic, dark, emotional, and it doesn't try to sugar coat anything as if we can't handle it. It's clearly not a movie for little kids but for those twelve and above you're in for a special treat! I also love exploring the society and culture of the rabbits and there is just an extremely high degree of creativity and originality and it's all remastered in beautiful HD. Based on the best selling british novel by Richard Adams Watership down both the book and movie are a door to another world you've never noticed in the outside world, a world you won't regret exploring! So why are you still reading this review? Go and read and watch this fantastic story that so deserves  to be noticed and remembered now and forever!",1426896000,6,826,4.506666666666667

6822050,5,B00PULRC0U,"WATERSHIP DOWN is a simple adventure story about a group of rabbits seeking a new place to call home -- simple, that is, until you see that it's part political allegory and part POW escape thriller, woven together with a trickster creation myth and the kind of death-haunted theology one could imagine in the lives of a prey species at the mercy of a world of predators.

Is this a kids' movie? Sure, for thoughtful, older kids who won't be freaked out by seeing some of life's harsher realities on the screen.",1425254400,24,510,4.543478260869565
