3424202,4,B00197POYA,"I seen this filmdoc a few times and still get horrified by the revelations in this movie.  No matter what your stance is on homosexuality everyone should watch this one!  Some people would say being on the downlow is being a coward in coming out, while that maybe true in most cases, the real problem within the black community we still don't want to talk about this or homosexuality period without preaching the sermon about how wrong it is.  We must, especially for our daughters who are usually the most infected with HIV, should have more open-ended discussions at an early age on what guys to date or marry so they can have better choices.  As for our sons, instead going in so hardcore about what men should not do, we need to have more talks to our sons about what makes them honest and upstanding men without living in fear.  And let's me just also, because downlow is more prevalent in the black community does not restrict other races from doing this as well.",1287792000,2,969,4.514285714285714
3424203,3,B00197POYA,"I thought the documentary was extremely amateur and missed several opportunities to touch upon the subject at a deeper, level encouraging more critical thinking from the men chosen.  The fact that the down low phenomenon occurs across gender and color lines was completely excluded along with other important topics.  It was a bit shallow and vague, but had great potential.  As there is so little covering this subject, I'm glad that someone was brave and committed enough to go for it, but there is much more work to be done.  This video also seemed somewhat reverse classist in that the phenomenon seemed to only interview impoverished people as though they are the only ones living on the downlow.",1272758400,2,701,4.915254237288136

3424207,3,B00197POYA,"I'm still not convinced.

With the exception of Ray (who was younger and more masculine of the bunch) and Antonio (who used to be a crossdresser before he was sent to prison and is still very much feminine), the men were clearly homosexual.  I don't like to perpetuate stereotypes, but from their mannerisms to the way they talked, it was quite evident.  So during this documentary, I just found myself stumped beyond belief about how these Black women--and our Black women in general--play the fool to this at times.  Is it a lack of self worth or a hunger to have a man at any cost?  Kerwin, attractive as he was, was just as feminine as could be, yet there was a female in particular that was chasing him up until he sits her down to tell her that he sleeps with men.  I felt he was still in denial because he never came out and said he was gay, he used the safe term bisexual.  When Antonio's 19-year-old boyfriend George brings his girlfriend to the gay club and then tells her that he is gay, ending their relationship, it is hard to watch but I don't feel too sorry for her as I'm sure that's not the first time she had seen him with or around Antonio and suspected.  When Ray talks about a female he is dealing with during a confessional scene who blurts out during an argument, ""You like hotdogs!"" but is still with him (and he eventually gets her pregnant), it's just amazing that she knows what he does with other men, but settles.

The kind of men I would've really been most interested in seeing in this documentary were those that Antonio mentioned who were in prison, married, with kids.  He seemed to paint a more vivid picture of these men than the documentary does.  During one of his confessional scenes he pulls out many pictures of guys he dated and/or had sex with, and speaks of one man who he recently saw out with his wife on the street.  He becomes fearful when he runs down the amount of people he's been with and goes to a free clinic to take an HIV test.  In contrast, Ray uses the promiscuity of men, cheating, and worrying about them having HIV as a means to get out of dealing with them altogether when he goes back to females or decides to just be by himself.  I found sympathy with his story the most because he seemed torn and mental with his fascination with only drag queens and transexuals.  The common thread between Ray, Kerwin, and Billy lied in their heavy involvement in the scene.  They attended gay clubs or house parties and used the lingo (femme queen, trade, father), something I just don't see a true down low man being a part of.

Antonio's mother said she didn't want to believe [that he was gay] but she was aware.  When Kerwin tells his father, who mentioned that he heard things, it was heartwarming to hear him say, ""You're my son...You could never embarrass me.""  But in the end it confirms these men are just hiding from themselves because if a parent always knows, many others probably do as well.

I come from a time where the definition of a man on the ""down low"" or ""dl"" best described a man who was unclockable to the straight world; who basically carried himself like a man in masculinity and appearance, and kept up appearances to the straight world with the exception of being intimate with other men.  A man on the down low knows not of the homosexual lifestyle or scene (clubs, lingo, etc.) and doesn't immerse himself in it; if anything he shys away from it for fear of being found out.  A down low man wouldn't even put himself out there like this on camera.  This documentary affirms what I see lately, a shift in the term as it defines any Black gay man--be it masculine or feminine--who has not come out or is not out to his straight counterparts.

In my opinion, this is just a documentary of open Black gay men telling their stories, as interesting as they are.",1255392000,9,3835,4.4070921985815605

3424210,5,B00197POYA,"-quote by Ralph Ellison

On the Downlow is a rather well made documentary that showcases the degree to which young black men who are either gay or who like both men and women have chosen to remain ""on the downlow"" (which means ""closeted"") to avoid nasty confrontations and other social issues including the stigma associated with these lifestyles in the African-American community. The African-American community has usually been somewhat at odds with men who enjoy romantic time with other men; the black man is often expected to date women. This all means that many black men must at least superficially live their lives as if they were straight; this low budget yet powerful documentary seriously and meaningfully explores the issues these men face as a result of being something other than straight and therefore choosing or even having to live their lives ""on the downlow."" In addition, the action moves along at a good pace and the quality of the print is excellent.

We meet several African-American young men and we listen and watch as they talk, go dancing and socialize on film. We see very clearly how they choose to cope with their sexuality and how their relationships can either blossom or suffer as a result. One young man named Kerwin opens up to a platonic girlfriend and they become better friends while another young man says his family would disown him if they knew what his lifestyle really was. Another young man named Ray likes to go with men dressed up as women especially because he doesn't want to wake up to a scruffy face; he prefers to wake up to a woman's face even though he knows he's occasionally been intimate with a man. Ray goes through his life as a thug mostly on the downlow although of course he has some friends who do know his true preferences. Kerwin sweats it out as he dials his father on the telephone to tell him that he liked both men and women; how will Kerwin's father react to this news? We also meet Antonio who was intimate with men when he was incarcerated. Antonio tells us of how some men explore intimacy with other men in jail or prison and he adds that some of these men keep these preferences as at least part of their lifestyle when they are released from incarceration. We also meet George, who dates Antonio; and we see how George handles things when a crisis arises in Antonio's life. We also see Antonio's mother and how she reacts to the knowledge that her son is dating another man; and we witness the moment when George tells his ""girlfriend"" that they are over as a couple--when he takes her to a gay bar along with his boyfriend. How will she react?

The DVD comes with the theatrical trailer but the real plus is a valuable bonus: We get about fifteen minutes of extra footage with some of the men from the film and two more men who are not in the film. In particular, we meet Will, a school teacher who has feelings for men but yet wants children although he hasn't figured out yet where straight marriage stands in his life. Despite the fact that Will has feelings for men he is openly opposed to marriage between two men; again we see the heavy influence of the African-American community's belief that black men should be straight and that being gay or liking both men and women is neither truly acceptable nor valid as a lifestyle choice.

On the Downlow is an excellent documentary that takes a rare look at African-American men who have feelings for other men (or who have feelings for both men and women). I highly recommend this film for anyone interested in this issue.",1245024000,12,3550,4.594637223974764
3424211,3,B00197POYA,"1.  THERE'S SOMETHING HERE THAT DIDN'T SURPRISE ME.  In a lot of the scenarios, the straight Blacks had some clue about the DL brothas.  One guy said when his girlfriend and he broke up, she screamed, ""You like hot dogs anyway!""  But yet she later took him back.  When one guy came out as bisexual, his military father said, ""I had been hearing stories of that.""  A straight female friend said to one DL man, ""I knew that!""  The Black community is my own community and I do think that sometimes it's not that brothas are hiding; it's that straights are willing to ignore the facts because they don't want them to be true in the first place.  This DL thing is not fool-proof.

2.  THERE'S SOMETHING HERE THAT SADDENS ME OR MAKES ME EMPATHIZE WITH STRAIGHT WOMEN.  First, one brotha is dancing in sexy rhythm with his girlfriend, then later he comes out to her while his boyfriend is at the same table.  The woman asks, ""Does this mean this is the end of you and me?"" and the DL guy affirms that.  The sista bows down her head in sadness.  I think a whole bunch of straight female viewers are going to get teary-eyed at this.  This woman did not ask that her man be gay.  She lost what she thought was a good partner through no fault of her own.  The documentary does not pursue the issue further and some may feel that this short-changes her unfairly.  But this scene reminds me of Dina Matos-McGreevey's autobiography and Liza Minelli's comments about the legitimate pain of straight women who find out the real deal about their male partners.  Perhaps someone could make a documentary about how they suffer too.  Those interested in this from a Black woman's perspective may want to read LaJoyce Brookings' autobiography.

3.  THERE'S SOMETHING THAT ANNOYED ME. A lot of the people filmed had their faces blurred.  The camera purposely used blurry movements so the viewer couldn't see some of the actions taking place by people in the camera's range.  The DL brothas speak in low, mumbly tones so you could barely hear what they are saying.  From an aesthetic perspective, this may have given a visual imagery to a topic that is meant to be so secret.  But if you are a viewer that likes to be given all the facts and have a better chance to come up with your own conclusions, then you may hate a lot of this.

4.  MISCELLANEOUS STUFF.  Other discussions of DL have implied that DL brothas avoid openly gay men like the plague.  The four men here never suggest that being gay and being DL are mutually exclusive.  In a lot of ways, ""down low"" just means ""closeted.""  In ""Boundaries of Blackness,"" Dr. Cathy Cohen said the MSM term is frustrating because MSM often get busy with openly gay men.  Remember when J.L. King said to Oprah, ""Will & Grace and Queer as Folk don't matter because they concern whites, not blacks!""?  Some say that DL brothas get down only intraracially.  Some say DL is a response to not just Black homophobia, but also to white gay racism.  The legal book ""Hybrid"" makes mention of this.  In other words, DL may come from the thought that ""White gays exclude us and Black straights would punish us if they knew the real deal, so this is how we'll negotiate those two things.""  Here, there seemed to be more interracial action that one might imagine.  Don't get me wrong:  this wasn't like the infuriating ""Brother to Brother"" where no Black male couples were present.  There are brotha-loving brothas here.  It's just that there are more whites here than some may imagine.  Finally, I think bisexual activists may have a lot to say about this.  These men never suggest that liking men equates to not liking women.  They never say, ""I'm so proud and excited that others don't know the real me!""  They seem to be suggesting that liking men may prevent them from getting with women, so they just keep that side of them under wraps.  If there were more acceptance of bisexual males, then maybe DL-ness would not be so widespread.",1224288000,20,3950,4.545454545454546
3424258,3,B00197POYA,"Documentary focusing on four young men as they choose to or not choose to come out to family and friends. One of the young men gives his definition of ""on the down low"", which easily fits in the common sense category. Stereotypes are the exception rather than the rule these days. One of the young men bounces back and forth between women and drag queens. Don't expect black and white answers to a complex, gray area of sexual attraction. The answer as to why some people have same sex attraction, whereas others do not, given the same circumstances, is still a mystery.

3424261,3,B00197POYA,"Alright let me say this for those who still like swimming in that river called DeNial. If you do anything with someone of the same sex you are gay. I don't care if you suck or he just suck, you take it or yo are giving. Once with a man it is called being gay. Covering up by marrying or being with a woman to have some kids to look normal is just wrong. You have no respect to that woman because you go do your side piece without protection , then come home and have sex with your wife/girlfriend unprotected. NO EXCUSE. Let it be the woman's choice if she wants to be with you but you should be upfront and let them know instead of finding out when they get their results from a doctor.",1361404800,,687,4.021897810218978

And I didn't get the blurry effect, I seriously thought something happened to my DVD player. Honestly, I think I would have preferred hearing from ""real"" DL guys who really wanted to protect their anonymity by hiding behind a screen. I think they would have felt comfortable telling what it's really like to be on the DL, without fearing any repercussion. Also, though this movie depict men of African decent, I hope the viewers understand being on the DL has no racial boundaries...all races and cultures are included in this phenomena.",1338336000,,700,4.653225806451613
