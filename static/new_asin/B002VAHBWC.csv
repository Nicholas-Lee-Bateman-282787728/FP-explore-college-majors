8381801,1,B002VAHBWC,Total waste of money.  Terrible quality.  Made a beautiful women look bad.  Nothing at all appealing about it.  Bad news.,1334707200,6,121,4.9
8381802,1,B002VAHBWC,"Here we go again, another dvd of rubbish, and it is also silent with that
music I so love not to hear. Right from the second it started it was out of
focus, poor copping, washed-out, and very grainy. It looks like a copy from
a copy, from a copy, and so on.

It starts off with 2 women (one I could tell had big breasts) getting it off
on the bed. If the close-ups were any closer I would have seen a blank screen,
which would be a blessing for the eyes at least. Where is the fast-forward
button? I will admit it looks better on pause, but you have to start it
rolling again again.

The second scene is at a bath-tub (I can't tell what colour it is as it is
yellow from one angle and so white from another I had to put sun-glasses on
for a few seconds). Candy Samples didn't know whether to have a bath or get
off. I just wish she would hurry up so the next short would start.

In the next one Uschi Digard didn't know what to do. One minute she on the
bed, then standing, then on the bed again. There is one part I enjoyed,
the close-up of her mouth. I thought I got a glimpse of her tonsils.

I loved the next short. Candy was doing her exercises on the swing in the
lounge-room for a few seconds, the hand weights, the ones you squeeze in
your hand. I don't know if she moved them at all, I'm not sure, couldn't
see properly. The exercises go on until she decides to have an oil bath
while sitting on the sofa-bed. At least I could see most of this one.

Next Uschi is sitting on a stool in a wrap-round dress on, and gave new
meaning to getting undressed. What got me was something on the side of
view swinging about. It looked like a giant fly. Uschi looks 100% better
than Candy does.

I'm reviewing each short as I see them so I can stay awake. This one is
with a man, but the film is so poor it's anyone's guess what they are
doing. From the bits I can see, they are on a bed teasing each other
with her breasts. I have to fast-forward to the next one, sorry.

Candy is near a river,comes home and relaxes with a glass of red, spills
a drop on her breasts and gets excited, so out comes the lotion. My
brain is starting to melt by now and I'm having trouble understanding
why she put a breast into a wine cooler full of ice.

Next is B/W and is impaired by the quality of the video. This guy is
joined by 1, 2, 3 women at once, my mistake, 4 women on the one bed.
I'm glad I'm not the bed, my knees would be starting to bow by now.
Same old story. Crappy quality, not much going on, oh no!, another
woman, that makes 5. What more could a man ask for? Lots of energy and
get up and go.

When I thought it was the end, there was more. God help me. There is a
black woman on a bed, a woman reading a book and starts to play with her
nightie. The camera flashes are starting again. Last there are two women
stripping off and I'm glad because the film is all orange and impossible
to tell the colour of the first woman's dress. When it finished I was
brain-dead for a few minutes as I couldn't believe it had finished.

On the back of the dvd it states ""RETRO HOOTERAMA will be a welcome
addition to any big bust retro collection."" The only addition it
would be useful to is the collection of a crazed maniac who hasn't seen
a woman for 100 years.

If I was paying for this dribble to be made I would get the director,
the editor, and the cameraman, and impale them on a 6 foot pole, for
this rubbish.

I'm going to have to find a way to get the label off these discs and
give them to the dog next door to play with, because I'm sure I'll
never be watching them again, and no will buy them off me. Maybe the
army could buy them to use to torture their prisoners. Ten minutes of
them and anyone would confess to anything.",1300147200,12,3724,3.9772117962466487
8381803,3,B002VAHBWC,Of Uschi  will like this one.... but wading through a bunch of slapped together clips isn't what you'd call a great time.,1277942400,6,121,4.5
