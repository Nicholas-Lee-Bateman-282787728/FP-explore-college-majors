I will await its dvd release.",1196553600,6,243,4.4
724391,5,6303921981,"This movie should be available on DVD-excellent story, great acting by James Woods in a prison movie--check out Kay Lenz--she was some hot chick back when this movie was made.  Great scenes of lovemaking between Woods and Lenz.  The movie is very very good. Copies of this movie are hard to find so get it when you find it...",1106784000,9,325,4.491525423728813
724392,5,6303921981,"A bit like ""Blood Simple"" for plot twists, this movie lets Woods do his smart guy thing within a fine plot and with excellent supporting characters.  This is not as simple a movie as the front page reviews indicate ... there is a lot going on.  Woods thinks he is helping an inmate  escape; he is not. This is a first rate film and, for the price, should be  in your library.  Hard to find in video stores.  Woods is an excellent  actor and this movie lets him act.",939081600,19,465,4.157303370786517

724588,2,6303921981,"Filmed in the early 80s with a great cast including Emmett Walsh and Susan Tyrell, the movie is a mess. Tim McIntyre, son of the great John McIntyre, pontificates nonstop. I love James Woods but this film does him no favors. Even the director, James B Harris, can be seen to MUCH better advantage in his first film The Bedford Incident.

724590,5,6303921981,"This is one of my little treasures that I was sure was never going to come on DVD. It is more than a little dated now but for its time it was smart, edgy, not to mention sexually charged.",1377734400,2,187,3.8205128205128207
724591,5,6303921981,"So glad this is one is out on DVD. Directed by early Kubrick producer James B. Harris, who adapted Ernest Brawley's 1974 novel for the screen.

Top notch cast of character actors the likes of which haven't been seen since the Warner Brothers or Paramount studio days of the '40s, all in support of a brilliant turn by James Woods, polishing the dissolute hustler character he was soon to own. His corruptible prison guard, ""'Fast-Walking' Miniver,"" working all the angles on both sides of the walls, not realizing that he is himself being played by forces way above his pay-grrade. The cast includes the taken-too-soon Tim McIntire, Kay Lenz, M. Emmet Walsh, Susan Tyrrell and Timothy Agoglia Carey, the Dennis Hopper of his day, who Harris wisely turns loose to stretch his acting legs.

The is a fun movie of the trashy variety but raised way above that level by Harris' adaptation and direction. (Probably little of the source material remains.)",1300924800,6,948,4.881987577639752
724592,5,6303921981,"I agree with the previous reviewers comments. Having been a favorite from years ago in VHS format. If ever there was a case to be made for a remaster to DVD,this would be at the top of the list. A super good view,fast action paced film. Highly recommended!",1266019200,2,256,4.354166666666667

7854717,5,6303921981,"Tuned into this movie on the late show (remember those?) on good old network TV back in the day, and all I could recall was that it starred James Woods and that it looked good but I had to go punch in for the midnight shift so you know how that goes.

Now here I find it again, thanks to browsing the bottomless Amazon film section (and to all the others who wrote reviews), and...BINGO I sez, this is THAT movie!

Looks even better now, pristine print from Warner Brothers Archive Collection. I've found their DVD-R releases to be of the most dependable quality, and I'm just happy to be able to see the whole 1982 movie in this beautiful of shape in any format.

Robert Hooks plays the newly-sentenced African-American heavy who exudes ""fight the power"". I had just re-watched ""aloha bobby and rose"" (1975) recently, so I recognized Tim McIntire (who was subtly menacing in that film) here playing the repulsively scripture-twisting racist control-freak whom free-wheeling, fully-inhaling prison-guard ""Fast-Walking"" Miniver (Woods) has to contend with.

You should also know that this stars Susan Tyrrell AND Timothy Carey, both in smaller parts, but always welcome in any performance. Kay Lenz is the female lead, and has she ever let us down?

To give away anything more would be criminal, so I'll just say that if you are a fan of off-beat, post-70's filmmaking, you will probably be at home watching this in your living room. I also liked that the entire movie didn't overuse the lockup-as-claustrophobia theme, which to me can get a bit tiresome in prison-based films (as in ""I get it already, taking away a person's ability to exercise their free will is psychological punishment""), but added perspective to much of the proceedings due to the multi-layered plot.

This one is a keeper, and I'm glad to know that it will be worth revisiting again in the future.",1503792000,,1869,4.806853582554517

7854719,4,6303921981,"James Woods opens FAST WALKING smoking a joint (very well, it must be added) while driving his car talking to fellow prison guard.  Just this opening scene alone prepares the viewer for a solid acting performance from a man who was destined to be considered one of the best, unconventional leading men in the biz whether playing smart, intense, or crazed.
A personal favorite actor of mine (if made to choose) this is probably the movie that confirmed (1981) James Woods was not gonna be a flash in the pan.
James Woods is Frank ""Fast Walking"" Miniver a prison guard (filmed in Montana prison) who dreams of a big score and a dream move to ""Communal land in Oregon"".  Besides the prison job (he does not like) he helps run a small store with a brothel of 2 women to make extra money.  In walks the sexiest, non-glamorous actress to work this side of Hollywood not named Ellen Barkin, portrayed here by Kay Lenz, and the plot quickly kicks-in and shifts and shapes FAST-WALKING into a twist and turn or two that made me consider The Sting for a moment.  Is ""Moke"" (Lenz) a prostitute?  Desperate?  Does she really like ""Fast Walking""?
One thing that is interesting about James Woods is he has never been one to shy from the idea the person he portrays may not always be that appealing, yet, soon reveals the humor and intensity of someone who is always believable as we wait to see if Fast Walking Miniver will do the right thing -- which we more than suspect he will.  Or at least TRY too.
No sooner do we find out Frank Miniver is the best shot ""In the Yard"", that a ""Contract"" has been placed on recent prisoner arrival ""Galleo"" (Robert Hooks, ""Trouble Man"")  who is too impressive to the rest of the ""black"" prison population to live.  The Warden seems to agree with this.
Who is Galleo?  Why is he so important?

Well respected character actor M. Emmet Walsh appears working with (sort of) Frank Miniver at the prison. Tim McIntire has a well-written, demanding role as a prisoner doing 3-10 who happens to be Miniver's (Woods) cousin.  Oscoe (McIntire) runs drugs within the prison as does the always unusual Timothy Carey(!) (good to see him this late in his career).

""When pulling a scam!  When you got the pigeon on a slow schuck!  You gotta do whatever makes the sucker happy!""
Words of wisdom by Fast Walking (""Damn you Fast Talkin"").
Yes, someone is being conned here, but who?
James B. Harris (""Cop"" -- with Woods also; ""Boiling Point"" -- need to see, again, now) wrote and directed this adult, shady prison life movie, that has a running 'gag' involving panicky warden and a race war:  ""Ohhh, don't say that!""
There are no xtras but this Warner Bros Archive Collection picture is Widescreen and looks like a good minor, collector's item, belated, cult-hit movie should.
