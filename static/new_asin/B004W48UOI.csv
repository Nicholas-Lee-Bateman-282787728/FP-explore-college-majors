8444351,4,B004W48UOI,Every once in a while I see a movie that really resonates with me. I watched this with a few friends and we all got sucked in by the concept and plot.  Highly entertaining.,1368921600,,172,4.0588235294117645
8444352,4,B004W48UOI,"I watched it all the way to the end, and I didn't think it was that bad.  The twist at the end was cool.  It is an indy film, so don't expect a huge budget movie, but if you like low budget films, this one was great.",1312156800,2,216,3.574468085106383
8444353,1,B004W48UOI,"This movie definitely is not Hollywood status.

I literally sat there for 10 painstaking minutes trying to watch it but it wasn't possible for me.
Why I spent Instant Video credits on this I have no idea.",1311033600,,204,4.513513513513513
