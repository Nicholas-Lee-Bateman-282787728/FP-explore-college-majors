film because you are a fan of any of the actors or because you know of
someone on the spectrum, this film is worth seeing.",1192233600,4,340,4.683333333333334

2809984,5,B000P46OV0,"Thank goodness.  Finally a leading role providing a small sample of Alan Rickman's depth without handing him yet another bad guy.  The film touches many nerves, is sensitive and illustrates the worth of people with disabilities.  Weaver is excellent and without vanity.  Rickman allows his tender, sensitive, and insecure side to be glimpsed.  This film deserved a wide release and Oscar attention.  As in nearly all Rickman choices, the audience has a responsibility to think as part of the total experience.",1190592000,4,509,5.222222222222222
2809985,5,B000P46OV0,"I bought this movie merely on the premisis that Alan Rickman is in it. I do like Sigourney Weaver, too, and even if there was an actor/actress in it that I didn't care for, I still would have bought it just for Alan Rickman.

Well, I'm glad I did. The movie was excellent. I don't even know what to categorize it as; it was so different. Alan Rickman was truly amazing in it, I don't know why he wasn't nominated for anything for it. His character was such a good guy, had a big heart, and of course he was handsome as ever.

I don't want to spoil the plot at all, but if you are an Alan Rickman fan, I highly suggest this movie!",1190073600,,629,4.024
2809986,5,B000P46OV0,"This movie was fascinating and full of little surprises that made me laugh and cry alternately.  One of the unique aspects of Snow Cake is that the cast is made up of sci-fi/action heavyweights!  Sigourney Weaver is all too used to dousing slimy aliens with flamethrowers; Alan Rickman generally chews scenery as the sorcerer Severus Snape; and Carrie-Anne Moss will go down in history as the leather-clad, cool-shades-donning femme fatale of the Matrix trilogy.  Yet here we get to see an overwhelmingly tender and subtle side to these actors, who are all absolutely brilliant in a small drama as well as their usual big box office outings.  I urge anyone who has an interest in the human condition to watch this movie.",1189641600,6,720,4.877049180327869
2809987,4,B000P46OV0,"My name is Andre Jonathan, and I had the pleasure to see the premiere screening with the Cast,Director, and Writer of this movie at the 2006 Tribeca Film Festival. In addition, I was chosen from a few to comment, and ask a question to Sigourney Weaver personally during the Q&A. Moreover, my comment and question,along with my presentation I guess,to my surprise, was the only one to get applause and laughter from the audiance;in which Ms. Weaver's response was ""that's a tough and interesting question to answer"",and then she began elaborating for at least three(3)minuets to my question/comment). I don't quite remember what I said per se, but it had something to do with her advertent and/or inadvertent comedic skills I thought she displayed in a serious character role as an autistic woman! By the way, I thought the movie was touching, moving, serious, semi-provocative, and at times ackwardly funny! Furthermore, the overall CAST was COMPLIMENTRY & GREAT!!

Thanks,

It's about a man who meets a young girl who needs a lift to her mothers ...without giving away to much, through this experience he finds himself. Great movie if you love Alan Rickman a must.

2809989,5,B000P46OV0,"I saw this movie on PPV and had been waiting for it a long time.  I initially wanted to see it because of Alan Rickman (Alec).  He was wonderful as usual, but his real genius in this film was to sit back and let Sigourney Weaver (Linda) play off of him.  Not that Rickman didn't have his moments, but Weaver was really outstanding.  In one scene, Alec is sobbing uncontrollably and Linda looks at him quizzically and asks if there is something wrong with the tea.  That's just one little gem of a scene.

Don't look for romantic fireworks or a dramatic ending in this movie.  It's just the story of three people with their own secrets brought together by a tragic event.  I found myself drawn into their lives, as they were drawn into each other's lives.

Once you see this movie, you will understand why I say it was ""dalzious.""",1182556800,46,829,4.401315789473684

2809995,5,B000P46OV0,"Alan Rickman was my celebrity crush and this movie shows exactly why. So well acted and beautifully presented. Rickman portrays a man who has suffered the same type of tragic loss twice in his life. The 2nd time, which is the springboard event for this film, is during a car wreck in which his passenger does not survive. A decent man, wracked with survivor guilt, Rickman's character goes to the passengers mother's home to connect and perhaps find some level of absolution.

Surprise. Mother is a high-functioning autistic. Rickman's character now has a whole other level of emotional confusion with which to define, cope and include. Sigourney Weaver did an amazing job in this well-researched role. The story, to be clear, is about Rickman's character, not autism. But it is through this vehicle that  the character's interactions reveal each other's internal struggles and capabilities to overcome. The film has funny moments, tragic moments, romantic moments and is all-around totally engaging. Lovely Canadian winter scenery sets a background that allows the characters to be prominent throughout the film.

This film was not a box-office smash. I do not know if it even had a broad release at any time. But it is one of Rickman's most beautiful character portrayals, putting on display his vast talent to portray deep emotional communication in his eyes and body language. Weavers performance was of a depth I did not know she possessed, having only seen her previously in more ""block-buster"" type movie roles in which her characters are far more one-dimensional.  I highly, highly recommend curling up with some hot chocolate on a quiet night and getting lost in the beauty of this story.

And -  ""Snow cake"" is revealed at the end :)",1470355200,5,1743,5.013840830449827
2809996,2,B000P46OV0,"Snow Cake
 One hour and 52 minutes of fine acting cannot over come what for me ended up in a pointless, even nihilistic film.  At the end I asked myself 'what did I just see?'.  It shows us a dramatic slice of the lives of four interesting people and then ends with no conclusion or closure.  We sort of look into some ones window for a while and then meander away.
 The acting however really is great.  Alan Rickman plays a troubled guy just out of prison who is traveling by car through Ontario to Winnipeg.  He picks up a hitchhiker on her way to Wawa, a small Ontario town.  The pair are immediately struck by a huge logging truck and the girl dies.  The jail bird, in a fit of moral goodness, takes it upon himself to go to Wawa to take the personal effects of the dead girl to her mom to somehow bring a portion of solace in her time of grief.
 He quickly discovers that the mom (Sigourney Weaver in a spectacular bit of acting) suffers from Autism.  She can function on her own but goodness, she is very messed up.  Writer Angela Pell in her single feature length script used her own experience with an autistic son for her inspiration.
 Rickman finds himself drawn in the bizarre life of the mom against his will.  He tries to help her as best he can.  In the meantime  he meets Carry Ann Moss, a neighbor, and a quiet little love story evolves.  All this stuff is interesting in a mild way and the acting is very much worth watching.
 Then the jailbird leaves and it is over.
 Welshman Mark Evans directed with unspectacular competence.
 This two star movie took in only a million dollars world wide.  Evans filmed it in 27 days in Wawa Ontario.",1470096000,2,1654,4.305194805194805

2810001,5,B000P46OV0,"This is a film that will not age, at least not really. It is the second film on the subject of autism that has the status of a classic. The first one was Dustin Hoffmans Rain Man. This one centers on the same problem, autism, but for a woman, which is a minority case for this disease. The situation is slightly more complicated because it starts with the daughter of this autistic mother and we will only learn later in the film, close to the end, from her own parents themselves that at the time no one understood what actually happened though her father believes she must have been forced, which is in no way certain though, because the idea of an experiment might be just right. The man must then have taken advantage of the curiosity and of the experiment.

The beginning of the film is dramatic because of a road accident in which a truck rams into a car and kills the daughter of Linda, the autistic mother, hitchhiking to visit her mother. Then the driver of the car goes to Lindas to try to explain her what happened and we discover in a few days spent there till the day after the funeral what kind of a life this autistic person is having in her community. And thats where we are surprised. She has a job in a supermarket in phase with her handicap: she puts merchandise on the racks, items that have to be set in rows and well aligned. Nothing difficult but something she can do without any problem.

She is a very solitary person, meaning that she often closes herself onto herself and lives in her own world. She does not reject the outside world. She just retires inside her own mental world. In this Wawa town the neighbors know about her and they all take care of her, look after her, without ever invading her privacy. She accepts that help though she would never solicit it, though she does for the garbage from the driver of the car in which her daughter was killed and she has invited to stay in her home for a few days. She does not always thank people for that help, though she does in her own way. It is true some people do not understand that and try to invade that personal field and bring her back into some normal behavior. But these are very fast put back in their places and told not to meddle.

In a way, when everything is organized very clearly she can cope with life that becomes a routine and she can even cope with things that come unwanted and unannounced and that she integrates in her routine. Thats the real interest of this film. To explore Lindas  personal mental world, which we will never be able to know for sure since she does not explain and express that inner world, but we can explore it through what she does, her reactions, her actions, her own ways to cope with a situation that is maybe beyond her own comprehension, at least a comprehension of our type. The situation is serious since it is the death and funeral of her own daughter. She has a room entirely dedicated to her and she reacts in such a way that we know she knows it is important but she cannot mourn or grieve the way we do. She will just start dancing on a music her daughter liked and the film maker makes us understand at this moment she dances with her own daughter though she only dances with herself in our own eyes.

Is it truly what happens? We cannot know.

The only important thing is that autistic people must not be institutionalized but must be provided with living conditions that enable them to have an active, and even productive, life adapted to their own means, their own interests, their own capabilities. Of course it is the capabilities they can invest in our social and economic life, but that enables them to have the time and the autonomy necessary to live their mental life in some kind of freedom under the loving and attentive care of people around who are there to help, not to command, govern or control.

One thing is missing in the film. Linda has a full calendar for the month of April with her schedule properly written day after day. We assume she can read but it is not said that she must have a social worker who helps her write down the schedule of the month. The film though assumes she can read and maybe write, but there is no visual indication that she can actually do it: she does not write and she does not read in the film. The film is already old and today we have discovered that computers can help tremendously because autistic people might be limited in oral and written communication, but they can be trained into computer literacy and that enables them to communicate a lot better, even to express their feelings and their experience, though we are not advanced enough to be able to say if it is true for all autistic people, though we can say that the earlier the better and in the US they diagnose the disease as soon as 6 months and start acting on it as soon as they have such a diagnosis.

As the film is sad, sweet, and heartbreaking, so is the loss of the great Alan Rickman.

2810037,5,B000P46OV0,"One of the very few movies to concentrate on how someone with autism functions as an adult. Sigourney Weaver astounds in the role of Linda, switching from childlike innocence to blunt honesty, from freaking out during normal situations to offering surprisingly lucid words of wisdom, it's a travesty she was not nominated for an Oscar for her performance. Equally amazing is the, well ALWAYS amazing, Alan Rickman, another performance that was more than worthy of an Oscar. The character of Alex invokes such an amazing amount of pathos as we are taken through his journey through the eyes of Linda, Maggie, Vivienne, and the local townspeople. Carrie Moss does another fine turn in her role, almost a gypsy-like woman in a small town....it's no wonder Alex makes his assumptions about her based on what Linda had told him! It's also interesting to see the well-meaning yet almost embarrassing platitudes offered up to Linda throughout the film. All in all, this movie is an underrated, underappreciated gem that deserved far more attention than it did, headed up by two phenomenal performances that, IMNSHO, should have been nominated for just about every major award possible.",1354233600,,1178,5.108808290155441

But this is a movie that is worth watching more than once, there are little nuances that one picks up each time it is viewed.  The casting was marvelous and the end, well...let's just say that the end ""speaks"".

As for the DVD itself, I do not know if it was this particular DVD or the pressing of the DVD but the first chapter the voices were out off sync with the visuals.  I at first thought that this might be something that the director cooked up as an additional commentary as the second chapter was in sync.  It turns out that this DVD does not play well with Blu-Ray players; when I switched it over to a DVD player the audio and visual were both in perfect sync.  I've never had this issue before; but, I usually watch DVD's on one of my DVD players...though all of those had DVD's already loaded and bookmarked for watching.",1345680000,,959,4.241758241758242

2810043,5,B000P46OV0,"Let me say, just up front, that when I watched this on television I was almost compelled to switch channels.

I simply don't like romantic or sentimental (tear-jerking) movies.

But it was a slow night, nothing else to watch, except the same-o, same-o cop drama here and there,... so I braced myself for a boring and well-planned travel through sentimental-land, with all the buttons pushed at the right time, to force you to squeeze your tear ducts in your eyes.

Mind you, I like everything that has Alan Rickman, Sigourney Weaver or Carrie-Anne Moss, in it, but I was wondering why these three would congregate to make a ""romantic drama"".

At first, at the opening of the movie (a bit slow-paced for my taste), nothing new on the western horizon. Nice landscape, a diner and two odd characters meeting (one of them being Alan Rickman). Location? Canada. Season? Well, you may have guessed by the title, that it might be winter. Snow? Yes.

A brief conversation, or better said, monologue of the two characters ensues. So far, so good.

One might think at this point that that's it. Older man meets much younger woman and a pathetic story gets told once again. Wrong!

What happens next, within the ten minute rule of movie-land (if nothing happens within a ten minute span, you can leave the theater or the room and switch off the TV). Well, as I was about to do so, lo and behold, Bang! Big Badda-Bing, Badda-Bang!

A car crash! In a movie like this? Yes. A huge truck rams the man's car and this is the actual beginning of the picture.

The rest unfolds while we accompany the man's ordeal through it all.

I won't reveal what happens next because that's the part you absolutely have to watch for yourselves, and anything further would reveal the entire mystery of the plot. Yes, because the man has a secret, a terrible secret he is trying to keep at any cost.

Suffice it to say that I as dumb as a bell. I missed it when showing in the theaters in 2006 and I could kick myself for this. How could I have missed a tiny gem like this? Then I remembered that I even missed ""Truly, Madly, Deeply"" many years before and had the same revelation on TV afterward. That teaches you only one thing. One never really learns from his own mistakes, at least not when one is as lazy and as jaded as I am...

Let me just say that if you think to have known Sigourney Weaver as an actress before, well, think again... If you haven't seen her work in this movie, you simply cannot appreciate the great professional talent she has and the true gamut she can span when allowed to do so.

Of course, she already revealed herself as a very skillful comedian in ""Galaxy Quest"" (also co-starring with Alan Rickman), but here she hits the high note of her entire career, blasting all the crystals in the house.

She portrays and reproduces an autistic woman in every detail. So much so, that at times it becomes disturbing. It must have been the most difficult role she ever played. I am thinking about the research she had to undertake in order to slip in her role. I was astonished and very pleasantly surprised by her.

Carrie-Anne Moss, is the romantic interest of Alan Rickman in this movie and one may believe that this is it... Again wrong! The woman can sparkle with just a few nuances, without ever stealing the show, but just because of this, she becomes an important and integral figure to the plot, without whom the outcome would be difficult to foresee. Her harsh traits, so well known in the ""Matrix"" movies, can reveal an astonishing feminine beauty, as well as a smile and a laughter that can carry you away to seventh heaven.

Alan Rickman, the face of stone, or is it? I love him in everything he does. His wry, slashing, straight-face humor is simply unique and can be admired in so many movies. In ""Snow Cake"" he pushes the envelope further, always with very subtle touches, just like a few twitches of the eyes, a dismissing raising of an eyebrow, a touch of disappointment with the corner of the mouth. One has to closely watch the mechanics of his face to understand what a refined actor this man is.

What can I say of Emily Hampshire, except maybe that she will make a terrific career for herself along the years? It is not easy to be the center of a movie without being in it throughout the story. Yet, this is exactly what she manages to do. Her looks, the way she played her role, the entire aura that she manages to broadly paint before our own eyes of who she is and what she does, cannot so simply be forgotten. In fact, her ghost image keeps on coming back in our own minds every time someone mentions her. It's just like saying: ""Don't think Elephant!"" and keeping seeing the elephant in our minds.

Of course much credit goes to the casting of this movie. All characters must have been painstakingly be chosen and hand picked. But especially the role that Emily Hampshire had to cover, must have had that special attention, because if this role fails, the entire movie's construct falls apart and crashes miserably.

I must also mention the screenplay and the editing of this movie, without which we would not be sitting here, me writing this, and you reading it. The screenplay must have been very special when handed to the actors, since they seem all so very comfortable with it (even though I realize that it must have been quite a study). The editing was made in such a way as never to bore the audience with useless details, but rather build story upon story, upon story, just to form a flowing river of information one can easily digest and admire.

The director Marc Evans, must have had a hell of a time to coordinate the entire action and make sense of it all, but one can tell that he had confidence with the subject and manages to deliver a finished product that is a tiny masterpiece.

I titled my review ""The science of forgiveness... and understanding."" and indeed that's the juice of this movie. It is much less a love story, than a human story, a story of human destinies clashing, bumping, crashing, landing, walking and ultimately explaining themselves through the art, or if you will, science of forgiveness and understanding. A lesson and a story we can all identify ourselves with.

OK. Now that I have spent my time spending my Summa Cum Laude to these gifted actors and actresses, as well to all the off-screen personnel, I can only tell you one thing, if you think you know a movie by the title, or because you have read about it, well, think again. One must watch them before being able to judge them. Some may even reveal themselves as gems of movie making.

""Snow Cake"" can certainly be considered one of them.

Now to the DVD. I own both the UK pressed and the US version of this and I must say that both are worth owning. Despite the slight differences in color resolution and the obvious running length that varies due to the different PAL and NTSC frame speeds, nothing else can be said that would prevent you to buy this movie. The sound on both is crystal clear, and for once, may I add, you are not overwhelmed by intruding and pervasive music from wall to wall.
There is music, but it is kept at a reasonable volume and not constant throughout the picture. For my understanding, this is a sure buy.",1328054400,6,7252,4.497338403041825

I had kept talking about this actor, Alan Rickman since I became a fan through Harry Potter. We even re-watched Die Hard and Robin Hood. I believe now that my whole family is an Alan Rickman fan because of Snowcake.  It shocked us right off the bat, sweet scenes then kaboom!!

2810046,3,B000P46OV0,"I don't know. Maybe I've seen too many of this type of drama, but these are getting more difficult to sit through. This is not at all a bad movie. In fact it's quite good. But there isn't much here you haven't already seen before.

Here's the scoop. Rickman is fresh out of prison on a murder rap. He's on his way to see his late son's mother (who is not his wife) and allows a quirky little sprite of a girl to grab a ride with him. Horrible accident. Girl dies. He's beside himself with grief and heads to her home to tell her mom who turns out to be an autistic Sigourney Weaver. He ends up getting caught up in her life and the lives of some of the other locals.

Rickman is his usual good self. I like Sigourney Weaver enough but she really does a good job here. This is a very different roll for her and I'm glad she took it on. I'd never have guessed she had this much in her. I'd pay to watch Carrie-Anne Moss eat cornflakes so I cannot really comment on her performance here. Everyone else does a stand up job. The production values aren't high but they don't let the bones show. The music is good. Most of the songs are from Canada's ""Broken Social Scene."" It also has one really wild song in a key scene that might be a Japanese folk song 'Notteru Ondo.""

This is not new. A person needs to get his/her life back after some tragedy and ends up in an unexpected situation that helps him/her do just that. The kick here is the Weaver character. Where I thought it might be her daughter performing the life affirming task it ends up being Sigourney herself. That does work in unexpected ways, but much of the rest of the script outline is formulaic. You've seen some of these scenes before. Some, more than a few times. Yes, it's done well but it's not new. And it's more than a bit slow. It clocks in just shy of two hours and I was getting antsy.

If you enjoy these kinds of movies this is not at all a bad watch, but if you're groing tired of them you might want to take a pass.",1306195200,2,1990,4.121134020618556
2810047,5,B000P46OV0,"Loved this movie. When I saw it on big screen it left a huge emotional impact, less traumatic viewing of one particular scene on small screen. An insight into autism, beautiful relationships that develop during the film, a lot of underlying humour. Thoroughly recommend viewing.",1298764800,,278,5.2
2810048,4,B000P46OV0,"Some have commented that this film didn't quite do it. ""It"" being, I assume, the usual heart warming effect of a tragedy redeemed by human goodness. Well, I guess the plot might lead one to look for that effect in that is is essentially about a ""full-of-life young woman killed senselessly and how those she had touched must deal with her loss.""

But the real power of this film is that there is an organic unfolding of all the characters in gentle and satisfying ways. The Rickman character is ""redeemed"" in a slow and unremarkable way through his self deprecating courage, the Weaver character moves from a stereotypical persona to a complex human with her own way of grieving, and the Moss character evolves from an equally stereotypical persona to something almost sage-like. And all the supporting characters are equally satisfying in the way they start as ""type-cast"" elements and become real human beings by the end.

There are salient moments which are not sappy or saccharine, and there are true insights into loss and the way life moves on, and the hope there is in imperfect people who never the less want to help each other.

But the real wonder of the movie is the way these seasoned actors can take lines that could sound trite or cliche in the mouths of lesser actors and deliver them naturally and intimately and in so doing create a quiet dynamism that feels authentic and hopeful.

I was surprised to find so many Amazon reviews of this low tempo film but I guess the big name actors and the quality of the direction worked together to create a real winner that obviously speaks to some core needs in us videophiles.

I certainly need to hear/see more stories like this in which people, in all their ordinary uniqueness, connect and relate in a way that celebrates our humanity without being predictable and formulaic. I think that is what I liked most about the film. Numerous times I thought, ""oh, here comes the scene were such and such happens,"" and it didn't, I was wrong. This refusal to be predictable was a big part of the film's success.",1298678400,,2064,4.65934065934066

Alan Rickman plays a man accidently involved with her and plays his role superbly. Rickman is rarely given enough credit for his film portrayals. The first I saw of him was in a role opposite Juliet Stevenson called ""Truly, Madly,Deeply"".

The only other actress i've seen do so well with this type of role  is Isabelle Huppert of France in a film titled 'The Piano Teacher"". ""The Piano Teacher"" is a much darker tale however.",1293494400,,705,4.907563025210084
2810050,3,B000P46OV0,"Continuing with my 'wintery' theme in movies lately, I added this small, quirky joint UK-Canada feature to my list. Alan Rickman (whom I adore) is in relatively few films, so he was the main draw here. Sigourney Weaver can be brilliant depending on the material (""Alien""; ""Working Girl""), or she can be a collection of patented mannerisms, it all depends. This performance hit somewhere in the middle for me. (**Mild Spoilers**) She plays Linda, an autistic woman living in a small Canadian town where her eccentricities are well-known & mostly tolerated by neighbors, though the local cab company refuses any more calls to Linda's address. Rickman plays Alec, a sad, private man who we first meet sitting alone at a roadside diner with a book. A vivacious young hitchiker comes in, invites herself to sit at a Alec's table & asks him for a ride. Alec tells his new passenger that he just got released from prison and says ""I just wanted you to be aware that it's the average-looking people you have to be careful of."" Before he can reveal more of himself, a careless truck driver rams into them, killing the girl instantly. Racked with guilt, Alec makes the journey to see her mother, none other than Linda, & these two form a very odd couple as he winds up staying at Linda's home for several days to help her with funeral arrangements for her daughter.

Linda is a high-functioning autistic, extremely verbal but held hostage by her various tics, which manifest in obsessions about germs and dirt & continual straightening things around her home. Only a few things give her joy & distract her from her compulsions: 'sparklies'--toys with light & movement; jumping on her backyard trampline & eating snow. She is matter-of-fact about her loss: ""I didn't lose her; she's dead,"" she tells one neighbor. Linda was extremely dependent on her daughter, but any maternal grief she feels has to fight its way out of the layers of her neuroses. In fact, of greatest concern to her is that Alec stick around until Tuesday . .not because the funeral is on Monday, but because Tuesday is garbage day and ""I don't do garbage. Vivienne always took care of the garbage.""

It's a committed, energetic & completly vanity-free performance by Weaver, with Rickman functioning as the 'neurotypical' representative of the audience. Since he is a deeply broken man who has been isolated from socieity for years, only someone as dysfunctional as Linda could actually make him feel normal again. We've had a long tradition in cinema of 'normal' actors playing characters with intellectual disabilities: Dustin Hoffman as Rain Man; Cliff Robertson as 'Charly'; Mary Stuart Masterson in ""Benny & Joon"", Hugh Dancy in ""Adam"", to name just a few. So Weaver's portrait of an autistic woman is as 'realistic' as a normal person can make it, but there will always be that artifice around it . . .maybe it is presumptuous in the extreme for the 'neurotypical' actors and scriptwriters & directors attempting a story about the intellectually-challenged to portray a facsimilie of a disorder they haven't experienced first-hand. Weaver's Linda lacks the endearing sweetness of Dustin Hoffman's Raymond, but perhaps is closer to a 'typical' sufferer of this disorder. Without having experience of autism in one's own life, this is probably as close as the viewer will get to it.

As is typical with most small-budget British and Canadian films, ""Snow Cake"" is an intimate portrait of only a few lives, not a big splashy canvas. It is quite slow-moving & its tone & production design is muted & realistic. I preferred ""Adam"" for a story with similar themes, but ""Snow Cake"" is worth a rental for fans of Rickman & Weaver.",1292889600,6,3688,4.888178913738019
2810051,3,B000P46OV0,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Snow Cake is a Canadian film which had many more favorable reviews than negative one's. I believe there is little argument that it was Sigourney Weaver's performance that drew people to the film, resulting in all the accolades. And I would agree that the single most compelling aspect of the film is the multi-layered character that Weaver plays: 'Linda', a fully functioning adult autistic woman. Linda seemed pretty believable to me as Weaver captures both the childlike simplicity of the character as well as the torment. The screenwriter, Angela Pell, certainly knows something about autism, since she raised an autistic son.

What's fascinating about Linda is that her emotional life is so bifurcated. On one hand, she's a simple child who is intimately connected to nature--the snow cake symbolizing the connection she feels to the earth--perhaps her greatest joy is to experience the snow melting in her mouth. But on the other hand, as an adult, she's unable to let herself be intimate with anyone who seeks to get close to her. She creates boundaries, such as not allowing anyone into her kitchen; and like all those who suffer from severe obsessive-compulsive disorder, resorts to maintaining order in the environment, in order to avoid contact with those who attempt to form a relationship with her. Even when she allows someone to touch her (when, for example, she asks Alex to 'hug' her), she insists that he wrap his arms around her without using his hands. There is an additional aspect that makes Linda such a rich character: her creativity. One of the most enjoyable moments in the film is when she plays scrabble with Alex, using only made-up words.

Vivienne, Linda's daughter, is also another fascinating character who we only meet briefly at the beginning of the film as she's soon killed in the accident. Rather than viewing Vivienne as having been ""damaged"" by the lack of a 'normal' mother figure, she's actually a young woman who's learned to cope in the face of a difficult upbringing. What's more, she's incorporated the positive, creative aspects of her mother's personality that makes her so endearing. Another very powerful moment in the film, is the father's eulogy of Vivienne, in which he conveys the strength of her character and the enormous sense of loss as a result of her tragic death.

Pell is less successful with the other characters in her film. Alex is also supposed to be 'damaged goods' as we eventually learn of his back story: he killed the man responsible for the death of the son he was on his way to meet for the first time. It's obvious why Pell has the emotionally stunted Alex on his way to a first meeting and not having met the son before: by depriving Alex of meeting the son, he loses his mind and kills the victim (a drunk driver) in a fit of rage. I wanted to find out more about Alex--instead , he's pretty much depicted as a one-note character, severely depressed due to his earlier loss of control as well as guilt over the death of Vivienne.

Alex overcomes his depression by reaching out and helping Linda. But he also moves forward through his relationship with Maggie, perhaps the least convincing character in the film. I just didn't get why Maggie would jump into bed so fast with Alex or why she's attracted to him at all. After all, it's not like she hasn't had other men in her life. What's more, she has no idea who this Alex character is. On the surface, it's obvious he's depressed. Maggie is the artificial love interest that also serves as an impetus to repair Alex's damaged soul. Indie dramas are littered with these saintly characters with their perennial 'hearts of gold'!

Aside from the saintly Maggie and Alex, along with Linda's loving parents, most of the rest of the townspeople come off as wholly unsympathetic as they feign tolerance and sympathy for Linda but behind her back secretly have contempt for her. In one of the deleted scenes on the DVD, a woman comes up to Alex in a McDonald's and compliments Alex on the good job he's been doing with her; Alex turns around and slyly tells the woman that Linda is his wife! I'm not sure why the scene was deleted but perhaps the director sensed that it was too didactic: the 'moral' Alex must teach a lesson to one of the uncaring townspeople. The idea of a collective group of uncaring townspeople as the films' collective 'antagonist' doesn't work precisely people are much more complicated and nuanced as the film's scenarist suggests.

This might seem odd, but the thing that bothered me most about 'Snow Cake' is the screenwriter's failure to explain the nature of the accident. Why is everything left so vague when the truck driver piles into Alex and Vivienne? Wouldn't the circumstances of the accident have been broadcast on the nightly news? By leaving the nature of the accident vague, this allows Alex to act with hostility toward the truck driver (barring him from bringing the flowers to Linda). But had Alex knew what really happened, he couldn't have used that as an excuse to be angry with the truck driver. The confrontation between the two seems forced and sets up the sentimental scene in the church where Alex 'forgives' the driver (which he has no right to do, since presumably the death of Vivienne was an accident!).

As a psychological portrait of a fully functioning adult autistic woman and her quirky but vibrant teenage daughter, Snow Cake hits the mark. But most of the rest of the Snow Cake characters, particularly Maggie and Alex, never rise above the level of caricature. For all its well-meaning sensitivity, Snow Cake is more a fairy tale than a story that could actually happen in real life.",1285632000,4,5706,4.774062816616008

2810062,4,B000P46OV0,"Snow Cake is a moving tale of tragedy, loss, guilt, and grief. It is also a hugely life-affirming celebration of difference. Sigourney Weaver's portrayal of an autistic single mother is by turns mesmerising and hilarious. As to its authenticity - well I'm not qualified to judge but it has apparently been endorsed by many people who are. Alan Rickman is as effective as ever as the guilt-stricken pilgrim who enters her life by way of a tragic accident and is transformed as a result of knowing her. And the snowy Canadian early spring thaw provides a marvelously sparse and chilly analogue to this odd couple's brief but cathartic encounter.

On the down side, this is a somewhat manipulative movie, and is arguably a little predictable, but these faults are easily outweighed by the film's genuine warmth.",1233446400,3,808,4.9411764705882355

While I was tempted to call Sigourney Weaver 'annoying' in her role, I realize that that's the entire point - she's portraying a high-functioning autistic and - by all accounts - has done an amazing rendition here.

The real star is Emily Hampshire as Weaver's on-screen daughter, Vivienne.  She powerfully portrays her character's quirky, fierce but ultimately sweet nature.  Why does she single out Rickman for attention as the film opens?  As the spotlight review on this page notes, ""Vivienne always picked the loneliest people to talk to.""

I liked a lot about this movie, however. The northern setting was artistic, moody. I thought the story on the whole was very interesting and refreshing when compared to most films which have fast action, lots of noise and dramatic music, but weak on script. I am suspicious of Weaver's character because I don't know whether we were presented with an authentic ""high functioning"" autistic person. I have no experience or information, but I sure don't want to get it from the movie industry, which portrays the mentally ill or developmentally delayed romantically, always casting attractive actors in the parts, not people who look like the real people. In real life would anyone actually buy a lovely home for an autistic woman, no matter how ""high functioning"" she was? If the grandparents raised Vivienne until she was 16, was Linda living all that time in her own home? If she couldn't care for a child, why could she have a home of her own? Maybe I missed something, but it seemed unbelievable. I felt a little like I was having social/mental health issues forced on me by Lifetime TV, manipulative.  I really hate that. While some parts of the story seemed a bit loosely connected (like the affair with neighbor) I still enjoyed it. However, unlike at least one reviewer, I did not find the funeral to be a tear jerker.

2810072,3,B000P46OV0,"With SNOW CAKE, the glass is half-empty and the glass is half-full. The full half first: Sigourney Weaver gives probably the best acting performance in her career up to now as Linda, a middle-age woman with autism whose daughter Vivienne is killed in a traffic accident and who deals with the aftermath in her own way. Alan Rickman is equally as good as Alex, a loner and the driver of the car in which Vivienne is killed. Alex attempts to pay his respects to Linda and what follows is the interaction of two closed-off souls unwittingly helping each other through what has hurt them, past (Alex) and present (Linda). When the movie is on the two of them together, it hits every right note you could ask for in a movie. Weaver is particularly adept at evoking an autistic person. Linda's character is another facet of autism, very different from the autistic man Dustin Hoffman plays in RAIN MAN, and as disagreeable and hard to like as Linda is much of the time, she also comes across as very aware of the world around her and how she can best cope with it.

Where the movie is less sucessful is on Alex's side of the story. While, as said, Alan Rickman does a wonderful job of conveying a broken man trying to become whole again, his character's background and motivations are never made clear enough. Eventually his story comes out in dribs and drabs, but somehow you don't care as much about it as you do about Linda and her immediate tragedy. There's also a romantic subplot between Alex and one of Linda's neighbors, Maggie (Carrie-Anne Moss) which feels both inexplicable and unnecessary, although Moss is quite good in her role. And things get wrapped up just a little too neatly at the end, as if the director and screenwriter felt the they HAD to have a resolution. But life doesn't end neatly; why does a movie have to?

Whether these are quibbles or major obstacles to one's enjoying the film is a subjective judgement, but I don't think anyone watching SNOW CAKE will get up from it feeling like their time was wasted. Overall, it's fine.",1208736000,9,2051,4.5858310626703
2810073,5,B000P46OV0,"I'm a fan of movies - the good, the bad, the indifferent and the simply awful (sometimes). Yet, every now and again I come across a film that moves me immeasurably, even when I don't want to be.

Snow Cake is not a big, loud, 'Hollywood' movie but Alan Rickman's portrayal of Alex Hughes, one of those lonely, complex people many of us are too busy to notice, is outstanding enough to have warranted an Oscar nomination, at least. Sigourney Weaver is heartbreaking as Linda, a high-functioning autistic woman whose hitch-hiking daughter, Vivienne, thumbed a ride from the reclusive Hughes.

I'm not ashamed to say I'm a HUGE Rickman fan so I've seen almost everything he's done, except maybe his very early TV stuff.  Yet, when I'd read that he was to do Snow Cake, I almost didn't see it because I didn't know anything about autism and the setting (snow everywhere) wasn't my cup of tea. Well, folks, I've gotta tell ya, I've rented and watched this movie so many times that I finally gave in and bought the DVD for myself. The acting was just so powerful, even from the 'minor' characters played by Carrie Ann Moss or Callum Keith Rennie.

If you don't like people much, or have never wondered what makes a person tick, this movie probably isn't your cup of tea. If, however, you like to people-watch and are a student of the human psyche, then watch Snow Cake - and, oh yeah, keep a box of Kleenex close by. Don't say I didn't warn you!",1208131200,,1439,4.501915708812261
2810074,4,B000P46OV0,"""Snow Cake"" starts off with a jolt of bitterly cruel irony, as a young hitchhiker, desperate to get home to her mother's, scans an Ontario diner to see which of its numerous patrons would be the ""safest"" person to ask for a ride.  She quickly alights on Alex Hughes, a reserved, colorless, middle-aged Brit who's come to Canada on some undisclosed business and who seems to be covering up some deep dark secret from the rest of the world.  Alex reluctantly agrees to take Vivienne with him, but before they can reach their destination, Vivienne is killed when the car they are riding in is sideswiped by a speeding semi.  Wracked with guilt, Alex decides to visit Vivienne's mother, Linda, and apologize for his part in the girl's death.  When he gets to the woman's home, he is shocked to discover that Linda is suffering from a case of autism so severe that she essentially lives in a world of her own, emotionally cut off from the people around her.

Lyrical and low-keyed, ""Snow Cake"" paints an intriguing portrait of a woman trapped inside a dysfunctional mind and of a man coping with the crushing burden of survivor's guilt.  Yet, that is not the only problem Alex faces, for, despite the fact that he is in full control of his mental faculties, Alex is not all that far removed from Linda in his inability to make sense out of the world and to establish emotional connections with the people in his life.  Alex carries his sadness around with him like a dark cloud, alerting all who meet him to the extreme unhappiness buried deep within his soul.  Somehow, Alex and Linda establish a bizarre symbiotic relationship that few others in the movie can even begin to understand.

Angela Bell's debut screenplay boasts a fine blend of sadness, humor and warmth, and Marc Evans' artful, sensitive direction creates a richly melancholic tone throughout.  Going far beyond the mannerisms of a mentally-challenged individual, Sigourney Weaver is poignant and touching as the woman cut off from the outside world, while the always wonderful Alan Rickman, with his hangdog expression and exasperated tone, conveys all the suppressed longing and world-weary resignation essential to his character.  In addition, Carrie-Anne Moss makes her mark as a well-meaning neighbor who offers Alan more than the traditional tea and sympathy in his time there.",1207094400,2,2344,4.893939393939394
2810075,5,B000P46OV0,What a great film.  Sigorney Weaver and Alan Rickman were incredible.  I have a son who is blessed with high functioning autism and it always intrigues me as to what may the future be like for him.  I enjoyed this film and would recommend it to anyone.,1206489600,3,252,4.319148936170213
2810076,4,B000P46OV0,"Welsh-born film director, Marc Evans, who has given us HOUSE OF AMERICA (1997), and RESURRECTION MAN (1998), stepped back from the Thriller/Horror genre, and was lured to the wilds of Wawa, Ontario--a small Canadian town of 4,000 that is lorded over by a huge statue of a snow goose, by a very sensitive script written by Angela Pell, and a powerhouse dream cast. SNOW CAKE is a film about pain, retribution, angst, revenge, inner demons, middle-aged angst and sex, disabilities, small town idiosyncrasies and politics, acceptance, and love--that can rear its beautiful mug in the dangdest places at the weirdest times.

The poster tagline was, ""sometimes stopping is the most important part of the journey."" An ex-convict, Alex (Alan Rickman) was on a road trip, a painful and emotional odyssey, to Winnipeg. He harbored dark secrets and stress, and we are not at first aware of the exact nature of his ""crime"". At a truck stop diner, the reserved and taciturn Alex met a loquacious, bubbly, sweet yet eccentric young woman--Vivienne (Emily Hampshire). Reluctantly, Alex offered her a ride to Wawa.

Tragically, just as they pulled out onto the highway they were T-boned by an 18 wheeler semi. Vivienne was killed, but Alex emerged without a scratch. Traumatized, he decided to contact the girl's mother to convey his condolences and regrets. When he met the mother, Linda (Sigourney Weaver), he was confronted with a middle-aged highly-functioning autistic woman. She seemed to beguile him with her lack of emotion, and she invited him to stay with her until Vivienne's funeral--so that he could, ""take out the garbage on Tuesday. Vivienne always did that. I don't do garbage.""

Alex did stay for several days, and he found a gentle way to co-exist with Linda's eccentricities, her obsession with cleanliness, her fascination with ""sparkling"" things, her need to jump often on her trampoline, her love of eating snow, and her need to keep all hands and feet out of her kitchen. Soon Alex met the attractive next-door neighbor, Maggie (Carrie-Anne Moss), and they made an attempt to ""start"" a relationship. Before the funeral, we discovered Alex's pain-ridden past, and why he railed so emotionally against the truck driver (Callum Keith Rennie)--we met Linda's wonderful parents, who had raised Vivienne, and we learned to appreciate the relative independence that Linda had carved out laboriously for her self.

Sigourney Weaver was astonishingly good, just excellent, as Linda. She had studied Autism, and somehow found a way to deglamorize herself, and be emerged completely in the tic-ridden, quirky yet likeable Linda. The writer Angela Pell, has an autistic son, and so understands the bumpy emotional terrain she wrote about. Alan Rickman of the dour smirk, quick wit, and carefully phrased speech, found a character in Alex that was flawed and still redeemable, middle-aged sexy, very capable of terrible anger, yet equally capable of growth, of an epiphany, who at the end of his journey in Wawa discovered some form of acceptance and patience. Carrie-Anne Moss presented us with a Maggie who was outspoken, an outsider in a small town, sexually emancipated, fiercely independent, well read, well versed, needy yet giving, warm and real, yet still vulnerable, and of course incredibly sensual. She took what was essentially a ""nothing role"", embraced it and breathed life into it.

SNOW CAKE like other Canadian winter dramas, reminiscent of Atom Egoyan's THE SWEET HEREAFTER (1997), and Sarah Polley's AWAY FROM HER (2006), created a movie malleable microcosm of humanity and human nature--that touches us as it teaches, that provided a lively peek into the lives and hearts of several unique and ""special"" characters. It is a quiet film that nevertheless grips our shoulders firmly, a stern but patient tutor who had an interesting lesson to share.",1205280000,7,3861,5.161341853035144
2810077,5,B000P46OV0,"Portrayal of a sensitive man isn't often given to Alan Rickman, but he surpasses his usual image with mastery in this poignant story.  The opening scene of him airborne imparts the persona well - yet he's only sitting there, not even looking out the window. Alex Hughes is a  con, who ""killed a man"".  He's accosted by a young woman in a diner claiming he ""looks like he needs to talk"", something he rejects.  It's Northern Ontario in early winter - not the most attractive season but highly fitting.  Vivienne is an aspiring writer wanting to know about people.  She's cut off in that youth by a semi-truck who sends Alex's car flying into the snow.  Beset by guilt, he wends his way to Wawa, an isolated community along the Transcanada Highway to confront Vivienne's mother with unneeded apologies.

Linda [Weaver] greets him with total indifference.  Vivienne is gone and there's nothing more to be done.  She's autistic, with many of the symptoms portrayed by an actress who's clearly researched the syndrome.  Subject to obsessions, given to outbursts over what are mundane circumstances to the rest of us, Weaver performs impeccably in the role.  ""I don't do garbage"", she says, urging him to stay to move the bins to the street on Tuesday.  Reluctantly, he agrees, perceiving Linda's state requires no little compassion.  She has nobody else to rely on, keeping her distance from her neighbours in town - especially Maggie - ""she's a prostitute"", says Linda.

There are neither lapses nor ""hanging"" scenes in this film.  Every frame carries the message of a man beset by grief.  The prison sentence was from his wreaking vengeance on the man who, while driving drunk, had struck Alex's son, killing him.  Rickman carries this film throughout, Weaver, for all her abilities in portraying Linda, remains yet a foil to a man so riven by grief and guilt.  Unlike Linda, who must be accommodated, Alex must endure a painful healing process.  It has already been long and painful, and there's no assurance that even the meeting of his former wife in distant Winnipeg will relieve him of his woes.  That situation keeps the film heavy, but the performances make it more than bearable, it's compelling.  Carrie-Anne Moss brings a particular strength in a small town as a woman sexually driven, but is in no way hackneyed in her role as Maggie.

Throughout the film Rickman is the balance point of many forces, his own anguish, Linda's bizarre lapses into her own world and Maggie's need for a man she can respect.  A post-accident confrontation with the truck driver brings a turning point - Alex, who has feelings in check is given the opportunity to vent them fully.  Does he achieve release?  Death, to him, is a very significant presence, yet Linda simply asserts that ""We won't see Vivienne again"", a more rational approach than being suffused by crippling sadness.  All we come to believe about Alex is confronted by his departure ""gift"" to Linda, a masterful departure from the grim man we've come to know.  The film could have been terribly hackneyed, but Marc Evans has managed a low-key masterpiece.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]",1205020800,8,3146,4.849906191369606

2810084,4,B000P46OV0,"An interesting study of the human psyche that pushes all the buttons of its viewers with room to spare, ""Snow Cake"" is an eye-opening, life affirming experience in the form of an indie film. Marking the screenwriting debut of Angela Pell, it was directed by Marc Evans and screened to heavy fanfare at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival and is at last available on DVD for a wider audience to appreciate.

Fresh off a four year prison stint for a mysterious murder charge, Alex Hughes, played by the fantastic Alan Rickman, is a docile, middle-aged Englishman on the way to Winnipeg, Canada. Not receptive to company after a long plane ride, he is approached in a diner by Vivienne, a young woman with a bubbly personality played by Emily Hampshire. Chatty and extroverted, she invites herself to sit down at his table and tells him all about herself. He is not in the mood to chat, but begrudgingly lets her bum a ride in his truck.

During their trip she eventually gets him to open up, and they establish a lovely rapport. Unfortunately, near the end of their journey they are rammed by a tractor trailer and Vivienne is killed instantly. Rattled and wholly devastated at her loss, Alex is compelled to contact her mother, Linda, played with unprecedented skill by Sigourney Weaver, to explain what happened as well as deliver gifts Vivienne bought.

When he meets Linda, he discovers that she is a high-functioning autistic woman who barely strays from her home and has a myriad of obsessions, among them cleanliness (""Don't go in my kitchen!""), her trampoline and, strangely, snow. Nonetheless upset at her daughter's death, she is inhibited by her disease which tempers her outward devastation. He tries to apologize, but she sees no need for one.

""Did you do it in purpose?"" she asks him.

""No, of course not, we just...""

""Then sit down then! I haven't got a problem with you - you must be alright because you gave Vivienne a lift, and you brought me my sparklies!"" she says as she plays with them excitedly.

Linda persuades him to stay to assist her with funeral arrangements and put out the garbage on Tuesday (""I don't do garbage!""), as her parents are hiking in the mountains and cannot be reached to come to her assistance. Little does Alex know that he is embarking what are likely to be the defining days of his life.

He becomes involved with Linda's beautiful though equally mysterious neighbor Maggie, played by Carrie-Anne Moss, and is viewed with a watchful eye by the local townspeople, most particularly Clyde, a local police officer with eyes for Maggie played by James Allodi who digs into his troubled past. Getting to know more about Vivienne and her life, Alex learns even more about himself in the process.

""Vivienne wanted to be a writer,"" Linda tells him. ""She said she would always try and get a ride with the most lonely looking characters because they had the best stories."" As it turns out, it is her own death that proves the turning point in Alex's own story. A man trying to escape his past, he soon realizes through his experiences that the only way he can move on with his life is to confront his demons head on.

Rickman is positively endearing, with an innate ability to make viewers care for his protagonist, and Weaver's nuanced, challenging performance is simply a marvel of acting dexterity. Although she plays the kind of woman most go out of their way to avoid interacting with, she fully humanizes Linda and brings the viewer into her own little world where emotions are blunt and eating snow is a thrilling occasion. An unlikely angel, she facilitates Alex's need to move on to the next chapter of his life.

""Snow Cake"" is certainly offbeat, but it is a deeply affecting film made to linger on the viewer's palette long after its viewing. Cutting right to the heart of human nature and the discordance of life, it is beautiful in its frankness and honesty.",1199145600,121,3919,4.714912280701754

2810088,3,B000P46OV0,"A trio of fine veteran actors is on display in this desultory 2007 drama that makes an attempt at emotional uplift but doesn't quite make it. Directed by Marc Evans and written by Angela Pell, this small-scale indie taps into themes of emotional isolation and moving on after a devastating personal loss, subjects covered with greater dexterity and humor by similarly wintry films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lars-and-the-Real-Girl/dp/B000YABV9U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lars and the Real Girl</a>. The story centers on a solitary middle-aged Brit named Alex Hughes, whose veiled bitterness masks a personal tragedy that had led to a prison term. Recently released, he is on a cross-country journey to Winnipeg when he finds himself entangled with a chatty teen-aged hitchhiker named Vivienne seeking passage home to the small Ontario town of Wawa.

A viscerally shocking moment leads Alex quite unexpectedly to meet Vivienne's mother Linda, a high-functioning autistic woman who is manically fastidious and emotionally disconnected from the people around her. Before you can say&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rain-Man/dp/B0000YEEGM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rain Man</a>, Alex and Linda forge a friendly alliance in which life lessons are learned, often under adversity, until the two must part. Meanwhile, an attraction is sparked between Alex and Linda's next-door neighbor Maggie, a sultry yet kindly divorcee whom Linda thinks is a prostitute. Give Pell credit for steering clear of the life-affirming clichs that would have marked this as a misplaced Lifetime TV-movie. Pell's personal insights are invaluable given that she has an autistic son. At the same time, Evans' handling of Alex's spiritual reawakening lacks the intensity that would have allowed the film to take flight.

Playing the sympathetic protagonist for a change, Alan Rickman brings the necessary gravitas to his textured performance as Alex with enough of his dry wit to leaven at least some of the proceedings. In a fearless turn obviously inspired by Dustin Hoffman's award-winning work in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rain-Man/dp/B0000YEEGM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rain Man</a>, Sigourney Weaver approaches the difficult role of Linda with vigor and a liberating lack of vanity, though there are moments when I can see the smart actress underneath. Carrie-Anne Moss lends surprising heart and a beguiling sexiness to Maggie. Also noteworthy is Steve Cosens' clean cinematography which nicely captures the wintry feel of rural Ontario. The 2007 DVD is bereft of the standard extras like a director's commentary or a making-of featurette, but there are ten deleted scenes of varying interest and the original theatrical trailer.",1198108800,17,2854,6.168341708542713
2810089,5,B000P46OV0,"Because I've seen this movie and thought it wonderful, I purchased it for a Christmas gift. It isn't for children, but adults will find it uplifting, realistic, and filled with unexpected humor.",1197504000,,194,5.09375
2810090,5,B000P46OV0,"Well, I was very eager to see this movie, and would have preferred to have seen it in the theaters, but alas, thanks to Hollywood, they are not likely to help out independent films...

Anyway, I bought the DVD, and watched it. It is fabulous and funny, and also moving. If you, or you know someone, who has a disability, you will find this to be a fairly realistic portrayal of how people with diabilities are treated by society at large, as well as how those who are family or friends of people with disabilities get treated by society.

If you don't know someone with a disability, then you really should see this film. It is highly insightful. Just because someone is different, does not mean that they are stupid, and should be treated as such. They are human beings, that just act or think differently.

***POTENTIAL SPOILER!!!!***

My favorite scene in the movie, was the deleted scene where Alex takes Linda to McDonald's, and a woman leaving the restaurant with her family, stops in front of Alex, and makes some ignorant comment about caregivers, etc. (assuming that Alex is just Linda's caregiver), and Alex's priceless response is, ""Actually, she's my wife"". And the woman sputters, and doesn't know what to say, and leaves quickly.

One of my friends has a disability, and it amazes me every time someone assumes she's my daughter (she's only four years younger than me...), or that I must be a caregiver, etc. Because it seems unfathomable to people that my friend would actually be capable of having friends. Either that, or they assume that no one would want to be friends with her, because of her disability. Never mind the fact that my friend has a Master's Degree...

***END POTENTIAL SPOILER***

It's kind of the old saying, ""Never judge a book by its cover."" Well, that saying is never more true than with this movie. Everyone should see it. I laughed so much while watching it.

Truly a delight! Brilliant portrayals by Sigourney Weaver and Alan Rickman.",1197331200,2,1975,4.737609329446064
2810091,5,B000P46OV0,"Alan Rickman deserves an Oscar for his performance. It almost felt like a documentary, rather than a fictional story--he is so real here.

The story itself is beautiful. The Amazon review tells us that the writer has an autistic child so obviously this is an act of love for her. Despite the difficulties the people in the film face this isn't at all depressing. One is left with a huge amount of hope.  The scene in which the autistic woman. Linda, (Sigourney Weaver) and Alex  (Rickman) play scrabble is transcendent.  Linda makes up her own rules for the game which enable her to make up her own words, providing she can use them in a sentence.  The sentence she makes up (more than one...) is so beautiful, it will stay in my mind for a long time.  Weaver plays it just right.

The film is so un-Hollywood it's terrifically refreshing.  The plot unfolds in surprising ways, just like life.  You don't know what's going to happen next, just like life.  Some may find the scenes with the autistic woman a little painful to watch; I did.  But don't let that keep you from watching a wonderfully touching work of cinematic art.",1197244800,,1127,4.557213930348259
2810092,5,B000P46OV0,"Because she wanted to be a writer and she believed they had the best stories.

She wasn't wrong when she picked Alex Hughes (Alan Rickman) out of all the diner customers to share a table with.

She really wasn't even wrong when she convinced him to give her a ride.  The crash that killed her wasn't Alex's fault--a semi driver rammed his car and killed her.

Not knowing what else to do, Alex went to see Vivienne's Mom (Weaver) only to find that she was a high functioning autistic person with no one to care for her.  Alex stayed til the funeral was over--and those days really are what the story is about.

Alex merely wants to help.  While he doesn't understand Linda's condition, he very well knows the grief of losing a child and by helping her he is also working through his own issues.  Rickman's portrayal of Alex may well be his best role in his career--and I have loved his performances for many years.

Weaver is also stellar as Linda.  If I didn't know better, I would have said they'd recruited an autistic woman to play the role--and that to me, is the mark of really fine acting.  The actor is lost when they become the part.

I cannot say this is a movie I would ever own.  I doubt I will see ""Snow Cake"" again, but I would strongly recommend it to anyone who needs to deal with an autistic person.  It's a very good illustration of how a high functioning autistic person relates to their environment.",1197072000,44,1419,4.3869731800766285
2810093,5,B000P46OV0,"Every once in a while a movie comes along that is practically perfect, and this is one of those times.  Aside from some annoyingly trendy hand-held camera work during the first five minutes of the movie, it doesn't put a foot wrong.  All of the actors (even the minor supporting cast) turn in performances to be proud of: under-stated yet touching and convincing at all times.  The camera work, once it settles down, is likewise understated but generally just right for each scene and moment. The script is spare and humor is cleverly used to underscore the poignancy.  This is a real movie about real people, without a special effect in sight.  The longer you watch, the more you want to see.  If you want to see a grown-up movie for grown-up people, please watch this sparkling little gem.",1196121600,19,791,4.654676258992806

2810095,4,B000P46OV0,"Snow Cake is an excellent film, with incredible performances from Alan Rickman (Harry Potter Years 1-5, Something the Lord Made) (when are his performances less than stellar?) and a surprising performance from Sigourney Weaver (Infamous, Alien Quadrilogy (Alien/ Aliens /Alien 3 /Alien Resurrection)) as an autistic parent.

A drama, this film, has an unexpected feel good energy to it. This is only possible due to an excellent script and superb performances from the cast.

A different kind of romantic comedy, this is surely a must-see film.",1195516800,2,544,5.313953488372093
2810096,5,B000P46OV0,"My husband and I ordered this movie through Netflicks (since it never came to a theatre near us), and were so impressed with it we purchased a copy for our own video library and to share with friends.  It is a poignant (often funny), beautifully written, intelligent, compassionate work exploring the courage it takes for ordinary--as well as uniquely challenged--humans to get through life with their basic goodness and decency intact.  The acting is superb, the story believable; you want to know these people.  A wonderful, uplifting drama for intelligent grownups; why do movies like this not get the wide distribution they deserve?",1194825600,2,636,5.155339805825243
2810097,2,B000P46OV0,"Sigourney Weaver was brilliant as a very verbal autistic woman who loses her daughter in an auto accident. Alan Rickman does a credible job as the driver who had picked up the hitchhiking 15-year-old. However, the film is rather slow, and the indoor sets have dismal dark lighting--not exactly cheery or uplifting. The character of Maggie (played by Carrie-Anne Moss) is the least developed and somewhat of an enigma.

(WARNING: SPOILER) The story centers around the redemption of the characters, as they meet around the central event of the daughter's death and the resulting funeral arrangements. Rickman, an ex-con who had killed a man in a rage (the man had been driving drunk and killed Rickman's son), re-lives that event all over again but this time has the chance to do it right. Weaver learns how to become more social. And Maggie? It appears that Maggie now has a new friend in Rickman, even though he decides to leave the little town and move on in his life. At least Maggie is now able to enter Weaver's house, despite Weaver's protests, to help with chores etc. We also see a change in the people of the small town as they learn to become more tolerant of Weaver's unconventional responses to death, to lots of people in her house, and more.

Despite the good to excellent acting of Weaver and Rickman, I wouldn't recommend this movie unless you wanted a slow night and had nothing else to watch.",1194134400,7,1409,4.700404858299595
2810098,4,B000P46OV0,"Snow Cake is a as spare and beautiful a film as the stark landscape in which its story is set.  A story of acceptance, personal redemption, and tolerance, each of its main characters struggles against personal demons and social prejudice.  A horrible accident is both the catalyst for the meeting of the main characters (Weaver's Linda along with the brilliant Alan Rickman as Alex and Carrie-Anne Moss as Maggie)and the fulcrum of each of these character's personal crises moments.  Emotionally moving while restrained from manipulation, the beauty of Snow Cake  rests in the strong, courageous spirits of these three, memorable characters.",1192924800,2,641,5.316831683168317
2810099,5,B000P46OV0,"'Snow Cake' is an incredibly touching film. Despite the early character death, it is a lovely and feel-good film that made me cry and laugh. It speaks truly for autistic people, and Sigourney Weaver does a tremendously accurate portrayal. I recognized myself more than once.

She is very believable, which is hard to find in films these days, especially with the upsurge of negative and false stereotypes about autism, pushed by both the media and organizations which try (and fail) to speak for autistics (instead of letting us speak for ourselves).

Alan Rickman is also in his element and this is perhaps one of his best films yet. Definitely a film I'm glad to own because I want to watch it over and over again. Buy it for yourself, a friend, or both; I doubt you'll be disappointed.",1192233600,6,788,4.702898550724638
