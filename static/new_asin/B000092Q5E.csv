1876772,4,B000092Q5E,"With the ever present ticking of a clock and nerve-wracking machine noises in the soundtrack, this is a taut, nifty disaster thriller, with the cruise ship HMS Britannic sailing to America, unknowingly with 7 bombs hidden aboard, set to explode; they have multiple booby traps, and the saboteur wants not only money but revenge against the system that in his twisted mind feels slighted him.
The cast is great, with Richard Harris as the head of a demolition team, David Hemmings as his right-hand man, Omar Sharif as the ship's captain, and Anthony Hopkins as the man in charge of finding the bad guy (whose wife and children are aboard the ship); Shirley Knight, Ian Holm, and Roy Kinnear round out the cast.

The direction by Richard Lester, better known for his comedic musical films with The Beatles and not thrillers, is fast paced, with some superb effects; I especially like the suspenseful moments when the demolition crew arrives on the scene, parachuting into the stormy sea.
The screenplay by producer Richard DeKoker is intelligent, raising this film up from the average production in this genre, and the cinematography by Gerry Fisher excellent. The score by Ken Thorne is also good, but mostly one can only hear the tick...tick...tick...of the bomb.
Total running time is 109 minutes.",1114214400,17,1299,4.986175115207374
1876773,4,B000092Q5E,"Like many of the other reviewers, this was a film that I recalled with great fondness.
I had seen it when I was younger...not even a teenager...but I remember loving it.
I had been looking for it forEVER when I read that it was being released on DVD.
I happily popped it in my DVD player and put my feet up.
You know how some movies are not NEARLY as good as you once thought? They're not as funny, not as scary, often plain stupid.
Well I'm happy to report that this film is terrific. It STILL raises the blood pressure, and will still having you guessing by the end.
Richard Harris plays the quasi-heroic bomb defuser, Omar Sharif the beleaguered captain and a young Anthony Hopkins has a one-note performance as a stressed out Scotland Yarder.
Roy Kinnear is a painful hoot as the Ship's Steward (think Julie on the Love Boat) who tries to raise everyone's spirits EVEN THOUGH THEY KNOW THERE'S BOMBS ON THE SHIP.
Trying to get everyone to sing along to ""Roll Out The Barrel""? Priceless.
The script is spare but witty. I loved the comment about ""A Night To Remember"".
This is among the best ""disaster"" movies ever made, and a terrific thriller.",1081296000,26,1147,4.492822966507177
1876774,4,B000092Q5E,"A taught tense adventure of a mad bomber who holds an oceanliner for ransom after he plants a series of bombs aboard.  The villian is known, as each bomb has a signiture style. Richard Harris leads the team who attempt to defuse the bombs, only somewhat successful.  As the countdown continues, the tension mounts, and it becomes more a cat and mouse game between the bomber and the police expert as they debate whether to cut the red or the blue wire.  The final minutes are excrusiating.
I saw this on the big screen in 1974 and could convince no one to go to a free showing in Lansing, Michigan with me on a Sunday afternoon.  An overlooked gem, I recall this film fondly.  The plot is somewhat predictable, but Richard Harris is surrounded with major British actors who give good support to this tension filled adventure.  Try it.  It has to be better than any of the US dissaster picts of the period.",1076716800,15,905,4.4817073170731705

 This was one of the most intense ""cat and mouse"" type thillers of it's day. The battle of wits between Fallon (R. Harris) and the bomber will keep your eyes locked on the screen to keep from missing anything. The plot and storyline are as intricate as the bombs themselves.
 If you enjoyed the more recent movie ""Blown Away"" then you will enjoy this one. Blown Away used many of the same techniques developed in Juggernaut, and is the logical film decendant of this classic.",1053648000,15,661,4.641025641025641
1876777,4,B000092Q5E,"This is a deftly handled thriller from veteran director Richard Lester. It inevitably begs comparison with movies of the ilk of The Poseidon Adventure, which is worthy in its own way, but this is in a far superior class. Its Britishness is its real asset - it avoids the schmaltzy, soapy feel of its American forebears in the world of disaster epics. Romantic elements of the story are treated with a grittiness that eschews all melodramatics. The psyches of the characters are not explored in depth, but are nevertheless flesh-and-blood characters, and we never get the feeling that their development is sacrificed to the suspense (of which there is plenty). In a supporting role as the ship's entertainments officer, Roy Kinnear elicits much pathos; Shirley Knight is affecting in a similarly tragic minor role, as the longsuffering mistress of captain, Omar Sharif, whose performance is merely satisfactory next to excellent star turns by (a young) Anthony Hopkins and Richard Harris. Film buffs will also delight in spotting a few other vintage British character actors in among the big names: Michael Hordern, Freddie Jones, Ian Holm and Julian Glover to name a few.
The pace is near-perfect (this is textbook film-making), never lagging or threatening to become tedious. The editing works to create maximal tension at just the right moments; the photography has a grainy and often extemporaneous documentary feel to it (some of the more seemingly spontaneous shots reminded me of Schlesinger's Midnight Cowboy, however distant a comparison that might appear). Both editing and camerawork function effectively to hold interest and attention. Ken Thorne's score is subtle and in keeping with the tone of the film. In sum, this is an exciting and dramatic thriller, competently pulled off by a skilled company of talents.",1020816000,41,1824,5.207482993197279
1876778,4,B000092Q5E,"After Richard Lester directed the two Beatles films he was a hot talent, much in-demand at the time. Unfortunately for his career, he spent a lot of time and money on the surreal 'The Bed Sitting Room', and found himself without a film for a few years. His version of 'The Three Musketeers' returned him to favour, and he followed it up with this, an unjustly-obscure bomb disposal thriller. Based on a true story (in 1972 the SAS were parachuted onto the QE2 to deal with a bomb threat which later turned out to be a hoax), this is a solid, interesting thriller with a fantastic cast - where else do you get David Hemmings, Richard Harris, Omar Sharif *and* Roy Kinnear in one film? And, for that matter, Ian Holm, Clifton James (J W Pepper from 'The Man with the Golden Gun'), Julian Glover and Freddie Jones! The film itself is a clever, taut thriller, much better than the 'disaster movies' the editorial review above compares it with. It's one of the classic 'bomb disposal' films.

1876790,3,B000092Q5E,"BOTTOM LINE: This film is an OK diversion but not likely one you'll be reaching for very often. Very similar in look & feel to the formulaic American-filmed disaster films from around the same time period. I found it kinda boring. With a cast & crew this talented it should have been better. 3 STARS

THE STORY: A terrorist calling himself ""Juggernaut"" contacts the owners of a huge British cruise ship once it's in the mid-Atlantic, informing them he's planted seven bombs on board... and if they don't pay up by his deadline? BOOM! British government refuses to negotiate, instead airlifting an elite squad of commandos out to the ship to disarm the devices before disaster strikes.

THOUGHTS: Blind bought this purely due to the amazing cast.  Richard (A Man Called Horse, Man In The Wilderness) Harris leads a stellar list of well-established (and a few soon to be major) stars.  A very young Anthony Hopkins is among them; playing a Scotland Yard detective who has a very personal stake in the crisis: his wife & kids are aboard the marked-for-death ocean liner. There's some good stuff here but unfortunately the film meanders along without much of sense of urgency; even the ship's passengers seem rather indifferent to the news that the vessel they're on will blow up & sink in less than 24 hours. There's also a soapy subplot involving the Captain (a seemingly very bored Omar Sharrif) and a female passenger which pretty much goes no where. This was done, I suspect, in order to make the role of the Captain large enough to secure Sharrif's talents, although they're entirely wasted here. The romance was also likely an attempt to entice female moviegoers into buying a ticket. The film switches to this tedious, go-nowhere yawn-fest whenever the action lags, which it does a disappointing amount in this movie. Given the initially exciting-sounding plot description, this motion picture should (and could) have been a high-pressure firecracker of a film. Instead, it's more of a damp sparkler. Scenes with Richard Harris talking himself through the nerve-wracking diffusal of one of the explosives packages helps keep the film from being a total waste. He's great, as usual, but when he's not on screen you'll find yourself frequently checking your watch, waiting impatiently until he is.

THE BLU-RAY: Kino-Lorber's release of JUGGERNAUT arrives on Blu-ray looking & sounding respectable. Nothing to rock the house as far as audio & video, but a clean, crisp picture and clear, level sound. No extras except a copy of the film's theatrical trailer.",1439769600,,2560,4.985948477751757

1876792,5,B000092Q5E,"This is an old favorite that I saw when it came out in 1974. I have always been fond of it. The best scenes are of Richard Harris defusing the bomb, but it is also interesting to see many famous actors in unexpected roles. A young Anthony Hopkins as a police detective, Omar Sharif as a passenger ship captain, Ian Holm as the owner of Sovereign Lines. How many are aware that ship Britannic is really the Odessa, owned by the Soviet Union? As a ship enthusiast I picked that up immediately. The crowd scenes of the passengers are awkward and distract from the film, though perhaps the director thought it was necessary. Made when disaster films were a popular trend it still holds up. However, I wish there were more scenes with Freddie Jones, an actor I've always liked. We don't get to know his character, considering his Sid Butland is the motivator behind all the action. Still a very good film for those who love a good sea tale. [Don't miss Gareth Thomas in a cameo, he later got famous as Roj Blake in Blake's7]",1437782400,2,1019,4.454545454545454

1876796,2,B000092Q5E,"""Juggernaut"" was a U.K. offering in the disaster movie craze of the 1970s. The movie starts with some promise when the passenger liner ""Britannic"" is revealed to be a white modern ship unlike the antiquated S.S. Poseidon of a couple years before. But it turns out the Britannic is headed for a misery cruise and it's a grimy bucket of bolts after all, stocked with some of the dreariest passengers you're likely to meet. Everyone is either staring sadly at one another or mugging like players in a Benny Hill sketch. It's a shipful of the mood-disordered. And that's before they learn there are bombs on board.

For a disaster movie this one is talky-talky, and a little on the editorial side, with dialogue that's an ongoing diatribe against British politics. Part of the story transpires on dry land, and those characters - Scotland Yard and corporate types and politicians - are the coldest bastards in the film. There's very little excitement for a long while. The color is muddy and the film stock grainy.

It takes a full hour for any suspense to kick in when the bomb squad shows up to defuse the explosives. They're led by Richard Harris, who is the best thing going here. The scenes of him unscrewing screws and snipping wires leaves one wincing. Is this the movie that coined the clich of cutting the red wire or the blue? It's probably best to characterize this film as a suspense thriller rather than a disaster film. Sure bombs go off and people scream, and they have to head for the lifeboats, but the end is cheerless, gloomy, and it's fair to wonder what audiences felt as they drifted out of the theatre, afterwards. The tone seems more telling of the defeated recessive 1970s.",1432598400,,1694,4.662207357859532

In a nutshell, ocean liner, standard allotment of passengers, maniac that has planted bombs on the ship, policemans family on the ship, drops the bomb defusing experts on the shop to disarm the devices...well there you have it. Don't try to examine it too much just get a few chuckles out of the clothes and the story is droll but it was 1974 and it still had some nostalgic fun and entertainment to it. Impressive cast though so lets go with them. And by the way so much better acted and scripted then the original and awful Poseidon Adventure.",1405814400,,701,4.52755905511811
1876808,4,B000092Q5E,"I first saw ""Juggernaut"" on television as a very young child and I found it absolutely thrilling; many years later I have finally found it on DVD and unlike many recollections from childhood, I still loved it. The film is a very British maritime drama that is part sea disaster, part crime thriller, and is full of first-rate talent. The ocean liner ""HMS Britannic"" is enroute from England to New York when it is threatened by a madman going by the code name ""Juggernaut"" who has planted seven bombs onboard which will detonate unless his ransom demands are met. Lt. Cmdr. Fallon (Richard Harris,) Britain's top bomb squad expert and his team parachute to the ship and set about defusing the explosives with time running out. The behind the scenes drama at the shipping line is very well done, and the election to not pay the ransom is very difficult for many people, not the least of whom is Captain Brunel (Omar Sharif) who does not like being a pawn in the game (""It's 1,200 passengers and crew; do you know a bigger game than that?!"") Sharif is excellent, and is second only to Anthony Hopkins, who as police Superintendent John McLeod leads the frantic investigation to find Juggernaut. Ultimately they do locate him, and he turns out to be an old acquaintance of Fallon's. The final scenes of the film are worth the price of admission as the game of brinksmanship and high-tech psychology reaches a fevered pitch to great cinematic effect.

The film had a tortuous production with Richard Lester (""A Hard Day's Night"") ultimately directing a very different film than originally envisioned. The film was made largely onboard the Soviet cruise ship ""TS Maxim Gorkiy,"" a former German liner (the ""TS Hamburg"") which was between owners and was chartered with extras and sent intentionally to find the worst seas possible for dramatic effect in the North Sea (a notoriously rough area.) It is easily identifiable among ship enthusiasts due to its extremely novel funnel. (She was scrapped in India in 2009.) While the film ended up looking splendid (I'd like to give it 4.5 stars) and was certainly more credible than most contemporary American disaster flicks (""The Poseidon Adventure,"" etc.) it still has some clichs (McLeod's family is on the ship, Brunel's mistress is too, etc.) that could have been done away with, while a few situations are plainly ridiculous (a hungry kid wandering into an abandoned galley winds up in the middle of a bomb disarming, etc.) Most of the main actors do an excellent job with the material, though Harris is occasionally a bit over the top, though I suppose it's in keeping with his character.

The DVD comes with one extra, a trailer.

I thoroughly enjoyed watching ""Juggernaut"" again. It's a distinctly British take on the nautical thriller, and while not as fast-paced as many later disaster flicks, is vastly more cerebral and entertaining than most, credit for which largely goes to Lester, Hopkins, and Sharif.",1402876800,4,2955,4.882470119521912

The ocean liner `Britannic' left England. At sea the Captain is told that seven bombs with a thousand pounds of Amytol have been placed aboard at various locations, they are timed to explode at sea! They are booby-trapped to prevent their disarming. They want a 500,000 ransom to prevent them from exploding and sinking the ship and killing most of the passengers and crew. Attempts to trace the phone call fail. We see scenes of life aboard the ship. That ""ping pong"" game dates this movie. How were the bombs placed aboard? No security! Army munitions experts are parachuted into the sea to try to defuse the bombs. The Captain tells the passengers the truth of the situation. The experts begin to inspect a bomb with their equipment. Before they continue all the watertight doors are closed.

In London the police investigate the clues and interview all possible suspects. On the ship something goes wrong, a few deaths result. Only one bomb at a time will be inspected while the expert will be in telephone contact so the next expert will know what he did. They decide to get the money, all in used 20 notes. Elsewhere the passengers are entertained. Some are happy, some look sad. One expert removed the bolts, then used infrared to avoid an light trigger fuse, a photo-electric cell! He sees a complicated clockwork mechanism with electric relays. There are other triggers. The colored wires are cut. The next attempt causes an explosion! In London a man picks up two suitcases from locker 93. ""Get him!"" A caller on a telephone uses a mechanical device to disguise his voice. The bomb expert notices a fine wire that connects to a seemingly open relay. The passengers dress in warm clothes, don life vests, and prepare to abandon ship.

In London one retired expert is asked for advice. Red or blue? All the other bombs are treated the same way, they are disarmed just in time. There is a happy ending. Lives and property are saved. If the perpetrator of this extortion plot escaped will he try again? What about his replacements? Most bombings seem to be done by terrorists, they want death and destruction not money. This kind of extortion plot has the same flaws as any other crime where ransom is involved. The perpetrators are expected when they show up to claim the loot. ""Follow the money.""

This is an interesting story that is worth watching. It does not have a lot of action, it is more about the threat and suspense. Forty years later this threat seems simpler than other crimes that occurred later, where terrorists sought death and destruction rather than ransom.",1357430400,2,2606,4.758849557522124
1876820,4,B000092Q5E,"I had held off on this 1974 film because of the unreliabilty of its star, Richard Harris, about the time this was made. The tipping factor was discovering that the film had discarded 2 directors before settling on Richard Lester (A Hard Day's Night), not known for his serious fare. What a surprise, for it is one of the most respectful films toward the cat-and-mouse elements of MI-5 or the CIA black arts and the general subject matter of counter-terrorism to date. It is also crisp and smart about its handling at all levels. On-site photography, tracking consecutive sub-plots as the tension builds to its climactic scene below decks simultaneous with the capture of the mastermind/criminal. There are no games here. The laughs are genuine to offset the severity below decks with red herrings here and there. Unlike American thrillers, what occurs is never telegraphed as the behinds-scene investigations move forward. The viewer plays catch-up with no time to ask about the action. This is taut thriller, deftly handled, that is very current with its tactics knowing there may be only a wire's length difference between being a hero or a victim. The cast is excellent from the intense Richard Harris to the stoical Omar Sharif, in a solid but supporting role as the captain of the ""Britannic."" Shirley Knight, Roy Kinnear, Ian Holm, David Hemmings (Blow-Up) and a frenetic Anthony Hopkins move it along.

Arriving rather later in the disaster cycle of the early-70's -- and sandwiched between his two Musketeer excursions, I think -- Richard Lester's JUGGERNAUT met with almost complete disinterest from the critical establishment -- with the notable exception of positive reviews from Pauline Kael and Andrew Sarris -- and little success at the box office.

Lester's immediate problem in making the film was how to keep the presentation of the material original and compelling without departing too far (superficially, at least) from the associated conventions. He solves this to some degree at the narrative and dramatic levels by focusing on the minutiae and mechanisms of the central predicament and the needs of those characters involved in the life-death situation to derive some meaning from it. (There are many unusual ""little bits"" of character in this film.)

Visually and structurally, Lester develops a complex correspondence between colors and objects and incidents, and, from first shot to last, enters a critical discourse with the logic/illogic of his narrative. What his strategy accomplishes here is nothing less than to overturn any simple understanding of what exactly ""happens"" at the end of the film, although the ending is seemingly right in front of the audience: the hero triumphs, the bombs are defused and lives saved, the formula is secure and in the ascendant.

The narrative line seems clear from beginning to end (with an occasional digression). As the film proceeds, however, the attentive viewer notices more than just a few examples of ""some rather horrendous plot and dialogue lapses"" (as a reviewer elsewhere has mentioned), including a crucial wrenching ""gaff"" in the denouement which appears to substantially diminish the possibility for any positive resolution of the crisis aboard Britannic -- and reduces the audience's suspension of disbelief in such a conclusion -- a resolution which seems to occur moments later in the film, regardless.

The true horror of the central predicament in/of JUGGERNAUT is that survival for the hundreds aboard the liner apparently depends upon an either-or decision by a single character, Fallon (Richard Harris) -- a decision he is compelled to make on his best experience and intuition and at the risk of his life -- and the subsequent exact repetition of his choice by several other characters at a blind distance from him and from each other who are to follow his lead. The hopeful assumption shared by all -- with the exception of Fallon, who knows that what is to follow is actually a cascade of indeterminacies, and who is therefore without hope -- is that his local resolution (success-failure) will figure consistently throughout the array of bombs, i.e., that they are all wired similarly -- how could the narrative proceed if they are not? -- and that the next man in line will know what to do regardless of what happens to Fallon.

At the last moment, Fallon changes his mind without telling anyone, makes the other (unspoken) choice, and acts against the careful visual correspondences to conflagration and survival Lester has constructed throughout the film.

Reviewers note how seemingly ridiculous Fallon's behavior is without taking into context the profound isolation (and nihilism?) of the character. And narratively his silence doesn't seem to make sense at all unless it is understood as a tacit admission by Fallon (and the filmmaker) that the dilemma as portrayed is fundamentally inexorable, unsolvable, the ""juggernaut"" of the title: If the bombs are wired differently, then it doesn't matter what Fallon says or does, as each man in succession will face his own either-or decision, and the probability is that a bit more or less of half of them will get it wrong. That Fallon makes the ""right"" choice now (that everyone in succession follows him, that the intervention is successful and everyone saved, etc.) seems beside the point.

The narrative feels ""exploded"" and the viewer senses catastrophe has occurred in the fabric of JUGGERNAUT. The few moments left to the film feel like a (quite beautiful) glide into a receding fantasy. While allowing his audience the narrative contrivance of a positive conclusion for his hero and those aboard Britannic, Lester has managed -- through a succession of visual/aural tropes and seeming logical inconsistencies leading up to and through Fallon's silence and decision -- to suggest very strongly why such a conclusion must be felt as unconvincing, that the worst has inevitably occurred, and that all aboard are lost.

Given what the audience has been led to understand earlier in the film, the wordless last shot really says it all.

I believe JUGGERNAUT is one of Lester's three great films, and one of the best films of the 1970's. THIS TITLE NEEDS TO BE RESTORED AND GIVEN A QUALITY TRANSFER TO DVD!",1286841600,,4891,5.140880503144654
1876836,2,B000092Q5E,"Unfortunately terrorism has today, become a very real part of everyday American life.  Back in the 70's, this was not the case, however in Europe and England, the decade saw the rise of the phenomenon of terrorism, with the incident at the Munich Olympics, being one glaring example.  In books and the movies, political thrillers, espionage, and terrorism were very hot topics.  Some of the more noteworthy among many cinematic efforts during this period, were The Day Of The Jackal (1973), Two Minute Warning (1976), and Black Sunday (1977).

Set in Britain, Juggernaut (1974) is one of the early entries in the genre, and involves a threat to a luxury cruise ship, the Britannic.  There are no political overtones, the mysterious bomber known as Juggernaut just wants money, in return for providing information on how to safely diffuse seven bombs that are aboard the ship.  The shipping line is willing to pay the ransom, but is prevented from doing so by the Government, who send in a team of naval explosives experts led by Lt. Commander Anthony Fallon (Richard Harris) to disarm the bombs.  Fallon is a vocal, confident type who enjoys rising to the challenge, and it turns out that he just happens to have a personal relationship with Juggernaut.  The British government had a hard no negotiation stance regarding matters like the unrest in Northern Ireland, and that same attitude is reflected here in dealing with the terrorist treat.

This is not an action film.  The few action sequences are mostly related to damage caused by the detonation of explosives.  There are no shootouts.  It's mostly about Fallon and his team.  The most exciting thing they do is parachute from a plane, land in the ocean, and nearly drown boarding the ship.

Omar Shariff gets second billing as Alex Brunel the Captain of the Britannic, but as the commander of a ship that is turning circles, his role lacks real substance.  The same can be said of the crew and passengers, and most of those on shore.  Anthony Hopkins (The Silence Of The Lambs), Shirley Knight, and Clifton James (Live And Let Die), are among the many with little to do.  Eventually the authorities develop a lead to Juggernaut's identity, leading to a confrontation of sorts with Fallon that takes place via radio.

With ample opportunities to pontificate about the task at hand, and engage bold outbursts, this role is tailor made for Richard Harris, an experienced thespian.  Fallon's continuous babbling gets a little tiring, but he and for a while, team member Charlie Braddock (David Hemmings), are the only ones doing anything productive.  While competently executed and perhaps ""realistic"", Juggernaut may be a little too slow for today's audiences, used to spectacular over the top action.  The tone is low key, the dialog is often stuffy, and with no action scenes to speak of, this isn't a movie that grabs your attention.

A more entertaining film made around this same period that features terrorism aboard a ship, and also stars Richard Harris, is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Golden-Rendezvous-aka-Nuclear-Terror/dp/B000NKWKLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Golden Rendezvous (aka Nuclear Terror)</a>&nbsp;(1977).

The mostly British cast acquit themselves well probably the best being Richard Harris as an Irish munitions expert.  The film is good and competently directed by Richard Lester.

So they work in the dark, find the photocell...and CUT THE WIRES!  They did not check to see what kind of circuit it was, either normally ""open"" or ""closed"".  The bombmaker could have easily made the device to be a dummy so when you cut the wire it would explode.

Well, it's still a great film.  Enjoy the ride!",1246579200,2,658,4.577586206896552
1876839,4,B000092Q5E,"Richard Lester's 1974 thriller JUGGERNAUT  has  often lumped together with the ""disaster films"" of the era.  I trust it's not too much of a spoiler to say that it would be more accurately termed a ""disaster narrowly avoided""  film.  Come to think of it, what's WRONG with calling it  a plain old ""thriller."" ""Disaster film"" has always implied hundreds, even thousands dead or maimed.  In a movie like THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE--so emblematic of the genre--a mere handful of survivors live to tell the tale.  The body count in JUGGERNAUT is substantially less.  The tension level, however, is actually higher.

For viewers in the new millennium,  a film JUGGERNAUT may even hit harder  than a ""forces of nature"" or  ""failure of technology""  type disaster flick from almost 40 years ago.  The film revolves around an act of terrorism,  and even if this particular perp's objective is plain old extortion,  and NOT some twisted ideology,  he proves just as cold  and calculating as any brand of political terrorist familiar to us today.

And, as it turns out, he feels just as aggrieved, and am I alone in sensing that the filmmakers seem to demonstrate something like sympathy for the would-be extortionist's plight.  I really don't want to go into great detail and once again be the spoiler I am won't to be.  So let me just say that there's a brief, but fascinating moment in which one of the main characters hurls a version of the then still popular bromide that society itself may be at least somewhat to blame.  1974 might well be the last time a scriptwriter could get away with that one.  In fact, had the film been an American (and not a British) production, that kind of 60s sentiment would probably not have been articulated at all.  The Nixon/Agnew ""Silent Majority"" years had pretty much put the kibosh on all that kind of thinking.

Of course, all Lester and his writers are really saying is that sometimes heinous acts are, at least on some level, comprehensible. We can understand motives, even when we are appropriately appalled by the crime.  Heck even we Americans are at least THAT sophisticated.

It's actually a bit frustrating in fact that we never really get to know what makes this mad bomber, uh, tick.  But then,  the filmmakers admittedly have a fine line to tread.  They don't want to tip their hand plot-wise.  On the other hand,  when we do finally find out who the villain is,  his psychological and personal history are presented all too hastily and way too sketchily.  It's the kind of rushed psychological profile movies tend to hand us (usually voiced by ""an expert in the field"") when they haven't actually introduced us to the character sufficiently well.

In Richard Lester's defesne, I will say that the fact that there is no obvious suspect for at least the first half of the movie does add to the suspense.  I had some fairly off-the-wall guesses re:  Juggernaut's true identity.  Suffice it to say that just because a given actor went on to play one of the most sinister villains in movie history--and just because he has a few moody moments  in this film--doesn't necessarily mean that he's  anything more than the honest Joe he's first presented as.

Richard Lester still had some clout at this point in his career,  and the top flight cast he was able to assemble for this film is evidence of that.  Richard Harris, Omar Sharif, Ian Holm, David Hemmings and Anthony Hopkins are all fine.  The supporting cast includes such talents as Shirley Knight,  Roy Kinnear and Roshan Seth(the latter two providing some genuine comic relief sometimes,  while simultaneously  suggesting something much deeper below the surface).  As your not-so-atypical -70s  anti-hero/hero,  Harris is really quite good,  but you may find yourself wishing that even his character had been a bit better developed.  We learn way too late that he and the bomber have a history--one that could have been played off of significantly better than it is here.

Back stories don't get in the WAY of a good story.  They help flesh `em  out,  and make you care about the characters.  The screenwriters  for JUGGERNAUT either disagreed with that premise, or some of their best scripted scenes ended up on the cutting room floor.  You may find yourself caring about the fates of these people because of the sheer enormity of the threat.  But it's much less likely that you'll care about them as individuals.

Sort of a shame, because with just a little tinkering, it could have been otherwise.",1220918400,,4493,4.7934640522875815
1876840,4,B000092Q5E,"This '70s disaster thriller has been rather unjustly forgotten over the years, while it is in fact far superior to other films of it's kind - such as the Oscar-winning megahit ""Airport.""  The dry realism of ""Juggernaut"" is one its most winning elements - there is a relative lack of soap opera melodrama, with the focus kept squarely on the tense drama.

Basically this is a precursor to ""Speed 2,"" as others have pointed out, in that it involves an act of terrorism carried out on a cruise liner.  Instead of the over the top nonsense of that more recent movie, the filmmakers behind ""Juggernaut"" go to great pains to craft a meticulously detailed suspense thriller.  Richard Lester - who, contrary to some accounts, directed the entire movie after two different directors were replaced during preproduction - allows for many quieter moments that help establish the great amount of work being invested by both the police and the crew members on board the ship.  The result is a story that may seem slow-moving by today's standards.  Make no mistake, this is not an action movie but rather a suspense thriller.  That said, the initial boarding of the bomb experts (who must first parachute into the stormy ocean waters) is a prime example of some of the excitingly staged sequences.

One of the more conventional ""disaster movie"" aspects that ""Juggernaut"" adheres to is the all-star cast.  Here you will find excellent performances from Richard Harris, Ian Holm, Anthony Hopkins, and Omar Sharif.  As has been oft-noted, Mr. Harris in particular delivers srong work.  One of the weaker plotlines involves the lead female character, portrayed by Shirley Knight.  It is no fault of the actress, who seems to struggle with a rather ill-defined role.  The problem lies in the ""romance"" between her character and the ship's captain (Sharif).  Once we know the two are involved in a tryst, not much is developed throughout the film despite numerous scenes dealing with their involvement (or rahter, lack thereof as the captain appears utterly disinterested in the woman).  Basically it seemed like a tacked-on attempt to appease the need to include a leading lady.

In a movie with such a palpable sense of realistic doom, there are still flashes of very sly humor.  I particularly enjoyed the Titanic references that occasionally popped up.  Roy Kinnear is highly amusing as the ship's activity director who must continue trying to bring good cheer to the 1,200 passengers who are well aware of the peril they face.

Definitely worthy viewing for fans of disaster movies (thrillers in general, really) OR of any of the distinguished actors that make up the excellent cast.",1187740800,4,2667,4.966216216216216
1876841,5,B000092Q5E,"Juggernaut was more or less lumped in with the disaster movie genre when it came out in the mid-70s, possibly because the making of the film itself seemed so disastrous. Originally a Bryan Forbes film, Forbes was briefly replaced by Don Medford (who had also briefly taken over The Guns of Navarone after Alexander MacKendrick was fired and before J. Lee Thompson was hired) before Richard Lester took over. While it's easy to spot some of the typical Lester touches (such as poor offscreen jokes added during the dubbing sessions), it's so unlike most of his other films that you constantly find yourself wondering who directed what.

Regardless of where the credit lies, the end result is a terrific thriller, with Richard Harris' bomb disposal team parachuted to Omar Sharif's liner with several bombs aboard while Anthony Hopkins tries to track down the extortionist in London. The bomb disposal scenes are genuinely tense, the characterisation surprisingly strong enough to undercut potential clich?s and Alan Plater's dialog quite superb, with the film offering both the required suspense and a neat little state-of-the-nation address of Britain in the early 70s. Really rather terrific.",1145750400,5,1193,5.2460732984293195
1876842,4,B000092Q5E,"Here we go again with yet another disaster style epic from the 1970s. You know how the routine goes, don't you? Hire a bunch of big Hollywood names, some up and comers and some over the hill, and plop them down in the middle of a life-threatening situation. Irwin Allen made a career out of these types of films, weighing in with movies like ""Earthquake,"" ""The Swarm,"" ""When Time Ran Out,"" ""The Towering Inferno,"" and a bunch of other titles. Some chap named Ronald Neame brought us a movie about an ocean liner turned upside down by a tidal wave in the 1972 classic ""The Poseidon Adventure,"" which Irwin Allen promptly followed up a few years later with ""Beyond the Poseidon Adventure."" Obviously, the law of diminishing returns kicked in with this much product floating around, and the disaster movie quietly slipped into coma until Hollywood resurrected the formula at the end of the 1990s with movies like ""Armageddon,"" ""Dante's Peak,"" and several others. One film that seems to have slipped through the cracks, however, is Richard Lester's 1974 thriller ""Juggernaut."" Here it is, given to us on DVD by none other than MGM. It's an interesting entry in the disaster genre.

It's important to note that Lester readily subscribed to the idea that a disaster film needs an all-star cast. To meet this goal he hired Omar Sharif, Richard Harris, David Hemmings, Anthony Hopkins, Ian Holm, Freddie Jones, Shirley Knight, Clifton James, Julian Glover, and Roy Kinnear to play major and minor parts. If you don't recognize some of these names, you'll likely recognize their faces. Taken together these actors have made probably a few thousand films. Anyway, the plot is incredibly simple. An ocean liner called the Britannic sets sail from England with some 1,200 passengers aboard. Unfortunately for these folks there are also seven bombs in seven steel drums scattered throughout the ship. The first sign of trouble arrives when Nicholas Porter (Holm), the chief executive of the travel company that owns the Britannic, receives a terrifying phone call from an individual calling himself Juggernaut. This man tells Porter about the bombs on the boat, and demands that the company pay him half a million pounds within twenty-four hours. If someone decides to drag their feet, the bombs will detonate and sink the ship. Yummy. Predictably the cops and the government enter the picture, namely in the form of Scotland Yard investigator John McCleod (Hopkins) and bomb disposal expert Anthony Fallon (Harris).

The passengers, despite the best efforts of Social Director Curtain (Kinnear) to cheer them up, soon discover exactly what's going on. They can't leave the ship, however, since a storm in the North Atlantic makes using the lifeboats a risky proposition. All they can do is sit helplessly by as Fallon and his crack commandos parachute into the sea and climb aboard the ship to defuse the explosives. Standing by to assist in the tricky operation is the ship's captain Alex Brunel (Sharif), his main squeeze Barbara Bannister (Knight), and McCleod's wife and two children who just happen to be passengers on the boat. Fallon soon discovers that Juggernaut is a crafty devil, an expert bomb maker with abilities that may well surpass his own. The movie from this point forward falls into the predictable pattern of showing us the passengers moving about the boat at the behest of Social Director Curtain, scenes of McCleod trying to track down Juggernaut back in London, and Nicholas Porter arguing with the government over the effectiveness of caving into the demands of the terrorist. Seeing as how ""Juggernaut"" is a bomb thriller, you can bet your bottom dollar that we'll see a scene where Fallon agonizes over which wire to cut. Red or blue? Times a wastin'!

I went back and forth with ""Juggernaut."" No one can argue with the level of talent here, as every one involved turns in a solid performance. Unintentional snickers, though, must go to Roy Kinnear for his spirited rendition of ""Roll Out the Barrels."" It's also nice to see Roshan Seth in a small role as Azad, a lowly servant on the ship who makes the ultimate sacrifice (love that Al Pacino haircut too, man!). What I do take exception with is the uneven character development. I suspect a lot of footage ended up on the cutting room floor in order to make the film move along faster because some of the interactions between characters don't carry much weight. You'd think McCleod would be on edge with his wife and kids on the boat, but he looks like he's ready for a nap. Too, the relationship between Bannister and Brunel seems superficial and doesn't add anything to the plot. Perhaps the greatest sin committed by Lester's movie involves what I call Annoying Kid Syndrome. I kept waiting for someone to strap McCleod's offspring to one of the bombs, or at least throw them overboard. These two are like fingernails on a chalkboard! But the tension works at times, Harris hams it up every chance he gets, and the ending is riveting despite being a clich.

MGM saw fit to give us ""Juggernaut"" with a trailer as the only extra, sad to say, but the picture quality looks very sharp. It's letterboxed, too. If you're a nut for these types of movies--the disaster movies of the 1970s, that is--I say give this one a shot. I'm struggling about how many stars I should give the movie. ""Juggernaut"" hovers somewhere between three and four due to the problems cited above, but the fact that it redeems itself at the end should count for something. Most importantly, it lacks the utter ridiculousness of many of Irwin Allen's destruction epics. Let's round up and say four for the overall effort. It's a good way to spend a couple of hours.",1128124800,7,5702,4.851129363449692
