1253301,3,B00002EQ0H,This is an easy movie to watch.  Nice if you just want to be entertained and not think too hard. very predictable,1370649600,,113,4.136363636363637
1253302,4,B00002EQ0H,Joseph Fiennes can always make the most mediocre movie seem great.  Monica Potter is a terrific actress as well and the two of them pull the movie off.  Rufus Sewell's character wasn't well written but he did the best he could with it and the other guy in it just came off very unbelievable and more dorky than anything else.,1370131200,,325,4.4
1253303,5,B00002EQ0H,A cute show....plots and sub plots and the humor between the guys was priceless.  Having a son who had friends over from the time he was in kindergarten until graduation from college....I witnessed the things boys can say and do.....the show reminded me of those fun times.,1365638400,,273,4.808510638297872
1253304,2,B00002EQ0H,"This sounded like just our kind of film with some of our very favorite actors.  Not even Rufus Sewell could save this film from such a predictable, unexciting plot.  This should have been much, much better.",1362700800,,206,4.694444444444445
1253305,3,B00002EQ0H,"Both the comedy and the romance in this movie were just okay.  Many things were overdone and not believeable.  If you are bored it maybe okay, but you can likely find a better movie to spend your time watching.",1361664000,,210,4.358974358974359
1253319,3,B00002EQ0H,"I really do love Monica Potter. This movie was a bit disjointed - I wasn't expecting that the story was going to be told in non-chronological order. It's sort of sappy, and I don't really like Potter's character, though Fiennes looks great. I'd recommend watching this if it was free, but I wouldn't pay a lot to see it.",1355788800,,320,4.440677966101695
1253320,5,B00002EQ0H,The movie arrived very fast. The movie itself is a cute little romantic comedy that I was having a hard time finding elsewhere.,1354579200,,127,4.565217391304348

1253322,2,B00002EQ0H,"After reading other's reviews, I thought this was a good selection for me.  However, it is one of the worst movies I have watched in some time. It is pointless, and there is nothing funny or charming about it. Just totally boring. I felt like the actors were even ashamed to be in it. Don't waste your time or money if you like some semblence of a plot, good acting, and comedy. It has none of the above.",1272412800,2,404,4.17948717948718

1253324,5,B00002EQ0H,"If you could spin a tight yarn like this, you too would be rich or at least be quite the ladies man!  I had low expectations and was blown away.  This movie is in my top ten favorites of all time.  Well cast.  Well acted.  Excellent dialogue.  This falls into the category of chick flick, of which I am a hapless officianado, but honestly it's all about the guys. You will like every character.  When it's over you'll probably want to go to London--and you'll keep your eyes open on the way.",1232755200,,491,4.271739130434782
1253325,5,B00002EQ0H,"A delightful romp of a romantic comedy. What makes it stand out from most other Hollywood romances about love at first sight is that it is a very funny caricature of introverts and extroverts. The movie makes absolutely no pretense about being realistic (someone falls in love in...exactly...thirty seconds - did the director time this scene?). You watch this movie for the facial expressions, the body language, the fleeting touches, for laughing at who is really paying attention, and who is not.  Who puts the moves on and who does not. Who calls a woman the most times and who does  not.

If you read a book like ""Are you my type, Am I Yours? Relationships Made Easy Through the Enneagram"" which tells you how to recognize successful and unsuccessful achievers (type 3) and romantics (type 4), and then watch this movie over again, then you will pick up on all kinds of things you don't notice the first time. There's hardly any character development (not supposed to be - they're caricatures) but in a way it is a really groundbreaking movie because it came out in 1999. Today you find all these webpages out there like ""The Mind of an Introvert: Why We Act the Way We Do"" ""How Introverts Communicate"" and ""Introverts in an Extroverts World."" You've got books like ""The Introvert Advantage"" and ""The Introvert & Extrovert in Love"", most of which have all come out just within the last 3-6 years. You've got the author of  ""Good to Great"" telling us that 40% of top CEOs have introverted tendencies and wikipedia telling us how extroverts and introverts minds are really different. What is really amazing is that this movie was ahead of the curve, it came out before all these ideas became so widespread.

And perhaps it's because of all the introverts out there that this movie is rated so highly.",1230940800,3,1802,4.707936507936508
1253326,5,B00002EQ0H,"The Very Thought of You is a sweet, cute, and fun film that has a good cast and characters you just get interested in for no apparent reason besides the fact that they are there. It does seem highly coincidental that a young woman could meet three guys who are all best friends over the course of a couple days but why let that stop you from watching the film? Suspension of disbelief is a wonderful thing.

This movie is a good romantic comedy that lets you escape an otherwise mundane morning, afternoon, or evening and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the type of movie that can do that. In fact, I might just go do that later.

The only problem I found with the film (but I don't let that hinder the joy I find in it) is the fact that we start the movie near the end of the story and then it flashes back to the story and how we got to the place we started with. All well and good but the film makers went with the idea of overlapping dialogue, so we have to hear some of the same dialogue (nearly a whole conversation) again. That's not a good thing in my book. It seems more like a trick on the writer's part (and Director's) to make the movie longer without actually having to do more original work. But let it be thus. As I said, this movie is still enjoyable and easily sets itself up as a winner. I myself thought of buying a one-way ticket to the first place available on 99 dollars after watching the movie. There is just something about it that makes you want adventure, romance, and a little piece of the universe to find humorous. Enjoy!",1200700800,,1561,4.2
1253327,4,B00002EQ0H,"I mainly bought this movie because I loved ""I'm with Lucy"" which starred Monica Potter. This movie was fun to watch.  It's crazy to imagine meeting your soul mate within 48 hours and also his two best friends who also like you.  I liked how the story was told in each characters point of view, which was different and unexpected. This is definitely a ""chick flick"" :)",1168300800,,367,4.462686567164179
1253328,4,B00002EQ0H,"It's sweet, funny, and thoughful.  Girl meets guy, and his 2 (jerky) best friends, each unaware that they've met & fallen for the same girl.  She's unaware that she is also lusted after by the two best friends of the guy she's fallen for.  Confusion ensues.  Guy makes a life-changing choice, despite the fact that he thinks he's lost the girl, and winds up with the girl after all.  The two (former) best friends are left behind, not realizing what actually happened.

A bit confusing in the way it's told: in flash-backs, but all in all a great story about finding love in the least-expected of places, and not letting one's life stagnate.",1143244800,,641,4.628318584070796
1253338,3,B00002EQ0H,"This movie is one more amiable, if slight, entry in the seemingly endless romantic comedy derby. In this one, Monica Potter turns her special, Valentine's Day adorable bunny rabbit charm on three feckless Englishmen (a well-worn character in the romantic comedy genre on both sides of the Atlantic but increasingly annoying in its English incarnation), the best known of whom is Joseph Fiennes (who looks rather weaker and sillier than I recall him looking in most of his films). The plot is heavy on circumstance and happenstance and weak on character and emotional involvement. I never really felt that there was the slightest chemistry between the two leads. Ms. Potter, a sweet if somewhat cloying actress with almost aggressive American good-looks, works hard to convince us of her convictions which amount to needing to change her entire life from the ground up. Looking at her we can hardly believe that any of the things which she tells us about her terrible past are true. She is just too clean and too terrifically healthy and downright pretty to have had a trying youth and a less than boisterously successful present. As for Mr. Fiennes, we don't get Will Shakespeare, we get Hugh Grant Lite (thanks, Mr. Grant, for raising stammering diffidence from mere character affect to complete character status) a tongue-tied fool who just cannot speak when he needs to. The wonderful Ray Winstone - pre-Sexy Beast - is used here merely as a foil through which this backward-told tale is related. The unfolding of the plot is clever enough and the players congenial enough to make this film easy to sit through. I gave it three stars, but it deserves more like 2 .",1140825600,2,1667,4.873239436619718
1253339,3,B00002EQ0H,"This is a cute date flick, pop the wine cork, and throw the popcorn in the microwave.  Sure, the coincidence of three best London male friends falling for one Minneapolis blonde-haired woman in a few days is unlikely in real life, but film is not real life.  If it were, we would be watching non-stop documentaries or less contrived reality TV.

So I'll go along with the quirky, desperate attempt by little Miss Nobody, Monica Potter, Marsha from Minneapolis (a Mary Tyler Moore with a bad attitude) attempt to fly anywhere; just get me out of town and on to my new life where little people are appreciated.  Then she meets in succession: the wealthy short person in the music business, his friend, the failed child actor, and Joseph Fiennes, a bridge teacher.  I think they could have come up with a more believable occupation for cynical Shakespeare in Love, but the man is handsome and your date will warm up for later activities.",1137110400,,934,4.670731707317073
1253340,5,B00002EQ0H,Highly recommended! Thought it was great! One of the best romantic comedies I've seen.,1099180800,,86,5.214285714285714
1253341,5,B00002EQ0H,"This movie, which by the way is actually called ""Martha meet Frank, Daniel and Lawrence"" (too complicated for the American market???), Britains Daily Mail lables ""The best romantic commedy EVER - and it's British!"". Being no friend of Romantic commedies in general, I find myself not having anything to add to this. This is as un-Hollywood as can be, although it sports the usual Happy End with a kiss. But man, this is the first time I actually wanted this to happen... ;-)
You might aswell buy it, because you end up renting it again anyways...
PS: The original title hints at the plot and the way it is narrated....changing it was a big mistake!
PPS: Just breezed through the reviews and noticed that some people found the plot implausible.(!) WELL, OF COURSE IT IS! But that's totally beside the point! How plausible is ""Much Ado about Nothing""?? Doesn't make it any worse a play, now does it?",1084838400,8,897,4.6835443037974684
1253342,5,B00002EQ0H,"This was how i came to know this video so maybe thats just the british version. To me that title just denotes the meandering quality of the film. I like the way fate worked in this movie and although it was hopelessly unrealistic I enjoyed it alot. It was very funny and Joseph Fiennes gives an excellent performance in his role as caught-in-the-middle lawrence, and despite the fantatical nature of the storyline the friendship the three men have is so true to life you can believe in it. They are all very good actors. If you, like me, find yourself drawn to romantic movies with happy endings do yourself a favour and watch this.",1082505600,3,632,4.552631578947368
1253343,3,B00002EQ0H,"The 'Very Thought of You' was one of those guilty little pleasures we all take in vegetating on a cold day while successfully procrastinating away from some project.  I watched it on my laptop during an open house on a rainy day (very few visitors), and it was the perfect sort of movie for that particular situation.  The plot is not complex at all (good for frequent stoppages), though the acting appropriately highlights the best parts of the script.  It's an off-beat sort of romantic comedy from a screenwriter who should come out with better things in the future.  Monica Potter and Joseph Fiennes give believable performances as hopeless romantics looking for a better life.  Friends, foreign travel, and two minor injuries to Fiennes' character mixes up their plans.",1068768000,4,774,4.9689922480620154
1253344,3,B00002EQ0H,"""The Very Thought of You"" is perhaps typical of the many chick flicks out there.  It involves a couple of thoroughly enjoyable devices and concepts, though, that aren't always found in the common movie, such as mistaken identities; story telling through different sets of eyes; unfettered, spontaneous travel and Joseph Fiennes.  I bought it on an extremely impulsive whim and regret it. Rent it, don't buy it.",1034035200,5,410,5.104477611940299
1253345,3,B00002EQ0H,"This may horrify Joeseph Fiennes fans, who seem to be this movie's main audience, but he is not the best thing about it.  No, neither is Monica Potter, although she has an easy charm and a truly gorgeous smile.  The best thing about the film are the three hilarious supporting performances.  Tom Hollander is great as an unlikely rock star and ego-maniac, Ray Winstone charming as the ""psychiatrist"" and Rufus Sewell constantly giggle-inducing as the unemployed and unemployable actor (the best scene has got to be him on the bus shouting ""I love my mother"" and hyper-ventilating about an upcoming audition).  Anyhow, despite great work from these three, the movie suffers from being so outrageously implausible.  Oh well, it's a romantic comedy, and it is a lot of fun.  Just remember: T.H, R.W, and R.S. are the real stars here!",1014249600,7,830,4.892857142857143
1253346,5,B00002EQ0H,"Some people might scoff at my 5 star rating of this film, but compared to most movies made today, it is deserved. I initially watched this movie because I am a huge Joseph Fiennes fan, but I loved everything about it. It is a charming love story, the kind that you wish would happen in your own life. Monica Potter is so much like Julia Roberts it's a little weird at first, but she is quite wonderful. Anyway, I have watched this movie quite a few times, and I will more than likely watch it a few more. After all, one can never get enough of Mr. Fiennes!!",1011225600,10,557,4.166666666666667
1253347,4,B00002EQ0H,The movie was enjoyable but did hop around abit. It was clever the way it was arranged. Thought Monica could easily double for Julia Roberts. Same facial expressions and the voice was nearly an exact match. All the lines were the same that Julia would have said (spoken in the same way) if she had the part. Perhaps she could become the next Julia Roberts.,1003881600,,356,4.492307692307692
1253356,5,B00002EQ0H,"I rented this movie because I saw Monica Potter on the cover and decided to read what it was about and when I did I thought it was worth a rental. I kept thinking it would be the average girl falls for boy comedy and I was wrong. The movie was unlike any romance I have seen in a while. The movie is about a girl who wants to start over in London and runs in to this guy who tries very hard to charm her,but it won't work for her. In London she meets another guy who falls for her,but again he just wasn't for her. Then finds the right one later in the movie. The only thing is,the three guys are all friends. I don't have to say that this movie turns out to be a pleasant treat. Monica Potter is hilareous as the lead. Joseph Finnes is great. The movie is a wonderful romance that will keep you laughing.

I was absolutely delighted with this movie's characters and dialogue, but mostly was delightfully amused by the way the story was laid out:  beginning at almost the end and then going back and tying it all together with lots of twists and turns thrown in to keep the viewer's interest.  I thought the film immensely cleverly done, and the acting was superb.  In a comedic farce like this, one can't expect exhaustive character development, but the characters in this were certainly developed sufficiently for the story line.  All in all, a delight!

What we eneded up watching was an endearing romantic comedy with great repartee and interesting plot development.  The story of Martha (Monica Potter) and her unplanned trip to London causes her to meet lifelong buddies Daniel (Tom Hollander), Lawrence (Joseph Fiennes) and Frank (Rufus Sewell) who, independently and at different times, met and fell in love with her.  The narrative moves backwards and forwards, gradually filling in gaps until we see the story of the three men unfold.

Monica Potter is amazing as this confused American who goes to London on a whim to start over.  After an incredible series of events, she runs into a guy at the airport (literally) and falls for him.  If you've ever seen someone somewhere and hated yourself for not talking to them because you just KNOW they were ""the one"" for you, then you'll love this film.  I can't recommend it highly enough!

1253373,4,B00002EQ0H,"Rented on a whim and with nary an expectation, The Very Thought of You proves surprisingly entertaining.  The leads, Joseph Fiennes and Monica Potter, are, of course, sufficiently overly-qualified in the areas of  talent and beauty as to make one wonder how they were lured into this  quirky, unambitious, yet endearing love story -- all the better for us the  viewing audience!  The cross-cutting story line is cleverly played out  between the various persona inamorata and the  past and present tenses.  I  would agree that character development is not all it _could_ be, but this  is more a backhanded compliment than a true criticism: I was sad when the  time was up and happily could have sat through 30 or 40 more minutes.  Those who would turn their noses at the admittedly implausible premise of  love at first sight (amid the busyness of Gatwick Airport?) perhaps have  forgotten the adrenaline rush acting upon an instant attraction can  produce.  I, for one, have never had the courage (or perhaps foolhardiness,  considering the times we live in...) to offer a charming stranger a ride in  his own car in return for dinner served on a balcony under a starlit night  -- but I did instantly love the _idea_ of such a scenario.  On behalf of  'sports-loving romantics' everywhere, this flick gets my thumbs-up approval  and a goofy smile, as well.",953683200,26,1356,4.855263157894737
1253374,5,B00002EQ0H,"the very thought of you is amazing film because it is funny without all of the big gymics movies use today.  the characters are more deep than most movies let writers take them.  what is most great about this film is that  the actors charm without seeming to try and light of the screen with  picture perfect chemistry.  Joseph Fiennes and Monica Potter act so  tenderly and real together that you believe, without a doubt, they are ment  for each other.  The film is small but don't those always leave you with  the best and longest lasting impressions.",952905600,5,554,4.571428571428571
1253375,5,B00002EQ0H,"I first saw this movie when travelling from Australia to London on a Qantas flight. I was giggling for the full length of the movie, the only problem I had was trying to remember the title - ""Martha, Meet Frank,  Daniel and Laurence"" - a shocker - good to see that's the USA renamed it.  All the actors are great and well casted, although I have always been a fan  of Ray Winstone who plays the shrink Pedersen. The music is well suited and  has made me look closer at Ed Shearmur. I then went on to buy the sound  track. A good movie to watch with your companion.",952041600,4,564,4.137614678899083

1253377,5,B00002EQ0H,"I must say the title does not do this justice.  This story really took me by storm.  It is very well written, with intriguing characters, and wonderful cinematography.  It has a similar feel as ""Sliding  Doors"" - with all the wit included.",948240000,6,239,4.619047619047619
1253378,5,B00002EQ0H,"Irresistibly charming! As he did in Shakespeare In Love, Joseph Fiennes brings his remarkable charm and devilish good looks to this wonderful tale of true love in the new millennium. The always beautiful Monica Potter,  with her electrifying smile and wonderful persona lights up the screen, and  tops her performance in the box office hit Patch Adams. The film, which  deals with the misadventures of 3 British guys who fall for the same girl,  brings an irrepressible smile to the face of anyone who watches. Whether  you are a man or woman, if you are a fan of true love, then this movie  should be at the top of your must see list for the new millennium!",947462400,9,658,4.581196581196581
1253379,4,B00002EQ0H,"A very sweet (without cloying) film--the most satisfying romantic comedy I've seen since When Harry Met Sally.... and yes, Joe vs. the Volcano.  Sure, it didn't have the big-name stars of Nora Ephron's later formula  romantic comedies Sleepless in Seattle and You've Got Mail (yes, Nora  Ephron knows what sells even if it is manipulative),but the film's utter  charm lies in its simplicity, especially Monica Potter's understated and  delicious performance as Martha.  Demonstrating that less is definitely  more, she has no need to draw from the bag of romantic comedy tricks  including the manufactured, artifical ear-to-ear grins and calculatingly  cute turn of the heads that other actresses of the genre have cheaply  relied on.  The result is a performance of depth, and the entire cast and  production crew obviously worked very hard to have produced this  mouth-watering confection of a film.  Monica, YOU'RE WONDERFUL!",947289600,4,928,5.354166666666667
1253380,4,B00002EQ0H,"Funny romantic comedy!  If you enjoy Julia Roberts, you will enjoy this movie that is both lighthearted and fast-paced. The plot opens with a american girl(Potter), who on a whim to escape her current life, buys the  first plane ticket anywhere for ninety nine dollars, and ends up in London  where she meets brits Frank, Daniel, and Lawrence.  It is a treat to see  Joseph Fiennes in a contemporary film, (much different from the other roles  we've seen him in so far) It will be interesting to see his upcoming work  in Forever Mine and Enemy at the Gates.",947289600,6,558,4.575757575757576
1253381,4,B00002EQ0H,"If you want a plausible, realistic, it could happen movie, you won't find it with ""The Very Thought of You.""  As a dedicated fan of Rufus Sewell I did not like his character; however, I never noticed just how  utterly romantic Joseph Finnes could be.  Just one look at those puppy dog  eyes and I would fogive, forget and fall in love all over again.  I also  enjoyed Monica Potter's performance as a woman who wants to believe in love  but has a hard time forgetting her track record.  A chick flick that is  great for a first date.  What a dream to just pack it up and start all over  again.....",946944000,,597,4.241071428571429
1253382,3,B00002EQ0H,"In a totally implausible coincidence 3 English guys, friends, bump into the same, very attractive American girl, unbeknownst to each other. This happens within a few hours of her taking off from Minneapolis and arriving  in London - we live in the jet age. From this starting point the plot gets  increasingly daffy. She flits in and out of their day driving them crazy,  and in a flicker of an eyelid she falls instantly for one of them: Not  telling, but if you watch the film you'll soon guess! The lighting is  theatrical, and gives the ambience of Miami rather than London. The  affection, love (call it what you will), which the three mates have for the  American chick (Martha played by Monica Potter) is way stilted, but maybe  that's what the script called for: One thing for sure, Monica Potter holds  this film together with her delivery of lines, confidence in her role and  photogenic presence - I guarantee we are going to see much more of her in  the future!",945734400,8,973,4.598837209302325

And I have kept watching it since then, a ton, always noticing new things and finding even more to laugh about! This is truly a gem, a vastly overlooked gem. Monica Potter is great as always and I LOVE Joseph Fiennes (check out Shakespeare in Love while you're at it!), and Tom Holland was hilarious!
