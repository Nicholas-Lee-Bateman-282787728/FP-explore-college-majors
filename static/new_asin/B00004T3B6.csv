1349017,4,B00004T3B6,"When Dinosaurs Ruled was TLC's solution to the cancellation of their other popular documentary series on prehistoric life, called PaleoWorld. If you haven't seen it and are at all interested in this set then I highly recommend looking for it, although it's hard to find nowadays. Paleoworld and When Dinosaurs Ruled have a lot of overlap, in themes, information, and layout.
When Dinosaurs Ruled features five episodes, around 45 minutes each. The episodes mainly focus on particular regions of the world during particular ages, and looks at the dinosaurs from there. There are some great interviews with world renowned Paleontologists, including Bob Bakker, Phil Currie, Paul Sereno, and many others. Jeff Goldblum, whom the show clearly snatched up after the success of Jurassic Park 1 and 2, provides the narration. I've found there's some controversy regarding his narration style, but for me it works. He offers a lively narrative, even if he sometimes mispronounces complicated names or places. The show often displays earth on a digitized map and demonstrates the morphing of the continents over time, such as the break up of Pangea. Once in awhile some decent animations or animatronics of dinosaurs make an appearence, but mostly its fact based and interview oriented, unlike the BBC series Walking With Dinosaurs, which is completely different from what is here.
As I mentioned earlier, the series is very similar to TLC's PaleoWorld. Almost all of the music is taken straight from that series, as well as significant information on select dinosaurs, such as Cryolophosaurus, Carnotaurus, and Tyrannosaurus Rex, among others. It does offer plenty of other information on new dinosaurs and prehistoric areas (such as cretaceous Australia) never featured in PaleoWorld. There are many things missing here that were abundant in PaleoWorld, but the one change that I dislike the most is the lack of Paleo-Art. Basically just images and artists' renderings of the extinct animals in their environs, they made PaleoWorld have a very relaxed, well balanced pace, and depicted dinosaurs in various, interesting ways. Here, there is next to none, instead When Dinosaurs Ruled opts for more scenic shots to represent the past environments or recycled footage of dinosaur animations, which brings me to the more negative points.
Some of the animations used are okay, and there's even some stop motion which isn't half bad. The problem is how often they reuse it. Seriously, we're seeing the same shot of a Tyrannosaurs Rex stomping through the forest in choppy, slow motion, and the show tries to trick the audience by first saying what dinosaur it is supposed to represent, even though it is clearly the same one over and over again. I may have picked up on this so severely because I watched all the episodes back to back. A viewer who casually tuned in to watch one episode back in the broadcast day or missed the first episode might not have noticed as much, but even then, there are episodes where the same footage is recycled several times throughout. In particular, the T.rex I already mentioned, as well as a small meat eating dinosaur running around on two legs, which is used to depict multiple dinosaurs, everything from a baby T.rex to Leaylleanosaura to a dinosaur called Kirky.
Another issue I have with the show is some of the science. Even though much of it is still relevant today, the show tends to make fairly outlandish conclusions and hypotheses on dinosaurs based on little supporting evidence. Some huge mistakes now recognized as being wrong plague all the episodes, some more severely than others. Some examples: A T.rex skeleton is being unearthed in episode 2 (Real Jurassic Park). It is estimated to be 65 feet long. That is roughly 20 feet longer than the biggest T.rex described. In the episode about South America, the giant predator Megaraptor--not well known at the time, mind you--is shown as a dromaeosaurid with huge sickle claws on its toes, now known not to be a raptor and its sickle claw was actually a hand claw. Anyone who has seen Jurassic Park 3 knows Spinosaurus had a crocodilian shaped head. Well, here in episode 3 we see a Spinosaurus incorrectly depicted with a typical carnosaur skull. Many other facts have since been cleared up or re-written. What makes PaleoWorld better than When Dinosaurs Ruled in this regard is that much of Paleoworld's science is mere explanation. Plenty of the proposed views on these dinosaurs are treated as such. Rarely are any facts cemented as being truth, they almost always make a point of stating alternate or related views. Here, the audience is often shown or told only one of many possible truths.
Despite these scientific discrepancies, the show still packs plenty of substantiated science in, much of it as up-to-date as it gets. If you can get over the recycled dinosaur footage and focus on the actual information being shown, When Dinosaurs Ruled is worth the watch. All TLC needs to do now is release an official collection of PaleoWorld so I can quit watching my old VHS tapes of it and toss them like I did my VHS of When Dinosaurs Ruled.",1367107200,5,5133,4.976717112922002
1349018,4,B00004T3B6,"The description should include the episode which are :
Ground Zero
the real Jurassic Park
the land that time Forgot
At the end of the earth
birth of the giants.
Had I known this I would not have bought thisDVD As I have bought them individually before",1365638400,3,251,4.361702127659575
1349019,4,B00004T3B6,Like the four or more other such filmsI've talked about it was only ok for me. I have about a dozen of these kinds of films and they seem pretty much about the same. I did like Jeff Goldblum's way of talking about the dinosaurs; I believe because of the dinosaur movies about Jurassic Park that he starred in. So this one was more enjoyable for me than the others particularly I think for that reason..,1353369600,,402,4.302631578947368
1349020,5,B00004T3B6,My son loves dinosaurs and has almost every DVD there is. This one is one of the best. Learn alot and keeps a 4 year old watching so must be interesting.,1327017600,6,153,3.967741935483871
1349021,5,B00004T3B6,"This series isn't for someone with a short attention span, it goes into depth, and isn't quite as well-paced as Walking with Dinosaurs. There isn't quite as much action, and the 3d effects aren't that great looking here and now in 2010. With that said, it can often to into greater depth than Walking with Dinosaurs, and if you love dinosaurs and don't need fancy 3d effects, I highly recommend it for your collection.",1285459200,4,418,4.662162162162162
1349022,5,B00004T3B6,"I am still facinated by dinosaurs, and enjoy learning about them. I have read a lot of books, now I like to watch the DVDs so I have purchased several. Some are more entertaining and I believe for younger people. These are for older people who want to know and understand dinosaurs. We can't know exactly how they looked or lived. But the Paleoentologists can try to understand by following the evidence. These dvds are pretty good with the information. In a few years some of it may be proven wrong, but you will have learned about dinosaurs that have been found in the past few years, that information won't change. This set has dinosaurs that I have never heard of, and talks about some I have heard of but couldn't find in books. The dinosaurs do not look or move as well as the ones in Walking With, but that is not the basis for these DVDs. They are to inform and I think they do a good job. I also like Jeff Goldblum's voice, it does fade out in a few places, but nothing to bad.",1259539200,7,986,4.25
1349023,4,B00004T3B6,"If you are looking for the spectacular computer animated dinosaurs that are found in 'Walking With Dinosaurs', look somewhere else.  This set doesn't have them.  What it does have, however, is a lot of wonderful, up to date, fact based information on dinosaurs not found anywhere else.  It is enough to keep a five year olds' attention, and intelligent enough to pull me into watching it as well.
I have a five year old son who is absolutely ga-ga for dinosaurs, and voraciously watches anything he can find on them, pours over books about them, spends hours putting together and taking apart puzzles of them, colors endless quantities of pictures of them - in short, anything with a dinosaur on the cover he wants.  When he saw this, there was nothing for it but to buy it.  I have to say I don't regret it for a minute.
To be honest, I purchased this not expecting much.  I had read reviews of others and thought it would be inferior to anything else out there, but might keep him occupied for a while.  To be fair, the animation is substandard, you can tell that it was made for tv, and the editing isn't the greatest.  However, I found myself watching it with him, facinated dispite myself.  The information is presented in an easy to listen to maner, with graphs, charts, and animation that(while substandard compared to Walking With Dinosaurs)gives you a feel for the size and weight these creatures must have had.  And, being that they were produced in 2000, the information is more up to date than most everything else out there with facinating new discoveries.
True, there is repetion of content from one DVD to the next, but the repetion deals more with the basics of dinosaur evolution and the relevent time periods than repeating information about the individual dinosaurs themselves.  While the repetition can be frustrating for adults, it also means that each of the DVDs stands on it's own, and can be watched in any order.
In short, I found this set, while a bit pricey, to be worth it, and am not sorry I got it at all.",1034726400,33,2036,4.596685082872928
1349024,4,B00004T3B6,"I didn't think this DVD would be as good as ""Walking With Dinosaurs"", but it's different. The animation isn't as good (it's good enough) but there is a lot of information you wouldn't have heard before,  it has the very latest information.
  If your interested in Dinosaurs get  this DVD, if you're more interested in good animation get ""Walking  With Dinosaurs"". I think both are worth buying.",961113600,15,394,4.82089552238806

7922270,2,B00004T3B6,Boring and not worth the cost.  Narration by Jeff Goldblum (no doubt grabbed because of his Jurassic Park fame) was extremely annoying and he couldn't pronounce names of dinosaurs.  Computer graphics considering this was made after Jurassic Park and CG was advancing were awful - either a picture of a plastic dinosaur or a drawing and what CG they had made spinosaurus walk like he had saddle sores and the others amateurish.  This is definitely for very young kids who don't know the difference.  .,1442793600,,500,4.847058823529411

7922276,1,B00004T3B6,"What a shame. All of this valuable information lost to loud booming music and Jeff Goldblum's low muttering narration. I do love Jeff Goldblum as an actor, but if I'm going to be taxed with having to dissect every other word he says, at least get rid of the music! Or maybe it could just be low background music. The information stands on it's own...I don't need loud music and a famous person who cannot speak clearly to give it to me. The information is 4-star, but the delivery of the info is 1-star.",1377648000,2,503,4.361702127659575
