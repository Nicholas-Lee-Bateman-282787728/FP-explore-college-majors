1234815,3,B00000JNCI,"This movie is one of the first horror movies I'd ever seen. I was very young when seeing it on TV, and it really affected me for years. The scenes with the Nun and also the hallway scenes of people eating people and stuff  were very shocking and unforgettable(especially in my case,being so young!)
Upon seeing it years later, it still disturbed me, but then the  silliness of the story got to me and I was able to see it in it's shoddy  light.
An ok, but kinda yucky,sticks-to-the-mind movie.",922233600,3,493,4.455555555555556
1234816,5,B00000JNCI,"This movie is truly amazing. It is in the same vein like Rosemary's Baby. I think it is better, because many things that are implied in that movie here are shown in gross detail.  The cast is all star, from Burgess Meredith to Chistopher Walken. The story is just awesome. I first saw this horror movie when I was a child, and then could not sleep for some days...  This video release has a non-related cover,  but has many many scenes that the tv version has edited out. They are truly strong! This video is a must-have.  END",890870400,,526,4.336734693877551

1234827,1,B00000JNCI,"I LOVE horror films, esp. non-slasher ones. I LIVE on the Upper West Side and will watch almost anything with NYC as a setting. Chris Sarandon is a a criminally underrated and unknown actor.  Look at this cast, who apparently had all made a deal with Satan himself that required their services in this piece of crap!
This LOOOONNGGG scareless, nonsensical joke is perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen, given the talent on board.  Even the ""nudity"" is hilariously bad and off putting and by today's standards so tame as to be laughable.
DO NOT WASTE TIME FROM YOUR PRECIOUS LIFE ON THIS ""FILM""",1479686400,,594,4.647619047619048
1234828,5,B00000JNCI,"I have always loved this film. As the horror genre goes, it is a compellingly frightening story; a decent narrative with a minimum of special effects (1970s vintage). Not the blockbuster hit that The Exorcist was of course but a quiet little, titillating scare.",1478390400,,261,4.954545454545454
1234829,1,B00000JNCI,YUK! You'd think with all the notable actors this would actually be halfway decent. It's garbage and I'm sure a low point for all involved in it's making.,1477785600,,154,4.535714285714286

1234831,4,B00000JNCI,"I am kind of just kidding; but a lot of people had a problem with Raines!! I did not!!! I feel she underplayed it, in a way that was just right!! It was not perfect, the movie itself wasn't perfect. It was better than her running around like an hysterical ditz!! She played a subdued, intelligent model, type!! Not a bimbo!! Now!!!!!!! Are you ready for this?????? Guess who Raines reminded me of???????????? Are you ready???????
""Sabrina""!!!!!!!!! ""Sabrina"" from Charlie's Angels: Kate Jackson!!!! She did have a little ""Sabrina"" thing going on!!! Do you agree???
Now for the serious part of my review!! Some other reviewers mention reading the book to help better understand the movie. I did not read it!! But it is probably true. The movie was convoluted at places!! For one - the role of the Catholic priests!! Another confusing part was the ending!!
Spoiler Alert................Spoiler Alert>>>>>>>>>>>
How and why did the circus freaks (real freaks) represent demons from Hell?? And Michael (Chris Sarandon, ""the boyfriend"") gets killed toward the end, and, apparently, becomes a ghost?? And Burgess Meredith, the head demon, throws a knife at his ghost?? Killing him again or kills his ghost?? Anyway, it was an OK movie!!! I would watch it again!!!!!",1476921600,,1259,5.028708133971292
1234832,5,B00000JNCI,"I loved The Sentinel.  It is the very type of scary movie I adore: an old house, grotesque characters. This week I've watched The Sentinel, The Inn Keepers, and Dead Silence as my rewards for grading English papers all.day.long. They've all been exactly what I hoped they'd be.

I'm watching with my 15yo son.  R-rated horror movies are sometimes on the itinerary, so it may be ok.  Well -- no!  Not only is it an R, its a hard-R.  There's lots of nudity and other questionable scenes that did not pass the 'are you comfortable watching it next to your 15yo son?' test.",1466899200,,463,4.493975903614458

She was so distractingly bad that I could not endure watching her, she was painful and for the record her name is/was Cristina Raines....God awful actress.

1234880,3,B00000JNCI,"This is a notable movie simply for the fun of watching all the stars and future stars that appear in it.  With the poor editing the weird, creepy movie tends to have a TV movie feel to it although it was made for the big screen.  Not a great movie, but still entertaining if you are into the Devil movies that were popular at this time period.  It deals with a young woman who has been living with a young man who wants to get married, but feels she needs space to think things out and evaluate her life.  She finds an apartment in a old building and many spooky things start appearing and happening to her.  On the top floor resides a blind priest who sets in front of a window all the time.  He is protecting a portal to Eden from the Devil and his minions.  Different storyline, but never quite hits the mark.

1234888,3,B00000JNCI,"If nothing else, ""The Sentinel"" is worth watching for it's amazing cast; John Carradine, Christopher Walken, Chris Sarandon, Burgess Meredith, Eli Wallach, Ava Gardner.....it's almost like a horror version of ""The Love Boat"", packed top to bottom with former A listers, B movie players and perennial genre favorites.

For years I was certain that I had seen this film, but after listening to the Horror 101 Podcast episode reviewing this film, I realize that I had not seen it, and that I was confusing this film with another 70's movie called ""The Fury"". I tracked down a copy of ""The Sentinel"" wanting to see this film that had flown under my radar for so long. I will say that I was immediately taken with that 1970's aesthetic; I love horror films of the 1970's, there is a gritty feel that seems to have been lost with the more polished 80's horror. What I also like about this film and 70's horror in general is that it aims for an adult audience, not the teen crowd.

Alison is a beautiful model, and a young woman of wealth who has had a traumatic childhood. After catching her father having an affair, she attempted to commit suicide, and we see that she has never really stabilized since that incident. Her boyfriend has a shady past, and she is still trying to discover who she is and what she wants in life. She wants to find an apartment of her own, and finds a nice furnished room in an old building overlooking Manhattan. She moves in and begins to meet her new neighbors, and friendly old man whose companions are a cat and a parakeet, a lesbian couple lives downstairs, and an old blind priest lives on the top floor of the building, rarely moving away from the window. Alison begins having nightmares, and hears someone moving around in the supposedly empty apartment over hers. It soon becomes apparent that something is very wrong with Alison's new home.

While I had an idea of where this was heading, there were a few twists and turns within the story, so I recommend you don't read too much about the plot unless you're not worried about spoilers. There are some pretty solid jolts sprinkled here and there in the film, and there is plenty of bizarre and haunting imagery throughout the film. And the top notch cast really delivers.

I almost wish I had seen this years ago, as I'm sure the nostalgic factor of re-watching this film for people who grew up with it would put it over the top. As it stands for me, well, for me it feels a bit like a retread. ""The Sentinel"" has it's moments, but honestly it feels like an amalgam of ""Rosemary's Baby"", ""Let's Scare Jessica to Death"", ""The Omen"" and a touch of ""The Exorcist"".

If you love the 70's horror aesthetic, then I recommend this film, otherwise look for your scares elsewhere..",1409097600,,2756,4.548387096774194

1234891,1,B00000JNCI,"I was surprised how badly acted this movie was with all the talent they had on board.  It takes about an hour for anything remotely interesting and then degenerates into a final scene that has numerous grotesque figures parading around as minions of hell.  That final scene combined with the non-existent acting was ludicrous.  At one point the movie looked more like a freak show at a carnival then a horror flick.  If we have learned anything...it's that evil, in most cases looks quite ordinary.  What offended me most is that there are people that are handicapped and disfigured and we are led to believe that equates with evil....really?????  This is simply one of the worst horror films I have seen...although, Prince of Darkness is a close second.",1406160000,2,754,4.8515625

Very bizarre movie has many actors including Jeff Goldblum and Burgess Meredith. It is schlocky and hokey but fun in a low budget horror movie way.

I will say, mbeing an absolute horror fanatic, I am so very glad that I own this gem!  To see the ""star power"" that they were able to cast in this movie adds to the brilliance of it, down to the very last scene with Tom Berenger and Nana Visitor.  What is great about the movie (and the book for that matter) is that NONE of the main characters are truly likeable!  Personally, I like it when a movie has these type of characters - pretty much self-absorbed narcissists that you don't really feel any sympathy for (think Rob Zombie's Halloween 2, but a movie that you actually like).  Without ruining it for anyone, my favorite scene in the entire movie, and one of creep-inducing chills that is NEVER seen in today's movies, is when Alison's Father is behind the door and walks across the room.  If you have seen the movie, you understandably can agree that just the way it was filmed is brilliant and will make even the most die-hard horror fan get a chill up their spine!

The Sentinel (1977) is a vintage '70s horror movie with an all-star cast - Burgess Meredith, Ava Gardner, Martin Balsam, Sylvia Miles, Eli Wallach, Chris Sarandon, Christopher Walken, Beverly D'Angelo, Tom Berenger, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Dreyfuss, Deborah Raffin, and on and on.  I notice some similarities to The Exorcist (1973).  A lot of people say this movie is a flat out ripoff of The Exorcist.  You'll have to judge for yourself.  I find the movie pretty entertaining, offbeat, bizarre, wicked, bloody at times, just one of those '70s movies that's quite ""out there"".  There is a lot of nudity.  Lots of naked women.  Lots of uninhibited graphic stuff going on.  It's something to see.  It's not exactly the darkest horror movie you'll see, but it has its own distinct horror feel.  I can't quite put my finger on it.

1234917,4,B00000JNCI,"Discovering a sick piece of cinema previously foreign provokes excitement, doesn't it?  This 70s Hell-flick attempts, and fails, to ride the coattails of The Exorcist.  But fret not.  The lead actress is nice to watch, a few scenes are quite memorable (though, perhaps, wasted on this movie), and you'll get more than a few eye-rolling laughs out of, what I hope will become, a newfound classic in your eyes.  DISCLAIMER:  This is one of those reviews that was too fun to write.  As such, I gave away a lot of the plot, twists (if any) and ending--sooooooooooooo SPOILERS.

The opening scene of this Exorcist-rip is in Italy.  This created a great deal of concern in me.  I mean, a lot of great material hails from Italy...it's just that they're all Lucio Fulci movies.  You see, both The Rite (2011) and The Devil Inside (2012) take place in Italy and they were both atrocities.  Thankfully we swiftly cut to New York City--away from CrappyPossessionMovieVille, Italy--and never look back.

Cristina Raines stars as a successful model, Allison Parker, and she is lovely.  [I mean, like, how geeks think Olivia Munn is the work of God lovely.]  We learn that Allison has a troubled past.  (Cue the flashback)  After a traumatic experience involving her father and some overweight hookers she had attempted to kill herself.  Back to the present--er, ""1977 present""--she really wants to get her own apartment even though things seem fine with her boyfriend (Michael; Chris Sarandon of Fright Night old and new), a lawyer who wants to marry her.  They seem quite happy and he is rather untroubled considering this decision.  I suppose her father's frightful infidelity has left her a bit damaged.  Thanks, Mr. Director, for that subtle cue.

Much to her boyfriend's displeasure, she looks into a cheap, furnished, luxurious apartment.  The selling agent suspiciously lures her into signing the lease by lowering the price (from $600 to $400/month) and pretending she never said $400 from the start.  I delighted in the mere idea that a furnished Brooklyn apartment with a view--even in 1977--could be considered expensive at $600 a month, and that one built on the Gateway to Hell is a steal at $400. In this hostile market, one would pay extra for such a feature.  This is one of those moments that makes you go Hmmm.  There will be a lot of those moments where you ask yourself how does she not see that this is strange?  or how does this fit into everything? The building also is home to a way-creepy blind priest (John Carradine of Buried Alive, The Nesting, The Howling) who stares out the window all the time.  Hmmm.  We later discover that the Diocese of NY owns the building.  Hmmm.  And for whatever reason she cannot get phone service in her apartment or even find a phone in her building--you know, to call help when necessary.  Hmmm...totally normal.

Once she moves in, of course, weird things start happening.  First, she starts having feinting spells.  Now I know what you're thinking...this MUST be important, right?  Nah.  But you really put on your sleuthing cap when she starts meeting her neighbors, though.  They're all conspicuously strange.  Burgess Meredith (Rocky) plays her very wacky male-cat-lady equivalent neighbor.  Then there are her leotarded lesbian neighbors, one being the semi-mute, over-sexualized Sandra (Beverly D'Angelo), who awkwardly masturbates in front of her for minutes--MINUTES!!!  Allison gets invited to a cat's birthday party and meets yet more weird people, but the cat's the real star here.

Allison starts having trouble sleeping.  She starts hearing things from the empty apartment above her at the witching hour (3:30am).  She encounters something truly horrifying while investigating these sounds: a cat eating a dead bird!  I don't know if you've ever owned a cat.  But they eat dead birds from time to time.  No biggie.  A total failure to be scary on the part of the director; but unintentionally successful at making me laugh!

Anyway, as this manner of feral barbarism is clearly unacceptable, she meets with the selling agent to complain.  Here Allison learns that she and the blind priest are the only occupants of the building.  Hmmm...WEAK!  So far the backstory has been thorough, somewhat interesting, but business is getting done slower than a constipated sloth with a limp.  Here is where I began to worry about the rest of this movie.  The two of them check the apartments where the cat's little suaree and the scissor sisters were and they're just dusty tombs.

Allison starts seeing more things.  Her visions correspond to a long dead murderess' actions and the phantom tenants of her hallucinations are long dead murderers, too.  Who does Allison see in her next visions but her dead dad and now-zombified whores.  She cuts off his nose and pops his eyeball like a giant zit.  Finally, some entertaining culty gore!  Then she starts ""seeing Latin"" instead of the words in the pages of a book.  The Latin she scribes troubles a suspicious priest, who we later find out doesn't even exist.  Her sleuthing fiance investigates the blind priest, who retired after a church congregation disbanded and the church was torn down.  The priest he questioned seemed quite secretive and worried about it all.  Not sure where this is all leading?  Well, this won't help!  Then, the cops (Eli Wallach and Christopher Walken) think Michael is involved in some old murder cases loosely linked to Allison's visions.  Huh?  Michael keeps investigating and learns that there has been a long series of people attempting suicide, disappearing, and then re-emerging as priests and nuns with all-new aliases, living in THAT APARTMENT BUILDING!!!!

Now, at this point, we have had so many clues, leads and red herrings thrown in our face that this feels no more organized than a monkey crap-fight at the zoo.  I'd like to tell you not to worry; that there will be some form of synthesis...but I can't.  Instead I would like to refer you to the three other movie posters for The Sentinel that I chose not to show you at the beginning of the review.

There, have you read it?  Now you not only know what the plot of the movie is, what the director and writer failed to illustrate through story and character development, and what's going to happen next.  Shall we continue?

So now we see that the plot development is somehow both obvious and disjointed.  It has all been building up to the campy but massively awesome ""opening of the Hellgate"" ending, wherein the director hired actual carnival freaks to portray the demons of Hell--which was so sick and scary when I saw this as an impressionable early-90s-era preteen, and so absolutely not scary here and now in 2012. I mean, they're all just sort of standing there and not posing any real menace.  In today's cinema, they'd be ripping Cristina Raines' skin off.  Anyway, this was the only thing the director did right (i.e., hiring them, not architecting the scene) and it made for a kind homage to the classic chiller Freaks (1932).  However, instead of an uber-creepy mantra from the demons of Hell like ""One of us, one of us..."" we get Michael stupidly declaring ""I am one of the them!"" as he reveals a massive headwound with all the cadence of a teenager telling a ghost story with a flashlight in their face.

The ending is not entirely lost, though.  The final shot of Alison--decrepit, blind, and entombed in a nun's habit--retains some impact.

SIDERBAR:  Some interesting before-they-were-stars casting include Jeff Goldblum as her photographer, Christopher Walken and Eli Wallach as policemen, Tom Berenger as the next guy to move into the ill-fated Hell's Gate apartment, and an uncredited Richard Dreyfuss.",1342051200,4,7717,4.914794732765298
1234928,3,B00000JNCI,"The title says it all, and it is evident from the first frame: the graphics, the exotic old-world location of a supernatural/demonic revelation; the protagonist not a movie actress but a fashion model; the orchestral score including the shocking discordant violins.

1234929,4,B00000JNCI,"When I first read the description of ""The Sentinel"", I knew I had to see it.  I'm a serious movie buff and I love older horror movies.

Cristina Raines portrays Alison, a brunette beauty who works as a fashion model in New York City.  Alison is a somewhat troubled young woman who seeks independence and a place of her own, despite living with her boyfriend.  She finds a gorgeous apartment in an ideal location and it all seems too good to be true.

But soon, she is haunted by painful memories of the past and she is unsettled by her neighbors, some of whom are beyond eccentric...they're downright deranged.  She encounters lewd behavior from two women in particular and another neighbor, an elderly man, constantly drops in uninvited.

I won't ruin the rest for those who haven't seen it, but I recommend that you give ""The Sentinel"" a shot.  It isn't the most terrifying horror movie I've ever seen, but it is definitely worth watching.  There are numerous chilling scenes that will make your skin crawl.  I also enjoy the vibe of movies set in the 70's because they have a certain quality that seems to be missing from films today.

As to the reviewer who said that Cristina Raines is unattractive, I disagree.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and I respect your opinion but personally, I believe she was very pretty.  She has lovely dark hair and big brown eyes.  She was also an excellent choice for that role because she captured the essence of Alison's mental/emotional state.",1336262400,,1491,4.641221374045801

1234931,3,B00000JNCI,"<strong>The Sentinel</strong> (Michael Winner, 1977)

I have, on occasion, gone back and watched beloved films from my childhood and youth to see if they have stood the test of time. It's been a sporadic thing to date, but I decided that this year I want to make a regular thing of it, and browsed Netflix until I found one I hadn't seen in at least twenty years: Michael Winner's <em>The Sentinel</em>. I still have Jeffrey Konvitz' novel on the bookshelf, and I haven't read <em>that</em> in easily thirty years, so some of what I have to say about the comparisons will be... hazy at best. (I will try and make sure the language reflects such when necessary.) But the bottom line is that when I first saw the movie, I had read the book <em>very</em> recently, and I think that may have affected my judgment. Because <em>The Sentinel</em> is a shallow, gratuitous film that is best remembered these days for having such a high-powered cast that Jeff Goldblum, Ron McLarty (in his first screen appearance), Tom Berenger (in his first feature appearance), and Nana Visitor (in HER first feature appearance) didn't manage to rate in either the main titles' A list OR B list, both of which contained over a dozen names. And let's not forget that both Richard Dreyfuss and Vicki Michelle make uncredited cameos. Is there ANYONE in this movie who wasn't on the A list at some point?

Plot: Alison Parker (<em>Nashville</em>'s Cristina Raines) wants some time away from her long-term boyfriend, high-powered attorney Michael Lerman (<em>Fright Night</em>'s Chris Sarandon), so she gets a place on her own. In a Brooklyn Heights brownstone. Fully furnished. For four hundred dollars a month. That was wacko even in the seventies. Still, the estate agent, Miss Logan (the great Ava Gardner in one of her final big-screen appearances), is just as enthusiastic about the place as Alison is, it's got an amazing view, and what more could you possibly want? She takes it, and soon meets most of her crazy neighbors. There's Charles Chazen, who looks and sounds an awful lot like Burgess Meredith. As much as I love Burgess Meredith, he never could play anyone but Burgess Meredith. Then there's the creepy couple downstairs, Gerde (<em>Midnight Cowboy</em>'s Sylvia Miles) and her paramour Sandra (Beverly D'Angelo, best-known these days for the National Lampoon's Vacation franchise). In fact, the only one she hasn't met is the blind priest in 5A, Father Halliran (John Carradine), but then, he's a recluse. Not long after moving in, Alison begins to have fainting spells, problems with her concentration (you wouldn't think that would be a problem for a model, but as one memorable scene with Goldblum and Jerry Orbach points out, it can be absolutely horrifying!), that sort of thing. Michael is understandably concerned, and he enlists Alison's best friend, Jennifer (<em>God Told Me To</em>'s Deborah Raffin), a local expert in dead languages (<em>Psycho</em>'s Martin Balsam), and even the Diocese of New York (represented here by Arthur Kennedy and Jose Ferrer). But that's not all... a couple of cops, Gatz and Rizzo (Eli Wallach and Christopher Walken), are convinced that Michael has something to do with Alison's problems, and that it all ties into Michael's previous wife's suicide, which may not have been a suicide at all...

Phew. Plot synopsis? It's hard to cram all the A-listers in and get the relationships set up in less than five hundred words. And to be fair, there <em>is</em> a plot to this mess, though I can't really tell you what it is since very little of it is revealed until the climax, and every major revelation leading up to it would also be a spoiler. But it all does have a point. Well, most of it has a point. The movie's major problem is that Winner jettisons most of what ties the more prurient scenes (including one featuring Ms. D'Angelo that her fans will want to watch the movie for, and a dream/hallucination sequence that may feature the most explicit gore scenes shown in a theatrically-released American feature film up to that time) to the plot, but leaves them in as shock set-pieces. They're memorable, but since they're not tied to anything, they feel somewhat anemic.

As I said, I haven't read the book (or its sequel, <em>The Guardian</em>, which was even more ludicrous) in dog's years, so maybe I'm misremembering it completely, but if I'm right about my initial reaction to the film all those years ago, my having read the book not long before seeing it allowed me to fit some pieces in place that would have otherwise made little sense had I come into the film cold. You might want to give the book a shot before watching this. ** ",1327449600,,4677,4.8706030150753765

1234935,5,B00000JNCI,"The Sentinel is one of my top 10 favorite horror films of all time.  It has a very simple plot:  woman lives in an apartment that's haunted by past tenants who happen to be murderers, and she's next in line to serve as the Gatekeeper to Hell.  Simple, and it works!  There's also a generous amount of blood and gore, too.  The cast is fantastic:  Chris Sarandon (from Fright Night fame), Beverly D'Angelo (National Lampoon's Vacation...and you see her breasts!), Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldblum, and Burgess Meredith (Penguin from the classic Batman series).

I've actually visited the area in Brooklyn on Montague St. where the apartment complex seen in the movie is located.  It's still there!!  Definitely is an awesome sight after having seen this movie.

Also, towards the end of the movie when Chris Sarandon chokes Father Halloran on the floor, they zoom in on a portrait of St. Rita.  I have that EXACT same portrait hanging in my house!  In fact, I got it at a garage sale a few years ago...Some woman down the block from me was just giving it away.  And I first saw this movie AFTER I got the portrait!  You have no idea how creepy it felt to see that same picture in the movie!  I'm not sure if there are any replicas out there, but to the best of my knowledge, the portrait I have in my possession right now is the SAME one that was used in the movie!!!

I constantly paused that part in the movie just to compare the two portraits, and they're identical. On the bottom of my portrait is a gold plaque with ""Saint Rita"" engraved on it.  It's slightly off-center, so I tried to see if the off-center plaque was also visible on the portrait in the movie.  Unfortunately, the entire bottom of the painting is blacked out, so I couldn't tell if it had the plaque or not!  Very weird...

1234938,3,B00000JNCI,"This movie, ""Old Skool Sentinel"" is worth watching just for Cristina Raines. She's beautiful! Here's the entire story. She moves into an apartment that's really the gateway to Hell. At least it's one of the gateways to Hell. There has to be more than one. There are two very nasty demonic lesbians that are worth mentioning. They are nekkid and let gerbils, rats or something like sit in their laps. Weird!

""The Sentinel"" is a blind Catholic Priest that somehow keeps Hell's inhabitants in this apartment complex. By the way, I've yet to see a movie where a Baptist, Methodist, Church of Christ member or Holy Roller had a job like this. It's like all the crazy demons only target Catholics in horror movies. That either means Catholic is the one true religion that the Devil wants to stop or it's the one every movie character might want to stay away from.

The story is kind of drawn out but during all of that drawn out time the camera is on Cristina Raines and she looks great from every possible camera angle. She really makes this movie.

Some of the monsters, I suppose they were from Hell, look like people with real life physical oddities in the very brief clips they are in. 70s makeup can't hide a guy with a really small head. So this crazy movie has got that going for it. Real freaks!

This is a great movie; lots of famous actors/actresses, acting well to boot. Timeless is a good word; my youngest son also agrees; great movie. I was surprised to learn the ""freaks"" were real freaks! I seem to recognize a few from other offbeat movies.

1234940,4,B00000JNCI,"This is a very fun film about a girl who, for reasons she cannot explain, joins a bizarre group of characters in a very old Brooklyn building.  Though she is taken aback by their habits, including an erotic scene with a stunningly beautiful young Beverly d'Angelo and an eccentric party with Burgess Meredith, she accepts them with a warm amusement.  THere is also a mysterious priest who stares from the top window.  By day, she seems to have everything:  a flourishing career as a supermodel, a loving relationship with a successful lawyer, and friends.

Little by little, though, layers get peeled away to reveal pain and contradiction in her life.  She relives a horrible memory involving her father, which led her to desperate acts as a young girl.  She is also plagued with fears at night, hearing noises and sensing evil and begins to break down.  There is also a cult of upper-level catholic priests that is watching her, apparently acting with the approval of the hierarchy.  Then her boyfriend behaves in strange ways:  on the one hand, he is seeking to help her even at risk to himself, but on the other, there is an unmistakeable malevolent side to him that sparks the interest of a local cop.  In a way, the boyfriend is her most important link to life, though it is clear he cannot be completely trusted.

As her crisis worsens, all of these aspects form a great mystery that intrigues the viewer, or at least those that enjoy this kind of mindgame.  It is like a fast-paced film noir, only supernatural, with a building mood of terror and loss of control.  Right up to the end, I had no idea what was really going on.  Is there a conspiracy?  Are the cultic priests good or bad?  What is the role of her boyfriend?  What does the vision of her father mean?  Who are these strange apartment mates, many of whom are apparently already dead?  In the end, not all of the loose ends are tied off, which is fun but also a bit sloppy, at least in my viewing.

Warmly recommended.  Another very fun aspect of this are the future stars in this, from Jeff Goldberg and Christopher Walken to d'Angelo.  It is an incredible set of actors, which makes the film special.",1299369600,3,2171,4.552971576227391
1234941,3,B00000JNCI,"""The Sentinel"" is a unique film that takes the idea of haunted houses and evil spirits and puts a different spin on the story telling associated with these plots within the horror film genre.  Building up the suspense slowly, and continuing to grow more intense as the film progresses, ""The Sentinel"" uses dark lighting and a well developed story to flesh out the film and provide a decent viewing experience for anyone intrigued by the basic synopsis of the film.  The film ""The Sentinel"" provides a decent amount of scares to keep its viewing audience on its toes.

The film focuses around Alison Parker, an upcoming fashion model who is in dire need of a new place to live.  She finds a local townhouse that has been divided into apartments and has rooms open for rent.  She is greeted by the many inhabitants of the building, including an elderly man and his cat, two lesbian women, and a blind elderly priest who remains secluded within his room on the top floor.

Strange things begin to occur as Alison begins to hear noises in the middle of the night.  She dreams of her past, including witnessing her father having sex with two women, and her eventual attempted suicide.  She begins to have visions of occurrences which are not actually happening in reality and visions of ghosts begin to torture her throughout her day to day life.  Her boyfriend Michael, at first skeptical of Alison's claims, comes to believe her after Alison begins to read a book written in Latin while her boyfriend does not see the contents the same way.

Michael discovers the mystery behind the apparitions within the apartments and must fight against time to save Alison before it is too late.  The apartment complex is actually the gateway to hell, and the elderly priest on the top floor is the only guardian between the forces of evil and the outside world.  With each passing day the spirits grow more violent and begin to affect Alison more and more, eventually leading to her becoming incredibly ill and bordering on death.  Michael takes it upon himself to enter the apartment complex and face the evil within on his own.

The film has a relatively slow pacing, taking a long time to pick up and begin to depict the hauntings that exist within the townhouse.  It is full of twists, leaving the audience guessing as to what is real and what is more than it seems.  The inhabitants, the church, and the priest all have something to hide, and the film continues to keep the audience guessing as to what will happen next.  The later parts of the film contain shocking scenes of violence and disturbing imagery used to depict the spirits of hell as they begin to emerge into this world.  The dark, foreboding atmosphere of the dimly lit apartment complex compliments the overall ambiance of the film, adding to the overall suspense as the film progresses.  ""The Sentinel"" is a film that is slow to start up, but is full of twists, shocking scenes, and an ever present dark environment.  However, the film takes too long to pick up, and the pay off really doesn't feel worth the wait.  Despite the shocking imagery within ""The Sentinel"", the film is never truly ""horrifying"" but it will provide enough thrills to keep the audience entertained and guessing.  Overall, the movie falls short of providing a truly scary experience and plays out more along the lines of a mystery movie than a horror one.",1299110400,,3386,4.6937394247038915
1234942,4,B00000JNCI,"I like the movie, always have since they used to play it on tv back in the 80's with minimal editting, but times change and nudity portrayed on tv isn't allowed, nor it seems strong religious language in movies is allowed to be shown, except now when you get a dvd(thank goodness, but some movies won't be released without being editted for content like Death Wish 2).  I tried to buy this as used and the new universal widescreen edition but got sent the older good times video company full screen version so shame on me for not just buying it new on sale with a larger order to save on shipping, but yeah, its a scarey movie for sure, with lots of nudity, violence, and catholic religious social issues.  Seems this movie is really aimed at catholics, all about sexual promiscuity of her father, suicide attempts just cause she viewed him with two chicks(they didn't say they were hookers, not that I noticed), but hey, her father slapped her around for barging in on his ""fun"" and ripped off her crucifix(which I suppose every catholic knows means yer going to hell like if a guy causes a nun to go straight, I mean straight to bed with him and no longer a nun, or slapping a catholic priest), so I suppose that was enough to drive her to wrist slashing.  But hey, her father goes to hell for it, but frankly the way the movie was going, if she or anyone in her family ever pleasured themselves, they were likely heading to catholic hell anyway.  At least in the end, it seems there were the ghosts or spectors of murderers come up from hell.  I thought it was a little too catholic for all the current and former sentinels to be former suicide attempters, but no adulters, no chronic self pleasurers(ha), or killers, or sinners, etc.
Hopefully watching and enjoying this movie isn't a sin that one could get tagged as a future sentinel for, ha, I mean, I can see the catholic dossiere records on me like in the movie if there ever was one, ""hummm, enjoyed The Sentinel, collects war movies, mocked the actors playing priests in the sentinel, he thought the female actress just needed psychiatric counselling and not a murderous boyfriend and needed a father who obviously should have been even ashamed to even show a hooker his ugly dried out body, seems to be a 43 year old teenager at times, shocking, he's definitely a sentinel candidate"", yup, I'm damned for sure, if I ever become catholic.
Speaking of sentinel candidates, the way the world is going, they are going to need folks to guard exits from hell on almost every street corner, that will be the job of future lawyers, I mean, they are damned to hell anyway and metaphorically blind(blind justice).  Oh well, a few more lines like this and I'll be a blind cross holding priest guarding a gate from hell in no time, haha, so I better stop right here!
Another thing though, I am sure folks notice that our starlet did kill somebody, the private investigator whom she thought was her father, but hey, it was okay, he come to find out had been the contracted killer of her boyfriends' former wife whose death was ruled a suicide though her boyfriend actually had her killed so he could be with her, and oh, ummmm, he happens to be playing a lawyer.",1292716800,4,3211,4.508591065292096
1234943,5,B00000JNCI,"This movie is very, very scary. Although not as gruesome as modern movies, they focused more on imagery and just plain the spookiest set you have ever seen. A woman moves into an old apartment building and finds out it is actually ""the gateway to Hell"". All the inhabitants are not who or what they say they are or even look like. Made in the days of The Excorcist and The Omen, this is one of the 70's movies that pulls no punches in the satanic/witchcraft/occult horror category. Although the special effects certainly are not as good as these days, the shock and scare effect is actually scarier. The scene with Beverly D'Angelo meeting Raine's character is LEGENDARY and you WON'T BELIEVE IT! To this day, it is HIGHLY contraversial and will make you wonder how they got away with it, especially back then. An occult horror all-time classic that people still talk about.

1234944,5,B00000JNCI,"TV model Allison is searching for an apartment in New York finds the perfect apartment at the perfect price. She only has to fill out a personal questionnaire and assure that she is living alone--to please ""the Vanguard."" Some of her neighbors are a tad strange, especially the man across the courtyard, a retired priest who has lived their for years, blind but always staring out the window. What is he looking at? And then there's the strange old man from vaudewille who seems capable of unnatural things, and the lesbian dance duo downstairs. They're so welcoming, even inviting her to a bizarre, surreal party for a cat named Jezebel. Jezebel? I'd be getting out of there myself. But they are so warm and friendly, and Allison needs friends.

She's started having headaches, nothing serious. But they're coming more frequently, along with strange dreams. And when she enquires about her neighbors, she's told that no one lives there except her and the priest. She seems to be losing her mind. And now that she knows they are all figments of her imagination, the hallucinations really begin. She knifes her dead father in the dark empty apartments. She learns that all of her ""neighbors"" are long-dead murderers and other examples of past immoralities. Only one neighbor is real--a reclusive old priest who does nothing but sit at the window, holding a cross, staring at nothing through blind eyes.

Bewildered, she finds herself drawn to the Church, though she is a lapsed Catholic, hoping to find comfort and answers. She has little to hope for; long parted from the church, and two suicide attempts have put her on course to damnation. But the priest promises her that if she comes back to the Church, she will find her purpose in life, but when she returns a few days later, there is no such priest. Little does she know, however, that her act has put the last piece in the puzzle.

The Sentinel doesn't get the same attention as The Exorcist, but it should. The demons are far more interesting, and far more subtle, keeping us guessing (and riveted) until the excellent ending. If you liked The Exorcist, you'll love The Sentinel.",1285286400,,2138,4.788617886178862
1234945,3,B00000JNCI,"With lines like ""This is where the lesbians live,"" ""She went to a party with eight dead murderers"" and exchanges like ""What do you do for a living?"" ""We fondle each other,"" no-one's ever going to mistake Michael Winner's The Sentinel for high art, but it's a good enough yarn with a neat enough twist (that the film's poster and trailer gave away before you even got in the cinema) to pass muster if you're in the mood for a bit of schlock horror. Cristina Raines is the New York model who still hasn't quite got over her adolescent suicide attempt when she discovered her father naked in bed with a couple of hookers (neither would you if you saw Fred Stuthman naked) who moves into a perfect New York apartment only to quickly find the neighbors from Hell are driving her to do the job properly this time. And could that really be her dead dad in the apartment above her? And why did she get an apartment with such a great view so cheap?

A demented smorgasbord of every Satanic hit of the preceding decade (take two parts Rosemary's Baby and mix with one part The Omen and two teaspoons of The Exorcist), as usual for Winner's 70s pictures it boasts a (mostly faded) star-studded cast, this time with more Oscar nominees and winners than you could throw a net over (at least eleven if you include Richard Dreyfuss' curious appearance as an extra in an early street scene). Many of them don't have a lot to do - John Carradine's blind priest barely even moves, a dubbed Jeff Goldblum doesn't do much more than take a few pictures while Jose Ferrer has so little to do it was hardly worth his time turning up - but where else could you see Ava Gardner, Arthur Kennedy, Martin Balsam, Eli Wallach, Christopher Walken, Sylvia Miles, Beverly D'Angelo, William Hickey, Jerry Orbach and Tom Berenger all slumming it in an American version of the kind of demented horror film you'd usually expect to come from Italy, or Burgess Meredith throwing the birthday party from Hell for his cat for that matter? Winner even tops that with the use of deformed extras as the denizens of Hell in the finale, which may well be exploitative, but probably no more so than Erle C. Kenton using them to play humanimals in Island of Lost Souls.

It's well worth tracking down the PAL UK DVD for Winner's audio commentary (which isn't on the US disc): it's a thing of joy and worth the price of the budget disc on its own, whether he's regaling you with the tale of how Universal head honcho Ned Tanen rejected Martin Sheen and insisted on Chris Sarandon for the lead only to wonder who ""that awful Greek waiter"" was playing the lead when he saw the rushes or admitting that he added a scene in Tuscany for a free holiday at the end of the shoot and included lots of party scenes with pretty girls to improve his chances of getting laid. It doesn't exactly follow what's happening on screen, but it's more than outrageously frank and blustering enough for you not to care.",1284940800,2,2949,4.48975791433892

1234960,5,B00000JNCI,"Having heard about this movie on Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments countdown, I felt obliged as a devoted horror fan to check this out. Based on the scenes shown in its time on the countdown, I expected this movie to be great, yet lacking in any real graphic nature.

...but WOW, why I quite wrong! Within the first 20 minutes of the movie, there's a full, on-screen orgy of fully-nude women, bloody self-mutilation and suicide. Remind me, this movie came out a little over 30 years ago? Intensity at it's finest!

So we're off to an extreme and awesome start, and then the movie, interestingly enough, makes a turn into a slower-paced, more gothic route. A model moves into a large apartment building in the city, and as the movie progresses, creepier and creepier things start to happen. This makes for an interesting contrast to the intro, and the gothic elements of the movie are really well-done. Don't worry though, for those seeking more of the glorious graphic nature of the first part of the movie, it picks right back up towards the end! A brutal climax is assured, combining both gruesome imagery and captivating, mysterious atmosphere.

The movie ends on a somewhat unusual note, although for movies of the time it's really not that odd. Although the DVD could have been stronger in the extra features department, the movie itself is great. Overall, ""The Sentinel"" is a highly recommended horror movie for fans seeking a well-done combination of the more graphic side of horror and the more supernatural, atmospheric side. Thanks for the time, and peace.",1256256000,6,1567,4.861423220973783
1234961,4,B00000JNCI,"The 70s gave us many horror classics, notably ""The Exorcist"" and ""The Omen"". Hidden away amongst those gems was 'The Sentinel', by no means a great example of the genre, but creepy nonetheless and boasting a cast of familiar names.

The story focuses on Alison Parker [Christina Raines], a famous model who has been involved with her lawyer boyfriend Michael [Chris Sarandon] and living with him for a while. After her father's death,Alison is revisited by painful memories of her late father, a reprobate and the cause of her first suicide attempt. Alison decides to move out into a her own place, and a sinister real-estate agent leads her to an apartment in a large building that is being leased at an incredibly affordable price. Alison's initial joy at scoring a deal turns sour when she realizes that the building's inhabitants are weird and eccentric, including intrusive neighbor Charles [Burgess Meredith], a pair of lesbian lovers [Sylvia Miles and Beverly D'Angelo], and a sinister blind priest [John Carradine] who lives on the topmost floor, perpetually standing at the window.

Alison soon starts experiencing strange incidents - nightmares that seem all too real, and hearing footsteps where there shouldn't be any. Michael tries to help her by digging into the building's history, uncovering some very strange and shocking truths in the process. Will he be able to save Alison from an unfathomable fate?

The acting is actually quite good with credible turns by Raines, Sarandon [though I much preferred his performance in ""Fright Night""],Meredith and also other stars like Christopher Walken etc. The effects are okay for the time frame it's set in, and there are quite a few gory scenes. Nudity is also featured here in scenes of an orgy, masturbation etc.

All in all, this is an atmospheric horror movie that is watchable and representative of horror movies of its time. Some parts are rather plodding, but the plot itself is intriguing. Fans of supernatural horror might like it, though I'd recommend it as a rental first.",1245024000,2,2043,5.035502958579881
1234962,4,B00000JNCI,"A fun little gem from that good ol' satanic 70s movie craze.  It's not as well known as it's peers, but it should be.
It's about a model, Alison, who rents an apartment and finds she has a bunch of oddball eccentrics as neighbors(including a masturbating Beverly D'Angelo, who'd be welcome at my apartment anytime).  Turns out that these neighbors aren't really neighbors, but specters.  Looks like Alison's sharing the building with only one other tenant-a locked in reclusive priest(John Carradine) on the top floor.  Spooky and ghastly goings on start in Alison's apartment, and it's starting to look like she's out of her tree, but her lawyer boyfriend, Michael(Jerry Dandridge....I mean, Chris Sarandon) doesn't think she's so crazy and starts to dig.  What he finds is a rather interesting plot involving the catholic church.  The final act unleashes some neat looking demons that look like they walked off the set of one of Frank Henenlotter's Basket Case films!  I'm not gonna spill the beans on the whole thing, but it's a neat spin on the many satanic 70s film plots.
This film has familiar faces up the wazoo!  Blink your eyes and you may miss one or two.  Among the many are Jeff Goldblum, Eli Wallach, William Hickey and Jerry Orbach.  It was directed by Michael Winner, who as we all know, made everyone's favorite reverse-mohawk-gang-terrorizes-old-folks-in-an-apartment-and-get-blown-to-smithereens-by-Charles Bronson flick, Death Wish 3!!

1234963,2,B00000JNCI,"Although this movie is laden with well-known stars and is a cult horror movie, I think potential buyers should know what they are getting into. This movie is NOT for children under 18 for any reason. No exceptions.

You may find the content of this movie quite offensive... especially if you are unaccustomed to politically incorrect themes and borderline p0rn where one female of a samesex couple blatantly gratifies herself in front of the new tenant... albeit while wearing leotards... it is still quite graphic and the camera doesn't miss a moment from beginning to end.

You can also expect plenty of full nudity, orgies, lewd behavior, spurting blood, graphic violence, hacking with knives, suicides and graphic slashing of wrists... need I say more? Just the nudity and sexscenes alone should have merited an X rating for this movie.

As for the politically incorrect, this was a 70's movie. It depicts a samesex couple (two females) as being sinners of lewd behavior condemned to he11 and those who attempted suicide as ostracized to the gateway of he11. Some people may find this offensive. Don't expect to see current day standards in a 70's movie.

I can't believe the movie was rated R. Perhaps that is the ""new generation"" ratings... Just be sure you are ready for the content of this movie before you buy it... and please don't let any children watch this movie. Not even teenagers. This movie is clearly too disturbing, shocking and inappropriate for anyone under 21... much less under 18.

I remember watching this movie back in the 70's. I can remember the beginning and the end of the movie but I did not remember anything in between, so when I bought the video, I couldn't believe this was the same movie. I clearly would have remembered the shocking scenes in between if I had seen them. Needless to say, the shocking content took me by surprise and I'm at a loss to explain how I missed it the first time. I must have seen a censored, chopped down family version or fell asleep in the interim.

The storyline is quite different than most other horror stories of the supernatural. A different twist to be sure... but most of the focus is on the bizarre ongoings of the building tenants, lewdness and the dead.

This movie could have been much better if the Director had concentrated on the past ""sins"" of the characters rather making nudity & lewdness the focus.

The writer could have also chosen a different qualifying factor for the gatekeeper other than suicide.

With that said, the movie only merited 2 stars based on the way the movie was handled by the director.

The actors themselves did an excellent job. This must have been an early film for Goldblum. You see him front and center while they are running the beginning credits... but his name isn't mentioned until the end of the movie... 3rd from the bottom of the list of incidental characters. If he was that new and insignificant, then he shouldn't have been front and center while the beginning credits were running.

1234964,3,B00000JNCI,"The script needed obvious improvement, the plot needed development, the acting is good enough in regards to the main character and the freaky neighbors, the story is interesting enough, however, the movie is too slow and at times way too silly until the final scenes that will shock you.  This movie is intended to shock in the way The Exorcist shocked many of its viewers.  There is a scene of cannibalism, lesbianism, and some explicit violence.  There are a few moments that might make you think of David Lynch in regards to the ultra weird characters, however, this movie lacks  skilled and artistic cinematography that you will find in most other classic horror and thriller movies.

The Sentinel does play off as a type of slow paced Hitchcock movie mystery for most of the film, however, towards the end it gets a bit gory and gruesome.  The freaks and evil people at the end are both hideous and shocking.  The movie borrows some of its theme from Rosemary's Baby in that a cult-like group of people indoctrinate an innocent female.

I am not sure what the significance of....many things in this film are.  One would think the fact that she is a model--someone who depends on her physical being for money would have been an interesting counterpoint to the priests and church people--ones who have dedicated their lives to the spiritual but it just seemed like it didn't occur to the filmmakers to do anything interesting with that.  I would have liked the fashion world to have seemed decadent and slightly sick and off kilter, so that the girl seemed pressured from all sides into a life of sin and depravity....

I've ordered the book because it seems like there is some good material there, but it was just not executed very well on film.  But it is certainly still worth a look...just for the seventies clothing and for the thought about what it could have been...
This is one seventies horror story that could benefit from a remake--it wasn't well-executed to begin with so why not try it again?",1195257600,3,1576,4.913207547169812
1234973,4,B00000JNCI,"The Sentinel is one of the penultimate 1970's horror films. It really ranks up there with The Exorcist, the Other and the Omen. But as with those films and other horror films of the 1970's, stylistically they were made differently: character development, mood and plot line build toward the climactic final scenes. This is indicative of most, if not all horror films until the 1980's (think: Psycho, where finally seeing ""Mother"" is the payoff in the last reel). I believe that understanding the differences and styles of telling stories in films is important to appreciating and enjoying them. For many younger viewers accustomed to modern horror films where the frights are played out from the opening through the closing credits, this type of film may seem boring or overly drawn out. But it requires understanding.

Allison Cristina Raines), a successful New York model, seeks some independence from her somewhat intense lawyer boyfriend (Chris Sarandon) and searches for an apartment. She enlists a realtor (Ava Gardner) to help her find just the right one. They search and search, but it is a beautiful brownstone with high ceilings and an incredible view of the river that wins Allison over. Little does Allison realize what she done when she rents the furnished apartment. Full blown horror begins to reveal itself as the film goes from interesting, to unsettling, to creepy and then to downright frightening.

The Sentinel's horror builds rather than slap the viewer in the face with it. For me, it is much more satisfying than most of the modern horror films which rely on shock and gore to deliver their effects.

For example, as Allison looks at the apartment, the realtor (Ava Gardner, stunningly unsettling in her performance) tells her the rent. Allison, stunned by the reasonable price, repeats the rent for verification, only to hear the realtor reduce the price. For me, it always portended the doom that would befall Allison: she's being selected/set up to rent this apartment.

It's small things such as this that create the building sense that Allison has no control over her own fate. Maybe I appreciate this because I grew up on heavy doses of the classic black and white films from Hollywood's golden era...but my appreciation for that is thrown out the window when Allison meets two of her neighbors: two lesbians (one of whom is Beverly D'Angelo in a very early film). Although the scene might play out as erotic to some, for anyone raised with a strong sense of propriety, it will be a very uncomfortable scene that further instills the sense that Allison has gotten more than she bargained for when she rented her apartment.

Some of Hollywood's best have cameo and supporting roles in this who's who film. Burgess Merideth is exceedingly good. His nuanced performance is worth the price of this DVD.

I bought this film from Amazon several years ago and I watch it at least once a year.

Many other reviewers here have provided rather extensive synopsises of the film so I won't add my own to that list, but I wanted to touch on the necessity for understanding this film and appreciating it for its importance in 1970's horror cinema.

Although this DVD edition is lacking any real extras, the film is still excellent. A full DVD treatment is deserved with behind the scenes data and a director's commentary. I eagerly look forward to such a treatment.",1190505600,,3381,4.898601398601398

1234975,5,B00000JNCI,"Peerless Bad Movie maestro Michael Winner, whose oeuvre includes The Nightcomers, Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood, and more Death Wish movies than you can shake a stick at, reached a personal ""best"" with his '77 horror opus The Sentinel. Others also tried (and failed) to cash in on the success of The Exorcist, but no one else created more unintentional laughs while doing so than writer-director Winner.

The fun begins when supermodel Cristina Raines finds a beautifully furnished, large apartment in New York for only $400 a month. This establishes that we are deep inside the fantasy genre, but the movie turns genuinely horrifying with the appearance of Sylvia Miles and Beverly D'Angelo--both decked out in leotards, heels and ghastly perms--as two of Raines's new neighbors. In a very poor Cruella De Vil accent, Miles announces, ""We don't get many visitors."" Why not? Well, maybe it's because Miles begins groping D'Angelo's thighs in front of Raines, whereupon D'Angelo lustily strokes herself. There's actually a closeup of fingers busily rubbing away, then a shot of D'Angelo lifting her fingers to her nose, inhaling deeply. Raines can only ask this mad non sequitur, ""What do you do for a living?"" before bolting away. Miles snaps, ""Going so soon? It's rather rude to eat and run!""

Raines develops terrible headaches (wouldn't you, if you were a talent-free actress trapped in a movie this awful?) and, dopey from pain pills, allows herself to be wooed by neighbor Burgess Meredith (even more fey than usual--was Roddy McDowall unavailable?) into attending a birthday party for his cat, where, yes, Miles and D'Angelo dance a polka. Scary, sure, but not as unsettling as the nightmare Raines has afterwards, in which Miles and D'Angelo--both in the nude--rip off her clothes.

Understandably, Raines complains about these tenants, only to be told by real estate rep Ava Gardner that no one but Raines lives in the building, ""aside from the priest."" That's right, neighbors Miles, D'Angelo, Meredith and the cat are all dead, and a reclusive blind priest, John Carradine, lives on the top floor because (uh-oh!) the Catholic church owns the whole building. Does Raines, a lapsed Catholic, move out? Hey, what are a few hammy ghosts and a sightless priest when the rent is this cheap? But then, one night Raines awakens to find the specter of her own dead father terrorizing her! Confessing to priest Arthur Kennedy, Raines sums up the spiritual crisis an unwise rental has brought about: ""I've rejected Christ. I've committed adultery. I've tried to take my life, twice. I saw my father. I stabbed him, but he was already dead!""

What does it all mean? Trying to answer that query, Raines's beau, Chris Sarandon, breaks into church headquarters and finds files outlining a sinister program: the church is taking people who've attempted suicide and turning them against their will into unseeing priests and nuns doomed to keep evil spirits from wandering the haunted halls of cheap apartment buildings. And not only is Raines on the list, she's scheduled to give up modeling and replace Carradine as her building's newest blind cleric. Rushing to Raines's address, Sarandon uncovers a sign in the lobby that probably belonged on the front page of this film's script: ""Abandon hope, all ye who enter here."" Carradine--whose time is up as the sentinel guarding ""the world against evil""--helpfully explains that the building is ""the entrance to Hell."" Will Raines agree to replace him? It's that age-old dilemma: Should I be a sentinel or a supermodel? If this film had been made recently, Raines would obviously stay a supermodel and host an MTV show, but The Sentinel was made back in a simpler time, when supermodels knew that becoming a blind sentinel nun was a good career move.

So, who gets Raines's fab flat? At the end, Gardner rents it to someone destined to later move into the trendy Sliver, Tom Berenger.",1185667200,3,3936,5.003053435114504

Released to DVD twice: the low-priced GoodTimes copy of ""The Sentinel"" obviously came from a print, with some muddy-dark action looking even worse in the full-screen format, however the sound quality is excellent. The Universal widescreen distressingly has a much deeper tone in the sound mixing--not affecting the music score, just the octave of the speaking actors--giving the viewer the incorrect impression that star Cristina Raines has a deep, flat voice. Other actors in the cast, particularly Chris Sarandon and Sylvia Miles, also sound as though they have nose colds.

1234990,4,B00000JNCI,"PLOT: The film first begins at a monastery in Northern Italy. A group of priests are pledging allegiance to God and swearing that they will let no evil being exit the entrance to Hell. Suddenly the film jumps to New York City and focuses on Alison Parker (Cristine Raines), a fashion model, and her boyfriend Michael Lerman (Chris Sarandon), an attorney. The two have been together for two years and they live together, but Alison suddenly feels the need for some personal space so she starts looking for her own apartment. One day Alison receives a call saying that her father has died from cancer. After the funeral, Alison has a flashback from when she was a young teenager. She came home from school one day to find her father in bed with two other women. He slapped her and threatened to kill her if she told anyone. She then went into the bathroom and slit her wrists. Obviosuly, her life was saved. This flashback showed just why Alison didn't have the greatest relationship with her father. Eventually Alison sees an ad for an apartment in a brownstone building. The rent is great and the location is nice, so Alison decides to take it. When outside, she sees a man sitting by the top floor window just staring into space. Alison asks Ms. Logan (Ava Gardner), the realator, who the man is. Ms. Logan says that he is Father Francis Matthew Halloran (John Carradine), a blind priest. ""If he is blind, then what is he looking at,"" Alison wonders. After moving in, Alison begins to meet the other tenants such as Charles Chazen (Burgess Meredith), two ballerina lesbian lovers (Sylvia Miles and Beverly D'Angelo), and a few others. Her neighbors seem really weird and she also hears strange noises from the apartment above at night. She meets with Ms. Logan and complains about the other tenants and the noises at night. Ms. Logan informs Alison that besides the priest and herself, no one else has lived in the building for 3 years. What in God's name is wrong with the apartment building?

COMMENTS: This is a really creepy religious style horror film. I would describe this as The Exorcist (1973) meets The Omen (1976) meets The Da Vinci Code (2006). It is a mystery as well as a horror film, one that keeps you guessing right until the very end. Most people haven't even heard of this film, but it features an all-star cast and is loaded with cameos from famous stars before they were famous stars. Jeff Goldblum, Chritsopher Walken, and Beverly D'Angelo are featured here in one of their first film roles. The film is based on a novel by Jeffrey Konvitz and was directed by Michael Winner (Death Wish (1974)). Upon release, the film became highly controversial due to Winner's decision to use actual disfigured people to portray the demons during the climax. The superb makeup job was done by Dick Miller, who also did the makeup for The Godfather (1972), The Exorcist (1973), and Amadeus (1984). He seems to have a special gift for aging makeup, and he did a fine job on actor John Carradine (who looks like a zombie with that wrinkled skin and those creepy, white contact lenses.) If you're interested in the films I mentioned above, as well as mysteries, then you might want to check this film out. This DVD presents the film in the original widescreen theatrical ratio. As for extras, it only contains the original theatrical trailer.",1162684800,4,3347,4.692176870748299
1234991,4,B00000JNCI,"This film is a semi-classic that emerged from the late 70s period of horror that dealt primarily with religious/ecclesiastical themes (such as Rosemary's Baby, The Omen, the Exorcist, etc), and while the Sentinel has failed to rise to the same prominence as some of its contemporaries, it's a very well made supernatural chiller that packs a punch in the creepiness/freakiness department.

The plot concerns a young model with a troubled past (played by the attractive but slightly wooden Cristina Raines) who moves into an ominous New York city apartment inhabited by an assortment of eccentric and oddly unsettling characters, including an effete old man (played impeccable by the great Burgess Meredith), a very demonstrative lesbian couple, and a blind priest who always sits vacantly in front of his window. As the film progresses, the young woman's encounters with her neighbors progress from merely strange to truly horrifying, until she eventually learns the apartment's dark secret, which holds within it her own terrible fate. The movie's climax is one of the most memorable in film history, and borrows from Tod Browning classic ""Freaks"".

The Overall atmosphere of the movie is one of building dread, which flows seamlessly from the fine performances of the cast as well as a number of flashbacks and dream sequences that are very eerie. In fact, it's difficult to articulate exactly what it is about the sentinel that leaves the viewer so unsettled, but the film manages to achieve a kind of dreamy horror that's truly disturbing.

The Sentinel also features some of the earliest performances of now famous actors such as Jeff Goldblum, Chris Sarandon, and Beverly D'Angelo.

While it suffers slightly from a jarring soundtrack and at times looks and sound a little dated, The Sentinel remains a wonderfully unsettling chiller that deserves to be discovered by a new generation.",1156982400,6,1891,5.19016393442623

There seemed to be a trend developing dealing with apartment buildings and its weird tenants, The Sentinel certainly has it share of that. Some of it may not make alot of sense, but that's the great thing... a surreal creepiness that you recognize instantly with things not being right. We would go on to see familiar themes being presented in movies such as ""Rosemary's Baby"", ""The Tenant"", and a more recent ""The 4th floor"". With some similarities as well to ""Burnt Offerings"". All in all its a classic 70's horror presentation that leans more on the nightmarish than ghosts, satanism or slasher films.

1235000,4,B00000JNCI,"Oh man, every time I watch THE SENTINEL it gives me the creeps. Just imagine you are a beautiful model and you have it made, you get to move into a spacious and very lavish apartment. You make some new friends with neighbors...who don't even exist! They are all souls from the gateway to hell. And a blind priest (reminds me of the mystic Emily in THE BEYOND) is the guardian of this gateway. Cristina Raines portrays her character Alison with such gusto, and Chris Sarandon is pleasant, but then really creepy after he becomes 'sentinel-ized' and torments Alison. There are impressive cameos from Jeff Goldbulm, Christopher Walken, and the late Jerry Orbach. While the movie has aged some and not everyone's acting is 100%, it remains one of the scariest flicks.

THE SENTINEL centers on the aforementioned Alison, who is moving into a new brownstone apartment that is a portal to hell, and with the strange events occuring within (seeing scary people with totally white eyes, creepy nude women), Alison starts to question her sanity, and also the neighbors don't make matters any better, especially the two women who make things a bit TOO comfortable for Alison (Beverly D'Angelo's 'self-lovin' sequence is more disturbing than anything). Sarandon's character, Michael, wants to protect her, but he has no idea, and neither does Alison, that she's been chosen as the new gatekeeper. When she tells the landlady about the people in the building, the furnishings...and the people all vanish. Are those people really alive? You'll have to find out for yourself. The climax of the movie is somewhat satisfying, but you'll have to decide for yourself. There are some very creepy moments in the movie, especially the scene where she's in the bedroom and 'the sentinel'-ized man (could be her dad) walks to the door and she puts on the flashlight and BAM! She screams in sheer terror at the sight of the scary man with totally white eyes. The atmosphere of the movie is chilling; the suspenseful scenes are quite good; and the actors mostly play their parts quite well for a horror movie. Cristina Raines, though, really owns the movie in her role, making us feel her pain, her frustration, her fear, and ultimately, her fate. I wasn't pleased with poor Alison's fate, but it ends the movie on a strong note.

THE SENTINEL still remains one of the scariest and creepiest imaginings to this day. While not the most perfect scare flick of all time, it's definitely worth watching if you're a fan of the creeps. One watch and you might start to wonder if the next apartment you rent is the gateway to hell.",1129852800,8,2598,4.809843400447427

SHe has a great boyfriend, who she has every intention of marrying, but would like to prove to herself that she can live on her own, independently, before taking that step.  So, after months of searching, she finds what she sees as the perfect apartment.  It's furnished, has a great view and is in her price range.  SHe takes it!

Things are going great in her new home.  She meets a friendly neighbor, an elderly man, whose only companions are his cat and bird.  The place is quiet.  In fact, she rarely hears a peep out of the other tenants.  The priest upstairs is very old and not very responsive to anything.  In fact, he simply gazes out his front window everyday and stares at the world, even though he is blind.

The place seems perfect for Allison.  Until she decides to stop into one of her neighbors units and introduce herself.  They are two women in their mid-thirties(one of them played by Beverly D'Angelo) and they are a little different.  In fact, they begin fondling themselves right in front of Allison.  This creeps Allison out a little, so she leaves.  Nothing too terrible and certainly no reason to leave the apartment.

Later that night, Allison hears heavy footsteps from the apartment above hers.  SHe also hears a lound banging noise and this makes for a difficult night sleeping.  The next morning she visits the landlord in the city and asks who lives up there.  The landlord finds this funny and tells Allison that there is only one other tenant; the preist upstairs!!!

So, now we are taken on a wild ride as Allison tries to figure out who these other tenants are, who the priest is and exactly what is going on with her health, which has been worsening as the film develops.  This is ""The Sentinel"".

This film is fairly tense and has a great plot.  The cast does a wonderful job with the acting and make their roles very believable.  I did knock off 2 stars for the pace of the film, which is really, really slow.  And, for the dialogue.  I realize this was made in the 70's, but I stil have a hard time believing that New York strangers interacted so politly with each other at all times, especially when someone just walks into their apartment as Allison did to the odd female couple.  All in all, this is a very watchable film, with a good ending.  It is more of the religious-type horror(think ""The Seventh Sign"" or ""The Omen"" or for you more modern folks, ""The Order"") and I am not particularly a fan of that genre, but this film is still enjoyable.

Sure the film is clearly a product of the 70's and it's obviously dated in certain aspects; the soundtrack, the camera work and the fashion, made even more evident by the fact that the protagonist is a fashion model.  Yes, there are lapses in editing and some unanswered questions (one being how Alison got from the party in Manhattan to the brownstone in Brooklyn so quickly and easily and all in a matter of minutes).  In reality, who really cares?  The pros so outweigh the cons here.  An occasional weak script and some tepid acting from a few of the minor cast members doesn't take away from the fact that this is a terrific horror movie with some really clever ideas and an underlying sense of disquieting terror.  Something in the film pulses with unease and vulnerability and you feel that you are very exposed and, therefore, likely to be frightened.  Check it out for yourself.  Don't expect the modern take on horror because it's not evident here.  This film relies more on atmosphere, tension and isolation to create it's sense of dread and doesn't crush the film under the unbearable weight of in your face tactics, special effects and other general wizardry so sickeningly prevalent in today's horror flicks.",1115856000,9,1490,4.811764705882353
1235003,4,B00000JNCI,"The Sentinel (1977) is about a pretty model who moves into a furnished apartment in New York City.  From the moment she moves in, Alison (Cristina Raines) meets strange neighbors and has fainting spells on her photo shoots.  Her handsome lawyer boyfriend Michael (Chris Sarandon)is trying to help her, but what skeletons does he have in his closet?  Police detectives are hot on his trail as they investigate both his girlfriend's predicament and the suicide of his wife two years ago.

The movie moves at a slow but steady pace, building mood.  I watched this with the blinds open. I could not handle this movie in the dark or at night.  The Sentinel is definitely not something you would watch with your mother or even brother.  There are scenes of  attempted suicide, female masturbation, lots of blood and gore, and a disgusting scene of debauchery involving Alison's elderly father and two prostitutes.

What a cast - Jeff Goldblum, Burgess Meredith as one of the weird neighbors, Ava Gardner as the landlord/real estage agent who rents the apartment to Alison, Christopher Walken, and David Carradine as the blind priest.  It is amazing to see Ava Gardner, screen siren of the 1940's back in action, showing she's still got it!

Everyone except a blind priest who stares out of a window on the top floor.  But when things go bump in the night and she complains, she finds out that she and the priest are the only residents.  She must have imagined anyone else.

More strange things begin to happen and her fianc gets involved in trying to figure out what is going on.  While no one seems to know what is going on (other than church officials wearing a special ring), most are convinced that there is something going on.  Eventually we learn how the model ties into the events, the importance of her building, and what the priest is doing.

1235005,4,B00000JNCI,"In the 1970's there was a sort of ""satanic renaissance"" in film: ""The Omen"", ""The Exorcist"", ""Rosemary's Baby"", and last and probably least, ""The Sentinel"".

While this is not what I'd call a great horror film, there are genuinely chilling, demented moments: Burgess Meredith is particularly eerie as an old ""birdman"" who lives in the doomed tenement complex the unfortunate Cristina Raines, a budding supermodel and soon to be basket case, takes up residence in.

You can tell right from the outset of the film that something is terribly wrong with her new living quarters--the other inhabitants are strange old cookies (watch for the two old lesbians) who seem a little over eager to have Raines in their odd little community.  John Carradine is the key to the film: he lives on the top floor, supposedly simply a blind old recluse.  He is much more.

The film lacks the subtlety of ""Rosemary's Baby"", but does possess the mood of enroaching doom.  The ending is not exactly happy, but there are some unforgettable scenes in which the ""tenants"" reveal who they really are, and Raines' husband meets a grisly end.

1235006,4,B00000JNCI,"Super-model Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) wants an apartment of her own, so she has a place to go if things don't work out with her boyfriend, Michael (Chris Sarandon). Alison was traumatized a few years earlier when she walked in on her creepy father during one of his extra-marital ""parties"". It was NOT a pretty sight! She had attempted suicide over the ordeal. Her mother stayed with dad because she had nowhere else to go. After dad's death, odd things begin happening to Alison. She passes out at a photo-shoot. Back at her apartment building, she begins meeting other tenants who are more than a bit odd. Among them are Burgess Merideth as an old guy with way too much enthusiasm, and Sylvia Miles and Beverly D'Angelo as a couple of gals who can't keep their hands off each other. D'Angelo makes Alison extremely uncomfortable by being rather... um, er, naughty in front of her. Alison also learns about the priest (John Carradine) who lives on the top floor. He's blind, but spends his entire life ""looking"" out the window! When Alison complains about her weird neighbors, the realtor (Ava Gardner) tells her that no one else lives in the building except for Alison and the priest! Later, Alison passes out while filming a commercial and never fully recovers. She is in a daze. Michael tries to get to the bottom of things and finds out a very bizarre secret. A secret that will cost lives and alter destinies! THE SENTINEL is a good spooker with many interesting characters. It also has tons of stars, both old and new including Martin Balsam (Psycho, Cape Fear), Jose Ferrer, Arthur Kennedy, Eli Wallach (The Good The Bad And The Ugly), a very young Jerry Orbach (tv's Law And Order), Christopher Walken (Batman Returns, Sleepy Hollow), Jeff Goldblum (The Fly, Jurrassic Park), and others! The finale alone is worth the price of the DVD! If you like zombies, ghosts, demons, occult, good vs. evil, and a deep sense of paranoia and fear, then THE SENTINEL is just what the mad doctor ordered! ...",1097539200,33,2008,4.74
1235017,4,B00000JNCI,"It amazes me that this movie was made when it was. Viewing it again recently creeped me out much more than it did on my first viewing years ago.  Back then, I had read and really liked the book, when I saw the film, i wasn't as impressed.  Now after viewing it again, it scares me more. Some of the things here that I did not apprecaite before, practically jumped off of the screen and slapped me in the face.  On the surface, it is very much that typical gates of hell meets Burnt Offerings kind of story - but really it is in some respects a complete freak show, in-you-face attempt to make you squirm.  Have we become so conservative that this older film seems more potent now than then?

I put the DVD in - vaguely remembering most of it and as the credits roll I see: Chris Sarandon, Burgess Meredith, Ava Gardner, Beverly D'Angelo, Sylvia Miles, John Carradine, Eli Wallach, Jeff Goldblum, Christopher Walken ... wow! Once the story takes off, were treated to naked freaks from hell, a horrific menage scene, acid-trip looking birthday parties for cats, and Beverly D'angelo masturbating silently on her couch in front of company!  Of course they're all disciples of Hell pursuing poor Christina Raines - but man do they creep you out.

1235021,4,B00000JNCI,"""The Sentinel"" is a grand 1970's horror film staffed with a cast rivaling the pictures made by Robert Altman or Irwin Allen. I can't remember the last time I saw a film with so many recognizable faces--Christopher Walken, Chris Sarandon, Beverly D'Angelo, Burgess Meredith, John Carradine, Jerry Orbach, Jeff Goldblum, Ava Gardner, Martin Balsam, Jose Ferrar, Eli Wallach, Arthur Kennedy, and Tom Berenger all pop up in roles both major and minor throughout the film. ""The Sentinel"" obviously takes films like ""The Omen,"" ""Rosemary's Baby,"" and ""The Exorcist"" as its role models, and it holds up surprisingly well in comparison. When I stumbled over this film a few months ago, I was quite astounded I had never heard of it before considering I am such a fan of 1970's horror films dealing with satanic influences. Michael Winner, the director who presented us with such classic cinema as ""Scorpio,"" ""Death Wish,"" and ""The Mechanic,"" gives us his all in this chilling story about a gateway to Hell and the poor souls entrusted to protect the rest of us from the evil spirits dwelling there. The movie is an adaptation of a book written by Jeffrey Konvitz.
A model named Alison Parker and her successful lawyer boyfriend Michael Lerman (Christina Raines and Chris Sarandon respectively) begin their descent into madness when Parker rents a room in a creepy old apartment building from mysterious real estate agent Miss Logan (Ava Gardner). The model soon discovers her new dwellings possess a decidedly sinister atmosphere--a blind priest sits and stares out of the window of the top floor apartment, an elderly creep spouting cryptic comments (Burgess Meredith) keeps dropping by, and a couple of females in an extremely close relationship live in a neighboring apartment. Within a few days of moving in, Parker begins to hear strange noises, starts having vivid memories of a suicide attempt she made as a child, sleepwalks, and discovers a few hideous secrets about the other tenants in the building. By the time Alison starts having fainting fits during fashion shoots, her boyfriend Michael steps in and starts investigating the strange apartment building. Lerman's nosing around brings in a couple of detectives (Wallach and Walken) who remember well how Michael's first wife died under mysterious circumstances. When bodies start turning up, ""The Sentinel"" becomes a race to discover what evil lurks in the apartment building before the cops pin the weirdness on Lerman.
Winner's film evokes shudders on numerous levels. You'll gasp in surprise several times during the film, from the eventual revelations about the strange residents to what Beverly D'Angelo's character does when Alison Parker pays a visit (I had to replay that scene a couple of times just to convince myself that I did really see that. Purely from an academic aspect, of course. Honest.). I've seen several films where Burgess Meredith works hard at being weird--""Burnt Offerings"" is an excellent example--but I don't remember him ever attaining the level of bizarre he does here. He's downright disturbing as the elderly neighbor who drops in on Raines's character from time to time. The conclusion of the film definitely constitutes one of the more disturbing endings I have seen in a horror film, and it does so with a lot less gore than you would expect. I thought the plot of ""The Sentinel"" was a good one, a plot both frighteningly offbeat and effectively eerie.
I had a lot of fun watching for famous faces. Most of the actors who appeared in the film weren't that well known yet, and they look younger than you could ever imagine. Jeff Goldblum plays a pushy fashion photographer, Beverly D'Angelo turns up as a lesbian with a penchant for showmanship, and Christopher Walken plays a cop. Walken especially is humorous to watch. He only has about two lines in the entire film yet still manages to exude his now famous sense of weirdness. Chris Sarandon has since become a better known actor through such roles as the vampire in ""Fright Night,"" and Jerry Orbach made a name for himself as a character actor in films (""Brewster's Millions"") and as one of the cops in the television show ""Law and Order."" The only real mystery here is Christina Raines as Alison Parker. Here's an actress in the lead role in a film loaded with young and old talent alike, and she barely makes a splash. In fact, she hasn't made a movie or television show since the late 1980s. What happened? Personally, I didn't care for her character in the movie or how she played the part. Even worse, considering she's supposed to be playing a big buck fashion model, she isn't very attractive. You will have a better time watching the interesting mix of actors and actresses instead of focusing on Raines's histrionic performance.
""The Sentinel"" doesn't provide much in the way of extras outside of a trailer and some production notes. Even the picture transfer isn't all that good, unfortunately. You would figure a movie loaded with so many once was and would be stars would get a better treatment. Oh well, give the movie a shot if you love horror. Creepy, grotesque, and shocking--""The Sentinel"" managed to surprise me, a jaded horror aficionado, more than a few times. Let's hope they rerelease the movie on a DVD with a better picture transfer, more extras, and perhaps a commentary from the likes of Sarandon.",1079222400,144,5369,4.946843853820598

1235024,5,B00000JNCI,"This is a very scary flick, based on the equally creepy book by the same name.  In fact, the movie is very faithful to the novel, which was considered fairly shocking for its time frame.  This isn't a perfect movie, being choppily made and a bit amateurish in its direction and production, but as far as horror films go, it's very gruesome and creepy.
The cast list features both old and new stars and all of them did a great job.  Faded movie queen Ava Gardner is elegant and believable as the realtor who seems clue-free about the horrors contained in her rental property.  Jose Ferrer plays the head of a secret brotherhood of priests who select the Sentinel---the poor person who sits at the gates of hell and blocks evil from erupting into the normal world.  Eli Wallach is the cynical but willing to be convinced cop who's trying to unravel the bizarre puzzle he's been handed.  The great John Carradine---tall, gaunt, with his cavernous voice and arthritis-twisted hands---plays the old priest who is the dying sentinel that must be replaced.  Finally, the devil is played to charming and evil perfection by Burgess Meredith.
The newer bunch of faces are good, too.  Christina Raines is vulnerable and touching as the girl under spiritual attack from both sides, a pawn in the never-ending battle between good and evil.  Chris Sarandon is effective as her caring but ultimately self-centered boyfriend, caught in the grip of unbelief while forced to confront the spiritual reality of the situation he's encountered.  There's a group of future stars hidden in the rest of the cast:  Jerry Orbach as a jerky TV director; Deborah Raffin, Beverly D'Angelo and Jeff Goldblum as friends of the victimized girl; and Christopher Walken as the junior partner of the veteran cop.  Everyone does a great job in pulling off his role and helps carry the story forward.
The special effects are pretty gory for the times and still have the capacity to gross out some viewers.  There are some fairly nasty nude scenes, too, especially involving the girl's father and his two ugly whores.  The atmosphere of this film is more suspenseful than terrifying, but the psychological drama of a normal person facing unspeakable evil is very well portrayed.  The girl is helpless, especially at the end, when confronted by the devil and his minions.  Whoever thought to find sideshow freaks to play the fiends around satan was a genius; the effect is very powerful and repulsive.  Overall, this is not a modern horror flick with tons of mayhem.  It's a more sedate but also more terrifying dip into the realm of evil.  Very creepy!",1031443200,81,2613,4.831460674157303
1235025,4,B00000JNCI,"Death Wish series director Michael Winner applied his standard blunt edged approach to sex and violence with this sub-standard adaptation of Jeffrey Konvitz's well crafted novel.  While the movie has a rich, glossy look and a cast to die for (check out the old and future star power, just about every cast member is a now recognizable face) and has a final reel that will have your skin crawling off your body, it muddles far too many of the plot details of Konvitz's textured story and unfolds unevenly.  It gets four stars for the cast and creep factor alone (and Winner's Tod Browningesque chutzpah in using extras with actual deformities as the tortured souls of hell), but this is nothing more than a cult movie, not a classic.  Trivia bonus: make-up effects artist Dick Smith (The Exorcist, The Godfather, and an Oscar winner for Amadeous) was so unsettled by the violent make-ups he created for this movie that he refused to do anymore for some time afterward.

It has an incredible cast of actors and actresses of the era. Jeff Goldblum as the photographer, this is one of his early roles and also starred in another '70s horror movie, ""The Invasion of the Body Snatchers"".
Cris Sarandon would later portray the vampire in 1985's ""Fright Night"".
Burgess Meredith, one of the lead actors here would also play a devious character in ""Burnt Offerings"" with Karen Black, Bette Davis, Oliver Reed.
Cristina Raines and her boyfriend Cris Sarandon live together, but as an aspiring model, she wants her own apartment in NY. She finds one, fully furnished. She moves in and seemingly befriends other tenants in the building. However, to her astonishment after meeting the apartment's landlord, she is told there is no one else that lives in the building besides her and an older priest on the 5th floor.
She keeps having her sleep interrupted by strange noises and clanging going on in the apartment above her. Soon, she gets her boyfriend lawyer involved, Cris Sarandon, and well, all ""hell"" breaks loose.

** Great movie and if you can find it at a good price, worth it !!
