7928016,2,B00004Z4TM,"One of those farces where characters are constantly running from room to room barking out hyper-emotional dialogue.  Scorsese introduces it praising it's vibrant use of colors and layered shot composition.  Unfortunately, that's all there is.  Three powerful men fall in love with a feisty actress, who only loves her career.  It feels at least an hour longer than it really is.",1346198400,,378,5.147540983606557
7928017,5,B00004Z4TM,"The Golden coach is a lovely movie about a Comedia del Arte troupe of actors who have travelled to South America.  On the same ship with them was a golden coach, ordered by the governor of the town.  Their Columbine adores the coach, as does everyone who sees it.  All of the wealthiest people of the town try to insist that the governor should give them the coach.  It becomes a huge status issue.  At the same time, three different men court Columbine.  One an idealistic young soldier, one a confident bull fighter, and one the aristocratic governor.  At the climax of the story, Columbine has to make a choice and resolve the issue of the golden coach as well.
The imagery is stunning.  Renoir plays beautifully with the conventions of Comedia del Arte while using the film medium to its fullest.  The music is Vivaldi, and absolutely gorgeous.  Magnani gives a warm and wonderful performance, as does the Governor.  I especially recommend this film to anyone who loves theatre and has ever been forced to make a tough choice involving their art.",974505600,9,1050,4.683060109289618
