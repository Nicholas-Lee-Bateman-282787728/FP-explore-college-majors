8660467,2,B00KOW4AZU,It is hard to follow the story of this movie. I bought this to give me some background regarding the Vatican banking corruption. It seems like all I see is that some Vatican bishops are in cahoots with the Mafia. They portrayed Bishop Marcinkus as the main bad guy in the Vatican but I did not really see why. I really cannot recommend this video.,1427673600,,347,4.3538461538461535
