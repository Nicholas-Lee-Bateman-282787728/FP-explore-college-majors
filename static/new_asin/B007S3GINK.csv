5109703,5,B007S3GINK,"i have all 5 seasons and can't wait for the remainder seasons.  it's also addicting!! basically, real life stories where women become killers or hire someone to kill someone for them.  so, a great handbook on not to murder someone LOL! [just kidding] cuz in the end, most of these women are serving lengthy sentences and will be forever be a convicted felon.  but if you love the series, the dvd collection is great to have!! i just wish oxygen would hurry up with the remainder seasons.",1356825600,3,487,4.574712643678161
