4595347,3,B0057GUGGU,"I am not sure why, but this movie just didn't work for me. Extremely well cast. Not sure where this movie stumbled. My daughter did not care for the young actor that played T.J. and thought the movie focused too much on him. It did not seem to flow smoothly and was a bit choppy in the editing.",1316044800,2,294,4.086206896551724
4595348,4,B0057GUGGU,"TJ lost his mother and with a distant father popping pills he hasn't gotten over his grief.

He meets Hesher who turns his life, his family life and his emotional state upside down and inside out. I was mesmerized by Levitt's performance and truly believed Hesher did exsist through Levitt's portrayal.

I highly recommend and will be watching this again!",1315958400,,355,4.9
4595349,3,B0057GUGGU,"HESHER tells a tale that we've seen before: outcast boy (Devin Brochu) copes with a pill-popping father (Rainn Wilson) and a well-meaning but misunderstood grandmother (Piper Laurie).  He gets picked on by a bully, meets a beautiful outcast girl (Natalie Portman), and befriends a nihilistic loner (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).  Heartwarming chaos ensues.

It took three people to write HESHER, which is a little disturbing, considering the film doesn't have much original to offer.  It's nice to see a film revolving around such a violent character, but the violence is grossly understated and rarely prominent (except for Gordon-Levitt's riveting first scene).  Hesher's potential violence pretty much remains potential, and the inevitable heartwarming end (yes, you knew it was coming, you know it from the second or third scene) undermines any promise the film truly had.

Then why three stars?  Because of the performances.  Gordon-Levitt is reliable as always; in his best scenes, he sinks his teeth into Hesher and lets 'er rip.  Brochu does the brooding child thing well, with a delightful hint of menace and vulnerability thrown in for good measure.  Wilson is superb as the father, and Portmant is a little too sexy for her role (we're supposed to believe no one cares about a girl who looks like that?  Really?) but, as always, she makes the best of what she's given.  More kudos go to the always-great Piper Laurie, and John Carroll Lynch (grossly under-used, as always).

Ultimately, HESHER is a bit of a let-down.  It doesn't know what it wants to be: bada** flick about conflicted relationships and coping with loss, or feel-good drama with a little dirt rubbed in.  Ultimately, the dirt doesn't break the surface, and HESHER remains little more than a promise unfulfilled.  But see it for the performances, especially the scene between Laurie and Gordon-Levitt--two of the best actors of their respective generations, sharing an intimate moment and playing their talents off one another.  It doesn't get more entertaining than that; too bad the rest of the film doesn't equal that level of greatness (though, in a few keys moments, it comes pretty close).",1315872000,10,2165,5.14
4595350,5,B0057GUGGU,"The best indie film I have seen all year.  It had it all, from touching to hysteerical this one had it.  Joesph Gordon-Levitt owned this one.  Definately worth buying!",1315699200,,167,4.689655172413793
4595351,5,B0057GUGGU,"This is quite possibly the greatest indie-type film to-date. I know that's a bold statement and I obviously haven't seen every film (though I've seen a lot). I'll explain.

But first, a couple warnings: if you're just looking for a movie with a shallow plot and stunning visual effects, or you're just hoping to see more of Natalie Portman's skin, then I won't waste your time. (Although it does have an explosion or two and and some intense action/suspense scenes; see the trailer...)
Also, The language in the movie is really rough, so if that's a problem for you, be careful, I guess.

In spite of the language issue... I must say that the dialogue and story-writing are phenomenal, as is the acting. I'm quite certain that, literally, every single line in this movie is extremely valuable to the movie's development. Seriously--I think I could explain at least half of them with a good paragraph per scripted line.

I won't run through the whole plot for you, you can find that in the product description or other reviews. I just want to explain why I think this movie is so good.
My opinion is based on things such as character development, symbolism, metaphor, etc. And then of course things like dialogue and acting.
Here is a list of the major themes dealt with in  (and dealt with in a way that will quite likely have you in tears as the story hits you very close to home and with the power of a kick to the face):
 - Facing your greatest fears/life in general instead of hiding from it (MAIN THEME, in my opinion)
 - Being thankful for what you still have (especially, family)
 - Dealing with the loss of a loved one (especially, a parent)
 - Probably several important great ones, but I think these are the most important.

Just watch this movie with an open heart, it will move you and inspire you to look around you and realize what, or who, you have been taking for granted in your life. I watched it for the first time alone, but was so blown away that I had to share it with my family. The second time through, I uncovered a lot that I had missed before and surprisingly my whole family found it just as moving. In fact neither me, nor my mother were even able to sleep that night! We apparently were both just laying in bed contemplating lines in the movie.

I don't mean to over-hype this movie, and I don't understand how it hasn't gotten the reviews that it deserves; but I truly hope, and I'm confident, that if you go into this movie with an openhearted attitude, it will inspire and change the way you see life as it did me and my family.",1315267200,5,2561,4.4297872340425535
4595352,5,B0057GUGGU,"""Life is like walking in the rain... you can hide and take cover or you can just get wet.""

Rarely in a film do I find a quote within it that perfectly describes the lessons it's trying to portray.  In ""Hesher"", directed by Spencer Susser, this quote resonated with me.  It was not until I heard that line that I fully understood what this movie was about.  ""Hesher"" is a great film.  One with a lot of heart and some brilliant writing.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays the outrageous Hesher perfectly and is by far (aside from ""Mysterious Skin"") his best work to date.

""Hesher"" plays out like a weird dream.  T.J., impressively played by Devin Brochu, is a young boy struggling with the loss of his mother.  He lives with his father Paul and his grandmother.  Paul, played by Rain Wilson, has fallen into a deep depression letting go all of his responsibility to his son and his own mother.  It's a very tragic situation they are in.  In a fit of rage T.J. vandalizes what he thinks is an unoccupied building and as a result is confronted by Hesher, terrifying T.J. in the process.  Hesher decides to follow T.J. to his home and lets himself in.  T.J. can't do anything about this random person entering the house, doing laundry and generally just making himself at home for fear that Hesher will harm his family.  What follows is a plethora of black comedy and heartfelt change within both Hesher and this distraught family.

At it's heart, ""Hesher"" is a film about not being able to see the things that are right in front of us until an outsider smacks us in the face with reality.  This isn't apparent in the beginning of the film, but as Hesher gets to know the family and the situation they are in he goes from ""house squatting"" to being part of the family.  In doing so the family is able to climb out of the rut they are in and fill the void left by the passing of the mother with the idea that life goes on.  The film takes a lot of time to get to this realization, but the time spent getting there is great fun to watch.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt impresses me more every time I see him.  His portrayal of the careless, fowl mouthed, violent, heavy metal loving outsider that we have all known at some point in our lives is spot on.  Levitt seemed to really engulf himself into this role, almost to the point where he wasn't acting and just being himself.  Rain Wilson also impressed me.  His feature films have generally been him re-hashing his role from ""The Office"" in various outrageous situations.  This time he was genuine and proved to this reviewer that his range goes beyond the weird goofball we are used to seeing.  Natalie Portman plays the small role of T.J.'s older love interest.  She was good, but her role seemed more like filler than anything else.  There is nothing wrong with that, her character just wasn't an important role to the story it seemed.

One of the best aspects of this film was the relationship between Hesher and the grandmother, Madeleine, played by Piper Laurie.  Hesher sees how Madeleine is just wandering aimlessly while Paul and T.J. deal with their problems completely ignoring her needs.  Hesher, I think finds something that reminds him of his own mother in Madeleine and shares some sweet moments with her.  Fortunately for Hesher, the grandmother's age has left her with the ability to completely ignore the fact that Hesher is just a stranger intruding into their lives and ends up treating him like one of her own.  This, I think is the turning point for Hesher and we see the change within him.

This film goes much deeper than what is on the surface.  Director and writer Spencer Susser did an amazing job with keeping the underlying meanings hidden until the right time for them to come to fruition.  Not once was I bored with what was going on and I couldn't wait to see what the next scene had to offer.  With this being Susser's first feature film, I am excited to see what he has next in the pipeline.  Make no mistake, there is some vial language in this film so it's not for those that will not be able to get past the offensiveness of it all.  But as I said, underneath the chain-smoking jerk that is Hesher you will find a kind soul that needed the Forney family just as much as they needed him.",1313625600,19,4255,4.476623376623377
4595353,5,B0057GUGGU,"Take a linear narrative, throw in a dash of chaos, and you end up with Hesher, a film that debuted at the Sundance Film Festival in 2010 but didn't see an official theatrical release until 2011. Playing with the person-helps-grieving-family storyline we've seen countless times, this is one of those indie dramas that assembles a cast of well-known actors and allows them to branch out from what's expected of them. The story, whether good or bad, functions as an opportunity for actors to play against type in a way that a typical mainstream movie wouldn't allow. Hardly a surprise, Hesher opened to mixed reviews with the majority of praise going to the actors and the majority of complaints going to the script and film itself. Well, with performances of this caliber and a story that is stronger than it has been given credit for; this film is actually quite successful.

T.J. (Devin Brochu) and his father Paul (Rainn Wilson) have recently suffered a traumatic loss that leaves them living with T.J.'s grandmother (Piper Laurie) and retreating into depression. T.J., who has found himself frequently tormented at school, becomes reclusive from those around him, while Paul wanders around the house in a prescription drug-induced daze. One day, T.J. stumbles upon Hesher (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), whose name and presence seem to be accompanied by the music of Metallica. In a classic example of deus ex machina, Hesher appears out of nowhere, with no back-story, and no reason to be in the film. He looks like a Grunge-era reject, drives a beat-up old van, has an upraised middle finger tattooed on his back, and seems to embrace chaos. He's also indifferent to societal rules; willfully disrespectful, vulgar, and violent. Despite T.J.'s protests, he moves into T.J.'s house and no one seems to care. During this time, T.J. meets Nicole (Natalie Portman), a young woman who captures his attention but turns her own attention to Hesher.

There are some inconsistencies in the script, particularly in regards to the title character. There is no logical reason for him to be in this film and his entire existence is disconnected from everything around him. The writers struggle to stay true to this strange character as he seems abnormally out-of-this-world one moment and like a human being with feelings and a conscience the next. It's a predictable move for this film to shape him from an ominous, violent thug into a caring, gentle soul; but luckily Gordon-Levitt is a gifted enough actor to make this transformation believable. Levitt crossed the threshold from child actor to real actor long ago, so there's no need to provide further proof about his acting ability. Regardless, Hesher is a great character role despite the inability of the film to define just who/what the character is. Once Levitt appears in character, it's impossible to take your eyes off him and who else but Levitt could make Hesher's speech at the end reach such a level of comic poignancy? Aside from Hesher, who is only truly developed from the performance rather than the script, the characters here are very well-developed and are brought to life marvelously.

This is the second time this year that Wilson has branched out from his Office character to prove what a gifted actor he is. There's very little humor in his character, giving Wilson the chance to stretch his acting muscles and bring Paul through a seamlessly convincing character arc. Brochu is a gifted young talent who brings some real, convincing emotional depth to the character of T.J. and Laurie, as the grandmother, is a lovely addition to the cast.

Hesher is an unapologetically weird little film that is destined to be misunderstood by most audiences. This little oddity of an indie drama is dark and violent, but ultimately sweet and hopeful and even funny at times.  By the time Hesher reaches the end of his character arc, it's all a bit contrived, but, call me crazy, I was quite fond of it. It plays with a traditional formula, isn't afraid to take chances, and boasts some very memorable performances. It's no masterpiece, but it's an enticing, satisfying film that kept me glued to the screen for its entire running time.

4595354,5,B0057GUGGU,"Hesher is a breath of fresh air for dark indie comedies.  Starring the well-known faces of Joseph Gordon Levitt, Natalie Portman, and Rainn Wilson, I think most indie-film viewers will immediately feel at home.  While being a criminal and a bit of a social deviant, the character of Hesher probably fulfills many of my boyhood dreams of an alternative hero.  I think the little boy inside of me wishes he could one day be Hesher, but I'm pretty sure that'll never happen.  On top of all the Metallica, reckless driving, picking on a little kid, and squatting in a stranger's home - Hesher does one amazing thing.  He forces, and at the same time helps, a family to deal with the loss of a loved one.

It's a great film.  I can't recommend it enough.  I'm really looking forward to the DVD release.",1309219200,,797,4.524475524475524
4595355,4,B0057GUGGU,This was actually a really good movie. Very unique and had alot of funny moments in it as well as sad. Joseph and Natalie's performances were on point as always. And the story was pretty quirky with alot of quirky characters. If you like Donnie Darko you will probably like this film alot. Its a story about loss and how people deal with it. Also its just interesting to see Hersher take over someones home. Trust me this is one you don't want to miss. Its a really really really hilarious journey.,1308182400,2,498,4.423913043478261

4595359,5,B0057GUGGU,"I saw this when it was in theaters seven times!!!  I kept bringing friends to see it & it's become one of my all time favorite movies.
It's two of Hollywood's biggest stars in a very small & independent film that literally gives the middle finger to mainstream Hollywood garbage.
It's dark & sad and features an unlikely comic/tragic hero who rescues three drowning souls by reminding them, in his own way, that life is for the living.  While not overtly apparent, Hesher has a deep philosophical message for the world that will likely be lost on the typical popcorn and Pepsi guzzling movie crowd who are willing to happily toss away $15 on another procedural poo fest like a Fast & Furious or SAW movie.

Hesher's solid foundation, as with any movie, is it's great script.  Top that with great acting (maybe JGLs best performance ever).
Hesher will make you cry and laugh and in the end will leave you with the certainty that you've just seen something,
but leaves it to you to figure out exactly what that is.  And that's EXACTLY what good art should do.

4595364,2,B0057GUGGU,"I wanted to like this movie.  The actors are superb - though their talent was wasted here.  The story line fails on most every level - thoroughly unrealistic.  To be fair, I could only make it through about 35 minutes before turning it off.  There was nothing ""hilarious"" about the movie ...",1512691200,,291,4.538461538461538
4595365,3,B0057GUGGU,"This movie is the emotional equivalent of Sharknado. At some points the emotional depth is enough that you think this is a really good movie, sometimes the humor is dark enough you think this is something you'll tell your friends about, but towards the end you realize that the people who made this movie didn't know what the frack they were doing. It's like they had two competing teams making the same movie. One was a real Hollywood team and the other is a team of 4-chan-posting, web-trolling high school teenagers. Then at some point the scripts and editing got switched and they end up with an incoherent mix of meaningful philosophy and stupid jokes. It's not a comedy (not even a dark comedy), and it's not a drama. It's just a bad movie. This movie just barely made 3 stars, only because I stuck around long enough to see the movie's last scene, which was funny in a very silly, stupid, teenage way. The movie is definitely a B movie, even though Portman and Gordon-Levitt are in it. By the way, Gordon-Levitt and Portman were HORRIBLE actors. Especially Gordon-Levitt. I mean HORRIBLE. JESUS!

Spoiler alert. Okay, my real beef is the funeral scene. When the kid and dad join Hesher in ""walking with grandma"" the movie loses all coherence. That scene is so stupid it makes the movie lose all credibility. That scene tips the movie from introspective dark humor to Ben Stiller-style non-sensical lampooning. That scene alone made it go from 5 to 3 stars.",1511827200,,1463,4.692607003891051

4595367,2,B0057GUGGU,"The performances are fine, the directing is OK, and the overall premise is strong, but this movie never finds its tone, and the writing just isn't compelling. Given the premise, what should work here is humor, but the plot is saddled with too much emotional weight for the director to be reasonably expected to wring humor out of Hesher's intrusion onto this unassuming suburban family. It's hard to get a laugh out of a flaming diving board and subsequent VD confession when they're being forced upon a child who is already dealing with a serious familial trauma and a despondent, grieving father.

And that's where the writing fails: for most of this movie, I didn't really see Hesher and TJ's dad as really all that different, because it's not until the last 10 minutes of the movie that the viewer gets a glimpse into TJ's life before his mom's death. Having never assumed that TJ had previously been living in a kind of Leave it to Beaver fantasy world, I had no grasp on just how much his life had changed since her death -- I could only tell that he and his father were very sad and angry. Moreover, Hesher just seemed like another in a string of oddities in an otherwise decentralized life. That means that rather than feeling a sense of momentum and culmination as the movie climaxes, I was left wondering why the movie's close was presented with all these grandiose emotions I just wasn't feeling and why I hadn't laughed more.

Ultimately, this movie would have been stronger if the writer hadn't tried to cram all this self-serious, hyperemotional content into it or if the writing created clearer distinctions between TJ's life before and after Hesher's arrival.",1510358400,2,1675,4.732876712328767

4595406,5,B0057GUGGU,"Incredible and beautiful movie as long as you have the patience to get hooked. It took a little bit for me to really understand Hesher (the character) who is a brash metal head who generally speaks in crude profanities (as us metal heads tend to do) but behind his chaos is an incredible deep meaning. This is absolutely a tale of a ""non-traditional"" person coming in to help a family in need. think of it like a vulgar merry poppins. The cast is incredible, and the movie will most certainly make you feel and think at the same time. beautiful movie. absolutely worth seeing time and again.",1457568000,,591,4.5327102803738315
4595407,5,B0057GUGGU,"In the 26 years of watching Joseph Gordon Levitt grow-up before our eyes,""HESHER"" was quite a departure from his days on ""3rd ROCK FROM THE SUN"",,and inspite of this movie's brutal and crude approach to life,the Anarchistic charecter that Levitt plays,was almost mystical-of a sort!
the deep and emotional impact of the movie's two main charecters,,TJ and his Father,was certainly understandable,having to deal with an intimate tragedy,with the loss of his wife,we watch little TJ going through hell,,being bullied by a punk kid,who does vulgar things,,being in an uncaring and unsympathetic world,as the little boy tries to save his mom's car-his only tie to his mother,,and then his encounter with Hesher,which has to be the ultimate mind blowing experience for a child to deal with,watching an unapologetic,i'll do what i want,charecter,who pulls no punches-although the scene,where Hesher hits the boy with his van,,that's kinda hard to accept,and cold blooded,,but then,""HESHER"" shows a raw and all too real view of what life is like,in the mind of people,like the title charecter! Hesher's interactions with TJ's grand mother,played by the talented Piper Laurie (""CARRIE"",""CHILDREN OF A LESSER GOD"") showed some signs of compassion,,but this movie is hardly an idea theme for compassion,until the
scene,where the grandma dies,then the charecters all come to the gloomy part of their personal tragedies,that Hesher tries to make them all understand,in his own,anarchistic manner!  if viewers can survive the profanity and crudeness of this movie,""HESHER"" was actually a well made labor of love-if you love a charecter that looks like a ""grunge band"" reject,and acts like a king punk from the streets,then this movie is for you! we're
left wondering if TJ and his dad are well on their road to recovery,as Hesher leaves them both,with a mangled car,that used to be his mom's car-the ultimate reward,in this crude,but somewhat uplifting film,that journeys into the misfortunes of life,and those,who have to deal with such great loss!
Joseph Gordon Levitt delivers a superior role,that shows how far he's come,from the days of playing little ""Tommy Solomon""-a gifted actor!!",1457395200,,2176,5.4

4595412,5,B0057GUGGU,"This was a great film!  It's one of those that has a sort of addicting classic vibe to it like Pulp Fiction or Detroit Rock City or Bad Santa or Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas that makes it never get old.  You could watch it again and again and it's always good.  It's a really interesting story.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character, Hesher, is this really crazy guy that keeps getting everyone in trouble but strangely he's actually helping everyone and teaching them lessons in a subtle way.  Maybe you have to watch it for a second time to pick up on it.  But you realize that he is actually really doing everyone a favor and he's helping the little kid to grow up and get out of the stage of depression he is in because of the loss of his mother.  He's really a godsend in the most bizarre way.  The whole family is just going downhill and in turmoil and this weird Hesher guy shows up and he's not a good guy but yet he's very likable!  Think along the lines of Captain Spaulding in The Devil's Rejects.  It's a very dark movie.  It's sad at times, but it's also a lot of fun at times.  Check it out for sure if you're into movies like the ones I listed in the above paragraph.  I think especially if you imagine some weird combination of Bad Santa and Detroit Rock City, as it kind of has that tone and vibe.  Hesher is like one of the metal head kids in Detroit Rock City when they become a drifter hitchhiker small time criminal in their mid 20s, but before he becomes a total drunken wreck as in Bad Santa, and just as Bad Santa was a bad guy but was still likable and he cared about the little kid, it's a bit like that.

4595435,4,B0057GUGGU,"This was a film that really surprised me. Honestly, I was expecting some kind of ""odd"" Independent film that wasn't going to make sense, but if you watch and pay attention, it all comes together in the end. Enter TJ. T.J is just another 13 year old, or at least it appears that way. He hates school and there this ugly kid (older than him) who tortures and torments him making his days more or less ""suck"". We all remember those days in junior high and high school. I know I do. Hesher...who is Hesher? Well, TJ finds out in what appears to be a ""not so good way""...but who is he? Initially, he seems like a drifting sociopath. He does what he wants, when he wants despite the consequences because, well...he just doesn't care. He listens to ""metal"", watches porn, likes to burn and blow things up and well...his ""table and bed side"" manner leave little to be desired. As you watch and understand more of why TJ's life is in ruins, you understand more Hesher's role in this. Did he enter TJ's life because he just wanted a place to ""squat"" for a while, or is he trying to help T.J in a ""Hesher"" sort of way? Maybe its the only way he knows how? Well worth seeing and in time I plan on purchasing this gem oddity of a film.",1434326400,,1222,4.24892703862661
4595436,5,B0057GUGGU,Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance was outstanding and his monologue towards the end alone was worth the price of admission. Not a lot of people have heard about Hesher which is a shame because it is truly a wonderful movie. The story is touching...in a screwed up way. Multiple notable actors and actresses. It just is just so outlandish at times but still has that true to life feel.,1431302400,,385,4.7611940298507465

4595438,5,B0057GUGGU,"This is one of those movies that I happen upon a lazy Sunday and don't expect to get much out of.

Hesher surprised me. It delighted me. It entertained me. It even gave me feels. Not exactly what I was expecting from a Netflix ""new release"" listing. I enjoyed this film so much that I actually wanted to watch it again and did so using Amazon Instant Videos.

Hesher is a wild ride. Natalie Portman plays a character that is a bit out of her usual ""type"". In this film, Portman portrays a young woman who hasn't really grown up yet. She isn't mature. She isn't established. She lacks direction. Portman usually plays characters that are wise and mature. This mess of a woman in Hesher is a fun change of pace for Portman.

Rainn Wilson delivers a wonderful performance in what feels like an attempt to prove to audiences that he isn't just a goofy, weird comedic TV actor. I feel that his depressing, apathetic father portrayal is a great way to do that.

Then, of course, there is Joseph Gordon-Levitt. JGL made this film at a time when he was a hot commodity (not that he isn't now) and I feel that his status allowed him the freedom to just say ""F' it!"" and do whatever he wanted. Watching him portray Hesher is enchanting, mesmerizing, entertaining and hilarious. Hesher is that guy that your parents warned you about but with a touch of heart hidden in the mix. He may be unconventional but he never stops being human.

Combine all of that with an insane soundtrack that will make your blood race and your skin crawl. And boom, you have a fun movie worthy of a Sunday (or even a Friday) evening.

I loved this film because of all of the surprising against type performances by the three stars. I laughed a lot. I applauded (in my head) for some of the amazing scenes. I even shed a few tears towards the end.

If you take the time to watch this movie, I feel you will enjoy yourself immensely. If not, then we can not be friends.",1430092800,,1934,4.370473537604457

4595448,5,B0057GUGGU,"My high school buddy Brian wrote this film, or at least the foundational story of it, and I read the original script. We went to high school in an affluent, white, surfer-y southern CA town, and there was a small, interesting Hessian subculture that Brian obviously drew some inspiration from. As a disclaimer, I know some of the behind-the-scenes stuff, but that actually hasn't tainted my feelings about this film. Despite it veering very heavily from Brian's original vision, I think it's overall a great movie. The young protagonist does an amazing job; and Levitt is humorous, complex, and very memorable as the Hesher. I loved the dark humor and antisocial vibe. This is a bold film, and well-directed by one of the members of the Australian Blue-Tongue Films collective. (Personally, I like David Michod's work -- short films, The Rover -- a bit better, but that's just me. And Michod contributed to Hesher.) I liked how this film is populated with people who've fallen through the cracks, good but damaged people trying their best. Hesher captures the horror of life quite well, but balances things out with humor and humanity. And if you see Susser's short film ""I Love You Sarah Jane"", you'll see some of the ideas that were more fleshed out in feature length film format here in Hesher. There are some indie movie cliches and problems with Hesher; but it goes to show what makes a good movie -- not necessarily a huge budget or special effects, etc -- just strong performances by actors in a film that's willing to be different, be subversive, push boundaries, and embrace the Hessian/Hesher in all of us. It was also really cool to see this film made, the whole process of going from script to screen. I'm glad it happened.",1417392000,5,1735,4.767441860465116
4595449,5,B0057GUGGU,"While this film may repel many, as it is often repellent, I found this to be a unique film, where a counter-culture anarchist, played
amazingly by Joseph Gordon Levitt, manages to bring positive changes to the lives of a depressed family, despite being a most
repugnant, and often times repulsive character.  This is a dark comedy, not hilarious, but amusing,  It is an indie, and despite its
coarseness, is actually a very sentimental film ultimately.  It has a positive message that emerges from a lot of unpleasant and
negative moments.  It is one of my all-time favorites, which is completely opposite in mood of the overwhelming majority of the
films I usually praise.  I have watched this about half a dozen times, and it gets better with each viewing.  Great cast and acting,
Also featuring Natalie Portman, Rainn Wilson, and Piper Laurie, as well as a lesser known young teen, Devin Brochu, who is the
central character along with Levitt.  The boy suffers emotionally and physically through the entire film, having lost his mother in
a car accident, yet somehow retains his resilience, helped by Levitt, who does all kinds of mostly awful things, yet somehow helps
him and his family to get back to living, despite his obnoxious lewd crude and rude behavior.",1416873600,2,1266,4.88785046728972

The Blu-Ray arrived in good condition, and the acting and production values in the movie were more than competent.  Unfortunately, these are the only good things I have to say about the Hesher experience.  To sum up, the movie concerns a father and a son, the latter in his late tweens or earlyl teens, still grieving over the loss of the wife/mother.  Hesher, a psychopathic drifter, wanders into the their lives, getting the son into all sorts of trouble and behaves offensively to the Dad.  The father is a miracle of passivity who, by all rights, should have had Hesher jailed.  At the end of the movie, Hesher's anti-social behavior is somehow supposed to be inspiring.

4595465,3,B0057GUGGU,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

Choosing a single adjective to describe Hesher would be impossible due to its complete off-the-wall, and utterly unpredictable, story. A film like this one prides itself in being weird, quirky, and insane, and this confidence shows for the entire hour and 40 minutes. However, confidence cant mask an incomplete story and some bland performances, and these are exactly the areas in which Hesher stumbles. With some odd casting choices and a weird final arc, Hesher never really connects the way that its supposed to, but it still manages to be enjoyable despite its obvious flaws.

The story follows a young boy, T.J. (Devin Brochu), and his father, Paul (Rainn Wilson). After a car crash leads to the death of T.J.s mother, both individuals become depressed as they try to cope with the sudden loss. It doesnt take long before T.J. meets the mysterious Hesher (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), and pretty soon he takes up residence at T.J.s home. Completely apathetic to the fact he wasn't invited, Hesher continues living with the family as they deal with the grieving process. Chaos and mayhem quickly ensue, and the family learns that even someone as strange as Hesher can offer some guidance when the time calls for it.

At first, this narrative seems to be enough to stand on its own, but the writers apparently felt otherwise. In addition to the main story arc, there are arguably two others: the story of Hesher himself, and that of the young grocery story clerk, Nicole (Natalie Portamn). The former would have been intriguing, and even welcome, when paired with T.J. and Pauls story. Unfortunately, that isn't what the audience was given. In fact, Heshers character never gets explained at all. The viewer never really learns who he is, where he came from, or why he lives life the way he does. He just exists in this world, and were forced to accept this as adequate information.

So, instead of delving into the mystery that is the title character, Hesher decides to add a fourth party in the form of Nicole. This young woman, whos age was never specified, is undoubtedly having a hard time in life. She only works 16 hours a week; she is unable to pay her bills, and her life doesnt seem to be going anywhere. A generic character who can easily be found in most dramas, but she isn't terrible. My issue, though, is how insignificant and out-of-place she feels in this world. Beyond being the crush of young T.J., Nicoles purpose in the story is hazy, to say the least. There are no words of wisdom and, like Hesher, shes just kind of there.

Taking that into consideration, the main story arc is enough to keep things interesting. Everyone handles death differently, and Hesher sympathetically demonstrates the worst symptom: depression. Paul lays on the couch and sleeps all day, and T.J. becomes obsessed with the car his mother died in, which is sitting in the junkyard. The message, if there is one, would definitely be learning to let go. As difficult as it may seem at first, death is a part of life, and allowing yourself to slip into nothingness isn't the proper way to handle your problems.

The real driving force in this movie, however, is Hesher himself. His dark, mysterious nature makes him instantly attractive, and as a viewer it becomes difficult to take your eyes off him whenever hes on screen. Hes foul-mouthed, short-tempered, and incomprehensible, but this only adds to his charm. Furthermore, Joseph Gordon-Levitt was a total knockout, and I was amazed at how well he got into character. There were multiple instances during the film where I had to remind myself that I was watching JGL and not some other, unknown actor. He was convincing, confident, and a blast to watch.

Unfortunately, the only other standout, in my opinion, was Rainn Wilson, but he was never given an extreme amount of dialogue. Most of his performance came from his passiveness towards life, and I think he did a great job portraying the overwhelming depression that consumes most after death. Brochu, on the other hand, was inconsistent, at best. There were a handful of moments where he truly impressed me, but a majority of the time I found his performance to be embarrassingly flat. Portman wasn't anything to write home about, either. In addition to having an out-of-place character, her performance felt uninspired, and she always seemed confused as to why she was even there.

Overall Score: 6.9/10 - Insanely unpredictable, and a little difficult to digest, Hesher's comedic take on death and sorrow manages to be both entertaining and incredibly ridiculous. Unfortunately, the writers ignored the prospect of explaining Hesher's character, and opted to include Nicole instead. With an inconsistent story and some bland performances, Hesher never manages to live up to its potential, but it is fun in its own, unique way. Its at least worth the rental if it piqued your interest.",1391817600,,4938,4.905389221556886

4595495,5,B0057GUGGU,"Spencer Susser's paean to the Punk Revolution of the 70's works just as well as it would have forty years ago. This instant cult classic stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Hesher, who moves in on the Forneys after 13-year-old T.J. (Devin Brochu) inadvertently gets him chased out of the abandoned building he inhabits. Hesher makes an ally of Grandma (Piper Laurie) and becomes the influential male figure in the home by default. He is a rebuke and a disgrace to father Paul (Rainn Wilson), whose life has collapsed after the recent death of his wife. T.J. slowly gravitates towards Hesher though aghast by his lawlessness, which includes assault and battery, vandalism and break-ins, not to mention constant foul language and total disregard for social convention. The conflict develops as T.J. comes across Hesher having sex with his heartthrob, an older girl (Natalie Portman) working at a local supermarket. T.J. and Paul combine to run Hesher off, but his influence on their lives helps them overcome their grief over T.J.'s Mom's death as well as the sudden loss of Grandma. Hesher reappears at Grandma's funeral, and they realize an epiphany in his celebration of life and his ability to adapt and overcome by having no concern whatsoever for the things he cannot change.

This may come across to many audiences as a ""Raging Bull"" type flick, an unpalatable, unblinking look at a social neanderthal. For those fascinated by teenage angst as well as those in search of Sundance-type flicks exploring the meaning of life in the dark closets of our lives, Hesher is well worth a buy.",1364169600,,1582,4.969811320754717

4595503,3,B0057GUGGU,"Hesher is a dark comedy/drama film co-written and directed by Spencer Susser and starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the titular character and Devin Brochu as TJ and Rainn Wilson as his father Paul. I'll admit I neither hated nor loved this film, but I definitely leaned more towards hated it. It felt so dark and disturbing at times, especially towards the end when TJ starts to lose it, that it took away from alot of the darkly funny humor of the first half of the film. I felt I would have liked Hesher more if it had been a straight black comedy, rather than a comedy/drama as it turned out to be. All of the right ingredients were there, vulgar nihilistic loner Hesher forcing his way into the lives of a depressed father and his grieving bullied son. However, instead of sticking to the comedy that kept this film from being too dark and depressing, it abandoned that formula towards the middle and degraded itself into rather bleak drama, and the attempts at humor toward the end felt pathetic, lazy, and unfunny. I'll admit there was a somewhat touching moment towards the end involving a coffin, but truth be told, despite being funny and entertaining (atleast in the beginning) this film felt almost pointless. What was the point of the Hesher character, was he there to improve the lives of TJ's family or destroy what little happiness there was left. Based on the way the film progressed it would seem as if he improved their lives, but there doesn't seem to be any particular reason why things got better all of sudden, especially in the last few scenes. Yes, this film has a somewhat happy ending, which again kept this film from a lower rating, but it could have been alot better. Also, I thoroughly enjoyed Natalie Portman's character, and if this film was a straight comedy, it would actually be her character that would bring the quality of the film from a 4 star rating to a 5 star. Hesher, though oddly likable, was a bit of an prick at times, and not the sort of person I would want to meet in real life.",1360886400,5,2023,4.545205479452055

4595510,5,B0057GUGGU,"This 2010 film called Hesher is designed to make the viewer uncomfortable and challenged to think differently.

This story follows the lives of a family of three, a grand mother, her adult son, and the grandson (TJ). The actor playing the father (Rainn Wilson), he's in lots of movies and I think he usually plays in comedies. Hesher is not a comedy but it did make me laugh, a lot.

There are several converging story lines in this film.

The grandmother who funds everything and silently keeps the family together is dealing silently with end of life issues.

The father and son are dealing with the recent death of the wife/mother but really don't explain what happened.

The son is being beat up in school by various bullies and bad situations.

On his way to school the son encounters a skinny, pale, long haired, dope smoking, tattoo'd homeless guy (Hesher) after he wrecks his bike (again) in a residential construction site.

The homeless guy ends up following the boy and pushes his way into their home to do his laundry then won't leave. Hesher hits it off with the grandmother probably because she's lonely and just wants someone to talk to and seemed un-moved by his often shirtless, bizzare, with long haired appearance.

The boy seems obsessed with buying their wrecked family car but never explains why. The father is jobless and spends most of the day on the sofa sleeping. Hesher follows the boy around observing him in a series of bad situations. The boy (TJ) yells at Hesher for not helping him, ordering him to stay away again and again, which of course never works.

The boy develops a crush on an older grocery store clerk, which Hesher also ruins.

And not to spoil the movie, but the story lines all come together in the end as everyone's lives are improved by Hesher's absurd ways. In the final ten minutes of the film everyone's problems are explained to the viewer.

Played flawlessly and fiercely by Joseph Gorgon-Levitt, Hesher is a FORCE.
Natalie Portman is perfect in her portrayal of one of us 99%.  Rainn Wilson is also spinnin' some acting magic in this one.
Devin Brochu is the actor who begins the film, and incredibly, for one so young amongst so much talent, he shines bright and is as strong within the ensemble as any (great job, Devin!)
And oddly, once viewed, it renews faith even in what can be the oddest of families, friendship, and surviving.

The so-called writer/director must have been one helluva talker to get a $7 million(?!!!)budget for this P.O.S.!! How many decent and fine scripts were passed over for this POS? Small hospitals could have been built with $7 million, even landfills which is where this POS deserves to be buried, oh, so deep! If I could, I'd buy the rights to this POS and destroy every copy.

This has to be a record-breaker for the ""F"" word and hearing it out of the mouths of kids is so not funny. Art (if this is what you want to call it) is a reflection of the artist, what they love, what turns them on,how they view the world. By seeing this piece of crap I can see the writer/director is obsessed with drugs/)truly disgusting porn/vandalism/theft, et al. and desperately needs to grow up and pull his head out of the sewer. The Hesher character is merely a large INFANT with a driver's license and no boundaries smashing through the world in one ugly tantrum after another. So sick of these movies! The world is burning.

4595526,4,B0057GUGGU,"An excellent boy film, film about a boy at the sorrow and sad age of twelve or something, when the boy is confronted with real life, that is to say mourning and a boy that age does not know how to deal with mourning. Death maybe, but mourning no. Death is simple. It comes and it is finished. You stay behind and the real thing is starting: mourning.

Imagine an accident and you lose a parent and the car. You can mourn the parent or you can just accept the death of that parent and mourn the car. Mourning is a form of love that attaches you to an object or a person that no longer lives or exists. So mourning for a child of twelve is dramatic because he does not see beyond the present and because mourning is for him eternal.

He can get attached to a stranger who is going to create havoc around him, that's Hesher, or to a nice young woman who is going to become the substitute of the dead mother, and all the time he is going to be attached to the car in which the mother died, him in the back and his father at the wheel. He does not know what he is doing of course, but he has become a fetishist of the car. And that is sad.

And one day another dramatic event will happen and that will bring the crazy friend around and that will bring the world upside down and that will bring the world back onto its feet because it was standing its feet in the air before. And mourning will be finished and closure will be reached and life can start existing again, but unluckily the friend who created that havoc will have disappeared though he will present you with the cadaver of the car on your doorstep.

And you can keep that cadaver for ever and ever in your front garden or your back yard, next to your swimming pool if you have one or behind your cherry tree if there is one in your back garden.

That's why this film is interesting because it tells you how a boy of 12 years of age or so will find closure for the dramatic event that has sent his mind right upside down under his knees and next to his soles. There is a tremendous empathy in the anger it expresses, I don't mean tell, just your empathy of anger you get out of the story, if you have ever experienced such a loss at such an early age. If you haven't you will never ever be able to really get any event to closure because it will always be foreclosed before it happens, since foreclosure is always before the term of some said period of time.

4595527,5,B0057GUGGU,"Hesher is probably a thousand times better than I went in expecting.  Not that I expected a terrible film by any means especially after reading an enticing description, but I never would have guessed the quality of the storytelling is *this* extremely high.

It's basically about a little boy who gets into trouble by picking fights with older kids and bullies, and in one instance, throws a rock through the window of a young long-haired, lazy, disrespectful heavy metal-loving lowlife that the kid had no right messing with (and who soon becomes the lead character in the movie named Joseph Gordon-Levitt).  As soon as he throws the rock, the man comes out of the house and yanks the kid back inside.  Then the cops arrive so the guy terroizes and surprises the kid by throwing a grenade through the broken window at the cop!  Joseph's character apparently has no concern for the after effects of his actions and throughout the movie manages to escape every tricky and potentially risky stunt he pulls.

There's SO many things that occur throughout this movie that just screams interesting, exciting and enticing around every single corner that it'd be unfair to list them all and therefore spoil the film, so let's just say Joseph's character invites himself into the home of the boy one day, lives there, does whatever he wants, and the father and grandmother of the little boy just assume the man is a friend of their son/grandson, lol.  It's really bizarre and yet, ultimately fascinating.  From here, well, the little boy has TWO problems now.  The bully at school who's waiting for the perfect chance to tear the kid apart for writing offensive remarks on his car, and dealing with the long-haired man that suddenly decides to make himself at home and picks on the boy himself.  Poor kid!

There wasn't a single second that I turned away in boredom while watching Hesher.  Constant storyline unpredictability and creativity occurred the entire time and that's a rare accomplishment in todays world.  There's also the segment with the cashier lady at the downtown grocery store played by Natalie Portman that the little boy has a crush on, so certain scenes develop between the two of them.  Not necessarily relationship-type segments that you're probably thinking, but more like, well, adventures.  Little awkward adventures around town, shall we say!

Some may argue there's not really a point to all these crazy and adventurous events that take place between the little boy, the Joseph's character, the school bully (who also works at the car shop and finds himself involved with the little boy there as well), Natalie Portman's character, the boys father and the boys grandmother.  But I have to disagree, thanks to the ending.  There most certainly is a point, though perhaps not the one you're leaning towards.  A point that comes out of left field.

Still, a satisfying conclusion to a very different type of drama story with light touches of comedy, though you probably have to be someone who's not concerned for constant swearing and lots of direct sexual-related talk (even though there's no actual nudity present anywhere).  It's true the language is somewhat offensive in a few segments (especially the one involving Natalie and Joseph's character sitting in a car and talking about sex in a really graphic way before Natalie even introduces herself- Joseph comes across as totally disrespectful the way he talks to the girl in such a tasteless way) but other than that, I'm happy with the film overall.  Wonderful example of originality.",1344816000,,3557,4.952861952861953

4595529,3,B0057GUGGU,"Young T.J. (Devin Brochu) and his father, Paul (Rainn Wilson), are still reeling from a family tragedy that has left them both depressed and isolated. They live with T.J.'s grandmother (Piper Laurie) and barely communicate with anyone in the darkened and dismal home. By chance, T.J. crosses paths with Hesher (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a homeless metalhead who ends up forcing his way into their lives. This movie is about how Hesher's violent, foul-mouthed, seemingly nihilistic influence creates both chaos and peace among the members of this fractured and failing family.

As I watched the film, I hoped and prayed that it would not follow the same path as every other Eccentric Outsider Helps Struggling Group Find Peace And Unity movie that has ever existed from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-and-the-Hendersons/dp/B000MRNWKG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry and the Hendersons</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Captain-Ron/dp/B000065V3P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Captain Ron</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mary-Poppins/dp/B0060D11OU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mary Poppins</a>&nbsp;... sorry, I'm sure there are more examples, but those are the first three that came to mind. My examples are comedies, and HESHER certainly pretends (in parts) to be a comedy, but this is, in fact, a very dark film, and even the faux-happy ending that is tacked on does little to lighten the grimness that both the script and Hesher seem compelled to force onto the characters.

Unfortunately, although Hesher isn't as cheesy of a guiding/unifying force as a drunken captain or lost Sasquatch or prim-n-proper magical maid, the script fails to put him in a position that is very unique to stories of this ilk. He even has a big speech at the end where The Moral is dutifully imparted (albeit in an amusingly crass and chaotic way) to the family who finally Learns Their Lesson. Hesher's influence is many times baffling and arbitrary, which lead me to believe that this odd little film was going to trod a different path, but in the end, first time writer/director Spenser Susser just couldn't go beyond the basic moral framework that you always find in these films.

In spite of the aggressively dismal script and fairly standard emotional arc, the movie's performances are absolutely seamless. Wilson, Levitt, Laurie, and Portman do incredible work as their characters. They take the mess of the script and find true and meaningful pathos in it. Major props especially go to Brochu, who does a stellar job as the lead character, evincing the kind of depth of emotion you rarely find in child stars these days. Although the story is alienating and depressing and ultimately nothing all that new, there is richness to be found simply in watching these excellent actors inhabit their world, no matter how mundane or glum it may be.",1343865600,,2978,5.825688073394495

Hitting someone with a van was their idea of a joke.  Lighting things on fire, heck we all did that.  Metallica, not so much, that's something you gotta grow into.  And Hesher's sensitive side that doesn't make sense to a number of reviewers here- that's the point- many nihilists are so affected by the fate of the planet and the despair of humanity that it drives them to outwardly uncaring while inwardly suffering.
With just a glance at the broken crockery on the floor you can see Hesher's own traumatic childhood spattered on the cabinets, and when he tells T.J. to go walk with his grandma he means it with good reason, as he is estranged from his own family.

4595534,4,B0057GUGGU,Joseph Gorden Levitt rocks our socks off. This is the mash pit of rom-coms. Ridiculous anarchy disguised as soul searching melodrama drifts into a sweet film.,1336521600,,158,5.115384615384615
4595535,2,B0057GUGGU,"Whenever I hear about a group of critics giving high praise to a movie I immediately am fearful that the movie will be terrible. Most critics tend to look at the ""artistic"" merit of a film and toss out the entire idea that it should be entertaining. Some go so far as to feel that if a movie entertains it has failed in its mission to articulate some big idea. These same critics fail to realize that most people plopping down anywhere from $5 to $10 to see a movie or even $1 to rent it want something for their money and most want to be entertained. So it was I was concerned when I read high praise for the movie HESHER. Still, I wanted to see it for myself.

I'll start by saying there were things I liked about HESHER and there were things I hated about it. Did it entertain? In some ways, yes but for the most part it just seemed determined to either offend or show those who would be offended just how uncool they really are. Call me square I guess.

Devin Brochu stars as young T.J., a boy dealing with the loss of his mother. We don't discover this for sure until later in the film but in having him race his bike chasing a crashed car being towed away you kind of figure it out early on. T.J. isn't the only one having trouble dealing with the loss. His father Paul (Rainn Wilson) tends to sit around the house, deep into anti-depressants and doing very little. Only T.J.'s grandmother (Piper Laurie) seems to have any life left in her and she's much older than she acts.

T.J. seems to find himself in trouble most of the time, especially at school. It's there he runs afoul of the school bully, a youngster who works at the junkyard where T.J.'s crashed family car was taken. Avoiding this bully, T.J. ends up at a housing project and in an act of anger tosses a rock through a window of a house being built. Before he can toss another, out walks a straggly looking vagrant who we learn later is named Hesher (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).  When security shows, Hesher tosses a grenade their way after informing T.J. that T.J. screwed him over.

Later T.J. sees the same black van Hesher was driving following him, eventually stopping in front of his house. Turning from the window, T.J. finds Hesher in his living room, apparently squatting there now since his last ""home"" was taken away. The oddest thing is that no one seems to tell Hesher he has to leave except T.J. who is threatened.

Life goes on this way with Hesher witness to all sorts of violent acts against T.J. He never steps in as they occur, but he does later doing things like setting the school bully's car on fire. It's Hesher's way of forcing T.J. to stand up for himself but at the same time shows nothing less than total anarchy. But that's Hesher's character, one who lives for the moment and for the most part thinks only of himself. But not always.

T.J. eventually befriends a young woman named Nicole (Natalie Portman) who works as a clerk at the local grocery store. For some reason he connects with her, using her as a substitute for his deceased mother. Their friendship grows but seems just as odd as his strange friendship with Hesher. A later betrayal in T.J.'s eyes leads the two to part ways with the hope of it ending better before the final reel.

The movie crawls along at a steady yet slow seeming pace with little to find attractive in it. Everything has a murky brown, cluttered feel to it. And while you feel an amount of sympathy for the lead characters, you eventually just want to yell get on with it. Hesher, the anti-hero we should be thrilled to root for just seems like a malcontent who helps people only when it benefits himself.

I read someone say that this felt like an update of SHANE. I disagree. In that film we had a lawbreaker who lived with his gun that came along and helped a family find themselves. In this one we have a lawbreaker more inclined to fit the Jack Palance character in SHANE, the evil gunslinger who lived only for himself.

There is one thing to like in this film and that's the acting. Brochu turns in a fine performance for a young actor, but it would have been nice to see him do more than scream. They even reference that in the gag reel included in the special section. I think Rainn Wilson is a terrific actor, but he's wasted here doing little more than look pained and depressed from start to finish. Levitt is the one to watch here. Remembering him when he was a child star and seeing him develop into an actor worth watching is remarkable.

So if the acting was the best thing what was the worst? The script. To me it's becoming clich to portray the world as one big cesspool, an ugly place where nothing but ugly things happen. The script also uses what I consider to be the laziest thing possible, using vulgar language for shock value. To hear Hesher talk to T.J. about using various appendages and inserting them into various orifices isn't funny, amusing or helps develop the character though I'm sure many will think it does. To me it just gets in the way of the story and when used as often as it is here it distracts rather than helps. I've been known to toss out an expletive a time or two, but here it wasn't needed.

The other bad item is Natalie Portman being completely wasted here. Her part seems like more of a cameo than an honest role. One scene becomes crucial to the development of T.J.'s life, but other than that her part could have been phoned in.

So on the whole while I enjoyed the performances of some of the cast, I felt that this movie lacked in far too many areas. The rebel without a clue idea has been done better and has been overused. The ideas of what makes a character the cool one here has nothing to do with values and everything to do with self satisfaction. And in the end this film commits the worst mistake of not being entertaining.",1332201600,2,5816,4.374074074074074
4595536,5,B0057GUGGU,"This is one of those rare indi type films that is hard to categorise, except in being able to say it is ruddy excellent. It is about a young boy T.J. (Devin Brochu), who has lost his mother in a fatal car crash His father Paul (Rain Wilson of `Super' fame) is wallowing in prescription drug dependency as a way to by pass the grief. They are living with his Grandma and life is slowly unravelling.

After T.J. smashes a window of a house where Hesher (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is crashing, their paths become entwined. Hesher follows him in the best stalker style and decides he will just move in. The first thing he does is strip off and do his laundry followed by making an illegal cable hook up so they can get more TV channels - especially of the more adult variety.

T.J. is dealing with ghosts and bullies in equal measure and that leads to a chance meeting with supermarket cashier Nicole (Natalie Portman). T.J. bonds with her but Hesher is never too far away. He has an unhealthy like for profanity, porn, Metallica and arson; an ideal house guest you might say. Therfore not the sort of friend a young boy should really be associated with. What happens though is that the more mayhem he creates the more he breaks the catharsis of grief that is holding every body back.

This film does not stick to any convention, it is totally unpredictable and that is the essence of Hesher himself. There are no real pretty actors everything is seemingly low rent but with real people and it is so refreshing for that. Joseph Gordon-Levitt continues to take on challenging roles and make interesting and well crafted cinema and is one of those actors who can be relied upon to make viewing, anything he is in, worthwhile. That said every single performance is to the high end of excellent especially Devin Brochu as T.J.

Directed and co - written by Spencer Susser in his debut for a major picture, who has struck cinematic gold for this off the wall, funny, rude, moving and brilliant film.

It has good acting just horrible plot & truly elementary character creation.
The point of the film is not to judge what looks bad... as evil, and also how help can come in the strangest ways. The plot and point of this movie probably couldn't even barely ""pass"" for a black comedy which is a style I would be fan of usually. For Ex: ""A Clockwork Orange"" or ""Fight Club"".

A protagonist who is simply a wanna-be ""tough guy"" or a hypocrite in other words.

Unfortunately this film not only fails to entertain, but fails the smell test of reality.  Since this isn't an action movie or a sci-fi movie or a comic book movie, it would seem that the events might in fact have some likelihood of really happening.

The first time I see this guy, I'm calling 911 but this family lets him move in.

The film centers on the accidental death of the wife/mother who was killed a couple months earlier in a car accident.  TJ (Brochu) wants the car back after it was sold for junk, but must deal with the salvage operator's teen-age son who is the school bully.  In several scenes Hesher could prevent TJ's thumpings but doesn't.  You just know, he's trying to toughen up the kid by allowing him to be force fed urinal cake.  Or maybe turn him in to a psychotic serial killer.  Who knows.  Natalie Portman plays a part time grocery cashier who has trouble making ends meet but helps TJ avoid another thumping in the parking lot.  TJ has a crush on her so when she meets Hesher who is more age-appropriate you know what happens.

He unleashes his raging uncouth self steeped in destruction and stark anger. Also featured in another turn is a meek bespectacled grocery cashier played Natalie Portman. What a difference from her luminous balletic award-winning ""Black Swan."" Piper Laurie plays the sweet and very ill coping grandmother whose demeanor reminded me of a frustrated Doris Roberts. This is so far from her early role as the murderously sanctimninous mother in ""Carrie.""

4595546,5,B0057GUGGU,"I caught this one at the local art-house theater, and really loved it. The mixed reviews here don't surprise me that much, because it is a film that is hard to get a handle on.

A couple of warnings:
The greater portion of the film is a touching, if prosaic, indie film about grieving and loss. However, all prosaicness is blown to hell with the introduction of the character Hesher, who is as about as crude and chaotic as they come. So a suburban tragedy-and-renewal storyline is punctuated by vicious stabs of stoner comedy. The odd thing is that the director and actors make it work.  It is a fair trick, if you can wrap your head around it. Just be prepared to swing between extremes in a movie that defies any easy categorization.

The second warning is that the character Hesher is crude, foul-mouthed, and blatantly offensive. If you're readily offended by gratuitous swearing, dirty talk, or dirty jokes, this character will readily offend you.

What I liked about it:
I grew up with heshers. In Southern California it's the name of a certain kind of suburban heavy metal fan, typically a stoner who listened to the harder, more violent end of the metal spectrum like Metallica, Megadeth, and Motorhead. For me, naming the character ""Hesher"" was like naming the captain of the football team ""Jock."" On the other hand, I know exactly the kind of person Hesher was modeled upon, and Gordon-Levitt nailed it. The speech, the body-language, the sense of humor, all perfectly rendered. It is a slice of life I never expected to be so lovingly and accurately depicted on film. Usually heshers are portrayed as buffoons, like the main characters of Wayne's World. Here, all the darkness and menace, as well as the humor and bonhomie, are included.

The film never looses its heart, despite callous and chaotic assaults of Hesher on the main storyline. Likewise, Hesher never looses his edge, despite the underlying sweetness of the film as a whole. From reading the other reviews, it seems that this might be too much of an internal contradiction for some. I found it a very compelling success.

The script is impressively tight and well written, and the acting is wonderfully natural. The setting is Sothern California stripped of all its glamor and pretense. It is aging tract homes and strip malls, congested boulevards and construction sites. It addresses a level of dingy suburban reality that rarely seems to make it onto film. Because this was the texture of my childhood, I loved it.

Just expect a different kind of cinema with this one, a true indie, art-house experience, and I think you'll get what this gem of a film has to offer.",1322179200,3,2645,4.774617067833698

Director, Spencer Susser, also seems to shun main stream movie making in introducing one the most interesting and offensive anti-heroes of all time.  Imposing himself on a dysfunctional family that has not been able to overcome the loss of daughter, wife and mother, Hesher (Gordon-Levitt) becomes an influential force in their journey back from the edge.  Natalie Portman has a limited but extremely well acted role as part time store cashier who does not make enough money to pay the rent, buy food and repair a seriously past its prime auto.  Many viewers may be put off by the language and some of the actions of the main character but the message at the end is clear and offers some amount of hope for a group of hopeless people.",1321401600,,876,4.781456953642384

It's easy to instantly dislike Joseph Gordan-Levitt playing said douche-bag, but of course, this the movies and life-lessons must be learned, so Hesher turns out to be an o-k guy, just with douche-y (sic) qualities.

Life is in major suck mode. Young T.J. (Brochu) and his Dad (Wilson) are in mourning. Along comes Hesher (Gordan-Levitt) an uninvited guest, who makes himself at home in their garage. Grandma (the terrific Piper Laurie) doesn't mind at all, in fact, no one seems to mind. T.J. has a crush on a check-out girl (Portman) and they form a friendship. All of these lives intertwine throughout, leading the story into humility, sadness, and redemption.

Hesher is a sweet film. Nothing Earth-shattering, by any means, but a semi-quiet (except when inside Hesher's heavy metal van) story about dealing with life. The cast does a great job with director Susser's debut film.

I know the critics gave it chilly reviews and people on here were less friendly to it than that. The only explanation is that they plain just didn't get it. It had everything. It was funny, disturbing, dramatic, and made you think. The acting was superb by all involved. And the writing while yes, quite vulgar, was not vulgar for the sake of being vulgar. It had a point to it as it helped to shape the mindset of the character Hesher, and continued to help show the intensifying frustration and grief of the family as time went on. Absolutely destined to be a cult classic. Most movies that have become a cult classics were critically shunned when they first came out, most were brushed off as being offensive or nonsense. It was only later that people would begin to understand the films, and I do believe that this is what will happen with this absolute gem of a film.

Other people have reviewed the story  so I'll just point one thing out that struck me as particularly stupid. The whole point is that the kid and family is going through tough times because the mother died. So at the funeral of the grandmother (who also dies), a drunk Hesher lectures the father and son about how they need to appreciate what they have left. He does this by comparing the fact that he lost a testicle in an accident and was feeling sorry for himself until he realized he had one good one left.

4595557,5,B0057GUGGU,"Whoa.

Just saw Hesher... Below is my spoiler-free review.

Hesher is not a movie I will ever forget... With so many cliched films vomited through my brain, I can guess most of the outcomes of scenes and rarely get surprised anymore. The first time a movie or shot does something different it's surprising to you like the first time you saw the shot of the passenger looking directly at you as a incoming car slams into us! However the second time is not so surprising because you think, `Oh yeah, saw that same shot on Lost.' Years later, the shot doesn't even faze me or spark an adrenaline jolt anywhere near the first time.

What the hell does that have to do with Hesher?

More than I could have hoped for... It has been years since I've been so surprised by a film. (he last film that surprised me on this scale was The Dark Knight. Actually there's one other film that falls into this category and that's Trollhunter.

Shut up and tell me what kind of surprises.

Gnarly stuff happen. Stuff I've never seen on screen.

Good or bad?

Both. This film has brutal parts man. But it also has some of the most hilarious/dramatic moments that had me laughing or gripping the sofa on how uncomfortable or heartbreaking some scenes were. It's not a film that will have you feeling goody all through, it likes to rope the viewer around on the emotional landscapes of the human condition, from loss, sorrow, heartbreak, love, betrayal, friendship, forgiveness, dependence, and anarchy.

Anarchy?

Lots of it. Stuff I've never thought of before. Hardcore fights. Kids too.

Cut to the chase. Is it good?

The one thing that really pains me about this film is that it could have been one of the greatest films ever.

What? So it's just okay?

No! It gets 88/100 on my scale. Very few films get past 80 and even less to 88... what I'm meant is that if they took another stab at editing it they could have made it shorter at some parts and maybe longer at other places because the pacing is difficult to swallow at places.
Editing is an artform that has the curse of never reaching perfection, only deadlines. Every single film out there can be better with more editing. I know that's a conversational statement but I have not met one seasoned editor who didn't agree.

In conclusion, Hesher is a uncomfortable film. It is also an amazing film but it undeniably feels like an acquired taste. What I mean is that it's definitely not for everyone. (Violent with children, Strong language, and nudity)

Here's my favorite quote, come back after watching it and then you'll remember why it was funny

""You know snakes are named that because of the shape of their bodies.""

4595558,1,B0057GUGGU,"You kinda get what the director was going for here -- trying to do a reverse role model story with a badass rocker dude as the role model who ultimately redeems himself despite his anti-everything behavior. Did not work at all. I rented this because of the interesting cast and some reviewer called it ""hilarious."" That reviewer was clearly under the influence of serious narcotics, because there was exactly one laugh in the entire film. And the cast is utterly wasted. Rainn Wilson spends most of the movie in a catatonic state, Natalie Portman is mousey (if you can believe that) and Joseph Gordon Leavitt is doing his best Jesus Christ impersonation, but without the winning charm. Avoid this one too. Nothing redeeming about it.",1318204800,13,733,4.872

Is it just self-aggrandizing or is our character on route to changing into someone who doesn't always see himself as first and foremost at the expense of others?

These qualities and the environment in which they thrive are clearly written, directed and portrayed in this film thus giving the viewer an easy decision about what is to become of Hesher. Is he worthy of a secular redemption or does he continue on in his own little purgatory?",1318032000,,592,4.97979797979798

4595562,3,B0057GUGGU,"The story centers around TJ after his mother has died as he and his dad attempt to get their life back to normal. TJ is a bad luck kid who is not only depressed, but bullied. Hesher, an anarchist, bullies his way into TJ's life and shows up at improbable times, almost as an imaginary alter ego. The writer attempts to shock the audience with the audacity of Hesher's acts as well as his crudeness, which I thought didn't work as well...especially the idiotic scene where he is talking about granny rapers, or his ""perverted metaphor."" The inability of the author to create audacity without constant crudeness shows a weakness.

The actors did an excellent job. There were many scenes you sit and ask yourself, in a good way, ""What just happened here?"" Or ""What the heck is he doing now?"" Life as usual falls to its least common denominator as the grief stricken family starts to imitate the anarchist ways, which seem to lack consequences in this film. Parts of the film were excellently done, while other scenes were weak. I suppose the ending of the film was supposed to make us feel good about the whole thing, but it doesn't compensate enough. Personally I think that if they toned down the crudeness of Hesher and put in Zack Garifalakis in that role the movie could have been a box office smash.

Normally I love these indie style quirky comedies, perhaps I have seen too many of them to enjoy this one to its fullest. And what the heck was Natalie Portman doing in this film?

4595565,3,B0057GUGGU,"Hesher, like its titular character, is a bombastic, pitch-black, nihilistic and more or less repugnant film...that is not to say that it is not sometimes quite enjoyable. It is very well shot but not flashy and Levitt, as always, is reliable. Rainn Wilson stretches his acting muscles slightly, donning a grizzly beard, some lethargic sweats, and making us forget all about the kooky flair of 'Dwight.' Natalie Portman is fine in a role that could have largely been played by anyone, save a scene near the end when she brings a little more personality to her character symbolically. The real star of the film however is young TJ (Devin Brochu), who is equally agitated and enamored by Hesher, a force of black-metal nature who infiltrates his life with manic jams, bi-polar explosions and enough profanity to make John Waters wince.
This film is tenaciously vulgar, Hesher streaming vile language to a desensitizing degree. He even ends once exchange by saying. ""One more thing--"" before letting loose a giant fart. Shakespeare, this is not. However, there are several moments of rare and affecting poignancy sprinkled throughout scenes of selfish, useless destruction. The burnt/smashed cars, intimidation, etc etc are all anchored by young Brochu's mourning for his dead mother. Scenes involving the mother's car ring true and are welcome respites from Hesher's non-stop barrage of, well...Hesher. Without these sequences--particularly one late in the film where we see more of the family's relationship as it existed before the loss-- Hesher would be incredibly depressing.
In fact, it is still fairly depressing.
Hesher seemingly does his personal best to ensure this.
He is a cipher, a darkness, a lack of humanity.
For much of his screen time, he leers, smokes, grunts, moves with a rank primal energy.
We can't tell if he is an anti-hero or not...usually he is just reckless, depraved, and watchable. His metaphoric soliloquies (particularly the epically humorous and gross and tragic one at the funeral) are worth the price of admission alone.
It is a departure for Levitt, that is for sure, playing a character more akin to the haunted prostitute he played in Mysterious Skin than any films he has done lately. His character is a bruiser, a fairly unlikable wretch. And yet he gets the girl, he befriends the grandma, he rescues the kid...when he feels like it. The film which has trouble containing him is an unapologetic, drab, oft-intense and malicious picture. It is full of scratches, scars, and occasional shreds of understanding. There is an unrestrained power here, if you can handle the darkness, the brooding, the concussive expletive-heavy dialogue.",1317254400,7,2669,5.152073732718894
4595566,3,B0057GUGGU,"I found this film, because it was a competitor at the Sundance Film Festival in 2010. Over the years it seems that a special kind of movies make their way to Sundance - it's like a sort of genre. One thing, which obviously really matters to the jury of Sundance is that those movies should have extraordinary characters. I would go so far to say that they all should be character-driven. ""Hesher"" makes no exception. That's the good thing about it. It really gives the actors substance to show what they can. I loved watching Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance. He really built a character, who fascinates right from the start. All this aggression, brutality, primitivsm, but also over-the-top self-confidence make me curious about the Hesher-character. The other actors/characters fulfill their role to dramatise the picture and most important they bring Hesher to ground. The comedy moments get depressed by the people around Hesher.

This movie is definitively a drama and really really depressing. Even Hesher can't change anything about it and so I think there are moments, which don't fit into this depressed enviroment. I cannot feel a unity in the story and the way it's told. The change within the plot developes too late. I was always waiting for a new direction. Some situations just somehow repeat, of course differently, but the mood kept the same and so the situations for TJ, the young boy and protagonist. In fact the movie couldn't really decide what it is. Is it a realistic drama or a tragicomedy? Even if the difference isn't so big it's crucial for my feeling while watching it. In the end the movie left just confusion for me.

The father (Rainn Wilson) is paralyzed with grief and his only parenting skill is to send his son to his room. The loving grandmother is too old and ill to intercede. The psycho drifter Hesher (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) moves into the household and his volatile, obscene behavior serves to get T.J. in trouble with the law, who are also strangely blind to this child's plight.
