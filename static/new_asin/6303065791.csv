7836362,5,6303065791,"This documentary takes you thru the process of making the ""Star Wars: A New Hope"" (the first Star wars that came out) to ""return of the Jedi"" with all of the special effects. It's mnarrated by Mark Hamil, which gives it a very nice touch indeed. There are deleted scenes, explanations of the Ewok language and just all around cool stuff.
It would be great to watch this and compare the effects with the more recent ""Star Wars"" movies, just to see how far Industrial Light and Magic has come in the intervening years.
So while you're waiting for the third ""Star Wars"" movie to come out, do some retro watching and watch this video - it's still amazing to see how things were done even tho it's probably judged as ""primitive"" now.",1038787200,10,728,4.481203007518797
