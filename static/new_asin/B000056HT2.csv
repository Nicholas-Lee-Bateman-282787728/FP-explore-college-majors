Alright.  Now to business.  I'm a run-of-the-mill pervert who loves watching these kind of movies to see how far they take it.  I watched Emmanuelle in Soho (the green cover one) once before.

  Most of the last 25% of the movie is a party filled with naked women.  It cuts to couples having sex.  One couple is a couple of lesbians.  One is a threesome with a fat man and two chicks.  And the third one, CUT!  ""Now wait, I thought this was the uncut version?"" is what you're saying, right?  In the other version it had the scene, this one however did NOT!

  In the scene it was two hot women with one guy.  At the beginning of it one of the women played with a wine bottle, including rubbing herself with it.  The guy I think had a boner and I think the simulated BJ was actually real.  It's hard to tell because the woman was blocking the view.

  When I saw the ""unrated"" version I thought maybe it would show more of everything.  Then I get it and the scene I wanted to see more of was gone completely.  This and the movie was darker than the other version.  When it comes to these kind of movies, never trust ""UNRATED"".",1124323200,13,1231,4.171673819742489
8166172,2,B000056HT2,"Look people I would have given it less if it weren't for the gobs of nudity.  There was no story at all, no plot at all no nothing except nudity.  How dare these people put this as an Emanuelle moveie!!! they should be ashamed! there was no Laura Gemser no Sylvia Kristal not even the chicks in the other ones.  It [stupid] really except for the nudity I hated it.",1023840000,20,364,4.171428571428572
