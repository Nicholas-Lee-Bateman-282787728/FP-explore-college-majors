7682704,5,B01CEWRAWM,"Great sound, great video, great concert! I've been a fan of Alan Jackson for years but have never gotten to see him perform live. This DVD is the next best thing. He performs most of his hits and then some. One of the things I like best is that the producers of this DVD have gotten it right...it's a concert, not a documentary. When I buy a live video, I want the ""concert experience"" and this is truly it. Many concert videos have backstage interview footage inserted between the songs. That stuff's okay as bonus material to be selected from a separate menu, but not within the performance. It breaks up the flow of the concert and eliminates the fantasy of being there. This DVD is pure Alan Jackson in concert and I thank the producers for the experience.",1464393600,10,760,4.474820143884892

7682706,5,B01CEWRAWM,Alan Jackson has done it again. This DVD is just awesome. I had taped the show on AXS which was only an hour. The DVD is 106 minutes of nothing but great country music. Love Alan Jackson. His Angels and Alcohol is just heaven. Every song on it is a hit. Thanks Alan for being country. Love  your singing and I believe I have a star crush !,1463356800,4,339,3.985294117647059
7682707,5,B01CEWRAWM,"Finally a concert DVD from Alan Jackson!  I've been checking on Amazon periodically for years waiting for this, and I'm happy to say the wait was worth it.  This concert is everything one could hope for from Alan Jackson.
First, you will want to know the set list.  So, here you go:
Gone Country (just the chorus)
I Don't Even Know Your Name
Livin' on Love
Good Time
Small Town Southern Man
The Blues Man
Who's Cheatin' Who
Little Bitty
Country Boy
Where Were You
Don't Rock the Jukebox
Here in the Real World (abbreviated)
Wanted (abbreviated)
Chasin' That Neon Rainbow (abbreviated)
It Must Be Love (abbreviated)
Song for the Life (abbreviated)
Pop a Top
Angels and Alcohol
You Never Know
As She's Walking Away
Remember When
It's Five O'clock Somewhere
Chattahoochee
Where I Come From
Mercury Blues

The explanation for those abbreviated songs is that he does a segment of the show where he talks about his career, getting started, getting his first hits, etc.  He sings these shortened versions of these songs to illustrate what he's been talking about.  Of course, we'd rather have the full versions, but really he can't sing ALL of hits.  There are a few songs that I might have rather heard instead of some of the songs on here, but that is always the way of concerts from singers who have had long careers.  You have the casual fans who just want the big hits, you have the diehards who want obscure album cuts.  You can't please everyone, but for this concert, I think AJ did a good job of choosing songs.  Another positive thing about this concert is how it shows off Alan Jackson's genuine nice guy personality.  He just stands up there and chats between songs in his natural country boy way--not too much talking.  I can imagine people who don't like country music not liking the music in this concert, but I can't imagine anybody not liking Alan Jackson, the friendly, humble man.  I've been enjoying his gospel concert DVD Precious Memories for years.  It's terrific that we finally have a country concert, too.  Recommended for all country music fans.",1463184000,29,2065,4.697222222222222
7682708,4,B01CEWRAWM,"This is another entertaining DVD from a country music veteran from Eagle Rock Entertainment. Last year they released one of George Straits pre-retirement concerts and this time its Alan Jacksons 25th Anniversary Tour  recorded at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado on the last night of his tour. Though it was raining on and off, the falls stood (literally) by as Jackson performed 26 numbers over 106 minutes (with songs from his 23 albums.

Its definitely a subjective opinion but I find that watching concerts where the director makes so many quick camera cuts that I get dizzy. I mean that Jackson doesnt get 5 words out of his mouth before the camera switches to the lead guitar player (at many points Jackson is just HOLDING his guitar), or the drummer.  If you are at a concert, you focus on the singer.  Because of this editing I rated this four, versus, five, stars.

Like other Eagle Rock DVD releases, there is a color booklet included. This rime it is just a 6 panel foldout with composer credits (Jackson wrote all but 3 songs here) and the on stage musicians.

But, unlike other Eagle Vision DVDs, there are no bonus features  just the concert.

The quality of the images is excellent as is the sound.

If you are an AJ fan, youll probably want this DVD

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7682709,5,B01CEWRAWM,I can't get enough of this.  My son and I took an 8 hr. road trip to his concert and this reminds me of that great time.  Great DVD!!!,1508284800,,134,3.586206896551724

7682711,5,B01CEWRAWM,"Alan Jackson brought his accomplished band to Red Rocks amphitheatre in Morrison Colorado - May 17 2015 - to  celebrate 25 years of his country hits.
The music is vibrant, and the audience was loving it in spite of cold rainy Colorado spring weather. Alan's band is always fantastic, and young Ryan Joseph on fiddle, mandolin & background vocals is one of our favorites. Watch for him - he's a real pro with talent beyond his years.
Alan is relaxed throughout and seems to enjoy the challenge of the wet May weather. His voice is better than ever - and he lets the band shine throughout the performance.
Enjoy this for the songs, the real country music, and the talent of these superb musicians. Sound quality and video are both top notch.",1506384000,3,739,4.598484848484849

7682718,3,B01CEWRAWM,"My feeling is Alan's voice was not good, either because it was the last stop on his tour, or he had a cold, it was weak in many spots. tHe outdoor venue cold and rainy also may have had something to do with it.

7682736,5,B01CEWRAWM,"This is a welcome ""Best Of"" from an artist who has held our collective interest for years now.  I do surround sound and really enjoy a ""concert"" as opposed to ""canned"" videos. The band is as solid as can be and features a couple of solo capable guitarists. The only negative is Alan's voice has gotten a little ""road weary"" from all the years of live shows. We saw him in Toledo and I noticed it then. Hey, we're all a little older! If you want a truly representative performance BUY THIS VIDEO. It's worlds better than what is passed off today as ""country"". The version of  ""Where Were You When the World Stopped Turning"" will send shivers up your spine the way it did when you first heard it (I think it was the CMA awards). As I write this I realize that Alan IS an American institution.",1481673600,6,790,4.295302013422819
7682737,3,B01CEWRAWM,"We like Alan J's. country twang singing voice.

7682759,3,B01CEWRAWM,"To start with the audio and video on this DVD was very good. However, the performance itself by Jackson was poor, at least in my opinion. He and all his band showed no ""emotion"" throughout the entire concert. In addition, I think for a 25 year reunion concert the song selection could have been better. This appeared to me as a concert that he and his band did not wanted to do and were not happy to be there.",1469059200,,409,4.189873417721519

Aside from his great music, it also shows his ability to connect with the audience and the charisma that has won him a huge fan base.  Unlike some concert videos that focus only on the main star, this gives his band air time, too, and they are singled out during songs for solos and are introduced individually by Jackson.  Some people may be mildly disappointed that a particular favorite song of theirs might not have made the playlist but it doesn't take away from the overall enjoyment of the performance.",1519516800,,610,4.62962962962963
