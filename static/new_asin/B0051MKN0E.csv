8452862,4,B0051MKN0E,"Going into this fight, I actually thought Matt Hamill had a good chance of beating Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson. After all, he did own his mentor, Tito Ortiz, and he did that at UFC 121. Filling in for Thiago Silva was filling some big shoes, not to mention taking on the biggest name he'd probably ever face in his MMA career. Was this a smart move for Hamill? That question is answered in the Main Event at UFC 130!

For the Co-Main Event you have a former champion taking on TUF 10 Winner, Roy Nelson. Frank Mir, on a quest to once again get his best back, gladly accepts. I suppose you have to wonder what each fighter is thinking. Watching past fights, it seemed to be an easy KO for ""Big Country,"" and that would be that, and he'd move up the ladder to a bigger and better challenge. For Frank Mir, I think he knew this was a challenge, and a chance to test himself against the big-bellied beast.

And wouldn't you know it? Jorge Santiago is back in the UFC to take on Marine Corps veteran and a fighter coming into his own, Brian Stann.

Is this whole entire card seriously something to grump, gripe and groan about? Is it completely a loss? In my mind? Not by a long shot. Maybe not the brightest moves by UFC brass, but they did put together 10 fights, and I'll list 'em below!

Renan Barao vs. Cole Escovedo: One of the first WEC Champions takes on a Brazilian veteran who's faced a who's who of opponents. This is the first of many great fights for one man, and a unanimous decision.

Michael McDonald vs. Chris Cariaso: If anybody saw McDonald's UFC debut against Edwin Figueroa, you know that this kid is no joke, and his FIGHT OF THE NIGHT performance was impressive. But the man known as ""Kamikaze"" is always a force to be reckoned with, and a split decision is well earned by one man!

Gleison Tibau vs. Rafaello Oliveira: They brought back ""The Tractor"" in Oliveira to take on Tibau. Both of these guys are BJJ black belts, but one of them gets bragging rights in Brazil, because they get to tell all their friends that the submitted the other man in the 2nd round!

Kendall Grove vs. Tim Boetsch: The TUF 3 Winner just might have his final chance in the octagon against a man looking for a fresh start in his Middleweight debut. One man absolutely DOMINATES the other man in a unanimous decision, and now he's soon to face the other TUF 3 Winner, Michael Bisping. On a side note, I hope Kendall Grove eventually returns to UFC action, as he always came to fight, but simply fell short one too many times. Hopefully he proves himself a force to be reckoned with, and returns to the UFC refreshed someday!

Miguel Angel Torres vs. Demetrious Johnson: There's no joke about either of these guys. But one of them wants it more with a unanimous decision.

Brian Stann vs. Jorge Santiago: Sometimes you've gotta call it like you see it, and although this was a good battle and FIGHT OF THE NIGHT, sometimes you don't choose who you come back into the octagon to take on. Santiago has submitted the likes of Jeremy Horn in his career, always a game competitor, yet his jaw is suspect at times. Brian Stann? Stopping Chris Leben before this fight? WOW! Great scrap, with a 2nd round TKO!

Thiago Alves vs. Rick Story: The winner of this fight was no surprise to me, because at this point, he was on a tear. Story's whooped a who's who, and so has Alves, but Alves isn't always as prepared as he thinks he is to simply knock the other guy out. The win is a unanimous decision. Afterwards, wouldn't you know it? He gets knocked off his horse by Charlie Brenneman, and is now looking back to win again like he used to. I hope that happens.

Stefan Struve vs. Travis Browne: Unless you've absolutely put Struve DOWN AND OUT, you won't stop him from coming after you. As far as Travis Browne goes? You'd better figure him out, or you might not win! This is a vicious 1st round KO!

Frank Mir vs. Roy Nelson: One man said he wasn't feeling the greatest for this fight. Maybe you just have to believe that, because this was a dominated fight that earned a unanimous decision.

Rampage Jackson vs. Matt Hamill: There was no finish, but you can't exactly say there was a contest either. This was a unanimous decision, followed with a title shot that didn't go his way.

Matt Hamill would retire after his next fight at UFC 133. I'm really hoping it isn't permanent, and I'm guessing that he might be back after some much needed time off. And unfortunately, Rampage isn't exactly happy with the organization these days. But overall, I was happy with this card. It isn't my favorite, not by a long shot. But I don't hate it either.",1333670400,,4627,4.415492957746479
8452863,2,B0051MKN0E,"UFC 130 was originally gonna be headlined by a rematch by Lightweight champion Frankie Edagr and Gray Maynard who fought to a draw at UFC 125 in what was a classic match, however injuries to both fighters meant a new main event was needed and so Rampage Jackson Vs. Matt Hamill was promoted to the main event, keep in mind that Jackson was originally supposed to face the dangerous Brazilian Thiago Silva, Silva would have to pull out due to a suspension for testing positive for a banned drug he took to help his rehabilitation before his fight with Brandon vera at UFC 125.

The courageous Matt Hamill who is a deaf athlete asked to step in and fight Jackson the fight is really a non event and a bit of a miss match and not entertaining in the slightest. The same could be said for the heavyweight clash between Frank Mir and Ultimate Fighter season 10 winner Roy Nelson, it's almost embarrassing to watch and not a great advert for MMA.

Elsewhere on the main card 6'11"" Stefan Struve battles 6'7"" Travis Browne in a heavyweight battle. Thiago Alves and Rick Story do provide an entertaining battle as do Brian Stann and Jorge Santiago, they go on to earn a bonus for fight of the night.

Probably the best fight of the night takes place on the Pre lims as bantamweights Migule Torres and Demetrious Johnson do battle in a back and forth encounter that sees Torres use Jiu-Jitsu against Johnston's Wrestling, this fight really is a ground clinic. As usual if you haven't seen the event you should start with the Countdown show that's on disc 2.

UFC 130 had too many fighter pull out's and reshuffling of the card for it to be anywhere near as good as the original line up would have been, it does have a few good fights but there's not enough here to recommend it.",1316390400,2,1769,4.46749226006192
8452864,3,B0051MKN0E,"I have to admit, this pay-per-view worried me.  I just couldn't help but feel that this event was going to be plagued by one boring decision after the other.  Thankfully I was wrong and the event was given more variety then I had expected.

What can I say about Brian Stann that hasn't been said so far.  The guy has looked extremely impressive and is definitely the breakout middleweight of this year.  He opens this card against Jorge Santiago, who is making his return to the UFC after several years.  With a dynamic striker against him I was really interested in seeing how Stann would take this fight and what ended up happening was a very fun fight and I definitely enjoyed watching this fight until second round knockout.

In Thiago Alves fans are typically treated to a fighter who not only puts on leg kick clinics but is a knockout artist with some memorable victories over Matt Hughes and Josh Koscheck.  Taking the challenge is Rick Story who is a powerful wrestler who has shown to be scary if he is on.  I'll admit I was really surprised by this fight.  I saw the winner as an underdog and completely blown away by the victory.  Would have loved to seen a little bit more excitement but it was pretty interesting.

Jeez, I would not have picked this out as the fight to watch in the main card but Stefan Struve and Travis Browne put on one hell of a show.  These two put on the kind of fights I love, where they leave everything in the ring and I am left desperately craving more.  Definitely the case here as the fight ends in the knockout of the night and boy what a knockout it was.

Frank Mir put on an absolutely atrocious fight against Mirko Cro Cop in his last outing.  Granted, his fights before that were pretty exciting but damn was I pissed about the UFC 119 fight.  That left me worried when it was announced that his next fight was against Roy Nelson.  Nelson is a surprisingly good fighter, which is quickly learned if you have watched over his career, despite his physical appearance.  He's got a great ground game and some lethal power in his hands.  What occurred that night was a decently entertaining fight but I definitely saw it as a test of one man's chin because he ate some serious shots.  I gained another level of respect for the loser while the victor looked very strong.

The main event is is where I was really worried in terms of how the fight would play out.  Frankie Edgar/Gray Maynard III was originally scheduled to be the main event (a fight I am waiting anxiously for) but both were injured in training so it was scrapped.  Instead we were given Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson against Matt Hamill.  I really like Hamill (it's hard not to be a fan of his) but I wasn't sure how he would deal with one of the top light heavyweights in the world.  It doesn't help that for whatever reason Rampage is really on and off in terms of excitement depending on his opponent.  Unfortunately I had guessed the pace and it kinda played out that way, not exciting however not so terrible I felt I was being punished in some way for watching.  I still don't think the victor won in such a way to be proud but that's just me.

Overall, I only see two of the fights on the main card being worth the watch but it was a decent event.",1315872000,,3259,4.367109634551495
