200730,5,1596682744,"I am so pleased with my purchase.  I am going to take a workshop with Mary Whyte and this will give me a place to start before I go to the workshop.  She is a wonderful artist, the DVD is well presented and it is always a pleasure to buy from Amazon.  C.Fahy",1346716800,3,258,3.830188679245283
200731,4,1596682744,"I learnt a lot from this DVD. Mary is a good teacher and explains everything she does and more, unlike some artists's tutorials I have seen. I am definitely inspired to attempt more portraiture now. I love her painting style, and can recommend this DVD. My only wish is that it was twice the length, with a second portrait demonstration!",1308355200,12,337,4.633333333333334
200732,5,1596682744,"Mary Whyte is a very talented artist. On this video, she shows every single step of painting this portrait, and gives a lot of tips and pointers along the way.  Her video is inspirational. I have never attempted to paint a watercolor portrait on a vertical surface -- after watching this video, I've attempted it a few times.  You really have to plan your brushstrokes much more carefully.  Mary Whyte is a master at this.",1300060800,9,422,4.6
200733,4,1596682744,Very well done video and quite fascinating to watch a pro artist at work. I only wish it had been a bit longer and a little more instruction on specific details. Interesting watercolor technique from a master watercolorist. I would recommend this video to anyone interested in watercolor technique.,1287446400,19,298,5.1020408163265305
200734,5,1596682744,This woman is such a wonderful artist. She is deeply passionate and it resonates in her art. Her paintings are powerful and compelling. She inspires me to to tap my own artistic soul in hopes of  presenting such moving work. This dvd is a window into her vision and will give any artist the tools to meet their own goals. Needless to say I highly recommend this dvd and suggest reading her books too. They are full of insightful tips and inspiring perceptions.,1287187200,11,460,4.542168674698795

200738,5,1596682744,"This served as a good introduction to using watercolor.  I would have liked to see a demonstration of ""dry brush"" for details, but that will have to happen in a later episode.",1408665600,,175,4.46875
200739,5,1596682744,"Mary Whyte is a master painter and I loved watching her bold technique in this watercolor portrait demonstration.

200740,1,1596682744,"Extremely disappointed with this purchase, as the dvd is faulty and simply doesn't work. I had a tech person test it on various machines but it was useless. I was unable to return it, as the dvd was ordered to an address in the USA and then carried back to my country a month later. By the time i checked it, along with a dozen other dvds, it was too late, and it was too expensive to return. So i have the dvd, but it simply doesn't work. I'd be happy if the seller could deliver a fresh one. Im pretty sure with Mary Whyte, it must be amazing. :(",1405296000,,548,3.9909090909090907

200742,4,1596682744,Mary Whyte demonstrates her techniques for watercolor in a very clear and instructive manner.  Worthwhile purchase for the beginning or intermediate watercolorist..,1388275200,,164,6.454545454545454

7799703,3,1596682744,"I didn't think this video was worth the price, although I love her work.  The problem I had was that it was really just a quick sketch like painting and the instruction that went with it wasn't very clear, nor was the video.  At one point in the video the second eye miraculously appears painted with no indication of how that happened.  The use of colors and how she mixed was especially confusing.  I find her books to be much easier to follow.",1519084800,,446,4.337349397590361
7799704,5,1596682744,"Love this video, wish it wasn't just a painting sketch though but I do like the freshness and quicker painting than portraits that look like a photo.  Whyte is very talented and so are her books.",1515715200,,195,4.416666666666667
