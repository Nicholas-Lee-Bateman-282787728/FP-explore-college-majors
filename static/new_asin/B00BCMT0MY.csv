8566125,5,B00BCMT0MY,"A good story, taking place in a number of countries with multiple flashbacks. Some may find it challenging that way, but it is well done.",1398297600,,137,4.52
8566126,3,B00BCMT0MY,"Ida (Tuva Novotny), wakes up in a river in France. She has head injury, amnesia, stitches on her side, and a duffel bag full of money. Oh yes, a local politician has just been killed too. Ida speaks and thinks in French, but the locals claim her accent is not French. Sounds like a fairy decent Bourne mystery.

The second half hour she discovers who she is, her husband (Flemming Enevold), and siblings. It seems there are a couple of bad guys after her.

After an hour her memory comes back all at once and the rest of the film ties everything together.

A good mystery eases out clues so the audience can solve the mystery before it is revealed. This one gives you clues as she attempts to find out who she is, but the story is so disjointed, it only adds to the mystery. There is no partial memory recovery feeding us tidbits of clues, it comes all at once.

The film is in 3 languages with English subscripts. Ida, as the main character grew boring as the film progressed. For those who like a complex mystery, this is certainly one of them, but I just didn't find it as entertaining as the hype.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1387065600,2,1144,4.352112676056338
