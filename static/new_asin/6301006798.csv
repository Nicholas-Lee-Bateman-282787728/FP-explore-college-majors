304298,2,6301006798,"i consider ""less than zero"" unfilmable in the sense that the novel was so emotionally powerful/well written for me that no film could live up to it.  however, i did have actually a lot of hope for this film.  i wanted to enjoy it.  but what we have here is an excercise in pointlessness, more bumbiling than one can even imagine.  i guess the film's purpose is to show:
A. the powers of drug addiction on people
B. the emptiness of our culture.
but what i actually got out of this was:
A. the powers of drug addiction as portrayed through horrible diolouge
B. the emptiness of our culture through monotinous scenes
but all is not lost.  Robert Downey Jr.'s performance is actually quite good, however most of the rest of the film is, as i said previously, monotinous and bumbiling.",989020800,,781,4.51063829787234
304299,4,6301006798,"For the record, I haven't read the book.  However, I saw this movie in the theaters back in the day, saw it again on video, and would likely purchase it were it made available on DVD.
During the Eighties, we saw the Brat Pack rotated in and out of The Breakfast Club, Some Kind of Wonderful, Pretty in Pink, and Less Than Zero.  The latter was one of the darkest of the time, and marked something of a departure from the happy, or at least bittersweet, endings of the trials and tribulations of young adults on the cusp of transitions.  Less Than Zero, despite its shortcomings, has a certain amount of value for that alone; if one is collecting the spectrum of movies from this particular cluster of performers, Less Than Zero is a must-have for the bleak end.
Spader and McCarthy turn in solid performances, Gertz is a forgettable weak link, but Downey was the real standout.  Critics of the film version who complain that the focus of the movie shifted heavily to Julian as opposed to the character focus in the novel . . . perhaps it's just because Downey was a talent not to be wasted.  I have no idea if it was a true situation in his life at the time or not, but the performance is powerful regardless, and especially poignant in hindsight.
Perhaps the book is better, I haven't made the comparison, but . . . in a way, that seems such a pat comment to make.  Books frequently have the perception of being better than the subsequent movies simply because the movies never match our mind's eye vision of the characters and places.  For my money, if for Downey's performance alone, it is worth watching and is a necessary component of any Eighties genre completist's collection.",985564800,,1683,4.534653465346534

304301,1,6301006798,"It's unfortunate that I can't give this film ""less than 1"" star. I remember seeing it in 1987 when it came out and was furious that I shelled out money to see this mess. I thought that a viewing on video 12 years later might help me appreciate it but it didn't. The problems begin with a warped, unrealistic look at ""life in the fast lane"" 80's style and continue with insipid performances by Andrew McCarthy and (especially) Jami Gertz (what happened to her anyway ???). Most of the publicity surrounded Robert Downey Jr's performance, which for a time was considered brilliant. Now we know he was merely playing himself, which makes his character Julian all the more pathetic. Only James Spader, as Rip (and where did that name come from??)is suitably effective..although he looks far too young for the part.",977184000,3,810,4.75177304964539
304302,4,6301006798,"I haven't yet read the novel, but I have heard of all the lashings both critics and Bret Easton Ellis alike have thrown at the film version of ""Less Than Zero.""  It's nothing new when Hollywood takes liberties with a good book (Kubrick's hack-job with ""The Shining"" is an ideal example), and very rarely do adaptations hit the screen flawlessly.
Well, that being said, I must say that ""Less Than Zero"" is one of my favorite movies at the moment, not because of its commitment to the source material but as an affecting tale of addiction among the jaded and ruined of the L.A. club scene circa 1987.  Clay (Andrew McCarthy) returns home for Christmas to see his friends Blair and Julian (Jami Gertz & Downey, Jr.) and finds them immersed in the ruins of drugged-out living.  The movie is basically his attempts to tag after and save Julian from himself before he--duh--gets in too deep.
The recent troubles in Robert Downey Jr.'s personal life make his portrayal of the drugged-out Julian all the more resonant and convincing.  ""Less Than Zero"" is really his movie, and he shines in spite of the grunge his character is pulled through.  Andrew McCarthy is well-cast as the heroic, boyishly handsome Clay.  Jami Gertz does well, but her appeal as a sex symbol must have lived and died in the 1980s: she shows capable acting ability, but it's hard to watch her monstrous facial expressions.  In a supporting role, James Spader is typically excellent as a sleazy drug dealer.
Some have said the film is hollow and lacks the spirit of Ellis' novel, but I'm not in a position to say.  Judging ""Less Than Zero"" only by the movie alone, I would have to reply with nothing but enthusiasm.  It's a drama that doesn't manipulatively pull at the viewer's heartstrings with cliche, but instead is honest about its subject and as a result, more genuine.",972864000,36,1839,4.70404984423676
304303,1,6301006798,"I had just completed the novel of the same name when I decided to rent the video of ""Less Than Zero"" to basically see the novel come to life.  This was something which I eagerly anticipated since I thoroughly  enjoyed the book.  I was sadly disappointed.  The film is a very sanitized  version of the book.  While the film does feature a plotline which is a bit  similar to that of the novel (drug dealing, rich kids in L.A., 80's excess)  the majority of the story in the film has nothing to do with the novel, and  much of the character attributes are lost in translation to the screenplay.  For example, the main character, Clay (Andrew McCarthy)is a highly strung  out junkie in the novel, while in the film he is a clean kid who preaches  to his friends about the dangers of drugs.  The film seems to focus more  on the problems with Julian (Robert Downey, Jr.) than on anything else,  while the book's plot revolved around Clay.  Many of the other, more  interesting secondary characters are barely touched on in the film, making  it lack depth.  Lost in the transition to the screenplay are some of the  book's greatest lines such as ""Get Lost Here"" and ""I want to  go back.  Where?  I don't know where, just back.""  The film does seem  to have one or two good things going for it:  the portrayal of drug dealer  Rip by James Spader and the soundtrack...but that's about it.  If you  haven't read the book, you may want to try the film, but if you've read the  book, skip the film.  However, I recommend skipping the film altogether and  just reading the book instead.",961545600,9,1575,4.436619718309859
304304,3,6301006798,"This could have been an excellent movie, and perhaps if you haven't read the book it is.  However, I read the book and expected a certain depth out of the characters and got nothing.  This doesn't even follow the same plot  as the book, if anything is a very, very loosely based adaptation of the  book.  I really can't understand why the writers changed it so much.  The  book does have a plot, and is more focused on the character of Clay than  that of Julian.  If anything, Julian is a sideshow in the book, yet he is  in nearly every scene of the movie.  The friendship between Blair, Clay,  and Julian is highly embellished in this movie, wasn't such a focal point  in the book.  I am really disappointed, because there were so many good  lines in the book (People are afraid to merge on the freeways in Los  Angeles, for one) that should have made it to the screen.  I'd recommend  the book over the movie.  Despite that, Andrew McCarthy and Robert Downey  Jr. give outstanding performances.

304305,5,6301006798,"I could not believe the reflection which this movie cast upon the eighties generation of the youthful wealthy.

304398,3,6301006798,"A bout of nostalgia for the '80s led me to this Bret Easton Ellis adaptation about a college student named Clay (Andrew McCarthy) who returns home to L.A. for Christmas.  He discovers that his two best friends, Blair (Jami Gertz) and Julian (Robert Downey Jr.), have succumbed to cocaine addictions.  Blair's is more casual, but Julian's is so out of control that he has become a slave to his pusher, played with typical snake-like deviancy by James Spader.  McCarthy gives an able performance as the most straight arrow, loyal member of the trio while Downey towers over everyone in his convincing - and disturbing in how true to life it is - portrayal of a junkie.  I haven't read Ellis's novel, which is apparently more lurid and edgy than this adaptation suggests, but I still found its takes on friendship, the seductiveness of L.A.'s nightlife and its portrayals of drug dealers as marionettes to their addicts to be memorable.  All the same, when compared to better movies about drug addiction from this era, this one falls short.  Drugstore Cowboy, for instance, makes it resemble a glorified after-school special.",1492732800,,1122,4.941489361702128

But the movie has a good message of loyalty and bonds between friends that carry weight throughout the years. Saving a friend with an addiction that betrayed you and with your girlfriend of all people whom is antagonizing you to help save addicted friend is as twisted as almost any movie plot can get.

304490,5,6301006798,"""Less Than Zero"" is an underrated film that could very well have been an addition to ""Twin Peaks"" or an early piece of David Lynch.  Each frame smacks of an innocence slowly defiled in a way that angles itself around the actors perfectly.

Robert Downey Jr. plays Julian Wells, a hopeless fiend who is preyed upon with finesse by a posh, upscale drugdealer Rip (a very ominous James Spader).  Jamie Gertz, really just an okay actress, does a better than average job as Blair, the female in this strange psychic threesome.  Andrew McCarthy introduces Order and Morality as Clay, a virtuous character who comes home to set his friend straight, or at least try.

The relationship between all these characters is one of a kind of passive manipulation: Rip is the one who tips the dominoes in favor of an early destruction, a predatory monster who pollutes the parties of the youthful and promising with cocaine.  A bird of prey, he stalks Julian (who owes him 50,000 dollars in drug money) and uses him to manipulate and enhance his own emptiness.

Everyone is using everyone else in this movie: the fantastique hues and colors Marek Kanievska uses lends the movie an almost European feel.  No one can really help Julian because everyone in the movie has some investment in him personally or otherwise, and Julian is so often full of sh*t himself.  Robert Downey Jr's performance is perfect.",1464652800,,1387,4.794117647058823

Just when I was getting ready to excuse myself from the living room, the movie continued to be so corny that I couldn't tear myself away. James and Robert aren't bad, but the rest of the cast is terrrrible. Top that off with a script that is laughable almost constantly, music that is way too literal, and you've got yourself the perfect movie for one of those nights that you just wanna watch something bad. This definitely hasn't stood the test of time, but I can't imagine watching this in the 80s and thinking it was any better.

I guess for every ""Pretty in Pink"" there's ten ""Less Than Zero's"" - and while the 80s isn't know for movies that have stood the test of time, this one is certain to among the worst offenders.",1458604800,,1048,4.463541666666667

Robert Downey Jr.'s  performance was so eerily real that  you felt  as though you were right there experiencing it with him.  His character was so likeable you  just wanted to take care of him. It was heart wrenching to watch him slowly slip away. His parents lacked the communication skills needed to help their son. His friends desperately try to help him to no avail. The music by Thomas Newton that played throughout the movie was hauntingly beautiful and just added to the emotions you experience.  Downey  deserved an academy award for his performance.  I must warn you,  this movie is very sad from beginning to end.  However, it is worth watching just for you to experience how Downey's performance  will have a profound effect on you.

This story is well written and executed by a stellar cast of stars including a young Robert Downey Jnr, Andrew McCarthey, Jamie Gertz and James Spader. Although the movie is not based on a true story, it's an all to common theme - rich kid gets mixed up in partying and drugs - even after seeing him graduating from school and seemingly having the world at his feet. The relationships between the three main characters Julian (Downey Jnr) and his best friends Clay (McCarthey) & Blair (Gertz) is the main story arc however what gives this story it's kick is the supporting roles of Julian & Clay's family - who we see go through the full range of family conflicts & emotions.

304787,3,6301006798,"Slick, glib, well-photographed but ultimately toothless and vapid, Less Than Zero attempts to duplicate the numbed-out, drugged-out ennui of Bret Easton Ellis's best-selling first novel. Blair (main vice: cocaine), Julian (crack), and Clay (college) are over-privileged children of divorce in 1980s Beverly Hills, a generation that supposedly was forced to mature too fast, its innocence lost very early. But the film never makes the audience feel a damn thing for them, because the script never allows them to articulate anything. The most amusing thing about this movie is that it would have you believe that people in L.A. drive to find one another across town, taking hours out of their lives to say, ""Uh, how are you doing?"" ""Oh ... you know."" ""Oh. Um ... well, I gotta go. See ya."" Scintillating.

I really hated this movie when I first saw it back in 1987. It had none of the satirical bite of Ellis's book, and turned Beverly Hills into a Vogue-magazine version of the city. Nowadays, it's easier to enjoy the movie as a paradigm of high-gloss '80s style over substance, with the added bonus of having Rick Rubin supplying a soundtrack of his metal and rap productions. But ultimately it seems that the essence of the book simply eluded the filmmakers, and without that, they struggled to find anything compelling to replace it with.",1403568000,,1341,4.933628318584071

Performances by other actors are adequate but nothing really mentionable.  The story is involving in a ""peek into how the other half lives"" kind of way but can be quite depressing.

My god, after seeing what he was doing to himself throughout the whole film and then ended up doing the same thing in my adult years. I'm GLAD I forced myself to go to rehab! The story was well written, the acting was stellar for all three actors, the suspense lead to a climactic ending, and the disgusting horror that portrays what happens when you start using narcotics is so realistic, it's sad. The acting was so good, I seriously thought he was actually ON DRUGS while watching the film. NO JOKE. (Maybe he was). He's had his share of using drugs and alcohol in the past, but I honestly believe he must have been on something while acting for this five star film: not to mention he's a really good actor. He did just about everything just to get some crack, cocaine, meth and more! (Having sex with other men, orally and anally) foaming at the mouth, barfing, going into seizures and being fully naked a few or all the time, and running around lost and confused was just the tip of the ice berg! All I can say about this movie is, if you haven't seen it: WATCH IT. Let this movie be a lesson for teenagers AND adults! Not to be shown for young children though! Once you've seen it, you'll NEVER forget it. If you can get your hands on this baby, KEEP IT. It's worth a fortune.",1392595200,,1363,4.2664092664092665

304866,5,6301006798,"Let's get one thing out in the open right off the bat: A good majority of people put this film down and contribute it to a typical ""1980's film."" To me, that's just total nonsense! This film, with stunning performances by Robert Downey, Jr., Jami Gertz, Andrew McCarthy and James Spader make this an absolute classic! Whilst the three main characters (Julian, Blair and Clay) may be ""spoiled rich kids"") their lives are anything but perfect. Watch as Blair wishes her father a Merry Christmas through a closed bedroom door - while he's banging his latest girl - or as Julian's father threatens to call the cops on him for entering his own home.

Some might say that this film wasn't a stretch for Downey, Jr., because he was a severe drug addict at the time, but his performance in this film is startling! It is realistic and very depressing! This is not a ""happy"" movie; it is quite the opposite and not easy to watch. But if you can get past the dour nature of the subject matter, this is a must see film!

Not only is the film great, but you also get some great music, namely, Jimi Hendrix, David Lee Roth and The Doors. Plus, The Bangles turn in a great rendition of ""A Hazy Shade Of Winter"" and... you get the late, great Roy Orbison with his incredible version of ""Life Fades Away"" at the end of the movie. As far as music in a film, I don't believe that anyone could ask for anything more!

This movie is a dire look into the world of drugs and the price that one pays when entering that world. It is sad, depressing and quite sobering. But... it is also a GREAT film! I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great movie with great music and a story that has something very tangible to tell.

Less Than Zero is a classic movie... with great performances by the four main characters (as mentioned above). If you're in doubt as to whether or not you should purchase this, my suggestion is to get it! You won't be disappointed.",1391904000,,1945,4.3646408839779

Less than Zero (1987) ***1/2 /  4
D: Marek Kanievska
C: Andrew McCarthy, Jami Gertz, Robert Downey, Jr., James Spader, Nicholas Pryor, Tony Bill, Brad Pitt
P: Ivy league college student (McCarthy) returns home for Christmas only to find that his friends lives have spiraled out of control and that they are both addicted to cocaine.

Imagine living in LA in the 80's. The mansions looked like something straight out of Architectural Digest. Everyone was good looking, had their hair done just right and always wore the latest fashions. They drove expensive cars. They either went to glamorous dinner parties or to clubs that looked like something straight out of an MTV video. As directed by Marek Kanievska and photographed by Ed Lachman, these fast track lifestyles that LA's teenagers lived were completely and utterly superficial.

In order to cover up the superficiality of their lives, some of them resorted to cocaine use. Enter Robert Downey Jr.'s character, a recent high school grad who has manged to hit rock bottom in less than a year. Downey's descent into hell and his attempts to get clean are some of the most harrowing scenes of drug addiction ever committed to screen. Downey is stuck in this troubling predicament, but yet he can't quite manage to escape this fast track LA lifestyle that is making it all the worse.

No other film, of its time, has been so self aware of these drug induced, superficial lifestyles of LA's rich and bored and has so vividly captured that on screen.",1385164800,,1581,4.906367041198502

because i love the actors in it overall.and i love the entire movie!

simply a great movie. Not a cheesy old movie at all IMO.
Glad most online forums they love it as i see why. The way clay was going to bail him out of a huge debt what like thousands of $$$ without any regret just to ""save some 1 he truly do love""i cry at that part,by the pool.such a GREAT acting scene.

INCREDIBLY HEARTBREAKING AND SAD TO SAY.FIVE STARS EASY.

in the infamous words of JULIAN poor guy,""whose going to take care of you guys when i am gone?"" aw. when i see this scene and they were really helping him so much at this point,i was crying because i just was hoping julian will be OK in the end.

Now,i have not read the book,i do not want to.i hear was not all that.
and i prefer the ON-SCREEN honestly i love it. and i love how CLEAN straight lace
Cute Clay was! PERFECT IDEAL guy. He say to his""tru lov""who he came back for he tell her""I love you i really do but i will not go DOWN like that""or something to this effect i love this movie,and the 2 of them DRIVE Off after literally arguing in the Bridge of all places,lol Clay red car was so cool in he movie,and so fittin
for clay,then at the end just gets to me each time which i will not tell here.but so sad.

another highlight for me is the two of them""CLEANING A VERY SICK DRUG UP""julian.
wow.so tragic,and sad.really was. and CLAY the first time""see""visibly what the drug and all has been doing to julian for which we know Jami Gertz character has been ""used to seeing""so sad. i turn away during this scene just was so sad.

funny scene:
when James Spader, whose name is typical 80s hollywood type name for a kid like that in80s~ lol richy kid who go by simply Ripp or RIP lol when the club scene when they are all lookin for julian and rip goes,um oh my god,
this is like a [...] game show!
""everybody is askin'where's julian!""lol so funny he is a crack up,but yet so mean what he was making poor 'defenseless/drug up/no life/julian weak self do for the DEBT he owe to Rip""the thousands he owe rip,that was sad.but i love this movie...

""What RIP (james spader)the dealer richy type stuck up troublesome dealer make julian do for him to PAY off the debt was omg beyond sleazy!"" yet we know
in real life things like JULIAN character go on and i wish it did not very tragic/sad.

i do not know why i watch it each and almost EVERY time i catch it on t.v.cable.
then i order mi dvd classic copy of it and mi amigos. and us always say um,

OK like why are we watching this incredibly good but yet very sad movie,

the ending is SO TRAGIC,and i guess we just are HUGE fans of this 1 of a kind,

Handsome AMAZING 80s,and beyond talent of huge capacity robert downey jr.

i also had no clue handsome boyish (Even now in his mid forties)or early forties,

i had no idea clay portrayer 1 of my faves andrew mccarthy is from near me,from westfield new jersey as one of my closest friends who live there for 15 years here family live blocks away from his family! had no clue about this.
 tall pretty dark hair with curls jamie gertz i believe actin'fell short.
 not great but the end she was awesome very realistic.

sad movie but what a great 80s classic,that still has most importantly
 a STRONG message at the end,IMO anyhow.and throughout.sad though.

i love james spader always sleazy funny mean in his roles like this lol

 but very realistic.goes to show all of you here whose WEAK,the strong truly do only survive in life,prosper,move onto such happy lives/greatness,always keep GOD first,be around people who can always UPLIFT you,and truly do love you for you.

When julian REALIZE just who TRULY love him,as real life it was way too late.
so TRAGIC,at the end.so sad.but i love less than zero can watch it,
 and cry to it forever. Had a few laughs during some scenes,actin'fell flat
at some scenes mostly when JAMI GERTZ WAS SPEAKING lol but i love her still.
and i cry at the ending each time. Nevertheless i will forever be a fan of
this GREAT TRUE TO LIFE MOVIE.
Forever a fan of the 2 great actors in it the character of clay and julian

Hack director Marek Kanievska did not read Less Than Zero.  No surprise there.  But what you probably didn't know is that he is also a scatophiliac.  Kanievska took the entire tone of the book and defecated on it.  Then he placed a bunch of flags that said ""Hollywood"" and ""Just Say No"" all over the steaming mound.  And these flagpoles, smeared with Kanievska's feces, penetrated the bloodstream of the story and spread all sorts of disease-causing bacteria that ate away at the very flesh of its characters until Less Than Zero the movie died a slow and painful death.  Kanievska laughed with great joy at his latest scatological achievement, summoning a chorus line of turd angels to sing hymns of wasteful glory in his honor.

When asked why he didn't just release his 98-minute, pile of dung after-school-special with a title that didn't set a new standard for injustices done to great works of fiction, he replied, ""Well, then I wouldn't get to [shih tzu] on anything.""",1260230400,3,998,4.795321637426901
305074,2,6301006798,"What can I say about this uninspired ""retelling"" of Bret's first novel?

The film adaptation doesn't contain the scenes and the tone I thought made the book so haunting and memorable.(The dead boy in the alley scene, the snuff film with the underage girl...) This film really can't be claimed that it is based on the book - it's more that it's inspired by the novel. Despite this downfall, the film is worth watching for any Bret Easton Ellis fan - if only to satisfy one's curiosity.

The film contains neither the perfectly depressing one-liners or the delightfully disturbing minor characters that make the book so interesting and engaging (Clay's sisters, Spin) The film made it seem as though Julian was the protagonist, while I always felt the novel was all about seeing the events unfold through Clay's eyes. One of the more endearing parts of the novel are Clay's  'flashbacks' of a better time, before he left for school. The film only touches on this in the beginning, and the flashback is about Blair, not about his parents, who which were the subjects of the flashbacks I found the most interesting. The lunch scene between Clay and his father is pure genius. The detachment between the father and son made me physically cringe. This scene is not included in the film at all.

The unfortunate thing about adapting films from books is that something is almost always lost in the 'translation'. 'American Psycho' is really the only one of the films adapted from his books that I feel captures the tone of the book while simultaneously compacting it into a watchable narrative without losing Bret's style, and this is due to the fact that Bateman himself is the narrator.

All and all, 'Less Than Zero' isn't a bad film, really. Just a bad adaptation. It captures what was both awesome and forgettable about 80s popular film, and fits the bill of any entertaining teen drama from that era (Including extravagant cocaine use by minors, too much New Wave, the once-hot but potential future star of Where Are They Now? James Spader). There are some touching moments, but it seems as though the film tried to hard find a conclusion the book didn't (and had a reason for not doing). After all, Julian doesn't die in the novel, and Blair certainly doesn't go back to Camden with Clay (Morrissey wouldn't be proud).

What's so melancholy about the novel is what the film failed to allude too: how upset, apathetic, nd lost Clay is now that he has changed and gained a new perspective, while his friends, sadly, have not.

And one serious complaint: Where is the Disappear Here billboard? It's integral to the imagery of the novel, and is absent in the film (unless I missed it.)

All and all: If you're a fan of Bret's books, give this film a shot. It's worth watching once, but don't be upset if it hardly even attempts to capture the mood or purpose of the novel.",1248912000,8,2867,4.674603174603175
305075,4,6301006798,"Marshall Fine's idiotic and pointless review notwithstanding, this is one of the great sleeper films of the 1980's. It was lost in the theaters but later developed a HUGE following after the VHS was released. Many of my fellow amazonians have made cogent and reflective comments on the film so I won't go into plot , writing, etc. I will say, that the only REAL reason that critics panned the film was because they felt the degradation didn't go far enough. This is ironic in that the studio decided to tone down the novel for the screenplay for fear the graphic degradation of the novel would be too much!!!!. Go figure.

I say, enjoy the movie. Robert Downey Jr. is at the top of his form as is James Spader.

They went to school together, grew up together and remained attached to each other during those years.  Regardless of the fact that they all have rich parents and live in posh California homes; all three of them are lonely, unhappy and emotionally damaged in some way.  Their mutual love for each other seems to heal some of those emotional wounds.

I do not want to retell the plot of the film, but it is wonderful and touching.  It is a story of the ethernal and true freindship that are so rare they happen only once in a lifetime.

305123,3,6301006798,"""Less Than Zero"" must be in the running for the movie that least resembles its source material, in this case Bret Easton Ellis' 1985 novel of the same name. In this 1987 film, Clay (Andrew McCarthy) returns to his native Los Angeles for Christmas break his freshman year of college. He hopes to rekindle his relationship with girlfriend Blaire (Jami Gertz), who had taken up with his best friend Julian (Robert Downey, Jr.) in Clay's absence. He's disappointed to find Blaire strung out on cocaine and annoyed by her insistence that Julian is in some kind of trouble and needs his help. Julian's business failures have left him deep in debt to a drug dealer (James Spader) and wasted all the time.

There probably isn't much point in comparing ""Less Than Zero"", the movie, with the book. They have little more than the characters' names in common, but Ellis' novel does strike me as a strange source for an anti-drug movie. The tone of the movie is wired for the MTV generation, in contrast to the book's droning, indifferent narration and aimless characters. Nosebleed Clay has been replaced with a goody-two-shoes, in love with Blaire, concerned about doing the right thing, who won't touch cocaine! This is a conventional drama about friends trying to save one another from the abyss of drug dependency and its concomitant evils. The film is a humorless converse of the book in most respects.

Judging the movie on its own merits, I like the cast, although Andrew McCarthy is conspicuously too old to play 18. I also like the theme song, The Bangles' remake of Simon & Garfunkel's ""Hazy Shade of Winter"", which plays in its entirety over the sequence of Clay's return to L.A. That song captures the 1980s better than the rest of the movie. The trouble is that this film is a very straightforward, one-note, anti-drug message, and that's all it is. Drugs will ruin your relationships, plunge you into the depths of despair, and probably kill you. It's surprisingly talky, and the dialogue clanks. Clay tries to save a couple of friends from their vices between semesters. Not horrible, but not noteworthy either.

305124,4,6301006798,"It is not quite the compliment it may sound to say that Robert Downey Jr. steals every scene in LESS THAN ZERO (even the ones he's not in). His co-stars in this botched film version of the infamous Bret Easton Ellis novel are Andrew McCarthy and Jami Gertz, both of whom so completely embody their characters' blankness that they leave two voids at the center of the story. Downey could mistakenly be judged to have walked off with the acting honors by default, the easiest victory since Theresa Russell (in a very similar role) wrested THE RAZOR'S EDGE away from Bill Murray and Catherine Hicks. This, however, would be to severely underrate Downey's careful recreation of a life out of control. An accident waiting to happen, Downey's Julian roars with the painful last gasp of a party boy for whom time is running out. Lying upside down in McCarthy's red convertible, singing screwed-up Christmas carols as they cruise L.A. after dark, Downey portrays the side of drug use that the ""Just Say No"" folks most dread: It's fun to be high (that is, until it's not). Despite the screenplay's watered-down insistence that Downey and McCarthy are competing for the favors of Gertz's character, Downey instead slyly plays his part like it's torn from the scorched pages of the novel, where the two boys are lovers, not just friends. It's a bold choice that brings his character to vivid life: In addition to all the other emotional ravages he evokes, he shows us with his panicky, sad eyes that he knows he's losing McCarthy to Gertz. Not that all of this aspect of his character is in the subtext; to pay his debts off to his dealer Rip (James Spader), Julian acts as a prostitute for Rip's other male clients.

In his absurdly cheerful holiday shirt, the incorrigible Julian offers us the flip side of those too-neat TV movie plots about parents practicing ""tough love"" on their addict children; seen here from the helplessly self-destructive kid's point of view, the familiar tale is unbearably painful to watch. But Downey's energetic charisma keeps us from looking away, even when he takes us into the horror show of what it looks like when Julian overdoses. Downey makes us care how Julian, cut off by his family and hunted by his creditors, lives before he dies.

In the film's most resonant image, the sweating, shell-shocked Julian is feeling so like a cornered animal that even the reflections off a swimming pool take on the appearance of bars that entrap him. He won't, can't, go inside to a Christmas party: ""I feel like Tiny f---in' Tim,"" he says, so despondent that it's clear he knows no help will come, although he never stops lying outwardly. ""It's not going to happen again, this; it's over,"" he'll tell anyone who'll listen, and Downey gives just the right hollow cadence to this automatic lie that fools no one. ""I'm gonna probably go back into rehab."" Downey conveys the physical hysteria of the hopeless addict with equal finesse. Long after the movie is over, one is haunted by the scene of Downey alone (his pals are doing Christmas dinner with their dysfunctional families), doing a lonely little soft-shoe routine. Simple, understated, unforgettable. It is a sublime moment.

It has been said that Downey's take on Julian was probably a case of life imitaing art. Perhaps. . . But that only makes the performance much more astonishing. Plenty of Hollywood's elite have tried their hands at the same type of role and come up wanting, even though they too were ""living the role in real life."" (Patty Duke in VALLEY OF THE DOLLS anyone?)",1209600000,6,3555,4.786644951140065
305155,2,6301006798,"If I had never read Bret Easton Ellis' masterful novel from which this movie was spawned I may have actually enjoyed it for what it was, not what it was attempting to be.  The fact that `Less than Zero' happens to be one of my all time favorite novels made me so excited to dig up this film and give it a watch.  What I experienced though was pure shock, not in how good it was but in how unfaithful it was to the novel that inspired it.  The film is cleaned up and reformatted to such a degree that you lose the entire feeling and meaning behind the novel.  They didn't just alter an ending or add a subplot but they drastically changed the characters, their actions, their problems, their motives, their home life, their relationships.  Nothing is the same; except the names.

So, I'll say that apart from the novel `Less than Zero' is a decent film with a promising prose.  On holiday from college, Clay Easton returns to LA to visit his family and friends; including his ex-girlfriend Blair.  Upon returning home, Clay uncovers that his former best friend Julian has a dangerous substance abuse problem and is in far too deep with local dealer Rip.  Clay and Blair decide to help their friend overcome this problem before it is too late.

Like I said; the prose is promising...but it is not comparable to the novel.

If you consider these spoilers I apologize, but I feel that if I don't at least point out the differences between this film and the novel than I am doing the reader a disservice.  Within the novel `everyone' has a substance abuse problem.  Julian is Clay's old dealer and while Julian does have more problems than he can bear up under, Clay could care less.  In fact, Clay just wants money and drugs for himself.  The point of Ellis' novel was to show the deterioration of teenage society in the 80's.  Kanievska's film adaptation sugarcoats everything to such a degree that you lose the purpose of the story.  I guess you can't really blame Kanievska as much as Harley Peyton who penned the screenplay.

I know that when this film was made there was a different standard as far as what was acceptable to contain within a film, and so that was most likely the reason that some of the most memorable (albeit disturbing) moments of the novel were not included in the film; which is a shame because it was in those moments that the novel came to life in all its apathetic glory.  I can only imagine how masterfully this novel could be adapted, say in the hands of Darren Aronofsky.

One thing that this film did though was give Robert Downey Jr. a canvas to paint his talent upon.  As the conflicted Julian Wells, Downey soars above the rest of the cast.  His performance is mature and natural (maybe his own substance abuse problems - which rumor has it sprung up around this time - may have had something to do with his spot-on portrayal).  James Spader also comes through with a magnetic and commanding performance as the ruthless Rip.  Anthony McCarthy is boring to me; not what Clay should have been.  Jami Gertz does a decent job as Blair, but she is not the greatest of actresses and is not very memorable.  Downey Jr. and Spader easily wipe the floor with everyone else attached to this film.

In the end I can't recommend this film because it goes against my better judgment.  I know that a lot of people enjoyed this film; but I can only ascertain that they have not read the novel.  If they had then they would equally be disappointed at the missed opportunity for greatness.  `Less than Zero' is a decent film, but it is not the film it was supposed to be.  It is so far from what Ellis' original vision was that it does not deserve to carry the title.  If they had called this movie something else; anything else; then I could have added another star.  To stake a claim as something, and then prove to be everything but, is just wrong.",1208476800,,3866,4.461538461538462
305156,5,6301006798,"""Less Than Zero"" is one of the seminal films of its era. Director Marek Kanievska and cinematographer Ed Lachman created a masterpiece of form and style, unlike any other film in the 1980s. ""Less Than Zero"" visual style was the first to blend the high style glossy fashion ad look of Los Angeles and Palm Springs with the first MTV generation energy of music videos.

For example, one of the establishing scenes of the movie is the intro credits with Clay, portrayed by Andrew McCarthy in his finest role, arriving home to sunny L.A during Christmas Vacation. A yellow filter is placed over the lens so that L.A. glows. There is no dialog, but only the booming singing of The Bangles' rock cover of Simon & Garfunkels ""Hazy Shade of Winter"". The palm trees go by as Clay's taxi floats into one of Beverly Hill's affluent neighborhoods. The music dies down as Clay enters his empty modern impersonal family home and plays the message machine, only to learn that both his parents could not be present to welcome him home.

The foreshadowing is all there in that establishing scene with the credits - the lack of familial love, the emptiness and detachment of the main character that matches the hollow environment.

The first party is a lavish F. Scott Fitzgerald ""Great Gatsbyesqe"" 1987 party filled with dozens of television playing video images timed to rock musics. There are theme winter wonderland rooms, where the fake snow on the floors represent the white cocaine being blown up the rich teen's noses.

The plot of the film is loosely based on the brilliant first novel by Bret Easton Ellis. Mr. Ellis' novel stands as one of the most significant literary works of the late 20th Century.

Many amateur ""film"" critics have criticized the film for not doing justice to Mr. Ellis' literary creation. Fortunately, I do not suffer from the misconception that a film must be judged by how exact it matches its literary inspiration, rather than judging the film on its own merit.

Screenwriter Harley Peyton, who was rumored to produce a first draft closely following the novel, modified his script into a lean script that could be transformed into a brilliant motion picture. The essence of isolation, friendship, drug-addition, and lost youth remains. I would argue that a closer adaptation of Mr. Ellis' novel would not have made a good film, because rarely on screen is it successful to portray a main character without emotion. Mr. Peyton needed to create character arcs, where the characters start one place and over the course of the film has some change, whether positive or negative.

Robert Downey Jr. gives the performance of his life (literally) portraying the drug addict that he was to become and which almost ruined his career.

One of my favorite shots in film is the second to last shot. Andrew McCarthy, Robert Downey Jr. and Jami Gertz sit mourning in Clay's classic Corvette which sits on a lonely road in the middle of the desert surrounded by Joshua trees. A flyover shot of the desert closes in for a close-up on the Corvette and the devastated main characters. The shot is breathtaking.

Taken in context of film history of the 1980s, this is a clearly darker take on youth, than the John Hughe's stories of the time, like ""Pretty in Pink"" (1984) and ""The Breakfast Club"" (1985). ""Less Than Zero"" - the film and the novel should be a must see film and must read novel for every serious film viewer and reader.",1205107200,4,3433,4.765993265993266
305157,5,6301006798,"I haven't read the book, but I deduce from the other reviews that it would be pretty impossible to adapt it into a coherent movie. I think it's unfair to compare the two anyway, most movies differ considerably from their source material, that in and of itself doesn't make for a bad movie. I've always found this film to be fascinating, partly because the world in which it was set was so alien to me, even though I was about the same age as the characters back then. Yes, the movie is slick and somewhat soulless, but so are the people it's portraying. Their lifestyle is both alluring and repellent at the same time, and the director did a good job of capturing that. The performances by Robert Downey Jr. and James Spader are pitch perfect. Even though Andrew McCarthy and (especially) Jami Gertz aren't up to that level, their performances seem oddly appropriate, and I can't imagine anyone else as these two. Many of the minor roles are well acted as well. I also love the original music by Thomas Newman, the orchestral pieces are hauntingly beautiful and really add to the movie.",1203465600,2,1086,4.603092783505154

The music, the wardrobe, and McCarthy, Gertz, Spader, and Downey, Jr. were some of my favorite actors during this period.  While watching the film now as an adult, I can see the flaws in the dialogue and direction - some of the scenes played like music videos - but the acting, especially by Downey, Jr. was actually pretty good.  Gertz is quite believable as the snobby, ""I can quit anytime I want to"" coke queen, Blair and McCarthy displays his charm as Mr. Nice Guy, Clay, but it's really Downey, Jr. as the drugged out Julian who's the real presence in this film.  Downey's Julian is spot on as the guy who's down on his luck and can't catch a break so he resorts to drugs to mask the pain of life and the pain of losing his friend, Clay, to a successful college career. Spader's drug dealer, Rip, is fun to watch as well.",1199145600,,896,4.252941176470588

The only performance worth a damn is Andrew McCarthy, he actually cares about his snobby, heartless friends, I always thought McCarthy was highly under-rated. This film goes absolutely nowhere, it's mudane, tries to be glamourous, and it's boring to look at. If you want a real and profound film about the ugly and dangerous world of drugs, I would check out Requiem for a Dream. Stay away from this uninspired mess!",1189468800,,675,4.633333333333334

And I have to admit...I'm not crazy about Jami Gertz' performance or persona--she wouldn't have gotten a second look back then, at any of the clubs.  But the storyline, as rewritten for clarity by the screenwriter from the far less coherent book, is spot on.  We came, we saw, we had sex and snorted (or...some of us did) in the bathroom...and we died of chronic overboogie 'way too young and 'way too often.

To see these star's early work was the most redeeming factor, then look at where they all are now.  The tragic story of drugs ruining lives, friendships, families, perhaps was a newer concept back then?  Having lived in the 80's (or lived through) one could possibly relate to the moral of the story that drugs bring bad fashion to the level of beyond Popular & less of a statement of expression. The life of the lead Robert Downey Jr. in the film became real.  ""Art immitating life & Life becoming less than artful."" A foreshadowing of his future sans film.  Although I happen to think Downey can truly act on some level worth watching. James Spader was his typical self (see Boston Public this season).  Still Standing (CBS) was a winner tho with showing that mother's younger days of bad hair & Coke. All in all it was a romp through the blast from the past era.  The best part is when Downey barfs after Supposedly being FORCED to give oral sex to other men to pay off his debt.  Can we say TYPE CASTING?  Altho, I do believe he's never been forced to give oral sex to any man rather eagerly engages in it til he gets it right. The soundtrack was however memorable & for these things is worth keeping in one's collection, if nothing more than to remind us of Hollywoods use of POOR RICH KIDS GONE WRONG.

James Spader who normally plays a snobby rich kid(at least back in those days) portrays a cold hearted drug dealer and Robert Downey Jr. portrays a kid with a serious freebase or crack addition(sounds like his real life) who gets into a big debt with the drug dealing Spader.

305163,3,6301006798,"I think what mostly has a lot of people frustrated about this movie (myself included) is that it's exactly opposite from the book. With that being said, I think they also wanted to somewhat bring some resolution to the movie that wasn't in the book. I guess I'm torn in this review for the simple fact that even though I know this movie is not like the book, I still didn't altogether hate it (I didn't love it either). Don't get me wrong, they seriously twisted the details as far as the way the book actually goes, but in the book nothing is solved. The same way you start at page 1 is the same way you'll end up at page 200. This movie is sad and depressing, and that's exactly what the book is, but the movie would've been better if they wouldn't have deliberately changed so much. In the book, Clay wasn't the hero, he was an addict too. Secondly, this movie focuses only on Julien's addiction, but Julien isn't even in the book until the end. Thirdly, the real slap in the face to the fans is that Julien..DOESN'T DIE! Don't get me wrong, I guess with the movie they wanted to bring forth a resolution while emphasizing not to do drugs because this is ultimately what your life could be. It just didn't manage to impress any fans of the novel though. I must admit the one good thing this movie did have going for it was James Spader. James Spader was definitely in his comfort zone though seeing as how he played the bully/bad guy in all of the movies he did in the 80's. It doesn't matter he still rocked it though. Ultimately, I see the statement they were making with the movie, but I guess I could've appreciated it more if they stuck to the story. I guess the best advice I can give is to judge this movie on it's own terms. If you avoid the book you'll like the movie.

305185,3,6301006798,"I think the title of my review sums it up: we all knew Julian would end up dead at the end of this film, despite the well-meaning yet flimsey attempts Clay and Blair made to pull him from the wreck of his life.

And is it just me, or did Andrew McCarthy's Clay look like Opie Taylor when he went to face off with James Spader's Rip while

Rip was in the pool? I'm surprised I didn't start laughing out loud, a la ""MST3K"", such lame protagonism. It's like, ""Okay, but you and what army? I've got your buddy and your erstwhile girlfriend in my pocket, and you're just Ivy League Ken! Ha! Ha!"". Spader was always good at playing a jerk.

While this movie is the best 80's cheese has to offer, I can't help but be a softie when it comes to these three muttonheads. I do feel badly seeing Julian go down the slipperly slope of addiction, and rather than want to smack some sense into him, I'd would much rather save that for his a**hole dad. What idiot in his right mind gives his kid that much money to start a recording studio straight out of high school if the kid has no music business experience to begin with? I'm thinking if you have the frogskins to p*ss away on this venture, you have enough money to give your kid the highest quality drug rehab there is to offer. My parents would have done this for me. No, just tough-love ""daddy's little family disgrace"" to the point where he is sleeping on park benches in expensive clothing and selling himself through a ruthless ex-high school classmate to pay off his 50,000K coke debt. Let him not only steal from his friends, but become a potential AIDS statistic. If this had been my fate, my dad would have cut both his arms off!

Not having the benefit of a funeral scene with the old b@stard sobbing his head off in regret boils my blood! Parenting Beverly Hills Style. And Blair's dad was no prize pig, either!

It broke my heart even further, despite the hollow park bench scene, where Clay discusses with Blair how Julian coped with his mother's death when he was barely out of diapers. Man, this kid had it rough long before he discovered coke.

Overall, this movie did have its silly moments (and I'm green with envy over the lavish Christmas parties those Beverly Hills kids had at their nightclubs), but if you have ever experienced a drug addiction of your own or know someone who has, this flick has a strong tearjerker potential. I'm surprised no high school teacher has the guts to use this and Uma Thurman's overdose scene from ""Pulp Fiction"" as an example of what drugs can do to your life.",1149552000,3,2554,4.40042372881356
305186,1,6301006798,"I actually saw this movie when it first came out, and was so blown away by Robert Downey Jr's performance (he was just starting out on his illustrious, if self-destructive career) that I didn't notice much else about the movie, certainly not Jami Gertz or Andrew McCarthy who are as close to being ciphers as it's possible to have on the big screen.  (The adults in the film are as cipheresque as the kids, so there is no real dramatic interest there -- we have only the kids, and their interactions with drugs, the party scene, and each other.)

Seeing it again 25 years later, well ...Downey's performance still holds up, but the rest of the movie is less than zero (sorry).  The director is so absorbed with staging endless party scenes (unintentionally hilarious in their excesses) that he forgets to give the main characters anything interesting to do, and they never develop into anyone we care about.  The final scene, with McCarthy and Gertz sitting forlornly in a cemetery, has no emotional payoff whatever-- McCarthy says come with me to the East Coast, Gertz responds yes, I'll go with you, and the viewer says, ""Thank God, that means the movie's over.""

Finally, James Spader doesn't play a real character either, but as other reviewers have noted, he is interestingly slimy as the chief bad guy.  Glad to see he's still getting work, in a fairly interesting role on ""Boston Legal"".",1148774400,2,1394,4.763485477178423
305187,2,6301006798,"Less Than Zero was hailed all over the place when it was released....hailed by all but the critics. Sure, it did fair box office, because it had some of the ""hip"" actors of the day appearing in it AND because it was based on THE hip book (I was right there living it too!).

The unfortunate aspect of the film is that neither the script, the actors, nor the directer ever really provide us with a ""baseline"" from which we can launch any sympathy for Julian (Downey Jr.). We see he, Clay (McCarthy) and Blair (Gertz) all graduate high school, but we don't know what they were like IN high school. Therefore, as we are thrust into Julian's ever downward spiraling drug habit, we don't know if this is normal or not.

Clay and Blair dated through high school. Julian was their best friend. All three come from obscenely wealthy and priviledged West coast families with little in the way of family values to show them their way in life. Everything has been handed to them and that was it - no real parenting apparently ever took place.

After Clay leaves LA to go East to an ivy league school, Julian and Blair start bedding each other. Even though Blair is contemptible for her actions, it appears that she and Clay are the only two in this film who have any real sense of responsibility and Blair realizes hers late in the film.

Julian's daddy gave him tons of money to start a business and Julian lost it all on drugs and partying. He's been ""homeless"" ever since, sleeping in parks and at friends houses when he can. In the process, his drug habit has gone from coke to crack and possibly a little heroin along the way. Where does he get it all? Why their high school friend, Rip (Spader) of course. He's not only a major drug dealer, but apparently does some pimping of women and men on the side. Julian is in for $50K to Rip and the only way he can work it off is to turn tricks with guys....

Aint this all uplifting and exciting? Well, it has its exciting moments. And when you consider all the action in this film takes place over Clay's college Christmas break, it's all the more distressing.

The film effectively captures the ambiance of privileged college kids gone wild in the 80's. The clothing and the excess is all very very real. It's a shame that the film just never lets us feel too sorry for Julian. I wanted to shake him or kick his rear end. What a tool! And Clay and Blair...? If I'd been them, I'd have kicked ol' Julian to the curb long before - what a bore taking care of a drug addict (forgive me my seeming lack of concern, but I have ACTUALLY taken care of a drug addicted friend - it gets old really quickly...the lies, etc.).

Anyway, if you allow the script's lack of a true emotional center, then I have to complain about one further thing: Andrew McCarthy. I have never understood why he was a working actor of such popularity. Downey Jr. (amazing in this film, because it was at one of his greatest times of drug abuse - which makes it a true case of art imitating life and vice versa) and Gertz are fine in the film. But McCarthy...I've never thought him capable of acting his way out of a wet paper sack. There's nothing going on there. No emotion. No sense of urgency other than when he moves quickly. His face is blank, completely vacuous...

Anyway, buy this for its value as a real time capsule into some of the excesses of the 80's but don't get it because it's a great film or for any DVD extras, because what's there is slim to none - mostly various versions of the film's trailer.",1145577600,3,3523,4.351598173515982
305188,3,6301006798,"I am a huge Bret Easton Ellis fan so rightfully so I was appauled at the way this film destroyed his novella of the same name.  Don't get me wrong, this is not a terrible movie...I still gave it 3 stars, but if they had called it something else instead of passing it off as an adaptation I would have given it 4 or 5.  The problem is that they don't just take libertys, they change the story completly. Here are a few (just a few) of the reasons I feel the film was destroyed.

SPOILER ALERT FOR BOTH THE NOVEL AND THE FILM!!!

First off, Clay (McCarthy) does drugs in the novel, and lots of them.  He has no moral code, no ""Let's help Julian""...No, Julian is his dealer and thats all.

Second...there was no affair between Julian (Downey Jr.) and Blair (Gertz), and even if there was, Clay wouldn't have cared because he was always strung out on coke and sleeping with somebody else.  They didn't care about boyfriend, girlfriend crap.  Clay would have probably joined in had he found Julian in bed with Blair.

Third, the fact that they changed arounf who pimped who in order to spare less extras is fine, but by changing Rips (Spaders) charactor so much they never explore what made him tick as far as the novel is concerned.  One of the most memerable scenes in the novel involves Rip and his friends raping a young girl, and although that may have been to graphic a scene for 80's film it was a defining moment in realizing who Rip was.

Fourth, and a BIG fourth...Julian never died in the novel.  There was no tragic ending, no morale issue to contend with.  That scene was added to place a moral code, to place a reason to remember the film.  It was a banner saying ""DON'T DO DRUGS"" but what the producer and director failed to realize is that ""Less than Zero"" is not an anti-drug novel.  It does not have a point, it's just there...and that's what makes it so freaking brilliant.  If they had left it alone, and made the movie that should have been made then they would have had a masterpiece on their hands.

Like I said...this is not terrible.  If they had named this film somthing else, anything else...I don't care if it was ""Don't do Drugs"" or hell, even ""Less than Nothing"" just not ""Less than Zero""...It was just a marketing attempt for some guy with a script about the dangers of drug abuse to get his film made, tagging it onto the coat-tails of a popular book at the time.

Bad move!",1140134400,4,2401,4.355056179775281
305189,1,6301006798,"I happened to catch *Less Than Zero,* a film based on Bret Easton Ellis's novella of the same name, on Bravo one afternoon. It wasn't the first time I'd seen it, but I hadn't seen it in so long that it was as if I was watching it for the first time.

I recall that the film--featuring such eighties bratpackers as the eternally pubescent Andrew McCarthy, a particularly unctious and reptilian James Spader, and, in an eerily prescient casting choice, the soon-to-be recidivist substance abuser Robert Downey, Jr. as the troubled, substance abusing Julian--struck me at the time of its release as being an important, unblinking exploration of the plight of the spectacularly wealthy, whose main problem seems to be their spectacular wealth. Watching it now, in 2004, I cannot help but think that the film's singular attraction rests in a certain lurid relish in seeing the beautiful folk of Beverly Hills plummet from high atop the ramparts of the house that Reaganomics built, and endure a series of picturesque humilations as they descend. In other words, we seek in the film the frisson of fabulous devastation.

Which brings me to my point: as cinematic tragedy, *Less Than Zero* fails utterly, because it constucts a world in which morality is almost entirely absent. The film eschews this ponderous convention altogether and opts instead for the pseudo-effects of spectacle. This choice on the filmaker's part, however, becomes deleterious to the film, reducing it to a series of gestures, poses, and set pieces of such calculated slickness that the net effect upon the viewer is one of estrangement. She sees constructed before her a demimonde of such moral vacuity as to be nearly unrecognizable. Ignoring for a moment the film's commercial enticements--the now laughably garish late-eighties couture and the various other items of conspicuous consumption--one is left with an intensely derivative film full of clich dialogue, stock poor-little-rich-girl-and-guy types, and contrived situations. Thus, instead of eliciting our sympathy, Julian's fall from his plush aerie high above L.A. to the decidedly unglamorous back rooms in which he fellates strangers takes on all the dumb inevitability of a hurricane. We feel as if we are watching something monstruous and misbegotten that must surely collapse and suffocate on its own bulk--which, if we are totally honest with ourselves, is often our attitude when witnessing the extravagances of the filthy rich.

Hence the strategem of *Less Than Zero*: it begs the audience to supply it with the moral context it cannot itself provide. To borrow the language of of neo-Aristotelian literary critic Wayne Booth, *Less Than Zero* constructs an ideal viewer who is such a well-conditioned creature of popular culture that she will reflexively endow the film with the gravitas it itself foresakes in its pursuit of spectacle. All she must do is respond to cues: a suggestive glance, insouciant mugging, the figure of a dishevelled Julian pensively smoking on the beach. However, should this ideal viewer never materialize, or, if present, prove refractory, then the film falls on the sword of its own irrelevance. *Less Than Zero* value, then, ultimately remains historical. It remains a curious relic of a strange and sinister decade--a decade that managed to be both puritanical and decadent, consisting of strange juxtapositions (The PMRC and DIY video porn, ""Morning in America"" and McMartin Preschool). A decade that, despite its being characterized by gross economic injustice and insane foreign policy (""Mutually Assured Destruction""), has become quite an object of nostalgia for the under-thirty set. It will perhaps be these individuals who restore *Less Than Zero* to its glossily vacuous glory.",1136592000,,3756,5.277591973244147
305190,4,6301006798,"I first saw this movies as an 18 year old when it came out in Australia in 1987. I initially thought it would be one of those 80's love stories with a bit of the usual soft drug use and cheesy laughs that were the staple of the time.

In reflection I now know what a mistake that was.

The drug useage , prostitution and evil consequences made me WAY sure that I wasn't doing any of that and the DONT DO DRUGS message of the times worked for me.

What amazes me is that Robert Downey Jr after making this film actually did develop a well documented drug habit etc.

Great film, should be shown to all 15-18 year olds just to let them know what can and probably does happen when you play the game and get caught up in it.",1136505600,2,720,4.013986013986014

My friend Jeffnine let me borrow his copy of less than zero because he said Andrew MCCarthyee was better in this than he was in pretty in pink. I did't believe this was possible so I watched it. Man, being on drugs looks fun for awhile because you drive a cool car and hang around hot girls, but then it didn't look like fun throwing up all over the place and dying. I like being alive and super cool. I have friends that are much cooler than yours in J Abs,Kroll,Burns and JB, but we have never gotten into the whole crack cocaine thing. You know what we find fun? We like to get in our luxury sports cars and drive around looking for a delicious cheesesteak restaurant.

305192,1,6301006798,"This was probably the quintescinal movie about 80s yuppie greed.  ""Die Yuppie Scum"" wasn't just a catch praise.  A movie like this captures so much as a period in history as it does an attitude and a message.  Here we see an insipid cast of 80s trust fund babies in southern California wasting their lives keeping a nose the the mirror while their parents in their tennis whites are either too busy, too frivolous, or too unattentive to care.  Most of their sober moments are spent in paranoia and vomiting while they flounder from one place or party to another.

What's the point, some of you are asking?  Well the underline point is ""Just Say No"", of course.  But the minor points, as I would learn, lead down just such a destructive path.  Robert Downey Jr. and the others who are all screwed up on drugs choose this for themselves.  They are given every opportunity, every challenge, and ever material thing only to throw it away.  I was just a kid when I saw this movie and didn't understand anything about it, except that they were people with problems.  As an adult I would meet people who might not have been the wealthiest or most privilaged, but they were just as self centered and unwilling to do anything but drugs.  They always claimed poverty, but always had enough money to buy drugs or take trips to places.  They wanted freedom and indepence from their parents or other ""establishment"" things, but didn't do anything about it but more drugs.  They always screamed and fought with their friends and loved ones, went further down the spiral and yet did nothing to change it.  Getting high was what it was all about and you couldn't convince them otherwise.  And you moved on to get a job and be responsible, they didn't.  Tough.

Since this movie was on a movie channel (no commercials, nothing cut out), I decided to watch it because I saw Robert Downey, Jr's. name in the credits. Watching this movie was worth it just for his performance alone. I can't think of a movie that he disappointed me in. He plays a very convincing drug addict in this one... I wonder why?? (Though I've heard he's cleaned himself up and has several movies in the works, and I'm very, truly, proud of him.)

Robert Downey Jr, Andrew McCarthy, and Jami Gertz play three people who've been friends since high school. McCarthy's character, Clay, went away to college. Julian (Downey) and Blair (Gertz) stayed in L.A.; Julian becoming a serious junky and Blair becoming a coke-snorting model. When Julian begins to get into serious trouble (he owes the weasely James Spader 50,000 bucks), it's on Clay and Blair's backs to help out their good friend.

Their whole world is foreign to me. Lavish parties with every kind of drug available for your smoking or snorting pleasure. The script is good, making this 80s haze very clear to me. Oddly, that's what I really detest about this movie... half of the time the scenes are somewhat hazy looking. I also dislike how several scenes had a funky red tint-- what's supposed to be stylistic is just plain annoying.

305229,5,6301006798,First off I have to say this is one of my favorite films. However I'd be lying to say it was anything like the book. For instance in the book Clay is an emotionless empty void who more than occasionally takes drugs and never really finds fulfillment or contentness  by the end one can't really feel sympathy for him in the novel. The film gave him more of a soul with some direction in life which one can sympathize with. The book has more characters that weave in and out of the story. The movie seemed to focus more on Julian (Downey Jr) & his decent into addiction.  I'm one of those people who actually liked the movie a little more than the novel. What I liked about this film for one the cinematography was outstanding really went with the mood of the film. It made you want to see what the scene was like in LA in the 80's besides the drugs there was a lot of energy. Overall I thought the acting was good. James Spader's portrayal of money hungry drug dealer Rip was flawless. Downey Jr really caught the essence of a drug addict I thought. In short synopsis Clay (Andrew McCarthy) comes back to Hollywood -LA after attending school back east in New England College. He comes back to his coke addicted girlfriend Blair ( Gertz) & messed up best friend Julian (R Downey Jr) who has a drug addiction the size of Utah after his dreams of owning a record label collapse. Clay notices nothing has really changed around here but Julian is going down the tubes faster everyday. He owes the local drug dealer Rip major amount of money. Clay tries desperately to help them out and bring them back to school with him. One of best films in 80's cinema. A lot of people bagged on this film because they say it didn't accurately represent the book. I think it wasn't meant to be just like the book. But it's one of those movies that brings you right there as if your living it for the hour & a half that your watching it good dark drama film.

305231,5,6301006798,"Ok, so it might be someone else's film title, but this is one of the essential 80s brat flicks and concerns the said heading in every aspect. Let's get the rubbish out of the way.  The plot is twiddled with until it barely resembles the book.  A lot of Ellis' humour gets lost in translation.  Blair is a brunette unlike her published blonde doppelganger. Hmmm.
That said, Less Than Zero is probably the one film that epitomises the 80s like no other for me.  The opening shots, with the Bangles brilliant cover of 'Hazy Shade...' clanging in the background, still invites chills.
Others have written the plot succintly, so I will say that if you want a cold, clinical, no exit look at being a rich, bored teen in LA, search no further.  Blair (Jamie Gertz)is deliciously confused, drugged and flakey, and Clay, the solid rock in the middle of his friends' breakdowns is perfectly cast in a youthful Andrew McCarthy.  Top honours go to Robert Downey Jnr, spookily playing out his own future as the drug addled Julian with frenetic highs and lows, insincere to himself and broken to his mates, and  James Spader as the vile pimp and dealer Rip.
Wonderfully photographed by Edward Lachman, it's simultaneously lush and sparse.  If the end scenes don't get you sobbing into a pillow, then take that stone out of your chest and get a heart.  Less Than Zero has been unfairly mauled by many, but it stands up today as a film with much more going for it than you may think.  For starters, it may be one of the only teen flicks that doesn't make you howl/cringe because of ropey dialogue and cheeseball disco moments.  Its 'drugs message' is played out minus politics and simply invites you take a journey with the characters. Death, it seems to say, is inevitable for everyone, some just go a little faster.
Less Than Zero is sexy, frank and troubled.  There could not have been a better antithesis to the whizz bang makeover! of other 80s teen films (John Hughes take note!).  Helped by a storming soundtrack, this one should be in your collection somewhere.",1087862400,7,2053,4.638121546961326

The movie is not a feel good movie or a preachy movie (although it tries to do so with its drug message), but it does have some great things going for it.  The music was excellent, Robert Downey Jr. is very good, and some of the cinematography (especially the last few minutes of the film) was inspired.
Still, you can't overlook some of the problems.  The acting is simply uneven.  Andrew McCarthy looks as though he is interviewing for a stuffy banking position.  The relationship between Julian and his father is never really played out.  Rip's henchman looks like a California surfer with an attitude problem, not a bouncer type that is out to do no good.  The movie all but says that if you are 18, white, and live in Beverly Hills, your main entertainment venue is snorting cocaine.

First of all, in the movie Clay is all sqeaky clean and compassionate; in the book, he does coke and seems pretty detached.  Second, in the the book Julien doesn't really appear until near the end.

But the film adaptation goes overboard in the opposite direction, trying to make Clay and his sometime girlfriend, Blair, look like paragons of caring in a non-caring world.  As if the film directors realized that Clay in the book was too empty a personality to hold a movie together, they switched the focus to Julian, a peripheral player in the book; we're supposed to feel angst at watching him self-destruct through his addiction to drugs.  Clay and Blair come across as even less interesting in the movie than they do in the book.  Except for two excellent performances by Robert Downey as Julian and James Spader as a drug dealer who keeps Julian hooked, the actors are uninspired and the film script can only be described as banal.

I'm sorry, but I am confused as to why the movie is even called ""Less than zero"", The creators of this movie could of just very well, chosen diffrent character names and wouldn't have had to give Bret Eastin Ellis any credit.
When I watched the movie I was rolling my eyes by the end of the first scene, and bubbling in anger at the end of the movie.

I read the back of the DVD before buying it, and said to my friend that I had a feeling i was going to be disappointed (because it just read like it was a crappy adaption) but i couldn't have been more wrong.
I can't express myself more when I say that humans versus drugs is a losing battle for us.  And this movie backs me up greatly.
Just by watching Julian (Downey Jr.) slowly fall into one of his binges is enough to make tears come to your eyes.  To watch his friends try and help, and to see they are in a lost cause hurts just as much.
The acting in this movie is awesome.  The cast is some of the best teen actors from the middle 80's, and the director hit his mark perfectly.  I would think that Ellis' (Less than Zero author) is very proud.
Rather than focusing in on the worthless lives of the young and rich in L.A.  as Ellis did in the novel, this flick really just pics three characters from the book and focuses more into their lives over Christmas vacation and what they are doing to themselves.

305273,3,6301006798,"Less Than Zero still looks like the MTV School of Movies product it was back in 1987 when that channel beat everyone over the head with the Bengals' remake of Hazy Shade of Winter.  Matter of fact, that song plays almost in its entirety over the opening credits for no other reason than, well, marketing a soundtrack.
I'm kind of split over this film.  It has little to do with the actual plot of Bret Easton Ellis' source novel, but then again, given that Ellis is rarely concerned with ""plot"" that doesn't seem to matter much.  I don't think there's a single scene in this film that is taken from the book, and to some degree, the film downplays some of the seedier elements of the source material.  In the end, it's a somewhat depressing film about addiction and what happens when you lose all control.
Clay (Andrew McCarthy) returns to LA for Christmas, having just finished his first semester at a New England college.  Of course, in true Hollywood style, these people do not look like teenagers, nor do they act like most teenagers.  A few months translates to massive, earth-shattering events in their lives.  You know, the kinds of events that only happen to the stupidly rich and decadent on TV and in movies.  (You may start wondering why your life was never this explosive at 18).  Clay's childhood buddy Julian (Robert Downey, Jr.), an underachieving rich kid with a wild side, is in some kind of trouble.  The spaced out Blair (Jamie Gertz), begs Clay to talk to him.  But Clay would rather get back together with Blair even though he found her in bed with Julian during Thanksgiving break.
Long story short, Julian is broke, the record label his father set him up in after high school went pear shaped, his drug problem is out of control, and his father wants nothing to do with him.  Julian has taken about six months from graduation to spiral downward into debt, free base, booze, and general LA-malaise.  Clay seems like the only hope, even if he's pretty much a space cadet himself.
The film meanders; its only real dedication is in playing song after song in true music video style in an attempt at telling a story.  Wasn't Ellis condemning this type of world in the novel?  I guess the movie is more concerned with good business than condemnation.
I'm torn between thinking the performances by the two main leads are awful and thinking that they are actually perfect for the film.  Ellis' characters in the book were not deep.  They were a bunch of severely disaffected youth with too much time, money,
and freedom on their hands and absolutely nothing to show for it but a bloody nose from bad coke.  It was close to impossible to feel anything for any of them, and that comes across clearly in the film.  The film is not coherent enough to be doing any real moralizing.  The characters seem to have grown up too fast and are, frankly, losers.
However, this is really Robert Downey, Jr.'s life story: a guy who just can't stop, who keeps falling off the wagon, gets back on, promises to clean up, and then screws up again.  He is an excellent actor with more talent than the rest of the cast combined.  You're convinced he's not acting half the time.  His only rival for performance is the tremendous James Spader as a somewhat sympathetic drug dealer, the type of sleazy guy who seems to grow on trees in Beverly Hills.  He stalks the hot clubs of LA like a shark, looking menacing in the music video light as he hunts down the ever-sinking Julian.
While Julian was a minor character in the book, the absolute lack of depth in both leads makes the decision to tell Julian's story a wise one, even if it is numbing.  It's doubtful that anyone watching Less Than Zero will feel an iota of sympathy, but Downey Jr. works hard (or does he?) to play someone so completely out of control.  He is the main draw here, providing a spectacle for the morbidly curious.  Less Than Zero is a good title since it describes how much value you can attach to anyone here.
Oddly enough, the ending also foreshadows that later Andrew McCarthy classic, Weekend at Bernie's.
The DVD looks pretty good.  The film is heavy on style, and the lighting in some shots is expressive and makes for nice eye candy.  I liked the scene of the motorcycle gang roaring by the stopped Corvette.
Tidbit: One of the trailers features some of Giorgio Moroder's music from Cat People.  It's the track To the Bridge from the Cat People soundtrack disc.",1061769600,,4434,4.568900126422251
305274,4,6301006798,"Though most reviewers commented on their disppointment that this movie missed the mark 1000% when it came to adapting the novel by Ellis to the big screen, I believe if you view this film as a message movie for the ages where drugs and excess are concerned, then you will be quite impressed.  If not for Robert Downey Jr. and James Spaders' performances, however, the other actors could not have carried the message with such brutal force.  Julian is a wreck of an addict, distraught over family issues, wild eyed with crazy drug induced moods, not really making it in school, and his circle of friends, male and female, are his only salvation.  At the same time, they are his downfall, for Julian slides effortlessly into the glamorous world of sex, clubs and drugs with his friends right by his side.  This picture came out in the eighties, when JUST SAY NO was on everyone's lips, and the dangers of ""recreational"" drug use were not exposed as vividly.  Watching Julian's descent into hell feels like a punch in your chest, and the ending, though some may have seen it coming, shook me up considerably, having known a person with a similar fate back in my '80's high school days.  Of course this film is not classic filmmaking or even original storytelling, but I think showing it to impressionable teens at an early age might not be a bad idea.  And how accurately did art mirror life when, in the 1990's, Downey Jr. nearly killed himself getting high on everything under the sun.  This film was not a far stretch for him.",1048982400,74,1526,4.605166051660516

They change the events as well as people and places in almost every scene of the movie.  Worst of all it seems that they didn't even understand the book.  The book wasn't just about Jullian, and his struggles.  In my opinnion the focus of the book was Clay, and how he and none of his friends were happy.  They had everything, and they cared about nothing.  Everyone was just distant and estranged.  The movie failed badly at capturing this.  Clay's family wasn't even in the movie for god's sake.  To top it all off they changed the ending.  You can't change the ending of a famous piece of literature.  There should be a rule to keep amature filmakers like this guy from doing that.  Bottom line...they [messed] it up.  The book isn't about Jullian.  I guess they couldn't pass up on letting Robert Downy jr be himself.",1048204800,2,956,4.445086705202312

Clay played by the very very talented Andrew McCarthy decides to go away for college and his girlfriend Roxie decided not to go with him at the last minute. Clay leaves her behind and Roxie and Julien enter a world of partying and drugs. While in school Clay recieves a phone call from Roxie her now ex- girlfriend. She's worried about Julien and is asking Clay for help. Clay loyal to his friends even though he caught his girlfriend (Roxie) sleeping with his best friend (Julien) goes back home during Christmas break to help his friend who is in deep trouble oweing incredible amounts of money to people who are out to get him. As the story unfolds thier friendship seems more real and true than in the beginning and demonstrates what friends are really for, despite Juliens drug habits and lifestyle he is being forced to live in. Not giving away the end the once relationship with Roxie and Clay blossoms once again. Julien's however lifestyle eventually left him behind with LESS THAN ZERO. I encouage everyone to watch this movie that is more real than any other movie dealing with drugs.

Still, it manages to portray an interesting and eerily realistic look at that particular walk of life. I went to school with these people. Some of them grew up, like Clay, but some of them did not, like Julian. This film is beautifully, stylishly directed with stunning visual sequences. Gertz is good but McCarthy is only passable and sometimes just weak. Downey is outstanding and his performance is scary and heartwrenching. It's truly one of the most human performances I've seen in a film. The instrumental soundtrack by Thomas (Six Feet Under) Newman is haunting and adds to the exquisite direction.

The movie, however, is very stylish and lush, with attractive, likable, sympathetic characters whom you actually care about a little.  In the book, although some people may identify with the attitude and lifestyle, there is absolutely no plot or redeming characters, especially Clay.

...  What sets this movie apart from other 80s teen flicks is this: it doens't end with some diabetes-inducing sweet Hollywood happy ending (and I think that is what really disturbs people).  True, the movie's main point seems to be ""Just Say No"".  But underneath lies other messages.  True friends are rare, there are way too many plastic people running around, it's way to easy to get stuck in a rut and sometimes life just really sucks.
McCarthy does a fine job as the guy who tried to leave his go nowhere high school life behind and move on only to get sucked in again.  Gertz, never one of my favorites, abley portrays the spectator to her friend Julian's self-destruction and tries to ignore it even though she is heading in the same direction.  And Downey, Jr.?  Geez, he nails his part as Julian the well meaning dreamer who's on a bullet train to Dante's Inferno with really scary accuracy.
On a lighter note: the classic Corvette McCarthy drives is sweet.  And watch for the scene in the basement dance club where the boom mic guy can be seen clear as day.
A great flick with lots of substance.  If nothing else, get it for your kids.  It may not scare'em straight, but it may make'em think twice.",1024185600,4,1428,4.432950191570881

It often seemed as if director Marek Kanievska really wanted to make a music video.  One could argue that this look is appropriate for the superficial world that the characters inhabit, but that doesn't make me enjoy it any more.  It is filled with absurd MTV moments like the two young lovers stopping their car right in the middle of the road and making out passionately while bikers rumble past on either side of them.

This is the essence of what is at the core of the characters who inhabit this film. All of them are filthy rich, and everything in their life is about how you look on the outside, while their inner core rots away. Julien, hauntingly played by Robert Downey Jr. , can no longer keep up the facade of looking good. His chronic cocaine addiction and the pain he suffers is on full outer display. Making this film even more poignant is how you can almost feel the real Robert Downey Jr. crying out through his performance,
""Less Than Zero"" centers on the forementioned characters, as well as Clay who has not fallen into drug addiction, but watches his ex-girlfriend Blair in the begining stage of addiction and his best friend Julien falling into the abyssmal stage. The film takes the viewer through the fascinating underworld of the L.A. ritzy drug scene of the 1980s. Despite the emotional brutality that the characters go through, the film is beautiful to look at, furthering the ironic notion of the film that despite being surrounded by beauty, the really is nothing but emptiness. There are a couple of emotionally jaw dropping scenes involving Clay and Blair trying to help Julian overcome his drug addiction. But in reality only he can save himself. ""Less Than Zero"" has no illusions about the power of drug addiction. The film shows the insanity of repeating the same self destructive actions over and over again.
Note that the soundtrack is amazing, including the Bangles cover of ""Hazy Shade of Winter"". The score by Thomas Newman is so mournfully powerful it sends chills up your spine. Jami Gertz deserves special recogniton for her performance, who some might misunderstand, you have to remember she is coked up and like most of the characters in the film doesn't want to feel.

Hollywood was eager to buy the rights to this best-selling novel, but Hollywood was also too chicken to actually film it... so they ran the novel through a wringer, and what came out on the other side is a formula story of two friends (Andrew McCarthy and Jami Gertz) who try to stop a third friend (Robert Downey Jr.) from taking a drug-fueled elevator straight to [the bottom]. And director Marek Kanievska even manages to foul that up, too.
The really frustrating thing about this film is how good the cast is--or rather, how could it COULD have been if absolutely anything about this sorry waste of time and money had been worth a damn. This is a really, truly shabby bit of hyped-up commercialism without any substance to it at all, badly written, directed, and filmed, and the only other title to which I can compare it is the abominable Didi Conn film YOU LIGHT UP MY LIFE.

The only person with a drug problem in the film, however, is Downey Jr.'s character, while the rest of the cast (Gertz and McCarthy) try to save him while they fall in love.  As far as I can see, this is a direct result of Reagan's ""just say no"" anti-drug and pro-family campaigns of the 1980's.  The film makers were making a piece that reflected the political climate --- they weren't necessarily interested in staying true to the plot of the novel (which, by the way, isn't necessary for a good film adaptation - but that's another discussion).",1018483200,,724,4.589147286821706

Clay (Andrew McCarthy) has gone east to college while his girlfriend Blair (Jamie Gertz) and Julian stay home.  Right before leaving Clay discovers Julian and Blair in bed together.  Although their is some tension, the trio remain friends.  The problems come from Julian's hardcore drug habit.  It has resulted in him being banished from his house and being heavily indebted to his drug dealer Rip (James Spader).  Rip pimps Julian out as a homosexual prostitute and Julian cannot do anything about it.  Clay and Blair try their best to help their friend, but Blair herself has a small cocaine problem.  The film has some strong performances in addition to Mr. Downey's, especially by Mr. Spade, who is effectively icy as Rip.  The film is shot in a music video style with a stellar soundtrack that includes Public Enemy, The Bangles, Aerosmith and the legendary Roy Orbison.

305319,2,6301006798,"If your idea of entertainment is to see how the rich, young and beautiful can be brought low, then this is the movie for you!
Beautiful and then-dewey Jami Gertz, Andrew McCarthy Robert Downey Jr. portray 18-year-olds whose ties to society, each other and their own futures all are compromised in one way or another by the heavy drug use by two of them.
Thus we are witness to betrayal, degradation, despair, longing and ultimately tragedy as the three attempt to come to terms with the neglect and carelessness that has brought their friendships - and their lives - to the brink.
It may be hard, however, for mainstream audience members to feel much pity for the three spoiled-rotten rich kids as so much of what is wrong with their lives seems their own fault.
True, their parents are not perfect, but few of them are.
The three close friends apparently spent their youths united against the cruel torments of their rich, indifferent parents.
Gertz and McCarthey's characters are high school students in love, but after he leaves for college, she holds out only for...oh...  weeks...before bedded their buddy, Downey.
We see guilt, betrayal, thwarted love. Things go from bad to schmaltzy as the characters engage in cryptic conversations. Their dialogue shows them to be cool and they are always impeccably dressed, but apparently engaging in actual dialogue would be uncool, so mostly they engage in faux-witty banter.
We don't quite understand what is at the core of the angst Gertz and McCarthy evidence. Maybe they felt it was the thing to do, but it makes for boring filmmaking.
Downey turns in a much better performance, although many unanswered questions remain about his character as well. Was part of his seduction with Gertz really a thwarted wish to have a sexual relationship with McCarthy? Or to get even with him somehow for moving ahead with his life and leaving the two of them behind?
Whatever the reason, his guilt and pain send him on a cocaine binge that has Downey exiled by his family and agreeing to prostitute himself for cocaine. Here, James Spader turns in a chilling small turn as the dealer who seems to enjoy witnessing Downey's degradation.
While we can sympathize with Downey - particularly in light of the sad true-live addiction that has stunted his career and repeatedly put him in trouble with the law - sympathy is not to be had for
Gertz or McCarthy.
They come across soley as cold, self-centered and the sort of kids you basically just wanted bad things to happen to.
For instance, during one scene, when a girl's nose starts bleeding because her habitually cocaine habit has actually eroded the carilage in her nose, she only giggles and says ""rusty pipes"" as she dabs at the blood. Gertz just looke on, saying nothing.
It's no surprise to the audience that there is no happy ending here. At the end, we are left to hope that the startling finality of death, witnessed close up, will lead some of the characters to a new start.
That, in any case, rang sadly true.

305320,5,6301006798,"Some people think that this film is disturbing, which it is, but it is a McDonald's commercial compared to the book.
The soundtrack is pretty cool. The premise for the movie is just a simple formula of 80's JUST SAY NO which was echoing throughout America during the time of its release. What makes the movie worthwhile are two elements: James Spader and Robert Downey Jr. In my opinion Robert Downey Jr. is the best actor of his generation and the reason I give this film five stars is for, what I believe, is the best work of his career. Gertz and McCarthy are lame but necessary in this formula. That being said, McCarthy's look is perfect for the role. The Montages of LA lights and clubs are totally mesmerizing.

305321,5,6301006798,"The most striking element that will ""hook"" you into watching this Bret Easton Ellis novel adaption of the same name, is the captivating visual beauty of the sets and cinematography. There are also two fine performances from two great actors.

Robert Downey Jr. gives a highly realistic performance as Julian, a hopeless junkie spiraling rapidly into oblivion before the eyes of his best friend Clay, played by Andrew McCarthy, and his on again, off again borderline coke-head gal-pal model, Blair(Jami Gertz). After Clay returns home from school, he's found that Julian has bedded his girl, and that being away has changed where he fits into this new drug addled scene. Despite this glaring breach of friendships, Clay plays the good egg who tries to keep both parties from self destruction.

The perpetually bug-eyed McCarthy seems strangely detached and unemotional in his role, while Jami Gertz, whom I usually find interesting, seems one dimensional and stiff.  The award here goes to the talented Robert Downey Jr. as Julian.  In this film he puts out a sincerely gut-wrenching performance. I once read that he said he WASN't acting, and that WAS how he is in real life.  Is the fact or the fiction stranger?  You must watch this and find out.

My favorite actor in general, as well as in this movie, is the great James Spader. I've seen just about everything he's ever been in, and he is no disappointment here. He turns in a fabulous performance as Trent, a ruthless drug dealer who has Julian under his thumb. When Julian gets in over his head and can't pay for his increasing habit, Trent is appropriately loathesome and cruel as he pimps Julian to earn his keep. The degradation he is put through escalates as Blair and Clay try to save him. James Spader and Robert Downey Jr. also worked beautifully together in the wonderful teen love story ""Tuff Turf"" in 1985. (See my review for more).

The other important reason to view this film, is that it's truly beautiful in the visual aspect. We see California wealth illustrated in moving pictures of bright technicolor.  Vividly  sparkling blue swimming pools,  elegant mansions with colorful manicured gardens and sprawling lawns too. Everyone looks like a fashion model who just stepped out of a glossy magazine. The parties are replete with debauched debutantes in crystal mirrored bathrooms holding their coke-bloody noses.  Watching this film is a guilty pleasure we must all experience vicariously.

Although it can be somewhat depressing at times, especially toward the end, I STILL enjoy it. The film also features a killer soundtrack that captures the era perfectly. These elements serve to elevate a minimally flawed script, and make this a visually arresting piece of gorgeous celluloid eye candy that needs to seen and sampled, even if you don't always like the taste of the rest.",1013990400,9,2849,4.9600840336134455

Forget the comparison's and the love/sex ""story"" between Mccarthy and his girlfriend and focus souly on the main point. In certain environments it is sometimes easier to become the passenger rather than the driver. I found a few scenes to be very intense and raw, regardless of the other overcoated ones.

His later life encounters with the law, have shown that he knew the material on a very personal level. Jamie Gertz is perfect as a very sexy party queen, who just wants to have fun. James Spader is riveting as the entrepreneurial monster stalking the weak. Although not having produced much else of any note, the Bangles song, ""Hazy Shade of Winter"", which opens the movie, is an engaging theme for what is to follow. The movie follows Robert Downey Jr's characters' decent into a nightmare of addiction, desperation, near death, and a last minute save by his friends. It is the difinitive cautionary tale for the recreational drug user. There is pleasure in the dance with the Devil, but the Devil is leading, and there is only 1 possible destination, an abyss of madness and hopelessness.

I could even draw parallels between people I knew in Austin in the 80's and the characters in the film (minus the fat pocket books :-)
I Fail to see why folks seem to want to rate this particular flick as bad because it did not follow the book - what movie does? You can't possibly be true to a book in one and a half to two hours or so. Rate the movie without stressing over the paperback. Yes, the book was awesome, I would highly recommend reading it. At the time it came out the author was widely praised,  for being a relative unknown (first novel if I recall correctly). But see the movie as well!
The acting may not be completely up to par at times, but in my humble opinion the movie itself more than makes up for this. This is a wonderfully entertaining tale of youthful excess at a time of comming of age. In a way it is kind of what you'd expect to get if the tv series 90210 and the movie Sid and Nancy had a baby (just watch it and you'll see what I mean :-).
As an aside, I've seen a lot of comments regarding Robert Downey Jr's portrayal of Julian and his current woes - and, if I'm not mistaken, I seem to recall an interview somewhere way back when where he stated that in order to 'get into the part' he went out and did every drug he could get his hands on; and that that is when and where he developed his habit. Talk about a commitment to playing a part! Whether this is fact or fiction, he does one helluva convincing job portraying a seriously addicted/strung out junkie! I would have to agree with those who say they feel that Downey and Spader 'steal the show'. They both do great jobs. As for Andrew. . . well I think he did a more than adequate role of portraying the guy who probably dabbled in partying during high school and then ran off to college and tried to 'go straight'.
Also, for those that would dis the movie based on the fact they feel that kids that age wouldn't shop where they did or drive classic corvettes - lets not forget these kids parents were apparently (thought the movie really never shows us their bank statements) Beverly Hills movers and shakers. I knew plenty of rich kids who drove fancey sports cars - IN High School.
Anyway, to sum up; taken at face value, (and in my own humble opinion)this movie gets three thumbs up from me :-)

That is about the best thing about this movie, it's really bad and really sucks!",1525564800,,344,4.476190476190476
7808925,4,6301006798,"I just recently watched Less Than Zero again and decided to write a review, as I have noticed over the years that the movie is severely underappreciated.
The movie, by and large, is very well- acted.
Especially Spader, Downey and Andrew McCarthy.
The acting, coupled with the amazing music (both the head-bob-inducing songs and the incredibly atmospheric score by the great Thomas Newman) really make this movie stand out for me.
And the cinematography!
From the lavish camera pans/sweeps over the palm tree-lined avenues of Beverly Hills, to the lively and garish neon of the hopping Los Angeles nightclubs.
The amazing photography never stops from the very beginning, showcasing everything from the bustling nightlife, all the way to the amazing, blue-ish glow of swimming pools in the dark.
It really is a beautiful looking movie.

I am also well aware that the film definitely deviates from the original Easton Ellis novel, but I am not holding that against it.
I'm not sure the book would translate too well if adapted verbatim.
It's hard to get on anybody's side as it is.
Every character is morally reprehensible or morally ambiguous.
I think the changes made in the film work better for a movie.
It's the style and the actors who make these particular characters more relatable.

For people who sadly know what it's like to struggle with addiction, this movie will hit really close to home.
It only shows glimpses into the truly awful, seedy side of drug abuse.
It's not all glitz and glamour with the nice clothes, sexy cars and seemingly endless amounts of the white stuff.
But what it does show, is heartbreaking.
This movie needs to be seen by more people!

This is a quintessential piece of 1980's cinema.
It's in my top 10 movies from the 80's.
See it!

7808928,5,6301006798,"There is one (and only one) legitimate knock on this movie- the six-month timeline between high school graduation and Clay's return home for Christmas break and what transpires therein. Even in youth, six months is a short period for things to change and spiral as much as they did in the film. That aside, Less Than Zero is a great story with a great message. The direction and cinematography are outstanding, and the acting is superlative at best, adequate at worst. The anti-drug message is obvious, but there is so much more to this project and, thankfully, people are finally beginning to get it.
Unlike 1987, audiences and critics now recognize the exemplary talent of Robert Downey, Jr. and his effort as Julian is as good as, if not better than, anything he's ever done. Jami Gertz provides a close second, as the beautiful, rudderless Blair, who only begins to see the error of her ways after it's too late for Julian, and Andrew McCarthy's Clay is someone relatable to all who've ever tried to help a friend or loved one gone over the edge. James Spader was fantastic as Rip, the friend whose friendship eventually took a backseat to manipulation and ""business."" As presented here, Julian and Rip represented the sad end to the promise of the 1980's. Clay and Blair were the hapless witnesses to that end. And yet, if we replace the cocaine of yesterday with the prescription/ opioid abuse of today, it's not that hard to see that this movie is as relevant now as it was more than thirty years ago.
This is a truly great film about the dangers of addiction and the value of love, friendship, and forgiveness. A must-see!",1522627200,,1630,4.682926829268292

7808931,3,6301006798,"RELEASED IN 1987 and directed by Marek Kanievska, ""Less than Zero"" is a drama about a trio of rich 18 year-olds from Los Angeles. After graduation, one goes off to college (Andrew McCarthy), but returns for Christmas break wherein he finds his ex-girlfriend (Jami Gertz) and, especially, his buddy (Robert Downey Jr.) struggling with drug addiction in the Beverly Hills fast lane. James Spader plays a smug high society dealer.

This is the furthest thing from typical 80s youth flicks, like Fast Times at Ridgemont High, The Karate Kid, Valley Girl, Footloose and Cant Buy Me Love (where theres, admittedly, a lot of range). Less than Zero has the epic, artsy style of Francis Ford Coppola films like The Outsiders and Rumble Fish (both from 1983) meshed with the chic melancholy of Poison Ivy (1992).

My main issue is that it takes too long to get absorbed into the characters and their story. The filmmaking is gorgeous, however, which is ironic because this is a really downbeat movie. Gertz is fine, but she never did anything for me, while McCarthy is serviceable as the main protagonist, yet rather bland in a goody-goody way. Both Downey Jr. and Spader, however, de-shine in their roles (in a good way). If you favor arty, glum movies you might like this better than me, but its nowhere near as effective as Poison Ivy, a similar artsy, gloomy flick.

The movie runs 1 hour 38 minutes and was shot in the Los Angeles area, including Malibu. WRITERS: Bret Easton Ellis (novel) and Harley Peyton (screenplay)
