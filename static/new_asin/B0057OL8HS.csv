8460985,5,B0057OL8HS,"Yes, they don't make them like they used to, do they? Are there any doctors like Dr. Welby anymore. If I may I'll answer that one myself, NO.
 I have quite a few of Robert Young's old films from the 1930s and 1940s. What a wonderful presence he had.
 And I just have to mention a few things about Elena Verdugo who plays the nurse/secretary of the office.
 She played a beautiful gypsy girl who is in a great dance scene in the movie ' House of Frankenstein' made in 1944 when she was all of 19 years old. She becomes the tragic love interest of Lon Chaney Jr. AKA the wolfman.  Boy, was she beautiful and could she dance.
 She is still alive as of this writing and is 89 years young!",1424563200,2,684,4.112781954887218

8460987,1,B0057OL8HS,"This is a subset of season one. That should be in the advertisement. If you have seen season one, then you already have this. The quality and viewing is fine; my complaint is that the DVD ad seems misleading.",1416787200,9,208,4.358974358974359
