7847114,4,6303450873,"An intelligent and well done overview, giving a sense of the many amazing steps Malcolm took over the evolution of his life.  And perhaps that was the most admirable thing of all about the man; the fact that he kept learning, growing, changing all through his life.  He allowed his strongest beliefs and loyalties to stay open to challenges, something all the human race could gain from.

I only had two minor difficulties with the film.  With a life this rich and complex, even two and a half hours feels a bit rushed, a bit sped through.  Theres a reason his autobiography runs almost 500 pages.  I missed hearing more about the human sides of the man, what he was like away from the crowds.  And even much of the public Malcolm, the leader, the speaker, by nature gets a bit of a readers digest treatment.  I don't really blame the filmmaker.  Malcolms life was complex enough that more screen time would likely have been the only way to do any better.

The other thing, perhaps related to the above, was that it didn't have quite the emotional impact -- at least for me -- of Spike Lees bio-pic.  Im not sure if thats a testament to how strong Lees film was, or a sign of something missing in this documentary.  But generally  its much more common for me to respond to the reality of a documentary, rather than the dramatized version of the same story.  For me, this was a rare exception.  The sense of understanding, admiration, and loss I felt with Lees film was somehow stronger.

None-the-less, this is still an excellent, informative and well-made sweeping portrait of the life of one of the more important people of the 20th century.  Sadly, its now out-of-print, and almost impossible to find.",1390780800,,1704,4.589403973509934
7847115,5,6303450873,"**I read that one person gave this documentary one(1) star.  Malcolm once said ""That's a Negro that is out-of-their mind.""  This documentary is a 5 star out of a 5 star rating. What makes this documentary so 'great' is hearing other folks, family , friends, and historians give a account of the most important black historical person I've ever studied. Malcolm's intelligence and speeches will make your head spin! No one, not even the great Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. can produce a speech like Malcolm X --- ""You can sit next to white folks on the toilet"" is part of a speech on integrating public restrooms. Malcolm's humor was amazing! We are very, very fortunate to have access to Malcolm's many speeches -- CD's, VHF, Cassettes, LP's, DVD's,  Laser-disc, and maybe even on the old school ""8 track tapes"" Malcolm X speeches and video's are numerous and plentiful for new generations to see and hear this 'Super Human'  ***** Smitty Ditty Detroit City",1369785600,,954,4.798780487804878
7847116,5,6303450873,This documentary on the life and death of El Hajj Malik El Shabazz (Malcolm X) is the one I would choose to leave as a record for my children as to what happened during this period of time in our history as African Americans in this country.  I select it probably because I personally knew most of the people in it or mentioned in it.  I am only 58 years old at the time of this review however I grew up in the Nation of Islam.  My father served directly under Captain Joseph X (Yusuf Shah) as a head investigator on his staff.  In 1962 as a 10 year old(Jr. Fruit) I sat under Minister Malcolm and listened to him intently as he rocked my young world with the reality of American life and what it meant to Black folk.  It is surreal to watch Captain Joseph talk about Malcolm in this documentary because in real life I watched the two of them interact during friendlier times while Malcolm was alive.  The period during which these men lived is a special time in the history of this nation.  This documentary comes closer than any other that I've seen that captures this period on film. The scene I cherish most in this documentary is the one where both Minister Malcolm and Minister Farrakhan and others can be seen with the Honorable Elijah Muhammad in Chicago as he tries on a fez which they had purchased for him.,1284854400,,1317,4.329268292682927
7847117,5,6303450873,"I went to the library, and borrowed 5-6 tapes on Malcolm X.  Out of all of them, including the Spike Lee movie, this one is *THE* best.  We even showed it at our University twice because it was so good. Includes aspects of the history such as the ""Fruit of Islam"" and other little tidbits you won't see in the other documentaries!",1066003200,10,330,4.306451612903226
7847118,1,6303450873,"This is typical of the modern style of documentary.  Very little of the actual subject matter -Malcolm X, rarely shows up on his own tape.  Instead of showing Malcolm himself speaking, they give us OTHER people telling us what a great speaker Malcolm was.  Rather than having Malcolm explain himself, we have a variety of ""experts"" explaining Malcolm's beliefs.  When you finish watching a tape like this, you can't understand what all the fuss over this guy is about.  You don't get a sense of his personality or charisma.
Its really annoying how John Henrick Clarke, Joseph X and others are allowed to speak sentence after sentence about Malcolm, but when a clip of Malcolm himself is shown, its often cut after only one sentence.
A much better choice is ""Malcolm X: His Own Story as it Really Happened"" which was made back in 1972 when the trend in documentraies was to include as much of the original subject mattera as possible.",1027209600,26,933,4.734567901234568
7847119,5,6303450873,"This is one of the few Malcolm X documentaries that does not require previous reading on the subject to understand what is going on (the also-good ""Biography"" segment does a good job too). It should , however, inspire you to read some more afterward.",1011139200,3,250,4.704545454545454
