8025874,4,B0002C7ZAE,"I just received and watched this today.  I also have a previous version put out by PRS in August of 2010.  That version contains Mrs. Wiggs, Earthworm Tractors, The Golf Specialist and The Fatal Glass of Beer.  This version is head and shoulders above the one put out by PRS.  Granted, it's still an on demand dvd copy of a VHS, but a much better copy.  Don't hesitate if you love the film.  If you have the other copy, buy this one and throw that one out.",1413417600,2,456,4.183908045977011
8025875,5,B0002C7ZAE,Hard to find video.  My parents enjoyed getting this one since their old one had broken. Recommended for those who enjoy old movies!,1399680000,,132,4.739130434782608
8025876,3,B0002C7ZAE,"This is a fun old story from a book written around 1903. It shows what life was like, how poor people existed, and what some rich people did because they decided they wanted to help. I enjoyed the story, but the quality of this VHS was horrible. I recommend the DVD instead if you want to get it.",1361059200,,296,4.120689655172414
8025877,5,B0002C7ZAE,"This movie is from the 30s I believe and if you have never seen a good family movie of yesteryear, sit down with your family and watch how times were back then. You will enjoy this both funny and sad movie of people living on near nothing and how tough life was back in the day for some folks.  This is a very heartwarming story and deserves 5 stars.  It is a true classic.",1307664000,,373,4.027027027027027
8025878,2,B0002C7ZAE,"W.C. Fields belatedly appears in the final two reels of this creaky 1934 melodrama, which disappointed many fans when it was first shown on television. As ""mail-order husband"" C. Ellsworth Stubbins, the Great Man shines in his small role - displaying immediate chemistry with the one-and-only ZaSu Pitts. Too bad ""Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch"" was their sole film together. Fields completists will discover a few priceless moments after hitting the fast-forward button.",1270598400,,472,5.391891891891892
8025879,3,B0002C7ZAE,"Mrs. Wiggs Of The Cabbage Patch was based on a novel, about the exploits of a fatherless family trying to survive, at least through Thanksgiving. Starring Pauline Lord, she plods on with her little brood, looking hopefully to the future. If the story ended with this, then we wouldn't be noting it here.

Paramount had to do something to liven it up, and make it more worthy, so they added a few trump cards, notably W.C. Fields and Zasu Pitts, with a budding romance between the two to make things a bit more interesting. That worked. Pitts is now just a remembered funny name of movies, but we tend to forget that her career was long, fruitful and funny, all of the way into television. Her sense of comic timing was legendary. Bill Fields in his role is somewhat subdued, but as a supporting actor, he dresses up the production greatly. Let's not give anything away here, but this is why I have a copy! Now on DVD-R.",1172620800,8,919,4.470238095238095
8025880,2,B0002C7ZAE,"You have to love Fields to go through this, and he is pretty good in a film of pretty horrible material. heart-tugging piffle is what it is, although the lady who plays the man-desperate spinster is pretty good and she nets Fields through a catalog. Pauline Lord, well known on stage, sinks the ship time and again, but actually has a curious affecting -- and affected -- way about her. Fields, according to his recent bio, didn't think much of this and he knew his material. If you've seen everything and you're down to this, by all means, kill a few hours, but, really, if you haven't been to the classics, do not tread here at all.",1126742400,,634,4.427350427350428
