7658559,4,B01BKM0Z60,"UPDATED February 2, 2017:
This S9 Blu-ray release, like the S8/S7 releases, is an Amazon exclusive with regular pressed (not burned) discs, no slipcover, simplistic menu, and no UV (streaming) codes.  Lionsgate tried to cut down their costs to make it financially feasible for them to release the last few seasons.  What you DO get is the full season uncut (with one big exception), in HD quality, with the remaining post-season movie as an extra (they released the other 2 movies on S8).  Here are the notes on this release:

1) Despite the claim that the episodes are all uncut, like a few of the seasons before, there is a major exception on this set, though this is definitely the worst cut in all of the seasons (followed closely by S7's Divorce episode).  The episode in this set is ""Home Again"" and it is missing almost 4 minutes.  This episode as listed only as ""Home Again"", however, it actually is 2-parts and mid-way through credits roll and then the 2nd part starts.  The missing footage is supposed to be at the end of Part 1/beginning of Part 2 and it's semi-important.  While the remaster does add some other footage not in the previous old edited DVD release from Imavision, the old Imavision DVD did have the footage that is missing here.  On this new remaster, Part 1 ends with Albert planning to substitute morphine. On the old release, there's a whole scene with him then delivering medical supplies to Doc Baker who examines the contents of the box and then tells a nervous Albert where to find the key that he can use anytime he wants to come in and read his medical books (this is notable given the final narration scene of the episode). Then Albert runs off and has an interaction with Charles & Mr. Edwards.  In addition to this episode, there is also some possible (unverified) edits to the ""Bless All The Dear Children"" movie, which on-the-surface appears to be missing somewhere around 40 seconds as compared to the old DVD release (based solely on examining runtime after factoring in the 20 seconds of logos that appear at the end of the old DVD release but not the new).  I'm not convinced it actually is missing footage though - it could be a conversion issue of the old where some frames were duplicated thus adding to more time.
2) The video bitrates are respectably high (avg 25-32mbps) and while it looks better than S7 (which had more ""faded look"" problems on some eps), like S8, some episodes (especially the first one) seem to have a higher degree of grain or compression artifacts (I can't tell which).  I've compared with the Digital HD streaming and the streaming, while not having nearly as high bitrates, appears to not have the same degree of this and honestly to my eyes may overall look slightly better, which is something I never thought regarding S1-6.  Overall though, this season still looks very good on Blu (much better than DVD), though the quality is variable.  I watched the first episode and was less than impressed, but then I watched the episode ""Welcome to Olesonville"" and was astounded at the clarity and colors just as I have with many episodes from earlier seasons.
3) The audio, like S7&8 before it, is Dolby Digital with a 448k bitrate.  That bitrate is perfectly fine - it's actually a high bitrate for what basically amounts to a mono audio track.  The real problem with the audio on S7/8 wasn't the bitrate or that it wasn't lossless like S1-6 (although lossless would have been nice), but the fact that the audio was mastered too high and with a different EQ that ended up producing clipping artifacts (which most probably wouldn't notice unless listening through headphones).  I'm pleased to say that it appears they fixed this for S9 - it sounds closer to what we got on S1-6.
4) The subtitle timing, which had been an issue with S7, is better than S7, but not as good as it is on S8.  It's ""okay"" but not perfect.
5) French/Spanish language tracks are in sync (unlike S7).
6) There are chapter stops after the opening theme like S1-6&8 have (but S7 did not).

Some people might quibble about the movie choice included as an extra on this season.  It does seem sort of silly since anyone that's a fan of the show knows that the ""real end"" to the show is the movie ""The Last Farewell"".  Lionsgate put that movie and ""Look Back To Yesterday"" as extras on S8 and put ""Bless All The Dear Children"" on S9.  Personally I think it was silly to put ANY movies on S8 since they ALL take place timeline-wise post-S9, but it's especially odd that they didn't at least put Last Farewell on S9.  Their logic I'm sure came down to wanting to provide extras for both 8&9 (to increase the perceived value of both sets) and when it came to figuring which movies to put on which season, they understandably (but wrongly) went by broadcast order (air date), not production order. ""Bless All The Dear Children"" was technically originally broadcast AFTER ""The Last Farewell"" even though Last Farewell is the true end to the show with it's very memorable ending to the entire show.  In any event, Lionsgate should still be applauded for giving us these movies at all with the season sets rather than making us pay separately for them, which is what the former distributor (Imavision) made us do with the old terrible DVD's!

All in all, this release is relatively good but like earlier seasons (esp 7&8) is a bit of a mixed bag.  Considering that there was much uncertainty for a few months regarding the Blu-ray's when Lionsgate stopped the retail releases of them after S6, I do give Lionsgate props for listening to the fans and finding an alternate way to put the rest out and not leave the fans hanging - thank you Lionsgate!  The S7-9 releases may have various issues, but they are still better than nothing which is what the alternative was going to be.

With this S9 release, the entire remastered series has now been released, with the exception of ""Little House Years"" which was a 3-hour flashback clip-show that originally aired during S6 and has remained unreleased on any format.  It's unfortunate that they missed this when releasing the S6 set (or they could have easily made THAT the special feature for S8 and then correctly put all the movies on S9!).  I know some people really care about the lack of release and honestly I did too, until I actually watched it and realized that in my opinion while it would have been good for them to include, it's not a huge deal.  It's almost entirely flashback-clips with just some wrap-around scenes with the family at the dinner table, and those wrap-around scenes are NOT that exciting and contain some less-than-stellar acting IMHO.  Still, for completeness sake, it would have been nice.

Regarding all of these new remastered releases in general: Overall they have been wonderful and so much better than what was out there before.  However, I do think it a bit disingenuous for Lionsgate to call something the complete series (as they do in the boxset) or portray releases as uncut, when the reality is that several seasons have had an episode or two missing a scene.  Or as in the case of S7's ""Divorce"" episode this season's Home Again, several minutes worth of scenes.  And it isn't the complete series without the Little House Years special.  Still, we've probably gotten about as good as we are going to for the foreseeable future.

Just as further general information for anyone interested, here is the list of all the issues I am aware of with the new remasters for all seasons.  But first a reminder that despite these issues, the remasters are still MUCH better overall than the old DVD sets were.

These are the issues I am aware of in all the remastered seasons:
- S1 episode ""Family Quarrel"" has the wrong subtitles (incorrectly had the Christmas episode subs) - subsequent pressings may have fixed this as they did issue a replacement disc shortly after S1 was released.
- S1 episode Country Girls is missing a ~20 second part where the Kennedy boy reads his summer poem
- S1 episode ""Child of Pain"" is seemingly missing about 1 minute (scenes unknown)
- S1 episode ""To See the World"" is seemingly missing about 1 minute (scenes unknown)
- S2 episode ""Remember Me Pt 1"" ends abruptly with new overlayed ""to be continued"" type notice.
- S6 episode ""Whatever Happened to the Class of '56"" is possibly missing about 15 seconds (scenes unknown)
- S6 episode ""Darkness is My Friend"" is possibly missing about 30 seconds (scenes unknown).
- S7 ""Divorce, Walnut Grove Style"" is missing 3 minutes (a different glass scene among others)
- S7 subtitles being a tad off. Not a huge deal for the most part, but annoying and occasionally a bigger issue depending on the timing of dialogue in a scene.
- S7 French/Spanish audio not synced up with the video
- S7 in general doesn't look quite as good as previous seasons and some of the episodes are rather faded looking, but this appears to be a source issue
- S7 & S8 audio was mastered too high and the audio thus produces ""clipping"" sometimes which can lead to annoying artifacts in the audio
- S9 ""Home Again"" episode missing 3:45 of footage (as described above).
- Movie ""The Last Farewell"" - in the final triumphant scene capping the entire series as a whole where the townpeople are singing a triumphant hymn, the English audio was mixed incorrectly and you can barely hear them singing. The Spanish/French audio do not have this problem (the song is in English and there's no further dialog so one can alternatively just switch tracks when the townspeople start singing).
- Movie ""Bless All The Dear Children"" is possibly missing about 40 seconds (as described above).
- Overall video imperfections on specific episodes. For instance S7 episode 1 has more specks/flecks in the picture. Or S4's ""The Stranger"" which has real grainy opening scenes (presumably from stock footage they used).

Again, though, even with these problems, in the big picture, the remasters are still way better than what was previously out there.",1455148800,46,9990,4.68246716162193
7658560,1,B01BKM0Z60,"I gave up on Blu-ray with season 8, so I'm not playing their game with season 9 this time around. For some illogical reason, the first and third TV movies were included with season 8, and the second TV movie is included with season 9, so casual viewers will find the story in confusing order and will have the ending spoiled for them. They even blatantly advertise their poor decisions by plastering on the front which movie it includes. Listed as a 5 disc set in the description, but the package art says 6. The ineptitudes never end.",1455148800,3,535,4.469387755102041
7658561,4,B01BKM0Z60,"Finally .... the final season is here and my fears that we will not get the missing little house years episodes not also in this set came true.
 se get here the third and final post tv movie (the other two are in season 8 as extras) but unfortunately we will never get those special eposodes that we hoped we could get with this new release.
 Also those are not in the new box set which has all those 9 new remastered editions.
 I just hope we will get those great flashbacks episodes which were first broadcasted in the middle of season 6 sometime in the near future as a seperate release cause THEY DESERVE TO BE IN OUR COLLECTION.

  ps.

 Those few fans remained who are still loyal to blu ray no need to worry as this will come out to blu ray eventually like it happened with season 8.",1455062400,9,790,4.185430463576159

The 2-part episode where Albert is addicted to morphine is edited! On the dvd,  part one stops cold after Albert goes to the kitchen and steals the can of powdered sugar that he plans to use to substitute the morphine. THIS IS NOT HOW THE FIRST PART ENDS! Albert nervously delivers the box of medical supplies to Doc Baker who examines the contents of the box then proceeds to tell a nervous Albert where to find the key that he can use anytime he wants to come in and read Doc's medical books. Then Albert runs off. That is how part one actually ends. ALL OF THIS IS EDITED OUT OF THIS SO CALLED RESTORED TO BROADCAST LENGTH DVDS WE NOW HAVE. And just to frustrate fans even more, this whole scene is fully intact on the previously released NBC edited/syndicated DVDs",1462233600,28,792,4.462068965517242

Thanks also to the fans who pushed lionsgate into changing there minds on 7/8/9 to blu ray
Quality fantastic bit rate on episodes I've seen vary from 25/38

Yes things were sacrificed but in the end lionsgate did what they could do rectify the disappointed fans at end of 2015

Again as with 7/8 this will play on region b players as well as a presume c as well but unless someone knows different please speak up",1461715200,3,475,4.325842696629214
7658707,5,B01BKM0Z60,Season 9 looks as good as seasons 7 & 8. But it does not have the crystal clear polished look season 1 through 6 have. The only difference is season 9 still looks nice and clear but it has film grain like you'd expect from a movie or tv series shot on film. Even with the film grain it looks very clear and looks great on blu-ray. The amount of film grain present in the picture does not take away from the enjoyment of the episodes in any way. One important thing to note is that amazon.com lists Season 9 as being manufactured on demand. It is a professionally pressed 6 disc set and not BD-r. So it will play in any U.S. blu-ray player. I was completely satisfied with this box set and have given it 5 stars.,1461369600,8,711,4.122302158273381

Personally I prefer the more lighthearted themes of the earlier seasons, but I wanted to complete the series. Still makes good family viewing.

8750405,5,B01BKM0Z60,"As a child my wife's favorite afternoon TV show was Little House on the Prairie. In our area we watched it on Channel 9 kmsp-tv Minneapolis St. Paul"". They were the Independent station at the time, broadcasting many syndicated shows and cartoons long after the original series was cancelled. So 5 days a week after school little House on the Prairie was on. On the weekends, if there was no AWA All-Star wrestling or other local sporting program, you got a day full of  little house, syndicated cartoons like Woody Woodpecker and Tom and Jerry, The Incredible Hulk live action series, as well as the strange but compelling series Grizzly Adams. In the late 1980's Channel 9 became the first Fox affiliate in our area,  then became Prime Time Entertainment Network PTEN when Fox moved to KITN Channel 29. During that era the old syndicated television shows still aired on Channel 9, but you could tell they were slowly disappearing. The era of Independent stations was slowly dying, with more and more syndicated shows ending up on cable and exclusive to those channels. To be honest I don't know where Little House on the Prairie ended up, I believe the last broadcast on channel 9 was in 1990, but then again I wasn't a fan. Besides life, work, kids, video games, friends and family all that stuff takes priority over chasing down an old TV show you watched as a kid.  Also, there's no book or website chronicling the complete broadcast history of any television show. That would be stupid. Regardless, this is my wife's favorite show. When I watch them I go back to feeling like I'm a little kid who can't go outside to play because of bad weather, and I'm stuck watching whatever is on TV. Not that they're not good episodes, in fact many of them were great,  but for some reason I'm always expecting a national weather service storm warning alert to appear in the middle of an episode somewhere.
This kind of got off track of reviewing the series, and yes I probably have seen every single episode of Little House on the Prairie. Every time she starts a DVD I say oh yeah that one oh yeah that one oh yeah that one. Then she tells me to shut up.

In conclusion,  Buy it, it's still good to and should be forced down the throats of the Netflix generation. Good stories with moral implications, characters who aren't naked or having sex with anyone and anything, nobody's high on drugs or celebrating marijuana. None of them are hookers with a heart of gold or gentle caring murderers. And there is no swearing every three seconds, or in nine years for that matter.  In other words, kids today won't like it.",1528761600,,2610,4.587982832618025
