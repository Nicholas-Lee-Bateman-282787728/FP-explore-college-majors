Takashi Miike is [censored for Amazon consumption] insane. Anyone who's watched a handful of Takashi Miike movies knows this. And yet it never fails to surprise me. The most recent evidence of this, at least in my household (I'm pretty far behind in my Miike viewing) is Zebraman, which is basically Kick-Ass for Japanese audiences from six years ago. (Did no one make that connection? Really?)

Zebraman focuses on Shinichi (Miike regular Sho Aikawa), a teacher who's pretty much a personal and professional failure. In order to escape from the stress of his everyday life, at night he enjoys dressing up as Zebraman, a cartoon superhero from his childhood days. At one point early in the new term, a transfer student named Segawa (Kabei: Our Mother's Koen Kondo) joins Shinichi's class. It turns out Segawa, as well, remembers Zebraman, and gives Shinichi the courage to actually take his superhero act to the streets--where he finds out he's the only person standing in the way of an imminent alien invasion. He'd better get to practicing that Zebra Screw Punch...

Screenwriter Kankuro Kudo (Kisarazu Cat's Eye) had one heck of a year in 2004, both with this, which was written directly for the screen, and with his adaptation of Ryu Murakami's novel 69 for Sang-il Lee. Both were big hits in Japan (interestingly, Miike has also done a Murakami adaptation, and both Miike and Lee were catapulted to fame outside Japan thanks to those films; Miike's was Audition). And I don't think it's a spoiler to reveal my rating early in the review, but both are well worth your time. Miike continues to push the boundaries of what we think of as a Takashi Miike film; he was doing it as early as the mid-nineties, but that envelope now being a shapeless mass hasn't stopped him in the least. In a two-year period, he made a costume drama (Sabu), a traditional ghost/demon story (Gozu), this superhero comedy, a straight-up Japanese New Horror flick (One Missed Call), a bunch of the yakuza movies upon which he made his name (including the well-regarded Deadly Outlaw: Rekka and the, um, less well-regarded Yakuza Demon), and the last (and best) of the Dead or Alive martial arts flicks. And that's about half his output for those two years. All are at least worth seeing, though obviously they're not all destined to be classics. (Personally, Sabu is my favorite of the bunch; it's one of my all-time favorite Miike movies. But I'm in the minority.) It's a lot of fun. It's also incredibly stupid, so be warned, but you'll have a ball killing your brain cells. ** ",1281052800,,2591,4.828828828828829
3037818,5,B000Z6GT72,"""Zebraman"" is a hilarious comic book satire film from director Takashi Miike! This came as an absolute surprise to me--I'm sad to say I'm not usually what one would call a ""Miike"" fan. His movies simply aren't, usually, my thing. However, this film proved that I can never completely ignore a director so open-minded and imaginative.

From the special features of this particular DVD set(2), I learned some fascinating facts about the film, and more specifically, the lead actor:  Sho Aikawa. His performance in ""Zebraman"" actually marked his 100th role as a lead actor in a film, which I was given to understand is especially uncommon in Japan. One of the special features is an interview with him, while another follows his experience.

Another great thing about the special features was the amount of Behind the Scenes footage you got to see compared to American filmmakers' interpretations of the same with their films. With ""Zebraman"" they showed the whole process--good and bad--the long hours, the injuries, the exhaustion, the little things...truly it was fascinating. I almost felt like I was on set watching the filming. Whereas with American versions of Behind the Scenes previews and Making Of clips, I've only ever seen glimpses, prepped interviews, or very limited views of anything else. For me, the Special Edition was worth buying just for that experience, if nothing else.

If you're not one for satire, or you can't take comic book humor, this movie wouldn't be for you. However, if the two appeal to you, and you happen to love Japanese movies as well, this movie will rock your world!

""Zebraman"" is the funniest movie I've seen in months!!!",1261094400,9,1662,4.985559566787003
3037819,4,B000Z6GT72,"Takashi Miike--the acclaimed director of such nail-biting horror films such as ""Audition"" and ""Gozu"", such  gritty yakuza-themed films such as ""Dead or Alive"" and ""Fudoh"", the cult-hit ""Ichi the Killer"", his contribution was banned from the Showtime ""Masters of Horror"" series for ""Imprint""--one wouldn't be hard-pressed to assume that Miike is only capable of such macabre and violent films. Nope, Takashi Miike is actually better known in his native land for his ""family-friendly"" films such as ""the Great Yokai War"", and this film, ""ZEBRAMAN"". This film is Takashi Miike's comedic parody of the superhero genre.

Shinichi Ichikawa (Sho Aikawa) is a grade school teacher. He is a humble man, with some major family issues--his wife is cheating on him, his daughter Midori (Yui Ichikawa) doesn't respect him and his youngest son is being bullied at school just because he is his son. Back in 1978, he is also obsessed with a TV show called Zebraman which is set in 2010, now when that year rolls around, Shinichi attempts to escape his issues by fashioning himself a ""zebra man"" costume and begins to play the character at night. What began as escapism, soon becomes a bizarre reality as a monster from the original show actually appears. Shinichi finally realizes that his beloved TV show wasn't fantasy but a prophecy foretold. And now, dressing up as Zebraman, he elects himself its fulfillment. Now, he has little choice but to take the role seriously as hostile aliens does surface and he must protect the people of Japan!

The film's strength lies in its energetic direction. The film may seem rather comical and silly in many ways but the ""cheesiness"" and goofy feel is a main part of its premise. Appreciating the occasional cheesy sequences is just a matter of being in the correct state of mind. The premise of the movie is rather simple but the energy and pacing of the film's structure does keep it from becoming too predictable, it maintains an interesting quality throughout. The film also has a theme--as with believing in yourself and Miike's doesn't hold back on some social and political commentary, very subtle and not entirely obvious until the final act. While it doesn't deliver everything with a straight face, the film's main message is self-reliance and it does somewhat condemn the use of nuclear arms.

The film's action is rather ""cartoonish"" and comical; it is meant to be this way. The costumes looked very inspired by Japanese serials such as ""Ultraman"" and the action contains some martial arts also reminiscent of the series. The villains are your usual men in rubber suits and they move as they would in such TV series. There is some CGI images and the aliens have that ""Flubber""-like look but they do look menacing in a very cartoon-like manner. The film is decently acted and I really had fun watching its odd touches of humor.

Honestly, the film is the type of experience not to be taken seriously and one may miss the importance of exactly what it is trying to say--""Believe in yourself and your dreams will come true"" is the film's powerful message. Miike is telling his audience that self reliance and hard work is always the answer and dependence on an outside force may prove to be disastrous. After all, Japan is a country that had suffered an atomic attack, but it managed to still become an economic powerhouse after the 2nd world war. Sakinichi's friendship with a young boy on a wheelchair named Shinpei Asano (Naoki Yasukochi) is the strong catalyst for his resolve. His mother, a hard working single mother (played by beauteous Kyoka Suzuki) also adds a lot of needed humanity as Shinichi imagines her as ""Zebra-Nurse"". (What the heck?) Oh, yes, as with most Japanese films, I've seen in this genre, it does have a good number of scenes which made me say: ""What the Heck?!""

All in all, this may not be one of my favorites from Takashi Miike, but I do appreciate what it was trying to do. The film does leave certain aspects of its plot undefined as to Shinichi's newly acquired powers, but I guess the answers are there if you look hard enough (the manga it inspired never had Zebraman gain any real powers). Some elements were also underdeveloped (you barely see his wife and daughter) and the final act of the film is definitely those very used to the ""Ultraman"" style and it is NOT for everybody. Still, Miike's energetic direction kept the film grounded and the film is never boring. ""Zebraman"" isn't one of Miike's best but it does stand well as a testament to this director's versatility.

Recommended! To fans of Japanese cinema [3  Stars]",1235088000,7,4598,4.818757921419518
3037820,5,B000Z6GT72,"I've only ever seen two of Miike's films, Great Yokai War and this one. I dare say, it's one of the best comedies to ever come out of Japan. I think it should be made apparent that this is far from a kid flick. I believe it was more meant for the fist and second generation Tokusatsu fans who grew up with Kamen Rider and other Henshin heroes. The main hero is a guy who grew up idolizing the underdog of these heroes, Zebraman, whose show flopped after six episodes. Through his interaction with a young boy who through miricle of the Internet had rediscovered his hero, the hero finds the power within himself to become a true hero.

My favorite part of the film is the climatic final battle where Zebraman ascends and becomes a true superhero. The very purpose of this scene is to parrellel the contemporary movement in Japanese media to bring back and modernize classical superheroes with a newer and more high grade appearance. It has been done to Ultraman, Kamen Rider, and even Lion Maru.

Zebraman is worth watching, both for fans of the henshin hero genre, but also those who like comedy. the English voice cast was also pretty okay as far as quality.",1222300800,6,1160,4.519047619047619
3037821,4,B000Z6GT72,"""Zebraman"" is a male fantasy fairytale involving a repressed/milquetoast's attempts to embody the characteristics of his favorite TV series character (a not so popular 'Zebraman' who survived 8 episoides.) The idea of this film is pretty good, actually, and if I was still in Hollyweird I might be tempted to try to develop this.  The plot, however, falls apart and is predictable in the last third of the film (which doesn't however, impact too much the enjoyability level.  It's supposed to be cliched and comfortable - not like the usually disturbing Miike fare.)

Miike, suprisingly, always works well with young actors, but his low-key male lead is also nuanced here.  The film is slow, allowing emotional involvement with the characters (doesn't always pull it off but it tries.)

The 'force' payoff (where Zebraman learns to fly based upon his belief system and the faith of a young boy) is pretty lame, but I think it's supposed to be.  More interesting is the surrogate family Zebraman adopts (it threatens to explode into infidelity - in this, a kid's film?)

While this film is a mixed tonal bag at times, it's ultimately warm and nostalgic, very pro-human at it's core.  Worth seeing, even if the story is a little wayward and the 'family fare' a little 'too adult.'",1195776000,9,1278,4.8842592592592595

3037823,5,B000Z6GT72,"I hate Power Rangers, but love the aesthetic of the physical effects used in that genre of show. Zebraman respects that genre in a tongue and cheek manner while providing love for the genre through the eyes of a dedicated fanboy. The fanboy, failed in most life pursuits, is lovable and followable as his exploits become surreal.

His son is bullied by the other students, his teenaged  daughter is sleeping with a unknown man that she met online, and his wife is cheating on him. So he creates a Zebraman costume on starts prowling the streets at night, until after he defeats his first bad guy.

3037829,4,B000Z6GT72,"When Takashi Miike was selected to direct Show Aikawa's 100th film, we should've realized it wasn't going to be a safe collaboration. Welcome to ZEBRAMAN or, as it's fondly called in my household, Takashi Miike's theater of silly capers. Miike, just to show he can, veers away from his patented sicko films and creepy horror pictures and crafts a fun, offbeat spoof of the superhero cinema. The hero name is ridiculous. The theme song is incongruous. The narrative flow isn't smooth. Once again Takashi Miike plays with structure and tone. After all, he wouldn't want you to take him for granted.

Strange things are afoot in Yokohama. A crime wave imposes a reign of terror on the worried citizens. Not that these alarming events trigger the drastic change in Shinichi Ichikawa (Show Aikawa). A meek third grade schoolteacher and a family man disrespected in his own home, Mr. Ichikawa toils in abject misery. As a form of escapism, he obsesses on a superhero television show called ZEBRAMAN that aired back in 1978 for a mere seven episode run. ZEBRAMAN folds nicely into those early tokusatsu shows (ULTRAMAN, KAMEN RIDER, the SUPER SENTAI series, etc.), except that the ZEBRAMAN show took place in the year 2010. Mr. Ichikawa's pastime has now evolved to his having sewn together a Zebraman costume. He's posing in the privacy of his home. He's contemplating venturing out on night patrols.

One evening, while in costume, Mr. Ichikawa decides to go on a soda run. But, as he creeps out in the streets, he runs into a violent perp in a crab mask. Forced to fight, Mr. Ichikawa is astounded to learn that he's somehow developed the amazing abilities of his superhero idol. Well, this changes everything.

As time goes on, Shinichi Ichikawa begins to take on the physical attributes of his alter ego. Embarassingly, his hair assumes a decidedly mane-like aspect. And yet the largest shock arrives when he discovers that his revered 1970s show may in fact be a secret prophecy, with him destined to play the role of Zebraman. Just in time to fend off an alien invasion. The year now is 2010. When if not now, Mr. Ichikawa, to overcome that timidness and perfect that piercing stare?

Although there are very decent action sequences, ZEBRAMAN is far from a conventional superhero flick, not with Takashi Miike at the helm. There's a strong satiric streak running thru the narrative. Sometimes the humor comes from left field. Sometimes, it's very broad. The story introduces a sub-plot concerning an M.I.B.-type pair of government agents deployed to investigate a possible extraterrestrial encroachment, except that these guys are frequently played for laughs. Their chief gets injured so much that, by the end of the film, he looks like the Mummy. The villains look grotesque, except that it's hard to take someone like Crabman seriously. And then there's the passage which awesomely unveils... Zebranurse!!!

Show Aikawa is a marvel. He puts his stamp all over the place. He plays it straight but he makes you laugh. And yet he moves you in the quieter moments. He busted his what making this film, and it's fun to witness the arc his character undergoes. Deep in the film, when Zebraman turns a goon into a human pretzel, you believe that the often bullied Mr. Ichikawa is entirely capable of it. Show Aikawa convinces you.

3037830,4,B000Z6GT72,"Believe it or not, I found out about this film in Otaku,USA(a magazine dedicated to all things Japanese). Zebraman is a 2004 film about Shinichi Ichikawa, who-in every sense of the word-is a failure. He lives with a cheating wife, a daughter who digs older men and a son who's bullied at school just because of the fact that Shinichi teaches third grade there.  Escaping from everyday life, Shinichi secretly dresses up as ""Zebraman"", the title character from an unpopular 1970's tokusatsu TV series he watched as a child. A rash of crimes and murders happen around the school where he teaches so, when he dresses up as Zebraman to surprise a good friend who's also into the character, Shinichi unexpectedly gets caught up in a battle with a serial killer dressed up in a crab mask who actually exhibits real superpowers. Little does he know that he's stepped into something much bigger.

The superhero angle was what sold me on getting this movie but, let me tell you, it is so much more. I've never seen one Japanese film that ever made me laugh till Zebraman. It is downright hilarious.

I hear that there is a second film that follows up this first one, of which I aim on purchasing. If you love Japanese movies, comedies or superhero films..give Zebraman a look. I really enjoyed it.",1322611200,,1288,4.665198237885463

The arrival of a new student (Naoki Yasukochi) and a wave of bizarre events lead him to discover the power within.

This is not one of director Takashi Miike's ultraviolent films.  Instead, he has made a very bizarre comedy that is mostly family friendly, always compelling, and often extremely funny.

Oh, yes, as with most Japanese films, I've seen in this genre, it does have a good number of scenes which made me say: ""What the Heck?!""

All in all, this may not be one of my favorites from Takashi Miike, but I do appreciate what it was trying to do. The film does leave certain aspects of its plot undefined as to Shinichi's newly acquired powers, but I guess the answers are there if you look hard enough (the manga it inspired never had Zebraman gain any real powers). Some elements were also underdeveloped (you barely see his wife and daughter) and the final act of the film is definitely those very used to the ""Ultraman"" style and it is NOT for everybody. Still, Miike's energetic direction kept the film grounded and the film is never boring. ""Zebraman"" isn't one of Miike's best but it does stand well as a testament to this director's versatility.

3272317,5,B000Z6GT72,"I've only ever seen two of Miike's films, Great Yokai War and this one. I dare say, it's one of the best comedies to ever come out of Japan. I think it should be made apparent that this is far from a kid flick. I believe it was more meant for the fist and second generation Tokusatsu fans who grew up with Kamen Rider and other Henshin heroes. The main hero is a guy who grew up idolizing the underdog of these heroes, Zebraman, whose show flopped after six episodes. Through his interaction with a young boy who through miricle of the Internet had rediscovered his hero, the hero finds the power within himself to become a true hero.

My favorite part of the film is the climatic final battle where Zebraman ascends and becomes a true superhero. The very purpose of this scene is to parrellel the contemporary movement in Japanese media to bring back and modernize classical superheroes with a newer and more high grade appearance. It has been done to Ultraman, Kamen Rider, and even Lion Maru.

Zebraman is worth watching, both for fans of the henshin hero genre, but also those who like comedy. the English voice cast was also pretty okay as far as quality.",1222300800,6,1160,4.519047619047619
3272318,4,B000Z6GT72,"""Zebraman"" is a male fantasy fairytale involving a repressed/milquetoast's attempts to embody the characteristics of his favorite TV series character (a not so popular 'Zebraman' who survived 8 episoides.) The idea of this film is pretty good, actually, and if I was still in Hollyweird I might be tempted to try to develop this.  The plot, however, falls apart and is predictable in the last third of the film (which doesn't however, impact too much the enjoyability level.  It's supposed to be cliched and comfortable - not like the usually disturbing Miike fare.)

Miike, suprisingly, always works well with young actors, but his low-key male lead is also nuanced here.  The film is slow, allowing emotional involvement with the characters (doesn't always pull it off but it tries.)

The 'force' payoff (where Zebraman learns to fly based upon his belief system and the faith of a young boy) is pretty lame, but I think it's supposed to be.  More interesting is the surrogate family Zebraman adopts (it threatens to explode into infidelity - in this, a kid's film?)

While this film is a mixed tonal bag at times, it's ultimately warm and nostalgic, very pro-human at it's core.  Worth seeing, even if the story is a little wayward and the 'family fare' a little 'too adult.'",1195776000,9,1278,4.8842592592592595

3272320,5,B000Z6GT72,"I hate Power Rangers, but love the aesthetic of the physical effects used in that genre of show. Zebraman respects that genre in a tongue and cheek manner while providing love for the genre through the eyes of a dedicated fanboy. The fanboy, failed in most life pursuits, is lovable and followable as his exploits become surreal. This is a hero tale with heart mixing fandom back into childhood dreams.",1398988800,3,402,4.757142857142857

Such as Spider-Man, Batman, Blue Beetle ,Black Panther,Robin, Raven, Nightwing, Hawkeye, and Falcon. And that's not all of them, there's WAY more than that. Anyway this movie stars veteran actor Show Aikawa as Shinichi a grade school teacher , who as a child back in 1978. Was obsessed with a Japanese tokusatsu t.v. show named Zebraman, which was set in the year 2010 . So when 2010 finally rolls around, he's living an unhappy life. The students that he teaches don't respect him, and neither does his family. His son is bullied by the other students, his teenaged  daughter is sleeping with a unknown man that she met online, and his wife is cheating on him. So he creates a Zebraman costume on starts prowling the streets at night, until after he defeats his first bad guy. He later finds out that the Zebraman t.v. show wasn't fake it was a prophecy fortold. And now he has to save the world form an alien invasion, I liked this movie cause in a way .

3272326,4,B000Z6GT72,"When Takashi Miike was selected to direct Show Aikawa's 100th film, we should've realized it wasn't going to be a safe collaboration. Welcome to ZEBRAMAN or, as it's fondly called in my household, Takashi Miike's theater of silly capers. Miike, just to show he can, veers away from his patented sicko films and creepy horror pictures and crafts a fun, offbeat spoof of the superhero cinema. The hero name is ridiculous. The theme song is incongruous. The narrative flow isn't smooth. Once again Takashi Miike plays with structure and tone. After all, he wouldn't want you to take him for granted.

Strange things are afoot in Yokohama. A crime wave imposes a reign of terror on the worried citizens. Not that these alarming events trigger the drastic change in Shinichi Ichikawa (Show Aikawa). A meek third grade schoolteacher and a family man disrespected in his own home, Mr. Ichikawa toils in abject misery. As a form of escapism, he obsesses on a superhero television show called ZEBRAMAN that aired back in 1978 for a mere seven episode run. ZEBRAMAN folds nicely into those early tokusatsu shows (ULTRAMAN, KAMEN RIDER, the SUPER SENTAI series, etc.), except that the ZEBRAMAN show took place in the year 2010. Mr. Ichikawa's pastime has now evolved to his having sewn together a Zebraman costume. He's posing in the privacy of his home. He's contemplating venturing out on night patrols.

One evening, while in costume, Mr. Ichikawa decides to go on a soda run. But, as he creeps out in the streets, he runs into a violent perp in a crab mask. Forced to fight, Mr. Ichikawa is astounded to learn that he's somehow developed the amazing abilities of his superhero idol. Well, this changes everything.

As time goes on, Shinichi Ichikawa begins to take on the physical attributes of his alter ego. Embarassingly, his hair assumes a decidedly mane-like aspect. And yet the largest shock arrives when he discovers that his revered 1970s show may in fact be a secret prophecy, with him destined to play the role of Zebraman. Just in time to fend off an alien invasion. The year now is 2010. When if not now, Mr. Ichikawa, to overcome that timidness and perfect that piercing stare?

Although there are very decent action sequences, ZEBRAMAN is far from a conventional superhero flick, not with Takashi Miike at the helm. There's a strong satiric streak running thru the narrative. Sometimes the humor comes from left field. Sometimes, it's very broad. The story introduces a sub-plot concerning an M.I.B.-type pair of government agents deployed to investigate a possible extraterrestrial encroachment, except that these guys are frequently played for laughs. Their chief gets injured so much that, by the end of the film, he looks like the Mummy. The villains look grotesque, except that it's hard to take someone like Crabman seriously. And then there's the passage which awesomely unveils... Zebranurse!!!

Show Aikawa is a marvel. He puts his stamp all over the place. He plays it straight but he makes you laugh. And yet he moves you in the quieter moments. He busted his what making this film, and it's fun to witness the arc his character undergoes. Deep in the film, when Zebraman turns a goon into a human pretzel, you believe that the often bullied Mr. Ichikawa is entirely capable of it. Show Aikawa convinces you.

3272327,4,B000Z6GT72,"Believe it or not, I found out about this film in Otaku,USA(a magazine dedicated to all things Japanese). Zebraman is a 2004 film about Shinichi Ichikawa, who-in every sense of the word-is a failure. He lives with a cheating wife, a daughter who digs older men and a son who's bullied at school just because of the fact that Shinichi teaches third grade there.  Escaping from everyday life, Shinichi secretly dresses up as ""Zebraman"", the title character from an unpopular 1970's tokusatsu TV series he watched as a child. A rash of crimes and murders happen around the school where he teaches so, when he dresses up as Zebraman to surprise a good friend who's also into the character, Shinichi unexpectedly gets caught up in a battle with a serial killer dressed up in a crab mask who actually exhibits real superpowers. Little does he know that he's stepped into something much bigger.

The superhero angle was what sold me on getting this movie but, let me tell you, it is so much more. I've never seen one Japanese film that ever made me laugh till Zebraman. It is downright hilarious.

I hear that there is a second film that follows up this first one, of which I aim on purchasing. If you love Japanese movies, comedies or superhero films..give Zebraman a look. I really enjoyed it.",1322611200,,1288,4.665198237885463
3272328,4,B000Z6GT72,"Shinichi Ichikawa (Show Aikawa) is a complete failure in his roles as 3rd grade teacher and family man.  He fetishizes a superhero character from an old, short-lived TV series, spending his evenings dressed as Zebraman in a suit of his own construction, striking poses.  The arrival of a new student (Naoki Yasukochi) and a wave of bizarre events lead him to discover the power within.

This is not one of director Takashi Miike's ultraviolent films.  Instead, he has made a very bizarre comedy that is mostly family friendly, always compelling, and often extremely funny.  The script gets a bit sloppy at times in order to place characters where the filmmakers want them, but all of that is trumped by sheer goofy charm.",1318636800,,721,4.877049180327869

i have watched this epic more times than i can physically and mentaly count.
i catch my self singing the theme song to my self.
but when it came time for part 2 , i waited 4 years to watch it after its American release.
