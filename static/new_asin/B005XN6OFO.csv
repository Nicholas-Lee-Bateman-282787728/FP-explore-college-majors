4903535,5,B005XN6OFO,"This movie is a total gem, entertaining and perfectly cast and edited. There were moments I had to replay right away because they were so funny. Like when the assistant coach, Paul Henderson's character, leads the prayer for the football team. Brilliant comedy. Andy Dick is a madman and yet he has pathos. My family has been quoting one liners from the movie ever since we watched.",1327190400,7,382,4.7164179104477615
4903536,5,B005XN6OFO,"This movie is really funny!  I was laughing non-stop.  Andy Dick gives an outstanding performance and there were great jokes throughout.  The actors were talented and the director did a great job of breaking the comedy mold. This movie was wild compared to all of the big budget, watered-down comedy movies normally released.  I saw it in a theater but I can't wait to see it on blu-ray.",1326758400,3,387,4.647058823529412
4903537,5,B005XN6OFO,"Just saw this movie last week, easily the funniest film of the year!

Hangover 2 was hilarious, but edgier than the first (not in a good way); 50/50 was funny, but depressing, and Tower Heist had me walk out half-way through for insulting the movie goers intelligence. This is a slapstick comedy, but smarter. It follows a typical sports movie underdog team path, but it's way fresh, and tons of jokes layered on top of jokes. Andy Dick shows us that he's still the man when it comes to laughs, and I am looking forward to watching this at home and checking out the extras!",1324339200,2,573,4.457142857142857
4903538,5,B005XN6OFO,"I decided to watch this movie because someone I personally knew was featured in film.

4903706,5,B005XN6OFO,"I am a big fan of silly, outrageous, LOL movies like ""Grandma's Boy"" and ""Black Dynamite""...  This movie was so unexpectedly funny, I have been watching it over and over, and it gets funnier every time.  Every scene is a set up for a gag, punch line or off the wall climax, and the one-liners are ones you end up quoting all the time!  The actual story line is ""Bad News Bears"" like, or ""The Comebacks"" like, but it's a losers turned winners formula that never tires.  Editing and Directing were very good, and kept the movie connected and flowing, with Andy Dick performing brilliantly as a ""Monster Energy Drink"" infused sadistic Coach.  Even the actual football footage was well done and realistic.  I will be watching this movie again tonight, and having some great laughs!  GET SOME!...",1399161600,,791,4.688405797101449

4903722,3,B005XN6OFO,"Division III: Football's Finest

Division III: Football's Finest is a pretty predictable movie. The storyline isn't that bad, but it is a very common plot. It has a lot of stupid funny comedy, like when the coach will chase the players on a bike when they do sprints and he tries to hit them with a yard marker. The stupid funny comedy seems to work well with men, but women tend to not like that kind of comedy as much.  This cheap budgeted movie is cheesy, but definitely gives some good laughs to the right audience

The script was not written very well. It was cheesy and very predictable.  It seemed a lot like they stole most of their ideas from the TV show ""Blue Mountain State"" which is also about a football team and the backup quarterback being satisfied with the backup position. The ending is very predictable and follows the common sports plot.

This movie was also not original at all. It followed the classic sports movie script. The only twist it had was the fact that it wasn't serious so they just made some of the actor's roles include some stupid things which gave the audience a laugh. People could definitely tell the movie didn't have much of a budget because the stadium where they played their football game looked like a small high school field, and the uniforms they had for the games were not put together good, they didn't even have high socks like normal football players do.

The actors did a below average job, there is no popular actors which makes the movie less known because there is very little known actors in the movie. Rick Vice who was played by actor Andy Dick did a good job being the crazy coach but once again his humor stayed with the stupid funny theme. There was a time in the movie where a football player hurt his foot in the game, but his fake limp he was acting was just awkward looking. It feels like they threw this film together and didn't take much time on it.

If you could look past the cheap budget and how cheesy the movie was you could definitely get some good laughs out of this movie. The comedy they used normally only works on teenaged people because it is inappropriate and some adults wouldn't like the comedy. If the people that watch the movie are the right audience they will definitely enjoy the movie.",1379980800,,2273,4.462650602409639
4903723,5,B005XN6OFO,"Having played and coached college football (as well as beyond college), it has occurred to me that this movie truly reveals the culture of adult football. The politics of the university, the questionable moral standards and disgusting perverted sexual language of the coaches, the drugs, the brain dead 30 year old linebacker - its all accurate. In that way, this movie is genius - it scratches the tip of the iceberg of the immoral, disgusting, inhumane, soulless world of the adult football culture and exposes the truth in a hilarious, well done presentation. This is one of my favorite movies because of the laughter, the accuracy, and the therapy it provides for those of us trying to overcome the damage football does to the hearts, bodies and minds of boys and men.",1376956800,,772,4.856060606060606

4903738,3,B005XN6OFO,"Andy Dick is genuinely funny in this movie.  He's a funny comic actor, but most of the reason it works is that he's playing a very funny character.  Rick Vice, a psychotic coach with a checkered past, is the perfect vehicle for Andy to channel all of his crazy, scary talent into, and it works.

Other actors have their moments but I never felt they were as developed as Andy.  Will Sasso and Adam Carolla have a funny running gag as sports reporters, and I wish there had been more of Mo Collins as the loopy president or dean of the small liberal arts college.

The problem with the film is that the main character, played by co-writer and director Marshall Cook, is that he's simply the Lead Character In A Sports Film.  And an under-developed one at that.  He at first comes across as lazy and cynical...and then he just walks through the rest of the film, ending up with a winning game and The Girl...and we're not sure why.  I guess because he's the Lead Character In A Sports Film.

The film clings too tightly to a well-worn sports movie formula and several main characters are merely formula commitments, not hilarious comic creations.

But Andy is really funny in this.",1335657600,,1179,4.518867924528302
