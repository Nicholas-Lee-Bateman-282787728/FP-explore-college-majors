3631245,3,B001HN6968,"If you liked Wind and are looking for a movie about sailing with working shots of the boat in action, more so than character development of the crew  this will not meet that mark, or at least didn't for me. Recommending movies is like recommending restaurants; people have very different tastes in experiential events. With reluctance I have to rate this movie mid-level with 3 stars. Most of my reviews are higher as a thorough pre-buy researcher who pre-selects items before buying. I know more about what I spend my money on and confident they'll rate a 5, otherwise I'll pass. It's hard to know about a movie. As a documentary, this movie is typical in that there are moments when the cast seems aware there's a camera on them. Other times, you can get lost in the story and feel more like an observer. Had I spent $50+ on this in a theater, Id be not happy, but as this was a disc, no worries. But, it didn't satisfy my want for experiencing a sailing experience in Blu-ray. Id also have to add that the emotions of the crew were somewhat lackluster during parts of the race. E.g. about to be overtaken by a competitor, the crew are matter-of-fact about it, when in sailing competitions, being overtaken slowly as sailboats do, is a very emotional and frustrating moment because you're doing the best you can do, and it is very obvious it isn't good enough and the boats show it.

As a long-time sailor with years of racing experience, I was hoping for something more like 'Wind' where the mainstay (intended) of the story was sailing and working shots of the boat in action under way. Even Master and Commander, with Russell Crowe, had more boat-work in it than Morning Light (the name of the boat). This story was more about the crew, their personal trials and tribulations, as they struggle to make the A list and get on the boat. Although I did read reviews pointing that out, there were a great many more reviews about action shots of the boat, but not that I could report. I was only able to make it through 3/4's of the movie before I lost interest and couldn't finish it. Perhaps one day, I'll play it again. The 'kids' and the story of the sailboat race are both genuine, but the story misses the mark with lackluster sailing/marine cinematography. In fact, the reviews from others specifically pointed-out the cinematography was the best part of the film. It didn't strike me as that.",1466899200,,2399,4.5638051044083525

It was fun, however, it is set-up like a 'vote off the island' reality TV show which causes pointless time wasting drama that doesn't need to be there (as if the race wasn't dramatic enough).  More of the movie was about the training and the drama of choosing the crew rather than showing the actual race, this kept it from being great.

I enjoyed it, I bought it for less than five bucks used, but I wouldn't recommend spending more than that, fun but not great.",1382400000,,581,4.462264150943396

The documentary was a nice look at how physically and mentally challenging an ocean sailing race is. Just because they have radios and GPS for navigation doesn't mean it's easy.

Having been at the finish line, and also having interacted with the film crew and sailing crew plus support people at the Waikiki Yacht Club, I can say that the story captures the spirit of the race, the hopes and aspirations, and the disappointments along the way.

Video shot off boats often end up pitching, and has a tendency to make the audience seasick, but this one is well photographed, and none of that effect is seen here.  In fact, there are moments of haunting, poetic beauty, and the only regret is that most of the land-bound audience will never see it in person.",1363046400,,710,4.611111111111111

3631355,4,B001HN6968,"A sailing buddy of mine had suggested I watch this many months ago. I kept putting it off. But finally, he mentioned it again. I don't know if he just forgot that he already told me about it, or whether he was being insistent. But anyway, I ordered a used copy off Amazon, and we watched it last week, my husband and I. Well, sort of. Unlike when I watched&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deep-Water/dp/B000VKL6ZW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deep Water</a>, husband could not stay in the same room, while this movie was going on. I understand a little bit, his reasons.

The movie is full of. . . and I mean *FULL* of. . . privileged twenty-somethings. There are a few people who clearly did not come from as privileged a background as the majority of the other ""kids."" (I'm almost 40, so I am to that point where twenty-somethings are considered ""kids"" to me.)

It really is a reality show, made into a movie. Mr. Disney basically sponsored a reality show, in which 30 applicants were screened to find 11 people (had to be under 25-years-old) who would form a team for the Transpac 2007. The Transpac is an annual sailboat race from L.A. to Hawaii.

I'll be honest, sometimes I cringed at the superficiality of some of the contestants. Sometimes my heart was warmed by some contestants' sincerity. However, no matter how alien some of them seemed to me, by the end of the movie, I could see that all of them had really displayed a tremendous amount of teamwork, and it really does boil down to that. The movie was about the dynamics of people. Sailing on the open ocean necessitates teamwork (even Robin Knox-Johnston, Ellen MacArthur, Bernard Moitessier, Jessica Watson, and the like had a lot of help in preparation). A metaphor for life, really.

Very jealous, was I, by the end of the movie.  But you know what they say about jealousy. Jealousy helps you figure out what you next want to work to achieve.  It was just an awesome movie in that respect.  I agree with other reviewers that it would have been nice to see more technical aspects.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wind/dp/B001E6FJQ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wind</a>&nbsp;was nice in that respect because, well, not only was the lead female an avid sailor, but she was also an engineer, and a sailmaker, whereas the only female aboard&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Morning-Light/dp/B001HN6968/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Morning Light</a>&nbsp;does something very un-teamlike.  Maybe that just rubbed me the wrong way because I see that a lot at work, where people don't heed my warnings, and end up back in my clinic.

I admire all those sailors who worked so hard to accomplish this journey.  But I mostly admire Rick Deppe (the camera-man who lived on boat with these people) for his awesome footage.  He is interviewed a little bit in the extra bits on the DVD.  My favorite quote, ""Well, I don't normally sail with people like you, but...""  Because of his great camera-work, this movie surpasses&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wind/dp/B001E6FJQ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wind</a>&nbsp;for footage.

3631356,5,B001HN6968,"Agree that the Amazon review is bogus.  The movie isn't a friggin Warren Miller spinoff and glad it's not, nor is it MTV or any the other quick clip edits that get old fast in a movie.

You get to know the team and what they and family have sacrificed and how lucky they feel. They get you into the work and training at that level and how much there is to learn... You start to get a feel to what it might be like to being sleep deprived and have to keep driving on, and they're all optimistic and working together,,, very cool.

It's got beautiful shots throughout the film and never seems to drag. We really enjoyed it and I'll be slapping it in the DVD every so often just for the visuals. Ya it's Disney, but feeling good about this movie when it's done, what's wrong with that!??",1313020800,,784,4.178807947019868

The movie would have benefited from more content:  how were skipper/crew relations?  how come only one girl made it on the team and no minorities? how much sleep did they get, how much gear did they pack, what could go wrong, who else was in the race??  how did they take the photos?  the movie oversimplifies all these issues and ends up being fluffy, glossy, and thinner than the fascinating topic deserved.  but hey, it's a lot better than nothing, and it is pretty, and in the sad pantheon of terrible sailing movies this is better than most.

3631383,5,B001HN6968,"As an avid sailor, with both collegiate racing and offshore sailing experience, I highly recommend this movie.  Most sailing movies take convenient editorial shortcuts and dumb down or change sailing terminology to appeal to a mass audience.  Morning Light avoids these pitfalls for the most part.  Its documentary format shows life aboard a stripped out racing boat better than I've ever seen it portrayed.  The team building, training, and preparation segments are essential to the story, and I must say that I learned a great deal from it.  And the intensity of the race is outstanding.  What a finish!

The other reviews have complained that the film is somewhat inaccessible to non-sailors, and overly ""Disnified"" (18 - 24 year old hard core sailors not cursing or drinking!?).  The film is guilty as charged, and probably all the better for it.  The teamwork and the sailing take center stage.  So, whether you sail a Sunfish in a lake or a Volvo Ocean Race boat around the world you should buy this movie.  But if you don't sail, there is a great deal to enjoy for you too.  I would recommend the movie to all audiences, and it probably will be uniquely appealing to teenagers.  It shows people not too much older than them chasing their dreams and competing in a very intense, technical, and dangerous sport.  What is not to like about that?",1271462400,,1349,4.758620689655173
3631384,5,B001HN6968,An exciting sailing race. Not many complaints from the crew - except no wind at one point. A movie well worth seeing more than once.,1271289600,,132,4.32
3631385,2,B001HN6968,"I came to this hoping to gain some insight and knowledge about the Transpac, about what exactly is required to be competitive, and how people go about mounting a successful campaign. But oh sure: I was also hoping to be entertained.

Right away: alarm-bells went off: ""The sea-route between California and Hawaii is the loneliest stretch of ocean in the world."" Oh, d'you really think so? The narrator obviously hasn't read&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Godforsaken-Sea-The-True-Story-of-a-Race-Through-the-World-s-Most-Dangerous-Waters/dp/0385720009/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Godforsaken Sea: The True Story of a Race Through the World's Most Dangerous Waters</a>, which is the story of a single-handed race through the Southern Ocean near Antarctica, where even NORMAL weather is 60' waves, and of which is said: ""Below 40 degrees (latitude) there is no law; below 50 degrees, there is no God"" (and is an utterly thrilling read as a result).

A few minutes in, the thought came to me: ""The director has no interest in the actual subject-matter, and doesn't trust that it's interesting in itself to anyone."" Evidence? The pounding sound-track; the trick zoom-shots; the speeding up and slowing down of time for dramatic purposes; the personality fluff; the lack of any hard information at all about sailing.

Do not get me wrong: if you grew up with MTV and ""reality"" game shows, really like looking at very photogenic young men and women (all of whom are dead serious about this race, unlike the director), and are not looking for any actual information about sailing, you may well love this.

This review will no doubt get slammed, but that's OK: I put it here for people like me.",1269734400,,1729,5.488721804511278
3631386,1,B001HN6968,"I love sailing and am fascinated by long-distance sailing and I think that sailing races have spun some of the most coveted sailor's yarn out there, like the Sunday Times Golden Globe Race and, of course, the TransPac. The concept of the Morning Light ""documentary"", thus, sounded intriguing to me - put together a crew of kids in their early twenties, give them a powerhouse of a boat and let them compete in this classic open water race against all the old sea salts.
Of course, the fact that this is a Disney movie waters down the expectations of ""documentary"" elements, and, true to Disney's reputation, the worst you will see (or much rather: hear) is somebody getting seasick off camera. No cursing, no fights, no frustration, no egos competing. Just a bunch of happy twens in a friendly competition. To distract from the voids of this obviously edited-out content, Disney uses high-def cameras and high-tech editing to create those ""stunning visuals"" that everybody appears to seek in a sailing movie. However, Disney pushed too hard for my taste - more often than not the result looks overedited at best and some scenes look outright cheap. The pinnacle of fake-ness are the night sailing scenes ""under the stars"", that, of course, include the mandatory shooting star across the sky. If I want to see ""canned atmosphere"" like that I watch a cartoon - there at least I don't have to wonder about the degree of ""reality"" in all the other scenes.
For some reason, Disney also decided to take out pretty much everything that would have made this kind of venture interesting for me: The crew selection process is depicted like a happy pool party. The training process appears to be a couple of days of jolly sailing with some of the world's best sailors, but we don't hear anything about the instructions they give. The skills needed to compete in the TransPac are not mentioned anywhere. Different crew members are caled ""highly talented sailors"" all the time, but we don't get to find out what actually makes a good sailor other than winching a sheet, looking at a screen with weather and maps and turning the boat's wheel.
Long distance races are won and lost by the tactical decisions made in the process and this race is no exception. The crew for some odd reason decided to go north instead of south around a high pressure area. Unfortunately, we hear nothing baout why they made this, or any, tactical decision. LAter during the race, an almost identical boat was able to overtake them. What was the mistake they made? What did they learn from that? All these questions go unanswered as well as the question of how the crew reflected on the race afterwards other than in empty buzzwords. There would obviously have been a lot to explore here, especially since from the beginning there were more kids on board than were finally selected to crew and the skipper was only ""elected"" at the end of the training period. All of these elements are so heavily glossed over, though, that it led me to regret having spent the time watching it.
On another note: the soundtrack is just ridiculous. Disney apparently thought it highly original to underlay a softened pop-rock that sounds like a leftover from the early nineties being recycled, and, as subtle as a tank, to modulate the beat with the wind or boat speed. This might have been cutting edge twenty years ago, but these days it just adds to the feeling of cheapness in this movie.
In the end you will have seen some highly polished visuals of high tech sailboats in fair weather conditions, you will have seen someone winching a sheet about a hundred times, which apparently metaphorizes ""sailing"" for Disney, and you will be sick of hearing some of the more spoiled crew members about having to spend ten days without gourmet food, video games, and movies, instead of realizing and taking advantage of the fantastic opportunity and privilege they have been given. You will also have heard Walt Disney tell you a felt 2000 times about how this race changed his life, but you will be left to wonder about the ""how"" and ""in which way"". To me this movie was a great disappointment: what could have been a great documentary about a fantastic sailing experience ended up being an empty shell, the vaccum of which the images and the soundtrack were not able to fill.
If you're looking for more ""reality"" in a documentary about long-distance sail racing, maybe something like ""Deep Water"" might be the better choice. If you're looking for a very ""light"" movie, where everything is ""fairy-tale harmonious"" and sailing is ""fun"", where you can leave for 30 minutes or turn off the volume without missing anything, then you might enjoy this one.",1263686400,,4692,4.751225490196078

Since 1906, boaters from all corners of the globe have gathered to compete in the Transpacific Yacht Race, a two-week-long sailing competition that extends across more than 2,000 miles of open ocean, starting in Los Angeles and ending in Honolulu.  In 2007, Roy Disney and a team of expert trainers sponsored a hand-picked crew of young sailors - ages 18 to 23 - to compete in the event (indeed, it was the youngest team in the history of the race).  Named after the 52-foot boat on which they sailed, ""Morning Light"" is a documentary account of both the preparation for that race and the race itself.

The movie spends much of the first half focusing on the grueling training the youngsters underwent as part of the process of whittling down the group of 15 hopefuls to a final crew of just 11.

Directed by Mark Monroe, ""Morning Light"" is a wholesome, upbeat, fast-paced documentary with razor-sharp editing (by Monroe and Paul Crowder) that really gets the adrenaline pumping, and cinematography (by Josef Nalevansky) that truly makes you feel like you're a part of the action.  Through interviews, we get to know a little about the youngsters themselves, what motivates them, what excites them about sailing, and what it means to them personally to make - and, indeed in some cases, to not make - the final cut.

With its inspirational, shoot-for-the-stars pop-rock soundtrack, MTV-style editing techniques and ""Real World"" communal setup (albeit a squeaky-clean one), the movie is clearly aimed at a younger audience.  And there are times when the movie does feel a little too ""Disneyfied"" for its own good (did none of these young adults ever once swear?).  But folks of any age will be able to thrill to this film, provided they have a spirit of adventure - armchair variety or not.",1262304000,,1797,4.84640522875817

I have a very little bit of sailing experience (none of it off-shore) and I thought it was great move. I enjoy sports in general and like watching the America's Cup, etc. but this is a film that, while it takes place on a sailboat, is not about sailing.

This movie is about the struggle of a group of young people to take on a challenge of enormous size.  While the movie left no doubt the people would succeed, at least to some degree, they didn't know if they would succeed while they were undertaking the challenge.  The consequences of failure in the middle of the Pacific Ocean could easily be fatal.

This film could be used as a study in leadership - in particular peer leadership.  It is also very inspiring.  I highly recommend the film.",1259798400,,835,4.453947368421052

I had no idea that the majority of the members of a professional racing team are well into their mid thirties to early forties. Roy opened up the door to influence the norm of a standard set in place. These young men and women were presented with a chance of a life time and took it.

There should be no mistake about it, the star of Morning Light is the TRANSPAC race, not the crew, not the boat.  This movie is about introducing non-sailors (including my wife) to the world of offshore sailing, and I think it accomplished that goal handily.

Not only is it about sailing, but this disc also has some great ""reality TV"" (the good kind).  The disc includes a bonus feature from ESPN called ""Morning Light: Making the cut"" which tells a little bit more about the process of whittling the 30 original sailors down to 15.  I would actually recommend watching the ""Making the cut"" bonus feature before the film.  It provides a little more background and context.

This movie and the bonus feature are true reality TV.  It is not a group of people, hand picked for their clashing personalities, and put into a contrived situation.  Morning Light is about real people taking part in something fun and interesting.

It is the kind of reality TV that makes you wish you were one of the sailors, not the kind that microscopically examines the exaggerated relationships between highly immature individuals.

Excellent movie, and highly recommended from both the sailing and reality TV perspectives!",1251331200,,1394,4.7866108786610875

While some in that age group waste away those years, this group devouted themselves to a cause and came together as a team. The success they achieved was a true story of the right support, them being committed and then doing what it took to be successful.  This should be a part of every high school class schedule on what it takes to be a success in life.

The chance to turn back the clock and do this is one most folks I know would be willing to make.",1250899200,,616,3.880952380952381
3631418,5,B001HN6968,"Being a sailor myself I was looking forward with much anticipation to a story about the Transpac race that starts just a few miles from where I live. Normally, documentaries on sailboat racing follow a pretty standard formula that features quick cuts, long-range helicopter shots, and a few comments from the competitors and supporters. All pretty boring stuff. This film, however, totally smashes that mold.

For the first time, we get a glimpse into the fascinating world of long-distance sailboat racing by giving us the opportunity to get familiar with the characters, the boat (aptly named ""Morning Light"" - which at the end of the movie provides a bit of Disney magic!) and intense preparation required to compete in one of the premier yacht races. In short, I was blown away. By the way, the photography is utterly amazing - the best we've ever seen in a sailing film.

If you've never been on a sailboat before you'll finally get to see why so many of us find it intoxicating. The boats in the film are the Ferrari's and Lamborghini's of the sea - they're always being fussed over to gain that extra knot or two, in any kind of weather and at any hour. And we get to see that in shot after shot. One great scene shows the boat hitting 27 knots, which sent chills up my spine. For a monohull sailboat, that's just sick!

But the real star of the film is the crew, which, as you've already read, features fifteen rookie sailors that are given the chance to prove themselves against some of the world's best sailors. Their stories are what brings Morning Light her character and heartbeat.

Roy Disney, who was the driving force behind the film, said, ""I would like this film to appeal to people who have never been sailing and have always wondered what it's like out there... I'd like for people to understand that it's a very demanding and athletic sport."" Roy, you've done a terrific job.",1245801600,,1896,4.633928571428571
3631419,4,B001HN6968,"With a few exceptions, Disney has not done many documentaries.  But that made me even more curious about this film.  Walt's nephew Roy Disney is a sailing enthusiast, and he decided to sponsor 15 eighteen to twenty-three year olds to train to compete in the 2007 TransPac race.  This documentary follows the group for the entire six months they trained as well as the actual race.

Now if you are wondering what exactly the TransPac is, it's a race that covers the 2000+ miles from Long Beach California to Diamond Head, Hawaii, the longest stretch of open ocean.  For sailors, this is considered the ultimate race.

The documentary starts with the training, which involves everything from physical fitness to emergency preparations and, you know, actual sailing.

Unfortunately, only 11 of the sailors can actually man their boat, called Morning Light, for the actual race.  After four months together, the group must select the actual team.

Then comes the day of the actual race.  In a race like this, any little mistake can win or lose it.  With that kind of pressure, can they win?

This documentary really breaks down into two halves.  The first half, the training, is certainly interesting, and I learned a lot about sailing from it.  Things get even more interesting when they switch to the actual race.  I was drawn into their quest to win even if it wasn't nail biting suspense.

But what really got me was how likable everyone was.  I'm used to reality TV fair where people seem to be cast more for how obnoxious they can be than anything else.  Yes, this movie had a few moments of drama between various people, but it was never overdone and mainly focused on the positive of them working together.

Of course, my biggest wish was that they would have turned this into a TV series.  100 minutes just wasn't enough to capture everything that happened during those six months.  Heck, I really only felt like I got to know three of the 15 kids.  13 hours would have given us a better feel for what they really went through and learned.

If we aren't going to get the longer series version of the story, this one is well worth watching.  I thoroughly enjoyed this look into a sport I didn't know much about.",1245196800,,2215,4.634961439588689
3631420,4,B001HN6968,"The Transpacific Yacht Race, a race featuring competitors from all over the globe as they start from Point Fermin (southern edge of Los Angeles) and travel through the Pacific Ocean through unforeseen weather conditions and try to reach their goal in Hawaii.  A 2,225 nautical mile contest that is known for its challenge, its adventure and teamwork as everyone aspires for excellence.

Executive producers Roy E. Disney who has been part of the Transpac Yacht Race since 1975 and Leslie DeMeuse (who works as an ESPN producer) who also participated in sailing competitions when she was a teenager are passionate about this race and came up with an idea of what if they can find 11 young rookie sailors who had to work together and compete in the 2007 Transpac Yacht Race.

""morning light"" is a documentary directed by Mark Monroe and feature cinematography by Josef Nalevansky.  The documentary is based upon Disney and his staff finding the young men and women who have sailing experience from college, those who were determined to compete in a professional race.

From 538 applicants down to the initial 30 people invited to Long Beach, California and become part of a small competition trials to determine the applicants strength and weaknesses.  From these 30 competitors,  Roy Disney, Leslie DeMeuse and sailing master Robbie Haines and crew decide on the  the final 15 who were then invited to train in Honolulu, Hawaii and undergo intensive training.  These young men and women range from the age of 18 through 23 years old.

After the training, the team leaders will need to determine who will be part of the final eleven who would compete and then prepare for their 2,225 mile competition as they get to ride the 52-foot high, high performance sloop known as ""morning light"".

The documentary shows us the men and women who go through training in Hawaii and have to learn safety (several professionals have died in Transpac Yacht Race competitions due to unforeseen weather conditions and inadequate safety preparation), due to the demands of the boat and having to continually grind and lift objects, they need to be in their best shape and to do things quickly.

Although the main 15 people get along, we see a few individuals who face major challenges.  One sailor goes off to the ski slopes during her training off day and ends up breaking her wrist.  Now she is in the risk of not being able to compete professionally.  Another sailor has problems swimming and now he is in jeopardy of not making the team.  And just the sense of competition of which person will lead the team, who will take what position and then having to decide which of the four people will be cut from the final 11.

And once the race does start, they must work together and make wise decisions in their first professional race.

AUDIO & VIDEO:

When it comes to picture quality, ""morning light"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (aspect ration of 1:85:1).  As a big fan of documentaries shot on the ocean, especially in Hawaii, I can tell you that you get very beautiful shots of the sloop on the ocean and nice and beautiful blues of the ocean and the skies.  Because the film was shot outdoors, you get to see the vibrancy of the reds and yellows and with occasional shots of Hawaii, we get to see the beauty of the island. Skin tones are natural (well, considering everyone had to apply the lotion on their faces) and blacks are nice and deep.  There is little artifacting and noise that can be seen on certain scenes in the documentary but nothing terrible.

But the primary focus is on the ocean and that is where the majority of the action takes place.  This is a documentary shot in the ocean and because of the amount of shaking and constant movement, it was noted on the special features of how challenging it was for Director of Photography Josef Nalevansky.  There are a few scenes in which drops of ocean water get on the lens but for the most part, considering the challenges of instability on the sloop's movement, picture quality is pretty good.

As for audio, audio is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD (48 kHz/24-bit).  Dialogue is clear, music is clear but you get the occasional bad weather with the rains and thunder, the winds and the crashing of waves which come alive.  Documentaries are not exactly something to expect superb audio and full usage of all channels but overall, ""morning light"" manages to capture the sounds of the ocean and of course, the youthfulness of the film by its rock n' roll soundtrack.

As for subtitles, ""morning light"" is presented in English SDH, French and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""morning light"" comes with two featurettes.  Both are featured in 1080p High Definition with English 2.0 Dolby Digital sound.  English SDH, French and Spanish subtitles are also included.

Included are:

  * Stories from the Sea with Host Jason Earles - (28:32) ""Hannah Montana"" star Jason Earles stars in a featurette about behind-the-scenes footage of what was not seen in the documentary, including interviews with both Roy E. Disney and Leslie DeMeuse.  Learning how Josef Nalevansky was chosen to shoot the documentary.  Also, learning of the impressions of the youths who were selected and what happened to some of them after they were cut from the final selection.
  * Morning Light: Making the Cut - (41:52) The actual special that was shown on ESPN.  This featurette focuses on the final 30 people who were selected among the 538 applicants.  How they had to compete and be evaluated by Roy Disney and his crew and in the end, the 15 people were chosen.  This special was enjoyable as we learned of the things that transpired before the actual documentary.  So, I'm glad this was included on the Blu-ray.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I happen to find ""morning light"" quite enjoyable to watch.  I have always found it entertaining to watch films especially about college students who have taken up collegiate sports that may be unfamiliar with most people.  From rowing competitions featured on the 1984 film ""Oxford Blues"", to people competing in badminton, surfing and various competitions.  In this case, college students who were (and some who still are) members of their collegiate sailing team.

I found it fascinating to watch these young men and women who were very passionate about sailing and how excited they were to be part of such a project.

For Roy E. Disney and Leslie DeMeuse, to film a documentary on the sport definitely helps generate interest but also brings the spotlight to these athletes and gives us who are not familiar with these competitions a chance to see what is involved.

So, as a documentary, I found it quite entertaining.  If anything, it was good to see everyone come together as a team.  There were no major squabbles, if anything, the most difficult part that these people had to endure outside of the competition was having to cut the four people they trained with for six months.  And of course, those who were cut having to face disappointment.

I found the whole race and the cinematography captured to be quite breathtaking.  I am quite biased towards aquatic based films and I just found the whole sense of leadership, teamwork and adversity among these rookies who don't know each other all that well, having to come together and work together for ten grueling days in the middle of the ocean with no one but themselves to depend on.

It also helps to have two enjoyable featurettes, one special that was shown on ESPN showing the viewer what transpired before the documentary of ""morning light"" and another featurette that shows us what happened to some of the people who were cut from the team but were given some real awesome opportunities.  But what caught my attention was when both Disney and DeMeuse were talking about ""Trash Island"", areas in the Pacific Ocean where people who have dumped their litter and it has all been collected in certain parts of the ocean and have become poisons to aquatic life (plastics dissolve into polymers and become ingested by aquatic organisms and enters the food chain).  I was surprised to hear about all this.

Overall, ""morning light"" may not be a documentary for everyone.  I can see sailing enthusiasts and those who are open and are curious about the Transpacific Yacht Race to watch this documentary and enjoy it.  I've never sailed in my life but I do appreciate the sport and enjoyed the documentary.

If you are a person who has an interest in sailing or any ocean sports, I definitely recommend giving ""morning light"" a chance!",1245110400,,8551,4.789222373806275

3631432,5,B001HN6968,"Who would have thought, back a few years ago, when there was much ado going on at the top of the Disney Organization, that the above words would actually appear on a Walt Disney Pictures release?

Morning Light is the true chronicle of a hand-picked team of young people who are given the chance to train and compete in the Transpac sailing event, which has been Roy E. Disney's passion since the mid-seventies.

I'm not a sailor but I have run marathons and triathlons and know the feeling of those comparably small triumphs (though I'll never win -- in fact one year i was passed by a man walking his dog!) The character of the individuals chosen, their work ethic and team spirit is very sincere and a far cry from the preening, backstabbing types that infect many TV reality shows. This follows a reality show format with lots of comments from the participants as well as a selection process where several are eliminated and are left to send messages from the mainland (where the food seems to be really good).

I found it much more compelling then the current crop of Hollywood sports movies in which a ragtag bunch of can't-possibly-win team members somehow come together under a down-and-out coach and eventually win as music swells... you know what I mean. The crew in Morning Light are a very likable group of people who you find yourself routing for (parent's note: there are a handful of words that earned this film a PG rating, but not nearly the kind of language also common on many reality shows).

The photography is stunning, especially the night shots, which I'm hoping are not computer generated since they are so breathtaking (say it ain't so, Roy).  The score is good too, with contemporary music, songs and even a number by members of the crew at the end of the film. Where's the soundtrack album?

There are only two extras but both are rich in rounding out the full scope of this project. Hannah Montana's Jason Earles hosts one feature about the film's production itself, which sheds more light on the camera work, training and other elements. An ESPN special focuses on the elimination, showing more of the earlier hopefuls and clearly how some with ""attitudes"" were wisely given a polite dismissal.

In a sea of poor role models, kids can certainly do worse then getting to know this group of youths who not only worked hard and showed integrity but also went on to promising futures in careers or continuing education.",1244592000,,2445,4.6985981308411215
