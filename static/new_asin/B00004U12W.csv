7923331,5,B00004U12W,"If there's anything which can be learned from this superb 12-part documentary on the production and culture surrounding American film, the current sensibilities driving the market today in the early 21st century are quite different than the so-called ""Golden Age"" of Hollywood. During ""Old Hollywood"", circa 1920 to 1955, drama films reigned supreme and were the largest budgeted films with the biggest stars who were expected to create huge box office receipts. Also, the biggest film stars tended to be female, an aspect of entertainment which began to decline by the 1960's. (Today, female character-driven films are labeled as ""specialized"" whereas male-driven films are labeled ""universal"" by the industry, which I think is hog-wash.)

The segments ""The Hollywood Style"", ""The Studio System"", and ""The Star"" explain what drove Hollywood films and how they were produced prior to 1965. The female film actress of old Hollywood ruled as the biggest stars until the mid-1960's: they were like figurehead queens reigning over entertainment, even though the studio executives were the real power behind the thrones. Martin Scorsese who touts himself a film scholar as well as a director, talks about the ""Hollywood"" style, which is code for the narrative or storytelling style, meaning films in which a script with actors tell a story. (Other types of styles of films exist, such as documentaries.) Before the reinvention of Hollywood into a new frontier when offerings from the likes of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas hit the screens in the 1970's, genre films, aka mystery/suspense, science fiction, fantasy, and horror, were largely budgeted and marketed as ""b-films"" for a primarily youthful audience at matines. Even many westerns were b-films, but they were probably the most popular and lucrative of genre films prior to circa 1960.

Hollywood during its ""Golden Age"" was quite dictatorial by today's standards. Movie actors, be they the super-stars, like Elizabeth Taylor, Betty Davis, Joan Crawford, Clark Gable, Shirley Temple, or Jean Harlow, or character actors like Claude Reins, Margaret Hamilton or Thelma Ritter, were under studio contract and were not freelancers. Even actors as prestigious as Bogart and Reins were under contract by the studios, and a typical contract would last for seven years. (Humphrey Bogart began as a character actor of tough guys until ""Casablanca"" reinvented his persona.) In other words, the studios essentially owned their talent. Stars like Tom Cruise, Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt, and George Clooney are all freelancers and not under contract.

The film executives also blamed their stars for box office bombs, even if the problems had more to do with the script and production. In the late 1930's, the term ""box office poison"" was coined, and the studios took notice of whose films were making money and whose were not. The executives, wielding dictatorial power wouldn't take the blame for box office bombs but could easily point shaming fingers at their stars. In the early 1940's, a host of talent, most notably Joan Crawford, would lose renewal of their contracts. Crawford, who had had a good run with MGM but had been labeled box office poison by her studio, was able to sign with Warner Brothers. Under her new studio she starred in their production of ""Mildred Pierce"" and won the Academy Award for Best Actress.

Because films were the dominant form of American entertainment prior to circa 1955 when television started to cut into the film industry, the studios produced films much like an assembly line. The studios had everything in-house: sets, costumes, furniture, etc., and even their actors and crew. From circa 1920 to 1970, many scenes used either stock or footage backdrops, called rear projection in the lingo. Most scenes with characters driving in a car used pre-shot stock footage of streets and roadways in rear projections to give the illusion of people driving distances. According to my dad who grew up in the 1940's and 1950's, he never once thought the rear projections were ""fake"" until he toured Universal Studios and saw how they were achieved.

In ""The Film School Generation"", the documentary shows how the likes of a handful of filmmakers, most notably Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, and George Lucas, and to some extent Francis Ford Coppola and Brian De Palma, changed filmmaking. What I gathered from this documentary is from the late 1970's onward, the genre film overtook Hollywood and has become the reigning force behind Hollywood entertainment output. Unlike the female-star driven dramas from the 1930's to circa 1965, genre films became the rage, thanks to the genius of Spielberg and Lucas who brought high-class sensibilities to genre films, particularly with Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

In ""The Edge of Hollywood"", the documentary unveils the rise of the independent filmmaker and the ""negative pickup deal"". Director-writers Spike Lee, Quentin Tarantino, and a few lesser-known talent such as Julie Dash, Annabella Sciorra, and Jim Jarmusch, describe how they wanted to write stories outside the contrived studio system which is constantly focusing on ""universally"" popular films at the expensive of artistic visions. Recalling a telling encounter with a studio executive, Julie Dash describes pitching her film ""Daughters of the Dust"" to studio executives, saying her film is potentially something which hasn't been seen before. To which the executive replied the studios don't produce films which haven't been seen before! Jarmusch also relates a similar encounter in which a studio exec asks why the independent filmmaker makes only ""amateur"" films, to which he naively asks the difference. ""Professional"" films cost at least $5 million, the exec replies.

Overall a profoundly interesting and telling look at the film industry. Unfortunately, this series is very hard to find on DVD. (I lucked out and was able to buy a copy.) I wish PBS would re-release this documentary because it is one of the better offerings about entertainment. PBS also produced a similar documentary about the history of Rock 'n' Roll, also never released on DVD.",1448064000,,6167,5.242147922998987

7923333,4,B00004U12W,"I use this set for film and history classes because the references are fresh and available to those whose have interest but little knowledge. The absence of academic vocabulary may by off-putting to some, but it makes the viewer feel well-informed and well-entertained at the same time.  My idea of education!",1066694400,3,309,5.0588235294117645
7923334,5,B00004U12W,"Writing a screenplay? Trying to do an indie? This set TOUCHES on 100's of important (sometimes obscure) American films...just enough to make you want to find some of them for further study and ignore others. You will see, within catagories or timelines, snippets, some brief but some several minutes, give you the highlights, the substance.
This is NOT MGM's ""That's Entertainment"".
This IS a series of entertaining, lucid programs that follow like film school seminars but are easily understood by even the most casual viewer.  Note, the series does not play to the lowest common denominator.  A true film buff and their film-hating spouse could watch this together, and both walk away amazed.  My elementary school kids now understand as much about film making history as many professionals I know.
This would be a great gift to your local school.
I highly recommend this if you are interestted in Digital Video, especially home filming, guerilla film-making, or just getting ready for film school itself.  This set is entertaining, but is an education in itself.
The shots, the sounds, the explanations of what works, the experiences of current filmmakers, the reasons for success of prior filmmakers, WHY the public taste changed in every decade(o-o-h, never thought of THAT, eh?)... This is a dream come true if you do not live within commuting distance of a film school or don't have the [money]...
Trust me on this one.  You will not regret this purchase.",1023062400,14,1462,5.024793388429752
7923335,3,B00004U12W,"The first half of the series was terrific, but the last half happened to miss one of the greatest American filmmakers of our century: Woody Allen.  Was it due to timing (the affair) or was Mia on the board?
Other than that, it's a pretty decent view of what this continent has had to offer the world of cinema.",1015286400,2,310,4.254237288135593
7923336,5,B00004U12W,"This ten-installment love letter to Hollywood and American film was originally aired on PBS, and comes on two two-sided DVDs.  Introduced by John Lithgow, each segment is then narrated by a different actor and covers the following subjects:  The Hollywood Style, The Star, Romantic Comedy, Film Noir, The Western, The Combat Film, The Studio System, Film in the Television Age, The Film School Generation and The Edge of Hollywood.
Each segment runs about 54 minutes and is well-written, loaded with illustrative scenes from great films, and filled with interviews by filmmakers, actors and film scholars.  I especially enjoyed the Romantic Comedy and The Studio System segments, but each is so well done that you will undoubtedly find favorites of your own.
The only weakness here is the lack of any real documentation.  When so many films and actors are discussed, it would add value to this collection to have a good index.
If you enjoy film and are interested in a thoughtful introduction to this American art form, you can't go wrong with this collection.",1010793600,19,1060,5.04
7923337,5,B00004U12W,"Quick, name an artform that's uniquely American...
Sure Jazz comes to mind, and some would argue the poetry in Baseball (yeah, right), but the one artform that's most often overlooked is the influence Hollywood has had on Cinema.
And that's where 'America Cinema' comes in.
This Collection of DVD's is taken from the PBS series of the same named that was shown in the early 1990's and goes into great detail on Hollywood has changed the Film world. From the Studio System, to the Western and War movies, to the Hollywood blockbuster that developed in the late '70s, this series covers it all in a fair amount of detail.
If you consider yourself a cinephile, then you cannot go wrong in adding this series to your collection.",982108800,9,724,4.708661417322834
7923338,4,B00004U12W,"This series, which ran on PBS a few years back and is still repeated from time to time, is certainly the ""excellent overview"" that the previous writer said it was.  Film buffs and certainly film students should  make a point to see it.  As comprehensive as it is, though, many of its  main points have been made elsewhere (television changed the movies in  significant ways; war movies changed profoundly after Viet Nam, etc.)...and  it IS expensive.  I would hope that academic libraries (especially those  with film studies programs) and larger public libraries are buying this  series. The demand is certainly there. As an individual purchase, well, if  you can afford it and you're a big enough devotee, it should be a welcome  addition to your library.",959212800,6,757,4.928571428571429
