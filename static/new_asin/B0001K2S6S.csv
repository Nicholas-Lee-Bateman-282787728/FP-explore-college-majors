8013469,4,B0001K2S6S,I found this very good but I'm an experienced guitar player. Not for beginners of any sort. U must really study Paul's playing,1382832000,,126,4.521739130434782
8013470,5,B0001K2S6S,"This is an inspiring DVD. Lots of ""lesson"" DVDs are kind of by-the-book but Paul is genuinely present and in the moment. It's like taking a master class. He doesn't dumb down, yet he slows the instruction at crucial points. What I would like to say to guitarists is: Take your time with this. Don't expect to ""get it"" all at once. I also teach guitar (to levels much less advanced than this video) and I tell my students that all the time. Let the spirit come to you. The music is more than where you place your fingers. That said, there are many mistakes in the tablature booklet that comes with this, particularly in the transcription for ""Luck of the Draw"". Watch Brady's finger placement and listen to the chords. They are nowhere near the chord transcriptions in the booklet. Homespun may want to do a little editing there. But that's a minor complaint and I was able to visually correct the mistakes. It's all in Brady's playing. Look there for the truth. Enjoy this DVD. You won't regret buying it, if you'd like a little inspiration.",1381276800,,1041,4.542553191489362
8013471,4,B0001K2S6S,Liked the content very much.  Paul explains his approach to his music.  The only surprise was the absence of any sheet music or tablature.,1358035200,,138,4.708333333333333
8013472,5,B0001K2S6S,"Totally satisfied with this DVD. It's not the first purchase on Amazon and I'm sure it won't be the last.
This DVD is a must for anyone wit an interest in guitar playing.",1349049600,,170,4.181818181818182
8013473,5,B0001K2S6S,Well recorded and wonderfully performed. I am a huge Paul Brady fan and he turns out to not only be an excellent guitarist/singer but a teacher as well. Well worth the price just for its insights into open tunings.,1280016000,3,214,4.512820512820513
