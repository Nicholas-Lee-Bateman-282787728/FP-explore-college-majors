8018450,5,B0001Z35K6,"Pokemon Advanced, Vol. 2: Tree's A Crowd contains three episodes and two bonus episodes.  These five episodes are 18-22 of the sixth TV season.

Episode 18: A Poached Ego - This episode has Team Rocket finally doing a good deed.  A wicked poacher named Rico has captured some baby Koffings and Ekans.  Jessie, James, Wheezing, and Arbok fight valiantly to rescue them, with consequences I did not expect, that really made me sad!!!!!! WHAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Episode 19: Tree's A Crowd - A spunky rebel Treeko, a wood gecko Pokemon, wants to protect a dying tree that has been it's only home.

Episode 20: A Tail With a Twist - A big bully Seviper terrorizes Mae's Torchik.  Treeko is beaten badly by it, and has to go to a Pokemon center for treatment for a Poison Tail attack.  Meanwhile, the Seviper just may have met it's match in Jessie.  Much humor in this episode.  After the sad, almost tragic first ep in the DVD, I cracked up a lot over the Seviper and it's antics and attitude.

Episode 21: Taming of the Shroomish - A very cute Pokemon called Shroomish holds the clue to rumors of a haunted mansion which is designated for demolition.

Episode 22: You Said a Mouthful - I almost fell over laughing.  This episode about a super-powerful Pelipper (Pelican Pokemon) and the greedy Team Rocket who tries to profit off it is great.  Pelipper is so cute and funny-looking, I laughed just looking at it.",1120694400,3,1416,4.680161943319838
