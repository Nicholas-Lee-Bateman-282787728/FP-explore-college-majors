4948671,5,B00641Y2ZS,"If you didn't get a chance to catch this on ESPN than you need to watch this. This documentary is very well put together. About a guy who was a high school basketball star in the Boston area and was recruited by all the big name coaches and decided to play locally at Boston College. He left after just a few months at BC due to an injury and than his downward spiral into drugs and alcohol began. He went back home and got a second chance to play basketball at Fresno State for Jerry Tarkanian. He continued to have problems with drugs and alcohol while at Fresno but was able to play well enough and eventually got drafted and played a couple of seasons in the NBA and overseas. It chronicles his struggles throughout his journey and it will make you laugh, cry and experience all types of emotions. This is one of the best documentaries I have seen up to this point and chronicles his problems with addiction as well as how he got clean and sober and got his family and life back on track. You will like this documentary whether you have issues with drugs or not. This would be a great movie for anyone, including kids, teenagers and or people with or without drug and alcohol problems. It's that good. It has a lot of video footage from his past and does a great job keeping your engrossed in the movie. Can't brag enough about this documentary.",1324425600,60,1349,4.357142857142857

4948692,5,B00641Y2ZS,"I love this film - I've seen it half a dozen times now, and it always gets to me. I saw it again today (twice!) with two different groups of people, and everyone loved it - at least two people said it made them cry, I kid you not! This is a great movie for people in recovery, or for family member trying to figure out ""how did this happen?"" It shows that this disease doesn't respect anyone, anywhere, no matter what. It tells the story of a young, amazingly talented kid who was told, ""Hey, you are going to be the 'savior' of the whole town!"" because of his skill at sports - at 18 years old - and he couldn't handle it - who could? His brother succinctly puts it, ""it was drink, drug, fight, that's what you do!"" And for the ""normal guy"" who wasn't supposed to ""save the town"", maybe he could put down the beer, put down the joint, put down the pill, and walk away, but not the kid who was supposed to ""break out"" and be more, and ""save"" everyone from their hum-drum lives. So he gets into BC, hurts himself bad, and loses his scholarship - it's all over. But wait! No, it's not! He gets a 2nd chance! And his poor drug-addled self is sent 3,000 miles away, no friends, no family, and best of all, no TREATMENT, to Fresno, where he's immediately told, hey, now you get to play the most important game of the year, against Boston, lets strut your stuff. And that's the way life keeps going for this kid. He keeps getting lucky breaks, and more drugs, dragged down, and down, and down, until he has 4 overdoses, and a cop is waking him up one day by breaking the glass on his car window to get him out, saying ""Hey buddy, you've been dead for the last 30 seconds!"" When he finally does get a chance at the NBA and he's traded to the Celtics, is he thrilled? No, not really. His childhood dream come true? Should be! His wife is ecstatic! He's going to be so close to family and friends! All he can think of is that, dammit - he knows right where all the dealers are in that area... he's leading a secret life. Chris is brutally honest. He tells in very honest terms of the nightmare of his complete downfall, the nightmare rollercoaster ride, and yes, what it took for him to recover, and ""finally look at myself in the mirror again"". This is a great film. Watch it. He's funny, he's poignant, he's real.",1484352000,,2306,4.207674943566591

4948745,5,B00641Y2ZS,"Stunning. That's really all there is to say about this 30 for 30 ESPN docu-drama. Being an old-school basketball player, I've let slip the intense attention that I used to possess for the players in the NBA and as a result I'd never experienced the Chris Herron story as it played out. Having dinner one evening with my children, this remarkable story was playing on the big-screen TV almost uncomfortably to my right over the bar. Amidst the background noise and conversation, I kept turning to watch what was, even without sound, a seemingly heartbreaking tale...who WAS this guy playing for Boston College and Fresno State? Why did the basketball highlights keep going back to him pacing before huge crowds of kids and young American troops, seemingly sharing some emotional drama?

Knowing that my 17 year old son was a serious NBA fan, I asked, ""who is this guy?"" Looking at me incredulously he responded ""Dad, that's Chris Herron, the guy who used to play for the Nuggets and the Celtics. He had a drug problem and this is the story...I've seen this 5 or 6 times."" Still looking at me as if I'd missed his entire generation of players (which essentially I had), he then said, ""don't you know about him?""

Sadly, no, I didn't know anything about him...but it was the visual appeal of this outstanding 30 for 30 piece that came through to me in that crowded restaurant...I didn't even need the audio to see that this was something I needed to see. Subsequently buying the DVD and just now watching it in its entirety, I'm shaken to my core. I've not seen any sports story with this intense emotion or moral drama since ""Brian's Song"" way back in my youth. The interplay of Herron's on court successes (it seems as if every one of his games had been recorded) with his public discourses before these large crowds of young adults swept me away into his message...this movie isn't about basketball or addiction, it's about the harrowing, sometimes humiliating acts of a man miraculously bringing himself back. Yes, this story has been told numerous times...many of Herron's contemporaries went through the same ordeal. But it was the presentation of this film and Herron's obvious acquiescence to allow the film makers to make this deep dive into his tragic past that comes through.

Intently, with the hard Massachusetts accent and the constant pacing, he unpacks his story...a brilliantly talented player who'd gone on from college to playing in the pros, he quickly throws his talent away while awash in drug/alcohol addiction. His seemingly congealed personal life, married to his high school sweetheart and fathering three children, is intently overlayed with his many personal demons. Cocaine, pain-killers and finally heroin bring him down...he of course hits rock-bottom (as most recovering addicts do) but it's his wife and family who stand by him throughout that makes this drama so appealing. Herron possesses a remarkably distraught personality while still conveying his story intensely...I've not experienced anything like this in film before. The 60 minutes fly by and definitely leave you wanting more...to see how his day-to-day struggles and its effect on his amazingly supportive family turn out. I applaud the always remarkable 30 for 30 filmmakers along with Herron for giving us possibly the best story of the series...yes it is that good.",1426809600,,3361,4.976868327402135

What really had me pulling for the guy & wanting to see him make it & stay sober is the genuine love he has for his wife & kids.
Powerful moments that stay with you: His brother in tears; Chris' coach at Fresno State moved to tears seeing this kid that he loves throwing his life away (at the time Chris was doing drugs)...and, of course, for me...what got to me was seeing how nice (the sober version) of Mr. Herren is to his family.
Am happy he got through it; am happy he's clean and enjoying his family and life these days. What an eye-opener this doc is. I hope some of the teens out there see this film before they succumb to peer pressure & get into dope. Drugs/heavy booze is a dead-end to nowhere. Always was.",1410307200,,884,4.145348837209302

Additionally, I loved the sports footage in this documentary.  I'm a huge fan of Jerry Tarkanian, and I thought it was great to see odl clips of him and that infamous Fresno State team.  Herren is the start here, though, and he is a captivating subject.",1391040000,,570,4.549019607843137

4948790,5,B00641Y2ZS,"When discussing documentaries about people who have overcome illnesses, roadblocks, addictions, or any type of problems in life, Chris Herren is THEEE poster-boy for this, and this film is incredible at describing it. Sure, this is based on a basketball player who got caught in the near fatal bear trap of opiate addiction, but to put t in a much better way---simply, It's about a Chris' life story: a guy who fell into the deepest, darkest hole there is on this planet, fought for 15 years to climb out of it, and made it out to the other side, with the the help of Heather (his wife), Michael(his brother), along with other great friends he had and most importantly---especially the inspiration of is his 3 children. Sure he played ball(and is, IMO, tied with Patrick Ewing as the greatest basketball player to come out of this state), yet basketball WAS (unknowingly to him at the time) a partial reason for his decent. But im now going to stop here, & not give away any more. But the moral of this documentary is that no matter what trials &roadblocks life puts in your way,(regardless of who put/how they got there), be it financial, be it addiction of ANY kind, or be it anything else, there IS help out there and there IS a way to get out of it, and Chris is a prime example of that.
The gentleman who had commented that he bought several copies of is book and gifted them out to people he knew was brilliant. This is must read for all, for teenagers in high school,(even if youve never drank a single beer your entire life)college students, parents, doctors, and especially for anyone going through recovery.
God bless you Chris, much appreciation goes out to Chris & Bill Reynolds, the gentleman who wrote the first book on Chris as a Senior in Durfee High School (FALL RIVER DREAMS) and helped Chris with this book among MANY, MANY other things in during is 15 years of hell.

However, for those not privy to a personal appearance (albeit, he makes a TON of them - mostly to High Schools) this is a great, inspirational story of a ""it can't happen to me"" kid who had every dream come true whilst he was drowning in his own nightmare.

Having been addicted to opiates for many years I can understand his struggle to maintain a career and family and am pleased to see that he realises that he couldn't have done it without the support of that beautiful wife of his.  What a wonderful thing it is for him to share his history with us in order to try and help others to overcome what is a monumental battle for anyone that achieves sobriety.  I thought the best part of this doco was the fact that the footage was in a chronological order and we were able to see him ""doing well"" when he wasn't really doing well but doing lots of drugs!  I think it is important for people that struggle with such things to realise that it is easier to share and be honest after the nightmare has passed and the addiction no longer exists.  Many people say that there is no problem when there are huge issues, Chris did the same.  Money isn't everything and Chris and his wife certainly prove that it was to their detriment to be in receipt of a massive pay packet.  All the best to him and his family for the future, I hope that I only hear positive things about this beautiful man in the future, for his families and his own sake.",1348358400,4,1362,4.359683794466403

So what?

This is one of the best documentaries you'll ever see surrounding this topic.

There's a book out there about Chris Herren, but it's lacking Chris' voice, the personification of his character and charisma.

Here you get the voice, the story and Jonathan Hock knows enough to get out of the way of Chris Herren when he tells his story. Hearing his wife in person and feeling her pain as she continuously smiles, watching his children look at Chris with unbridled love and concern, and watching the coaches and fans who loved him once peering through smiles of joy when they see him, but unable to conceal the look of 'we've been here before - please Lord let us not be here again.'
