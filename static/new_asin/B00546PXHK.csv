8456429,1,B00546PXHK,boring and a lot of incorrect facts.,1476662400,,36,4.285714285714286
8456430,2,B00546PXHK,"I suppose a reasonable overview, but it put me to sleep. Reminded me of 60's science shows.",1449878400,,91,4.411764705882353
8456431,4,B00546PXHK,Great locations to get you thinking about visiting this beautiful area of France. Shot on video with ~1980s style so quality is not the best but enjoyable and worth watching.,1396569600,,174,4.833333333333333
8456432,3,B00546PXHK,"This is a 23 minute film visiting 10 towns in Provence showing highlights.  The scenery is pretty in this film.  Sometimes the tempo was a tad slow or the narration didn't exactly match the image shown.  If you are wanting to see Provence, this is a fairly enjoyable introduction to it.  It could have been longer and gone into more depth on each area.  23 minutes can't do it justice.",1395705600,,385,4.442857142857143
8456433,5,B00546PXHK,This was a simple tour through the southern region of France. We enjoyed watching this and seeing some of the cities we didn't see on our last trip there.,1379462400,,154,4.344827586206897
8456434,1,B00546PXHK,"I cannot even give this a 1 star.  I should have known better, but considering that I've always been satisfied with my purchases from Amazon - I did not expect them to promote a product of this quality or lack of.  The clarity of the video was poor - without definition and the color was dull.  To make matters worse, the narrator did not even have the correct pronunciation of many of the names of the towns featured in the video.  This was amateur quality at best.  My suggestion - don't buy anything without a review.  By the time I pay for return shipping and they deduct for an opened item, I am basically paying Amazon to take it back.  It may take a longer wait time to receive a Rick Steves product or another more professional travel video. BUT DO IT!  (this was one reason for the purchase), but 4 hours vs 26 minutes and at a lesser cost....what was I thinking! - I won't make that mistake again.",1360454400,,907,4.294117647058823
8456435,4,B00546PXHK,"Watched for free on Amazon Prime, so not upset about paying like previous reviewer.  I'm planning on a car trip around Provence and this short (22 min) film hits all the highlights.  Good compact overview covering a lot of information.",1358726400,,235,4.85
8456436,1,B00546PXHK,This video was dated and of poor visual quality. I couldn't even finish it and will not purchase any of the others in this series.,1346889600,,130,4.24
