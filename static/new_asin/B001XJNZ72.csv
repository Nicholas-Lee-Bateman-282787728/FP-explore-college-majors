This film and Beautiful Losers are both much better documentaries and cover tons of artists from around the world not just the select few offered by 'The Bansky Movie'.

For one thing you know all these artists are real, unlike Brainwash and Banksy who are both mere media phenomenons that cease to exist when the lights come on, and may in face be the exact same rich dude, Thierry Guetta, who actually owns all the buildings on Melrose where all the weatpasting is done.

Inside Outside covers a world of sometimes down and out Street Activists bringing visionary art and other public displays straight to the peoples minds regardless of medium or its public presence or how well it may be covered by the thrill seeking media.

Do yourself a favor and get a good Street Art Documentary and stop settling for crap just because it pops up on Netflix.

An hour's worth of priceless art and interviews with ZEVS, Swoon, Os Gemeos, Adams and Itso, Ron English, Pigmeus, Earsnot and more, not to mention the other hour of extras devoted to an extended interview with Os Gemeos, the Nofitti gang of Berlin, Steve Mona of NYPD and others, and slideshows of Swoon's and ZEVS' work.

Energy, creativity, and sabotage cannot be damped in this well-made documentary by Andreas Johnsen. Neither can a continuing dialogue about what makes community, who owns what, and what is art. But ""art"" is foremost on everyone's mind: how you do it, where you do it, what its purpose is. A thoroughly thought provoking study of the evolving art of graffiti.
