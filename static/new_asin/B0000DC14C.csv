1922913,5,B0000DC14C,"Season 2 is a MUST have for anyone who loves drama, suspense, and a bit of noir. Unfortunately, this price is so incredibly stupidly high that I will not purchase it off of Amazon until it is at least under $50, or will purchase it from another site/store when it is under that price. Amazon, lower the price!!! Even Star Trek: TNG doesn't cost this much per season!!!",1173484800,,368,4.426470588235294
1922914,5,B0000DC14C,"This is an excellent follow-up to the show's first season. Characters are well rounded, and some episodes even rival the quality of a an ""X-Files"" episode (and that's saying a lot). There are too many surprises to go into too much detail, but if you're a fan of this series, it is absolutely crucial that you own Season 2.",1137456000,2,322,4.47457627118644
1922915,5,B0000DC14C,A roommate of ours has season 2.  SO I was bored one day and watched alot of movie and said heck...I'll watch this.  OMG was it a great choice.  i am in the process of ordering the other 3 seasons and starting from the begining.  But wow.....it gives me a CSI type fix with a very cool twist.  I am upset that he was missing disk 3 of thew season 2 set.  pissed me off actually!  I love the fact jack found a jill and has made her at least look like sam.  Best show i have seen in a long time.  LOVE IT!!!!!,1132617600,,507,3.798076923076923
1922916,5,B0000DC14C,Great to finally have at home and not have to wait for Court TV.  Can't wait for season 3.,1072224000,,90,3.736842105263158
1922917,5,B0000DC14C,"season 2 of this amazing series was without a doubt one of the best on television. Ally Walker's portrayal of Sam Waters was uplifting as well as heartbreaking at times. . . making this one of the most heartfelt things I have ever seen. The serial killer jack-of-all-trades can still send shivers down my spine, and will to most people. many people i know can and have been addicted to this show from watching one episode...and so will you",1069545600,6,439,4.569620253164557
1922948,5,B0000DC14C,Love this series I think it is vastly underrated and is the original crime/ who done it series. Should get more credit than it does,1386288000,,131,4.28

1922950,5,B0000DC14C,This season is just as good as the first season and the stories are well thought out. I hear that season three is not as good but I will probably get it to finish the set. Great Series !!,1357948800,,187,3.8205128205128207
1922951,5,B0000DC14C,"I love this show.  All of the actors worked perfectly together.  This show clearly paved the way for, and influenced all of the more  recent police shows.  This one is still the best.  Very dark at times; great villains.  ""Jack"" is a chilling sob.  Watch it from the beginning, you will get hooked.",1356652800,,298,4.509433962264151
1922952,5,B0000DC14C,"LOVE THIS SERIES; ONE OF THE BEST; GREAT CHARACTERS, SUSPENSE DRAMA AND ALL WE CAN WATCH IN A TV SERIES; VERY EXCITING...HOW I MISS THIS KIND OF SHOWS!!! IM STILL WATCHED AND FEEL THE SAME WAY AS WHEN I WATCHED FOR THE FIRST TIME...BUY IT!!",1318377600,,240,4.355555555555555

1922956,5,B0000DC14C,Nothing like watching your favorite shows whenever you're in the mood.  And you don't have to wait until next week for the solutions to the cliffhangers.,1229212800,,153,4.884615384615385
1922957,3,B0000DC14C,The VCTF continues to look for Jack of all Trades but gets stumped again. Amazing how inept they are. Sam Watters charecter starts to grind away on you as she is so uncomfortable and uneasy in day to day conversations. Many of the stroy lines seem to blend togwther.,1187481600,,266,4.448979591836735
8000523,5,B0000DC14C,"This and another Profiler movies I enjoyed immensely and watched them numerous times. I have only ever owned two. I liked the stars, Aly Walker and A.Martinez (thought he was only on a few times). I also like Robert Davi..

The stories were engaging. One, in particular comes to mind when an apparently normal mother ran off with a teenage lover on a wild shooting spree. The lead male, Robert, was so kind to the boy.",1523750400,,418,4.5
8000524,5,B0000DC14C,Quick delivery. A+++,1481846400,,20,6.0
8000525,3,B0000DC14C,Remembered this being better. Too much of the show concerns an improbable genius who is after Sam -- and he is virtually everywhere and knows everything about everyone ... yet they never catch him.,1470441600,,197,4.823529411764706
8000526,5,B0000DC14C,GOOD SHOW... NOW HAVE ALL SEASONS... ALL DVDs WORKED...,1467763200,,55,5.222222222222222

8000529,5,B0000DC14C,"How cool are these. Who would have thought that we could one day watch our favorite program from TV on a DVD.  I bought this season and another for my mom who has the beginning stages of Alzheimer's.  There are some things that my brothers, sister, and I remember that she doesn't.  She professes to me that she has never watched this program in her life and that I am crazy when I say that.  Well, when the program was airing, my mom and I would be on the phone with each other and Profiler would come on.  We would watch the program and during the commercials talk to each other about what just happened on the show.  We would finally hang up, finish watching the show, and then I would call her and we would discuss the episode.  She loves a good forensic mystery as well as I do, but we can no longer reminisce as I thought we could.  I am hoping for a miracle.  If she doesn't remember watching the program before and likes it, hopefully she will have a new program to keep her company when there is nothing good on TV.  The box comes wrapped with all the individual DVD's in their own cases in the box.  Love how organized they are.",1418428800,2,1138,4.1981566820276495
