2694381,1,B000KLNLCI,"Yogi Bear, the show, is great.  This rating is for the misleading title.  The title says the complete series,  and even talks about all 33 episodes.  You only get 8 episodes.

2694388,5,B000KLNLCI,"Yogi Bear was a favorite from childhood. I can remember hoping to see him visiting Kankakee State Park. Snagglepuss, Yakky Duck, and Quickdraw I only remember later in childhood so I'm not sure how I knew of Yogi so young. I remember liking Boo Boo and as you'd expect for a child worrying when Yogi didn't follow Boo Boo's advice.

However, the cartoons are good and the limited edition animation cell that was missing from the Huckleberry Hound Season One set seems to have been an unlisted feature of the Yogi Bear set. It's actually not an animation cell though but one of those painted stained clear plastic sheets that you might remember as a child that were sometimes used to create holiday decorations. The animation cell is part of the packaging front and I think it's intended that you remove it from the front.

There are only 2 seasons and from my research it seems those 2 seasons where the only two made which is a bit surprising given Yogi and Boo Boo's  popularity.",1452211200,,981,4.594285714285714

2694459,1,B000KLNLCI,"I, too, was very disappointed to find out that 1/3 of the cartoons are of Yogi and the other 2/3 of Snagglepuss and Yakky. Also, the DVDs are not continuous play which are very inconvenient to say the least. And lastly 2 of the DVDs have no labels on either side. I'd prefer to have a label showing who is at least on the disc. Can't say if the remaining discs even work because I got fed up after watching the first one, or rather fast forwarding 2/3 of it, to find the Yogi ones and the rest of them I haven't had an interest in watching. I'd think twice before purchasing something like this again.",1420934400,,601,4.189655172413793

2694563,3,B000KLNLCI,"I admit I was glad to see Yogi Bear cartoons or a while, but like a lot of things, the novelty has worn off for me. One reason I guess is that I became more interested in watching ""Snorks"" on Boomerang. The other issue is that I have seen various flaws in the Yogi Bear cartoons. They are not funny, they are just really short slow paced episodes, and the rangers seem to ban Yogi from everything from the park and not just picnic baskets. Although I found the Snagglepuss cartoons enjoyable, particularly the railroad one. I am not a huge fan of Yakey Doodle, but he is okay. I was glad to see Yogi Bear, and he is a great Hanna Barbera character, I just don't think it is as funny as oh say Looney Tunes or Tom and Jerry.",1377993600,,723,4.134751773049645

I was really not a fan of Snagglepuss or Yacky Doodle as a child. I could never understand the duck, and it wasn't funny.  I'm very disappointed that some of my favorite episodes of Yogi Bear are not on this disc.  Rah Rah Bear, Show Biz Bear, and Foxy Hound Dog for instance.  Again, I'm very disappointed.",1373328000,,421,4.415584415584416

2694589,5,B000KLNLCI,"THE YOGI BEAR SHOW: Perhaps HANNA-BARBERA's most beloved anthropomorphic character, YOGI BEAR was originally seen in slightly cruder form on THE HUCKLEBERRY HOUND SHOW, where he became that series' breakout star. The ED NORTON-channeling picnic basket filcher was accompanied by his ever-cautious companion BOO BOO, a flesh 'n blood conscience that YOGI cheerfully ignored at every turn. Armed with sly asides such as ""Smarter than the average bear"", the brazen bruin mooched his way into viewer's hearts...even his incredulous JELLYSTONE PARK nemesis RANGER SMITH stopped to marvel on occasion. Also appearing on the series was SNAGGLEPUSS, an irrepressible pink mountain lion who spouted Shakespeare in the pompous manner of BERT LAHR, and YAKKY DOODLE, a diminutive, always-in-peril duck who had previously done memorable one-shots on TOM & JERRY, PIXIE & DIXIE, and HUCK HOUND-era YOGI shorts. In spite of HANNA-BARBERA's fun but limited animation technique, THE YOGI BEAR SHOW boasted the charismatic voice personalities of DAWS BUTLER (the RICH LITTLE of cartoons) and DON MESSICK, plus writers from the LOONEY TUNES' golden age, making it ""must-see"" TV on a par with the best sixties sitcoms.

RATING: FIVE PIC-A-NIC BASKETS",1296604800,,1231,5.5132275132275135
2694610,5,B000KLNLCI,"Wow! I would gladly welcome Yogi and Boo-boo take my picnic basket for food. These cartoons taught kids how to share, that the human spirit, not body, is resilient, and laughter and humor are great ways to tell a story.

These cartoons are part of the cannon of animated characters so beloved by myriad generations, especially the kids growing up in the fifties and sixities.

Contemporary times produce the absolute worse values and images for our youth. I don't understand how the cartoon genre could become so violent and disgusting in such as short passage of time. Yogi and cohorts shared  human values that by today's standards appear distinctly in a vacuum, and so far away from the themes that propelled these wonderful cartoons, which made these viewing experiences so humanizing. Thank you for these gems.

2694612,5,B000KLNLCI,"I am so glad I found ""The Yogi Bear Show - The Complete Series"" and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Huckleberry-Hound-Show-Vol-1/dp/B000AOEMU0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Huckleberry Hound Show - Vol. 1</a>. I can now share these wonderful shows with my 5-year-old and reminisce about the good old days. I have fond memories of afternoons watching Yogi and company after doing my homework, such wonderful days. Honestly, I can't bear the drivel that passes off as children's shows these days (with the exception of a few) - the older shows like Yogi Bear, The Jetsons, The Flintstones etc. had original story lines, catchy (not annoying) scores, and also great humor.

This multi-disc set comes attractively packaged, contains 4 discs in total, in full color with a total running time of 792 mins. Apart from Yogi Bear, this disc set also contains the Snagglepuss and Yakky Doodle cartoons. In addition there are a couple of bonus features, i.e. Time Capsule Yogi - Die-Hard fans view the Pilot as originally aired (Disc 1), Cartoon Tracks: The Art of Hanna-Barbera Sound - Audio Effects known the world over that contributed to the show's classic popularity (Disc 2), Stills Gallery Tour with Yogi - Never-Before-Seen animation sketches (Disc 3), and Yogi Gets Global- One Yogi Bear Episode in a Variety of Languages (Disc 4). There are 33 episodes in total. The episodes have the option of English, French and Spanish languages/subtitles. The picture is in standard version.

A great way to entertain both young and old alike - and the dialogue is truly memorable! All in all, this is a must-have for all fans of Yogi Bear, Boo Boo, and company!",1262563200,,1697,5.304832713754647

When a company charges this much, the very least they can do is design a simple case where the DVD's can be accessed without having to remove another DVD and play the ""I need 4 hands to juggle everything"" game.

2694680,5,B000KLNLCI,"This DVD set is one of the best sets I have ever owned! Yogi Bear is the funniest cartoon character in history, and the entire series is right here in one set! Yogi Bear got his start on the Huckleberry Hound Show, but soon he stole the stage and eventually got his own show (and it's no wonder why...Yogi Bear is FUNNY). Each half-hour episode features one Yogi Bear cartoon, one Snagglepuss cartoon, and one Yacky Doodle cartoon. However, as the Yogi Bear cartoons are some of the greatest cartoons in history, the Snagglepuss and Yacky Doodle cartoons aren't as great (in my opinion). The Yogi cartoons are funny, imaginative, and well written, while the other cartoons just seem like they were rushed to fill in a half-hour show. Snagglepuss is very annoying. But the DVD set is still worth it because Yogi Bear makes up for everything! There is also a feature on the first disc where you can watch every episode complete with the original Yogi Bear theme song, bumpers, and classic Kellogg's commercials featuring the characters of this set. Another great extra is a short documentary of Daws Butler, the talented voice artist who did the voices of Yogi Bear, Huckleberry Hound, and many many other great characters.

2694681,5,B000KLNLCI,"When I bought the Yogi Bear DVDs I wasn't aware that two thirds of the package contained Yakky Doodle and Snaggle Puss episodes. At first I felt somewhat betrayed but after my kids watched them, they laughed just as hard at the Yakky Doodle and Snaggle Puss shows as they did with the Yogi Bear shows. Yakky Doodle has to be the most innocent and pure-hearted character ever created in the history of cinema and television. The writing for all the shows is extremely clever. You know its good stuff when your kids laugh about the shows hours after they are finished watching them. This is what children's cartoons were like years ago when normal people worked at the animation studios. Today's cartoons are written and produced by every type of deviant that society has to offer. If you care the psychological development of your kids, turn off the garbage being broadcast on cable television and turn on anyone of the Hanna Barbera cartoons. I can't recommend these shows enough.",1142467200,,980,4.770588235294118

These cartoons may be lower budget than Disney or Looney Toons but they are not any less entertaining, they  may actually be more so. the Yogi Bear Show is to Pinnochio as The George Lopez Show is to the Lord Of the Rings. Snagglepuss is the best he's like Mike Myers on acid. This cat could easily out cat that Pink Panther character any day any time even. If you have ever seen the movie Slingblade where a retarded man becomes a friend and protector of a young boy then change the little boy for a little duck named Yakky and switch the retarded man for a tough dog named Chomper and make him not be retarded and you have the third cartoon in this set.

2694683,4,B000KLNLCI,"Having only watched the Yogi Bear show in reruns in the 70's which only featured Yogi and not Snagglepuss or Yakky (although I did see those as well, here and there) I was surprised to find that the Yogi Bear Complete Series didn't have all of the Yogi cartoons I knew and loved as a kid. I realize NOW that the original show featured one cartoon of Yogi, one of Snagglepuss and one of Yakky Doodle and that's exactly what this compilation is. It isn't 33 cartoons of just Yogi.

Some of my favorites that AREN'T in this compilation are - The 222 Tudor Terrace episode, Quaba Quaba Kitty Kitty episode, Yogi flying the helicopter, Yogi and Super Highway, ""When are they going to fix these...bumpy roads?"" episode etc.

If you want ALL of the Yogi episodes that you know and love you'll have to buy this DVD and the HuckleBerry Hound Complete Series which features Yogi, Huck and Pixie & Dixie. This isn't a particular hardship since I'd love to see some old Pixie and Dixie, so it's a moot point. But some might be confused as I was to discover they weren't all in this series. I guess WB knew no one was going to buy Snagglepuss or Yakky Doodle the Complete Series....

I just wanted to point out that Yogi purists will have to buy two series to get all of the Yogi cartoons you know and love.",1136678400,,1294,4.360995850622406
2694684,4,B000KLNLCI,"The cartoons in this collection are great and timeless. But I was disappointed that the episodes are not assembled in the same manor they aired. When you select an episode you only see the three cartoons that were featured in that particular episode. You do not get the theme song, bumpers, and closing credits!

In my opinion, the Yogi Bear Song is one of the greatest theme songs in TV history, and it's a shame to not have before each episode as you get ready to dive back into Jellystone Park.

There is a special feature that allows you to see the theme song, and the bumpers...but since the DVD is titled as ""The Complete Series"" I was expecting to find the episodes in their original broadcast versions.

That aside, it's a great DVD with tons of great cartoons making their DVD debut. My two year old son and I start off each morning with a round of these classic cartoons before we start our day!",1136246400,,905,4.4397590361445785

Scooby-Doo episodes, Flintstones episodes?  FEH!  We want the good stuff and we want it NOW!  Thankfully, HB/Turner had the good sense to release both Yogi Bear and Huckleberry Hound on DVD and I could not be happier.  Growing up in Central Indiana, these cartoons were weekday morning staples, thanks to Cowboy Bob and Janie (Hoosier children of the 1970s, rep-ra-zent!) and while it would be nice to have inbetween banter from Gilroy Gopher or Sourdough the singing biscuit, at least the wait is over and it was well worth the wait.  One complaint though: WHERE'S QUICKDRAW MCGRAW AT?!!?  Get his episodes out or I'll hit you with my El Kabonger!

2694686,5,B000KLNLCI,"Unlike Disney, which has its trademark character, Mickey, there really isn't one Hanna Barbera character that you can slap the company name on.  You have so many popular shows and characters, everyone is surely to have their favorite.  From Fred Flinstone, to George Jetson, Yogi, Huck, Top Cat, and Scooby Doo, there are just too many to put on top as the clear fan favorite.

One thing is for sure, one of the staple characters and my favorite is Yogi Bear and his beloved sidekick, Boo Boo.  They are constantly getting in trouble with Ranger Smith, either for stealing picnic baskets, or trying to escape from Jellystone Park.  Of course, many should be able to tell that the characterization of Yogi came from Ed Norton of the Honeymooners (while Fred Flinstone was Jackie Gleeson).

First appearing in the Huckleberry Hound Show in 1959, Yogi was quickly stealing scenes, which led to his own show.  There were not a ton of episodes, compared to the other HB shows, but it's simplistic characters and plots made it one of the most fun in all of Hanna Barbera land.  The gimmick of him trying to leave Jellystone was used several times in the HB world: Magilla Gorilla trying to get out of the pet store, and Wally Gator and The Hair Bear Bunch always trying to escape the zoo.

While these DVD's include the original early 60's shows, Yogi of course lived on in numerous specials and appearances over the years.  He is still the mascot for Jellystone Campgrounds around the country.  There has been heaploads of licensed Yogi memorabilia sold from around 1960 right up to the present day, and continues to be a solid find on any Hanna Barbera collector's lists.

For the Hanna Barbera and/or Yogi lover, this collection of classics is a must.  After already releasing Scooby-Doo, Top Cat, the Jetsons, Wacky Races, Penelope Pitstop, and The Flinstones, this edition was long overdue in my mind!  Of the many zany quotes Yogi threw at the viewer every single episode, I will leave you with one of my favorites, as I pull a Snagglepuss and prepare to exit, stage left:

""The deeper you go in the woods, the more nuts you find!""  -- Yogi Bear",1131494400,,2145,4.68
2694687,5,B000KLNLCI,"I think it is awesome that Warner Home Video is putting out the whole ""Yogi Bear Show"" episodes in one collection.  It'll be great to own all of the classic Snagglepuss and Yakky Doodle cartoons and most of the Yogi Bear shorts as well.  I say most of the Yogi 'toons because the rest are being released in the Huckleberry Hound DVD box sets; the show that gave Jellystone Park's chief resident his start to fame and pic-a-nic baskets.

I have noticed that the image scan of the box art has changed since this set was first announced.  Now the title says, ""The Yogi Bear Show - The Complete Series"" instead of just ""Yogi Bear"" and it now lists 33 episodes (the correct number) instead of 35.  I am thrilled that the set will include the TV special ""Yogi's Birthday Party.""  It's a great show with a lot of the Hanna-Barbera cast showing up to pay tribute: Huck, Quick Draw, Augie Doggie, Doggie Daddy, Snagglepuss, Yakky Doodle, Pixie, Dixie, Mr. Jinks and more.

8158122,4,B000KLNLCI,"Yogi Bear made his debut in a supporting cartoon on Hanna-Barbera's prime time series, ""The Huckleberry Hound Show"" in the late '50s (the other supporting cartoon was Pixie and Dixie, two mice, and Mr. Jinx the cat). Yogi became so popular that he spun off a new cartoon show, ""The Yogi Bear Show"", which was later released on DVD, along with other classic Hanna-Barbera cartoons, in super deluxe packaging as part of the ""Hanna-Barbera Golden Collection"".

This Diamond Collection marks the 60th anniversary re-release on DVD of these cartoons. These are real DVDs, far better than DVD-Rs, which sometimes don't play and seldom play well. That is all to the good. You get the complete series of 33 episodes on three discs, also all to the good. The ""boo boo"" does not refer to Yogi's bosom bear buddy, but to the packaging.  Instead of being on separate pages as in the Golden Collection releases, the three discs are stacked on top of each other, not the best way to store discs. What to do? Blank DVD covers are available very reasonably. It's best to get a double cover that holds two discs. Put discs two and three in the second cover. You can copy the jacket art from the DVD cover on a color printer (the page will slip out when you hold the cover open flat). But you don't even have to do that. Since this set comes with a slip case, just slip the slip case over the bank DVD cover. If you break out the Diamond Collection sets in this manner, you can store the discs just as safely as they were in the Golden Collection.

Anyone who didn't get the Golden Collection sets when they came out, I urge you to get these Diamond Collection sets of real DVDs of classic Hanna-Barbera cartoons while you can. Buy a set of blank double DVD covers, and you'll be smarter than the average bear.",1518048000,,1792,4.49079754601227
