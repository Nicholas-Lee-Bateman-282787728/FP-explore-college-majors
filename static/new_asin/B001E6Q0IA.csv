Starting in 1979 and running until/through 1988 , the television series was initially called Roald Dahl's Tales Of The Unexpected . Roald would introduce (mostly) his short stories fireside for the bulk of the first couple of seasons . Many different writers and teleplay adapters followed but the quality never truly faltered . While I could easily quibble about the unexpectedness of a great many episodes , this program is first and foremost about the journey . The story . The tail . Writing and performance are SO uniformly great you WILL be thrilled . Fantastic .",1525219200,,719,4.5813953488372094

This show is a British version similar to The Twilight Zone , The Gallery and other shows similar to the ones I just mentioned also close to The Ray Bradbury Tv series that used to come on the television in the mid 80's and of course also like the movies Tales From The Crypt and The Vault of Horror in which deals with revenge I purchased this because I have for a long time wanted to see the rest of the series but could not when I found out Amazon was selling this I said to myself I have to get this I notice there are various sellers selling this so I decided to go with whoever was selling this at a reasonable price I went with a company on here called moviemars which was a BIG MISTAKE if I can I will upload photos why I just said what I did what I received is not what I called factory sealed and brand new like moviemars assumes now I am having nothing but problems trying to get a brand new not damaged not cut up DVD Box Set but this company seems like they do not want to be bothered cause they did not respond back after 24 to 48 hours long story short I had to get help from Amazon and now I am still in the process of trying to get a replacement to anyone if anyone reads this STAY AWAY & DO NOT BUY FROM MOVIEMARS ON HERE Do your research on this company and see I am not the only one who has had many issues with this seller if I knew now what I did I would of never ever purchased this excellent show DVD Box Set from them",1471219200,2,1660,3.9582089552238804
