5256479,5,B0093OQE36,"This documentary is one of the fairest assessments of our modern day political landscape.  As a Black Republican,  it was surprising to see my story played out on film by  white filmmakers.  It was not easy watching this film as it hit a lot of sore points, but I am most definitely the wiser for it.  I will give this film maker the best possible compliment that I can give anyone - this film is FAIR.",1353456000,3,402,4.2368421052631575
5256480,5,B0093OQE36,"This is a terrific documentary by Kevin and Tamara Williams. I write this testimonial four days after the 2012 election and it is clear that the issues brought up in ""The Fear of a Black Republican"" are more timely than ever. As a progressive Democrat, I think it is critically important that we have at least two viable major political parties (although three might work also).

Given the present downward trajectory of the National Republican Party, we are on our way to one-party control which is not a healthy situation. Uncontested power always corrupts and we need a loyal and vibrant opposition to provide appropriate checks and balances.

Thanks Kevin and Tamara for an important contribution!",1353024000,2,701,5.0344827586206895
5256481,5,B0093OQE36,To hear from thinking and astute people what their experience has been and clearly seeing that they are the future was refreshing.  GOD BLESS THEM!  They care but the left could care less.,1353024000,,188,4.666666666666667
5256482,4,B0093OQE36,"This film is long overdue.  It addresses one of the most pressing issues in the Republican Party.  How do they enlarge the tent and bring peoples of color into the fold?  Considering the subject matter, I am surprised that Mr. Williams has not been called on the carpet to address his concerns with the powers to be of the GOP.  I am sure Gov. Romney could have used his sage advice on such matters this past November 6th.  The film is laid out in a fact based chronology that moves at a good pace and engages the viewer.  The interviews are well-balanced and the list of those called on to testify are a legit who's who's in and out of the GOP.  Although the film is considered by some to be too long, the length is dedicated to getting the record straight and not appeasing the poltical light weights who want to be entertained by standard fare and educated/informed.  Job well done Mr. Williams and good luck on your next venture - FEAR OF A LATINO REPUBLICAN ???",1352505600,4,966,4.387640449438202
5256483,5,B0093OQE36,"It is so intriguing, thought provoking and makes me really relate to the blacks more then I thought I would ever relate to them. I have always liked people of color and respected them but did not realize I aligned with what they thought as well. WOW what a document. Love it. We are republicans need to reach out for people of all color creed and race.",1350864000,3,352,4.268656716417911
5256484,5,B0093OQE36,"I purchased the documentary, 'Fear of a Black Republican' following reviewing the trailer.  With most movies or Documentaries the trailer is as about as good as it gets, not so with Fear of a Black Republican.  The Documentary was extremely informative regarding the history of African-Americans in party politics.  The Movie looks at the progressive change from the Republican Party being a champion of the black plight in America to losing nearly all vote support in recent years.  Conversely, the movie also shows that the Democratic party has become so accustomed to getting the Black vote, that it has taken the demographic for granted.

Several people in the movie make the argument that if Blacks would be move evenly distributed in both parties, each party would have to compete for their vote and focus more on black issues.

Black Republicans make a point that the Republican National Convention fails to financially support black candidates in heavily Democratic districts because of a misguided view that by doing so African-Americans will turn out in larger numbers to vote against them.

This movie is will not make either political party happy as the author takes an honest and candid look at each parties failings.  Therefore, this documentary is highly recommended for discussion groups in college social science courses and local political party presentations.",1348099200,5,1378,5.2318181818181815
5256485,5,B0093OQE36,"I had the privilege of seeing Fear of a Black Republican when it premiered in my hometown.  Viewers of all political persuasions will appreciate this candid, thought-provoking film.  It avoids tired, partisan talking points and divisive language.  Instead, it is director Kevin Williams' plea for his own party to do a better job of reaching out to African-American voters.

Williams starts with Trenton, NJ, a city in decline after decades of government dominated by a single party.  He then looks back to the origins of the Republican party, both parties' roles in the Civil Rights movement (often misunderstood or distorted today), and a series of opportunities missed by the GOP.  Williams examines the challenges (and criticisms) faced by conservative African-Americans who want to vote their values, by African-American candidates hoping to find real support within the Republican party, and by white Republicans trying to reach across racial lines.

Fear of a Black Republican isn't a diatribe against Democrats or a pep rally for Republicans.  It is an honest look at the GOP's complex relationship with black voters.  Regardless of party, this is an interesting film with a conciliatory, rather than polarizing, tone.

For me, it is a call to action.",1346630400,12,1259,5.25
5256486,5,B0093OQE36,Accurate and it presents a picture of the problem the GOP has with reach out. The film should serve a template for the GOP to grow And spread its message to the inner cities of america. I Hope there is a part 2 to film this,1386201600,,223,3.869565217391304
5256487,5,B0093OQE36,"Thank you for making such a non-polarizing documentary about a subject (race) that is most certainly one of the MOST polarizing in our nation today.  This film does an excellent job of providing facts and interviews from both sides of the political spectrum, and in such a way that the viewer doesn't have a feeling of bias and distrust regarding the information they're being provided.  As a white conservative with pockets of liberal and moderate thought running through my mind as well, I get completely annoyed with most of the aggressively behaving pundits (Al Sharpton and Ann Coulter, I'm speaking to you!) who speak about this issue on both sides.  I applaud the filmmakers here for such an excellent video.  This is a subject worthy of the kind of factual and actual storytelling demonstrated here.

Would you consider a similarly even-toned approach on another polarizing subject?  Say the issue of Gay marriage, welfare, military spending or abortion?",1384819200,,962,5.095541401273885
5256488,5,B0093OQE36,"This is an EXCELLENT documentary, and should be watched by all freedom-loving Americans. I contributed a fair amount of money to Allen West's campaign. He was ahead in the polls, and he was ahead on election day . . . that is until late at night, when 10,000 provisional ballots mysteriously came in and could not be checked for authenticity because it was too late to do so, and West barely lost the race. In a nutshell, the power brokers stole the election from West because he was a black conservative.
This film accurately shows Catherine Davis running for U.S. Congress, yet the Republican Party did not support her with the $$ that is would have taken to win that Congressional seat. This is just one of many reasons why I am supporting what I thought I never would support . . . a 3rd political party that truly represents the voice of the people.
This documentary gives the timeline where blacks in the U.S. slowly went from the Republican Party to the Democrat Party. If the Republican Party does not wake up, then the United States of America might very well become the nation that Lenin and Marx dreamed of. The hope of the Republican Party, and the hope of America, is to fight hard to get more blacks elected to the U.S. House and Senate. This is an effort that I will personally be involved in.",1382486400,,1308,4.5
5256489,5,B0093OQE36,"This is a review for the film,""Fear of a Black Republican"".  I was directly involved in getting this film premiered in Philadelphia,at the Pearl Theater on Temple's campus. Despite resistance from the local GOP,the film was shown without a hitch!",1381363200,,246,5.15
5256490,5,B0093OQE36,Republicans have a chance to support Black republicans and they don't do enough to help. They better wise up soon.,1380499200,,114,4.75
5256491,5,B0093OQE36,"I saw the movie Fear of a Black Republican at it's premier in Tucson, AZ. My group had recently researched the role of blacks in the Republican Party and were surprised but gratified to see the essential role they played in the Republican Party. This movie addresses a vital question, what is the party doing to attract or renew minority participation? The answer would have seemed to be, not much.  The film addresses various issues of the whys and why nots of participation.
I believe this movie should certainly be seen by all Republicans interested in having a party where all segments of society are at the table.  The principles and pillars of the Republican Party should appeal to all.  I would make this movie mandatory viewing for all Republican Precinct Committee persons interested in truly serving the ideals of the Republican Party.
My wife, who was with me at the Premier, agrees completely with our assessment of this movie.
Sincerely,
Chairman Rev. Clyde Bowen

5256492,4,B0093OQE36,Sooooo true.  Everyone should watch this - all political parties and all people. Makes you see how much needs to change and how far we have to go yet.,1361059200,,150,4.172413793103448
5256493,5,B0093OQE36,"The production values are not up to Hollywood standards, but given that Williams shot it mostly on his own, I think they are adequate and surprisingly good.

The premise here is that everyone fears a Black Republican, including Republicans. The Republican party mostly works on the idea that white people support it, and white people are not interested in what happens in the Black community. Well, not exactly disinterested so much as simply acknowledging that the Black community is a sort of Democrat concession. Stirring up the pot by going after the Black vote would simply make Democrats push to get themselves more voters in largely Black precincts. Better to let sleeping dogs lie, so to speak.

The film is full of stories about just this dynamic. And each story, and each interview, looks at the situation from a different angle so that in total one comes to understand it, at least for a beginner, in full. Cornel West says both parties simply want power, presumably because power means jobs and money and influence and stature. There is no real ideology here, simply power over public resources or to gain private resources. That is why the thesis that the Black community is a Democrat concession just makes sense, for the two parties. One Black Republican complains that the Democrats take advantage of this to largely ignore the Black community because Democrats believe Blacks will never leave them anyway.

One Republican Black Congressional candidate in Atlanta's Black suburban city precincts suffers in dire angst as she gets no support from the Republican state and local establishment. But out of around 60,000 votes cast, she gets about a third. Not enough to win, but enough to show Black Atlantans are listening.",1356307200,,1737,5.003460207612457
5256494,5,B0093OQE36,"Fear of a Black Republican had it's premier in Salina, Kansas at the Salina Art Center Cinema a few months ago.  The movie is well produced by Co-Producers Kevin & Tamara Williams of Trenton, New Jersey and was very timely for the 2012 elections we have all just lived through.  The movie tackles head on the struggles the Republican Party has had in reaching out to Black Republicans. It portrays the early and not so successful efforts of past GOP Chairman Ken Mellman and his efforts to reach out to African American Republicans which really only amounted to lip service.  As the film continues, the Republican Party begins to have some success after Black Republican Michael Steele was elected Chairman of the Republican National Committee.  Where in the past it was all talking points and lip service by past leaders, Michael Steele seemed to have a plan of action that was actually working. What did the GOP think it was doing when it dumped Michael Steele?  He was the best thing they had going for it!  Fear of a Black Republican is fair and balanced although some might consider the title provocative the movie is not.  The producers are straight forward and take a fair approach in its interviews with Republicans and Democrats.  Some of those interviewed are Edward Brooke, Tavis Smiley, Ann Coulter, Maxine Waters, Peter King, Michelle Malkin, and Michael Steele.  The documentary was especially telling in the 60 minutes style interview with Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee as it appeared Mitt was giving his stump speech and Mike Huckabee was speaking from the heart!  Which he was indeed!",1353715200,,1601,4.874538745387454
5256495,5,B0093OQE36,"Yes, indeed, demographics! And if Karl Rove and his faithful followers had fully considered the options that producer Kevin Williams made clear in his thought-provoking production, he and other establishment Republicans would not today be about to witness President Obama's upcoming second inaugural address in January. Rove, Dick Morris, Ann Coulter and others could have helped in creating a political formula to attract Black Americans into the Party of Lincoln, instead of relying on an outdated strategy that has produced repetitious defeats in 2008 and 2012 for promising Black Republican candidates such as Mia Love in Utah, Alan West in Florida, and Lynn Swann in Pennsylvania.
  Consider, as Speaker Gingrich has pointed out we even lost ground with Asian-Americans in 2012! That's right, a hard-working, over-achieving group that truly should be a very easy fit into the Republican tent. Instead, they went over to the Democratic circus! Why? Williams provides us with a number of clues in his meticulously researched DVD on the dearth of Blacks in Republicans ranks. Namely, what are we offering them in contrast to the Democrats?  How about offering them the truth? That's right, point out the success of Black Americans who embrace and embody the values of the Republican Party and shout those results from the rooftops! Get these men and women to run and support them!
  Face it, fellow elephants, to the extent that we forget lessons forged for over a century that fellow Republicans such as Lincoln, Eisenhower, Taft, Reagan, Buchanan and Russell Kirk have bequeathed to Americans of all races, we will continue to falter. In one of the more revealing clips in the Williams film he interviews Michelle Malkin, who offers those who choose to listen superb advice. TELL BLACK AMERICANS THE TRUTH! And do it in ways that will challenge the knee-jerk reaction for Blacks to be Democrats. We are Republicans, the Party of Lincoln, that freed Blacks from slavery! We are pro-Black! And Williams gives us valuable clues in his story such as ... be principled, but practical, use humor as well as gravitas, be genuinely humble & likable, and be passionate and gritty when vital issues are on the line. Candidate Romney failed to follow this path in that he campaigned in a tuxedo without passion. In contrast the ""Lincoln Approach"" means to be pro-life, pro-opportunity, pro-America, pro-Constitution, pro-freedom, and to take care of our own instead of playing (and paying!) to be policeman of the world, when we need to nation-build our very own nation at a time of great economic crisis. Williams' production has contributed handsomely to bring these issues into focus, but potential viewers need to buy it, study it, and put it to use!",1353456000,2,2747,5.095555555555555

8535306,5,B0093OQE36,"Found this by accident while searching for something else and was intrigued by the title.  Was particularly satisfied with the historical aspect since so many seem not to know until I make sure they do.  This is a must see for everyone regardless of political affiliation.  Maybe when the political parties target recruitment to people  as Americans instead of groups by color, language or eye  shape things may change.  Doubt it though.

8535308,5,B0093OQE36,"As a U.S. History teacher, I found this film to be a refreshingly honest, academic inquiry into the American two-party political system and how black conservatives from both urban and rural areas are received in politics - by Democrats and Republicans.  I plan to use the film in class and am eager to see the class discussions it is sure to generate.  Kevin Williams is fearless in the most polite and disarming manner - I cant wait to see what he does next.",1422489600,,459,4.518072289156627
8535309,3,B0093OQE36,"Nothing new here, the same old rhetoric of 'we need to outreach and go into the communities."" of course this no actual action. The documentary felt like 3 hours, it just lagged on & on. The defining point of the doc. is that republicans just don't get it and never will, I feel sorry for black republicans who truly support the GOP agenda but get no respect. Although, I'm dumbfounded that BR complain that they get no respect from Democrats, why would you, you disagree fundamentally on issues. In turn, they need to point that finger at their own party who clearly see no room for them.

Also, they need to stop focusing on the racist history of the Democrats b/c in return liberals shine light on the racist history of the Republican party, which is far more recent.

In all honestly, neither party has resolved  the plight of black people; however, the Democrats at least outreach with action and not talk.",1394323200,,910,4.604938271604938
8535310,5,B0093OQE36,"Fear of a Black Republican examines the history of the black vote in American politics while providing a glimpse into its present and future.  The unique part of this documentary is that it focuses on both the voter and those seeking votes.  It exposes the shortcomings and ignorance of too many that are in a position to change the status quo.

I would strongly recommend whether black or white, Republican or Democrat.  Our country needs more informed viewers no matter what your political lean.",1393372800,,497,4.880952380952381

8535312,5,B0093OQE36,"I had the opportunity to see this documentary at the Pocono Film Festival in PA. As someone who is very involved with local politics as well as on the State level, I can truly say that it hit a home run. I have seen first hand how the GOP has written off the Black community, not because they don't want the vote but because they feel it costs too much money to get their votes. The interviews with the party leadership makes this pretty clear. I have recommended this film to many State Committee members and I highly recommend it to anyone who has a desire to fix this problem.",1390608000,,579,4.2727272727272725
8535313,5,B0093OQE36,This Documentary fully opened my eyes to my suspicions.

8535314,5,B0093OQE36,"Fear Of A Black Republican sheds light on a scary and depressing, if not shocking, truth that neither Dems or the GOP want to address.  This is a film that needs to be seen and discussed but, sadly, probably won't because, like most of the individuals featured in the film, viewers may end up asking themselves, ""What's the point?""

Fear Of A Black Republican both bothered and confused me but in a good way.  There are no partisan tricks here, just straightforward honesty.  It was a watershed moment for us when Obama was elected to this country's highest office but SURPRISE!!! SURPRISE!!!, he's a Democrat.  A sign of real progress will be when the Republicans are able to duplicate that feat.  Fear Of A Black Republican asks if they are capable.  Now that I've seen the film, I ask, do they even want to?",1387065600,2,810,4.583333333333333
