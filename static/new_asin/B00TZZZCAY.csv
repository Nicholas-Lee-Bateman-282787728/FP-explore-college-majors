8703651,2,B00TZZZCAY,"The film centers on two hooligans, Chris (Chris Bell) who runs north London and Johnny (Alan Lund) who runs south London. I am not too sure what these Hooligans did for money. The film shows them collecting money, almost robbing a truck, and performing street dentistry. Chris and Johnny were in Bosnia together. There are numerous flashbacks. I am assuming the flashback was supposed to connect to the current situation, but I couldn't make the connection. I did notice Chris couldn't keep his cigarette lit and puffed on it in a very annoying fashion. The film goes from black and white to color at random.

This wasn't for me.",1437696000,,629,4.770642201834862
