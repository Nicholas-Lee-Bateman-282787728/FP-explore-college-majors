5008759,5,B006O94DLI,"It has felt like literally forever since I first finished this series online. After the first box set was released, it was agonizing how long they took to release this second season, especially considering how Eureka Seven set one and two came out at almost the same time. Now I can finally complete this treasured anime.

For those unfamiliar with the series, Code Geass is kind of a mix between the action and mecha from alternate universe Gundam series and Death Note. It has an involved and dynamic storyline coupled with awesome music and character designs by the legendary all female group, Clamp. What is really amazing about the story is how the two protagonists, Lelouch and Suzaku, are on opposing sides and each have passionate views on the actions that they take. You'll find that on both sides of the fence, there are interesting characters that you want to root for, and both will take massive casualties that keep you on the edge of your seat. The second season introduces many new characters and further investigates geass power and where it originates, so do yourself a favor and give this a try after watching season 1.",1329004800,2,1137,4.771573604060913
5008760,5,B006O94DLI,"I've been waiting for them to release the complete box set of Code Geass R2 for years! I refused to buy the four individual volumes that originally were for sale (each volume costs about the same as this complete collection, outrageous) and waited for this collection to go with my complete season 1 collection. Buy this!! any fan of the show will love it, and even if you have not seen the show get this (and season 1) besides Death Note this is my favorite anime! And the price is totally worth it!",1328745600,,500,4.387096774193548
5008761,5,B006O94DLI,"I have to say it's about time they released the box set for R2, I bought the first season a while ago. I first watched the series subbed years ago and I was ecstatic when they dubbed it.",1328572800,3,186,3.9210526315789473
5008762,5,B006O94DLI,"I watched this anime online a couple years ago and i was super impressed. The english voice acting was very good and the animation definately impressed me. So a year after watching it i decided i wanted to add this title to my anime library..........however i found there was the 1st season box set and then singles of r2 so i waited patiently and sure enough my patience was rewarded. Now when most people hear that its a thought provoking mech series all they hear is mech and go ""oh its just another mech series"" WRONG!!!!!!!!!! this series does have mechs but its more of an evil genius type of mech series,the main character lelouch will remind some people of light Yagami from death note in the sense of insanely smart highschool student wants to change the world because hes a bit unhappy with the way things are. now if you want the storyline then look it up because im just here to say that its a title worth having especially if you like thought provoking violence and espionage.",1328572800,23,989,4.5307262569832405

5008766,5,B006O94DLI,"I looove this series! I checked it out at the library where I work and after watching it, needed to own it. I laughed in some parts, cried in others. I will say, in the beginning I was a little messed up because I've watched Bleach and the first time I heard Ichigo's voice come out of Lelouch's mouth...I was like "" why Ichigo why!!!"". Then I snapped out of it. One thing about this series-you MUST pay attention to what's going on, as there are twists and double crosses going on. A cool mecha anime.

5008774,1,B006O94DLI,"I do not know how this is getting 5 star reviews. They dropped the original grounds of the story completely giving rather lame or no explanations to everything that happened in season 1. Essentially the story starts over and resembles that more of a Yaoi and over exerted fan service rather then an epic political struggle mecha thriller. Really ashamed, this series had so much potential.",1392249600,,389,4.909090909090909
5008775,1,B006O94DLI,"First off, I will say that I love this series, but it is not a review of the show but rather for the product and trying to bring awareness of the product's availability and bootleg problems plaguing the marketplace. This is not a seller problem, but these will be found at conventions, online retailers, and brick and mortar stores that don't know better.

In 2012 Bandai Entertainment USA went out of business. Since then many bootlegs have hit the market, especially for the popular shows.

These bootlegs typically come in a clear case and are nearly indistinguishable between the retail copy. These bootlegs are using the same disc count, disc art, and are copying the DVD sleeves art and information as you would see with the official retail release  1:1. The DVDs they're using for these are DVD-5's, meaning that the max they can put on the disc is about 4.75 Gigs while the official retail releases use DVD-9's. Due to the fact it's impossible to tell by looking at the DVD set, the only way to know for sure if you have a bootleg or retail copy is to check the disc's properties in your computer.

The only way you will know for sure that you got an official retail copy, will be:
1. If you buy *directly* from Amazon or Rightstuf. Their warehouse stock comes directly from the publisher.
2. If you buy new it will come with a security sticker.
3. The final test to see if it is legit is to put it into your computer and see if the disc is less than or greater than 4.75 Gigs. If it's greater than that, then you should be good.
Example: [...]
(note: the bootleg on the right was not an Anime Legends bootleg, so they may have copied the disc file name for these as well)

I hope you found this information useful. There's not many people who know about this and I'd hate for people to continue falling prey to buying bootlegs.

Not only is this happening to Bandai's Anime Legends sets, but it's also happening to Discotek Media's sets as well.

5008776,5,B006O94DLI,"This show is one of the best animes out there and I feel that the price being asked for it is fair. As for the the actual product, it arrived in perfect condition and all the discs were clean and without a scratch. There is a chance that the holders for the discs on the inside of the case might be broken but it didn't affect anything. Case is wrapped and has a friendly note from the seller and has seals attached on all ends meaning they weren't messed with before. They play on any DVD player in North America and whatever that region code that corresponds too.

5008783,5,B006O94DLI,"This is a brilliant second half of an overall unique and captivating story. I love it with all my heart and would recommend it to anyone interested in unusual fantasy stories with complex characters and intelligently crafted plots. It's anything but typical. I would love to write a long and intricate review but I'm really lazy right now. And anyway, the best way to appreciate this kind of story is to simply watch it. The more you read of it beforehand, the more spoilers you'd come across. Don't ruin it for yourself. Go watch it and you will feel the full impact of it much more, like I did when I first watched it without knowing anything about it. As for the DVD itself, it's got all the important options available (English subtitles, English dub, Japanese audio), and the extras (specifically the audio commentary) are interesting, amusing, and insightful. The subtitles are also very good. I bought mine from the rightstuf.com seller shawnek. I have no doubt that my DVD was legitimate since this seller and his website have a very good reputation, but if you are buying from anyone else beware of bootlegs and always ask questions to make sure you're getting the real thing before you order.

5008791,4,B006O94DLI,The story takes place one year after the end of the first season and it doesn't take long for the action to pick up where it left off. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who was a fan of the first season. My only complaint is that there were times when the story felt a bit rushed.,1358035200,,291,4.0344827586206895

5008793,5,B006O94DLI,"I will keep this review short and sweet to avoid spoilers for season 1.

Story: Basically, this story follows a young man, Lelouch, in his story of vengeance against a cruel world using the power of Geass. Geass is a special power that is different for each user, his power being able to have complete control over whoever he makes eye contact with. Even without his power, he is a brilliant strategist, and this causes many different plot twists, so you can never predict what will happen next. All the characters in this anime are top notch, not a single one is dislikable in some way... Well there was Nina, but thats aside the point. Even the villains manage to be almost as epic as our main protagonist.
Bottom line a truely fantastic story, arguably one of the best ever seen in anime, with a memorable cast of characters to support it.

Visuals: The art style looks really unique, although this makes the attempts at fan service ( Yeah there is fan service) almost creepy looking. Also, there was no noticable CG, so that's a HUGE plus. However, the best thing about the visuals is the combat scenes. Each fight is intense, and goes perfectly with the overall theme of the story. That said, while the fights do look great, they are nothing we haven't seen before.
Bottom line, the animation is really good, but nothing revolutionary.

Audio: Before I say anything about the sound, I simply must applaud the excellent English voice cast in this anime. Johnny Yong Bosch was absolutely PERFECT as Lelouch, I can't stress enough that you watch this dubbed. All the actors fit their characters well. There were few are off, but for the most part they weren't that important to the story and you could tune them out. The music, as great as it was, didn't really stick out. Aside from the Opening and Endings which, like Season 1 were amazing.
Bottom line amazing dub and great soundtrack.

Should you watch it? YES. Easily one of the best anime series I have seen, with enough mind games, epic fights, great story arcs, and even a bit of romance to please any viewer. Not to be missed if you have any taste in anything.",1354665600,,2121,4.588390501319261

5008796,5,B006O94DLI,"For the past seven years I've been watching A LOT of anime. At this point, i believe i've seen over 250 anime. This includes long ones, like bleach, naruto, and detective conan. I would have to say this ranks as one of the best anime I've ever seen. The story is masterful, on the first time through it may seem as though it was rushed, and not quite so good. On the second time through, you start to notice things, and on the third time through you realize just how great of an anime this is. If you've seen the first season and liked it, then you should really watch this one. On a final note, in my opinion, the ending is one of the best ones I've seen. I wouldn't go as far as to call it happy, in fact it is kind of sad, it is beautiful though, and it helps to bring closure to this legendary anime and the story of Lelouch.",1352764800,2,829,4.03030303030303

5008800,5,B006O94DLI,"The beginning of this season can be jarring to those that have watched the first season, but it quickly explains itself within the first two episodes. The show has good mech combat sequences without detracting from the story or the characters, which is very important since I consider the story to be more important than any flashing lights or lasers. If you're looking at the second season, you've probably have already seen the first season and know that this show has high quality writing behind it.

The case that this second season is provided within has a much better design than the case of the first season. The first season had the discs packed in very tightly, but this one has more space between the discs.",1350086400,,717,4.690476190476191

5008802,5,B006O94DLI,"Code Geass is a story about a young man named Lelouch. Lelouch is a genius, and the son of the King. Japan is ruled by a foreign and tyrannical emperor. There is a poorly organized resistance group that is trying to take back their homeland. Lelouch decides to become their leader and to take revenge on his father for his sisters poor condition. He gains the power of Geass. His power allows him to make anyone he wants do exactly as he says; but he can only use it on each person once. The story tells of his rise to power and all of the tragedy that befalls him and those close to him.

This 2nd season continues the story and is as good as the 1st. It's very tragic though. Lelouch did everything to protect his beloved little sister, but he suffers terribly b/c of his Geass and his desire to take revenge for her. The people around him also suffer immensely as well. The drama of this story is even more heavy in this chapter of the story.

This anime has everything. Great story, animation, voicing, music, and lots of great characters. There is a lot of fan service and comic relief. There is also tons of action and drama. Code Geass is excellent.",1350000000,,1156,4.347222222222222

5008809,5,B006O94DLI,"The show review:

Ichiro Okouchi + CLAMP = A force to be reckoned with. The first time I watched Code Geass was when it originally aired on Adult Swim in 2008...And between then and now, I've probably watched the entire series at least 4 or 5 times. Why? It is simply the greatest anime I've ever watched. Aside from The plot and character depth being the best I've ever seen in an anime, what really appealed to me was the brilliant combination of intelligence, philosophy, psychology, action, twists, and plot complexity in the show. Every aspect of the show has you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end, and keeps you watching episode after episode until you've hit the exciting twist at the end. Every second of Lelouch's life is a lie: hiding Zero's identity as a student at school, and hiding Lelouch vi Brittania's identity as Zero. The character takes on three identities: the rebellion leader, the student and the exiled prince. The problem is...those who know one, cannot know the others...While the plot is similar to your everyday ""heroes tale"" type story....The main character acquires a power (or object) and then sets out on an adventure circled around that power or object. However, the normal flow usually includes a series of dues ex machina twists that eventually elevate the plot to the ridiculous. The difference with Code Geass is that there are NO such twists. While Lelouch continues to face increasingly difficult opponents, he solves his problems not with obtaining a new power, but with pure intellect and the limited resources available to him at the time. Lelouch the strategist and brilliant tactician, whose every move is carefully planned out and calculated in advance. It is nearly impossible to tire of Lelouch finding his way out of unique near hopeless situations with nothing but his brainpower. The twists in this series come from the new challenges that constantly manifest in attempt to foil Lelouch's goal of Brittania's ultimate destruction and from his brilliant solutions to utterly hopeless situations. The show isn't entirely strategy and chess inspired war scenarios though...The darkness of the plot and some of Lelouch's methods are countered by the brightness of CLAMP animation and the eternally joyful characters. In summary, this series is the absolute perfect combination of bright, cheerful animation to a dark and suspenseful, yet deep and philosophical plot.

The product review:

Some disappointment: It isn't Blu-Ray. As a result, you get 8 discs which are very prone to scratches and general wear and tear over the years. However, the discs fit comfortably in an efficient arrangement. The discs are pretty difficult to get out unless you grab right right side of the disc. I have a habit of checking for scratches and as it turns out the seventh disc had a pretty nasty looking scratch on it, but it works just fine nonetheless. And after gladly testing all of the discs, they all work just fine. I don't usually buy anime, since I get the Funimation channel or watch them online or Netflix, when I saw that R2 was out, I knew I had to buy it. Would I buy another copy if it came out on Blu-Ray? Absolutely. Code Geass is most definitely an anime legend.",1346112000,,3225,4.881386861313868
5008810,5,B006O94DLI,"Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebelion R2 starts you right where the series left off. I would say this season is just as amazing as the first one, if not better! This box set contains 25 episodes with 8 disks. It also includes clean openings/endings and some other cool little features. The second season of Code Geass, is way more intense than the previous season, with more plot twists, characters, and those key moments where Lelouch always has something up his sleeve.

When we got it home and put it in to start watching, one of the disks was dammaged right off the bat. Then when we went to return it there were none in stock at any bestbuy within 50miles, so we had to wait 3 weeks to get a new one in the mail. Screw you bestbuy. So when i found out that R2 finally had a box set like this I decided to order from amazon, first thing ever ordered from here for me too. Got my product much faster then the estimated delivery. Not one scratch on any of the disks too! works perfectly.
If you are an anime fan who has not experienced code geass season 1 or 2, YOU NEED TO. This anime is great! As i said both mine and my girlfriend's favorite.",1342137600,,764,4.0
5008813,5,B006O94DLI,"Although I know there are mixed feelings about the ending of Code Geass, I personally thought it was an absolutely fabulous end to a wonderful series.  If you want a really good review of the series, head over to Anime News Network's website.  They have a very well-written and very thorough review of both the first season and the second season of Code Geass that are worth the read.

Now, as some other people have said, if you want to purchase this DVD set, I would suggest not buying from Amazon.com.  $67.00 brand new from Amazon and starting price of $45.03 for a set from other sellers?  Give me a break.  You'd be better off going elsewhere to purchase this set.  The cheapest I have found this set for online is Right Stuf for $29.99.  However, I bought mine from Best Buy over this past weekend.  Best Buy currently has the box sets of both the first season AND second season on sale for $19.99 each.  Take note that they do not have these online, so you will have to find a store near you that sells it.  If Best Buy stores closest to you are sold out, your best bet would be Right Stuf.  Either way, don't buy from Amazon.

EDIT AS OF 6/14/2012: Amazon lowered their prices down so that they are now selling the set at $36.64.  Even so, Right Stuf (online) at $29.99 and Best Buy (in the store-they are back-ordered online) at $19.99 are still cheaper.",1339372800,,1364,4.382470119521912
5008814,5,B006O94DLI,"such a great series, but if you're a fan and looking to get this, i'd reccomend going to bestbuy, they have it there for $30, less than half of the lowest priced one on here. good luck.",1337558400,,185,4.027027027027027
5008815,5,B006O94DLI,"this box set is amazing! strait forward code geass no extra bunch of stuff wich makes me sad i would like behind scenes. but regardless of that its a bunch of disks and good fun its amazing awesome and i have not been let down at all. but it, its awesome for your collections. if i could give it 10 i would.",1337472000,,307,3.967741935483871
5008816,5,B006O94DLI,"I think this anime is amazing. Great characters, and great story! But it should not be sold for 75$ like wtf?! I also was able to get this for only 30$ at my best buy",1335312000,,166,3.7714285714285714
5008817,5,B006O94DLI,"No need to talk about basic plot since we are talking about season two. Go watch season one if you don't know the what the story is about by now.

But as story telling goes, this is the most insane roller coaster ride I have ever watched, much more than the first season. There is gleefull delight with writers of this story constantly turning situations upside down, & inside out, with almost every episode revealing one of those, ""Oh wow, I can't believe that just happened"" plot twists (often more than one of those events in one short 25 minute episode). All the way to final scene, you are left guessing who is playing who? Who is really the chessmaster & who are really the pawns? What the hell is Lelouch's final end game? Double crosses, and double-double crosses keep things inventively twisted & compelling to the very end. All the while done in a very over the top theatrical style, and for the biggest stakes - world domination. The style comes accross as if our animated actors are performing to a live audience on a stage, and not subtly played to a camera. Everything about this show is done in grand style, and it makes for an epic experience in my opinion.

My head was seriously spinning after watching this series...not in a bad way, because it all makes sense within it's own strange reality, and the story progresses masterfully. But watching it all unfold is quite the twisty rollercoaster of a ride.",1333929600,,1422,4.594488188976378
5008818,5,B006O94DLI,"I'm one of those people who likes order, especially with TV shows and my wonderful anime collection.  Plus, I have a limited amount of space, so complete seasons are what I go for.  FINALLY, this second season has come out.  I'm so happy I waited and didn't buy Part 1, etc.

Definitely worth it to buy this complete package, and in the long run it actually saves money.  You can get the complete season for around $30, and if you look back in the search menu, just Part 1 alone is around $25, so you get the math going on here.

As for the actual show, it is perhaps one of the most phenomenal animes I have ever had the pleasure to come across.  Lelouch never ceases to amaze as he thinks himself out of tough scrapes better than Iron Man can talk himself out of a courtroom.  He is one of my favorite hero/villain/anti-villains of all time.  I'm still undecided as to if he was truly a hero, truly a villain, or a little bit of both.  That's the beauty of this anime.  The plot is fantastic, the action is exciting and engaging, there's witty dialogue, there's a decent amount of fanservice for the guys watching this show (though as a girl, I enjoy Lelouch), the characters are absolutely lovable, and like with any good anime, there is a surprising amount of emotion and real lessons packed in.  This anime really makes you think about what you would be willing to fight for and the dangers of power even if it is won through good intentions.  The voice acting for the English version is top notch, Lelouch having a certain type of epic monotone and word inflection that makes him seem that much more lethal.  Props to Johnny Young Bosch.  You could actually watch this show either way--Japanese or English.  Nothing is lost, in my opinion, between the versions.

The ending (no spoilers, I promise) will leave you satisfied, shaking your head with a little smile as you say, ""Ah, Lelouch.""  This is definitely worth your time and your precious bank account.  You won't be disappointed.",1333065600,,1991,4.526610644257703
5008819,5,B006O94DLI,"First I want to start off by saying for some weird reason Amazon doesn't have it in stock and some of the other sellers want over $100 dollars to buy it from them... Don't make me laugh. Head on over to Rightstuf and pay no more than $29.99 just like I did to get this amazing series finale of Code Geass.

Onto the review -
As one of Bandai's final releases I feel it was very well done, the packaging was a good sized case just like what they released Wolf's Rain Perfect Collection in. It held all 8 discs nicely without scratching up anything, although it had no inserts which doesn't really matter to me, it did get the job done and that's really all you can ask for if you ask me. This seasons box set is bigger than the first seasons as well, I'm not sure why season 1's set is smaller but it is if you don't already own it like I do.

This is the final season of Code Geass at the moment (a third season is planned in Japan but that's a completely different topic) and it finishes things up nicely with amazing animation, more character development, good DVD extras (Audio Commentaries, Key Animation Galleries, Prize Announcements, Extra Flash: Baba Theater Redux, Textless Openings, Textless Endings, Extra Prologues and Previews). I loved the final episode, it was pretty touching and I don't want to give much away in this review, so no spoilers but there is a pretty major character death too, along with others of course but yep just to say that without giving away names or anything for those who haven't seen R2 (lol).

Basically if you are looking for this set at this point in time head on over to Rightstuf or Anime Corner Store to pick it up for under $37.98 from either of those online shops I also use, the prices on Amazon are crazy.. literally.

Another thing is pick this and season 1 up quick while you still can. For those who didn't know, Bandai is done releasing anymore DVDs/Blurays as of January 2012 so what they have now is all they have until their licenses expire and once that happen its all over and the DVD sets you might want will be gone and out of print. Anything you need from Bandai Entertainment pick up soon is the case I'd say.",1331337600,42,2173,4.371287128712871
5008820,5,B006O94DLI,"I bought 2 seasen of Code Geass, but 1st seasen not yet arrived. But I started to watch 2nd seasen, because a few years ago I watched this series. And it became my best anime!!

I didn'd have any expectation to English dub, but the Lelouch's voice acter in English worked very good. I usually liked Fukuyama Jun's voice as Lelouch and I thought any voice actor can't do Lelouch's voice. But, it was wrong. Well, I still like Jp voice acters.

I want to mention about discs, they are beautiful!! Inside of case, there are 8 discs with different imagen. But, I had to take care of the discs to use...

And I liked very much extras, too. It really one of best series for me!!",1329782400,3,672,4.275590551181103
5008821,5,B006O94DLI,"The first season was great, everyone can admit to that.  But this!? THIS!??? This is amazing! Honestly the best of mecha-anime or anime period.  Code Geass R2 transcends the boundaries of the original season.  The character development is thrilling, the action is fast paced and exciting.  The animation is fantastic and fresh!  This is among my favorite series for that alone, but that's not all.  There is SOOO much more to it, but I'd rather not spoil it for you.  If you loved the first series, what are you waiting for?  This box set has your name on it.",1329177600,11,559,4.575757575757576

Thank you Anime Legends.,1329091200,,296,4.4
8501677,5,B006O94DLI,"My life was on hold after finishing the first season of Code Geass and realizing the DVDs of R2 I got as a gift was only part of the season.  As one of my favorite anime of all time, I wanted the fitting ""Anime Legends"" edition to match my S1, and it was worth passing up Prime shipping for.  The package arrived when they said it would, and it was shrink-wrapped and in perfect condition.  All features of all the discs worked without fail, as I binged-- er, *checked* as soon as possible.

One note is that the case is about one and a half times as thick as a normal DVD case, if that matters to someone out there, but that's to be expected with eight discs packed inside (the ""Anime Legends"" edition of the first season is standard thickness, with six discs).

I can't recommend this highly enough, mostly as a show, but also as a purchase.  Thanks you!",1503100800,,856,4.285714285714286

I was able to get them working by spending more money to get the disc cleaned which costed me 18 extra dollars. I honestly don't care if its a professional boot lag version which is very obvious, but the disc conditions even after sealed was pretty bad. I don't recommend anyone to buy this. Just get the blue ray version.

Other then that, this anime is really good, you should already know what your getting when you buy this, but the physical condition was really baaaaaaaaaad.",1476057600,,655,4.646551724137931
