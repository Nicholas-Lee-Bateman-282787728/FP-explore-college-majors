7366577,5,B013JBH0CC,Just as described.,1449100800,2,18,5.333333333333333
7366578,3,B013JBH0CC,This would be great but for the digital copy only gave me the first half of season one. Very frustrating. Everything else is as I hoped.,1448668800,10,136,4.269230769230769
7366579,5,B013JBH0CC,"Perfect in every way.  Hope Santa brings me a proper BluRay device in order to fully appreciate the cinematography
of the DVDs; I already love the characters, casting, costumes.  Being totally obsessed with all things OUTLANDER,
a gift for myself to complete the present droughtlander status.  I purchased original DVDs and these will make it a
cinch to have copies in both homes for happy viewing.

The flask is charming and just what the doctor ordered.  A lady can carry just a wee bit of something akin to Colum's
Rheinish wine in it......definitely a conversation piece.  The pictorial and photos are a nice part of the package too and the
packaging of the S1-P1 box makes keeping the 16 episodes together in a particularly nice package.  Great gift idea for
fellow or other OUTLANDER fans.",1448150400,18,795,4.844444444444444
7366580,5,B013JBH0CC,"AWESOME SET!!!  If you love Outlander, you are going to love this!  It comes so nicely packaged with fantastic extras!  Love it!!",1447891200,2,129,4.7727272727272725
7366581,5,B013JBH0CC,"Beautiful presentation befitting the Outlander universe. I knew I wanted this version the moment I saw it. I'd been waiting to buy the full Season 1, but couldn't decide which ones to get. I was introduced to Outlander through the Starz TV production. Little did I know when I started watching in May that the scope of the adventure ran so deep. Over the summer I read all 8 books -- they are absolutely sublime -- and I look forward with great anticipation to Book 9. The universe Diana Gabaldon has created on the written page is a masterpiece  and its physical form through the magic of film matches it in scope and spirit. I can't say enough good things about the cast and production values. They transport ME every time to 18th century Scotland! Almost as good as actually going through the stones at Craigh na Dun.

As I started to say -- the presentation of this version is beautiful. The box is well made & sturdy to last for years to come  if you like that sort of thing as I do. Totally fun to open. Inside is a hard-back thick-paged book with a marvelous embossed cover, beautifully printed with color photography from the series, with a ribbon page marker. Lots of Jamie & Claire photos and other great shots from the first season.

Each open spread in the book houses 1 DVD. There are a total of 7 discs as follows:

4 DVDs of the complete series. Each contains 4 episodes, plus special features.

1 DVD bonus disk of too much stuff to list here! On location info, boot camp for cast, walk through the sets, casting, wardrobe, AND The Reckoning Extended Episode. Plus deleted scenes with an introduction before each scene by Ronald Moore explaining the reasoning behind each one which is very cool. This DVD also has the Yule Log scene which is very charming and accompanied by soundtrack adaptation. Oh, there are Outlander Podcasts on this DVD also.

2 CDs of Bear McCrearys exquisite soundtrack, with 3 bonus tracks on disc 2. (these housed on 1 spread)

The boxs pull-out drawer holds the stand up frame with 5 accompanying photos that slide into it so you can change them out. The frame is made of the same material as the box, so very sturdy. Also in the pull-out drawer is the flask, which I love! The one I received is engraved with Sassenach, which immediately brought a smile.

There you have it. A beautiful presentation of an outstanding series and story for the ages. Very happy with my purchase.",1447200000,149,2422,4.549425287356322
7366582,5,B013JBH0CC,"I gave this 5 stars because I have loved the series...BUT...I have purchased the single season 1 and 2 and also this Ultimate collection. I have had to return them all because they will not play in either of my BluRay players or my computer. I just received my second Ultimate collection and the same issue. I will have to return this one as well.
Is anyone else having this same issue? I have talked to Amazon and they have been great about the returns but do not have any information as to why this would continue to happen. I am beyond frustrated and confused. I bought this for the extras and would love to own a copy that actually works.",1447200000,3,642,4.31404958677686

7366589,5,B013JBH0CC,"This Ultimate Collection of Outlander: Season One is wonderful!  If you're a big fan of the Outlander television series, this is a MUST.  A few notes, for those who are buying this in later years.  It does come with the digital code to get the full season (both parts), however, you will only be able to access it via the UltraViolet platform. As of today, the Movies Anywhere platform does support Sony Studios titles, but as this is considered a television program, it only appears in my UV account only.  Also, the ""expiration date""  for the digital version states, ""After 12/31/18, redemption, streaming and downloading of this program may not be available.""  Other notes:  This title is not eligible for Sony Rewards Points or the Sony Pictures Store Outlander Season 1 Offer (movies on sale for $5.99 or less) as mentioned on the enclosed flyer.

All that being said, the packaging for this set is a delight, and I'm so happy to have this in my collection. I'm not sure it's worth it to all fans to pay the same $90 I shelled out, but I was more than willing.",1509235200,5,1065,4.568421052631579

7366625,5,B013JBH0CC,"I have seen a lot of complaining about this set.  But, I find it beautiful.  This set is pricey, but it is meant for the hardcore Outlander fan.  This is not the kind of set you buy someone if they are just someone who enjoys watching the show.  Outlander is the newest phenomenon in the GOT tradition and as such, the fan base demands more in depth looks and special features for the serious fans.  The set is beautifully done...the complete season on blu ray, the complete soundtrack on 2 cds, a gorgeous picture book for storage of all the discs, an engraved flask, and a set of lithos from the show with a frame to match...plus all the  bonus features.  It's a set made in Highland Heaven for the serious fan!  But, if you aren't that serious fan, be kind and purchase the less expensive disc sets.",1482451200,,802,4.371621621621622

For the first time, 5-5-2017, I went to play the actual episodes and they don't work at all. Not on the dvd, computer, blu-ray, or ps3. EVERY SINGLE DVD DISC!

7366628,5,B013JBH0CC,"Absolutely loved it in every way!  There were hours of special features and deleted scenes to watch.  The book itself that holds the DVDs is absolutely stunning.

Finally, the set includes music CDs from the series which include bonus cuts. I was so thrilled to find this boxed set I actually bought a blue-ray player to accommodate the discs. The price for this set is an outstanding value considering what you would pay for the blue-ray and music CDs separately. I'm very impressed with the quality of this item. The only thing not included in this set is the Scotch for the flask, but that's easy enough to come by! If you are a fan of the Outlander books and the series, you will absolutely love this set.

The ultimate collection box itself is very pretty.
DVD book is well made and durable.
I really like the paper frame and photo collection, it can be a nice decoration for a hardcore Outlander fan but I'm not going to use them (at least not anytime soon).
The words engraved on the included flask were crooked and as a person with signs of ocd, I was very disappointed with it but I'm not going to return the boxset so I just have to get over this error.

If ONLY I could choose the Flask I get? One of the items that comes in this collection is:
An Engraved Flask with one of three unique quotes from the series

  Sassenach (""Outlander"" you could be English or Irish If your Scotish not be up ta snuf)
  Je Suis Prest (""I am ready"" if your French not be up ta snuf)
  Sl&agrave;inte Mhath (""Good Health"" if your Irish not be up ta snuf)
Being Irish I'd prefer the last one.
Can hardly wait ta get this in.

7366774,5,B013JBH0CC,"Outlander is one of the best series on television today. The source material, Diana Gabaldon's series of novels, is phenomenal. The production values are exceptional. Setting, scenery, writing, costuming, languages- they're all done with an incredible authenticity and tremendous amount of research. The acting is phenomenal. The last two episodes, in particular, are Emmy worthy, even though they weren't nominated.  Tobias Menzies and Sam Heughan give performances of a lifetime and should have been recognized and honored for those performances.  Caitriona Balfe, as Claire, is a vision of a feminist- the woman who can have it all. She is strong, and tender; intelligent, and headstrong; competent in her life's vocation, yet able to acknowledge the beauty of strength in her male counterparts (even if the ""Bloody Scots"" irritate her!).

This box set provides a great memento of 20 years of waiting for Outlander to come to film.  Every piece of it is beautiful and breathtaking. Having the Bear McCreary's soundtrack is such a bonus! I was able to get this on massive discount around Christmas, so if you can wait for a sale, do so. But if you can't wait, it's definitely worth it.",1454803200,5,1187,5.103092783505154

He is an amazing composer! The entire set is fun to look through. The small flask is adorable.. LOVE IT ALL!! Well worth the price, if just for the intros by Ron Moore and the podcasts by Moore and the writers. (I have the other collection, too. Do not resent having to buy more than one!! )  Hightly recommend that anyone who loves the Outlander book series by Diana Gabaldon purchase this set.

My only ""critique"" if you want to call it that, would be regarding the photos. While gorgeous, I personally would have preferred a more robust book w/ the cast & crew photo choices and quotes vs. the framed photos.  Other than that I love this set and would say it is an absolute must own for any fan of the series or books.",1453680000,2,486,4.21505376344086

Really captures the essence of the characters & the story from the books. So I just had to have this (little Christmas present to me!) and I do not regret. Beautifully packaged. Full of little treasures & extras from the show for instance the 2 cd soundtrack also included. I highly recommend!",1453680000,,641,4.35

The acting, directing, story, scenery, music are all incredible.  Be warned, though, it is very graphic and not for kids.  I found myself fast forwarding through several scenes because they were too brutal and intense.  The story is so good you can't stop watching, though.  It deserves all the awards it has received, and this collector's set is amazing!  The most beautiful presentation I have ever seen.

7366817,5,B013JBH0CC,"Let's face it, Starz Outlander is simply the best show on television.  I know Game of Thrones gets all the press, but that series has absolutely nothing on Outlander and pales by comparison in terms of compelling story telling.  The incredibly real and human character portrayals of Claire and Jaime by Caitriona Balfe and Sam Heughan leave you by turns enthralled, elated, emotionally drained and amazed as the story unfolds.  What's not to like?

But back to this package, as I said -- if you get Outlander you need to get this very special BluRay package of it's first season.  It is magnificent in it's presentation, packaging, internal photography displays and overflowing extras that come with it.  The deleted scenes alone will give you deeper insights into how the executive producer Ronald Moore thought through every detail of bringing these books by Diana Gabaldon to life.  If you aren't a fan of this series or think it is just OK, then maybe I'd pass in favor of a cheaper set somewhere perhaps, but to those of us who ""get"" Outlander this is to my knowledge the best it gets in terms of a Season 1 package that captures the magic appropriately.",1452038400,4,1159,4.736318407960199

7366827,5,B013JBH0CC,Great Value and a beautiful set!,1450656000,,32,4.5
7366828,2,B013JBH0CC,"With an excellent cast, historically accurate sets and props, first-rate production values throughout, and an intriguing plot, I had high expectations for Outlander that remained high throughout the first half of Season 1.  The music is quite nice and the background images of the beautiful Scottish landscapes are stunning.  Perhaps most amazing of all, they even had writers who know more than one word to convey strong emotion and who could (well, mostly) leave their personal political agendas behind.

One professional reviewer noted that Starz was hoping to create something what would make the stand apart.  After the first eight episodes, it certainly appeared that they were well on their way to accomplishing that goal.

Then it all changed.  In episodes 9 through 12, the plot slows down and drifts toward filling the time with mindless sensationalism.  By the time it gets to episodes 13 and 14, it has become just another hopeless soap opera.  Then, tragically, it finishes off the season by leaping face-fist into the cesspit of putridity that so dominates TV series being produced today.

I bought ""Outlander Season One: The Ultimate Collection (Blu-ray + UltraViolet + Limited Edition Keepsake Box and Flask)"" when it was on sale becuase I had not seen the much-advertised TV series and thought it sounded like something I would enjoy.  I do not subscribe to Starz and after this experience, I never will.

This set was priced at $54.99 when I bought it, so I paid $3.44 per episode to watch the show.  The rest of this package is, at best, worthless, so even at $54.99 the price was too high.

The boxed set is an impressively well executed but clumsy presentation of its contents.  It all comes in an elaborate cardboard box that doesn't fit with the rest of your DVD collection.  The discs are slotted into the pages of a book.  The book by itself might work on the shelf with all those other DVD's but that leaves an ugly hole in the big, pretty, and essentially worthless box.

You will need some kind of tools to extract the discs from the book without getting oil from your fingers on the reading surface.

The little flask is cute, but its only relationship with the TV show is the logotype engraved on the side.  There is one very brief and apparently contrived scene where one character hands a hip flask of a completely different design to another, but otherwise nothing like it appears on screen.  I can't tell what material the flask is made of without damaging it; it might be plastic or perhaps the same type of light steel you find in food cans.

There's also a little bundle of low-grade prints of some of the publicity stills, quite suitable for putting back into the box with the flask.  So, after adding it all up, the only thing of value here are the discs -- 4 Blu-ray discs with the 16 episodes and 2 audio discs with music from the show.  All the rest is what J. R. R. Tolkien's hobbits called a ""mathom,"" something they had no use for but didn't want to throw away.",1450483200,7,3006,4.662239089184061

7366830,5,B013JBH0CC,"What an awesome and beautiful set/collection for season 1.  I usually do not purchase per season until the show is actually over.  Prefer the ultimate collectors set with all seasons.  However, this being at $50 was well worth the price paid.  Awesome little flask, beautiful DVD book, cute little frame with photos to switch out to your liking.  Looking forward to watching the deleted scenes and outtakes; along with binge watching before season 2 (minus the last two episodes unless I have enough whiskey in me)

LOVE THIS SERIES!!",1449619200,8,534,4.943820224719101
7366831,2,B013JBH0CC,"The set is lovely, except the bonus flask is cheap, so don't get this set if that is something you are looking forward to. The lettering on mine was super crooked and I was highly disappointed. Other than that, the set is great. Don't buy this set for the full retail price - wait until it is on sale like I did ($54.99). I am not as upset as I might have been had I paid the full $165.",1449619200,6,386,3.8987341772151898

Was excited when STARZ was bringing it to the screen, and this ultimate collection was awesome!  I loved the flask and got the one!  I wanted either the Sassenach or the Je'Suis Prest and I got the Je' Suis Prest!  I'll take that...""I am ready!"".  I also loved the frame and photos to change out.  I was hoping Season 2 would have been as good a Ultimate collection, but it wasn't.  Didn't have the extra goodies.  Hopefully the other seasons are as good as Season 1.  .",1534032000,,562,4.216981132075472
