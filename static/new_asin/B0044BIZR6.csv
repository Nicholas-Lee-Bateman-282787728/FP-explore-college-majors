4260770,5,B0044BIZR6,"First off I must say that I loved this movie.  I am a big fan of Joe Dante's work and it was great seeing him back behind the camera where he belongs.  This is a great film for the family who likes to watch scary movies together.  All of the young actors did a great job in their roles.  I was so happy to see Dick Miller's cameo.  It's not a Joe Dante movie with out Mr. Miller! My only problem with this blu ray is that they have decided not to release it in it's original 3D version.  I have the blu ray from England and I have to say that the 3D is really used well in this film.  Joe Dante has a great eye for visuals and seeing it in 3D the way he intended makes them all the better.  Still, even in 2D this is a great movie and I recommend picking it up. If you can get a hold of the 3D version and have the equipment to view it it's worth looking for.",1348444800,22,859,3.7597765363128492
4260771,5,B0044BIZR6,"This movie is awesome!! I thought the acting from all the stars was top of the line.  Especially the young co-star Nathan Gamble.  He has all the makings of a future household name.  His acting in every feature film, every guest tv spot, every short film, every skit...it's so professional, crisp, and dead on.  This movie is no exception.  I honestly think Nathan's acting outshone the other actors by a bit.  Chris Masoglia was very cool as the brooding teenage brother.  He did his part to the letter as well.  And Haley Bennett gave a convincing and effective performance as well.

I'm so glad to see this movie getting a domestic release and home copy release. It's about time.

10 out of 10 all around!",1346544000,5,708,4.592
4260772,2,B0044BIZR6,The movie is only in Italian.  The actor's voice's have been replaced with Italian voice overs. This kinda ruin it for me.,1346284800,,122,4.545454545454546

When the stumble upon a door in the floor of their basement then unknowingly open a gateway to hell and become haunted by their darkest fears. Going in I honestly expected this to be a cheesy teen-ager type horror. While it was geared toward teens this movie was actually not bad at all. This is a horror movie but it's done by the same director of the ""Gremlins"" movies so it's not scary scary but it is very entertaining and fast paced. There are quite a bit of disturbing scenes and images in this but nothing that will keep you up with nightmares so that is always good. The movie was made a few years ago and just now getting released but I would compare this to ""Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark"" in terms of plot and idea. If you liked that movie you will like this one too. I enjoyed it. Overall, an entertaining and a little creepy movie that was much better then I expected. I give it a B+.",1342051200,,1242,4.200836820083682
4260774,3,B0044BIZR6,"Short Attention Span Summary:

1. A single mother and two children move into a house.
2. They have a nice looking neighbor and discover that there is a hole in their basement that seems to lead to nowhere.
3. Through a series of minor plot developments (including a visit to a Resident Nutjob) and a lot of suspense that is drug on for a LONG TIME, we find out that this hole is some type of Ancient Evil that feeds on the fear of the people who look into it.
4. Each character is forced in the movie to face his or her fear as the price of putting the demons to rest. (So, one character is afraid of clowns and must face his fear. Another is afraid of his absent father. And still a third has a bad childhood memory that has to be faced down.)
5. Of course, three of the four main characters face their fears, and the hole closes. But then the 4th character states here fear and in Predictable Fashion, we get a hint that it is going to happen again. (I can't imagine anyone funding a sequel to this.)

It was clear that this was a low budget film, but it was tastefully done. They also succeeded in making the special effects look pretty decent and not so cheesy. I guess it's a testament to the improvements that have allowed believable special effects to be made for a low price. There was also very little blood and gore, and there was thought to the plot. For this, I give the film an extra star.

Blockbuster is going into bankruptcy, but if it were still open I would not get this film off the hot releases shelf.",1289606400,8,1521,4.2020547945205475

4260781,4,B0044BIZR6,"A good old-fashioned supernatural thriller from genre master Joe Dante, along the lines of ""Poltergeist"" or ""The Gate."" It's creepy enough for general audiences but not too extreme for kids. Performances are solid: Bennett is particularly appealing, there's a a memorable guest appearance by Bruce Dern, and since it's a Dante movie yes Dick Miller shows up. Shot in 3D, the stereo choices are effective with a strong sense of depth and a restrained use of 'pop-out' moments.

4260798,4,B0044BIZR6,"The Hole, of course, is a ""horror"" flick and this is a very good copy (being Blu-ray).  Still, the main characters are young teens and the film was thus probably intended for young teens.  So although it does contain some disturbing imagery, it doesn't contain graphic violence or gore - and in my opinion is the better for it.

Whatever is in the hole not only knows the greatest fear of anyone looking into it, but it is able to disgorge an embodiment of that fear.  What I like about the film is that it then asks the question: so what happens if you can overcome your greatest fear?  And what if you can't?",1458777600,,610,4.315789473684211
4260799,4,B0044BIZR6,"Kids get a bad rap in films. It is assumed because of their age and lack of experience, that they are less talented than adult actors. While in many cases this is true, it is not the rule. Some people I spoke to, immediately had no interest in The Hole, because of it's young cast. Right away they were saying this is going to be a rip off of Goosebumps and didn't even give it a chance. The film may not have been the scariest film I've ever seen, but it had a great backstory, a lot of suspense, and some very talented young actors. Those kids play Dane and Lucas, who are forced to move from the city to the country, to hide from an abusive father. The boys are miserable and decide to explore the old house the family has rented. What they find is a giant hole in the basement, with seemingly no bottom. As they continue to be fascinated by the hole, things in this small town, and especially in this old house just continue to get stranger and stranger, leading to a tremendous ending that will teach the boys, that sometimes the only thing you can do is face your fears. The star of this film is Nathan Gamble, who has done a lot for someone so young. I've seen him in a bunch of things and weather he's playing Commissioner Gordon's son in The Dark Knight, or the young activist in Dolphin's Tale, Gamble just has this way of always pulling at the audiences heart strings. Once again he's this cute, innocent kid, who's been traumatized by years of abuse, yet he still manages to face his fears, unleashed by the hole. I've seen plenty of films where kids in this situation just run away and hide, but that's not his style, and that's part of why this movie isn't a Goosebumps story. The bottom line, I think The Hole will appeal to Science Fiction fans more than Horror fans, despite the fact that it's labelled as Horror. The young cast is refreshingly energetic, curious, and eager, all things that will become contagious, and make the Hole, a much better film than you think it's going to be.",1455753600,2,2003,4.358288770053476

Character development was perfect and the hole was mysterious enough to draw conclusions, but the movie plummeted downhill and became absolutely laughable.

I'm assuming the hole is a metaphor for one's fears? If anyone has a fear and gazes into the hole, the hole opens and begins on the attack once again? The clown doll which attacks the child is essentially a generic Chucky. The father and the son's ""fight"" (if it can be called that) was absolutely cringeworthy.

Such a good movie for the first forty-five, especially with the beautiful Haley Bennet, but I've never seen a movie literally fall off such a high peak so fast.",1419984000,,790,4.717391304347826

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Welcome back, Joe Dante, you've been away far too long. Why did Hollywood turn its back on this guy? Joe Dante's made some of the funniest horror genre films ever, like the original Piranha, The Howling, Gremlins, Innerspace, Matinee and Small Soldiers. But for much of the past decade, Joe Dante has been making TV projects. Why? The big screen is his natural home, as the terrific The Hole proves this once and for all. It is Joe Dantes best feature since 1998 Small Soldiers and his first since 2003 Looney Tunes: Back In Action, is a teen exploit scary enough to thrill adult genre fans, but still safe enough for hardy young ones and a perfect My First Horror to inspire a new generation. Despite the 12A rating here in the UK, The Hole in 3D is a horror thats done its homework, paying dues to a host of classics such as Ringu, Childs Play, Poltergeist, Gremlins, 'Puppet Master' and The Gate.

Just like Steven Spielberg and Stephen King, Joe Dante likes to set his horrors in suburbia. Dane Thompson [Chris Massoglia] and his young brother Lucas [Nathan Gamble] have just moved from Brooklyn into a new home, in a small town, with their mother Susan [Teri Polo]. The boys befriend neighbour Julie and soon come across a boarded-up, seemingly bottomless pit in their basement. Once open, all sorts of horrors are unleashed a dead girl, a killer clown ... horrors from the pit of the kids' greatest fears, so to speak.

With The Hole, Joe Dante has created a fun family adventure that's also a terrifying experience for adults; like an unholy cross between Honey, I Shrunk The Kids and Poltergeist, all mixed together in some huge dark void. The Hole in 3D feeds on Dane, Julie and Lucas' deepest fears, releasing horrible panda-eyed little shoeless girls and a rather disturbing jester puppet. I believe the medical term for a fear of clowns is Coulrophobia [Fear of Clowns], and if you're a sufferer, this really isn't the film for you.

After drawing on the regular Joe Dante staples of teen romance and disturbing family trauma, the films big finale, which brings to mind Dante's segment from the Twilight Zone film, does fail to deliver on the initial set-up. The Hole in 3D may often work as a straight horror film, but it is aimed at kids so it was never going to be too traumatic. However, with its creepy realisation of basic horrors and disturbing visions, The Hole in 3D will succeed in scaring the bejeezus out of all ages, young and old, and may just prove equally as effective to those of a really nervous disposition.

The concept of fears manifesting themselves from a seemingly endless and unexplained hole in their basement is worked nicely and kept me engaged for most of the film and when it reaches its dark and chilling climax, as Dane enters the Hole to face his greatest fear, the film excels with a very strong ending that has really excellent and amazing use of the 3D. It left me totally satisfied with Dantes return to the big screen.

Another positive about The Hole in 3D is the cast, they are all entirely likable. Not once did I feel annoyed by the young actors or think they were too childish or overplaying it, which is a real credit to how Joe Dante directs his youthful performers and something that normally lets down these family horror films when child actors are too annoying to give a damn and especially Chris Massoglia played the older brother Dane Thompson well and charms the hell out of the film and the young Nathan Gamble is proving to be a fine actor with another really strong performance that follows on from great parts in The Dark Knight and another excellent horror film The Mist. Haley Bennett added the feminine touch to the group and was the love interest as well as a main focal point for the story line with her own demons being revealed in the films most scary scenes, altogether they had good banter and chemistry which really assists to the films enjoy ability.

There are a few problems with the film, namely a pacing issue in the middle part and with what felt like rushed plot conclusions with some of the characters story arcs or plot points that could have benefited with more explanation and closure. An example is with the original owner of the house, a slightly neurotic man who the kids hunt down to try get some answers about the hole and hes used minimally and ineffectively, which is a shame as it hinted at an interesting storyline. Also the film seemed to suffer under a tight budget, made tighter presumably by the use of 3D, and it feels rushed in places and some scenes felt incomplete but all credit must go to Joe Dante and his experience with small funds and delivering results regardless that he has made it work. There are wonderful perspective shots from within the hole looking up as our young stars attempt to see whats in the holes depths by lowing things down and there are many moments of subtle depth which did not seem extraneous, which is just what I want from my 3D films. All in all a wholly satisfying family adventure with plenty of scares along the way.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The Hole in 3D looks absolutely terrific on Blu-ray. Especially with a good 1080p encoded image and of course the 3D is totally awesome and at times will have you jumping out of your seat with sheer terror. The 1.85:1 presentation is clean and vivid and overall is brilliant. Being purposely shot 3D feature film, there is plenty of brilliant realistic elements, with careful framing in mind to make the best use of the extra depth associated with the format. Even the simplest shots, such as when the family are first moving in, with boxes and crates holding the extreme foreground and successive layers moving back into the frame giving a real sense of 3D space. The rest of the picture fairs just as well-being clean, bright and detailed. Skin and clothing weaves are suitably well defined as is the wood grain and strained steel of the hatch the seals the Hole, look too at the various objects that make up the basement, paint cans, shelving, even the dust, which are all pin sharp. Colours are bright and bold when we first meet the family without wash or bleed, but do thin later in the film as the darkness of the film takes over, this is intentional and not a print defect. Brightness and contrast are set to give some terrific blacks, with the usual 3D caveat, which are at their best when looking into, or out of, the Hole which is completely impenetrable. Look too at the darkness spread in the basement, or the girls toilet when Julie is menaced for some terrific shadow detailing in the deep inkiness. Please Note: If people in North America wants to purchase this 3D Blu-ray, you will have to purchase a Multi-region Blu-ray Player, as it is ONLY available in the Region B/2 format.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio mix showcases some truly cool sound design, exploring the entire field for some potent directional effects. Well, just as the picture is absorbing and engaging, so too is the sound, which makes full use of the surround field to place some truly eerie effects. This is especially true when Lukas is first menaced by the clown puppet; its footsteps, bell-ringing and chitter-chatter are utilised by all the speakers moving around the room at such pace that you find yourself turning your head to see if that was part of the film or some demon in your own room. This is just one of many scenes that make use of the same eerie effects that really creep up on you. Dialogue is given frontal priority, though there is some directionality when called for, it also sounds very natural and distinct never once straining to be heard. The score is given decent stereo surround making use of all 5.1speakers to really place you in the centre of the room. Bass, itself, while strong in grounding everything in reality, is slightly lacking in the LF effects department, though when it does rear its head there are some very satisfying thumps; Im thinking of the trap door over the Hole. On the whole this is a terrific sound track with plenty of effects to keep you guessing.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Features: Gateway to Hell: The Making of The Hole [2010] [1080i] [11:39] A superficial and standard short feature that includes interviews with actors Teri Polo; Chris Massoglio; Nathan Gamble and Haley Bennett; director Joe Dante, producer David Lancaster, screenwriter Mark L. Smith and, briefly, Cinematographer Theo van de Sande and effects expert Robert Skotak. This special short feature is nothing but a blatant advert for the film, filled as it is with back slapping sound-bites and copious amounts of film clips it is just awful.

Special Feature: Interview with Cast and Crew [2010] [1080i] Here we have two topical shorts supply clips, cast/crew comments, and some behind-the-scenes footage. ""The Keeper of The Hole"" [3:21] Takes a looks at Bruce Dern's role as Creepy Carl. ""Family Matters"" [4:29] considers the relationships within the Thompson family and with their neighbour. There is very little here, though, as its still tailored towards press interview material in promoting the film, only this time is looks raw and there is no interviewer, just the answered questions, sometimes the answers are professional, but most of the time its just pap.

Special Feature: Behind the The Hole Scenes [2010] [1080i] [11:39] A superficial and standard feature that includes interviews with actors Teri Polo, Chris Massoglio, Nathan Gamble and Haley Bennett; director Dante, producer Lancaster, writer Smith and, briefly, Cinematographer Theo van de Sande and effects expert Robert Skotak. This is basic camcorder footage of the cast and crew as they set up, rehearse, alleviate boredom and shoot the film? Sounds worthwhile, but is actually gets very tedious very quickly, much like it is being on a real film set, so on that level it works!

Finally, overall The Hole in 3D is a very fine and enjoyable film but there isn't much for the horror fan with its lack of gore or big frights but it does offer an original idea and a fun story that entertains. Joe Dante definitely knows how to make a family film that scares and excites and although it maybe a little too scary for really young kids its not going to leave you with nightmares unless your freaked out by evil little clowns. Joe Dante has no difficulty recreating the appealing feel of his best-known works, with The Hole being another one of his signature unnerving yet fun family films. It is a shame that this fine effort is now reduced to anonymity in the States. It is well worth your time if you are in the mood for fun house-type horror resembling that of the 1980s, the kind that kids can watch without being traumatized but is also smart and fun enough to keep adults entertained. As a 3D Blu-ray disc from Entertainment One, they have put together a very simple package, the picture and sound are reference all the way, but it is let down by a rather naff extras package. But with the continuing lack of native 3D content on Blu-ray, this disc is still worth checking out. Highly Recommended!

4260817,4,B0044BIZR6,"""The Hole"" is a psychic horror movie where the dark trap door in the basement of the house peers back into your soul when you peer into it and it sees and plays on your deepest fears.  Given that the people who peer into it are all teenagers/ kids (brothers Dane & Lucas and attractive neighbor Julie whom Dane crushes on) the hole comes to know their fears and bring them to life.  What unravels is a psychological thriller of sorts, complete with a creepy clown, a stilted dead girl walking in haunting fashion, and the monstrous abusive father all of whom end up confronting our protagonist kids.  It's a wonder that they survive but survive they do.

A lot of people have said that this is a ""family friendly horror movie"" and that may be true if your kids are especially jaded and cold toward creepy things but I'd say that this is for the twelve and up crowd.  It'll be too scary for the younger ones.  I showed it to a group of teenage boys and there were plenty of times that they jumped.  While the film falls in the vein of screen fare like Gremlins and Beetlejuice it's much scarier so parent beware.  3.5 stars.",1388880000,,1123,4.365384615384615

So if you want a real 3d film , one that was shot in that format and are not looking for a  gory r rated horror film then this pg rated one will do just fine.

4260820,4,B0044BIZR6,"THE HOLE

I am sure we all remember the good old days of horror films where kid friendly ones were also very adult oriented as well. Of course I am talking about things like Gremlins and films as such. Well the man that directed that classic film Joe Dante brings us this movie that goes back to that time. The Hole is a fun attempt at bringing back that style of film.

The Thompson family has just moved into a new house in a new town and is looking to settle down. Dane, his younger brother Lucas and their mother Susan think everything is going well especially Dane once he meets the girl next door. She tends to come over every day to hang out with him and his brother and one day they stumble into the basement. Once there they make it down there they find a trapdoor that is all locked up. Naturally the curiosity is too much and they open it up, strange things start to happen then. A little girl starts to appear and after they see her crawl into the hole things get much worse.

Dante had brought us a really fun throwback that I think any fan of those types of films and era will enjoy. Written by Mark Smith who wrote Vacancy 1 & 2 came up with a great story that would have been right at home on Goosebumps or any of those anthology shows. The actors are all great here and are believable so that is always a plus. Now this is not a classic and does not live up to earlier efforts but it is still a good film and worth a watch.",1384992000,,1440,4.081272084805653
4260821,4,B0044BIZR6,"(possible spoiler ahead)
The film was not necessarily believable, but I thought it made a great science fiction/ horror film. It even had a place where it looked like nothing could go back to normal, again. But they found a way to make all of the main characters happy and home, again.",1381104000,,285,4.5
4260822,4,B0044BIZR6,"The Hole is obviously aimed at the tween/teen audience but still delivers some creepy moments for adults.  Good production values, decent acting, interesting plot ('hey, what's with this weird trapdoor in the basement?') and good supporting cast (Teri Polo, Bruce Dern) turn The Hole into a likeable movie.  The special effects mostly take the less-is-more approach and it works well, relying on the viewers imagination to fuel the creep-factor.  The plot borrows elements from other movies (The Gate, Poltergeist) but combines them in an effective manner and makes them its own.  Nothing groundbreaking here, but nothing terrible, either.

Expectation is key when watching this movie (or any movie, really).  The Hole is NOT an R-rated horror/gore fest.  It is NOT in the same league as The Ring.  Many of the negative reviews here seem to have missed that cue when watching.  The Hole is a solid, creepy movie that you can watch with your young-teen kids while eating a pizza.  For what it is, it's good.

4260827,2,B0044BIZR6,"Every once in awhile you come across a movie you never heard if and you think ""Why not?"".  Sometimes you can find a real gem this way.  The Hole, however, is not.

Brothers Dane and Lucus and their mother recently move into a new town.  While exploring their new home, they find a gaping hole under a rug that has been padlocked shut.  Of course they decide to open it and all hell breaks loose.  Strange things begin to happen and it's only until they face their greatest fear can they triumph.

While its nice to see Joe Dante (Gremlins, The Howling) back in action, this movie is proof that, like all the great directors of yesteryear, he's ran out of the magic he once had.  The movie itself feels like it was made for one of ABC Family's 13 Days of Halloween block lineup.  It tries to capture the nostalgia of past 80s classics as Gremlins and The Gate but fails miserably.  The main cast is small with the only Halley Bennett (The Haunting of Molly Hartley, College) playing the hot girl next door Julie as the only face I recognized.  The two actors playing Dane and Lucus are decent enough but I wouldn't recommend them to any one.  Teri Polo (Meet the Parents, ""I'm With Her"") and Bruce Dern (Blue Velvet, The Glass House) turn in sleepy performance with Polo appearing to be really regretting signing on to this mess.  The cheap CGI-effects are obvious from the get-go as well as the pancake made up ghost of a little girl from Julie's past.  This little girl is just awful and should've been cut out of the movie all together.  Avoid it only unless you're babysitting your pesky little brother and know that he's scared of clown dolls.  The rating says PG-13 but I can't, for the life of me, see the reason behind it.  It barely qualifies for a PG.",1368489600,,1760,4.416149068322981
4260828,3,B0044BIZR6,"The Hole (Joe Dante, 2009)

If you're going to make an homage to the young-adult horror films of the eighties, who better to do it than one of the original directors? Joe Dante, whose resume in the horror world was built first on cheap exploitation flicks (Piranha) and then on blockbuster teen horror (Gremlins), returns to the world he helped build, and a welcome return it is indeed. The Hole could easily have been made in 1989 rather than 2009, and I say this with a great deal of affection. This is a fun, fun movie, though perhaps Dante cleaved a little too closely to the formula (more on this later).

Plot: A city-bred family--mom (Beyond Borders' Teri Polo) and her two sons, older Dane (The Vampire's Assistant's Chris Massoglia) and younger Lucas (The Dark Knight's Nathan Gamble)--move to a little piece of suburbia. While the kids are messing around in the basement, they discover a many-padlocked trapdoor, and when they open it (as, of course, they must), they discover that there seems to be a bottomless pit in their house. With the assistance of their next-door neighbor, beautiful Julie (The Haunting of Molly Hartley's Haley Bennett), they track down the house's former owner, known only as Creepy Carl (Tattoo's Brice Dern), and find out that the hole is a portal to a dimension that forces people to face their deepest fears. While Dane professes to not be scared of anything, both Lucas and Julie soon find themselves haunted...

Everything I love about this movie I summed up in the first paragraph--it feels like those safe, easy teen ""horror"" movies my entire generation grew up on. We loved Gremlins just as much as we loved Phantasm (or, for that matter, Piranha), and that was okay; the world of PG horror films in the eighties was vastly different than it is today, when a PG-13 rating on a horror film dooms it to mediocrity before it's even released. Hell, this is the first PG-13 horror film in the last twenty years I remember actually liking.

SPOILER ALERT: the following paragraph can be construed to contain a major spoiler. If you haven't seen the movie and are intending to, stop reading now.

The one thing about those YA-horror blockbusters that did always grate on me, though, was that very safety. You knew going in that everything was going to be okay; they were the celluloid equivalent of romance novels. The heroine was always going to wind up with the guy who was best for her by the last page of the novel, and they would live happily ever after. And, well, if you want to consider it a spoiler alert you can: Dante went right along with the formula. Didn't deviate from it one iota. You would think that would kick the nostalgia bells into high gear, but given the movie's lukewarm reception (as I write this, its IMDB rating is 5.8, audience rating is 48% on RT, though critical reception was much better [78%]), that doesn't seem to be the case. It would have been great to see Dante suddenly turn on his heel and break new ground like he did in the early eighties... unfortunately, though, no dice, and in my estimation, the movie suffers for it--and I don't seem to be alone in that. Still, I did find it an enjoyable experience. As with a few other movies I've seen recently, you may need to be of a certain age to get the most out of this flick, but it's a fun ride if you grew up on Joe Dante movies in the eighties. ***",1364428800,,3380,4.570957095709571

I was expecting the older boy to act more maturely in trying to get his girl, but he didn't seem to care.  So that was unexpected.  A good treatise on overcoming our fears, however.  It is almost packaged as a horror flick, but SPOILER ALERT:  when my wife saw the clown attacking the younger boy, instead of being frightened, as she usually is with horror, she burst out laughing and could not stop.

You've heard of diet Pepsi?Well this is diet horror. A pretty lame and failed attempt at creating a scary movie. It had a low budget,but budgets have never meant bad because they are low. It is always the creative team behind its making that is responsible for the end product,and if it works it works,if it doesn't,then you get something like this.
Two brothers and their mother move into a new neighbourhood. The older brother catches a look at the girl next door and the two will eventually get cozy. In the meantime however while rummaging through the basement they discover a wooden door on the floor,secured with six different locks. Their curiosity gets the best of them and they find an old paint can containing the keys for each lock. They open it and inky blackness stares back at them. They throw down various objects but none seem to reach bottom. They soon return upstairs and continue their lives. However something(s)have been released. The first is a clown doll that suddenly appears on the bed of the little brother and disappears.
As the older one gets to know the girl next door better,they invite her down and she witnesses the hole for herself. In a restaurant washroom the next day the lights suddenly go out and a young girl with one shoe saunters towards her from a stall. Then the lights come on and some friends walk in. The little girl having of course disappeared. The next day the little girl comes into the brothers house while all three are there. They ultimately watch as she returns to the hole and disappears into its blackness.
The group decide to go visit the previous owner of the house Creepy Carl. He resides in an old abandoned theme park. He lives in one of the buildings underground fixing lights. When he learns of them opening the door he freaks. He shouts of death and destruction and they of course high tail it out. Things start getting more intense as the clown doll actually attacks the younger brother. Then a policeman comes by looking for one of two girls in a picture he hands the younger brother. The little girl he seeks is the girl who has been following the older brothers g/f. When he turns around the back of his head is exposing his brain. He too wanders down stairs and disappears into the hole.
The older brother somewhere along the line decides each of these manifestations so far has to do with one's fears coming to life. His younger brothers fear of clowns,his g/f's young girl apparition,it turns out,is an old friend that got killed on a roller coaster ride that was stuck. The g/f was too scared to help and the young girl fell to her death. The older brother says he fears nothing but along comes an apparition of his father who served time in prison. He takes the younger brother down the hole and the older one goes after the both of them. Holding onto a rope he lands into a surreal landscape. He spies his brother and both end up hiding in what would have been the same closet he used to hide in when his father went on tears in his childhood. He finally stands up to his father,saves his little brother and returns to the basement.
The film ends as their mother comes downstairs and asks what it is they're doing. All three finally reveal the hole to her. She lifts up the lid and all there is now are exposed pipes. The curse is lifted.
I found lead Massoglia's acting,left a LOT to be desired. He should have been stronger;better emoting and vocalization. He is still young,so he has lots of time to hone his acting chops as the years go by. The rest of the cast I had no problems with. It was nice to see screen vet Dern as Crazy Carl.
We had seen the clown doll move by suggestion. That is you would see the clown on the bed one moment,and the next it would be gone. But when the clown actually started to talk and move in front of our eyes,well I'm sorry it just wasn't believable enough. Chucky this thing wasn't,and HE was believable. The directing here was pedestrian and the script lame stuff we've seen a hundred times over and done better elsewhere. More than 3/4 the way through this movie,the older brother finally decides that it is their fears coming to life. I just cannot figure out what the catalyst was for him finally deciding,after all that had gone on previous,at that moment,that this was the answer.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include stills and three featurettes.
All in all a disappointing and lame attempt at a horror movie. Its low budget shows,unfortunately. They seemingly spent most of their dough on getting Bruce Dern on board,and had little left over for anything else.",1360281600,,4841,4.604166666666667
4260833,3,B0044BIZR6,"I grabbed this film to watch because of Joe Dante's past directions (which I've enjoyed his ""Gremlins,"" ""Explorers,""  ""Innerspace,"" and ""The 'Burbs""). I used to watch most of the horror movies in the 80s and ""The Hole"" is very clich and an old-school scare for today's standard.

""The Hole"" is a story about a single mother with her two sons moving into a new house, and the older son meets a next-door girl. All three have discovered a closed hole in the basement to which they have navely opened. Nothing was seen and a ""bottomless"" pit is all that they could discover. Then, soon and slowly, things started to happen to each of the trio.

From a psychological perspective, I thought this film is pretty good with an idea of opening a ""hole"" (or a door), one must face their worst fears and victories would be achieved when their fears are defeated. If not, death would ensure their fate.

Personally, it's a pretty good story yet clich. I would think that Teri Polo would have a better developed role than a nave mother.",1360022400,4,1023,4.573770491803279

Gremlins kicks the hole's butt any day.
It's OK if you have twelve year olds to entertain but they might even complain about the watered down ""horror"" movie they are watching.
Maybe this was meant for six year olds instead.

There's no gore and very little in the way of violence (unless you want to include the abominable way in which the older brother treats his younger sibling).  For the most part, this is more about the things that go bump in the night: scary sounds, sinister shadows, your darkest secrets revealed.  As the filmmakers state in the bonus feature, this is a ""traditional scary movie.""  Translation, it could easily play on TV with little to no editing.  Think of it as a long episode from The Outer Limits.  The plot is a well-worn stock scenario: your worst fears realized.  It's pretty basic fare with only a few surprises (Dick Miller's silent walk-on being one of the few).  But it is slickly done, with one fabulous set piece and a few effective moments.

The Hole is extremely derivative of 80's horror films like The Gate and Dreamscape, with a little of Dante's own phenomenally overrated Gremlins thrown in for good measure. It is utterly unoriginal in both story and execution. Movies do not have to be original insofar as plot - the very concept of ""genre"" underscores this fact. But formulaic or derivative movies are especially beholden to execute their predictable plots and two-dimensional characters with some kind of flourish, and The Hole fails on this account.

There are plenty of scares in this film that do not rely on ridiculous gore or extremely loud music, at least not at all times. If you grew up watching the old-school horror films, you'll feel right at home. There is even a killer clown doll that was actually very creepy. The story has a lot of foreshadowing, so you'll probably be able to predict the ending; that's not too bad since the ending was fulfilling and engaging. The acting was decent throughout the film, but there are a couple of lines of dialogue and conversations that felt forced/unnatural. Also, the special effects and make-up were great most of the time, but it does suffer from poor effects occasionally. The music complimented the tone of the film, and the cinematography matched the film's vibe.

Overall, I really enjoyed The Hole. It's a great horror film that packs plenty of suspense and some decent jump-scares; it's also a horror film that the whole family can watch since the violence and disturbing imagery is limited. The type of film I would've loved as a child, and still love today. As of 12/1/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, and I recommend renting/streaming or purchasing if you're a fan of the genre.

The Hole has some violence and blood, no sex or nudity.",1354320000,,1872,4.825545171339564

4260849,5,B0044BIZR6,"It's like a much improved upon 80's/90's thriller. I was surprised its rated PG-13 since it is a lot scarier then today's r rated thriller/horrors. Instead of focusing on random nude scenes that distract from how terrible the movie is, like most of today's horror films, they decided to focus on the actual story. I really enjoyed it.",1353801600,8,334,4.775862068965517
4260850,5,B0044BIZR6,Finishing up watching this movie on Netflix right now. I love it. It's got alot of creepiness to it! I was actually surprised. I wasn't even going to watch this and decided to take a chanced and am very glad I did! It's on my wish list to buy now! I'm so glad they are making more movies like this lately because I'm so over the gory slasher junk films! I have found several through Netflix lately and have bought them for great prices on Amazon. Well some are still at high prices because they are new. Either way I recommend this movie to anyone that likes a good scare!,1353801600,,572,4.209090909090909

Very creepy, kinda humorous at times, ok story, predictable and all in all a good movie. As for those complaining about their dvds I rented the movie and it was fine and in English, its not the movie, some how your getting foreign versions of the film on dvd. I would suggest this movie to anyone.",1353024000,,458,4.1
4260853,3,B0044BIZR6,"The movie The Hole reminded me of The Gate from 1987.  Of the two, I thought The Gate was a little more interesting.  The special effects in The Hole were good, but the movie just did not hold any interest for me and I felt like I had wasted my time.  It was just more of the same.  Sometimes you can make a rehash that's good because the actors in it, make the movie.  This movie didn't have that either -- it was just flat to me.",1352419200,,431,3.9080459770114944
4260854,5,B0044BIZR6,"Now this was a very unpredictable scary movie. It wasn't like the other scary movies I have seen, once you start watching it it already reminds you of another scary movie you have seen. This was good and will make you jump.",1352073600,,223,4.333333333333333
4260855,5,B0044BIZR6,"Joe Dante has always had a touch with horror, making it funny as well as scary, and he has always had a way with young people in his movies as well, treating them as adults instead of idiots.  Both of the director's skills are on ample display in a horror movie that is aimed at the 8 to 16 year old set.  The movie itself remains intelligent and even challenging while being age appropriate.  That, my friends, is a rarity today.

'The Hole' is as much about a dysfunctional family struggling through hard times and facing new challenges as it is about horror.  Gore hounds will be disappointed with the plot, but there is plenty of creepiness, suspense, and shocks to satisfy all but the most jaded.  Special notice must be given to Bruce Dern's cameo in the movie, which absolutely warmed my heart.

So if you are in the market for a decent scary movie that isn't rated R, 'The Hole' is perfect.  The acting, especially by the three young leads, is excellent, and the plot builds up a credible threatening situation with an extremely satisfying conclusion that may actually teach a lesson.  Talk about a throwback to a different era!",1351468800,12,1136,4.584158415841584
4260856,4,B0044BIZR6,"This movie was very good.  The sound was clear and the picture was good.  This movie is scary but not super scary, plus there was no gore.  This means the younger kids can watch it also.  It was good entertainment and a fun movie to watch.  I would recommend this movie for those who want to watch a scary movie that have kids and those who don't.  I give this movie a B.",1350864000,3,371,4.013698630136986
4260857,3,B0044BIZR6,"I have been wanting to see this movie for the longest time. It's a shame that it sat on the shelf for as long as it did before finally getting a release. Hopefully, we will never have to wait too long for Joe Dante to give us another film.

""The Hole"" is about a family who move into a new house in a nice suburban neighborhood. Single mother and two sons. As the kids adjust to their new surroundings, and oldest brother Dane keeps his eye on the cute girl next door, they discover a weird hole that seemingly goes nowhere in their basement. As soon as they open it, weird things begin to happen. The hole reads them and soon these three's deepest fears begin to come to life and they must figure out a way to stop it once and for all.

It's been way too long since Joe Dante has blessed us with a movie. While ""The Hole"" may not win any major awards, it is a thoroughly entertaining and interesting film that finds Dante in familiar territory. In the 80s, Dante and other filmmakers were terrific at bringing scares and spooks to family friendly kid entertainment that everyone of all ages could enjoy. That's what we get here. ""The Hole"" is old school scares wrapped up in a new movie. It may not be crazily original, but it works, and with Dante's knowing eye behind the camera, you can't take your eyes off it. It's mostly a light affair, but it does have some striking images and scenes peppered thoughtout, but it does take somewhat of a dark turn towards the end when Dane's fear is realized. The cast is adequate, if nothing spectacular. Dante regulars Dick Miller (in a no dialogue cameo) and Bruce Dern also appear. What, no Robert Picardo? Teri Polo, as the mother, is mostly wasted in the typical working mom role who doesn't know what's going on.

""The Hole"" may seem like a longer, bigger budgeted episode of The Hub network's ""The Haunting Hour"", but there is enough here to warrant a watch for anybody. I grew up on the stuff Dante and others made in the 80s, so this was maybe more to me than it will be for others, because it's a kind of movie that they used to make that, sadly, don't make too much of anymore. No, ""The Hole"" isn't anything fantastic, but it's an easily watchable, entertaining movie from a talented guy who's made a number of fun movies (""Gremlins"", ""The Burbs"", ""The Howling"", ""Innerspace"", ""Piranha"", and the criminally underrated ""Matinee""). It's a decent movie to show to the little ones for a light scare, but the parents may find it watchable themselves if they grew up at the time Dante and others were kings.",1350172800,6,2554,4.44136460554371
4260858,4,B0044BIZR6,"Joe Dante (""Gremlins,"" ""Matinee,"" ""Howling,"" ""The Burbs,"" ""Piranha,"" ""Small Soldiers,"" ""Twilight Zone The Movie"") demonstrates  why he was handpicked by Steven  Spielberg to direct ""It's a Good Life,"" one of the segments in ""Twilight Zone the Movie"" with this little known gem.  The premise isn't too complicated:  Two brothers and their single mother move into a house with a mysterious hole located in the basement.  As the two brothers befriend the girl next door, the trio soon begin to find themselves confronted by supernatural events related to the presence of the hole.

What transpires is a simple tale with large mythical overtones that help make it  accessible to a diverse audience.  The horror ""scenarios"" aren't incredibly novel or original per se; but Dante still manages to make them chilling and unique in a way many contemporary horror films haven't.  In fact, there is a very compelling reason WHY they seem to have been derived from other horror movies -- but to explain that reason would be to divulge a major reveal of the story.  Let's just say that Dante is one who, in his philosophy of storytelling in general, and horror movies in particular, has espoused the belief that stories are receptacles of universal emotions; and that horror films in particular are most successful when they capitalize on universal fears.  The fact that he can incorporate iconic, recognizable elements from other films and still make them fresh and compelling is a testament to how deft he is at handling this material.

The third act is a visual treat that harkens back to his work on ""It's a Good Life.""  I recommend seeing this movie for the last act alone!

While not his best movie, ""The Hole"" is an unexpected gift from a sorely missed talent.  Hopefully this movie is meant to signify Joe Dante's return.",1349913600,,1816,4.908196721311476
4260859,3,B0044BIZR6,"THE HOLE is one of those ""kid-friendly"" horror films that's light on gore and other R-rated entrapments.  Helmed by Joe Dante (GREMLINS), the story focuses on two brothers who discover a strange ominous hole in the basement of their new house.  We soon learn there are nasty beings dwelling in the hole...can't tell you more to avoid spoilers.
The movie looks like it was a 3-D flick, but my copy isn't officially 3-D.
The acting is average, with Chris Massoglia and Nathan Gamble as the brothers, Hayley Bennett, cute neighbor....Bruce Dern is the town looney and Teri Polo once again plays the harried single mom.
