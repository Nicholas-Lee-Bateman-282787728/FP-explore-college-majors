5401486,5,B00A92MG2E,"I loved this movie! It reminded me of my adolescence and how there was light at the end of the tunnel that's hard to see when you're going through it. It's good to look back to reconnect what current generations are going through today and realize we're not so different. The music was great too, very fitting.",1359590400,3,310,4.456140350877193
5401487,4,B00A92MG2E,"Sweetness (Zo Kravitz) is a 17 year old girl growing up in the melting pot of Brooklyn, N.Y. (Filming Location). She is bullied. She is friendless at school. She looks up to her sister (Antonique Smith) who is pregnant and leaving, only to return months later with a baby and a bruised face. Dad is apparently a cab driver who has alcohol issues and is abusive when he drinks. Oh, not call DSS abusive, just an A-hole who breaks things, swears and shoves. Mom (Yolonda Ross) isn't mentally right. Her name is Rainy short for Lorene, which symbolizes her tears of sadness.

Sweetness feels trapped. Her escape is to become part of the drug dealing scene. She wants to deal just enough so she can get by, ""right now."" And as her sympathetic somewhat caring drug supplier warns her, ""Right now keeps on changing.""

The story is about hitting bottom, and recovery without having an epiphany or seeking special outside help. This is a well acted drama, although slow at times.
It is less about plot and more about character. A more believable inner city film then what we have been subject to here of late.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, brief sex. No nudity.",1357948800,2,1148,4.645320197044335

5401489,5,B00A92MG2E,"This beautiful debut by Victoria Mahoney captures you from the start. Sweetness (played by Zoe Kravitz) is a biracial child living in a harsh urban environment where ""mean"" girls often result to bullying for dominance and attention. Mahoney's artistic choices and direction in the film are stunning, as she reveals that the underlying need in each of her character's lives -- including the transformation of the alcoholic father who comes 360 at the end and learns to embrace his daughter before she follows in his footsteps as well as the ""mentally ill"" mother played beautifully by Yolanda Ross -- is love. Compelling performances and deeply engaging. Not to be missed! A beautiful coming of age narrative about a young teenager coming to terms with her heritage, culture, self, home, environment, and community.",1355875200,17,814,5.174242424242424
5401490,4,B00A92MG2E,"I don't know why Gabby is on the cover because she not even a main character to this film. Anyway, I like this film Zoe. Antoinette, the father, and the mother did a good job acting. Actually, everyone did a good job which is rare in a film. It was hard seeing this good girl go bad and go bad hard.  It sad she wasn't born in a more stable environment but a lot of kids go through a life like this daily. The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because of the ending. It just ending with no resolution .",1409443200,,513,3.9326923076923075

5401499,4,B00A92MG2E,"I did not like the cussing, but Zoe was a good actress. She played her role as if she was really living it. It's a shame that we sometimes feel that we have to compromise with the ways of the world,in order to have friends or to be accepted, or for us to feel happy. Even though the ending was a good turn around, look at the damage that we cause to ourselves and to one another while we try to find ourselves, or as we are running away from whatever. Hurting people hurt people! Shame!",1384819200,2,486,4.072916666666667

5401501,4,B00A92MG2E,"I had heard great things about this film for a while and because I like to support independent films with characters of color, I purchased it.

The acting was great.  Zoe Kravitz was authentic and restrained.  In fact, everyone was great.  Gabourey Sidibe was just okay.

The direction, the look, the music, everything that makes a good movie great was here.... but....

I still didn't ""like"" it.  Rather than spoil it, I will say that I felt the writing caused some disconnect between me and the characters.  Some decisions are made that I couldn't sympathize with because I didn't understand the motivation.

Finally:  Jason Clarke was REALLY good.  I could identify with his character and his transformation.  I understood his motivation.  It's a shame that the promotion for this film relies so heavily on Gabourey Sidibe, because when it comes to the overall story, she is a non-factor.",1376352000,,891,4.9391891891891895

5401506,4,B00A92MG2E,"I liked this movie for the believability of the way each of the actors portrayed their characters. I was actually pleasantly surprised by Zoe Kravitz's acting skills. I really didn't care too much for the ending, but overall this was a well put together movie.",1366329600,,260,4.8
5401507,5,B00A92MG2E,"In short the movie center around a young bircial misfit who comes from a dysfunctional household and decides to get a little gritty right right before her alchoholic dad begins to clean his act up. As far as characters: The mom seems like she was either sick or recovering from drugs in the beginning(staring into space, walking out the house in a trance leaving food on the stove),older- protective sister( who seems like she must've been more of a daddy's girl before the drinks him took over) runs away with boyfriend and returns with a baby. A neighbor who's also a hustler looks out for her and puts her on to the game. A big bully and her two henchmen, the two henchmen end up becoming the main characters sidekicks, a concerned school counselor with his own skeletons in the closet. I just want to say that her selling the drugs is not the main focus in this movie, the main thing seems to be her struggle with understanding who she really is inside and all the factors that have gotten her to this point. Just a few key points to get you interested, no spoilers but overall the movie was very good: Topics that have been covered in film but not in this way, and definitely not with such flawed yet lovable characters. There's so many layers. You feel like you know these people in the end and you want to see what's going to happen next in their lives. And hopefully we will, sequel maybe?...",1365552000,2,1400,4.45136186770428
5401508,5,B00A92MG2E,"The most important quality I find with Amazon's video steaming service, it produces results. Not just ho-hum but stella. Not some or most of the time- ALL the time. All women of color from inner cities should consider this one, of all ages.",1362441600,2,240,4.604651162790698
5401509,3,B00A92MG2E,"This is a subject with huge potential by a director who is very capable, but I wish this movie would have been directed by Claude Chabrol.

Sweetness O'Hara (Zo Kravitz) is a high school girl from mixed parents who lives in the projects. Her father is Irish and her mother is African American. She is not well accepted by the people in her rough neighborhood. She starts looking outside her home for a father figure and for friends and affection in general. When the person she considered friend and father figure gets killed in front of her, she realizes that if she doesn't changes her life-style and her friends, she is either going to die, or end-up in prison. She then correctly makes the decision to take her life in her own hands. It appears that the script is based on a true story.

This is a great subject that has great potential. In addition, the director Victoria Mahoney, appears very gifted and talented. But we have the impression that somebody rushed the movie. We have the impression that they run out of money and that they had to finish quickly. The characters are not well developed and we don't understand well the tension in Zo's house. We need to know more about the Irish father and his brother and about the mother who appears to be constantly depressed. I wish the director would have watched some of the movies made by Claude Chabrol, and in particular ""Le Boucher"" or ""Inspector Bellamy"". There are two major things in a movie: the characters and the story. Once the director has a good story then he/she needs to develop the characters in order for us the spectators to better understand the script and the subplots. The film ""Le Boucher"" is about 90 min long and for the first 60-70 minutes we have the impression that it is a love story because of character development by Chabrol. At the very end of the movie we just realize that was the story of a serial killer who was involved with one his potential victims. ""Inspector Bellamy"" is more of the same. We spend so much time around the inspector, his brother, his wife and the primary suspect of the crime that we forget that there was a crime and somebody really died of horrific death.

I think that this movie lacks character development. The mother, the father, the sister, and the drug addict/dealer high school teacher are major participants in the plot and we don't know why and how they got there. In addition, her drug dealer friend appears to give money and food to the family. Is he doing this for all families in the projects or just hers? What are his criteria? Why is he doing it?

Three stars for a good story with good acting but with unfinished business.",1361059200,3,2655,4.548117154811716

I can see why the director chose to end where she did. The ending is pretty open but hopeful. This is the first time I have seen Zoe Kravitz in a major role. She's understated for much of the movie but capable. The other actors lend very honest and affecting performances. I would watch this again.",1421107200,,428,4.2317073170731705
