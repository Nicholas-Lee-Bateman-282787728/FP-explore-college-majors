2049924,5,B0001ZDLC8,"My Husband & I watched this movie, this week-end and we both were blown away!!! Kiefer Sutherland may have had the ""supporting"" role, but to us HE WAS THE SHOW!!! Marsha Mason is very good, but, Kiefer was simply wonderful.  He plays a Very tramatized young man, and no one has heard him speak a word. He is afraid of EVERYTHING!!! He doesn't bathe, or have anything to do with anyone, and no one wants anything to with him. In walks Marsha Mason. She has one thing no one else has... Faith which turns to love, whether she wants it or not. I was horrified when I found out WHY Kiefer was the way he was. I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it... I Just say WATCH it. Try to be uneffected. I DARE YOU.  I haven't watched too many Kiefer Sutherland movies, but I plan to watch more since seeing this. He is 24 in real life in this movie but he plays an almost 18 year old like he really is that young and younger.  I really cried at the end of this movie, and I am not a person who does that. I just love the under dog. I of course have seen him in ""Lost Boys & Flatliners"", he was good in those... in ""Trapped in Silence"" he is just SUPER!!! It's about 94 minutes long, but while you are watching his ups and downs, in one way it's long and in another it's over way too soon. For me, his pain was mine. I loved in an abusive home, and with lots of help, I finally came out whole. It was uplifting to watch his struggle. If you watch anything, watch this. You won't be sorry. I just wish I knew WHY this movie didn't do well.... IF you lived in an abusive home, and have not resolved your issues, I'd say, don't watch it. If you have, you'll feel your victory all over again. My Husband & I know. My Husband was with me through it all. He walked away from this movie with tears too. Tears of graditude!!!!  Enough said.",1228694400,,1826,4.063888888888889

2049926,5,B0001ZDLC8,"Anyone who has become a fan of Kiefer Sutherland because of ""24"" should check this out.  Most people know his work in ""Lost Boys"", but many have not heard of ""Trapped in Silence"".  He's absolutely marvelous!",1167782400,7,207,4.722222222222222
2049927,5,B0001ZDLC8,I saw this movie when it was televised in 1986.  It is a superb movie.  Both Sutherland and Mason do an excellent job in their roles.  Wonderful acting.,1143331200,3,152,4.357142857142857
2049928,5,B0001ZDLC8,"I'm surprised no-one has rated this movie yet. It's an unsung little tv movie gem that you should see for an early Kiefer Sutherland performance that's guaranteed to make you cry. Marsha Mason stars as a child psychiatrist that is saddled with an ""incurable"" case that no-one else wants.. a violent teen who won't speak and seems to be afraid of everything. Slowly she gains his trust and learns the horrible truth behind what happened to him. While Kiefer only has a supporting role he makes every scene he's in count. And the emotional moment of truth is devastating. May be a bit dated but the impact is still there.",1139270400,31,619,4.636363636363637

8019298,5,B0001ZDLC8,"Not just about a neglected and abused boy, there is a commentary on society. Kiefer Sutherland was superb as the boy.",1393027200,,117,4.619047619047619
8019299,5,B0001ZDLC8,this movie is AWESOME! it's very true to the book (unlike the other Torey Hayden book turned into movie Untamed Love... which was AWFUL!) Keifer Sutherland was awesome and the whole movie was great... definitly one I'l watch again and again.,1375056000,,241,4.902439024390244
8019300,5,B0001ZDLC8,Kiefer performed so awesome in this role! I know from personal experience that Kiefer portrayed this young man very realistically!,1372204800,,130,5.55
8019301,3,B0001ZDLC8,Keifer Sutherland is great in an early role (1986) as an elective mute boy struggling with the aftereffects of childhood trauma. Marsha Mason is okay in the role and looks adorable but the sensitivity that is in the book does not come through her character. I still would recommend seeing it though.,1363910400,2,299,4.769230769230769
8019302,3,B0001ZDLC8,"Made for TV genre. I suppose if you didn't analyze this film for it's realism or as a mental health professional you might enjoy it.  In a way, this is a great film that illuminates many societal ills (political incorrectness, biases, bigotry, good old fashioned ignorance) surrounding the 'sick' person, particularly by clinical staff who are supposed to be there to help the patient.  Some of the clinical staff in this film will make you want to call your congressman!

Kevin (Keifer Sutherland) is performed amazingly and as such is difficult to watch.  At first, I was watching the film from the perspective of today's society and I thought of it as particularly irrelevant, then I had to remind myself that this film was set in 1970-80s culture in the US (released in '86).  How society has changed since then! Still many scenes remain very unrealistic even for that time period.  For example, a female (or male) social worker, psychologist or psychiatric care provider would never be called upon to enter a locked detention facility alone with a suicidal male teen patient who is wielding a knife and hysterical. Also, their are inappropriate client/patient boundaries depicted in this film.",1329696000,,1198,4.994974874371859
