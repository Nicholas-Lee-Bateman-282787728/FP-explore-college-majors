8395438,2,B001ECH17S,"Awesome photography!  It has Kelly Slater in it. My only complaint is that it was so short. I think it would be awesome if they would have cut the filming like an old school skate video like with a Plan B, Blind, or even a 411 format. Simple, introduce a surfer then showcase his/her set with a riffy punk song or a fresh hip hop melody blasting as the magic happens. This film almost had that but by the time I was smiling the credits rolled.",1452556800,,443,4.151162790697675
