8731753,4,B014T15P96,Liked it. Still figuring what it all means but well done.,1488672000,,57,4.2727272727272725
8731754,2,B014T15P96,"I watched Craig Roberts in his most recent film, ""The Fundamentals of Caring"" with Paul Rudd, and was so impressed with his wisecracking yet understated acting abilities and feel for comedic situations that I immediately ordered this one. ""Just JIm"" is a typical teen angst plodder whose plot arc is, by the end, incomprehensible. I couldn't figure out whether Emile Hirch's tough-guy character was ""real"" or if he was just a manifestation of Jim's alter-ego acting out in an parallel reality. Roberts is certainly very talented as an actor, but I think he's overstepped his talents by writing such an inscrutable plot line. Pray tell, Craig, what does it all mean?",1467763200,,665,5.0
8731755,3,B014T15P96,"This is the directorial debut for Craig Roberts who also wrote this and starred in it  which is never a good idea. He takes the character he has played before in the likes of  the admittedly very good  Submarine and plays him, again only in Wales. There are liberal scattering of clichs throughout and the only reason this is in Wales? It was co funded by The Welsh Film Board.

The plot is Roberts plays Jim whose best mate has stopped talking to him and his dog goes missing and then Emile Hirsch moves in next door and is ultra cool. Despite this Hirsch actually has time for him until strange things start happening and then Jim gets to grow a pair.

Now to call this slow is putting it mildly, it wears its quirky heart shakily on its loner sleeve from the start but the script is just so uninspiring and there are some massive plot holes too. I found this to be as funny as a phone directory and equally unedifying. Never write direct and star in your own vanity project. I admire Hirsch for making such films he did the same in Prince Avalanche which is actually better than this. There is clearly a market for these types of films and there are some good parts to it but rating it as ok is still being generous. If in doubt go for a rental  preferably getting some one else to pay for it  that way the disappointment smarts less.",1453593600,,1337,4.281746031746032
8731756,3,B014T15P96,"I enjoyed this movie. It's worth a watch because it is entertaining. I don't think the film is quite memorable however I appluad Craig Roberts on his dedication, determination & most importantly making an entertaining film on such a modest budget.",1451779200,,247,5.048780487804878
8731757,3,B014T15P96,"To avoid spoilers, can't say much.
It does a good job by portraying a boring bullied boy's boring life, yet interesting to audience.
Maybe I was deceived by the trailer, it goes not as I expected.
And I don't quite understand the ending. (avoid spoilers)",1448236800,,254,4.666666666666667
8731758,1,B014T15P96,"This movie is completely nonsensical in narrative, pace, tone, and completely anemic in dialogue. The entire narrative is effected by nonexistent character motivation, explanation, logic. The beginning and end of the film are drawn out, redundant, and thoroughly shallow. It seems this was supposed to be some sort of David Lynch homage, but it's just a tonally confused bore.",1447718400,,376,5.389830508474576
