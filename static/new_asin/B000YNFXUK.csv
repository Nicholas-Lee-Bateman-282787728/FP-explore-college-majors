8233548,1,B000YNFXUK,I love women's pro wrestling so when I saw this with the good reviews I thought it had to be good. I'm not sure if we're watching the same video but this was terrible! The video is compromised of various shoot interviews done with each of the ladies featured as well as following around April Hunter and Velvet Sky in one segment which made no sense and really gave the video an overall feeling of having no direction. The bonus matches are about the only thing I liked about this video. I highly suggest you save your money.,1444003200,,525,4.36734693877551
8233549,4,B000YNFXUK,"Good behind the scenes insider info, with a few laughs to boot.",1423872000,,63,4.333333333333333
8233550,4,B000YNFXUK,"The footage with Sunny, Luna, and Moolah/Mae Young is well worth the price of this DVD.  The matches included are of varying video quality, with the Luna vs. Alicia hardcore match standing out as the best one included.  Another excellent offering from RFVideo/Big Vision.",1207353600,2,271,5.136363636363637
8233551,4,B000YNFXUK,"This dvd includes a compilation of interviews taken from the rfvideo vault. From Fabulous Moolah to Chyna to April Hunter, they are all here discussing the good, the bad, and the ugly of the wrestling business. I didn't enjoy this dvd as much as 'Life in the fast Lane"", which was the men's wrestling version of this dvd. The bonuses for this dvd weren't additional interviews that had been left out, but 5 women's wrestling matches.

Overall, I thought this dvd was very well done and only wish it had included more bonuses and interviews on the dvd. The On the Road footage with April Hunter and Talia Madison was pretty cool to watch and some of the things Luna said during the dvd showed her heart and committment to the sport. Highly recommended for anyone interested in learning more about what goes on behind the scenes in women's wrestling.",1204848000,3,848,4.653333333333333
