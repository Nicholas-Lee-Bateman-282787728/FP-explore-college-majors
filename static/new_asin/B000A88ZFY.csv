I am a new Fan of the Classic Firm workouts and because of that have recently discovered Tracie and her workouts. Unlike some Firm workouts,this is fairly easy to follow without fancy choreography or dancy moves. I tend to have 2 left feet and there was only 1 time during this DVD that I fumbled slightly but since this was my first time,I didn't get discouraged! I highly recomend this,as well as FitPrime Strong Bear&Floor Burn",1431993600,,585,4.580952380952381
8076367,5,B000A88ZFY,"I adore Anna Benson and her work! I'm collecting all of these currently (as well as any other FIRMS I do not own). I already own every single one of the newer Fitprimes and Kickbutts, but I missed the older versions. These workouts are made by Anna Benson who is also the creator of the FIRMS (and the older FIRMS as well). The newer Fitprime and ""Kickbutts"" are made by THESE orginal Fitprimes. The newer Fitprimes and Kickbutts are really nice as well, but for a few of them- I honestly do think they did not have to be remade...or at least wish some of them that WAS remade-had the exact same exercises as the originals (especially the newer Fast Cheetah-that one is good, but definitely not as good or fun of a workout as Tracie's workout is). In the newer Fitprime-""Fast Cheetah"" -they left out a lot of cardio moves that Tracie does in this one. It's totally different. I felt it was a bit too easy..not that this one is ""hard""..just more challanging than the remake of this one. This one also has ball workouts that are fun and easy-and the remake didn't use it at all. This one also has a lot of ""4 limb"" using light weights-which I LOVE---the remake-didn't hardly at all.

This workout can be used by beginners...except maybe use a smaller 8 inch step (Rubbermaid from the store works fine)-or you can find the FIRM 3-in-one Fanny Lifter (purple and blue boxes-I own these and they worked just perfectly with this). Tracie does not use any weights over 5lbs (infact, she says 3lbs), so all you need is a step, ball, and 3lb weights-ankle weights-optional). I used a 3lb dumbell instead of medicine ball since mine is 6lbs and I thought would be too heavy for the ""toss up"" balls....although I didn't even ""toss up"" my 3lb dumbell, I just held it and did kettle bell swings instead of the toss ups--but there isn't as many. She has a nice floor rutine after the cardio. Very innovative and non-boring moves that anyone can follow. :) THE WARM UP IS EVEN GOOD-usually warm ups to me are too long and seem boring..but this one is almost like a mini pre-workout :)

This workout flowed by very fast..the workouts are fun and this workout was NOT boring at all. THE MUSIC IS WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!! They music movtivates you, gets you pumpin, yet relaxes you all at the same time!! I wish I could have a dvd JUST on the soundtracks of these videos!!!!!

You WILL LOVE this video! Of course the setting is more ""one on one-personal trainer"" instead of the huge class like the newer fitprimes and older FIRMS-but very nice still. Trust me on the music tho...very nice to listen to!

Overall this workout is a A+.",1348704000,3,2609,4.509513742071881
8076368,4,B000A88ZFY,"This is the third video I've tried from the old FitPrime series, but it's the first that was a mainly cardio focus. I've found the FitPrime workouts to be quite quirky, but I think that's what I like about them. In particular, I appreciate the variety of unique moves combined with simple choreography and an overall great workout.

The Fast Cheetah DVD is very well-chaptered as listed below. I've added my own brief descriptions of each segment as well as approximate times.

1. Step Climb, 3.5 minutes. This warm-up uses the tall box for slow step-ups/overs, nicely warming up the lower body and beginning to get the heart rate up.

2. Warrior, 2 minutes. This brief stretch incorporates warrior pose from yoga.

3. Ball Toss, 2.5 minutes. Here Tracie uses a medicine ball to ""play"": she does side steps tossing the ball lightly back and forth plus throws the ball in the air while doing squats. I don't have a medicine ball, so I just used a light (3 lb.) dumbbell; this wasn't a perfect substitute, but it worked fine.

4. Step Chug, 3 minutes. Here Tracie sort of stomps on the box for the ""chug"" plus does v-steps and small hops.

5. 4-limb Squats, 4 minutes. Using light weights, Tracie incorporates some toning into the cardio by working the delts and biceps. This segment also contains plenty of balance moves.

6. Push-pull, 5 minutes. This section includes knee-ups and jumps from a lunge position.

7. ND Handstand and Hip, 2 minutes. Beginning on the non-dominate side, you perform ""handstands"" on the tall box--these aren't as scary as they sound, as you basically just put your hands on the box and jump up to raise your hips (ie, you don't actually come all the way up into a true handstand position). This segment also includes squats.

8. Hyper Sweeps, 2 minutes. Here you keep your hands on the box for squats and rear leg extensions.

9. Kickbox, 2 minutes. Tracie incorporates some simple kickboxing moves with knee-ups, side kicks, and punches.

10. D Handstand and Hip, 2 minutes. #7 repeated on the dominant side.

11. Climb and Jump, 2 minutes. More tall box climbs, this time with jumps and rear leg extensions.

12. 4-limb Cross, just under 3 minutes. The light weights are again used for more delt and bicep work with squats and dips.

13. Ball sports, just under 3 minutes. This segment is kind of fun; you again use the medicine ball to simulate sports moves.

14. Ball balance, 2 minutes. Uses the medicine ball for balance and stretch.

15. + AWS Spring Hypers, 1 minute. Not sure what this name means, but it's basically some cool-down work with the ball involving slow squats, balance, and reach. At the end, you add ankle weights for the floor work.

16. ND Bridge Pecs, 3 minutes. With one foot on the box and the ball between your legs, you do bridge work followed by push-ups.

17. D Bridge Pecs, 2.5 minutes. Same thing repeated on other side (the segment is shorter due to less set-up time).

18. Prone Spine, 3 minutes. This is some basic back extension work; ends with a plank.

19. Supine Abs, 4 minutes. Simple crunches for the upper and lower abs plus obliques; also includes some inner thigh work. The ankle weights are removed at the end of this segment.

20. Crunch Stretch, 3.5 minutes. There are just a couple of additional moves for the abs without the weights, then Tracie performs a final stretch mostly on the floor.

The workout comes in right at 55 minutes. Overall I enjoyed it, although I think I'll need to do it a few more times to really get the moves down--sometimes I get confused on the tall box climbs. Overall, I liked this workout and think that it will be a nice alternative cardio option.",1134345600,15,3658,4.621329211746523
