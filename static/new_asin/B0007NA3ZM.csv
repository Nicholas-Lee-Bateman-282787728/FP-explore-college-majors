8049212,5,B0007NA3ZM,"Wine Noir gives you a unpretentious view of wine, from how it is made, how to taste, how to order, and even the different paraphernalia such as cork screws, glasses, and bottles.  This movie is a great learning tool that will give you more confidence when ordering your next bottle of wine.",1187654400,2,290,4.576923076923077
8049213,5,B0007NA3ZM,"Finally, a fun accessable tool to take the stigma out of purchasing, ordering and enjoying wine. This film makes a great gift for anyone who enjoys dining out or entertaining friends. It is chock full of useful information and makes a great foundation to understanding even the most seemingly complicated wine list. Teriffic gift to bring to a friends house for dinner with a thoughtfully chosen bottle of wine. Great in a gift basket too. I think it would make a great focal point for a wine tasting party. It is a fun format that reminds me of a cool show  that you would see on the Food Network! I loved it!",1109635200,10,610,4.446428571428571
