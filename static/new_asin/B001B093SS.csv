3477478,1,B001B093SS,"Disappointed to say the least. This garbage is NOT a sequel to ""Skeleton Key"" ((A good movie)) This had absolutely NOTHING to do with ""Skeleton Key"". John Johnson's Skeleton Key 2: 667 the neighbor of the beast, is less than a B movie with direction from a moron. Off the street acting would of given it a better rating. Can't really call this a movie as there was no story line just a mess connected with more mess.  Take home movies of strangers dressed badly at Halloween would give you a better movie. Learn from our mistake and don't waste your time or money on this ""movie"". Taught me to read the reviews before buying !!!!!!!!!",1256083200,27,634,4.4655172413793105

3477480,1,B001B093SS,"After having seen such an awesome movie (Skeleton Key) I was so majorly disappointed with Skeleton Key 2. These two movies have nothing in common, I find it Skeleton Key 2 a disgrace to Skeleton Key! Don't buy this movie people, Skeleton Key 2, waste of your money!!!!",1247356800,16,268,4.604166666666667
3477481,1,B001B093SS,"Dont even think about buying or rent this movie... I throw it to the garbage. Nothing to do with the first part.. This movie was made by people that didn't have nothing to do and they decided to film a movie and invented a sequel just to attract buyers.

The quality like handcamera...",1244505600,8,285,4.377358490566038
3477482,5,B001B093SS,The folks at Darkstone have once again put out a fun filled film. Like it's predecessor this film really defies description. What it is a fun film with lots of laughs and lots moments of ew[...] The SK series revolves around the lead character Howard and his attempts to survive the mythical city of Nilbog inhabitated byt many monsters and their insane creator Dr. Buenos Noches. Like I said it defies description.,1233705600,3,415,4.777777777777778
3477483,3,B001B093SS,"Is this the best movie ever?  No my friends, it isn't.  Is it full of campy B movie cheese?  You betcha.  This release is the sequel to John Johnson's Skeleton Key (which was the better of the two movies I gotta say).

The basic plot involves our hero going into the evil land of ""Nilbog"" where anything can happen.  Including really really random pop culture references which make you chuckle and scratch your head until they come about again in the plot.

Those of you that hope it had anything to do with the big screen release a couple years ago...yeah this movie has nothing to do with it.  This movie is NOT Citizen Kane, nor was it meant to be.  It's a B movie.  A purposely campy and you should watch it with your tongue firmly lodged in your cheek.

Also, keep an eye out for the lovely Danielle Fluker in this one.",1227916800,,824,4.285714285714286
3477484,1,B001B093SS,"......I couldn't believe how cheesy this film was even in the first ten minutes!  I can only speak on 10 minutes because I literally couldn't stomach letting the dvd play any further and watching an hour of my life wasted, and that speaks volumes because I usually give every movie a chance no matter how corny.  Cinematically, the filming was horrible; it looked like an average joe took a moderate quality video cam and decided to play director/starring actor and record his weekday morning.  I mean it was just that horrible that I couldn't continue.  If any of you has ever had the unfortunate displeasure of viewing a film called ""Woods of Evil"", this has the same picture quality and cheese content. The part that upset me the most is that I rented this film thinking that it would be a sequel or continuation of the original theater film ""Skeleton Key"", and it definitely has no relation to the movie whatsoever. Overall it was a waste of time, I should have taken heed to the low star ratings it had gotten on other sites.",1224115200,4,1030,4.581521739130435
3477485,4,B001B093SS,it's an indie film..and it was funny.  It's not trash IMHO.  I think everyone should form their own opinion after watching it.,1221782400,3,126,4.681818181818182
3477486,1,B001B093SS,"I giggled a few times, but do not purchase this movie. Please spend your money on a different title. I cannot believe I am stuck with this trash. I am ashamed to have this in my movie collection. It is bad! Real Cheese!!!",1221004800,4,221,4.162790697674419
8280777,1,B001B093SS,This movie isn't a sequal to Kate Hudsons movie. There is another Skeleton Key made in 2006. This was the sequal to that movie.,1524787200,,127,4.333333333333333
8280778,1,B001B093SS,"Very dissapointed, this movie was nothing but a commentary, and there is no option of turning it off, I could not figure out what was going on because I couldn't hear it because of all the talking, I tried everything and there is absolutly no way to turn off the commentary, what a complete waste of money.",1402358400,,306,4.385964912280702
8280779,1,B001B093SS,This movie is not like the first Skeleton Key not even close to it! Very confusing and just ridiculous not my favorite movie at all! Stunk to high heaven!,1397260800,,154,4.344827586206897
8280780,1,B001B093SS,I only bought this because I know one of the girls in the movie. Her name is Danielle Fluker and she is smoking hot. The movie itself was poorly made and its hard to watch because its just so bad.,1369267200,,196,3.925
8280781,1,B001B093SS,This movie was so bad that we weren't able to sit through more than a few minutes of it.  I was looking for a sequel to the movie with Kate Hudson.  This is NOT a sequel.  It has nothing to do with that movie at all.  I can't even begin to describe how horrible this movie is.,1320796800,,276,3.789473684210526
8280782,1,B001B093SS,"After finally watching The Skeleton key and sitting on the edge of my seat, i was very dissapointed with The Skeleton Key 2. These two movies have nothing in common, and the story line for the second is totally different from the first movie.  I couldn't even get past the first 10 minutes of The Skeleton Key 2.",1306972800,,312,4.379310344827586

I feel like I totally wasted my money on this one.",1287014400,2,196,3.6904761904761907
8280784,5,B001B093SS,i have watched almost all of mr. johnson films and i find that they are the most original and funniest films i have seen.  if you are looking for big budget cookie cutter movies that hollywood turns out this is not the movie for you.  masterpiece theater this is not.  you want a good time with surreal and absurd plotlines this is for you.  closed minded people don't apply. only open minded people,1268697600,,399,4.424657534246576
8280785,1,B001B093SS,"this movie here look like an movie you film from home, Did not expexct this movie to turn out they way it did. 5 thumbs down.",1265760000,,125,3.8461538461538463
8280786,2,B001B093SS,"For those out there who were wondering, this is NOT a sequel to the 2005 Kate Hudson film 'Skeleton Key' but rather a sequel to another film with the same title. While I haven't watched the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Skeleton-Key/dp/B000IJ7A9M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Skeleton Key</a>, I found that I really didn't need to. The movie follows the protagonist from the first film as he returns to the town of Nilbog, a town that has been overrun by zombies. Once there, he has to figure out how to survive & save his friends!

OK, let's be honest here. This film wasn't great. It was downright hokey overall. But then... it isn't supposed to be good. The movie looks to be an out & out parody of other horror movies. The feel I got from this film was that it reminded me of some of the independent films that might have come out from Troma. If you know what to expect, the film isn't that horribly bad. If I liked this sort of film, I probably would have rated it higher. I just don't really like horror & comedy mixed together. Plus I thought that the film would have been better if it was shorter. The one liners & stuff didn't really make the 2 hour film that bearable. If it was a half hour shorter, it would have been far better served & I would have given this 3 stars rather than 2.

If you just want to watch a schlocky horror film, go get this film from your video store & rent it first. If you've seen the original & want to buy it, I assume that you know what you are getting yourself in for. If you are looking for a sequel to the Kate Hudson film, you won't find it here. Yes, the eye looks very similar to the cover for her movie, but it is not.",1265414400,8,1717,4.447619047619048
