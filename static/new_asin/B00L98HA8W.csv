8664590,5,B00L98HA8W,"This is one of the top Kung Fu films that wasn't either Shaw Brothers or Golden Harvest. The choreography isn't quite on par with the best examples of the era, but it has frequent and enjoyable sequences of action, and the iron armor gimmick is really fun. On top of that, it has a surprisingly engaging story about a wrongfully accused man who has to set things right... with help from unexpected places.

The characters are cool in that goofy Kung Fu flick way, and if you meet the movie on its level (low-budget but awesome), you'll have a really good time. Highly recommended!",1528156800,,580,4.576923076923077
