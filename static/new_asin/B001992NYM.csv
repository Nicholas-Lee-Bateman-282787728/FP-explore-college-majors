3429474,5,B001992NYM,"This is a great family show about an angel trying to do great with an ex-cop.  You see a lot of stars that either already are big stars or soon will be.  The special effects are great for that time.  The acting is good but not great.  There are feel good episodes and make you think episodes.  You will laugh and get sad.  Great for the whole family.  Sadly it ends before we see if the angel earns his wings, but we get a look at the future.",1445040000,,442,3.9545454545454546

3429506,5,B001992NYM,These final scenarios were politically incorrect - even back then.  Most likely why the series didn't survive.  When Michael Landon chose to use this format to disagree with political and social issues I'm sure he knew that eventually his series wouldn't be renewed.  I found the commentary ahead of it's time in addressing some of the inequities that are around us.  The challenges were the same then as they are now.  Good series with the right amount of focus on challenges we face.,1427760000,,485,4.795180722891566

3429601,5,B001992NYM,Nice to finally be able to complete this series set with it's final season. This is unfortunately a short set compared to prior seasons because there are only 13 episodes. Victor French passed away I believe in this series final year which is probably why the show ended early. Same quality episodes as in the prior seasons. Michael Landon & Victor French were an exceptional team-up. For sure a very worthwhile purchase.,1412899200,2,421,4.861111111111111

3429616,3,B001992NYM,"(UPDATE - April 8, 2015), The only episode on the ""Highway to Heaven: Season Five"" 3-disc DVD release from Mill Creek Entertainment
that I'm 100% sure isn't uncut is ""The Source"".

The longest episode on this 3-disc set is ""Hello and Farewell - Part 2"" which runs for 49:27.

""Hello and Farewell - Part 1"" runs for 47:14, ""Whose Trash Is It Anyway?"" runs for 47:19 and ""The Source"" runs for 47:32.

The other nine episodes all run for 48 minutes and change.

Unfortunately, there's an entire 39 second scene that's missing from ""The Source"" and that scene originally came right before
the part where the character Colin McCormick says ""Boy, that Smith ticks me off"".
I saw that now deleted scene fully intact via a YouTube upload of that episode.
That now deleted scene showed Michael Landon's character Jonathan Smith while still sitting in a chair by an office table refusing
to allow the two male Santa Luiza High School newspaper reporters Colin McCormick and Doug Rollins to publish the untruthful story
about Dack Rambo's character Larry Nichols.
The final words of that scene came when Colin McCormick told Jonathan Smith ""All Right, You Want Hard Facts, We'll Get You Hard Facts"".

On this DVD set, the video and audio are completely out of sync during the final 9 minutes of ""The Source"".

The fifth season aired infrequently on NBC from October 12, 1988 to August 4, 1989.

Notable guest stars from the fifth season of ""Highway to Heaven"" were Cristina Raines, Dack Rambo, David Spielberg, Haing S. Ngor,
Ken Kercheval, Lew Ayres, Lloyd Bochner, Matthew Perry, Priscilla Barnes, Robert David Hall and Will Estes.

The packaging of this 3-disc set is an absolute disgrace.
Disc #1 is stacked directly on top of Discs #2 and #3.
