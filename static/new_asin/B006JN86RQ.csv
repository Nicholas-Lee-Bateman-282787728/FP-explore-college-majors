8499631,5,B006JN86RQ,This was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. It should have had a theatrical release but I am very glad I found it by chance. I absolutely recommend it!,1494460800,,167,3.8
8499632,2,B006JN86RQ,Did not keep my interest.,1475539200,,25,4.2
8499633,4,B006JN86RQ,"This is a good movie. It held my interest all the way through. I really liked the surprise ending. Ron Pearlman was fantastic in it. Even though I usually go for the blood and gore this movie hinted at it, but I did not miss it. I changed my mind a couple of times as to who the killer was. Then the ending was such a surprise I was asking myself how did they do that. I watched it on Amazon prime. Thank you, Amazon.",1474156800,,417,3.9176470588235293
8499634,3,B006JN86RQ,"Not an interesting movie in the least.  The concept was sound, but it was poorly executed and could have been much richer considering some of the talent.",1463011200,,153,4.666666666666667
8499635,4,B006JN86RQ,"Decent movie - with a great topic. That begs the age-old question - is evil inherited or nurtured?! And a twisted ending! Didn't see it coming and I liked that. Not many reviews to go by on this, and both extremes in people's reactions - so I gave it a try. One reviewer says it isn't scary - but I don't think that was the point of this movie! If you're looking for a slasher movie or gore - forget it. Yeah, it has some intense scenes - which are ""gore-ish"" but more in the vein of showing less and letting your imagination take the rest. At times, it did feel like a Made-For-TV movie, but I still stuck with it. And I really liked the lead character. At times, a bit of overacting but overall he was a good character who moved the action along. Ron Perlman is always good in my eyes and he is a major character. So that helped. And I think the editing was done well - it keeps you guessing. At one point I thought I had it figured out only to be proven wrong. Anyhow - a good movie to watch and just let it take you.",1456531200,4,1020,4.004901960784314
8499636,5,B006JN86RQ,"Good acting, twisted plot, one mystery after another, highly recommended!",1456272000,2,73,6.4
8499637,5,B006JN86RQ,"Well I might be a little bias cause I adore Ron Perlman,he's great at whatever character he portrays,the movies might be crummy but he's fantastic.p.s/ can you tell I'VE got a crush?",1429315200,3,182,4.71875
8499638,4,B006JN86RQ,Exciting Thriller! An ending with a twist! Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Much better than I expected.,1339286400,3,107,4.4
8499639,1,B006JN86RQ,"The movie's premise is that sadistic serial killers do so because of some genetically inheritable condition - it's in the blood (by the way that premise is not supported in the least by historical facts), anyway we have a physician on death row for such killings and his father also had a few. Meanwhile on the outside is the other subplot and it turns out he had a son who was adopted (unknowing to him) by a family. He's having dreams of murders some of which resemble the modus operandi of the on death row physician. Could he be following the genetic line?

Acting and character portrayal seemed overly staged (made up); scenes of a knife followed by a body with an obvious blood and wound prosthetic and sometimes followed by a hand holding a surgical cutting instrument were about as scary as saturday morning cartoons. Flashbacks, dreams and editing made the story flow like water tumbling in a rocky stream and with the poor audio, poor enunciation and no subtitles all made the story a challenge to follow. You end up not caring what happens to the characters.",1333152000,3,1069,4.656084656084656
