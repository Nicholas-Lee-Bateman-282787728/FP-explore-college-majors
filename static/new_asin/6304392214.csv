860536,5,6304392214,I LOVE this movie! It concentrates on Jackie and Sammo's acting abilities. Very refreshing to see if you are weary of the comic slapstick of his earlier movies. The english subtitles are far more indepth then the  American verson... The Scene with the teacher tears me apart every time..  The fight with the brother does the same thing. I have been through all the  fights and the verbal abuse too. I am disabled too. This film really opens  your eyes to how people treat the disabled. I think that Jackie was aiming  for more films like this. Shanghi Noon is another example of what he may  have been trying to do. Heart of Dragon is my personal Favorite... I liked  it better then Shanghai Noon.. Jackie and Sammo's best film to come out of  Hong Kong.. Hope to see it on the big screen someday...,962841600,3,799,4.462068965517242

860538,4,6304392214,"This is a poignant look at the relationship between two brother of which one is mentally handicapped. I thought that Crime Story was the only movie that showed Jackie's acting talent until I saw this one. Sammo Hung is very  good also. Basically Jackie plays a cop whose aspirations are put on hold  by his brother who he must look after. Eventually his brother gets mixed up  in his work ends up being held hostage. The story is exceptional and still  leaves room for a mesmerizing fight scene at the end, in which Jackie take  care of his brother's kidnappers. A definite must for anyone.",937008000,3,590,4.580952380952381

Through a series of unfortunate events, things go wrong for Jackie and his brother which turns into a desperate rescue attempt and some heart tugging moments.  All the action is at the end but the build up is important and you can feel Jackie's emotions in the finale.

860799,5,6304392214,Jackie Chan in his prime. What more could you ask for? This film is one of Chan's best works as it portrays him in a more serious and dramatic atmosphere than his current films today.,1400371200,,183,4.257142857142857
860800,3,6304392214,my customer was very happy to get this movie for a decent price. Too bad I had to double ship it (and therefore double price on shipping) to get it where it needed to go.,1364428800,,170,3.8857142857142857

860861,2,6304392214,This was a sad movie for me and I couldn't watch it.  Sammo playing a mentally challenged person and Jackie as his brother.  I had to send this back.  I'm sure it is a fine movie but it was too hard for me to watch.,1338768000,,215,3.7333333333333334
860862,5,6304392214,This film rules the school! Sammo Hung is a phenomenal actor and filmmaker! I wish people would look more to films such as this and not always to Rush Hour and Shanghai Noon.,1331856000,,174,4.303030303030303
860863,4,6304392214,"Like all of the 20th Century Fox DVD's in this set, this movie has excellent digitally restored video and sound. As good as the Dragon Dynasty's restored DVD's. I think this is a good movie as it allows a lot of emotional acting from both Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung. They were both very good in this movie. One less star since Sammo Hung was not allowed to do any kung fu in this movie at all!

However, Sammo's physical prowess is shown plenty in scenes where he was kicked around by the bad guys.

Thanks to 20th Century Fox for a great job in restoring this classic, I love it!",1322870400,,580,4.216216216216216

860865,1,6304392214,"This movie pairs Jackie up with his 'big brother', Samo Hung. They play brothers in the film, not much unlike Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman in Rainman. There is very little action in this movie, it is more of a drama. In fact, I don't even think Jackie cracks a smile once in this movie- it is kind of a tear-jerker, relying more on acting than action. If you are looking for the typical Jackie Chan comedy and action, look elsewhere. It is worth having if you are huge fan, however.",1230422400,,483,4.318681318681318
860866,5,6304392214,"Jackie Chan proves he is not only an action star in this movie. I loved it, but as a true Jackie Chan fan, it would be hard not to. For the first time Jackie and Sammo show a range of emotion that American audiences have never seen before. The intense scenes between the two of them leave a Jackie fan in tears. The two things I didn't like are the fact that Jackie doesn't dub his own voice and the dubber doesn't show the range of emotion that fits the scenes. Also the ending is a little vague, you're not really sure of the ending. Any way, for the true Jackie fan, a roller coaster ride and I enjoyed every minute of it!",1185494400,,625,4.0894308943089435

Chan's character's dream since he was a child was to be a sailor and the chance arrives in the mail. A job offer. To do so, he must leave his brother in the care of questionable others. The brother gets in trouble often and before Chan leaves, he gets into a doozy of a jam.

Okay, it's a hokey B movie with cheesy music but it was fun to watch. Lots of Jackie Chan action and a decent plot. Relax, don't think too much, grab a pop and munchies and enjoy the show.",1154995200,2,573,4.162162162162162
860869,4,6304392214,"This is in response to the Feb. 5th review titled ""ORIGINAL IS BETTER~!""

While I agree with the message, it was put the wrong place. While in most cases the R1 releases of Hong Kong films are heavily cut and dubbed, these releases by Fox, are actually done by the fantastic HK company Fortune Star, and only released under Fox. They contain the UNCUT film in the original Cantonese language (DTS too!), as well as the English dub. As usual the picture quality is more than fantastic. The only downpoints are the usual Fortune Star downpoints: Hardly-to-no extras, and slightly edited sound fx,(but in this case no original mono sound). Also the subtitles are actually dubtitles, but are not terrible. In all, this is still one of the better versions of this film on DVD, especially for under $10.

PS. As for the argument that ""no other countries have their own cuts, like France,"" maybe you should look into Luc Besson's distribution of Asian (especially Thai) films.",1140998400,13,969,4.796407185628743
860931,3,6304392214,"I think Jackie Chan is an amazing actor. I think Sammo Hung is really great as well. But the dramatic roles? I don't think they pan out as well for either of them. I think this movie is pretty good, but I could barely watch some of the parts because it was turning too mushy... too ""chick-flick""ish. I like the action, like the comedy, but the dramatic sign of it is too much. Sorry, Jacki, sorry Sammo, better luck next time. :) My suggestion: get this if you want to see Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung's mushy sides.",1083888000,4,514,4.255102040816326
860932,5,6304392214,"While this has action-and whenever Sammo directs, expect Jackie to be a juggernaut, the real story is the bond between them. Through the story(and the real life events behind this movie) Jackie and Sammo show themselves as inseperable. Jackie walks hand in hand with Sammo at a time when critics were circling around Sammo like vultures on roadkill. While the story will lead you to be upset with yourself for laughing at a person with disabilities(which you will) you will find redemption in seeing them staying in a relationship no matter what. Jail, jewel thieves and the merchant marines cannot split this duo. Their bond comes through, even if you see the film in Japanese with English subtitles, which was my first experience with it.",1076112000,5,740,4.928
860933,2,6304392214,"Awful dubbing and terrible soundtrack are but two of the reasons you should skip this film.  The tired cliche of a man who must sacrifice his own freedom to play caretaker for a gentle mentally deficient adult male is trotted out once again in this film that does not know what genre it wants to be.  Sammo Hung plays the rotund brother of police officer Jackie Chan whose dreams of becoming a sailor are superceeded by his obligation to his brother.  Althought the movie tries to generate pathos through Hung's character, many of the mishaps he falls into due to his deficiency are played for laughs, resulting in an uncomfortable mishmash of comedy and drama.  In addition, there are several action scenes that are played ""over-the-top"" that seem ridiculously out of place in a movie that spends the first two-thirds at such an excruciatingly slow pace that you may be tempted to turn it off.  There are numerous plot holes that leave the viewer scratching his head and the ending montage is laughable in its sentimentality.  Plus, there is more than one shot of Hung's naked buttocks which will haunt my nightmares for years to come.",1074643200,2,1136,4.770408163265306

THIS MOVIE TENDS TO FOCUS MORE ON ITS PLOT THAN ITS FIGHT SCENES, WHICH IS SOMETHING YOU DON'T REALLY SEE TOO OFTEN IN A JACKIE CHAN MOVIE. SAMO HUNG PLAYS JACKIE'S BROTHER TO PERFECTION.

860935,5,6304392214,"Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung completely re-invented the Hong Kong action movie in the 1970's and 1980's, and Jackie especially was the undisputed king of the HK box office.  Heart Of The Dragon was a brave step for them, a movie that largely eschews action and focuses on drama.  I guess they wanted to prove that there was more to them than best-in-the-world action direction, and here they prove it beyond doubt.  The dramatic performances of both are excellent, and Sammo's direction is wonderful.  It's a really moving story, very well told.
Obviously they knew that the fans out there expected action though, so the movie has a few small fights and then a largely unnecessary but brilliantly filmed action finale that lasts a good 20 minutes.  The movie would probably have been just as good without it, but one cannot complain about a 20 minute action scene when such masters of the art were behind it.  Even if the action is all you care about, the quality of the finale here is so good you will not want to miss this movie.",1043539200,7,1029,4.595628415300546

If you're looking for action, you may want to look elsewhere . . . if you want to be suprised by Jackie's acting range, or if you're a completist, don't miss this one.  It's certainly a quality film.  And if you're into sappy foriegn films, you may be suprised just how good this one is.  Samo and Jackie are brilliant together.",974246400,4,643,4.756756756756757
