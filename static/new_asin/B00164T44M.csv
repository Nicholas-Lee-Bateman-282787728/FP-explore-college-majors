The program offers a range of topics that cover a wide variety of problems common to people who present, regardless of their skill level. The content presentation is very logical in sequence and the transitions from one topic to the next are seamless. Some of the topics covered in this DVD include how to make proper eye contact and use of hands, how to improve one's appearance, intonation and speaking pace.

If you are someone who has to present or even just talk briefly during company meetings, or classroom presentations, you will truly benefit from this instructional DVD.",1208217600,,694,4.931623931623932
