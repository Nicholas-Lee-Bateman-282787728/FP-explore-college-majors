1957290,3,B0000W5H7E,"This useful Anchor Bay double-disc brings together a couple of minor Hammer Draculas that aren't particularly worth buying on their own but make a much tastier proposition as a double-bill.

Dracula Prince of Darkness was their only Scope entry in the Christopher Lee series, but it's frankly a rather dull and dragged out affair - Drac doesn't appear for 49 minutes and the first hour of the film could have been done much better in half the time. Lee is clearly bored and has little to do, but Andrew Keir's gun-totting monk is one of Hammer's most interesting characters and there's no doubting the effectiveness of Barbara Shelley's transformation from tight-assed sister in law to hottie demon dyke (""You don't need Charles!""). There are good moments, from Dracula's reincarnation to the Dracula-on-Ice finale, and the fact that the hero and heroine are called Charles and Diana is good for a few unintentional laughs, but this is far to sedate and drawn out for its own good.

The DVD is an impressive package, with some great home movie footage of the shoot taken by 'juvenile lead' Francis Matthews' brother, original trailer and an audio commentary typically dominated by Christopher Lee. A rather uninspiring episode of the World of Hammer clip show dealing with the studio's vampire movies is also included. The 2.35:1 transfer is mostly pretty good, although the arrival at Castle Dracula is excessively dark.

The Satanic Rites of Dracula (belatedly released in a cut version as Count Dracula and His Vampire Bride in the US) was the swansong of the Hammer-Lee Dracs, and while not a classic it is a much more interesting attempt to do something new with the material in a modern-day setting than it's predecessor, Dracula AD 1972. Here Dracula is a reclusive Howard Hughes-like tycoon weary of immortality but determined to take the world with him when he goes by unleashing a new and improved Black Death, developed with the help of key government figures who think it's just a bargaining chip to create a new world order. Pitted against him are a couple of British secret service agents whose own boss is one of Dracula's Four Horsemen of the new Apocalypse, a special branch officer and the grandson of Van Helsing and his own granddaughter. The low budget is apparent, but the ideas go some way to compensate (certainly Drac's plan is a more convincing Armageddon than anything Damien Thorn planned in The Final Conflict) and Alan Gibson's direction, though not always successful, shows some imagination.

The extras package is less impressive here, with only trailers for the UK and US releases and the same Hammer clip show as Prince of Darkness, but it is a very respectable widescren transfer of the uncut UK version.",1133740800,,2739,4.934924078091107

1957292,5,B0000W5H7E,"This is an awesome movie collection
Prince Of Darkness is typical of a Hammer Film
Satanic Rites is somewhat hokey, but then again it was released in the 70's.  In Prince Of Darkness Christopher Lee has no lines whatsoever, and I personally believe that only enhances his performance as Lord of the Undead.
In Satanic Rites, Lee once again dons the fangs and cape
to reprise the role of the Dark Lord for the final time
his lines are minimal, as they are in other Hammer vampire films, but then again most vampires are not interested in making conversation; They're more interested in draining the blood from a victim.
Again I state that Lee reprises the role of the Dark Lord for the final time and in this movie his demise is brought on by the Hawthorn plant, which supposedly was the same type of plant that was used for Christs crown of thorns and therefore is considered a holy relic.
As always, Lee's performance as the Lord of the Undead makes the viewer fall in love with the Vampire and makes you want to be able to find a way to step in and intervene when Van Helsing (played by Peter Cushing) is preparing to destroy him.
Note: Satanic Rites Of Dracula was given more than one title one of the other ones is Dracula And His Vampire Brides",1084406400,5,1249,4.430434782608696
1957313,4,B0000W5H7E,"I bought this Anchor Bay double DVD set to get a good copy of ""The satanic rites of dracula"", the last Hammer dracula film to feature Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing together, and was not disappointed. Image and sound are much improved on the copy I had previously, and the film can now at least be watched for what it is - one of the better  sequels to the original (and best) from 1958, and a fine end to the series for Lee and Cushing. The contemporary (70's) setting works better than it did in ""Dracula AD 1972"" and the story at least attempts to advance some interesting ideas. The film has a number of classic scenes - Van Helsing casting the silver bullet, Dracula and Van Helsings' confrontation in the tower block, and the final scene itself. I already had a good copy of ""Dracula: prince of darkness"" but was pleasantly suprised to find that the image and audio quality of the film on this set is fine, and it has an audio commentary with all key actors including Christopher Lee as a welcome bonus. This film was the first sequel to feature Lee back as the Count after the '58 original (he did not appear in the first sequel ""The brides of dracula""in an attempt to avoid typecasting) and IMHO is the best of them - Terence Fishers assured direction, a great supporting cast, and a solid story. Peter Cushing as Van Helsing is missed, but Andrew Keir as Father Sandor does justice to his role as a worthy adversary for Dracula.  Overall, two of the best Hammer dracula films at a good price, and a must for Hammer/Gothic fans.",1279497600,5,1539,4.453900709219858
1957314,3,B0000W5H7E,"It's out of print at this time, but I just acquired a new sealed copy, and I'm delighted to have the films -- particularly PRINCE OF DARKNESS. However, I have to reiterate what others have pointed out, here and elsewhere, that this is one botched release in comparison to so many other really great efforts by Anchor Bay.

1. First and foremost, it's widescreen (thank goodness), but NON-anamorphic. For a 2004 release, that's surprising, and not consistent with some (most?) of Anchor Bay's other Hammer releases.

2. The double feature is on two discs (thank goodness, again), BUT...they're both flippers (two-sided) for no good reason. In the case of both films, the supplements would absolutely have fit on the same side as the feature.

3. It gets worse. Compounding the fact that both discs are flippers, both are MISLABELED as to title and sides. I won't attempt to explain the labeling. Just take a few minutes to check each side and VERY CAREFULLY notate -- with a fine point Sharpie in the safe area in the center of the disk -- what's on each side, and you'll save yourself a world of grief later.

4. Not only could these films and features have been supplied on two nicely labeled one-sided discs, the ""World of Hammer"" extra included on each one is the same episode. Yes, you get the same extra twice in this set. According to IMDB, there were 13 episodes in this series, and it's not that these were all that stupendous in the first place...but what a waste.

5. Finally (I hope), my copy lacked the very nice insert cards with the poster reproductions that were supplied with other films in the series. Whether this release ever had them, I don't know. But collectors appreciate and value such things, especially when so nicely produced. We also value consistency in releases of a series.

All in all, somebody at Anchor Bay was asleep at the switch on this one. Big time. Hey, we still love you -- but how about getting some of these films back into print, and with the attention and quality of presentation they deserve?",1259712000,4,2038,4.662952646239554
1957315,5,B0000W5H7E,It is always nice to get a product as it was advertised.  This one did all of that.,1239580800,,83,3.611111111111111
1957316,3,B0000W5H7E,"Although this film holds a nostalgic pull for this particular viewer, (having seen it in its original stateside release at a Drive-In)an honest assessment today compels us to admit that the film is a study of a studio in decline.

True, the film is not without its assets, not the least of which is the veteran cast, with the lovely and always dramatically compelling Barbara Shelley pretty much walking off with the picture. Suzan Farmer, as always, is charming, and very easy on the eyes.

However, Bernard Robinson's art direction, (though adequate) doesn't begin to approach his earlier work, (particulary in ""Brides of Dracula,"" ""The Man Who Could Cheat Death,"" and ""The Kiss of the Vampire""--and Robinson's genius is of a type that the work 'adequate' sits uncomfortably upon). Curiously, Mr. Robinson was back at the top of his game months later when he designed the plushy, ""Plague of the Zombies.""

The cinematography is compromised by grainy film stock, poor color, (as noted by film historian Leslie Halliwell), often rushed lighting, and a cumbersome and unnecessary use of wide screen. Terence Fisher filmographer, Wheeler Dixon, has noted the deficiencies in Michael Reeds's lensing on this project. In any case Mr. Reed nowhere equals the beautiful compositions he had managed on ""The Gorgon,"" all of which makes the absence of Jack Asher particularly evident.

That the aforesaid technical credentials are lacking bears ample testament to the studio's drastic mid 60's cost cutting strategies, and the artistically regrettable, but imminent move away from Bray studios.

Moreover, the commercial objectives are baldly evinced here--the film screams ""Formula.""

Despite these shortcomings, and since this film was one of the last shot at Bray, it does bear compensatory traces of former glories. Thus we fully appreciate the hapless quartet's posthumous toast to Count Dracula, whilst the armorial flags above them billow in a ghostly breeze and the underscoring throbs unnervingly.

And Miss Shelley, as a vampiress, descending the staircase in a diaphanous gown goes a far way on the asset side of the ledger.

Mr. Lee for his part, does his usual hissing and cape waving. Too much is made of his lack of dialogue here. After all he has only a few lines at the beginning of ""Horror of Dracula,"" and a few lines in this film's successor, ""Dracula Has Risen From the Grave."" So why on earth people feel the absence of such scanty phrases damages this film, who can say?

This picture would have been far better had it been done five years earlier. That said, it is a masterpiece compared to the dreck the eviscerated Hammer would be foisting on the public just five years later.",1216684800,,2693,5.033707865168539
1957317,5,B0000W5H7E,"Christopher Lee has always been my favorite actor to portray the evil, diabolical Count Dracula.  Standing at 6 feet and four inches, the handsome Lee gave Dracula a very strong, charismatic, and sensual presence that no other actor could.  This double feature from Anchor Bay proves that both Dracula and Lee have survived the test of time. . . . Throughout the decades, they have remained ever popular.

  Made in 1966, ""Dracula:  Prince of Darkness,"" is a strong sequel to 1958's ""The Horror of Dracula.""  Ten years have passed since Van Helsing caused Dracula to disintegrate into ashes.  Now, a faithful servant has waited patiently to kill an innocent traveler and use their blood in a Satanic ritual to resurrect Dracula.  This movie has an intriguing plot but its not quite as engaging as ""The Horror of Dracula.""  The fact that Lee doesn't speak a word is irritating.  I enjoy listening to his deep, commanding voice.  Dracula as the strong, silent type didn't impress me.  Also annoying were his bloodshot eyes.  Favorite scene:  When Alan Kent is stabbed in the back, hung upside down above Dracula's ash filled coffin and his neck slit open.  His poor wife Helen wanders into the cellar and discovers him hanging in this manner.

  Most fans and critics will probably disagree with me when I say that ""The Satanic Rites of Dracula"" is the more enjoyable.  Made in 1974, and set in modern London, this feature is more violent and bloodier than ""Dracula:  Prince of Darkness.""  Dracula plans on destroying the world with Black Death.  He will rule over a dead world and become the true Prince of Darkness.  Peter Cushing returns as Van Helsing whose daughter has been kidnapped by the vampire who wants her as his bride for all eternity.  This feature is more enjoyable than ""Dracula A.D. 72,"" which also starred Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing (the buxom Stephanie Beacham played Jessica).

  ""Dracula:  Prince of Darkness/The Satanic Rites of Dracula"" from Anchor Bay is loaded with numerous extras, especially for ""Dracula:  Prince of Darkness,"" which has audio commentary, a behind-the-scenes home movie, and a theatrical trailer for a double feature consisting of ""Dracula:  Prince of Darkness"" and ""Plague of the Zombies.""  Both discs contain a ""World of Hammer"" episode entitled ""Dracula and the Undead;"" this is an enjoyable feature which is hosted by Hammer icon, Oliver Reed.  This double feature is a must have for fans of Dracula, gothic horror, Christopher Lee, or Hammer films.",1213747200,3,2503,4.983050847457627
1957318,4,B0000W5H7E,"I had been seeking this OOP set for a long time. I am pleased to have found one from a third-party seller at a decent price. But I can see why this set was discontinued. The two films are obviously the earliest that Anchor Bay ever put on DVD. No time/track read-out, not anamorphic (still unknown obviously), slightly faded looking and rather damaged print used for ""Dracula, Prince of Darkness""; ""Satanic Rites..."" looks good, but who cares since it's such a poor film.  Accident-prone double-sided discs for both even though these discs don't have enough extras to be dual-layered single-sided!

Also, to anyone reading this: I got a factory-sealed copy on October 10, 2006. It has no inserts. Has anyone gotten one recently with no inserts? This is the only Anchor Bay DVD I have ever seen without them (they always have reproductions of the theatrical posters), and I'm trying to figure out whether it's a mistake in the packaging of my copy, or if AB ran out after a certain point while still pressing this short-lived set, and didn't bother to print any more. Comments from owners very much sought--especially if you remember *when* you got your copy!

1957319,4,B0000W5H7E,"Prince Of Darkness is technically the third Hammer Dracula film, the second being Brides Of Dracula.  This seems to play out a bit like a direct sequel to Horror Of Dracula considering the film begins with the finale of that film.  Ten years after Van Helsing put the kabash on Dracula, the community is still living in fear, so much in fact that it's now standard practice at funerals to pound a wooden stake through the corpse, bite marks or not.  Four sightseeing travellers come through Dracula's old stomping grounds and are warned to stay away from his castle, so naturally this is where they end up.  They're lured there by a Dracula disciple who plans to use them for both Dracula's resurrection and lunch.  After Drac comes back, and wipes out one of the couples, a deadly game of bat and mouse ensues as the remaining couple try to destroy Dracula with the help of a vampire killing priest.  Good stuff.  Lee once again turns in a heavy performance without uttering a word(but hissing and yelling once in a while).  Not as good as the first film and Van Helsing's presence is missed, but a very good Hammer flick nonetheless.

Satanic Rites is the last we'd ever see of Lee as Hammer's Dracula.  Folks are split on this one.  Dracula's still in early 70s London, but it's quite different from Dracula A.D. 1972.  No hippy kids, no Stoneground, no ""far outs"", ""groovies"", ""dig the music kids"" or running from the ""fuzz"".  It deals with Dracula(who apparently has been resurrected yet again, but we really don't know how this time) running a big operation that plans on manufacuring a virus that'll bring about a second Black Plague on the earth.  Apparently Dracula's tired of his existance and wants to go out with a bang.  Guess who's on board to stop him?  Van Helsing's back too, and he's gonna save the entire world by whippin' some vampire ass with the help of the police inspector from the previous film as well as his grandaughter(this time played by Joanna Lumley).  Satanic Rites has a bit more blood and breasts than the early films.  It isn't fantastic, but I certainly wouldn't say it's as bad as some try to make it out to be.  It's certainly better than alot of the vampire crap on the new release wall of your local video store, that's for sure.  And of course both Lee and Cushing excellent and keep it interesting.",1154217600,2,2341,4.595180722891566

8004025,3,B0000W5H7E,"Terence Fisher is rarely counted among the great horror auteurs, yet he certainly defines our ideal of contemporary horror far more than the ethereal Tod Browning, the old world Brit James Whale or the sublime Val Lewton stalwart Jacques Tourneur.  For many years, Fishers' Horror of Dracula (1958) was ranked by many critics and genre fans as the greatest horror film.

Dracula, Prince of Darkness (1966) is the finale of Fishers' vampire trilogy and is generally considered the weakest. While it lacks the imaginative touch of Brides of Dracula (1960), Prince is an underrated, worthy conclusion to the trilogy, vigorously characteristic of Fishers' penchant for fervent religious drama.

The film belongs primarily to Barbara Shelley, who was easily Hammer's best actress and, consequently, was repeatedly used by the studio; a rarity for a studio who tended towards a new glamor girl for each film.

Shelley is Helen; an ever constipated, repressed Victorian type on vacation with her husband and in-laws. The foursome meet Fr. Shandor; a charismatic and provocative monk at a local inn. Andrew Keir invests personality into his role of the priest, who warns the couples to stay clear of the castle. Fisher expertly builds tension in the first quarter of the film. Even though Dracula has been dead for a decade, the local villagers refuse to acknowledge his castle and still attempt to stake dead young maidens, hence Shandor's natural contempt for his flock.

Predictably, the couples wind up spending the night at castle Dracula, despite the warnings. Philip Latham's remarkably menacing Klove is Dracula's disciple, awaiting the opportunity to resurrect his master, which has now been given to him. Helen's husband, played with apt blandness by Charles Tingwell, will not heed his wife's impassioned pleas to leave. In typical Fisher fashion, the seemingly prim and proper heroine proves to be one who is right after all, by nature of her virtuous caution.  Helen falls victim to the recklessness of her husband and in-laws. The scene of Tingwell being sacrificed was, at the time, somewhat controversial and considered blasphemous. It is a highly effective scene, made more so by Helen's discovery of the deed. Helen recoils in sensuous horror on a evocatively lit stairwell as Dracula approaches.

Christopher Lee has claimed that he requested the removal of his dialogue, which makes little sense. Dracula is merely presented as a seductive, feeding animal, and speech was unnecessary.  The much discussed, wordless, hyper erotic scene in which Dracula slices his own chest for Farmer to feed on, is consistent with Fishers' vision for the character.  Fishers' development of that character in the first film, where Dracula said nothing more after his initial greeting to Jonathan Harker, gives way to a depiction of evil as both attractive and shallow. The transformed, voluptuous Helen joins her master and attempts to seduce her in-laws, played by Suzan Farmer and Frances Matthews, neither of whom can match her performance.

Regular Hammer character actor Thorley Walters plays an under-developed Renfield type named Ludwig, whom Walters still manages to give a charming personality.  The staking of Helen is nail-biting, exciting, dreadful, arousing, and unbearably tense. Metaphorically, the scene conveys the result of Victorian sexual repression and two-folded liberation.  Helen, once comfortable only in her caution, was stifled by pious mores. Due to her fun-loving brother in-law, she has lost the life she knew in exchange for brief, but hollow liberation. Once bitten, Helen insists, to her sister in-law, that the men are not needed. Yet, Helen also attempts to seduce the man who put her in this predicament to begin with. Even Helen's new master, Dracula, rejects her after she yearningly reaches for him. Helen attempts to bond with Farmer, but it is Dracula and the monks who put a stop to her. The staking is something akin to a gang rape by inquisition-like priests, and it is only in her final death that Helen is aglow in saintly peace and true liberation, which her previous two lives denied her. Helen's liberation from the pains of life is noticed and subtly celebrated by Fr. Shandor.

Klove is dispatched, but not by Fr. Shandor, who , in keeping his priestly vows, refuses to take a human life. Dracula's demise, on ice, is awash with religious symbolism (watery baptism). The build up is tense and kinetic, let down a bit by obviously limited budgetary restraints. Dracula, Prince of Darkness is the last Dracula Hammer with genuine style via Fisher's red-blooded type of poetic horror. The sequels became increasingly clumsy, repetitive and pale in comparison; meanwhile, Fisher found more of interest in the Frankenstein series and elsewhere.
