8508577,4,B0071POHGA,"This is one of those rape and revenge movies that's primarily for fans of the I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE films, and it's an independent shot on digital video movie. However, the atmosphere and scenery that those films contain aren't present here. Most of this film takes place indoors, and there isn't anything in the forest or anything like that. After a topless murder sequence in the beginning that has no gore, this film slows up. During the first half hour, there's some dialogue sequences that go on too long. The exploitation elements are certainly here, but the slow pacing in some parts may disappoint those looking for a non-stop blood and guts exploitation flick with constant nudity. In terms of the nudity and sexual content, there's a good amount overall. However, it doesn't contain any full frontal scenes and is limited to topless and rear scenes. Although it's a little slow getting started, fans of these types of films will probably like the 2 violent and bloody female crotch stabbing scenes that are the best violent sequences in the film. Other violent scenes have blood, but the films budget prevents any elaborate gore FX.  Most of the acting is better than what you would see in other extremely cheap independent films like this, and the main actress, Jill Evyn, is really good looking. Despite the problem with scenery, atmosphere, and those talky bits that may bore some, I thought the directing was pretty good. If you're looking for these violent rape and revenge flicks, you might like it. For fans of these types of films like myself, this was a good discovery. It has some faults but is a nice exploitation flick overall.

The quality is very good, and it comes with a commentary. It's a DVD-R and plays fine.",1499558400,,1736,4.764119601328904
8508578,3,B0071POHGA,"Okay, I bought this for its promised sleaze quotient. I had seen Marisa Merrill in Dead Season and Jill Evyn in Axe Giant. Both were nude in those films, and both are nude in this as well. So I got exactly what I was looking for, right? Except that this made Dead Season look like an Oscar winner. This is a very lame attempt at a rape/revenge thriller. Yes, there is plenty of violence, rape and female flesh on parade throughout (just because it's a woman stabbing another woman repeatedly in the crotch does not an edgy film make). The directing, acting, writing and production were all pretty bad. But if your looking for plenty of nudity and cheap thrills, then it's just good enough for 3 stars.",1424563200,,701,4.484375
8508579,4,B0071POHGA,"I (almost) find it humorous that I am referencing a Duran Duran song to describe this film. Why one might ask?  Well ""Girls on Film"" is an upbeat song, a great song in my humble opinion, but this movie is anything but upbeat. The movie basically is about a young woman named Amanda living in LA and is looking for her big break in the entertainment industry.  She spends her days auditioning for movies and/or modeling for photographers.  Amanda seems like she will ""do"" just about anything for her breakthrough. Meanwhile there are two guys who are setting up photo shoots with female models.  Then they get their kicks by accosting, raping and killing these women while they photograph it. It isn't long before Amanda crosses paths with the psychotic photographers. There actually is a bit more to the plot but this is the meat and potatoes.

As for the movie it is disturbing, graphic and raw, which isn't too surprising given the plot description. This movie in many ways (at least for me) had an ""I Spit on Your Grave"" vibe.  Notwithstanding, I see a difference between ISOYG and this film.  Where the former is about a rape and the revenge, the latter is an allegory or fable for what one will do for the price of fame. And that price could have some dire outcomes. Perhaps I am reading too much into it, but that is the way I viewed the movie.

As for the production of the movie, I felt it was very, very good.  It is a low budget film and while many folks hear the term ""low budget"" they feel that equates to schlock or crap.  In some cases that is true but not with ""PhotoGraphic"". However, if a person isn't familiar with lower budget film making and/or is expecting a mainstream film they might be disappointed.  The fact that this is a lower budget film allows the creators to really push the envelope. I also found the acting to be good too, I have seen much, much worse.  Given that some of the scenes were so extreme the performers worked well with what they were given.  As for the actress that played Amanda, I found her mesmerizing and believable. She also reminded me of someone, I still can't figure out if it is another actress or somebody that I have known personally. And not for nothing all the other actresses in this film are very pretty.

This movie was directed by Timothy Whitfield who also made ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Burlesque-Massacre/dp/B004LX0LG0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Burlesque Massacre</a>"". Under the assumption one hasn't seen ""Burlesque Massacre"", I would strongly recommend it if exploitation horror is your cup of tea.  Nevertheless, Whitfield and Timberwolf Entertainment bring the same integrity to ""PhotoGraphic"" that they did to ""Burlesque Massacre"".

In conclusion I really enjoyed this movie in spite that certain parts of this movie aren't easy to watch, regardless of some ""over the top"" moments.  There will be some people will hate this movie for what it portrays and I for one can totally respect that.  I for one found it different, engaging and like noted prior a ""what is it really worth"" type of fable.  So if a person wants a very dark, malefic, captivating and unconventional film watch this movie.",1344816000,6,3210,4.824817518248175
8508580,4,B0071POHGA,"Very violent horror revenge thriller about a group of photographers who capture, rape and kill actresses and models. Kind of like I Spit on Your Grave or Last House on  the Left but with a more modern look and feel.

The acting is quite good for a indie horror of this nature and it can be very emotional too. They were very good and it helped the seriousness and they performed the characters and events believably. However, it has a lot of violent sexual content which is not for everyone. Not over the top gory, but has a couple of very nasty kills and is very real and effective in tone. Not like most over the top indie horrors.

I liked it a lot and found it very powerful and gritty. But it is not by any means 'fun' and you have to like this kind of film to consider watching it.",1328918400,7,787,4.1644736842105265
