The plot of the widow of the Cleveland Indians owner, a former showgirl, attempting, through any means necessary, to move the team to Miami, is worthy of a John Grisham novel, albeit, comically. Scraping the bottom of the barrel to fill the team with,"" has-beens and never will be's"" is priceless comedy casting. This film is a baseball fan's most ""lovable losers"" type of movie, with lots of comedy, drama, and BASEBALL.",1510358400,,512,4.764044943820225
8751124,5,B01BQDS23Q,"Rachel Phelps, the new owner of the Cleveland Indians, wants to move the team to Miami. So, to help that out, she fills the team with has-beens and untried rookies, in the hopes of really souring Cleveland on the team. But, when the team finds out whats going on, they rally round to make this season the best one that Cleveland as ever seen!

I must say that this is my favorite baseball movie of them all! The cast makes a fun and interesting ensemble, with each member producing a memorable performance. The writing made great use of the characters  Ricky Wild Thing Vaughn, Willy Mays Hayes, Pedro Cerrano, Lou Brown, and so on. Yeah, its a great movie, with a lot of exciting baseball action, and some good comedic work. So, if you want a good guys night movie, then try out Major League. You won't be disappointed!",1467763200,2,820,4.496644295302014
