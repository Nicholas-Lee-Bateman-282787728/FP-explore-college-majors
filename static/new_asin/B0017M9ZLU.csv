3173874,5,B0017M9ZLU,"We have been waiting for this to appear on DVD!  We saw this in the theater and absolutely loved the movie: adventure, legends, mystery, relationships and the most amazing scenery.  It's a shame that this never made it into wide release.  A hidden gem within the movie is the story within a story told by amazing marionettes.  The artistry of these creations is incredible.  You might think that this would detract from the movie but it truly adds to it.  The locations are true (people don't walk from a beach location and next scene into a location hundreds of miles away) and the acting well done.  Suspenseful, but not scary, and nothing gratuitous.  A well done family movie (kids, teens and adults will all enjoy).  Please support these independent movie makers and purchase this dvd (we have no connections to this endeavor but sure enjoyed the movie).",1214092800,,859,4.789115646258503
3173875,5,B0017M9ZLU,This family friendly adventure is what the world needs more of.  Vivid characters in and around coastal Oregon. Superbly acted and directed.  Suspense wonderful yet not threatening to youngsters.  Tweens and Teenagers will get a kick out of young beautiful actresses and actors.  And I hear it is based on a true treasure.

3173876,5,B0017M9ZLU,"We just love this movie! FIVE STARS! The producers of The Legend of Tillamook Gold got together, they made a movie that has more than a great story line!  It has Action, Mystery,& Adventure! Scenic locations and interesting people. The characters have depth. What I liked best about this movie is it entertained my children and their friends, regardless of age!",1210291200,,361,4.918032786885246
3173877,5,B0017M9ZLU,"Excellent, I saw it with my kids and we were part of every minute of this fast-pace adventure. Julie is a hero, not only for finding the treasure against all odds, yet also for fixing all the family troubles after all. Great acting in all the supporting parts as well. I'm thankful that there are still movies out there that can make you feel good and promote family values. An interesting combination of independent film making and ""money on screen"", the cave showdown is just phenomenal! A perfect Holiday Movie for the upcoming season. Take your kids and see it, I checked the website, it seems the movie is traveling the festival cycle quite a bit these days. Hope the DVD is out soon, too. RJ",1210291200,2,697,4.5396825396825395

I'm no prude but I applaud any film that doesn't feel the need to include profanity, nudity and violence.

The extra 50+ minutes was used to waste time in watching the heroin hiking around the hills and sleeping out of doors which made the movie really slow. The ending was fulfilling because the whole goal of the movie was to find the treasure. Found but not recovered? That's lame. Shades of the Goonies. Others have said the acting was stiff, which is true - but each line was read like it was from someone unwilling to say it.",1443398400,,512,4.288659793814433

3174024,5,B0017M9ZLU,"All I can say is that if you like good stories set in a beautiful part of Oregon, with just the right desolation and comfort in the scenery, and a chance to see what local talent looks like, this is a good movie to watch on a rainy Sunday night, preferably with a full moon.  If you're going to see a movie with a young person, watch this beforehand and see what you think.  What I think is a very well deserved five gold stars.

At the end of The Legend of Tillamook Gold, and it really holds true of most good movies, you can ask yourself, Do I feel better than before I saw it? You have my answer.  In the interest of full disclosure, I am not aware of any personal connection with this movie, other than we are both set in Oregon, land that I love and where I wisely choose to live.  If you're curious and don't know the state, you'll learn a lot while enjoying a good whale's tale.  Music was right for the moods of the movie.

3174058,1,B0017M9ZLU,"Retarded! Typical Hollywood wanting to make people joyous for being poor and standing in the EBT line. They glorify a mindset of lack and poverty. Every movie about gold you see. It's always like ' throw the gold away and let's dance in our rags'. I'm very spiritual. Spirituality and poorness have nothing to do with each other. You'd think that Gods and Goddesses would want her to help her family get ahead so her dad could relax, finish his book and no longer be in debt living in his brother's house off his money. Hollywood wants joy for the 3% in the world and the other 97% work at Taco Bell and McDonald's. And if they're really lucky be button pushers. I don't know anyone who relishes being poor, on welfare but I'm sure the 3% want to push that line.  Peace!",1386460800,2,770,4.384615384615385

I don't know too many people who would go into a storm drain unless they were really in need of money to get the gold. Which no one even tried to grab as it was tumbling out of the hole.

3174071,5,B0017M9ZLU,"There were so many great detailed reviews that I thought I would stick to what impressed me most.
- For a B class movie the acting was great, and the movie very well put together.  I loved the intro where the items shown actually apply to the person they introduce (ie clothes hanger for the costumes person).
- The intro and theme music by Peter Buffet and ""Looking Wolf"" Reibach was haunting and really set the mood.  You even get to see ""Looking Wolf"" playing a cameo with Standing Elk in a beach scene.  I loved how each ""major"" player seemed to have their own theme music (The girl - a slight variation of the theme, and the dumb sounding music for Billy and her boyfriend).  A pity there was no music cd available.
- The movie was very spiritual which no one else seemed to mention in any of the reviews.  From the beginning when the girl finds the coin on the beach till the spirit of the freed slave saves her dad in the ocean, the movie is full of ghosts, whispers, visions, and dreams with a heavy American Indian twist.  I really, really enjoyed how this moved the girl to find the treasure and eventually herself.
""The Legend of Tillamook's Gold,"" is a fantastic family movie  and I highly recommend it for anyone that likes uplifting, family oriented movies.",1330560000,,1271,4.452586206896552

3174077,5,B0017M9ZLU,"Taking place in Tillamook, Oregon, its the story of a troubled family
and the distraction a young girl finds in the local legend of Spanish
treasure. With a bunch of actors I recognize from other projects (ie
the mother also has a significant role in Romy and Michelle's High
School Reunion with Lisa Kudrow), it had pretty impressive star power
for a low-budget indie. I had the pleasure of meeting the cast and
makers of this film at a family film festival I went to with my parents
and little brother. I was able to get a copy of their film after and
watched it with my little brother-- it was actually really excellent!
Not too many ""family"" movies interest him as he's 11 and thinks he's
too mature for kid stuff, but we had a really nice time together. I
would highly recommend this for anyone to watch.",1216166400,5,809,4.436241610738255

We saw this in the theater and absolutely loved the movie: adventure, legends, mystery, relationships and the most amazing scenery.  It's a shame that this never made it into wide release.  A hidden gem within the movie is the story within a story told by amazing marionettes.  The artistry of these creations is incredible.  You might think that this would detract from the movie but it truly adds to it.  The locations are true (people don't walk from a beach location and next scene into a location hundreds of miles away) and the acting well done.  Suspenseful, but not scary, and nothing gratuitous.  A well done family movie (kids, teens and adults will all enjoy).

If you're going to see a movie with a young person, watch this beforehand and see what you think.  What I think is a very well deserved five gold stars.

At the end of The Legend of Tillamook Gold, and it really holds true of most good movies, you can ask yourself, Do I feel better than before I saw it? You have my answer.  In the interest of full disclosure, I am not aware of any personal connection with this movie, other than we are both set in Oregon, land that I love and where I wisely choose to live.  If you're curious and don't know the state, you'll learn a lot while enjoying a good whale's tale.  Music was right for the moods of the movie.  Well worth owning, and I'll buy at least one copy for a gift.",1402876800,4,994,4.040816326530612

3408555,1,B0017M9ZLU,"Retarded! Typical Hollywood wanting to make people joyous for being poor and standing in the EBT line. They glorify a mindset of lack and poverty. Every movie about gold you see. It's always like ' throw the gold away and let's dance in our rags'. I'm very spiritual. Spirituality and poorness have nothing to do with each other. You'd think that Gods and Goddesses would want her to help her family get ahead so her dad could relax, finish his book and no longer be in debt living in his brother's house off his money. Hollywood wants joy for the 3% in the world and the other 97% work at Taco Bell and McDonald's. And if they're really lucky be button pushers. I don't know anyone who relishes being poor, on welfare but I'm sure the 3% want to push that line.  Peace!",1386460800,2,770,4.384615384615385

I don't know too many people who would go into a storm drain unless they were really in need of money to get the gold. Which no one even tried to grab as it was tumbling out of the hole.
A one time see it movie that hangs on your mind for several days wondering about bits and pieces of it. And that is not a bad thing either. After all, you did return to finish the book!!!",1366761600,,635,3.9302325581395348

3408568,5,B0017M9ZLU,"There were so many great detailed reviews that I thought I would stick to what impressed me most.
- For a B class movie the acting was great, and the movie very well put together.  I loved the intro where the items shown actually apply to the person they introduce (ie clothes hanger for the costumes person).
- The intro and theme music by Peter Buffet and ""Looking Wolf"" Reibach was haunting and really set the mood.  You even get to see ""Looking Wolf"" playing a cameo with Standing Elk in a beach scene.  I loved how each ""major"" player seemed to have their own theme music (The girl - a slight variation of the theme, and the dumb sounding music for Billy and her boyfriend).  A pity there was no music cd available.
- The movie was very spiritual which no one else seemed to mention in any of the reviews.  From the beginning when the girl finds the coin on the beach till the spirit of the freed slave saves her dad in the ocean, the movie is full of ghosts, whispers, visions, and dreams with a heavy American Indian twist.  I really, really enjoyed how this moved the girl to find the treasure and eventually herself.
""The Legend of Tillamook's Gold,"" is a fantastic family movie  and I highly recommend it for anyone that likes uplifting, family oriented movies.",1330560000,,1271,4.452586206896552

3408574,5,B0017M9ZLU,"Taking place in Tillamook, Oregon, its the story of a troubled family
and the distraction a young girl finds in the local legend of Spanish
treasure. With a bunch of actors I recognize from other projects (ie
the mother also has a significant role in Romy and Michelle's High
School Reunion with Lisa Kudrow), it had pretty impressive star power
for a low-budget indie. I had the pleasure of meeting the cast and
makers of this film at a family film festival I went to with my parents
and little brother. I was able to get a copy of their film after and
watched it with my little brother-- it was actually really excellent!
Not too many ""family"" movies interest him as he's 11 and thinks he's
too mature for kid stuff, but we had a really nice time together. I
would highly recommend this for anyone to watch.",1216166400,5,809,4.436241610738255
8266596,1,B0017M9ZLU,"A TV movie that's nearly two hours long that gives the appearance of a family movie, but it was dreadful and has nothing to learn for a family.  This 2006 movie felt like it was made in the 1980s.  The humor is slap stick silly as two idiots hit and stab each other while digging for gold.  The acting is bad overall as there are many moments of exaggeration.  The directorial work was amateurish as everything was dragged out and slow.  Terrible script about a dumb girl who do dumb things.  Only nice thing in the story is that it included a native American Indian in it, but everything else is such a waste of time.

The Indian legend in this town is that there is a box of gold that was left here by Spaniard pirates who killed a slave and they buried his body along with the treasure.  Throughout the movie, the spirit or the soul of this slave appears as an elk to this young girl (who is supposedly 14, but looks like 18-20) and he's looking for ""freedom.""  Often a soul is looking for freedom means he/she wants to get a proper burial.  Well, this young girl of all days decides to go find the gold in a cave that the stream runs through during a rain storm.  How dumb is that?  She couldn't wait another day?  Her mother tells her not to go, but she goes anyway.  She then gets stuck in the cave and pulled along the stream almost drowning.  The father goes look for her and when he finds her, he runs into the slave's skeleton remains and knocks it into the stream where he and the remains get swept down the stream into a waterfall that drains out of a mountain into the ocean.  Then they show the spirit of the slave screaming out ""freedom.""  They just washed him in pieces into the ocean without a proper burial.  What kind of a ""freedom"" is that?  The father fell hundreds of feet off the mountain and into the ocean, but the father remains alive and no injuries?  Really?  The impact of water from hundreds of feet above is nearly the same as solid ground due to gravity and speed.  If his bones were not crushed, he would have gone unconscious and drown to death.

No kids should be watching this movie for the kinds of behavior they display in it, and the consequences are misleading.  The family is a complete dysfunction as they are constantly arguing and fighting, and everyone hates everyone.  We don't need to see that as we already face that in real life.  There is nothing inspiring about this movie.  The script would have been so much better if it was a love story between the young girl and the young man who likes her.  They offered only a minute of their relationship at the very end.  Waste.",1524096000,,2621,4.313524590163935

I really like Brian McNamara, he's been in a few of these family friendly films and always does a good job.  I'm adding a spoiler alert here...read at your own risk...but if you are like me...a little spoiler makes it more interesting....Overall an easy going film that was fun to watch and safe for the whole family.  I was a little disappointed by the ending- that they didn't get to keep the treasure- but I agree that the treasure the family did get- of getting along better and discovering love and the meaning of family was more important.",1490745600,2,791,4.542253521126761
