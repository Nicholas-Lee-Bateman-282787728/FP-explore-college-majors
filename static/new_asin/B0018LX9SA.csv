3417675,3,B0018LX9SA,"Contains Spoilers;

'Trapped Ashes' is a 'horror' anthology with each episode cut by a different director. There's an awful lot of sex on show, but not much original, inventive horror, and the main reason for this is a limp and gawky script by the otherwise fabulously named Dennis Bartok.

You know Ken Russell's segment isn't going to be out and out gore, but a glance at his back-catalogue reveals the guy's no stranger to extreme imagery, and as you'd expect, his piece is the most successful.
'The Girl With The Gold Breasts' makes the most of a weak conceit, and it's to Russell's great credit that he turns such an uneventful story into something so watch-able;
A wannabe Hollywood actress, undergoing a routine cosmetic procedure, receives vampire breasts. When she complains, we get to see Russell and two other old guys, dressed in very disturbing drag, eventually revealing they have splendid vampire breasts as well!
That's it. It's funny, quite bizarre, and you're left scratching your head a bit afterwards.
'TGWTGB' shows Russell's imagination is as warped and impish as ever, and an interview on the 'special features' reveals him to be cheerfully demented.

The other three films are no-where near as solid. Sean S. Cunningham's is a kind of live-action/Manga hybrid set around a Buddhist temple with plenty of sex as you'd expect, but not much chills.
Monte Hellman's piece seems to be a thesis on why Kubrick left for Europe in the 60's; his girlfriend was a witch apparently.
The final story by John Gaeta, an fx man, about a goth's relationship with the tape-worm she was forced to share her mother's belly with, has at least the embryo (apologgys droogies) of a good idea, but the climax is so obvious it falls straight off the screen.

Joe Dante does the linking story, and apart from a customary cameo by Dick Miller, it goes absolutely nowhere.
The 'twist' is the kind of post-modern nonsense that gets contributed to druggie art-school rag-mags. I'm all for wracking my brain if there's payola at the crunch, but it just doesn't happen. It's no help that the acting is so sluggish and one-dimensional either, you don't care if anyone dies or not.

Unfortunately, apart from Russell, it's all a bit of a slider. Needs a much more subversive and troubled writer to get the best out of these guys.
3 stars for Lionsgate giving Ken Russell work and putting the British Film Industry to shame, but it's a generous 3.",1217116800,8,2437,4.820574162679426
3417676,1,B0018LX9SA,"One of the saddest things in the world to witness for a film buff is when a hero in the business spirals down. When you see a famous director take on a project that turns out to be abysmal at best. When you see someone who once was the belle of the ball turn out to be the bag lady. Such is the case with TRAPPED ASHES.

The movie tells the story of a lowly tour guide (Henry Gibson) for an old movie studio that doesn't seem to produce much of anything these days. Several visitors who have received free passes board the bus and their on their way. They stop to look at a spooky old house on the hill, once used in the productions of a horror film director. Of course the group wants to get out and take a look around even when advised against it by the guide.

While walking around the building, they all end up trapped in a dining area. It is there that Gibson remarks that their predicament is much like that of the director's most notorious film where he had dinner guests trapped until each of them told their scariest personal experience. Thinking that perhaps this might work, each offers their tales.

The first story is ""The Girl With The Golden Breasts"" and is told by aspiring actress Phoebe (Rachel Veltn). With little success in her career, Phoebe opted for that one item that makes an actress a success: big boobs! But these aren't normal boobs. No, these are special implants using a new technique of implanting the tissue of dead person's breasts. Later on it turns out that *SPOILER* these breasts form mouths and draw nourishment from Phoebe's lovers. Next!

""Jibaku"" is an animated tale from Japan. It tells the story of a couple that moves to Japan when the husband lands a job there. His wife is enchanted by a picture she sees in a gallery that leads to her dream seduction by and evil creature. She is drawn into his netherworld and saved only by the love of her husband.  Next!

""Stanley's Girlfriend"" tells the tale of Leo (John Saxon) a screenwriter in his youth who meets and befriends another interesting and intelligent young man. The two of them become best buds and it is only with the introduction of Nina that there time together becomes limited. When Stanley leaves for a while, Leo is seduced by Nina. It is only later that he discovers her true nature.

FINALLY we have ""My Twin - The Worm"" wherein we hear of how a young woman's mother had a tape worm at the same time she was pregnant with our young lass. Referring to the worm as her ""twin"" we see just how big and destructive a tape worm can be.

The film ends with *SPOILER* the revelation that each of these people are now dead and sitting out their time telling tales before moving on, a plot device used in the classic TALES FROM THE CRYPT film from 1972. It works as a plot device but the rest of the film reeks.

Most amazing is the results from the talent involved. The wraparound segments are directed by Joe Dante (GREMLINS, THE HOWLING) and are probably the best of the bunch. The first segment is directed by Ken Russell, the same man who brought us THE DEVILS, TOMMY and ALTERED STATES. Yes! THAT Ken Russell! Who now appears in drag in this film!

The second segment was directed by Sean Cunningham who gave us the first FRIDAY THE 13TH and DEEP STAR SIX. Okay so he's not made the best stuff in the world but for someone who started the legend of Jason he does this?

The third segment is directed by Monte Hellman who did TWO LANE BLACKTOP and THE SHOOTING. While critically acclaimed and possessed of a cult following, this movie does nothing to advance his career.

Lastly we have John Gaeta in his directorial debut for the last segment. It looks good but that better be the case as Mr. Gaeta has done special effects for films like ERASER, THE MATRIX (all three) and most recently SPEED RACER. Let's hope he chooses a better project next time.

Of the actors involved here, John Saxon is the only one who comes off unscathed. Saxon has been a fantastic actor in some high brow films like THE APPALOSA and JOE KIDD as well as in cult classics like NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET and ENTER THE DRAGON. His performances have always been steady and believable. He does well in doing the same for this film.

For some reason Hollywood seems to believe that if you take a group of talented directors and put them together you will come up with a masterpiece. This was the idea behind the series MASTERS OF HORROR and that show proved that it's not always the directors of horror films past that make the best new ones. This movie is proof of that.

You'd be better off watching nearly anything from the MASTERS series than this one. It's truly terrible. I don't get it. I've been writing reviews for some time now and it seems that the past three I've written about have been ones advising people to distance themselves from these titles. All I can say is that when a bad movie comes along, it's always going to be a bad movie. Let's just hope that we get the opportunity to watch better ones and that they are being made.",1217030400,4,5020,4.411891891891892
3417677,2,B0018LX9SA,"I took a chance and rented this one. I figured that with 4 individual short films in this thing, at least 1 or 2 of them would be scary. Was I wrong! 4 short films and nothing scary about any of them. I should have known. After all, when was the last time you saw anything good with John Saxon or Henry Gibson in it? Well, don't expect much from this one either. At least not as far as good scary horror moments go.

However, if you're looking for lots of nudity, this is definitely worth a look. I think there were topless women in just about every one of the short stories. The puzzler though is: when did directors start thinking that topless women make for a good scary movie? Entertaining to watch, maybe. But scary? I don't think so.

Save your time. Save your money. Check out something else instead of this lemon. I'm sorry I wasted MY time, that's for sure!",1216684800,4,866,4.274390243902439
3417678,3,B0018LX9SA,"Trapped Ashes has its moments, but I certainly wouldn't put it in the same league as ""Tales from the Crypt"" or ""Kwaidan"".  We have 5 directors involved with this and each has their own segment.  Joe Dante does the ""wrap-around"" story, which is that of a bunch of tourists who are on a VIP tour of a strangely deserted studio, and become trapped in an old spooky house with the tour guide, Henry Gibson.

The first tale is done by Ken Russell, and it's of a young woman who has decided to get breast enhancements with rather disturbing results.  The second is done by Sean Cunningham, and it's of a couple who are on business in Japan when the woman becomes possessed by the spirit of a dead monk and is drawn into Buddhist hell.  The third tale is by Monte Hellman (who is known for his horror efforts?  I think not...), and it's that of a man who thinks he's got it made when his best friend leaves for Europe and leaves him alone to bed his girlfriend...only to find that she's not quite what he thinks she is and his friend has pretty much fled for his life...this segment features John Saxon.  The last tale is that of a girl who grew up in the womb with a tapeworm, and it's rather strange but not terribly scary..this by first time director John Gaeta, who is best known for his special visual effects on the Matrix, etc.

Not a bad little effort, kind of fun but not particularly scary.  I liked the Russell & Cunningham efforts the best, but as I said, this is in no way in the same league as some of the horror anthologies of the 60's and 70's.

Tits episode is the best; although the Stanley story is on paper better.
I can recommend it to watch if you want to waste some time and looking for an easy horror but don't want to get bad nightmares. These short movies are relatively safe from that aspect.

3417685,1,B0018LX9SA,"Last night we watched a film on Amazon Prime called 'Trapped Ashes'. It's a 2006 low budget movie that tries to be like some of the past anthology horror films like 'Tales from the Crypt' (1972) or 'The House that Dripped Blood' (1971). There is a main story that ties together stories about the different Characters. In this case they are on a movie studio back lot tour. The tour guide is a rather strange man played by Henry Gibson of 'Laugh-in' fame. John Saxon is also in the cast, I'm guessing to make a quick buck. The stories in this are laughably bad at trying to be erotic tales of horror. There is plenty of nudity and sex, not much horror. The silliest story of the bunch is one about a woman that gets breast implants from a very unusual doctor who uses tissue from cadavers. Turns at that the recipients of these transplants become sort of vampires whose boobs have little mouths on them for attacking their victims and sucking their blood. Another story involves a woman who had to share her place in her mother's womb with a tape worm. They somehow become...friends after that and she refers to the worm as her ""twin"". It's hard to explain and not really worth it. Bottom line, avoid this film except maybe as a curiosity piece. I give it 1 out of 5 stars.",1384819200,,1272,4.417021276595745

3417689,4,B0018LX9SA,"It's true, this movie isn't even remotely scary... and I don't think it had any such intentions (though the story with the worm is quite weird and creepy). It's very much like those Tales From The Crypt stories that revel in black humor and grotesque visuals. All these stories have monsters in them and, except for one of them, the monsters are pretty monsterous.
Like many horror anthologies these stories go for a twist... though the twists come late in the show.
The worst bit was the third story, Stanley's Girlfriend, and only because it's kind of dull and predictable compared to the others... and doesn't have a ugly monster either.

The acting was pretty good for this sort of thing... I particularly liked seeing Henry Gibson as the sinister guide.

3417690,3,B0018LX9SA,"Trapped Ashes (Sean S. Cunningham et al., 2006)

Homage to eighties horror anthologies  by way of Aria (not surprising given that Ken Russell shows up) that sometimes works, sometimes doesn't. The framing story, directed by Gremlins' Joe Dante, gives us a number of people on a VIP tour of a Hollywood studio lot, conducted by a friendly, if slightly absentminded, tour guide (The Blues Brothers' Henry Gibson). He points out the lot's supposedly-cursed haunted house set, and the tourists clamor to go in; they soon find themselves trapped and, echoing the set's most famous film, are forced to tell their most personal, horrifying stories to escape. Which leads us into the tales...

Ken Russell opens the bidding with ""The Girl with Golden Breasts"". A would-be starlet (Pray for Morning's Rachel Veltri) decides her charms need an upgrade, so she consults a doctor who presents her with, quite possibly the most ridiculous idea ever committed to film: implants made of dead human tissue. You can see where this would go bad... but it goes even worse than that (and I'm not just talking about this segment's idiotically low-budget special effects). The upside: it only gets better from here.

Next comes Jibaku, from Sean S. Cunningham, director of the original Friday the 13th. Henry (Queer as Folk's Scott Lowell) and Julia (The Fisher King's Lara Harris) are on vacation in Japan, trying to patch up their marriage, except Henry keeps getting called away to business meetings, leaving Lara to experience the culture by herself--until she meets handsome, enigmatic Seishin (When the Last Sword Is Drawn's Yoshinori Hiruma), who she eventually winds up in bed with. This turns out to be a bad idea, given that Seishin is a ghost and draws her into a Buddhist hell from which Henry, with the help of the head monk (Takashi Miike regular Ryo Ishibashi) at the temple where Seishin was living when he committed suicide, must rescue her. Not bad, though not great.

""Stanley's Girlfriend"", directed by Two-Lane Blacktop veteran Monte Hellman, is by far the best of the bunch. Narrated by Enter the Dragon's John Saxon, it tells the story of Leo, a frustrated screenwriter in golden-age Hollywood (Saxon plays him as an old man; Riverworld's Tahmoh Penikett plays him in his prime) who befriends oddball director Stanley (Snakes on a Plane's Tygh Runyan). All is well until Stanley acquires himself a girlfriend, Nina (Species III's Amelia Cooke). We all know that the first blush of a romance can be all-consuming, but Nina and Stanley take it to ridiculous levels, to the point where Stanley basically falls off the grid, and only Leo knows he's even still alive...until he gets a call from a New York producer. He flies out to make the movie, leaving Stanley alone with Nina... and you know what happens next. What you might not be prepared for is why.

The final story, ""My Twin, the Worm"", was the first (and, to date, last) directorial effort from visual effects guy John Gaeta, who works extensively with the Wachowski Brothers. It shows; this is the weakest of the stories, mostly because it's damn close to incomprehensible.

I wanted to like this a great deal more than I did, and it's worth seeing for the Monte Hellman short (though I'd suggest checking out one or two of Hellman's features to see if his slow-burn thriller technique works for you before diving in here), and less so for the Cunningham and Dante bits (the latter of which features an older, burnt-out Jayce Bartok from Spider-Man; his brother Dennis wrote and produced the film). ** ",1360195200,,3560,4.911813643926789
3417691,4,B0018LX9SA,"Okay, you might cut it off, but there are some catchy segments in this horror movie/almost cliche'/anthology. I really enjoyed the first segment by Ken Russell. Funny, gory, sexy all rolled into one, or two. The second segment by Sean Cunningham is pretty eerie, if not exactly terrifying and has an eye-catching bit of morphing art/manga/animation. It was interesting. Monte Hellman's, Stanley's Girlfriend did nothing for me. waaa-wa. The last segment, by John Gaeta, was a nifty twist on twin-ship, which I liked. The framing story done by Joe Dante was cliched and silly but it did provide bookends for the anthology.

Overall, the comic qualities of the first story and the art of the second one make this a multi-watch keeper. This movie also has enough sex and gore to keep one on his or her toes during a lonely winter's night.",1321747200,,835,4.839160839160839

3417693,5,B0018LX9SA,"If you're a fan of cinematic horror anthologies in the spirit of ""Cat's Eye,"" ""Trilogy of Terror"" and ""Asylum,"" to name a few of the better crafted examples of this subgenre, you won't be disappointed by ""Trapped Ashes.""

To start, the title of the film itself evokes haunting memories of ""Burnt Offerings,"" so - gentle viewer - it should come as no spoiler to you that the four ""guests"" (including couples) compelled to tell the stories of their ""WORST TRUE LIFE NIGTMARE"" in order to escape from a Hollywood set-piece haunted house, as ""hosted"" by the always quirky but oddly avuncular ""tour leader"" Henry Gibson (best remembered for his memorable performance in Robert Altman's ""Nashville""), well ... suffice to say that they are NOT going to be able to successfully ""sing for their salvation"" under ANY circumstances.  They're doomed from the moment they set foot in the old Norman-Bates-like ""hotel.""  In fact, they were doomed BEFORE they entered.  But why?  Clue:  There is a karmic, cyclical element inherent in their collective damnation.  But!  No spoilers here, fans.  Just watch!  Carefully.

Each of the guests, to put it mildly, gives ""bizarre"" a whole new semantic, as evidenced by their ""believe it or not"" tales of ultra-steamy demonic sex, parasitic mammary implants, embryonic, alienated [and ""twisted""] twin sisters, and true friendship sabotaged by nothing less than a modern-day succubus.  What fun!

I was delighted to see directorial efforts from the always-over-the-top likes of veteran genius Ken Russell; steady-state solid work from the indelibly dependable horror maven Joe Dante; and most surprisingly of all (at least for this reviewer), I found director Sean Cunningham's exploration (and exploitation) of ""unconventional Oriental eroticism"" to be the MOST fascinating and original of all five of the vignettes (the ""wrap around"" story included), a story so unique and so stimulating (in more ways than one), that you've never seen it before but you will WANT to see MORE of this ""labor-of-love (and lust)"" style of late-nite tale telling.  ""Jibaku"" (which is Japanese for [loosely translated], ""I sacrifice my own mortal life for you so that you will have to sacrifice, in turn, YOUR mortal life for me [with the implication being:  Because it's the ONLY way we're going to be able to be together until the end of time!]"") is - at worst - a selfish love story with a horrific twist; at best, it's a poignant tale of two terminally lonely people who ""come together"" (under extremely tenebrous circumstances), a respectably attractive American lady on vacation (with her less than sexually-fulfilling husband) and a handsome young Japanese ""monk"" tormented by the insanity-inducing life of a monastery, where eroticism of ANY kind is strictly verboten.  I actually cried when I watched this particular vignette from the immensely talented Cunningham (a revelation considering he came from ""Friday the 13th"" roots), such was its overpowering haunting effects upon me.  Kudos all around then, but especially to Sean Cunningham for his amazingly, global-minded exploration of ""the inhuman condition,"" no matter where in the world one happens to find themselves.

Without dragging this review out beyond the attention span of ANY potential viewer, just RENT (or buy) ""Trapped Ashes"" for a stormy night's satisfying fulfillment of lust, bent love, greed, terror, suspence, a bit of the old ""gross out,"" but principally - five excellent pieces of macabre fiction suited for those who just can't get enough of this kind of anthologized mesmerism.  Catch ""Trapped Ashes"" if you can.  It won't give you nightmares fortunately (nobody wants those), but it will make you smile ... crookedly, and leave you guessing as to the fate (and its raison d'etre) of the ill-fated ""tour go(n)ers.""

Kudos to Henry Gibson as well, for acting as the ""little bit too innocent looking"" old man, leading the guests through a a house and a night they'll never forget, nor ever seem to remember either, as they repeat it over and over and over again.  But wait!  Have I said too much already?

Stop me now before *I* become the next victim of a 6th vignette, and the FIFTH guest gory-story weaver in ""Trapped Ashes.""  Just See It, dear fans!  Enough said.",1226361600,4,4258,5.099423631123919

Russell's rendition of ""The Girl with the Golden Breasts"" best captures (and lampoons) the phallic-female imagery that runs through the stories in its most over-the-top form: his own appearance makes this segment positively Fellini-esque. ""Stanley's Girlfriend"" and ""Jibaku"" are stories with interesting, original premises, carefully drawn characters, and rich atmospheres that all get a bit lost in grindhouse climaxes as two distinct horror styles--mood and gore--butt heads. The wraparound is in a third mode altogether, making this anthology a truly postmodern, unusual experience.

3417695,2,B0018LX9SA,"If you liked ""Tales from the Crypt,"" you might find this godchild of the TV series passable, although its collection of tales is even more garish and gratuitously cruel than most of the ""Crypt"" episodes. There is a lot of female mutilation going on here. In fact the different narratives just seem to provide an excuse for showing the graphic mortifications. The storylines, such as they are, all end in hooks on which to hang the titillating, torturous visuals.

A couple of the narratives do show some promise at their starts. The Goth girl's account has the interesting premise of her having been nurtured in the womb with a strange companion. And one of the married couple's accounts takes place against a backdrop of some very compelling scenery of Japan. However, like their two companion pieces, these tales also soon spiral off into unlikely rendings of the flesh.

The stories, in short, make little sense, even as surrealism. And the epilogues that Henry Gibson's character provides for each of them just skews the tales that much further into gross implausibility. It all ends up being as illogical and visually ungrammatical as the movie's title.

To make the point even more plainly - there certainly is a lot to offend feminist sensibility here. All the featured women are cast solely to engage in or to suffer some bizarre sexual onslaughts. The stories therefore are not so much scary as they are scarification. And they are disturbing just because they make one wonder and worry over what sorts of minds are loose out there that enjoy writing and producing such imaginings.

That's why I almost skipped the Directors/Actors' commentary on the DVD. I was afraid this would just be another frat house descent into semi-sadistic girlfriend bashing. However, the commentary actually turned out to be a pleasant surprise and the best part of the DVD.

The different actors and directors of each segment rotate into the discussion to talk a little about their experiences making the film. It turns into a convivial open-house whose guests have some entertaining insights to offer - about scouting locations, about the histories of both the new and the veteran actors who star, about the family feeling that developed during the making of the film. There is perhaps a little too much wishful thinking that goes on here, as parallels are drawn with Stanley Kubrick's work. Also, very little about the different plots gets elucidated. Nevertheless, the camaraderie of the commentary is appealing.

So there is a reason to check this film out after all. With every other DVD that has included a Director's Commentary, the obvious advice has been to skip the commentary if you don't have time to view everything on the DVD. However this DVD is the one exception I've found to that rule-of-thumb. I suggest the average viewer might do well to skip watching the movie straight, and just click immediately to the Directors' voice-overs. Since the plots don't make sense anyway, you won't be missing much there. But you'll get to see what counts, and you'll get in on some more benignly encouraging happy talk.",1218931200,,3112,4.940726577437858

It takes the horror anthology film structure, and the notion of different storytellers, to tell some very insanely creepy stories.  The difference in styles/tones is perfect and refreshing because each ghastly tale is told by someone different: different sexes, different ages.

The set up and wrap-around directed by Joe Dante is simplicity itself: a group of strangers are doing a VIP tour of a studio back lot hosted by the lovingly creepy Henry Gibson. They find themselves trapped in a much too real movie set where the only way out (or is it?) is by telling scary stories; but these are tales with a terrible twist: they have to be real.

Genre bending master Ken Russell is at his - um, [...] - in a tale about monstrous mammary enhancement called ""The Girl with the Golden [...]"". Watch for a horrifying cameo by Ken himself in a bad wig and badder lipstick.

Sean S. Cunningham directs ""Jibaku"", a bit of demented Japanese horror concerned with gory sex and eternal damnation.

The great Jon Saxon stars in ""Stanley's Girlfriend"" directed by Monte Hellman about a filmmaker named ""Stanley"" who looks an awful lot like the guy who made FEAR AND DESIRE. It's a very classy segment about being careful what you wish for, peppered with a bit of witchcraft.

First time director John Gaeta, who did the FX for films like THE MATRIX, helms ""My Twin, the Worm"" about a mother-to-be and an unhuman baby that literally drives her mad.

A bottle of full-bodied extras holds deleted scenes, filmmakers and cast commentary tracks, director's cuts of Hellman's and Russell's segments, and fun ""making of"" featurettes of all the episodes with the talent and the directors.

TRAPPED ASHES is a cool and scary ride well worth the ticket price.

Dante's wrap around is charming with an ever increasing arc of revelation (hint: all is not what it seems), Russel's story manages to be utterly insane, hilarious and will leave you with images in your head that, I can almost guarantee you, you will NEVER EVER FORGET. Cunningham's (the man who brought you FRIDAY the 13th) story is both erotic and unsettlingly creepy (no axes, but get a load of the sex scene) and John (THE MATRIX) Gaeda's entry aims for and scores on the eerie/queasy bullseye. My fave ep was more cerebral and emotionally haunting. It's directed by vet Monte Hellman, who did the all time classic TWO LANE BLACK TOP, plus some cool Corman westerns with Jack Nicholson back in the day. Hellman's story uses Stanley Kubrick as a character and is not to be missed for cinephiles. It also features BATTLESTAR GALACTICA's Tahmoh Penikett as a younger version of a character also played by horror vet John Saxon (NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET).

This is not a masked-slasher-popping-out-of-closet movie or a possessed-kid-vomiting-clotted-blood freak out. In a way, it more true to horror's roots in the strange and the uncanny. TRAPPED ASHES is an odd and unsettling series of vignettes that have the aura of tales told round the campfire (""Did I ever tell you the story about the twin and the worm? No? Come closer to the fire then, and I will tell you""). It creeps rather than pounces, haunts rather than shocks (save for Ken Russell's semi-camp lunatic rampage).

Ultimately, this has something for almost all tastes. TRAPPED ASHES is especially notable for its sheer uniqueness. It does follow in the format of many multistory horror gems, but it carves out a territory all its own. Expect the unexpected...",1217548800,,1808,4.844660194174757

8270002,2,B0018LX9SA,"Good photography and a fine musical score can't save this film.  In it a group of unpleasant people go on a tour of the back lot of a movie studio and have a ""special"" opportunity to visit a normally closed set, a creepy old house.  Once inside they find that they can't get out, so they tell stories about the scariest thing that ever happened to them.  There's a ""surprise"" ending in which they find out why they're in this situation.

Some formerly hot directors worked on, but don't bring a lot to, the various stories.  Joe Dante (Gremlins) directed the scenes set at the movie studio and in the haunted house.  Ken Russell (Women in Love; Altered States) makes a complete mess of a story about a starlet who gets breast implants that turn out to be livelier than she expected.  Sean S Cunningham (Friday the 13th) directs a well told story about an American and his wife whose trip to Japan is a less than relaxing vacation.  Monte Hellman (The Shooting; Two Lane Blacktop) contributes a story about Hollywood in the 1950's that strongly hints at being about reclusive director Stanley Kubrick.  And John Gaeta, previously known for his work on special effects for films such as The Matrix, directs an incredibly bad story about a young woman and the parasite that grew in the womb beside her when she was a baby.

Performances are all over the place.  Most of the actors are fairly wooden, although in their defense the writing is amateurish and they had little to work with.

Worse yet, the film has a split personality.  Horror movie one minute, then very soft core porn, then back to horror again.  It's like watching TV late at night with a defective remote that switches between Chiller and Cinemax After Dark at random.

It was good to see a couple of familiar cases in the cast, both of whom deserve better: Henry Gibson from Laugh-In and John Saxon.  Acting is like any other job: you go where the work is.",1464652800,,1921,4.556851311953353

8270005,2,B0018LX9SA,"It isn't the worst movie Ive ever seen, but it is far from the best and even further from the most original. From the initial set up- a group of people trapped together in a building who tell scary stories- to each of the vignettes, chances are that youve seen or read the story before and it was told better. I actually think that some of the stories would have been pretty good if given more time. (None seem to warrant a full feature length film though.) I left the film particularly thinking that the story about the two filmmakers could have been an interesting character study of close male relationships and how the introduction of a woman impacts it. (Again, something that youve probably seen a thousand times before.) Not that it was all unoriginal- I can honestly say that Ive never seen breasts drink from straws before, but even that story was just a different take on the evil organ donor.",1428883200,,903,4.54601226993865
8270006,5,B0018LX9SA,"So just tonight I got the idea of making it a regular thing to review movies and possibly other entertainments such as books & music as though I were writing wine reviews, with all the pretentious creativity of the language. I'd really love to hear what you think, and will use this particular review as a sort of trial balloon, paying special attention to how many people it's helpful to.

This is a satisfyingly sexual horror anthology with a glitzy glittery Hollywood bouquet with notes of Eat, Starry Eyed, Mulholland Drive and even Inland Empire. While not quite as potent as, say, a Little Deaths, they have in common sleazy, shadowy, lurid, sexually mature anthological flavor; on the other hand, it has a robust Chaucerian cohesiveness that Little Deaths lackslike Cantebury Tales or even more Neil Gaimen's graphic novel Worlds' End, part of the Sandman series that deserves a cinematic uncorking sometime soon after Sandman's scheduled cinematic debut and are you not FREAKING EXCITED ABOUT THAT? but I digress.

It's sad that Henry Gibson; formerly a major star of Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In had to lower himself into taking this part.
I would say that he was the only good thing about this botch job of a film.

8270008,2,B0018LX9SA,"I really don't understand myself sometimes.  Why would I watch this ""horror anthology"" in its entirety?  It's like watching the ancient Greeks twisting women into horrors like Medusa - every single one of the women in this thing are monsters in one form or another, feeding off of men, in one way or another.  The experience left me feeling a bit nauseous, actually, with the grotesque images and plots.  Some of the sequences are visually quite stunning, quite beautiful.  The acting is pretty good within the stories being told but the characters outside of the stories are simply lacking in dimension.  There are multiple credits for Japanese contributors, producers, etc., so perhaps this is a glimpse into their cultural representation of women, I don't know.  I wouldn't watch this again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone who doesn't appreciate the grotesque, misogynistic, perverse, or Ken Russell - who has a brief role in the first story towards the end as Dr. Lucy.  The Japanese setting for one of the stories is quite breathtaking, and I could appreciate that film as opposed to the others because it was so well shot and scripted.  I don't know, I prefer reading most horror stories this graphic to seeing them, I guess.  Left me feeling a bit violated.",1419465600,,1268,4.883177570093458

I watched this based on the high number of stars it presented. I'm going to venture that the writer, Jacye Bartok, had a lot of friends come and write glowing reviews for his movie. Or, maybe a lot of fans of horror like 'Tales From The Darkside'.",1413676800,,508,4.521739130434782
