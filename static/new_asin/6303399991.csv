8376831,3,6303399991,"The video was better than I have expected. However, there was not a single song to play for  exercise in volume #1. Buy volume #2 as well if you buy this one, volume #1 will get you nowhere.",939945600,59,190,4.0
8376832,4,6303399991,"This is a good video for the absolute beginner.  It teaches you how to tune, and how to play a few chords.  I wouldn't recommend it if you've played guitar before. Buy this if you're a beginner, but also buy step two  along with it.",939168000,40,232,4.111111111111111
8376833,3,6303399991,I wish I would've read the first review about the duration. I was just getting tuned up and the video was over. I wish the Video Length was a standard field for the titles. I think paying 20$ for 100 minutes is a  better value than paying 10$ for 30minutes. Now I have to buy the second  video...,939168000,28,296,4.086206896551724
