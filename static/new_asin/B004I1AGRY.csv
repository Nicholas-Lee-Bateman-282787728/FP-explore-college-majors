4381707,4,B004I1AGRY,"At first it seems like a story that's been told many times, but this movie does it in a very touching and believable way.",1391904000,,121,4.083333333333333
4381708,2,B004I1AGRY,"I really wanted to like this movie, hoping it would redeem itself at the end. Sadly, that was not to be the case. This movie was really unmemorable, and the pace painfully slow. I didn't like the whole 3rd person narrative that was used to express the main characters inner thoughts. This movie was a boring attempt at a sincere tear-jerker trying to tackle/convey a difficult subject, -death and how people cope and come to terms with it. Unfortunately I didn't think it did it very well.",1385164800,,489,4.632183908045977
4381709,5,B004I1AGRY,"This was a wonderful surprise of a movie. The treatment of the subject matter was thoughtful, and the characters were terrific. There are more moments that will make you laugh than cry. The acting was also great.",1380326400,5,212,4.756756756756757
4381710,5,B004I1AGRY,"This was a surprising movie.  The acting is great and I found myself really liking the characters and caring about their journey.  There aren't enough sweet simple movies like this.  When I read the synopsis I thought it could be a little slow or overly sentimental. But it's not.  It really handles the tricky subject matter gracefully.  I highly recommend this movie.  Also, it would make a great gift for anyone who is struggling with cancer or any terminal illness.  Its ""seize the day"" message is great for the rough patches in life.",1306972800,8,538,4.720430107526882
4381711,5,B004I1AGRY,"This movie really surprised me with its deft handling of so many different emotions all wrapped up in the cinematic bow.  Inside the box is an indie romantic comedy but along the way the movie keeps giving you unexpected turns of emotion that come off as the way life is really lived and tragedy ought to be faced.  The main character, Joe, is a bit of a hapless shmoe who discovers a zest for life through a girl named Claire.  Like all of us who, at one point or another in our lives, needed an awakening of sorts to put things in persepective, Joe takes his new found perspective and really flies.  Be prepared to cry!  Counting Backwards took me on an enjoyable roller coaster and left me with my own new found perspective.  Highly recommended.",1304899200,10,748,4.463235294117647

4381716,2,B004I1AGRY,a little too slow for me,1404691200,,24,3.1666666666666665
4381717,2,B004I1AGRY,Slow moving and not very good. I found it to be unbelievable and was not drawn into the story because of that.,1403308800,,110,4.045454545454546
4381718,3,B004I1AGRY,"Counting Backwards - This movie was fine for passing an afternoon's time.  I was never bored, but I was never engaged either, so I might rate it 2 1/2 for that reason.  It's a simple story, which is just fine, but neglects to go deeper than it might, so the range of the emotions remain on the surface.  Several reviewers think differently, but, as a movie fan, I prefer movies that make me think and challenge me or touch me so that I have to see it again.  If you can view it on Amazon Prime, do so and let's see what you have to say.",1402876800,,536,4.028301886792453
4381719,5,B004I1AGRY,"A sentimental film of the deeper glimpse in relationships between mother and friends.  And by allowing a new love in your life, knowing that your time is limited, their becomes so much more richer.
An insightful story with a profound and penetrating script.  Its definitely recommended for the soulful.
Beautifully Done!",1399161600,,320,5.254901960784314
4381720,3,B004I1AGRY,"This movie was slow to start and confusing in the beginning until I figured out that he was narrating his book in the middle of conversations with other people. If you can get through the beginning, it is worth watching.",1392854400,,220,4.525
4381721,4,B004I1AGRY,A chick flick for sure. I would not call this film a comedy but here are light moments. Food for thought in this film. A,1392163200,,120,3.84

8429901,4,B004I1AGRY,Well done story about the confusion of hearing traumatic news and the effect it has on our take on everyday events. It also really does a good job of showing how we need to value our relationships and live like there's no tomorrow.,1469059200,,231,4.395348837209302

8429903,4,B004I1AGRY,The characters were both different and interesting. Ben Kingsley is always superb. And the story seemed to hold a rewarding truth which left a good feeling.,1462752000,,156,5.038461538461538
8429904,2,B004I1AGRY,"They like to use those choppy cuts, you know like when someone is getting dressed and they cut through it so you don't have to see the whole thing or whatever, which worked well enough most of the time, but sometimes they would throw that in there as if they just decided to for no particular reason, like when a doctor was sitting down and they cut from when he was nearly seated to when he was slightly more nearly almost seated. Thank goodness they didn't know where the zoom-in-and-out button is.

I kept thinking, ""Okay, I could not possibly care less if this guy dies, and everyone like him, which includes most of the characters in this movie,"" and I expected that his shocking terminal diagnosis would have some affect on his personality or his character or something. If that ever happened, I couldn't make it that far. I don't mean to talk like someone who actually knows how to review movies, but I am reminded of reviews in which the reviewers talk about how they did not care about the characters. Same here for me. If you want to show me a movie about someone who is dying, make it someone I would hate to see go, not the kind of person I hate to see living in the first place.",1462579200,,1191,4.3408071748878925
