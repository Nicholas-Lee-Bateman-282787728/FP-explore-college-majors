6300386,5,B00IVLRC6K,"I was working in New Orleans when this summer came. As a white male Presbyterian minister in suburbs, the events of that summer profoundly changed the direction of my life: I returned to school an got a PhD in experimental social psychology and personality, in a quest to learn more about how to help overcome racism and its unjustified violence and abuse of human right. I am still active working now as a professor emeritus in justice studies, trying to help our nation be more committed to documents like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948). This movie reminded me of the need for Americans to be more committed to this ideals and rights, and it reminded me of how my life was changed by the students who came into Mississippi, often facing and experiencing hate and violence. They helped to change Mississippi and this nation.",1416873600,12,843,4.780821917808219
6300387,5,B00IVLRC6K,"This film is a great companion to Freedom Riders and Eyes on the Prize. The filmmakers added stories of people who are less familiar to many students of the movement and footage not seen by most people. Freedom Summer is a definite ""must see"" film for learning more about U.S. history.",1411516800,6,285,4.607843137254902

8645754,4,B00IVLRC6K,"If not quite as emotionally powerful as Nelsons Freedom Riders (2010), this is still a highly intelligent and well organized study of the attempts to overcome Jim Crow voting laws that almost entirely kept African Americans in Mississippi from registering to vote.  If it can feel a bit academic in the telling, the actual images and stories from the time are deeply chilling and upsetting  all the more so at a moment when echoes of that mass disenfranchisement of Americans are starting to sneak back into the political power structure in a number of states.  In 1964 the bold Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee decided to confront the issue head-on by bringing a thousand students from the north, both black and white to Mississippi to help the cause, make the country aware of what was going on, teach black history to children (something that Mississippi had effectively outlawed) and so forth.  They also put themselves at considerable risk, as the quick disappearance of three of the students  2 white, 1 black  made terribly clear.  A somber but still hopeful and uplifting reminder of a crucial piece of our recent history.",1488067200,,1140,5.0
