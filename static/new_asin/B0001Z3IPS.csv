2043621,5,B0001Z3IPS,"The fourth season of the SIMPSONS is truly the last terrific season of the show with all of the elements that made the show were in a correct place.  Namely this is the last season where Homer actaully shows a flicker of rational inteligence or care as a father before in later episodes he got the torch handed to him from Bart to be the shows defining character and turned into a babbling cretin who spewed nonsense.  The last season to probably give us episodes with scenes that are supposed to play out to some extent of substance instead of jumping endlessly around an episode and giving us quick jokes and sacrificeing a coherant story for the show.
Thats not to say that the SIMPSONS aren't still good in later seasons such as seven or eight but the show had found it's perfect fitting in season three and carried most of it into this season with some truly great episodes, but something happened in the fifth that made those shoes break and never to fit again the way that they should have.
Highlights this season include my vote for number one funniest episode of the series and is also the season opener KAMP KRUSTY in which Lisa and Bart head to Kamp Krusty for a summer paradise and find the camp to be more of a gulag complete with leaky cabins, bad food and bullies for councilers.  ITCHY AND SCRATCY THE MOVIE has Mrs. Krabappel warning Marge and Homer of Barts discipline problems and after he neglects in watching Maggie, Homer forbids him from seeing the new Itchy and Scratcy movie which turns into the biggest movie of the year. (The best injoke in the series is featured in this episode with Lisa telling Bart that Michael Jackson and Dustin Hoffman made uncredited voice cameos for the movie, both celebrities did the same thing for the show in seasons 3 and 2 respectivly).  MR. PLOW has Homer buying a snow plow and becoming a local hero but his thunder is stolen by Barney with his even bigger snow plow.  Adam West has a great guest appearance in this one.  A STREETCAR NAMED MARGE isn't so much funny as it is just a simply great episode with Marge getting the lead in a theatrical version of A Streetcar named Desire and Homer even learning something about himself and his lout ways after seeing the play.  HOMER THE HERETIC gets my vote as one of the top 5 episodes in my book with Homer meeting God in a dream after skipping out on church and being told that he may be allowed to continue staying home from church and pursue his own beliefs.  The last episode to air that also made you question whether it was ""right"" to watch the Simpsons or not.
Much with season three, there are too many good episodes to mention such as DUFFLESS and I LOVE LISA and HOMER's TRIPLE BYPASS.  LAST EXIT TO SPRINGFIELD even introduced me to one of my most favorite pieces of guitar music; Classical Gas.
Like when Homer said while looking in his yearbook after reading that he didn't do anything noteworthy, ""So many memories.""  This like I said was the last great season the Simpsons would have and it's too bad of a show in it's prime sliding downhill when things were finally put into place.  I attribute this season also with the last great year of my school days which is maybe why I like it as much as I do, back when this was when I lived and breathed the Simpsons.  While I will probably collect all of the Simpsons DVD's WHEN they are released eventually (read that okay FOX?!)  This one along with season three will spend the most time in my player.  I'm sure I'm not alone with the rest of the fans when I say this.",1056844800,8,3538,4.423076923076923
2043622,5,B0001Z3IPS,"The fourth season of The Simpsons carried the momentum of the prosperity of Season 3 and extended ""The Golden Age"" of the series. The storylines remain fresh, involving more minor characters such as Selma, Ralph Wiggum, and Krusty and humor has improved nicely from its first three seasons. Obviously, the presentation of the show is visually and aurally enhanced, satisfying by today's standards.  Season 4 features all twenty-two episodes in its entirety, with most of them being nothing short of spectacular.  Here are my personal favorite episodes:
Kamp Krusty: Now that the kids are out for the summer, Bart and Lisa spend some R&R at Kamp Krusty.  As the kids find out, Kamp Krusty is like a concentration camp more than anything.  They are fed with imitation gruel, bullied around by the school bullies, and for the unfortunate pleasantly plump, a brutal weight-loss regimen.  Despite the absence of Krusty the Klown, the namesake of the camp, Bart remains hopeful his comedic idol will come and save the day.
Homer the Heretic: Lazy one Sunday to go to church, Homer dreams that God has given him permission to skip church for good, with Marge on his case.  It isn't until Homer has a brush with death that he is compelled to return.
Treehouse of Horror III: The Simpsons host a Halloween party where they exchange scary stories. In the first short is ""Clown Without Pity"", Homer forgets it's Bart's birthday and hence, he has no present. In desperation, Homer buys a talking Krusty doll from a mysterious shop, which winds up trying to kill him.  The second part is a King Kong parody, dubbed King Homer. Last but not least, in ""Dial Z for Zombies"", Bart attempts to raise Lisa's deceased cat, Snowball I from the dead, only to raise dead people who run amok.
Marge vs. The Monorail: The town receives $3 million, due to Mr. Burns being fined for illegally dumping nuclear waste. Deciding what to do with the money, the townspeople are convinced by one Mr. Lanley with a catchy song, to build a monorail. Unswayed by public opinion, Marge's sneaking suspicions get the best of her as she eventually finds out that Lanley is hoodwinking Springfield by having the monorail be built by shoddy materials. Mono...D'OH!!!
Selma's Choice: My absolute favorite episode of Season 4. When her old maid Aunt Gladys passes away, Selma fears dying alone and therefore, she decides that she wants to marry and have a family. However, her newfound perspective is put to the test when Homer gets sick from eating a spoiled hoagie and because of his illness, Selma must accompany Bart and Lisa to Duff Gardens, a Disneyland-spoofed amusement park owned and operated by Duff Beer.
I Love Lisa: Feeling bad for the outsider of her class, Ralph Wiggum when he hasn't received a Valentine's greeting, Lisa sends one to Ralph. However, Ralph takes it the wrong way and therefore, chases Lisa to fall in love with him.
Last Exit to Springfield: The power plant proposes that each employee can get one free keg of beer on the condition by accepting the free booze, that they're coughing up their dental plan. Mindful that Lisa needs braces, Homer becomes the Union boss and negotiates to renew the dental plan.
Whacking Day: The town prepares to celebrate Whacking Day, an annual event where the townspeople can club snakes and Lisa attempts to do away with the bizarre festival. Meanwhile, Bart is expelled when he drives an out-of-control tractor, causing Principal Skinner's successful inspection to go down the drain.
This is an excellent purchase for the hardcore Simpsons fan or casual viewers or even for the newbies.  Highly recommended.",1056585600,3,3630,4.891056910569105
2043623,1,B0001Z3IPS,Aspect ratio for old simpsons episodes is 4:3. The older episodes for the show have all been cropped horribly to fit widescreen. At times it just looks horrid and the framing is flat out ugly.,1510963200,2,192,4.514285714285714

2043627,2,B0001Z3IPS,"Maybe I didn't see this, but this version of the Simpsons (season 4, amazon video) has been edited to widescreen cutting out a lot of the frame and causing the camera to jump around a lot.

I'm a huge Simpsons fan, and was excited that the seasons were now being offered for streaming on amazon video. The lines are nice and clean, but the decision to change the aspect ratio was a terrible one. Because of the widescreen format, most of the episodes are missing about 1/3 of every frame. This is very distracting because this requires the frame to be repositioned constantly causing the camera to feel like it's jumping around. The bad editing is especially evident during sight gags that take up the whole screen in which case the video just pops back into the original formatting. I really wish the original aspect ratio had been kept. I'm very disappointed with this transfer and feel like I did not get the product I paid for.

I added some pictures to illustrate what I mean, but it feels much worse while watching because of the added motion.

*Edit, I upgraded the review to reflect Amazon's excellent (I mean that sincerely) customer service, but will leave it at 2 stars to reflect the product itself.",1504742400,9,1211,4.623255813953488

2043661,1,B0001Z3IPS,"Let's be clear.  This show is incredible.  The only reason I'm giving it 1 star is so this information can be found easily.  After receiving the 2012 edition of this set, I tried playing New Kid On The Block to hear Conan's commentary.  Coincidentally, that's the episode that doesn't play at all on either my laptop or Bluray.  Lisa's menu animation plays then the screen freezes.  Of all seasons to have a defective disc, why did it have to be season 4?

There are plenty of 5-stars from 2015, so fingers crossed that most of the sets are perfectly fine and the replacement I order will work properly, but the other 1-stars are also for defective discs.  Just a head's up.  Give each disc a once over and make sure they're good.  I'm glad I caught it on day 1.  Such a bummer.",1449100800,,778,4.370629370629371

I made the mistake of buying Season 9 as my first Simpsons DVD simply because it was the cheapest. This is definitely worth the $money$. TV at it's finest...",1408060800,,500,4.693181818181818
2043729,5,B0001Z3IPS,"This is the great season full of classic episodes, starting with ""Kamp Krusty"". In the commentary, we learn that Jim Brooks liked the story so much he wanted to expand it to be a movie, which got the guys to laugh, because they had actually experienced trouble filling all of the minutes of this episode, even resorting to adding extra verses to the Kamp Krusty song just to make time! Around this time they had done ""The Yellow Album"" - it was never properly finished, then it appeared on the shelves! The discs include bonus features like ""Art and Animation: A Streetcar Named Marge"" with three items: ""A narrator showcase"" 9:40, ""Animatic"" 7:00, ""Animatic with Illustrated commentary"" 19:00. There's also ""The Cajun Controversy"", 2:10, talks about how the lyrics for the New Orleans song in ""A Streetcar Named Marge"" made people in New Orleans angry, it seems that Jim Kellner, head of Fox, apologised for it. So Bart writes ""I will not defame New Orleans"" in the opening credits. ""Special Language Feature: Kamp Krusty"" shows scenes from the episode in Brazilian Portuguese, Italian, Japanese, Castilian Spanish!! Great animated title bits. Bush versus Simpson"" featurette - apparently Barbara Bush doesn't ""get"" the Simpsons, hilarious and disturbing, for 4:10. ""Promotional Stuff"" 14:00 featurette. Useless intro to whole show and characters, cameos, etc. Music. Adam West, Leonard Nimoy. Outlived the Cosby Show. Includes four commercials that use the Simpsons: Compulsion, Unforgettable Classics (showing Bart in Luke's X-Wing fighter as he blows up the Death Star), Beachcomber with crabs for Butterfinger, the Big Steal KFC, 2:00. ""Bobby Sherman"", the menu has a screwy ""resume episode"" button. Deleted scenes include ""Homer's triple bypass, 7-10 seconds with 10 second interlude animation. ""Cops in the coffee shop"", ""Homer in the ambulance"", ""Krusty Cannon"", ""Homer eating pizza"", and other deleted scenes to episodes like ""The Front"", ""The Usual Rejection Letter"", ""I WIll Learn To Ski"", ""Richy and Kathy"", ""Dynamite in Cat"", ""Sit and Play With My Teeth"", ""Nickel For The Trolly"", ""Selma's Choice."" In the bad acid trip part there's a reference to Ralph Steadman. Parody of the Murphy Brown baby episode, because they thought that people would remember Murphy Brown forever. ""Brother From The Same Planet"", role was made for Tom Cruise, unlikely, sympathetic. But he didn't take it in the end. ""So Tom - screw you!!"" ""Who do you think I am, Tom Cruise?"" Exploding nun. Lisa plays guitar accurately. Gampa's rambling story debut in ""Last Exit To SPringfield.""",1406160000,,2571,5.227602905569007

If you're going to buy a season of the show, buy one of the earlier ones like this.

The original packaging was pretty bad, the internal DVD holders were cheap plastic ones, only held into place by glue, which, eventually, they would come loose. The new ones are made of a stronger plastic. It's still held in with glue, but it seems like a stronger glue as well, but that's just the base of the internal holder, the rest snap into place and turn like the pages of a book.",1397347200,,525,4.26

2043738,5,B0001Z3IPS,"This season of the Simpsons have some of my favorite episodes making it my personal favorite season! This season has 22 awesome episodes and won 3 Emmy awards for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance, Outstanding Individual Achievement in Music Composition for a Series, and Outstanding Individual Achievement in Sound Mixing for a Comedy Series. Other awards are the Annie Award for Best Animated Television Program, Genesis Award for Best Television Prime Time Animated Series, and a Saturn award Best Television Series. Along with more additions to the Simpson cast like Bumblebee Man and Superintendant Chalmers, this season also has many special celebrity guests like Red Hot Chili Peppers, Elizabeth Taylor, Adam West, Leonard Nimoy, Barry White, and many others.

 My favorite episode on this one is ""Treehouse of Horror III"" which include The Simpsons throwing a Halloween party and sharing scary stories to spook each other. 3 stories are told that make up the episode include 'Clown without Pity' A live Krusty doll tries to continuously kill Homer and no one believes him. 'King Homer' a B&W clip of Homer as King Kong. and 'Dial Z for Zombie' Where Bart accidently casts a spell to bring back the dead! IMO, the best Treehouse of Horror to date! Other favs include ""Whacking Day"" where the town of Springfield celebrate a day which they hunt innocent snakes, leaving Bart and Lisa to harbor the reptiles with the help of Barry White. ""Mr. Plow"" Homer crashes his car into Marge's resulting in them shopping for a new car, and wouldn't you know it, Homer ends up buying a snowplow. Homer gets into the plowing business and ends up making great money, however one of his best friends, Barney, moves in on his business and becomes competition. These are only a few of my top favs, so many other episodes in this set, all 22 episodes deserves a mention, but my reviews are long enough lol.

Special features include more cool commentaries and Easter egg commentaries and sketches. Storyboards and commercials featuring The Simpsons. An introduction from creator Matt Groening, and The Cajun Controversy and Bush vs. Simpsons featurettes.

Those shows and countless others that have followed would not exist without The Simpsons: The Mount Rushmore of Comedy, animated or not!

2043776,5,B0001Z3IPS,"I'm a long time Simpsons fan, and I've been inspiried by Matt Groening's work my entire life. From Life In Hell, to Futurama; his comedic style shines brightly more than Mafarlane, Judge, and the rest. And this is the season that changed comedy itself. First off, the jokes are always right on the ball. They're clever, and the timing is perfect. (Homer: ""How can someone abuse their body like that?"" Moe walks over to trash with a big container of brine shrimp. Homer: ""No Moe! Don't throw out that brine!"" Homers grabs it, and drinks it down.)Every episode is at least a B, but most of them are A's in my opinion. The plots are brilliantly planned and executed throughout the show, and the development of the plots is excellent. Another brilliant part of this season is the guest stars. Leonard Nimoy was downstraight hilarious in the classic: ""Marge Vs. The Monorail"". (""A solar eclipse, the cosmic ballet goes on!"" '""Well, I guess my work here is done!"" ""What do you mean? You didn't do anything!"" ""Didn't I?"") Speaking of which, there are 3 super-classics in this season, and most of the episodes themselves are memorable. The three classics are ""Marge Vs. The Monorail"", ""Mr. Plow"", and my all time favorite: ""Last Exit To Springfield"". These classics are stuffed with incredible humor, plots, and development. The pop-culture references were very brief, but clearly stood out. This is one of the things that raised the Simpsons to popularity.

I extremely reccomend that you buy this season. It's my favorite Simpson's Season out of the classic first 9 seasons, and it really defined the incredible quality of the show. There are no bad episodes and they each have plenty of entertainment. This season is a classic. BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT!",1331424000,,1746,4.82
2043777,5,B0001Z3IPS,this is great item and if you love the simpsons then you will love this and then its a must have. i recommend to any simpsons lover,1329955200,,131,3.888888888888889
2043778,5,B0001Z3IPS,"I've been a Simpsons fan as long as I can recall. I remember in grade school sitting on the kitchen counter and watching the syndicated show every week night at 7:30. (My dad would be watching something else on the television in the living room and our only other one was a small white TV in the kitchen for some reason). I know a lot of people believe the show has gotten terrible lately; some saying blasphemous statements like even Family Guy is even funnier now. I'm not one of those people. I can agree on the fact that it is not the cultural phenomenon it once was, but I still find it better than a lot of other stuff on TV these days.

Season four of The Simpsons is easily one of the shows funniest. It contains classics like ""Kamp Krusty"", where Krusty the Clown takes the kids to Tijuana, ""Homer the Heretic"", when Homer makes his own religion, and perhaps the most famous Simpsons episode ever, ""Mr. Plow"". But my personal favorite is the one titled ""New Kid on the Block"". This one stands out to me for a number of reasons. The writing (by none other than Conan O'Brien) is great, the story is good, and of course, this episode introduces us to a great character, the Sea Captain, who calls Homer ""Bottomless Pete: Nature's cruelest mistake"" after Homer eats his entire restaurant. The specials on these DVDs are good, which include early drawing of characters, TV specials, promos, and of course, audio commentary. The commentary is hit or miss, sometimes it has celebrity guests, and sometimes it's just the writers and animators talking about who knows what.

2043782,5,B0001Z3IPS,"The Simpsons has quite simply become one of those iconic television shows like The Waltons, Cosby Shows, Happy Days, and Cheers of the world. It is true that some episodes and seasons are better than others over a twenty year run, but season four that aired in 1992-3 is one of the better seasons with such classic episodes like Homer the Heretic-where Homer meets a five fingered God, Brother from the Same Planet-Homer and Bart abuse Big Brothers & Big Sisters, and Mr. Plow where Homer starts a plowing operation only to be bested by Barney. You get all twenty three episodes with optional episode commentary, select episode Animation showcases, a making of the Simpsons feature, promotional commercials, Bush vs. Simpson and The Cajun Controversy--two features about contreversies the Simpsons started in this time period.

2043785,4,B0001Z3IPS,"The majority of fans have spoken and through various polls have named many of the episodes of Season Four among their all-time favourites.  In addition the quality of the drawings have improved a great deal from the first three seasons and the shimmering, crooked lines that you get on most of the episodes from the previous dvd releases has been reduced significantly here. As is the case for the previous dvd releases though the sound quality on Dolby 5.1 surround is still pretty good.  Personal favourites include ""Whacking Day"", ""Brother From the Same Planet"" and ""Marge Vs. the Monorail"" although as is the case for the vast majority of all episodes, it is hard to find any duds.  Loved all the classic movie spoofing that is liberally interspersed throughout the episodes which for me is a major reason I enjoy the entire franchise so much.

2043788,5,B0001Z3IPS,"There isn't really much to say about this product other than that the fourth season of the Simpsons is one of the best seasons ever and well worth any television fan's time.  Even though the animation can be a little crude (which only adds to the charm), the writing is of consistently high-quality.  This season contains many famous episodes, but even the less well-known episodes are still very enjoyable to watch.

The primary extra on this DVD set is the commentary that various people (writers, directors, Matt Groening) provide for each episode.  While they sometimes end up discussing something far afield from the show, most of the time they provide entertaining, interesting, and insightful commentary on how the episodes were created.

Even though the Simpsons still runs in syndication across basically the entire United States, if you want to have access to some of the best episodes of the Simpsons ever made, you need go no further than this DVD set.",1243555200,,964,4.962732919254658

2043790,5,B0001Z3IPS,"I tend to agree with a lot of people that this season is definitely one of the best. I won't say the best because there were episodes from season 3 that I liked better, but I'm proud to say that I own the first four seasons and, when it finally does arrive, season 5 as well. Season 4 features some of the funniest episodes I've seen in recent years. While I don't believe like many people that the new Simpsons sucks, I do agree that it's lost some of its steam. There are still episodes that have me laughing almost as much as the older ones do. Camp Krusty, which spawned the horrible Game Boy game Bart Simpson: Escape from Camp Deadly, is one worth watching over and over. Other favorites of mine are A Streetcar Named Marge, The Itchy and Scratchy Movie, Homer's Tripple Bypass, Mr. Plow and, my absolute favorite, Duffless. I can vividly remember sitting in my bedroom in our house in San Clemente, California on the night this episode first aired, trying not to laugh too much as I made a half-hearted attempt to do my homework. Not that I succeeded. Another favorite, aside from the Treehouse of Horror, is Homer the Heretic, which I also remember watching the night it first aired. None of the episodes in this season had me laughing quite as much as, say, Homer at the Bat, Radio Bart or Bart the Lover, but they're still well worth watching over and over again. About my only complaint with this season, and that of a few others I understand, is that the menu setup isn't very user friendly. That and the little animation that plays before your selection is even loaded can get annoying. Still, it's well worth buying this set, especially if you're a loyal fan like myself.",1223424000,,1685,4.49185667752443

With so many more episodes I can not complain on any level about the storytelling or the acting or the animation.

The only problem I have with the dvd is the menu format for the DVD. It certainly seems that the season 4 dvds are the black sheep of all the seasons. The menu set up is not very simpsonesque.

2043797,5,B0001Z3IPS,"It's been a while since I've watched any episodes off the 4th Season of the Simpsons. Combined with watching the latest seasons being released, waiting painfully for the 11th season to be released, and filling up my summer with excessive vacations, it's been difficult to find the time to watch the seasons I haven't caight up with. However, I have recently found time to watch them, and I've realized that I've forgotten how good they are. Classic episodes such as Homer The Heretic (""MMM.... fattening""), Itchy And Scratchy The Movie (""The original idea came from a vicous mouse who attacked and killed a small cat""), Mr. Plow (""Whose up at 3:00 AM watching TV?"" ""Alchoholics, the unemployable, jailbirds...""), Homer's Triple Bypass (""I'm not gonna die, that only happens to bad people"" ""What about Abraham Lincoln?"" ""Um, he sold poison milk to school children.), Selma's Choice (""Marge, I'd like to be alone with the sandwhich."" ""Are you going to eat it?"" ""...Yes""), Brother From The Same Planet (""This is even more painful than it looks""), Duffles (""From the town of Springfield, he's about to hit a chesnut tree. Ahh!!!""), and Krusty Gets Cancelled (""Smart bunnies, Heff, smart bunnies..."") all made their places among my favorite episodes of the show. Now, the whole season is amazing, but those are my favorites. My favorite episode, however, would have to be Homer's Triple Bypass. This is the episode that established Dr. Nick Riviera (however you spell that) as one of the most important side characters, and is one of my favorites as well. Homer also showcases the hilarity of hia character, as he tries to desperately to sugarcoat that he's getting a bypass so he can tell Bart, Lisa, and Maggie don't get upset. Truly an awesomely hilarious episode, along with great moments with Dr. Nick.

Unlike most people, I don't think the show has lost its steam, although the early seasons were the best, and helped make the show what it is today. I say this as a loyal fan of the Simpsons. If you're a fan, you probably already own this. If you don't, what the hell are you waiting for?! Go out and buy it NOW!!!

2043807,5,B0001Z3IPS,"There's no doubt the 1992 - 1993 era of The Simpsons was the golden age for the show. This is my absolute favourite season of The Simsons. I love this season so much because there are just so many great episodes in it.
  I won't go into an episode by episode listing or anything. I'll just give you my oppinion of the season and mention some of my favourite episodes from it...

  Season 4 is full of some of the most Popular episodes in the entire shows run, and could arguably be considered among fans and TV Critics the best season in the shows history. Who hasn't seen the classic ""Marge Vs the monorail"" episode - Voted one of the most favoured episodes in the entire shows run. ""Mr. Plow"" was also another of the most popular episodes ever, where Barney steals Homer's idea of plowing peoples driveways. ""Mr.plow, That's my name, that name again is mr Plow"".  ""A Streetcar Named Marge"" is a great episode where Marge tries out for a part in the play ""A Streetcar named Desire"", but Homer seems less then enthusiastic about the idea. Maggie's Escape from the Ayn Rand daycare centre is funny  and ""New Kid on the block"", ""Homer the Heretic"" and ""Brother From the Same Planet"" where Bart gets a new father, because Homer forgets to pick him up from soccer practice, then Homer in retaliation adopts a homeless kid named Pepi to be his new son are all very good episodes too.
  Another favourite of mine is ""Lisa The Beauty Queen"" where Lisa erolls in a beauty pagent to try and make her feel more confident about herself after she sees a charicature drawn of her, but my personal favourite is Treehouse Of Horror 3, I love the third segment where Bart and Lisa are trying to ressurect Snowball 1 from the dead, but instead end up ressurecting Zombies from the Springfield cemetery after Bart reads an incantation from a ""TIME LIFE"" book of spells, whilst wearing an LP sleeve of Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" on his head. The Killer Krusty doll bit is also great.
  There are lots of laughts in this season, and I basically enjoyed all the episodes. I remembered how many episodes in this set I had seen as a kid when I was watching it, and it really brought back a lot of fun memories and made me happy to watch them again.
  ""Itchy and Scratchy:The Movie"" is a great episode where Homer bans Bart from seeing the Itchy & Scratchy Movie because he can't seem to behave at school - or at home, as is ""Kamp Krusty"" and ""I Love Lisa"" - You Choo Choo Choose me reads the card Ralph gets from Lisa.
  ""Duffless"" was a memorable episode where Homer is trying to go without beer for a month, and ""Marge In Chains"" is the episode where marge goes to prison for forgetting to pay for a bottle of Burbon at the Kwiki-mart.
  ""Selma's Choice"" is another absolute favourite of mine where Selma takes Bart and Lisa to Duff Gardens after Homer gets sick from eating a month old foot long sandwich. ""Lisa's First Word"" is a sweet episode where we are told how Lisa began to speak and shows an insight to the past of The Simpsons.
  At this time in the shows history the Animation had just got better, the characters were developing more, and each episode got funnier by...the episode.
  This is just Classic Simpsons, and there is no season before this one that was better, and all the seasons after it, even though some come close ""Season 5"" didn't quite match up to it. Season 4 really raised the bar for the show, and animated comedy TV in general. This is the classic Simpsons weve all come to know and love. Any fan of the show, or TV comedy animation shows should have this boxset up on the shelf of their DVD library.
It's Very Enjoyable viewing these episodes again, and they are a real blast from the past. This is one Simpson's season you'll stick in the DVD drive again and again.",1165104000,,3780,4.433526011560693

I love nearly every episode on this season, my favorites being (among others) ""Whacking Day"", and ""Last Exit to Springfield"".  This season has lines that stick with you the moment you hear them because they make you laugh so hard.  For example, ""Das ist not eine BOOBY!"" (Hitler), ""Duff gardens...hurrah!""

2043813,5,B0001Z3IPS,"'The Simpsons' won Best International Comedy Show at last week's 'British Comedy Awards' and if you had been a living in a subterranean cave for the last 10 years then this alone would tell you that 'The Simpsons' is a funny programme. However, if you are reading this review then you probably haven't, hopefully not, and will know that 'The Simpsons' is one of the funniest, if not the funniest, shows around; a legend. Matt Groening, famed writer of 'The Simpsons', was awarded an 'Outstanding Contribution to Comedy' Award too.

Season 4 is, in my opinion, one of the best. The episodes are packed with jokes in all forms - visual, verbal, puns, slapstick, satire, innuendo, and even crude bathroom antics. This was also the first Season to feature the famous ""inside Homer's brain"" scenes. The previous reviewer has already listed all the episodes so instead I am going to give a more in depth review of the better episodes of the Season.

Episode 2 - A Streetcar Named Marge:

Jon Lovitz guest stars as the director of the musical ""Oh, Streetcar!"", a parody of Marlon Brando's ""A Streetcar Named Desire"". Marge auditions and gets the lead role of Blanche, opposite...Ned Flanders! Homer's insensitivity and stupidity inspire her to give the performance of a lifetime. Meanwhile, Maggie is in a playgroup while Marge rehearses and the rules are strict, too strict, so she plans a ""Great Escape"" style mutiny, there's even a mimic scene with her and a ball!

Couch: The family runs in and the couch turns into a giant octopus and eats them.

Episode 8 - New Kid on the Block:

The Simpsons have new neighbours, a single mother with a daughter, whom Bart falls for immediately. Marge welcomes them and Bart soon finds that his love, Laura, is a complete tomboy. Homer and Marge go to a seafood restaurant and they get Laura to baby-sit. At the restaurant, Homer eats A LOT of food in an all-you-can-eat buffet and the restaurant kicks him out on the street and he decides to sue them. Bart starts asking questions about the birds and the bees and just when he gets a plan to win Laura, she tells him that she has a boyfriend. It is Jimbo, and Bart feels betrayed, depressed, and angry. Homer's court case begins and the lawyers reveal what a pig Homer is, (hey, it's true). The Sea Captain (who owns the restaurant) makes a deal with Homer; he eats free seafood and people gawk at him like a freak. Bart prank calls Moe as Jimbo, resulting in Moe coming after him in a murderous rampage. When Jimbo cries, Laura leaves him and begins hanging with Bart again. The prank call is one of the best with Moe saying: ""Ivana Tinkel, Ivana Tinkel?! Okay, everyone put down your glasses Ivana Tinkel?!""

Couch: The couch falls through the floor with family on board.

Episode 12 - Marge vs the Monorail:

Mr Burns goes on trial for dumping toxic waste and pays a huge fine. The town holds a meeting on what to do with the money and Marge suggests repairing the city. Just when they are about to approve her idea, in comes a guy singing and dancing about a monorail. The whole meeting erupts with everyone singing ""monorail! monorail! monorail!"" (and Homer going ""Mono...D'oh!"") and they approve the idea. Marge is unsure so she goes to another monorail town and discovers that it is all a dangerous scam and finds out that the guy in charge is a con artist on his way to Tahiti. Leonard Nimoy (Spock to you and me) guest stars.

Couch: The family sits down, followed by the show's whole cast.

Episode 22 - Krusty Gets Cancelled: This episode guest stars the Red Hot Chilli Peppers, Elizabeth Taylor and Bette Midler. 'Gabbo', a ventriloquist dummy, has a new show that competes with Krusty's. When Gabbo beats Krusty in the ratings, the network cancels Krusty's show. Krusty auditions unsuccessfully for acting roles and loses money at the track. Bart wants to ruin Gabbo, so he pulls a TV stunt. Krusty is flat broke and Bart and Lisa work to help him get back on TV. They ask Krusty's celebrity friends to appear on a comeback special. First on the list is Bette Midler. Then Hugh Hefner, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Elizabeth Taylor, Johnny Carson, Sideshow Mel, and Sideshow Luke Perry are asked next. Bart and Lisa return to find that Krusty has put on a lot of weight. He stays with the Simpson family while he tries to lose the weight. The day of the show arrives and it goes incredibly well, opposite the now stale Gabbo show. Bart, Lisa, and the celebrities come through for him and his show is back for good. Afterwards they all hang out at Moe's...isn't that nice.

Couch: The family get caught in a net while running to the couch.

Other then those episodes, Season 4 also features Marge going to jail, Lisa's first word and the 'snake-clubbing' episode which guest stars Barry White. Buy it, you'll love it.",1150329600,8,4812,4.6271981242672915
2043814,5,B0001Z3IPS,"It's so good it's easily one of the best seasons of *any TV show ever, in history. This season was pure magic, the high point of a fantastic TV series that has gone downhill since Season 8. How good is it? Take the worst episode of this season (except maybe the clip show) and it's better than any episode post Season 8.

Its influence is vast. It is dubious ""South Park,"" ""Family Guy,"" or 90% of the Cartoon Network's American animated shows would exist without ""The Simpsons."" It opened the animated world to new, previously unthought-of of opportunities, and virtually patented incongruous literary humor in the face of low culture in animation, fantasy and cut-away sequences found in shows of all kinds and run into the ground by ""Family Guy,"" endless pop-culture references (also run into the ground by ""Family Guy,""), and this season just plain opened the door to what an animated show could be and do. It truly was revolutionary in the industry and pop culture. I still hear lines like ""Dental plan!"" quoted in the most unusual situations today by people you wouldn't expect to hear it from. Every episode is a classic, bar none. I've seen these episodes an embarrassing number of times, and still enjoy them to this day. Just for the heck of it, I'll briefly review and rate the individual episodes.

""Kamp Krusty"" - Starts out with a hilarious end-of-the-school-year sequence (""Much obliged, doll;"" ""The dirt - it's not coming off!"") and proceeds into the story, in which Homer and Marge rekindle their blissful, pre-child marriage and Bart overthrows the tyrannical Kamp Krusty. 10/10.

""A Streetcar Named Marge"" - Absolutely hilarious. Marge, bored of her dull life, decides to join a community theater musical production of ""A Streetcar Named Desire,"" directed by the uproarious Llewellyn Sinclair, voiced marvelously by Jon Lovitz (""Play enjoyed by ALL""). Homer gives her little support, and Maggie is carted off to a cold Ayn Randian day care center in which she seeks to liberate her pacifier. Once the play begins we see the parallels between Stanley and Blanche and Homer and Marge. Fabulous, intelligent comedy. 10/10.

""Homer the Heretic"" - Homer doesn't like getting up and spending a freezing Sunday in church, so he invents his own religion, much to the chagrin of Marge and the community. Very funny, especially the car chase sequence (""Dad, the heathen's getting away!"") but also surprisingly thoughtful. 10/10 (you're going to be seeing a lot of those ratings).

""Lisa the Beauty Queen"" - Lisa feels she is ugly after an unflattering caricature of her is drawn, so Homer enters her in the Little Miss Springfield Pageant to prove she's beautiful. Lisa resists at first, but soon gets caught up in it, with Bart helping to hilarious effect. After a strange series of events Lisa gets caught up with the tobacco industry. 9/10.

""Tree house of Horror III"" - The Simpsons gather to tell scary stories, which is funny in itself (Homer ruining the game, Flanders' costume, etc.), and as usual, this show features three horrific stories. The first is a take-off on the movie ""Child's Play"" and the Twilight Zone episode ""Living Doll"" in which an evil Krusty Doll tries to kill Homer. The second is somewhat less effective story in my book, re-doing King Kong for the Simpsons, with Homer as King Kong. The last story is my favorite. With Lisa pining over their dead cat Snowball, Bart attempts to raise it from the dead and ends up unleashing zombies (""Dad, you killed the zombie Flanders!) to comedic effect, but also about as spooky as the early Simpsons Tree house of Horror episodes got. 9/10.

""Itchy and Scratchy: The Movie"" - A fine episode in which we get to see a lot of Itchy and Scratchy mayhem, which is welcome. The viewer gets treated to a parent-teacher conference that shows how demented Bart can be, while Bart wreaks havoc at home. Bart's troublemaking gets out of hand when through his negligence he lets Maggie crash a car into a prison (just another great scene, Marge passing Maggie on the road), and Homer punishes him by banning him from seeing the wildly popular Itchy and Scratchy movie - forever. But maybe not, as we get a glimpse into the future. 9/10.

""Marge Gets a Job"" - ""Behold the Slanty Shanty!"" This episode is chock full of great jokes and a lot of Mr. Burns antics. The Simpsons need money to repair their foundation, so Marge gets a job at the nuclear plant, where Mr. Burns falls in love with her. This episode features some great fantasy sequences, like Mr. Burns imagining Homer, and Bart imagining the Curies (this one is very much like what ""Family Guy"" would later do), as well as some great scenes with Tom Jones. 10/10.

""New Kid on the Block"" - The Simpsons get new neighbors, a single mother named Ruth and her daughter Laura. Bart develops a crush on Laura, while Homer sues Captain McAllister over unfair treatment at an all-you-can-eat seafood buffet. A great episode, written by Conan O'Brien. 9/10.

""Mr. Plow"" - One of the best known Simpsons episodes ever. Homer crashes his car in a humorous sequence, and is goaded into buying a snow plow, with the idea that he'll plow roads and driveways for money. He makes a hilarious commercial, and has success, until he is outdone by Barney. 10/10.

""Lisa's First Word"" - Another great flashback episode that combines comedy, tenderness, and nostalgia. It's about how Lisa's arrival affects the family, but also features Maggie's first word at the end. 9/10.

""Homer's Triple Bypass"" - Now we're hitting a stretch of amazing classics. This episode gives new meaning to the phrase ""as funny as a heart attack"" when Homer's lifestyle catches up to him and he must take drastic measures to get the heart surgery he desperately needs. It doesn't sound funny, but you'd better believe it is. 10/10.

""Marge vs. the Monorail"" - Near universally cited as a Top 10 Simpsons episode, this one took wild wackiness and crazy humor to new heights. Springfield is left with a lot of money to spend after slapping a huge fine on Mr. Burns for his illegal waste disposal procedures. A con man (voiced brilliantly by Phil Hartman) comes along a la ""The Music Man"" and convinces them to invest in a monorail, which goes haywire and threatens the town in classic disaster movie fashion. Without a doubt, one of the greatest Simpsons episodes ever. 10/10.

""Selma's Choice"" - Another routine Top 10 selection on lists, this episode has so many memorable moments and quotable lines it's staggering. We bounce from the incongruously hilarious death of a relative and subsequent funeral (Homer and the kids' reactions to having to cancel their trip to go to the funeral is ridiculously funny); to Homer's escapades with a rotting sandwich; and finally to the alcohol-themed amusement park ""Duff Gardens."" Highlights are Selma's inappropriate line regarding immigrant labor, Homer's recovery from the ravages of the sandwich, Lisa's adventure from drinking ride water, Homer's musing on ""legend of the dog-faced woman,"" and his problems with a restaurant maze placemat (the commentary during this part cracks me up). 10/10.

""Brother from the Same Planet"" - The commentary for this episode suggests it was not well-received by the higher-ups involved with the show. I don't know why, it's fantastic, with tons of great jokes. Homer forgets to pick up Bart at soccer practice (Bart's attempts to communicate through telepathy to tell Homer to pick him up are great) and for revenge Bart gets a ""new father"" from the Bigger Brothers foundation. Homer finds out about it, and to get back at Bart he gets a ""new son"" from the same foundation. When the two parties meet up at an aquarium, crazy hilarity ensues. 10/10.

""I Love Lisa"" - This episode gets high marks for Bart's impersonation of Nixon and John Wilkes Booth, and the ""Mediocre Presidents"" song alone. Interestingly enough, the commentary notes the similarities in speech and bearing between Rex and ""Family Guy""'s Stewie. Lisa feels sorry for Ralph and is the only one to give him a valentine on Valentine's Day, and he falls in love with her. Another good episode. 9/10.

""Duffless"" - Yet another perennial Top 10 list selection. Bart destroys Lisa's science fair project, so, in ""A Clockwork Orange"" fashion she makes him part of her new one. However, Bart gets the last laugh. In the main story, Homer slips out of work early to take a tour of the Duff Brewery and gets arrested for drunken driving. He loses his license and Marge convinces him to quit drinking for a month. Highlights include Bart's opening science fair dream, Homer's escape from the nuclear power plant, and Homer resisting the urge to drink against incredible odds. One of the all-time classic. 10/10.

""Last Exit to Springfield"" - There's no question about it whatsoever. This is the best episode of ""The Simpsons"" ever. The *best* episode *ever.* This is basically the template for ""Family Guy"" and a ton of other animated shows. It's got so many hilarious, clever, and memorable moments that an attempt to catalog them would all would just be like posting the script for the episode. This is the episode that contains the world-famous ""Dental plan"" bit as well as a ton of other favorite Simpsons' moments. Burns is angry at what he thinks is a greedy and shiftless union so he sets out to win the dental plan back. Lisa goes to the dentist and needs braces, so Homer realizes he must protect the dental plan, and becomes union president. From there the episode takes off into heights of hilarity rarely seen ever before or since. 10/10.

""So It's Come to This: A Springfield Clip Show"" - It's a clip show, back in the days when clip shows were far more prevalent. However, for a clip show, it's pretty good, and one of the better Simpsons clip shows. The first third, with no clips, is particularly good. I particularly liked Homer playing practical jokes on Bart and their exchanges (""You talk better than you fool!""). The clips, eh, they're okay, seen them before. The original material though is pretty terrific. 8/10.

""The Front"" - Great episode. Bart and Lisa are chagrined by the decline in quality of Itchy and Scratchy episodes, so they send in a script for their own episode, using Grandpa Simpson as a ""front"" so they are taken seriously. It works, and their episode airs and wins an award. Meanwhile, Homer goes back to night school to get his high school diploma. This episode ends with the treasured ""Adventures of Ned Flanders"" segment (""Hens loves roosters, geese love ganders"" etc.). 10/10.

""Whacking Day"" - One of my all time favorites, really an underrated episode. The first act is a hilarious segment that features the debut of Superintendent Chalmers. Chalmers is coming for a surprise inspection that Principal Skinner gets wind of. He locks Bart, Nelson, Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney in a basement to make the school appear better than it is. Skinner and Chalmers have some hilarious exchanges (""So that would make you hear r's as b's?"") but Chalmers appears to be won over until Bart escapes his basement and crashes Willie's tractor into Chalmers, which earns an expulsion from Skinner. Marge looks for alternative schooling for Bart in the second act, while the town prepares for whacking day, a day in which snakes are killed. This bothers Lisa to no end. Simply another fantastic episode. 10/10.

""Marge in Chains"" - Marge is stressed out with Grandpa hanging around and Bart, Lisa, and Homer all sick. While thinking about other things, she accidentally pockets a bottle of bourbon from the Kwik-E-Mart and gets caught stealing. A comical trial ensues, and Marge is sent to prison, which sets off a chain reaction of very humorous events. Listen to the commentary and you'll be treated to a heated debate about Jimmy Carter. 10/10.

""Krusty Gets Kancelled"" - The last episode of the wonderful Season 4 is an all-out extravaganza. Krusty's show faces competition from a newcomer, Gabbo, and after the show is cancelled, he finds himself facing financial ruin and a loss of identity. With Bart and Lisa's help, he puts together a comeback special that brings in some of the celebrities of all time, including Johnny Carson. Besides the obvious draw of all the celebrities, this is just a smartly written and very funny episode. 10/10.

The extras are pretty good but not great. Among them, there's a mildly animatic with commentary for ""A Streetcar Named Marge;"" we learn about the controversy with New Orleans surrounding that show in a short bit; and the deleted scenes are as good as always. The real treat is the commentaries, however, and this season contains some of the best of them. I particularly like the commentaries for ""A Streetcar Named Marge,"" with Jon Lovitz, who makes fun of Al Jean and Mike Reiss and is generally very funny; ""Marge Gets a Job,"" ""Selma's Choice,"" ""Duffless,"" ""Last Exit to Springfield,"" and ""Homer the Heretic."" The commentary for ""New Kid on the Block"" and the ""hidden"" commentary for ""Marge vs. the Monorail"" features a very funny Conan O'Brien. His part in the commentary for ""New Kid on the Block"" is great, especially the bit about the angry boss and his remark ""Yeah, TV is pretty bad."" I also found his observation about how Jimbo got his comeuppance in the episode to be pretty amusing (and accurate).

In conclusion, if you haven't seen these episodes, watch them as soon as you can. They're some of the best TV you could ever hope to watch.",1149033600,4,13444,4.842403134523291

2043822,5,B0001Z3IPS,"It's funny looking at the reruns that Fox or the Comedy Network runs and notice your favorite Simpson classics. Surprising is when you find out they're actually from one entire season. There's so many classic episodes in Season 4, and many of them are actually on one whole disc. Here's a list of the highlights.

Season opener Kamp Krusty finds Bart and Lisa going to Kamp Krusty for the summer, only it's been taken over by Mr. Black and the Springfield bullies so it's pretty much the camp from hell. Marge enters a production of A Streetcar Named Desire which resembles the actual Simpson house. Meanwhile Maggie has an adventure in Ayn Rand's School for Tots, including a Great Escape scene complete with music. That scene where Homer discovers all the babies sucking on pacifiers still gets me everytime. In Homer the Heretic, Homer skips church and finds he has an awesome day, which upsets many, but surprisingly, Homer has some good(and possibly valid) reasons for skipping.

Bart is his usual destructive self until Maggie's life gets in danger. So usual lenient Homer decides to get serious: Bart can NEVER see the titular Itchy and Scratchy the Movie ever. Classic episode Mr. Plow finds Homer running a snow plowing business, until Barney steals his idea, prompting some revenge from Homer. The followups to the flashback episodes the Way We Was and I Married Marge, Lisa's First Word centers around wanting to get Maggie to talk, only prompting the story of Lisa's first word. Features a guest appearance by Elizabeth Taylor.

Another classic Marge vs. the Monorail finds the town having a surplus of money and deciding what to do so shady Lyle Lanley has an idea: building a monorail. Which is fine until they discover that other monorails met with disaster. Fan favorite Ralph Wiggum misinterprets a valentine from Lisa for the real thing, only she's not the remote bit interested. In Duffless, Homer quits beer for a month and actually losing weight, meanwhile Lisa makes Bart the subject of a science project: is Bart more smarter than a hamster?

Last Exit to Springfield(EW's pick for best episode ever) has Homer being a union president who fights for a dental plan since Lisa needs braces. Has a funny Homer's brain joke about Burns coming on to him and a Grinch spoof. The first but not the last Simpsons Clip Show finds Homer injured after an April Fool's Joke gone awry so they reminisce about past memories. Season finale Krusty Gets Kancelled finds Krusty on the losing side of Gabbo, a ventriloquist's dummy. After exposing Gabbo's um, offscreen attitude, Bart and Lisa decide to do a comeback special featuring many talents. Red Hot Chili Pepers, Bette Midler, Johnny Carson, Luke Perry, Hugh Hefner and Elizabeth Taylor provide guest voices.

So many memorable moments are on this from lines(""I call the big one Bitey"", ""I am Evil Homer"", ""you choo-choo choose me?"") to moments: Homer stopping the monorail using a donut, getting a glimpse into Homer's heart during Triple Bypass, the Mr. Plow rivalry(and song), and the catchy, funny and offensive New Orleans song from Streetcar.

It's debatable whether Season 4 or Season 5 is the best but regardless it's still one of their best seasons.",1133308800,3,3221,4.911764705882353

2043827,5,B0001Z3IPS,"As the fourth season of the Simpsons begins, one can see that it was taking the form, both in terms of visual style and comic irreverence, of the show that we all know and love today.  Like the above Amazon review states, many episodes in this set are considered some of the absolute best that creator Matt Groening and co. have to offer; including Bart, Lisa, and the rest of the Springfield kids going to a Krusty the Clown owned summer camp (""Kamp Krusty""), a deeply depressed (and annoyed by Homer more than usual) Marge taking the starring role in a play of ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" (the infamous ""A Streetcar Named Marge""), Homer quitting going to church (""Homer the Heretic""), Bart is forbidden to see the smash hit Itchy & Scratchy Movie (""Itchy & Scratchy: The Movie""), and of course, who could forget the classic ""Mr. Plow""?  Just about every episode here is a classic, including the unbelievably hilarious ""Treehouse of Horror"" Halloween episode in which Bart's Krusty doll comes to life and tries to kill Homer, there is a parody of King Kong (and we all know which family member is tailor made for that role), and Bart revives corpses which have a taste for human flesh.  The season finale, entitled ""Krusty Gets Kanceled"", finds Bart's TV hero out of a job, and he and Lisa help him get back on top with the help of an all star guest list of voices (Johnny Carson, Hugh Hefner, Bette Midler, and Elizabeth Taylor who also provides the voice of Maggie for her first word as well).  The usually sharp writing is at it's near peak here, and the voice cast is perfect, with special mention to the incredibly talented Hank Azaria who provides the voices for Kwik-E-Mart worker Apu and sleezy bartender Moe.

2043829,5,B0001Z3IPS,"If the third year of The Simpsons wasn't responsible for turning a regular show into a pop phenonenon, then this year was.  Some of the greatest episodes from the entire series occurred in Season 4, including ""Kamp Krusty"", ""Marge vs. the Monorail"", ""A Streetcar Named Marge"", ""Treehouse of Horror III"" (which includes one of the greatest dialogues in history, when Homer is in the Shop of Evil), ""I Love Lisa"", ""Last Exit to Springfield"", and the very first Simpsons clip show, hilariously entitled, ""So It Has Come To This: The Simpsons Clip Show"", which actually had a pretty good plot.

This year proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that this show was something new and different.  The overall edginess of the show came into light; the writers even had to apologize for some of the lyrics in the musical Oh!  Streetcar in the Streetcar Named Desire parody episode.

Matt Groening and company continue to impress this year.  The jokes and plots were at an all time high of quality, the guest stars were getting more and more recognizable (Leonard Nimoy makes his first appearance this year), and Homer keeps getting dumber.  The episodes contained in this set are must-sees for anyone, irregardless of whether or not you are a Simpsons fan.",1124496000,,1241,4.8254716981132075
2043830,5,B0001Z3IPS,"Season Four of the Simpsons is where the show truly came into its own.  The animation had matured from the awkward early seasons into something close to the style it's had ever since.  The characters were now fully formed.  The first writers had left for greener pastures, but they'd added Conan O'Brian -- who would be one of their best writers before late night TV took him away.  The show was still fresh original and slyly satirical.  These days it seems to want to either play it too safe or skate too obviously on the edge.  In these years, they had the balance just right.  I debated (a little) about buying the first few seasons.  This one was a no question purchase.

What I love about these episodes is that the writers paint in the corners, so to speak, milking every joke they can.  Homer's friends bring him a get well card with ""Danger!  DO NOT REMOVE!"" on the back.  When Bart mentions the father-son picnic, Homer laughs ""You don't have a son.""  A hilarious two-minute spoof of COPS.  Even a serious moment has to be leavened with humor.  Homer lays down the law with Bart -- just as Snake passes by with a stolen VCR and realized to his horror that it is a Betamax.

The writers also excel at turning what could be sappy melodramatic moments into funny touching ones.  Good writers can find humor in Bart and Lisa at ""Kamp Krusty"" (my personal favorite episode) or Homer founding a new religion (Homer the Heretic).  But who would have thought Homer having a heart attack would be hilarious?  Or that his hospital-bed speech to Bart and Lisa could be both funny and touching?

Perhaps I'm a little biased.  I'm about the same age as most of the writers on the show at this time, so the pop culture jokes hit home with me.  (I bet you no one born after 1976 understands the Krusty Olympic Burger joke).  But I still think the appeal should be universal.

So why buy the DVD's, you ask?  After all, the show is in syndication constantly.  Well, the picture and sound are great.  The shows are frequently cut in syndication, losing the most random - and frequently funniest - jokes.  The extra aren't amazing, but I do love the commentaries.  It's funny and interesting to hear the writers talk about how the show was put together, the fights they had with sensors, the humor that O'Brian added, the humanity that Jim Brooks added.  I do wish they'd included cast commentaries as in season three, but having O'Brian and Jon Lovitz drop in for the occasional comment makes up for that.

This is a must-buy for Simpsons fans, especially the younger ones who may not have seen the series in it early years, when it was -- without question -- the funniest and most daring show on TV.",1124150400,2,2693,4.50206611570248

2043832,5,B0001Z3IPS,"The fourth season isn't just TV, it's a thing of beauty.  These episodes are distinguished by one simple idea:  humor with heart.  This general unifying vision makes this season unique.  Watch the DVDs again and you will find that there is no substitute for characters with three dimensions.  They are the foundation for the biting social commentary, sparkling wit (not to be confused with ""cleverness!""), and legitimately funny situations that make the show entertaining and memorable.  Any Simpsons-on-DVD is worth owning, but this season is worth a deeper, more challenging look.  It's the pinnacle of animated TV.

I have to disagree with many reviewers (probably 'Family Guy' fans) when I say that the first three seasons had plenty of warmth and charm, and were far better than anything after season nine (at the latest).  I believe many fans are correct in their assumption, though, that the fourth season is where the humor really begins to shine.  For me, it's also where it peaked.  The fifth and sixth seasons both have fine moments (much like season three) but never achieve the balance of big humor and big heart that seems to operate in perfect equilibrium during the fourth.  After this season the show began to focus too heavily on random, silly situations and clever banter, which can be funny if used subtly and sparingly.  They are no match, however, for situation-based story and plot.  Situational humor isn't ""old-fashioned,"" it's good writing.  Quite simply, the show got too successful, and it slipped; when this happened, it was still approved by a public of humorist starving classes willing to settle for anything even resembling ""funny"" or ""intelligent"" (or just ""not-your-average-sitcom"").  In a flash, the three-dimensional characters we once knew and loved were gone.  Without lovable characters, TV comedy isn't worth much at all.

The third season was a good indication of where the show was going to go.  Episodes like ""When Flanders Failed"" are funny but also touching, and display genuinely interesting character development, especially in Homer.  Episodes like ""Flaming Moe's"" or ""Burns Verkaufen der Kraftwerk"" are really hilarious, and ""Bart the Lover,"" written by the genius Jon Vitti (a pillar of Simpsons greatness), is probably the best episode in the bunch.  So along comes Season Four, and the show really took off.  The magic of the fourth season is the delightful way in which the peripheral characters are employed.  Krusty and Mr. Burns, in particular, are riotously funny and distinctly three-dimensional.  Additionally, Chief Wiggum, Ralph, Selma, Barney, and Principal Skinner, to name a few, are all brilliantly and subtly developed.  Still, the five members of the Simpson family are the main characters of the show, especially Bart, who, for the first few years, is absolutely the best character, almost simultaneously overrated and underrated.  The humorous and at times tender brother/sister relationship between him and Lisa is a notable facet of the season.  In some episodes, their rapport is fairly obvious, as in ""Lisa's First Word,"" but it's there throughout:  Bart's memorable line ""You're not ugly"" in ""Lisa the Beauty Queen,"" or their hectic travels together in ""Kamp Krusty,"" or their Itchy and Scratchy cartoons in ""The Front.""  All really touching.

A few examples of this season's overwhelming greatness:  the completely laugh-out-loud musical number in ""A Streetcar Named Marge"" (which, incidentally, is one of the best parodies of community theatre other than Waiting for Guffman), Bart's falling in love with the ""New Kid on the Block,"" Homer's fake commercials in ""Mr. Plow,"" the insanely funny sandwich bit and Duff Gardens adventure in ""Selma's Choice,"" and Krusty trying to match his ventriloquist competition in ""Krusty Gets Kancelled.""  The crown jewels, however, are two episodes that aired exactly within one month of each other, and should be considered the greatest in the show's history:  ""I Love Lisa"" and ""Last Exit to Springfield.""  Excellently crafted with subtle wit and sharp, vitriolic social criticism, these episodes were written with a true sense of structure, pace, dialogue, etc., and showcase a rare combination of entertaining and thought-provoking humor.  Television simply doesn't get any better.  The absurd ""Monster Mash"" intro is a memorable one in ""I Love Lisa,"" the best in the history of the show; later on, Krusty's anniversary special has one terrific joke after another (I'm giggling about Robert Frost and Sideshow Rahim even as I write this), and Springfield Elementary's take on the US Presidency is uproarious.  ""Last Exit"" might be the overall best, though, especially when Mr. Burns and Homer get together in the mansion:  the line ""It doesn't take a wiz to see that you're looking out for number one!"" is one of the funniest things I have ever heard, representing how the show can be both high-brow and low-brow at once.  But these episodes aren't just streams of good chuckles and one-liners, they're much, much more.

Do yourself a favor and discover what the Simpsons accomplished back in Season Four.  The flat, one-dimensional characters and abundant random situations that plague the later years WILL NOT be remembered fondly when the show is long gone.  But THIS will.  Imagine:  it's back when Lisa wasn't so whiny, snobbish and pestering -- back when Homer was only mildly stupid, and when Marge was a great TV mom on par with June Cleaver -- and Bart was feisty and lovable.  They did it right once, and I have it on DVD for as long as I care to watch and laugh and learn.  Thanks for reading.",1121904000,11,5619,5.132013201320132
2043833,5,B0001Z3IPS,"This set simply rules. This one contains some of my favorite episodes. Homer skipping church, his triple bypass surgery, and the all-time great - his DWI episode. Well worth the purchase for any simpson fan.",1119052800,2,207,4.942857142857143
2043834,5,B0001Z3IPS,"Like Seinfeld, Cheers, Everybody Loves Raymond etc, The Simpsons started off strong, but really took up speed once the set-up seasons were done. Thus, when Home, Marge, Bart, Lisa, Maggie and Grandpa turned four, the show came into its own with classic episodes like Kamp Krusty, A Streetcar Named Marge, Homer the Heretic, Lisa the Beauty Queen, Treehouse of Horror III, Itchy & Scratchy: The Movie, Marge Gets a Job, New Kid on the Block, Mr. Plow, Lisa's First Word, Homer's Triple Bypass and Marge vs. the Monorail. Its a classic show that has remained at the top, and even though seasons 15 and 16 are below par, viewers across the world all love the characters, the gags and the wacky adventures that make The Simpsons a true TV classic. The DVD also has commentaries deleted scenes and more.",1118361600,2,798,4.748201438848921
2043835,5,B0001Z3IPS,"The fourth season of ""The Simpsons"" is perhaps the best.  The DVD set includes all 22 episodes and a load of extras - more than any prior collection.  Of course, the best extra is probably the episode commentaries.  The directors, writers, and producers are hilarious and insightful, especially Al Jean, Rich Moore, David Silver, and Matt Groening.  Conan O'Brien also joins in for an episode; he joined the writing staff in season four.  I also enjoy when some of the cast help out, especially Nancy Cartwright and Yeardley Smith.

Two of my all-time favorite Simpsons episodes are here.  Nevertheless, if you ask 10 Simpsons fans for their favorite from this season, you're likely to get 10 different responses.

""Marge vs. the Monorail"" features one of the best Phil Hartman characters, the scheming Lyle Lanley.  I particularly love the ""Music Man"" inspired monorail song -- Well, sir/ there's nothing on earth/ Like a genuine/ Bona fide/ Electrified/ Six car/ Monorail!

""A Streetcar Named Marge"" is another brilliant episode.  Marge finally decides to pursue some hobbies outside the family by joining a community theater group.  She makes a perfect wilting Blanche Dubois to Ned Flander's ""brutish"" Stanley.  The highlight of the episode may be the ""Oh Streetcar"" song, which completely vilifies New Orleans.

The set-up screens display a variety of different characters - when you select a feature, Marge might pull a pin out of her hair that causes it to deflate or Homer might get a plunger stuck on his head.  These little vignettes are cute, but they are somewhat slow and can get tiresome if you try to watch several episodes in a row.  Overall, however, I think Season 4 has the best features and set-up.  It's really a top notch DVD set.  Most highly recommended.",1117843200,3,1778,4.949324324324325
2043836,5,B0001Z3IPS,"The Complete Fourth Season of The Simpsons ran from September 1992 through until May 1993, and is a worthy DVD box set for any true comedy lover. This season is also the best of the four thus far as the show goes from strength to strength, becoming all the more aware of its phenomenal popularity. Matt Groening's wonderful creation continued to push the limits of where cartoons could go, and much of this can be seen in Season 4. The design for this box set is also the best of the first four, presented in a blue deluxe fold-out box that contains four discs with wonderful cartoons on them. They also connect with the animations in the background behind the plastic trays. There are cartoons of probably all the characters who have appeared more than once in the history of the show up until this point, which is cool.

Season 4 opens with ""Kamp Krusty,"" which sees Bart and Lisa struggling to escape Krusty's camp for kids which is a far cry from the fantasy land they expected. In ""A Streetcar Named Marge,"" Marge wins the lead in a musical production, but is annoyed by Homer's lack of interest. Maggie is placed in a daycare center and retrieves her pacifier after it is taken from her a la The Great Escape. ""Homer The Heretic"" sees Homer giving up on church to stay in bed on a Sunday morning. He accidentally burns the house down and is saved by the local fire station, thinking it an act of God. In ""Lisa The Beauty Queen,"" Lisa comes second place in a beauty contest, but when the winner is involved in a freak accident, Lisa steps up as Little Miss Springfield. When the cigarette company that sponsors the event asks her to promote their product, however, she is faced with a terrible dilemma. In ""Treehouse Of Horror III,"" a Krusty clown goes berserk in the Simpson home, Marge is wooed by a giant ape, and Lisa's attempt to bring back her dead cat turns the town of Springfield into a pack of zombies. In ""Itchy & Scratchy: The Movie,"" Homer forbids Bart from seeing the new Itchy & Scratchy movie to teach him a lesson about his bad behavior.

In ""Marge Gets A Job,"" Marge gets a job at the power plant alongside Homer. Burns falls madly in love with her, and kidnaps her idol Tom Jones to win her over. When this fails, he tells Homer to always take care of her. In ""New Kid On The Block,"" Bart falls in love with the teenage daughter of a single mum who moves in next door to the Simpsons. Unfortunately, she has a crush on Jimbo Jones so Bart must come up with a plan for her to dump him. Meanwhile, Homer sues an all-you-can-eat seafood restaurant when they kick him out before he finishes eating. In ""Mr. Plow,"" Homer starts a thriving snowplow business only to have his best friend Barney rival him with an even more successful business in snowplowing. Homer is so jealous he sends Barney into an avalanche and certain death, until he repents and risks his own life to save him. In ""Lisa's First Word,"" we see the birth of Lisa in a flashback episode, and how Bart's jealousy turns towards her. We also hear Maggie's first word, although no one else does. In ""Homer's Triple Bypass,"" Homer has a heart attack leaving him near death. He must get a bypass operation, but is only able to afford the cut-rate doctor Nick Riviera.

In ""Marge Vs. The Monorail,"" Lyle Lanley sells the people of Springfield a monorail. Homer is thrilled to be the conductor, but only Marge can see that Lyle wants to make money fast and that the monorail will crash on its first run. In ""Selma's Choice,"" Selma develops an urge for a child before it's too late. However, after she takes Bart and Lisa to the Duff Gardens theme park, Selma scratches her maternal itch with a pet iguana. In ""Brother From The Same Planet,"" Bart decides to get a big brother after Homer is late picking him up from soccer practice. Out of jealousy Homer gets a little brother and gets in a huge fight with Bart's big brother. Meanwhile, Lisa runs up an extortionate phone bill calling a 900-line run by a teen film star. In ""I Love Lisa,"" Lisa gives Ralph a valentine because no one else does. He develops a huge crush on her, which ends badly after she reveals live on the Krusty 29th Anniversary Special that she doesn't feel the same. In ""Duffless,"" Homer is arrested for driving while intoxicated after skipping work for a Duff Brewery tour. He goes a whole month without beer, much to Marge's delight. In ""Last Exit To Springfield,"" Lisa discovers she needs braces. At the same time, Burns removes the dental plan from the plant employees' benefits, forcing Homer to become union leader. They go on strike and Burns tries to run the plant by robots.

In ""So It's Come To This: A Simpsons Clip Show,"" Bart plays an April Fools joke on Homer which lands him in a coma. The family reminisces about the past while waiting at Homer's bedside. In ""The Front,"" Bart and Lisa write scripts for Itchy & Scratchy after the show begins to lose its shine. They use Grandpa's name and pass him off as the writer, as scripts by children are not taken seriously. In ""Whacking Day,"" the town prepares for its annual ritual of whacking snakes with sticks. Lisa is determined to stop this barbaric act, and with the help of Bart and Barry White, she succeeds. Meanwhile, Bart is kicked out of school and home-schooled by Marge. In ""Marge In Chains,"" a flue epidemic sweeps Springfield, forcing Marge to look after her family. She is so distracted that she unintentionally steals from the Kwik-E-Mart and is sent to a women's prison. The town soon realises Marge's importance to society, however, and she is released. The final episode of the season is ""Krusty Gets Kancelled."" A rival TV show starring an incredibly talented ventriloquist's dummy forces Krusty off the air. Bart and Lisa round up a number of celebrity guests for Krusty's comeback show which is a huge success. This episode flexes the muscles of the show's awesome star power, with guest voice appearances by Johnny Carson, Bette Midler, Hugh Hefner, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Luke Perry, Elizabeth Taylor and Barry White.

By this point in The Simpsons, after only four years, critics were rightly hailing it as one of the greatest shows of all time. There was a lot of controversy surrounding the way American life is portrayed to the rest of the world through this show, but when it's being broadcast in more than 100 countries, getting viewing ratings of around 200 million worldwide, and grossing a cool $1 billion for the FOX Network, there was no way this show was going to get cancelled. The Simpsons is a force of nature, and one of the most intelligent shows ever. It's actually very educational, especially when it comes to comedy and sociology. The Complete Fourth Season is a must own for any true comedy lover.",1116633600,,6758,4.572607260726072
2043837,5,B0001Z3IPS,"Here are ten reasons why season 4 of the Fox animated series The Simpsons is quite possibly the funniest season of comedy ever on television:

1). Troy McClure: ""Hello everybody. I'm Troy McClure, star of such films as ""P is for Psycho"" and ""The President's Neck is Missing.""

2.) Apu: ""I have a shrine to Ganesha, the god of worldly wisdom, located in the employee lounge.""

Homer: ""Hey, Ganesha, want a peanut?

Apu: ""Please do not offer my god a peanut.""

3.) Krusty, lending his pre-taped support to the Little Miss Springfield Pageant: ""I heartily endorse this event or product.""

4.) Bart, after Homer kills Flanders, who has been turned into a zombie: ""Dad, you just killed the Zombie-Flanders!""

Homer: ""He was a zombie?""

5.) Captain Kirk, in Star Trek XII: So Very Tired: ""Captain's Log, Stardate 6051. Had trouble sleeping last night...my hiatal hernia is acting up. The ship is drafty and damp. I complain, but nobody listens.""

6.) Barney, waving goodbye to Adam West as he drives away in the Batmobile: ""So long, Superman!""

7.) Chief Wiggum: ""This is Papa Bear. Put out an APB for a male suspect, driving a...car of some sort. Heading in the direction of, um, you know, that place that sells chili. The suspect is hatless. I repeat...hatless!""

8.) Homer, telling Marge about the family of possums that live in the rotted innards of the Springfield monorail: ""I call the big one, Bitey!""

9.) TV Announcer: ""The following is a public service announcement. Excessive alcohol consumption can cause liver damage and cancer of the rectum.""

Homer. ""Mmmm, beer.""

10.) Bart, watching Homer attempt to remove a plunger stuck to his head: ""What are you going to change your name to when you grow up?'

Lisa: ""Lois Sanborn.""

Bart: ""Steve Bennett.""

OK, Number 10 is a personal choice. When that episode (The Front) aired in April 1993, I knew someone named Steve Bennett. And when Bart, who had become America's favorite underachiever, uttered Steve's name, he was the envy of all who knew him. I'm not sure if Steve ever found a way to record the line onto his phone answering machine, but if not, he should still be trying.

As much as Season 3 saw The Simpsons find its groove in terms of the writing, animation, timing and vocal performance, Season 4 was when the show achieved a level of humor and sophistication that no sitcom has ever matched. It became rife with pop culture and political references. Steamboat Willie (the first cartoon featuring Mickey Mouse), Franklin Roosevelt, A Streetcar Named Desire and supposed Communist Alger Hiss all worked their way into episodes. Creatively, the show seemed completely locked in: from the jokes (which seemed to come faster than the sitcom average of three-a-minute), to the music, by underappreciated Simpsons composer Alf Clausen. Like Season 3, the storylines were occasionally silly, but the show was never ashamed to have the family show affection for one another and no one completely broke character because it would help sell an episode. In total, Season 4 represents the Golden Age of the Simpsons' brand of comedy and Fox Home Video's 4-disc set, The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season is an essential purchase for anyone who claims to love TV comedy.

The episodes included are Kamp Krusty, A Streetcar Named Marge, Homer the Heretic, Lisa the Beauty Queen, Treehouse of Horror III, Itchy & Scratchy: The Movie, Marge Gets a Job, New Kid on the Block, Mr. Plow, Lisa's First Word, Homer's Triple Bypass, Marge vs. the Monorail, Selma's Choice, Brother from the Same Planet, I Love Lisa, Duffless, Last Exit to Springfield, So It's Come to This: A Simpsons Clip Show, The Front, Whacking Day, Marge in Chains and Krusty Gets Kancelled.

Video: How Does The Disc Look?

As with the previous three Simpsons DVD releases, Season 4 is presented in its original TV aspect ratio of 4:3. In the early 90s, the show was still totally hand drawn, as opposed to computer assisted. As such, object outlines do have a hand-drawn feel and background colors can waver ever so minutely. But (minor) flaws and all, color is accurately represented on the DVD. After all, unless Fox wants to commission a completely useless frame-by-frame restoration, these discs will never be better than their source material. All colors are as saturated as they were when originally drawn: the Simpson family has the deeper colors, the yellow of their skin or the blue of Marge's hair. Obviously, no color strays past its outline and every color has a nice smoothness. Print flaws get increasingly rare as the series continues and here there is nary a spot or a speck. Darker backgrounds, like the night sky or the blue set of Krusty's Comeback Special have just a smidge of haze, but that's just nitpicking. Contrast is good and detail, so essential to a sneaky show like The Simpsons, is getting better with every DVD release. There are no compression artifacts to be found, even during the slower fades. The shows looks great and as subsequent seasons are released, and computer-assisted animation takes over, the show threatens to look almost perfect.

Audio: How Does The Disc Sound?

Once again, Fox has provided a nice, if slightly unnecessary 5.1 Dolby Digital mix. It does seem as if there is more play with the directional effects than in previous DVD releases. The sound of characters running across the room will travel from left to right. The songs are a bit fuller than last season and dialogue is cleaner and less mushy than in previous DVD releases. When watching the show on TV, characters talk so fast and are mixed with music and effects that sometimes dialogue is hard to understand. This is not a problem on the DVD, as dialogue comes like a laser, usually from the center speaker. No one will ever mistake a Simpsons DVD (or Simpsons episode on TV) as an enveloping aural experience, but what's provided here is true to the show and true to the original presentation.

Episodes also include French and Spanish Dolby 2.0 surround tracks. Subtitles are available in French and Spanish, along with English Closed Captions.

Supplements: What Goodies Are There?

There are more supplements on these 4 discs than there are jars of expired baby food at the Kwik-E-Mart. Luckily, as the program got more popular, it became better documented. One of the few complaints about the first three DVD sets was that there's scant little information on how an episode is created and how the voices are recorded. More of the former is presented here, while the latter will always be a beautiful, never-realized dream (Note to Fox: The Holy Grail of Simpsons supplements will be having the voice over recording in the corner of the screen while the episode plays out). Barring that, here we go:

Disc One begins with a Word from Matt Groening, which involves the show's creator introducing the set by voicing over some clips.

The meat of the first disc are the audio commentaries, which are provided for every episode: Kamp Krusty, A Streetcar Named Marge, Homer the Heretic and Lisa the Beauty Queen. For Kamp Krusty, the producers admitted that co-creator Matt Groening liked the episode so much, he wanted to save the plotline for the Simpsons movie. But the producers had enough problems getting the episode to its minimum length, let alone padding it out to 80 minutes. Also, Jon Lovitz joins in on the audio commentary for A Streetcar Named Marge.

Elsewhere on Disc One, we've got Art and Animation: A Streetcar Named Marge. Clicking that option reveals a submenu that includes Animatic Showcase, where a section of the finished episode shares screen space with the animatic and the storyboards. Use the Angle button to decide which element gets the full-screen. This allows you to see how much the episode changed during the long production process. You can also watch just the animatic by itself or with audio commentary by Rich Moore and David Silverman. You can also see the episode with just full-frame storyboards, accompanied by the final voice recordings.

The Cajun Controversy is a two-minute look at how the city of New Orleans (over)reacted to seeing their fair city lambasted in the episode A Streetcar Named Marge. Writer Jeff Martin narrates this brief, but fun look. Martin wrote the lyrics himself and he explains that Sweeney Todd starts with a song that denigrates London and that Martin was ""just copying that. I certainly wasn't setting out to insult New Orleans.""

Special Language Feature: Kamp Krusty gives us the entire episode in your choice of Brazilian Portuguese, Italian, Japanese or Castilian Spanish. However, instead of taking the time to find this menu, just play the episode and cycle through with your Audio button.

Next is Bush vs. Simpson. Narrated by series co-creator Jim Brooks, it recounts a 1990 People Magazine story about then-First Lady Barbara Bush that claimed ""She loves American's Funniest Home Videos but remains baffled after sampling The Simpsons. ""'It was the dumbest thing I had ever seen', she says."" Brooks sent a response to Mrs. Bush, that is read in its entirety by Julie Kavner, the voice of Marge Simpson. It reads, in part, ""I try to teach my children Bart, Lisa and even little Maggie always to give somebody the benefit of the doubt and not talk badly about them, even if they're rich. It's hard to get them to understand this advice when the very First Lady in the country calls us not only dumb, but 'the dumbest thing' she ever saw."" Surprisingly, on October 9, 1990, Mrs. Bush replied. Her remarks included the line, ""how kind of you to write. I'm glad you spoke your mind, I foolishly didn't know you had one."" She ends with ""please forgive a loose tongue."" The ""feud"" culminated with President George H.W. Bush speaking to a convention of religious broadcasters and saying American families need to be more like the Waltons and less like the Simpsons. It's a neat, 5-minute piece and Brooks remembers the feud with respect and good humor towards the First Family.

Finally on Disc One is Promotional Stuff, which is a 13-minute Fox-generated look at how the Simpsons is produced. Fans of the show will want to skip the first half, which recounts old information about how the show came to be. The second half includes brief clips of table reads and voice over sessions.

Disc Two contains more audio commentary for all the episodes, Treehouse of Horror III, Itchy & Scratchy: The Movie, Marge Gets a Job, New Kid on the Block, Mr. Plow and Lisa's First Word. The commentary for New Kid on the Block includes talk show host Conan O'Brien who participated from New York, while the other audio commentators were recorded simultaneously in Los Angeles. By the fourth season, writers began to leave the show and had to be replaced. O'Brien was hired after two other writers turned it down. The participants reminisce about O'Brien's horrible office (which is now a storage room) and how he was constantly energetic and funny, no matter how many hours they had worked that day.

Also on Disc Two are four TV commercials, which can be played individually or all at once. They include 2 Simpsons promos, a Butterfinger spot and a KFC spot. More interesting is Animation Showcase: Itchy & Scratchy The Movie. As in the other Animation Showcases, you can watch the episode unfold in storyboard form and compare it to the finished product.

Disc Three contains audio commentaries for every episode, Homer's Triple Bypass, Marge vs. the Monorail, Selma's Choice, Brother from the Same Planet, I Love Lisa and Duffless. There are two audio commentaries for Marge vs. the Monorail. The second one includes Conan O'Brien, who wrote the episode. According to O'Brien, Marge vs. The Monorail was the third idea he ever pitched after being hired. He also talks of how he'd crack up the staff by filling his mouth with Coke and then shaking his head until foam came out of his mouth. It's a fun commentary, probably the best on the entire four-disc set.

Other extras on Disc Three include four Deleted Scenes from Homer's Triple Bypass. Frankly, these discs should include many more deleted scenes, but we'll take what we can get. None are over 16 seconds are none are particularly funny. A fun option is to watch the finished episode with the deleted scenes inserted in their proper place. Also check Art & Animation from Homer's Triple Bypass. This includes an animatic showcase similar to the one A Streetcar Named Marge. You can also watch just the animatic, with or without an audio commentary from David Silverman and Rich Moore. What's interesting here is that Silverman is equipped with a telestrator, similar to the one used on Monday Night Football. However, he only uses it once, at the very beginning of the episode.

The final disc contains audio commentary for all episodes, Last Exit to Springfield, So It's Come to This: A Simpsons Clip Show, The Front, Whacking Day, Marge in Chains and Krusty Gets Kancelled. As in the other commentaries, everyone seems very happy to be there and they impart lots of fun tidbits. Krusty Gets Kancelled, is notable for all the celebrity voice involved, including Johnny Carson and Bette Midler. By that time in the show's history, there was a backlog of famous folks who wanted to do a voice. But of course, when the call actually came, everyone was too busy or out of town. In fact, they were a day away from scrapping the celebrity angle of the episode. Disc Four also includes six deleted scenes from The Front, none over 25 seconds. As in the deleted scenes from Homer's Bypass, you can watch the episode with the excised bits seamlessly reinserted. The other extra is Art & Animation: So It's Come to This: A Simpsons Clip Show. This includes yet another Animation Showcase, in which deft handling of the Angle button provides the ability to simultaneously watch the storyboards, animatics and the finished episode. You can also watch the episode with finished audio over full-frame storyboards. Or, if you choose, finished audio with full-frame animatics.

The whole magilla comes in the same type of packaging as the other Simpsons boxed sets. This time, the color of the cardboard packaging is a cobalt blue. The menu system includes lots of brief, :06-:10 animations that take the viewer from menu to submenu to sub-submenu. Although the animations are funny, it does get tiresome to have to constantly sit through them, especially considering how deep the menu system is. Next time, let's just go quickly from menu to submenu, eh Fox?

DVD-ROM Exclusives: What do you get when you pop the disc in your PC?

There are no ROM extras on the disc.

Parting Thoughts

If you're a fan of The Simpsons and don't immediately buy this disc, you are not a fan of the Simpsons. During season 4, the show moved effortlessly from just plain hilarious to one of the funniest shows ever on television. As for the DVD, the extras are getting more interesting and every audio commentary is worth a listen. Additionally, the video and audio are slightly improved over previous releases. So, to paraphrase Bart in the episode Kamp Krusty, ""my chunky brothers! Gorge yourselves at the trough of The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season!""

2043842,5,B0001Z3IPS,"Originally a spin-off from a one-minute segment of The Tracy Ullman Show, The Simpsons morphed into the then-burgeoning FOX network's most successful program. As the longest running animated television show in history, and the longest running prime show of any type, The Simpsons is an American treasure - a combination of humor, wit, and satire that examines not just the lives of its eccentric characters, but also the society, culture, and world in which we live. Fun for adults and children alike, The Simpsons is a cutting edge television comedy that, like Seinfeld, changed the television landscape in the 1990's by creating a new genre of TV fun - spawning large network investments in new series such as King of the Hill, Futurama, and The Family Guy.

Like all new things which smash the paradigm of life, The Simpsons is unrivaled by its knockoffs, and the show doesn't show signs of slowing down. If you haven't yet visited Springfield, then I definitely recommend that you pick up The Simpsons DVD (Season 1) to catch a glimpse for yourself. You have no idea what you've been missing...

The Simpsons (Season 4) DVD offers a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""Kamp Krusty"" in which Bart forges his report card so that Homer and Marge will allow him to go to Kamp Krusty, a traditional summer camp for America's youth. But the summer camp is anything but traditional, and the kids soon learn as they're forced to make cheap wallets and perform other acts usually reserved for Third World foreign laborers. The kids endure until it's revealed that Krusty will not be visiting as promised, the news of which prompts Bart to spark an uprising... Other notable episodes from Season 4 include ""Itchy & Scratchy: The Movie"" in which Bart's punishment (that he can not see the new Itchy & Scratchy movie) threatens to drive him to the brink of insanity, and ""Duffless"" in which Homer's arrest for a DWI forces him to submit to a campaign of anti-drinking films and AA meetings (made all the worse by Marge's request that he quit drinking for one month)...

2043843,5,B0001Z3IPS,"I have been watching the Simpsons religously since the Tracy Ullman Show and in my opinion, this is the best season ever!",1113696000,,121,4.545454545454546
2043844,1,B0001Z3IPS,"I watched a lot of Simpsons as a kid, then moved away from home in the mid-90s, didn't watch any TV, grew up, etc.  Last year I picked up the Season 3 DVD when it came out, half-expecting to be disappointed, fearing the show could never live up to my fond memories.  Instead I was really impressed.  It was just as funny as I remembered it (which is rare).

So I bought Season 4.  Oy vay.  There is a subtle but tremendous change in the show at this point.  The most obvious thing---and the writers make no bones about this in the commentary---is the amount of filler material.  (In Season 3, the shows were always too long & had to be cut.  But in Season 4 they were too short and had to be stretched, usually via simple, unfunny repitition.)  This alone tells you that the well was running dry.

But that's not the only thing:  The jokes are more obvious.  Most of them aren't funny.  There's a new reliance on lewdness, which (on TV) is always a sign that genuine humor is fading.  The plots are dumb and inconsistent.  There are way too many schticky devices like flashbacks and movie parodies, as if the show could be funny just by being ""Simpsons-y.""  Worst of all, the show loses much of its its cynical, anti-establishment sensibility in this season, and begins for the first time to seem corporate.

You get the feeling that you're watching the work of talented people who aren't really trying.  They had an undeniably successful show, they suddenly seemed to realize it, and they all leaned back and loosened their ties a little.  Well, good for them ... but the show really suffered.  The contrast with Season 3 is remarkable.

There are some high points here---Conan O'Brien's episodes, for example, tend to be very good (he was hungry)---but overall, this was the season when the Simpsons began its plunge into the swamp of cliche and mediocrity it would soon call home.",1113264000,6,1883,4.558208955223881

2043846,5,B0001Z3IPS,"The wonderful quality of the episodes in this set has already been well described by other reviewers and I couldn't agree with them more.

I was a little disapointed with one detailed aspect of this set, however: the menus are pretty lame. At least they are when compared to the third season boxed set. The season three set had, on the main menu, the couch with around ten or twelve randomized variations that were all pretty cool. The season four set looks a little more like an after thought, like a standardized screen with a small Simpsons character inserted at lower left that would do one of two or three animations. I know I'm quibbling over a detail, but unfortunately, with four to six episodes per disc, you end up having to see these menus a lot and they take time to run their little schtick, and after the first couple of times it gets really old - REALLY OLD to the point of an embarrassing annoyance, whereas the season three disc seemed like a richer design that never got old.

Okay, that's my beef. This is a collection of awesome episodes - hands down. My criticism of the menus shouldn't deter anyone from buying this, I just wish that fox had put the same level of effort into the total package for season four that went into season three.",1106438400,2,1260,4.473913043478261
2043847,3,B0001Z3IPS,"I think the commentators need to think about what they're supposed to be doing.  They spend so much time talking about things unrelated to the show they are watching.  When they DO talk about a show, it becomes obvious that they are watching them out of order as they spend way too much time thinking about past episodes.  In Whacking Day, they try to remember if they ever had Richard Nixon in a show before.  Well, if they had watched them in order, they would have seen Richard Nixon in Duffless.

When I listen to the commentary, I'm hoping to gain insight into the episode, (like obscure references or autobiographical animating).  I don't care about the office conditions for Conan O'Brien.",1105488000,5,696,4.710743801652892

2043849,5,B0001Z3IPS,"Season Four was the beginning of the best for the Simpsons.  Sure, there were a few flashes of brilliance in season three (Flaming Moes, for instance) but real Simpsons fans know that the show went from being simply entertaining to undisputable classic in season four.  Episodes like The Monorail, A Streetcar Named Marge, Last Exit to Springfild, Homer the Heretic, and Mr. Plow were all so original, funny, and smart that even Simpsons haters have to give them a little credit.

In my opinion, season four was the the beginning of the golden age of the Simpsons which lasted until about season ten, when the show became more dependent on guest stars, exotic locales, and nonsensical plots.  The show is dying now, slowly, like an old man easing into a nice, warm bath, but at least we'll always have the DVD's.  Some might argue that season three deserves to be part of the golden age.  I'll admit that season three includes some gems, but the show was still solidifying its characters and finding its niche in popular culture.  Season four was the first year the show was able to stand on its own legs.  When I was about ten years old, I remember recording some of the shows in seasons three and four and watching them over and over again.  Even at that age, when most of the jokes were over my head, I knew The Simpsons was something special, which indeed it has proven itself to be.  I'm not a big fan of the commentaries and extras on the discs.  If you're into that stuff, then help yourself; there's plenty.  But the DVD's are worth the price.  We have witnessed the greatest television show in the history of the universe mature and evolve right before our eyes, as the DVD's prove.  Enjoy!",1104796800,11,1699,4.564356435643564
2043850,5,B0001Z3IPS,"I'm sure I'm not the first one to say this, but I always thought that this season was the beginning of the best episodes the Simpsons ever made!  I always called them the Conan O'Brien Years because that was when he started writing for the show. He wrote one of my favorite episodes, ""The Monorail"".  There are so many good episodes. So many funny scenes and quotable lines that are said everyday by avid fans, and even the occasional watcher. This Dvd set is great, a good gift for a friend, and I can't wait for season five, because the Simpsons keep getting better!",1102896000,5,568,4.451923076923077

2043852,5,B0001Z3IPS,"Rating a season of the Simpsons is a futile endeavor.  The Simpsons is great, possibly the most entertaining 23 minutes and change on TV ever, bar none.

Para iniciados y avanzados en escala Bart del 1 al 10 lejos......un veinte.",1101513600,5,551,4.8
2043854,5,B0001Z3IPS,"In my ever-so-humble opinion, Season 4 represents the acme of the Simpsons television show.  Don't get me wrong - everything up to season 10 is funnier than anything else on TV - but Season 4 is the best of the best.  The shows are packed with jokes in all forms - visual, verbal, puns, innuendo, and crude bathroom fare.  The plots are thick - there are often several subplots happening simultaneously.  And finally, there's the cutaways - musings (Homer talking to his brain), flashbacks, fantasies, etc. - that are consistently hilarious and insightful.

Using the same ranking criteria that I would use for the first three seasons, every episode would rank special mention.  Therefore, I'll be a little more selective in what are the highlights of the highlights:

Last Exit to Springfield - Mr. Burns tries to cut the power plant employees' dental plan, so Homer leads them on strike after learning that Lisa needs braces.  For my money, the greatest episode in the series (and for many others - it routinely wins ""Best Episode Ever"" polls).

Homer the Heretic - Homer starts his own religion after God appears to him in a dream.

Marge vs. the Monorail - Springfield is conned into buying a monorail in this Music Man parody.  Leonard Nimoy makes the first of several memorable guest appearances.

Selma's Choice - After Homer gets food poisoning (in what is the funniest subplot in the series), Aunt Selma takes Lisa and Bart to Duff Gardens as a test drive to see how good a mother she'd be.

A Streetcar Named Marge - Marge and Ned star as Madge and Stanley in Oh! Streetcar! (The Musical).  John Lovitz is brilliant as the obsessive director.

Homer's Triple Bypass - Homer needs a coronary artery bypass but can't afford the cost, so goes to cut-rate surgeon Nick Riviera.

New Kid on the Block - Bart sabatoges his babysitter's date with Jimbo because he has a crush on her.  Meanwhile, Homer gets kicked out of an all-you-can-eat buffet and decides to sue the restaurant.

Lisa's First Word - a flashback episode that tells the story of how Bart dealt with the pregnancy of his mother and birth of his sister.

Such a list doesn't even begin to suggest the joys each and every episode brings.  Even the much maligned clip show has some great moments, such as Homer imagining himself as a pagan burning Flanders, the Christian Missionary, on the first April Fool's Day.

So why buy the DVD edition if the Simpsons is available every hour of every day if you have a basic cable package?  Well, most important is the lack of commercials and the ability to watch the episodes completely uncut.  There are also some neat extras, not the least of which being the audio commentaries on every episode.  After 100 or so episodes, some of the commentaries are somewhat thin, but others include guests such as Conan O'Brien and John Lovitz, which are as entertaining as the shows themselves.

If you only buy one Simpson's disc, make it this one.  If you only show one episode to a skeptic of the show, make it Lisa's Substitute from Season 2  But A Streetcar Named Marge would be an excellent second choice.  Unless the person you're showing it to is from New Orleans.",1100563200,31,3171,4.685352622061483
2043855,4,B0001Z3IPS,"The four stars are for the incomparable genius of the Simpsons, and for being able to watch them hit their historic stride in seasons 3-8 without commercial interruption and/or syndication's editorial slaughter.

The one non-star is for the slackedness of the DVD creation team over at 20th Century Fox. I got my Season 3 in the mail a couple days ago (WOOHOO!), more than 12 months after getting my Season 2 (D'OH!).

So, I am calling them out! It is time to get on the ball, folks. When I heard, a few years back, that the DVD sets were coming out, I was ecstatic. ""I can finally get rid of my closet full of 8-hour VHS tapes filled with commercial-interrupted episodes"", I said. The wonders of DVD would finally come home! But since then, I have become increasingly frustrated (and I know that I am certainly not alone, by any stretch) at the pace of the releases. Honestly speaking, by the time the seasons get into the double digits, DVD technology will have gone the way of the 8-track, and it will all be digital files purchased online, and I will never have my precious full DVD set. I'd settle for 1-8, but even that might never happen.

I'm not sure what's going on over there at Fox, but waiting another year is a travesty, my friends! Yes, the Season 3 DVD set is very well-made. But perhaps you could exchange some of the eye-candy DVD menu animation for increased production speed?",1100217600,4,1395,4.527777777777778
2043856,5,B0001Z3IPS,"The Simpsons may well be the best TV sit-com ever. The weird thing there is that you rarely see it mentioned on great sit-com lists.  Currently, the show is in its 16th season, which should lead to the assumption that it would get it some mention on those lists. But for some reason it doesn't.

I think other great shows like Seinfeld, M*A*S*H, All in the Family, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Barney Miller, I Love Lucy, Cheers, The Cosby Show, The Honeymooners, The Dick Van Dyke Show, Friends, Get Smart, Sex in the City, The Jefferson's, etc.  All of which should be mentioned on a list of great Situation Comedy, but the Simpsons should get mentioned.

The major reason that the Simpson's probably doesn't often get mentioned is that it is an animated show.  Animation does not get a lot of respect.  The second big reason I would think is the Simpson's make fun of everything, and doesn't give itself a lot of respect. It has a postmodern look at the world and itself, and that is what a lot of the fans love about the show, but what a lot of other people just ""don't get"".

The fourth season of the Simpsons has often been called the best of any of its seasons.  I don't know about that, but it does include episodes like:

Homer the Heretic

A Streetcar Named Marge

Selma' Choice

Kamp Krusty

Mr. Plow

Marge vs. The Monorail

Homer's Triple Bypass

Itchy & Scratchy: The Movie

Whacking Day

Krusty Gets Kancelled

All of them are among the (pause) best (pause) episodes (pause) ever.  The Simpson's are cool and you aren't cool unless you think the Simpson's are cool.  Which, of course, means you aren't cool.  If you don't understand that line of reasoning, then you should just move on to some other show.  If you do get that, then you'll love the Simpson's.

The other thing I like about the DVD's is the commentary on each of the episodes that includes Matt Groening, Al Jean, Mike Reiss, James L. Brooks, and a good number of the Cast, Writers, and even a few with Conan O'Brien on them.  Each episode is uncut.  Nothing is cut out to make room from more commercials, which is a common occurrence in syndicated shows.  You also get some outtakes and other features that are kind of cool.

All in all, one of the best ""seasons"" of any TV program that has been put out on DVD.",1100044800,4,2290,4.439903846153846
2043857,5,B0001Z3IPS,"After fifteen seasons of which four are now on DVD, there is only so much that can be said about ""The Simpsons"" DVD collections, so I'll keep this fairly brief.  That said, Season 4 is worth reviewing in that it completes the evolution that began in Season 3.  Voices and figures have achieved their familiar standards, and from Season 4 forward, advances in animation and coloring are incremental rather than great leaps forward.  Moreover, satire/movie/book tributes and music begin to take a bigger, and more familiar role in Season 4.

Which brings us to the highlights of the season.  ""Kamp Krusty"" beautifully subverts the traditional miserable summer camp milieu and pays tribute to ""Lord of the Flies"".  Season 4 features some of Homer's greatest episodes including ""Homer the Heretic"", ""Mr. Plow"", ""Duffless"", and ""Whacking Day"".  Fans are also treated to two of the best Simpsons' musical moments in ""A Streetcar Named Marge"" and ""Marge vs. the Monorail"".

The DVD's themselves continue to refine the major improvements witnessed in Season 3.  As usual, color and sound are excellent, and episodes edited for syndication have been returned to their full length.  New to this set is a series of on screen icons that appear during the episodes and allow links to deleted scenes, animatics, etc.  While a little awkward, they represent a step forward in DVD extra content, and I fully expect they will be greatly improved upon in Season 5.  In addition, all content is accessible from the DVD menus, so the icons need not be used at all.

Likewise, the extras are a nice step forward from the previous seasons.  In particular, there are far more deleted scenes than in the prior sets.  I imagine this is due to the more established nature of the show by the fourth season, and the greater resources it could command.  Some of the scenes are really funny, and I would hope they will become even more prevalent in future seasons.

My only other comment would be that these sets should be viewed as items for the diehard fan.  From start to finish there may not be a more solid season than Season 4, and the episodes are certainly accessible to the casual fan.  Moreover, considering the volume of content, they are very reasonably priced, and hence would make a great purchase for even the casual fan.

2043860,5,B0001Z3IPS,"What a DVD. Season 4 is easily the best of the bunch thus far, and if you are at all a Simpsons fan, you MUST purchase it! It perfectly reflects why I hold 'The Simpsons' as my favorite TV show of all time.

There are so many great episodes here, it's unbelievable. You've got three of 'The Simpsons' great directors working on this one: Rich Moore, Mark Kirkland, Jim Reardon, as well as other greats Carlos Baeza, Wes Archer, David Silverman, Jeff Lynch. I mention the three in a different category only because their episodes in particular ooze dripping quality through every animated cell, but truly, the others listed are nearly just as good. Then, of course there is the fantastic writing, courtesy of a handful of brilliant comedic minds.

My personal favorite episodes -- and it's really so difficult, there are so many -- are probably those directed by the three directors listed above. It's quite interesting too, as most of the directors had been with the show from the first and second seasons, so you can really get a glimpse of them really finding their niche. The dry-wit and cynicism is ever-growing, and the jokes really do come at you at breakneck speed. The animation, which HAS to be credited for the show's uproarious laugh count, has really become sublime. And I don't just mean camera angles and backgrounds, but even more so character expressions and movement, which add infinite substance to the already great writing and voice acting. It all gels together so beautifully by this point, it's a sight to behold.

The commentaries, while not ""that"" interesting, are fun to listen to, and I've been through them all about twice. I just like hearing the guys (primarily Groening, Jean, and Reiss) talk about a great show whilst watching it. It's a very enjoyable experience. Interesting commentaries worth noting are the two in which Conan O'Brien appears; it's quite obvious the rest of the crew hold the man in sort sort of awe, as they laugh (appropriately) at his every word. The same could be said for Jon Lovitz, who is hysterical always, and the one audio track he has (""A Streetcar Named Marge"") is appalingly funny, enough for me to go out and get the ""Critic"" DVD simply to hear him talk spontaneously (and make homosexual remarks to Jean and Reiss).

All in all, this is just a great step up from the seasons before it. By this point, the show had lost most of its emotional value, but its the comedic strength that made this show what it was, not the more sentimental aspects (though those are always intact and certainly shouldn't be dismissed). It's also probably the most endearing show I've ever seen, and even though it's the biting, jaded cynisicm that I come back for, the show ultimately holds a dear place in my scathed heart.",1098144000,9,2768,4.72463768115942

First;  Folks are complaining that it takes too long for the next menu or the episode to play when a selection is made due to the animated characters doing their antics.  Well, on my DVD player, all you need to do is press the skip-forward button (>>|) after pressing enter, and the animation is skipped.  I can't say that this works on all players, but I don't see why it shouldn't; try it and see.

Second;  Conan O'Brien is credited for the audio commentary for ""Marge vs. the Monorail,"" but if you select the commentary track through the DVD menu, O'Brien is nowhere to be heard.  Don't despair! There are TWO commentary tracks for ""Monorail.""  To hear the commentary track featuring O'Brien, simply play the episode as normal, and then use the ""audio"" button to change audio tracks while the episode is playing.  (The second commentary track is shown as audio track 5/5 on my player; the first commentary track is shown as 4/5.)

2043871,5,B0001Z3IPS,"The fact that the brilliant fourth season gets the same rating on Amazon as the ""still trying to master the art of cartoons"" first season bewilders me. By the fourth season, the producers had mastered their art and the result is nothing short of amazing.

Just to correct the most recent review I read, ""Lemon of Troy"" is a sixth season episode. As a diehard fan, I'm the only one who'd be concerned about correcting such an error, but nonetheless had to point it out.

This is the season where the show had reached it's peak where it would remain until after season 7. There is not a single bad episode in this collection. This is a point in the show where the writers had found the perfect balance between humor and heart. In earlier seasons, there was heart ahead of humor. In later seasons, there's in-your-face humor and no heart. But this season balances it so well and embodies everything people have come to love about the best cartoon ever made.

If you've never seen an episode of the Simpsons before (and I realize I'm addressing an extremely small minority group here) this is the set to start with. The Simpsons is not a show where you need to see the previous episodes to get the humor. In the early years, the show seldom referenced other episodes.

For those of you who are familiar with our favorite family, this set includes the classic episodes ""Mr. Plow"" where Homer gets a snowplow only to find his best friend has become his rival, ""Marge Vs. the Monorail"" a brilliant spoof of the Music Man that's funny even if you've never heard of the Music Man, ""Whacking Day"" in which Bart gets expelled from school and Springfield celebrates a local tradtion that involves beating snakes to death with a whacking stick, ""Duffless"" in which Homer gets a DWI and Lisa compares her brother to a hamster for her science fair project, ""Last Exit To Springfield"" in which Homer becomes head of the Power Plant Union to take back their Dental Plan. The truth is every episode in this set is a winner. I could go on and on because I consider pretty much every one a classic in it's own right.

Special features include commentary on all 22 episodes, some outtakes, animatics, and easter eggs.

The show really hit it's full stride at this point, evolving into some of the wittiest social satire pointed at people that appreciate some depth to their televised entertainment. At this point The Simpsons was such a national phenomenon they pretty much had complete creative control from the Fox Network. This is also the season when Conan O'brien was producing episodes, and you had Phil Hartman (who I still miss to this very day) contributing so many zingers through his classic characters Lionel Hutz and Troy McLure. He even plays Barts big brother on 'Brother From The Same Planet'. All I can say is that all of the Simpson's Box sets are worth owning, but this one is the best out so far.

Homer search for spirituality(wait, there's been other episodes on other seasons with a similar concept), love-stories-galore(Ralph in love with Lisa rocked, GO RALPH) and some other important stuff I won't mention due to time and stuff.

They offer the Frank Grimes and associated episodes as evidence of the current ""strength"" of the Simpsons. However, I think that these people miss some of the real strengths of the show.

First, social commentary. This includes ""menthol moose"" and the need to replace the current smokers who are, well, dying in the Little Miss Springfield Episode of Season 4. Or the ""We can't govern"" and ""We're just plain evil"" signs in the respective Democractic and Republican convention scenes in (soon to be released?) Season 5.

Then there's the satire. The Ayn Rand School for Tots (in ""A Streecar Named Marge"" from Season 4)? A musical version of Streetcar Named Desire (from the same episode with Apu's first memorable solo)? The Batman and Grinch take-offs in ""Last Exit to Springfield"" (perhaps the greatest Simpsons episode ever - from Season 4)? The Lord of the Flies references in the Kamp Krusty episode (from Season 4)? My wife doesn't really appreciate the Simpsons, but she laughs a great deal during the episodes from this season due to the constant wit that the writers/producers/directors/etc. display.

Last, and perhaps most important, the Simpsons showed us that we could really care about a family that was not just artificial (as all sitcom families are) but patently unreal (due to the animation.) So what if characters aren't real? We know that's true about everything that we watch on TV. But Homer wasn't just a stupid boob and the situations weren't so farfetched - we still cared about the exploits of this family every week.

I would challenge any fan of the last few seasons to place their best episode against almost anything from Season 4. Perhaps there are differences in taste that cannot be reconciled in such a comparison, but the overall consistent humor in this season is outstanding. I'm not surprised that it hasn't been sustained, but I am saddened to see what this once fine show has become. Luckily, the reproduction of these early episodes allows me to skip the later morass. Call me an elitist if you want (hard to see how that could be applied to a fan of the Simpsons), but these early episodes were really a high point in the history of TV.",1092182400,6,2319,4.819095477386934

2043881,4,B0001Z3IPS,"One of the first classic Ralph Wiggum lines which appeared in this season, and an indication of many more to come.

 As a major Simpson fan, I naturally ordered this box set right away. There are many excellent episodes in this season, plus an increased depth to most of the characters and the introduction of some great new ones (Llewelyn Sinclair, Lyle Langley, etc).

 I'm giving this DVD only 4 stars (well, maybe 4 1/2) for the time being because this set lacks several things the Season 3 DVD set had. First of all, I've been a big fan of the commentary tracks in all four seasons, and I can listen to them over and over. However, I was disappointed that the cast members were not featured in the commentaries this year, with the exception of Hank Azaria and John Lovitz in ""A Sreetcar Named Marge"". (In retropect, the commentaries may have been recorded around the time the cast was renegotiating their contracts, so maybe that's why they didn't participate.) Secondly, I have only come across one hidden commentary track, on ""Marge vs. The Monorail"", while season 3 had four of them. Thirdly, the ""Cajun Controversy"" and ""Bush vs. Simpsons"" featurettes were just voiceovers by Jeff Martin and Jim Brooks, respectively, instead of videotaped interviews, which seemed odd. Finally, assuming there are Easter Eggs on this DVD, I haven't found any of them yet.

 Despite these problems, I feel that that there are many improvements to the DVD presentation compared to earlier seasons. The menu organization is much better, the Special Features are easier to access, and there is now an option to play all of the episodes at once with the commentaries as well as without. Also, there are some really excellent Special Features, including Deleted Scenes on selected episodes, and the Animation Showcase, in which the storyboards and animatics for selected episodes can be viewed. Oh, and the little character animations in the menus are funny.

 Overall, I'd say the creators of this DVD set did a nice job, and I'm very much looking forward to the season 5 DVD set.",1091145600,6,2068,4.838526912181303

2043884,5,B0001Z3IPS,"Even if you're just a casual Simpsons fan, you should know that season 4 is were the series really started to come together and gel.  The transition from early episodes to the simpsons today can almost be tracked from the begining of season 4 to the last episode of season 4.  The social commentary really came on strong this season and shows in the quality and feel of every episode.  Some people have written about how they felt the commentary was off putting and self serving, at times it can be.  But this is one of the reasons to listen to the commentary.  To hear the voices and creators of these episodes just sit back and riff with each other is a great way to get a better understanding of how they think and interact in real life.  It's like being a fly on the wall during a read through.

If you like the simpsons this box set is worth it just to watch the episodes again.

If you're a simpson fanatic, this set is worth it for all of the commentary and all of the bits of information you'll find out from listening to a room full of very creative people being creative.

Some of the show's greatest episodes are in this season:  Lisa's beauty queen pageant, Mr. Burns' love for Marge, the monorail - all Simpson gems.
The commentaries are not great.  I can't believe that they delay the release of episodes specifically for this reason.  The commentary for ""A Streetcar Named Marge"" is awful.  It basically consists of Jon Lovitz and Hank Azaria shamelessly plugging ""The Critic,"" ""The Stepford Wives,"" and ""Along Came Polly.""  The commentary for ""The New Kid on the Block"" includes Conan O'Brien, but all they do is sit around and laugh at each other.  There are hardly any insights to the episodes, and often, there are many blank moments where it seems as if no one can think of anything to say.  It's very annoying.  I say, release the seasons faster by only doing commentary for a few episodes.
So - 5 star DVD, 2 star commentaries.  This is a definite must-have for Simpsons fans, but skip the commentary.  Let's hope the creators have exhausted themselves and will release season 5 soon.",1089331200,5,1171,4.8

2043889,5,B0001Z3IPS,"Finally, after months of waiting, The Simpsons Season Four is out on DVD. Anybody who's familiar with this season can tell you it's well worth the wait. Season Four is easily one of the best seasons the Simpsons have ever made, and I've seen every Simpsons episode ever made from Season 1-14 (missed a few last season).
Why is this one of the best seasons, you might ask. Well, I say because the writing/plots/animation were improved upon since the first three seasons; and they were great in the first three seasons. Season 2 was when the show started putting out some REALLY quality episodes (Season 1 was good too, but needed to find its own a little), and with this season, it just kept getting better and better, making it THE show for the '90s. This set contains so many memorable Simpsons moments; for instance, this season saw Ralph Wiggum falling in love with Lisa, Homer giving up beer for a whole month, Marge getting a job at the power plant, and, of course, Bart, Lisa, and Selma's ill-fated trip to Duff Gardens (""I AM THE LIZARD QUEEN!""). Great, classic stuff. (This season also had the first Simpsons clip show, but it actually had a plot behind it.)
This DVD also has lots of extra goodies, which include (but are not limited to): the whole Bush controversy, a documentary from the fourth season (which lets you briefly see Dan Castellaneta, Nancy Cartwright, and Yeardley Smith doing their voices), and deleted scenes from ""The Front"" (""I know *this* word, but what's 'shinola'?""). This DVD is more than worth your money if you're a Simpsons fan.
Some of my personal Season 4 highlights:
* Bart and Homer singing ""On Top Of Spaghetti"" on the way to Marge's aunt's funeral
* The Power Plant's retirement party for poor Jack Marley (cruel, but funny cruel)
* Krusty's comeback special
* The trip to Duff Gardens
And can't we all relate to Ralph in ""I Love Lisa""?

But, I digress, the rest of the shows are great too.  I like I love lisa and it's sweet, yet funny story.  I also enjoyed Selma's choice and the 'sandwich incident'.  Not to mention the 'legend of the dog faced woman' and the seven duffs if if we only learn the names of four or so of them.  To learn the identity of the others you will have to go elsewhere.

2043896,5,B0001Z3IPS,"...well, at least up until now.
The producers of these Simpsons box-sets have finally hit their stride, and just in time for the first of the truly GREAT Simpsons seasons.  I opened this set with more excitement than I have had since I first bought Season One.  Season Four...ah, good times!
Others have already showered kudos on the individual episodes, so I won't go into a lengthy diatribe here.  Suffice it to say that I believe Season Four is when the creators and writers (yes, including Conan) first achieved a level of true brilliance.  Here are many of the episodes that garnered the most universal accolades for the show.
I must say that I have been waiting for this set with a somewhat unique expectation -- I saw a stage production of ""Streetcar"" last spring, and I really wanted to see Marge's musical version again with the original fresh in my mind.  I laughed at some points like I had just seen the episode for the first time.  I think the ""Ayn Rand School for Tots"" is still one of the funniest gags they ever pulled off.  If they hadn't realized it before, that is when the public surely began to realize that though this is a cartoon, it is not made with kids in mind.  It's made for grown-ups, by grown-ups.
I do realize that recording the commentaries is slowing down the production of these sets, but once again, here we get to listen in on priceless gatherings of the geniuses behind the Simpsons who illustrate each episode with wonderful insights and fresh humor.
The extras are a good mix of ""geeky"" Simpsons treats plus more ""scholarly"" artifacts, including the hilarious ""Cajun Controversy.""  The packaging is fresh and funny as well.
It has been taking so long between box-sets that I'm torn when I open a new one...  Should I save and savor the episodes and extras, watching them slowly in increments, or should I splurge on a Simpsons' binge?  Well, I've done some random bingeing that should leave enough things untouched so I can enjoy it for several months (if I can manage the self-control).
I've said it before and I'll say it again (at least 10 more times) -- I can't wait for the next season!!!",1088380800,,2133,4.601583113456464

The real reason for buying this set is for the commentaries.  Unlike so many commentaries for other disks, the writers and producers for the Simpsons sound like they are actually ENJOYING watching and commenting on their work.
Perhaps regular actors are just too stuck up watching themselves on the big screen, and the Simpson guys are fairly normal down to Earth guys.
My ONLY complaint with all the series so far is the inability to change the mix between the show dialog and the commentary.
C'mon Fox, just make the center channel of a 5.1 the commentary, while having the character dialog in the left & right speaker, or if that's too much data, put the show commentary on the left channel, the show dialog on the right channel, and allow anybody to change the mix with their pan control on their TV or a/v receiver!",1088380800,,965,4.566473988439307

There are lots of extras including audio commentaries on all episodes, storyboards, deleted scenes, and featurettes on various controversies the Simpsons caused. It's a nice time capsule that supplements the quality entertainment of the season.
What really makes this set stand out from the previous ones is the presentation. Everything from the box to the episode guide to the animated menus feels a lot more polished than the previous seasons, and this set came out in less time!

2043900,5,B0001Z3IPS,"The Simpsons at their finest.  Clear and simple.
Each season of the show has been an improvement on the latter, up until this season.  It will be hard for the show to top this, and in truth it never really does, though for several seasons it matches the excellence seen here.
I'll spare you the episode-by-episode guide, as you already see it on other reviews.  I'll just spotlight the reasons to buy this:
1) Conan.  Yes, Conan.  The man might not have been the most prolific Simpsons writer, but he was among the best.  The Monorail episode was a legend before Conan himself was, and it will have you in hysterics.
2) Homer leading his Union.  Amazing.  I really can't describe it any other way.
3) Nonstop laughs.  The show hit its stride early here, and never stops.  As a result, the viewer will barely have time to catch his breath amidst the rapid-fire gags.
There are real downer episodes on this disc.  Some are better than others, but all are solid, as opposed to the cousin series Futurama, which often matches the laughs here, but also sometimes falls flat (Zoidberg episodes, hah).
The only flaw is the menu system.  Each choice forces you to watch an animation 10-15 seconds long, ones not funny the first time and terribly annoying the 40th.  Also, the discs still aren't good to fall asleep to, as the theme music in the menus never end, unlike similar discs which won't loop, well aware that ""Watch All Episodes"" is an excellent way to end a night.
Listen, you already know you want this, so why are you even reading what the hell I think?  As the commentary points out, I'm just some nerd on the interweb.  You're the one that matters, and you shouldn't be reading my opinion, you should be watching the show!",1088035200,7,1727,4.543689320388349

Either by oversight or a desire to make this an easter egg, you can only listen to the Conan commentary on this episode by using the Audio button on your DVD remote control while the episode is playing, and then selecting track number 5.

2043902,5,B0001Z3IPS,"The Simpsons really hit its stride with the fourth season. Conan O'Brien was a producer and started writing episodes midway through the season. Brad Bird (of The Iron Giant fame) was a co-executive producer and several big time stars (Johnny Carson and Elizabeth Taylor) were convinced to lend their vocal talents on a number of episodes. The writing was a lot better and their pop culture parodies much funnier, varied and worked on several levels. The quality of the animation also improved greatly. Looking at the first couple of seasons it seems a bit crude but it is obvious that the show's budget had increased significantly by the fourth year.
""A Streetcar Named Marge"" shows how strong the writing had become as it not only parodies Tennessee Williams' famous play, but transforms it into a local musical theatre production with an ego-maniacal director (voiced by Jon Lovitz no less) at the helm. There is also a spot-on satire of beauty pageants and a very funny literary gag as Marge drops Maggie off at the Ayn Rand day care center. Under all the gags lurks the serious issue of Marge trying to establish her own individual identity.
Every episode features an audio commentary introduced and moderated (sort of) by series creator, Matt Groening with the writers and director of that particular episode sitting in. While all of the commentaries are amusing and informative (as the writers point out all of the obscure and not so obscure pop culture references), the strongest track of the set is for the ""A Streetcar Named Marge"" episode. Included on this track is comedian Jon Lovitz and actor Hank Azaria who spend the entire time making fun of the writers and each other.
""The Cajun Controversy"" is a brief featurette with writer Jeff Martin examining how a song he wrote for the ""Streetcar"" episode had to be cut because it playfully slammed the city of New Orleans.
""Bush vs. The Simpsons"" is an amusing story told by producer James L. Brooks about how former First Lady Barbara Bush slammed The Simpsons in a People magazine interview and how he responded.
There are also deleted scenes for ""Homer's Triple Bypass"" and ""The Front"" with optional audio commentary. One can watch the scenes separately or along with the actual episode.
The Simpsons Season Four box set is crammed with an excellent collection of extras and features some of the strongest episodes of the show's lengthy run. In a nice touch, the various menus and sub-menus are animated with little bits by the characters from the show that differ slightly depending on what option you pick. This is a really nice touch.

The social commentary was becoming stronger and ingeniously written, the characters were delivering nonstop classic one-liners (such as ""I love the sexy slither of a lady snake... oh baby..."" by Barry White in ""Whacking Day""), the animators had perfected the outstanding visual look of the series, and all the voice actors had raised their efforts to an art form. The cast of supporting characters became stronger this season; especially Grampa and Ralph Wiggum (in the sensational ""I Love Lisa""), while within the Simpson family Marge and Lisa were becoming more outspoken characters as well. Even little Maggie developed well this season, with many indications of her budding genius, though that notion was unfortunately forgotten in later seasons. Here Maggie provides us with what I think is one of the most brilliant Simpsons scenes ever, as she engineers the mission to rescue the pacifiers at the Ayn Rand School for Tots in ""A Streetcar Named Marge.""
While it's hardly the end of the world, there is one major case of censorship in this package, as Bart's aping of Tourette's Syndrome has been removed from ""Marge Gets a Job"" (though other reviewers don't need to be such crybabies about it). However, there is one good case of reverse-censorship here. In ""So It's Come to This: A Simpsons Clip Show"" one of the remembered scenes is when Homer fell down Springfield Gorge, and his entire second trip down the gorge is seen, including when the gurney slams him in the head at the bottom. This scene had been removed from ""Bart the Daredevil"" back in the Season 2 DVD set.
This package has voluminous DVD extras, some of which are great for everyone like featurettes about controversies the show got involved in after insulting New Orleans (in ""A Streetcar Named Marge"") and getting criticized by George and Barbara Bush. Two episodes come with deleted scenes, with the special option of watching them with the deleted scenes restored (those that were cut from ""The Front"" are especially funny). And finally, every single episode comes with audio commentary from the production team. That's okay for collectors and obsessives, but this is the main reason why it is taking so dang long for these Simpsons DVD packages to come out. I'd rather get these packages once every six or seven months, like we have for Futurama, than wait an entire year for this barely crucial commentary.

Yes. This is the funniest season released so far. Keep it comin' boys!

2043907,4,B0001Z3IPS,"The Simpsons was funny in the first and second season, really started to cook in season three, and got even funnier in season four, which is what this season contains. Although most people mention ""Marge vs. The Monorail"" (a semi-parody of ""The Music Man"" movie) as the best episode, I think it would have to be ""I Love Lisa"" (Ralph: ""So, do you like...stuff?"")
I do have some issues with the actual DVDs, though. When you select an episode or certain feature to play, you have to sit a few seconds through some animation which may be cute at first, but a little annoying after a while. Also, I'm one of those geeks who watches everything with closed-captioning or with English subtitles so I don't misunderstand any dialogue. For the subtitles on these discs, would it have killed them to include the words to the songs that the characters sing? Fans would love to know the words to the ""Kamp Krusty"" song, but all the subtitles say is, ""singing"". (Which is why you should get the books from the ""The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family"" series. They list the words to almost every song.)
Some reviewers also noticed in ""Marge Gets a Job"", there was a line blocked out about ""Tourette's syndrome"" and replaced with ""rabies"". Actually, both terms were worked in. Mrs. Krabappel said to get out of taking a test, Bart had an ""unfortunate case of Tourette's syndrome"". Bart responded with ""Shove it, witch!"" and started barking. Krabappel said, ""No more excuses"", and Bart mumbled ""Tourette's syndrome"" underneath his breath. This dialogue is the same on the DVD except Krabappel's ""Tourette's syndrome"" is replaced with ""rabies"" because the censors got upset of Bart's demonstration of someone with Tourette's.
The artwork on the cover and on the discs are great. I can't describe it in words, but when you remove the discs from their slots, you get a little surprise. This box set is still a treasure and I can't wait for Season 5, which at the rate Twentieth Century Fox is going, will come out in a year or two.",1087862400,3,2027,4.7126760563380286

2043909,4,B0001Z3IPS,"The Simpsons 4th Season DVD has been released, with a forward from Matt Groening explaning that the year between release dates has been due to commentary on all the episodes and attention to detail on the extras.
The episodes themselves are approaching the shows prime, with no dead weight to be found. This is a season to make you love musicals.
Overall, this is a well produced, easy to navigated DVD set.  The extras are mostly for the closet artist, though there is a few nostalgic bits.
One minor error.  The DVD episode flyer claims that Conan does commentary on two episodes, but only does it on one. Myself, I've never been a commentary fan.  I do keep going back and hoping it will catch on with me, but it never does.  The little bits they do to segue between menu selections are entertaining, but I thought they were better, more unpredictable and less repetitve on Season 3.
So, Simpsons' fans, go out and enjoy. This is a good introduction season for new fans, as the earlier seasons might be a little slow paced compared to what they have been doing.

Although I don't find the menu transitions quite as funny as season 3, I do find the episodes even funnier, and the quality of the transfers seem even better.

I did want to address one issue I have with the season 4 DVDs.  There is always an annoying gap between the time you make a selection on the menu and the time the selection takes effect.  During this time you are forced to watch an animation.  Some animations are very long and can make navigating the extras very tedious.  You can skip the animation by pressing the ""Next Chapter"" button on the remote.

Finally, Ms. Krabapple tells bart that he's used ""Smallpox, the Bends, and that unfortunate bout of RABIES."" Bart says he's not over it, and calls her a stupid witch. However, when the show first aired, RABIES was originally Tourette's Syndrome! And it's still TS on the syndicated reruns! Is there some reason they changed it for the DVD? Did the PC Police show up?

One thing I do like about the box set is that it is the most durable box sets of seasons that I have ever seen. I bought the first three seasons and they were funny and all but the fourth season was the one that it really started to show the humor that Matt Groening had in mind the whole time.
  Well now that I have said the good stuff that I wanted to say lets get to the bad stuff. I may be only 12 but right here I know what im talking about. First off it takes way to long to get the seasons out in the market. It takes a year to get a season out. Ok lets see here im 12 and there is four seasons out and thy just finished the fifthtenth season and they plan to make two more seasons so there will be a total of 17 seasons. Lets see here subtract 4 from 17 equals 13 so im 12 and 12 plus 13 equals 25. So I will be 25 when they all get out. Ok so im 25 they just go the last season out. So im now an adult I live in my own place I could be married and I could have kids something better than dvd will most likley be out so I will have to rebuy it all plus some will be broken or something else and have to buy them again. I rated it with 5 stars because it said to rate the show but if it was the rate it came out it would be 1 star. well when im 25 my collection will be complete.",1087171200,,1400,3.617161716171617

It also was the season the show really found its' groove, and from then through the next 3 or 4 years produced its' best material. No more changing animation between episodes and no more changing voices. The humor was just dead on, likely due to the writing staff at the time (Ian Maxtone Graham had not come in full force until around season 9, when the show started to go downhill, although it's certainly still worth watching today).
If for some reason someone has not really seen much of the show before and you're trying to hook them in, this is the season to show them.

Going on Strike because of Dental Benefits....I think those who went on strike here in CA due to an increase in Medical Premiums should have watched that episode.

For shame Fox, for shame! Does anyone know why Fox can produce film DVDs just fine but each season collection I have bought has had to be returned?! The people at Fox certainly don't seem to know or even care: they never have replied to any of the MULTIPLE letters we've sent asking them to explain themselves.
Before you blame me, my DVD player, the retailer, etc., for the problem:
My DVD player works fine with DVDs of other shows (Star Trek, ER, Friends, The Jeffersons, CSI, Monk, Queer As Folk, Sex And The City, and Six Feet Under have all worked just fine). The defective FoxTV DVDs in question, bought from *many* different retailers (Amazon, BestBuy, CostCo, Wal-Mart, Target, and others), have failed when played in other DVD players besides mine.

Classic episodes come back in pure syndicated goodness. Here's some examples:
Itchy and Scratchy the Movie: ""I regret nothing!""
Mr. Plow: ""You think I'm going to buy a 20,000 dollar car just because you make those whip noises?""
New Kid On The Block: ""Listen, you little punk... I'm gonna rip out your eyeballs, and shove them down your pants, so you can watch me kick the crap out of you!""

This season is really entertaining, season 3 was a huge laugh,season 2 was ok and had a few chuckles, season one wasn't really funny but still classic, of course season 3 was hilarious and all,but this season had a few different sides to it, it has a moe serious side than the rest and a funnier side, mostly serious. I love this season!,. This season boxed set is a goodie aswell, 1993 proved to be a cool year for the simpsons, they dealed with really different topics compared to other cartoons out there , the main episode Im talking about is ""LAst Exitto springfield"" , the dental plan episode, dubbed ""The best episode ever"" by Simpsons fans,
PROS: Nearly, if not all of the episodes are entertaining! Im not one for clip shows, but this one was pretty good, the features are definitley better than Season 3, and the packcaging is snazzy.
CONS: The menu is less than good looking , but the lil' animations are pretty funny, what I absolutley hate about this DVD is the amount of time you have to wait to see an episode, special feature or go to another menu, why ? Simply because the characters on the menu have a animation and it takes about 5-7-8 seconds to see what u want to see.

Overall this is the best One to date, Season five is better than this but out of Seasons 1,2,3,and 4 , 4 has to take the cake!",1084492800,,1533,4.286206896551724

Season 4 of the Simpsons is the best of their long career - bar none.  Where some seasons have good and bad episodes, this one has all GREAT ones.
The creators and writers all hit their stride during this season.  Stand-outs are ""Last Exit to Springfield"", ""A Streetcar Name Marge"", ""Mr. Plow"" and my favorite ""I Love Lisa"".

The Simpsons Complete Fourth Season is when the Simpsons really started to look their ""finest""  Also the sound is extra sharp, and the writing even better.  The third seasonis one of the best dvds ever created...then this is probably the one best dvd box set ever created, bar none.  The only gripe I have about this is that  Fox is currently releasing one season a year...in my opinion that is insane, by the time they get the 15th season on dvd, there will be something better then dvd, and people will not use it....
Remember Fox, Technology comes a long way in a short time...Anyway if you are a Simpsons fan or not, this is a requirement to add to your dvd collection.... 5 stars",1082851200,2,884,4.425925925925926
2043944,5,B0001Z3IPS,"The simpsons is my all time favorite show.  However, I do not like the fact that FOX is taking so much time to release a season.

2043947,5,B0001Z3IPS,"...or has every set since #2 been described as ""This is the season The Simpsons really came into their own""?
Regardless, this is definitely the best season so far, for one very important reason: it showed us that against all logic, a fat couch potato with cholesterol off the charts and who hadn't exercised in 10 years could still find time to master the Ways of the Ninja.  Don't believe me?  Check out Homer's moves in Whacking Day; you can't tell me that wasn't the coolest thing you'd ever seen the first time you watched it.  And his use of starfish as shurikens during the fight at the aquarium vs. Bart's big brother?  Step aside, Bruce Lee- Homer Simpson is the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
The other classic moment from this season comes in Kamp Krusty, with the children's Lord of the Flies-inspired takeover of the camp.  The thinner, stronger, and slightly less bald Homer watches TV with Marge, just in time to see Kent Brockman being led in to do an interview with ""the leader of the rebellion.""  Homer's silent plea of ""Don't be the boy.  Don't be the boy.  Don't be the boy."", followed by Bart's revelation and Homer's subsequent reaction, is just about the funniest thing ever.
""A+?!?  You don't think much of me, do you, boy?""
""No sir!""
""You know, a 'D' turns into a 'B' so nicely... you just got greedy.""
""You mean I don't get to go to Kamp Krusty?""
""Now son, we had an agreement.  I thought that threatening to not let you go to camp would motivate you to get better grades.  And I was wrong.  But why should you pay for my mistakes?""
""You mean... I can go?!""
""Yeah... I didn't want you hanging around all summer anyway.""
A thought- the wait between seasons 2 and 3 was a lot longer than the wait between 3 and this one.  Is it because now that Futurama is off the air (and the DVD sets of that show are almost done), Matt Groening has more time on his hands?  Here's hoping that this means even less downtime between this one and season 5.",1081987200,3,1960,4.423398328690808
2043948,5,B0001Z3IPS,"The fourth season of the Simpsons is when the show became a fully-fledged masterpiece of TV scriptwriting, animation, and vocal acting. Episodes include:
Kamp Krusty - a wonderful trip to Kamp Krusty. Or is it?
A Streetcar Named Marge - Marge acts in ""Oh, Streetcar""
Homer the Heretic - Homer skips church and has the best day ever.
Lisa the Beauty Queen - Exposes dark underworld of child beauty paegents.
Treehouse of Horror III - killer Krusty doll, Homer as King Kong, zombies in Springfield.
Itchy and Scratchy: The Movie - Bart is banned from seeing the epoch of his childhood.
Marge Gets a Job - Marge as a cop!
The New Kid on the Block - Bart's first crush.
Mr. Plow - Homer gets a snowplow, Barney competes.
Lisa's First Word - Nostalgic episode.
Homer's Triple Bypass - Scary topic, funny handling.
Marge vs. the Monorail - Why build a monorail in a centralized town?
Selma's Choice - Duff Gardens!!
Brother From the Same Planet - Homer's long-lost half-brother.
I Love Lisa - Ralph's unwelcome crush on Lisa.
Duffless - Homer goes clean after wild bender.
Last Exit to Springfield - Considered the greatest episode, labor unions and horrible braces.
So It's Come to This - a clip show already??
The Front - Bart and Lisa ghostwrite Grandpa's award-winning Itchy and Scratch episodes.
Whacking Day - Lisa fights the deplorable tradition with help from Barry White.
Marge in Chains - Marge goes to prison for bourbon: riots ensue.
Krusty Gets Kancelled - One of the finest, most celebrity packed episodes. Just great.
As you can see, this season contained absolutely no cluncker episodes, and was truly the first peak of the show.

2043949,5,B0001Z3IPS,"Season Four of The Simpsons contained some very strong episodes which carried on the incisive wit honed so sharp in seasons one through three. It's all here: the dark humor illuminating a rigid, uncaring and under-funded school system, an incompetent and corrupt mayor and police force, mob thinking that gets the whole town in trouble and much more! Matt Groening's ""Life In Hell"" view of the world is present in all its glory with hilarious results. Even the shameless, self effacing clip show is worth seeing as the new material is great and the way the clips are strung together is so funny you will care little about the fact that you are watching mostly rehashed material. This is some of the best television comedy writing ever. A Streetcar Named Marge, Last Exit to Springfield, Brother From The Same Planet and select others are some of the funniest episodes of the series. This set is highly recommended.

EXTRAS - We can be guaranteed the Commentaries on each episode, Featurettes, Early Drawings, Animatics, TV Specials and so forth. Forget about the Extras though, that's just the glazing on the Donut so to speak. What you want this set for is the...

2043956,5,B0001Z3IPS,"I am happy to see the Simpsons Complete Seasons DVD's keep coming, but one season a year isn't working for me.  It feels like DVD's will be obsolete by the time they hit the sixth or seventh seasons and then I will have to start collecting them all over again.  Although this is good for the people releasing the Simpsons sets, it is bad for the consumer.  I mean the whole point of having a chronological set of seasons is so you can collect them all and have a library, but once DVD's go away i'm sure they will stop the release of the Simpsons Complete Seasons DVD's dead in their tracks.
 Yes I will buy this set and the one that follows, because I really enjoy having and watching the whole seasons in such phenomenal quality.  And this is what bothers me, because they are so good, but have ridiculously spanned out release dates.  I don't want to have only seasons 1-6 on DVD before it turns into the next Laserdisc.

2043959,5,B0001Z3IPS,"Ahhh, here is is! ""The Simpsons"", season four. In four DVDs (at an incredible price), one can see all of the wit and grandeur of what I believe to be the greatest television show of all time. Season four has it all, from the greatest episode of all time (""Last Exit to Springfield"", or, more aptly, Union Chief Homer), to ""Duffless"" an homage to drunk driving, to ""Selma's Choice"", which introduced us to a later Simpsons tradition - plotlines which have no purpose to ANYTHING in the show, and yet leave us in stitches (Homer's insistence on finishing a 10ft hoagie?). There are other great episodes (""Lisa the Beauty Queen"", ""New Kid on the Block"", ""Itchy and Scratchy - the Movie"", ""The Front"", just to name a few). Of course, any fan will buy this DVD right out of the gate, but for the rest of you that might be wavering, that might be wondering, ""Are these old episodes really THAT good?"", please do yourself a favor and pick up this incredible set.

By beginning I mean being funny to the point where you can't breathe.  This is actually the time when the ""Golden Age"" of this show starts and the character development shifts its focus from Bart to Homer, because the higher-ups realized just how funny the voice actor Dan Castellanetta can be.  This is the best show on television these days, not just in my opinion though.  There's a reason it continues on for a sixteenth season, making it the longest running program in recent history.

With the show currently in its 15th season, there have been many memorable episodes throughout the show. However, season 4 is when the show really began to take off. My favorite episodes from this season include ""Duffless"" which involves Lisa and Bart going to Duff Gardens, ""Mr. Plow"" which involves Homer starting his very own snow plowing business, ""Kamp Krusty"" which involves Lisa and Bart and the rest of the kids of Springfield taking over the camp when Krusty fails to appear, ""Brother from the Same Planet"" which involves Bart getting a big brother due to Homer's neglect, ""Last Exit to Springfield"" which involves Homer leading a strike at work to get dental benefits from Mr. Burns, and ""Itchy and Scratchy :The Movie"". Season 4 truly is a great season from start to finish.
The wait is finally over!! It has been announced that season 4 of The Simpsons is finally coming to DVD on June 15, 2004. The set is going to have outstanding extras that includes commentary from Conan O Brian!! That is reason enough to want to buy the set. All I can say, is that it is about time. While I appreciate the people at FOX taking the time to offer first rate DVD sets, it is pretty ridiculous to only be releasing season 4 when the show is currently in season 15.

It got to the point that my kids and I stopped watching and would watch one from the first 2 seasons on DVD. I suggest we all start writing Fox and at least try to find out what is going on.

However, even the worst episode in the season four shows is pretty funny. Standout episodes like Streetcar Named Marge, Mr. Plow, Lisa's First Word, Selma's Choice, Marge Vs.

Why are they being so slow?  What I heard, but I don't know if it's true, is that it's takeing so long because of adding commentary to every episode.

I agree with a previous reviewer that the brilliance of this series is the humorous and almost disturbingly realistic way it reflects American pop culture. Although we will have to wait until season 7 to get Lemons of Troy, Itchy and Scratchy: the Movie is an excellent satire of America's obsession with big box office films and the juvenile beauty queen Amber Dempsey looks so much like Jeanbenet Ramsey it's scary (especially considering this episode came out before her tragic death).",1059177600,26,1412,4.69758064516129

Of course, there was a transition from good to great in the forth season. Probably the most resonant episode that would mark this change is Lemon of Troy, a story whose jokes are so well crafted that a new and very high standard of comedy had been made.

Each episode is completly unique from one another and tells us a different story.

The show has been put in the Guiness Book of Records and the longest running tv show and also the television series to have the most number of guest stars appearing. Here's a brief information about the episodes:
Kamp Krusty : Bart and Lisa spend six weeks at Camp Krusty. However, the camp is not what it seems, as Bart and Lisa quickly find out.
A Streetcar Named Marge : Marge takes a part in the musical version of A Streetcar Named Desire, a musical which has a strange resemblance to the Simpsons' own home life.

Lisa the Beauty Queen : Homer enters Lisa in a beauty contest, and Lisa comes in as runner up. However, when the original winner is injured, Lisa becomes Little Miss Springfield. Guest stars Bob Hope.
Itchy & Scratchy: The Movie : When Bart fails to keeps an eye on Maggie and puts her life in danger, Homer finally puts his foot down on Bart's mischief by passing the ultimate punishment: Bart can never see The Itchy and Scratchy Movie.
Treehouse of Horror III : The Simpsons hold a Halloween Party, in which three stories are exchanged:
Clown Without Pity - Bart receives, as a birthday present, a talking Krusty doll....from the House of Evil 'Your One Stop Evil Shop'
King Homer - King Kong Klone.
Dial 'Z' For Zombies - After being assigned to read a another book, Bart picks out an item from the occult section, and tries to raise the dead Snowball I, but instead cause the dead people to rise up.
Marge Gets a Job : The Simpsons home needs about $8,000 worth of foundation work, so Marge gets a job at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. However, things start getting a bit sticky when Mr. Burns develops a crush on Marge. Tom Jones guest stars.
New Kid on the Block : Bart develops a crush on the new girl next door, but his heart is broken when she dates Jimbo. Sara Gilbert guest stars.
Mr. Plow : After Homer wrecks the two family cars during a snowstorm, he buys a snowplow, and starts up Mr. Plow. However, the competition becomes cut-throat when Homer's best buddy, Barney, starts up a competing plowing business, Plow King. Guest stars Linda Ronstadt and Adam West.
Lisa's First Words : While trying to get Maggie to say her first words, Homer recalls what happened a few years back when Lisa was born, when they first moved into their present home, and what Lisa said her first words.
Homer's Triple Bypass : All those years of eating those fatty foods has caused Homer to have a heart attack. Now, Homer has a choice - spend $40,000 for Dr. Hibbert's bypass operation, or $129.95 for Dr. Nick Riviera's operation--any operation.
Marge vs. the Monorail : After getting $3 million from a fine due to Mr. Burn's illegal disposal of nuclear waste, the town decides to spend money on a needless monorail....built from shoddy materials. Leonard Nimoy guest voices as himself.
Selma's Choice : After aunt Gladys Bouvier dies, Selma decided to try and get married and have a child.

Probably the only disadvantage about the dvd is it's last release. For example, the third season was supposed to release sometime in June 2003 and got postpond to August. It's a little disappointing that we have to wait a year before a season is released on DVD, that too, considering there are 14 seasons, and it would be a disaster if we had to wait for 14 years for each season to be released! At least they could release 2 seasons in one year like they do for other tv shows like friends, x-files, buffy the vampire slayer etc.
On the whole, this dvd edition is still worth having for the countless extra features including, intervies, commentaries, and much more!!! A great addition to your dvd collection :)",1058227200,4,6009,4.691287878787879
