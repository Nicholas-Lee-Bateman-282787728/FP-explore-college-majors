8664798,4,B00LA9L9EG,"The German DVD imprint Arthaus releases some interesting performing arts productions that are usually about classical music, oprea  or dance  and sometimes art. This title caught my attention because  of all things  it is about Country Music. Well, it is SORT of about country music; Its a bit disjointed but still worth watching if you know what to expect.

In what appears to be 2012 (the film was completed in 2013) German film director Marieke Schroeder travelled to the southern US to visit towns in Tennessee  mostly Nashville -  and Alabama and interview both musicians and just plain folks. She hooked on to Americana Singer-Songwriter Justin Townes Earle  who was just coming off another of his rehab treatments. Hes a talented songwriter but had had to deal with his own demons and substance abuse. And so, for a lot of the 90 minute film we see and hear Earle give his opinions on music. He said he originally wanted to be a country music singer but it got too commercialized. In one scene filmed outside the infamous RCA Studio B on Music Row in Nashville Earle spouts off that this was the place where Elvis, Johnny Cash and Roy Orbison recorded their classics. Elvis sure did but not the other two. I think Earle was thinking of Sun Studios, four hours away in Memphis.

The film really jumps around and there are long scenes of empty factories and empty fields. Schroeder then stops to interview folks like store keepers and retired contractors who have nothing to do with music. The director always asks What do you like about America? and the answers are usually Freedom, but this countys in trouble economically.)

There is a section about the mountain folk in Appalachia where Earle lived for a short time. He talks about drug OxyContin and the how dangerous the drug wars were in those communities. He does hint that thats where he first got involved in drugs that messed with his mind.

There are some useable and some odd interviews here too. Country music authority John Rumble is interviewed at the Country Music Hall of Fame. And, later John Carter Cash (Johnnys son) is interviewed at the Cash homestead.  We hear from the owner and star of the Civil War Dinner Theater in Tennessee and Schroeder even got an interview with actor/director Kevin Costner who is only identified as a Country Musician. (Apparently Costner plays in a band called Modern West with his daughter Lillie!)

As I said the film is all over the place. Justin Townes Earle fans will find SOME interest in his comments. (Im a big JTE fan from his early albums but hes slowed some of his best performances down to a crawl.) There are brief performance segments in the film.

What will interest JTE fans most is the bonus on this Blu-ray. It is a 58-minute performance from a 2012 concert at Pace University in New York which was to be a tribute concert to Woody Guthrie. Joe Pug and The Lone Bellow were there but their solo performances are excised. Justin does long rambling introductions and sings about 10 songs. None were written by Woody Guthrie. JTE says he was performing in the Spirit of Woody. The vocals for the songs were not well miked and  unless you know them  youll have a hard time with the lyrics. The camera work is great though and Pug and Lone Bellow sing harmony on one song. Adding to the quirkiness of this bonus is that the director leaves the camera running after the last song and for nearly two minutes all you see is the audience filing out of the theater. Then it ends  with no credits. The songs are indexed but there is no song selection page.
As with other Arthaus releases, there is a 20-page booklet enclosed in the package with an interview with Schroeder in both English and German.

I struggled to come up with a star rating for this Bluray . Id really like to give it 3.5 stars. Much of it drags and there seems to be a hidden political agenda that the director is trying to make that gets mixed up in the poor editing. So Ill give it four stars and hope that my words will help guide you.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8664799,4,B00LA9L9EG,"This documentary, apparently made by some German filmmakers, takes an oversimplified view of the American South.  Their generlizations concerning attitudes towards guns, etc. go so far as to be comical.  That said, they scored some great interviews and concert footage -- notably Justin Townes Earle and Caitlin Rose.  Plus there's a great band I never heard of in a Nashville bar that really rocks.  So I enjoyed it and recommend it to roots music or alt-country fans.",1414800000,,469,5.0519480519480515
8664800,5,B00LA9L9EG,"""Country Roads  -- the Heartbeat of America"" is a documentary of American country music from a seemingly unlikely source. The film is directed and produced by the German film director Marieke Schroeder.  Schroeder (b. 1970) has produced documentaries on Mozart, Richard Strauss, Schiller, and black opera singers, among other subjects. In the interview which accompanies this film, Schroeder explains her interest in country music.

""In the mid-80's when I was on a school exchange in the USA, I discovered that Americans are a very emotional people. I come from a pretty down-to-earth background, and such susceptibility to emotions was new to me.  I was impressed by people's willingness to admit to strong feelings like love, heartache, and longing.  And ever since then I have not been able to get country music out of my system. So when a new generation of country singers emerged in the USA, I decided the time had come to make a film about country music.""

The film offers a view of both country music and America. Schroeder travels by-ways and little known paths in America's urban and rural areas. Most of the film is set in the American Southeast with an emphasis on Appalachia. There are scenes of mountain hollows, trailer parks, dusty roads, small bars and restaurants, as well as of iconic places in country music such as Nashville's Ryman Auditorium. The movie is beautifully photographed and well narrated.

The film includes interviews with many contemporary country music performers and with admirers of the genre.  It also includes footage of well-known country musicians and offers a view of a history of the music.  The contemporary performers focus on Justin Townes Earle (b. 1982) who has had a difficult life battling his own inner demons and who has attained a wide following. Schroeder interviewed Earle extensively for this film, an accomplishment in itself.  He proves himself highly intelligent and articulate about the nature of his music and its history. Other contemporaries in the film include Caitlin Rose, John Carter Cash, Jr. and Kevin Costner.

The film examines historical singers including the Carter family, Hank Williams, and Johnny Cash.  But Woody Guthrie receives the most extensive treatment as Justin Townes Earle looks to Guthrie as his primary influence.  Besides the musicians and the lovers of the music, the film includes interviews with Dr. John Rumble, a music historian for the Country Music Hall of Fame.

Throughout the film, country music is described as storytelling, usually of the sad elements in the lives of ordinary people, including love, cheating, drinking, drugs and divorce. The film emphasizes the prevalence of drug use and the drug trade in rural areas where one would not suspect such a strong presence. It ties in country music with other forms of American folk, including blues, and honky-tonk and finds the character of the music in authenticity as opposed to commercial make-overs. The people interviewed offer differing perspectives on politics and country music.  Some of the early singers were on the American left while much of the contemporary music appears in some respects more conservative in  character. Some, including Earle, see the music as apolitical. Economic hardship is a prevailing theme of the music, regardless of politics.

Many of the people interviewed express the opinion that the United States is headed in a rootless or wrong direction. The film and the music include a strong sense of nostalgia for a view of America's past. The portrayal of the past could be questioned. Several people are asked what they like most about the United States.  The answer uniformly is ""freedom"" -- the ability to do what one wants with one's life free from overburdening government interference.

The film also includes a lengthy bonus track of a concert by Justin Townes Earle performed at Pace University. I had not heard Earle before.  In his concert, he emphasizes Guthrie's influence.  His songs are of the life of wandering, but a surprising number are set in neighborhoods of New York City. I enjoyed getting to know his music even though it is not my style.

""Country Roads"" is a meticulously documented and well produced film. Schroeder is perceptive and well-informed but also obviously stands at some distance from the music and its followers.  Although this film will appeal to devotees of country music, the primary audience will probably be people such as myself -- those with an interest in country music from the outside taking a look in. The film is produced by Art Haus Musik and distributed by Naxos.  Naxos kindly sent me a review copy.

Total Time:
Documentary:  89 minutes
Earle Concert  60 minutes
