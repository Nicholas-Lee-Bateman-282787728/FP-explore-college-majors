410913,1,6302000815,"I hated this movie! As a 2000 A.D. reader (the comic from which this short story is taken) I was bitterly dissapointed by this film. I am normally a big fan of ""cult"" movies, but while watching this I was so bored  that I was very tempted to just stop the tape. The plot itself is decent  enough, but unfortunately the film is just trying too hard to make a  statement about nothing! For fans of the original story, you will be almost  certainly dissapointed by the cack-handed way the drug induced  ""religious hallucination"" sequence is portrayed. Such a shame!",953337600,7,562,4.58

You have the bleak future of a worn out  planet.  The acting, although not stellar doesn't suck.  You get some fun  cameos too.  Iggy Pop as a DJ, Lemmy (Moterhead) as a cabbie, Carl McCoy  (Fields of the Nephilm) as a drifter, and there are couple of others that  seem familier.  This movie has scenes I've always wanted to see, including  the best what not to do when your about to be attacked by a horror moments  yet put on film.  Very good SF/Horror  Not what I'd call Merchant Ivory  material though.  This film hits you upside the head with a metal claw.  It's a great ride!

410916,4,6302000815,"the action was difficult to followdue to director attempting to make scenes very dark and forboding. The sex scenes were  pretty rawand kind of took on a life of theirown. The character developement was average with what  appeared to be anhonest attempt to get the audience to sympathize with the  hero and his girl friend. The special effects were very goodand probably are  what helped carrythis movie through some of the justbarely tolerable  dialogue. I felt that it was as a whole agood attempt but with alittle  better direction could have beena muchbetter film. But still worth watching  for fansof sex,violence,and the sci figenre.

410998,5,6302000815,"Loved it! Great trashy flick, certainly not for the kids. Good soundtrack and promos from Iggy Pop, Lemmy. Raunchy, gory, full of laughable acting in the right spots. Really not a terrible way to spend 90 minutes if you are into bad cinema. I was amazed to find out that this was from 1990, and that I'd not been privy prior. There are a few films that pull of the futuristic, post-apocalyptic theme, complete with robots and cyborgs and the like. This is not one of them. This, rather, is a trash homage to those kinds of films. Roger Corman was likely enraged to see his style so brazenly displayed without his name attached, though Richard Stanley more than delivered in his stead. McDermott likely looks back on this little gem with both shame and reverence.",1466640000,,762,4.610294117647059

Most of the movie is set in Jill's apartment, Dylan McDermott is totally unsuited for his role, Shades is an annoying and underdeveloped character, the plot is wafer thin despite the interesting subject matter and the MARK 13 looks and moves like something left out of The Terminator.

411079,2,6302000815,"Unless you're a really devoted fan of no-budget B movies, don't believe the hype. Stanley's cult rep as some kind of mad genius is hardly on view here. It's just a slow, dull Terminator wannabe basically shot on one set with hipster cameos by Iggy and Lemmy. As in most no-budget feature-length B movies, nothing happens for long stretches while the not terribly talented cast members stand around and talk talk talk. Then the music gets loud and someone throws around a few buckets of fake blood. Then back to nothing much going on. Rinse and repeat. Pretty much indistinguishable from countless other movies of this type.",1437523200,2,623,4.831775700934579

The best thing going for it is the robot design which still looks great.  Production design and red color palette fit everything well.

In a futuristic society, one that has destroyed the planet with pollution and radiation, the best Christmas gift is a piece of scrap metal. It seems the government has initiated population control by creating a terminator robot that kills people and not just rebels. Most of the filming is done inside Jill's (Stacey Travis) apartment.

For a low budget sci-fi, it was done fairly well. I watched the special 2-disc limited edition ($2.99 Mountain View Movies) which included a second disc which was mostly a Richard Stanley ego fest. We had commentary by Richard, previous short films by him, a super 8 version of Hardware and deleted scenes. This wouldn't be bad except except Richard needs to stay behind the camera and not in front of it.

411125,5,6302000815,"Honestly, if they had more money, this movie would have been just another over-budget flop.  However, this tight-budget production crucible, makes it a gem of a time capsule of its time.

Historically the late-80s to early-90s is now know as the cyberpunk era of Silicon Valley.  The movies music, costume, big-and-in-a-room-corner computers and over all wanna-be Film Noir ""Blade Runner feel"" brings back my memories of the clubs, parties and heavy metal girls of that time.  Fond memories of the ""hard new edge"" technologies I worked on in warehouse lofts in San Francisco, down the peninsula, along the valley of spare offices in Industrial Parks of Palo Alto, Mountain View, Sunnyvale, Bandley Drive in Cupertino and closed storefronts of downtown San Jose started to feel like the prototypes were right in front of me running code written that day with the rework solder on the printed circuit boards still cooling down.

Heavy Metal was still king in the clubs and personal computers were hitting mainstream.  Many consider the Golden Age of Cyberpunk starting with the release of William Gibsons Neuromancer series (why there was no movie deal is a Greek tragedy) and slowing burning out with the release of Billy Idols Cyberpunk album and the Hackers movie.  To many, it ended with the dot-com boom as web pages reached parity with Usenet group activity.

It was a time when the first wearable and mobile systems came on the market from the decades ahead of its time Newton to countless startups that came and went.  The first Virtual Reality systems came to market as a novelty giving the public a taste of cyberspace.  Watching this movie in the now matured mobile technology and finally ambulatory wearable systems market in the second decade of the Twenty First Century, Hardware gives a shockingly accurate foresight.

Of course there are anarchisms thats nearly impossible to avoid.  Land line video phones never came to be, the environment of the planet never became that screwed up as predicted and big hairstyles kept is knowing this is an 80s ear film complete with a hot redhead.  However, the concept of the self-repairing, self-assembling, heat-vison-driven and electrical-power-parasitic robot is shockingly vanguard for the time.  The actors go a good job and you can see genius in the script scene with he budget they had to work with it.

This movie along with Hackers (1995) makes for a very good Cyberpunk double-feature evening.  Get your parachute pants and a bowl of microwaved popcorn ready for this treat.  The second DVD in the package has a lot of extras completing the package.  It also explains why its sequel was never made.",1407974400,,2661,4.99546485260771

411187,5,6302000815,There are few movies from the early nineties that caught my eye while sneaking R-rated movies into my mothers house during the summers of my youth... THIS ONE was definitely on top! The cyber techies worst nightmare come to life!!!,1389571200,2,231,4.8
411188,4,6302000815,"Back when it was originally released, no one really knew who Dylan MacDermott (lead actor here) was.  Flying on the heels of The Terminator's success, this British/American indie film has a look and feel to it that belies its less than 2 million dollar production budget.  Director Richard Stanley's smart script, inventive plot twists, and sure-footed character development serve to elevate this creative post-apocalyptic fairy tale to something more than the sum of its parts.  Using absolutely no CGI creature effects, (at least none that I could ascertain) the film's clunky, monster metal-head protagonist nonetheless comes across as very unsettling indeed--like a  tricked-out, maniacal demon vacumn cleaner from Hell, complete with a skull-like head and equipped with more sinister appendages than an army Swiss knife.  The film's young sexy cast are an assembled hodgepodge of largely unknowns (though MacDermott had Steel Magnolias to his credit).  Inventive cinematography, editing, and even the quirky, metal-punk inspired soundtrack all seamlessly come together to present a brutal yet darkly poetic world where days are eternally lit by irradiated orange skies, and its inhabitants interact with one another in a type of existential game of cat and mouse.  If you're a fanboy (or fangirl) of movies like The Terminator, Bladerunner, Mad Max, and Book of Eli, you'll most likely love this.  But don't waste money on the standard DvD.  You definitely want this BluRay upgrade.  The picture quality of the digital transfer is superb, and there's even some nice bonus extras included.",1382745600,5,1593,5.412955465587045
411189,4,6302000815,"On the West Coast of the United States sits a battered, overcrowded, polluted, and quite possible radioactive wreck of a city. Into the high-rises of this hellish metropolis are packed artists, perverts, immigrants, soldiers, thieves, druggies, and hopeful young people, all eking out a meager existence in the aftermath of a devastating nuclear war. In from the deserts outside the city drifts our protagonist, a scavenger who gifts his lover with the discarded head of a military robot. Welded into the woman's sculpture, the robot soon comes back to life, and launches a campaign of terror against the megablock in which she lives...

That's a summary of Hardware, and it's also a summary of SHOK! Walter's Robo-Tale in Judge Dredd Annual 1981. Hardware was made without the consent of 2000AD magazine's editorial staff, and its creators have vehemently denied the connection, which is a shame because this film thoroughly and satisfying captures the essence of 2000AD comics. Mega-City 2 (unnamed here) is an unsettling mishmash of modern luxuries and filthy degradation, where one is just as likely to scrounge moldy cigarettes from the sewer as to order the house computer to lower the air conditioning. The script is endlessly bleak yet darkly cynical and droll, the plot mingles terrifying violent horror and Laurel and Hardy slapstick at will, and in general all that's missing is judges- who don't appear in SHOK anyway. The robot head even looks like one of the ABC Warriors, a semblance further lampshaded as the female lead slathers it with an American flag paint job.

Beyond the goofy-dark cyberpunk feel you would expect from a 2000 AD film, this movie completes itself with a pulsing, vaguely intimidating industrial score, some unexpectedly graphic (and frankly, pretty hot) sex, and compelling performances from all the principles, from neo-noir cowboy Mo Baxter (Dylan McDermott) to Flaky action girl Jill (Stacey Travis) to the grotesquely menacing neighbor Lincoln Weinberg (William Hootkins). British rock celebrities Lemmy and Iggy Pop also make inexplicable and quirky appearances, because at that point, why not? And the whole film is beautifully shot, at least as beautifully as you CAN photograph an industrial wasteland slowly burning down in the light of an unrelenting orange sun.

Had Hardware acknowledged its roots, it might stand as one of the better comic book movies out there. As it is, it remains a forgotten horror gem that provides far more than just what its premise implies.",1374710400,,2517,5.194581280788177
411190,3,6302000815,"I first saw Richard Stanley's Hardware back in the mid 90s on VHS, and was pretty blown away by its bold color scheme and gritty apocalyptic style. Certainly borne from music videos, it was still a uniquely stylized low budget film with a well earned dystopian viewpoint. Watching it for the first time on Bluray I was able to really appreciate how lovely the film looks, so crisp and detailed. Though in some ways it has dated a bit, I still enjoyed the grimy nature of its world, which seems more prescient now than ever. Constant surveillance, environmental nightmares, cynical human natures and indifferent corporate masters. Sadly quite timely.",1370736000,4,649,4.963302752293578

411192,4,6302000815,"Any movie featuring Lemmy Kilmeister of Motorhead can't be bad. Any movie featuring violent kill-bots gone beserk, bad-ass space marines, and smokin' hot sex scenes has to be completely awesome! Hardware contains all of those elements and more, blending sci-fi and horror into one hell of an exciting ride.

Dylan Mcdermott, of ""Hamburger Hill"" and ""In The Line of Fire"", stars as Moses, a space-marine on leave of duty from an intergalactic war. Having just returned to the now radiated world, he visits a Junker and acquires a strange, dismembered robot from a scavenger. He gives the robot to his inventive girlfriend Jill, played by Stacey Travis, who reassembles the bot by herself. Unfortunately, the robot turns out to be built specifically to exterminate enemies, and goes on a killing rampage. Also in the film is the voice of Iggy Pop as the hilarious radio DJ `Angry Bob'.

The true strength of Hardware lies in its outstanding visuals, especially its use of light and color. It's a film best viewed in a darkened room where the viewer can be completely immersed in the images on the screen. The orange glow of the radiated outer world give the viewer a perfect idea of the stale atmosphere and intense heat, while the blue and gray lighting of the indoor scenes give it a chilling and claustrophobic ambiance.  A common shot used in the film is one of bright lights reflecting off an actors face, representing how humans have become one with technology, and also just looking really cool.

The special effects in this movie are great for a low budget 90's sci-fi horror. Nothing beats a man being ripped apart at the waist, blood shooting from his torso. The set designs are great as well. Very quickly the viewer is introduced to the rustic futuristic, cyberpunkish world the characters inhabit. The costumes are convincing and don't look fake or cheesy at all.

Hardware contains all the elements of a great cult film. A sci-fi horror from the early 90's with likeable characters, an engaging plot, great special effects and visuals, a kick-ass soundtrack, top-notch casting, and epic deaths. Hardware is a gem worth checking out.",1363478400,,2144,4.895316804407713

I rented a lot of movies back then and I still do. I was amazed how with such a limited budget they made such a remarkable movie. This is by far one of the best SciFi Horror movies I have ever seen. Part of the problem is people go into it with high expectations partly due to marketing hype that lead people to believe it was of the quality of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Terminator-Blu-ray/dp/B000F9RB9Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Terminator [Blu-ray</a>] or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Road-Warrior-Blu-ray/dp/B000OCZD5G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Road Warrior [Blu-ray</a>]. It straight out isn't that kind of larger than life screen presence. It doesn't have a well known cast with a huge budget.

Assume it's a dingy, edgy, out of focus B movie with some rocking music and you might find yourself impressed. By the way this movie is meant to be rough looking and the characters are suppose to be strange. Long before&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project</a>&nbsp;and other ""reality"" movies Richard Stanley knew exactly what he was doing. I try to never go into a movie expecting anything. It's best to think it's going to be a so so rental. Now that we have got my B movie soapbox out of the way lets get to the meat of this, and I do mean meat. Imagine a guy wandering one of the many deserts after an apocolyptic war. He finds the metal skull of a robot in this wasteland while searching for scraps for his girlfriends welding sculpture artwork. Now while all this happens you are introduced to some odd perhaps even creepy, but memorable characters. You know the kind you love to cheer when they're thrown into a woodchipper. All the time we are blasted with some great 1990's hardcore metal music. Don't look for Pop or Rap here.

Spoiler alert: Meanwhile back at the apartment something odd happens, the robot slowly comes to life inside the huge metal sculpture the artist girlfriend has created. Fortunately for our hero the robot decides to go after those not so likeable characters(woodchipper fodder) first. Oh, did I mention this isn't any social droid but a sophisticated military weapons grade robot that has gone bonkers? Fortunately the girlfriend gets some assistance from a motly group of neighbors and is able to fend it off until the hero arrives. The ending has a twist, but then so does the whole movie. Personally I love it in case you haven't already ascertained it. I think it's a Stanley rough gem that hasn't got the credit it deserves. Fortunately for us there are a number of quirky sleepers, typically out of print(OOP), out there for us if you just know how to appreciate them. I just bought the Blu-ray version of this and I'm looking forward to seeing it in this format with some great extras not available at the time of the original release.

411238,4,6302000815,"This is just plain fun if you're looking for a cheesy sci-fi-horror that takes itself too seriously.  The premise is creative, in a schizophrenically misled kind of way.

 This movie may raise a brow to you as you wonder ""Why should I care about this?  I never heard of it.""  But to a seasoned movie fanatic this flick has quite an intriguing cast.  It includes Mark Northover (better known as the unforgiving landowner Burglekutt from Willow), Iggy Pop as Angry Bob the DJ, Dylan McDermott (Cemetery Man, Hamburger Hill, In the Line of Fire), and our heroine Stacey Travis (Phantasm II, The Super, Only the Strong).  It also made some money, grossing over $5 million on a $1.5 million dollar budget.

Somewhere in a post-nuclear apocalyptic world of crimson dunes and matching skies a man scavenges a severed robot head, among other shrapnel, half immersed in the sand.  Between his attire and the surrounding environs, it appears as if one of the land pirates in Cyborg or Mad Max has ventured to a more friendly-atmospheric Mars.  The technology in this ""futuristic"" world nearly rivals a 1980's arcade game.

Mo (McDermott) is a regular Joe with a too-good-for-him artistic redhead girlfriend Jill (Travis).  After months in the arid wasteland his fatigues are magically untattered and stain-free and his boots are still shiny, yet in the shower he practically sheds filth as if he was mud wrestling.  These tiny inconsistencies warn me to brace myself for quality film-making.  Despite the Hell hole suggested by the set designers, hair gel and the entertainment industry abound, apparently making it through the apocalypse unscathed.  They've got radio talk shows and GWAR music videos.  What more could you want back in 1990?

 So we (but not our heroine) come to discover that this robot head is from some self-repairing combat droid.  Its self-repair occurs by way of stop-motion telekinesis--it's a lot like an old Tool music video.  The mecha-regenerative head's face, detaching jaw, and crawling claws make me question whether or not Guillermo del Toro used this as his idea for the Golden Army soldiers in Hellboy 2.  So similar, in fact, I find it doubtless!  Other than the self repair scene and the head, this kill-droid is pretty lame-looking.

 Jill ends up trapped with this terror of a droid in her apartment.  The effects, acting and action are all very poor.  This may be the worst killer robot movie ever.  However the idea was pretty cool and likely fueled movies like Virus and Hellboy 2 with some great innovations.  The end gets a bit weird-trippy and the gore is funny.  In the end this drone, which has all of the dexterity of a drunk NYC hobo, is defeated by a hot shower.  Strangely enough, when you clean up a hobo they're much less off-putting as well.

 Despite all the flack I'm flinging at it, I enjoyed it.  It's a bit slow, but it has some interesting ideas and effects (for its time).  If you appreciated the computerless effects of the 80's and some mindlessly silly sci-fi flicks, then this should be right up your alley.",1320451200,,3062,4.825

A 20 minute plot stretched out 'forever.' Don't bother watching it. Oh, and the XXX dialog doesn't help better this film a bit!",1318982400,3,401,4.506849315068493

However, even with all the great special features and commentary and sound, there is no trace anywhere of English subtitles nor closed-captioning.  Being one who is hard of hearing, and not able to pick up all of the dialogue (especially when it's quiet and the characters are whispering), I've got a better chance of figuring out the lyrics on a Cannibal Corpse CD than the dialogue in the movie.  Yeah, this is not exactly Shakespeare being recited, but I like being able to get all of the details throughout the movie in case I miss an important plot point or something.  Basically all I'm saying is...shame on the studio and the distributor for not including at least closed-captioning, though subtitles would have been preferred so the whole screen isn't getting boxed out by the text from closed caption.  I definitely would have given this movie a 5-star rating if either one had been included.  Oh well....",1314230400,2,1082,4.698412698412699

411282,5,6302000815,"I love this movie! It's quirky, low-budget and just different! I saw it and found it originally on VHS and my nephew accidentally tore a corner off the package, but I forgave him, he was only 3 at the time.

However, the DVD is amazing! But watch out for the cheaply made packaging it comes in. The plastic is rather fragile and the holders barely hold in the 2 DVDs included. I had ordered one copy and found out the holder clips for Disc 2 were broken and pieces were scattered all over disk 1. I returned that copy and got a 2nd copy, which has a similar problem, but the clips are barely intact, so I'll take good care of that part.

I love the quality of the movie, how it was digitally restored, the extras are awesome and I'm planning on watching the included 8mm original version of the movie. If you ever saw this movie and wanted it, grab it fast! It's a good variation of the Terminator story, good special effects, awesome metal music, grungy look and rather touching in spots. It's also weird enough to make it rather unique in feel. I'd give the movie itself 5/5 and the DVD packaging 4/5",1285977600,,1102,4.318840579710145
411283,3,6302000815,"i was 18 when i first caught a glimpse of this film. that was 20 years ago. time has a way of both dulling the recollection and creating a longing for things that we somewhat remember. This movie has some good atmosphere and a weird but admittedly effective soundtrack. Some of the images are visually stunning in their use of light, texture and sound. the contrast/combination of Mo's cold metallic grip on Jill's pale, moist and supple skin in the shower scene was artistic and understated unlike some scenes which are mostly gratuitous and languid. The baby tethered to it's lifeless mother in the stairwell is another riveting image.
the killer robot is actually more threatening before it begins to assert itself. the foreboding red eyes and lifeless stare promise much more than what is ultimately delivered. Mo's death scene has nice editing and once again the score does not disappoint. The plot is straight forward and the acting is standard fare. this film has potential and probably would benefit nicely from some good ol' fashioned CGI and a little less sex. not a terrible addition to a well rounded sci-fiction collection.",1281744000,2,1136,4.921875
411284,4,6302000815,"Having never seen Hardware before, but hearing lots of hype around it's release on DVD/Blu-Ray, I was interested. I checked out a couple trailers, looked like a fun movie and decided to pick it up based off those.

My big complaint here is that I found the trailers to be misleading - going by those you'd expect a mix of Terminator, Alien and gory, sci-fi horror titles. Unfortunately, going in with those expectations, I left a bit disappointed: there is a bit of sci-fi and a little ""gore"", but overall I felt it was pretty tame (at least by todays standards). Unlike the action-packed trailer, the movie only had a couple action scenes.

Some might say this isn't a bad thing - story is more important than action, but going in with those expectations, it's a bit of a change from what I was expecting.

I found the movie to be enjoyable - not great, but above average and entertaining. I have a feeling it's one of those ""You had to be there.."" movies, where those who saw it 20 years ago will really appreciate it, and it will earn some new fans today but won't have the same impact. I thought the cinematography, sets and lighting were fantastic! Same for the music. Amazing job on those, and better than a lot of todays' stuff. (I can't say for sure, but I imagine this was a low-budget movie, which makes this even more impressive).

Video quality on the blu-ray was very nice as well (again, even more impressive considering it was a lower-budget). Not crystal-clear like modern HD video, but a definite improvement over DVD Quality.

Audio was also good, but nothing too incredible.

Extras were great, even better that they were in HD!

Overall a good Blu-Ray package, an above-average movie, but just don't go into it expecting it to be too much like the trailer. It has those scenes, but they're a much smaller part of the movie than the trailer leads you to believe.",1280275200,2,1881,4.563798219584569
411285,2,6302000815,"I pride myself on being a movie connossieur. I like all genres, especially, horror, thrillers and sci-fi movies. I purchased this movie because of the editorial review that I read on both Amazon and on the DVD jacket itself. Despite the hype, it was not quite what I had expected. I enjoyed Terminator alot better than this movie. The plot and the special effects are much to be desired. Gratuitous sex? Yes. Entertainment value? Gets a 2 star rating from me. Definitely, not one of the better pictures I have seen.",1278115200,2,515,4.670329670329671
411286,4,6302000815,"When I first saw this film I was struck by it's visual intensity. Even as I realized that I was a bit confused by the way some of the action scenes played out the whole thing stuck in my brains. It disappeared, as did my VHS copy, and I waited (and waited) for it to re-surface on DVD. It didn't happen and I thought how odd that a movie like this would fall through the cracks. Finally it was forced back up through those cracks and there was no question this was going into my library.

Well..........in watching it again, the better parts were even better but the not so good parts were not so gooder. Overall it is still a striking vision. The camera work, set designs, acting are all worthy of note. On the downside is the music score. It sounds as though composer Simon Boswell wrote the score with a sledgehammer. It's way too heavy handed. The tie in of the droid's name to the bible is a nice touch. It's good seeing Dylan in a pre-fame role and Stacey Travis is real easy on the eyes.

The story is cool. Dylan combs the wasteland for discarded goodies and finds this dismembered droid he thinks will thrill his artistically inclined girlfriend. On the way to see her he stops by his junk dealer buddy's place so he can have a look see. Then it's on to the girlfriend where she proceeds to turn said droid into a sculpture with American flag stylings. The droid comes back from it's sleep, puts itself back together and mayhem ensues.

The post apocalyptic setting tied in with advanced (yet retro looking, Bladerunnerish) technology gives the proceedings a great mood. Stacey's creepy, effeminate stalker/ neighbor adds a discomforting edge to the plot. And Dylan's doped up buddy adds some dark comedy to things.

Overall this is a good movie. As I mentioned earlier, some of the action/ climax scenes were a bit confusing in trying to figure out who was where in her apartment but, it's a minor complaint. As others have mentioned, this might not be for the casual viewer. There are some heady plot elements (the droid's poison smells like apple pie (Jemstone Files?)and the look is more artistic than slick, but if you're looking for something meatier than the regular Hollywood fare, this might be for you.",1276214400,5,2221,4.57286432160804

I suspect that this film may prove a little slow and ""silly"" for those weaned on todays glorified cartoons that pass for film these days,but to each their own...

No, my point in writing this is to share how FANTASTIC this disc looks,it truly is like watching for the first time! As much of the film is set in dimly lit locals,im seeing TONS of detail that I had never noticed before.

I enjoyed the grungy, post-apocalyptic atmosphere, sound track (esp. Order of Death) and the general off-the-wall weirdness, but what blew me away was Mo's pschedelic visions as he's dying after being injected with the killer robot's poison. The plot having already established that the victims basically experience an acid-trip death, the graphic, through-his-eyes psychedelic experience was visceral, fascinating and believable. That's not all that the film has to recommend it. It was, as others have noted, ahead of its time, and sophisticated in ways that go right over the heads of some of its mass-entertainment-conditioned detractors, but that scene was for me the most amazing segment of an amazing film.",1267574400,8,905,5.425531914893617

She loves it but later on it reassembles itself as a violent killing bio-mechanical combat cyborg called M.A.R.K. 13 which is hellbent on destroying turning the night into one long nightmare of pure terror.

Brilliant UK-US made Science Fiction horror thriller import from writer and director Richard Stanley is a gem all the way. I love how the director uses some religious subtext in the film even to a few of the characters and the idea behind this piece of cyberpunk pulp fiction and has a slasher-like twist to it much like the original Terminator did. The film features appearences by Iggy Pop and Lemmy of Motorhead fame with an outstanding score by Simon Boswell and soundstrack by Ministry & Public Image Ltd, it's a thrilling and go-for-the-throat thriller with terrific special effects and gore with decent acting that keeps you on your seat and never lets go into a nightmarish vision of the future.

However, if the story was editing down to fit the funding, there is some compensation in the stylist photography and the music (especially Order of Death by PiL). You can categorize this film as cyberpunk and you can compare the theme to a cross between Mad Max and Terminator, but actually it had the potential to go further than either of those franchises.

Acting contributes to the style - everyone in this movie is working hard and they certainly deliver. Nearly two decades have passed but this film still looks fresh.

So this quirky sci-fi romp may not make the A list but it sure beats out any film released by the Sy-Fy channel on American cable over the past five years!

If you like sci-fi movies from that era then this should be on your must-have list.

One of the few movies that not only wasn't worth the cost of a ticket, but worse, the loss of time spent watching it.

One of the few things I recall from this movie was the opening scene where you see a guy walking in the desert for 20 minutes.  Not 20 minutes of his life - 20 minutes of my life.  Now you would think that there would be some meaning to this - like the guy fighting off robots, or demons, or SOMETHING - no - I remember him just walking and walking in the desert doing nothing but wasting my time.

I have used this movie as the standard to compare bad movies to.  No movie has come close to this one.

It is strange the dichotomy of reviews, where a lot of people liked the movie and a lot of people feel it is a rotting piece of trash.

411397,4,6302000815,"Memories ... The first time I saw this film was at a sneak preview for members of the press at a tiny Times Square movie theater about two decades ago. This was back when Times Square wasn't family-friendly, when you scurried through the area with your hand on your wallet and tried harder than usual not to make eye contact. Hookers and drug dealers plied their wares in front of the strip clubs and sex shops, and movies that screened there bore X-ratings at best.

The director of ""Hardware"" attended the screening and spoke after the credits rolled. I don't remember a thing he said. I was too blown away by the orgy of industrial violence I'd just witnessed. ""Hardware"" is reminiscent, in ways, of ""Tetsuo: The Iron Man,"" which similarly assaults the senses with metallic clanks and clashes, but it's also a visionary mix-up of cyberpunk and steampunk sensibilities. The storyline is relatively simple, but the violence is visceral and, despite the subject matter, realistic. I always thought ""Hardware"" stood as a stark counterpoint to James Cameron's confusing and cartoonish ""Terminator"" movies; if humanity finds itself at war with machines, I think they'll be more like Richard Stanley's vision than Cameron's gleaming, silvery, illogical robots. (Seriously, if you can send killer robots back in time, why not just kill John Connor's great-grandfather?)

This is a well-crafted film that was ahead of its time. Give it a try.",1257033600,3,1436,5.029411764705882

411401,3,6302000815,"Nineteen years ago I remember going to see a little film called Hardware and I remember HATING it because I felt deceived by the trailers that shamefully advertised this film as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Terminator/dp/B000F9RB9Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Terminator</a>&nbsp;meets&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Road-Warrior/dp/B000OCZD5G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Road Warrior</a>&nbsp;which being a huge fan of both of those classic sci-fi films was precisely what I was expecting to see.  What I got, and was completely unprepared for, was a pornographic visual nightmare filled with gratuitous violence and an incoherent plot about some killer Terminator-esque combat droid found in the sands of a post-apocalyptic wasteland that's transformed into an industrial art sculpture by some hot chick and I remember wanting to walk out of the theater but felt compelled to at least get my (then) six bucks worth before leaving the theater offended and I never looked back...  until now.

A few years later I picked up the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hardware-soundtrack/dp/B000008GDT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hardware soundtrack</a>&nbsp;because I remembered it was the most memorable part of the film.  I loved Simon Boswell's haunting electronic score and the unforgettable Public Image Limited song the Order of Death which echoes in your head with ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/This-Is-What-You-Want-This-Is-What-You-Get/dp/B00000733R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">This Is What You Want...This Is What You Get</a>"" lyrics ironically summarizing my initial reaction to the film perfectly.  Around that time I happened to catch Richard Stanley's following film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dust-Devil-The-Final-Cut/dp/B000HEWGTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dust Devil - The Final Cut</a>&nbsp;which I really enjoyed with it's great visuals and also featuring a terrific Simon Boswell score.

When I saw that Hardware was released on Blu-ray I decided to give it another look.  It's amazing how the quality of blu-ray makes you revisit many films that you may not have otherwise particularly liked watching the first time around but I remembered the striking post-apocalyptic visuals and 80's industrial music video style and having appreciated Richard Stanley's succeeding films I knew he was a director with vision and made me decide to give it another chance.  Upon watching it I had remembered the exact moment that made me want to get up and leave the theater when Jill's perverted neighbor played by William Hootkins (yes that's Porkins from Star Wars) starts singing the ""wiberly-woberly walk"" and I still find his character repugnant but that's really the whole point.  Stanley is intentionally creating a dissonant atmosphere showing the deconstruction of culture precipitated by dependency on technology, intrusive surveillance and the pervasiveness of mass media and invasion of privacy.

Watching it now I can appreciate the film's socio-political undertones such as population control and the realization that this film was actually a few years ahead of its time anticipating the post-modern industrial motifs of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ministry/dp/B000PHW27M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ministry</a>.  To the film's credit, Richard Stanley's stylized vision is what sets Hardware apart from the formulaic commercialized mainstream blockbusters of today and somehow manages not to date itself too much and remains a completely unique independent film unlike anything I've really seen since.

Richard Stanley discusses his ideas behind the intended ""Hardware 2: Ground Zero"" script on the supplemental features that was written at the time of the first film but was never made due to legalities between studios that has prevented him from fully realizing his concept on a grander scale.  I actually found myself interested in seeing what Hardware 2 might look like made today with the latest advancements in special effects technology that would enable Richard to open up the canvas and let his ideas spill out onto the screen.  Watching the interview you can see that Stanley is a very intelligent and articulated artist who knows what he is talking about and has a precise understanding and vision for his craft.  There's also an excellent hour-long documentary ""No Flesh Shall Be Spared"" produced exclusively for the blu-ray that features all new interviews that will make you appreciate the film and the complications of working with visual effects pre-CGI along with deleted scenes, a German theatrical trailer and some of Stanley's short films including ""Incidents In An Expanding Universe"" the Super 8 genesis of Hardware.

Hardware is definitely not a film for everyone and if you you are looking for accessible sci-fi-/horror that's easy to swallow you won't get it here.  On the surface Hardware is a visceral nightmare whose disturbing and offensive imagery is conveying ideas and themes far more complex than the average mainstream audiences are simply willing or capable of grasping and most will find it a struggle to interpret the lines between self-indulgent art and purely cinematic entertainment.

411402,5,6302000815,"Yes, it's finally here on DVD and Blu-ray where it so rightfully belongs.  Richard Stanley's cult classic shocker Hardware is here in all its uncut glory, and just like Fangoria labeled it so long ago, it truly is one of the best sci-fi/horror films that you have never seen.  In a post-apocalyptic future, a soldier named Mo (Dylan McDermott) returns home to his metal-sculpting artist girlfriend Jill (Stacey Travis) with a robot head to give to her as something to work on.  Soon enough, we learn that the head is that of a murderous combat droid called the M.A.R.K. 13, and it isn't long before it starts to reassemble itself.  Filled with some truly scary and downright nasty moments, seeing Hardware all over again is like seeing an old friend again after a long absence.  Seeing it uncut is even better, and seeing it in the absolute best picture quality that it has ever had is the icing on the cake.  The special features are plentiful, including an hour long documentary featuring recollections and insights from Stanley, Travis, and others (sadly Dylan McDermott is nowhere to be found), an insightful commentary from Stanley, a collection of his short films, and an interview with Stanley where he discusses his original plans for a sequel that sadly never came to fruition due to Hardware's issues with multiple distributors.  All in all, it's great to have Hardware on DVD and Blu-ray, and seeing it get the treatment that it gets here is proof positive that there still is some justice in the world.",1255478400,4,1514,4.8
411403,3,6302000815,"I have been pretty harsh on this movie in the past. Mostly because when I saw it in theaters back in the day I was expecting much more than what was presented to me. It wasn't the fact the movie is low budget, because you really can't tell from the production. It was because the story had flaws. Enough flaws for a young sci-fi fan to pan the film entirely. Now that I have a more open mind and revisit the film I notice that it's not as bad as I once preached. It's still a flawed movie in my opinion, but it's not terrible in the least.

First off I have to give credit where credit is due. Hardware looks amazing. The production of the movie, the cinematography, the sets, the special effects; all give this movie a solid pass in creating a convincing post-apocalyptic world. This credit is given even more so when you realize the movie was made on a shoestring budget (roughly $1.5 million). You take that into consideration and the production value goes into the realms of amazing.

The soundtrack is another feather in this movie's cap. Composer Simon Boswell put in a healthy combination of electronic soundscapes, old west themes, and some classical music elements to the film. The mix of themes works and the music lends more to building the landscape. You also get 90's counter-culture nods with some music from Ministry and I think Motorhead (plus Public Image, LTD if you include the closing credits).

Acting is a positive nod from me as well. This movie has a lot of actors in the beginning of their careers (which makes sense considering the tiny, tiny budget) and their performances are no less polished than if this movie was set with established B-Movie actors. Not to say you get strictly B performances, but at the same time this isn't A material either. Dillon McDermott does well with a pretty simple character to work with. Stacey Travis, being essentially the star, pulls off the various facets of her character with subtle confidence. I left the best two for last. John Lynch gives a great performance in his supporting role and William Hootkins is both creepy and endearing as the perverted Lincoln.

Now that we covered the positive I am left with the negative. The premise of the movie itself is very interesting with a lot of potential. Instead I see so many misfires and passed opportunities in the plot and script that I remember why I hated the movie in the first place. How can such a menacing military robot (built for field warfare) with the power to recreate itself, concoct a batch of makeshift poison, and kill with impunity have such a mind-numbingly simple weakness in it's design? The script was already setting up so many possibilities on how to resolve the story (take down the rampaging robot) in a much better way. Some of which would have been theatrical masterpieces. Instead you get the quick fix that doesn't really connect with anything the movie built up to.

That's the big one for me. From there I found a number a little things that didn't make too much sense. One is Lincoln. Lincoln is an odd character. A good amount of time is established building up his elaborate obsession with Jill only to have the character be pretty insignificant in the grand scheme of things. Other are little quips that are better left for debate. Like why a government of a dying human race would have a sterilization program for its citizens? In the end, like I said, the movie is a mixed bag for me.

Now the Blu-Ray release of Hardware has a lot going for it. I saw the British Blu-Ray release so my observations are based on that and I'm assuming the American release is identical. Visually no other video release of Hardware comes close to the clarity of this Blu-Ray. That's not to say it's perfect by any means. There are lots of scratches and other blemishes that show up, and since this is BR they are noticeable. This movie needs some major restoration if that's the best transfer they can find. Now if you can forgive the dirt you will see better color and detail on this release. It's not perfect, but it's better than upscaling your Hardware DVD release. Audio is good. The British disk has two channel PCM only, but it had the audio fidelity where it counts. Sorry, no surround. All in all considering the age (and production cost) of this movie this may be the best it will ever get, and it's good enough.

The Blu-Ray release has a really great mess of extra features that are like having your own mini-film festival. You get four short films from directory Richard Stanley. The Sea of Perdition is the newest and runs at under ten minutes. The Voice of the Moon is a 30 minute documentary on Afghanistan. Rites of Passage and Incidents in an Expanding Universe are Super 8 short ""movies"" and are his earliest works. So you not only get Hardware you get close to half of all of the movies Stanley has directed (albeit the short ones).

There are also about four deleted and extended scenes on disk as well as a behind the scenes look at one scene. Additionally there is a brand new commentary track by the director Richard Stanley and producer Paul Trijbits that I heard was really informative.

Mixed bag or not this is an impressive movie all things considered. If you are already a fan of the movie there is no question that you should get this Blu-Ray. If you never heard of it, but love post-apocalyptic or rampaging robot movies with horror elements I think you will enjoy this movie enough for it to be worthwhile. If you are like me and prefer refined stories that fit well I still think you may appreciate Hardware. Just don't spend a lot of money on it.",1255305600,11,5614,4.567030784508441
411404,3,6302000815,"The little known 1990 thriller Hardware mimics many of the sci-fi masterpieces that preceded it, but still surprisingly succeeds in producing a creatively original post-apocalyptic setting and its fair share of unique ideas. Ultimately, it can't stand up to Ridley Scott's Alien or James Cameron's Terminator, but it's worth a look just to see how close it comes.

War-ravaged Earth resembles a harsher version of Tatooine where scavengers roam the wastelands and a thick orange haze blankets the skies. Moses (Dylan McDermott) and his brother Shades (John Lynch) cross paths with a cryptic stranger whose escapades combing the deserts find him in possession of a mysterious robot's head and hand. Seeking an appropriate Christmas gift for his estranged girlfriend Jill (Stacey Travis), Mo barters for the android parts, but quickly realizes his mistake when he discovers they belong to the highly advanced, self-repairing military droid M.A.R.K. 13 who begins a murderous rampage across Jill's apartment.

Bizarre characters fill out the cast and only McDermott and Travis attempt to play it straight. Mo provides a believable rogue soldier though Jill is realistically the hero of the film, exuding a little of the tough-girl attitude that worked so well for Ellen Ripley. Much like her obvious role model, she thankfully doesn't become overly gung-ho when she faces the powerful renegade robot throughout the climax. By far the strangest character inclusion is that of the perverted voyeur neighbor that spies on Jill from afar during intimate moments. Cult director Richard Stanley chooses to build the character into a truly disgusting villain, but then fails to have him act accordingly on his vile intentions, even when he's trapped Jill alone in her apartment. He becomes a wasted opportunity to drum up additional suspense and his departure doesn't bring the closure it should have. At least he manages to break out in a creepy singing session before then.

The special effects in Hardware provide the majority of accomplishment and appear as a cross between Terminator and Alien 3. Dark reds and burnt orange hues wash over the entire picture and desolate, debilitated buildings evoke the required post-apocalyptic feel. M.A.R.K. 13 himself is an interesting blend of leftovers from Terminator and Virus and his design and movement relate his primary function of destroying all life forms (though the slim cast doesn't allow as much of a killing spree as one would hope). Utilizing poisonous needles, saws, and blades makes the nearly unstoppable robot all the more frightening, though his appearance reflects the movie as a whole - lots of style but little substance.

Hardware takes a great idea (though not entirely original one) and limits the scope of its impact by giving a monstrous robotic villain a tiny apartment to play in. The compact setting affords a claustrophobic mood, but also fewer possibilities for massive mayhem. Though at times Hardware tries too hard to be cool (such as opera music infusing the final battle and a lengthy psychedelic poison-death scene), fans of obscure sci-fi thrillers will likely appreciate at least some aspect of Stanley's homage to the genre.

The only thing I knew about this film before seeing it was what had been in the commercials, and they did NOT advertise a horror film. I thought I was going to see the first truly cyberpunk movie, the commercial promised cyborg heroes in this epic post-apocalyptic world... Instead we got a monster maze in a cramped apartment building filled with techno-gizmos designed expressly to brutally kill someone yet barely disguised as modern conveniences. I remember audience members leaving the theater in DROVES. When the credits began to roll, I turned to my uncle, who was clearly traumatized, and apologized to him from the bottom of my heart. He told me point blank that he would NEVER see another film I recommended again. Now that I think back on it, this might be why he doesn't like horror films...

I've never seen it again, swore I never would. Lately, however, I've had a change of heart, and I'll tell you why in one word: ""Psycho"". Think about it.

What would it have been like being one of the first to see ""Psycho""? I mean NOT knowing the shocking twist before you see it. It was a brilliant piece of marketing on Hitchcock's part, and now that I think about it, I'm pretty sure members of that audience felt exactly how I felt when I saw ""Hardware"".

411442,2,6302000815,"Hardware (Richard Stanley, 1990)

After being surprisingly impressed with Dust Devil and a couple of Richard Stanley's recent documentaries, I finally went back to the movie that started it all, the surprise smash hit Hardware. And I have to say that Dust Devil must have shot my expectations through the roof, because what a disappointment this movie is. Everyplace Dust Devil sparks with originality and outright creepiness, Hardware just sits there limp and cliched. Do you remember (lord, I hope you don't) a godawful Jean-Claude Van Damme flick that came out right around the same time called ""I"" Come in Peace? So many things about this movie reminded me of that, not least the disappointment at how a pretty nifty science fiction conceit just got pounded into the dust. (In my defense, at the time, Van Damme was not as much a film-world joke as he is today.) And you know what the worst part is? The first ten minutes set us up for the best science fiction movie ever.

Picture it: Earth, sometime in the post-apocalypse future. The city is entertained by a manic radio DJ named Angry Bob, played by Iggy Pop. As we open, a guy in a gas mask is wandering through a desert of red sand in the film's most beautifully-shot sequence. We cut to two guys, Moses Baxter (Dylan McDermott--yes, Dylan McDermott in a science fiction movie!) and his trusty sidekick Shades (In the Name of the Father's John Lynch), an entrepreneurial type who, as we first see them, is trying to convince Baxter that the insane risk they'd be taking in travelling to the now bombed out city of New York would be well worth the rewards they could reap by bringing back such things as kitchen appliances. Yes, folks, the world after a nuclear war is a beautiful thing. Moses and Shades are on their way to the local pawnshop to see Alvy (Mack the Knife's Mark Northover in one of his few screen appearances), a guy who deals in, shall we say, less than legal stuff scavenged form the wastes. Baxter gives him a sack of stuff and he heads into the back to price it. That's when the nomad from the first scene appears, now sans gas mask. He looks kind of familiar, but it's after Baxter addresses him and he speaks that it hits you. It's Carl McCoy! Carl McCoy, the leader of the best band in the universe, Fields of the Nephilim, in his only screen appearance! He and Baxter haggle over a piece McCoy (credited only as the Nomad) picked up in the Glass Flats, which seems to have been some sort of old manufacturing area; the head of a robot. Baxter buys it from the Nomad for fifty credits (which, it seems, is a small fortune in this economy; Baxter gets ten from Alvy for his entire bag) as a Christmas present for his girlfriend, Jill (Stacey Travis, recently of The Great Buck Howard), a sculptor. The Nomad leaves just as Alvy gets back, and the scene is over, as we've set up the movie. And then... the Nomad is gone. We never see him again. Nor Alvy. In fact, most of the rest of the film takes place in Jill's apartment. You see, the robot head was the prototype of a very unstable, and very dangerous, weapon called the M.A.R.K.13, which is capable of both repairing itself and utilizing other materials to power itself. So when Jill welds it into a sculpture...

At this point, the movie becomes a standard survival-horror flick with science fiction elements. And, really, it's not bad for a standard survival-horror flick with science fiction elements, but the first ten minutes of this film are so well-done that the final eighty being standard is bound to cause a major disappointment. I mean, everything about that scene is perfectly done, and it's the things Stanley did in that scene that he managed to pull off for the whole movie in Dust Devil. The cinematography is stunning, and when the movie shifts to constant interior scenes, it goes away almost entirely. Simon Boswell's music is great (when Iggy Pop isn't spinning old Iggy records, of course), and it does stay great throughout, but it's got that whole wide-open-spaces feel to it that works so well for blasted-out deserts, and not so well for cramped spaces. Two great actors used for a single scene? There are other cameos like this sprinkled throughout, most notably Motorhead vocalist Lemmy Kilmister as a taxi driver (who, of course, blasts Motorhead). The banter between Baxter and Alvy is quick and funny, which obviously isn't the kind of script you keep going with when you get into survival-horror mode. Etc.

If you don't mind the full price of a rental just to see the first ten minutes of a movie, by all means rent it. Or if you like survival-horror flicks and you've seen everything you've got a dozen times, you'll also find a lot to enjoy here. It's obviously a must for Fields of the Nephilim (or Iggy Pop) fans. Everyone else, if you catch it on late-night cable, watch it, but don't go out of your way. **",1243814400,2,4881,4.600459242250287

411485,3,6302000815,"Hardware is a British/American low budget SF horror film that has some good production values considering the shoestring it was made on but has too many rough edges to make it cut art house appeal but may have some cult grains. When Hardware arrived it received good reviews noting that this was a young film maker on the rise. Probably the main reason to watch this is because of the career of Richard Stanley who made the very interesting Dust Devil after this one. There is also the notoriety this film generated when it landed the director in a lawsuit with 2000 AD comic producers because of the story.

Hardware is a post-apocalyptic SF horror about a robot which assembles itself in a woman's apartment and tries to kill her and the occupants. The build up is very slow and most of the film takes place either in the desert or in the apartment. Some of the special effects are pretty gruesome. There isn't much of a story here and it is often boring in parts but these are the types of films that independent film makers need and should get their hands on. It is far from a bad first effort.",1210032000,3,1098,4.435643564356436

hardware mark 13 is just one of those films that if you get it,you really get it.if you dont,ya got no taste or imagination.if your into  20 minute drawn out car chases(terminater) and men made of liquid metal ,hardware is not for you,it borders on what could be.nothing wrong with that.

although its sci-fi its not completely out of control with time travel every couple years and the villian is brutal,then he's nice and then who cares.i think the us gross for hardware was 6 mil..not bad for a 2 mil budget.and with video and dvd the following grew and grew.how much did the terminater/cameron franchise cost..too much for too little...you can by the whole terminater series on amazon for 2 bucks,ive sold 1 copy of hardware for over $100.00...that says it all!!

no sequels although without hard moe and his metal hand it would be tough to pull it off,but id always welcome a sequel,even if it stunk,it would still be a far cry better than the same old regurgitated rip off on terminater,aliens and anything else that made a few bucks one summer.

harware mark 13 is a classic and will always remain close to my heart and at the top of my dvd collection

1 - Iggy Pop (Stooges / solo) as the DJ

2 - Lemme (Motorhead) as a cab driver

3 - Carl McCoy (Fields of the Nephilim) as the scavenging desperado in the beginning of the film

The rarest and infinitely coolest is the Carl McCoy appearance since the dude was basically a recluse and is an obscure cult figure anyway. His character is also the weirdest of the 3. The legendary frontman for the epic Goth outfit Fields of the Nephilim appears early in the film as a desperado roaming the post-apocalyptic desert badlands in search of relics that might have some scavenge value. He enters the post-nuclear pawn shoppe and growls only 1 line, ""Where's the little man?"" The funny thing is that he basically plays himself; he looks and sounds exactly like he always does and that fits perfectly well into the motif of Hardware.",1130371200,7,928,4.572289156626506

I realize that hard-core sci fi fans do not care much for realism or continuity but let's consider the plot here (SPOILER alert).

The movie starts out in this hot red desert like world. We're not sure if there's been some apocalypse or it's just your run- of-the-mill sci fi dystopia. No explanation is given for why some things look like a wasteland and some things are built up and modern.

Moses is a Marine or some kind of soldier but he never seems to report for duty. He gets this robotic head from a scrap dealer for his live-in girlfriend Jill, who's an artist. They talk about children and Moses says that he's ""given up"" on that idea a long time ago. There's the suggestion that some calamity has made people sterile. Despite this, I seem to remember a reference in the movie about the government sterlizing people. Say what?

The robot head manages to build itself a body from Jill's artistic scrap supplies and procedes to go on a killing spree. It seems that the government has created the ""MARK 13"" android to hunt down the populace to stop overcrowding. Say what again? People are sterile or being sterilized, the world outside their city is a wasteland and overpopulation is a concern?

Moses has a friend, some sort of space jockey named Shades. With the world so dystopian, it's a bit odd that people are still going into space. Anyway, it's up to these three to try to stop the MARK 13.

As overdone as this plot is, you might say it's okay for a late night TBS movie but then suddenly there is a sideplot of this pervert who likes to spy upon Jill. He calls her up and says he wants to do something rather pornographic with a string of popcorn. When this line was uttered, everyone in the theater about gasped or laughed in embarassment. What the point of this was, who can tell. Of course, the MARK 13 blasts him in short order so who really cared.

Bullets and shotgun pellets have no effect on the MARK 13. Worse, the robot kills off the main character Moses. Okay fine. But Moses dies with a big chunk of the movie left! Shades? Well he's too busy getting wasted on some sort of drug. That leaves Jill. Mind you, all kinds of small arms don't work on the thing but Jill's baseball bat slays the beast. My friend dubbed it ""the emotional baseball bat.""

One of the songs in the movie was a repetitive track with the lyrics ""This is what you want, this is what you got.""

As we left the theater, one of the group I was with got up and said ""This is what we wanted...and this is what we got.""",1121385600,7,2715,4.318271119842829

411493,4,6302000815,"The key thing about this movie is its atmosphere.  Desolation and gloom pervade everything.  The characters in this post-nuclear dystopia are making do with all that is left to them; fashioning machinery, livelihood, and culture out of  the detritus scattered all around.  The desert outlands, through which travel is sometimes necessary, are glaringly bright and lifeless and radiation swirls in the air.  In contrast to this are the dusky, jagged, and metallic tones of the city where most of the story takes place.  And finally, the sountrack music ( especially the hauntingly synthetic Public Image Ltd. song ) is very fitting and it perfectly reinforces the industrial harshness of the landscape and the overall sense of doom.

  Now the story itself was criticized at the time of its release for being derivative.  And rightly so, since its a pretty obvious combination of ""Terminator"" ( a seemingly unstoppable machine that's built to kill ) and ""Alien"" ( claustrophobic enviroment ).  Yet despite these familiar elements, this film has a unique feel all its own and is just as enjoyable as the ones it borrows from.  It really stands up to repeat viewings ( try to catch it on Showtime Beyond ) not only because of the aesthetics, but because of the warmth and affection between the main characters ( the artist, her boyfriend, and her boyfriend's best friend ) despite the omnipresent gloom.  This type of human connection seems to be missing from most sci-fi ( Star Trek excluded ) and its refreshing to see.  Now what about that DVD already?",1111536000,,1552,4.9192307692307695

It offers a good deal more than a futuristic society on the brink of destruction. The unusual character personalities and the psychotic nature of the machines takes it a notch above many movies it is sometimes compared to. The camera work and visual effects are excellent. A great soundtrack makes it all the better. I recall when I saw it I thought Iggy Pop's was incredible.

411548,5,6302000815,"...A Nasty Mark-XIII military Warbot head---in a pear tree!

Well, not exactly---but that's the plot of Richard Stanley's surreal, cyberpunk, brutal, bloodthirsty dreamscape of a sci-fi flick ""Hardware"", which you should do whatever you need to do to beg, borrow, or steal a DVD copy. It's sick, bloody, good stuff.

First off, know that ""Hardware"" director Richard Stanley is a Hollywood wild-man: notorious for all sorts of brooding, decadent fits, he was sacked on the 2nd day of filming for the ill-fated (doomed!) ""Island of Doctor Moreau"". He snuck back on set clad in nothing but a dog-mask. Takes guts, Richard---takes guts.

Anyway, he was 24 when he helmed this sick, sacrilegious, probably evil little flick about the ultimate Christmas present gone wrong. Wayfaring soldier Moses Baxter (the grounded Dylan McDermott, who brings a lush breeze of reality to all the hynpotically surreal surroundings) finds a severed robot head in the hopelessly irradiated desert and hauls it back to his sexy, crazy artist-lover Jill (played wantonly by the yummy Stacey Travis...yeah). Turns out it's the head of the notoriously unreliable military warbot Mark XIII, and it has a nasty fetish for a little Yuletide bloodletting. Deck the Halls with Boughs of Holly, indeed.

I was relatively young and naive when I first saw ""Hardware"", and my young self thought the thing was positively immoral. I was shocked. The Mark XIII warbot is an angry young man: it kills viciously, indiscrimately, and then cloaks itself in the raw nuclear apocalypse reds and oranges and shadows of Baxter and Jill's little love shack. And mind you, this thing kills *brutally*. People are sliced in half and boy oh boy, the blood spills out like Franco-American carbonara sauce.

But the real treat here is the grim, brutal, low-oxygen nihilistic setting. We have reshaped the future, says director Stanley. We have modified it. We have tweaked it. We have custom-designed it. Death is now art, art is now Death. Isn't it only fair that Death gets to tweak us?",1101859200,37,2036,5.065671641791044

With the dearth of truly excellent science fiction movies out there, I would think that more people would have been exposed to this very fine, terrifying science fiction thriller. However, if this movie does truly come out on DVD as is rumoured, perhaps more people will get a chance to experience this canonical classic.
This film has every factor you would want in a scary science fiction movie -- a killer robot, artistic statements, a kick-rear-end soundtrack, superior acting, political statements, drugs, the snuffing out of humankind, and even good-old  weirdness (""wibbly-wobbly walk""). However, what really sets it apart from the slew of mediocre sci-fi thrillers in this genre is the exceptional screenwriting, which develops the tension, suspense, and terror that grips you so effectively when you watch this movie.
If you like ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"", you'll love this movie. In fact, you will love this movie even if you don't like science fiction in general. The only people who shouldn't watch this movie are those who don't like scary movies, because this one will absolutely *terrify* you.",1087516800,10,1175,5.151832460732984

1) The soundtrack is incredible, and will hopefully be Dolby encoded.
2) The amazing use of reds in the color of the images always seems to bleed on VHS and a digital rendering is most welcome.
Hardware is one of the most stylistic films to ever be released into the mainstream.  It resembles an art film that you would expect at Sundance much more than it does something that would come from Hollywood.
Forget the rather lame plot and look at the ingenious presentation and atmosphere.  The cinematography and editing on this film are breathtaking.  Hardware should be studied by film students everywhere to learn how original execution and creativity can be melded with a major studio release to create something extraordinary.
I've said it before and I'll say it again...those who don't like it simply don't understand it.  It also helps to have an appreciation of industrial music as there's nothing quite like seeing GWAR perform as you hear Ministry's Stigmata.",1050278400,3,1024,4.8342857142857145

I will admit that it can be a bit off putting to the untrained eye, but if you take the time, you will see that this is one of the most impressive, symbolism laden films ever made.  Keep some very basic themes in mind, and you'll start to see beyond the great acting and stellar cinematography.  The eyes are the windows to the soul.  Water purifies and cleanses.  On the surface, this film is about a robot that goes crazy in an apartment in the future and kills some people.  Underneath, it's about the violation and destruction of one of the last bastions of hope and beauty in a messed up world. If you an answer some of these questions, you'll start to see the grander picture: Who covers their eyes when they fight the MARK 13.  Compare this to who lives, and who dies.  Who is the drifter (hint: he used to be an angel)?  What two events happen in the shower, under a deluge of water, and why?  Where is the drill on the MARK 13 located, and why is the last shot of Jill attacking it a removal of this drill?  The first 4 letters of the MARK 13's serial number are BAAL.  Why?  Who or what is BAAL?  Did you notice that the MARK 13 runs around killing people with an American flag on it's head, with a drug that smells like apple pie?  Who is Jill quoting when she refers to the MARK 13 as being ""our final solution.""
As you can see, there is far more to this film than meets the eye.  If you'll give it a chance, and watch more than 20 minutes of it (see below), you'll see what an incredible work of art this movie is.  And now, we'll have it in beautiful DVD format!",1045526400,29,1715,4.086826347305389

411555,4,6302000815,"Hardware is a small, atmospheric and moody science fiction film set in a post-apocalyptic future where everything seems...orange.
It opens appropriately with Carl McCoy of gothic music greats Fields of the Nephilim scavenging in the Outer Zone for junk he can sell back in the city. His eerie appearance and presence set the forbidding tone early on. Dylan McDermott, playing Moses, a soldier back from wherever, scours the junk shops looking for a Christmas gift for his girlfriend. She builds sculptures out of disgarded cyber-junk in her high-tech, super-secure apartment that she never ventures out of.
Moses buys what looks like a Terminator head from the dealer that McCoy sells to (before McCoy makes just as eerie an exit) and figures it's a perfect gift for one of her eclectic pieces.
Little does anyone know (or rather, they know too late) that the junk Moses bought is in fact part of a sophisticated M.A.R.K. 13 droid, a ""population control"" (re: killing machine) bot. After spraypainting the head like an American flag and mounting it on the wall fixture, the couple get down to sex and now-legalized drug use before Moses wanders back out. M.A.R.K. 13 begins to rebuild itself using the junk in the apartment, powering his new limbs and creeping around hunting for fresh targets.
The film has a very deliberate pace that is not quick--this is not a slam-bang action film by any mean. Its main strengths are the themes and the production design and the overall tone. Photographed wonderfully--a thick orange brown haze covering everything in a radiation screen, Hardware succeeds in being a tough statement about technology (once again) biting the builder's hands.
Apparently this film had to be cut by around half a minute for gore, though I'm not sure if this is cut in the VHS version. The film isn't too bloody really, and we also never get a really good look at the whole M.A.R.K. 13 droid (though he is just rebuilt from junk.) Given the lesser budget and resources Hardware succeeds in not falling into any kind of standard Hollywood formula. Technology is not friendly or cute here, and the outside of Jill's apartment is completely uninviting, thus her hermit-like artist's existence.
High on style, lower on substance, this is highly recommended for Blade Runner fans and those who like thier sci-fi tough. It also has a highly recommeded Simon Boswell score.

With him he brings pieces of a derilect droid that was found  somewhere in ""the zone"" as parts for his girlfriend's sculptures.  However the droid is far from derilect and begins to run amok in the  apartment.
For those who might have missed it, the plot is not in the  foreground.  Watch the subtle hints and who dies when, and this movie  reveals itself to be a masterpiece of the low budget.
The special effects  are good when you consider what they had to work with, and the  cinematography is conveys the proper feeling.  If you can pick up on subtle  body language and actions, then the acting is stupendous.  If you have  trouble with this sort of thing you will find the acting passable.  McDermott is excellent as the classic tough boyfriend without a clue.  Travis is great as the arcwelding, apathetic artist girlfriend who just  really doesn't care anymore.  Lynch excells as the quick talking yet shy  psychedelic using buddy.  The plot is complex but hides behind the  senselessness of the film.
The only problems with the film is the fact  that the violence often overshaows the relationships, but that is  intentional.  Nothing is supposed to make sense until you examine it  closer.  This makes subsequent viewings necessary to really understand the  film.  While this may appeal to some, it usually does not do for a mass  audience.
