8724624,5,B00AI5RXJ8,"I really enjoyed this novel. I knew nothing about oil fields or Libya really, and I enjoyed learning of the culture and enjoyed the
characters and the plot.  I wanted to read more about the characters.  That seldom happens for me.  I ususally finish a book, and I'm on to the next one, but this book has lingered with me, mainly because I liked the characters so much, and I was not ready to let them go!  Write a sequel...  I'd love to read it. ...........................  Mz. Jay",1363824000,,482,4.420454545454546
