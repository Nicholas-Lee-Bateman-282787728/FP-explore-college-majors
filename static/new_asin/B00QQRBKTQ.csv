6877390,4,B00QQRBKTQ,fun fun and a lot of hard work,1423353600,,30,2.875
6877391,5,B00QQRBKTQ,"I really like both of these workout, the first hiit workout seemed harder to me them the second one, I have to admit the second did get my heart rate up but it wasn't as consistent, there seemed to be easier exercises in this one. If you are used to doing Cathe's other workouts, you could always do both hiit one and hiit two back to back to make it more intense, if that is what you are looking for.",1421366400,2,401,4.025
6877392,5,B00QQRBKTQ,"I love the workout. I bought mine on ebay. I rented it first. This is faster then I can go, but I'll get there. Usually can't go wrong with cathe, love her.",1499817600,,156,3.90625
6877393,3,B00QQRBKTQ,while it says low impact the steps are done quickly which is a problem for me.,1499212800,,78,3.9375
6877394,4,B00QQRBKTQ,Good workout. No jumps but lots of squats and lunges. I could really feel it the next day,1497830400,,89,4.0
6877395,4,B00QQRBKTQ,I love Cathe and er workout stile..although this is repetitive .. it is nice though..,1496102400,,85,4.733333333333333
6877396,5,B00QQRBKTQ,great workout video for low impact.  you still get your sweat on.,1493683200,3,65,4.416666666666667
6877397,5,B00QQRBKTQ,This is perfect for days when I just want to do a little of everything.,1489968000,5,71,3.8
6877398,5,B00QQRBKTQ,This work out kicks my rear and I love it!!!,1489017600,,44,3.5
6877399,5,B00QQRBKTQ,Great workout!!!  Really works up a sweat!!,1488499200,,43,5.142857142857143
6877400,4,B00QQRBKTQ,"I ordered two Cathe Friedrich DVDs at the same time, this and Cardio Supersets.  Both are supposed to be low-impact cardio.  This one is much better than Cardio Supersets, though I still have to be careful with some of the movements since I have arthritis in my knees and sudden moves can be painful.",1487894400,10,300,4.537037037037037
6877401,2,B00QQRBKTQ,I was so excited to find a low impact DVD because I have bad knees. I could not do the first workout. The workout is full of squats and lunges.,1487289600,4,143,3.8
6877402,5,B00QQRBKTQ,"Both workouts are excellent low impact high intensity cardio and lower body workouts that are about 30 minutes long.  If you do the moves correctly, one foot is on the floor at all times.  These are definitely not for beginners.  I have been working out for some time and cannot always keep up with the speed of some of the moves.  Little modifications for the moves other than slowing down.  I think workout one is a harder workout than two.  There are also 2 bonus ab workouts of about 8-10 minutes.  One uses weights.  There are 7 premixes if you want a longer or different workout.",1486944000,2,585,4.452830188679245
6877403,5,B00QQRBKTQ,Love this workout!  It is challenging. I swear a lot and my muscles are fatigued when I'm done. I especially like it because it's so easy to follow.,1483920000,5,148,4.285714285714286
6877404,5,B00QQRBKTQ,One of the most effective workouts I've ever done. Very effective!,1478649600,,66,5.090909090909091
6877405,5,B00QQRBKTQ,This is a good exercise routine.  It gets my heart rate up but is easy on the knees and other joints.,1477526400,,101,3.8095238095238093
6877406,5,B00QQRBKTQ,Great workout!,1475539200,,14,6.5
6877407,4,B00QQRBKTQ,Great workouts.  The only thing I don't like is most of the music.  And that the workouts don't go with the rhythm of the music.,1475366400,,128,4.08
6877408,5,B00QQRBKTQ,Great workout without the pain in the knees from other HITT program. I do not feel a difference in the level of intensity from the high impact HITT.,1474329600,,148,4.321428571428571
6877409,3,B00QQRBKTQ,Not one of my favorites.  It's just okay.  I have quite a large exercise DVD collection and I don't find myself grabbing this DVD very often.,1471737600,,141,4.384615384615385
6877410,5,B00QQRBKTQ,I got a great work out with this video!,1470009600,,39,3.4444444444444446
6877411,5,B00QQRBKTQ,"I have over 20 other Cathe workouts, and have been a devotee of hers since the '90s. This DVD is my absolute favorite so far.

1. Fast! I love a quick workout a couple of times a week, or when I don't have time for her longer workouts. Both of the workouts on this DVD fly by for me. I finish up at about the time that I'm saying to myself, ""Please, let me rest!""
2. Intense. It may be low impact, but this DVD is NOT low intensity. I'm gasping for breath during the bursts, and dripping with sweat by the third exercise. This DVD is a perfect balance of fast and intense. For comparison, I find this harder than X10, Intensity, and Crossfire, and MUCH harder than Low Impact Circuit and Circuit Blast.
3. Not boring! Other Cathe workouts have too much repetition (I'm looking at you, X10), so I'm dreading, say, the burpees or the side kicks every time. I never have a chance to feel bored with these workouts, and if I don't like something it's over before I have a chance to hate it.
4. Really works the legs. There's plenty of explosive movement for the legs, so I definitely feel it in my legs the next day. Since I hate regular leg workouts, I feel like I'm still getting some strength benefits with this one.

If you have knee issues, this is probably not the best workout, though. There's a lot of squatting, lunging, and lateral movement at a VERY fast pace, so there's plenty of opportunity to tweak knees if you're prone to that.

One note if you're new to Cathe:  This is an ADVANCED workout. There's very little modification to make things easier, unless you simply do the moves more slowly. If you're new to Cathe, it might be better to start with her ICE series or one of the others I mentioned instead of this one.

I'm going to keep this one in my rotation at least once a week, probably twice, alternating with upper body and longer endurance workouts. Highly recommended for anyone wanting to take their workouts to the next (intense!!) level. I'm going to be adding all the other Cathe HiiT workouts to my library.",1468281600,15,2034,4.384615384615385
6877412,5,B00QQRBKTQ,recovering from a serious leg injury...this was the motivation I needed! Even though I cannot do everything...I can modify and get a GREAT workout!!,1467504000,10,148,5.208333333333333
6877413,5,B00QQRBKTQ,"It's too bad there isn't some standard way to describe to consumers who this workout would be appropriate for. The words ""low impact"" might lead some to think this is a less stressful workout, but it's all relative to what kind of shape you're in, your own physical issues, and perhaps your age.

I'm 48, am in fairly decent shape (use a treadmill, rowing machine, and walk around a LOT), but this workout kicked my butt across the room the very first day. I tried to modify it a bit so I wouldn't unduly strain myself, but here I am 24 hours later with ridiculously sore muscles. If you haven't otherwise been doing squats, be careful! That said, I'm very happy with it; I know I will be able to lose some perimenopause pounds with this method of exercise. The music isn't terribly annoying, Cathe is pleasant enough to watch and not too difficult to follow.

I didn't use a mat, and swapped out some plastic cups for dixie cups, and did fine. I haven't tried the second workout yet.",1466726400,9,984,4.461111111111111
6877414,5,B00QQRBKTQ,"I really love this workout. As the title suggests you get 2 different workout included but in addition, you can combine portions of both workouts to create additional workout options. For example, the last half of each workout is more challenging. You can combine chapters from each challenging portion to get a bonus burn. There are 2 bonus ab workouts included. The workouts are intermediate but I was still challenged. They go by quickly andI feel great afterwards. You can choose a voice only option so you can play your own music but still hear the cues. They sequencing is fun and easy to follow.
I was using Insanity and T25 DVDs from beach body. I was craving a less high impact option but I also wanted to feel like I was getting a good workout. This DVD is saving my low back! I ordered a few more of Cathe's low impact DVDs because I love this one so much. I highly recommend.",1466035200,6,887,4.447852760736196
6877415,5,B00QQRBKTQ,"I like it.  1st time for me to try Cathy's DVD.  Who says it is ""low"" impact?  It is tough for me.  She is very pleasant.  Somehow when you pop this DVD in, music is very loud so caution.  Overall, I love it.",1465344000,,208,3.7209302325581395
6877416,4,B00QQRBKTQ,I just got this dvd workout from Cathe Friedrich. I  know the kind of workouts she puts together and I used to do a lot of her step workouts. This is a great workout. Very HIIT but without a lot of impact. I was really sweating at the end of this workout because of  the kind or moves she put together. WOW. I am going to have to work into this DVD slowly as I build my knowledge and endurance to be able to do these two workouts! This is a real deal workout from one of the best athletic trainers around!,1463788800,2,505,3.9411764705882355
6877417,5,B00QQRBKTQ,DVD arrived faster than expected.  Very good workout.,1463529600,,53,5.625
6877418,5,B00QQRBKTQ,"Heart pumping and not too long! Cathe keeps you busy with sports-like drills and reasonable rest time. Great lower body and ab work, not to mention cardio!",1462924800,,155,4.777777777777778
6877419,5,B00QQRBKTQ,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this workout dvd! I haven't done workout 1 yet because I've been enjoying workout 2! I have to stop every now and then but I'm sure over time, I'll be able to complete the video without stopping! (10 mins later and I'm still dripping sweat!!!!)",1462320000,2,261,4.346938775510204
6877420,5,B00QQRBKTQ,Great workout and keeps your attention.  Go a bit slower if you are not up to speed yet at this level and all is good. Easy to follow and time flies!,1459123200,2,149,3.806451612903226
6877421,4,B00QQRBKTQ,"I just started doing Cathe's new ICE series and decided to try a few of her more advanced workouts.  I'm not a huge fan of HIIT but know how effective it can be - this one was no joke but I'll be returning to it since Cathe is so pleasant (i.e. not a drill sergeant).  The first routine was really tough for me as I'm more of an intermediate exerciser and am used to having recovery phases that last for a minute or two.  Not so on this DVD!  My heart rate never came down from a highly elevated level and I was sweating buckets; I had to hit pause quite a few times.  Despite this I enjoyed the moves and while I'll be modifying it's do-able for those of us who aren't total athletes.  I liked the second routine a bit better because it incorporated 8 and 10 pound weights.  The cardio effect was still high but you work your muscles as well as your heart.  It was also very wrist-intensive since the set includes both mountain climbers and burpees - my wrists were quite sore the next day.  There are two bonus abs segments and although I didn't try the second I loved the first.  You do standing abs using an eight pound weight (think twists with high knees, side chops) then hit the mat for more weighted ab work.  It's not too hard on the back, which is a problem for me at times.  All in all this workout was intense and is definitely NOT for beginners but if you want a challenge with a friendly instructor this is it!",1457654400,4,1425,4.17948717948718
6877422,4,B00QQRBKTQ,"There are two great 30 minute HIIT workouts on this one, along with two separate ab workouts.  I've done them all, and have to say I've gotten a good workout both times.  The second HIIT workout does use hand weights of 10 and 8 lbs.  These are good for when your time may be limited, but you still want to get a good effective workout in.  I wouldn't say they are particularly low impact, but you can modify the moves yourself to make them lower impact.  Your heart rate will definitely be up there for 20 to 25 minutes.  The ab workouts are also very effective.  One is 10 minutes long, and the other is 12 minutes long.  The 12 minute long ab workout was definitely more intense, and I had to modify some of the moves for myself.  I would say this workout is for a advanced beginner to intermediate exerciser.  Would recommend!",1456185600,5,830,4.3311688311688314
6877423,4,B00QQRBKTQ,"This Hiit DVD is a great 30 minute Cardio workout. My schedule is crazy and I'm not in great shape and this DVD makes me sweat,  get my heart rate up and is easy on my knees. Definitely would recommend.",1456185600,2,202,4.05
6877424,3,B00QQRBKTQ,Not begginer friendly which is what I was hoping for but for the person already in shape it is a good instructional video.,1455840000,6,122,4.3478260869565215
6877425,5,B00QQRBKTQ,"This provides a great low impact, high intensity workout that is highly effective in a short amount of time.  I love Cathe's energy and look forward to doing this workout!",1454544000,,171,4.7
6877426,5,B00QQRBKTQ,I purchased this video for my step-mom for Christmas. She has a bad knee and loves this workout video. So happy it was easy to purchase on Amazon.,1454198400,2,146,4.25
6877427,5,B00QQRBKTQ,"LOVE this DVD!  It's a great workout and as you get in better shape you can keep using it and get better at it.  It also has pre-mixes if you want to mix it up and bonus abs workouts to add on.  I have knee issues as some of the other reviewers, but this is one workout I have been able to use that helps my knees because it strengthens the quads and gives you a great cardio workout.  DEFINITELY worth the money.",1452902400,3,413,3.9397590361445785
6877428,5,B00QQRBKTQ,"Low impact but advanced and heart-pounding.  I have acquired less and less tolerance to high impact workouts due to age and osteoarthritis.  There are not too many HiiT, low impact workouts on the market and this DVD is a great one.  There are two separate workouts on this DVD.  Both workouts begin with a warm up and end with a cool down and stretch.  I have performing some of the moves which are shoulder dependent due to ongoing impingement issues/surgery, so I just modify the moves.  Cathe's cuing is good and the background music is not annoying.  I highly recommend this DVD for anyone who is interested in a good workout, regardless of impact level.",1449273600,3,659,4.678260869565217
6877429,5,B00QQRBKTQ,This is a really good low-impact DVD.  I am over sixty years old and can do most of these exercises.,1447718400,16,100,4.0
6877430,1,B00QQRBKTQ,"This is not low impact. There is plenty jumping and stress to the knees. I bought this because I wanted an intense workout that does not stress my joints. I can't do this.  Well, I probably can, however I know if I did I'd be in major pain and have to schedule knee replacement surgery.

Seriously, if you have joint issues, pass on this one.",1447027200,26,342,4.246153846153846
6877431,4,B00QQRBKTQ,Still a great aerobic exercise and great for anyone with feet problems (no hard impacts like jumping).,1445385600,4,102,5.0588235294117645
6877432,4,B00QQRBKTQ,Good workout,1442880000,,12,5.5
6877433,5,B00QQRBKTQ,This is truly a great workout!!  There are even two bonus ab workouts.,1442880000,3,70,4.384615384615385
6877434,2,B00QQRBKTQ,"I really would like to know what is ""low impact"" about jump squats and burpees? Good workout, but not very low impact.",1441497600,22,118,4.409090909090909
6877435,2,B00QQRBKTQ,Seems like very old video.,1440892800,,26,4.4
6877436,5,B00QQRBKTQ,Tough workouts that go by quickly.,1438214400,,34,4.833333333333333
6877437,3,B00QQRBKTQ,I don't mind at all female instructors (most of workout dvds are w/ female instructors) but I think this workout is geared a bit towards women or guys who like a dance/choreographical type work out  - - I still use it but I guess I was looking more for a Jillian Michales/Bob Harper kinda work out,1438128000,3,297,4.303571428571429
6877438,4,B00QQRBKTQ,"Very energetic workout, for low impact.  Low impact doesn't mean easy with this disc.",1438128000,2,85,5.071428571428571
6877439,5,B00QQRBKTQ,I'm not usually into workout videos but I've taken a H.I.I.T class and wanted to give it a try at home. I really like the video and how you can actually skip individual exercises during the session. Hitting the skip button on the remote just moves you to the next exercise in the same session without having to hold fast forward. I have a small apartment so sometimes I like to skip the traveling moves. I also love the bonus abs. I do those regularly and sometimes pause the video during to do more reps. Little equipment required and I like how you can just change the weight of your dumbbells to increase the workout when you're ready. I started with 5 lbs. Overall happy with the video for the money. Like I said I don't usually do home workout videos so not much to compare it to.,1436918400,6,785,4.3108108108108105
6877440,5,B00QQRBKTQ,"I actually really like these two workouts. I have been using them for about a month and alternate them with walking outside or doing the elliptical. They are definitely low impact which I love, but they are also high intensity. I like the fact that Cathe doesn't waste any time between sets. That also means you don't get much explanation before the next exercise begins, and no demonstration, but it is easy to pick each exercise up and once you have done the workout, you know what comes next. I wish Cathe would continue with more and more of these mow impact but high intensity workouts. The 30 minutes for workout is excellent!",1435190400,11,632,4.601769911504425

6877442,5,B00QQRBKTQ,Great workout which can be adjusted to fit your age and fitness level. I loved Part II. Left out some of the floor work and used lighter weights. Will work up to higher ones. Like having two workouts on one DVD.,1432425600,2,211,4.170731707317073
6877443,5,B00QQRBKTQ,Awesome workout! Fun & intense!,1431561600,,31,5.4
6877444,5,B00QQRBKTQ,"These two workouts are amazing!  They are both half hour.  One is strictly cardio while the other uses one hand weight while doing cardio.  Low impact but high intensity that really gets your heart pumping.  The moves are relatively easy to follow.  The only downside is that she doesn't have a modifier but I found ways to modify for myself.  The DVD that uses a hand weight, she uses an eight and ten pound dumbbell.  I just used a lighter one or you don't have to use one at all if preferred.  The workout without the dumbbell I think is actually more challenging.  I highly recommend this workout.  I am ordering more of her DVD's.",1430438400,15,635,4.443478260869565
6877445,5,B00QQRBKTQ,"Great low impact workout.  I have been doing Cathe's workouts for quite some time now and she always keeps it fresh.  I am never bored with anything she puts out.  This was more challenging that I anticipated.  I enjoyed the new moves and the single weight usage. There is no jumping, but there's a lot of sweating!!  Highly recommend!!",1429660800,4,336,4.627118644067797
6877446,5,B00QQRBKTQ,"I can't believe I bought into the hype and wasted money on the T25 set when the short workouts on this DVD pack a great punch! I am a workout DVD fanatic and have quite an extensive collection-this is among my top 10 !It is low impact but boy am I sweaty after! Although the workouts are 30 minutes,I really feel worked,yet unlike T25,she doesn't have you moving at a Psycho pace,risking injury. I never was a Cathe fan due to the long length of her earlier dvd's and all the ecquipment needed. I have a very small workout space and just don't have room for a gazillion gadgets! I have really enjoyed some of her recent dvd's though and have ordered a bunch of her latest dvd's. While this one offers an intense workout,it doesn't have any dread factor for me and I enjoy doing it for my evening workout,as it's not long but makes me feel proud that I did something. This is 1 of 5 workout dvd's that I received for my 48th Birthday and it's the only 1 I use on a regular basis",1428710400,138,977,4.202127659574468
6877447,5,B00QQRBKTQ,"Well, that's what I used to think that if it was low impact, it wasn't hard and it wasn't worth doing.  Well, I have since changed my tune.  With these two workouts, my heart is really pumping.  This disc also contains two ab workouts, which can be done separately or as part of a premix.

LOW IMPACT HIIT ONE (28:05)

Equipment needed:  Mat and Dixie cups.  The mat is just used as a marker for some of the exercises.
Workout crew:  Amanda, Brenda, Jai and Kate (a new crew member).
Outfits:  Tops are grey with orange accents, black and purple with black bottoms.
Premixes range from 26 to 50 minutes.

Why I enjoyed this workout:

* The minimal equipment used.  Cathe is famous, or should I say infamous for using a lot of equipment.  It can be a little distracting trying to get the right set of dumbbells or step or band.  This workout just uses mat for a marker and Dixie cups.

* The high intensity.  My heart was really pumping during most of the exercises.  And my joints were happy because there was no impact.

Some of the exercises in this workout include:

Puddle jumpers
Jump shot
Dixie cup shuffle
Gallop jacks
Football drills
Volley ball lean shots
Surfer squat leaning thrusts.

As you can tell by the names, some of the exercises are new to this series so it's fun.

LOW IMPACT HIIT TWO (29:35)

Equipment needed:  8 and 10 pound dumbbells
Workout crew:  Amanda, Brenda, Jai and Kate
Outfits: Fuchsia, blue and black tops with black bottoms
Premixes range from 27 to 51 minutes.

The basis of this workout is low impact cardio drills alternating with weighted metabolic exercises.  You do each exercise two times through, alternating starting sides.

I have fallen in love with metabolic training.  First because it's fun and second because it works to help me lose weight and get toned.

There is a nice mix of familiar and new exercises in this workout.

Some of the exercises in this workout include:

Apple pickers
Knee up squats - 1 8 pound dumbbell

Mountain climbers
Down up down leg abductor - 1 10 pound dumbbell

Explosive lunges - 1 10 pound dumbbell
Pivot squat sumos - 1 10 pound dumbbell

Squat right kick and squat left lunge - 1 8 pound dumbbell
Side lunge wood chop - 1 8 pound dumbbell
Repeat other side leading.

Front corner to back corner diagonal lunges - 1 8 pound dumbbell
Slide and glide with arms making little circles - 1 8 pound dumbbell

Burpee with no weights
Marching sumo squats - 1 10 pound dumbbell

Rope climbers with elbow strike - no weight
Crossover kicks in plank

Windmills.

BONUS ABS ONE (10 minutes)

Equipment needed: a mat and an 8 pound dumbbell
Outfits:  Turquoise and purple tops
Workout crew:  Amanda, Brenda, Jai and Kate.

Exercises in this workout include:

Standing twisting side ab crunch
Standing twisting agitator abs
Lean back crunch
Full sit up with twist to either side
Plank jack.

BONUS ABS TWO (12 minutes)

Equipment needed:  just a mat!
Outfits: Turquoise and fuchsia tops
Exercises in this workout include:

Full sit up ankle grabbers - my concern with this one is that with a full sit up at such a fast speed, it's all too easy for momentum to take over.
Side crunch
Bike with one leg extended
Banana holds.

All in all, I love these workouts!  If you're looking for a fun way to get in shape without stressing your joints, you may just enjoy these.",1427414400,50,3333,4.547297297297297
6877448,5,B00QQRBKTQ,I was looking for a low impact workout but one that REALLY made me feel like I had worked out. This is it.,1426291200,2,106,3.652173913043478
6877449,5,B00QQRBKTQ,I have many of Cathe's exercise DVD's and the Low Impact gives me a change up from the intensity and heavy impact of jogging. I do like the second workout better than the first but love the first sections ab workout. The fact that you can change up the program helps a great deal with not over using parts of the body so you get a more rounded workout.,1425513600,8,352,4.115942028985507
6877450,5,B00QQRBKTQ,Great low impact workout. She cues well and works you hard. I like that there are pre-mixed options to change up routines so you don't get bored.  If you're looking for high intensity low impact buy this. You won't be disappointed.,1424995200,2,231,4.634146341463414
6877451,5,B00QQRBKTQ,Wow. I have a hamstring injury but am stir crazy. I bought this feeling a little lame from the title. I only did first workout so far but love it. It's no joke. Heart rate was as high as a 30 minute joint busting plyo session. You could make it as easy or hard as you want.,1424304000,36,273,3.807017543859649
8692286,3,B00QQRBKTQ,"Yes, this is a low impact HIIT workout but I would NOT suggest this video for anyone 50+ pounds overweight to obese as some moves are extremely difficult to complete at the pace shown, and there is no modifier.  If you are an obese person looking for a low impact HIIT DVD, look elsewhere.",1526601600,,289,4.351851851851852
8692287,5,B00QQRBKTQ,"Favorite Cathe Cardio Workout.  I love HiIT workouts, but I need low to medium impact now versus videos like IMAX3.  This is an awesome high intermediate to advanced Cardio workout.  I particularly like the fast paced sport sprints in the first section (which mixes well with Ripped HiiT legs).  I really appreciate Cathe's efforts producing advanced lower impact workouts.  The workout is fine on my knees, but the fast moves may be a little hard on the feet for some folks.",1525564800,,475,4.814814814814815

8692289,5,B00QQRBKTQ,"I love these Cathe Friedrich low impact HIIT workouts!  I was looking for a new workout as I had been doing the same thing for way too long.  My daughter suggested I try HIIT.  I came across these workouts and decided to give them a try. They are fantastic!  I have never sweat so much during a workout even though they are low impact!  Yes, they are low impact, meaning you have one foot on the ground at all times, but the movement is non-stop for the most part. I saw results almost immediately (of course I am watching my diet too) and they have inspired me to continue to work to reach my goals. There is no dancing or intricate moves, just tough, high intensity (hence the name!) exercises. A bonus is the background music which I also love!  I am 58 and for the first time in a long time I look forward to my workouts!",1516060800,4,825,4.189873417721519
8692290,5,B00QQRBKTQ,Holy Crap!! What an amazing workout!  Or actually two amazing 30 minute workouts!  The ab  tracks are really good too. I gave it 5 stars because I loved it --you work really hard and yet its still easy to follow.  BUT I really don't think cathe understands what low impact means. I have problem knees but I was able to easily modify most moves so that this workout really worked for me.  !,1515628800,,389,4.273972602739726

8692294,1,B00QQRBKTQ,"This video is not low impact! There is no jumping up and down,however there is fast jerky movements . These type of movements are hard on the joints. This defeats the purpose of claiming the workout is low impact.",1502409600,3,213,4.487179487179487
