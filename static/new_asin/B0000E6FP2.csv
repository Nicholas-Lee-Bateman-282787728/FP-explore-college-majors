8002050,4,B0000E6FP2,"What can I say, it's a low budget teen movie with lots of skin and bad acting. A (very) loose take on Fast Times with a lot less clothing. Still, it's a fun little flick and good for a viewing if you like dated teen flicks.",1438300800,2,223,3.869565217391304
8002051,5,B0000E6FP2,"Is the movie terrible? Yes. Should you buy it? Well, if you were a teenage boy in 1989 and fell madly in love the first time you saw Kim Anderson in the video for ""Girlschool"" by Britny Fox, then you probably already know that owning this movie is a must! The film is corny as hell, but it's a bit fun too in a ""bad movie night"" kind of way. Not recommended for one who takes themselves too serious. Definitely recommended for someone who looks back fondly on late eighties low budget schlock films. Compared to other films of the day, the styles, hair, look and overall feel of ""Hot Times at Montclair High"" are a slightly less polished(but perhaps a bit more honest)time capsule from 1989.

Did I mention that Kim Anderson is in it? Gorgeous.

8002052,1,B0000E6FP2,A terribly ridiculous movie that was still entertaining for portions that were not as contrived as the rest of it. The only reason I bought it was because a friend of mine was in it. No wonder she never talked about it even though it was the only movie she was ever in.,1186185600,6,269,4.09433962264151
