2835180,2,B000QCTFXU,"I was excited when I read about this DVD since I like the ""beach music"" and am always looking for new ""chair"" exercise DVD's.  Although it's better than the ""Chair Boxing"" DVD (produced by the same company) it's not much of a workout for those who consider themselves to be in the beginner/intermediate stages of exercise.

The audio is ""OK"", but it looks as though it has been filmed in the person's basement or patio.

Not recommended.  :(",1266624000,4,441,4.615384615384615
2835181,5,B000QCTFXU,"I actually bought this one a few months ago, and I am still using it. In fact, I lost six pounds the first month. I bought the DVD for my mother and she does it while watching the Nightly News. I highly recommend this entire series to anyone - young or old.",1245110400,7,257,3.9615384615384617
2835182,2,B000QCTFXU,Not worth the money. The exercise routines are boring and I didn't feel I had any real workout.,1242345600,2,95,4.333333333333333
2835183,2,B000QCTFXU,This is too fast paced for the elderly. It was too much for me and was not what I was expecting. I will never use the one I bought so it was a waste of my money,1239321600,,160,3.3513513513513513

8195525,5,B000QCTFXU,I love this!!! combined with chair salsa its perfect for me after i just got out of hospital for hip and knee repair,1458345600,,116,4.086956521739131
8195526,5,B000QCTFXU,"I have worked with this video a couple times, and found it helpful, I need to get back to working with it if I am going to benefit from it.  I am still having difficulty keeping up at times.",1454630400,,190,3.871794871794872
8195527,4,B000QCTFXU,"This workout is not as energetic as others in this series, but by no means is it wimpy. You get out what you put in and slow stretches with resistance can be very beneficial. I gain more muscle strength and stamina from this routine and I gain more cardio endurance from other videos, like the Salsa one, so I recommend using a combo (I alternate days). Since I have this digital, I can't make selections like I did on DVD, so that's th 4 stars instead of 5 : )",1429660800,,461,4.133333333333334
8195528,1,B000QCTFXU,I bought this after a foot injury when I couldn't do my normal workout routine and I found it too silly&cheesy-I could not bring myself to use it again. I loved Chair Boxing and Chair Aerobics-this was just too corny-I found myself  embarrassed to use it even though there was no one else home except my dogs!,1428710400,,309,4.421052631578948
8195529,5,B000QCTFXU,"I suffer from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and this video is perfect for me on days my energy is extremely low, which is most of the time.  For those who gave this video a low rating because it was too easy, it will probably not be challenging for most people.  Yet, this video does contain light toning and stretching for all major muscle groups.",1424131200,,343,4.428571428571429
8195530,2,B000QCTFXU,Very mild workout.  Plenty of stretching.,1411430400,,41,5.833333333333333
8195531,3,B000QCTFXU,"I have several DVDs from the Chair Aerobics for Everyone series.  I am 27 years old and have JRA. I get these DVDs to help lose weight and stay active because I can't do too much physically.  I was disappointed however in this one.  It seems ""Too easy"" for my liking.  It was very slow paced and I just didn't like that.",1397692800,,320,4.112903225806452
8195532,3,B000QCTFXU,"Nice workout, good music, great background and good instructor.  I can't say anything negative about this DVD because I think everything was done well.  I enjoyed doing the full and quick workout but for me there's nothing left.  I feel like I've out grown this DVD.  I recommend the DVD to those with limited mobility.  I'm only giving it a 3 because I don't feel a need or want to do this workout again.",1373760000,,405,4.418918918918919
8195533,5,B000QCTFXU,This DVD is an excellent value for the money.  It provides a comprehensive set of exercises without paying extra for stage-craft.,1356048000,,129,5.142857142857143
