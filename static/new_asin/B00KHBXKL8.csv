8658937,4,B00KHBXKL8,I really did like workout as it was enough to feel worked but not exhausted-next time I'll remember to lighten up on first excercise which is weighted jumping jacks-he said grab heavy weights but jumping while pushing them overhead is injury waiting to happen. Liked that only one excercise was repeated since you had to do a one armed row and raise on opposite side-I hate repeating excercises for 2-3 circuits. Left off one star for the high price and Instructor had a very drab and unmotivating Personality-zero enthusiasm-I'm used to Cathe Friedrich who is always encouraging-this guy only smiled once during workout and acted so breathless at end which was crazy since I'm not a Pro and I wasn't that winded,1512345600,,712,4.844262295081967
8658938,5,B00KHBXKL8,Great workout.  Great for a shorter but intense workout. You can definitely get it for $20 or $30!  Don't pay this much!,1463788800,,120,4.409090909090909
8658939,5,B00KHBXKL8,"Wow. That's really all I can say. This is the workout I've been waiting for. If you just keep in mind it's only 30 minutes, you'll push through it.
I was covered in sweat after. Great instructor, great direction, great everything. You only need two sets of dumbbells, you can buy used at a sporting goods store, and an ab mat.",1443225600,,326,4.360655737704918

8658942,3,B00KHBXKL8,"I really wish there was more detail to the description. This DVD is for ONE workout. The photos and description are slightly deceiving. You literally only get the DVD in the case with a 4 or 5 page booklet outlining the meal plan & grocery list. The picture makes it look like you get multiple items, but in reality the just are showing you the different sides of the one thing you get - front of the case, the back of the case, the inside of the case with the DVD and the food plan booklet. On to the workout itself - There are ONLY 3 things on the DVD. The instructional that shows you how to do each move, the workout with a warm-up and the workout without the warm-up. While the workout definitely kicks your butt, I was disappointed at the fact its just one single routine that you have to repeat with no variety or alternatives. For the $60 pricetag I feel I could have spent the money better on another program that had more variety.",1412726400,10,940,4.256983240223463

8658944,5,B00KHBXKL8,"I had been working out for years and this really took my efforts to a new level. What an all round intensive thirty minutes!!! I highly recommend this product, great for days when there's no time to spend an hour in the gym and the high afterwards is a bonus. Three months after starting the programme it still challenges me whenever I do it.",1406592000,,342,4.359375
8658945,5,B00KHBXKL8,"DVD Case/Nutrition info:
I thought the case was nice and the nutrition info is helpful for those who are not sure what to eat or are beginners. Paired with the website, there are a lot of good suggestions and options.

Instructional Portion:
I felt this was done really well. It explains the moves and is easy to understand even if you are new to this type of exercise. I also like the pacing, and feel it is easy to follow.
Workout:
I loved the workout and it was a great combo of cardio/weight training. I sweat up a storm and am a little sore today in a good way. The pace was great and I enjoyed the warm up/workout/cool down. I like that is just jumps right into it and goes by very fast. The Instructional Video is VERY important because of the pace, but I do like how it gets right to the point. It is also nice that you can do the option without a warm-up. I would never use this option unless I did something before the DVD, but it is good to have .",1403740800,,958,4.095744680851064
