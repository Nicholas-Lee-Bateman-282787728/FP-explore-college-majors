8748343,5,B01ATCA724,"I checked this DVD out at our local library for my 6 year old daughter who is very interested in ocean life. I had to video tape her face at one point because she looked completely involved in it, wide eyes and mouth open. We haven't even had the DVD for a week and she's already watched it at least 4 times. I'm considering buying it now! The book Down, Down, Down by Steve Jenkins is what first interested my daughter in deep sea creatures and bioluminescence.",1494979200,,462,4.32183908045977
