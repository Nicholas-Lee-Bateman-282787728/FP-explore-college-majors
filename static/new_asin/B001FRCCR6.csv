8326444,5,B001FRCCR6,there are always a riff or two even for the old hand in these  excellent DVDs. This one is especially challenging for most humans. Very good value for  money.,1383782400,,158,4.413793103448276

8326446,4,B001FRCCR6,"I was skeptical about this DVD at first.  I rarely ever write reviews, but I was so happy with this product that I had to.  I don't want to over hype the product though.  I've been playing guitar for about 10 years now and if you are an advanced player and want to understand some technique, skills and theory about Lukather this is a great DVD.  I only wish it was longer.  Note: It doesn't feature Lukather himself but Michael Casswell is an excellent teacher.

No tab so don't get this if your a beginner.",1292371200,,508,4.294736842105263
8326447,4,B001FRCCR6,"This dvd by Michael Casswell is just excellent! i would have given it 5 stars but i am saving that for the ultimate guitar dvd. Anyway this dvd is so bang on to Lukathers(hard to emulate) style that you find yourself feeling elated to learn these licks. The instructor takes you through 3 different Toto backing tracks that play in compolation ""Hold the Line"" ""Georgy Peorgy"" and ""Roseanna"" on a backing track and each solo section is deblt with accordingly.
For example the ""Hold the line"" portion of the lesson deals with Lukathers interesting note choices and timing as well as his trademark cascading solo runs that flare up and down the neck in rapid sucession wich i am sure you know what i am talking about...those fast trill's and arppegio's interlaced with pentatonic blues style solo runs. Similar to Joe Satrians style.
And in the funky 6/8 ""Rosanna"" section you learn the proper rythym timing as well as his famous solo sting's that he played in that solo. Spending just the right amount of time on ""Feel""that is so important to a new player.

One other huge benefit to a Michael Casswell teaching dvd is his slow and methodic explaination of where to put your fingers during these lessons and that takes allot of the frustration away from learning these fantastic licks. He also teaches the many different scales that Lukather uses throughout the lesson as well which is invaluble to a new or advanced player and you will quickly find yourself using these new licks in your own solo's.
Can't say enough about this dvd as with most of his teaching dvd's there are so few instructors who actualy get someones style of playing down so perfectly....if you bought his Areosmith dvd on how to play ""Walk This way"" you know what i am talking about..he's the real deal.

Buy this and also if you get a chance the Areosmith DVD learning the Walk this way solo will improve you playing about 100 % in the process.
