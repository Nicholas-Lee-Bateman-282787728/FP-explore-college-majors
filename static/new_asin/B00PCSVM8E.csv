 actor who played the main character; if they were trying to make me despise him, it worked!  I found myself wishing for the death of the main character approximately 10 minutes in and that desire grew exponentially about every 5 minutes.  By the end I was looking to see how much time was left.  There is no catharsis or even clearer understanding at the end of this film; it's almost like they ran out of money while filming.  In addition, the director's repeated cuts to scenes of the main character pining accompanied by the soundtrack from an ASPCA commercial are more akin to tactics taught in psychological operations classes than theater courses. This film is a hot mess with garbage sprinkles...",1497225600,,850,4.909090909090909

8687461,3,B00PCSVM8E,"I really enjoyed this film. It is well acted, claustrophobic and effective. However, (SPOILER OF SORTS) the ending was horrible. It's like the writers simply couldn't figure out how to end it, so they just brought it to an abrupt and inconclusive ending. Obviously they are great fans of CLOVERFIELD because it has many characteristics similar to that film, it's just not as well done. It was shot on an obviously small budget, but for the most part that has no real affect on the film's quality. The ending is what causes it to plummet like a lead weight.",1427932800,4,556,4.626262626262626
8687462,5,B00PCSVM8E,"Didn't know what to expect when this movie first began. It's a bit slow in the beginning but if you can get past the first 10 minutes, you will be drawn in. The name is so appropriate even though you don't realize it until the end. A young man distraught over a broken relationship accuses his best friend of the ultimate betrayal. He is so absorbed in his loss that he even discounts an explosion some where in this unknown city. He sees the huge black plume but doesn't think much of it, his only thought is to get through to his ex girlfriend. He is so self absorbed in his misery that he cannot see what is happening around him until it is too late. He soon finds himself under siege by an unknown enemy with no way out of his apartment. What you hear and don't see is so much more terrifying than anything the producer/director of this movie could have done with CGI or otherwise and a must see movie if you're into the apocalyptic scenarios with human interest thrown into the mix.  I see a great future for director/writer/producer Rob Grant. If he can do this on a low budget sci-fi thriller and would love to see what he can do given a bigger one.",1426809600,2,1156,4.2785388127853885
