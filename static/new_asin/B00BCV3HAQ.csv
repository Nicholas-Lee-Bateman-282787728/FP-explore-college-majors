5579740,5,B00BCV3HAQ,"I really miss getting to see all the ""old"" shows on TV.  She has always been such a delight.  She was even nicer in person.  She genuinely loved people & cooking.  She was also incredibly kind to everyone at her book signing.  She made us all believe in ourselves & our ability to cook.",1416787200,,286,4.222222222222222
5579741,5,B00BCV3HAQ,"I really have no complaint with Julia or the program.  Perfect as always.  However, it seems to me that in 2014, the maker of the DVD could find a sophomore in AV studies in some university and get the occasional sound/picture mismatch fixed, IMHO.",1400112000,2,248,4.613636363636363
5579742,5,B00BCV3HAQ,"Thanks, great movie really enjoy the entertainment of the artist Julie Child's personality and her funny antics, she was quite the lady.",1375056000,,136,5.2272727272727275
5579743,5,B00BCV3HAQ,"Now that more Julia Child DVDs are coming out it is good to know what is on each one, so you don't duplicate.
These are all black and white episodes before the 1970s.
6 shows
STARTERS & SIDES:  (Soupe au Pistou) (Asparagus from Tip to Butt)
ENTREES:  (Cassoulet) (Roast Duck a l'Orange)
DESSERTS: (Cake for Company) (Tarts aux Fruites)

The quality of the shows---picture wise---is about 8 out of 10.  Some flickering and graininess but it is worthwhile to see her in the early stages of her shows.  Enjoy!",1374796800,18,506,4.640449438202247
5579744,5,B00BCV3HAQ,I have all her video's to date.  These are not repeats.  It is very entertaining to watch these early episodes and be able to see how she improved her on screen persona...especially entertaining when she describes an 'exotic' ingredient or piece of equipment that we all have in our kitchens today.,1372982400,7,298,4.823529411764706
