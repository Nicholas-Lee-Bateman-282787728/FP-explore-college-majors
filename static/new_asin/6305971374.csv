7898610,1,6305971374,"I haven't seen Girls on the Road, so I will restrict my comments to Werewolves on Wheels.
Made on an entirely inadequate budget, a bunch of bikers stumble around and cuss on film, antagonize a group of devil worshippers and then are turned into werewolves at the end.
Keep in mind you don't get to see the werewolves until the last few minutes of this picture and that scene is at night so the scene is too dark to understand that the bikers have been turned into werewolves were it not for the title.
I assume most people would rent this hoping to see werewolves ride around on motorcycles for most of the movie and the filmmakers don't deliver the groceries.
The bulk of the movie is nearly plotless and the actors don't seem to have scripted dialogue. Given the cost of 16mm film, I am at a loss to explain why a producer would allow the director, cast and crew to put so little effort into this project and although I admit they were savvy enough to put a little violence and a little bare breast in the movie, it doesn't really compensate for the other 89 minutes of boredom.
Looking at the reviews of other z-grade movies, I can see that some people are interested in movies that are inexcusably bad, and I must admit, that having been made in the 1970's, Werewolves on Wheels has a certain appeal to it that the filmmakers didn't consciously make an exploitation movie like we saw in the 1980's with movies such as Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers, where films were made that seemed to be aiming for cult status.
So in short, if you like bad movies, go ahead and give this one a shot, but I, for one, was not entertained.",1023926400,8,1622,4.41
