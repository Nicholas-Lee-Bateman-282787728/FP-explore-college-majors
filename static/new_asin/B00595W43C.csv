4620270,5,B00595W43C,"I've been a Bette fan since I first saw her 40 years ago
on ""The Mike Douglas Show"" when I was in high school.  You just knew there was something special, something very
different, about this woman.  Four decades later this still holds true.  Yes, she is a household name and yes,
she is now a mainstream performer, but she still stands
head and shoulders above all others as one of the best
live performers of all time.  I've seen every tour she's
done since 1973 and made my first trip to Vegas for this
show.  It was wonderful.  Yes, there are no big surprises, and no it is not the complete show.  I'm bummed out that they omitted ""When A Man Loves A Woman""
which was the showstopper the night that I attended.  But
I am totally fine that they left out the Delores Delago
segment.  It was fun, but we've all seen it many times
before.  It is short for a Midler show, but what's there
is still amazing.  Great stage presence, great vocals,
beautifully staged and full of fun and uplift.  I don't
get the complaints from people saying she's ""lost it"".  She is 65 years old, for God's sake!  She's got more energy than most 45-year old entertainers.  If you like
Bette you will LOVE this extravaganza.",1314921600,13,1202,4.375565610859729
4620271,5,B00595W43C,"Been there. Done it.  Would do it again and again and again.  Saw the show twice (front row second time!).  Flawlessly sassy, upbeat, energetic and emotional.  She's the definition of ""consumate entertainer.""  If you saw the show, this will be a happy reminder.  If you didn't, you saved yourself two hundred bucks plus a ticket to Vegas but you missed one of the greatest shows in modern entertainment.  I think everyone will love this DVD (ahem, unless you really like Sarah Palin -- then you Bette'r not).",1314316800,7,508,4.7701149425287355
4620272,1,B00595W43C,"This badly edited version of the original nearly 2-hour Vegas show originally aired on HBO and was an immediate disappointment to all her fans.  I'm a fan from the beginning, the ""...on the Half Shell"" review and shows, and for this to be her supposed final taped release is a crime.  What happened to HBO and Bette?",1313625600,7,316,4.526315789473684
4620273,2,B00595W43C,"Here's the thing, this show is lacking in any of the usual Bette Midler scintillation and sparkle. I am thinking of Diva Las Vegas, The Bette Midler Show, and Art or Bust as highlights of her finest moments.

She seemed pissed off to have to be on stage throughout most of this show. The most off putting thing of the whole thing is listening to her complain about being tired. If I had flown from Boston to Vegas to see this show and she was complaining about being ""so tired"" after I paid $120 to see her I would be FURIOUS!!! The other issue, why the hell is this so short? with so LITTLE singing?

To give a reference: if you saw the episode of my life on the d-list where Bette was a guest and she seemed to lack any genuine interest in what was going on to a degree which she seemed irritated and bothered, it's kind of like that, but with an audience, and no Stay With Me.",1313193600,5,879,4.1345029239766085
4620274,1,B00595W43C,"I have been a fan since I was a teenager.  When I heard about the Las Vegas show I was really excited and after seeing it on HBO I'm glad I wasn't able to see it there.  Miss Midler seems to have phoned the show in.  I wish she were hungry enough to try something unique again.  This was just a rehashing of old hits and tedious patter.  (Her patter used to be sharp and reflective, now it's whining)  Miss Midler, there are plenty of new hits for you in the universe.  Did Bruce Vilanche help you write this show?  Perhaps he needs a makeover as well.  Bette Midler has always been the one to reinvent the stage.  I hope she does it again.",1312934400,11,640,4.088709677419355
4620275,3,B00595W43C,"I've been a fan of the Devine Miss M for years, purchasing her records (yes, she did record on vinyl) and later her CDs, almost as they were being pulled from the shipping boxes.  Then I got to see her concerts  and TV specials, before I discovered the thrill and true electricity of seeing her perform LIVE!

Her concerts never disappointed.  When it was announced she would be in the area, I didn't care what the title of the show was, I bought tickets and KNEW I was in for a night's entertainment that would last for days after the curtain finally closed.  I even considered a first-time trip to Los Vegas just because she was performing there, but that didn't happen.

When word came that HBO would air her performance I thought here was the chance for me to see what I regretted not making the trip (pilgrimage-?) to see in person.  Based on the show Miss Midler Executive Produced for HBO, I'm glad I didn't waste the money.  What I saw was what I consider more `schlock' I've always associate with Los Vegas.

A quote from one of the teasers for the special has Miss M saying, "". . .there are certain things an audience excepts . . ."" and while she did perform those songs & comedy routines, it was like she walked through them.  Missing was the energy of her prior performances.  This is a DVD that will not join the others from when she truly was ""The Devine Miss M"" - enjoy retirement.",1310774400,4,1396,4.372093023255814
4620276,1,B00595W43C,"I've been a huge Midler fan for decades. I own several of her recordings and have attended her live performances.  I can't express my level of disappointment over this disk.  Much of the singing and choreography were enjoyable, but Ms. Midler was just an ingratiating husk of herself.  Rather than being clever or bawdy or touching or bright, she continually blathered on about how tired she was and what a ""goddess"" and ""diva"" she is. Consequently, she comes off as a second-rate drag queen doing a Bette Midler impersonation.  This show feels like it was all about stroking her own ego and making money.  Even some of the ""off the cuff"" patter she made was taken verbatim from other live performances.  This disk has actually damaged my warm-fuzzy feelings about Bette.",1482969600,2,771,4.847328244274809

The video quality was not the best I must admit, in darker places you could see a bit of ""noise"", problem of not-so-high resolution. The show was severely cut to a mere hour or so, a lot of juicy bits must have been cut out. Personally, I feel the stage is way too big to create a sense of intimacy, in which Midler shines best. For the size of the stage, they had to fill it with lots of dancers. At times, the dancing and action were only so-so. Singing of course, being the forte of Miss presented no problem. However, on the whole, because of all the above mentioned factors, the wow factor just wasn't there anymore. I owned her other DVD concert from a few years back named ""Diva Las Vegas"", that was more complete and powerful, even funnier.

Studio: IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: Pop diva Bette Midler (a.k.a. The Divine Miss M) has enjoyed a long successful career in a wide array of mediums most notably on stage. She has a wonderful stage presence and is liked by many. Her three-year Las Vegas show The Showgirl Must Go On which began in February of 2008 and ended in January of 2010 featured many songs that the performer made popular including From a Distance and Wind Beneath My Wings. Now, The Showgirl Must Go On is out on Blu-ray so fans of Midlers can rejoice and enjoy her show in crystal-clear high definition. Recorded at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, the 67-minute The Showgirl Must Go On is a glitzy and colorful spectacle of Bette Midler-like proportions. From neon pink and gold flashing lights to Rockette-type dancers, this show pretty much has it all. Midler sings, dances and even provides some corny stand-up comedy which the audience seems to eat up almost as much as they did their all-you-can-eat dinner buffets.

The Divine Miss M., who perfected her act belting out tunes and cracking X-rated jokes to the patrons of the famous gay bathhouses in New York [with Barry Manilow on the piano]. But the lady could sing, and when someone finally wised up and put her on vinyl in, her multi-tracked rendition of ""Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy"", with that incomparable voice covering for all three Andrews Sisters, topped the charts. Thirty-six years later, the stage may be bigger and they don't come much bigger than the The Colosseum at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas. The sequins are more plentiful, the backing orchestra is certainly more polished, the accompanying dancers that are the staggering Harletts and an even larger retinue of Caesar Salad Girls are far more co-ordinated, but the essential Bette Midler is unchanged. ""Salty songs and dirty jokes put my daughter through private school!"" she tells the crowd. ""I've been telling these jokes for forty years . . . and you've been laughing at 'em for forty years"" for which the People's Diva gives her sincere thanks.

Bette Midler's show is a canny assembly of popular standards with some minor additions. The selections are interspersed with classic Bette patter and spiced with enough Vegas production pizzazz to cover the costume changes and give the 60-something firecracker a chance to recharge and reload. True to form, Ms. Midler makes her advancing years (and those of her fans) the butt of her own jokes. As is often the case with ""tribute"" or retrospective shows, I suspect one's enjoyment of Showgirl may depend, in part, on familiarity with the originals that are being recreated, because memory overlays the current performance with recollections of the initial one and the emotions it evoked.

Bette Midler still delivers the voice, and Ms. Midler's rendition of ""Wind Beneath My Wings,"" which she saves till the last, demonstrates that Ms. Midler can still bring the heart-felt schmaltz that has kept her fan base broad and loyal all these years. That same emotional appeal, direct, yearning, unadorned, and a lot harder to pull off than it sounds and can be heard in her renditions of ""The Rose"" and ""From a Distance"". It's a Ms. Midler trademark as much as the dirty mouth and the scandalous jokes (not so much these days), and it's the real secret to her longevity and loyalty of her massive fans of this Diva and that is why this Blu-ray shows off her true professional performance, that keeps you entertained throughout the show. The only downside to this Blu-ray is, surely the show was much longer than 67 minutes, as I am sure it must be at least 2 hours long, because if I went to see the show live at only 67 minutes, I would be more than miffed and short changed at a short show, I would of demanded my money back.

`Bette Midler: The Showgirl Must Go On' has one of the most peculiar openings I've ever seen on a concert disc. It opens with some terribly shoddy CGI that looks like the disc menu for a low-rent knock-off. A bedraggled donkey wanders in front of a sign bearing Midler's image, a vulture swoops into the frame and tumbleweeds blow by. Finally, after what seems like an eternity, a tornado sweeps through, picks up all of these poor creatures and whisks them to The Colosseum at Caesar's Palace, where Ms. Midler is ready to kick off her latest show. Well us Brits in the UK knew what was happening at the start of this Blu-ray disc, as it is a send up of The Wizard of Oz and that Ms. Bette Midler has arrived in Las Vegas, it is that simple you Americans out there who do not seem to be very knowledge of comedy send ups and again it is that simple and why do Americans get so confused by such hilarious send ups and is one of the most inventive beginning of a Blu-ray disc and the start of a Las Vegas Show.

Ms. Bette Midlers outsize persona, the Divine thing, serves her well here. Staging a show of this kind on a long strip of stage must be like putting a Broadway show on a subway platform. The strain sometimes shows; even 20 leggy women aren't quite enough to eat up the space, and the choreography by Toni Basil, delightful in the Soph-and-the-showgirls segment, flounders at other points. The set designs, by the opera veteran Michael Levine, are dominated by a series of shimmering curtains of gold coins that pay elegant tribute to the tradition of Las Vegas glitz. But theres no escaping the flattening influence of the giant video screen that looms over the stage and makes the space feel a bit like a supersize IMAX theatre.

That Ms. Bette Midler is capable of instantly warming up a room this daunting and filling a stage this forbidding is a testament to her consummate skills as an entertainer. The temperature dips now and then, but she keeps the antiseptic at bay with regular infusions of the down-and-dirty earthiness that is so central to her appeal. Flinging herself on her back at one point, in mock exhaustion, she crankily observes that her predecessor must have been a robot. Nobody leaving The Showgirl Must Go On will confuse Ms. Bette Midler with a mechanical contraption. She still tears into the soulful ballad When a Man Loves a Woman, to cite just one example, with a fierceness that excavates every ounce of pain from it. Like all great showgirls, she may wear sequins like a second skin, but the woman underneath is all flesh and blood, humour and heart. If you are a diehard Ms. Bette Midler fan, then this is the perfect item to pick up. I have to admit it does contain some fantastic memorable songs and Ms. Bette Midler does have a certain appeal many aspect of all generations and you will be mesmerised by an awesome experience, and you will find Bette Midler: The Showgirl Must Go On Blu-ray is the most perfect purchase and will give you many endless hours of enjoyment and each time you view this Blu-ray disc, you will see something totally different, that you may not have observed the first time round of this amazing and exciting awesome Las Vegas show. The only negative aspect of this Blu-ray is that the programme is only 67 minutes long, whereas it is advertised that its running time is 90 minutes, so why couldn't we have the full extravaganza show, very strange?

Blu-ray Video Quality  Image Entertainment's 1080i encoded Blu-ray has been taken from a high-definition video, with the exception of the opening mini-film projected on a giant screen behind the stage at the start of the show. As one would expect with HD original material, but why is not in a 1080p encoded image quality? The source is very clean, sharp and detailed with almost no video noise, except in an occasional long shot, where the play of light off the numerous sequins seems to trip up the interlacing. Blacks surrounding the performers are solid and deep in close and medium shots, but exhibit minor crushing in longer shots; this is probably unavoidable, given the sensitivity of HD cameras and the multiple reflections in an auditorium the size of the Colosseum, so that the dark is never completely dark. This being a video-sourced Blu-ray, there were none of the issues sometimes encountered in film transfers, such as ringing or high-frequency filtering, nor did I observe any compression errors. By the way www.amazon.com has the Blu-ray disc listed as Region A/1, well it is not, and it is All Regions.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track tends to favours the orchestra, which it delivers with punch and presence. It also immerses you in the crowd's applause and laughter, which wraps around the sides. Comedic patter and Ms. Midler's solos are beautifully rendered, but the 5.1 mix struck me as being slightly reticent with the vocals on some songs, especially when it came to balancing Midler, the orchestra and the chorus. Just for comparison, I replayed a few numbers with the 2.0 LPCM track, which seemed to have better balance. In any case, both soundtracks almost certainly have superior tonality value to, and fewer rough edges than, the live performance, thanks to the efforts of sound engineers.

Finally, during one of the breaks between songs, Midler describes how she invented her infamous alter ego, Soph, through whose shameless lips the performer could tell the trashiest jokes she could think of. Bette Midler was 30 at the time; so she imagined someone much, much older, say, 60! At which point, the People's Diva blanches and turns her head away in shame. Bette Midler may have attained Soph's age, but she's far exceeded her creation. Anyone who's still willing, after all these years, to get out on that massive stage, pour her heart into those songs night after night with such conviction, and even display the comparison with her younger self for all the world to see is a class act of rare conviction, even if she does claim to cruise nursing homes looking for dates. Despite my miffed comment on how long the show is, I am still so pleased to add this to my ever increasing Bette Midler Blu-ray Collection, but I am very sad they will not release the Bette Midler: Diva Las Vegas [PAL DVD], as this is just as awesome and the running time of 125 minutes is what you call a concert and is so totally hilarious and the jokes just as bawdy and will have to in stitches of laughter the whole 125 minutes. Highly Recommended!

The audio was, indeed, bad and what was on the disc was clearly truncated from the actual show.  However, more to the point, although ""The Divine Miss M,"" still has her voice, her ""schtick"" routines seem a bit dated.  In some cases, they actually seem somewhat embarrassing as Bette is no longer a spring chicken.  It also seemed, from the disc anyway, that she somehow did not have the stamina to carry a show this size and length. There was WAY too much filler with production numbers without her.  And when she joined in, she clearly was ""taking it easy"" on the choreography.  It certainly is no crime for our Bette is grow older, but I think this show might have not been the right venue for her.  Because she still has a lovely voice, a smaller cabaret-type act might have worked better.  But, of course, Bette probably wanted to give her fans what they expected.

And the totally outrageous ""Soph"" with all her dirty jokes.  I for one, was not disappointed to see this show.

4620338,3,B00595W43C,"I am a Die-Hard Bette Midler fan. The ""Showgirl Must Go On"" was the first Bette Midler concert that I didn't get to see live in many years. I could not afford to travel from Philadelphia to Las Vegas to see the Divine One. A dark cloud hung over my home. (Okay, I'm being a bit melodramatic.)
I held out hope that Ms. Midler would have the good sense to record this event, and perhaps release it. Thankfully, she did.

**First, The Bad...

""The Showgirl Must Go On"" DVD contains the HBO program in it entirety. But that's not saying much. Delores Delago is mysteriously missing. Her glaring absence is felt. I can't imagine why the mermaid was cut from the HBO production or the DVD. Was there a copyright issue? Was she spawning?

What's more, it's really disappointing that no Bonus Features are included on the DVD. I had hoped they would have at least included the Delores Delago segment as part of the bonus features. Nothing. There are none.

I am disappointed. This DVD feels like it was just slapped together. I could have done better on my PC. At least I would have put more thought into it.
After all the money spent over the years on music, movies, and especially concerts, I fell like I've been ripped off by someone I've come to adore.

**Now The Good...

Were there things on the DVD that I DID like? Sure. I love that Bette's small frame still travels across the stage at 100mph, filling the entire stage. The opening number is great. We haven't seen a live version of ""Big Noise From Winnetka"" since ""Divine Madness"". There are many classics. Bette's version of ""Do You Want To Dance"" is still my favorite. And even though I've heard the Sophie jokes a million times, they're still as funny as ever. (Probably because she tells them better than I do.)

All-in-all, I still adore Bette. But I wonder why she hasn't released the ""Kiss My Brass"" concert on DVD or BluRay. It's probably the most fully packed Bette concert I've seen. (Hint. Hint.)

If you like Bette, you'll like The Showgirl Must Go On. If you love The Divine Miss M, you may be disappointed.",1322438400,2,2072,4.506666666666667

This DVD opens with a wild tornado that lands us in a whirlwind of dancing girls, bright colors, music and Bette.  Most powerful for me was her performance of ""From A Distance,"" one of the serious songs tucked within the show.  Looking great in an orange flowing gown, Bette reaches her hands up almost as if she had a direct line to the Almighty.  Also amazing was her powerful performance of John Prine's ""Hello In There.""  Now in her 60s, Bette seemed to have great empathy for old people who ""grow lonesome.""  Toni Basil, who's one hit ""Mickey"" came in the early 80s, does the choreography.  On ""Do You Wanna Dance,"" it is a breathtaking combination of umbrellas that pop open and close with the lights pink and blue.  When the DVD ended, I wished there were more.

4620350,5,B00595W43C,"I fell in love with Bette Midler when she starred in The Rose, seeing the movie 9 times in the theater in 1979.  With every concert, movie and TV special she always improved at every level, a master of comedic timing.  A Hollywood producer once wrote, ""Let Bette Be Bette"" which is exactly what this incredible production is all about.  Every minute of this show is Bette Midler at her very best, and it should be, Bette produced the show!  The Showgirl Must Go On embodies a lifetime of Bette's hits in world class staging with a supporting cast that for me has propelled Bette to the the very top of entertainers who have performed in Las Vegas. Most impressive are the new arrangements of some of her biggest hits.  ""Do You Want To Dance"" is sheer brilliance and magic, but the choreography of Boolya JaDa leaves me wondering how many months it must have taken to get the dancers to execute the precision timing of this number and reveal on stage costume transitions to the flawless levels exhibited.  Having lived here most of my life, I have seen them all, from Barbra Streisand (1969 & 2000), Cher, Elton John, Celine Dion, Rod Stewart, Frank Sinatra, Liza Minnelli, Judy Garland, Elvis Presley, David Foster with the many singers he produces including Michael Buble and every major production show the strip has offered for the past 40 years.  The Showgirl Must Go On zooms to the top of all Las Vegas shows I have seen because I have never felt any entertainer connect with the audience as The Divine Miss M does in this show.  When she sings, most of the time she is at the edge of the stage.  You feel as though she is talking to you in your living room during her monologue delivered while sitting on the stairs coming off the stage.  Best of all, Bette's incredible smile and genuine joy in delivering this amazing performance achieves what only a lifetime of stage experience and talent can produce.  You can watch this DVD for its production value or just play the music and be equally entertained.  I play the music as I fall asleep several nights a week as there is no other that makes me dream of the best moments of my life.

Sorry, Bette's been doing that character since the 80's and she let GaGa (who claims to be an avid Midler fan) know where she can find the video.

Miss Midler comes off as a semi-talented singer of little range and a kitsch/camp comedienne that has told the jokes so often that even she is unamused by them. If this were the only thing one had to view of hers, one would wonder how she became an icon, much less a noted and in some circles, talented performer. The diva takes a dive with this show.  I hoped for better. When I saw it on HBO, I watched with all the fascination viewing a train wreck and kept wishing it to be over but, as with any train wreck, could not avert eyes, as it were.

This DVD is a mere fraction of what was offered to those fortunate enough to watch her perform live.  Instead of cutting the many-too-many dancers interlude, they cut out the Delores Delago segment, which included five songs.  Several other songs were also cut, making this a brief teaser, however tantalizing, short shrift by anyones account.  Were literally left wanting more.",1484784000,,616,4.764150943396227
