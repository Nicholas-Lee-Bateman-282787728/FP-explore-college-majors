When I joined the Air Force back in 1951 and after basic training, I went to an school under contract  to Air Force in Glendale Calif. While going to school their I was able to go to one of Gene Autry's radio shows. Seeing him in person was a experience I still remember to this very day .I have about 30 of his movies and being able to add is Biography to my collation put the icing on the cake so to speak. The picture quality was far in some areas but over all very good. I would recommend this to any Gene Autry fans",1449273600,,662,3.860294117647059

7856991,5,6303935818,"This is a wonderful Biography of Gene Autry. As one of Gene Autry's greatest fans, I would highly recommend this video. It is narrated by Peter Graves. You will see clips of many of the videos that were so popular in the '40s and '50s when so many children and adults flocked to see America's Favorite Singing Cowboy, thus bridging the generation gap. Also there are interviews with many stars who performed with Gene Autry and many film clips showing him on his way to the top. No Western star ever did so well!! So if you would really like to see a true hero in action and how it all began, buy this video.
From one Autry fan to another, it's a must have!!!",1045267200,,659,4.28
