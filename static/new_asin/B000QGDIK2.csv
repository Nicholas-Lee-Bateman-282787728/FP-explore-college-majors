8196264,4,B000QGDIK2,"Pyare Mohan exploits the concept of a deaf guy and a blind guy pairing up to help each other get through life in clever ways. It works well and leads to some funny scenes. Much of the movie is pretty good but there are some scenes in the second half of the movie that made me squirm and struggle with whether to rate this movie 3 or 4, so 3 1/2.

The songs are reviewed separately to help you decide:

Har Mohan Ki struggles in the beginning but eventually finds its way to a good song with a very good male lead singer.

Rabba De De Jawani kicks off with almost a minute of good rhythm and drums that lead into the song.  This song features Amrita Rao and Esha Doel. Choreography is good and elevated by excellent backup dancers that we have seen in many big films.  Phenomenal female vocals that are as good as it gets put the icing on the cake.

Love You My Angel with all 4 leads (Amrita, Esha, Fardeen Khan and Vivek Oberoi) is flawless beautiful mush with an excellent male vocalist.

Ek Rabb Sach Hai is a video story of events that lead to the girls changing their feelings for the boys, who will die for them.  Superimposed on the video are more great male and female vocals making this a wonderful piece.

Pyare Mohan performed by Trickbaby (full screen on my copy under Special Features) is excellent. If you don't buy the movie try to view the video somewhere. By the way, the artist in the video is Sucheta Sharma, one of the actual models in the movie Fashion.",1301356800,,1474,4.292418772563177
8196265,3,B000QGDIK2,"India's underworld is ruled by Don Tony Fernandez and his brother Tiny. Tony decides that he has had enough, goes to confess in a Church, kills one of his men, and then gets himself killed via a car bomb. What the Indian authorities do not know is that Tony is alive and well, living in style in Bangkok, Thailand, along with Tiny. Then on a flight to Bangkok, a man named Dholakia, fearing that the plane is going crash, confesses to a priest that he is Tony, which is overheard by two sisters, Preeti and Piya Malhotra, who are headed to Bangkok to do a song and dance show. Tony kills the priest, and the police arrest the Malhotra sisters, and if found guilty, both will hang. But Tony is not taking any chances, he asks Tiny to ensure that the two sisters are killed. But hilarious chaos reigns when two former Bollywood stunt artistes, Pyare, and Mohan, intervene to save the Malhotra sisters. The only problem is that Pyare is blind...",1301270400,,942,4.482558139534884
8196266,4,B000QGDIK2,"One man is blind. One is deaf. Together they are hilarious. Vivek is a ball of energy while Fardeen presents a more subtle humor. Still, they are awesomely funny together. The car chase scene is a riot. Even more, the songs and the dance sequences make you want to move.",1259884800,,270,4.42
8196267,3,B000QGDIK2,"Pyare may be blind and Mohan may be deaf, but that doesn't stop these two friends from getting into brawls and getting jiggy on the dance floor. They seem content enough with their lot in life, even with their handicaps. But, this being Bollywood, Pyare and Mohan aren't shy about longing for true love. Enter Preeti and Priya, two sweet but struggling showgirls with whom Pyare and Mohan are instantly smitten. The guys declare their feelings, but are heartbroken when the girls rebuff them, because of their disabilities and because the girls only want to be friends with them. Then off the girls fly away to Bangkok and forever out of the lives of Pyare and Mohan.

Or so the guys think.

Despite that the film's opening sequence features an underworld don in a church's confessional booth telling a priest that he plans to murder someone - and then later acting on that promise - PYARE MOHAN is actually a farcical Bollywood comedy. But Boman Irani's turn as the menacing don isn't the only jarring thing about the movie. PYARE MOHAN does offer sporadic funny bits but, mostly, it gets bogged down by its unwieldly plot and awkward dialogue. There are several scenes which start off well, but then quickly descends into typical crude Bollywood comedy excess. One such promising moment is at the start of the movie, as the deaf Mohan gleefully dances at a wedding parade on the streets, but then strays from the wedding and ends up still dancing in front of a somber funeral. But, oh, then that ensuing painful schtick with Mohan and the dead guy's brother... It's sad that Mohan's miscues with his lip reading would constitute an excruciating running gag. Other lame stabs at humor involve a midget and a giant and a thug's noggin plunging into a horse's nether region. Way to go, way to class it up.

But I did like that the blind Pyare helps another blind man to cross the street.

Just so you know, the lads do get a second chance with the girls. About an hour into it, the film shifts gears and turns into an action thriller, as Preeti and Priya fly to Thailand to do a show and run afoul of a murderous crime lord. Pyare and Mohan learn of the girls' plight and dash off to the rescue, possibly to get their hearts trampled some more. Bollywood cinema never could let go of their romantic arcs. By the way, Pyare and Mohan have to be the most capable blind and deaf dudes around, the way they mopped the floor up with the thugsters. By the way, at times, an ability to put one's brain on park is a handy thing when sitting down to a Bollywood flick.

The cast is a mix and match of good and bad actors. Vivek Oberoi and Esha Deol both tend to leave me cold, with Oberoi hamming it up, as usual. I like Fardeen Khan and Amrita Rao, both of whom have done good stuff in the past (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ek-Khiladi-Ek-Haseena/dp/B000MCH1MG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ek Khiladi Ek Haseena</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Main-Hoon-Na/dp/B000LXSAIU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Main Hoon Na</a>). Amrita Rao is gorgeous, by the way. She always is. Boman Irani, a very good character actor, is again dependable in a supporting part; he's got an interesting (read: weird) take on his baseball bat-wielding gangster role, and affects a nasal voice which reminded me of Latka from TAXI.

Let's face it, Vivek Oberoi and Fardeen Khan aren't Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor, but then again, SEE NO EVIL, HEAR NO EVIL isn't the best of Wilder & Pryor. PYARE MOHAN, at two hours and ten minutes, is tolerable stuff, and I did like the very catchy title song, which plays at the end credits (nice picturization,too). So, for a one-time viewing, PYARE MOHAN isn't bad. But if you're forced to watch it twice, you might wish you had Boman Irani's bat handy...",1221264000,,4115,5.044117647058823
