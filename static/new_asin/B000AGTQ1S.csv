8088045,5,B000AGTQ1S,"Mascot Pictures produced this ""early talkie"" serial in 1932, featuring the ""Duke"" as air Pilot Larry Baker, who goes after a mysterious villain known as ""The Wrecker"", the man responsible for a train crash that killed his father. Glenn Strange is also in the cast, he's best remembered for playing the Frankenstein monster (after Karloff relinquished the role) and as bartender, Sam Noonan on TV's Gunsmoke. If you're interested in adding some inexpensive cliff hanger serials to your collection, this is great stuff! Cliffhanger serials like this were a big part of the ""night out at the movie's experience"" during the 1930's and 1940's. The DVD has good image and audio quality for a public domain title. The film does show signs of wear, but the picture's image is sharp and clear. The companies logo appears at the bottom corner of the TV screen every so often. This is a one sided disc with 12 chapters. An early bit of film history and a chance to see young John Wayne, that's certainly worth a look!",1395014400,,1006,4.7542857142857144
