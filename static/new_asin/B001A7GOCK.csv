3445907,1,B001A7GOCK,this is a high speed killer workout... if you can't coordinate like a dancing queen look elsewhere,1222041600,8,98,4.823529411764706
3445908,5,B001A7GOCK,This is my first dvd by Amy Bento and I will purchase more.  She is great as an instructor.  No nonsense with great exercises.  I really worked up a sweat.  I loved how I could customize my workout based on how much time I had.,1220313600,10,227,3.977777777777778
3445909,5,B001A7GOCK,I have several of Amy's other workouts and rank this right up there with my favorites.  I also purchased the other Amy Bento ten minute solution with the band and together these are a great total body workout.  What I like is you select the sections you want in the order you want.  I do the entire dvd at one time and really get a great heart pumping workout with the bootcamp style she uses.  In three of the segments she uses weight to really hit the target areas.  You feel this workout the next day and know you did something good for your body.  The instruction is straight forward and she does use some really innovative and fun moves that hit areas you normally don't in other workout dvds.  The music is upbeat and Amy is a great instructor.  If you want results I suggest this dvd.,1219363200,7,791,4.297297297297297
3445910,4,B001A7GOCK,"Good mix of cardio with focus on lower body. Amy has better workouts, but it's ok, not my favorite though. Overall it's very fast-paced going from one move to the next with just a few reps making the strength pieces not very effective. I consider it cardio throughout (except for abs+stretch).",1219276800,7,293,4.764705882352941
3445911,5,B001A7GOCK,"This workout doesn't mess around.  I workout everyday and I was struggling to keep up, especially on the first section ""Hot Body Cardio""...wow!  I also loved the amount of cardio that is featured on this DVD.  I really liked the instructor, Amy Bento.  She was very encouraging  and gave helpful instructions.  I can definitely feel my muscles after this workout plus I feel that I got a good cardio workout, too.  The toning sections ""Ab Assault and ""Rock Bottom Sculpt"" had some really unique moves that I have not done in other workouts.  I will be adding this to my rotation to do on a regular basis, that is for sure!",1217635200,25,622,4.54054054054054
3445912,5,B001A7GOCK,"Amy Bento is a great instructor.  She's outgoing and friendly and not annoying or too much.  She's motivating and encourages you to keep at it when you might want to give up.  These mini workouts are great to do because they are a little challenging and you know they're short so you can do at least one (and before you know it, you might want to do another one or two of them to really increase the cardio time you put in to your workout).
The five routines here are Hot Body Cardio, Ab Assault, Rock Bottom Sculpt, Calorie Blasting Drills and Better Body Stretch (my favourite).  Normally I wouldn't workout for this short amount of time, but this is a fantastic idea for either when you are just starting out and want short bursts to help increase your fitness, or when you are short on time.  I really enjoy these mini workouts and do the stretching on it's own after either this dvd, or another dvd or a long walk.  I highly recommend this new 10 Minute Solution dvd as it's as good as all the others.",1216339200,30,1006,4.324468085106383
3445913,3,B001A7GOCK,I like doing workout dvd's at home when I get in a funk at the gym. I do like the dvd but you will need weights to do some of the workouts.....I'm not mad about that but other people should know so when they do the workout they are not leaving that out.,1359331200,2,253,3.792452830188679
3445914,1,B001A7GOCK,"First of all, being ex-military, I found this dvd totally appalling! Anyone whose been in the military can tell
you that first the exercise is demonstrated, then executed! This instructor, if she is one, was all over the
place! I was frustrated after one minute, thank God, I purchased this at a thrift store! Whoever gave it away, knew
something I had to learn for myself! I like some of the ""10 Minute Solution"" dvds, unfortunately, not this one!
PLEASE... I beg you, save your money!",1353974400,6,486,4.662790697674419
3445915,5,B001A7GOCK,"I love all the 10 minute solution. All the collection have at least 4-5 different works out, in every 10 minute increments. They are easy and before you know it you want to do the other exercise to. I always end up doing at least 3 and that's at least 25 minute of fast,fun and mixed work out that works.

Worth every penny, get it if you have no time for gyms.",1353888000,,361,4.013888888888889
3445916,4,B001A7GOCK,"I like this video for nights when I only have 10 minutes of time and energy. I feel like I am getting a decent work out. It is not a very difficult video. She does a lot of moves that are hard to keep up with and doesn't transition as easily as other videos I have tried, but I still like it. You can do more of the segments if you have more than 10 minutes which is nice.",1348185600,,372,3.721518987341772
3445917,5,B001A7GOCK,I love this DVD. I am a busy mom.  But I can find time to do one of the five workouts each day.  I can already see the results.,1334448000,,127,3.3448275862068964
3445918,4,B001A7GOCK,The work outs in this video are super intense.  After the first 2 minutes it was necessary to pause the video to breathe! But it is certainly one heck of a work out.  10 minutes well spent,1313020800,,188,4.054054054054054
3445919,4,B001A7GOCK,"One of the recent fads in fitness is the boot camp style workouts, and I've started to enjoy these types of workouts, too.  I got this DVD expecting an intense workout, and I have to admit that I was somewhat disappointed.  I didn't feel like I got enough upper body work, and I thought that the ab workout wasn't tough enough.  However, I still thought that this was an excellent workout on terms of cardio and lower body, and I will definitely be doing it often.

Amy Bento, the instructor on this DVD, wasn't the best presenter, in my opinion.  It felt like she was trying to be rough and silly at the same time, which just didn't work.  Her instruction wasn't always that clear, although for the most part she cued well.  Also, she tends to bounce and bop all over the place when doing some of the exercises, which is kind of distracting, not to mention bad form.  But she still seemed genuine and friendly, to some degree, and I would be interested in trying another of her DVDs in the future.

Now, like all DVDs in the ""10 Minute Solution"" brand, this DVD is divided into 5 10-minute workouts.  They are:

Hot Body Cardio - This segment definitely gets your heart rate up and burns some major fat!  You start off with about a 60-second warm up (which includes some stretching) before moving onto your first three exercises: jumping rope and high knees; shuffling right and left with lunge jumps; and squat thrusts with ski jumps, mountain climbers, and a jump up.  You then put these moves together into a combo before moving onto the next three exercises: fast running while lifting your knees (like running through tires); jump squats going side, forward, side; and one leg jumps (over a ""barb wire fence"") with squats.  Needless to say, by the end of this, your heart should be racing!  Amy does finish with some stretches, by the way.

Calorie Blasting Drills - This section requires hand weights and is more like an interval workout.  You start with a warm-up then do four drills in the next 8-9 minutes.  The first one requires you to do jumping jacks before doing some jump twists then you do some squats with rows with weights.  Second drill: lunges with weight raises forward and back then move on to weight raises with the weights forward, side, back, side.  Third drill: running over weights (like an obstacle course) before doing bicep and tricep work while balancing on one leg.  Finally, the fourth drill requires you to do a push up, plank on elbows, and push up to the side.  It all sounds really complicated, but once you do it once or twice, you'll get the hang of it.

Ab Assault - This segment is a really unique way of targeting your abs, and it also includes hand weights.  I found it to be rather useless, although it did still spike my heart rate.  After a warm up, you do some circles with a weight while balancing on one leg.  Next, you do some throw outs to the side with the weights that supposed to work your obliques; after that, you do some bends and rotations while holding the weights.  Next, some circles around your body with one weight before moving onto a chopping crunch on the floor.  Finally you finish with rolling side planks, kick crunches, mud crawls, back work, and stretches.

Rock Bottom Sculpt - This workout is designed to target your glutes mostly, but it really works the entire lower body.  Like the other workouts, you start with a quick warm up before moving onto your first exercise, weaving your weight around your legs with a side lunge.  Next, you do some hamstring work, leaning over your legs with the hand weights.  After that, you move onto mountain climbers with explosions and hand weights.  Next are some really tough lunges, donkey kicks, and leg extensions up.  You do some more glute work on the ground before finishing with a short cool down.

Better Body Stretch - This section is great to cool down your body to a higher degree than the mini cool downs at the each of each segment; also, it uses a towel.  I really didn't find that the stretches in this segment focused on the muscles you had worked the hardest in this workout, but the stretches still feel fantastic.  You stand up the first half and start off with bends and leans before stretching your hamstrings and hips.  The second half is on the floor and stretches hamstrings, hips, back, quads, and calves.  What I really wanted and needed stretched were my glutes and thighs, and I just didn't find that these were stretched in this otherwise fantastic section.

Overall, this is a very good DVD with a lot of high points like the amazing cardio and lower body work, and the stretch is nice, too.  However, the lack of arm and ab work really took away from the workout.  I found ""10 Minute Solution: Ultimate Bootcamp"" to be much tougher and a better workout overall, but I still recommend this DVD as a great workout.",1298246400,3,4857,4.548387096774194
3445920,4,B001A7GOCK,"Love it, love it! Lot's of energy with Amy Bento. I have many of the 10 minute exercise videos, but this one definitely works you to the point of being out of breath - in just 10 minutes.",1293926400,,187,3.9473684210526314
3445921,5,B001A7GOCK,"I love that this video gets right down to business. I can so one 10 min segment and feel like I had a ""real"" workout. High intensity and some challenging moves. Great for doing around the kids.",1273104000,,193,4.243243243243243
3445922,1,B001A7GOCK,"This workout is entirely too easy. Plus, she doesn't explain what you are supposed to do too well, which I feel like could result in injury for a lot of people who don't know too much about working out. I think the only one that seemed to make me feel anything was the calorie blaster. But hey, if you are new to working out, this video will be great if you are safe!",1261526400,5,367,4.041095890410959
3445923,3,B001A7GOCK,"Maybe it's just me, but when I think ""Bootcamp"" I think rigorous workouts that keep your heart rate up.  The first 2 sections were not bad for cardio - the moves were great, kept my heart rate up.  But the last two sections was completely just about toning.  If you're looking for a complete cardio workout, look elsewhere.",1260576000,,323,4.5344827586206895
3445924,5,B001A7GOCK,"Hot Body Boot Camp is a fun, yet effective workout.  Amy keeps your interest by changing movements often...something I appreciate since I get bored really easily!  There a some tough ""bootcamp"" moves in this - my fav was the mud crawl.  Mountain climbers, good mornings or cherry pickers, high knee jog are some moves Amy includes in this.

Her footwork isn't difficult to catch on to.  She says the moves before she does them....if it's confusing, just back it up - it won't take long before you get it =) Worked up a good sweat, good glute work too!  I wish there were a couple more 10 min. segments on this!",1254009600,4,610,4.45045045045045
3445925,5,B001A7GOCK,"I am not going to lie to people viewing this product... it is tough!  But, if you are looking to get into shape, this workout is a great one to include in your workout regimen.  Amy Bento keeps your heart pumping and your body moving.  She shifts you from movement to movement so quickly that the 10 minute segment is over before you know it.

For those reviewers who gave this video only one star, I encourage you to stick with it (except for people with significant joint or back problems).  If you continue to incorporate the video in your fitness routine, you will soon find that you are able to do the moves (modify your movement or do a few sets of the combinations to begin).  I used to hate doing the ""jumping"" moves or the ""standing to floor"" moves.  Now, I love them; they are a great way to get into shape or back into shape.  This workout is for people who are at an intermediate to advanced level (although for the truly advanced, you might find this workout a breeze).  Be careful when starting this workout if you are new to boot camp.  And remember, always consult your doctor before starting any exercise program!",1251676800,,1130,4.415458937198068
3445926,1,B001A7GOCK,"Generally, I tend to like the 10 minute solution fitness series. Not this one.  I would only recommend this video to someone who is BOTH at an advanced fitness level and can adapt easily to more complicated choreography.
  The video's main weaknesses lay in its inconsistent and ineffective cueing (verbal directions given to the home audience). There were also not enough hints/instructions given that described how to protect particular vulnerable body areas (like joints or back)for the more difficult moves. This made me feel that the instructor did not have her audience's best interests in mind.
  For a better value in the 10 minute series, I recommend Kelly Martin's Kickboxing workout or the Belly Flat blaster with Suzanne Bowen.",1248220800,12,739,5.176470588235294
3445927,3,B001A7GOCK,"I thought this would have a lot more cardio, bootcamp style. There's a lot more toning, and the toning segments seem to alternate so much between picking up and putting down the weights that it seems like a bit of a time-waster.",1238457600,7,228,4.4523809523809526
3445928,4,B001A7GOCK,"This is a fast, fun, effective workout, but be warned that there is lots of impact, and you have to be quick.  Some of the moves are very tricky, and by the time you get it, she's on to something else, a no-no in exercise routines, as far as I'm concerned.  At one point she has you quickly weaving a dumbbell around your knees in a squat position.  Duh -- I hit my knee with the dumbbell.  So this is a ""use your head"" workout:  figure out your own activity/fitness level and work accordingly.  Do that, and this one will tone you up fast.  Younger, fitter exercisers who like to run will love it.",1234915200,,598,4.192982456140351
3445929,4,B001A7GOCK,"This is a great workout...  there are even a couple of the moves that I just physically don't think I can do yet, and I'm not new to this.  Amy is really good, but she moves fast (sort of have to since there's only 10 minute segments), so you have to pay attention and it may take a couple of times before you follow.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because she uses ""drills"" which is repeating the same exercise and it would've been nice to just keep it moving on to new exercises.  Overall though, great sweat and I bought it after renting it!",1232755200,2,558,4.091743119266055
3445930,3,B001A7GOCK,"the aerobic moves were kind of difficult and corny.  But the 10 minute abs, butt, and stretch segments are great.",1222646400,5,113,4.65
3445931,3,B001A7GOCK,"This is a tough workout for beginners, but nice for intermediate. I would not recommend this to people with knee or back problems, because it involves getting up and down from the floor really quickly and other moves that are hard on the knees. Its a pretty good workout for those of you who exercise regularly, but not for short term users.",1222214400,45,341,4.516129032258065
3445932,5,B001A7GOCK,"Love it!!  This workout kicks my butt but really makes me feel strong and empowered.  I can't do the whole video yet, but I keep coming back to it because it's GOOD!  I can definitely feel the workout in my muscles.  I like the fact that it's a bit challenging--ensures I won't get bored and gives me something to strive for--completing the whole video!  I also like the instructor, Amy Bento; she's very encouraging and makes me want to keep trying.  This is my second workout video by her, and I'll definitely try other videos by her when I see them.",1222214400,9,552,4.415841584158416

8276298,1,B001A7GOCK,"I'm at an intermediate level and I found this workout to be way too easy.  After doing all 5 sections, I still felt like I needed to do something else for additional cardio.  (And I don't normally exercise for 50+ minutes.) Save your money!",1432598400,,240,4.431818181818182
8276299,2,B001A7GOCK,"I really liked the two other 10 Minute Solution dvd's by Amy Bento - the 5 Day Get Fit Mix and the Tone Trouble Zones, and several of the others (Butt Lift, High Intensity Interval Training, and Carb Burner are the best I've tried so far) for the mix and match variety they provide to my daily 30 minute workouts, so I had high hopes for this one.  Unfortunately, she transitions so fast, you can hardly get set and started before she moves on again, which ultimately wastes my time because I'm not getting the full workout - and you need every second of such short workouts.  It wasn't really boot camp style either.",1427673600,,617,4.4035087719298245

8276302,5,B001A7GOCK,"This is one of the best 1o Minute Solution workouts that I have done. Yes, Amy Bento is a little weird and takes the ""I'm your drill sergeant"" thing a little too far, but I'm willing to look over that because the workout itself is pretty good. My favorite is the Calorie Blasting Drills segment. Each drill consists of 2 parts, cardio and strength. Going back and forth between the two really got my heart rate up. I would say that this is one of the harder of the 10 Min Sol, so don't start with this one if you're a beginner. But if you like strength training and challenging yourself, you'll enjoy this one.",1379894400,,610,4.3130434782608695
8276303,3,B001A7GOCK,i found this too difficult but depends on what you are used to!  Also it goes at such a fast pace that it's hard to follow the first few times because there's no demonstration of what you are about to do - it just goes right into this face paced workout and you are not sure what the next step will be.  I enjoyed it once i'd done it a few times and could follow along with the steps better but still found it too intense for me.  Probably would not purchase again.,1378944000,2,465,3.978494623655914
8276304,4,B001A7GOCK,I really enjoy these 10 min workouts. I always put all of the workouts together as 10 minutes alone would NEVER be enough! Running the whole series together though gives a good workout and the time always seems to fly.,1362355200,,218,4.475
8276305,2,B001A7GOCK,"This video only has 2 true boot camp segments, for the price it might be worth it but don't expect to be able to do all 5 and get a good workout. Has 10 minutes just for stretching and 10 minutes of ab work- both super slow pace.",1359936000,,229,3.7916666666666665
