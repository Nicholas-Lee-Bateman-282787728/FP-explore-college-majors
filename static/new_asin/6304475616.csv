7872571,5,6304475616,"Hercules, as is usual in this series of films, helps people, as an ancient Superman, despite the frequent interference of his somewhat foolish and overly-sexed father, the god Zeus, and Zeus's wife Hera, who is determined in each episode to take revenge on Hercules for the adultery committed by her husband Zeus a generation ago that resulted in Hercules' birth. The theme of this episode is way men abuse their wives, verbally and by actions, and the reactions of the women in a particular village. A villager begs Hercules to come to his village and help the villagers against beasts that are killing the men of his village who try to capture them, and who come to the village from time to time to rape the men. There are only men and boys in the village. All the women left. The men find infant boys at a stream at times, never girls, and they raise the males.

 Hercules agrees to go. He takes a friend with him, who will shortly marry a woman who cannot cook, but has half of her breasts visible. Hercules advises his friend never to give women any power because the result will be bad for him and everyone else. He tells his mother that no woman will ever be able to entice him as the bad cook enticed his friend. Zeus adds his advice to Hercules: it is impossible to change a woman if she doesn't want to be changed. We see two episodes of women washing the feet of men. Hercules tells a woman: we don't dominate you, we protect you.

 Hercules discovers that the ""beasts"" are the women from the village who are living in the forest and being trained as amazons. They rape the men of the village to replenish the females of their group, while they send unwanted sons to the village. They are led by a beautiful woman who, despite Hercules' prior protestations, entices him. We see a scene where the amazons ride into the village to rape the men, and over-sexed Zeus is there to ""allow himself"" to be raped.

 Who created this situation of amazon women refusing to live with men? How can the men stop being raped? How can they persuade the women to return to them? Should they learn how to wash their wives' feet? What advice will Hercules, who obviously doesn't understand women, give the men? What will happen between him and the amazon queen?",1301443200,2,2252,4.480487804878049
7872572,5,6304475616,"Hercules and Ioleus visit a village that is frequently under attack by a  local Amazon tribe. To prove himself to the Amazon Queen, Hippolyta,  Hercules must endure the worst of Hera's torments. All in a day's Hercs.  Great fun, touch of romance, tweak of corny humor.

7872573,5,6304475616,"Hercules and the Amazon Women can be said to have everything, action, humor, romance, and a great cast ranging from Kevin Sorbo and Anthony Quinn to Roma Dowmey.  If you love the Hercules T.V. show, check this one out!  also keep a look out for Lucy Lawless in a role before Xena.",955324800,6,280,4.365384615384615
7872574,4,6304475616,"This is such a great movie.  Thr first time I saw it I was on the edge of my seat.  It's wonderful how you can see it over and over and notice things that you didn't notice before.  And after Xena Warrior Princess  became such a hit anyone can pick her out of the Amazons.  She does an  extraordinary job of portraying her character.  Roma Downy does an  exceptional job of playing Hippolyta.  And Kevin Sorbo, what can I say, he  always does a great job of playing Hercules.  I love this movie!",949104000,4,495,4.21505376344086
