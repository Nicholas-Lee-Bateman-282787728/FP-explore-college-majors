7817119,3,6301903749,"I have already seen this film years ago, however I am going to see this film tonight at the Alamo Drafthouse DFW  at 9:10pm. The film is being screened as part of the Alamo's Analog Assault series in which the theater plays crappy vhs films and only charges $1 for admission. So hey, it's only a dollar right? This film will probably never make it to DVD, therefore I am probably going to buy a copy, and I would do the same if you like obscure, and silly films. This one is a cyborg rape revenge flick. Go figure.",1385424000,,514,4.191919191919192
