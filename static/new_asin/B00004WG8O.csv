1364610,3,B00004WG8O,"This was one of the most popular of the Hartnell episodes, garnering 12-13 million viewers in the U.K. alone when it was broadcast, more than the eerie, dark, Rod Sterlingesque Invasion of the Daleks, more than the quirky and frequently inspired The Chase (hard to find that kind of character acting anymore). The popularity of the definitely strange Web Planet might make the modern day viewer scratch his/her head.  Unfortunately, this is another episode that had to be resurrected from old re-recordings; these look like they came from a basement in lower schmooville -- they are very faded, dim, with poor sound quality. I swear I felt like I was on drugs when I was watching it, the picture was so strange at times.  This is the best anyone could do with this almost lost episode, and unfortunately, along with the clarity went a lot of the charm. I think it is a collectable worth watching by the die hard Who afficianado, and I have an affectionate regard for its 60s ""kids show"" sort of flavor. But this particular episode, in stark contrast to Invasion and Chase, is most definitely a kids show. And a kids show from the early 60s.",1017187200,4,1140,4.666666666666667
1364611,1,B00004WG8O,"Just a major correction, which a true Dr Who fan would know....Dr. Who was produced by the BBC's Drama and Serial Department through it's entire life. The BBC had a separate Cildren's Program Department. Dr Who was considered by the BBC to be a program geared towards young adults and adults. Of course there was a following by children as well, but technically speaking, this was not a ""children's program"".",1011744000,2,408,4.8428571428571425
1364612,2,B00004WG8O,"One of the great things about Doctor Who is that despite its age, especially in regards to the William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton eras, the stories stand the test of time.  Unfortunately, The Web Planet is one of those few exceptions.  The alien insect creatures are laughable.  The story is ploddingly drawn out.  The regular cast members are given no opportunities to shine.  A soundtrack would have helped somewhat to move this along.  There are dramatic moments that are left for dead because of the lack of musical background.  The Web Planet is one of those stories that is solely for the avid Doctor Who fan.  For the casual viewer or for the person who is trying to relive a childhood memeory, stear clear of this one.  It'll ruin the memory.",987206400,2,754,4.694656488549619

1364650,2,B00004WG8O,"Phew!  This one is rough-going.  Some people seem to be able to overlook the 'Lost in Space' laughability of the costumes, but I can't.  There would be many more cheesy costumes in years to come but these are the worst. Although he was the originator of the character Hartnell would never be as effective again as he was in his first few stories. His ever-increasing cackling and clucking to cover the fumbling of his lines is often painful to watch. This may be Doctor Who sacrilege but I almost prefer the performance of Richard Hurndall as the first Doctor in 'The Five Doctors' since his lines are delivered crisply and you get more of a sense of a formidable intellect than you often got from Hartnell.

1364651,5,B00004WG8O,"I love this Doctor Who story from the William Hartnell years on so many levels, I hardly know where to begin. If this had been filmed in French with English subtitles, I have no doubt it would be regarded as one of the greatest art films in cinematic history.

The costumes for the insect races (with the possible exception of the antlike Zarbi) are ingenious, far too elaborate for the black-and-white television medium for which they were created, and yet they are still magnificent.

But what really takes this adventure to the next level is the acting. The actors created distinctive dialogue and gestures for the mothlike Menoptra and grublike Optera that make them some of the most compelling, convincing aliens in the entire Doctor Who oeuvre.

And where the BBC really gives the viewer full value is in the extra features. In addition to an excellent 37-minute making-of featurette, the DVD also includes the 1965 Doctor Who Annual on PC-ROM (these picture books were a popular Christmas present in the U.K.) as well as a Give-A-Show film strip based on the story.

I rate this a must-have for any Doctor Who collection, one of the top 10 DVDs ever produced of this groundbreaking BBC series.",1232064000,,1200,4.810679611650485
1364652,5,B00004WG8O,"There are many reasons I enjoyed The Web Planet.  I like the First Doctor.  I like stories that focus on aliens.  I like aliens who don't look too human.  I like insects.  Also, at least I think so, the more complex the story the better.  In this story we have at least three threads that we get to follow by the time we reach the closing episode.  The idea is a planet has become invaded by an alien force, so powerful, so strong, that even the TARDIS has been dragged off course, forced to land onto the planet.  There is a war between the moth-like Menoptra and the giant ant-like Zarbi.
There are also tons of extras, including a short story from the very first Doctor Who Annual read by William Russell, a Doctor Who film-strip show, and a cool making of feature.  Great stuff that really gets me into that sci-fi fan mood.  Get the pop corn and turn down the lights.",1219276800,,872,4.294478527607362
1364663,4,B00004WG8O,"This is another one of those stories that everyone likes to complain about because of the costumes and such. However, when one goes back and checks the special effects on some other shows around this time (IE The Outer Limits which had a bigger budget,if I remember right), the quality isn't that off. YES, it's laughable now but not so much then. One needs to remember that this was a show that didn't have a very big budget, it's known more for it's writing and acting than special effects.

I became a fan of the show back in the '70's and three or so years after, it was discovered that many of the old episodes that I'd been hearing and reading about weren't kept. Since then, some have reappeared and hopefully even more will. The story itself is actually pretty good and given the fact that there are so many episodes missing from this time, I'm more than happy to have it. Remember when it was shot, nobody expected it to last 40+ years.",1211587200,3,945,4.431034482758621
1364664,1,B00004WG8O,I never got to watch this DVD because it was sent damaged and come to think of it I never got a refund for it either.,1210377600,,117,3.5384615384615383
1364665,5,B00004WG8O,"When his TARDIS is mysteriously drawn to a planet he doesn't initially recognize, the Doctor (William Hartnell) finds himself in the middle of a war between two insectoid races in ""The Web Planet.""  Along for the ride are Ian (William Russell), Barbara (Jacqueline Hill) and Vicki (Maureen O'Brien).  Soon after landing, the group is split up in a seemingly systematic way.  The Doctor and Ian go out to determine exactly where they are.  Barbara nurses Vicki, who's harmed by a bizarre noise after the initial landing, at first, but is soon drawn out into the barren lands they've arrived upon.  Then Vicki and the TARDIS are whisked away to another location on the planet, with nobody knowing where they've gone.  As the story unfolds, we meet the human-sized ants known as the Zarbi and their mortal enemies, the butterfly/bee-like Menoptra.  The two races are at war for primacy over the planet which the viewer learns is called Vortis.  The Doctor and his companions are split up even more, with Ian being isolated with one of the Menoptra and the Doctor eventually finding Vicki, the TARDIS and the Animus, a creature that controls the Zarbi and has them do its bidding.  The Doctor must find out who rightfully deserves to call Vortis home, and he must also determine what the Animus is really up to.  He must also figure a way for himself and his companions to get off of the planet before any harm befalls them.

William Hartnell's cranky incarnation of the Doctor is in top form here.  He's mysterious, funny and blunt all rolled into one.  It's almost as if his mind is so full of wisdom that his brain has trouble extracting it.  William Russell and Jacqueline Hill hold their own as always.  Maureen O'Brien does a solid job as well.  Each person gets to shine on their own.  Russell takes a prime role when he and the Menoptra Vrestin (Rosalyn de Winter) discover the Optera, a grub-like breed of Menoptra who live under the surface of Vortis.  Hill, who I've always felt was one of the best companions of the entire series, deals not only with the Menoptra, but the Zarbi as well.  O'Brien's Vicki shows initiative during a crucial moment in the last episode of the serial.

Loved by some, laughed at by others, ""The Web Planet"" is a wonderful serial to debate with other Whovians.  Sure, the costumes and sets are laughable by today's standards, but the story is so well written that a general sense of fear arises in spite of this.  In all honesty, I felt that the use of Vaseline on the camera lenses to give a sense of the planet's atmosphere was a brilliant idea.  There's also wonderful camera work in an all-too-brief shot from above with Ian, Vrestin, and the Optera.  Pick it apart enough, and you might find the ""The Web Planet"" was well ahead of its time in both story and special effects.

The DVD comes with everything Who fans expect to find on these wonderful BBC discs.  There's a photo gallery, production notes, a PC-ROM Doctor Who Annual, wonderful commentary and my personal favorite, ""Tales From Isop,"" which gives the viewer a wonderful look at the work that went into the production of ""The Web Planet.""

I highly recommend it to new and old fans of ""Doctor Who"" as well as anybody who believes you have to have great special effects to make a story work.  This one will prove'em all wrong.",1209340800,3,3328,4.642735042735043
1364666,3,B00004WG8O,"This is a classic Doctor who story.

yes by our standards the special effects are not super. Yes the new series has been doing better effects.

BUT do NOT judge it by our standerds. you simply cant.

just simply except it for what it is.

it was good for the standards of that time period.

they spent alot of money on this one. so much so that they did not have as much money for future stories. which is why some effects on episodes after this are not as good.

This is one of my favorite of the first doctor stories.

A truly aliean world filled with aliean people. You've got Butterfly Menoptra, catipiller like Optera, beetal like Larvae guns, and at the center of it all is the spider like Animus.

Ian, Barbra, Viki, and the Doctor travel across the planet Vortis in the Isop galixy. they find the world barren and desolet. the Zarbi patrol the land like guards with the Larvae to aid them. the old temples are abadoned. the Optera live deep under the ground. the Menoptra have fled from their home world. a large web is growing across the planet. it overruns the land. the powerful Animus lays in the center of the web waiting and watching.

the Doctor and his companions help to face this evil and to overthrow it.

One of my favorite sceans is where the Menoptra enter into the old temple.
he tells about the past of Vortis.

how the Menoptra built temples, worshiped Light as their god, and wove a cacoon of peace.

THIS is why this story is a classic.
in this short speach you get the history, cultur, and religion of this planet.
which is unusual.

most shows will just have alieans with little or no development of their cultur or back story.

this story is an exception.

which make it all the more special.

just as the Menoptra worship light.
the Optera have their own religion.
they worship the menoptra that fly, for they were of the same species but had long ago shed their wings and burrowed under the ground.

for thousands of years Vortis was at peace, it was a lush beautfuil place. and then the evil came.

the Animus poisioned the world.

and so the Doctor has to stop this evil.

This is another example of classic 'Who'
facing tyrants who have destroyed a world and rule with an iron fist.
helping the rebels overthow the tyrants and restoring order.
(you see this format allthroughout the classic series).

the only naff moment is the animus claiming it wants to steal the secrets of space travel from man.
and yet the animus itself seems to have traveled from space to Vortis.

but despite this, this is a GREAT classic doctor who story.

so just sit back and watch, but don't judge it,
acept it for what it is ane enjoy.",1206662400,3,2651,4.420618556701031
1364667,3,B00004WG8O,"Well, I am always happy when the BBC gets around to releasing the DVD's of the classic series because it takes so long for these DVD's to come out.  What I don't understand is how they pick which ones to release.

Part of the problem with the Hartnell and Troughton stories is that many of them are still missing from the BBC archives, so the selections are few.  But there are better Hartnell stories out there than this one.  I think someone has a soft spot in their heart for the alien of the story -the Zarbi.

This is a slow moving story although not as slow as some of Hartnell's earlier ones.  But sitting through this one can be a challenge. It feels disjointed at times.

Even the extras are rather weak. It is good that some of the players are still around after all this time.  Original producer Verity Lambert and William Russell (Ian Chesterton) offer commentary. I wasn't very interested in Russell's 56 minute audio readng.  I don't speak Spanish so I had no interest in the Spanish soundtrack version of Episode Six.

But as I suggested up top, the quicker these classic shows can be released the better.",1181865600,,1120,4.5
1364668,5,B00004WG8O,"To judge a story made 40 years ago using today's standards is absoluely unfair. Some people are clueless. Of course it's gonna look inferior. It was made in 1966. They didn't have the artsy effects that they currently have. DUH!!!  The truth is that Web Planet was considered ground-breaking at the time. The effects used had never been tried before.  Had it come out today, it would be labeled innovative and win many Sundance movie awards for independent film making, or whatever it is they call that festival. The preceding rant was brought to you by me. If you don't like it dial 5477-69-277 on your phone pad (or simply click on the ""no"" button).  I've stated this in a previous review but here it is again. If the story is bad, that is one thing, but to knock a 1960s story for using the special effects of the 1960s is utterly ridiculous.  The Web Planet will keep the viewer enthralled throughout.",1174694400,29,905,4.567901234567901
1364669,5,B00004WG8O,"Well, depending on your taste, ""The Web Planet"" is either vintage wine or soured vinegar. Opinion is dramatically divided on this one, and while I guess I'm in the ""vintage wine"" camp let me just make clear that I see where the detractors are coming from. I'm not sure how the special effects appeared to viewers in 1965, but age has not been kind to them and they look pretty fake today. Yes, I have to admit, when I first saw the Zarbi on the screen, I laughed despite myself--and this was by no means the last occasion I did so during this DVD. And the pacing is slow as snails by today's post-MTV standards and is bound to make the contemporary viewer feel at least a bit antsy.

For me, the epic storyline and the ingenuous conceptualization of the insectoid inhabitants of the planet Vortis more than make up for these problems. Especially the latter. In the 1960's how revolutionary it must have been to have ""bug-eyed monsters"" as the good guys, but the writer (Bill Strutton) goes way beyond that, endowing the characters with plausibly alien mannerisms, thought patterns, and cultural traits in a way unmatched by much science fiction even today. This is especially so of the Menoptra with their poetically alien turns of phrase almost sung rather than spoken, their gracefully moth-like body language, and their religion of Light-worship along with the cocoon-like organic, weirdly expressionistic design of their temples. And then there's the unusual idiom of the grub-like Optra, which makes them seem convincingly non-human (even if the actors' costumes don't): for instance, coming to a barrier in an underground passage, their leader says ""A silent wall. We must make mouths in it with our weapons, then it will speak more light."" Fascinating, imaginative, and original--speculative in the best traditions of science fiction.

Oh, and of course there's the Doctor. As usual, William Hartnell's rendition of the character is classic, and his long, tense battle of wits with the Animus is a high point of the story. Much of the suspense of the story lies here, in fact: how long can the Doctor con the villain into keeping him and his companions alive while not completely giving away the attack plan of the Menoptra ""cavalry"" (as it were). Hartnell pulls this off brilliantly, projecting stern resolve and intense intellectual agility with just a sparkle of mischief in his eye.

For all of these reasons, ""The Web Planet"" transcends its limitations and succeeds as vintage TV sci-fi a la BBC. To help with the (now) slow pacing, I might suggest watching only one or two of the six episodes at a time instead of watching it all in one go. Like a fine wine, it must be savored slowly, not gulped down. As for the effects, sit down and watch this DVD in the right frame of mind, disbelief suitably suspended and with a willingness to see past to the great story and fascinating ideas beyond the surface. Doctor Who fans should be well used to doing this anyway--in this case they might just have to work a bit harder at it, that's all.",1170288000,14,3048,4.768939393939394
1364670,1,B00004WG8O,"I have seen every Doctor Who episode ever made, and most of them enough times to have memorized the wittier dialog.

I own every Doctor Who DVD published so far, and will buy every DVD put out in future ... EXCEPT THIS ONE.

I would not watch a single minute of any episode of this horrendous abomination of a show to save my own life.

It would have been a great episode if it had had the merest semblance of a plot, remotely convincing costumes and effects, sets that didn't look completely artificial and sound hollow, and sound effects that didn't grate on the nerves like nails drawn across the chalkboard.

Don't get me wrong: I usually don't much mind the poor production values of the early years, and can overlook them in every other early Doctor Who every made (even The Gunfighters).

But, you have to draw the line somewhere, and I draw it when I see inept extras prancing around the Doctor in butterfly suits while earnestly intoning gibberish in the rapid melodramatic crescendos and diminuendos  of their butterfly language.

1364671,2,B00004WG8O,"I can't honestly say that this serial episode is very good.  The aliens are just not at all well realized, and the conflict between them is just not interesting enough storywise to overcome that major fault.  Also, the Zarbi sound effects are so annoying that I was tempted several times to stop watching.

That said, the concept of the story is SO ambitious that -- given how little money was spent on ""Doctor Who"" during this era -- I can't help but give everyone associated some applause for even trying it.  In my opinion, they failed, but failing every now and then isn't the worst thing in the world.  And I also have to admit, William Hartnell is very good in this story, and some of the dialogue is excellent.  All in all, I think it's a weak story, but very much worth seeing for fans of the franchise.

And, of course, the bonus features are typically great.  You've got to love the BBC.",1163894400,4,897,4.426829268292683

Turn a blind Eye to the sets that move or the one time the Zarbi (giant ants) actually runs into the camera.  THis is Dr Who we are talking about the show didn't have time for retakes due to flubbed lines ( hartnell has a lot) or errors on set.  Close enough was usually Good enough for the BBC.

The William Hartnell serial ""The Web Planet,"" in which the Doctor and his companions Ian, Barbara & Vicki get involved in a war between insectoid races on an alien planet, has a marvelous story, memorable characters, and plenty of imagination to spare. I love the whole look and feel to it, too, and I think the story is a very delightful one. This is also a great story for the principle cast of the show, as they all get to shine in their roles, including William Hartnell as the tetchy but still-loveable First Doctor, the grandfather we'd all love to have.

1364696,5,B00004WG8O,"Another two adventures with the intrepid Time Lord Doctor Who join the ever expanding library of DVD releases, this time focusing on two earlier eras from the original BBC series featuring Doctor's number one and three - William Hartnell and Jon Pertwee. The Web Planet and Inferno are both lengthy stories which have achieved iconic status in the show's history, albeit for very different reasons.

The earlier story, The Web Planet, a six-part epic from the show's second season, broadcast in the late Winter of 1965 was at the time the most expensive and indeed the most popular story the series had produced. In a very daring move for its era, the story is set in a completely alien world featuring no humanoid characters at all, save for the four regular cast members. The inhabitants of the planet Zarbi are in fact all insect based life forms and the budget for creating all of the required costumes, special effects and unworldly scenes was far higher than the show's normal allowance. Unfortunately, nothing ages faster than special effects and alas, forty-one years later, the cutting edge and innovative design of the show is now somewhat risible. In addition, it has to be said that the storyline itself is somewhat lacking. Early Doctor Who was so much slower than the fast paced drama we expect from modern TV, but even taking that into account The Web Planet certainly drags along somewhat tediously. Yet despite this, viewers at the time lapped it up and it achieved the highest ratings ever recorded for the show until 1975 and indeed only three Doctor Who stories have ever out-stripped it in the audience figures.

Inferno, the fourth and closing story from Jon Pertwee's first season as the Doctor, originally broadcast in the UK in the Spring of 1970, is also hampered by length, stretching to an even longer seven episode count. But somehow, despite the misgivings of the production team, the longer format does in fact work particularly well for this story. Set on present day Earth, the Doctor is worried by a deranged scientist's plans to bore through the Earth's crust to un-tap a new energy source. Inadvertently slipping sideways into a fascist run parallel Earth, the Doctor meets all the same characters in their Nazi-like alter-egos and witnesses the end of the world. Thankfully he gets back to the real Earth in time to stop the project. This split storyline works incredibly well and it's clear that the regular cast completely relish the opportunity to play what are in effect two completely different characters in one story. It does drag, there's no getting away from that, but the separate story strands do keep the pace going and although the ratings took a big dip while it was on air, the audience appreciation figures were the highest for the entire season.

It's usually the extras that are included with each Doctor Who DVD that make the discs so worthwhile, including the stunning restoration work for the original tapes. Both stories have indeed been restored to their original broadcast quality and are very impressive prints as a result. Alas, I was somewhat disappointed with the other extras that were included. For The Web Planet, there's a commentary track featuring the show's original Producer Verity Lambert along with the story's Director Richard Martin. They are joined by one of the regular cast, William Russell Enoch, and guest actor Martin Jarvis. They all contribute elsewhere, along with the other surviving member of the regular cast, Maureen O'Brien, with a 37 minute documentary on the making of the show. Alas, there is so much duplication in this documentary and the commentary, that it almost makes it redundant. Everything else included in the DVD are either sound or picture files, including a 56 minute audio story featuring the Zarbi and an alternate Spanish soundtrack for episode six. For Inferno, all the extras are bundled onto a second disc and include two 35 minute documentaries, one on the making of the show and one on the early days of the UNIT team that supported the Doctor during his exile on Earth. The commentary for the story is provided in the main by Producer Barry Letts, Script Editor Terrance Dicks and actor Nicholas Courtney who played the regular supporting role of The Brigadier. For two episodes, the commentary is given over to John Levene, who played the role of Sergeant Benton regularly from 1968 to 1975 and makes his biggest appearance in a story to date in Inferno. Letts, Dicks and Courtney always provide an interesting commentary and they work so well together, but I do feel they are being a bit overused. I was particularly disappointed that Caroline John, who played the Doctor's assistant Liz Shaw, was not part of the commentary team as she was the leading lady for this entire season, but only featured in four stories. Not utilizing her seems a missed opportunity to me, particularly as Courtney makes many, many more appearances in the show so there is enormous scope for him to be used on future soundtracks. As this was her fourth and last story, Ms. John should have had a lot to contribute and indeed she is featured in both documentaries. The remaining extras are mainly again pictorial files and it has to be said that they are somewhat lackluster. The focus on this release is clearly the story itself - and that's nothing to complain about.

Inferno is often cited as one of the fan's favorite stories from the Pertwee era and I certainly agree with that line. Producer Letts makes it fairly clear he's not in that particular camp, but he admits at the end of the final episode that it's perhaps not as bad as he thought! The Web Planet team is also very proud of their work and given what they had to work with at the time, this seems fairly justified. Both are welcome additions to the Doctor Who DVD library and make entertaining viewing for sure.",1157587200,2,5875,4.831181727904667

Too mnay times I see reviews for items BEFORE the ""customer"" can possibly have received the item! That's why I only pay attention to reviews AFTER the item has been released, and not before. There could be a defect, or something the ""customer"" has no idea about if they are reveiwing prior to the item coming out. I speak from experience, I want to know exactly what I'm getting when I order online. Thank you. Now that that is said, all I can say is that this story is unusual and unique amongst Doctor Who stories. I cannot make any statements on the DVD quality or the extras because it isn't out yet. I have pre-oreder this, and am looking forward to it though.",1149206400,4,843,4.445161290322581
1364698,5,B00004WG8O,"I hated this story the first time! I saw those ants and those butterflies and I thought what in blazers is this! The dark power this, the zarbi that.

But not long ago I watched it a second time. I loved watching the long first-scene sequence where Barbara (and the young woman, can't remember her name) are fiddling around in the tardis and it's starts moving about and Barbara tries to look after her... And then you see Ian and the Doctor outside and it echoes... and then the story breaks! :)

When you watch it the second time, you just realize how unique it is. You think to yourself they don't make shows like this anymore! And they can even make a good story about ants and butterflies intriging! The plot is good and it's just total fantasy. It all ties in well.

I like the slow movingness of the early era where they seemed to spend more time discovering things.

Only if you are not so keen on pure fantasy-like story lines you may not like it. But even then you may still find it interesting.

Don't judge by appearances. Watch it a second time. You'll love it, I am sure.

Only thing I didn't like was the sound quality. Maybe it's the age of the video casettes, but the sound kept ""booming."" I wonder if other people have had this similar problem.",1105401600,7,1262,4.348936170212766
1364699,5,B00004WG8O,"""What have we got?  Echoes, interference, gold, and now acid.  Yes, similar properties to formic acid.  It's strange, isn't it?"" says the Doctor on the planet Vortis, on which the TARDIS has been forced to land.  It's a dark and forbidding place, dotted with mesas and plateaus.
The Zarbi, gigantic ants, with larvae guns, sowbug-looking creatures with a long snout that shoot lethal bolts of electricity, terrorize the Doctor and his friends.  Trying to regain their planet are the Menoptera, gentle butterfly-like creatures.
Controlling the Zarbi is the Animus, whose deep, malevolent female voice, is one of the well-realized aspects of the show.  The Doctor is forced to discover the plans of the Menopteran invasion force so the Zarbi can defeat them.  Young Vicki helps him and her actions here, unintended or not, shows her to be more resourceful compared to his wimpy granddaughter Susan.  One piece of dialogue that'll make one either cringe or laugh is the Doctor's demand to the Animus re its ceiling-built tube-like communication unit:  ""Drop down this hairdryer or whatever it is.""
The reason why some may consider this story to be one of the worst is the realization of the Zarbi, but these steel and fibreglass-constructed insects are great, unless you have to be one.  The rearmost legs, closest to the tail, are the actors, and John Scott Martin, who played one of them, said that one couldn't stand upright because the tail was longer than the actor.  The only way to stand upright was to get on a one-foot riser block and place the tail over the block's end.  The subterranean grub-like Optera are clearly laughable, the actors jumping up and down and grunting away, but their pale makeup indicate their time spent underground, and the hopping showing their evolutionary regression.
But the Menoptera costumes are simply wonderful, black bodysuits with strips of yellow fur, and wings with the veins painted black that could flap a full five feet from wingtip to wingtip with a hidden mechanism.  The actors playing the Menoptera adapt mime-like hand gestures hinting at a more feeling aspect of the race.
In looking at the name of the giant insectoids, it's clear the storywriting team looked to entomology.  There are the Zarbi, who are giant ants, the Menoptera, who look like butterflies, but have bee-like stripes, and then their subterranean evolutionary offshoot, the Optera.  Well, ants and bees are all under the insect order Hymenoptera.
Another interesting aspect is the name of the enemy.  It's called the Animus, which means bitter hostility or hatred.  However, the Menoptera see it more medical terms, by calling its headquarters the Carcinome.  Vrestin tells Ian that the Animus appeared and grew like a fungus.  In other words, they see it as a malignant cancer on the world of Vortis.  And the Living Cell Destructor, or Isop Tope, is analogous to an isotope that kills cancer.
For people raised on Star Wars or Jurassic Park, the visuals may seem lame, but as an experimental story, it works wonders.  One of the most imaginative stories, and an attempt to see how weird Dr. Who could get.  Ratings for this story averaged 12.5 million viewers, and Episode 1 charted at #7, the lowest-rating one at #14, so not bad at all!",1080172800,22,3260,4.943119266055046

By all means, avoid this adventure AT ALL COSTS!!  it will put you to sleep, it'll give you headaches, it'll make you hate yourself during the course of it.",1033084800,5,842,4.641891891891892
1364701,5,B00004WG8O,"This story was originally broadcast between 13 February and 20 March 1965 and is renowned for being one of the most scary Doctor Who stories.
Not since 'Them' which postulated giant ants careering around the desert in Nevada had a story involving insects generated so much excitement in Britain at least. No-one likes bugs, which is one of the reasons audiences cheered at 'Starship Troopers', but our hostility is directed at small ones. We know that ants in particular, are highly intelligent creatures but that does not mean that they have to be our friends.
This story is one where the idea of a central, superior intelligence is again utilised. It is a device which was used quite a lot throughout the Doctor's travels and hear it appears as a metaphor for big government. Doctor Who has always been an anti-authoritarian, libertarian figure and this story is one which draws those characteristics into sharp relief. The Zarbi are controlled by  the intelligence as unlike earth ants they are described originally as peaceful, mindless creatures. Transformed by the intelligence into mindless drones they capture and enslave through the use of a thought control device and tearing the wings of the Menoptra. Clearly they represent government forces while the Menoptra, thrust into a warlike role in order to regain their planet from the forces of darkness represent the light. Butterflies are the beloved of nature. We admire their light wing structure and the varieated colours. They stand for liberty and creativity, of arts and intellectual persuits.
Despite their weapons being no match for those of the Zarbi and the intelligence the Menoptra engage the enemy and with the Doctor's help overcome.
The story has some surreal moments and is slower paced but we should not forget that this is drama after all. Unlike some of the Pertwee stories where there is a case for more ruthless editing, in this case the pace is used to establish and build on the concept of the passage of time and to help create a bigger scale than the studio dimensions would allow.
I believe that the passage of time since these shows were broadcast has not been good to them. It is hard to understand their impact on viewers who were young at the time and had no prior knowledge of some of the special effects. Also, I believe that most of us have been so exposed to second by second action and a dizzying array of special effects over the last twenty years or so, that they have become almost like a drug such that we crave them all the time, and slower paced action shows do not meet the need.
For it's time this was an excellent Hartnell story and a favourite for many of the viewers at the time.",1026172800,14,2684,4.747323340471092

The costumes are extravagant, yet simple in design; actually,
having a quaint charm contrary to today's overly ""high-tech"" film offerings ( the way the old Godzilla suit is preferred over the computer animated version, or the way the first Star Wars movie is still one of the best). The Story is very focused, and truely has the quality of a BIZARRE DREAM -- the whole thing is EXTREMELY DREAM-LIKE !  It has a eeriness still unmatched today
due to the fact that the alien's lives are the primary focus,
and the three humans are peripheral ! A MUST to the collector
of old films ( of course, anyone expecting modern special effects
will be disappointed ). If you realize what you are watching, and
try to get into it, YOU WILL LOVE IT ! It remindes me very much of a Twilight Zone or Outer Limits classical film.",1019952000,6,875,4.434782608695652

I have never given a 2 star rating to a Who ever before. While I am more than happy to have this classic Hartnell story added to my collection, the pathetic acting just kills it for me. Even the regular cast seemed to be struggling through this one.

Granted, it's hard to act as an insect but this was just bad and it was dragged out for six episodes. Normally these shows keep my attention but it was tough getting through this one.

It had a few decent things however. The use of a Vasiline smeared lens on ""outside"" shots on the planet was effective in making the alien landscape appear just a bit more alien. The story line itself wasn't bad. It also pushed the limits of production available at the time and they managed to pull it off decently but again, it all comes back to the pathetic acting of the various insects bringing it all down.

All in all however, it is still worth getting to add to your collection. Just don't expect a lot from it because it just isn't there.",1438905600,,1142,4.327102803738318
