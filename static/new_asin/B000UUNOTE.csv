8214862,5,B000UUNOTE,"Provocative coming of age movie about a man who keeps his family at home all the time, but who, when he is not around engage in sexual actions including satisfying themselves. No overt nudity, but very provocative scenes. I seen the movie listed in a guide sold on Amazon.com kindle titled THE DEFINITIVE GUIDE TO GIRLS IN COMING OF AGE MOVIES 2015 which lists over 600 similar movies. I also recommend Mocking Bird Don't Sing and Angela starring Miranday Stuart Rhyne they too were listed in the book.",1423958400,,502,4.715909090909091
8214863,5,B000UUNOTE,"This is one of Mexico's greatest films. The tale of a father who imposes his philosophy of absolute ethics and morals on his family ends up becoming an oppressed family with the father as the absolute dictator. This film is a psychological thriller. I am sure this film has been used in classes of Psychology. Claudio Brook gave an excellent performance.

It is unfortunate that the manufacturer decided to discontinue the production of this film. I recommend you visit [...] the official website of the film's manufacturer. Good luck! It is very rare to find this great film!",1229040000,2,576,4.877551020408164
