7904095,5,B000006DMW,"History buffs will enjoy this History Channel version of the Hindenburg story.  Using still pictures, film clips, and eyewitness accounts the film details the history of the famous airship from its development to its fiery demise.  Impressive close-up shots of the disaster from different angles give new meaning to the familiar images.  In addition to the experiences of the crash survivors, especially memorable is the courage of the Navy ground crew, ordered to stand fast to assist victims in spite of the conflagration above their heads.  One of the American nurses who tended the victims is also of special note.  She disapproved of the Nazis, but the swastika remained at the door of the hospital, she asserts, and common humanity prevailed.  It was the first air disaster to become a spectacular media event.  On-the-spot radio coverage and especially the newsreel film vividly emphasized the terrible events in a way that eludes newspaper descriptions and history books.  This single event heralded the end of commercial airship travel.  The film tells the story of the great dirigibles from the days of the eccentric Count Zeppelin to the work of the brilliant Hugo Eckener.  There is an ironic contrast between the success of the Graf Zeppelin and the dismal fate of the Hindenburg.  The hydrogen vs. helium debate is resurrected, including America's political decision not to sell helium to Nazi Germany.  Ultimately, everything from static electricity to sabotage was blamed for the disaster.  The film draws no conclusions, other than to observe that the controversy continues.  For zeppelin fans, there is an abundance of film showing a number of airships in flight.  Recommended for multiple viewing.  ;-)",991958400,16,1721,5.226277372262774
