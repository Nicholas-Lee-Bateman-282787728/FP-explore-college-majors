5014578,5,B006QZ7ZHE,"This video covers about 13 basic repairs that can be done at home by a reasonably tactic person. The repairs are simple yet we see them every year we start up the old mower or ????? Just understanding how things are put together is worth the purchase. The video uses a lawn mower and a two cycle weed eater showing general symptoms, causes and repairs. Almost everything that goes wrong with small motors usually starts in the carburetor. KC review three types showing repair procedures. Only simple hand tools are needed with a little shop or garage space. A second disk with more complex repairs for riding lawn mowers and garden tractors would be great. It might cover such things as breaks, steering, manual and hydraulic transmissions, PTOs and electrical systems.",1399420800,2,769,4.877862595419847

8503433,2,B006QZ7ZHE,"Not all that bad, but not very good or detailed.  Weak examples and not in depth,Doea have good video.  Mostly just shows very basic problems and fixes.  Cuts course short on total carb rebuilds from the little two strokes carb and cheats you by only talking about how to remove the spring to get to jet and shows two types of Ignition coils but only shows how to remove gear from one (easy one) and just talks about how to do it with the other.
