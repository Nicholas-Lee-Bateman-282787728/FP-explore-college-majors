8116201,5,B000F0H79M,"This is the Italian language version of the classic science fiction movie ""Planet of the Vampires"". I bought this DVD because I am studying Italian. The audio track is in Italian and you can view English subtitles or Italian subtitles for the hearing impaired.

You know this science fiction film is Italian since the actors are stylish, ""la bella figura"". Their black leather space suits are still pretty cool looking. These spacemen would look good on vespas. The set design is kind of retro but it doesn't look very convincing now. The huge skeletons on the alien ship and the alien voice recording will still give you chills.

This is probably the best Italian science fiction film ever made and it is fun to use it for Italian language study.",1393200000,,747,4.7384615384615385
