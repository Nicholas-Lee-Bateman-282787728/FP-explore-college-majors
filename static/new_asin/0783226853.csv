48527,5,0783226853,"""The Day of the Jackel"" not to be confused with the inferior remake ""The Jackel"", is a marvelous character study of the coldest, coolest, most illusive and highly skilled assassin ever brought to the silver screen.  With a superior cast headed by Edward Fox, and an outstanding script, this  movie plunges the viewer in a riveting cat-and-mouse manhunt.
No, this  movie doesn't have explosions and car chases, but what it does have is  intelligence and suspense.  The tension builds wonderfully as the Jackel, a  man of brilliant disguises, nears his prey (Charles de Gaulle) with the  intrepid constable a step behind.
Rent it or buy it, but for heaven  sakes, see it!  Between 1 and 10, ""The Day of the Jackel"" gets a 10.
As  far as the remake, ""The Jackel"", in and of itself, it isn't really a bad  film, it has just been modernized and adulterated with gadgets in lieu of a  believable script.",930614400,27,897,4.67948717948718
48528,5,0783226853,"The previous reviewer must not have watched this movie and to compare it to that crap that Bruce Willis did last year is comical. This movie has mega suspense and the assassin (Fox) is one of the coolest killers to ever  grace the big screen. Bruce Willis was a joke trying to recreate this  character, no wonder Forsyth didn't want anything to do with the remake.  This is why every critic in America gave it 1 star, Ebert called it  ""The worst movie of the year"". If you want to be entertained and  pleasantly surprised, BUY this movie. You will love it.  The book was  great, the movie is better.",914284800,3,599,4.390909090909091
48529,3,0783226853,"Altough this film has a plausible and entertaining storyline, it is a whimsical and naive tale of intrigue for the modern viewer.  The story deals with a plot by French political terrorists who are so inept at assasination that they must hire a ""professional"" killer from Britain to do their work. Action scenes are blissfuly innocent by today's standards, with the villain dispatching people with one ""judo chop"" or trying to use a single shot .22 magnum rifle as an assasination weapon. As a background for the much more plausible and exciting remake (""The Jackal"" with Bruce Willis and Richard Gere) it is an interesting historical study.  END",901238400,3,646,4.972222222222222

48579,5,0783226853,"This is one of my favorite films, so much so that whenever I see Edward Fox in another film, and this happens often, I think of his portrayal of the Jackal in this film.  He was excellent. He made the film a true delight. I think that this is his best role. I saw it the first time about forty years ago. This is the second time that I saw this film and I still enjoy it very much. The story is about the Jackal hired for an enormous sum to kill Charles DE Gaulle, his planning to do so, and the work of the agents of several countries to stop him from doing so. There are many maneuverings and killings on both sides which are very interesting. The top detective was assigned to capture him and he performed exceptionally.",1513555200,2,723,4.164285714285715

48585,2,0783226853,"Good movie but the picture will not fill up the new flat screen tv's in 16:9 or 4:3 ratio. Maybe because it's release date was 1998 and before the larger flat screen TV's. Be forewarned if you want a wide screen version as shown on the cover. It will be wide screened but in a letterbox format around the entire picture. If you enjoyed your old 23"" tube TV, this will be a slight upgrade. I'm keeping it because it is a good movie and they do not have an upgraded version.",1509235200,,472,4.141304347826087

48590,5,0783226853,"Director Fred Zinnemann never confined himself to a single genre but tended toward stories of protagonists confronted by a moral dilemma  (""High Noon,"" ""A Man For All Seasons""). ""The Day of the Jackal"" departs from that template, but, like his other, best-known works, does ratchet up considerable tension while building to a satisfying climax. Even though we know the MacGuffin and, therefore, how  the movie will end (Charles de Gaulle did not die by an assassin's hand), Zinnemann shoots and edits the film with such confidence that you're almost persuaded that de Gaulle is on the verge of certain death and wonder how he will escape it. The film is a master class in cross-cutting two convergent stories: one, the procedure of an expert assassin, utterly charming and devoid of conscience (Edward Fox); the other, the careful but banal detective (Michael Lonsdale) who is out to stop him. Another delight in this film is its naturalistic portrayal of heinous crime and its detection: for all the expertise and ingenuity displayed by the principals, many things go wrong, requiring improvisation on both sides and heightening the tension. Well acted all around, with high production values.",1505260800,2,1194,5.149484536082475
48591,4,0783226853,"The Day of the Jackal directed by Fred Zinnemann is very faithful to the novel by Frederick Forsythe.  It follows the hiring of a professional assassin who is hired to kill President Charles De Gaulle.  And the efforts by the French police and security forces to discover who he is and stop him.  Very few changes to the novel, mainly to speed the plot along.  Although this was a British film, the two main French police men are played by Derek Jacobi and Michael Lonsdale, who puts in one of usual almost asleep performances, thus the only reason I knocked a star off.  Zinnemann said he wanted fairly unknown persons to play the parts.  So, certainly there were plentiful French actors who could have taken these parts.  The remake called the Jackal takes aspects of the plot, adds a rather stupid secondary plot, but is worth seeing only for Sidney Poitier and Bruce Willis.  This is the better, and more suspenseful movie.",1505260800,,927,4.679012345679013
48592,3,0783226853,"French characters speaking English instead of French ruined it for me. Very inauthentic, and I would have much preferred to have seen a film about Frenchmen where the characters actually spoke their own language.  A pity because the film is a time capsule of sorts, with great footage of early 1970s Paris and London, and the plot is fairly interesting. The real history behind the OAS and De Gaulle is a very fascinating tale. I am certain, however, that when the OAS gathered around to hatch their plots against De Gaulle they were not conversing in English.",1504656000,,560,4.77319587628866

48605,4,0783226853,"Edward Fox at his strict, efficient best. Edward Fox plays The Jackal, a hired assassin tasked to kill President Charles DeGaulle of France on Liberation day, 1963. The problem is, the French know about it. And they can't stop him. Da da da da. (Beethoven's fifth opening sounds..)
Based on the Frederick Forsyth best selling novel, The Day of the Jackal traces the progress of The Jackal as he employs implacable modern techniques..(for the time, after all, this is 1963) ruthless efficiency, cunning of his namesake, a moral vacuity more suited to a snake and a  relentless dedication to his job. Can the frumpy, pigeon loving Inspector Lebel, a paragon of French introversion,  defeat the venal, cold blooded Englishman? You'll have to watch the whoole movie to find out.

48620,5,0783226853,"This is the original, the remake is ""The Jackal"" with Bruce Willis but this one is very close to the novel by Frederick Forsyth.  The remake is also good, but I usually enjoy the original films better.  This is about a fictional attempt to assassinate President de Gaulle of France in the 1960's.  There actually were assassination attempts made on de Gaulle, but this story is fictional.  I will defer to the other reviewers as to the background and politics involved, but the film does an excellent job of providing the setting, so as to give one the best emotional motivation for what follows.  I find that the best part of watching these old films that are based on classic books, is that it motivates me to purchase and read the novel.  As it happens I already own a copy of this one.  Really, the only disappointment I experienced in watching the film, was that I felt that the ending was a bit too abrupt, while the novel at least gave a bit more story to tie things up.",1486339200,,977,4.424581005586592

Add to that the directing, acting, and casting, results in a top notch piece of work.  Speaking of casting, relative unknown actors were used on purpose, and it worked beautifully.  The only problem the producers of ""The Jackal"" had, in my view, is that they competed with classics also released in 1973, such as ""The Sting"" and ""American Graffiti,"" among others.  For this reason, ""Jackal"" is not as well known.  Nevertheless, it is among my own top ten movies.  Highly recommended.  Betcha couldn't tell.

48666,5,0783226853,"The Day of the Jackal is based on the first book written by Frederick Forsyth. The film is great, as is the book. With a few changes, this film follows the book closely. Edward Fox is exceptional as the hired hit man,""the Jackal"" to take down the French President Charles DeGaulle. The film is fast paced and a great character study as you watch ""the Jackal"" do anything and everything he can to fulfill his mission. While at the same time, the French police are trying to track down the killer they know was hired, but have no idea who he is, or where to find him. And when they do try to catch him, more than one he proves elusive.
Overall, a great action film everyone should watch at least once. The DVD is great quality with balanced audio and video. I highly recommend. We already have this film on VHS and watch it over and over.",1467590400,2,836,4.2974683544303796

A measure of a great film is the bit parts, and bit players. And two here really hit the ball out of the stadium -- Cyril Cusack (long established at that point) and Ronald Pickup. Pickup, as the forger, made his career from this film. And Cusack, as the gun maker, put the cap on his. Really just topflight filmmaking.

It is so interesting to see how the Law dealt with international terrorism back then. It was still in its early phases really, still finding its way and its means of message, while the authorities scrambled to deal with it, understand it...but at least ultimately---to Stop it!

48762,5,0783226853,"I remember reading Frederick Forsyth's masterful thriller ""The Day of the Jackal"" way back in the 1970s, when I was still in college. Unfortunately, I never got to see the movie that was made from the book...

...Until last weekend, that is, when I discovered ""The Day of the Jackal"" on Amazon Video. I quickly purchased it, adding it to my video library.

The film version of ""The Day of the Jackal"" is every bit as good as the book it's based on. The movie's plot is pretty straightforward: during the early 1960s in France, a right-wing domestic paramilitary group, opposed to French President Charles de Gaulle's policies concerning Algeria, has made several unsuccessful attempts to assassinate de Gaulle. The group's leaders decide to hire a foreign contract killer to take on the job of killing the French president. That man turns out to be a cold, ruthless, but outwardly suave man known only as ""The Jackal.""

Senior ministers in the French government are made aware of the plot against de Gaulle's life. They assign their best investigator - an assistant police commissioner named Lebel - to find out if the plot is real, who is behind it, and who the assassin is that's supposed to kill the French president. The film shows the parallel courses of action taken by ""The Jackal"" (played by British character actor Edward Fox) and Commissioner Lebel (played by French actor Michael Lonsdale).

Although there isn't a great deal of ""shoot 'em up"" action in ""The Day of the Jackal,"" the film consistently maintains a high degree of ""edge-of-your-seat"" suspense throughout its 132-minute running time. I found myself completely engrossed in the film from its opening to its closing credits. The acting is superb, the screenplay by Kenneth Ross is always taut and tense, and Fred Zinneman's direction is masterful.

""The Day of the Jackal"" is a political/crime thriller at its very best. Most highly recommended.",1453161600,15,1917,4.959501557632398
48763,5,0783226853,"One of the Best Movies Ever Made...I agree! And probably Edward Fox's best role. One of the best political intrigue/action films made.

48780,5,0783226853,"The Day of the Jackal, 1973 film

August 1962 was a stormy time for France. The OAS hated De Gaulle for giving independence to Algeria. They attempted to assassinate De Gaulle, but luck was still with Charles le Grand. The conspirators decided to hire a professional who is unknown in France. It is possible to assassinate De Gaulle, the trick is to get away to spend the pay-off. No notes must be kept, the OAS leaders must be carefully guarded until the job is done. The assassin begins to study his target, who will always be in public. This Jackal will create a valid but false identity using a dead person's name. We see his preparations for the job; we see the French Secret Service shadowing the OAS high command. The OAS planted a spy on a high-level Minister in Paris. ""Duggan"" arranged for another set of identity papers, then visits Paris to scout for a room on the top floor. August in Paris is vacation time; ""Duggan"" buys French clothes for his disguise.

The French Secret Service captured the OAS messenger and interrogated him to get information. But they only learned the outline of the plot, not the details. The French need to identify the person who visited the OAS leaders for half an hour two months earlier! They contact foreign police for their informal cooperation. The film shows them investigating leads while ""Duggan"" continues his preparations. The film shows what is happening there is often little explanatory dialogue. ""Duggan"" figures how to find a place where his papers won't be checked, and how to disguise his white car. This stress takes a toll on ""Duggan"". The best-laid plans never allow for human error or the unexpected. The murder of Madame now makes this an ordinary crime of murder. But ""Duggan"" knows of a trick or two; he will not stay in a public hotel. The police are able to figure out the new identity, and identify the Minister who leaked the information. ""Duggan"" silences another person who helped him. August 25 is the celebration of Liberation Day in Paris, a major French holiday. De Gaulle will appear for a speech and award medals. The scenes of a French parade reminds me of the parades of yesteryear.

""Duggan"" reinvents himself disguised as a one-legged French veteran of the Resistance. He is able to pass the barriers for the public and enters an apartment house to go up to the top floor, then enter an empty apartment to prepare for the assassination. Detective Lebel checked with the police guards, and learned of the one-legged man. He takes this gendarme up to the top floor where they prevent the assassination. This film was a big hit for its dramatic story. The parallels to the assassination of JFK are obvious but unstated. Like other fast-paced films, you won't think of the implausibilities (the dependence on being able to pass a police barrier!). Would Detective Lebel take part in the search unarmed?

48839,4,0783226853,"Many have written insightful reviews praising this now historic movie for excellence in many areas of film. I agree it is a Beautifully photographed, detailed and sweeping panorama. It  includes  a cold, focused, ectomorphic hired killer and  people who hire him, help him, protect him, and love him, as well as  those who try to stop him.

The artful successes of this movie are many and have been reviewed by others.

I wanted to point out the brief but carefully crafted performance of Cyril Cusack, who had a long career and in my opinion was always terrific.  Cyril Cusack plays a gunsmith paid to produce a custom-made weapon for the assassin.  At the very beginning of his scene, as Cusack comes on-camera,  he somehow resembles Claude Raines (Casablanca), with all that may bring to mind.

I wanted to mention something I noticed--which is that at times the suspense is increased because one character seems to resemble another and we wonder who it is.
Two French actresses, neither born in France, both born into families of diplomats, play small but pivotal roles in Day of the Jackal.  Their names are Olga Georges-Picot  and Delphine Seyrig.  One plays an auburn-haired girl hired by the OAS (Organisation Armee Secrete). Her job as OAS mole  is  to burrow deeply into the private life of someone currently  helping to find the OAS assassin, and to report back any information.  This she does.

The other, Delphine Seyrig, plays an auburn-haired Frenchwoman,  living in a beautiful country home like a chateau, who encounters the assassin by chance. The meeting changes her life, and the life of the assassin.

1973, when this movie was first shown, is approximately the time more explicitness showed up in novels and films, possibly also in song lyrics.  Are we better off?
Whether the  flashes of nudity--the hired assassin's backside lighted to emphasize the musculature--are appropriate for  a  PG rated movie is a valid question raised in these reviews.  Probably this isn't PG at all,  given the series of murders the assassin performs to hide his trail.

What the nudity may have been intended to show was how vulnerable and  very far offtrack the assassin had allowed himself to go.  One could say he lost focus and lost sight of his main objective ,  Very dangerous results for him...

I  do think some historical background would be helpful for anyone viewing this film.  What was the Organisation Armee Secrete?  (OAS). Was deGaulle really a survivor of 30 attempts on his life?  What was the Algerian question about?

I do feel if the rating is kept at PG, it will  require a lot of parental guidance.  It's about murder,  and paid murder at that.

Very sweeping,  film, wonderfully pictorial of Parisian landmarks and culture, and also the south of France, a little of Italy.",1431216000,4,2800,4.872340425531915

48862,4,0783226853,"One of the interesting things about having a healthy regard for the history of cinematography is to be able to date the films from a look at their production values, at least since the close of the silent era. Those early black and white films with their grainy flickering quality later refined to some very dramatic and story enhancing shadowing that made many a film better than its story line or acting. A bit later the surprisingly liquid-ish quality of the first color films (I still am amazed though by the purity of that dazzling snow-drenched mountain in the Paramount logo when one of their products hits my screen) and how the digital age has refined that process to a greater sharpness. We can also, and the film under review, The Day Of The Jackal, is a prime example of this, pretty much date the time when a film took place by such things as the cars used, the kinds of travel, the fashions, and technology used at the time.

And in the case of political thrillers like Jackal the police procedures. While the film was released in 1973 the time line of the story is set in 1963 in France just after then President Charles De Gaulle agreed, reluctantly agreed, to Algerian independence (the massive resistance led by the Algerian National Liberation Front had a lot to do with that fact as did the ferocity of the struggle they lead and the French reaction as poignantly shown in a film like Battle of Algiers). Naturally, as we witnessed in the United States in the wake of our own Algeria-like fight in the former French possession of Vietnam not everybody was happy about that outcome, especially among some elements of the French military who had actually fought and bled in those battles. I have never seen or heard of anything similar here by the military around the defeat in Vietnam, at least that has been exposed, but in France some elements decided to do something about the matter and formed a secret organization, the OAS, to overthrow the De Gaulle government.

In the normal course of events such operations usually are exposed, are usually thwarted in their attempts and that is that. For the most part that is what happened with the OAS using its own personnel to create chaos in due course and the leaders and ranks were rounded up. So those still left on the outside of prison or of the country decided to hire a professional, a hit man, somebody outside the organization to assassinate De Gaulle. The thread of the rest of the story goes on from there.

Of course to hire the services of hit man (we will use hit man here because as we find out in the end who knows what his real name was), a man of such specialized skills who would need to retire after such a kill means providing enough dough to do that. And that is really where the whole project comes unglued since OAS agents are forced into a series of large scale bank robberies to finance the caper, some getting caught and if not informing then the police had an idea that something was being planned by the organization. Those actions set off the various police agencies under the direction of the Ministry of Interior who were monitoring OAS activities to try to find out what they were up to, why they needed so much money. It is that old-fashioned process of tracking down the hit man (played by Edward Fox) which dates this film. The almost painful use of registries and other archival documents to trace who might have come into the country at a certain point and where, where he might have stayed, who he might be once the police decided it was not a French national, to speak of the untold number of man hours in such searches almost seemed comical some fifty plus years later. Today all that could have been gleaned from some international centralized computer base in about an hour and that would be that. Or maybe a quick check of the NSA vacuum cleaner operation.

Well not quite because old-fashioned paper hunts or digital speed our hit man is quite the professional, knows enough to keep ahead of the police through most of the two hours of the film and the remake does that with a more modern hit man (Bruce Willis). One would think our hit man would also have competing technologies to keep himself in the game. What our hit man, our hit man, needed to be then, or now, is a ruthless stone-cold killer to carry out his mission and along the way use and discard (kill) anybody and everybody who could possibly identify him. So our hit man had good run but as we know, or should know by now, President De Gaulle died in his bed so you know stone-cold killer or not he ran out of luck. All in all though still a pretty good film.",1429228800,,4636,4.502375296912114

49048,5,0783226853,"When British journalist and foreign correspondent Frederick Forsyth turned to writing fiction, his first novel, The Day of the Jackal became an international best-seller, which was then brilliantly adapted for the big screen.  The story concerns a professional assassin, code named ""the Jackal"", who is hired by the French dissident group OAS, to assassinate France's President, Charles de Gaulle.  Edward Fox stars as the mysterious and extremely intelligent Jackal, who meticulously plans how he will accomplish the task, and then proceeds to make it a reality.

After the OAS fail in an attempt to kill the President, the French secret service increase their efforts against the OAS, and discover that the Jackal has been hired.  High ranking police official Claude Lebel (Michael Lonsdale), leads the effort to stop the threat.  Combined efforts involving the intelligence services of several countries, produces a lead in Britain.  This increases the pressure on The Jackal, who even when advised that his cover has been blown, continues with his deadly mission, coming within inches of success.

Most of the key elements from the book are included in the movie, which under the direction of Fred Zinnemann, remains engaging and interesting, throughout out its lengthy 143 minute run.  Told in dry matter of fact manner, the story unfolds in a straightforward and quite believable manner, as the focus is mainly split between the Jackal's activities, and those of the authorities, as they zero in on their prey.

Tension builds naturally, with few attempts to overdramatize the situations.  Edward Fox is brilliant as the Jackal, a professional who handles any complication, and save for an odd romantic episode, is completely focused on his mission.  The low key Lebel, may not appear to be overflowing with energy, but he does succeed in his mission to save the President.

Although fictional, The Day of the Jackal has a very credible and chilling scenario, quite appropriate in a decade that saw the worldwide rise of violent terrorism, such as the incident at the Munich Olympics, the Entebbe raid, and the assassination of Lord Mountbatten.  The bare bones DVD release, has been around for 15 years, and this film is an excellent candidate for a Bluray upgrade.

Frederick Forsyth would successfully continue his writing career, with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Odessa-File/dp/B0074B2N58/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Odessa File</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dogs-of-War/dp/B00005O06P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dogs of War</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fourth-Protocol/dp/B004OB2EYQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fourth Protocol</a>, being among his novels which were made into films.",1379203200,,2870,6.106965174129353

Seeing it again after many years I find that it has held up well. I love the James Bond series for what it is, fantasy, but this movie has a much more real-to-life feel.

The only thing not real-to-life are the 'kill' scenes. For example, when the Jackal kills someone with his bare hands,which he does several time in the movie, the victims go very quietly and very quickly. This is most likely a deference to the sensitivities of the day.

That part of the movie is a non-starter, because we know how that plot thread turns out.  The real story is the assination plot and the evolution of the assassin.  He's the hired gun at the beginning, and as the authorities (British and mainly French) begin to get clues and put the pieces of the hit-for-hire puzzle together, the hunter becomes the hunted.  The real thrill is how the government officials assemble the details and how the hit man (Edward Fox's sublimely cool character) himself becomes the target for a hit.  The evolution from one end of thriller to the other is flawlessly executed and bears repeated viewing, if for no other reason than you get the sense of the world closing in on The Jackal and his increasingly elaborate, though thought out beforehand, attempts at evasion.",1368230400,,971,4.583815028901734

No movie music, it relies on carefully prepped shots and dramatic tension.  I would rewind the Jackal about 10 mins to remind the students the following day of what they had seen previously.  Look for the background apprearance of calendars and clocks to show you the passage of time.  It is great for French 1's since it shows the Elyesee Palace, Paris street scenes, border crossings, airports, both in the UK and the continent, plus the staging of the 14th of July parade in Paris.

The original film was a full night's entertainment at the movies, and was shown in two parts with an interval between them.

But in the much abridged DVD version, many important scenes have either been left out entirely, or have been so cut as to be meaningless. For example, the scene in the hotel when the Jackal, on his way to his first meeting with the OAS conspirators, tumbles to the presence of their ""gorilla"" behind a curtin in the lobby, goes straight back out and phones them, telling them to get rid of the Gorilla immediately. Important character development: cut right out.

And so on, and so on.

I got one DVD and feel cheated. I would have preferred to pay whatever (cost to Universal < A$0.50 ) for the extra DVD and got the whole thing. I would be ashamed to play this disappointing cut down UNIVERSAL PICTURES (UK) DVD to any of my friends.

49074,5,0783226853,"The Day of the Jackal, starring British actor Edward Fox as The Jackal, a hired assassin, was directed masterfully by Fred Zinnemann, who also directed A Man For All Seasons.  In the 1950s and through the very early 1960s, France was experiencing terrorism as a result of Algeria's quest for independence.  President Charles De Gaulle favored its independence but there was a conservative military group within France, the OAS,  that did not want this. This fictional account describes in great detail the efforts of the group to kill De Gaulle.  They hired a very lethal individual, known as The Jackal, to plot and succeed in eliminating De Gaulle.  Most of the movie concerns the Jackal's careful, painstaking, plan to accomplish the task.  Unknown to him, a very smart, mild-mannered, unassuming French inspector, Lebel, is investigating the case on intelligence that an attempt would be made on De Gaulle.  The Jackal is an extraordinarily cunning individual who is capable of very convincing disguises.  He is almost impossible to detect.  Yet, humble Lebel is not a fool.  He's not inspector Clouseau and he pursues the case relentlessly and with understated courage until the Jackal is identified as he comes very close to accomplishing his objective.  In the end, the Jackal meets his date with an unmarked grave.  No one ever knew his actual identity.

The cinematography in this film is almost stunning.  The European locations, especially Paris, are beautifully filmed and the color is gorgeous but also realistic.  This is an interesting and suspenseful movie with an excellent script.  Althought it was released in 1973 at a time in which crude language was becoming increasingly prevalent in filmdom, there is no use of it here, which is refreshing compared to today's idea of what acceptable script writing requires.",1360540800,,1832,5.138513513513513

The subtle details and richness of the book make the movie come alive in a way it doesn't if you haven't read the book.  I cannot recommend both highly enough.

49080,5,0783226853,"A suberb adaptation of the Forsythe novel of the same name.  Set in the France of DeGaulle during its troubles with the OAS (a terrorist splinter group of the French Army who resisted France's withdrawal from Algeria), it follows the OAS's attempts to assassinate DeGaulle.  The character played by Fox is both charming and utterly ruthless.  His casual way of killing with a completely calm demeanor is chilling while also strangely compelling to watch.  He is the complete professional, totally without scruples.  Against him are the assembled power and might of the entire French security apparatus, and one rather modest (and somewhat henpecked) Inspector Lebel.  These two disparate characters, the sauve, handsome, professional assassin, and the mild, stodgy, policeman with an excellent mind.  A very unlikely pairing of foes.  The film follows the assassin in his preparations, while Lebel, with the assistance of Police forces around the world, try to find a starting point.  The intrigue behind the scenes builds as the security of France is infiltrated.  The cat and mouse game is deadly for those that get in the way.  You wonder who is the cat and who the mice.  It seems the cat is being pursued by the mice.  The film builds to a climax as the immense man-hunt is unsuccessful and the appointed moment in destiny approaches.  Truly a great, suspenseful film, that will keep you fascinated until the last scene.",1357689600,,1425,5.034188034188034

49082,5,0783226853,"In the past decade Hollywood has gone overboard with the movies about manhunts for that gifted hitman or wanted criminal.  Most of these focus on gadgets, car chases, street chases and fight scenes that make Jackie Chan look like a white belt.  Unfortunately, this trend has left the mystery and suspense out, leaving the movies as action movies.  Go back several decades and we have some great manhunt movies, with this film being one of the best.  Based loosely around the real life events in France during the Cold War, ""The Day of the Jackal"" looks at the Europe-wide manhunt for a contract killer set to kill French leader Charles de Gaulle.  The movie begins with a narration of the historical context; which is the disgust of some French military veterans over the de Gaulle's decision to give Algeria its independence.  The film then shows a botched assassination attempt, followed by the capture and execution of the plot's leader.  The latter is part of the OAS, the organization opposing Algerian independence.  Then we get to the meat of the movie, which follows a contract killer hired by the OAS as he concocts a plan to kill his target.  Opposing him are the police and intelligence forces of France and the UK.  The movie itself is built on minimal but effective action.  Instead, the movie plays out as a chess game, which each side trying to outsmart the other.  The acting is fairly good given that the cast is made of mostly unknowns.  The cinematography is good, giving the audience glimpses of Europe's beauty.  All in all, a great movie.",1357516800,,1560,4.75092936802974

There is efficiency to the storytelling that respects the audience by demanding the application of its intelligence. A detail worth mentioning is that the the director had the courage to use shoulder-mounted cameras before ""Steady-Cam"". This is intelligent film-making on par with Stanley Kubrik's.

49094,3,0783226853,"I think I am the one person that liked ""The Jackal"" better than ""The Day Of The Jackal"".  I preferred the shamelessly bombast that Zinnemann not so wisely avoided.  You see, what Zinnemann avoided was all the fast paced fun of Hollywood.  I was not board with The Jackal Starring Bruce Willis, Richard Gere, Sidney Poitier, the brought the move to life for me.  However, I guess it's all about taste!  Maybe...I don't have any.  But, Zinnemann bored me.

Revue from Amazon: ""The Day Of The Jackal"" With its high-intensity plot about an attempt to assassinate French President Charles de Gaulle, the bestselling novel by Frederick Forsyth was a prime candidate for screen adaptation. Director Fred Zinnemann brought his veteran skills to bear on what has become a timeless classic of screen suspense. Not to be confused with the later remake The Jackal starring Bruce Willis (which shamelessly embraced all the bombast that Zinnemann so wisely avoided), this 1973 thriller opts for lethal elegance and low-key tenacity in the form of the Jackal, the suave assassin played with consummate British coolness by Edward Fox. He's a killer of the highest order, a master of disguise and international elusiveness, and this riveting film follows his path to de Gaulle with an intense, straightforward documentary style. Perhaps one of the last great films from a bygone age of pure, down-to-basics suspense (and a kind of debonair European alternative to the American grittiness of The French Connection),",1353283200,,1497,5.110655737704918

49099,5,0783226853,"1973's ""The Day of the Jackal"" is a thrilling adaptation of Frederick Forsythe's novel of the same name.  Loosely based on events in France in 1963 at the end of the Algerian Civil War, including an attempt by a rogue Army organization to kill French President Charles de Gualle, the novel and the movie portray the careful planning and ruthless execution of an assassination plot by a meticulous and mysterious hired killer, code-named ""the Jackal.""  Played with understated skill by veteran British actor Edward Fox, the Jackal will lead the secret services and police of two countries on a long chase to a fateful date in Paris.

As the movie begins, the rogue OAS has been forced into hiding by an efficient French program of suppression.  The surviving leaders decide to hire an outside assassin to take out de Gaulle.  Their choice, an Englishman, asks only for an inside information source (and a significant pay-off).  For the rest of the mission, he will rely on his own skills and cunning.  Much of the interest of the movie is in watching the Jackel stay one step ahead of the pursuing police and security services led by one Claude Lebel, a French policeman (and well-played by Michael Lonsdale).  As the clock ticks down and the assassin works his way toward Paris, the suspense becomes almost unbearable.  Even a short aftermath will only add to the mystery of the outcome...

""The Day of the Jackel"" is very highly recommended to fans of good movie drama, especially those who were less than satisfied with the 1997 adaptation, which had almost nothing to do with the original novel or this movie.",1345420800,,1612,4.807971014492754

Extremists, (ex-military) decide to try to reverse the situation with the only viable plan possible, hire a foreign born contract killer, the ""chacal"".
On so many levels, the movie is great entertainment: the unfolding of the plot with almost journalistic detail, the characters involved, the pace of action, the scenery. My favorite is , of course the jackal, played by the English actor, Edward Fox. And Cyril Cusack's portrayal of the armorer is pure perfection. No one lets the viewer down. Even the automobiles used are great viewing, i.e. the Alfa Romeo and the Citroens.

However, I couldn't help but be distracted by the fact that all of the French characters spoke English with British or American accents, though I suppose that is to be expected from a Hollywood film.

49114,5,0783226853,This is simply a great adventure film. It possesses a simple story. The French government slowly learns of a plot against the President and want to capture the killer but they simply know his code name and he possesses fair hair. Who is he? So they unload the job onto their best detective. This story moved at a rapid pace. There are multiple story lines but they simply serve the main storyline. The French assume that somebody must have noticed him and contact several different countries but it's a British inspector who's inspired to contact a colleague in the Foreign Office. If he's operating out of Britain then he must be squeaky clean here but the foreign office must be keeping watch on these people. Now this storyline feeds the main one. It's retired later in the film when the Jackal has crossed the border and it becomes a French operation. A film with so many characters and storylines seldom succeeds but nobody really carries this film. There are very few long scenes which test an performer's capabilities. Instead the entire cast provides the film with enormous support. Everybody is assingned a job and everybody does it well. This film just doesn't rely on 'star' power.

Edward Fox is suave as The Jackal. In my opinion, the best proof of his total dedication to the job is his willingness to sleep with both men and women to attain entry or elude authorities. Michael Lonsdale as the detective is just as good as the overworked and underappreciated detective. It's frustrating that these two excellent actors did relatively few mainstream American films. Eagle-eye viewers might notice a young(er) Edward Hardwicke at the end. Doesn't quite look like Dr. Watson without the mustache!

49121,5,0783226853,"""The Day of the Jackal"" (1973) is a parallel procedural in which we follow an assassin and his police pursuers through all sorts of moves and counter-moves. President Charles De Gaulle gave independence to Algeria from France, and a group of retired army officers (the OAS) vowed to kill him. After a failed attack on his limousine, the plotters hire a British contract killer, a superb marksman, code named Jackal, brilliantly played by Edward Fox. He is a meticulous and clever planner, a tactician, who hires a forger to fake documents and an armorer to design a special sniper rifle that can be assembled from small sections and easily concealed. (Watch for what Fox does to a watermelon.) All the steps of his preparation for his assassination are documented, using guile and disguises, and along the way he has to dispatch people who get in his way.
 The French investigation unit led by the unassuming but sharp-witted plodder Lebel (Michael Lonsdale) enlist the aid of Scotland Yard to track down the identity of the Jackal. Lebel's assistant is Caron (Derek Jacobi) who resembles Fox. Suspense is built up as the Jackal barely manages to stay one step ahead of the cops. He's a flashy dresser and sports an ascot. There's a James Bond quality to him.
 It's a movie that engrosses the viewer, with a clever, complex plot, well acted, and beautifully photographed with great shots of European sites. The preparations and parading on French Liberation Day around the Arch of Triumph intensify the suspense build-up.",1251676800,6,1521,4.9375

49123,5,0783226853,"This film is a superb interpretation of the great Frederick Forsyth novel based on the assasination attempt on Charles De Gaulle.
Apply all the hyperpole here; riveting, gripping, tense, suspenseful. The pace is so smooth as we follow every move of the hired assassin as he prepares each detail in his preparation for the final coup.
Edward Fox is brilliantly lethal in the role of the assassin. He portrays the cool professionalism of the assassin so well, we are one with him in his determination to succeed. As in Forsyth's book, the film recreates the fascinating role of the assassin as he pursues his deadly aim, step by step.
This movie is unique in it's intense focus on the story, and it's lack of film-ish-ness, so our suspension of disbelief is complete from beginning to end.

It has all the elements of a great spy/drama movie.  Believable plot, great acting, tons of cliff hangers, and near misses.

You really begin to believe he will pull it all off (Assassination of Charles de Gaulle President of France), and actually want him to as the police and intelligence agents close in on him.  The story line is so plausible that you believe this could be a retelling of actual events.  None of the far fetched stuff you might find in some of the earlier James Bond Movies.  All the gadgets, weapons, methods, disguises are very period and what you'd expect  a contract killer of the 1960's would have available to him.

I'm kind of surprised it was rated PG.  They showed a number of bare buttocks and some breasts. All the killing is ""tasteful"".

Although I'm normally very good at separating novel from the film adaptation in my reviews I'm not sure how I can in this case. The movie is pretty faithful to book. The book a top 3 in its genre all time must be read by genre lovers. The film does its best to stress the detailed competency and professionalism of both the Jackal and Head Investigator Lebel (although the Jackal is represented better in the film than the inspector is) but somewhat fails.

I rate this film 4 stars not so much because it is a 4 star movie, but because the lack of quality ones in the genre. Problems: its sometimes clumsy editing, and the lack of actor's Edward Fox (as the Jackal) ability to shift his accent (English all the way through). I couldn't believe that he was none of the nationalities he feinted (the book doesn't make this mistake). Pick an actor that can play the part entirely, I ask as a viewer. For this very reason I reuse to watch another Tom Cruise movie where he is other than an American character. Also the tension of Lebel with the govt. committee he reports to is not portrayed well at all! You barely get the sense of urgency and desperation in the old men at the table; or the tact, internal personal/professional pressure of Inspector Lebel. Highlights: 2 red heads w/frontal nudity, and the lack of gratuitous blood and violence (which happens off scene).

Hate to say it but if you want it right, read the book....also the ending scene is 1000 times more suspenseful in the text.",1240444800,3,1714,4.576547231270358

49130,4,0783226853,"This is a mostly terrific film with, IMO, some awful moments of acting/scripting/directing.  It is one of my most-watched DVDs, but I am so annoyed at its handful of clumsy moments that I just can not give it five stars.  I also really dislike the strutting, bantam-rooster style of star Edward Fox.  I find him unconvincing and a little ridiculous in a lot of his dialogue.  The film survives this because it is basically a lonely-hunter scenario in which Fox's deficiencies are not continuously on display.

The film is niftily embedded in a real and fascinating historical moment to which it is very true.  In fact, the remarkable, long, dialog-free opening sequence, which is a re-enactment of a real attempt on De Gaulle's life, is brilliant film-making for which Fred Zinnemann deserves high praise.  And he was wise to stick close to the Forsyth novel, which is superb.  Even though I will give him some hard shots in a moment, this film is remarkable for telling so much of this story cinematically and so thoroughly entertaining us while doing so.  It is classic in its tautness, the steady build-up of tension, and the exciting climax.

OTOH, there are moments of Fox's acting and dialog that are nothing short of embarrassing.  His cocky personality and his joking about De Gaulle's security in his initial meeting with the OAS, were ridiculous.  A little later, we need to know that the OAS has deposited the agreed-upon payment in the Jackal's Swiss bank account.  Zinnemann has Fox shout into a telephone, ""Hello Zurich...the money's been deposited?""  The words on a webpage can not possibly do justice to how clumsy this moment is on the screen.  And then we have Zinnemann needing to let us know that the Jackal has been working on his plan so we see Fox write three bullet points on a pad of paper -- ""When / Where / How,"" or something on that order.  Then Fox rubs his eyes with great weariness and switches off his light.  It would have been more artful if a placard had just appeared like in the silent movies and said, ""The Jackal makes his plan.""  Later, the Jackal chats up a woman in an inn.  Let's just say he ain't no Sean Connery.  Apparently, many people loved Fox's performance.  Go figure.

But criticisms notwithstanding, I watch this film over and over again.  It is much too terrific a film to be ruined for me by a few moments where I wince.",1238889600,3,2375,4.642685851318944

Movie buffs know the movie but, sadly, it doesn't get the sort of mainstream recognition of even a mediocre thriller like The Fugitive for instance.

What's fantastic about Jackal is that it works within the realm of possibility.  The Jackal, a British contract killer hired by the OAS to assassinate Charles De Gaulle, is cunning, effective, sharp, but human; not the near super-human killers of movies of the last 20 or so years.

The drama builds and never relents.  This is an extraordinary feat considering that the assassin's target is a real historical figure who was never assassinated.

All the main characters were terrifically portrayed.  If there is a shortfall, it is that the French characters have British accents.  This detracted a bit from the realism.  It's a minor criticism, one that is all but swallowed by the strengths of the movie.

49169,5,0783226853,"The true success of this film rests in the realistic and unassuming characters of the ""Jackal"" and the French police commissioner, Lebel, who is charged with catching him.

Edward Fox plays the Jackal, and he is a perfect choice.  Standing at only about 5'9"" tall with an average build, he doesn't fit today's Hollywood profile of an assassin...and that is why he fits the bill so well.  When he first appears in the film, the first reaction of the audience is, ""is that him?!?""  At first, we aren't impressed.  When we start to see the intelligence behind the man, we become even more convinced, not only of the believability of him being an assassin, but also of how cold, calculating, and dangerous he is.  Fox makes the Jackal appear like anyone we'd run into on the street, and not give him a second glance which obviously makes him a perfect assassin.

Michael Lonsdale plays the role of Commissioner Lebel whose sole job is to track down and catch the Jackal.  He is also, largely, unimpressive from a physical stand-point.  He looks like most of the policemen and detectives that you'd find in your local town.  And yet, he is also as formidable in deductive reasoning and intelligence as his adversary.

One of the beauties of this film is that it never gets too caught up in the drama.  Rather, it allows the viewer to appreciate and even admire the simple game of cat and mouse; of watching to see if Lebel will succeed in catching the Jackal.  The two never even meet each other until the end.  There is no hatred, anger, or any other motivation except for the jobs of the two men: the Jackal's attempt to kill French President Charles De Gaulle and Lebel's job in catching him.  It also allows us to appreciate the intelligence of the characters.  This remains true even through the inevitable climax.  There isn't twenty minute duel or elaborate shootout.  It ends simply, the way it should.  More and more storywriters are understanding that the intrigue is in the journey and not the climax.

Lebel states early on in the film about the Jackal, ""don't count on this man making too many errors.  He's not the type.""  This line is aimed not only toward his assistant in the story, but to the audience as well.  That line rings true as you watch and realize that the Jackal, indeed, makes very few mistakes.  In the end, it's almost sheer bad luck that does him in.

There are several times when Lebel seems close to catching the Jackal, but he's always just a step behind him.

This is, quite simply, one of the best films ever made about the ""cat and mouse chase;"" of a policeman trying to catch an assassin.  Every detail is there for a reason.  There are several scenes that may initially have you scratching your head and wondering why it's there at all, but later on, it pays off.

I didn't even waste my time with ""The Jackal,"" the supposed remake.  I knew that there was no way it could come close to topping the original.  Some works of art are so grand, and yet, usually so simple, that they can't be duplicated.  The Day of the Jackal is one of those films.",1165276800,3,3081,4.52536231884058

Actors are good, the story is entertaining, sex and corpses are very much there but non-invading, but in my view the main interest of the movie nowadays is to show how much the world has changed since the late 1960's: communications were limited, everything was much slower, technology was primitive, people were more stylish and formal than today.

49178,5,0783226853,"Someone in the above reviews quipped, 'why don't they make movies like this anymore?' Good question. I guess because they're (today's producers) money driven and willing to pander to the more base instincts of youthful moviegoers in order to achieve just one more week at the box office.

This is one of the best movies ever made. It is plot driven, closely sticking to the Forsyth book, and although it's about the French which probably wouldn't get as much play today, it soon gets you to the edge of your seat and rivets you there.

DeGaulle for many reasons but especially for his politics in Algiers, has numerous attempts on his life. Remeber that in those post World War times, support of the Army was critical. The role of the Army in America probably came to an end in terms of its influential power when President Truman spanked General MacArthur in front of the entire class. In the real world, DeGaulle was an odd fellow, somewaht heroic, somewhat of an isolationist. The OAS, the French Army terrorist cell hires Edward Fox (who looks strangely like David Bowie, doesn't he?) as the suave, well dressed, cold blooded killer to assassinate DeGaulle.

Police procedural, scenic, Fox staying ahead of the police step by step, murder, rapid but contiguous scene changes. Just great stuff with great acting by then unknowns, several of whom didn't act again.

Filmed on location in Europe, the story follows a French terrorist organization's (the OAS) plot to assassinate Charles DeGaulle following the French pullout from Algeria. The OAS had been dealt quite a blow following a previous attempt on DeGaulle's life and now its only option is to hire an international assassin played by Edward Fox.

The storyline and the subtle ways the director shows the passage of time are marvelous. Edward Fox truley shows how cold and ruthless the Jackal is, and the methods he would go to get his ends.

49196,5,0783226853,"There's hardly any spare flesh on The Jackal. Ars est celare artem --- the art is to hide the artistry. This is a rattling good yarn, superbly told, no messing; and there's infinitely more art in it than in any of those flicks that scream ART at you. Suspense is not a matter of not knowing the outcome, but in watching the net tighten, and waiting to see just how close the Jackal can get to his target. The structure is V shaped: a very wide gap to start with, growing narrower by the hour, until the two tracks finally converge to a point: a bullet-point. The direction has a lot in common with Zinnemann's other masterpiece, High Noon, where, in effect, we are also assured of the outcome. In HN the ticking clocks are prominent, in DOTJ there are more of them, but they're not so obvious. In one film it's the good man against the rest; in the other it's the bad man against the rest. Where I come from, we root for the underdog, regardless. Why did the Jackal fail, and what was his tragic flaw? Ice-cold as he may have seemed, he got emotional. The key moment comes just after he's told his cover is blown. He can either pull away, and turn off back to Italy, when the roads fork, and wait for another day. Or he can carry on to Paris. He lets emotion get the upper hand, and carries on to Paris, which is not the sensible decision for a wise percentage player.

After watching the action repeatedly, a number of blips in continuity become apparent, and several of these are noted elsewhere. There seem to be quite a number of cuts. Like, maybe he did kill Cusack after taking delivery of the custom-tailored gun. This would have eroded viewer sympathy too drastically and too early, whereas nobody gives a damn for the slimy, blackmailing photographer. How did the Jackal suddenly produce a spray-gun filled with blue paint? What happened to the barking Alsatian dog, after the car crash? Does it matter? Less is more, and explanations can be sacrificed for the sake of the pacing. Zinnemann has this great sense of what will work, what is necessary and what isn't, and how to be economical and cost-effective. I could go on. This is a film review, not a book review, which is something entirely different.",1133136000,3,2214,4.493796526054591
49197,5,0783226853,"An extremely intelligent thriller that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats all throughout, this classic from Hollywood veteran Fred Zinnemann works wonderfully well despite the fact that its outcome is known from the very beginning.

After all, everyone knows French President Charles de Gaulle wasn't assassinated. The trick, then, is the careful manner in which Zinnemann unfolds the tale of an attempt to assassinate the legendary politician, taking his audience on a breathless ride across scenic locales in Europe, including Genoa, Vienna and the etherally beautiful city of Paris.

I am writing this review after viewing the movie for the umpteenth time, and I just realised that it grows better with each viewing.

Forsaking explosive action for an intelligent pacing and clever script that sticks closely to Frederick Forsyth's bestselling novel (in my humble opinion, one of the strongest points about this movie), Zinnemann uses a cast of solid British and French actors as he brings to the screen, almost in a documentary fashion, the race by police across Europe to nab the canny and suave hitman Jackal (Edward Fox).

Juxtaposed with this is the Jackal's devious and meticulous preparations for the hit. Zinnemann's ability to get under the skin of his characters is one of the film's many strengths, and the film's documentary style has often been emulated, but never as successfully.

The gorgeous cinematography and sound design are two of the other strengths of this film, but they aren't very well served by the non-anamorphic video and standard two channel Dolby soundtrack of the DVD. There is, however, an excellent text supplement documenting the making of the film. It presents many worthy tidbits, such as the surprising fact that ""The Day Of The Jackal"" marked Zinnemann's return to the screen after a rather long hiatus.

They just don't make films like this any more. This one is definitely a keeper.",1127692800,3,1932,5.1369426751592355

Then there is the cop, Alan Badel, a wonderful French actor whom many might recognize in the states; he is homely, yet just as focused and professional as the assassin.  They play a cat and mouse game, where some luck is involved but mostly technique and inspired intuition.

However, it has been of interest to me to know how a person can create a false identity.  It's even more interesting in these days of identity theft although the current methods are much more high tech than in the 1960's.  I mention this because ""The Day of the Jackal"" does a masterful job of show how a criminal with evil intent is able to integrate himself into a country without being detected.  This too is a timely message after the lessons of 9/11.  All this from a movie that came out in 1973.

""The Day of the Jackal"" is the story of an attempt to assasinate Charles DeGaulle by right-wing military and political Frenchmen.  Edward Fox is the man hired to do the job and the movie follows his steps from the beginning to the end and all points in between.  We see a cold-blooded professional who knows his trade.  We follow his manipulation of individuals for his own benefit.  We see that nothing is sacred nor off limits to him in his quest; even to the point of adapting a different sexual orientation to keep going.  All of this is fascinatingly scripted, acted, photographed and directed in a fast-paced yet thorough suspense movie.

The acting is good but the movie's title character and most of the people involved intentionally down play their roles to bring out the sterile nature of a professional assasin and his accomplices and pursuers.  Emotional outbursts are not an asset to such a man.  This leaves one focussed more on the movie than the preformances and that is the way a good suspense movie should be remembered.

Now keep in mind, I haven't read the book, so I gathered this by reading other reviews.  Also, given the film is almost 2  hours long, I would think the story presented to be fairly inclusive with regards to the book.

Starring in the movie is Edward Fox (The Duellists, Force 10 from Navarone) and Terrence Alexander (The Vault of Horror).  By the way, am I the only one who thinks Alexander looks remarkably similar to the main bad guy in Moonraker (1979)?  I checked, and it's not...that character, named Higo Drax, and was played by Michael Lonsdale.  Also appearing is, well, a slew of mostly European actors I won't bother listing, not because they're not noteworthy, but there was just so dang many of them.  If you're really curious, you can look it up (What?  You expect me to do everything?)

The movie, described as a quasi-documentary, takes place in the early 60's, about the time the premier frog in chief President Gen. Charles De Gaulle relinquished France's control of Algeria to back its' native occupants.  This upset quite a few Frenchies, especially those who were either serving or were retired from the military at the time reasoning being that the war over that particular country was hard and costly, and now, the country that forced them to go fight is now ready to give it up, basically nullifying all the effort and sacrifices put forth to secure Algeria.  Some were so upset they formed a group called OAS, an underground resistance group whose sole intention seemed to be the assassination of De Gaulle for his perceived treasonous actions.  After about five failed attempts on De Gaulle's life (only one of which we actually get to see), the group decides it's time to bring in an outsider, as they seem to blame their failures on leaks and moles within their own group (the fact they were a bunch of lame duck, grabasstic, knuckleheads had nothing to do with it, I'm sure).  Based on their research, they finally narrow the field to one, highly experienced, foreign individual, code named The Jackal (I'd love to see his resume).  The Jackal's (Fox) demands are few, but very specific, and his price is high, as his reasoning is that this type of job is a career ender, based on the level of importance of the target.  The OAS agrees to the Jackal's terms, and thus begins his long and meticulous process of developing false identities, procuring a suitable weapon, and researching suitable locations where he may have access to his target.  The French authorities get wind of a new scheme by the OAS, but little else as the shroud of secrecy around the Jackal is very thick.  Given the difficulty of obtaining information through their regular channels, the French authorities put their best detective on the case (no, not Inspector Jacques Clouseau), played by Alexander.  His resources are nearly unlimited, but he must keep a tight lid on things as not to tip off the OAS and the Jackal what little information they have, which severely hamstrings the investigation.  Now it comes down to a race between a deadly, meticulous, calculating assassin intent on taking out his target and a smart, intuitive detective intent on stopping him.

I really enjoyed this lengthy film.  Zinnemann does a wonderful job showing both sides of the story, that of the assassin, and that of the authorities intent on stopping him, the two stories slowly converging to create a climatic conclusion.  The pacing may seem slow to some, but it serves well to examine many fine details regarding both the Jackal's preparations and planning, and also the French gooberment's exhaustive investigation which involves a number of gooberment agencies from different countries as the Jackal is a tricky sort, taking great, meticulous care to cover his tracks and keeping his identity hidden.  Also, it's worth the payoff as the last 20 or 30 minutes are really worth waiting for...I really liked how the Jackal was able to keep a few steps ahead of the authorities (with a little help), anticipating danger and making the appropriate compensating actions.  Along the way he had to dispose of certain elements (people), but it was only done as measured against perceived threats to his ultimate goal...he may be a cold, methodical murderer, but he's a professional cold, methodical murderer.  I also really liked the thoroughness of the investigation, based on tedious, deductive, involved work and not on conjecture pulled from someone's behind.  The detective work was presented as thorough, comprehensive, and intelligent.  Casting Edward Fox as the Jackal was really inspired (Michael Caine wanted the role), maintaining a sense of anonymity over the character, allowing for the focus to be more on the story rather than the celebrity status of an actor playing the character.  The use of locations, mostly in France, but also in England, Austria, and Italy, was wonderful, and added so much flavor and credibility to the story.  I love seeing places I've never been (but may like to go someday, but just to visit, not assassinate anyone).

The DVD offers a pretty good wide screen picture (1:85:1) and decent audio.  Special features include detailed production notes and a theatrical trailer.  All in all, a great adaptation, and a great film.  Avoid the 1997 remake with Bruce Willis and Richard Gere...I wish I had...

When Frederick Forsyth's 'The Day Of The Jackal' first hit the shelves, it became an instant classic. It reached such popularity that a movie was but a natural consequence. Movies have never faithfully reproduced the core essence of books simply because of the minute details only a book could offer. Try showcasing The Iliad in 3 hrs!

But the movie version of The Day of the Jackal far exceeded expectations. Not only does it stick to the original plot but also even to this day, it sets the benchmark for how spy thrillers should be.

If you haven't read Forsyth's epic yet, then let me clue you in.  General Charles De Gaulle was considered a hero amongst his men when he fought for the liberation of France from the Germans in WWII. After becoming France's President, the same hero was considered a 'betrayer' after granting Algeria independence. A clandestine group in the Army, calling itself the 'Secret Army Organization' or OAS for short, launches a series of assassination attempts on De Gaulle, only to see each one destroyed by the highly informed and efficient French Secret Service. After the capture of its key lieutenants and its presiding leader, things become desperate for the OAS. It's new leader in hiding, believes that a foreign assassin of exceptional caliber is the only means left to dethrone De Gaulle. The assassin is known only by his code as ""Jackal"". This way the entire security network would be crippled for want of the man's identity. If you don't have a name, you don't have a face. If you don't have face?.... you don't exist. You are untraceable.

The premise is simple enough. It is how the Jackal plans and executes his operation that takes the bulk of the movie. The Jackal is a man of perfection and his attention to detail is something to be seen. A slight lapse in secrecy by his employers alerts France to begin searching for him, though they have no idea who or what he is. The job of finding him and 'disposing' him off in total secrecy falls into the unwilling hands of a simple French Detective. It is how these two protagonists move forward at breakneck speed in achieving their goals that takes the movie to a truly riveting, thrilling finale.

Edward Fox as the Jackal is beyond doubt, the coldest, most ruthless assassin to date.  Fox is perfect for the role. His dull cowering gaze is chilling. From a staid English gentleman to a remorseless killer, Fox displays tremendous versatility and poise. Every action of his has a meaning and behind an immediate plan, he has a backup. Such is Fox's repertoire in impersonating as the Jackal. When I read the book, midway through it,  I was actually rooting for the assassin. I felt the same way when watching this movie though I knew the end. To my knowledge, very few actors have so far delivered such a convincing negative-role performance than Fox.

Michael Lonsdale as the quaint Detective Lebel is probably the most ""uncharacteristic"" hero in any movie. He isn't your be-all end-all savior, with hands of steel and body of a superman. He does not fit into a mould which you can distinguish as ""Okay, I know this kind of a guy..."" and that itself is a tribute to this superb actor. He displays coolness in equal measure to the Jackal and comes across as a shy and timid man. In short, he acts as, just a detective doing his duty. His character is one of intelligence, resourcefulness and humility on one side with a quiet steely determination and resolve on the other. And Lonsdale is magnificent in displaying all of these aspects.

Together these two protagonists take an already exciting thriller to an explosive finale that is hard to imitate.

The rest of the cast add a lot of depth and meaning to their respective roles and each character has a major part in pushing forward the story to its worthy conclusion.

In short, The Day of the Jackal is a masterpiece. Considering the movies we watch today, this is slow paced, but with reason. Cheap thrillers always show you how a character dies from the bullet of an assassin but never the preparation for doing so. The Day of the Jackal shows you just how the assassin comes to that point of success. From the assassin's meticulous planning to his ultimate execution of that fatal shot, the movie shares the same perfection. Director Fred Zinnemman has set the standards for future thrillers by foregoing flashiness and instead focusing on the core issues of the book. He remains loyal to it and displays a rare cinematic flair that is very hard to beat. And do not mistake this movie to the recently released ""The Jackal"" featuring Bruce Willis and Sydney Poitier. One movie is a disappointment while the other is a classic..........

Watch Fox and Lonsdale square off each other....

Further, this is very interesting to imagine the days when it was no internet, no (cheap, fast and powerful) computers to help the police. The police force just depended on their logical thinking and, of course, luck to find the Jackle.

We know you all love this terrific movie but there is a looming question that has bothered me for years.  I would appreciate any insight anyone can offer...

In the second meeting between the jackal and the gunsmith (Cusack), the jackal is reviewing Cusack's handiwork and admiring the gun.  Cusack then brings out the explosive bullets he has made.  In almost all available versions that I have seen, this scene ends with a close-up of the jackal's hands as he loads the gun.

THERE IS ANOTHER VERSION.  It is possible that I have completely lost my mind but I am convinced that I have seen a version of this scene wherein the jackal kills Cusack with the bullet he has just loaded.

This makes perfect sense in light of what we know of the jackal (that he would off any possible witnesses).  Am I nuts?  Has anyone else seen this version?  Where did it go?  Did the studio edit it for time?  (It couldn't be more than a few seconds.)  Did they edit it to make the jackal a more sympathetic character?  (C'mon!)

Anyone?  Anyone?

Thanks.",1095897600,4,1050,4.49468085106383
49236,5,0783226853,"It's worth watching Michael Caton-Jones 1997 remake with Bruce Willis just  to get a measure of just how good this is, just how easy it would be to make a routine, dull, forgettable film using the essentials of this plot. Routine, dull and forgettable is exactly what Caton-Jones and Willis deliver. What Zinnemann and Edward Fox deliver is one of the very classiest thrillers there is. It's a beautifully understated film, a quiet and deceptively slow-moving cat and mouse game in which Fox's mysterious super-assassin, the Jackal, is hired by the OAS to kill General de Gaulle. As he moves in on his target the authorities and in particular French Detective Lebel struggle frantically to stop him. The latter part of the story is a brilliantly compelling police procedural where we watch the combined forces of two countries, France and Britain, plod through endless tedious chores, ploughing through thousands of passport applications in search of a single dodgy one or through all the hotel registration books in greater Paris looking for people claiming to be Danish one of whom might be their man. Meanwhile Fox is superb as the Jackal - hateful though he clearly is, at least a part of one's brain is rooting for him through much of the movie, at least until the body count of those who have got in his way starts to mount up, just because he is a single individual pitted absolutely alone against the might of two states and everything their security apparatus can thrown at him. And so the story moves on through countless beautifully conceived details, the OAS spy who seduces a top official to keep tabs on the investigation, Delphine Seyrig and Anton Rogers as the people the Jackal seduces, best of all perhaps Cyril Cusack as the assiduously comme il faut gunsmith, calmly asking Fox, ""Will the gentleman be moving?"" as if he were a tailor making a suit. Finally we arrive at a climax that should be relatively free of suspense -  we all know after all that de Gaulee in fact retired peacefully in 1969 - but is in fact one of the most brilliantly tense climaxes of any thriller I know.",1095292800,11,2100,4.7349726775956285

49238,4,0783226853,"First of all, this film has no relation to the recent film titled 'The Jackal' starring Bruce Willis which is complete fiction and bad fiction at that.

Fred Zinnemann directed this 1973 film based on actual events involving the attempted assassination of French President Charles de Gaulle by the OAS in the 1960s.  A great suspense thriller where the audience is gripped by both the elusive assassin's stealth as well as the chief inspector's tenacity.

The film follows the real political events in France in the early 60s at the close of the Algerian War of Independence.  Faced with public outcry to end the war, President Charles DeGaulle seeks peace with the North African rogue colony of Algeria.  Ardently opposed to DeGaulle are many top military officers who've formed a an organization named the OAS (acronym for Secret Army Organization.)  The OAS prepared a coup to remove him from power: by assassination if necessary.  The conspirators enter into a contract with an elusive assassin known only as 'The Jackal'(Edward Fox) who will stop at nothing to get the job done.  Although French authorities are aware of the plot, they're equally ignorant as to the identity of the hired killer.  The task of finding the assassin in time falls upon an officer of the Surete (Michael Lonsdale: Drax in Moonraker) who's determined to protect the president.

The film is fast paced and brings the audience into the cat-and-mouse game almost immediately.  The film follows both the assassin and his pursuer until the climactic ending.  The film quality is good for its time and the audience is kept in suspense as to the assassin's methods and plans.  The gripping screenplay is brought to life by the great acting talents of the actors as well as a competent director.

Altogether a great political suspense thriller that is all the more convincing because its mostly true.  A great film to own or watch numerous times.",1092873600,5,1921,4.940809968847352

He is to kill President Charles de Gaulle, ""le Grand Charles"" himself, in Liberation Day, as we eventually find out--but not until much later in the film.

The killer goes through many personalities, disguises, and changes, and manages to kill a few innocents on the way to his final conquest.  He is unknown to the gendarme, who are on his trail early, with the help of an informer on the inside, but eventually his appearance becomes known to them--and even then, in spite of an alert commissioner of police in Paris who is every bit his match, Inspector Lebel (Michel Lonsdale)--he almost makes his kill.  Had he done so, of course history would have had to be re-written because of a movie, an unlikely event--so we knew that he would fail, but still the plot was so well played that the suspense was never lost.

Written by Frederick Forsyth and directed by Fred Zinneman, perhaps this film was predestined for greatness, but in any case it is one of the great ones.

You don't know how lucky you are to have missed the pure dreck of the remake -- rather, you've found your way to another masterpiece from the director who gave us ""High Noon"", and much more.  Think of it as having embarked on a snipe-hunt for junkyard trinkets but happily stumbling onto a real gem.  The DVD print is excellent, right down to conveying the subtley bleached effect that I recall from the original release, and the classic ""look"" and texture of the old Schneider Panavision lenses and European lighting -- all effects that heighten the movie's authenticity and mid-60's ambience.  This classic is a far cry from the phony, who-are-you-kidding cinematic comic books of today that try to emulate computer games for overgrown adolescents.  The writing, directing and acting are lean and direct, the visual style is spare, efficient, exceptionally effective.

49245,4,0783226853,"This movie/novel starts at a disdvantage: we all know that De Gaulle wasn't assassinated. So Frederick Forsyth does a fine job in creating the suspense that leads to the thrilling conclusion. The Jackal gets just one shot at De Gaulle, who unfortunately nods just at the wrong time. But along the way, in order to make the shot that hurtles unnoticed into a cobble stone, the Jackal has to kill at least four others who might give away his whereabouts to the police.
Zinneman constructs this movie as a two-strand plot: the Jackal, as he makes his preparations for the attempt, and the authorities,as they try to track him down. It emerges in the end that their original assumption -- that the Jackal was a particular Charles Calthrop -- was completely wrong. But that mistake aside, the combined French/English barely make a mistake in pursuing the correct figure.
Made in 1973, this movie lacks some of the big-budget feel that Speilberg subsequently brought to blockbusters. The most expensive element in the production was probably the crowd scenes in Paris, but you can see members of the crowd who clearly have rather longer hair than the supposed 1963 scenario would lead you to expect.
Another quirk of the DVD I bought: after the Jackal has murdered the wealthy French woman and is slipping out of the house, you can still see him standing outside his car while the ignition is being started. Jerkily, he is suddenly in the car, driving off. Clearly a couple of frames have been lost here, but the sound editing tries to make up for the visual discontinuity.
But all in all, this is a good film, a taut thriller that has you half-hoping the Jackal is successful in his objective. And it's extraordinary to see Derek Jacobi (who would star in I Claudius four years later), in such a minor role!",1075075200,2,1802,4.723809523809524

49267,5,0783226853,"Years before the U.S.'s controversial involvement in South Viet Nam, France struggled and eventually failed to sustain its own involvement in Algeria. Many of its senior officers felt betrayed by their government. Efforts to assassinate President De Gaulle failed. Frederick Forsyth had this in mind when writing the novel on which this film is based. At substantial cost, an assassin known only as ""The Jackal"" is retained by dissidents to succeed where others had failed. There are two separate but related plots: one focuses on the assassin's meticulous preparations; the other on Inspector Lebel's equally thorough efforts to identify, locate, and capture him. Of special interest to me is director Fred Zinnemann's decision to tell the story (as does Forsyth) in a straightforward manner, without any special effects or gratuitous violence. He presents Lebel (Michael Lonsdale) and The Jackal (Edward Fox) as highly skilled professionals. Each fully understands what he must do and how to do it. True, both receive assistance from others along the way but they nonetheless remain in complete control until their ultimate confrontation.

Although some have referred to this film as a ""political thriller,"" there is an almost total absence of politics within its narrative. Although his client has specified Charles DeGaulle, The Jackal would kill anyone for the right price. Moreover, there is absolutely no indication of Lebel having any political loyalties or even personal opinions. He is a public official doing his job, no matter who is in danger. For some, I guess, this film is a thriller. It certainly has a number of exciting moments but I, for one, never had any doubt that Lebel would eventually prevail. My interest is explained almost entirely by the seamless development of the two plots, each of which includes several especially well-portrayed incidents. For example, when Lebel confronts a high-level minister who has unknowingly provided The Jackal with privileged information and then later, when The Jackal penetrates security defenses to position himself so that he has a clear shot at his target.

But Edward really carved his chunk of attention for the role as the Jackal in the 1973 DAY OF THE JACKAL.
The film is a tight production, nearly boarding on documentary.  Edward portrays the meticulous hitman of many disguises who has been hired to assassinate Charles de Gaulle.

But you are in two minds, actually.  Fox is so winning in the performance, fleshing out the Jackal just not as a coldblooded killer, but as a man, so you oddly almost root for him to succeed, at the same time cheering for him to fail.

We had the impression they were filmed only in green and blue, the characters didn't speak much leaving to the audience the task to understand the plot by itself. You will feel this kind of atmosphere in this film with the difference that Zinnemann worked with a solid gold screenplay.
The final scene, the day of the jackal, is about 30 minutes long and is already part of Motion picture History.
A few problems with the images ; white spots, images standing still during 1 or 2 seconds. The sound is, in my opinion, the best we can expect from a 1973 movie.

The film is based on a novel by Frederick Forsyth whose books often reflect his earlier training as a journalist. Director Fred Zimmerman achieves almost the same effect with this movie which seems very much like a suspenseful documentary.
Edward Fox gives an excellent performance as the cold-blooded Jackal. Other members of the talented cast include Terence Alexander, Michel Auclair, Alan Badel, Tony Britton, Denis Carey and Adrian Cayla-Legrand.

We see how he covers his tracks; and how the authorities try to follow behind.  It's PG for (surprise) frontal female and rear male nudity, implied sexual situations, subdued violence.

49288,5,0783226853,"This superlative movie has all the classic ingredients of a real thriller, without all the non-stop action, sex and explosions which typifies today's examples of this genre. The Jackal provides a classy alternative.  The OAS were a group of rogue French Foreign Legioniers and other dissident military elements who were resentful of De Gaulle's pull-out from Algeria.  We must recall that Algeria was the spiritual home of the Legion since its formation in 1831.  Algeria was considered a part of metropolitan France, and held a status much higher than any other French colony.  Coming on the heels of France's recent defeats in Indo-china the thought of losing Algeria as well to Moslem-Communist infleuences was unacceptable to many in the French military.
The OAS conducted many assassinations both inside Algeria and France itself.  There were certainly many attempts to assassinate De Gaulle and it must be said that he had something of a charmed life.  It is known that the OAS contracted a British assassin from within the Legion most likely who was code named ""Jackal"".  He was given the paltry sum of 40,000 to make an assassination attempt on the French President.  It is not known for sure whether he made any attempts or not.  The book, upon which the movie is based takes the plot a step further and portrays a British assassin who is probably a lot more determined and competent than his historical counterpart was.  While fact is often mixed with fiction here, the way this movie does it is not as irksome as many films do it today.  The Jackal is believeable, and because we don't know for sure how far such attempts were made to get De Gaulle the plot tries to fill in the historical gaps.
France had recently gone through many turbulent years with recent humiliations from Nazi defeat in 1940, to Vichy colloboration, and to the loss of her colonies after the war which saw France reduced from premier status in the world.  Such violent changes are bound to leave their conflicting marks on the politics of any nation.  It is not surprising then that many in the French military wanted to reverse a series of steady defeats since 1940.  Holding on to Algeria at all costs seemed the only way to do this.  While the film does not go into the background politics which sets up the Jackal's scenario too much, we learn enough from the beginning of the movie to know why he has been hired to assassinate De Gaulle.  Would the world have been a worse place had the OAS and Jackal succeeded?  It's hard to say.  Despite what some French might say, De Gaulle was really not a major player in the developing Cold War, nor was France a pivital nation in Euroepan politics anymore either.  His death would certainly have hurt France's image even more, but its not likely it would have changed world politics that much.  So in the end what we have with The Jackal is some classic suspence, good acting by all the players, and a story that does not dumb itself down like so many action thrillers today do.  Jackal can be enjoyed without having to wince from excessive gore or violence.  It also depicts a period in recent history which was quite unstable for France.  Enjoy this movie, as they don't make them like this much anymore.  The DVD version seems to have a clear print and has some interesting production notes as well.",1041552000,6,3335,4.690721649484536
49289,5,0783226853,"The Day of the Jackal is a prime example of an increasingly rare breed -- a subtle, low-key action film that is actually willing to respect the intelligence of its audience.  (For evidence of how times have changed for the worse, just compare this film to its recent, star-driven remake.)  Edward Fox plays the Jackal, a coolly efficient English assassin who is hired by Algerian terrorists to assassinate French President Charles DeGaulle.  Using an almost documetary style, the film follows the Jackal as he prepares to kill DeGaulle while a French detective (Michael Lonsdale) fights against time to discover just who the Jackal actually is and stop him.  It is a sign of the story's effectiveness that, even though the majority of the audience will (hopefully) be aware that DeGaulle ended his service as France's President without being killed, the film still manages to hold the viewer's attention in a mixture of heart-pounding suspense and fascination with watching such a realistic presentation of how a political assassination might very well had been pulled off.  This isn't a short film but, clocking in at 2 and a half hours, it is never less than enthralling.
Director Fred Zinnemann wisely chose to eschew the trendy flashiness that was almost required of films made in the early '70s (and which has recently come back to marr so many contemporary action films) and instead emphasizes realism in both his action and his characters.  As a result, the Jackal and his pursuer never engage in the type of unbelievable acts that have become the trademarks of other action stars.  They are never more or less than recognizable human beings and that makes the film's story all the more enthralling.  Instead of filling the film with audience-pleasing pyrotechnics, Zinnemann instead uses violence so carefully and so rarely that when the action does explode on screen, it has an immediate impact.
Zinnemann was always known as a brilliant director of actors and the performances in The Day of the Jackal (from a collection of reliable English and French character actors) are flawless.  Though his character is usually overshadowed by the more charismatic Jackal, Lonsdale does a good job as the film's nominal ""hero,"" making this anonymous detective into a sort of everyman.  However, the film belongs to its title character and the actor who plays him, Edward Fox.  Fox has been typecast as stuffy, aristocratic types so it is a bit of a revelation to see his performance here.  He manages to perfectly convey the coldness of a man without a soul while, at the same time, providing glimpes of a neurotic intensity that would come from living a life that is centered totally and completely on death.  Fox creates a sympathetic screen villian without ever allowing the Jackal to become Lecterized -- the viewer never forget that this is a killer and not a warm and cuddly guy with a few eccentricities.
The Day of the Jackal is a film that seems to be perenially underrated.  Certainly, it runs counter to every instinct currently being displayed by the actions films coming out of Hollywood.  Which is unfortunate because the current crop of Michael Bays and Simon Wests could stand to learn quite a few lessons from Fred Zinnemann and the Day of the Jackal.",1036454400,12,3267,4.936131386861314

The film is nicely paced and, while it's not laden with special effects, it has no trouble holding your attention. It's a tribute to Forsyth, the screenplay, and the director that, even though you know that DeGaulle was never assasinated, the suspense continues to build throughout the film right up to the end.

Fans of director FRANCOIS TRUFFAUT will recognize MICHEL LONSDALE as the commissaire and in a supporting part PHILLIPE LEOTARD as a cop who informs the commissaire.

49294,5,0783226853,"This movie has some excellent acting, a wonderfully tight plot, and some brilliant casting, superb direction... I could go on.
The movie is an assasination plot. Sure, we've seen so many of these in today's age. But this one is different. It is a serious plot, and is truly brilliant in its casting and direction. The expression of Lebel as he realises that he has to work round the clock, the expressions of anxiety, pressure, tiredness, excitement... and the pace of the movie keeps one riveted to the seat even if one knows the entire story beforehand by reading the book.
The film's strongest character is Fox, who plays the assassin. Cool, calm and collected, he is focused and decisive. He is ruthless and charming. He is cunning and meticulous. Fox has a toothy smile and his perfectly combed hair and his perfect attire make him the consummate Englishman. A lot of this films' directorial style and screenplay seems to have inspired another classic - The Fourth Protocol, where the whole Cat-and-mouse game is replayed. Fox plays the perfect professional killer - cold, methodical, planned and unremorsefully and ruthlessly committed to his goal.
The Day of the Jackal is a silent and terse film. The screenplay and the direction seem to show the same sense of urgency and focus within the plot, that the characters display in their own objectives.

One cool way to watch the original back to back with the Richard Gere/Bruce Willis/Sidney Poitier flop.  The modern flop leaves you with kind of a ""Huh, what the heck was that?"" reaction.  For example, the scene where Willis blows away Jack Black's arm requires the same creativity as scraping ... matter from a shoe.

49316,5,0783226853,"This tremendously entertaining film has lost none of it's impact in nearly 30 years. Fred Zinnemann's adaptation of the Frederick Forsythe thriller is compulsive viewing for fans of political thrillers, espionage and deadly assassins. Loosely based on events surrounding the French involement in Algeria in the 1950's, Forsythe penned his novel in only a few weeks and it shot to the top of the best seller list immediately....and attracted the movie makers with it's dynamic plot and complex characters.
Edward Fox created one the best killers EVER bought to the screen...Fox's character is dashing, debonair, charming and a ruthless assassin who is innovative, driven and exceptionally cold blooded. Where as we have become sorely accustomed to seeing current day movie assassins as highly testosteroned gorillas toting machine guns and loaded with lethal gadgets, Fox's suave, intelligent liquidator is streets ahead of any of them in his murderous portrayal. Michel Lonsdale (in probably his best role) is the intrepid and wily French police inspector who is given the invidious task of finding a faceless man who is on a single minded mission to kill President Charles DeGaulle.
Zinnemann never lets the pace slow up from start to finish. His excellent direction of this deadly game of ""cat and mouse"" is inventive, taut and brillianty staged. A first rate support cast of predominantly lesser known actors lend a superb authenticity to the feel of the story (Loved Cyril Cusack as the Jackal's expert gunsmith).

There is probably no cooler killer in the movies than the Jackal but even more than that, this movie works because it slowly builds to a neat climax with a surprising twist.

No one knows his name, his nationality, or what he looks like.  How do you begin to stop such a killer?
Edward Fox plays the Jackal as a sophisticated, highly intelligent killer that does not make mistakes.  Watching him go through his job ""routine"" is amazing.  We feel like we are actually watching and learning his secrets of the trade.  On the other side, we see his adversary, every bit his equal:  the detective in charge of the investigation.  What makes the movie so fun to watch is the writing of these two characters.  The detective is just as good at his job as the Jackal is at his.  But will one of them make a crucial mistake, giving the advantage to the other?
""Day of the Jackal"" has so many outstanding qualities because it was made by one of the great masters of film, Fred Zinnemann.  This was Zinnemann's first film in seven years after a long line of great films.  Many consider this his best.

I wish the DVD had a few more extras.  Production notes are included, but audio commentary by Fox would have been a great addition.

Attention is paid to detail, and there is never anything that happens that struck me as contrived or unbelievable. Zinnemann took a slight risk by using little or no dialogue in some scenes, and having such a quick, abrupt ending, but these things work to the film's benefit. The entire movie is a tension filled story of how the Jackal prepares for his last, biggest, career-ending hit; the cops' ingenious methods of tracking him; and his equally ingenious ways of eluding them.  Fox studied hard for this role, and it pays off for the viewer:  he perfectly portrays the Jackal as an utterly uncaring, egocentric, extremely elusive and clever individual, as a person with this occupation would probably be. Lonsdale is just as fantastic; his character is always completely believable as a man who is continually stunned by the Jackal's elusiveness, yet he never gives up and doesn't show over- or underconfidence.

While  we all know what the climax must be, it is in doubt to the very last  instant.
As an added bonus, you can catch Derek Jacobi, in what must be  one of his earliest film roles, before his I, Claudius and Brother Cadfael  fame.
Highly recommended.  An all-time favourite!",966211200,2,712,4.9914529914529915
49340,2,0783226853,"There is a patince to the proceedongs of The Day of The Jackal that is wonderfful to watch. The film, like it should, starts slowly and build on layers of plot to an exciting trans-continental chase. Today most thrillers  would go for a cheap quick thrill like getting a character shot in the face  or having a limb blown off, but Zimmerman wisely avoids this preffering to  build on Phycological suspense. Alas, despite these qualites, the film has  dated terribly. All the charcters, regardless of nationality speak the same  language, and while I don't particularly care for realism in movies, I felt  it to be essential here. The acting is universally stiff and one sided. It  is understandable that Edward Fox should be constantly smiling, a sign of  villany in all modern films, but unlike say, the opening scenes of The  Crying Game there is no human intensity to the proceedings. Its all  calculated and cold. I understand why this film recieved raves on release,  but sadly it just doesn't measure up today. Having said that, I would  rather watch this film ten times in a row, with eyelids taped open  Clockwork Orange style than see ten minutes of the truly miserable Micheal  Caton Jones remake The Jackal.",952387200,7,1218,4.793269230769231
49341,5,0783226853,"I saw this movie when I was younger and every chance I get to see it again I do.  This movie deserves to be placed in the Top 100 list.  It is by far a better movie than the recent remake by Bruce and company.  The actor was  more believable as the assassin than Bruce.  During this movie, the creepy  feeling up the back of your neck when you saw this guy stayed with you.  Bruce generated an air of ""o.k.""  One can't help but compare the  two. Standing them side by side, they really don't compare because the  directors took different directions.  This is not a bad thing, but I prefer  the classic.",935020800,,602,4.184210526315789
49342,5,0783226853,"As an avid Frederick Forsyth fan I have collected all of the movies made of his novels.  ""The Day of the Jackal"" is by far the best adaptation. Take care of all your important duties before your sit down to watch this one.  You won't want to leave your seat. Excellent performances, particularly by Edward Fox and Michel Lonsdale, make this ""edge of your seat"" thriller totally believable. Those who lived through the tumultuous sixties will appreciate both the villians and heros in this fine film. Those who did not may learn a bit about our universal paranoia during this period of political and social upheaval. Enjoy and learn",933638400,,631,4.779816513761468
