In 1998 I conducted a  poll among Beauty and the Beast fans asking them to rate the 44 episodes of  the first two seasons on a 1-to-10 scale.  31 fans participated.  ""Fever"" finished 41st out of the 44 episodes.
I placed  ""Fever"" 43rd in my own personal 1-through-44 rank-ordering of the  44 episodes.",916531200,7,648,4.605263157894737
