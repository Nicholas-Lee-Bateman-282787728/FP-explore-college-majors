8174978,5,B000N57OL0,"What a great package.  Where else can you get 17 short films (and good ones!) of so many different genres, AND 2 hours of other features on one disc??  These films came from all over the world, including Hawaii and Japan!

Since the product description doesn't do it justice, here's the film list of those lucky enough to be included on this release:

-""In Zakk's Case"" - Dark Comedy - a man has 21 chances to survive a day that is trying to kill him

- ""21 Seconds"" - Mystery - a man's lover disappears in the blink of an eye

- ""Body of Work"" - Drama - an artist strives to create surreal sculptures

- ""Cotton"" - Experimental/Animation - explores a series of coincidences in the lives of a family

- ""Forgotten Melody"" - Science Fiction - two men steal an instrument in a world where music has been banned

- ""Funky Monkey"" - Dark Comedy - a roommate seeks revenge in an unusual way

- ""I Never Liked Mushrooms"" - Drama - a father attempts to reconcilliate with his estranged son

- ""Lucky Number 21"" - Crime - a hitman with a gambling problem owes money to a mob boss

- ""Nigel Woolcock's Travels in The Orient"" - Mockumentary - a hilariously inaccurate tour of Japan

- ""One Over"" - Comedy - a checkout clerk makes his customers' lives miserable

- ""Red Seven"" - Drama - two lovers reluctantly join their friend in a gambling scheme that quickly backfires

- ""Second Sight"" - Comedy - a man wakes to find he has precognative abilities

- ""Thanksgiving"" - Horror - a murderer stalks a group of friends over Thanksgiving dinner with grotesque results

- ""The 21st Element"" - Comedy - a group of friends tries to protect the rare element Scandium from terrorists

- ""A Permanent Change"" - Drama - an ex-soldier attempts to influence the wicked ways of his depraved roommate

- ""Balance"" - Drama - a man is forced to satisfy the balance between good and evil

- ""Gypsies"" - Comedy/Animation - a missing baby leads to untold carnage for this hapless husband

ALL these films are winners, and the DVD is MORE than worth the price of admission!  If you didn't get to see them in the theater last January, make sure you check this out!  It even includes a cool dumentary on the whole festival and a bunch of deleted scenes and director's cuts!",1179446400,,2240,4.422982885085575
8174979,5,B000N57OL0,"Let me start off and by saying that I had heard about a horror movie that was being made for some film festival. A friend of mine goes to Temple University in Philadelphia.  He went to the ProjectTwentyOne film fest and when he got back to the dorm he was like DUDE YOU GOTTA GO SEE THIS CRAZY HORROR FILM THAT WAS AT THE FEST!  I was like cool, I like horror movies!  So the next day we BOTH went with some others from our dorm.  Let me say this..  Thanksgiving, which is a short film, not a full length feature, started out slow, I didn't know what the hell it was about it looked like a home movie of some people having a feast!  Then someone knocks at the door and the mood changes.  You now know something is up with this guy that comes into the picture.  Without giving too much away, I will say this. I will NEVER, EVER look at the thanksgiving holiday the same way again!  If you like movies like Hostel or Turistas, this is for you!!!  I will also say, everytime I look at a cheesegrater I cringe in fear!!!  I saw an interview by the filmmakers of this film and they said they were in production of a full feature version of this movie! I CANT WAIT!!!!  Well enough about that short film.  There are a bunch of short films on there as well.  Even though I bought this dvd for teh thanksgiving horror movie, I was surprised to see some other AWESOME movies on this dvd.  There is a urban crime movie that is AWESOME!  Anyway, this dvd is WELL WORTH IT!  25.00 for alot of cool films....

I enjoyed it!  But thats me!

Peace!",1170547200,2,1533,4.149659863945578
