8318060,2,B001LGXIGA,"""Imps*"" was filmed in the 1980s but was never released until now. After seeing the movie I can see why it wasn't released sooner: It just isn't very funny. It's not a conventional movie with a story but a sketch comedy like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kentucky-Fried-Movie/dp/6305840083/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kentucky Fried Movie</a>. Unfortunately, most of the sketches just aren't funny at all. As a comedy, it's not recommended. So what about its other asset, the cast? The movie has lots of famous actors in it, from then-unknown Jennifer Tilly to veterans like John Carradine and Keenan Wynn, but most of them only appear for a couple of seconds, delivering a line or two. So it's also not worth watching for the cast alone. In conclusion, not a movie worth wasting money on.",1230854400,2,832,5.559055118110236
