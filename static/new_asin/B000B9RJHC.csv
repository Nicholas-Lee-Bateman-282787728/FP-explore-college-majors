Still, I very much enjoyed it not only to see my friend who has since passed away, but also because it was shot in my hometown so there are a lot of familiar locations that give me a rush of satisfaction every time I see them.  This film was made for practically nothing and I give the director a lot of credit.  Instead of having very tacky horror effects that he couldn't afford anyway, he does a decent job of evoking the scares through power of suggestion.  That alone makes this pretty unique for a film of this type.  I understand it's selling well in England, doubt anyone here in the U.S. knows about it.  You have to really love this genre to appreciate this film but I do feel it probably serves as a good example to film students as to what can be done with almost nothing.",1357516800,,903,4.1022727272727275
