2590465,5,B000FUOUEM,"Our weekly Bible Study group supplemented our study of the 'Life of Christ in Stereo' with a chapter or two of the John DVD at the start of each study. We will be doing the same with the Matthew and Acts DVD's starting in the fall. Because of the quality of acting and realistic scenes on the John DVD the group really was able to ""get the picture"" and the studies blossomed as a result. I personally feel this is one of the best study tools we have ever used because it is word for word what is in God's Bible.",1307750400,2,511,4.069306930693069
2590466,5,B000FUOUEM,"THESE VIDEOS ARE A BLESSING IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR VISUAL GOSPEL AND ACTS, WELL DONE AND JUST AS PROMISED...",1307404800,6,108,4.45
2590467,5,B000FUOUEM,The movies are good because they follow the bible word for word.  Nothing is added.  That's what I like about them,1303948800,14,114,4.380952380952381
2590468,5,B000FUOUEM,This is a wonderful and inspiring addition to your Christian Library. We used it for our Ladies' Bible Study and it was well received,1300752000,5,133,4.583333333333333

2590472,5,B000FUOUEM,I am very happy I purchased this set. I had already seen one of them on TV. One I have yet to view. The Gospel according to Matthew is the reason I purchased this set. Many years ago it was on about six VHS tapes at a cost of over $100. It was always on my wish list. I just viewed it for the first time (two dvds) over the weekend and I am very happy with my purchase! It was as great as I thought it would be. I highly recommend this set.,1259625600,10,440,3.6914893617021276
2590473,2,B000FUOUEM,"The videos were delivered promptly, and I eagerly popped the first disc of ""Matthew"" in my player.  All was fine for the first half of the disc, then the playback began to pause momentarily.  By the end of chapter 10, playback pretty much ceased.  Ditto disc 2.

Tried the next set, ""John"".  Pretty much the same story.  Contacted Amazon, they said replacement discs were not available, though to be fair, they did offer a refund.  Don't want a refund; I really like the DVDs.  Next step, copy to my computer and see if they play from there.",1210809600,5,541,4.505154639175258
2590474,5,B000FUOUEM,"I could not have asked for a better or more visual interpretation than this production. It brought to life the 3 books of the NT  in ways I could not have imagined. A MUST SEE for all ages and every Christian Believer. It is great tool to use when witnessing, and for those of us who need refreshing. I HIGHLY recommend this to all.",1184371200,26,332,4.1875
2590485,5,B000FUOUEM,I enjoy watching these biblical stories on dvds. I read the bible a lot and it is nice to see some of the stories in a movie.,1489708800,,125,3.6666666666666665

2590488,5,B000FUOUEM,You have got to watch the Gospel of John - the three hour version.  My husband and I said this is the best portrayal of Jesus that we have ever seen - it is as if the Bible came to life in a movie.  The Passion of the Christ is the best crucifixion scene that we have ever watched.,1486512000,2,281,3.7457627118644066

2590492,5,B000FUOUEM,I love these movies. Pretty accurate. I use to watch them on you-Tube but copy right laws have changed that. But I love watching them so much when I saw the deal on these movies I had to have them. Acts and John are a scripture by scripture account. Matthew is pretty spot on. Either way they are much more satisfying to me to watch than some of the movies that are out there today. If you are a bible reader and love God's word these movies will not disappoint.,1471046400,,462,4.144444444444445

2590494,4,B000FUOUEM,"I had borrowed Matthew from a friend previously, which was why I asked for this set as a gift. I'm having problems with the Matthew DVD, but I love the storytelling. It helps me see Jesus' words in a way that is consistent with my theology. I love Acts too. The actors themselves seem to have the glow of transformation. John, however, was so disturbing I couldn't even finish it. John has been a favorite gospel of mine, filled with comfort and challenge. The actor portraying Jesus just seems disturbed all the time. I don't feel any peace coming from him. I can't enter in and gain new insight into the text because he portrays Jesus the opposite of how I know Him.",1467763200,,668,4.439024390243903
2590504,5,B000FUOUEM,"I was very pleased with the prompt delivery and careful packaging. I have only had time to view one DVD The Book of Matthew and the captioning was right on and the chapter and verse were displayed throughout the entire program. I am anxious to view the other DVDs. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to study the Bible from a different angle, but biblically correct. Scenery very vivid and characterizations realistic.",1467072000,2,426,4.77027027027027

2590507,4,B000FUOUEM,"I am so happy with the performance of the actors  in these DVDs, and the scenery and all the production work.  My only complaint is the second DVD for the book of Acts has a place in it where it skips.

They were supposed to be ""brand new"" but the disks were in the box backwards and so far the first disc has several scratches that made it skip a whole segment.

2590524,4,B000FUOUEM,"Good, helps bring the Bible to life. My main complaint? Like most Christian based drama, they seem to forget EVERYONE in the Bible / Middle East HAD and still HAS BROWN skin...not white and certainly no blue eyes. Get over yourselves, those of European descent...Jesus, Moses, Noah...all were brown skinned men. GET OVER IT.",1453507200,,324,5.018518518518518

2590528,5,B000FUOUEM,"Well performed by skilled actors.  The casting was well done also.  The dialogue (and story line) for each film come straight from the respective Bible books designated by the DVD titles.  IE, when the apostle John speaks, it's what the NIV version of Bible quotes him as saying at that point in the Gospel of John.  Each DVD starts at the beginning of the book and goes through it.  The Bible verse is indicated on the screen to allow cross-checking and further study.  The artistic liberty of the writers, directors and producers is applied in the selection of locations/scenery, non-speaking actors (extras) but is done well and kept in the spirit of the Bible.

We found them both entertaining and enlightening.  They also are a good tool to help kids understand these books and as a lead-in for discussion.",1442793600,3,811,4.784172661870503
2590529,5,B000FUOUEM,"We followed along with our bible, you are able to get a better understanding of the bible. I would recommend the Vision Bible especially for those who are new to the Word, or for those who read the bible and have a hard time understanding.",1440547200,,239,4.333333333333333

2590544,3,B000FUOUEM,The Gospel of John is amazing and remains my favorite Christian movie. I don't recommend the other two as they are very much substandard compared to John.,1434758400,3,154,4.7407407407407405

2590577,5,B000FUOUEM,I gave this to my 15 year old grand nephew for Christmas. I used to own this on DVD but now don't have a player so hope to see it after he has. I bought it originally because I read that the actors and directors were Holy Spirit lead,1419897600,,233,3.7755102040816326
2590578,5,B000FUOUEM,"I really appreciated the way of ""telling the old, old story"".  I mostly am thankful it is verbatim from the Bible--no ""spicing it up"" as almost all Biblical enactments do.  I was also challenged in my view of how Jesus ""sounded"" as He interacted with all people.  I think the default image we have to Christ is sterness--I appreciated that this portrayed Him as often smiling.  Of course, no one really knows what His inflections were when He said things or if He smiled with them but this does broaden the possibilities and can help the viewer rethink what Christ was/is like.",1419120000,,577,4.627450980392157

2590614,4,B000FUOUEM,"I loved the ''Gospel of John''; there was a sense of the holy about it.  The film has stayed with me for days and changed my life, and seeing that this is possible for a film has ruined me for anything less.

Henry Ian Cusick, in his portrayal of Jesus, gave a very intense performance, as well as the other actors.  I came away pursuing studies to find out what became of the disciples afterwards.

I had so hoped to find the same  crew in ""Acts"" and ""Matthew"", but alas, in ""Matthew"", we see such foolishness as Jesus throwing a bucket of water on a man while he is preaching the Sermon on the Mount!?!  The whole presentation of the Gospel of Matthew was on this level.  Perhaps the director and the actor who played Jesus had sat under this kind of preacher - one who deems the Gospel to be so uncompelling a subject that he feels he has to resort to such nonsense to keep the people awake.  It would be better to sleep through it.

I did like the old man who played the narrator, but the performances were either wooden or so full of attempts to be entertaining that I could not watch them more than 45 minutes - so I sent them back, and went on to order several copies of The Gospel of John.",1400803200,,1197,4.1695652173913045
2590615,3,B000FUOUEM,"The write up said they all had French subtitles.  I was very disappointed when only one of them had French subtitles, one has Spanish and one had only English.

2590619,5,B000FUOUEM,I just love these videos. They truly bring the bible alive. I do wish people didn't make the apostles seem so serious...almost unreal or unhuman. God made humor and gave us happiness and joy. The actors need to loosen up.,1392940800,,221,4.55

2590631,5,B000FUOUEM,Great word for word depiction. Great way to make the bible come alive for my 6 and 8 year old kids too. It really keeps their attention and they have asked several times to put in on. Even used it at the conclusion of our home Bible study after we finished the books of Acts. Acting is not cheesy. I would recommend it.,1389225600,,319,4.079365079365079
2590632,5,B000FUOUEM,this is the best three DVD's I have ever seen done for the Bible. The word of God done video and word for word. you can read your Bible with the DVD. Just wish there was more to come.,1388966400,,183,3.717948717948718
2590633,5,B000FUOUEM,"Reading the bible is one thing; however, when I view the visual bible it brings me to consider all that was going on around what was being said.  The facial gestures, crowd reactions, and social context give me pause to reconsider the deeper meanings behind scripture.",1387238400,,268,4.826086956521739

2590637,4,B000FUOUEM,This works good for my children to learn more about the bible and better understand what is said.  Some of the terminology in the bible goes over their head and this helps them to better understand it.,1381190400,,201,4.4324324324324325
2590638,5,B000FUOUEM,I love all three DVDs in that they are word-for-word renditions of the two Gospels and the book of Acts. The book of Acts has dated production but the core of the scriptures shines out in this film.,1379548800,,198,4.2368421052631575
2590639,5,B000FUOUEM,"I rented The Book of John through Netflix and wanted to buy the movie. I love it because its word for word from the Bible. The acting is great too. I started watching Acts...its good, I like it and glad I bought it...also word for word. But the acting isn't as good as John but its still good.  I work from home and plan on keeping these on in the background while working :) A great buy! Thank you Jesus!",1377907200,,405,4.0625

2590661,5,B000FUOUEM,"Great movie. What makes this collection so awesome it is word for word from the Bible while the actors remain in character. I can't even explain it but let me just say how great it would be to have the entire Bible like this. Although I would not trade for the actual text I still think it makes the Bible visually ""alive"" and easier for people to understand. This movie had excellent acting and was  definitely not boring. Thank God like most Bible based movies these days this movie is exceeding with talent. Loving Bruce Marchiano as ""Jesus"" I love how he portrays a more loving with great sense of humor type of Jesus than the ""Jesus"" I ""knew"" growing up.",1376265600,,659,4.446280991735537

2590663,5,B000FUOUEM,The video follows the Bible verse by verse. Like the actors and the sets.  Every church library should have a set.,1375488000,,114,4.428571428571429

2590665,5,B000FUOUEM,Three books of the Bible in movie form.  It is all directly from the Bible - nothing added or deleted.  Very good.  The book of John is the best of the three.,1368921600,2,158,3.875
2590666,5,B000FUOUEM,"I love these movies! My favorite is the book of Matthew, I have watched it so much that I have actually started to memorize the book of Matthew!",1368057600,2,144,4.178571428571429

These movies are word for word from the scriptures.",1367798400,2,205,4.885714285714286
2590669,5,B000FUOUEM,These were nice videos to watch. There are chapter markers on the bottom of the screen for the Mathew and Acts movies.,1366934400,,118,4.409090909090909
2590680,5,B000FUOUEM,This gets a very high rating due to the way it is presented in truth. No need to use discernment here as it comes straight out of the Holy Bible. Good enough for all ages to watch and grow.,1366156800,3,189,3.871794871794872
2590681,3,B000FUOUEM,"Matthew and Acts best.  Matthew actually excellent!  John's version kept showing Mary Magdalene with Christ and disciples night and day, even sleeping with them, though not actually beside any one, and dressed is what appeared t/b Catholic like headdress one would assoc. with nuns.  Her presence throughout was shamefully presented, scripturally misleading, and I would absolutely NOT use that account to show someone without Bible background that knew better.  There is NOTHING in the Bible to show any woman's presence with Christ and/or His Apostles/disciples as depicted here.  Cut it up and threw it away.",1365379200,7,611,5.389473684210526
2590682,4,B000FUOUEM,"The Gospel of John is beautifully portrayed using some of the finest actors in film history.  The actor portraying Jesus is profoundly believable and Biblically accurate.  Great pains were taken for accuracy in costuming and set design.  The set includes a separate disc with a shortened version, accompanied by behind the scenes documentary on the production of the film.  This is most interesting and informative.
Acts is portrayed in a Biblically correct way and is inspirational, telling the story from Luke's perspective, oftentimes at sea.
The Gospel of Matthew shows a different perspective of Jesus.  This portrayal of 'the laughing Jesus' catches one off guard.  There is no Biblical basis for showing 'the Man of Sorrows' wrestling and laughing, cutting up and affectionately kissing men on their heads.  When he wasn't doing these things, there were too many cut away shots of the elderly Matthew dictating his gospel to two sober looking scribes, with assorted guests coming and going.  Many of the actors in the cast seem to be observers rather than participants in the story.
My main complaint is that disc one of Matthew has eight places in which the disc stops or skips over a defective spot.  A replacement disc was sent by the seller, but has the identical problems.  We were told that it had been re-mastered recently, and this must be a 'compatibility issue', i.e. our machine's fault.  We had no problems with the other DVDs.  Apparently this happens frequently with other customers as well with this DVD.  The seller has offered a refund upon return of the Matthew DVD.
If there are enough customers having this problem, they should remove it from the marketplace until the problem is resolved.",1363737600,30,1716,5.0
2590683,5,B000FUOUEM,"I like this dvd presentation about the Gospel of Matthew, Gospel of John, and the Book of Acts of the Apostles because it helps me to better understand the order of events and sayings occurring in the accounts as they are written.",1361750400,3,230,4.5
2590684,5,B000FUOUEM,"BEST DESCRIPTION I HAVE EVER SEEN OF JESUS PERSONALITY. THE CHARACTER PLAYING JESUS HAS A REAL SENSE OF HUMOR, SMILES A LOT AND GETS HIS MESSAGES ACROSS.
iIT IS TAKEN WORD FOR WORD FROM THE NIIV BIBLE, IT IS PERFECT FOR TEACHING PURPOSES.
I LOVED IT.",1361664000,,250,4.456521739130435
2590685,5,B000FUOUEM,"I LOVE using this in my Bible classes; it really brings the Bible to life.  The only downside, I'm not crazy about the portrayal of Jesus - it makes Him almost flippant.  But a GREAT way to make the Bible real for the kids!",1360886400,,223,4.045454545454546
2590686,5,B000FUOUEM,Makes Christ come alive in a way I never knew possible really enjoy watching the DVDs always learn something new,1360800000,,112,4.65
2590687,5,B000FUOUEM,I especially like the fact that 2 of the movies show the chapter and verse at the same time so you can follow along. I've watched 2x since I've received them and each time learn something new.,1360108800,,192,4.216216216216216

2590689,5,B000FUOUEM,All of these videos are very well done. great presentation of Jesus that helps your children to see him as a real person. excellent choice for non readers too. My six year old with Down syndrome has easily memorized more of the gospels than I probably ever will. Its also very encouraging for me to watch. It helps me to meditate on the message and apply it.,1357862400,,358,4.358208955223881

2590701,5,B000FUOUEM,I have enjoyed these DVD's very much and watch them over and over. They are inspirational and very much worth the money. They followed the scriptures to the letter. The one disappointment was that The Gospel of John did not show the scripture verse by verse. Even though it was not NIV I followed the version used in my Bible and it was the same except for a word her or there moved. Acts I was enjoying but It locked up on Chapter 22. It completely locked up the system and was hard to shut off. So I didn't get to watch the end of it. I did try again but it did the same thing in the same spot. I think there was a flaw in the DVD or the filmig itsself. The acting in all three was very good also.,1352505600,,699,3.9295774647887325
2590702,4,B000FUOUEM,"This set contains 3 movies based word-for-word on the NIV - New International Version -Bible of the Books of Matthew, Gospel of John and Acts. My favorite is the Gospel of John, I like the way the actor portrayed Jesus. Acts is very good too. I love the way Dean Jones as the Apostle Luke narrates and weaves the story together. These dramatized movies really help bring out things that one misses in just reading these Books of the Bible. They also have Spanish with English substitles - good for practicing either language. I don't think I've watched Matthew all the way through yet.
Overall I would recommend getting the set.",1341619200,,628,4.666666666666667
2590703,4,B000FUOUEM,The visual bible is a great tool! The acting isn't as bad as someone thought here (in my opinion) and while the actor for Christ is no Jim Caveziel...it's really quite sufficient. For today's media driven generation (especially teens) this is PERFECT! You can also watch it by chapter and verse so it's easy to stop and pick up where you left off or just focus on one parable/passage.,1339027200,,384,4.579710144927536
2590704,5,B000FUOUEM,"Our family loves these videos and would love the producers to MAKE MORE of them!  While we don't really want to watch the whole thing in one sitting every time, it is great to watch a few chapters at a time, or a few stories and then talk about them.  These visual images help give you a picture of what it could have been like then and because the audio are word for word out of the Bible it has been a great way to memorize verses as well.  The chapter and verse are shown on the screen for the entire book.  WE LOVE THEM! I would absolutely recommend them for any family who wants to spend more time with God's Word.",1335657600,,619,4.049180327868853
2590705,5,B000FUOUEM,"We purchased the 3 episode Visual Bible set for Bible study.  Some people learn
better by watching & listening to the Bible while they have a difficult time reading
it.  We purchased through Amazon because their price was the most reasonable.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Visual-Bible-3-Episode-Set/dp/B000FUOUEM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Visual Bible 3-Episode Set</a>",1335484800,,416,7.829787234042553
2590706,1,B000FUOUEM,"An audio version of the bible would be better. The terrible acting is a distraction. It is sad that there is no money or good dirctors for religious movies. Also, most Christian movies start with more ads than any other kind of movies. These should be thrown out with the money changers! So disappointed I had to write my first review.",1334361600,3,335,4.508196721311475
2590707,5,B000FUOUEM,"We have owned this set for years and absolutely love it. The movies are very well done - including acting and follow Scripture (NIV I believe) to the word. There is no embellishment or alterations or anything.  It makes the word come alive for those who either have trouble reading - like my 93 year old grandmother, whom we bought this set for - or for those who are more visual learners.

I would never recommend watching alone over reading alone, but this is a tremendous supplement. I will be buying more for gifts in the future.  Note that the person who plays Jesus in the John videos is not the same as the one who plays Him in the other two sets (Acts and Matthew). This is not a problem unless you are going back and forth between them. I would recommend you watching one of them all the way through (and this will take some time - they are long...........wonderfully long) before moving onto a different one.

We really wish they would make more books of the Bible this way. There are other Bible videos out there, but they are not as realistic and they don't follow Scripture word for word as these do.  If I had a way to guarantee you'd like these myself, I'd back it up!  These are also very appropriate for children as there is nothing about them that would cause a parent to cringe or grab the pillow to cover little eyes :)",1329004800,6,1339,4.336
