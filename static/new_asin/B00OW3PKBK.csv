6775587,3,B00OW3PKBK,"I am writing this with a major bias. Been a fan of Paul Naschy for years. Yes, there is plenty of things wrong with this film. Script does wanders, over the top acting. I only recommend this is if your into Euro horror.",1425686400,,219,4.116279069767442
6775588,4,B00OW3PKBK,"I have yet to see this version, but here is my review of the abridged film when it was known as TOMB OF THE WEREWOLF (2003):  How director Fred Olen Ray got Paul Naschy over to the States to reprise his Waldemar Daninsky role is the biggest surprise in this otherwise piss-poor film. When a future descendant of Daninsky (the always good Jay Richardson) inherits Daninsky's ancestral home, Jay sees a way to make money off his inheritance. Not to belabor the plot, we get the basic Fred Olen Ray girl-on-girl action, Michelle Bauer and her big boobs playing Elizabeth Bathory (she's still a looker after all these years), way too little of Naschy (who speaks English phonetically), some sex and a little blood. When Fred Olen Ray was hosting his Yahoo Discussion Board, he said that two or three versions would probably be released of the film: An all-sex version; an all-violence version; and one that combines both. Since this film runs a scant 82 minutes and it's the only version available out there, I would say that this is the best you're going to get here. It's a shame because Naschy is wasted, Richardson dies way too early in this film and the plot is highly generic. Shot on high-definition video by Gary Graver (who never phones in a job), the film does have a professional look and sheen, but it's just not enough. It's another one of Ray's hack jobs whose only novelty is the appearance of Naschy. His werewolf makeup is sub-par and the blood quotient is way too low. The only question that I can come up with is: Why bring Naschy over to the States if you are just going to waste him? It holds little novelty as a horror film and less interest as a softcore porn film. What a shame. Also starring Stephanie Bentley, Kennedy Johnston, Jacy Andrews and Leland Jay. I still get a kick seeing Jay Richardson hawking law firms in commercials on TV. It always brings a smile to my face. Unlike this film. A Macabre Entertainment Release (and it's not even in stereo!). It took Fred Olen Ray until 2015 to release an uncut 95-minute horror version on DVD called THE UNLIVING.  TOMB is Rated R.THE UNLIVING is Not Rated. I hold great possibilities for this version of the film, but I'm not setting my sights too high. Ray has disappointed me many times before.",1423180800,4,2268,4.57002457002457
6775589,3,B00OW3PKBK,"Fred Olen Ray is a b-movie legend.  Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers is one of the best cult/slasher/b-movie fare ever.  I'm a fan.  I love Paul Nashy movies too, the old school werewolf stuff.  But something about the joining of the two didn't quite work for me.

One, this REALLY comes off as a late night Cinemax movie, softcore style.  Nudity is common in these movies, but it seriously overtakes the werewolf, Elizabath Bathory theme.

Watching this was like being reminded that the era of '80's b-movies are over, and this is a sad vestiage of that genre.  Most of Fred Olen Ray's movies have that fun, movie fodder feel to them, and it was missing in this feature.  More softcore and so very little horror.

If you own everything else Fred Olen Ray has put out, you'll still want to pick this up.  But Nashy is under used, and The Unliving becomes a Skin-e-max movie instead of a cool homage to cult classics.  C-",1422403200,13,914,4.539877300613497

8685123,4,B00OW3PKBK,"This new version of what was previously called TOMB OF THE WEREWOLF has a bit more Paul Naschy, but it still can't be called a ""good"" film.  Tellingly, the filmmakers seem to know this, describing in their commentary how they were wanting to make a Euro-horror-style picture, but were afraid they wouldn't be able to sell it.  Thus, they added in nudity and sex scenes.  In Euro-horrof films, though, scenes with sex and nudity (at least to some small extent) advance the plot or characters.  Here, they don't even have that pretense; the sex scenes stop the story entirely.  And the filmmakers even say that what they were trying didn't work in the commentary.  (Props to them for honesty.)  So...

If you're a Naschy completist, you may want to have this film.  I particularly liked the behind-the-scenes footage of Naschy in the extras.  If you're a fan of the actresses involved, you might like this -- many of them are beautiful and charming.  If you're looking for an introduction to Naschy's work, get something else -- like Werewolf's Shadow or Frankenstein's Bloody Terror.",1437004800,,1082,4.85792349726776
