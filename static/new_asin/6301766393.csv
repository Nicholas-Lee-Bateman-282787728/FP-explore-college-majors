7815571,1,6301766393,"If you want to see an outdated, uninformative video that is only peripherally about kitchen plumbing and electric, then this is the one for you.  It's actually the first of a two part howler done in 1990 by ""This Old House"" and it a complete waste of money.  The tape is only 60 minutes, the first 10 of which are inexplicably wasted with a tour with the creepy homeowners and Bob Vila of the house to be refurbished.  Then you waste a little more time with the kitchen designer (you'll wonder: is that a toupee or not?), again with NOTHING whatsoever about plumbing or electric.  You are treated with superficial discussions about carpentry, demolition and design before you finally get to see a plumber - 45+ minutes into the tape.  And guess what?  You learn nothing at all about plumbing or even hiring a stinking plumber.  One minute they're parading Rich the plumber throughout the house then the next has the homeowner moaning about how much the plumbing job done a few days ago cost.  You don't see any plumbing ever being done.  Believe it or not, the electric portion of the tape worse, with less than 30 seconds of seeing existing wiring and later a passing reference to wiring being done.  My beefs with the tape are twofold: first, it is not identified as a ""This Old House"" tape. If I had know the source material, I would have stayed far, far away.  TOH is not a how-to show by any stretch of the imagination.  My second beef is that the video had nothing to do with plumbing or electric.  What I wanted was a how-to video that had the basics of plumbing/electric tasks commonly found in a kitchen renovation.  What I got was a puff piece that had everything but what was advertised in the title.  Unfortunately, there was no description about the tape's contents on the Amazon.com sales page, and judging by the title, one could easily think that they're getting something worthwhile.  This is the biggest rip-off I've seen in a long time, and PBS should be ashamed for their part in marketing this bait-and-switch.",1004486400,9,2031,4.6155988857938715
