3072795,5,B00123GQLG,"I was amused by and had lots of fun with the first season of this modernized version of Robin Hood but it always felt pretty lightweight,  insubstantive.  The second series changed that.  I came to really care about the characters and their plights, getting drawn into the story arcs and character conflicts that ramped up from season beginning to end.  There is treachery and deceit from unlikely places and the danger level is at a higher notch (despite the fact that you don't see any bloodshed ... this is a family show, after all.)
If you have not seen this season be sure to avoid reading *anything* about the show online to avoid being spoiled for the finale!
I look forward to this release and a 3rd run of the show this fall on BBC!",1213315200,8,741,4.466666666666667
3072796,4,B00123GQLG,"Once again we are treated to another romp featuring Robin Hood.  From the it 's very first episode this fast paced action adventure series continues to please.  As long as one is able to suspend a lot of logic this series tends to work.  The fun character of this series is without doubt the role of the Sheriff. The sheriff has most of the best lines and just when you think he could get no lower he always does.  Living well in Nothingham castle also known as Castle Sieve as Robin and his men seem to be able to enter and leave this fortress pretty much at ease, the sheriff is surrounded by a seemingly endless horde of flunky guards, one may wonder where they all keep coming from.  The series is generally lighthearted  however there are moments of shocking violence.  In one episode Robin murders seven characters with throwing daggers while the sheriff kills two others all in the same episode.  Serious stuff indeed.",1212969600,2,925,4.5636363636363635
3072797,5,B00123GQLG,"I liked season 1 of RH but this season 2 far surpassed it. I was hooked with the first episode and it didn't let me go until the finale. Every episode was amazing except for the last episode, but I won't give away any spoilers. I've probably seen every episode at least 3 times already and I could still watch them over again! I'm dying to get this DVD!",1212105600,5,353,4.130434782608695

3072819,5,B00123GQLG,"I really enjoyed this series.  Having viewed the entire first season ""free"" with my Amazon Prime membership, I was hooked.  With the exception of Jonas Armstrong, most of the actors are unknown.  But they did a very good job with the well-written scripts they had to work with and their unique acting skills.  Unfortunately, I was only able to view up to Season 2, Episode 7 when someone pulled the ""free viewing"" and from thence onward, required payment to view the rest.  Thus I am unable to comment further on the rest of Season 2 & all of Season 3.  I protested to Amazon, but they told me they had no control over the provider of this series.  It is really a shame that quality series such as this are being pulled and what remains is nothing more than forty year-old movies that few people are interested in watching.",1424390400,,823,4.483221476510067

3072834,2,B00123GQLG,The best part is that it is clean.  You could watch this with older children and teens.  Soap opera writers.  Some good actors but mostly just decent.  I watched mostly out of boredom because I really didn't like the first few episodes but if you watch enough you get stuck.  Also several times I was impressed that the show didn't stoop to being low brow.  I disliked Robin Hood and Marian they were irritating characters.  Several merrimen are very lovable.,1415664000,,459,4.6625

3072903,3,B00123GQLG,"I find it entertaining, but not overly. Some of the phrases are definitely not from the period, but from today. The clothing isn't always accurate -- how many well-to-do ladies of the time walked around in public wearing trousers? And then there's Robin, himself. When others want to run off and do something, he cautions them to stop and think. When he wants to run off and do something, he tells others he knows what he's doing. Same with Marian. She's a thinker and planner, except when she decides not to. She's mouthy, too, and in the end, that does her in. Guy of Gisborne has ""developed"" into a pathetic imbecile now that he's the Sherriff's right hand man, believing that no matter how badly Marian plays him, he has a chance with her. In one episode, Little John counsels Marian about following orders because there can be only one leader, and then he acts on his own and unknowingly takes the Sheriff to the outlaws' camp. And still no Friar Tuck. As in the first season, each successive episode is written by a different person, making continuity an issue. It's entertaining, but in my opinion, not great.",1406332800,,1116,4.641414141414141
3072904,2,B00123GQLG,I wanted to like it because of Richard Armitage.  Unfortunately Robin and Marian are not very well acted.  Supporting cast is stronger.,1405987200,,135,5.090909090909091

Sure, it is silly in places.  The bad guys are really despicible, the good guys have their moments of indecision, too.  Fun and clean enough for the kids (6 and up) to watch.  Lots of sword and arrow play, but little blood and grossness.",1404000000,,389,4.260273972602739
3072923,5,B00123GQLG,What is not to like about this retelling of the classic Robin Hood story?  Great evil character.  Lovable heroes.  Adventure.  Conflicted antagonist.  Love story.  A great series to watch with your kids.,1402272000,,203,5.1875

3072939,3,B00123GQLG,I enjoy this show because it has an omniscient point of view and is a little suspenseful at times. It is also a classic that I remember watching as a young boy.,1399939200,,160,4.03125
3072940,4,B00123GQLG,i enjoyed watching this series. if your looking for actual time period robin hood this is not it. in some scenes show men in hiking boots with metal eyelets fabrics that are not of the period so forth and so on. but over all it's a fun series. you will enjoy the sheriff.,1399420800,,271,4.132075471698113
3072941,3,B00123GQLG,"I had watched this series on BBC when it first came out and I loved it.  Up until the last episode of Season 2 where they KILL MARIAN!  Seriously?  KILL HER?  The writing was great, the acting fantastic and the group had great chemistry.  But to kill off one of the major characters in a story that is timeless?  I have no idea what they were thinking.

I'm now watching Season 3 for the very first time, but without Marian, what's the point?",1399334400,,442,4.253012048192771

3072957,5,B00123GQLG,"I heard about this series not long after the first Hobbit movie came out, Richard Armitage (Thorin) plays Guy of Gisbourne, and checked it out at my local library.  I was instantly hooked.  The episodes are fun and full of adventure, and each one is better than the one before.  All of the actors play their roles so well that it is hard to decide who gave the best performance.  Each member of Robin's gang has a distinct personality, and I was completely taken with all of them.  The Sheriff of Nottingham is pure evil; and although Guy of Gisbourne lets his ambitions control his actions, there is a good man inside of him that wants to get out.  Although the third season was not well liked because of the direction that the show took at that point, it did not miss a step and continued to get more and more intriguing.  The show is also family friendly with very little profanity or sexual content.  I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fun, well-told adventure.",1396396800,,982,4.477528089887641
3072958,3,B00123GQLG,"Robin Hood is, in my opinion, a good series.  I generally don't like shows that are episodic (think Law and Order, CSI, or Seinfeld), and instead I prefer shows that are Serial (think Walking Dead, or Breaking Bad).  These are shows where the next episode builds on the one before it, and therefore the show must be watched in order.

Robin Hood is somewhere in the middle, having both an over-arching story line along with an episodic nature.  Aside from this, the show has both good and bad elements.  It's a very light show, with many comedic relief elements.  Because of that, at times it can be a bit corny.  Especially if you're normal TV consists of serious shows like those I mentioned above.  I recommend the show to someone looking for a light hearted filler show.  Nothing on TV tonight?  Watch a few episodes of Robin Hood.  If you're like me, I also wouldn't expect to get sucked in.  It's just not one of those shows.  Instead, it's one of those shows that you can watch a few episodes, leave it for a week or two, and come back.  Enjoy!",1396137600,,1051,4.43455497382199
3072959,4,B00123GQLG,"I am enjoying season two of this series.  The awkward situation with Gisborn has been resolved and the acting is becoming of a better quality and fluidity.  The opening episode's greater weight to the Marion character fits well (her acrobatic ability, a stronger, more determined personality, her increased physicality - after all, she was not some damaged damsel to be rescued but the Night Watchman).  There is more unity in the band and they even begin to make allies.  The storyline concerning Alan-a-Dale was perhaps a good thought, but the execution of it poorly handled and it took away from the character.  All in all, I am enjoying the early season two stories more than season 1.  We'll see how it goes, but I think it worth the time investment of watching.",1395964800,,767,4.7727272727272725
3072960,5,B00123GQLG,"I watched Robin Hood when it was on BBC America and fell in love with it.  It is funny and quirky with romance and action. Pretty much whatever is on BBC I'm a big fan.

3072963,5,B00123GQLG,I loved all of the Series of Robin Hood. Just finishing Series #3.  I know how it ends but there are clever twists and turns.  I also like some of the fun stuff that they add.  I know that phased used are only a thing from today which makes it funnier.,1395360000,,252,3.9019607843137254

3072981,5,B00123GQLG,This was probley the best season but writers screwed up big time on final episode. Maybe they thought this was the final season but totally put the nail in the coffin for this series. Loved the cast and story lines.,1394323200,,215,4.4
3072982,3,B00123GQLG,"My review of Season 2 follows my review of Season 1 to a T.

Although there is a storyline that progresses from episode to episode the main plot of each episode remains the same, at least one or more people are captured in every episode and are ultimately broken out of the dungeons.  Pick any episode and this will not change.  The writers need to be just a tad bit more creative with each episode to distinguish one from another.",1394236800,,431,4.3625
3072983,5,B00123GQLG,"I loved season one in this series, but season two was even better. although it does lose some of the charm of the first season, that's fairly normal for TV shows, and they make up for it more than adequately with an ever-thickening plot and ever-more-curious relationships.
  over the course of the season, loyalties are tested, broken, and re-formed; the line between good and bad is blurred and then defined again more than once, and the outlaw band is forced to face not only increasingly savvy foes but also to find its own purpose in the mess that was England in I-cant-remember-what-year-this-is-supposed-to-be-but-you-get-the-idea.
  this is not a story about perfect heroes. at times one wants to strangle Robin for his shortsightedness and occasional arrogance, and equally at times the bad guys (Guy of Gisbourne in particular) reveal an unexpected nobility. but that doesn't mean that there is no difference between them, either. the show repeatedly recognizes the insane courage morality takes. the bad guys (with the possible exception of the Sheriff) were not born malicious. they simply stood by while evil was being done, until eventually, by way of not resisting, they became part of the curse. there is a parallel between Alan and Guy, as they both face similar questions and, in the end, find differing answers.
  although the Alan/Gisbourne comparison was the most interesting part of the story for me, it is certainly not all that is going on, and the bittersweet ending resolves quite a few of the show's conflicts, although not before raising some new ones. the romance between Robin and Marian is-well-romantic, not to mention heartbreaking, sweet, and poetic. although some people might be angry at the way it ends, I thought it was beautiful, although sad. and although I could ramble on about the merits of this awesome show for quite a while, I'll end by saying that it is fun and definitely worth watching. i dare you not to fall in love with it.

p.s. a note for those concerned about shows being 'clean'-this one is. maid Marian wears a few flattering dresses, there is some very vague innuendo, torture scenes that cut off or resolve before anything grisly actually happens, and one shot of an inactive and adequately covered prostitute. there may have been some swearing, too, but nothing overly offensive or out of context.",1393891200,,2357,4.997448979591836

3073109,4,B00123GQLG,"This legend is a great choice for episodic TV, as the historical characters provide many story arcs.  Given how Wall Street robber barons remind us that stealing from the rich to give to the poor could apply to our lives today, these light hearted scripts are involving.  The one thing that doesn't ring true is how frequently Robin & his gang engage in mortal combat with Guy of Gisborn or the Sheriff of Nottingham, yet no final death blow is struck on either side -- because that would have ended the series early.  Richard Armitage shines as the long haired villain Guy.  His sexy black leather ensemble (which stands out because he rides a white  horse) is more a star of the show than the top billed Keith Allen.  Jonas Armstrong portrays Robin of Locksley with convincing compassion and athleticism.  Lucy as Maid Marion is cute and sweet, but when she dons a disguise to fight with swords one must suspend belief.  (Her shorter height, curvy figure, and lady's boots would have given her away.)  The character of Much adds humor to provide relief from frequent scenes of fear and violence -- such as children being scheduled to be hung for stealing a loaf of bread -- but we already know that Robin will always save them in time.  In terms of historical accuracy, Maid Marion sought sanctuary in a convent after Robin eventually died, but the writers here chose a different path to end this series.  While that enables greater depth of character and nuance to be brought to Gisborn's role in series 3 -- and RA's acting chops really come to the fore in series 3 -- I was so misled by the comedic tone of this series that I was not prepared for a sudden, brutal end to Maid Marion.  (I literally had to take some weeks off before viewing any more episodes.)  In terms of psychology, if Gisborn had loved Marion as deeply as the scripts claim he did, he would have fled from his dishonorable job to France, rescuing Marion by taking her with him.  Robin would have followed, and then both men would have likely fought to the death, leaving Marion at least alive.  Instead, we are left to assume that Gisborn's twisted character results from a deeply damaging childhood, since he weakly follows the murderous orders of a sociopathic Sheriff rather than think for himself.",1380067200,,2276,4.626865671641791

I started to think there were mostly only series of shows about vampires, vampire killers, fake witches [I can't get a episode out of my mind where these 3 dumb 'witches' were saying that a muse was someone who makes others disoriented when a muse is in truth someone who inspires].

It doesn't surprise me any more why America has been getting so dumbed down, why once a mighty nation is now is so far behind other countries.

While not historically correct this series is sweet, entertaining & can actually give a glimpse into what life once was for many of our ancestors.

I was sad that Robin Hood went for the last girlfriend, the one his dear friend liked, especially since she was so selfish, & dumb.
I do hope this show sparks/ed interest enough in history that made/s people want to research, learn.

And I so wish it would have stuck to certain facts of that time. People who don't know any better are going to believe that all the different color people were hanging out back then when that was not how history honestly was.

It's as bad as when I was a little girl and saw Cleopatra played by Elizabeth Taylor, it wasn't until I was in 5th grade that I learned that no way could Cleopatra be white! Or seeing the white blue eyed Jesus in the mormon church I had to attend, I was so embarrassed by the time I was 11 to find out Jesus could not have been blue eyed & white!

Each plot has something new and more difficult for Robin Hood and his crew to overcome which keeps me wanting to watch more of it--it's a ""page turner"". Definitely would recommend it to anyone.",1376438400,,430,4.671052631578948

We became connected to the characters and the story line.  After watching all three series we were left  wanting more.

The actors and actresses did such a believable job in demonstrating loyalty for the cause, love for one another (the love triangle between Robin, Marian, and Sir Guy is a key element of the series), love of country and aid to the poor.

We have actually watched some of the episodes several times.

I highly recommend this series.",1374364800,,615,4.682242990654205

3073194,5,B00123GQLG,"Howdy.  As with season 1, I enjoyed season 2.  This series is a refreshing point of view with some of the same themes.  Robin Hood is, of course, the dashing and daring hero who steals from the rich and gives to the poor.  His thwarting of the Sheriff's and Gisborn's efforts are also neatly done.  I especially like the character build ups including the personal interplays between them.  I can believe that Marion sees good in Gisborn regardless of his efforts to exhibit a mean streak and dark doings.  I found myself growing in empathy for Gisborn.  We all have that dark side of ourselves.  Some just show it more than others.  I was sad as I watched the death of an important figure and at who's hand the deed was done.  I wasn't sure if I liked this.  I am a romantic and wanted a very different outcome.  I was also used to the idea that the hero gets the girl.  Alan has stepped up and it gives me pleasure to watch his inner conflict.  His good outweighs his bad but what a bad.  Nicely done there.  I am looking forward to how this plays out in the 3rd series.  Now, it's not merely ""On to Locksley!"", it's ""Save the King and Country!""  Go forth and conquer, all you Robins!",1365724800,,1185,4.280542986425339

3073209,4,B00123GQLG,Good length and content in series for a quick sit-down family movie. Story lines are good. Probably the most unrealistic parts are the ability of the gang to enter Nottingham town numerous times past guards with peasant garb and to enter the castle by the sewer without the castle security figuring out a way to secure the sewer grates.

But overall it has great acting and good scripts.  The last few episodes of Season 2 took the show in a different direction and Season 3 takes it back to it's roots with new characters and direction.

This Robin Hood series is a little dark at times but lightens things up with some humerous scenes.  The interplay between the characters and especially the love triangle between Marian, Guy and Robin is what kept me watching and eagerly anticipating the next DVD from Netflix.

SPOILERS***

My main objection is that Marian should NOT have been killed at the end! She and Robin Hood are true love! The fact that they killed her is why I didn't watch Season 3. Here's how it should have ended: Guy doesn't kill Marian,  Marian and Robin get married, they defeat the Sheriff,  they have a baby and everyone lives happily ever after.

Even with the disappointing ending, the show is still worth watching.",1357689600,,840,4.758620689655173

3073270,4,B00123GQLG,"Robin's final escape by tearing the hanging to slow down his descent stretches the bounds of reality--just a bit too much, too improbable, too unlikely, not even remotely a solution. The sheriff and Sir Guy need to find a midpoint in characterisation:  the sheriff is way overplayed making his character a buffoon and too campy to be realistic;  on the other hand, Sir Guy is too stiff and staid in his reactions.  The sheriff needs to tone it down several notches and Guy needs to open up more.  The are in danger of creating caricatures and not characters.",1329436800,,558,4.663265306122449

I absolutely love Jonas Armstrong and Richard Armitage's back and forth as the rivals Robin Hood and Guy of Gisborne. Keith Allen is wonderfully amusing as the Sheriff of Nottingham, while being delightfully evil at the same time. Lucy Griffiths is a wonderfully brave Lady Marian, I love the twist on the character.",1329091200,,466,4.695121951219512
3073272,5,B00123GQLG,"If you didn't think that one more Robin Hood incarnation could possible hold its own against the long series of productions over the past decades, here's the proof that it indeed can--and HAS--been done. This remake of the Robin Hood epic, made by the BBC and filmed in 2006, as a superb new look at the story and the characters, and is completely remade for a 21st century audience. The story is the same, with (for the most part) all the same characters, and the motives of the merry band of men remains unchanged: the Sheriff of Nottingham, along with his henchman, Guy of Gisborne, have illicitly taken over Nottingham (the rightful manor of Locksley himself) and Robin and his men are taking from the Sheriff to feed the poor and the needy while they wait for the return of the King so that things can be made right.

You would think that in this age of Avatar that there would be almost no way such a show could be of interest, and yet this wonderful series from the BBC shows that it can indeed be so, and Robin Hood here can hold the attention and interest in parents and children alike. It's updated, to be sure, and, yes, it contains numerous anachronisms, but that isn't the point at all: this is the classic Robin Hood story told all over again for today's audience in a dramatic, exciting, and fun-loving way. The show follows the classic Robin Hood story in Season One (the show runs a total of three seasons, and takes a slight turn in the standard story in Season Two, and takes an even bigger turn in Season Three), and if you know the story, you'll enjoy seeing how this show tells it in their own way. But nearly any child watching will be able to pick up the story quite well, with clear villains, heroes, and motives. It's fun, dramatic, and exciting.

The show is lushly filmed. Using a full-scale, outside set that was built in Hungary (you would swear this was in the middle of England, near to the true Sherwood Forest), the scenes are acted out on a grand scale that makes us completely unaware that this is a dramatic production. Colors are lush and intense. The costumes worn, though replete with anachronistic styles (some of Marian's outfits appear as though they just came off the rack at J. Crew), are gorgeous and fun to look at it, and really, that's the point: you should just sit back and enjoy this for what it is. It isn't a historical examination of the mid-twelth century English setting: it's the story of Robin Hood, told for a modern audience. The filming is so lush that the closest thing I can think of to which to compare it is the BBC's MI-5, which is a modern-day police drama that also uses the intense colors and slick production values to a similar effect. It's gorgeous, and its such a shame that, to date (December 2012) only the First Season is available on Blu-Ray.

Some standout performances exist, although nearly all the cast is excellent. The evil Sheriff (Keith Allen) is both menacing and funny, his sidekick, Guy (Richard Armitage) is a double-minded, tragic figure, Robin Hood himself (Jonas Armstrong) is the hero's hero, Little John (Gordon Kennedy) is the group's moral compass, and Much (Sam Troughton) is both hilarious and heart-tugging. Season Two continues the classic story of Robin Hood established in Season One, but ups the ante with increased dramatic scenarios, and some new cast additions.

This show is fun, entertaining, and often, thought-provoking. It pulls on your emotions. It draws you in. Kids can enjoy it as well as adults. Five stars.",1325635200,,3524,4.6336
3073273,5,B00123GQLG,"If you didn't think that one more Robin Hood incarnation could possible hold its own against the long series of productions over the past decades, here's the proof that it indeed can--and HAS--been done. This remake of the Robin Hood epic, made by the BBC and filmed in 2006, as a superb new look at the story and the characters, and is completely remade for a 21st century audience. The story is the same, with (for the most part) all the same characters, and the motives of the merry band of men remains unchanged: the Sheriff of Nottingham, along with his henchman, Guy of Gisborne, have illicitly taken over Nottingham (the rightful manor of Locksley himself) and Robin and his men are taking from the Sheriff to feed the poor and the needy while they wait for the return of the King so that things can be made right.

You would think that in this age of Avatar that there would be almost no way such a show could be of interest, and yet this wonderful series from the BBC shows that it can indeed be so, and Robin Hood here can hold the attention and interest in parents and children alike. It's updated, to be sure, and, yes, it contains numerous anachronisms, but that isn't the point at all: this is the classic Robin Hood story told all over again for today's audience in a dramatic, exciting, and fun-loving way. The show follows the classic Robin Hood story in Season One (the show runs a total of three seasons, and takes a slight turn in the standard story in Season Two, and takes an even bigger turn in Season Three), and if you know the story, you'll enjoy seeing how this show tells it in their own way. But nearly any child watching will be able to pick up the story quite well, with clear villains, heroes, and motives. It's fun, dramatic, and exciting.

The show is lushly filmed. Using a full-scale, outside set that was built in Hungary (you would swear this was in the middle of England, near to the true Sherwood Forest), the scenes are acted out on a grand scale that makes us completely unaware that this is a dramatic production. Colors are lush and intense. The costumes worn, though replete with anachronistic styles (some of Marian's outfits appear as though they just came off the rack at J. Crew), are gorgeous and fun to look at it, and really, that's the point: you should just sit back and enjoy this for what it is. It isn't a historical examination of the mid-twelth century English setting: it's the story of Robin Hood, told for a modern audience. The filming is so lush that the closest thing I can think of to which to compare it is the BBC's MI-5, which is a modern-day police drama that also uses the intense colors and slick production values to a similar effect. It's gorgeous, and its such a shame that, to date (December 2012) only the First Season is available on Blu-Ray.

Some standout performances exist, although nearly all the cast is excellent. The evil Sheriff (Keith Allen) is both menacing and funny, his sidekick, Guy (Richard Armitage) is a double-minded, tragic figure, Robin Hood himself (Jonas Armstrong) is the hero's hero, Little John (Gordon Kennedy) is the group's moral compass,  and Much (Sam Troughton) is both hilarious and heart-tugging.

Just got finished watching this season.  Let me first say, I absolutely LOVED the characters and the casting in this series.

There goes the series"".  ...and then to leave 2 other great characters in the Holy Land... why do writers do this?  At this point, I don't know if I can even go on to Season 3.
Good job to the actors, though; I wish them well.",1288915200,5,1029,4.363157894736842

3073304,4,B00123GQLG,"The second season of Robin Hood BBC was a bit of a downer for me.  Season One was electric.  Due to the brilliance of the cast, particularly Jonas Armstrong as Robin Hood, Lucy Griffiths as Maid Marian, and Richard Armitage as Sir Guy of Gisbourne.  But everyone was great.  I have to say this was possibly the most gifted ensemble cast ever to grace a television series of any genre.  This retelling of Robin Hood had the possibility to actually overshadow my previous favorite version, the 1984 Robin of Sherwood.  ROS had everything but there were a few mis-steps,at times the talented actors, Michael Praed as Robin, Judi Trott as Maid Marian, Clive Mantle as Little John, Ray Winstone as Will Scarlett, etc, could give a bad reading of a line if left to their own devices.  But at other times ROS ascended to the level of great art.

The actors of Robin Hood BBC rarely if ever misread a line.  They were supreme.  But unforunately the writers lost their vision midway through Season Two and totally went mad in the final episode, S2, E13.  They in effect undid every positive thing in the series for me and S3 is just a mess.  I would give S1 a 10, S2 a 9, and S3 and 2.  It just wasn't believable or interesting for me.  For Sir Guy of Gisbourne fans, perhaps, S3 was better, because basically the writers ignored Robin Hood and made S3 the ""Sir Guy of Gisbourne Show"".  But back to Season 2.  There is still enough left of the original conceit, Robin Hood for our generation, that Series 2 is still great.  But it is a shame that the writers let everything fall apart in their zeal to do something different with the Sir Guy character.

This is why, despite my feelings that Season One and Season Two had the possbility of finally creating a Robin Hood that was the DEFINITIVE Robin Hood, (mostly because of Jonas Armstrong's brilliant portrayal of Robin Hood) they failed.  Robin Of Sherwood is still champ.  I think everyone should see this BBC version, because of the incredible chemistry between Robin Hood and Maid Marian... and also yet the chemistry between Maid Marian and Sir Guy..  But if you want to see the DEFINITIVE ROBIN HOOD..  buy the 1984 version, Robin Of Sherwood, starring the delicious Michael Praed in the first two seasons, and Jason Connery in the third season as Robin Hood.",1276300800,4,2308,4.564476885644769

3073310,5,B00123GQLG,"The reason I love this series is because it is so much fun.  I am a huge fan of the Robin Hood legend.  My favorite rendition is Errol Flynn (""Adventures of Robin Hood"", 1938) but what Jonas Armstrong brings to the character shouldn't be missed.  Armstrong's facial expressions and delivery makes you love Robin even more.

The actors who portray Hood's gang was well cast.  They play off each other beautifully.  I feel the group is more unified that I have ever seen before-I love it when they state together, ""WE ARE ROBIN HOOD"".  you realize that is is more than one person, it is an ideal.

The storytelling is also well done.  It gives you more than Robin Hood and his band of thieves stealing from the rich (and giving to the poor).  From the beginning of season 1, you discover the history of Robin Hood, the Sheriff of Nottingham (brilliantly played by Keith Allen), the battle of the throne between Richard and John as well as how the gang was formed.

I love every season-as I am now enjoying the 3rd and last on BBC America, my favorite is season 2.  So many people are critical of certain details (i.e. accuracy of costumes).  Personally, I think it is a beautiful telling of the legend in every way.  It is an enjoyable series-lighthearted and fun.

I hate to say goodbye to Jonas Armstrong's Robin Hood after only three seasons.  Thank goodness for DVDs so I can continue to invite him, Big John, Much, Tuck and the others in my home.",1255478400,6,1449,4.494252873563219
3073311,5,B00123GQLG,"The second season of the new BBC ""Robin Hood"" gets off to an uneven start.  The first three episodes feature overly cheesy adventure plots (including one in which the hero is slowly lowered into a snakepit and one in which the baddies are trying to build an invincible army by creating armor out of impenetrable metal), but the strong character and relationship development more than makes up for it -- specifically, the Robin Hood/Lady Marian/Guy of Gisborne triangle, the storyline of Allan turning a spy for Gisborne, and the tense dynamic between Guy and the Sheriff of Nottingham.

From Episode 4 onward, however, the pace really picks up and the cheese factor drops dramatically (despite some lame moments here and there).  The Sheriff's plot against King Richard and Robin, Marian, and the gang's efforts to stop this plot take center stage, even as the character/relationship developments get ever more complicated and interesting.  Robin's almost fanatical zeal in the king's cause takes an often dark turn, Marian is devoted to his cause but finds herself stifled when she joins him in the woods, Allan is torn between opportunistic self-interest and attachment to his friends in the gang, and Guy's feelings for Marian bring out his long-suppressed humanity and cause him to question the Sheriff's actions.  Meanwhile, Marian's love and admiration for Robin coexists with increasingly complex attraction/repulsion feelings toward Guy as she begins to see a compassionate and even noble side to him.  The dynamic between Guy and Allan is fascinating to watch as the two seem to develop a genuine friendship.  The storyline involving Marian's father is also very touching.  Meanwhile, the Sheriff remains his deliciously evil self as he plays for ever-higher stakes.  The cast does a great job, particularly Richard Armitage as Guy, Keith Allen as the Sheriff, Lucy Griffiths as Marian, Joe Armstrong as Allan and Jonas Armstrong as Robin.  Some of the supporting cast is excellent as well, especially the actress who plays Matilda the accused witch in ""Ducking and Diving"" and the actor who plays Lord Winchester in ""For England.""

Episodes 6 through 12 are truly awesome (my personal favorites are ""For England"" and ""Walkabout"").  The season finale is highly controversial because of ....

... Marian's death at Guy's hands.  I don't think it was a wise decision, and Marian's departure definitely harmed the show (though I think there is a lot to like in Season 3 as well), but at the same time, it is a very powerful if tragic conclusion to the S2 storyline.  (Too bad it's somewhat diluted by a ridiculously drawn-out death scene in which Marian is way too coherent for someone who's been stabbed in the stomach, and the sequences after her death drag on much too long as well.)

Joe Armstrong as the two timing Allan a Dale, who becomes the sidekick to Sir Guy (or the sidekick of the sidekick) was particularly enjoyable for me in this season.
  Again, my biggest disappointment as a Catholic was, again, no decent clerical characters to balance out the 'bad' ones.  In one episode, 'Catholic' Robin even punches an evil cleric so that he falls down a flight of stairs.  ANY Catholic would know, evil or not, to hit a priest, with the priestly character on his soul, was tantamount to hitting Christ Himself and considered a mortal sin.  The only time one would be allowed to 'manhandle' a priest was if he was in the act of actually harming himself or someone else physically - and even in that case one is not allowed to use more force than necessary. (Allan a Dale even pushes over a nun in one episode to get her 'seal' to fool Guy that Marian is writing from the convent.) Again, the history revisionists at the BBC are having their fun at the expense of historical reality, but....what can one expect of the current anti Christian climate in the world?

Once I received my copy from my local library and started watching it, I was pleased to discover that it had taken on a more serious tone while still maintaining it's charming antics/humor. However, the ending of the season ruined the entire series for me.

Spoilers Ahead:

Mind you, BBC has every right to take creative liberties with the original story, but killing off an important central character, thereby changing the entire tone of the story is unforgivable. Robin Hood is not supposed to be some tortured hero. He is supposed to be the embodiment of hope. I  absolutely despise it when creators kill off main characters simply to boost their ratings. The death was entirely pointless and served no purpose other than to try to get a powerful reaction out of the viewers. I didn't cry, and I'm a huge baby when it comes to character deaths, but halfway through the last episode it became very obvious the direction they were heading, and I was very very unhappy about the turn of events.

I gave this seaon two stars instead of one because I honestly enjoyed the season up until the last episode. In part one of the season finale (which was my favorite episode) I was enraptured-- these characters were finally admitting their deepest darkest fears, as well as expressing their feelings of love for one another. I was truly moved by their confessions.  However, due to the unexpected and entirely unnecessary death, I will not be watching season three.

Side Note: Guy of Gisbon is the most uneven character! The writers can't decide if he's good deep down, or if he's just an evil bastard thirsting for power. Make up your minds! In one episode he completely redeems himself through self-sacrifice and in another he commits several unforgivable, heinous acts of violence and treachery. I thought it had been established that he had changed... but apparently it was only for that one episode?",1221523200,5,2036,4.769886363636363
3073361,5,B00123GQLG,"I know there are some negative comments out there, but if you enjoyed Season 1 give Season 2 a try. Robin, his gang, Marion, Sir Guy and the Sheriff are all back. There is ""more of the same"" but there is also ""more."" I think this is what has upset many viewers. While there is still plenty of fun to be had in Season 2 the writers have stirred things up and thickened the plot. Many of the character weaknesses and conflicts that gave nuance to Season 1 come to fruition in Season 2. The tone is a bit darker, but unlike a soap opera that takes years to unfold, the Robin Hood story moves forward at an exciting pace.

Granted, the first few episodes are weak and lacking the energy of Season 1, but eventually the story opens up beyond Nottingham and things become more interesting. And some of the Season 2 episodes - like Lardener's Ring - are exceedingly clever! Most importantly, the characters are still captivating and the humor is still fresh.

To fully appreciate Season 2, it needs to be thought of not as just a continuation of Season 1 but as a precursor to Season 3. The writers took some risks shaking things up and in a way they have become similar to the hero they write about. I find myself asking - just as I do each time Robin and the gang are trapped - ""How are they going to get out of this one?"" The prospect is exciting! So enjoy Season 2 and wait with me in anticipation for Season 3.",1221177600,3,1408,4.25

Season Two is much more serious. Both Robin and the Sheriff are playing for keeps now and there's no taboo now on Robin taking lives.

We're pre-ordering Season Two, but the episodes have not held us as bedazzled as the first season.  Still, this is a show I know we'll dust off and watch in the future on a snowy weekend or during summer reruns.

While the first season had some irritating things (Gisbon, Robin and Marian wearing designer clothes; the perfect hair; Marian's Nightwatchman persona; and replacing Friar Tuck with a female Muslim character), I did enjoy it as a fun swashbuckling series.  This year with the supernatural plotlines and the Black Knights, it became more on the par with Xena.  They ruined an entertaining series this year.",1215648000,3,577,5.042105263157895

3073384,5,B00123GQLG,"Robin and the gang are back, giving us a second season packed with action, intrigue, humor, and even more of those wonderful little character moments that made the first season such a joy.  It is evident even from the first episode that the overall tone of the show is much darker this time around, as each our heroes must contend not only with the Sheriff's evildoings, but also with their own personal tragedies.  This darker tone goes hand-in-hand with a bit more violence, though it is no more graphic than what was presented in the first season.  This gives the show an intensity that had been missing before, and the opportunity to present some jaw-dropping action sequences (Robin vs the Black Knights is not to be missed!).

It was always the characters that made the show appealing to me, and on that score S2 delivers in spades.  There are many lovely Robin/Marian moments, and some surprising new alliances (of friends and enemies) are formed as well.  One of my favorite scenes of the entire series is a beautifully-written character exposition sequence in the episode ""A Good Day To Die"" where, in the classic death-at-sunrise scenario, each member of the gang spends their potentially last-night-on-earth revealing their inner secrets.  It's an extremely emotional scene, and a powerful one, that brings up insecurities and issues that have been building since the very beginning of the series.

Of course, the series wouldn't be Robin Hood if there wasn't also plenty of fun to be had along the way.  The Sheriff is still as hilarious as he is evil, and it's a blast watching Robin and Co. get the best of him time and again.  Keith Allen does an especially great job with the Sherrif's gloating/crying in ""Get Carter"", an episode which also introduces one of the most enjoyable recurring characters to come to Nottingham in quite awhile.

Season 2 has more of a cohesive story arc than season one, and as such, there are plot twists galore (most notably the 2-part finale) that impact future episodes and draw on events of those past. I'd recommend staying spoiler-free until you've seen them. That being said, get a box of tissues handy and be prepared to pick your jaw up off the floor by the time you finish the last episode. It's a doozy.

Rumor has it, there will be a S3, although the BBC is a being a bit cagey as to the details. In the meantime, settle down with season two and enjoy the ride!",1213401600,35,2417,4.701421800947867

There is treachery and deceit from unlikely places and the danger level is at a higher notch (despite the fact that you don't see any bloodshed ... this is a family show, after all.)

As long as one is able to suspend a lot of logic this series tends to work.  The fun character of this series is without doubt the role of the Sheriff. The sheriff has most of the best lines and just when you think he could get no lower he always does.  Living well in Nothingham castle also known as Castle Sieve as Robin and his men seem to be able to enter and leave this fortress pretty much at ease, the sheriff is surrounded by a seemingly endless horde of flunky guards, one may wonder where they all keep coming from.  The series is generally lighthearted  however there are moments of shocking violence.

The clothing isn't always accurate -- how many well-to-do ladies of the time walked around in public wearing trousers? And then there's Robin, himself. When others want to run off and do something, he cautions them to stop and think. When he wants to run off and do something, he tells others he knows what he's doing. Same with Marian. She's a thinker and planner, except when she decides not to. She's mouthy, too, and in the end, that does her in. Guy of Gisborne has ""developed"" into a pathetic imbecile now that he's the Sherriff's right hand man, believing that no matter how badly Marian plays him, he has a chance with her. In one episode, Little John counsels Marian about following orders because there can be only one leader, and then he acts on his own and unknowingly takes the Sheriff to the outlaws' camp. And still no Friar Tuck. As in the first season, each successive episode is written by a different person, making continuity an issue.

3307436,3,B00123GQLG,I enjoy this show because it has an omniscient point of view and is a little suspenseful at times. It is also a classic that I remember watching as a young boy.,1399939200,,160,4.03125

3307438,3,B00123GQLG,"I had watched this series on BBC when it first came out and I loved it.  Up until the last episode of Season 2 where they KILL MARIAN!  Seriously?  KILL HER?  The writing was great, the acting fantastic and the group had great chemistry.  But to kill off one of the major characters in a story that is timeless?  I have no idea what they were thinking.

I'm now watching Season 3 for the very first time, but without Marian, what's the point?",1399334400,,442,4.253012048192771

3307454,5,B00123GQLG,"I heard about this series not long after the first Hobbit movie came out, Richard Armitage (Thorin) plays Guy of Gisbourne, and checked it out at my local library.  I was instantly hooked.  The episodes are fun and full of adventure, and each one is better than the one before.  All of the actors play their roles so well that it is hard to decide who gave the best performance.  Each member of Robin's gang has a distinct personality, and I was completely taken with all of them.  The Sheriff of Nottingham is pure evil; and although Guy of Gisbourne lets his ambitions control his actions, there is a good man inside of him that wants to get out.  Although the third season was not well liked because of the direction that the show took at that point, it did not miss a step and continued to get more and more intriguing.  The show is also family friendly with very little profanity or sexual content.  I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fun, well-told adventure.",1396396800,,982,4.477528089887641
3307455,3,B00123GQLG,"Robin Hood is, in my opinion, a good series.  I generally don't like shows that are episodic (think Law and Order, CSI, or Seinfeld), and instead I prefer shows that are Serial (think Walking Dead, or Breaking Bad).  These are shows where the next episode builds on the one before it, and therefore the show must be watched in order.

Robin Hood is somewhere in the middle, having both an over-arching story line along with an episodic nature.  Aside from this, the show has both good and bad elements.  It's a very light show, with many comedic relief elements.  Because of that, at times it can be a bit corny.  Especially if you're normal TV consists of serious shows like those I mentioned above.  I recommend the show to someone looking for a light hearted filler show.  Nothing on TV tonight?  Watch a few episodes of Robin Hood.  If you're like me, I also wouldn't expect to get sucked in.  It's just not one of those shows.  Instead, it's one of those shows that you can watch a few episodes, leave it for a week or two, and come back.  Enjoy!",1396137600,,1051,4.43455497382199
3307456,4,B00123GQLG,"I am enjoying season two of this series.  The awkward situation with Gisborn has been resolved and the acting is becoming of a better quality and fluidity.  The opening episode's greater weight to the Marion character fits well (her acrobatic ability, a stronger, more determined personality, her increased physicality - after all, she was not some damaged damsel to be rescued but the Night Watchman).  There is more unity in the band and they even begin to make allies.  The storyline concerning Alan-a-Dale was perhaps a good thought, but the execution of it poorly handled and it took away from the character.  All in all, I am enjoying the early season two stories more than season 1.  We'll see how it goes, but I think it worth the time investment of watching.",1395964800,,767,4.7727272727272725

3307479,3,B00123GQLG,"My review of Season 2 follows my review of Season 1 to a T.

Although there is a storyline that progresses from episode to episode the main plot of each episode remains the same, at least one or more people are captured in every episode and are ultimately broken out of the dungeons.  Pick any episode and this will not change.  The writers need to be just a tad bit more creative with each episode to distinguish one from another.",1394236800,,431,4.3625
3307480,5,B00123GQLG,"I loved season one in this series, but season two was even better. although it does lose some of the charm of the first season, that's fairly normal for TV shows, and they make up for it more than adequately with an ever-thickening plot and ever-more-curious relationships.
  over the course of the season, loyalties are tested, broken, and re-formed; the line between good and bad is blurred and then defined again more than once, and the outlaw band is forced to face not only increasingly savvy foes but also to find its own purpose in the mess that was England in I-cant-remember-what-year-this-is-supposed-to-be-but-you-get-the-idea.
  this is not a story about perfect heroes. at times one wants to strangle Robin for his shortsightedness and occasional arrogance, and equally at times the bad guys (Guy of Gisbourne in particular) reveal an unexpected nobility. but that doesn't mean that there is no difference between them, either. the show repeatedly recognizes the insane courage morality takes. the bad guys (with the possible exception of the Sheriff) were not born malicious. they simply stood by while evil was being done, until eventually, by way of not resisting, they became part of the curse. there is a parallel between Alan and Guy, as they both face similar questions and, in the end, find differing answers.
  although the Alan/Gisbourne comparison was the most interesting part of the story for me, it is certainly not all that is going on, and the bittersweet ending resolves quite a few of the show's conflicts, although not before raising some new ones. the romance between Robin and Marian is-well-romantic, not to mention heartbreaking, sweet, and poetic. although some people might be angry at the way it ends, I thought it was beautiful, although sad. and although I could ramble on about the merits of this awesome show for quite a while, I'll end by saying that it is fun and definitely worth watching. i dare you not to fall in love with it.

p.s. a note for those concerned about shows being 'clean'-this one is. maid Marian wears a few flattering dresses, there is some very vague innuendo, torture scenes that cut off or resolve before anything grisly actually happens, and one shot of an inactive and adequately covered prostitute. there may have been some swearing, too, but nothing overly offensive or out of context.",1393891200,,2357,4.997448979591836

3307606,4,B00123GQLG,"This legend is a great choice for episodic TV, as the historical characters provide many story arcs.  Given how Wall Street robber barons remind us that stealing from the rich to give to the poor could apply to our lives today, these light hearted scripts are involving.  The one thing that doesn't ring true is how frequently Robin & his gang engage in mortal combat with Guy of Gisborn or the Sheriff of Nottingham, yet no final death blow is struck on either side -- because that would have ended the series early.  Richard Armitage shines as the long haired villain Guy.  His sexy black leather ensemble (which stands out because he rides a white  horse) is more a star of the show than the top billed Keith Allen.  Jonas Armstrong portrays Robin of Locksley with convincing compassion and athleticism.  Lucy as Maid Marion is cute and sweet, but when she dons a disguise to fight with swords one must suspend belief.  (Her shorter height, curvy figure, and lady's boots would have given her away.)  The character of Much adds humor to provide relief from frequent scenes of fear and violence -- such as children being scheduled to be hung for stealing a loaf of bread -- but we already know that Robin will always save them in time.  In terms of historical accuracy, Maid Marion sought sanctuary in a convent after Robin eventually died, but the writers here chose a different path to end this series.  While that enables greater depth of character and nuance to be brought to Gisborn's role in series 3 -- and RA's acting chops really come to the fore in series 3 -- I was so misled by the comedic tone of this series that I was not prepared for a sudden, brutal end to Maid Marion.  (I literally had to take some weeks off before viewing any more episodes.)  In terms of psychology, if Gisborn had loved Marion as deeply as the scripts claim he did, he would have fled from his dishonorable job to France, rescuing Marion by taking her with him.  Robin would have followed, and then both men would have likely fought to the death, leaving Marion at least alive.  Instead, we are left to assume that Gisborn's twisted character results from a deeply damaging childhood, since he weakly follows the murderous orders of a sociopathic Sheriff rather than think for himself.",1380067200,,2276,4.626865671641791

While I enjoy this version of Robin Hood, I am more than happy to wait a week to see the next installment.

I started to think there were mostly only series of shows about vampires, vampire killers, fake witches [I can't get a episode out of my mind where these 3 dumb 'witches' were saying that a muse was someone who makes others disoriented when a muse is in truth someone who inspires].

It doesn't surprise me any more why America has been getting so dumbed down, why once a mighty nation is now is so far behind other countries.

While not historically correct this series is sweet, entertaining & can actually give a glimpse into what life once was for many of our ancestors.

I was sad that Robin Hood went for the last girlfriend, the one his dear friend liked, especially since she was so selfish, & dumb.
I do hope this show sparks/ed interest enough in history that made/s people want to research, learn.

And I so wish it would have stuck to certain facts of that time. People who don't know any better are going to believe that all the different color people were hanging out back then when that was not how history honestly was.

It's as bad as when I was a little girl and saw Cleopatra played by Elizabeth Taylor, it wasn't until I was in 5th grade that I learned that no way could Cleopatra be white! Or seeing the white blue eyed Jesus in the mormon church I had to attend, I was so embarrassed by the time I was 11 to find out Jesus could not have been blue eyed & white!

I don't believe it is PC to charge the true colors of historical people & in time with real history, it messes up the truth!",1377302400,,1511,4.265734265734266

Robin Hood is, of course, the dashing and daring hero who steals from the rich and gives to the poor.  His thwarting of the Sheriff's and Gisborn's efforts are also neatly done.  I especially like the character build ups including the personal interplays between them.  I can believe that Marion sees good in Gisborn regardless of his efforts to exhibit a mean streak and dark doings.  I found myself growing in empathy for Gisborn.  We all have that dark side of ourselves.  Some just show it more than others.  I was sad as I watched the death of an important figure and at who's hand the deed was done.  I wasn't sure if I liked this.  I am a romantic and wanted a very different outcome.  I was also used to the idea that the hero gets the girl.  Alan has stepped up and it gives me pleasure to watch his inner conflict.  His good outweighs his bad but what a bad.  Nicely done there.  I am looking forward to how this plays out in the 3rd series.  Now, it's not merely ""On to Locksley!"", it's ""Save the King and Country!""

But overall it has great acting and good scripts.  The last few episodes of Season 2 took the show in a different direction and Season 3 takes it back to it's roots with new characters and direction.

This Robin Hood series is a little dark at times but lightens things up with some humerous scenes.  The interplay between the characters and especially the love triangle between Marian, Guy and Robin is what kept me watching and eagerly anticipating the next DVD from Netflix.

SPOILERS***

My main objection is that Marian should NOT have been killed at the end! She and Robin Hood are true love! The fact that they killed her is why I didn't watch Season 3. Here's how it should have ended: Guy doesn't kill Marian,  Marian and Robin get married, they defeat the Sheriff,  they have a baby and everyone lives happily ever after.

Even with the disappointing ending, the show is still worth watching.",1357689600,,840,4.758620689655173

3307767,4,B00123GQLG,"Robin's final escape by tearing the hanging to slow down his descent stretches the bounds of reality--just a bit too much, too improbable, too unlikely, not even remotely a solution. The sheriff and Sir Guy need to find a midpoint in characterisation:  the sheriff is way overplayed making his character a buffoon and too campy to be realistic;  on the other hand, Sir Guy is too stiff and staid in his reactions.  The sheriff needs to tone it down several notches and Guy needs to open up more.  The are in danger of creating caricatures and not characters.",1329436800,,558,4.663265306122449

This remake of the Robin Hood epic, made by the BBC and filmed in 2006, as a superb new look at the story and the characters, and is completely remade for a 21st century audience. The story is the same, with (for the most part) all the same characters, and the motives of the merry band of men remains unchanged: the Sheriff of Nottingham, along with his henchman, Guy of Gisborne, have illicitly taken over Nottingham (the rightful manor of Locksley himself) and Robin and his men are taking from the Sheriff to feed the poor and the needy while they wait for the return of the King so that things can be made right.

You would think that in this age of Avatar that there would be almost no way such a show could be of interest, and yet this wonderful series from the BBC shows that it can indeed be so, and Robin Hood here can hold the attention and interest in parents and children alike. It's updated, to be sure, and, yes, it contains numerous anachronisms, but that isn't the point at all: this is the classic Robin Hood story told all over again for today's audience in a dramatic, exciting, and fun-loving way. The show follows the classic Robin Hood story in Season One (the show runs a total of three seasons, and takes a slight turn in the standard story in Season Two, and takes an even bigger turn in Season Three), and if you know the story, you'll enjoy seeing how this show tells it in their own way. But nearly any child watching will be able to pick up the story quite well, with clear villains, heroes, and motives. It's fun, dramatic, and exciting.

The show is lushly filmed. Using a full-scale, outside set that was built in Hungary (you would swear this was in the middle of England, near to the true Sherwood Forest), the scenes are acted out on a grand scale that makes us completely unaware that this is a dramatic production. Colors are lush and intense. The costumes worn, though replete with anachronistic styles (some of Marian's outfits appear as though they just came off the rack at J. Crew), are gorgeous and fun to look at it, and really, that's the point: you should just sit back and enjoy this for what it is. It isn't a historical examination of the mid-twelth century English setting: it's the story of Robin Hood, told for a modern audience. The filming is so lush that the closest thing I can think of to which to compare it is the BBC's MI-5, which is a modern-day police drama that also uses the intense colors and slick production values to a similar effect. It's gorgeous, and its such a shame that, to date (December 2012) only the First Season is available on Blu-Ray.

Some standout performances exist, although nearly all the cast is excellent. The evil Sheriff (Keith Allen) is both menacing and funny, his sidekick, Guy (Richard Armitage) is a double-minded, tragic figure, Robin Hood himself (Jonas Armstrong) is the hero's hero, Little John (Gordon Kennedy) is the group's moral compass, and Much (Sam Troughton) is both hilarious and heart-tugging. Season Two continues the classic story of Robin Hood established in Season One, but ups the ante with increased dramatic scenarios, and some new cast additions.

This show is fun, entertaining, and often, thought-provoking. It pulls on your emotions. It draws you in. Kids can enjoy it as well as adults. Five stars.",1325635200,,3524,4.6336

Just got finished watching this season.  Let me first say, I absolutely LOVED the characters and the casting in this series.  LOVED Jonas Armstrong's portrayal of Robin with his Peter-Pan like humor & likability.  Spunky Maid Marian had her high points, and the other members of the band were so fun. These elements kept me watching Season 1 & 2 despite some misgivings about writing and directing that were at times too big for their britches...  BUT...

How in the world do you decide to kill off Maid Marian in a Robin Hood story?!  What were they smoking in the conference room?!  Badly done.  I am BUMMED!  When we got to that part in the finale, I couldn't even engage emotionally; I didn't even take the trip with them... I bailed and thought, ""Rats.  There goes the series"".  ...and then to leave 2 other great characters in the Holy Land... why do writers do this?  At this point, I don't know if I can even go on to Season 3.
Good job to the actors, though; I wish them well.",1288915200,5,1029,4.363157894736842

3307801,4,B00123GQLG,"The second season of Robin Hood BBC was a bit of a downer for me.  Season One was electric.  Due to the brilliance of the cast, particularly Jonas Armstrong as Robin Hood, Lucy Griffiths as Maid Marian, and Richard Armitage as Sir Guy of Gisbourne.  But everyone was great.  I have to say this was possibly the most gifted ensemble cast ever to grace a television series of any genre.  This retelling of Robin Hood had the possibility to actually overshadow my previous favorite version, the 1984 Robin of Sherwood.  ROS had everything but there were a few mis-steps,at times the talented actors, Michael Praed as Robin, Judi Trott as Maid Marian, Clive Mantle as Little John, Ray Winstone as Will Scarlett, etc, could give a bad reading of a line if left to their own devices.  But at other times ROS ascended to the level of great art.

The actors of Robin Hood BBC rarely if ever misread a line.  They were supreme.  But unforunately the writers lost their vision midway through Season Two and totally went mad in the final episode, S2, E13.  They in effect undid every positive thing in the series for me and S3 is just a mess.  I would give S1 a 10, S2 a 9, and S3 and 2.  It just wasn't believable or interesting for me.  For Sir Guy of Gisbourne fans, perhaps, S3 was better, because basically the writers ignored Robin Hood and made S3 the ""Sir Guy of Gisbourne Show"".  But back to Season 2.  There is still enough left of the original conceit, Robin Hood for our generation, that Series 2 is still great.  But it is a shame that the writers let everything fall apart in their zeal to do something different with the Sir Guy character.

This is why, despite my feelings that Season One and Season Two had the possbility of finally creating a Robin Hood that was the DEFINITIVE Robin Hood, (mostly because of Jonas Armstrong's brilliant portrayal of Robin Hood) they failed.  Robin Of Sherwood is still champ.  I think everyone should see this BBC version, because of the incredible chemistry between Robin Hood and Maid Marian... and also yet the chemistry between Maid Marian and Sir Guy..  But if you want to see the DEFINITIVE ROBIN HOOD..  buy the 1984 version, Robin Of Sherwood, starring the delicious Michael Praed in the first two seasons, and Jason Connery in the third season as Robin Hood.",1276300800,4,2308,4.564476885644769

3307807,5,B00123GQLG,"The reason I love this series is because it is so much fun.  I am a huge fan of the Robin Hood legend.  My favorite rendition is Errol Flynn (""Adventures of Robin Hood"", 1938) but what Jonas Armstrong brings to the character shouldn't be missed.  Armstrong's facial expressions and delivery makes you love Robin even more.

The actors who portray Hood's gang was well cast.  They play off each other beautifully.  I feel the group is more unified that I have ever seen before-I love it when they state together, ""WE ARE ROBIN HOOD"".  you realize that is is more than one person, it is an ideal.

The storytelling is also well done.  It gives you more than Robin Hood and his band of thieves stealing from the rich (and giving to the poor).  From the beginning of season 1, you discover the history of Robin Hood, the Sheriff of Nottingham (brilliantly played by Keith Allen), the battle of the throne between Richard and John as well as how the gang was formed.

I love every season-as I am now enjoying the 3rd and last on BBC America, my favorite is season 2.  So many people are critical of certain details (i.e. accuracy of costumes).  Personally, I think it is a beautiful telling of the legend in every way.  It is an enjoyable series-lighthearted and fun.

The first three episodes feature overly cheesy adventure plots (including one in which the hero is slowly lowered into a snakepit and one in which the baddies are trying to build an invincible army by creating armor out of impenetrable metal), but the strong character and relationship development more than makes up for it -- specifically, the Robin Hood/Lady Marian/Guy of Gisborne triangle, the storyline of Allan turning a spy for Gisborne, and the tense dynamic between Guy and the Sheriff of Nottingham.

From Episode 4 onward, however, the pace really picks up and the cheese factor drops dramatically (despite some lame moments here and there).  The Sheriff's plot against King Richard and Robin, Marian, and the gang's efforts to stop this plot take center stage, even as the character/relationship developments get ever more complicated and interesting.  Robin's almost fanatical zeal in the king's cause takes an often dark turn, Marian is devoted to his cause but finds herself stifled when she joins him in the woods, Allan is torn between opportunistic self-interest and attachment to his friends in the gang, and Guy's feelings for Marian bring out his long-suppressed humanity and cause him to question the Sheriff's actions.  Meanwhile, Marian's love and admiration for Robin coexists with increasingly complex attraction/repulsion feelings toward Guy as she begins to see a compassionate and even noble side to him.  The dynamic between Guy and Allan is fascinating to watch as the two seem to develop a genuine friendship.  The storyline involving Marian's father is also very touching.  Meanwhile, the Sheriff remains his deliciously evil self as he plays for ever-higher stakes.  The cast does a great job, particularly Richard Armitage as Guy, Keith Allen as the Sheriff, Lucy Griffiths as Marian, Joe Armstrong as Allan and Jonas Armstrong as Robin.  Some of the supporting cast is excellent as well, especially the actress who plays Matilda the accused witch in ""Ducking and Diving"" and the actor who plays Lord Winchester in ""For England.""

Episodes 6 through 12 are truly awesome (my personal favorites are ""For England"" and ""Walkabout"").  The season finale is highly controversial because of ....

... Marian's death at Guy's hands.  I don't think it was a wise decision, and Marian's departure definitely harmed the show (though I think there is a lot to like in Season 3 as well), but at the same time, it is a very powerful if tragic conclusion to the S2 storyline.  (Too bad it's somewhat diluted by a ridiculously drawn-out death scene in which Marian is way too coherent for someone who's been stabbed in the stomach, and the sequences after her death drag on much too long as well.)

All in all, a vastly enjoyable season.",1254182400,9,2874,4.941787941787942

Joe Armstrong as the two timing Allan a Dale, who becomes the sidekick to Sir Guy (or the sidekick of the sidekick) was particularly enjoyable for me in this season.
  Again, my biggest disappointment as a Catholic was, again, no decent clerical characters to balance out the 'bad' ones.  In one episode, 'Catholic' Robin even punches an evil cleric so that he falls down a flight of stairs.  ANY Catholic would know, evil or not, to hit a priest, with the priestly character on his soul, was tantamount to hitting Christ Himself and considered a mortal sin.  The only time one would be allowed to 'manhandle' a priest was if he was in the act of actually harming himself or someone else physically - and even in that case one is not allowed to use more force than necessary. (Allan a Dale even pushes over a nun in one episode to get her 'seal' to fool Guy that Marian is writing from the convent.) Again, the history revisionists at the BBC are having their fun at the expense of historical reality, but....what can one expect of the current anti Christian climate in the world?

Worth the full price! I can't wait for Season Two!""

All of a sudden, this great Robin Hood story turns into a lackluster, boring crawl through Sherwood Forest.

3307857,2,B00123GQLG,"I wasn't a huge fan of the first season, but I enjoyed it enough to continue watching once the second season had been released on dvd. Once I received my copy from my local library and started watching it, I was pleased to discover that it had taken on a more serious tone while still maintaining it's charming antics/humor. However, the ending of the season ruined the entire series for me.

Spoilers Ahead:

Mind you, BBC has every right to take creative liberties with the original story, but killing off an important central character, thereby changing the entire tone of the story is unforgivable. Robin Hood is not supposed to be some tortured hero. He is supposed to be the embodiment of hope. I  absolutely despise it when creators kill off main characters simply to boost their ratings. The death was entirely pointless and served no purpose other than to try to get a powerful reaction out of the viewers. I didn't cry, and I'm a huge baby when it comes to character deaths, but halfway through the last episode it became very obvious the direction they were heading, and I was very very unhappy about the turn of events.

I gave this seaon two stars instead of one because I honestly enjoyed the season up until the last episode. In part one of the season finale (which was my favorite episode) I was enraptured-- these characters were finally admitting their deepest darkest fears, as well as expressing their feelings of love for one another. I was truly moved by their confessions.  However, due to the unexpected and entirely unnecessary death, I will not be watching season three.

Side Note: Guy of Gisbon is the most uneven character! The writers can't decide if he's good deep down, or if he's just an evil bastard thirsting for power. Make up your minds! In one episode he completely redeems himself through self-sacrifice and in another he commits several unforgivable, heinous acts of violence and treachery. I thought it had been established that he had changed... but apparently it was only for that one episode?",1221523200,5,2036,4.769886363636363
3307858,5,B00123GQLG,"I know there are some negative comments out there, but if you enjoyed Season 1 give Season 2 a try. Robin, his gang, Marion, Sir Guy and the Sheriff are all back. There is ""more of the same"" but there is also ""more."" I think this is what has upset many viewers. While there is still plenty of fun to be had in Season 2 the writers have stirred things up and thickened the plot. Many of the character weaknesses and conflicts that gave nuance to Season 1 come to fruition in Season 2. The tone is a bit darker, but unlike a soap opera that takes years to unfold, the Robin Hood story moves forward at an exciting pace.

Granted, the first few episodes are weak and lacking the energy of Season 1, but eventually the story opens up beyond Nottingham and things become more interesting. And some of the Season 2 episodes - like Lardener's Ring - are exceedingly clever! Most importantly, the characters are still captivating and the humor is still fresh.

To fully appreciate Season 2, it needs to be thought of not as just a continuation of Season 1 but as a precursor to Season 3. The writers took some risks shaking things up and in a way they have become similar to the hero they write about. I find myself asking - just as I do each time Robin and the gang are trapped - ""How are they going to get out of this one?"" The prospect is exciting! So enjoy Season 2 and wait with me in anticipation for Season 3.",1221177600,3,1408,4.25

Season Two is much more serious. Both Robin and the Sheriff are playing for keeps now and there's no taboo now on Robin taking lives.

We're pre-ordering Season Two, but the episodes have not held us as bedazzled as the first season.  Still, this is a show I know we'll dust off and watch in the future on a snowy weekend or during summer reruns.

3307881,5,B00123GQLG,"Robin and the gang are back, giving us a second season packed with action, intrigue, humor, and even more of those wonderful little character moments that made the first season such a joy.  It is evident even from the first episode that the overall tone of the show is much darker this time around, as each our heroes must contend not only with the Sheriff's evildoings, but also with their own personal tragedies.  This darker tone goes hand-in-hand with a bit more violence, though it is no more graphic than what was presented in the first season.  This gives the show an intensity that had been missing before, and the opportunity to present some jaw-dropping action sequences (Robin vs the Black Knights is not to be missed!).

It was always the characters that made the show appealing to me, and on that score S2 delivers in spades.  There are many lovely Robin/Marian moments, and some surprising new alliances (of friends and enemies) are formed as well.  One of my favorite scenes of the entire series is a beautifully-written character exposition sequence in the episode ""A Good Day To Die"" where, in the classic death-at-sunrise scenario, each member of the gang spends their potentially last-night-on-earth revealing their inner secrets.  It's an extremely emotional scene, and a powerful one, that brings up insecurities and issues that have been building since the very beginning of the series.

Of course, the series wouldn't be Robin Hood if there wasn't also plenty of fun to be had along the way.  The Sheriff is still as hilarious as he is evil, and it's a blast watching Robin and Co. get the best of him time and again.  Keith Allen does an especially great job with the Sherrif's gloating/crying in ""Get Carter"", an episode which also introduces one of the most enjoyable recurring characters to come to Nottingham in quite awhile.

Season 2 has more of a cohesive story arc than season one, and as such, there are plot twists galore (most notably the 2-part finale) that impact future episodes and draw on events of those past. I'd recommend staying spoiler-free until you've seen them. That being said, get a box of tissues handy and be prepared to pick your jaw up off the floor by the time you finish the last episode. It's a doozy.

Rumor has it, there will be a S3, although the BBC is a being a bit cagey as to the details. In the meantime, settle down with season two and enjoy the ride!",1213401600,35,2417,4.701421800947867

8243666,4,B00123GQLG,"I have loved the Robin Hood story since I was a little kid watching the disney version with foxes. This version from the BBC is really enjoyable if a little inconsistent on the acting/plot side. It's overall really well cast especially Jonas Armstrong as Robin and Lucy Griffiths as Lady Marian they have wonderful chemistry. I've often thought while watching this that it would have been wonderful to see the two of them play the characters again. On the plot side the show has a pretty strong season one, however the emphasis on daring feats is a little corny because, well, it's a low budget BBC production. That being said it's impressive they even attempt some of the things they do.

Since it's a TV show you don't get the satisfaction of anyone ever getting a true happy ending and there are times where the motivation for actions seems off. The biggest one for me was I could never really figure out exactly why Guy of Gisborne kept siding with the Sheriff, this is elaborated on in Season Two, but it still never quite stuck. Also theres a lot of funny incongruities like how the Sheriff never seems to actually know who Robin's men are despite them never being in disguise and fighting in close combat with him multiple times etc. If you like historical accuracy you will not like the costumes on the show at all as they veer much more towards a modern interpretation of that era in time.

Robin Hood most importantly is a folk fable and what really matters is the morals/ideals being communicated. On that front this show is very earnest and some what heavy handed. It originally aired in 2006 at a time when the UK was now becoming involved in America's war in the middle east. This is prevalent in how the show presents the crusades and I think for the most part it comes off genuine. There is an interesting developing love triangle between Robin/Marian/Guy that doesn't always feel believable until the characters shift and Guy/Robin start to become two sides of one coin. This makes the plot vastly more interesting but admittedly I stuck around because I loved Robin and Marian a lot so when the end of series 2 came around........I was too sad and let down to go on I think that choice was a big mistake and a disappointing end for very beloved and well fleshed out characters.

Lucy's Lady Marian is my favorite Marian I have ever watched in a production of this story. I really appreciated that the writers let her be mad and conflicted about her relationship with Robin and the other men in her life. Others I have seen give her differing backstory's but in this she's Robin's childhood love and was engaged to him before he left to fight for the King. An interesting aspect to the story is the lingering sadness and betrayal she felt and still feels over that decision. If you like Robin Hood and just British TV in general you will enjoy this a lot.",1520899200,,2872,4.562015503875969
