I have enjoyed the progress that I have made, especially since I take lessons only when I have free time, and use the Pause Button with great frequency.  I have gotten to know some great instructors (Happy Traum, Stefan Grossman and many more) via the DVD lessons and have seen some lessons where the artist plays beautifully, but did not appear to possess the gift of teaching.

Not so with Fred Sokolow.

An easy going style and a nice voice contributes to the already professional video work (great close ups, split screens, etc) to make for excellent lessons.  What makes this special is the fun of the songs.

Recently, Sokolow released ""Bawdy Songs"" (from the 20's and 30's) with all but one being tasteful and fun (one is not subtle and not one to play around children) and it was from this excellent DVD that he mentioned the songs of Bessie Smith, causing me to purchase this one afterwards.

The two go perfectly together.

The songs are fun to play, Intermediate level (late beginner for ""Bawdy"") and a blast to learn.  ""I Ain't Got Nobody"" sounds great to play without singing, and Fred moves slow enough for the late beginner, but gives plenty of extras for the Intermediate.

Like ""Bawdy"", learning ""Electric Chair"" is as much fun as ""She's Your Cook, but She Burns My Bread Sometimes"" and has a way of catching an audience's attention (as I see from my family listening!), and the lessons provide months of solid instruction for the learner.

These two DVDs contain funny and clever songs, with great bluesy sounds and are perfect for solo acoustic or for bands.",1359244800,,1657,4.65979381443299
