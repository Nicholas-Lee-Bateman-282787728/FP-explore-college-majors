7913301,4,B00000JRU5,"Wing Chun Volume 2 by William Cheung

This Volume of Wing Chun lessons demonstrates the Bil Jee form, the third form of Wing Chun after Sil Lim Tao and Chum Kil, both of which were demonstrated in Volume 1.  The demonstration is done twice by William Cheung.  After the second demonstration, William Cheung's assistant performs broken sequences of moves from the Bil Jee form for which William Cheung explains and demonstrates the application of the sequence of moves.

Next, William Cheung instructs about the pressure point targets on the body of the opponent to strike.  This is called dim mak in chinese.  In Japanese styles, it's called atemi or sometimes kyusho.

William Cheung prepares us for Chi Sao, a very unique exercise to develop ambidextrious skill in hand techniques, reflexes, harmony with the opponent's kinetic energy to sharpen perception, timing and in general fluid execution of techniques, by having us practice the moves of Chi Sao with one hand while the other is stationary on the hip.  Then, the other hand is put through the same drill while the first hand is held stationary on the hip.

William Cheung gradually instructs us into using both hands in Chi Sao exercises and introduces techniques, tactics and short strategies to trap the opponents hands and arms to open up his defense and imobilize his arms by thoughtful manuevering and keeping William Cheung's ""BOEC"" strategy in mind while looking for the moment of opportunity to execute the strategy.

This series of Wing Chun videos and DVD's is full of useful tips to use in any style of fighting.  Any serious martial artist will appreciate the wealth of practical application of the moves demonstrated by William Cheung and his assistant in this series.",1097884800,,1741,4.989619377162629
7913302,1,B00000JRU5,"William chueng is a excellent practioner.  But his videos leave  lot to be desired. His explanations are rather choppy at best. he does not explain the body mechanics behind each motion properly enough, for anyone to really understand how to apply the movements with any relevance to real fighting situations. which might make you get hurt in a real street fight, he is starting to show his age a bit and not enough of his true skill in wing chun.",981763200,3,447,4.575
