8737254,5,B016S7YR8O,"Great workout as usual!  All of the 3 dvds were superb!!!  Got my heart rate up and tone my body like nothing does!!!!  I had great results with Linda's Barlates last year from her youtube workout.  I decided to buy more of her downloads and within a month and a half, I lost 14 pounds!!!!  I'm not overweight to start with, just wanted to lose a bit of weight, but the result was unexpected!  My clothes were looser and I feel really great!  My whole body was really toned.

I decided to buy this set and other of her dvds!  LOVE THEM ALL!  Keep more workout coming please Linda!",1457740800,3,580,4.238532110091743
8737255,5,B016S7YR8O,"I've been working out for pretty much thirty years, the last ten of which have been spent at home using workout DVDs.  I have about 300+ workout DVDs in my collection -- and Barlates Body Blitz have become my latest workout obsession!  I love Linda's personality, and she makes the time go by so quickly.

To do the workouts in this set, you'll only need the following equipment:

--a yoga mat
--a pilates or playground ball
--a light set of weights

Each DVD contains three workouts, plus a warm-up and cooldown.  In her first two DVDs, there were premix options built right in, but with this new set, you can only select one section of the workout at a time; this isn't a big deal, though, since each workout ends by taking you back to the main menu.

The Cardio Interval Tone 50 segment on each of three disks has 50 seconds of work, followed by 10 seconds of rest.  Each of those also focuses on exercises designed to work the body part on that disk.  For instance, the arm one has a lot of kickboxing moves, while the core one focuses on standing cardio work that targets the abs and obliques.

The Barre Intervals 40 segments contain exercises that you do for 40 seconds, before moving on to the next exercise, with no rest in between.

The Micro and Iso segments will have you especially shaking and quivering as you use micro movements to really fire the muscles.

These are really fun, and I especially appreciated the fact that the core DVD was actually fun to do  since I hate core exercises (probably because it's one of my weakest areas).

There is also a ""timer"" that shows you how many rounds you have left in the workout, which always helps keep me motivated.

These are fun and effective, and definitely worth adding to your DVD collection!",1449705600,3,1757,4.4984227129337535
