1236696,4,B00000JQVL,"VIOLENT COP is the first movie directed by japanese actor/director Takeshi Kitano in 1989 and the film is a very good surprise for the Film Noir amateur. As often in japanese movies, silences are more meaningful than dialogs but physical violence is filmed with a scalpel objective when necessary.
The movie is resolutely pessimistic from its first scene to the last images. The first minutes of VIOLENT COP will make you feel very uneasy, the director destroying in two scenes the universal phantasm of the innocence of childhood. In order to let the audience breathe a little, Kitano brings a little humor in the relations between the old cop and its new partner, a rookie who has chosen to learn the job by following him.
Takeshi Kitano has without a doubt a style of his own and the final duel involving all the characters still alive is a piece of anthology that stands masterfully the comparison with the final  la John Woo or  la Quentin Tarantino that have invaded our screens from the beginning of the 90's on.

1236697,5,B00000JQVL,"Darkly humourous, Violent Cop (Sono Otoko Kyobo Ni Tsuki) is the story of an abusive detective named Azuma, as he goes head to head with a rogue member of a tokyo organized crime family.  Not for the faint hearted,  Violent Cop, is not a hollywood type story, it is depressing and deeply  symbolic - very japanese/eurpoean in the flavour of its pathos.  Highly  recommended for those who appreciate good film.",961804800,6,409,4.785714285714286
1236698,5,B00000JQVL,"This film has humour, intelligence and extremely beautiful camera direction, which offers some of the most stunning and imaginative scenes since Hitchcock. Oh yeah, and it has lots of both realistic and comic  violence. What more do you need? Go on, watch it.",957484800,2,259,5.023255813953488
1236699,4,B00000JQVL,"Pretty good movie, where vioelence creeps up as the movie goes on.  Kitano plays a cop which gets violent as the movie goes on.  He starts by slapping a street punk, then moves onto kicking a businessman who had a one night  stand with his sister, continues with punching a dope dealer, and finishes  by killing several drug dealers, and his own sister. This is a very good  and entertaining movie,  but it is purely fictive.  As a foreigner living  in Tokyo since 1998, I never heard or seen any violence in this country.  I  would recommend this movie for a few reasons.  It is a good cop movie, it  shows good scenes from Tokyo, and gives some insight to Japanese culture  (except the violence part)",953769600,,702,4.476190476190476
1236700,4,B00000JQVL,"""Beat"" Takeshi Kitano's movies aren't so much about story as comic situations, a mix of horror, humour and pathos (a tone later appropriated by Quentin Tarantino for Pulp Fiction), and characters whose  unmoving consistency tends to lead them to tragedy.
Violent Cop is the  most accessible of his films I've seen so far, with strangely staged but  compelling action sequences (witness the white-knuckle knife-in-hand  scene), some perfectly timed physical comedy, and more of Kitano onscreen  than, say, Boiling Point.  Though seemingly stiff, Kitano's persona is  actually perfect for his movies and the more he writes himself into the  story the stronger the movie tends to be.
Violent Cop, like many of his  other films, has an extremely languid pace that you'll simply have to  accept if you're going to accept this movie on its own terms.  But the  rewards are many:  The final plot twist (including a hilarious familiar  low-angle frame of his partner walking down the street); kicking at the man  who slept with his mentally disturbed sister; playing video games; a  strange car chase.",949104000,5,1093,5.125
1236701,4,B00000JQVL,"""Beat"" Tekashi stars as Azuma, a veteran, street smart detective who has well, issues. His over the top style of interrogation has gotten him in trouble with his new boss, but that is the least of his worries.  Takeshi's signature pacing never fails to shock me. Wierd ""artsy""  scenes are suddenly interuppted with realistic ultra-violence. The tone is  very frank, and this isn't for the timid. Beat is finally getting some  attention here and it's about time.",948672000,,461,4.9480519480519485

7913210,4,B00000JQVL,"Another reviewer mentioned Kitano and his friends, in the '80's,  trashing a tabloid for reporting that he was having an affair. It made me recall an interview he gave that dealt with the period right after his serious motorcycle accident, when he was in the hospital. He said that his long-time girlfriend never showed up, during the months when he was recovering from terrible injuries; however, his wife was at the hospital all the time. This made him realize the importance of his family ties. So I guess what these two episodes mean is that Kitano didn't mind having his affairs revealed, as long as he did it HIMSELF.

Violent Cop goes further than our cosy American noirs; it's satanically black and utterly relentless. It also has a fiendish, laugh-out-loud dark humor. And in the character of Nito it creates a yakuza assassin so vicious, so sadistic, that he even kills his own henchmen for fun. His behavior shocks even his monstrous gangster boss. It's more scary, not less, that during scenes of torture and bloodshed Nito's hair never loses its hard shiny sculpted style. His sweaters continue to look pretty fresh, too.

One tiny point about Azuma's sister Akari: toward the end she's been kidnapped by Nito's thugs for only a day, tops, and they drugged her; yet in 24 hours or less she's become a raging drug addict. Is this even possible? Also, Azuma's action toward his sister at the very end seems almost impossible, since throughout the whole movie we've been shown his tender care of her. I guess we have to take it on faith that even a man of steel can snap.",1236211200,,1581,4.700361010830325
7913211,5,B00000JQVL,"This movie started out looking like a cross between Dirty Harry and Lethal Weapon, where excess force is justified in policework.  Somewhere along the way, without being explicitly told, the viewer realizes that rather than glorifying violence, the movie subtly condemns it.  This changes the movie from your typical violent cop flick to a real work of art.

My only complaint on the movie was that some of the subtitles were oversimplified or mistranslated.  (I know very little Japanese, and if there were mistakes I could catch, I only wonder about those that I didn't catch)  They were not bad enough to reduce the overall value of a fantastic movie.",1113696000,,654,4.909090909090909
7913212,5,B00000JQVL,"One of T. Kitano's first films come to life on DVD. worth the buy? Definitely! The more I learn about Takeshi Kitano, the more engrossed I become in his films. Always incredibly real and passionate, whether in comedy, action or drama. Maker of such flicks as ""Kikujiro"" , ""Hana-Bi"" and the latest box office smash ""Zatoichi"". It's interesting to learn what Takeshi has done after his amazingly popular ""Takeshi's Castle"" competitive comedy on Japanese TV. This is probably the most interesting and dare I say best directors of this era. This black comedy / action movie was later remade into a Hollywood Cult movie ""Bad Lieutenant"", starring Harvey Kietel.

7913213,5,B00000JQVL,"Takeshi Kitano plays Azuma, a cop dirtier than Harry (""Dirty Harry"") as he's decided that the world truly has descended into anarchy -- an anarchy the results of law or its lack of true enforcement.  Taking justice into his own hands (literally), Azuma achieves results but (inevitably) not without a cost of his own.
VIOLENT COP is a picture of quiet brilliance, and the intelligence is found largely in moments of silence -- Azuma walking down the street, Azuma staring emotionlessly at a criminal before administering his own form of punishment, Azuma walking several paces ahead or behind of whomever he's with.  Once the weapons are drawn, even these moments are captured with tremendous subtlety but plenty of blood.
The film cleverly gives Azuma an adversary -- a tight-lipped assassin -- who is as violent as he is, and, once the killer offs one of Azuma's oldest colleagues, a clashing of polar opposites is inevitable ... and well worth the 103 minute wait.",1070755200,4,967,4.92638036809816
7913214,4,B00000JQVL,"As the title suggests, it is about a violent policeman. The film starts with violence and ends with violence. But it isn't constant.
For those who don't know Japanese films, and want to try them out. This is a good one to start with. This film has many suprises in store, especialy to those who are used to the way that Hollywood makes films. It is a film that has both ultra-violence and Zen style serenity, all in a row. Not something that Hollywood does much.
Then theres Kitano himself. His wooden expressions actully make the film better rather than worse. There is also a certain darkness to his character Asuma that is almost Satanic, but at the same time there is allways some reason behind his actions. Even worse, is you find yourself agreeing with him.
Perhaps that is where the film's main power lies. It's ability to bring out your own darker instincts. It did more to make me scared of myself than Asuma or the Yakuza.
There is also a weird kind of humour to it. Again probably an another instinct brought up to the surface.
I'm certainly going to get some more Jap-Films. It is such a break from the predictability of Hollywood.
I wonder if Hollywood is starting to look at Japanese films? There are some interesting tricks to learn from them.",1041811200,3,1258,4.546255506607929
7913215,4,B00000JQVL,"Takeshi Kitano hits all the right notes in Violent Cop.  Brutal at times, this is the movie about THE TERMINATOR made human.  The movie has all the attitude you could ever hope for and smooth technique too boot! Takeshi's deft touch on character are someting to be prized. This is really one of my favorite movies and easily my favorite from Takeshi.",1039564800,,350,4.629032258064516
7913216,5,B00000JQVL,"Takeshi ""Beat"" Kitano has gained notoriety and acclaim in Japan as well as a large fanbase in the States, mainly due to his unique genre of films and his uncompromising vision and style.
Kitano does a great job in all of his films in protraying the brutal and violent world of the Yakuza, usually playing a character that seems cold at first but eventually having some amount of humanity in him. A common theme I have noticed in many Kitano films is the ""unhappy ending"". No peaches and cream here folks.
The title Violent Cop sums it up pretty nicely. Kitano plays Azuma, a cop who goes beyond the line that cops cannot cross legally. The movie is much deeper than the title suggests, however, because there are underlying themes of humanity, honor, and consequence. Tarantino has nothing on Takeshi, and after watching Violent Cop you can see why. Not many can pull off cold and brutal as well as Kitano can, and his characters are always intriguing.
This film isn't Kitano's best, but it's up there with ""Fireworks"" and ""Sonatine"". If you've seen Kitano's recent U.S. film ""Brother"", you'll love ""Violent Cop"", because it is more raw and disturbing, yet wonderful at the same time.",1034899200,3,1184,4.752427184466019
7913217,4,B00000JQVL,"~Directing; staring;writing, Beat Takeshi does it all and by far makes films that are supreme in the world of cinema and Beat Takeshi's Violent Cop is no exception.
Begining the film Takeshi, a hardened and ruthless cop,enters the home of a young teenager that, having witnessed it and doing nothing to stop it, Takeshi forces him to confess hi killing of an old tramp. This is where we see Kitano fully as a cold and ruthless man. After this Kitano continues with his normal police life and finds~~ that one of his only friends is no the take of criminals. As he continues to investigate the crimes of the criminal lord a hitman, who is just as cold and ruthless as Kitano himself, as well as being psycotic, is sent after him.
The story unfolds as Kitano beats up the criminals to a bloodey pulp; takes care of his mentaly-slow sister; is watched over and contasted with the young and hopeful police man that he is partnered with; and continues to pursue the criminal lord.
The end result,~~ as Kitano is thrown off the force and left to the psycotic revenge of the hitman, is bloodey and unforgetable as they go head to head against each other being as they am one ruthless man to another.
Violent Cop is wonderfuly directed and is as cold as it spectacular, Beat Takeshi not only delivers pioneering direction but also makes a trade-mark acting role that by my standards is a cult classic. Fans of original and creative film-making will love this film and to those that do enjoy the~~ film I would also advise that they watch 'Hana-Bi', or Fire Works; 'Sonatine'; and 'Boiling Point'.~",1003276800,3,1589,4.618374558303887
