8229113,4,B000XQ1OX8,"Well done, unexpected adventure to a quiet side of British History, we would very much like to do this trip.",1391731200,,108,4.45
8229114,5,B000XQ1OX8,"A brief history of UK canals, a briefer instruction on navigating our boat and then off we glide through the countryside at four MPH. Lots of scenery and a gentle patter both informative and humorous from our narrator. Spotlight visits to Chester, Edinburgh, Inverness, the Falkirk Wheel (a late 20th Century mechanical marvel) and the Wedgewood factory. A few interviews (just a word or two) along the way provide the human touch. I don't think that anyone could be disappointed with this purchase.",1277769600,7,499,5.024096385542169
