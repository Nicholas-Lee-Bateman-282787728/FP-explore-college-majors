1712186,2,B00006675R,"This version of a famous Russian work is described in the production notes as a ""delightful comedy.""  According to the DVD box, the Chicago Tribune critic called it ""Great Fun!""  In fact, this is a very sick, sad, nasty piece of drama filled with frustrated passions and alcoholic ravings.  The best it can be called is soap opera.  Yes, the acting is good, and the photography is, at times, attractive.  (The setting is central Australia.)  But don't expect to laugh, or even smile.  The bitter taste left by this film may last for days.",1149897600,8,538,4.659574468085107

7962058,4,B00006675R,"The case was not the best, no biggy.  The DVD was in perfect condition. The movie is not one of my favorites but I am a big fan of Sam Neill so it fits into my library of romance movies very well.  Oh, unrequited love.",1464307200,,218,3.8222222222222224
7962059,5,B00006675R,I laughed and enjoyed the DVD.  I would recommend it to anyone who would love a good laugh and great cast.,1388620800,,106,4.0476190476190474
7962060,5,B00006675R,"All of the characters are wonderful but Jack and Sally are our favorites because they are the most reliable and honest and sincere in contrast to their relatives from England.  I know exactly how Jack feels when he bursts out with, ""I've wasted my entire life!!""",1356912000,,262,4.695652173913044
7962061,5,B00006675R,"This classic has been unobtainable for a while now, and we were making do with a poor quality videotape.  It was brilliant to be able to purchase this excellent DVD and fully appreciate and enjoy the glory of this outrageous comedy. Video and sound quality are both excellent. The writing, characters, direction and acting are the best that they could possibly be. Buy this, watch it and be captivated!",1329091200,,402,4.826086956521739
7962062,4,B00006675R,An excellent adventure romantic light comedy.  Very fine acting by all.  I'm not sure the characters are match to the actors as well as in Camilla or O Brother where art thou!  But still I recommend it especially if you don't mind the accents (Australian-type).,1240876800,,261,4.7555555555555555
7962063,5,B00006675R,"This is Michael Blakemore's Australianised version of 'Uncle Vanya', Chekhov's comedy of frustrated provincial life with its ludicrous but painful self-oppression.  It's set in the lovely Hunter Valley of NSW and its verdant pastoral landscape looks gorgeous filmed in saturated painterly colours. The characters are adapted slightly (as is the script) to make the story work for Australia just after the Great War.  The cultural moment is the realisation that Australia is going to have to shed its imaginative and political domination by all things English.  Blakemore's intelligence and wit and his own keen expatriate's vision are razor-sharp and compassionate. The film analyses the colonial attitudes of his own class and generally charts the fatal inter-locking of provincial insecurity and imperial delusions.  Just watch for the hilariously awful sequence starting with a brightly coloured rosella feasting on a flowering tree....

Blakemore himself ended up playing the grand writer (Chekhov's Professor) who (supposedly) Made It in England: he gives a precise comical dissection of self-important fatuity.  Greta Scacchi is the Helena figure, his trophy wife who stirs up the male hormones.  Sam Neill is the sexy Doctor Astrov character: the region's voice of progress but a cynical and disillusioned individual; and Kerry Fox is Sonya, the put-upon daughter who pines for the Doctor but actually keeps the property running.  Watch for a young Tom Long in a small role, and the wonderful Googie Withers as the crafty Irish house-keeper who firmly and wisely rules the estate while dishing up to the grand folk endless mutton meals in every tasteless variation. But the star performance for me is the late John Hargreaves as the Vanya character: his extrovert interpretation has to be a career best.

As an Australian film 'Country Life'does indeed lack all those 'international' local colour staples of man-eating crocs (or toothy sharks, or killer dingos) - not a psychopathic bush murderer or menacing redneck is to be seen!  Instead we see a lush landscape with the mansions of the wealthy rural Australian ruling faction of the era.  But it's smart, intelligent and no reverently corseted 'period movie.  Fans of adapted Chekhov or of any member of Blakemore's uniformly great cast will adore 'Country Life'; which makes the story what Chekhov called it - a comedy.

For a reference point you might like to get hold of the National Theatre video of Chekhov's play in the 1963 production, with the great performer Michael Redgrave at his peak as Vanya and Olivier as the Doctor, plus a flawless cast.",1224288000,9,2615,5.2272727272727275
7962064,2,B00006675R,"I expected something light and romantic, but with the substance the Australians are known for (Strictly Ballroom, Murial's Wedding, for instance).  Tedious, boring, depressing, and in no way funny.  Barely watchable despite big stars and good acting.",1212364800,4,250,5.72972972972973
7962065,3,B00006675R,"Chekhov's play Uncle Vanya is herein indirectly translated to the big screen and its setting is altered to that of post-World War One Australia in this moderately successful tale of unrequited love, carnal attraction, off-center politics, and the bored desperation that roils behind even the most outwardly contended of lives. While Michael Blakemore's film grabs freely at will a number of lines from Chekhov's play, the overall effect is one of imitation of the Russian master rather than direct tribute to him. Sam Neill plays his role well, as he always does, and the cast meshes nicely, it's just that Country Life might've possessed more gravitas had it been a stand-alone production without the tenuous connections to the Chekhov play.",1196812800,5,742,5.191666666666666
7962066,4,B00006675R,"The director, Michael Blakemore, takes an artistic gamble by loosely adapting Anton Chekhov's play, Uncle Vanya, to Australia. It works on his terms, with Blakemore doing a fine job as the returning native son. Greta Scacchi, whose effect on the locals as his new and young wife is presented in an effective fashion, also performs well. The direction is somewhat uneven and, as a result, the cast does not achieve an ensemble effect so important for the filmization/adaptation. Sam Neill, as is customary, plays Sam Neill. However, Kerry Fox, a brilliant actress, shines. The production design and costumes are nicely and accurately created. In sum, Blakemore does not attempt to go beyond the perimeter of the original masterwork by Chekhov who, after all, is the originator of the ""slice of life"" genre.",1155427200,3,805,5.106060606060606
