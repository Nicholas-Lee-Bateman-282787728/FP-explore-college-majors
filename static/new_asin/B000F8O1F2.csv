 I find it difficult to believe that the seller did not already know this when he sent it to my American address.
Even if he was ignorant of what he was selling, it is no excuse for not checking it out first, before placing the DVD onto the market.",1451952000,,315,4.25
8119088,4,B000F8O1F2,"I really enjoyed this entertaining and engaging little-known indie film, also released as ALL THE WAY. The story seems romanticized in its view of Frank Sinatra's major dust up with the Aussie press. But it actually happened. Dennis Hopper's performance does sell the story while, at the same time, can be a bit distracting--simply because Hopper bears so little physical resemblance to the legendary crooner. What also makes the film worthwhile is a solid line-up of Australian players now familiar to American audiences, including Rose Byrne who was so dynamic in FX's DAMAGES and Portia DiRossi, better known for her great comic turn in ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT. Hearing them emote in their native accents, reminds us how easily Aussie thespians can handle our American inflections. Another fine player is Joel Edgerton as the young promoter who bets all his dreams on getting Ol Blue Eyes to perform down under. Recommended.",1357257600,,924,5.208053691275167
