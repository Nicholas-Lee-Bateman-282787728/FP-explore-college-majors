Can't wait for the next season to come out!!",1171238400,2,259,4.224489795918367
2669952,5,B000JBWWOC,"I THINK THERE ARE NOT MANY SHOWS ON TELEVISION TODAY THAT COULD COME CLOSE TO WHAT THE WALTONS BROUGHT TO MANY AMERICANS WHEN IT WAS TELEVISED MANY YEARS AGO. I THINK THAT IF THERE WERE SHOWS LIKE THE WALTONS ON TELEVISION TODAY OUR KIDS WOULD NOT NEARLY HAVE THE STRUGGLES THAT THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH ON A DAILY BASIS. ONE EXCEPTION TO THIS WOULD BE SEVENTH HEAVEN OTHER THAN THAT TELEVISION HAS CROSSED A BOUNDARY THAT WOULD NOT BEEN TOLERATED SAY 30 YEARS AGO.

2669953,4,B000JBWWOC,"Having just purchased ""The Waltons complete fourth season,"" I wanted to add a few comments to those already on this site. This show was still in its element in season four. My favorite season happens to be season five because there are some great shows involving the central character of John-Boy, including his newspaper article on ""Mein Kampf"" which turns the community upside down, and the Hindenburg story as well. He also achieves his goal of having his novel published in the last episode of season five. For those who think the show is not worth watching after this, remember that Richard Thomas returns in season six for three episodes near the end of the season and the final show of season six is ""Grandma Comes Home,"" which is also Will Geer's last appearance, as he died shortly after this episode aired. I gave this set four stars instead of five, because I noticed a cut scene in ""The Fledgling."" In the original airing John-Boy, overworked, falls asleep in class and Professor Parks speaks with him afterwards. In the DVD, it cuts right to Professor Parks talking to him so I don't know if they had a bad tape or what happened, but I sure hope no other episodes were trimmed. At any rate, ""The Waltons"" is still loved and its loyal fans recently convinced The Hallmark Chanel to air the show again after it was briefly taken off. That says it all.",1170460800,6,1362,4.609053497942387
2669954,5,B000JBWWOC,".....and to you naysayers out there, forget the lame-duck 7th Heaven as well.  Not only is this one of the best family TV classics to ever hit the airwaves, it also happens to be, for the record, one of the most outstanding, well-crafted, poignant, family-oriented shows EVER.  They know how to avoid cliches (where the Bradys cannot) and (sorry, again) know how to be BOTH sincere AND endearing WITHOUT being lame or watering it down (where 7th Heaven always seems to excel at).  Plus, they also know how to show a little more pickup (where Little House can't; it's not at all lame, but does tend to drag on).

Sure, they even have their own disputes and squabbles amongst themselves, but also without turning it into something downright nasty, brutal, or patronizing.  So, having said all that, this is definitely one classic TV show which will always deserve a special place in my heart. ;)

2669955,4,B000JBWWOC,"The age of innocence is long gone from America TV. I grew up in the 1960's and remember the days of family-friendly television.  Remember those great family shows that every member of the family could enjoy -  The Andy Griffith Show, The Dick Van Dyke Show, That Girl, Father Knows Best, Leave It To Beaver, and Ozzie and Harriet?  A few family-friendly shows remained in the 1970's: The Partridge Family, The Brady Bunch, and best of all ... The Waltons.  Since the Waltons left TV in the early 1980's there have been very few quality tv shows the entire family can watch and enjoy together (""The Wonder Years"" stands out as one of these).  Since the days of adult-oriented ""Dallas"" and other similar sleazy sex melodramas, the major tv networks have been set on corrupting and ridiculing the strong family values that made America a once-great and proud nation.

Thank goodness for The Waltons!  The Waltons is a series that everyone in the family can sit down and enjoy together.  Parents can relax because there is no cursing or foul language, no double-entendre sex jokes, no graphic violence, just real characters growing up in a much more innocent age than we currently live in.  (For a look at how our grandparents grew up, watch the Waltons).

In Season Four of the series, 24 episodes are presented, all of them being quality family enertainment.  I have my favorite episodes of season 4 and you will too - there is much to like about this season.  John-boy grows closer to graduation from college and begins a newspaper, Mary-Ellen begins her first steps in her nursing career, Ben grows into a young man with strong ideas of his own, and of course there is always the steady presence of the parents and grandparents, guiding this large family through the trying years of the Great Depression.

While my favorite Waltons season is the very first, there is still so much to treasure in this fourth season.  The acting is superb, with Michael Learned winning an Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a drama series, and the perpetually old and cranky Ellen Corby winning an Emmy for supporting actress.  (Does anyone recall Ellen Corby playing anything other than an old lady or Grandma? - I can only recall one role as a pioneering farming homesteader in the movie ""Shane"" ).  Richard Thomas binds this series together, being the person from which the stories are being told.  When Richard Thomas leaves the show after season five, the series loses its central focus.  And while the series still remains entertaining after season five, the loss of John-Boy is imposible to overcome.

I heartily recommend Season Four of the Waltons.  It is something your family can watch and learn important life-lessons from, a far-cry from today's tv viewing options.

2669956,5,B000JBWWOC,"While we are getting ready to say goodbye to John Boy in the 5th season (not this 4th season), every episode deserves 5 stars.  I loved this show growing up (high school) and can watch reruns forever.  I'm planning on purchasing all seasons, as I treasure every episode.  This is my all time favorite television show and, I think, always will be.",1165968000,36,346,4.548387096774194
2669957,5,B000JBWWOC,"I love this series.  I just wish they would get them out faster.  Every year when we buy them, we will lay in bed at night and watch one episode.

I wish they would release them all or at least release one every 4 or 6 months.  I have no patience...",1165363200,34,386,3.8227848101265822
2669958,5,B000JBWWOC,"There were many great seasons of this special show, but season four is the best IMO. Standout episodes include:

The Sermon - John Boy is asked to preach Sunday services and he gets plenty of coaching from proud Grandma.

The Competition - Ben gets angry and leaves just as the Waltons get into a competition for a huge contract.

The Search - Story by Ellen Corby (Grandma) Olivia, Jim Bob and Elizabeth are lost in the woods after a car accident.

The Fox - Grandpa's war stories don't quite live up to the truth.

The Burnout - The family is scattered after the house burns down.

The Quiliting - Tensions flare between Grandma, Olivia and Mary Ellen after Grandma plans a quilting party to announce Mary Ellen is ready for courting.

The House - Grandma and Grandpa are on different sides of the county's decision to tear down an old house.",1164067200,71,844,4.549668874172186

Then I came across this series and remembered how much she loved this show, but only the seasons when the kids were young, before Maryellen got married. As a surprise I bought her only the first 5 seasons. She cried when she got them as she was so happy and couldn't wait to watch them. She just loves these DVD's and I catch myself watching them with her too remembering the episodes from years ago. Needless to say my mom is very happy with them and I'm happy that I made her happy!

They really knew how to communicate with one another.  They would face a problem or concern head on.  No beating around the bush.  A friend back then  was truly your friend.

That I ordered the entire set.  My children never had the opertunity to watch it's first run, only reruns.  Here is family entertainment at it's best.  You watch the trials and tribulation of day to day living during and after the depression.  What made this series so special is that things sometimes did not turn out well.  Nothing here is sugar coated,when I watched this show with my father (who vividly remembered the depression) it would sometimes bring a tear to his eyes and always a smile.  So if you are looking for a window to a diffrent time, a diffrent way of life this is it.
Just be aware that the T.V. movie collection offered has a diffrent actor playing John-Boy in two of the films.

My only regret is that the DVD's are printed on both sides, thus subjecting them to more wear and tear. I am very careful in handling them but still some episodes inevitably get dirty or scratched and skip and jump. I guess this is unavoidable. I have watched all six seasons at least four times.

The show gives us a look into a simple, loving way of life we can all choose to create even in this complex 21st Century, if, of course, we see the value of it.  My grandsons will be watching the series with me in the years ahead and we'll be talking about the depth and beauty of the relationships so genuinely portrayed there.  I can hardly wait.

2670217,4,B000JBWWOC,My wife was thrilled to get the 4th season of the Waltons. It has become her favorite gift to ask for. I don't know what will happen when she gets them all.....I guess we'll start over with season 1.  Merry Christmas!!!,1198454400,,219,4.341463414634147
2670218,4,B000JBWWOC,"I think the Waltons is pretty much a good show, its got some corny episode's, like the one where Liz, Elizabeth, and Jim-bob get lost in the forest I think that one is a little overboard, but you get wrapped up with the characters, everyone has a favorite.

The acting is quite good, of coarse when things started too change with the actors in the later seasons, specifically John-boy, I think they should have just stopped.

I used to enjoy Little House on the Prairie, and its still a sweet-heartwarming family show but I got tired of it as time grew on and enjoy the Waltons now, as my old time good quality show.
I think many will enjoy the Waltons and fall in love with the characters.",1191801600,,690,4.3828125
2670219,5,B000JBWWOC,"Season 4 follows the Walton clan as they begin to mature and explore more of the outside world. Eldest son John-Boy, now a sophomore at Boatwright College, is a stringer for a local newspaper.

Second eldest son Jason, always musically gifted, has won a scholarship to study music. Meanwhile, eldest daughter Mary Ellen plans to study nursing after graduating from high school this year, while the younger children also follow their own individual pursuits.

Possibly the most memorable episode of Season 4 is ""The Burnout,"" a two-hour special featuring a fire that ravages the Walton home, and the devastating aftermath -- both physical and emotional -- as the family struggles to rebuild their previous existence.

Other key episodes include ""The Sermon,"" where John-Boy is asked to be a guest speaker at church while the Rev. Fordwick is away on his honeymoon, and mother Olivia subs at the school in place of his wife, the former Miss Hunter. In ""The Prophecy,"" dad John is full of anguish at the approach of his 25th high school reunion, under the delusion that his life is nowhere near as successful as those of his classmates.

Although this show is set in the 1930s, the plots and characters' struggles ring as true as if they were happening today. Who among us can't relate to job and financial struggles, whether they be the result of the Depression or downsizing? Who hasn't had dreams and goals of becoming someone successful, just like John-Boy with his writing and Jason with his music?

If you've never watched The Waltons, I urge you to start from Season 1. You'll quickly become enmeshed in this closeknit family's struggles and joys, and look forward to seeing their lives unfold. And, if you've been watching the previous seasons, you certainly won't be disappointed in this one!",1188864000,5,1798,4.920792079207921

2670226,2,B000JBWWOC,"Now don't get the wrong impression of my rating because this is an excellent family show and it gets 5 stars it that area, but the 2 rating is my opinion of the poor way that this quality show was put on DVD.. First i noticed that this is a bare bones transfer with no extras but you would think since we are paying good money for these dvds that they would at least make sure the trasnfer quality from film to dvd is excellent, but sadly its not, it seems like there was not much care taken in the transfer process. Let me explain, during the opening music i noticed that it fades in and out something that i did not notice in the previous 3 seasons. Also on a few episodes i just watched, it appears like there was little cleaning up of the film done before transfer to get rid of all the spots or floaters that sometimes appear on older films, it would have been nice if the time was taken to remaster the film for good dvd viewing. It also would have been nice to include a closed caption feature for the hearing impaired for those who need it. In closing i really enjoy watching the Waltons and I am very pleased to have it on DVD, but if a little more care and extra work was put into the transfer process this could be so much better and i would feel i am getting the most for my money spent...",1177459200,19,1301,4.0859375

2670228,5,B000JBWWOC,"I've purchased seasons one through four as they've become available. There isn't a bad show in the bunch. The acting and writing during all four years is superb. The setting is sublime. Every storyline shows how people with morals confront the daily issues of life. Every storyline shows how people with strong family ties and strong family values deal with important issues of their daily lives.

The characters of season four have remained true to the personalities we began to love in the first season. John-Boy, Olivia, grandpa, grandma, Jason and John were superbly cast and are amazingly talented actors. By season four the viewer knows these characters as if they were friends or neighbors.

The writing and dialogue of this show is simply superb. Seldom if ever does the viewer find themselves wondering what's going on in a scene; in fact, its just the opposite. The acting and writing are so extraordinary that one cannot help but feel they have actually experienced the events... just as the Waltons have!

While season two is my favorite season, my all-time favorite Walton's show was during season four. ""The Fledgling"" is the second to last show of a very good season. The ups,downs and ultimate vindication of doing the right thing seen during The Fledgling are sure to keep any viewer rivited to their TV screen.",1176768000,6,1328,4.919642857142857

2670235,5,B000JBWWOC,"My opinion of The Waltons series is 99.9% on the positive side, so first I'll mention a slightly negative aspect encountered with the series, namely very slight inconsistencies with an otherwise strong and diverse story line. The only examples I can think of--which says much for such a long-running series--were found between season 1's The Star, season 2's The Awakening, and season 3's The Statue. The closing monologue in season 2's The Awakening has John-Boy reminiscing about Mary Ellen's adult life and the fact she had married a university professor and was the mother of two boys, whereas in later seasons she was married to doctors and, in one episode, was injured, keeping her from having any more children than son John Curtis. The other inconsistency had to do with Grandpa Walton's requested gravesite on the side of Walton's Mountain in season 1's The Star, and season 3's projected gravesite in The Statue. In the latter episode Grandpa and Grandma had an argument over the placement of a statue Grandpa had won in a raffle. He wanted it placed over their future burial site in a local cemetery, which was located on flat land surrounded by shady trees. However, after Grandpa's death--made necessary due to actor Will Geer's actual death--whenever they showed his burial place it was on a sunny slope of Walton's mountain, which had been requested in season 1's The Star. To me these were niggling things that pointed out the importance of thinking through, planning, and maintaining a story line regardless of creative impulses urging otherwise.

On the mostly positive side I believe that, as the years and generations pass, the importance of having recorded The Waltons series will become increasingly evident and appreciated, perhaps even studied in the classroom. Earl Hamner's spirit of family life totally infuses the series with a love and family communion almost impossible to achieve these days in real life due to the myriad influences bent on tearing families apart. The longer The Waltons series ran the more these influences began showing themselves within the series itself and, perhaps more poignantly, within the lives of the actors who played the roles. I seriously doubt it would be possible to recreate the series today, so the fact that it exists at all, and can easily be obtained, should be a boon to future generations. It will be there for anyone who feels a need to expose others to a family where children loved--and loved being with--their parents, grandparents, and each other, were equally loved in return, and were mentored empathetically and in healthy directions by honorable and honored members of the older generation.

On a personal level, I'm not sure how my life would have turned out if it hadn't been for exposure to The Waltons, even if only through TV. Coming from a typical, modern, dysfunctional family, complete with paternal infidelity, divorce, and a parade of stepmothers, I needed this vicarious relationship with a family much closer to the idyllic norm. The Waltons not only exposed me to familial love and mutual cooperation/sensitivity that was hard to find at home, but also encouraged my love of writing, which, perhaps not too surprisingly, has found vent in stories about relatives and histories of my ancestors, where I've occasionally found people like the Waltons in my own family tree.",1173744000,9,3363,5.057657657657658

2670239,5,B000JBWWOC,"I have enjoyed these series since they came out on TV in the 70's. My kids loved to watch them and now my granddaughter is watching them. Somehow that big family makes you feel a part of them. Excellent shows for adults and children.  Teaches moral values for today's generation.  Also some of the actors bring back memories for me. Grandma Walton (Ellen Corby) can be seen in an earlier movie named ""I Remember Mama"" .  She was nominated for best supporting actress in that movie. She appeared in other movies as well.  Will Geer (Grandpa)affectionately called old fool by Ellen Corby in this show was always full of mischief and could always be counted on for a good laugh yet he was portrayed as a mountain of strength to the Walton Clan as compared to the mountain that is usually seen at the beginning of every show. I can hear the children ( John Boy,Mary Ellen,Jason,Ben, Erin, Jim Bob and Elizabeth) at the close of the day when everyone is in bed  waiting to go to sleep telling each other goodnight . Olivia ((Michael Learned)and John (Ralph Waite) the mother and father in this movie are portrayed the loving parents but stern when discipline is needed.  Olivia's goal was to see all her children baptized in the Baptist Church as well as their father who stubbornly refuses to go to church. But is always is shown as a man who worshiped God in his own way. The Baldwin Sisters and the recipe , Ike and Cora Beth Godsey, Yancey Tucker, Sheriff Ep Bridges and many others help make this show come alive.  Earl Hamner who wrote the book Spencer's Mountain can always be heard in narration. If you like the Walton's series then you must watch the movie Spencer's Mountain with Henry Fonda and Maureen O'Hara .",1173312000,2,1717,4.555194805194805

2670243,5,B000JBWWOC,"As with ""The Homecoming"" and Seasons 1-3, ""The Waltons"" Season 4 is high quality, excellent, family entertainment (and this is coming from a currently single/divorced 33 year old man).  I like this season a bit more than the 3rd to be honest.

This show is ""addictive"" in the best sense of the word.  If you haven't sat down with John, Olivia (Liv), Zebulon (Zeb), Esther, John Boy, Jason, Mary Ellen, Ben, Erin, Jim Bob, and Elizabeth, (and Ike Godsey)...its about time to pull up a chair.

Writing and acting of this caliber should not be missed.  To know what I'm talking about, you'll have to experience this show for yourself.

If I ever have a family of my own (again)...this fictional family (based off of series creator Earl Hamner's own family) will definitely be THE model.

***This show contains strong morality, wholesomeness, religious/spiritual views on life (and more)***

Ralph Waite's (John Walton Sr.) acting is superb in every way to me.  The rest of the cast is good/great in their respective roles, but Waite is the stand out to me.

I've got Season 5 preordered (can't wait).

It is full of love, understanding, caring, faith and a sense of intelligence not seen in this country in years. I love this show and I am so glad it is available on Amazon prime.  I watch these episodes many times and never stop feeling entertained.  I do not watch any shows on cable or the networks.  I find them full of sex, violence and characters that are self absorbed and lack depth.  It instills the negative aspects of life in children.  The Walton's instilled the positive aspects of human nature. That is what children need to see, that is what we all need to see. TV influences us in many ways.  We are what we eat is a saying.  Well we are what we watch is true. I choose to watch the best show that was ever on TV.  What fine writing and acting.  Will Geer was grandpa, Richard Thomas gave us a view of a young man filled with compassion, love and empathy.  Ralph Waite and Michael Learned were so real as the parents. Ellen Corby gave the show flavor and she was fun to watch.  I love Jon Walmsley and Eric Scott.  Mary Beth McDonough,, Kami Cotler, and David Harper were wonderful as well. Judy Taylor was my least favorite. Not a fan of hers or Mary Ellen. Joe Conley and Ronnie Claire Edwards were so heart warming  as Ike and Cora Beth.  The Baldwin sisters, Ep Bridges, Yantzee Tucker, Miss Hunter were all supporting roles that helped make this a great show.  The actors who played these characters were equally great. Thanks to the late Earl Hamner for not giving up and making this show a winner. The writers were all wonderful as well.
