2534231,5,B000EU1Q0Y,"That's what happened many times watching UFOs on this DVD from raw video footage (some of it from NASA missions I've never seen) just materialize in the day and night skies...wow, Aykroyd is entertaining as usual and reveals a surprising academic side peppered with his patented wit...Really awesome.",1149638400,4,300,5.270833333333333
2534232,5,B000EU1Q0Y,I love this DVD and am showing it to all of my friends.  Especially the ones who think I'm cracked cuz I believe we are not alone in the Universe.  There are FLYING SAUCERS on this in BROAD DAYLIGHT!!!  Can't be fake.  A must have for any UFO library.,1149638400,5,251,4.061224489795919
2534233,5,B000EU1Q0Y,"I've never been a big UFO buff but I'm a big fan of Aykroyd so this is the first ""UFO"" video I have ever purchased.  The NASA and other UFO video footage on this DVD is extraordinary.  Also, to watch former NASA Astronaut Gordon Cooper testify about his multiple ""close encounter"" eyewitness accounts and a former Canadian Defense Minister refer to UFOs as being ""as real as the airplanes that fly over your head"" was very impressive.  Over all, it's stunning.",1149638400,6,460,4.654320987654321

2534235,2,B000EU1Q0Y,"The sound editing is very unprofessional on this CD.  The background music and sound effects often drown out the voices of those being interviewed.  How could this be overlooked before release?  The UFO clips are repeated too often and I was disapointed with the meager amount of content.

2534249,2,B000EU1Q0Y,"Well I admit it was quite the spook fest watching this. It definitely made me more mistrusting towards people however the reason I scored this so low is because of the following story......

Let me start this out by saying that I am a modern man who loves celebritites. They are like Gods amoung mere ants. There is nothing I wouldn't do for a celebrity, the higher the status the more I am willing to do. So when I heard that Aykers
(Yeah I'm on a nickname name basis with Dan) was showing up in my town I could barely think straight!

Aykers was showing up at a local liquor store to promote his beautiful and elogant tasting new Vodka brand, which came in a fun skull head! I showed up at the liqour store two days before he was scheduled to arrive. I kept out of sight so that no one would see me and when the day finally arrived I stood proudly in front of the doors waiting for them to open! I was there before Aykers had even arrived so that meant he would have to pass me. Finally his stretch hummer limo  showed up and out he came walking towards...towards me!

Aykers had two guards on either side of him as he walked up to the entrance I managed to stick my arm out and brush his shoulder! I could not describe to you in human words what that felt like. It was like for that brief moment in time I was apart of his world...I was somebody. Though that quickly wore off, and three hours later they opened to the doors to the public. I made an immediate b-line to Aykers. I walked with my arms straight out at my side to make sure no one passed me on the way. When I came face to face with him at his table I told him what a fan of celebrities I was and that seeing him in person was like seeing God! I then had him sign four of his Vodka skulls that I wished to purchased. I wanted to stay there for hours, I wanted time to just stop for everyone except Aykers and I but the ""help"" were already trying to usher me off. Before I left I told Aykers how much this had meant to me and if there was anything I could do for him. When he said no I offered him a tugjob behind the grocer across the street.

Here's where things go wrong.

Aykers looked at me hard, his purple tinted glasses had fallen to the bridge of his noise. I watched in horror as his face twisted in confusion then into anger. He told me to get beep out of here you beeeping freak! Before I could react I found myself in the checkout line. Everything seemed silent and everyone was looking at me. I wanted die! I ran to my car that was hidden in a bramble batch a little ways down the road and drank all four of the vodka skulls. How could he turn me down like that? How could he be so mean and vile? I had become quite the philosopher and just started questioning everything.

Eventually I moved on to other celebrities but the memories still haunt me. That's why I only gave this video 2 stars....I just... see his face....and....remember.

Oh and still have the skulls. I like to role play with them!",1390867200,,2977,4.111876075731497
2534250,1,B000EU1Q0Y,What a waste of money this was.  It's Dan Aykroyd talking about various UFO incidents.  Nothing new; no new spin on investigations.  I don't know what I was thinking when I bought this.,1385683200,,185,4.545454545454546
2534251,5,B000EU1Q0Y,"Don't ask me WHY, but I seem to TRUST Dan Aykroyd. Don't think it's because he was on SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE,
in my distant youthful-20s; nor has it anything to do with his steller movie career. Maybe it's because his last name sounds,
ALMOST, alien... well, anyway, in this film it is almost as though he ISN'T telling me everything he knows... who ya gonna call?
I called Dan Aykroyd, and he delivered... what ""they"" WANT us to know. Hmmmmm!

I enjoyed THIS documentry more than the others. I bought a used one, because a new one costs as much as my '52 Buick,

2534253,5,B000EU1Q0Y,"Coming from Dan Ackroyd growing up with all of his scientific movie's. Ghostbusters and the like, it was extremely informative, I could feel.everything he was saying wad truthful and I never knew he smoked.

2534254,5,B000EU1Q0Y,"I've always enjoyed Aykroyd's humor in his movies but this is the first time I took him seriously. So he does have a serious side!? Enjoyed it very much but after all, I AM a believer.",1362182400,,184,4.138888888888889
2534255,5,B000EU1Q0Y,"I enjoy watching UFO documentaries and this is so far the best one I've seen.
The footage included of UFO's is some of the most realistic I've ever seen and Dan Akroyd is a thoughtful and serious commentator who makes some very intelligent comments and observations.

This subject has an abundance of poorly done half baked documentaries, most notible one I recently saw produced by Steven Greer, who brought out lots of authors of books with varying theories, including ones who quoted Genesis.

My favorite scene in this documentary is of an astronaut performing a space walk, tethered to his space capsule, while his companions inside the craft notice a UFO nearby.  They call his attention to it and say ""did you see that?""  The space walking astonaut replies he doesn't see anything and asks what they are talking about and they lie to him and say it was just a lens cap that came loose, ""nothing to worry about"". There's no sense in causing alarm in a man in a space suit tethered to his space capsule by a thin cable, by letting him know a UFO is hovering near him.

Dan Akroyd is to be commended for putting his beliefs in UFO's out there and letting the world see that he gives this subject serious thought.  He comes across as very intelligent and well spoken.

It was nice to finally see a very well done thought provoking documentary on this important subject.",1344384000,,1372,4.598360655737705
2534256,4,B000EU1Q0Y,"For those who think that Dan is just a comedian, well, you're wrong.  This guy has some brains and he knows his material on the UFO issue.  This video is well done, but it does get a little ""draggy"" in spots.  Overall, very good.  It's nice to see a ""Hollywood type"" stick his neck out on such a controversial subject.",1293580800,4,318,4.25
2534277,4,B000EU1Q0Y,"5 Stars based on the understanding that this is an impromptu conversation filmed on the spot.
Dan Aykroyd has always presented himself as intelligent as well as funny.
And one would assume that, given his on camera involvement with the topic, that he would be very informed.
This fascinating interview astonishes none-the-less as he weaves many layers of information, history, and
ideas to make some extremely credible statements.
I am new to this topic having researched seriously for only about a year but I learned a great deal in an hour and a half from Aykroyd.",1291334400,2,566,4.90625
2534278,1,B000EU1Q0Y,Neither Dan Akroyd nor David Sereda have any scientific training or background.  This is pure pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo.  This is the type of material that continues to keep the topic and phenomenon of unidentified flying objects from study by real scientists.,1264636800,3,264,5.575
2534279,5,B000EU1Q0Y,"Being a casual fan of Aykroyd over the years I was surprised to see him giving a serious interview about UFO's.  He definitely seems to be an expert on the subject with his matter of fact attitude when describing the evidence of sightings and abductions.  He is obviously a hard core fan of the subject, which made me more interested in the video.

The video is well done and gives much information from around the world on the topic of UFO's and abductions.  Aykroyd even goes into multi-dimensions as a means of possible visitors.  Being a healer for a living this bit of information caught my attention as it comes up often in my metaphysical studies.

In short the video is very entertaining and has some cool footage and info in it. The serious UFO hunter may see this as just scratching the surface, but I think in general if you are interested even a little in UFO phenomenon you will like this video. 5 stars.

2534280,5,B000EU1Q0Y,This video has some of the most compelling footage seen to date. A must have for all those who are fascinated by the UFO phenomenon.,1211760000,2,132,4.32
2534281,1,B000EU1Q0Y,"I watched this DVD a couple years ago and thought it was phenomenal and very interesting, even despite the fact that the majority of UFO photos it cuts to throughout it's length are composed mostly of Billy Meier created pictures. All of Meier's famous photos were proven to be fakes and hoaxes long ago, why Aykroyd and Sereda chose to litter their DVD with so many proven fakes is beyond me. It certainly doesn't do anything to support their argument for the existance of UFO's.
At this point I want to make it clear to the readers of this review that I am a firm believer that UFO's do in fact exist, what they are, I do not know for sure, but you won't find the answer to that question in this DVD.
Instead, if you watch this DVD, you will be treated to Aykroyd waxing scientific about his thoughts on UFO's, extraterrestrial technology and why his abismal television show Sci-Factor was canceled (he believes the men in black had something to do with it rather than the fact that the show just kind of sucked) all while chain smoking camel cigarettes.
Entertaining to say the least, however it doesn't really do much to advance the study of what UFO's are and where they come from.
Another major point of contention is the fact that Sereda and Aykroyd harp constantly on the alleged NASA UFO footage, most of which had already been debunked, and the most compelling of which was 100% proved to be false in a recent episode of UFO Hunters on the History Channel.
These facts put the majority of Sereda's investigations into question, and while I like the guy and admire his passion for getting to the truth, I fear that his tendency to believe everything he sees and take things at face value, skews his objectivity and hence puts into question all of his theories and findings.
From what I understand, Aykroyd has been working on a sequel to Unplugged on UFO's in which he will unveil supposed footage of the recent mass sighting at the Chicago O'Hare Airport. If this is true, then it might warrant a deeper look, but this DVD does not.
In the end, this DVD is worth a rental, but not a purchase, and doesn't really have much to offer the serious UFO investigator in the way of information or truth.",1210636800,3,2205,4.515
2534282,3,B000EU1Q0Y,"Yes, it's really for fans of Dan A., despite not one mirthful moment. They even had a chance to work in an ironic bit, worthy of the best of SNL: Dan postulates on an alien's ability to detect degenerated atmosphere due to human excess....while he takes a drag on the ol' cancer stick.
Yes, one of the worst inventions on terra-firma, one symbolising all kinds of devolution, physical, social, economic distress is highlighted right along with Ackroyd's well-fed kisser.
Not that he isn't a genius.
Having said all that: for about 9.99 this isn't bad at all: as I wrote, a Dan fan, will have a field day - they'll appreciate his heartfelt, emotional, intellectualizing; for the UFO package completist, there appears to be a ton of rare footage.
And what of that footage: not one frame is analyzed - it's all backdrop for Dan's impressive, obviously researched, ramblings. Like, there's no party-pooper tech.-head to say, well, those three lights keeping pace with the jet are probably reflections off the instrument panel; and the bobbing up and down disc appears to be something meterological; the thing that looks like a mile-long cigar tube...that's really a reflection off a microscopic chip either in the windshield or the camera lens.
The host is very complimentary of his guest...well, that's okay, he expresses genuine joy that this superstar seemed so happy to let himself be taped for a project from an up and coming occult documentary maker.
Sometimes that genuine emotion can lead to questions like, Dan, if you could time travel back, where would you go and what would you do. Dan's answer is actually brilliant - you know, remove one maniac and someone replaces him/her, but then here it comes: he'd want a casual confab with Dr. Al (I guess to explain to him that he should have anticipated quarks).",1207180800,,1814,4.87378640776699
2534283,5,B000EU1Q0Y,Dan Aykroyd proves himself to be a very well informed person with regard to UFOs and the alien abduction phenomenon.  It is good to know that credible and intelligent individuals such as Dan are telling us their beliefs on this matter.,1196208000,,235,4.7317073170731705

2534285,1,B000EU1Q0Y,"It's more than unplugged, it's completely uninvolved. 'Laid back' is the tone this video would like to convey, but interviewer UFO researcher, David Sereda, and subject, Dan Aykroyd, are so casual, they may as well be discussing who won the Mets game. It's difficult to discuss such fantastic subjects without striking a nerve somewhere, but this documentary manages just that, seeming more intent on showing just how normal, (and dull), a paranormal believer can be. We like Aykroyd using his celebrity status to bring the UFO phenomena to the talking tables, (it sure is more sincere than weight-loss programs, and orphaned African children), but his rather unconvincing account of a 'men in black' encounter, and his lung polluting, chain smoking cigarettes inhaled into his very overweight rotund figure, while discussing how the U.S. Government is destroying the world's natural environment, verges on SNL satire.",1178496000,3,918,5.381944444444445
2534286,5,B000EU1Q0Y,"If you believe in UFOs then you are not alone.  Dan Aykroyd does, and he has got it right.  His ideals behind the UFO phenomenon are ideals that I have never heard anyone tell before.  I'm looking foward to his new UFO video release.

2534287,5,B000EU1Q0Y,"I think this is a great dvd to see when it comes to find out about the truth about UFOS .. great research, objective and profound.  Dan Aykroyd to me is very serious on the subject, and as a matter of fact, I am interested to get on DVD the shows that he did for Sci fi.. and never made it to tv.

very goood indeed, from Nasa, to Roswell to all the different in and outs of the phenomenon..",1171411200,8,391,3.875
2534288,3,B000EU1Q0Y,"Actually, I'm only giving 2 and a half stars

I don't usually review stuff like this.... I'm just an ignorant musician, not an astrophysicist. But then again, neither is Dan Aykroyd.

As Dan himself said, he is an entertainer and the purpose of this documentary is to entertain.... OK, it WAS entertaining.

But I doubt that I'm any closer to believing ALL the hoopla about UFOs coming to earth than I was before. Neither do I buy (whole hog) into every account, photograph or rumor regarding abductions, contacts etc.... However, I do believe that there could easily be people from other planets who may have visited here... I also believe in the possibility that SOME people's abduction accounts might actually be true.

There's just so much rabidity generated from the subject that it invites every fame seeker, money grubber and certified whacko to crawl out of the woodwork each time the subject gets some fresh notoriety.... For example, idiots like Rael who claim extraterrestrial origins in order to attract followers to their stupidass, mind numbed cults. Does any right thinker on the planet follow blindly behind these morons....? Hell no.... But I digress....

I disgaree with producer/author/director David Sereda's assertion that having a conversation about UFOs with Dan Aykroyd is anything at all like speaking with Albert bloody Einstein.... This star struck little twit needs to remain BEHIND the camera. Every time he opens his mouth something really frickin' stupid comes out of it.....

But all things considered, some of the photo and film work was entertaining..... Some of the interviews were thought provoking... The Astronaut Cooper stuff was quite revealing... particularly the fact that Cooper himself spoke as if he actually IS being controlled by aliens....No kiddin'...It's spooky.

All in all the DVD is entertaining if you can get past all the aforementioned silliness....

In all honesty, I must admit that the film does make a stronger statement for the existence of real space invaders than any other film of it's kind that I've seen....and Aykroyd himself is by no means a prophet of an ""all aliens are our friends"" philosophy.... He raises the ""benevolent vs: malevolent"" issue with great frequency...and his ""Men in Black"" account is really cool....

What the hell, if yer fascinated with all this UFO stuff, buy the DVD... You'll probably be entertained by it and ya may even learn something. It's worth seeing for anyone who has any kind of curiousity on the subject.....

2534292,4,B000EU1Q0Y,"While it's true that I found the production value lacking, I hate to see this video maligned by people with short attention spans and fragile egos. You must consider Akroyd's motivation in doing this.  It's not for fame or fortune; he already has that.  He risks credibility and marketability with this project; yet proceeds, albeit calmly, to express sincere belief in these "" vehicles"" moving in our atmosphere ( and just outside of it, too. ) I particularly found the infra-red footage very compelling. Strangely, no reviewer has mentioned it.  Perhaps they turned it off too soon. ( There are, after all, no explosions or MTV-like editing tricks to hold your interest. ) There are many who found ""March of the Penguins"" boring and failed to consider the implications of that film as well.  But for those seriously trying to understand our world and the times we live in, this video is an excellent wake-up call and jumping-off point for further study of higher technologies, alternative histories and our future.  Decide for yourself.  Don't let somebody else decide what is or isn't significant for you.

I think that's stretching things a bit.

The Pope gets treated with less reverence than Aykroyd does here.

Be that as it is, this is an entertaining sit-down with Aykroyd, interspersed with UFO footage and other interviews (astronaut Gordon Cooper among them).  It's entertaining, but hardly definitive.  Aykroyd certainly is articulate and can form complete sentences unassisted, but I don't think I heard him say anything I haven't heard elsewhere before.

If you're really curious about UFO cases, far better to find some books or DVDs about individual incidents, because what is included here is very, very general.

However, it's an entertaining way to pass a couple of hours.  My suggestion is rent, don't buy.",1161475200,11,860,5.007042253521127
2534295,3,B000EU1Q0Y,"This is quite an odd video - not for the subject matter so much as for the style of presentation.  According to filmmaker David Sereda, he was so fascinated by a UFO-related conversation he had with actor Dan Aykroyd that he just had to interview him in front of the cameras, and this video is basically a conversation between the two about a range of issues related to UFO phenomena.  Apparently, Aykroyd has long been interested in the subject and had recently interviewed a number of prominent ufologists for his own UFO-related show for Sci-Fi (before the series was abruptly and mysteriously cancelled before it ever made it to air).  Aykroyd, it's important to note, does not pretend to be a scientist or an expert (even though Sereda bills him as one of the greatest minds on earth), and he really doesn't have any vast truths to communicate - he's just, like so many of us, fascinated and well-read on the subject, a believer who wants to push the UFO debate more firmly into public awareness.

The production quality of the actual interview leaves something to be desired.  I think both men were there facing each other, but the shots of Sereda show him against a white background while Aykroyd looms in front of a shadowy background, with all manner of strange close-ups and camera angles of him interspersed throughout.  To my eyes, at least, the presentation sometimes takes on the look of a mockumentary, especially when Aykroyd lights up a cigarette.

Since the topics cover a wide range of issues, from space shuttle sightings to alien abduction to parallel dimensions to Men in Black and beyond, you almost need to have at least a basic background in the history of UFOs and alien literature to put some of what is discussed in a proper context.  On the other hand, the conversational tone of the presentation may appeal to the uninitiated much more than a dry, scientific discussion ever could.  Those of us who consider ourselves armchair ufologists may not gain a lot out of the discussion at all, as it mainly focuses on familiar sightings, events, and speculation.  Some of the newer UFO videos presented here may prove interesting, as I saw several clips I had never seen before, but none of them are in any way explosive -

there's really no substantive evidence of any kind on display here.  I also think the filmmakers made a big mistake by including a significant number of Billy Meier photos - sure, these are some of the clearest UFO photographs ever taken, but the vast majority of ufologists view Billy Meier's ""evidence"" as thoroughly bogus.

Basically, I have to go down the middle on this one.  You need to be able to put a lot of the subject matter in its proper context in order to closely follow the conversation, yet those who know enough to do just that probably won't glean a lot of new information from the presentation.  In addition, the fact that many of the same videos and photographs are replayed several times over the course of the production gets a little annoying.",1159315200,13,3013,4.712380952380952

2534307,4,B000EU1Q0Y,"This film added little to my understanding of UFOs, but it still makes a cool introduction to contemporary UFOlogy - some recent sightings, history, conspiracy theory, abductions, theoretical propulsion, and so on. Not really for the hard-core sceptic, nor the learned Ufologist, this film is great, however, for what it sets out to do - to get more people thinking and talking about UFOs and disclosure.

Dan Aykroyd and ufologist David Sereda chat semi-formally on UFOs while we're shown sightings, related footage, and testimony. It's an interesting mix of hyped production and a frank down-to-earth discussion which seems to work.  Some of the info was new to me and worth seeing, such as Hellyer, the Canadian Defense Minister, testifying. Personally I find Aykroyd to be a likable fellow and a great presenter. He is, afterall, a MUFON spokesman, and his beleif is based on his own UFO experiences which he also discusses.

Sereda compares Aykroyd to 'Einstein', 'genius', 'professor' and 'one of the great minds of our time'.  I have my doubts, and Aykroyd admits himself that he's not even a scientist, but neverthess he does come across as intelligent, articulate and knowledgeable about Physics and UFO's. Sereda, doing a fair job, throws in some of his own research ideas in too, and why not?

As is typical with this genre, the footage gets a bit repetative, and there could have been more. And I'll never understand the obsession of over-zooming into footage until you see only a useless blured blob.

Mostly a joy to watch, this film also got a few unbelieving friends thinking and talking about UFOs. Aykroyd and Sereda should be proud of this little UFO production. Well done Dan and Dave!",1156464000,7,1705,4.964912280701754
2534308,4,B000EU1Q0Y,"This is a no-holds-barred documentary about the UFO phenonmenon. Dan Akroyd proves that he is more than a talented actor, he is a real person who is willing to put his career on the line to share what he has experienced. My only comment is that I would have preferred more of Dan's own experience. UFO buffs, this is a good one.",1156204800,2,328,4.306451612903226
2534309,3,B000EU1Q0Y,I was kind of disappointed.  I'm a big UFO afficionado and this DVD didn't have anything new.  It seemed to be just a rehash of the same old UFO theories and major sightings - just coming from the mouth of Dan Aykroyd.,1155427200,4,218,4.166666666666667
2534310,1,B000EU1Q0Y,"This DVD has to be the most unadulterated piece of crapola on UFOs that I have ever seen.  David Sereda, a supposedly renowned UFOligist, conducts a poorly-scripted, off the cuff interview with another ""expert,"" chain-smoking, tartan-clad Dan Akroyd, about the evidence for the existence of UFOs.  No compelling evidence is offered, however.  The accompanying film footage of UFOs is presented without commentary and does not correspond at any time with the key points raised in the interview.  These points are all conjectural, needless to say, so the supposed ""shots"" of UFOs are nothing more than fluff.  There is one piece of fuzzy footage, replayed ad nauseam and without commentary, that looks like a helium-inflated VW Beetle balloon flying over the Mexican countryside.  How is this proof of the existence of UFOs?  At one riveting moment, an astronaut inside a space shuttle asks a fellow astronaut performing some maneuver outside the shuttle if he has just seen an object fly by.  Oh, it's just the cap of the camera lens, he concludes.  Finally, the most compelling proof of the existence of UFOs is Akroyd's hallucination, when in NYC, of a mean-faced man stepping out of a sedan while he was on the phone with Britney Spears.  Wow, now I'm convinced.",1154649600,4,1264,5.0047846889952154
2534311,4,B000EU1Q0Y,"I purchased this after hearing Dan Akroyd on Coast to Coast AM and viewed him as knowledgeable on the subject matter.  He was fine on the topics discussed but I was led to believe there was new UFO video footage of great quality.  While some of the video footage was newer, I would still not rate the quality as superior.  We are left with the same age-old pro & con arguments with really no better photographic evidence than has been presented over the last 60 years.  Overall, a good effort but a little below expectations.",1154304000,8,525,4.494736842105263
2534312,4,B000EU1Q0Y,"Positive things about the DVD:

1. Excellent footage, especially the NASA stuff which too me almost seems definitive.

2. Dan Aykroyd. His personality and insight is what makes this DVD unique and great.

3. Gordon Cooper. Unless someone has debunked him and knows something this DVD isn't telling, this man seems as legit as they come. To me, much more convincing than Paul Hellyer (sp?) who also got a lot of air time.

Negative things about the DVD:

1. The production values were only okay. Some of the titles were pixelated and Mr. Serada's choice of graphics and titles seem somewhat unsophisticated. (I could honestly do better with my home computer and Apple's iMovie.)

2. The overuse of the Billy Mier's photos.

3. Dan Aykroyd's clothes... Where and the heck does this man shop? It looked like a clown suit!

Overall, the DVD really is very good though and well worth the $12.00 at Amazon. Buy it together with the new CD by The Bravery and you'll get free shipping and have some great tunes!

postscript: I'm worried about the title of the DVD... You just know the skeptics will call it Dan Aykroyd: Unhinged on UFOs!",1154131200,3,1129,4.690355329949239

It takes some old footage of UFOs and analyzes them and also shows some newer stuff that I've never seen before.  David Sereda asks the questions and Dan Akroyd answers them.  Even though it was very interesting to get an hour of what Aykroyd really knows about the UFO phenomenon, I couldn't help but think that it should have been David Sereda answering the questions.  Overall, this movie does a good job of ""connecting the dots"", a phrase used by UFO researcher Paola Harris, to describe what this second-science community is trying to do in order to solve the UFO phenomenon riddle.",1152230400,3,710,4.8429752066115705

2534327,5,B000EU1Q0Y,I liked the approach that Dan took in discussing UFOS and cover-ups. Listening to the interview made it clear that aliens exist and that the government knows about them. They discussed what Dan would do if he could travel back in time and he was asked who he would talk to. I think the film would have been better if they had steered clear of the whole time travel thing.,1151366400,2,371,4.314285714285714
2534328,2,B000EU1Q0Y,"I was quite impressed with the high quality caliber of this production. The sounds, camera work, the great UFO footages. UFO reality was enhanced by the testimony of astronaut Gordon Cooper who saw with his own eyes a fleet of flying saucers in formation closeup while in his military Jet and Cooper tells of his cameramen at Edwards AFB filming a flying saucer landing on the dry lake bed with its landing gear extended.  Cooper says he saw this saucer on the film before it was shipped out to the pentagon.  The reality of men in black was strengthen by Dan Aykroyd's chilling account of his own run in with the MIBs, a scary account I never heard about Aykroyd before.  And the addition of new NASA shuttle footage it all sums up to a high recommendation to everybody that something strange is going on and it all needs to be investigated. This DVD is definitely five stars.",1151280000,3,877,4.537974683544304
2534329,2,B000EU1Q0Y,"I've been a Dan Aykroyd fan since the old Saturday Night Live days. There is no doubt he is an amazing natural talent when it comes to comedy, acting and performing music, but a ""professor"" and great intellect discussing the UFO phenomenon? Sorry, I didn't buy it.

While the DVD does contain some interesting video clips of unidentified objects, or ""lights"", apparently performing maneuvers that are physically impossible for current aircraft technologies, a majority of the footage is inconclusive and may have other potential explanations.

During this DVD documentary Mr. Aykroyd provides his thoughts and anecdotes on the UFO phenomenon, nothing more. He does not approach this topic from a true scientific stand point. He just flat out believes.

The anti-gravity segment was interesting to say the least. This portion of the documentary shows footage of the alleged levitation of a cannon ball and a pair of cutters or pliers of some kind, under the influence of the ""Hutchison effect.""

First, why doesn't the camera operator move to the side of the ball so we can indeed see it levitating without the aid of some lifting mechanism, like a counterweighted shaft entering through the wood panel. This can easily be a hoax, and probably is.

No, this DVD does not provide proof that UFOs are piloted by extraterrestrials, nor does it prove the existence of antigravity technology, or uncover great government conspiracies. This documentary isn't even very good for entertainment's sake.

This documentary will unfortunately serve to perpetuate ignorance among those in society who are more easily duped, or more willing to believe.",1150934400,22,1637,5.20532319391635
2534330,5,B000EU1Q0Y,"Don't listen to the panic from mainstream scientists and politicians who are outraged at this film.  They have given us nuclear weapons, missiles, war machines and Global Warming.  Now they want us to listen to their views on extraterrestrials?  I say give the alternative voice the front stage for a while and see what they can do.  Maybe we will wake up in a better world. Dan Aykroyd expresses amazing concern for our planet in this film and the ET hypothesis is one way of opening minds to this.

I have known about UFOs since I was 18 years old.  I think the main stream scientists are very disturbed when a movie like this comes out, and I am glad Dan Aykroyd had the courage to do this.  People want to see UFOs that look like a Mercaedes Benz rolling up the red carpet.  This is some of the best real life video footage of UFOs I have ever seen. What do they expect, Paramount PIctures filming UFOs with 70 mm cameras?  This footage obviosuly wasn't planned.  It was captured off guard, last second!  That is what makes it exciting!

David Sereda asks some of the most thought provoking questions to Dan Aykroyd, like, ""If we keep laughing at this UFO thing in our media and don't take it seriously, what will happen if China or Russia do take this seriously and they figure out how UFOs fly before us?  Our country could be taken away from us, and our way of life over night.  Don't look for a night of entertainment here just because you are bored.  Look for thought provoking questions and answers.  We cannot be alone in the Universe.  UFOs are proof of that.  The kind of people who testify in this film make it all the more believable.",1150761600,3,1649,4.403973509933775

After listening to coast to coast I couldn't wait to get this dvd at last here was the proof that would rock the world. Finally the day arrived and I got it in the mail, got home and put it in my player.  What I saw in the first ten minutes of viewing this video is pretty much what I saw throughout the whole showing. It was continually the same footage over and over again zoomed in and out, clear to blurry, clear to blurry to the very end, get the picture. I've seen some amazing footage on TLC, History station and many other documentaries on the subject that puts this dvd to shame. Although I commend the author and Dan for thier courage in coming forth on the topic of UFO's this video was a major disappointment. Besides the same blurry images over and over again, the footage only lasts a few seconds at best hence my title don't blink. Sorry guys but here was a great chance to proove to the world what's going on but this video falls short.

2534332,1,B000EU1Q0Y,"Not being a skeptic, and on record as being a believer in the existence of UFO's I was shocked and disappointed in this latest offering from the ""rich man Aykroyd."" Aykroyd, a Canadian, is the creator of the character of Elwood Blues from the ""Blues Brothers"" and those terrible House of Blues restaurants. Aykroyd is the star of this pretentious video. The only funny part of this DVD is Aykroyd's imitation of a Presidential address to the nation of a UFO sighing. Other than that, this movie was mediocre at best.

I knew that this was going to be difficult viewing when Aykroyd shows the photos taken by known hoaxer, the legendary Billy Meier. Meier has been criticized by leading UFO researchers including the likes of Stanton Friedman. See Wikipedia on this fake Meier character, who comes from Europe no less. From this point on, the ""rich man"" Aykroyd's DVD was not on ""solid ground"" intellectually.

In addition, the evidence of experiments performed by a certain individual named John Hutchinson, into the possible motive force of UFO's is even more laughable and questionable. Hutchinson, another Canadian, wears his hair long and spouts his babble, in his segment. This retard incidentally wears an odd hat during his bit. Please do not try to purchase this hat, please. Instead, this ""BOZO"" belongs at an artist's colony with his look, demeanor, and that hat. Hope that he's got his bowl of soup when purchasing that hat, the fool. Hutchinson's claim, shown on the video is of his ability to levitate a 75-lbs ball using Tesla wavelengths. This has all the look of bad effects from a down-on-their luck ""special effects house"" in Van Nuys CA, and that this house has not yet discovered CGI. It is no wonder that no ""respectable"" scientist has been able to duplicate these obviously ""faked"" experiments. You would have better luck with Cold Fusion than this method of propulsion. Shame on this rich, businessman Aykroyd from exploiting this obviously delusional Canadian, aye. Shame on you Dan!! What is interesting though is the testimony of a Gordon Cooper, aka ""Gordo."" This former Astro's testimony was interesting, but could not save this bozo production from falling into the quagmire of doom and stupidity.

If you want to see the ""rich man from the House of Blues"" Aykroyd act like he is smart, and that he is some ""professor"" of UFO's; then by all means rent this ""hoot."" Be warned though that there is more pseudo-science than real science in this offering from ""Gravitron Productions. This ""rich man"" Aykroyd's movie is what the late, great Carl Sagan warned us to avoid in his seminal non-fiction tomb, ""A Demon-Guided World."" Sagan warned us of people like the ""rich man"" Aykroyd passing off his pseudo-science as legitimate research, which does not follow any established scientific principals.  Please don't be like sheep, watch this first class schlock for yourself. You will think less of Dan like I now do. Shame on you Dan!! What I would like to know though is how Aykroyd pulled off the impossible and married the former Miss Donna Dixon? That would be the basis for a first class DVD. It fair to say that some heavy Hollywood dollars were exchanged for that marriage to have occurred to begin with.
