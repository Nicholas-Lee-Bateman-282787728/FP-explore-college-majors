This film does however offer some positive aspects.  The animation is nice, and the first part of the three part film is rather interseting.  As soon as the giant creatures start having at it though, the film begins to lose its appeal.
My main dilemma when wathcing the film was trying to decide whether I was enjoying it or not.  I think the relationship aspect was more interesting then the battles, which is not want you want to target in a good anime.
What this film really needed was some aliens, or to be set in the future.  The creatures which were supposed to be from the past, looked like mechs, which did not make much sense.
I can't say this was the best anime I ever saw, but I wouldn't call it the worst either.  If you're really willing to let go of reality, you might just enjoy this film.",986428800,6,974,4.260869565217392
