307919,5,6301066162,"I rented this movie after being told by a reviewer that it was a better exploration of the three-way love affair than ""Keeping the Faith"" and since I loved ""Keeping. . ."" I decided to give it a try.
Besides being a great story about unrequited love and what happens when the emotions between 3 people get tangled, it's a great story regarding broadcast journalism and workplace comedy.  The pace of the movie, particulary the scenes inside the workplace, is quick, and the side story of boy loves girl who loves someone else is fantastic.  This movie cemented Holly Hunter as one of my favorite actress (you must see her in ""Living Out Loud"" and ""Home for the Holidays"") and Albert Brooks (as the guy who loves her) plays his character as goofy with an underlying seriousness -- I was completely charmed by his performance.
But the best part of this movie is the ending, which I won't discuss, except to say that it's one of the few movies where I walked away feeling everything worked out EXACTLY as it should (i.e., not your typical romantic ending, but a satisfying one nonetheless).
In sum, definately a must-see movie.",998438400,,1123,4.666666666666667
307920,4,6301066162,"Broadcast news is a fantastic example of great mid-80's mainstream comedy. It'd make a fantastic double-feature with Tootsie, with which it shares a bunch of traits, like:
- an incredible cast of supporting actors.
- a bunch of seemingly throwaway lines and situations that make you belly laugh at the time and then creep up on you later.
- some moderately serious (simple) questions, asked in an effortlessly funny way.
- a particular sort of mid 80's look and feel. (I was surprised to feel a little nostalgic while watching this again.)
Holly Hunter is amazing in this movie, just amazing and charismatic and lovable and genuine, and Albert Brooks brings a real(ly funnily neurotic) pathos to his corner of the love triangle. Bill Hurt never really comes clear for me in anything, but like Brooks, he's perfectly cast here. (It's creepy that Hurt gets top billing on Amazon and the DVD box. Among the three main characters, his easily pulls the least weight. Holly Hunter's the emotional center of everything in this movie, she's making the choices and carrying every scene, and her name should go first.)
After you watch this one, tell me if you think Cher, in Moonstruck, deserved the Best Actress Oscar over Holly Hunter in Broadcast News (and Meryl Streep in Out of Africa). Yeesh.",971395200,6,1288,4.859090909090909
307921,4,6301066162,"biting satire with the cast used very well - Williams Hurt and Albert Brooks are perfect in roles that seem written for them, and Holly Hunter is  just priceless; it covers journalistic ethics, the burdens of workaholic  single women and office politics, with enough time for a love triangle (the  weakest part of the movie). more than a decade later, it seems prophetic,  what with all those horrible newsmagazines around. if you hate Dateline,  this movie is a must!",966816000,4,468,4.8734177215189876
307922,5,6301066162,"I saw this movie for the first time 7 years ago when I was a freshman in highschool.  Now that I'm working in the newsroom of a network affiliate I have come to realize just how real to life this movie is.  Whoever  researched the script on this either worked in television news or spent a  lot of time in a newsroom.  If you want realism...this is it.  Especially  the scene where Joan Cusak is running with a video tape (one of the  funniest scenes, but also one of the most accurate).  I can tell you, that  in just the first few weeks of working in a news room I had run like that  countless times, and been totally bowled over by someone doing the same  twice.

307923,5,6301066162,"Romantic comedies don't get much better than this!  ""Broadcast News"" focuses on three likeable, interesting people trying to decide what they think of each other in the midst of the controlled chaos of a  national TV newsroom.  William Hurt shines as a rising star reporter, being  groomed for an anchor slot, who knows he isn't bright enough to understand  the news he's reporting.  Albert Brooks is, well, Albert Brooks, always a  delight to watch, and here very effective and funny as the antithesis of  Hurt's character: a sharp and intelligent reporter who doesn't exactly  exude charisma on camera.  It is Holly Hunter's portrayal of a frenetic,  neurotic producer which steals the show, however, as her character is torn  between her high professional ideals and her attraction to a man who is  himself the very ""style over substance"" she finds so threatening.  An enjoyable time with people you'd like to have as your friends, even if  they'd sometimes drive you crazy.",959731200,,977,5.01875
307924,5,6301066162,"This is quite simply a perfect film. It is about three REAL people in a somewhat messy love triangle, but it is so much better than any other movie in this genre because it doesn't stoop to stupid resolutions. The three  main characters(Holly Hunter, William Hurt, Albert Brooks) are great at  what they do, which is broadcast news, but they are terrible at matters of  the heart. They always say the wrong thing at the wrong time, and because  of that, we identify with them. When have any of us ever been absolutely  perfect in the area of romance? The film is funny, sad and real. And Albert  Brooks was absolutely robbed of his oscar in this role. It is his finest  performance. If you are expecting by-the-numbers romance that you can see  coming down fifth avenue, you will not enjoy this, but if you want to be  touched by real people who try and fail at love, then this is the best film  on the subject.",953683200,8,911,4.401197604790419
307925,4,6301066162,"This is a great behind-the-scenes inside-look at the news, and a great character study. Great performances by the three leads, Holly Hunter is as great as always, William Hurt brings warmth and intelligence to an  other-wise hollow character and Albert Brooks gives one of the best and  funniest performances of the 80's. James L. Brooks wrote an extremely  clever screenplay with nicely-drawn characters. Inmensely entertaining and  funny, while not a laugh-out-loud comedy, it has drama and a bit of  romance. Great stuff. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film an 8!",952819200,2,568,5.064516129032258
307926,5,6301066162,"Broadcast News is one of those films that makes you feel like you've had a perfect meal. Its makes you feel content and grateful that a film could be so perfect. On the surface this is called a romantic-comedy, a genre  muddied buy wittless trash like Picture Perfect but this film is as(for  lack of a better word) deep as they come. Yes it is at times funny, but all  three leads are very and even painfully real. Holly Hunter periodically  disconnecting the phone, crying for a while and then giong back to work,  sounds overtly cutsy, but as performed it somehow fits. Albert Brooks (in  his best role) is a knock-out, he plays a reporter who is  gifted/nuerotic/disposable and very much in love with Holly Hunter. He has  this unforgettable speech about Tom(William Hurt) being the devil where he  is ""semi-serious"" that manages to be over the top hilarious and  unbearably sad. William Hurt, in his string of great 80s performance plays  Tom, a man of low I.Q. but a deep understanding of life, he is the subject  of Holly Hunters loathing and affection. These three set the stage for a  perfect morality play, a realistic expose of life in network news, its  politics and the cost career driven people have to pay. As a critique of  network news, I liked this film better than Sidney Lumet's NETWORK becuase  that film wet completely over the top in its final quarter, Broadcast  News's approach on the other hand is through real characters that we can  symphasise with. This is director James L.Brooks's best film. I can only  count four he made, most recently As Good As It Gets. That film is just a  lighthearted unrealistic if highly enjoyable comedy, and it does not nearly  come close to the depth of this film.

308020,5,6301066162,"This is subtle, grown-up film-making thats still a lot of fun (and is often very funny), but that also gets under the skin of its characters and their foibles and contradictions.

The actors are all terrific.  Its not surprising that William Hurt and Holly Hunter as a pretty-boy TV  news reporter and hard driver news producer are great.  But Albert Brooks is a revelation.  Hes funny (of course), but he hangs right in with Hunter and Hurt in the dramatic scenes, and for my money creates the best character of the film, and of his (terrific) career.  The supporting cast is all strong (including Jack Nicholson in a cameo that makes sense and takes advantage of his star power).

The film also examines the eroding standards in journalism.  That's not big news anymore, but was more fresh when the film was made.

(spoiler ahead!)

My only problem with the film  but its a big one  is that the big final twist where Hunter realizes Hurt is too shallow for her to be with, is based on an illogical contrivance.  Any experienced TV news producer like Hunter's character would hardly be shocked that Hurts off camera reactions were filmed separately -- that's often how its done.  And theres never any sign that Hurt claims anything to the contrary.  In a film full of great details, it drives me nuts that one of the very most important doesnt come off as accurate.  Not enough to kill the movie, but enough for me to dock it a half star.",1461024000,,1439,4.5625

308109,5,6301066162,"There is truly some excellent subtext and prolific statements in this movie that goes well beyond it's cutesy bizarre love triangle and feminist bravado. If the sexes were reversed, it would stand as a dark commentary of ambition vs. appeal. Even as it is, the message is there. And the 'dark side' to it all is how we the general populace buy into it, and loose our morality and ethics for emotional comfort and attraction. And does morality and ethics return with maturity, experience and the education that comes with? And is it still as vulnerable to be lost again if something more attractive and desperate falls into the fray? Butcher stores are near extinct in urban markets. Yet the urbanites seem to be more consuming and savvy about the meat they purchase. Butchers still exist in the back of the supermarket. But would they or could they perform better in their own establishment? And would the urbanites notice the difference and change their buying habits? Or, is it the quality controlled mass sterile environment and packaging that ensures the best cuts of meat urbanities can obtain? Who's whistling Dixie at the end of the day - the butcher, the cashier, or the manager? And if it's the later two, we all feel there's something wrong with that. We've been duped, and are being taken advantage of. And who is patronized there after? 'Ed The Butcher - with 33 years in business' or the newly opened 'Le Butcher Shoppe'? And would Ed himself do better to close his dingy location, and vie for a chief position at the new trendy store? I feel our consumption of news has become equal today. And Broadcast News greatly exemplifies that. Holly Hunters 'Jane' is more a 'chef' than a producer. Wanting to serve the best and nutritious dish of news to the general public. And as fun and rewarding as it is to constantly compare and better 'recipes' with the local 'meat vendor' Albert Brooks (that's right Al, I just called you a 'meat vendor'!) Jane realizes the ease and comfort of just going for a 'Hurt Burger' at the end of the tiring day. (Sorry Bill, but your name does better justice than Al's 'meat vendor' metaphor.) And I myself and am in the quagmire with this review. Am I selling more Criterion, or Broadcast News? Sure, you could pick up a cheaper version cheaper - but would you still get as much 'meat' with it? And should there be that much 'meat' to begin with? After all, we're just talking about a romantic comedy on a DVD that helps kill time. The supermarkets down the street, and the butcher store is across town - how important is it to you? And check out the burger deal at that fast food chain that's everywhere in your travels, be it close or far. You deserve it.

The acting ensemble is nearly flawless with Holly Hunter remaining fresh (with a dash of paranoid/OCD) and William Hurt being, well, William Hurt, but the teaming of Albert Brooks with directing by James Brooks (no relation), is heaven-sent. Audiences having the pleasure of seeing such work are lucky for sure.

If one does not think the media world is being truly portrayed then just view ""Shattered"" or recount the NBC debacle of replacing Jay Leno with Conan O'Brian and later Jimmy Fallon. It should be no surprise that the grey flannel suit types are very fallible.

The story is great, the acting flawless as noted above, the directing 1st rate and the production values as cool as it gets (just watching Joan Cusack negotiate the news room at break-neck speed is worth the price of admission alone).

308178,5,6301066162,"I think the last time I watched this classic was on laserdisc, so it's been a while.  The film, set in a major network newsroom in Washington, D. C., and the story focuses on a trio of hardworking, ambitious journalists.  Jane (Holly Hunter) is a news producer.  Her best friend, Aaron (Albert Brooks) is a mostly field reporter who is hungry for a week-end anchor job.  New to the station is a former sports reporter named Tom Grunick (William Hurt).  He is being groomed to be an anchor.

Each of the trio have their strengths and weaknesses as the story will eventually reveal.  What is key is that Tom is admittedly a bit short in the smarts department.  But he's not stupid and he looks good.  So good that Jane is attracted to him but at the same time is dismissive because of his news shallowness.  Jane has no romantic relationship as a result of her devotion to her job.  So devoted that she is also oblivious to Aaron's constant swooning.  So there is our little triangle.

While all of that is funny, entertaining and ultimately heartbreaking, the real meat on the bones here is the prescient vision of writer/director James L. Brooks.  The television news business is transitioning away from hard news and moving more into celebrity based news and human interest stories.  In a presentation to her peers, Jane shows how several TV stations eschewed a breaking story on the other side of the globe, for a story about a girl's domino championship.  Everybody was bored and walked out.

There are a lot of small things in this film that make it work so well.  Early on we get a glimpse of Jane making a last minute change to a feature to be reported.  In one nice scene  Jane actually sees what Tom can do well.  Read the news with changes being fed into his earpiece at the same time...and look good doing it.  This is a wonderful film with numerous awards including 7 Oscar nominations (Brooks, the 3 lead actors, picture, editing) that holds up well today.  It has gone on to influence similarly themed screenings ranging from HBO's ""Newsroom"" to Will Ferrell's ""Anchorman 2"".

See it on Blu ray which is now available from Criterion.  The transfer is in 1080p with a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  Here is a piece lifted from Criterion's booklet:

""Supervised and approved by director James L. Brooks and editor Richard Marks, this new high-definition digital transfer was created on a DFT SCANITY Film Scanner in 4k resolution from the original 35mm camera negative, and color corrected on a Baselight Eight in 2K resolution. Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, warps, jitter, and flicker were manually removed using MTI's DRS system and Pixel Farm's PFClean system.
Telecine supervisors: James L. Brooks, Richard Marks, Lee Kline.
Telecine colorist: John Persichetti/Sony Colorworks, Los Angeles.""

It is in a word, perfect.  The opening 20th Century Fox logo page notwithstanding, fine grain has been painstakingly added back in to the picture.  This really looks like a film, not a digital reproduction.  Detail is excellent, as is overall clarity and color.  I could find no film deterioration or noise.

The audio come in DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 and includes only an English SDH subtitle track.  Here again is a statement from Criterion regarding the audio:

""The 2.0 surround soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from the original 35mm Dolby A magnetic tracks. Clicks, thumps, hiss, and hum were manually removed using Pro Tools HD. Crackle was attenuated using AudioCube's integrated audio workstation.""

Excellent dynamic range and no issues.  There is a healthy list of extras including a commentary track with Brooks and editor Richard Marks.  There is also a documentary about Brooks, alternate and deleted scenes, an interview with Susan Zirinsky, the model used for Hunter's character, Jane.  There is also a nice booklet about the film and more.",1394496000,2,3887,4.903374233128834

308230,5,6301066162,"If you watch television at all, you have almost certainly seen something that James L. Brooks was involved in. He was a writer on Taxi, Lou Grant, Rhoda and the Mary Tyler Moore show and continues to contribute to The Simpsons. His first film, Terms of Endearment, took home five Oscars, with Brooks being credited for three of them.

Broadcast News is a blend of comedy, drama and romance. When I first watched it over 20 years ago, I was disappointed. I didn't think it was interesting, funny or moving in any way. It's strange how our tastes can change over the years. I think I appreciate the film now because I know more about life and can relate to some of the events.

Two brief scenes at the start of the film introduce us to the characters of Tom and Jane. We learn that Tom doesn't mind being beaten up at school because he knows he will have a better career than any of the bullies he has to deal with. Jane shows us a glimpse of her character as she chastises her father for his imprecise use of words.

The story continues with the adult Jane (Hunter) giving a speech about news coverage. She's dismayed at how the networks dumb-down information to appease the audience. When she demonstrates her point with a mindless news article, her audience is more responsive than at any other point in her speech. The only person who admires her presentation is Tom (Hurt) and she asks him to dinner. He presents the news, but reveals that he knows very little about the stories he talks about. Despite that, his employers love what he does and pay him large sums of money.

Jane is obsessed with her job as a producer and can't respect people who are bad at their job. Any chance of romance is ended when she speaks her mind to Tom. She repels men. Hunter got the part which was intended for Debra Winger, but it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role. Her accent and the determination with which her character pursues her career reminds me of Jodie Foster's performance in The Silence of the Lambs.

How often do people succeed on charm or because the right look? The film explores that theme throughout as we see Tom take every opportunity that presents itself. In contrast, we see a gifted reporter, Aaron (Brooks), receive no recognition from anyone with the exception of Jane. The two have a deep friendship and confide in each other regularly.

James L. Brooks has a background in news and portrays the high-paced environment to good effect. There's an hilarious scene early in the film in which Jane edits a story just a few seconds before it is due to air, and her assistant (Joan Cusack) has to dodge all manner of unlikely obstacles to deliver the tape on time. Although it's a funny scene, it shows how much pressure is involved in the news business.

Another exceptional scene shows Tom anchoring the news for the first time. Jane knows that he is likely to stumble if he has to think up questions for himself, so she takes care of all the content. Aaron, who is at home getting drunk after being overlooked again, calls in with information which Jane feeds to Tom while he is on the air. The result is a professional broadcast in which Tom is made to look highly competent.

There are a lot of similar scenes which give us a real understanding of how the news business might work. We feel part of that world. However, the film shines because of the acting and the dark comedy. Brooks is the source of much of the humor, but Hurt and Hunter play their parts well. Jack Nicholson has a small role and pulls it off perfectly as you would expect.

There is a love triangle of sorts. Tom is successful, but superficial, and he is interested in Jane. Part of his interest appears to be driven by what she might do for his career. Aaron can see Tom's shortcomings and thinks that he's a more suitable partner for Jane. He clearly loves her as well as being her best friend. Jane is torn between Tom's looks and success, and Aaron's friendship and competence. I'll let you find out the resolution for yourself.

Criterion's Blu-ray presentation is excellent and the film looks better than it ever has. The special features include recent interviews with James L. Brooks and the cast. One of the most interesting features is an alternate ending with comments from Brooks.

Broadcast News is unusual in that it manages to make a technical job appear exciting. I wanted to see what would happen to the three main characters. It's funny throughout in an intelligent way and the romantic element will please some viewers. I can't believe that I failed to see its brilliance when I first watched it over 20 years ago.",1333929600,2,4623,4.53781512605042

I loved it's portrayal of gathering and producing news in the pre-digital era. Analog TV, no Internet, no Twitter, no laptops, no cellphones, video being shot and edited on 3/4 inch tape...

Perhaps slightly exaggerated, but it also nails many of the newsroom personality types I've known over the years.

Broadcast News is more than a good flick. For those who work in broadcast news, it's like a time capsule view of the way things were.",1330992000,,576,4.673267326732673
308233,5,6301066162,"I saw Broadcast News when it first came out and liked it a lot.  I just watched it again the other night and I think I like it even better now---the mark of a really good film.

On one level it's about the depressing tendency of big broadcasting companies to  appoint good looking people over intelligent ones to anchor positions.  On another level it's about three young single people who are thrown together and the romances that happen or almost happen.

It's the genius of the script that makes what could have been a formulaic story into something much richer and more interesting.
We're shown shots of the three principles as children, then we see the story of their meeting in a tv newsroom in Washington, DC. then we're given a short epilogue, several years later.  This tells us that this is essentially a human drama, yes, set against the throes of the harsh realities of tv news-biz, but mostly it's about these three very different and very interesting characters.

The cast is first rate.  William Hurt, as Tom, the ostensibly dumb-but-good-looking hick from Kansas who arrives in the big time, meets up with the ""smartest girl in the room"" and the loneliest, played by Holly Hunter, and her best buddy, the also smart but socially challenged guy played by Albert Brooks. I should have inserted ""brilliantly"" before each ""played"" because they were, and each was nominated for an Oscar.

It turns out that Tom is dumb-like-a-fox as he manages to get positions that the poor Brooks character would die for.  And in the process he gets Hunter, the girl Brooks has been pining for.
I won't give away the rest of the story...just want to say that things aren't always what they seem and this is the genius of this story.  Hunter and Brooks pride themselves on their superior ethics but each commits a major crime in that department---Hunter sends her female competition for Hurt off to Alaska so she can have him to herself.  And Brooks, after being rejected by Hunter for Hurt, discloses a piece of information, gratuitously, that turns her against him.  Self-righteousness seems to win but does it?  You watch and decide.  And enjoy the trip.

The whole cast is good. Jack Nicholson is hilarious in a cameo role.  I particularly want to single out William Hurt, though.  He is such a brilliant, intelligent actor that he manages to bring out an unexpected complexity in the character of Tom, who, in lesser hands might have degenerated into a stereotype.",1328054400,2,2464,4.77122641509434

This film makes a statement about the ethics of news reporting by combining romantic comedy with thoughtful substance. This film effectively tackles a very tough subject in a entertaining lighthearted manner. Aside from being an engaging drama Broadcast News is also a realistic view into the world of news reporting. It is a dramatic almost documentary style film that takes you behind the scenes of a network news station. In this 1980's charmer William Hurt plays the role of Tom Grunick. Tom is low on the talent and full of charisma. He is extremely popular and on the rise to network stardom. The only problem is that he has no knowledge or understanding of respectable news reporting. Will he fail or succeed? Holly Hunter plays the role of Jane Craig with determination and intensity. Jane is an extremely talented executive producer  who is torn over her attraction to Tom. He represents everything she is against yet she can not turn away. The man standing between them is Albert Brooks playing Aaron Altman. Aaron is a brilliant news reporter struggling to succeed in a system growing increasingly reliant on style and delivery. High ratings or respectable news coverage? The real question here is: Style or Substance? In Broadcast News an overwhelming case is made for each side. The movie soars because no matter what happens in the end everyone is a human being. Broadcast News asks important questions in a thoughtful, educational, and intriguing way.

That is not a dig; it is a fine picture that almost defies categorization, being drama, romance and comedy all rolled into one.
Holly Hunter is a total frenetic delight  as a high powered producer, and William Hurt was still in his young leading man phase as a budding news anchor, somewhat intellectually challenged.  Albert Brooks is also excellent, as a brilliant writer not in his element on screen due to flop sweats.  Many wonderful performances but will single out Joan Cusack as one of the assistants.  Why has this woman still not won an Oscar??  Out of many wonderful lines, one of my favorites comes when an old line executive is being laid off in a big retrenchment.

308238,5,6301066162,"Few writers are able to capture the human condition as well as James L. Brooks who honed his skills by writing for some of the most memorable television shows of the sixties and seventies including; The Andy Griffith Show, My Three sons, That Girl, Room 222, Mary Tyler Moore, Taxi, and many others.  In the eighties Brooks would break onto the big screen with Terms of Endearment in 1983.  He would follow that four years later with arguably his greatest accomplishment as he would write, produce, and direct, Broadcast News.

Broadcast News displays the ability of Brooks to write humorous dialog without writing jokes, and we see that clearly as we are invited into the world of television news and the lives of passive aggressive reporter Tom Grunick (William Hurt), Type A producer Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), and the news teams everyman Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks).  Brooks has managed to create characters with so much depth that it makes them incredibly relatable to the audience and leaves us longing for the next word from their mouths.  Broadcast News truly leaves the audience wanting more.

This new release includes some fine bonus material with a restored high definition transfer of the film.  The film looks and sounds great and the bonus material makes for a well rounded presentation that allows insight into all aspects of the film.

The documentary ""James L. Brooks - A Singular Voice"" is a well made piece on the career of Brooks with interesting interviews with those involved in many of Brooks' efforts.  Most noticeably missing from the documentary is Brooks himself, and this does leave the documentary a bit incomplete.  Luckily we do get some info from Brooks in some of the other bonus material.

In most cases, when films get the ""Special Edition"" treatment, deleted scenes and alternate endings add little value as it is quite obvious why the scenes were deleted and alternate endings were not used.  That is not the case here.  Over the years, the ending for Broadcast News has been a topic of much discussion amongst critics and fans alike.  Finally some insight into Brooks' thought process is available as he sets up the alternate ending for us.  The deleted scenes also go above and beyond as we are introduced to a new character and an entire storyline that changes the Tom Grunick character.  The storyline is interesting, but the impact on the youthful innocence of Grunick is tarnished, and subsequently; it had to go.

The interview with CBS news producer Susan Zirinsky who served as an inspiration for the Jane Craig character, as well as an associate producer on the film, is a great piece that covers far more than just the impact that Ms. Zirinsky had on the production.

The featurette which is touted as containing on-set footage and interviews with Brooks, Hunter, and Actor Albert Brooks, is not only hard to find due to the format of the menu, but it also a bit oversold as it plays out more like an extended trailer for the film.

The packaging for this release leave a lot to be desired as it fails to capture the fun energy of the film, and actually looks faded and worn out.

Recommendation:  This is a great film with a foundation built on strong characters and brilliant dialog.  The bonus material makes this a must have for even those who already own the film.",1297209600,5,3495,4.797996661101837
308239,4,6301066162,"The accuracy of Criterion's new blu-ray version of BROADCAST NEWS is evident the minute the 20th-Century Fox logo is displayed:  it is rich in the kind of grain that dominated film stock of the eighties.  The color timing is superb and topples all previous video releases in richness and detail.  The video extras are indulgent promotional pieces - crass for Criterion; but the commentary by Brooks will be of interest for those that want to delve deeper.
The film is a pinnacle in Brooks' career - he never did anything better, before or since, and all his experience in the tacky world of sitcom television really pays off here - and he successfully avoids making a pastiche of Chayefsky's cynically brilliant NETOWRK in favor of his own perceptive humanist view.  Brooks rightfully and continually praises his marvelous BROADCAST NEWS cast; it's a picture dependent on their perfectly pitched performances.",1296345600,11,909,5.080536912751678
308260,5,6301066162,"The producers of NETWORK (1976) might disagree, but BROADCAST NEWS (1987) is the perhaps the most realistic and entertaining portrayal of the television news business that Hollywood has ever produced.

 Written and directed by James L. Brooks, this smart film is, at its core, a romantic comedy, set in a Washington D.C. news bureau and centering around three key characters.

 In her star-making role, Holly Hunter plays a obsessive-compulsive news producer, who must always be in control.  She s being romantically pursued by her closest confident, Albert Brooks, a nerdy, cynical, but very capable news reporter, and the not-too-bright William Hurt, a handsome, sexy, up-and-coming anchorman, whose ethics she detests.

 Which one will win her heart?

 Also in the cast are Robert Prosky, Lois Chiles, Joan Cusack and, in an amusing cameo role, Jack Nicholson.

 The Criterion Collection has released a superb new 2-disc edition of BROADCAST NEWS, featuring many exciting extras, including an interesting alternate ending and several intriguing deleted scenes that feature a colorful character that was cut from the final movie.  Other extras include audio commentary by director Brooks and film editor Richard Marks, a new documentary about Brooks' career, a featurette about the CBS News producer who served as a model for Hunter's character, on-the-set footage and interviews with the stars, plus an accompanying booklet about the picture.

 Despite its topical content, BROADCAST NEWS holds up very well.

308261,5,6301066162,"Of all James L. Brooks' films, Broadcast News is the most successful at merging his T.V. sitcom sensibilities with his cinematic aspirations. His film is not only chock full of truisms about network news but is also an incredibly entertaining and witty romantic comedy that is unafraid to sprinkle moments of compelling drama throughout.

The first disc includes an audio commentary with writer-director-producer James L. Brooks and editor Richard Marks. Rather appropriately, Brooks starts off with talking about the genesis of the film and how the success of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terms-of-Endearment/dp/B001IXXYC4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terms of Endearment</a>&nbsp;affected it. He points out the bits in the film that came from his extensive research and touches upon the casting of the lead roles - for example, Holly Hunter was a last minute addition. Brooks is refreshingly candid and tells all kinds of fascinating filming anecdotes.

Also included is a theatrical trailer.

The second disc starts off with a 36-minute documentary entitled, James L. Brooks - A Singular Voice, with past collaborators singing his praises. It starts off with his trailblazing work in T.V. with 227, The Mary Tyler Moore Show and The Simpsons and how he helped change the medium. It also examines his transition into film and the success of Terms and how it led to Broadcast News.

There is an alternate ending and 19 minutes of deleted scenes with optional commentary by Brooks. The ending is quite visceral and emotionally raw but is fascinating alternative to what is in the final film. For the deleted footage, Brooks talks about why it was cut and puts it into context. Interestingly, an entire subplot involving Tom and his news source was cut out.

Also included is an interview with Susan Zirinsky, a veteran CBS News producer, one of the models for Jane in the film, and an advisor and associate producer. She talks about meeting Brooks for the first time as well as telling amusing and engaging anecdotes that really shed light on how truthful the film is about journalism. This is a fantastic extra and one of the highlights of this edition.

There is a promotional featurette done at the time of the film's release that, at times, plays like an extended trailer only with perceptive interview soundbites from Brooks and the cast. Still, it is interesting to watch. Even better is additional interviews and on-set footage not included in the featurette that runs an impressive 18 minutes. It provides quite a bit of insight into Brooks' intentions and how the film got made.",1295568000,32,2631,5.2673031026252985
308262,3,6301066162,"I suppose Broadcast News merits this deluxe treatment as much as any Michael Bay movie, but it is a far cry from the classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Network/dp/B000CNESU8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Network</a>&nbsp;(1976), which was a much more defining movie in its day.  So, it perplexes me that Criterion would choose to single this movie out.  Brooks is great in creating sitcoms, but this movie reads as little more than an updated version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mary-Tyler-Moore-Show/dp/B00005JLIC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mary Tyler Moore Show</a>&nbsp;with Bill Hurt as a more sophisticated Ted Baxter.

Sure, Holly Hunter is fun to watch and Albert Brooks provides the cynical view one has come to expect from any veteran news reporter, but this movie is pretty much your standard melodrama with Hunter falling in love with Hurt only to find out what a callow person he is, and Brooks, like Murray Slaughter, there to pick her back up again.

The chemistry between William Hurt and Holly Hunter was great, but Albert Brooks stole the movie as Aaron the super intelligent, super nerdy, geeky reporter who has alot going for him, except the ability to get Holly Hunter's character Jane to fall in love with him. I think this was William Hurts second best performance after ""Kiss of the Spider Woman"". His character was so cute and sexy.

I think the stereotype of the good-looking witless anchorman may be a thing of the past, but it sure was an issue back in the 80's when the networks were trying to attract more woman viewers. It was really interesting to see what goes on behind the scene in the world of television news with all the politics, competitiveness and backstabbing.

A fun and funny take on newscasters' love (both of other each other and of their work) in the 1980s, Broadcast News may not have deserved the slew of Oscar nominations it gathered but it's still a very entertaining film that doesn't wear out its welcome and offers 2 hours in the company of people that I'd enjoy spending time with.",1241568000,,350,4.46875
308266,5,6301066162,"Wildly witty and richly textured with raw human connection; James L. Brooks' comedic masterpiece `Broadcast News' is most definitely one of a kind.

Well, talk about spilling it all in the opening sentence.  I don't even know how to follow that up.

The film centers around three working bodies.  You have Tom Grunick, the pretty boy turned TV-Reporter who is embittered with himself for being too good.  He has a knack for something that he doesn't quite understand and it causes him to feel less than deserving; but it's apparently a mock-humility, as if he's searching for manipulated sympathies.  Then you have Aaron Altman, a very gifted and passionate reporter who lacks the presence and connection that Tom so effortlessly oozes.  He is battling his own insecurities as he is surely battling himself, trying to put up a front and become something he's not sure he wants to be.  Stuck in the middle of this testosterone ridden battle is a female producer, Jane Craig, who struggles with her feelings for these two men as she struggles with her feelings about herself and where she is headed; professionally and personally.

`Broadcast News' is not a film merely about television, or the media, or the workplace but is a genuinely sincere look at relationships of the most important kind; the ones we have with ourselves.

Each of these characters is not a whole person.  They are fractures shells of who they are meant to be, still struggling to put all their pieces together and figure out just who they truly are.  Tom is a mess, manipulating himself to believe that his gift is to manipulate the masses.  He believes that selling the news is more important than believing in it.  He has a talent for something he isn't quite sure he cares for, and thus his talent is wasted.  Jane is barely holding herself together as she attempts to separate her personal life from her professional life; a task that has taken its toll on both aspects.  She has scheduled times throughout the day to just cry, as if she spent the remaining twenty-three hours of her day forcing herself not to cry.  Aaron, to me, is the most interesting character because he seems to be the most confused.  His love for Jane feels almost forced, as if he feels that that is how he is supposed to feel, when I get the feeling that he was more in love with Tom than Jane, and his hatred for the man and everything he stood for was more a way for him to reject the feelings he convinced himself were not really there.  His personal life as well as his professional life is a mess and it's because he cannot for one second be honest with himself.

But that's just my take.

The three stars are all wonderful here (thus all garnering Oscar nominations), each one playing off the other with brilliant chemistry and naturalism.  William Hurt is perfectly wounded in his demeanor, as if he is trying to constantly defend his stance even when he doesn't have to; and Brooks (who is lead here, not supporting) is marvelously conflicted, etching the truth within Aaron's lies so wonderfully.  Holly Hunter, in my opinion, is a comic (and dramatic) gem here.  She really understands Jane, who is the moral centerpiece for the film.  She grasps her own demons and conflictions and dilemmas beautifully and creates one of her finest onscreen characters.

The supporting cast, including the brilliant Joan Cusack (she really should be in every movie) and the always amazing Jack Nicholson, is also top notch, but this show belongs to the three leads.

I definitely recommend this film, highly.  It's no wonder that all three leads received nominations at the Oscars, or that the film was up for four other awards that night, including Original Screenplay and Best Picture.  It is a shame that the film lost all seven though, especially since Holly Hunter's performance alone was the best in any category that year; bar none.",1226620800,7,3886,4.732540861812779
308267,5,6301066162,"I saw this when it first came out in 1987, and remembered liking it.  Watched it again last week, and liked it even more.  Its achievement is that it is able to tell a compelling personal story (a love triangle of sorts) at the same time that it takes a snapshot of a pivotal moment in time in an industry critical to American democracy.  It's very different from Network, which mixes black humor and over-the-top satire with a couple of personal stories and a cheesy, poorly realized romance, but the two taken together can tell you a lot about where American news media went wrong.  I think James L. Brooks' script and direction are topnotch, and the three principals, Hunter, (Albert) Brooks, and Hurt are all good. Hunter is brilliant, and Brooks is as real and convincing as he has ever been in anything!

So many movies tack on the romance as an artificial way of generating audience interest.  But this movie makes the romance part of the overall commentary, and the love triangle's eventual resolution is completely intertwined with the film's take on journalistic ethics--such an effective way of delivering a social statement in a personal way that is convincing and integral to the larger story.

Pretty much everyone got nominated for this--Albert Brooks, Hunter, Hurt, and James Brooks.  And they got nothing, unfortunately, losing out to The Last Emperor, Moonstruck, and Wall Street, for goodness' sake.  Still,  a fine movie, well-crafted, intensely acted, and poignant.  And still pretty tight and crisp twenty years later.  Not a lot of excess, even at just over two hours.  Well worth a view.",1215475200,3,1611,4.900369003690037

Of course, Chayefsky did this years earlier in Network (news as entertainment; hijacking of ""objectivity"" for political agenda; ratings ruling and overruling everything; news ""stars"" in front of cameras mattering more to ""corporate"" than good writing and reporting). Chayefsky's take, however, is much darker, less human, and does push the envelope of credulity. Broadcast News is all too accurate. Eerily accurate.

308269,5,6301066162,"Every once in a while Hollywood hits one out of the park.  See this movie.

In a decade mostly unremarkable in terms of cinematic history, ""Broadcast News"" stands out like a polished gem.  There isn't a single aspect of the film---acting, writing, directing---that can be faulted.

Too, it is a rare Hollywood offering which is actually ABOUT something---in this case, the gradual transforming of a television news department into just another cache of profits and entertainment.  All of the characters play their roles skillfully yet humanly and no one is a cardboard cutout.

Director James Brooks passed on any availably facile plot lines and let the story take its own difficult, rocky road, to great artistic advantage.  So many directors would have contrived a glossy romantic wrapup to the film and Brooks, to his credit, resisted that temptation.

Jack Nicholson makes a cameo in a rare, subtle performance which I think is one of his best.

To me, this movie is a veritable litmus test of people and their values.  If you go to see this picture with someone and they say, ""Well, I don't think what William Hurt's character did was so bad,"" you know you're dealing with one kind of person; if another person says, ""Are you kidding? What he did was terrible, a monstrous betrayal!"" you know you're dealing with another kind of person.

But, there is more to this movie than just three co-workers who fight, play, and cry together.  This interesting look at TV news probably best sums up the production of news teams on major networks (ABC, CBS, NBC) as well as CNN, FOX, and MS-NBC.  The overall big picture of this movie is the sensationalizing of news through a handsome anchor (William Hurt's Tom Grunick), informative but dry correspondent (Albert Brooks' Aaron Altmann), and a clever behind-the-scenes producer (Holly Hunter's Jane Craig).  To avoid revealing anymore plot, this lesser-known hit from James L. Brooks probably was too smart for the Oscars.  Now days, this movie probably would be given the attention of more controversial films like ""Good Night, Good Luck"" and such.  Overall, this was probably in my opinion the first serious and also funny look into what journalism really is today.  The DVD quality is decent and expect a reasonable transfer by FOX.  Besides the film, there are the original trailers which are a little grainy.  Unfortunately, there are no extras on this DVD but the quality of the film makes it up.

They each represent an aspect of this transition from intellectual to entertainment.  Their edgy romantic triangle of passion, talent, intellect, professionalism, integrity, friendship and unrequited love is on the surface a fastpaced romantic comedy reminiscent of Hollywood's golden years, and at a deeper level is an accurate mirror of our times, how we got there, who succeeded  and what was lost and won in the process.

I was happy to finally see this arrive on dvd in its proper wide format. Out of curiosity I took out my oft-played VHS copy and compared the compositions. Understanding that many 1.85:1 pictures are merely 1.33:1 aspects with mattes placed on the top and bottom of the frame, I wasn't expecting to be too disappointed with the missing, albeit unintended, visual information. But I have to say - not only is the top and bottom masked off, but the SIDES are zoomed in and cropped as well. In other words you lose information on ALL FOUR SIDES, and it does NOT look good. This CANNOT be what James L. Brooks had in mind...could it?!?! Sorry to say, but this has to be one of the most RARE examples where the ""full-frame"", that is, full aperture is preferred over the letterboxed edition.

308320,5,6301066162,"Amidst the hustle and bustle of a demanding newsroom a love triangle builds right in your living from this witty, romantic, comedy Broadcast News.  Holly Hunter who plays a network news producer falls between pretty-boy anchorman William Hurt and Albert Brooks, who provides contrast as the gifted reporter.  Director James L. Brooks brings this romantic comedy to life through the busy Washington D.C. pressroom.
 With a glimpse into each of the characters' childhood the film brings us thirty years later to a Washington News Network that brings together are three amusing characters.  Jane (Holly Hunter), swiftly finds herself attracted to the new anchorman, Tom (William Hurt) hired for his good looks and camera poise.  Long time friend of Jane, Aaron (Albert Brooks) reveals his true feelings in the midst of Jane and Tom's relationship to create a tangled triangle.  Cutbacks and an unrevealed lie send the trio in their separate ways to be reunited seven years later.
 Holly Hunter is Jane Craig, a lovable, high-strung, control-freak news producer, who falls for a dim-witted, handsome and on the rise anchor William Hurt, who plays Tom Grenick.  No role was more fitting then Aaron Altman performed by Albert Brooks, Brooks's made a hard working and witty veteran reporter complete with his brilliant performance.  Pulling the film together with supporting roles was Lois Chiles, Joan Cusack, and Robert Provosky, not to mention a trivial role as senior anchorman played by Jack Nicholson.
 The setting is the high-stakes world of network television news, and although the technology has changed since the mid 1980's when this was made, the politics and the cutthroat environment are still exactly the same. The soundtrack is mainly dialogue driven lacking any memorable hits. Mainly featuring scene based tunes to keep the film flowing allowing the focus to stay with the actors' performances.
  Jane's dilemma is more in depth then looks versus love; it is an inner struggle tearing her apart. In one hand she has the handsome anchorman that is everything she cannot stand in media and the other is her long-time honest friend who still believes in integrity.  Torn between the choice of integrity and selling the news she takes the new position and starts over.
  The performance from the three actors was outstanding and the accurate portrayal of the network production puts you on set.  This spunky, romantic, comedy is well deserving of its Seven Oscar nominations.  This delightful James L. Brooks film will leave you wondering if it is not too late to consider a new occupation.",1082937600,5,2597,5.130641330166271
308321,5,6301066162,"''It must be nice to always think you're the smartest person in the room,'' she replies, ''No, it's awful'' .... The matter of fact reply to the accusation is of the reasons why I love this movie so much. I initially saw it when it came out in 1987, and although the technology and wardrobe look dated, the film's core may be even more relevant today than it was when initially released and continues to play beautifully due to strong performances and a funny yet unusually incisive script.
Right at the center of  the movie are 3 characters: Jane (Holly Hunter), a news writer-producer for the Washington bureau of a TV network. She is smart and is the ""go to"" person at the network as she works best under pressure and the character who responded to the remark about being the smartest person in a room. Her very best (and possibly only) friend is Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks), a bright, aggressive reporter, who along with Jane, have either true or self-created illusions great looks and intelligence can't coexist. Like Jane, Aaron is also very good at his job, but he wants to be on camera. During a speech that she is giving on the road, Jane meets Tom (William Hurt), an ex-sportscaster who has little education and doesn't know much about current events. But he has been hired for the Washington bureau because he looks good and has a natural relationship with the camera, and isn't that what matters?
Although billed as a romantic comedy, which it is in part, the movie does a brilliant job of how many of us use work to measure who we are and at times use it an excuse to hide from life outside of that myopic perspective. In the course of the movie, the network goes through various upheavals based on the premise that news is losing (or by now has lost) its independence and has become entertainment with talking heads who make us feel good are replacing ""true"" journalists. Although the script is top notch, one of the reasons that movie resonates so well, is that the actors and the director manage to make even the most partisan statements not seem as didactic as they are on paper.
None of the characters is perfect by any stretch of the imagination and the 3 leads are clearly not afraid to be dislikable. Their individual and collective effort works so well that you wind up being very interested/invested in them despite their flaws. This is without a doubt a career-defining performance by Holly Hunter who was robbed of the Oscar as it was given to Cher for her work in ""Moonstruck"" to ""make up"" for not rewarding her work in ""Mask."" William Hurt, a nuanced and complicated actor who was also nominated for the Oscar gives a change of pace performance as someone who's perfectly aware of his intellectual limitations but who sees no reason for them to interfere with his climb to the top. Albert Brooks is brilliant and comes very close to stealing the movie as he is hilarious and to me represents the moral conscience of the movie. He too was nominated for the Oscar and in my opinion was robbed as it was given to Sean Connery for what I think was a career award rather than his work in ""The Untouchables.""
Sidebar: This movie received Oscar nominations in all major categories (Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay among others), the movie was not awarded a single Oscar as it was a year with great movies such as ""The Last Emperor"" and show-stopping performances, as was the case with Michael Douglas in ""Wall Street.""
But back to the movie. Its writer/director, James L. Brooks, who hit a grand slam with ""Terms of Endearment,"" manages not to let any character run away with the movie as he tempers their self-righteousness (as is the case with Hunter and Brooks) and good luck (William Hurt) by making them more than bumper-sticker characters. There is a great line sequence in the movie in which one reporter asks fellow reporters ''Would you tell a source you loved them just to get information?'' The immediate response, ''Yes,'' is followed by laughter all around. In essence although James L. Brooks makes a strong case that the news BUSINESS has blurred many lines, even those of us who think fall on the ""right"" side of said line are not presented as heroes nor are those who apparently cross it vilified. The movie is packed with many one-liners that do more than amuse and makes keen observations without beating your head with them.
This movie easily earns 5 stars and would almost be a perfect movie had it ended without a neatly tied-up last act that ALMOST, but not quite, manages to take away a movie that had only taken a single false step until then. That first false step, in my opinion, is what led to the unnecessary and forced last act. The big ""surprise"" and one character's reaction to it are much to do about nothing in the bigger picture.
Notwithstanding this movie makes very strong statements (a la ""Network"" but much more subtle) about an industry and does so un such an entertaining and intelligent manner that I have to see this movie every few years, which is something that I rarely do. The outcome is almost irrelevant when compared to the joy of seeing these smart people interact with one another. Without a doubt, this is one of 1987's best movies. Enjoy and if you have not seen this movie, you'll be happily surprised by an unbilled performance by yet another amazing actor",1076803200,6,5359,4.6410526315789475
308322,5,6301066162,"The media as purveyors of sensational 'news' in the spirit of good 'salesmanship' and entertainment as opposed to actually reporting unbiased, important events and issues to inform the public, that is journalism, as it was meant to be, is represented in this charming and witty film from the genius of James L. Brooks. (Terms of Endearment, As Good as it Gets) To be fair, some television news organizations attempt to report important events as they happen, avoiding sensationalism, the need to entertain, and maintain a modicum of integrity. But television news is more and more about the dazzling visual, the shocking three- minute sound bite between the all-important advertisements. This film cleverly addresses the question on what is 'real' news and what 'sells'. In the past we sort of had a clue or at least a choice as to what news source was credible, i.e., tabloid-ism and/or serious journalism. It all seems now to be blurred - sensationalism, gossip, opinion, selling and the so-called 'facts' of an event or issue has now appeared to all have melded together in the pursuit of market share and the almighty dollar.
The character, Tom, (William Hurt) is a striving newsreader, and after reading sports at a local station, manages to land a job at one of the big networks. He is a little slow, can't write, and wouldn't know a real story if it dropped on his head, but he's good looking, personable, can at least read, and above all, has the innate ability to sell the birds off the trees. Here is the new force in television journalism - news anchor as television star. Then there is Aaron, (Albert Brooks) the reporter's reporter - brilliant, serious, idealistic and wholly uncharismatic in the popular sense. Although a writer with Pulitzer Prize ability, he attempts to read the news one Sunday night and almost drowns in his own flop sweat. Aaron is not a newsreader but a true writer and investigative journalist, a man who believes in the integrity of his profession. Then, of course, there's Jane, (Holly Hunter) a highly-strung, also brilliant, obsessive news producer, who shares this same idealistic integrity about journalism as her co-worker and best friend, Aaron. The film is about these three diverse and colourful individuals, who are drawn together for the same reasons, ambition and the news, but whose ideas about the news, their values concerning integrity, at least for one, are so different. This film is also about love, relationships and how the passionate desires of the heart do not necessarily match the logic of the head.
At the time of it release, this film was acclaimed as the best romantic comedy to come out in years. It continues to be enormously entertaining and the issues it raises are relevant today. The film truly depicts the world of television news, how its standards have slowly dropped from reporting the events and issues to entertaining us with gossip, sensationalism and that all-important dazzling visual - news is now about entertainment and selling.  This is a film that should be pulled from the shelf occasionally and watched to remind us about integrity, maintaining a high standard in our values, and what great movie making is all about. Five Stars.",1074384000,10,3218,4.95925925925926
308323,5,6301066162,"This is easily one of the wittiest and most entertaining movies I have ever seen.  All the elements of fine filmmaking are here: great acting, great dialogue, and great direction.  The three main actors are all excellent, each one recognized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences with Oscar nominations: Best Actor(William Hurt), Best Actress(Holly Hunter), and Best Supporting Actor(Albert Brooks).  The Original Screenplay also received a nod, as did the Film Editing, Director(James L. Brooks), as well as the Best Picture nomination.  While it did not win any, much to my dismay, I do remember pulling for this film with all my heart.  ""The Last Emperor"" won 9 Oscars, so there wasn't much left over.  This is smart movie-making on all fronts.  Even the romance works here, which is often under considerable scrutiny from me.  Holly Hunter is pursued by two men, at polar opposites with regards to their personalities.  One is the man she is physically attracted to but finds intellectually repulsive, while the other is unattractive physically but is a brilliant and funny companion.  This is intelligent and witty and ultimately warming.  A treasure.",1073520000,3,1169,5.132275132275132
308324,5,6301066162,"What can I say about this film that hasn't already been said? I've seen it countless times, and I still love it. A few years ago I watched it on the suggestion of my mother, since it is one of her favorite movies and I loved it too. Albert Brooks' performance as Aaron is comedic genius. He had so many funny lines, and was an all-around likeable guy, despite the fact that he did come off as whiny on occasion. Holly Hunter played the part of Jane very well, and she seemed like a very real person struggling with her hectic work life and lack of a social life, especially in her scheduled crying jags. William Hurt totally had it in him to play the ""all flash, no substance"" news reporter who may be slightly lost in the big, bad world of news anchoring, but somehow managed to pull it off. Brooks, Hunter and Hurt all deserved to be given the awards that were unfairly received by other actors. This is, and will always be, one of my favorite movies.",1054857600,2,953,4.3
308325,4,6301066162,"Apart from sporting the most powerful newsroom dynamics since His Girl Friday or Up Close & Personal, this film portrays the delicate balance between intelligence and amorous attraction, and in doing so, manages to slink in a gentle poke at the news industry at the same time.

The theme is smart -- an examination of the atavistic obsession with physical appearance and its ultimate triumph over intellect as a valued human attribute. But it doesn't wear geek glasses. Instead, it comes wrapped in an effortless, witty script. The dialogue is crisp and moments abound. The humor is grown-up and in liberal dollops. The performances by the three leads are very credible and make you feel for each of their characters. William Hurt a smooth talking player, Brooks the geek who knows it all but gets all loopy in front of the camera, Hunter their common denominator. Jack Nicholson and John Cusack turn in surprise cameos that don't hurt the overall experience at all.

One could speculate that this movie didn't walk away with any Academy statuettes despite being nominated in several categories because the very interesting build-up did not culminate into a neat little ending that would satisfy everyone. A small Hollywood-inclined part of me feels that it could have ended a little differently too. This discontent stems perhaps from a hopeful optimism to see things work out between people whom we have seen trying to be with each other, but it does reflect the starkness of romance in the real world.

These truths may not be everyone's cup of bitter machiato, but overall, the bustle of the warm bumbling interactions between regular people trying to make it in a cut-throat industry and finding some meaning in their lives in the process, is definitely worth a ride. I get glued to this film even after having seen this several times, and that is saying something.",1049932800,6,1870,4.93015873015873
308326,5,6301066162,"BROADCAST NEWS marks the first time I saw Holly Hunter, and I was mesmerized at her focus, quickness, passion, and finally her eccentric prettiness and sex appeal. The movie is hers from start to finish, and makes the 'love triangle' subplot almost unnecessary. She's so smart in the film (a rarity for a lead female character) that you almost think if her only romantic choices are William Hurt's style-but-no-substance anchor or Albert Brooks's neurotic but intellectually arrogant reporter, she'd be better off with Robert Prosky. I guess some of my feelings mirror what San Diego Darren said down below, but it dosen't stop me from being a bit p'od at Albert Brooks. His was the character I identified with the most- the guy who's always seen as a 'brother' to the girl he really loves, and my favorite scene in the whole film is him getting the chance to kiss Hunter romantically. (It's preceded by a truly poignant moment of him confessing how much he loves her.) When he goes petulant later in the story, it's a bit hard to take. Fortunately, the James Brooks script and direction are a joy throughout, culminating in two perfect scenes: one with Joan Cusack unraveling seconds before a tape feed, and a marvelous 360 (?) pan thru the studio showing a live news feed from producer to anchor in one shot.",1040860800,,1310,4.75
308327,5,6301066162,"This is a great movie, explaining why Rolling Stone Magazine named it one of their Top Ten Films of the 1980s.  The behind-the-scenes portrayals of newsroom activities and personnel are pricelessly entertaining and interesting, though I have no way of knowing whether it was realistic.  I do know, however, that some of the plot details which touched upon journalism principles and practices were substantively accurate, thus it's appropriate to extend some credence to the rest of the material.
The character Aaron Altman, however, was an absolute simpering sniveling twinkie pantywaist from the word Go, and it's no wonder a dynamo like Jane Craig (albeit she was a tad flaky) kept finding other guys upon whom to focus her attraction.
And William Hurt's anchor-star Tom was a fine snapshot of the sorts of fifty-dollar-haircut, five-dollar-brain men our major broadcast TV networks put in the anchor spots for their evening news programs.  Hurt completely nailed that role to the wall.",1026345600,7,988,5.2405063291139244
308328,5,6301066162,"Broadcast News is a minute glimpse into the world of the Fourth Estate. It provides the viewer with an insight into the lives of three budding journalists. Amidst their differences, these three journalists have two things in common. All three of them are highly ambitious and share a sense of determination that it takes to achieve their goals. The movie also reveals the hard work that goes into the creation of a great journalist, and the thrills and spills that come with being a member of the media. But the movie also provides the viewer with a glance of something different - the loneliness that accompanies all the pomp and glory. It is as though it is a mesage to those aspiring to be journalists - ""The road is rough, and if you don't think you can handle the ride, get off before it's too late."" In other words, the view that the life of a journalist is standing in front of a camera and reading a script is a facade. The movie reveals the reality and the harshness involved with living the life of a jornalist.",1013472000,,1021,4.46524064171123
