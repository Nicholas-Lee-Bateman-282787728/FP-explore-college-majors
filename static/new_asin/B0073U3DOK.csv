5053527,3,B0073U3DOK,"This is not a normal war movie or a normal any kind of movie. It has a strange sense of humor and is worth buying used and watching once. I mailed it to my nephew in the 75th Rangers doing his 5th Afghan tour. I'll wait to see his take. In the mean time, the best tagline for it is the quote ""SMOKE FOR THE LADY?""",1347235200,,313,3.757575757575758
5053528,3,B0073U3DOK,"""It's a war, my job is to report what I see."" When journalist Luke Benning (Stahl) is on a job in Afghanistan he catches a Canadian sniper cutting the fingers off of his taliban kills. When his paper refuses to print the story he quits and returns to the country to investigate further but soon finds that the fighting and tension has become much worse then when he left. There have been a recent influx of ""embedded reporter"" movies lately but they have all to this point been entertaining. While this was also a good movie and kept me interested it is basically another version of movies like ""5 Days To War"" or the ""Bang Bang Club"" (both of which I thought were better). Stahl does a good job and the movie is tense and thought provoking but like so many movies lately it seems to just copy everything else that is being released. I did like this one but ""Bang Bang Club"" was a better version. Overall, a movie worth watching but a new idea was needed to make it stand out. I give it a B-.",1334880000,,992,4.281914893617022
8509403,2,B0073U3DOK,"A long favorite of mine, Nick Stahl still looks ""fine"" in yet another film, and his acting is still terrific, but this is a tough story to watch - and since its a true story, its tough to embellish certain facts I know.  However, if not for Stahl, I wouldn't have watched it at all.......`",1522022400,,289,4.254545454545455
8509404,5,B0073U3DOK,"Great movie. Good cast. I've watched it twice, I get the comic yet dark humor; the movie's basically about the ridiculousness of it trying to make sense of something that can't be made sense of. Humor is a great healer.",1519689600,,219,4.5

8509407,5,B0073U3DOK,"Interesting film starring talented actor Nick Stahl, who seems to carefully choose his roles, often with long time periods between films. This entertaining film mixes relevant subject matter with bits of ironic humor. Definitely worth the couple hours of watching.",1481241600,,264,5.625

8509409,5,B0073U3DOK,"This is based on a real journalist's 'exploits', returning to Afghanistan more than once, in search of a soldier believed to be slightly unconventional to the point he probably could have been charged with war crimes if his perspective on this so-called Conflict (War is War to me, no matter what new title it's given) was not considered by the masses who eat up whatever propaganda the media decides to feed us or hide from us. I believe the journalist even takes a part in the screenwriting/directing. If it was me who encountered things this man did, I surely would not return. The movie is interesting; it gave me one more possible reason for the US to want to get involved in a country's affairs, when the country is very obviously against our presence there. I think Afghan Luke started his obsession in pursuit of a certain story, but ended up realizing this was a moot effort. This topic is too political for me to write a review without ranting... suffice it to say, I think no matter what way you feel about US involvement in foreign affairs... or what you think is going on over there.. This movie deserves watching. What you come away with, I can't say- I can only say it gave me one more reason to say get our men out. That being said, I'll shut up.",1433289600,,1262,4.467532467532467
8509410,4,B0073U3DOK,"Having been deployed to  Afghanistan, I found the film entertaining but very unrealistic!",1415059200,,89,5.846153846153846
8509411,2,B0073U3DOK,"Leaves no military or Afghan cliche unturned - cardboardy, two-dimensional characters.

Clincher:  Military sergeant, when shot, says ""There goes my gun"" when the horse where his rifle is hanging gallops away.  You can tell that there was no military advisor/consultant in the credits.

In the ""Making Of"" micro-documentary, the writer says it's not an anti-war movie, but one where it shows how everyone goes a bit crazy in war.",1407628800,,429,5.173913043478261
8509412,1,B0073U3DOK,"For details on the movie plot, see the other reviews. The basic premise of the movie is the reporter's efforts to get the story of anti-taliban Canadian snipers who have the habit of cutting off a finger from every successful hit. The movie works this up as if it were some egregious sin, totally ignoring the worse atrocities of war---like blowing people up and exploding their heads with direct sniper hits. The story takes us to all sorts of different places in Afganistan in order to get to the location where the Canadian snipers are. Boring. Let's get on with it. Acting is good, locations are interesting, but that alone cannot save this boring dog.",1368835200,,656,4.71304347826087
