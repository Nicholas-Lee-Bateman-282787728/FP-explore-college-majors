7910756,5,B00000IKZ2,I always show this video as an introduction to the study of Mexico in my undergraduate college classes.  It provides an excellent background for study of the New World!  The students are fascinated by it!  Good use is made of quotes read by actors and the music sets the stage beautifully!  I highly reccomend this video for use in the classroom!  I have used it for several years and intend to continue doing so as I have not found a video that better tells the tale!,1006819200,,468,4.395348837209302
