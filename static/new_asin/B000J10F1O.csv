8148640,5,B000J10F1O,The kids loved the hip hop music and danced along with the music cpying all the moves on the dvd,1378771200,,96,3.85
8148641,3,B000J10F1O,This compared to the Tracy Anderson Mat DVD I bought on the same day arrived so quickly for a vacation with my 2 3 and 5 year old neices.  It was so funny to watch them do the dances and they wanted to do it over and over every day.  I only thought the video's quality and music sounded like it was very old as if it were created over 10 years ago but the girls didn't care.,1285027200,4,374,3.782051282051282
8148642,4,B000J10F1O,Just right for the beginner. Simple and easy to understand. This my third order for this set of beginning dance steps.,1208822400,2,118,4.666666666666667
8148643,2,B000J10F1O,"This kept my daughter interested for a whole 3 seconds. She was absolutely not interested in watching this. The music was a little out dated, as were the dance moves, and they are more for someone trying to learn a routine than someone trying to learn to dance.",1178409600,,261,4.458333333333333
8148644,4,B000J10F1O,"I got this video for my two nieces, ages 4 & 9, and they say this is just like their dance classes (which mom paid $60 & $90 each for 2 months). According to mom, this video teaches better moves than what they learned in class. This is a great video for the absolute beginner who do not have any prior dance experience. The instructor keeps an excellent pace that is easy to follow. My only complaints are that the instramental music is not so great (learn the steps & use with your own music), the video is very short and there is only 1 dance routine to learn. This would have been a better video if it included beginner, intermediate, and advance dance routines with more modern upbeat music. I recommend this video for the beginner dancer only.",1176336000,5,748,4.388489208633094
