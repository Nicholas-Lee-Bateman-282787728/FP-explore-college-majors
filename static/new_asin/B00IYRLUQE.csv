8646511,4,B00IYRLUQE,"The back page states ""this Special Edition has been restored digitally to its present condition"" and prior to the film starts playing there's a panel saying the film was restored by Kit*Parker*Films in 2013.  On the whole, the restoration work is pretty successful, close-ups look especially good (and there quite a lot of those), indoor scenes are also mostly OK but the long-shots are grainy and colors faded. Still, it is certainly way, way, way better than the Mill Creek Entertainment issue published as 20 Spaghetti Westerns (on 5 discs). And IMHO this somewhat unusual western is worthy  to stand on its own, and at just under $5 what's not to like?",1508630400,,656,4.848214285714286
