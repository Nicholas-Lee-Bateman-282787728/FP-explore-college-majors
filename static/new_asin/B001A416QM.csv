8527364,3,B001A416QM,"Ok, I purchased this same exact DVD (there are 3 DVD's inside with a Black/White picture book inside) From another site.. and I DID NOT pay over $200 for it. I payed $94 and some change. I think I spent my money well also. Because there are over 20 songs and They also show the Encore, there is a second Encore and an hours worth of backstage footage.  BUT NEVER ON MY LIFE.. would I pay $200 for it...  I am rating this 3 stars.. ONLY BECAUSE of the price.. the DVD is awesome though...  Should be in any GazettE fan's collection.",1228176000,,531,4.186274509803922
