Especially if it would have been filmed in England instead of New Zealand.
What I don't like is the fact that Blyton's books have been modernized and so have the Blyton based TV series...why???
""Tom Sawyer"" and ""Robinson Crusoe"" are still popular among young readers and never have been modernized. So why Blyton?

For me the charm and fascination of the many Blyton's books always came from the fact that they have been written in the 30's/40's/50's and that was much more interesting for me than the modernized Blyton series like ""The Famous Five"" from the 70's.

There is one good example that it still can be done the right way. Just watch the 90's remake of ""The Famous Five"" TV series and you will be pleasantly surprised.
The 90's series sticks to the time when it was written, the actors wear vintage clothes from the 50's, the cars are old etc.

The problem with the modernized Blyton TV series (The Secret series and the Adventure series) is the fact that New Zealand has no castles. This should have been filmed in the UK!",1397606400,,1146,4.607843137254902
