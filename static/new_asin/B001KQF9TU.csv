3668263,5,B001KQF9TU,"What to say... This movie is a popular classic for a reason! I didn't know what to expect and was pleasantly surprised. The character of prem is typical rich kid but he was unexpectadly sweet and kind to Suman right from the start. RIght from the start the chemistry between the two is great.  THe way there friendship grows into love is super sweet as well. I especially loved the songs, the only downside is they are not subtitled, but you don't feel like your missing much because they act out a lot of what the song is about. Watching prem fight to prove his love in the second half is what we expect and anticipate as we watch these wonderfully over the top films! Get ready to fall in love!",1397174400,,696,4.312977099236641

3668266,4,B001KQF9TU,"Suitable for family. Very old fashioned with some pleasant songs. If your a lover of old style American films and have just fallen in love with old and new Bollywood like I have , you will love this one. The only silliness is being a little overdone on the action scenes at the end and all the American action movies are just as guilty of that flaw everyday of the week. It's much harder to do low tech stunts than high tech ones so after I stopped laughing (I laughed at Arnold Swarzenegger's high tech stunts too ) I thought about how much harder it must be. AFTER I stopped laughing. It's still just too cute a movie to pass up. The violence is very cartoonish with ring of thugs pouncing on the hero and punches occasional kick to the groin etc so shouldn't bother very young ones unless they're really sensitive. The pigeon never gets hurt I swear.

 The story is very good and the dancing and songs are like a true musical and move the plot forward or contribute scenes of life. Good Mix of Laughter vs Tears ratio .Good use of LOCAL talent for a change, not a bunch of half dressed skanky looking Bar flies. Very sweet young girl role , meets very handsome honest young man while staying at his parents house. Easy plot line to follow for anyone over 7 or so . She falls in love with Salman and then gets picked on by local rich evil snobs who are trying to control his father. The son gets engaged via his mom one afternoon when his mom realizes how much the young couple loves each other. Problem , the  son is told by his father that night he's to marry the evil girl who's brother tried to attack his love. His dad's choice stinks, that whole nasty family is cartoon evil.  When Salman refuses evil chick, he is disowned and thrown out. He has to works hard manual labor in a rock quarry near his loves home after HER dad points out that he has no way to support a wife now that he has left his family. Sheer working mans revenge. Enjoy that part all you want.( picture the Donald in a rock quarry..too tempting... You know you want to. It's human ). He proves himself over and over and almost get's killed a few times but in the end of course the lovers reunite after they're stubborn fathers make up and go back to being financially unequal but happy friends.

There is a very good overall moral tale;  love of family and friends is more important than money and honest work is needed to earn anything of value . Just try not to judge the ending to harshly for the silliness factor. I just let reality go out the window and have a good laugh and or cry . The kids will love it..subtitles are a great way to practice your reading...sneaky but true.",1333929600,,2660,4.278330019880715
3668267,5,B001KQF9TU,"This is the movie that introduced me to Salman Khan and I've loved his movies ever since. I grew up in Eastern Europe where Bollywood movies were played often.

Love this movie. A lovely, moving love story. Salman Khan is very good, goofy and funny. I absolutely LOVE the music. A great movie.",1316563200,2,293,4.528301886792453
3668268,4,B001KQF9TU,"Maine Pyar Kiya is my favorite movie of all time, and I searched for a DVD after having seen it for the first time this year. When I saw it on Amazon for only $9.99, the price was right! The product detail says that it is created upon order, and the packaging is just as a normal DVD bought in the store. The quality of the DVD is a 10/10 and the movie looks and sounds excellent. No menus, no special features, just the movie. The subtitles are excellent as well!",1307404800,,464,4.1098901098901095
3668269,4,B001KQF9TU,"This is about 2 old friends who haven't seen each other for years. One has left his poor roots (partly due to his old friend) and become wealthy. The poorer one has a daughter and the wealthier one a son. Poorer Dad has to go oversees for work for 6 months and reconnects with old friend so that daughter can stay safely there in his absence. Of course daughter and son fall in love. Wealthy Dad won't approve a wedding because of the status difference. There is also a shady 'friend' of wealthy Dad plotting so his daughter can marry the son and he can get his hands on the wealth. Will the love birds succeed in their marriage...? (Actually there's also an actual 'love bird': a carrier pigeon who becomes a player in events and even a hero at the end!)

This is dated a bit as it is 1989. But if you can overlook the 80s fashion and hairdos (and th4e posters of Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen on the boy's wall!), the story is a good Bollywood melodrama romance. I don't relate to the music of the period and there is a lot of it (including a couple of songs that went on and on). The 'heart' in the movie built in the second half and I even managed a few tears!

However the acting is mostly good. The girl is fine but didn't particularly stand out for me (but then I'm female too and tend to notice the males more!). However Salman Khan is excellent (never thought I'd write that!). It is interesting to look back to this, his second movie and first really big starring role and see what people saw in him. I can find him a bit mixed- good at times but not relating when he does 'comedy' in the hammy way the Indians seem to like. But here he is innocent, sincere, gorgeous, a good actor and dancer- a great teen romantic hero. He won 2 awards for this movie at the time (and the film itself also won an award.

If you like Bollywood romances and don't mind the age of this it is worth a visit. Elsewhere on the Net it rates above average mostly (e.g. 7-8 out of 10). That's where I'd put it too. A keeper.",1243468800,10,2018,4.195876288659794

8315816,4,B001KQF9TU,"Prem (Salman Khan) returns home from the US to find Suman (Bhagyashree) visiting with his family. She and he become fast friends, which eventually blossoms into love.  Prem's rich father is completely against a match with Suman; Suman's father reacts to this by also forbidding a marriage.  Prem must work hard to earn the right to marry her.

This is a sometimes silly movie, occasionally overacted, but thoroughly enjoyable.  It is Salman Khan's first leading role, and both his talent and charisma are fully apparent.  Bhagyashree did an excellent job as a gentle teenager feeling first love.

The music and choreography are not memorable, and the fight scenes were a bit over the top.  However, the story was sweet and the emotions portrayed were realistic.  Overall, it's a movie that leaves the viewer happy for having watched it.

(On a side note: I loved the pigeon!)",1489449600,,875,4.938356164383562

8315818,5,B001KQF9TU,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! The story is very clich in Bollywood, with two people who love each other with different backgrounds being denied being together and the greedy, dishonest people conniving against them, but Salman really makes this movie. He really proves he loves his woman!",1446336000,,279,5.086956521739131

8315821,5,B001KQF9TU,"I see that most of the reviewers here are talking about Salman Khan and his acting. However, despite Salman's good acting, Maine Pyar Kiya is definitely a Bhagyashree movie. Her expressions through out the movie are priceless (especially, during Prem's confession of his love for her, Antakshari, and when Reema Lagood tells Prem that she has found a bride for him). Too bad that after this movie, she set her priorities somewhere else. Otherwise, who knows she could have been a better fit in HAHK for Madhuri Dixit. I would say that it was probably Bollywood's loss.
Now, she is back in media. I really hope they make a sequel to this movie with her in the lead role. Just watched this movie after such a long time. So far I was thinking that DDLJ was the best Hindi movie, but after seeing Maine Pyar Kiya, I think this is my number one hands down.",1429747200,,851,4.496774193548387
