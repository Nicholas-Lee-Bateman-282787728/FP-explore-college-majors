8601725,5,B00E65M5M6,"For anyone that spent time as a trainspotter or has nostalgic memories of British Railways, this is money well spent. Excellent look at the historical aspects of British Railways from steam days to Diesel. My only complaint is that there was more time dedicated to Steam than Diesel and, as a Diesel/ Electric man of the time I would love to see more coverage of those times that I remember so well and so fondly. Excellent DVD though and a worthwhile addition to any train enthusiasts collection.",1422835200,3,497,4.724137931034483
8601726,5,B00E65M5M6,I am British and so is my husband.  Trains are his passion and as we are in our 70's he remembers the age of steam.  He collected train numbers as a boy.  Wonderful old footage and brought back many happy memories.  A wonderful birthday gift for him.,1415145600,,250,4.25531914893617

8601728,5,B00E65M5M6,"Being  baby boomer I grew up in the fifties & sixties in England,traveling frequently by steam train which was in those days such an adventure. I enjoyed the 2 disc DVD very much although I found the second disc more enjoyable of the two.
The first disc was too much focused on the experience of a local branch line unlike the second disc which had a much broader outlook from its heyday to the dimise of steam. If I only received the first disc I would have only given a three star rating ,but the second standing on its own is worth a full five stars!",1407974400,2,553,4.216981132075472
