8167934,1,B000MD1JAA,"Old useless crap. Nobody wants to see these fools sitting around talking, not blowing glass.. And when they do its outdated stupid pipes that nobody likes anyway.. Get with the times. It's all about rigs and dabs",1429920000,,212,4.756756756756757
8167935,1,B000MD1JAA,"I was hoping for either some how toos and view of some interesting pipe work.  This production lack focus and tried to do a little bit of everything. In the end it did nothing well. The comedic segues were lame, poorly acted and completely unentertaining. They spent an interesting amount of time in a couple of trade shows that displayed some interesting and artistic pipes but they never showed much.  Some of the best pieces could be only viewed for seconds in the video.  You did get to see a lot of green painted walls. I would give my copy away if there was someone I really hated that much.",1424131200,,597,4.409090909090909
8167936,2,B000MD1JAA,"""Dr. Glass"" is an entertaining character, the artwork is beautiful, good interviews and footage of artists at work, and a little anecdotal history of glass pipe art. Two guys on a roadtrip who turned it into a ""documentary"". It's really just taking a roadtrip with these guys to see meet and talk to some contemporary artists at work and an art showcase. Not a professional, historical or political documentary.",1387584000,,411,4.971014492753623
8167937,1,B000MD1JAA,"If you do anything in the glass trades, this DVD offers nothing video wise. There is a stupid dork throughout the entire video that apparently has a hatred for acrylic bongs. He pops in and out destroying bongs. The cover of this DVD is impressive, but the actual learning sections lack many steps to achieve those different pieces. I always look for new releases from artists to improve my Lampworking skills. Amazon should pull this product. TERRIBLE!!!",1377820800,4,455,4.922077922077922
8167938,1,B000MD1JAA,"Don't waste your money on this DVD.  It was neither informative, or entertaining.  I feel that the creators of this flick owe me $20 bucks and an hour of my life back.  The movie did not even touch on foreign competition as well as even mentioning pressures from the US Govt.  The counterculture was touched upon, but it seemed like the producers did not have enough footage to complete the film, so they added their own annoying skits in-between scenes.

I will never watch this movie again, or recommend it to anyone else.  I will most likely circular file it.",1349913600,4,562,4.57
8167939,5,B000MD1JAA,"This dvd is not only informative, but has great music and a hilarious storyline.  I bought two dvds to give as gifts to people who enjoy the artistry of the glass blowers and the funny story of a road trip in search of ""glass"".",1168819200,4,227,4.159090909090909
8167940,5,B000MD1JAA,"I picked this DVD up hoping the learn a little about how glass pipes are made.  I got exactly what I bargained for and more.

The DVD is full of killer footage of flaming glass being worked by master glassblowers, while a narrator explains what's going on with the glass on the screen.  Some seriously cool pipes being made, great music, and a cool chill out DVD with nice fireworks.

I would highly recommend it to anyone who has ever marveled at the beauty of a glass pipe.  It'll help you appreciate and understand your piece more.",1168214400,5,534,4.463917525773196
