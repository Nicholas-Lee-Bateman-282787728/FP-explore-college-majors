4485746,1,B004W75BQU,"I am a little disappointed.  I have bought the DVD's they released up to the last one that took me up to episode 205 and I was looking forward to episode 206 onwards.  Now suddenly the newest releases are starting from the beginning again.  Firstly why could they not have done these larger sets from the start, I would have paid extra for them at that time?  Will they go on to release the episodes 206 onwards on DVD in the future?  Or is 205 the end on DVD?  I can see that the DVD's are at a reasonable price but having bought the previous ones I do not have the money to buy duplicates even if they are in bigger sets.  I will keep an eye on the releases in case they either start releasing from 206 along side these new earlier episode releases and see what happens in over a years time when they once again reach 205 in these new collection sets.",1311984000,5,853,4.133333333333334
4485747,5,B004W75BQU,26 episodes for 20 dollars is a hell of a great deal. If you give the anime a chance it will surprise you. It's definitely a great anime with a good and fun story. It's a long running anime that won't end soon just give it a chance and see what happens. Hopefully we get some news about a season 4 soon. No reason or excuse not to pick this up.,1311638400,,344,3.859154929577465
4485748,5,B004W75BQU,"I'm so happy they are continuing to release One Piece as 26-episode box sets rather than the 11-13 episode ones for so much cheaper. Hopefully they won't be making anymore of the ""fourth voyage...ninth voyage"" nonsense and just keep it simple to Collection 1, 2, 3, 4. For a 500-episode series, 26 episodes is much better collection-wise than just 11-13 episodes per box set. The box art is interesting, but I really enjoyed the box art they had for the smaller season sets. Hopefully these have the same special features as those did. Funimation already does this for their other titles like Yu Yu Hakusho, so I'm glad they are doing it to One Piece as well. Every company should release 26-episode sets (depending on the episodes in the series). As usual, FUNimation delivers a great dub and original Japanese dialog if you so choose. Much better than the 4kids dub, although I miss some of the original voices, these voices you grow to enjoy. I love that they dub the OPs and EDs in the series, and although some are not really good, at least they put forth the effort... probably because it had to be aired on TV and all. Overall, thanks FUNimation for making this necessary change. I will buy this right now!",1311465600,,1213,4.62037037037037
4485749,4,B004W75BQU,"This is great that One Piece is finally getting a *GOOD* dvd release,and trust me I wouldn't be saying it was good already if it wasn't funimation releasing it. This product is at a great price only 20 bucks for 26 episodes versus 25-40 dollars they charge for FMA and Dragon Ball Kai. It's probably because it's an older series but still.

I do, however, have a few minor complaints. Why no blu ray? It's been shown that even things shot in standard definition can look great on blu ray and you can fit all 26 episodes on three discs even 2 if they sacrifice a little quality,but it's understandable that there is no blu ray so not that big of a deal. Now the second complaint is minor yet important. One Piece has about 500 episodes at this point. If this set was released when funimation started dubbing it would have been better, and if they continue to release episodes in groups of 26 it's going to cost a fortune to get all of them. They should release about 50 episodes per a set instead and do 6-8 discs. Of course they would charge more but I don't imagine to much more.

Anyways happy I can finally ad this to my collection.",1309651200,4,1135,4.323943661971831
4485750,1,B004W75BQU,"There's no reason for them to be releasing 4 disks per set, and then only giving 24 episodes.

Even if it isn't HD they could still fit 100+ episodes on one disk.

This is no different from what they did with DBZ, they see that people love this show and find a way to milk every single penny they can.",1308700800,8,301,4.0
4485751,5,B004W75BQU,I like the series and Funimation it self as an company one of the most companies that deliver great and good voice acting to there anime they put there heart and soul into the anime like One Piece to Full Metal Alchemsit at a good price for one full season. I just got back into One Piece and love it hoping to give funimation my money for this anime with great story lines and even great characters. Glad they stick to the series openings and endings dub way to go Funimation for there choices of singers who are very good at there job you make this One Piece fan very happy.,1307318400,9,576,4.198198198198198
4485752,5,B004W75BQU,"Previously, One Piece was released in 13 episode sets for around $35.  NOW, Funimation is unleashing these larger, 24 episode sets!  Having seen Funimations One Piece dubs previously, these are greatly acted and the quality was great on their last One Piece sets.  For the lower price AND a full 24 episodes, THIS is the time to buy One Piece in America!!!  I preordered and will update my review upon arrival and completion.",1304812800,81,425,4.780821917808219

4485771,4,B004W75BQU,"Most Recent Review after watching Collections 1-5: Aside from the small glitch in 1 of the 4 DVDs in Collection 1. I have watched Collections 1-5, and am currently watching Collection 6. I'm really new to One Piece. I just became a fan maybe 4 months ago? It's March 2017 now. I've plowed through the Manga around the same time too. I'm currently on Manga 76 of the 80+ volumes. I've never watched the anime before and am enjoying the series and storylines not covered in the manga. I'm watching the movies as well. The series gets better with time and it's AWESOME to see the manga come to life on the screen. The dubbing for these collections is AWESOME. I feel spoiled that I don't even have to wait for episodes to come out. Once I catch up with the collections, I will pre-order the next one). The One Piece animation gets better with time... same for the storyline as well. Eiichiro Oda is a genius and I'm glad I took a chance and became a fan even late in the game.

Initial Review from watching Collection 1 only: I recently became a One Piece Fan from the Manga so I wanted to watch the series as well. The look of the DVD is awesome. The quality is okay, not great. But, I wasn't expecting any amazing quality for the beginnings of the show. I took a star off because one of the episodes on the DVD freezes and then skips. I ended up catching this a little past the return/replace date because I don't have the time to binge watch and then catch it. Sucks that the Collection One has this problem in one of the discs because it made me wary about buying future collections. Luckily, I'm on the 3rd Collection now and so far no other flukes, but one of the discs for Collection 1.",1487376000,,1690,4.297805642633229

4485775,3,B004W75BQU,"I remember seeing a dub of of One Piece as a kid, the most glaring difference between what I saw then and in this collection is the opening theme.  Another one is Sanji's voice actor is completely different in this series, he had a much deeper voice than what he has now.  Overall though not much difference between then and this until you get to collection two where it seems as though they took out an entire scene in Luffy's fight against Arlong.  It's still good and worth the money, but I can't give it even 4 stars when they claim to be unedited and I noticed some very big differences and even a few outtakes.",1483315200,2,616,4.293103448275862

Marathon option and commentaries are nice, something you definitely can't get with Crunchy Roll.  My only gripe is that the dub version uses dubbed vocals on the songs which sounds like a cat in a bag being beaten with sticks.

4485799,5,B004W75BQU,I love Funimation there my favorite dubbing company when it comes to anime. They Always know how to do everything right. Do great translations of the Japanese script. Have the characters lip movements match there what there saying. Only doing necessary edits. And most Importantly get good and talented voice actors that are better then there Japanese counterparts and this dub is no exception. I'm really glad that Funimation rescued One Piece from 4kids in 2007 and finally gave the uncut version we all have been waiting for.,1452297600,3,528,5.011363636363637

I now bring it to watch it with my younger cousins (ages 9 and younger) and they love it. It has some cursing n violence but the kids don't care they enjoy the funny and adventuress stoy line. All in all this is one of the top Japanese anime today. Over 718 episodes (most have yet to be translated) and 807 manga chapters and it still is continuing. I will always be addicted to it. I laugh with the show, I cry with it, I get mad when the characters are mad. The show is better than anything on American TV today in my honest opinion.",1449619200,,815,4.1

I love how the stories combine both comedy and heart. There are some stories that really tug at your heart strings like Usopp's and Zoro's back story. I love that each of the characters gets fully fleshed out and that in just a simple one half hour back story, you get an idea of where the character has come from and what drives them. I feel it really allows you to empathize with the character.

Even though the series can be cheesy sometimes, overall it's a very fun series and will have you hooked within the first few episodes. I recommend this series to any one who likes adventure themed stories mixed with a bit of comedy and heart.",1412380800,,814,4.3841059602649

4485862,5,B004W75BQU,"This is my review from tv.com

This is and still remains one of the best anime series still running. What I like best about this series is it doesn't use the pirate stereotypes like Hook or Pirates of the Carribean. Each pirate has their own personality. The Strawhats are very likable and some of the villains have humor to them like Buggy the Clown or are completely evil like Captain Kuro. This show is so awesome in Japan there is even One Piece toilet paper. I'm not even joking, this series is that good.

If I had to choose my favorite Strawhat, it would be Sanji because his flirtatious nature is very funny, yet he can be depended on and he is a great cook.",1411689600,,666,4.32

in short, if you want better (and even animated) subtitles, watch the fansubs Kazioku subs are the best",1377993600,,581,4.37037037037037
4485905,5,B004W75BQU,"There are no words to describe this show except for Epic.  At first I thought this show was going to be a silly kid's show with not the best animation style.  After thinking this for many years, and mocking it for the always remembered 4kids version, I decided to take on the beast of an anime with 500+ episodes.  Best decision I have ever made.  It starts of really rocky at first, but once you reach Arlong park, the necessity to keep going urges you on.  After entering the grand line the story just gets better and better.  As the straw hat pirate's ship grows in experience and crew mates, my interest continues to grow.  Once I reached Water 7 there was no going back.  The story line that the author/mangaka, Eiichiro Oda, created is the most incredible tale I have ever heard.  Not only does the world make you forget all about your own, but the story and characters make you want to leave reality and join the Mugiwara (strawhat) crew.  No show or anime has ever made me feel this or at least to this extent.  I have now rewatched the whole show two times all the way through and have dragged a lot of my friends into this addictive tale.  They would have it no other way.  Oda is a master at story telling to the point where I was crying with every character and even over the loss of a certain ""nakama"" I never thought I would cry over.  The only other word is Brilliance.  Sheer Brilliance.  This show is my favorite anime of all time. I would say it is also in my favorite top 3 stories of all time, if not top 2. :)  Thank you for your brilliance, Oda, and for caring about us over here, Funimation. :)",1377129600,2,1617,4.249180327868852

You get to meet 5 of the crew in this first DVD which is great, its a whole cast full of great characters.

This is an ongoing manga/anime series with currently 753 chapters and 654 episodes. However the english dub is only available till episode 336 and till 348 will be available in September 2014.

If you own the voyages DONT BUY THIS it's not worth it. But if you don't own the voyages then this is the set for you. This set contains episodes 1-26 i.e 26 episodes and is only for $15 but two voyages, season 1 voyage 1 and 2 make up the episodes in this collection and add upto a total cost of around $45 which is three times the cost.
Collections vs Season sets
Pros
1. They are dirt cheap
2. They contain twice as many episodes as the season sets
3. They have better packaging

Cons
1. They are 97 episodes behind the season sets
2. The period between consecutive releases in the Collections is way longer than in the season sets.
If you can't wait and year or two for the newest english dub releases than go ahead and buy the season sets but if your budget is limited and you don't mind staying 100 episodes behind the latest releases then buy the collections.
THE COLLECTIONS ARE JUST TWO VOYAGE SETS COMBINED TOGETHER AND DO NOT CONTAIN ANY EXTRA CONTENT.

(SPOILERS AHEAD)
One Piece Collection 1
This set contains the Romance Dawn Arc - the beginning of One Piece. It's till the part where they reach Baratie.
In terms of video quality this set is pretty good considering it is in 480p
In terms of audio quality and dubbing funimation has done an excellent job. We get 3 audio options
1. English Dolby 5.1 surround
2. English Mono
3. Japanese Stereo
This set is packaged beautifully although the discs have no disc art.

One Piece DVDs to buy:
1. Collection 1-10 (Cost approx $170)
2. Seasons 1-5 (Cost approx $ 340 and around $260 for the same episodes as in the collections)

Overall this was a satisfactory buy for me and I recommend any One Piece fan to buy this. (Provided you don't own the season sets)",1375488000,7,2071,4.3549222797927465

The story is great.. despite the fact that luffy can be and is an  idiot 95% of the time ,he has the respect.... for the  most part,of  his crew. He will help out in the most dangerous of situations even if your a complete stranger. He is quick in fist and slow in thought but he is capable of thinking things through....on ocassion.  Zoro the swordsman.. Usopp the sharp shooter, Nami the navigator,  Sanji  the cook ,  Chopper the doctor  plus three more that will introduce themselves later in the series(if your smart enough to  drink the delicious kool aide that is onepiece),round out his pirate crew",1349568000,,740,4.564885496183206
4485932,5,B004W75BQU,"Ok for those who have their bad opinions about this show and never seen it, Well I admit this show does look a lil wack and their are times wen this show drags on even I have to fast forward sometimes, But never judge a book by its cover. This show has probably the most powerful storys out of all the animes (well not all) and the action is nothing less than epic. Yu can always tell when a show is good when you can feel the emotion and ambition in the characters in the show, and One Piece is a perfect example. The later episodes is when it gets really good but you will have to bear with the talking more than any other anime with this one. But this is a great show. I would definitely say its in the top 3 animes.",1347753600,,719,3.9655172413793105

4485934,5,B004W75BQU,"One piece collection 1 is a 4 disc set that includes 26 episodes. The packaging has reused art but a new sleek design. The discs are very practical and say what episodes are on it with Text that says one piece episodes ?-?. The overall set design is very well made and the new disc art makes it very easy to find a certain episode . The collections are rereleases of the voyage DVD sets. the voyages were expensive, they were sold at 50 bucks only offering 11-13 episodes. The first collection rereleases season 1 voyages 1 and 2. I suggest buying the first 2 collections which is all of the season 1 voyages with a total of 53 episodes. One piece is colorful and for a shonen anime its original. The pacing in one piece is good. in the first 53 episodes you go through around 5 arcs and those 5 arcs make the first saga. Unlike naruto or bleach which have 3 arcs at most in each saga that make over 60 episodes. One pieces fights are full of life. This anime will hook you. A must see for all anime fans.",1343347200,6,1005,4.185567010309279

comparing to this re-dub,uncut it's amazing I only saw few episodes airing on toonami when I was younger I take a look back at it now One piece is really great.

These aren't even as expensive as most anime DVDs are, which contain between 12 to 24 episodes at $30 or $40 each, so it was well worth the money spent!  As for the series itself, I was a really huge fan of the 4Kids dub when I was in middle school, so I was somewhat hesitant to try the Funimation dub, but after a handful of episodes, I quickly got used to the voice actors, and felt they fit very well as it went on.  In comparison to the original Japanese voices, I'd say this dub is far closer to the original voices than 4Kids was, and lives up to the original unedited series well.  I look forward to watching the rest of the series and highly recommend giving this one a shot!",1339372800,5,769,4.210884353741497

4485945,5,B004W75BQU,"For the longest time, the only option for watching One Piece was that wretched dub by 4Kids. Now, Funimation has the series and is doing a bang-up job with it. This 26-episode set contains the first half of the first season, and covers the following story arcs:
Episodes 1-8: Romance Dawn Arc
Episodes 9-17: Black Cat Pirates Arc
Episodes 18 and 19: One filler episode, and one character development episode containing Zoro's backstory.
Episodes 20-26: First 7 parts of Baratie Arc, continues on next set.
These episodes are a boon for sound and picture quality. The orchestral music sounds wonderful on my television, and the animation is fluid and colorful. It also includes the Japanese subtitled version for those who want it.
I received this One Piece DVD collection for Christmas, and am very pleased with it. It makes a wonderful gift for anime fans everywhere. Check it out!",1325203200,,882,4.926174496644295
4485946,5,B004W75BQU,"One Piece collection 1 from funimation contains the first 26 episodes and is fantastic. The english dub is well done, with Colleen Clinkenbeard providing the voice of Monkey D.

The episodes contain Luffy's encounters with Captain Alvida of the Alvida pirates,Buggy the Clown and the Buggy Pirates (Carnies), Captain Kuro and the Black Cat Pirates as well as the beginning of the Don Krieg arc. Not only are these episodes a blast but go from being overly serious to overly funny in a split second.

He doesn't kill people, just beats them senseless. He spends his time defeating bad guys, crooked police and politicians. His body has the power to stretch like rubber. Unfortunately his brain seems to be made of rubber too. Why he calls himself a pirate instead of the more accurate adventurer is anyone's guess.

4485950,5,B004W75BQU,"I've been seeing references to One Piece for years, so I got this mainly so I'd be able to appear competent in the next conversation where it turned up.

The show was much better than I expected.

For starters, the show is serialized, with many of the stories stretching out over several episodes. Next, the characterizations have a lot of life and quirkiness to the. Some have stereotypical aspects, with swordsman Roronoa Zoro as a strong hero type, Nami as a clever thief, and chef Sanji as a womanizer.  But all have other aspects to their character, and the show devotes plenty of time to good character building.

I particularly liked the story of Usopp the liar.  His story starts in a ""Boy Who Cried Wolf"" fashion, with him screaming to villagers that pirates were about to attack.  He's known as the village liar.  His stories help to cheer up the girl Kaya, who has lost her parents.  In the course of the 9 episode story, he's put into a deep ""Cried Wolf"" tragedy, where he knows the full horrible plot that is about to take place, but no-one will believe him.  This story has the longest fight scene I've ever seen.

There are plenty of comic aspects as well, such as Zoro's three-blades fighting style.  Plenty of quirkiness, rather good stories, and excellent characterizations.  No wonder so many people have mentioned it to me.

There is a strong ""just one more"" feeling while watching these episodes.  Recommended.",1318118400,31,1431,4.717741935483871
4485951,5,B004W75BQU,"I've been a fan of One Piece since I first read it in Shonen Jump. When Funimation got the license I was thrilled, but the DVD sets they first released were so lackluster and expensive. I'm just glad I watched to newest volume at a friends house when he bought them. But, then I saw this set at this price I grab it like Luffy grabs food at any chance.

It is slow and doesnt get too good until they fight Don Krieg, butyou'll be happy you bought this because its the starting point of a grand adventure.

With that said I have two small complaints...

1.) The voice for the intro for the 4kids version is better, this version I don't care for.

2.) The rap was hilarious and wicked cool in the 4kids version. Why they put this ""come aboard and bring along all your hopes and dreams"" version in instead is beyond me.

I'm up to episode 135 on Hulu's streaming site. I *at first* didn't want to buy the series on DVD. What with the whole ""13 episodes for 35 bucks"" thing. That's just not worth the price, at all. Only when FUNimation announced they would be re-releasing the series in a ""Collection"" format is when I decided to take the jump. This is a great way to start your adventure into One Piece, it's a fantastic deal. I dunno what else to say, really. Just that every new One Piece fan needs to buy these DVD sets. I say ""new"" because most One Piece fans started their collection through the old 13-episode sets. :P

I'm somewhat wary of dubs usually, but one episode of the dub and I was hooked! This also includes a seamless Marathon viewing feature, which removes the OPs, EDs, and Previews we're all so used to skipping over.

To those complaining about how this is not Blu-ray, on my new 50 inch plasma, the quality is very sharp and I'm not yet so lazy that I can't get up once every few hours to switch discs.
