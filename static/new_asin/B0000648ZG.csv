1706995,4,B0000648ZG,"Ripping friends is great but with the only 4 episodes I would have to give it 4 stars. Last week I saw a DVD with all 13 episodes and bought it, but Im not sure whether you can get it in the USA.  Worth looking out for though.",1102896000,4,226,3.7083333333333335
1706996,5,B0000648ZG,"JOHN K AND SPUMCO DELIVER THE GOODS ONCE AGAIN!  BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT'S A DAMN SHAME THAT THEY JUST CAN'T CATCH A MUCH NEEDED BREAK INTO MAINSTREAM TELEVISION. HELL, THEY AREN'T EVEN ON ADULT SWIM! AND WHY IS THIS?! SPUMCO (ESPECIALLY JOHN K IN PARTICULAR) HAS NEVER BEEN THE ANIMATION HOUSE THAT PLAYED BY THE RULES (SEE REN AND STIMPY DEBACLE). AND I GUESS WE CAN THANK GOD FOR THAT. FOR IF THEY DID THEY'D BE A LOT LESS MEMORABLE AND MORE OF THE SAME BLAND UNIMAGINATIVE TOONS THAT HAVE COME AND GONE AND COME AGAIN.
WITH THAT BEING SAID I HAVE TO PRAISE JOHN K'S SOPHOMORE EFFORT INTO TV. IT DELIVERS ALL THE CLASSIC SPUMCO HUMOR ALTHOUGH JUST A LITTLE SOFTENED BUT NOT ENOUGH TO WHINE ABOUT (AND THAT'S TO YOU ALL YOU BLOWHARD TOON CRITICS!). THE FIRST EPISODE ""THE INDIGESTIBLE WAD"" IS MASTERFUL AND I COULDN'T HELP BUT LAUGH NEARLY UNCONTROLLABLY. THE ANIMATION IS AS SMOOTH AS IT COULD BE WITH THE TRADEMARK PANS THAT SPUMCO HAS BEEN KNOWN FOR.
HOWEVER THE EPISODE ANIMATION QUALITY DOES SLINK AS THE EPISODES GO ON. BY THE LAST ONE ""THE FRICTOR"" IT'S ALMOST WARNER BROS (NEW SCHOOL WB) QUALITY AND IT'S A TAD DISTRACTING. THE STORY LINES HOWEVER ARE STILL GREAT I JUST WISH THAT THEY KEPT UP WITH THE ""WAD"". ALL IN ALL A GREAT BUY AND A MUST HAVE FOR ANY TOON FAN. HOWEVER ONLY 4 EPISODES IS A CRIME ESPECIALLY SINCE THEIR ARE LIKE 10 OR SO MORE! STOP TORTURING US AND RELEASE THEM. WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF? MAKING MONEY???!!",1081468800,,1436,4.418867924528302
1706997,4,B0000648ZG,"It is one of the great injustices of popular culture that what is good is not always popular.  Only about 13 Ripping Friend episodes were made before Fox TV decided to program their entire Saturday morning lineup with generic, derivative, cross-marketed junk.  And alas, the Ripping Friends were no more.
What is it like?  The 3 Stooges meets the Justice League with lots of fart jokes.  It carries a lot of the vibe that went through the Ren and Stimpy cartoons (same creative team) gleefully and unabashedly revelling in excretion and odor based humor while poking fun at cultural and genre cliches.  What makes this stuff great is that it manages to do it in a genuinely entertaining and endearing way.  Kind of like when a toddler farts, says ""toot"", and laughs about it.

The DVD has the first 4 aired episodes, my only complaint would be that if this is the only DVD released I would've picked some other episodes.  Hopefully, more of the series will be released.

1706998,5,B0000648ZG,"the first time i saw ripping friends on tv i was in shock that they were even getting away with showing this stuff
and pretending it was a kid's show
fantastic
over the top
ridiculous
and all the weird sexual stuff
i hated ren and stimpy - much too slow and stonerish for me
but ripping friends is possibly one of the best things to ever hit the living room screen
i hope we get more",1023148800,2,383,4.052631578947368

1707000,4,B0000648ZG,"If you are a teenager, you probabley grew into a pre-teen with Ren and Stimpy. I was a pre-schooler at the time Ren and Stimpy was popular, and to this day I watch the Spumco episodes of it religiously.
Fast foward ten years.
The original creators of Ren and Stimpy, John Kricfalusi and Spumco, have decided to come back on TV with a sucessful show after the diasater relationship they had with Nickeldeon a decade ago. Now they are with Fox Kids, with The Ripping Friends. I saw most of the first season, and is it as good as any Spumco product they made from R&S to present?
Close.
The animation: Now this is my least favorite part of the show. It really feels flat and two dimentional, almost like a 60s Hanna Barbera show, but slightly cleaner. There are still some good drawings, and based on the budget and the fact that it's a Saturday Morning Cartoon (which normal have limited animation), it's still OK. But check out the designs and the storyboards by Jim Smith, they look excellent, as always. I just wish they'd hire some close-up animators from Ren and Stimpy. ***/*****
The plot: Intresting. According to Kricfalusi, it's supposed to be a spoof on manly men, any type of men before political correctness or the 70s. Their mission: to rip, or destroy anyone or thing that stands in the way of justice. ****/*****
The humor: Hilarious. A couple jokes are a little flat, but you'll forgive those jokes instantly when other jokes come in the line. Ren and Stimpy-ish, and politically satire-ish most of the time. I won't spoil any here. See for yourself. ****1/2/*****.
Bottom line: It's no Ren and Stimpy, and the animation needs a bit of clean-up, but watch it for the humor, and how unusual it is. ****/*****. I will review the DVD when I purchase it.",1020988800,,1764,4.603174603174603

7960745,4,B0000648ZG,"The same passion for silliness that made me love the Mr. Potato Head show, made me a fan of this unexpected Saturday morning oddity.  If you like silly and downright quirky humor, this delivers the goods!",1424736000,,204,4.666666666666667

7960747,4,B0000648ZG,"John K is back with his hilarious and raunchy humor and animation, this time with a super hero show!  It's got a lot of John K's creativity (who else would think to make a wad of chewed gum a villain with bite marks looking like abs) and funny, weird humor that's sure to make you feel weird while laughing!

If you haven't yet, check out the first ep on youtube if you can find it and judge for yourself if it's up your alley.",1413417600,,427,4.071428571428571
7960748,4,B0000648ZG,I wish there were more episodes on this DVD. This animation is fun to watch. They should release all of them.,1375401600,,109,4.238095238095238
7960749,3,B0000648ZG,"I was disappointed it was only 4 episods on the DVD, and only one of them was my favorite. The other favorites are not even on the DVD. I wish they had all 13 episodes to purshase. Loved the show when it was on the air.",1366243200,,219,3.782608695652174
7960750,5,B0000648ZG,"Anyone who is a huge fan of ""Ren and Stimpy"" will not be disappointed with this D.V.D.It contains more of John K's entertaining characters. If you like the style of ""Ren and Stimpy"" then you will find this D.V.d to your liking as it is more of the craziness that ""Ren and Stimpy"" fans have come to know and love.
Although these cartoons now date back to the 90's they are as fresh and entertaining as the day they were first aired on T.V,you will be watching them over and over again.",1363132800,,484,4.271739130434782
7960751,5,B0000648ZG,"Animation's bad-boy John Kricfalusi has done it again!  This show is an electrifying explosion of Kirk Douglas-esque muscle men in skimpy shorts,  unbelievably goofy villains,  surrealistic storytelling and a lot of gross-me-out-to-the-max body-function humor.  I loved it!
Wouldn't it be cool if ALL the shows in this series were available in a really neat-o boxed set, so that those of us who know what's good could buy them?",1229904000,,427,5.235294117647059
7960752,5,B0000648ZG,"This Item is great for children and adults alike.  If you are a fan of Ren and Stimpy this is a must own, my only disappointment is the fact that there is only four episodes on this disc.  The entire program only aired thirteen episodes, so they should really consider just releasing the entire season on DVD, until then this is wonderful.",1121817600,,339,4.451612903225806
7960753,3,B0000648ZG,"The Ripping Friends are a group of testosterone-poisoned, over-muscled brothers who fight bizarre villains in unconventional ways. In a genre as old and tired as Super-heros, it is a spark of fresh creativity. John K's sophomoric humor (butt shots, flatulence, veiled homoeroticism) comes out in full force. Some of the gags are borrowed from Ren and Stimpy, but there is a new feel to the show, where it pokes fun at the paternalistic attitude of shows like the Superfriends.

Still, I can't help feeling that John K is holding back. The brilliant moments of strangeness are spaced out with long moments of tedious plot set-up, clumsy timing, and boring cliches. It feels rushed, as if John's legendary production values were set aside to meet deadlines. This is not on the same level as Ren and Stimpy, which is probably why the show does not get aired nearly as often. Nevertheless, to the collector of strange animation, it is a requisite purchase.

Another disappointment is the fact that there are only 4 episodes in this DVD. I don't know why they could not include all 13 in a multi-disc set. Some of my favorite episodes, like ""Man Man"" were not included. I don't know if they will ever be available, which is a big bummer, because I would definitely buy them.",1106784000,4,1269,4.763636363636364
