8704720,5,B00U8RHBX4,A very subtle comedy but very funny if you pay attention. I am big fan of all things Irish so this is a series that I really enjoy. I hope there are more seasons to come.,1457568000,2,170,3.75
8704721,5,B00U8RHBX4,"Before purchasing this DVD, I had read reviews on how people could not play them on the DVD player. What they can do as I did, download VLC Media Player. Which by the way is free.  This media player can play many regions that a regular DVD player can not.  I have enjoyed watching Moone Boy. Love this series. If you want to watch on TV, you can hook up your computer to the TV, with a HDML cable.  Hope this helps other who want to purchase this DVD. Also other Comedies from the UK.",1455321600,2,484,4.073684210526316
