I loved the intimacy, the pace, the content and the mixture of feelings shared by Billy Joe. I wished that it was even longer than it was as I was sorry to see it end.",1367020800,,305,4.1

8028779,1,B0002L7276,"Billy Joe Shaver is indeed one of the best singer/songwriters alive today, if not the best. I have met the man and I have seen many of his live performances. This documentary did not capture any of the excitement or greatness of this man. This movie provided nothing of interest about a very intersting man. It dragged from start to finish and I kept waiting for something good to start until the final credits finally rolled. I can not put to words how disappointed I was in this failed attempt to paint a video portrait of a man that I hold in very high regards. When I think of portraits, I think of classic artists, so in contrast I would have to say that this portrait looks as though it was painted by a 4 year old with crayons. Do not waste your money, just go and watch Mr Billy Joe Shaver perform live!",1102896000,9,811,4.2727272727272725
8028780,5,B0002L7276,"I've become a fan of Billy Joe Shaver over the last couple of years.  This man has had such a hard life, and yet when he smiles, you know it comes right from the heart.  If you've heard Billy Joe's music, then this DVD is a must.  You really need to know what Billy Joe is singing about.  This man is so honest and humble.  Billy Joe lays it on the line for you - every time.  Our political leaders sure could learn a lot from Billy Joe Shaver.  I guess we all could.  Watch this DVD and you'll see what I mean.",1091404800,9,511,3.8932038834951457
