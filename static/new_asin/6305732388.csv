1064709,4,6305732388,I loved this movie! I found it far better than the second one and about equal to the excellence of the first. I liked Scott Cleverland as Pyriel in particular! Love them pretty boys!,956102400,2,182,4.382352941176471
1064710,2,6305732388,"This movie was not that bad, but it failed to keep up with the first two.  The battle between Pyriel and Danyael wasn't really much of an excitement.  The movie did not develop Pyriel's character properly. Prophecy II however  was very action-filled and you really get involved. That was the best!",955929600,,297,4.784313725490196
1064711,5,6305732388,"being a big fan of this tril, I can honestly say this is about a thousand times better then the second one, though I thought it was okay, this is more deserving of the name... well worth the buy",954806400,,194,4.0
1064712,5,6305732388,"ok, I got to say i was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  After the lame prophescy 2, i thought this franchise was over.  But they came back with a nice movie.  The best part of this is not knowing which side is the good  and which is the bad.  THey keep you guessing.  THe retrun of certain  charecters from the original is a nice touch.  IT is a worth seeing.  though i don't think you need to see it on dvd, vhs is fine.",954720000,,425,3.9642857142857144
1064713,4,6305732388,"I must say I was pleasantly surprised when I finished Propecy III. The story for the first time in the series was actually easy to follow. Walken was Great as Gabriel he always seems to approach these roles very tongue in  cheek, none more than this one. The picture and sound quality are both  adequate. Although to many previews for upcoming Dvd's and no extras will  keep me from buying it. I think some commentary from Walken would have been  a selling point.",953337600,,463,4.542168674698795
1064714,5,6305732388,"Christopher Walken has done it again. Gabriel has returned to the screen, and now we are introduced to a more human and amiable Angel of Death. The film itself is somewhat of a repeat of Prophecy I, but not annoyingly so.  Walken injects memorable humor into his role, and some of his lines are  hysterically unforgettable. This film proves that the third in a series  does not always mean certain death. I highly recommend!",953078400,,424,4.702702702702703
1064715,4,6305732388,"Unlike most films which carry the number 3 in it, The Prophecy III proves to be the most energetic and satisfying film in the trilogy. I can't say enough good things about it. The story while drawing from the previous  films still brings the story to a close with it's own ideas and new  directions for old characters. The best thing about Prophecy III is that it  never does what you'd expect. Christopher Walken returns to the story once  again as Gabriel the former angel of death now humble wandering human. The  filmmakers have taken great care in recreating Gabriel while still having  him be familiar too us. Still speaking in that menacing tone of his and  piercing us with those eyes that see more than what is there. The movie  somewhat mirrors T2. The villain is now the protector. Which I loved. The  story revolves around The half angel half human neraphim of Prophecy II who  is plagued by visions and compelled to stop the angel of genocide Pyriel.  Enter Zophael, an assasin angel sent to Earth to destroy the neraphim  Danyael. As before there are protectors. In this case it is the coroner  from the previous two films who is tired of examining bodies with no eyes,  the girlfriend who is taken hostage by Zophael as Gabriel had taken human  slaves in the previous films, and finally Gabriel himself who does not have  the lead role in this movie but shows up to deliver very compelling  dialogue and give great foreshadowing for things to come. The story is in  full drive for the whole movie. A surprising cameo in the end and a  somewhat recreation of a scene from The Prophecy will have you rolling if  you are a fan of the films. If the movie suffers from anything it is that  all three films are well..the same. An angel chasing after a human to  further the war in heaven. Human slaves are always taken by the angel in  order to defeat the human who is always helped by another human.  But  despite that, Prophecy III has the same darkness of the original and a  striking and subtle music score. This is not a film for first time Prophecy  viewers. Go through the first two and if you like them then The Prophecy  III will have you believing in The Word and that not all sequels to sequels  bite.",953078400,49,2221,4.468827930174563

1064848,3,6305732388,But still fun. The plot doesn't stand up to a hard stare but Walken is delightful as always.

1064849,1,6305732388,"Okay, I enjoyed the first one, and got through the second one but this one is just kicking a guy in the groin. Walken is reduced to a silly bum and hardly has any screen time. He was so wicked and charismatic in the first two. The plot, if you call a contrived story that, is about some new human that is supposed to fix everything up. The editing is bad, the story is confusing and not even worth our attention and people come and go like an all night bus stop. What was even stupidier that all that was the goth-inspired angel that is the bad guy in here. I was really trembling in my pants as I saw him, gheeze. He was some jerk in long hair with too much bad make-up. If they think about making a fourth one they might want to bother getting a decent director and writer.",1386633600,,775,4.071895424836601

1064852,2,6305732388,"We all grow accustomed to the gobbledygook which is a staple in certain kinds of film. It goes with the territory and regular viewers can just catch their breath, grab a snack or a drink, or do any of the accustomed time-killers, until the interlude has passed. Unfortunately, in this rag-tag offering nearly all of the film is time-filler, with the little remaining substance being vapid. Yes, that is correct, I did not like this movie, did not think it matches in clarity the very least of the Three Stooges efforts, and they were trying to act loony. However clear the Amazon lead-in makes the movie story-line appear, don't be mislead. It is really a sink-hole miles in diameter, with no ascertainable bottom.",1380499200,,714,4.813008130081301

Let's say that not all angels who go South will remain blinded forever. This is the third sequel of The Prophecy (in which he's in the first two). I like this movie, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes war movies or just likes to see the human race come almost to an end due to a war.",1370736000,,447,4.209302325581396
1064904,4,6305732388,"THE PROPHECY trilogy reaches its thrilling climax in THE PROPHECY 3: THE ASCENT! Danyael, the half-human son of an angel, has been chosen as mankind's only hope against the coming of the Second God, Pyriel, the Angel of Genocide. With his powers revoked, the arch-angel Gabriel is left to sit idly by and watch as the world dies... That is, unless he is able to help Danyael fulfill his destiny and stop the approaching apocalypse! THE PROPHECY 3 draws the characters and events from the first two films together for a fitting conclusion as Patrick Lussier ups the ante with more exciting action and gripping suspense. The grand scope of the picture is achieved on a much smaller scale, delivering all of the same terrifying imagery and dread at a fraction of the cost. Dave Buzzotta gives a strong performance as the lost prophet Danyael, who is struggling to find purpose after learning of his own immortality. Vincent Spano's overblown theatrics can be forgiven considering his role as the angelic assassin, Zophael, while Christopher Walken is far more reserved now that his wings have literally been clipped. The crowning moments are rightfully achieved in Danyael's final confrontation with the sinister Pyriel, as well as in the notable cameos made by the previous players in the series (Gabriel's stop at an all-too-familiar diner is particularly entertaining).

1064905,4,6305732388,"If you can get past the fact that Christopher Walken's character, Gabriel was killed when Lucifer removed his heart and ate it, in the first movie, but Gabriel is still doing his thing in this one, you will find this enjoyable, but not quite the equal of the first.  The reason is twofold.  First, the plot is neither as complex nor as interesting as the first, being simply of ""A"" has to get to a certain place to win over ""B"" or bad things will happen. and second, this movie was done on an embarrassingly low budget.  Fortunately, this movie does not refer to anything that happened in the second movie, so there is no need to see that before this one.",1357862400,,655,4.352459016393443

1064909,3,6305732388,"I will agree with many reviews that this is the bad movie of the trilogy. I give it 2-3 stars for the one saving grace that is Christopher Walken. As the movie begins, we see that he has lost his grace (Punished) and is now human. He has to learn the things that normal people take for granted and is a bum. As his character, who is now acting as a good guy after learning the error of his ways, is a supporting role, by the end you are rooting for Gabriel.
Ok, the bad. This was an aweful story, with aweful acting and why are the angels trying to be goth?! Someone said, Vincent Spano looked more like he needed some mousse and a hair dryer. I had to agree. He was not intimidating and not believable at all.
The ultimate evil angel that is also being reborn (Pyriel) is a goth wannabe but in white. I agree with other reviewers that ""What was he waiting for? He was waiting for the one guy to come to his grave to be reborn?"" A fight occurs between Pyriel and the hero with a spear that the hero has taken from Vincent Spanno's character that is so unbelievably awefully designed, I just laughed every time I saw it used.
If you are going to watch the trilogy, watch 1 and 2 and if you are bored and want to waste some time and finally see what the final outcome for Gabriel is, rent this. I say it's worth it to see what happens to Gabriel in the end.",1286323200,,1355,4.078651685393258

The actor who plays Danyael is a bit wooden--and short ;->--as noted by the Native American psychic Mary, whom we met in Prophecy I. Lots of heart removals without anesthesia. A lesson to you: ""ALWAYS remove the heart!"" if you're dealing with a hostile angel, or he'll come back like The Terminator.

I've seen all of them except the second one, but this one is incoherent and muddled and Dave Buggatto's performance as Danyael is really bad.  It's hard to tell the good angels from the bad angels, and even Christopher Walken seems bored with it all, as he must have been since he didn't show up for four and five.  Obviously trying to lure in THE MATRIX audience, the movie features too many acrobatic battles and chases, and the ending is a real copout.  Brad Dourif has a cameo as what else?  a looney zealot.

1064980,3,6305732388,"And so after three movies the 'Second War in Heaven' saga finally comes to a conclusion. Thank God! [get it, thank God]. It appears that the amazingly original concept and dark, cutting edge humor that generated the masterpiece 'The Prophecy' and an admirable follow-up in 'The Prophecy II' eventually ran out of ideas and what little was left became the disappointing 'Prophecy 3.'

The once formidable fallen Archangel Gabriel (Christopher Walken) introduced in the first feature film, the one with a gaze so terrifying your heart stopped everytime he appeared on screen, wasn't even a shadow of his former self by the third film. Now lowered to the status of mere mortal poor Gabriel seems to have lost not only his angelic powers, but his once sharp wit and laserlike tongue as well. His remarks are now trite, whimsical and all but senile in nature. My how the mighty have fallen.

Unfortunately the storyline doesn't fair much better. What began as a potentially good film simply failed to deliver the apocalytic climax promised. The offspring of the mortal woman and angel from 'The Prophecy II' is now grown. His name is Danyael (Dave Buzzotta) and he is a Nephilim, part angel and part human, chosen by God to bring an end to the rebellion. The time of the end is drawing near and Pyriel, the Angel of Genocide is coming to destroy the human race. As you probably already guessed by now the task of facing and defeating Pyriel has fallen to Danyael.

Positives: Even though this isn't Walken at his best he still makes it worth watching. The special effects surrounding the coming of Pyriel are rather well done and Danyael's girlfriend Maggie (Kayren Ann Butler) is quite attractive.

If you're a fan of 'The Prophecy' and a complusive completist as I am I guess you'll have to buy the DVD.",1130716800,,1800,4.759615384615385

1065046,4,6305732388,"After the ""The Prophecy 2"" there was a 3 year gap before the release of what at the time was going to be the final movie in the 'Prophecy' series, to serve as a bookend for a trilogy.  However, in 2005 'The Prophecy' series returned, but that's for another time and another review.

""The Prophecy 3: The Ascent"" picks up around 16-18 years after the events of ""The Prophecy 2"".  A new dark angel named Pyriel, not satisfied with simply blocking humans from entering into Heaven decides to attempt to eradicate all humans.  To do this he has sent one of his followers to kill the Nephilim(a child born of a human and an angel), named Danyael.  Danyael is not aware of his destiny to be mankind's salvation from annihilation and opening up the gates of Heaven, and is gunned down before he can fully realize his potential.  However, Danyael is no mere mortal, as his self-appointed secret bodyguard, the fallen angel Gabriel (Christopher Walken) had figured out years ago when he attempted to kill him before he was out of the womb.  Gabriel, who is now human after the events of ""The Prophecy 2"", discovers that Danyael has been resurrected and takes it upon himself to guide the boy in embracing his destiny to fight Pyriel and save humanity.

This 3rd installment in the franchise was a great sequel and at the time a very satisfying ending to 'The Prophecy' saga.  It brought everything full circle, and was a great story of destiny and repentance.  Great fight sequences, the best in the series to date.  Top-notch acting and writing, rarities in direct-to-DVD releases, made this series the best religious/sci-fi thrillers ever made.  The entire series is a must see.

""The Prophecy 3: The Ascent"" is rated R for violence, language, and brief nudity.",1118966400,5,1754,4.730263157894737

Rosales' mother Valerie died many a year ago in a fire accident. Danyael is half angel, half human, a Nephilim,  so he's sort of like for example Angel's son Connor in the Tv Show Angel, Sanyael has human and angel qualitites. Danyael's task is to defeat Pyriel and stop the war. It's another sequel but this is a two notches better then the second one. Walken has never been more funnier, Dourif is in another wasted role and Steve Hytner, who plays yet again the doctor Joseph is still the same.

1065051,5,6305732388,"I'm speaking of the 3 movies I've seen in this series of movies, Christopher Walken is one of the best actors I have seen and this roll is his apex in my mind, totally funny + he gets weirder as the movies go along, the writers know what they are doing + christopher playes it perfectly + adds his amazing performance in a perfect roll for him. Top Rate!",1081296000,4,354,4.144927536231884
1065052,1,6305732388,"After having seen Prophecy II I was greatly disappointed by this, the worst installment of the series and probably one of the worst films we have ever seen.  Looks like it was done with no artistic interest just to make a buck from direct to video release.  Where Walken was great in the other Prophecy films, here he camps it up completely to take home a paycheck. The lead character who is Eurasian in the first film, as he should be as the child of Russell Wong and Jennifer Beals, is now white.  Beals' character is killed off in the prologue in ridiculous fashion (A lookalike for Beals is substituted in this scene--I don't blame her or Eric Roberts for not returning to this piece of garbage).  The acting is horrendous, particularly by the lead and his girlfriend, both of whom look like they are preening in a TV commercial for toothpaste. No chemistry at all!
Many of the scenes and images in the film are derived from or repeated exactly from its earlier predecessors.  Boring scenes of driving around for long periods of time are not suspenseful.  The dreaded villain, whose idea of threatening is pouting in makeup like a Eurotrash glam rocker and mincing like a dance instructor,is slain easily in anticlimactic fashion.  The other villain is a one-dimensional pretty-boy photocopy of Christopher Walken's villain from Prophecy II (who incidentally rehashes the same lines and scenes).
I recommend that you buy this DVD only to use it as a drink coaster.",1004486400,5,1468,4.778656126482214
1065053,5,6305732388,"I only rented this movie because I was feeling bored but as it
turned out, it was a very good movie after all. The story line is original and already familiar caracters from the first two episodes show up as well with rather surprisingly twists. I enjoyed the first two very much but I have to say that number three was so far far the best one yet. I made me hopeful that they will actually produce a part four since there were many questions left unsanswered. I can only recommend this movie to anyone who loves this genre.",999561600,,524,4.303030303030303
1065054,3,6305732388,"While not coming to nearly the heights of the first Prophesy, it does advance the story in an interesting fashion.  We join the adult child of Jennifer Beil's character from the second film Danyael as he is about 18.  He is being hunted by one angel and followed by the human Gabriel.  Gabriel has seemed to softened on his stance towards the human race, now opposing the angels with which he once stood.  His time on earth has seemed to allow him to recognize his place with God and man.  Walken has made his [resence more humorous in this third installment and less menacing.  But it's still a solid Walken performance.  The film seems bring everything to a close, revealing the mastermind behind the war in heaven.  And it is Danyael's job to confront him.  Brad Dourif is briefly in the film as one of his off kilter characters.  Over all, it's an interesting end to the storyline and it brings closure to the various characters we have been introduced to.  Not as high quality as the first, but a decent closer.",990230400,6,1016,4.527472527472527
1065055,4,6305732388,"This movie was beutiful and had some truly great innovations to the Prophecy storyline-Gabriel and his ""enlightment"" after living the life of a human for so many years being the most fun of them. The cameos  from the first film are delightful as well. The Star does an adequate job  as a cerebral action hero but Zophiel was a Termintor 2 warrior and one I  wish had got more airtime.  Pyriel in his brief appearence was wonderful  and truly chilling. However I never felt I got a good hand on the celestial  mechanics involved in this story. Is God still hanging around, why did  Danyael feel the way he did at the beggining, is the dang Second war in  Heaven over yet? Basically we need a few more films here...hopefully one  that will end the War in Heaven, explain Danyael, and maybe bring peace on  earth. Ultimately this sense of unfufillment is waylaid by the usual good  lines, philosophy, and special effects of the films.",960249600,5,931,4.581818181818182
