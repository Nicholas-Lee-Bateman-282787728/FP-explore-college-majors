5755374,5,B00CYQXFP0,I loved  unforgettable 1st season and was glad it came back for 2nd season summer replacement hope it comes back this fall,1376697600,,122,4.545454545454546
5755375,5,B00CYQXFP0,This is a really good and interesting program to watch. Poppy isn't hard to look at either. Watch it Sunday night.,1376697600,,114,4.476190476190476
5755376,5,B00CYQXFP0,I love Carrie and Al together and the cases they work on are not boring like some of the crime shows.  It keeps me interested  in the outcome.,1376438400,7,142,4.035714285714286
5755377,5,B00CYQXFP0,"I watched all of season 1 on cbs.com before the blackout. I loved it! Couldn't wait for Season 2. Have always liked Poppy Montgomery and I love the depth of Carrie's character. Also that her and Al's relationship, personal & professional, goes back so far. In light of the differences between S-1 & S-2, I'm really liking S-2. There are things I miss from S-1, but also things I really like about S-2! It's natural for people to dismiss change, so I think/worry that some will automatically dismiss this new season. If you enjoyed season 1 and are on the fence about season 2, give it some time to play out before making judgment. Remember we're only in the 3rd episode. And, personally I think they've got some great story lines to work with yet! I say thumbs up to season 2!! **Also, love Jane Curtain's role!",1376265600,11,811,4.523809523809524
5755378,4,B00CYQXFP0,"I love Poppy Montgomery and generally, I love this show.  It's just that the first two episodes of this season were disappointing.  What's missing?  I think there's just not enough tension -- between the main characters, and within the lead character.  At least, so far.  The stories weren't able to carry me, because in any really good show, it's character driven IMHO.  So I do hope there's a change soon, since it's hard enough to watch this show -- with the TWC-CBS problems.",1376006400,,479,4.710843373493976
5755379,5,B00CYQXFP0,I enjoy this program and the interplay between Carrie and the rest of the cast.  I am so glad CBS brought it back but miffed at them for this horrible fight they are having with Time-Warner.,1376006400,5,190,4.277777777777778
5755380,5,B00CYQXFP0,"The new episodes are much more interesting then when it first came on tv. I found the old episodes very boring.
I am enjoying season 2 very much and look forward to seeing the next one.",1376006400,,185,4.166666666666667
5755381,5,B00CYQXFP0,"Love the show, would love to be notified when new episodes are available, BUT NOOOOOOOOOOOO. Amazon support just gives the standard whining about how they have different agreements with different content providers. Season pass was available on Season 1, but not Season 2. COME ON PEOPLE, I WANT TO PAY YOU MONEY! What a pile of horse droppings.

Yes, I know this is not the place for this, but I can't seem to get their attention via ""proper"" channels. Maybe this will do it. I will buy it when I can get a season pass, and not until then.

[Well, what do you know! Season pass is now available, so I purchased it. THANK YOU AMAZON, finally! OK, so maybe I was a bit impatient...]",1375747200,,680,4.432
5755382,5,B00CYQXFP0,This show holds my interest and I always am entertained. I like Jane Curtin also She has a very different character for a medical examinter,1375660800,2,139,4.6
5755383,5,B00CYQXFP0,"I liked the first season of this show, although at times the characters were not that endearing.  But with this new season, and what - two years later?  - it is actually better.  The chemistry is better between all of the characters, major and minor, and so I have my hopes up that it will now be a success.",1375660800,2,307,4.169491525423729

5755569,5,B00CYQXFP0,YEAH !  LOVE CARRIE WELLS...,1449705600,,28,4.6
5755570,5,B00CYQXFP0,"The second season was a bit of a surprise to me because it changed locales, and most of its personnel, from Brooklyn's police force to a special investigatory force in Manhattan. I miss a few of the characters from the first season. Still, with Carrie's special memory, it's understandable that she, and her partner Al, would move up the ladder.

The episodes provide plenty of action, on a larger scale than just ""murder of the week,"" which is to be expected with the ""special investigations"" focus of Carrie and Al.

I have finished Season 3 as well, and enjoyed it. I'm glad to hear that Season 4 will be starting on A&E at the end of November.",1447632000,2,647,4.521367521367521
5755571,5,B00CYQXFP0,Another great season. Big changes is our pair of dectectives are recruited to the major crimes squad of Manhattan from the their more subdued origins in one of the lesser burrows so to speak. More high profile work for them.,1444262400,,224,4.625

5755723,5,B00CYQXFP0,"I love this show, it has quirky actors that play their characters so believably, especially Poppy Montgomery who plays Kerrie with hypermnesia - remembers everything she has ever seen! She gives her character real attitude - ""Don't  try to tell me what to do as I'll do what I think is right!"" and she usually is - right that is! I really like the way her hypermnesia is displayed by replaying what she saw (and you saw) previously as she reruns what she saw, but with her current time self following her remembered self through what was seen, but the details now having a new meaning - Brilliant!",1423008000,,597,4.527777777777778

5755726,3,B00CYQXFP0,I loved the first season but this one seemed unfinished I was still good but they didn't capitalise on the relationship they seemed like they got together in last episode last season but they didn't really mention it again. It looked like they were trying to hide Poppy's belly so I'm guessing she is pregnant maybe that's y the season was short I don't know. I still plan to watch next season hopefully it will get better,1421280000,,422,4.4935064935064934

5755967,3,B00CYQXFP0,"What can we say about the cop team here....hmm, well at the beginning of the season it does show why a member of season 1 is not in it anymore; so a new Asian guy that replaced that geeky nerdy looking guy of season 1 seems to have been a good choice for season II. They move into another city with a whole lot of technology in all of their offices so that is cool. Yet the season could have had more episodes in it.",1407974400,,416,3.9058823529411764

5756044,5,B00CYQXFP0,Wish it was on for a 23 show season rather then the short 13 week season. It would draw the viewers during the winter.,1403136000,,118,3.9583333333333335
5756045,5,B00CYQXFP0,So real and exciting. this show will always makes you think. theres always a new turn or twist and its not always the same story line every episode absolutely amazing :),1402790400,,169,4.483870967741935
5756046,1,B00CYQXFP0,I couldn't get through the first episode. Partly too nakedly real (I think I've known one or two of these.) and partly to goofy to believe. I don't know where this series is going but it doesn't look good. Maybe the series is a spoof on what enlightenment is but the result is hurt not humor.,1402617600,,292,4.232142857142857
5756047,4,B00CYQXFP0,This is totally different from season one and without Carrie Al could never solve the crime as he continues to show himself like a key stone cop.  Jane curtain is great in this and she should be Carrie's partner in crime.,1402185600,,221,4.390243902439025
5756048,5,B00CYQXFP0,The story line is fun to follow and helps one to think about how one could be more observant and how to think about storing what is in the memory. The characters work well together.,1402099200,,181,4.2

5756050,5,B00CYQXFP0,I always love drama's and this one is very entertaining. The second season was good a slight change in the cast from a basic detectives in a precinct to a select group in a major crimes unit. It is based in NYC and they all work very well together. I like this part of a police drama better the team seems to have no hidden agenda or someone behind the scenes working to plague the entire unit or undermine the rest of the team. As I said the show is very good a slight change from last year but well worth watching.,1400630400,,516,4.068627450980392
5756051,5,B00CYQXFP0,"Not as many episodes as Season 1, but the network broke up Season 2.  Season 1 had 22 episodes.  Wish it was a better value, but I enjoy the show.",1400112000,6,146,3.8333333333333335

5756092,4,B00CYQXFP0,"This is one of the few shows that provides what I watch TV for: Entertainment.  It manages to balance personal relationships without overshadowing the fact that it is a cop show that solves crimes.  I especially like the relationship between Carrie and Jo (Jane Curtin was a brilliant choice for this role).  And they even when Jo is making her ""snippy"" and usually ""dead on"" comments, you sense a depth and growth of respect among the team.",1400112000,,441,4.701298701298701
5756093,5,B00CYQXFP0,I can not believe I've just found this little treasure trove of entertainment.  The relationship between the two main characters is refreshing and the wife isn't a size 0.  Color me impressed.  Fantastic show!,1399161600,,209,5.088235294117647

5756098,5,B00CYQXFP0,I really enjoy this show.  The premise is interesting and the stories hold my interest.  I really like Poppi Montgomery and the energy she brings to the cast.  The new supporting cast creates a better ensemble than the one during the first year.  Very enjoyable.,1397001600,2,262,4.7555555555555555

5756115,4,B00CYQXFP0,"It would be nice to have increased memory but to remember everything, I think not. Poppy does an excellent job in portraying Carrie Wells. I can understand to some degree as to why they changed their local from Queens to Major Crimes. It allows the writes to open up the area in which they can work. However, the cast of Season 1 was excellent and I took a positive interest in their stories. I would like to see them worked into Season 3, if there is a Season 3. The primary players in Season 2 are also a good group but there has not been sufficient epos ides to really get to know them. I would recommend seeing the first episode and believe the percentage is high that you will become a permanent viewer.",1388361600,,708,4.291044776119403

5756120,5,B00CYQXFP0,I love Carrie and how human and unassuming she is. She just does what she does without expecting accolades for it or looking down at others without her ability.,1383782400,,160,4.551724137931035
5756121,5,B00CYQXFP0,This is the best TV show for our entertainment.  Poppy (lead character) is darling and other cast are great as well. I love the romantic dance Poppy and her Boss (a past boyfriend) have and the underlying search for who killed Poppy's sister keeps it interesting.,1383696000,3,263,4.717391304347826

5756126,5,B00CYQXFP0,"Unforgettable is my favorite show.  Carrie's memory abilities are fascinating to me on an intellectual level, I enjoy crime solving shows anyway, and it's a show I can show to my children.  All plusses in my book.  I will say that I liked season 1 better than season 2, simply because I found season 1 to be believable and sometimes I question things about season 2.  For example, sometimes Carrie's boss lets something she's done slide when she probably would get in trouble for her action in real life.  However that doesn't dampen my enthusiasm for the show.",1382227200,4,561,4.683673469387755

5756215,3,B00CYQXFP0,I do like the show.....just not as much as the first season. I miss the other characters that aren't in this season. The stories are still good and the new characters are ok.......just not as good as the ones that were cut from the show after last year,1378425600,,252,4.270833333333333
5756216,5,B00CYQXFP0,Carrie and Al are an unusual mix and work so well together in the excellent series.  This is one of the few TV series that I do not want to miss! The series does not center in on the violence and gruesomeness but rather on the solving of the cases - this makes it much more interesting and pleasurable to watch. I highly recommend you watch Unforgettable: you will probably be hooked after just one episode!,1378425600,4,407,4.355263157894737
5756217,3,B00CYQXFP0,It just seems to be the same old thing and the story lines are a little boring compared to last season.,1378252800,,103,3.9523809523809526
5756218,5,B00CYQXFP0,Unforgettable is a very good show- I've watched it from the beginning. As with all shows I record it on TiVo and watch it at my convenience. For some reason CBS aired the episode 10 minutes late so I missed the end and because of the head butting between Time Warner And CBS I couldn't watch it online (I don't even have Time Warner) so I had to buy it for $2.99. That was bad enough but the download was corrupted and wouldn't play the last few minutes. I eventually caught the end online but was scared i'd get charged $2.99 again (I didn't- whew!). So again a good show but amazon downloads- not so much.,1378252800,,607,4.241379310344827

5756252,4,B00CYQXFP0,"Just another take on a good detective show with people much too good looking to be real, but isn't that what Hollywood is all about?

I think she has one of the best smiles in all of Hollywood.",1377648000,3,308,4.4035087719298245
5756253,4,B00CYQXFP0,Video was HD quality.  Audio was clear.  There were no delays due to buffer reloading.  This should have been FREE as an Amazon Instant Video member but cost me $2.99.,1377648000,,167,4.5

Personally the only thing that I would like to see is Carrie and Al back together.  I love all the back and forth with them but at some point it would be nice to just see them together and happy!  I don't think the show would lose any of it's viewers if they got them together in fact I think a lot would likely be happy they were finally together.  Anyhow aside from that I think this show is a great police drama and will be sad if it doesn't make a season 3 cut!!,1377475200,,644,3.840909090909091

5756260,5,B00CYQXFP0,"Time Warner and CBS want to battle let them - I work alot and need my DVR / On Demand if they can't play nice - their loss - I tried Amazon video great idea it was cheep, clear and with just a little help - I got it done  - loving it - I ordered the whole season in one sweep for $1.89 per show - no commercials, i can pause, go forward or restart -",1376956800,2,349,3.5324675324675323
5756261,4,B00CYQXFP0,"The concept is cool:  what if you could remember everything, every last detail, of where you have been and what you have experienced?  I imagine a brain as train wreck but this detective uses her skill to see what others cannot coming closer and faster to a solution to whatever crime is being investigated.  I liked the program better when it was not in NYC - too many Law and Order vibes coming from that place - and, really, does television need another crime show in the City?  Syracuse provided a different twist and seemed more personal.  Anyway, I find the main character a bit stiff in her performance with the real time ""overlays"" examining the crime scenes a bit corny.  I continue to watch because of the concepts and not the performances with the male partner seemingly so restrained as to be without any attraction to Poppy's character at all and then, Boom, he is all over her.  It makes no sense - it feels like they are still negotiating what they are to each other at a frustrating level of reticence.",1376956800,,1018,4.530054644808743
