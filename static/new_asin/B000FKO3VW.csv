2570044,3,B000FKO3VW,"""Vicki"" is the second film adaptation of Steve Fisher's novel ""I Wake Up Screaming"". The first was an A-list film made 12 years earlier, released in 1942, that retained the novel's title. 1942's ""I Wake Up Screaming"" starred Victor Mature as Vicki's publicity man Frankie Christopher and featured Betty Grable in her first non-musical role as Jil Lynn. 1953's ""Vicki"" is a moderately budgeted affair without high-power stars. It is perhaps marginally film noir but bland overall. ""Vicki"" has a more extensive flashback structure than the 1942 film, which awkwardly overloads the first part of the film. That is not from the book, and Dwight Taylor is credited as screenwriter on both movies. ""Vicki"" seems to have been adapted from the earlier film rather than from Fisher's novel.

When famous model Vicki Lynn (Jean Peters) is found murdered in her New York apartment, gruff police detective Ed Cornell (Richard Boone) insists on taking the case. Miss Lynn left a string of admirers and sponsors high and dry when she decided to try her luck in Hollywood, so there is no shortage of suspects: Her jilted boyfriend, actor Robin Ray (Alex D'Arcy). Society columnist Larry Evans (Casey Adams), who made her the toast of the town. And publicity man Steve Christopher (Elliot Reid), who engineered Vicki's rapid rise to the darling of caf society. But detective Cornell decides that Christopher is the guilty party and obsessively harasses the man, even badgering Vicki's sympathetic sister Jill (Jeanne Craine), who doubts Christopher's guilt.

""Vicki"" is not a bad film, but it suffers by comparison to its predecessor. It lacks the stars' charisma of ""I Wake Up Screaming"" as well that film's menacing tone and psychosexual subtext. The villain, Ed Cornell, is more pathetic in ""Vicki"" than in ""I Wake Up Screaming"". Perhaps that is more realistic, but the character doesn't inspire the fear that Laird Cregar's chilling interpretation did in 1942. Still, Richard Boone's performance is the best in the film. But this isn't the ideal context for an aging, obsessed, pathetic loser cop. Cornell often refers to Christopher as ""pretty boy"", which is puzzling given Elliot Reid's hum-drum appearance. Christopher is a slick publicity man. He should at least be a sharp dresser. Elliot Reid's performance is as benign as his wardrobe. Harry Horner was probably the wrong director for this material.

Themes and characters are watered down in ""Vicki"". But comparing the women in 1942's ""I Wake Up Screaming"" and 1953's ""Vicki"" gets interesting. In ""I Wake Up Screaming"", Vicki is the older, worldly sister. She's selfish and ambitious, but sharp. Jill is younger, wholesome, and more cautious. But she's no shrinking violet. Both women know their own minds and neither is easily intimidated. In ""Vicki"", Jill is the older, wiser, very maternal sister. Vicki is young, ambitious, impetuous, but also shallow and naive. ""I Wake Up Screaming"" reflects the feminine ideal of the 1940s: smart, utilitarian, and confident. Jill is a helper-heroine whom Christopher needs to regain control of his life. ""Vicki"" reflects the post-war ideal of women: Young and silly or older and maternal but, either way, frightened and driven by emotions. Jill is a love interest in ""Vicki"", not a partner.

The DVD (20th Century Fox 2006): Bonus features include a theatrical trailer (2 min), Still Galleries, and an audio commentary by film noir historian and author Foster Hirsch. The 3 Stills Galleries are: Advertising (12 b&w images), Behind-the-Scenes (10 b&w photos), and a 16-page Interactive Pressbook. You can zoom in on pictures or articles to read them. In his audio commentary, Foster Hirsch discusses the actors, the contrast between flat lighting and low-key ""noir"" lighting (what little there is of it) in the film, and takes us through the story. Hirsch also critiques ""Vicki"" in comparison to 1942's ""I Wake Up Screaming"". He doesn't hold ""Vicki"" in very high esteem, for some of the same and some different reasons that I don't. Subtitles for the film are available in English and Spanish.",1161561600,24,4080,5.1308270676691725
2570045,3,B000FKO3VW,"In a nutshell, this remake of ""I Wake Up Screaming"" doesn't work whether you saw the original or this is your first time exposed to the story.  The film is saddled with a blah cast and uninspired direction.  The film's lone redeeming point is Richard Boone's account of dogged police detective Ed Cornell.  Alas, that even suffers when compared to the masterful turn by Laird Cregar in ""Screaming"".  This is by no means a bad film just an ordinary one.  If it popped up on TCM you probably wouldn't be inclined to change the channel.",1158364800,15,533,4.568421052631579

2570064,3,B000FKO3VW,"Steve wondered, wondered to himself since his position at that moment precluded saying anything out loud, anything he really wanted to say, when they, the coppers who were just then giving him the ""third degree"" for the second time in his short sweet life, going to stop picking him up for a going over every time some drop-dead dizzy dishy dame got herself good and murdered in Manhattan, New York City, hell, the world. Yes, Vicki was dead, very dead, murdered,  found by him up in her walk- up apartment that she shared with her sister, her older sister, Jan, when he went to pick her up to take her to the airport, take her out of his life forever.  Don't try to make anything out of it, out of that ""forever"" part like the cops in front of him tried to do and he laughed in their faces. He explained, explained three times since you needed at least two times with cops and the extra one was for them after they finally got it the second time, kind of.  Sure, he didn't like Vicki running out of him, running out on her contracts leaving him stuck, stuck good, when Hollywood beckoned s but that was part of the business.  They didn't like that, didn't like a dent in their weak little set- up for him. Still he, her agent, her publicity agent, the guy who put her in the bright lights of Broadway and a guy who was, had been really, romantically involved with her (for public consumption mostly to help her career, and his) for a short while, was automatically on the spot. Again.

...and hence this remake of I Wake Up Screaming",1358812800,,1534,4.368421052631579
2570065,2,B000FKO3VW,"A pedestrian vehicle that is undermined even further by mediocre writing, uninspired directing, and lackluster acting, with the one exception being Richard Boone, who would have been better off being lackluster. Instead, he shamefully overacts in a role that, to add insult to injury, is poorly written to begin with. There's nothing ""noir"" about this noir wanna-be. None of these actors come close to playing hard-boiled, which is what this film sorely needed. There's never any doubt where this film is heading, and while sometimes inevitability can be compelling, in this movie it's no fun at all getting there. The one saving grace is that it's a blessedly short film.",1349827200,,672,5.118181818181818
2570066,2,B000FKO3VW,"I enjoyed "" I wake up screaming"", but this one reeks Low Budget from the settings to the entire cast.

All dialogue seemed so trite and boring that I got restless watching it and only finished about half of it. I love noir movies but I don't consider this one of the good ones.",1298332800,,374,4.0675675675675675
2570067,4,B000FKO3VW,"This might be a remake of the superior Fox production ""I Wake Up Screaming"" (1941), but that doesn't stop 1953's VICKI from being a top-drawer noir title on it's own merits.  Drawing heavily from the original movie--as well as ""Laura"" (1944), it provided Jeanne Crain with one of her final great movie roles at Fox, playing the sister of the glamorous title character.

When promising young model and singer Vicki Lynn (Jean Peters) is found slain in her apartment, veteran detective Ed Cornell (Richard Boone) calls off his vacation to work on the case.  A parade of viable suspects includes the publicist (Elliott Reid) who kick-started her career, a nervous young man (Aaron Spelling) who operates the switchboards at Vicki's apartment building; and even Vicki's own sister, Jill (Jeanne Crain).

Jean Peters is appropriately-mysterious playing the doomed Vicki.  In my opinion one of the most fascinating and lovely female contract players of the 1950s, Jean Peters' career at Fox sadly only lasted for a few years, yet she proved her worth in such movies as ""A Blueprint for Murder"", ""Niagara"" and ""Three Coins in the Fountain"".

Jeanne Crain sensitively plays down her performance as Jill, the ""dowdy"" sister of Vicki; this was one of her last major roles for the studio, having slowly reduced her workload in favour of expanding her real-life family.  Elliott Reid impresses in one of his rare performances as the full-blooded leading man; Max Showalter (always a delight) is the gossip columnist with even more ties to the enigmatic Vicki.

Comparisons to the original ""I Wake Up Screaming"" naturally abound throughout the VICKI script, yet I also found lots of allusions to ""Laura"" (another classic Fox noir dealing with a detective's obsession for a dead woman); indeed, one scene finds Jeanne Crain and Elliott Reid stumbling into a movie theater which is screening--would you believe it--""Laura""!!

The DVD includes audio commentary with noir historian Foster Hirsch, interactive galleries, the trailer; and sneak peeks at more titles in the Fox Film Noir series.",1258416000,2,2075,5.151785714285714
2570068,5,B000FKO3VW,Interesting and tautly paced thriller. Jeanne Crain is good as the sister while Jean Peters is good as the title character. The atmosphere is tight throughout.,1252800000,,159,5.153846153846154
2570069,5,B000FKO3VW,"When comparing this movie to the earlier version, ""I Wake Up Screaming"", you'll certainly enjoy Victor Mature. He's a good actor and gives a lot more emphasis to his role than Reed in ""Vicki"".
As to the other performers, I find Jean Peters was outstanding in this version. She's not only beatiful (she plays an ambitious model and really comes across as an ambitious model), she's also a fine actress. Her acting is far above Carole Landis' in the original film -she's more belivable in the role and has more screen time, too. Jeanne Crain is also great as Peters' sister. She's a good actress and musical Betty Grable (though I can't deny the fact that she's got a lot of carisma) is not as believable as Crain in this role. Moreover, Crain and Peters look like sisters and act like sisters. I heard the two actresses were true friends in real life and that comes across beautifully on the screen. Richard Boone is also superb, and I believe he was considered for an Academy Award for his performance in ""Vicki"" -so there you have it!
Fox may have spent more $$ on sets, etc., on the first version -they did, in fact, promote it on a much grander scale, but I do not agree that the first viersion was better than this one. Not at all!
""Vicki"" in fact has more suspense, has a better script, and better acting overall than ""I Wake up Screaming"". I saw both films back to back just to make certain, and only old Victor Mature fairs better in the more costly original version. ""Vicki"" has my vote. It's a more realistic, suspenseful and better acted film noir.",1234915200,4,1558,4.48943661971831
2570070,3,B000FKO3VW,"The thing caught my attention about this film was how stylish it is. The use of shadows, the lighting, the composition of the scenes; everything about it has a beautiful sense that it flows seamlessly and effortlessly from one thing to the next. The photography is excellent. Everything that should be clear and crisp is. Depth of field is used to great effect. The composition of each scene is excellent. The narrative flow between scenes is seamless because each shot leads the eye to the next. The lighting is just as good. Use of shadows is effective but never excessive. Highlighted areas enhance the shadows and create a 'larger than life' effect. The entire film gives a clinic on cinematography at its best.

The main characters are very engaging as well. Jean Peters shines as the night waitress caught up in the magnitude of her own ambition. Jeanne Crain is even better as the sister who tries to guard her against both herself and the people driving her. Her character has more depth than the one played by Peters because she's allowed to show vulnerability as well as the restraint of the 'older' sister. The standout performance however, comes from Richard Boone. His presence and character is, literally, mesmerizing. His grasp of the character's nuances is frightening, compelling and utterly complete. He owns every moment he's on the screen.

The rest of the cast doesn't fare as well. Whether the fault lay with the actors, the direction, or the writing is hard to determine. Whatever the reason, the performances of the supporting players range between bland and excessive and nonchalant. They weren't given much to work with though. Eliot Reid is kept at the forefront simply because he has a lot of time on the screen. Apart from that he's about as exciting as unsalted butter. Aaron Spelling, by contrast, has almost nothing to do. His character would be forgettable if it weren't for his Ham on Pumpernickel performance continually reminding the audience that he's weird. Between all of this Carl Betz is basically a suit with lines.

Still, none of this really hurts the picture much. The supporting characters have little depth but they serve the story well. The narrative itself is engaging and tightly wound. The flow of that narrative, thanks to the splendid cinematography, is superb. The acting is solid enough and the players (even in their 'Pumpernickel' moments) never seem like they're forcing their lines. The restoration and transfer to DVD is excellent and the packaging is tasteful.

This film is, apparently, a remake of ""I Wake Up Screaming"". According to other reviews ""Vicki"" is not as good as the first one. I can't comment on that because I haven't seen the first version (at least not recently enough to remember it anyway). This film however, is a good one. It stands well on its own and is an excellent one to spend an evening watching.",1219536000,2,2884,4.8795918367346935

2570074,1,B000FKO3VW,"'I Wake Up Screaming' was a tightly written, well directed, thoroughly intriging film noir with great performances from all it's leads. In contrast this lame remake boasts a lousy talky script completely in lacking in structure or even common sense together with decidely wooden performances from all concerned. Special mention must be made of the leading man who can't wipe the idiotic smile from his face even when facing a murder rap. One wonders what insanity prompted the studio to put out this out especially when the original had been a runaway success at the box office.

2570075,3,B000FKO3VW,"A remake of ""I Wake Up Screaming,"" I was interested enough to follow it through to the end, even knowing how it ends. That said, it's only a so-so film.  And though it's marketed as a film noir, I think it's that only in the loosest sense of the term. Lots of things are labeled noir as a selling point and often stretch that point - one of my pet peeves. While it had some noir elements, mostly it played and looked like a straight mystery-suspense movie. The lack of true noir may have something to do with when it was made, after the major noir cycle. Richard Boone is not nearly as menacing or creepy as Laird Cregar in the original. Lots of people in this one who went on to bigger things: Boone, Carl Betz, Aaron Spelling. Worth watching, but if you're looking for real film noir this ain't it.",1180224000,,800,4.2631578947368425

2570077,3,B000FKO3VW,"I Wake Up Screaming must be some book. Not content with making a single film adaptation of it in 1941, 20th Century Fox gave it a second go-around twelve years later with this picture, now called Vicki. Regardless of whether anyone actually wakes up screaming (they don't), I think I like the original title better, if only for its pulpy luridness. Besides, the single word Vicki recalls noir siblings Gilda and Laura, which are quite simply in a different class (more on that later).

Jean Peters is no Rita Hayworth. Neither is she Gene Tierney. Hell, she's no Carole Landis, who plays the same role in Vicki's previous Screaming incarnation.

Not that this picture is terrible. Sure, it lacks Landis' sex appeal, Betty Grable's charm, and Edward Cronjager's dramatic noir cinematography of I Wake Up Screaming. Otherwise, it adheres so closely to the original, you would have thought Gus Van Sant directed it (indeed, whole shots, framing, and long passages of dialogue are copied exact - Dwight Taylor gets sole screenwriting credit on both pictures). And the original isn't bad.

The titular Vicki is a cover girl print model discovered as a waitress in a cafeteria (she is first seen framed in the proverbial shop window, where she would like to stay in perpetuity - modeling is, after all, a business of objectification), on the fast track to stardom until her murder puts an end to all that. We revisit her rise to fame through the reminiscing (and police interrogations) of her sister (Jeanne Crain) and romantic suitors (principally Elliott Reid), all suspects in the crime. However, the eagerness with which a certain police lieutenant (Richard Boone, not as good as Laird Cregar...am I repeating myself?) tries to pin guilt on one of them leads one to wonder how innocent he is in this whole mess.

Title aside, Vicki offers other engraved invitations to compare it (mostly unfavorably) with the superior Laura (which came out, to acclaim, 9 years previous). An opening credit shot of Vickie's framed portrait is one. The narrative structure, whereby the title character is shown chiefly in flashback after their death, is another. Then there's the tough guy detective with quasi-necrophilic obsession with a deceased beauty, interviewing shallow high society suspects - the envelopes are starting to pile up, no?

It's always bizarre when films seek to remind us of other, better ones, demonstrating how inferior they are with the comparison.

Interesting footnote: Aaron Spelling makes an appearance here, in one of his early acting roles. Look for him as a creepy desk clerk in Vickie's building. Also, the original I Wake Up Screaming became somewhat of a cursed film for its talented cast. Laird Cregar died three years after its release at 30 (complications due to a crash diet) while rising star Carole Landis was in the grave four short years afterwards (suicide).",1168992000,7,2884,5.023012552301255

8123969,3,B000FKO3VW,"Vicki, 1953 film

A covered body is removed from a building. A man gets out of a Yellow Cab and enters a hotel. Its very quiet there. The newspaper headline says Model Slain. The man makes a telephone call to New York City. Ed Cornell wants the case. Cornell looks at photographs. One man in interrogated and accused of the killing. How did Christopher meet Vicki Lynn? He talks about the past. Two men meet a waitress, one gives her his card. Later he promotes her to caf society. Other men meet her. Vicki was young, pretty, and ambitious. [Do things still work that way today?] Vicki came from Harrisburg Pennsylvania to live with her sister, who works as a secretary. Vicki wants to be somebody, she has sponsors. Her sister cautions her.

Will publicity get her a job as a model? Yes. Vicki also sings. Vicki was offered a screen test and is going to Hollywood! She breaks off with Steve Christopher, who had contracts for her. Her sister tells about a man who watched Vicki; it was Ed Cornell! Cornell questions Vickis sister Jill; she found the body, Steve Christopher was already there. The Chief tells Christopher they have a new suspect - the switchboard boy at the hotel has gone missing. But Cornell still likes Christopher as the suspect. Another man Robin Ray is brought in for questioning. But he has an alibi. Jill gathers Vickis belongings. Cornell drops by to talk to her; does she know more?

Jill meets Christopher and they talk. Things heat up when Cornell meets Christopher and hits him. Can Christopher find a place to hide after Jill helps him? Cornell calls for the arrest of Jill and Steve. Policemen take in Jill but Steve hides. Cornell has a plan to catch Christopher: turn Jill loose. Jill finds cards for Vickis flowers, Steve identifies the source. Larry Evans tells Steve what he did that afternoon. Who was in the closet? Where was the switchboard boy? Jill and Steve plan a ruse on Harry. Will it work? Harry talks, the police take him in. Steve asks for 5 minutes with Cornell. He tells Ed about the talk with Williams. Cornell talks to Steve about Vicki and his hopes. And so the story ends.

This has a complex story. Did you expect the ending? Could it have been slightly different? Or did the Hollywood Production Code prevent this? The story tells about life in that era, such as police interrogation of suspects. Does it serve as a warning against a small-town girl who tries to find fame in show business? It takes more than good looks to make it in show business.",1512604800,,2507,4.589285714285714
