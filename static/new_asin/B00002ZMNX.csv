Her cowboy clothes are too baggy for any feminine sexuality to be expressed. She needed Edith Head to slim her cowboy clothes down ,ala, Jane Russell from "" Son of Paleface "". Too bad for us.",1176163200,2,313,4.396551724137931
1256422,3,B00002ZMNX,"This neat little B western is typical of the sort of film that studios used to produce in quantity for kiddie consumption at Saturday matinees. When TV came along, they became the staple of Saturday morning at-home viewing.
This film has a neat, simple plot and sticks well to the basics. What raises it above others is the work of the two stars --- Robert Mitchum and Barbara Hale who both went onto much bigger careers, he in a long string of A movies (Out of the Past is only two years off) and she as the Emmy-winning Della Street on TV's Perry Mason.
Thurston Hall who had a career playing bankers, tycoons and senators gets a few laughs as Hale's father who sets out for the west on the advice of his doctor. Too bad ripe character acting like this went out of fashion. It enhances the movie considerably.
It may not be Shane or The Shootist, but it is darn entertaining.",1172620800,10,877,4.386503067484663
1256423,3,B00002ZMNX,"This is Mitch's follow up to Nevada, both made at RKO.  Again he is teamed up with Richard Martin in his almost famous Chito Rafferty role.  Also in this one is the lovely Barbara Hale, who would gain fame as Perry Mason's side kick Della Street. Hale actually steals this movie from Mitch and the others.  In between Nevada and this one, a very interesting thing happened to Mitchum, similar to John Wayne's experience in Stagecoach that would propel him out of B grade Westerns and features.  He was cast in a supporting role in The Story of G. I. Joe and was nominated for an Academy Award.  Soon Mitch would no longer be doing oaters like this one.",1125014400,22,652,4.445378151260504
1256424,3,B00002ZMNX,"Made at RKO in 1945, movie stars Robert Mitchum in an early starring role as Pecos Smith.  Richard Martin is again teamed with Mitch as Chito Rafferty.  Martin had appeared with Mitch in Nevada, playing Chito.  Barbara Hale of Perry Mason fame is on hand as the female lead, and steals the movie.  Movie was remade in 1949 as the StageCoach Kid with Tim Holt in the Mitchum part, and Martin reprising his famous Rafferty character.  Matin played Chito 32 times.",1114041600,,461,4.6419753086419755

7916354,4,B00002ZMNX,"I really enjoy these old Zane Grey westerns, and this early Robert Mitchum vehicle was no exception.  The extras about Zane Grey were most interesting, regardless of the poor video quality (early TV?).  Too bad they couldn't be higher resolution, Zane Grey's story is fascinating in its own right.",1485561600,,297,5.040816326530612

7916362,3,B00002ZMNX,"Robert Mitchum got the best notices of his early career for his strong performance in the loose adaptation of the Zane Grey novel. He plays Pecos Smith a cowhand with a strong sense of right and wrong and who is at odds with the local vigilantes run by a man named Sawtell (Harry Woods).Sawtell is using the vigilantes as a front to carry out stagecoach robberies and Pecos is wise to this .He also comes to the aid of a party lead by Chicago based newspaper magnate ,Lambert (Thurston Hall) who is out west for health reasons .They are stranded in the desert when their wagon breaks down .One of the party is Lambert's headstrong but determined daughter  ( a debuting Barbara Hale ,giving a  strong performance).She is in disguise as  a boy  in order to forestall  unwanted male attention ,a situation giving rise to much amusing misunderstanding.

Lambert joins Pecos in oppostion to the vigilantes and the scene is set for lots of well staged action in a lively and at times amusing Western  that benefits from good  performances all round",1203724800,5,1042,4.686813186813187
