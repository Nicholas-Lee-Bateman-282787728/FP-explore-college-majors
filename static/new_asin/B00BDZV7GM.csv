5582129,5,B00BDZV7GM,"Good show if you want to see early work of Jessica Alba she was great in this show, worth buying if you are a fan.",1378252800,,114,3.6
5582130,5,B00BDZV7GM,Good family fun.  I became a fan of the new cast despite many changes from the first season.  It is a good mix of adventure and humor with better interaction than I would have expected.,1376956800,,185,4.257142857142857
5582131,4,B00BDZV7GM,"This was a good series for family entertainment,  It could have been much better if they eliminated many of the scenes of the dolphin squeaking and diving. In fact, they could have eliminated the dolphin altogether for a better show.",1370908800,,233,4.825
5582132,3,B00BDZV7GM,"What can I say about this other than you likely want it to see the early Jessica Alba stuff. It's clear in the first 5 episodes that they showcased her at every opportunity, but then they quickly shifted the focus more towards the blonde girl & very little Maya.
The image quality is not very good. it's clearly from broadcast video copies & the lack of detail makes that obvious. It's nothing more than OK & if the price is cheap enough, go ahead & pick it up.",1363392000,4,461,4.25
5582133,2,B00BDZV7GM,"First of all I have pre-ordered this DVD!

My 2 star rating is for the very likely substandard picture quality upon its release, the season 2 show itself I would give 5 stars

This is a similar response to a comment I left for on a previous review.

Hopefully the quality improves because this release is by TGG Direct the same Company that also released The Best Of Flipper The New Adventures season 2, an abomination really and the reason why I say this is because I'm sure most fans would rather pay a little extra for this new release than have the same problems that plagued The Best Of release.

If this compares with the best of season 2 DVD'S the end result will most likely have the same quality losses due to the compression of the episodes on to these discs (5 episodes per disc) leading to below average picture and colour quality.

The episodes for all 4 seasons of Flipper The New Adventures was recently aired on Australian digital television with outstanding picture quality and so much better than the TGG Direct DVD for The Best of Flipper.

Season ones on demand dvd-r release from a different studio was near perfect and they considered the fans of the show quality wise by placing less episodes on each disc.

Finally the price for this pre-order is high so maybe shop around for a savings of close to $10.00!",1362873600,4,1330,4.516666666666667

5582135,5,B00BDZV7GM,"I used to watch this show in my late teens, so great they have this on dvd to relive, only disapointment is the picture quality, its average at best, it doesn't look like they did anything to it as far as remastering or anything, its just a plain picture, but other than that this is a must own for any fan of this show when it was on, i remember having a mad crush on Jessica Alba, can't believe how hot she was on this, i remember thinking at the time, this is the hottest girl in the world, this was really her breakthrough role into what she became.",1355184000,4,553,4.08256880733945
5582136,4,B00BDZV7GM,"[UPDATED] Well ended up cancelling my order. I pre-ordered it 2-3 week headed of release, but didn't ever get it, and it was never shipped. I look a day after release date and it says ""Temporarily out of stock"". I wonder if anyone got it??? And a few day later they lowed the price to $12.99 hmmm, guess I will wait and see, when ever they release this.

Great series. First 2 are my favorite. The only real problem I had was with the cover. THIS IS SEASON 2, but the cover they used is from season 1. Only one of the character on the cover is in this season, Maya. Character on the disc 2, he is not in this season. But other then that, like them to come out with all the seasons of this series on DVD.

Episodes that you get. Truth, they didn't pick the best, they just gave you the first 10 episodes. They should have just said Season 2 - Volume 1, not Best of Season 2

8566838,4,B00BDZV7GM,"I'll start off with why I didn't give it 5 stars...  The compression is HORRIBLE!!!  Hulu did a better job of compressing the video for their service.  The video is so poorly compressed, I'd offer to do the compression work for a re-release of these for free because I worked on the show and am horrified how bad this looks on screen.

Having said that, this show is awesome.  I grew up on the original show and had the privilege to work on this series.  Shout out to all the cast and crew.  Hope everyone is doing well.  Nice to finally be able to watch what you worked on 20 years later!",1530835200,,589,4.196428571428571
