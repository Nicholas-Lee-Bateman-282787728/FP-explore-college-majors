393002,5,6301969413,"I never get tired of this film. I'm drawn to it every time I see it's being shown on TV.
This is a really well written story, set at the height of the cold war. It involves the Soviets and the Americans rushing to the Arctic to retrieve a film pod jettisoned from a reconnaissance satellite, and has fallen in the wrong area. As the Americans get close to the Pole, it becomes clear there's a traitor in thier midst.
The cast is a good one, and they did a good job on this one. I'll be glad when it's on DVD.",1050537600,2,508,3.9901960784313726
393003,5,6301969413,Actual submarine footage enhances this cold war drama. Excellent acting and a great cast give credibility as well. Adaptation of Mc Clean`s novel wasvery well done.

393044,5,6301969413,"This a great action suspense film from the height of the Cold War. Although it only loosely follows Alistair McLean's novel of the same name,
it's actually a better, more tightly woven story than the book's version. Lots of familiar faces in the cast, at least to Baby Boomers in the audience.
Good special effects, especially for 1968. It holds up very well.",1517529600,,359,4.714285714285714
393045,5,6301969413,"Loved the movie. Made in 1968, it has some familiar faces from the era in movies and TV. Rock Hudson leads a submarine military group to a remote ""Ice Station"" named ZEBRA to take possession of a highly sensitive film capsule that has military implications.
Ernest Borgnine, Patrick Mcgoohan, Jim Brown and a host of other actors lead the cast.
This is a nice and clean, clear copy! Picture and sound are pretty flawless for the 50th Anniversary this year of the film.
Some age has shown, but it's not bad considering when and no CGI was used.

I am wondering however. This Blu-ray edition shows a running time of 2 hours 28 minutes. The DVD version, which includes an intermission period, runs 2 hours 31 minutes, 34 seconds.
** Special Features are a Vintage ""Making Of"" Featurette ""The Man Who Makes The Difference"" and a handful of Theatrical Trailers from the era.

393052,5,6301969413,"From the initial credits we see that this film will have something to do with satellites, the soviets and the U.S.
Looks like an accident has happened at the North Pole (Ice station Zebra). The U.S. with Brittan, and the soviets are rushing to the rescue. Both are hampered by a snow storm. The U.S. has sent a submarine to the rescue. However it looks like something covert is afoot. The submarine is being packed with marines and an unscrupulous acting character. What is the secret? Will the sub even make it to the pole? And if so what will they find? Why are the soviets so keen in helping?
Because critical scenes take place in the snow our characters are color coded:
Brown furry top with brown trousers = David Jones (Patrick McGoohan)
All blue = Cmdr. Ferriday (Rock Hudson)
Brown practically furless with black and white bands = Boris Vaslov (Ernest Borgnine)
Orange and yellow = sub crew
All white with m16's = marines
All white with AK's = soviets
* You may have guest that it is a mans movie with all men *
This story as adapted for the movies could make a pretty good stage play as the real action is the bantering and posturing during a face to face confrontation. Another movie adaptation from the author (Alistair MacLean) is ""The Guns of Navarone"" (1961).
The original music for this film also stands on its own; you may want to buy the sound track.",1503792000,,1367,4.493975903614458

393116,5,6301969413,"I first saw Ice Station Zebra in the late 1960s on a big screen with my parents.  I recently watched it for the first time in years and I still enjoyed it. The color cinematography was what most impressed at the time. I was also fascinated by the technology. The idea of a nuclear powered submarine sailing under the North Pole was novel.

The film is based upon Alastair MacLean's 1963 bestselling novel of the same name. It involves a mission to rescue British scientists trapped at the North Pole. An American nuclear submarine is sent to investigate. This is a Cold War spy adventure so nothing is at it seems. Macleans plots are convoluted and there is always a twist at the end. MacLean served in the British navy during World War II before becoming a school teacher and then a successful thriller writer. His books have often been turned into movies (e.g., The Guns of Navarone, Where Eagles Dare, and Force 10 from Navarone).

John Sturges was good at directing intelligent action films (e.g., The Magnificent Seven and The Great Escape). Zebra has an excelllent cast that includes Rock Hudson, Patrick McGoohan, Ernest Borgnine, and Jim Brown. McGoohan is very good as 'David Jones' an arrogant British spy. Ernest Borgnine steals scenes as a Soviet defector who now works for the West. Rock Hudson is convincing as the submarine captain. He exudes calm and authority.

It is not a film that professional film critics have ever warmed to. Roger Ebert described it as ""a dull, stupid movie and it has a 36% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. However, Howard Hughes, who was very smart, loved this film. Apparently, he watched it over 150 times. These days, Hollywood routinely makes movies a lot dumber than this. I have always liked this film.",1492819200,7,1744,4.764900662251655
393117,4,6301969413,"This review is for the Blu-Ray version of 'Ice Station Zebra' released in October, 2012 by Warner Brothers.

I'm just throwing my opinion in on the quality of the blu-ray and my opinion of the plot and that's it on this one.

BLU-RAY:The picture itself is pretty much perfect to these eyes. I last saw this movie around 1980 on an old TV and never realized how nice the picture was. It was quite a revelation to see this movie again looking like it was just filmed yesterday.
So as far as the picture goes, I'm giving that 5 stars.
EXTRA'S: I was hoping for more. What you get is a short documentary on the second unit photographer and a trailer. You also get subtitles.

THOUGHTS/CONCLUSIONS: I decided to revisit this movie after reading about how Howard Hughes watched this movie hundreds of times over and over while holed up in his hotel in Las Vegas. I wondered if it was as good as I remembered when I was young or was Hughes just crazy.....Hughes was obviously crazy. While not a bad movie, I can't see how anybody could view this movie repeatedly without dying of boredom. It's really not all that good but not terrible either. There is much less action than my childhood memories remember.
I'm  giving the movie itself 2 1/2 to 3 stars.

Overall I'm giving the movie 4 stars by averaging the picture quality with the plot.",1492387200,,1332,4.487603305785124
393118,5,6301969413,"Although made before I was born, this is an awesome movie.  In the beginning the shot of the satellite and music reminded me of some scenes from Star Wars.  A lot of the submarine scenes reminded me of The Hunt For Red October.  The only negative thing I can say about the movie is that the Marine Lt at the end did something that was unrealistic, distracting, and didn't add to the plot.  Maybe they were just showing that sometimes during the Cold War there were casualties written off as accidents.  Who knows...  Also, having the Paratroopers and Marines walk towards each other right after a firefight is kind of silly.  Anyway, if 60's special effects annoy you, this isn't the show for you.  Also, if you are looking for every detail to be technically correct, you won't like this.  After all, the Russian jets that were used in the end started off looking correct, but then they clearly used some American jets as stand-ins.  But the drama going on at that point makes up for it.  Highly recommended unless you are a Type-A Military perfectionist.",1492300800,5,1055,4.618279569892473

My impression watching it today is the same as my impression then. Strong, engaging first half trailing off into a long, boring hodgepodge, made worse by terrible special effects. Soviet MIG-21's suddenly transformed into US F-4 Phantoms for one. And especially disappointing since the prior submarine sets looked so authentic and the action across them so compelling.

393237,2,6301969413,"In theory, ""Ice Station Zebra"" should have hit all my buttons: I love Cold War spy thrillers, I love submarine movies, I *really* love bleak Arctic/Antarctic settings, I love Patrick McGoohan, I'm pretty fond of Ernest Borgnine, and I have a high tolerance for B-movie silliness. Instead, I was palpably disappointed by a movie which has the sloth-like pacing of ""2001,"" but which has, instead of Kubrick & Clarke's brilliance, the special effects of a ""Flash Gordon"" serial, a score that's more Burt Bacharach than Richard Strauss, and a script that is remarkable for its dullness, save for those rare moments when it's simply confusing. The actors all try hard - Patrick McGoohan energetically gives a remarkably good performance given what little material he has to work with, Ernest Borgnine is as irrepressible as ever, Jim Brown has an absolutely intense on-screen presence, and even the generally mediocre Rock Hudson gets a few good moments in. But it's not enough to make up for the movie's many, many failings.

The kicker is - with this plot, these actors, these mediocre effects, and even a completely unchanged script, this could have been a perfectly serviceable B-grade thriller. It wouldn't have been a classic by any means, and I probably still would have walked away with my lofty expectations disappointed, but it would have been basically enjoyable. But the simply atrocious pacing and the movie's attempts to present itself as a sophisticated art-movie with something significant to say about the world combine with everything else to produce one of the most tedious and unengaging movies it has been my displeasure to watch.",1469491200,,1646,5.0962962962962965

Has the intermission, and all related entry and exit music.  Mostly made indoors to control effects, I really like this.

393438,2,6301969413,"I was disappointed by this 1968 adaptation of Alistair MacLean's spy novel. There were many changes made to the original material and most of them were, for my personal taste, completely useless and very, very stupid which resulted in serious damage caused to the cohesion and logics of the story. Below, more of my personal impressions, with some LIMITED SPOILERS.

A satellite re-enters the atmosphere and ejects a capsule which parachutes to the Arctic. Very soon after Commander James Ferraday (Rock Hudson), captain of the U.S. nuclear attack submarine USS ""Tigerfish"" (SSN-509), stationed at Holy Loch, Scotland, is ordered to make sail to the Arctic (small precision here  in real life there never was a US submarine named ""Tigerfish""). His mission is to rescue the personnel of Drift Ice Station Zebra, a British civilian scientific weather station moving with the ice pack. However, as he welcomes on board a British intelligence agent ""Mr. Jones"" (Patrick McGoohan), a whole platoon of heavily armed US Marines under Captain Anders (Jim Brown) and Boris Vaslov (Ernest Borgnine), a Russian defector who is a colleague of ""Mr. Jones"", it becomes quickly obvious that the mission is actually a cover for a more dangerous, highly classified assignment. And then the film begins.

This could have been a very good spy/action thriller. I mean, you take a good novel by Alistair MacLean (""Guns of Navarone"", ""Where eagles dare"") with action taking place in Arctica, a place which always inspired this author (""Night without end"" is a masterpiece), you take for directing no lesser a person than John Sturges (""The magnificent seven""), you get a huge budget (8 million USD  1968 dollars) and actors like Rock Hudson, Patrick McGoohan and Ernest Borgnine. How can you possibly mess it up? Well, this film clearly proves that nothing is impossible

The poor, absurd scenario is the main problem. For the needs of the film the story was so much changed that ultimately there is not much left from the book and also many mistakes were made. One of the worse ideas was to change the identity of the main villain, who in the film is possibly the most obvious person possible and therefore most of the suspense is gone. Everything that happens once the submarine surfaces in the Arctic was changed and as result became un incomprehensible mess. But the worst thing is the last 15 minutes, which have nothing more to do with what happens in the book and in which Western soldiers and Soviet soldiers are shown as just two equally honourable and respectable sides in what turns out to be a kind of misunderstanding  when in the book the mission is clearly for Western agents to recover crucial intelligence, which Soviets covet immensely too. The absurdity of the scenario makes the watching of this very long film (150 minutes) a quite difficult thing.

The good things in this film are the character of ""Mr. Jones"" and the way Patrick McGoohan played him. Some scenes on board of USS ""Tigerfish"" are also very honest and Rock Hudson gives a good show as the captain. This is why I give to this film two stars  but other than that there is only disappointment. I gave this film away as soon as I finished watching it and I just really want to forget it. AVOID!",1442793600,,3255,4.841726618705036

393466,3,6301969413,"Like other reviewers, I have read the book by MacLean and the movie is just a pale imitation of the book. It lacks the twists and turns and challenges that made the book a stunner. The movie starts out fairly well, with a sequence showing a capsule being ejected from a satellite, re-entering the earth, and then landing in the Arctic. We see a man locate the capsule in a strong ice storm and open it, and we also see a second man observing the first. Then the scene cuts over quickly to a Scottish pub, where a well-dressed young man meets a much older gentleman in a private room. The older man gives the younger man orders to locate Ice Station Zebra in the Arctic and to take on a ""passenger"" named Jones. The younger man turns out to be a U. S. Navy submarine commander: Captain Ferraday in command of the nuclear submarine USS Dolphin. He takes on the mysterious Jones as a passenger, and a unit of the U. S. Marines. Later, the submarine is ordered to take on 2 additional passengers: a Russian named Vaslov, and a U. S. Marine captain named Anders, both of whom are delivered to the submarine by helicopter.

There is a lot of dramatic submarine sailing footage, and considerable submariner mumbo jumbo talk, but no really exciting action until the submarine tries to load a torpedo tube in order to blast a hole in the ice cap above it. After that, the entire movie goes flat in terms of action.

Jones is completely undistinguished in the film. All he does is scream at Ferraday, throw things around, and drink whiskey to great excess. He shows no cleverness whatsoever, no ability to make logical deductions or think through the clues he has for his mission. He shakes an injured civilian member of the ice station when the man is too weak to answer a question. Vaslov is equally undistinguished in every respect.

This movie hopes to score points by showing submariners in action. The ""torpedo"" we see looks fake, the name of the explosive mentioned by Ferraday seems fake as well, and we can't really be sure of the authenticity of the submarine. I'm not sure if the U. S. Navy allows its submarines to be featured in this way. Or perhaps we saw an old submarine boat that was about to be taken out of service. The actual plot of finding the mysterious capsule at the Ice Station is poorly executed and more than a little stupid. Jones in particular comes through more like a short-tempered alcoholic than a highly skilled detective and spy.

As a deaf viewer, I deeply appreciate the presence of captioning in the movie.

I'm not sure how authentic some of the under-the-ice-cap shots are. If those are genuine then they are indeed impressive.",1437264000,,2658,4.563941299790357

393471,5,6301969413,"A great cast, excellent screenplay, and numerous twists and turns make ""Ice Station Zebra"" a classic Cold War espionage action film. Clocking at almost two and a half hours (It still has the intermission title card!), the film is long but never boring. The cast is anchored by Rock Hudson as Commander James Ferraday, commander of a US nuclear submarine tasked with transporting an arrogant and aloof British agent, David Jones, played to perfection by Patrick McGoohan. Their highly classified mission is to go to Ice Station Zebra, a scientific outpost at the North Pole to rescue survivors of an accident. Obviously there's more going on than meets the eye, and only Jones seems to know it all. That ends when a highly animated Ernest Borgnine as a Russian defector turned agent shows up along with a load of armed troops led by the extremely cranky Jim Brown.

There is tension both internal (e.g. navigating under ice) and external (e.g. Soviet paratroopers) present throughout, and it becomes clear that there is a traitor in the submarine, but who is it? There are plenty of suspicions to go around, but as the film reaches its crescendo around two hours in, director John Sturges carefully and skillfully conceals the enemy agent's identity for longer than would be imagined possible. The plot is quite intricate and I won't recount it here as I don't want to spoil any of the excitement for first time viewers, though I will say that I read the Alistair MacLean novel when I was a teenager and loved it, and this is one film that actually does the novel justice.

This is Cold War moviemaking at its best, and while younger generations may not be able to grasp the extreme tension parts of this film evokes in older viewers, the finale with the US versus USSR is a showdown done right, and culminates with a brilliantly executed ending. Hudson is outstanding as the uber-cool sub skipper, while McGoohan steals the show as a British spy: this was made around the same time he was making ""The Prisoner"" television series, which I also highly recommend, and the similarity between Jones and Number Six are notable. This is one of the better adaptations of a Cold War novel, and it was nominated for two Academy Awards. Although some of the tension of the film was dependent on audience fears of superpower conflicts that are now overshadowed by more recent events, ""Ice Station Zebra"" stands the test of time far better than most action movies, and I recommend it enthusiastically.",1435276800,6,2488,4.7972027972027975

First, I have to provide a bit of a disclaimer in that it brings back unique, fond memories I have of watching this with my dad during one of the rare weekends we had together when I was growing up (divorce, etc.). So, I'll always be a bit biased when it comes to this film. Second, that aside, I really loved this movie just from an adventure/espionage Cold War tale perspective. Yes, it is a bit cheesy in parts, but overall it's got some of the old Hollywood greats, and they play their roles true to form.

The story unfolds with a submarine-full of plot twists and hidden agendas that keep it interesting all the way through to the last few scenes.

I'd love to see this film remade today, perhaps with an updating to make it more relevant for modern events.",1423180800,2,837,4.291139240506329
393562,2,6301969413,"Much to do about nothing. Cold war or not, this film could have been considerably shorter. Many Submarine films have been successfully taut and suspenseful. This took way too long to deliver too small a payoff. characters introduced too late made this drag in the end. I have watched this film four or five times over the years to make sure I didn't miss anything. The only reason I assume more people like it is because of it's relevance during the cold war. Now it is flat on dialog and action. McGoohan is generally strong, but is just annoying in this film. Earnest B. is not the most convincing Russian, Rock, has never been Mr. Excitement in any film.

393906,4,6301969413,"I have watched this movie a number of times over the years. I always enjoy it despite a few slow spots.

It is based on a book of the same name by Alistair MacLean.

The movie stars Rock Hudson as a sub captain and Patrick McGoohan as some kind of secret operative. Ernest Borgnine plays a Russian defector sent along to help, along with Jim Brown as a USMC captain. Rock Hudson seems out of place to me as a sub captain. I keep expecting to see Doris Day pop up somewhere. But the rest of the cast does a fine job.

The plot is typical MacLean. Shadowy people with uncertain loyalties on some kind of secret mission that may or may not be what it seems.

The nuances of this kind of story are tough to get across in a movie that is only a few hours long. A book has a lot longer to set the tone. But, as such things go, it is done pretty well.

There are some places where the movie drags a bit, but they are few and short lived. The most exhilarating scene is where a torpedo tube is opened to sea and water rushes into the sub.",1404691200,,1030,4.004878048780488
393907,4,6301969413,"This Cold War film puts the captain of a nuclear submarine (played by Rock Hudson) in a race against time to rescue the men trapped at Ice Station Zebra, a weather station at the North Pole. There has been some kind of disaster at the station but there is more to the incident than meets the eye. To start, the captain has a passenger: ""Mr. Jones,"" a secret agent (played by Patrick McGoohan, who had a lot of experience playing secret agents). He is also sent a platoon of Marines.

The ice station turns out to have recovered a roll of film from a Soviet spy satellite (the idea of a special Anglo-American  spy camera being used by the Soviets is a plot device which is a little hard to swallow). Someone sabotages the sub and there are a lot of twists and turns as loyalties seemingly change. Overall a great film!",1404518400,,818,4.375

393909,3,6301969413,"ICE STATION ZEBRA, (1968).  This 149 minute all-star action/drama classic was based on a cracking mens adventure yarnwhy is it always called a yarn?  Of the same name by Scottish author Alistair Maclean, (THE GUNS OF NAVARONE).  In it, American sub commander James Ferraday (Rock Hudson) and his crew navigate dangerous waters. The submarine USS Tigerfish is sent under false pretenses to the North Pole, supposedly to rescue British scientists trapped at Ice Station Zebra, a weather station, after some unspecified disaster.  But Ferraday and his eclectic crew, joined by Russian defector Boris Vasilov, (Ernest Borgnine), British secret agent David Jones, (Patrick McGoohan) and tough Marine captain Leslie Anders, (Jim Brown) -- are actually racing the Russian military to retrieve top secret information. There's a double agent among them, and time is running out. The Cold War thriller was competently helmed by John Sturges, (THE GREAT ESCAPE, THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN).  And be aware, as befits a 1968 suspenser, it was filmed in Cinerama, and all the letter-boxing in the world, all your 60-inch screens, will not do it justice in your home theater.

Hudson, (GIANT, PILLOW TALK), does not exactly give off old bull macho vibes as Ferraday, but he labors manfully to make the part believable.  Borgnine, (MARTY, THE DIRTY DOZEN, THE WILD BUNCH), does well in a part that was a one-off for him. McGoohan, (THE SECRET AGENT, THE PRISONER, two popular British television shows), gives us his trademark cynical British spy.  Jim Brown, (THE DIRTY DOZEN), former Cleveland Browns star football player, looks big and mean-tempered.  Tony Bill is Lt. Russell Walker, and Gerald S. OLoughlin is Lt. Cdr. Bob Raeburn of the crew: I kept trying to get a good look at these actors, but owing to the shrunken state of the film, was unable to.  Lloyd Nolan, (HANNAH AND HER SISTERS), is Admiral Garvey.

The movie was scored by Michel Legrand, its witty screenplay was by Douglas Heyes.  Despite its big budget for the time, the special effects haven't stood up especially well.  However, the Arctic sets are interesting looking, and actually have moving parts as the pack ice threatens the lives of both men and their ship.  Eccentric American billionaire Howard Hughes was reputed to love the movie, and to have watched it hundreds of times.

394055,2,6301969413,"Ice Station Zebra was one of the last road show movies ever made, a film that on initial release played only in select theaters with reserve seating and one or two showings a day, complete with overtures and intermissions. While classics such as Lawrence of Arabia and Dr. Zhivago did give audiences a feel of seeing something special, anyone unfortunate enough to plunk down premium dollars for Ice Station Zebra got an overpadded, confused movie that never made up its mind what type of film it wanted to be.

Zebra is based on a novel by Alistair MacLean, author of The Guns of Navarone and Where Eagles Dare. MacLean's novels were intricately plotted, with double and triple crosses galore and few of the characters being what they seemed initially. This type of book is difficult to translate faithfully onscreen, and it's no wonder that movies like Navarone and Eagles played up the action and played down the intrigue. Sadly, Zebra never quite makes up its mind as to which direction it wants to go.

A government research lab in the Arctic has recovered a downed spy satellite and a U.S. submarine commanded by Rock Hudson is sent to retrieve it. Also onboard is Patrick McGoohan, a shadowy government type who knows far more about what's going on at the station than he's telling. And the Russians have sent their own sub to get to the satellite first, and may have planted an agent or two on Hudson's sub to boot.

While there's a lot of potential for great action here and a terrific action director in John Sturges (The Magnificent Seven) helming the venture, the movie has only one solid action sequence, a segment just before intermission in which the sub nearly sinks because a torpedo tube is left open at the wrong time. The rest of the action is distinctly small scale and low key and would fit in a typical episode of Marvel's Agents of SHIELD. In addition, Hudson lacks the gravitas to pull off his role here. McGoohan does have a lot of fun hamming it up, however. He was an actor who always came across as smarter than his material and it shows here, as he delights playing verbal games with Hudson and the audience, letting on a bit but not too much.

Instead of trying to be either a tricky thriller or a high-voltage action film, Ice Station Zebra tries to be both and fails. No matter how much fun McGoohan has with his speech making, even he can't completely hide the inane nature of the script. Nor can Sturges' talents salvage more than one solid action sequence. Apparently, Christopher McQuarrie, writer of The Usual Suspects, is planning to helm a remake of Ice Station Zebra, and I have high hopes that he can deliver the type of screenplay this film needs. Until that happens, however, we are left with this frozen (in more ways than one) Cold War relic.",1387929600,2,2788,4.626262626262626

Doris Day is nowhere to be found in this flick, but Rock Hudson survived just fine without her.  This movie was a far cry from Marty or From Here to Eternity, but Ernest Borgnine had no problem, that I could hear, adopting a Russian accent and handling his lines, with conviction.  This picture must be a lot older than one might at first think, because all three of the top players have been deceased for some time.

394120,4,6301969413,"ICE STATION ZEBRA is based on the Alistair Maclean novel. Its fans include reclusive billionaire Howard Hughes and director John Carpenter (HALLOWEEN, THE THING).
It was originally supposed to star Gregory Peck and David Niven who had starred in THE GUNS OF NAVARONE which was also based on an Alistair MacLean novel, but due to lengthy script rewrites, when the movie was ready for filming, Peck and Niven were involved in other movies, so their roles were given to Rock Hudson and Patrick McGoohan. The director was John Sturges (THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, THE GREAT ESCAPE). The impressive score was composed by Michel Legrand (THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG, THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR). The screenplay was written by Douglas Heyes, who may be better known as the director of nine THE TWILIGHT ZONE episodes including two classics, ""Eye of the Beholder"" and ""The Invaders"".
The first half of the movie involving the submarine's voyage to Ice Station Zebra at the North Pole, with its intriguing plot and its impressive Oscar-nominated special effects, is enjoyable to watch. However, the second half, when the submarine reaches the North Pole, is somewhat of a disappointment because of the fake-looking North Pole stage and disappointing ending (which reminded me of the ending to RAISE THE TITANIC).
I have ICE STATION ZEBRA on Blu-ray and dvd. The dvd's video quality is very good. If you're a big fan of the movie, I recommend the Blu-ray which provides increased video detail for added enjoyment.
One obvious mistake in the movie involves the jets over Ice Station Zebra---the Soviet jets are MiG-21 Fishbeds from the front, but when they're shown from the rear, they're US F-4 Phantoms. Ironically, the MiG-21s and F-4 Phantoms fought against each other over North Vietnam.

In its dopey and predictable way it's quite entertaining - and one of the sequences, involving a malfunctioning torpedo tube, is heart-pounding. Based on a best-selling thriller by Alistair MacLean, the plot concerns the errant mission of an early spy satellite. Back then such spacecraft took reconnaissance photos on rolls of film and then ejected canisters that drifted back to Earth, where either U.S. or Soviet Union operatives would have to retrieve them. But in this story a Russian canister veers off course and ends up near a British polar ""weather"" station. Soon contact is lost with the station and a U.S. Navy submarine is dispatched on a secret mission to investigate and recover the canister. Of course there are many complications, double-crosses, confrontations and crises, but all-in-all it's not bad fluff. With Rock Hudson as the stiff and formal submarine commander, former football great Jim Brown as an SOB of a commando, Patrick McGoohan (star of the British TV series ""Secret Agent"") as an even bigger SOB of a ... secret agent, and Ernest Borgnine as a former Russian agent - whose accent borders on the ridiculous - now supposedly working for us.

Partially based on a true story, a Russian spy satellite crash lands in the Arctic and the race is on to retrieve its valuable information. The U.S. sends a crack nuclear submarine team into the wild, led by Captain Rock Hudson. He's forced to take on a trio of mysterious passengers including a cynical British spy (Patrick McGoohan), a sympathetic Russian (Ernest Borgnine) and a hard-nosed Marine (Jim Brown). They must travel beneath the ice and break through near the target. En route, someone is attempting to sabotage the mission. This sounds exciting, but it lumbers with the speed of a glacier.

John Sturges, nearing the end of a spectacular career (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Great-Escape/dp/B000IZZS5O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Great Escape</a>), directed what could very well be his worst film. At best with outdoor heroics, he appears trapped like, well, a man in a submarine. When the crew breaks through the ice and dons parkas to hike to the satellite's wintery perch, it's apparent the Arctic landscape is filmed entirely on a set. Compare these unconvincing scenes to Howard Hawks' 1951 classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Thing-from-Another-World/dp/B00009NHC0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Thing from Another World</a>. That film also took place within the drifts of the deadly Arctic, but Hawks had the creative sense to film exteriors in Montana and interiors in a large industrial refrigerator. Quite simply, Kenneth Tobey and crew were freezing, and you could see the breath in front of their faces. You'll get no such authenticity in ""Ice Station Zebra,"" where blocks of ice are as menacing as cardboard boxes.

Hudson was also nearing the end of a successful movie career, where he would soon evolve into a television actor. ""Ice Station Zebra"" would be one of his last roles in a big-budget production. A likable comedic presence (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Man-s-Favorite-Sport/dp/B00009IB1F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Man's Favorite Sport?</a>), he was fresh off his greatest performance in the dark 1966 classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seconds-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B00CUKTGEE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seconds (Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray</a>]. This film does him no favors, where he's given little to do but pose. It's a shame. When forced, Rock could deliver the goods as he did so many years ago on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Giant/dp/B000WZUT18/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Giant</a>&nbsp;plains of Marfa, Texas. Brown is also given a one-note character and completely disappears into the scenery. McGoohan steals the film, chomping a cigarillo while bringing a dark intensity to his character the rest of the film lacks.

Today, ""Ice Station Zebra"" is perhaps best known as being Howard Hughes' favorite film. A reclusive, obsessive-compulsive during his final years, he reportedly watched this over 100 times. What exactly did he see in this work? I don't have a clue, with the exception the story is gadget-heavy, paying uncomfortably long attention to the details of the nuclear submarine. Hughes was a great airplane designer and pilot before sickness overtook him. Perhaps the incessant submarine detail was of interest. Or maybe it was a cure for insomnia.",1374537600,2,4800,7.242268041237113

394269,4,6301969413,"When you hear the term ""adventure film"", what comes to mind? For me, it's ""Ice Station Zebra"". This is a movie about a submarine, its captain, crew and a collection of interesting, if mysterious, passengers on an undisclosed top secret mission during the height of the cold war. But mostly it's a film about a submarine. The mission and passengers are all interesting enough, but the thing that I found the most fascinating is the way the film introduces and explains each area of the nuclear sub.

Frequently filmmakers seem compelled to tell adventure stories by concentrating on what goes wrong during a mission (i.e. the spaceship is hit by a meteor and is leaking air, the aircraft is losing fuel midway across the Atlantic, the train has no breaks, etc). While these scenarios are good for building drama and tension, I suppose, isn't it more interesting (especially in the case of a high tech nuclear sub or a spaceship) to see what goes right? For instance, what is day to day life like on a nuclear submarine? How does a it break through heavy ice when surfacing in frozen waters? What are the different stations on board, specifically? What do the officers and crewmen do at them? How is sonar used to navigate? What other cool technologies are aboard - how do they work, why are they there? I mean, watching a crew scramble to plug up an air leak or put out a fire were probably interesting scenes the first hundred times I saw them in movies, but I find them a bit mind-numbing by now. Most films with high-tech crafts never bother showing anything about them beyond simply being filled with people who walk around, man stations and look at blink-y lights (true, this is easier to write than are scenes that require technical research, imagination, and exposition).

So, if you want to watch an intelligent and compelling adventure film that isn't a cartoon like most adventure movies, then check out ""Ice Station Zebra"" and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.",1371340800,,1976,4.741279069767442

394412,5,6301969413,"Ice Station Zebra is a film made on the exciting novel written by Alistair MacLean. It covers the cold war period of the late nineteen sixties. The story is about a spy satellite orbiting in the atmosphere and then parachuting to a place in the Arctic near Greenland. This is observed both by Russia and the United States of America. A figure in a hood struggles through the ice storm and retrieves the capsule. He is not aware that he is being watched by another person who is hidden nearby. Soon,  the world hears that Drift Ice Station Z has met with a disaster as a weather station at the North Pole.
Nuclear submarine, Tigerfish, commanded by James Ferraday (Rock Hudson) is sent from Scotland to be tried out as a rescue mission. He is asked to take a band of marines and a mysterious British passenger called David Jones (Patrick McGoohan) along with a Russian defector, Boris Vaslov (Ernest Borgnine).
This tale is about how the submarine manages to break through the ice caps at Drift Ice Station Z (Zebra)(Previously the expansion codes for the letter Z were Zebra as they are Zulu today). There are several mishaps. There is sabotage involved.
Once they manage to break through the ice caps, they find the weather station in a wrecked state with very few survivors. Jones is looking for the capsule. There is a twist in store for the viewers here as to who is looking for what and whom. The Russian defector Vaslov plays an important part. The climax is quite exciting with Russian and American warplanes joining the party at Zebra. Captain Ferraday saves the day with his quick thinking. They are all after the capsule as it contains photographs of the locations of American missile bases that are taken from a British satellite that is stolen by the Russians.
The film has been directed by John Sturges and it was released in October 1968 using the 70mm Panorama Lens and six-track stereophonic sound effects. The background music score is excellent by Michel LeGrand.
This is good movie experience as the cinematography and the exciting musical score draw you into the film. The story moves at a decent pace with intelligent dialogues keeping you well engrossed.",1359763200,,2176,4.756613756613756

Of course, my personal judgement relies on a hi-def 55"" LCD, perhaps those with a front projector and larger screens could appreciate it much better.

As for the Blu-Ray disc itself, while it has no special features that were not on the standard DVD, I feel vindicated in upgrading from the standard-definition disc. Whether or not Warner Home Video (the cream of the mass-market crop) did entirely new scans or not, the clarity and presence of the image are palpably superior to the standard-definition one, which in itself was nothing at which to sneeze. There is some cloudiness in the underwater footage, although it remains superior to all other submarine model work in films because director John Sturges used an independently moving camera to track the sub's passage through the ice. Hollywood's preference for a locked-down camera when shooting model work rarely yields results this convincing. Even on flat screen, the immediacy of foreground figures in Sturges' compositions, especially in the command center of the submarine, translates to Blu-Ray with an impressive illusion of Cinerama wraparound.

394547,4,6301969413,"1968's ""Ice Station Zebra"" is a dramatization of the Alistair Maclean novel of the same name.  Its premise is the launching of an American nuclear attack submarine under the Arctic ice cap, loaded with Marines and two spies, one British, the other Russian.  Their objective is to rescue the crew of a drift ice science station, which has been damaged by fire.  In reality, they hope to retrieve a film capsule dropped from a satellite near Ice Station Zebra before the Soviets can get it.

The cast was headlined by a number of prominent actors, including Rock Hudson as the commander of the USS TIGERFISH, Jim Brown as the leader of the Marines, Patrick McGoohan as a British intelligence officer, and Earnest Borgnine as a Russian spy who has defected to the West.  The plot is rather convoluted and involves multiple betrayals and a dramatic confrontation with the Soviets on the ice.  The ending is perhaps unexpected.  The cinematography and special effects have held up pretty well.

""Ice Station Zebra"" is still a decent action thriller of the Cold War genre, although it is not as good as MacLean's original novel, which featured a tense but coherent plot, an heroic American submarine crew, and a cunning but differently motivated hero.

394549,5,6301969413,"I'm not going to repeat the positive accolades afforded this ""classic"" Cold War thriller by other reviews. I only wish to give a litle informed background info on the submarine. The fictional ""USS Tigerfish""(SSN 509),is a Skate class SSN. This class represented the U.S. Navy's first production nuclear fast attack sub based on the USS Nautilus,(SSN 571) prototype still using a  more traditional (and imho),a very beautiful hull form designed and based on the highly advanced German Type XXI U-Boat. This class included USS Skate (SSN 578),USS Swordfish (SSN 579),USS Sargo (SSN 583) and USS Seadragon (SSN 584).

USS Skate (SSN-578), the third submarine in the US Navy to be named for the skate, a type of ray, was the lead ship of the Skate class of nuclear submarines. She was the third nuclear submarine commissioned, the first to make a completely submerged trans-Atlantic crossing and the second submarine to transit the North Pole and the first to surface there.
The contract to build her was awarded to the Electric Boat division of General Dynamics on 18 July 1955, and her keel was laid in Groton, Connecticut on 21 July 1955. She was launched on 16 May 1957 This class was heavily involved in the U.S. Navy's early Arctic under-ice explorations and efforts in the late 50's and into the 60's. All were excellent sea-boats and were on active duty,serving for for several decades. The Skate,known effectionately as the ""Arctic Warrior"",served from 1957 until her decommissioning in 1986..almost 30 yrs!

NOTE: all of the surface ""live action"" sub scenes are NOT of a Skate class SSN. They are of the diesel/electric sub the USS Ronquil, which was a converted (late GUPPY IIA) WWII fleetboat of the Balao class. While the bow is shaped similarly to the Skate class (in the conversion), close observation reveals no vertical tail fin at the stern which would be visible in the surface scenes and the bow planes on the Skate retract in to the hull when not used. The special effects model does (of course) have the vertical tail fin visible in the scene when they arrive at the ice barrier.",1336003200,3,2097,4.868347338935574
394550,5,6301969413,"The sixties produced some edge-of-your-seat Cold War flicks like Fail Safe, The Bedford Incident and Ice Station Zebra. As an earlier reviewer wrote, there's something about this movie that grabs you.  Even my wife, who's totally uninterested in movies like this, will watch it.  Why does it work?  First, the acting is good. All main stars do a great job with standouts Hudson and McGoohan.  Though a long movie (intermissions were common in fifties and sixties movies) it is paced well and oscillates crisply  between scenes of suspense, action and one-on-one scenes between the players. A first class editing job.  The scene where the submarine is sabotaged and nearly sinks is terrifically done.  I saw this movie in a theatre when it first ran and was blown away by the big sound effects. The crushing ice flows, the roaring of the fighter planes, the whine of the submarine turbines. It all makes for a powerful impact.  I can see why Howard Hughes played it over and over.  When is it coming out in BluRay??",1332979200,3,1014,4.781609195402299

394552,4,6301969413,"""Ice Station Zebra"" is a good, solid drama but gets more than three stars only because of the acting. The film is different than the novel, which was written by Alistair MacLean, and MacLean was a better writer than 99 percent of Hollywood hacks. MacLean's novel makes sense but many parts of this movie don't. In the novel there is no traitor on the ship. In the movie there is, but what I assume was added to create suspense just created incoherency. The ending is different in the film, reflecting, one assumes, the leftwing politics of Hollywood. (The U.S. shouldn't be allowed to win a Cold War battle. Has to be a draw.)
  However, the acting is superb, led by the magnificent Patrick McGoohan, who has any number of noteworthy lines. Even the silly ones sound sensible when McGoohan says them. Excellent theme too.

The acting is first-rate.  I was never a fan of Rock Hudson, but was very pleasantly surprised at his performance in this movie.  However, Patrick McGoohan, one of my favorite actors, stole this movie. His character was so calm cool and collected until that great scene in which he explodes with a diatribe that ends with ""Just get me there!"" The way McGoohan delivers those lines is superb.

It's also a movie that keeps one guessing about who the good guys are, and the final showdown is a nail biter. I don't think I took a breath until it was over.

I saw where someone said it's a good ""guy movie,"" but it's also a great movie for us females who like a well-written, well-acted and well-directed movie, even an action-adventure one.

I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to see what a really good movie looks like.",1297468800,5,846,4.496732026143791

394617,4,6301969413,"I liked this movie so much that after seeing it, I bought the Alistair MacLean book of the same title -- and couldn't make heads or tails of it: It sure was totally different from the movie; about the only thing that was the same was the sub, and the polar ice station.
The two reasons I wouldn't give this one the full five stars are (1) the polar scenes were sort of unrealistic; one could envision the set carpenters cutting,  glueing, and spray-painting the pieces of plywood to form snow-covered ice  boulders, and (2) Jim Brown hadn't learned to act; he was stiff as a poker -- although, in all fairness, his role was by and large a rather thankless one.
The rest of it held up from start to finish; nerve-racking suspense; great undersea scenes and special effects with the sub threatened after someone aboard sabotaged it.  A superb, magnificent score (I can't think of enough great adjectives for that) by Michel LeGrand.
McGoohan is perfect -- totally believable in his role as a British agent; Borgnine overacts, sometimes irritatingly so, but part of that is the character he plays (even the commander found him irritating occasionally), and Rock Hudson is Mr. Cool -- just the kind of guy you'd want commanding such a mission.  Although how his six foot five inches could fit into the confines of a crowded submarine, I don't know.  But one willingly suspends disbelief.  Hudson is such a much better actor that he was given credit for being during his lifetime -- I'd willingly sit and watch him read the phonebook.  Hard to believe that any one man could be that impossibly good-looking.  But he was.
Memorable lines:  When the young Marine lieutenant, obviously a bit nervous about being in such close proximity with a bunch of torpedos stacked next to the bunks, asks Hudson if the torpedos have nuclear warheads, Hudson reassures him that they don't; they're merely Torpex, he says, and each torpedo has no more destructive power than about 400 pounds of TNT.  When the lieutenant tells Hudson that neither he nor his men have ever been on board a submarine before, Hudson's response is, ""Rest easy; I have.""  And the viewer believes him.

394619,3,6301969413,"With such an assembly of actors and a director who knew his stuff, I honestly expected more from a film taken from a great book, but sadly it didn't do the book or the cast justice.

Where was the exciting fire aboard the submarine after the rescue? It had gone. Instead we had a company of Russian troops being parachuted down to confront a company of US Marines who had been carried on the submarine to the Ice Station (neither the Russian or the American troops had been in the book) and to me it seemed the show-down between the two sides was as frustrating as the storyline; great potential but nothing really happened - it was like opening a huge box of a present and finding a tiny uninteresting object inside.

It would have been better to dispense with the pointless confrontation between the two armies and concentrate on the story of why secret agents from the UK and Soviet Union were there anyway. What about the characters of the Ice Station? Almost ignored and passed over, they were just names, yet Ernest Borgnine and Patrick McGoohan knew each by name, and as these two guys were spies it stood to reason the blokes on the Ice Station were also spies or at least in cahoots, and would have known something.

Too much made of making it like a Cold War stand off and not enough injected into it of a man hunt between the protagonist and antagonist. We had a brief flash at the end but by then I'd lost interest and couldn't care who was what or what happened to them.",1270771200,2,1483,4.405109489051095
394620,2,6301969413,"I enjoyed and admired Alistair MacLean's book _Ice Station Zebra_ (which I have reviewed at my site AlistairMacLean.com, along with all his other novels). Wish I could say the same for the movie.

One quibble is with the acting. Rock Hudson acquitted himself well as the submarine commander, but Patrick McGoohan alternated strangely between mystery and buffoonery; Ernest Borgnine was a bad parody of a Russian; and Jim Brown looked like a football player trying to act.

The weird musical interruptions at the start and at ""Intermission"" time were a jarring note. So were the bad special effects trying to show Soviet jet fighters zooming around.

Worst of all, though, was the desecration of Alistair MacLean's original plot. That one had long sequences of mysterious action, intelligence operations, and the good and bad guys trying to stay a step ahead of each other. The movie plot introduces two new goofy major characters (played by Borgnine & Brown), as well as an unrealistic confrontation between US/British and Soviet forces.

Some other film versions of MacLean thrillers, such as _The Guns of Navarone_ and _Where Eagles Dare_, are well worth watching. The film version of _Ice Station Zebra_ left me, in a word, cold.",1269043200,3,1232,5.084158415841584

I saw it at its original reserved-seat run at the Cinerama theater on Broadway in New York and have watched it numerous times since then (although not as much as Hughes.)
The name Alistair MacLean is not that well-remembered today.  However he was the king of action novelists during the 1950s and '60s.  Many of his books were made into films, the most famous being ""The Guns of Navarone"" and its sequel ""Force 10 from Navarone,"" ""Where Eagles Dare,"" ""Breakheart Pass"" and this film.  This film was supposed to re-unite his Navarone stars, Gregory Pack and David Niven.  However when shooting started, they were no longer available.  Instead we got Rock Hudson, Ernest Borgnine and Patrick McGoohan.  Hudson and Borgnine are fine but it is McGoohan who steals the film as a British secret agent named ""Jones"" who is very similar to his John Drake ""Secret Agent"" TV persona. There are no female members of the cast.
The first half of the film involves the U.S. submarine's voyage under the polar ice pack to get to Zebra.  It includes a terrifically suspenseful scene of a saboteur's attempt to flood the submarine while under the pack.  The second half involves the locating of Zebra culminating in the U.S./Russian confrontation at the detroyed station for the secret of Ice Station Zebra.
Directed by the great John Sturges, (The Great Escape, Magnificent 7, etc.)  this is an exciting and suspenseful film.  It features a great score by Michel Legrand and fine special effects of the submarine journeying under the polar ice pack (great on the big screen.)It lost the special effects Oscar to 2001.  The DVD features the overture, intermission music and music for exiting the theater.
Unfortunately the DVD only includes some vintage short subjects from the time the film was made.  It would have been very nice for a retrospective on this fine film.  While Hudson and Sturges are long-gone, McGoohan was alive until recently and Borgnine, Jim Brown (who basically stands around looking angry the entire film,) and Tony Bill are still alive.

394688,5,6301969413,"Join the avant-garde composers, Soviet politburo members, and eccentric millionaires who compulsively watch this movie over and over again because it is the single best movie ever made.  It has the perfect formula:  Submarines + Ice + Rockets + Patrick McGoohan + More Spies + Stunning Landscapes + Ernest Borgnine.  Plus a moral too!  And the most beautiful photography in any spy movie.

McGoohan is fantastic -- playing his standard type of character, but smoother than the original Danger Man, and not as paranoia-inducing as The Prisoner.  And I'll tell you, I had to stop watching the Prisoner, not because I got too paranoid, but because I should have been more paranoid about the REAL dangers around me, and not puzzling over cute philosophical problems of identity.

One recent review here calls it a ""guy movie.""  Now I'm not sure if that's true, but in my experience I HAVE found women not to appreciate it as much as men.  Yet it isn't crass or trivial like other great guy movies.  It might be -- and I'm sure this isn't ""politically correct"" -- that women don't see as stark a divide between being the good guy and being the bad guy, between honesty and treachery.  Maybe for good reason!  Maybe being put in a bind all the time means you need to be a bit more flexible.

But the key spy-hunt aspect left all my women-friends that I watched it with cold.  This is even true for the last one who -- honest to goodness -- basically was a spy.  How could a woman who was ""dating"" me as part of her private investigation business (or partnership, she worked with three others) as a way to get (successfully) incriminating evidence -- how could she fail to get worked up as the noose closes on the TRUE Russian spy?  She fell asleep on the couch.  Whereas even though I've  watched it at least 50 times, my heart pounds anew in the same places.  It's that good a movie.

This movie from the late 1960s is based in the Cold War conflict and has both the spy game as well as a submarine under the polar ice cap.  The movie spends almost too much time in the submarine and not enough at the ice station, but given the race to complete their objectives, this is probably more realistic.

Rock Hudson and Patrick McGoohan play their roles well and have the dialogue available to explore their roles.  Jim Brown is well suited to his role, but he wasn't given enough to fully show his ability.  Ernest Borgnine played the Russian defector, but his beret and accent made it difficult to see him as Russian.

394759,3,6301969413,"Partial spoiler below, but of the original novel, not the movie. ******** I will be the first to admit that the first half of ""Ice Station Zebra"" is a damn near perfect film adaptation of the first third of one of the greatest suspense and adventures novels ever written. The casting is perfect, the performances are dead on, and the screen play includes the major plot points and the important sequences from the ""Dolphin's"" trip from its base in Scotland to the Arctic Ice Pack. The torpedo tube sabotage that nearly sinks the ""Dolphin"" in particular, has got to be one of the most gripping and intense ""submarine crisis"" sequences EVER filmed.

However, for the 2/3rds of the film (after the ""Dolphin"" has arrived at the Ice Station) the film-makers decided that they couldn't trust the source material and veered away from much of what made the novel so great. Don't get me wrong, the story they chose to film is still a pretty good adventure and suspense tale, it just wasn't ""Ice Station Zebra"". What made the novel so great was the powerful depiction of the cross country trek Carpenter and two of the crew are forced to make to reach the survivors while the ""Dolphin"" searches for thinner ice to break through closer to the wrecked station. And following this epic struggle, as the sub journeyed back under the ice pack with the survivors of the disaster the novel becomes a ""whodunit"". Carpenter queries the survivors in attempt to find the spy (or traitor) in their ranks who started the fire and killed several members of the station crew even before he set the fire. And people start getting their skulls cracked open as the spy lurks about the ship as Carpenter plays cat-and-mouse with him. And then there is an amazing plot turn as the spy sabotages the nuclear reactor with a fire UNDER THE ICE and the crew must race to defeat a monstrous blaze before they asphyxiate. And the final plot twist and the abrupt reversal of fortune at the end, is one of the most clever and satisfying I have ever read.

Unfortunately, what we got instead in the movie was a bunch of people pointing assault rifles at each other in a fairly straightforward game of ""Brinksmanship"". Again, this was well done, but not NEARLY as intelligent and involving as the novel.

So, docked several points for not trusting the source material and going for the ""loud and obvious"" ending. But it is still a GREAT thriller.",1175299200,9,2406,4.669811320754717

394802,4,6301969413,"American and Soviet teams race toward the polar ice cap to rescue an ill-fated scientific expedition.  At least, that is the cover story.  A polar storm prevents an air operation, so the US Navy rushes a nuclear submarine to the spot.  In typical Allistar McClean fashion you expect to see sabotage and undercover undercover agents playing against one another.

In reality, the polar rescue is a secondary mission with both sides trying to recover a downed satellite film canister.

Rock Hudson fills the part perfectly as the submarine's captain.  Serious and rarely smiling, he is portrays the ideal naval officer.  By the time the film premiered, the audience was already familiar with actor Patrick McGoohan from his role in SECRET AGENT MAN/DANGER MAN and the only recently televised THE PRISONER.  In fact, his portrayal of a British secret agent is little different then the character we came to know on television.

Jim Brown and Ernest Borgnine complete the cast.  The sole miscasting of this film was Borgnine as Russian agent Vaslov.  In the 1960s we all came to recognize Borgnine as Commander Quinton McHale in MCHALE'S NAVY.  He just doesn't seem fit the role of a Russian -- and his accent is horrible.

ICE STATION ZEBRA was the ""Das Boot"" of its era.  Expect all the usual submarine antics to include some very good second unit photography and underwater special effects.  The surface polar ice set is somewhat exaggerated (more appropriate for an Irwin Allen television production) and the confrontation between the sub captain and Soviet paratroop commander runs a little long, but overall this is a great film to watch.

ICE STATION ZEBRA appeared on movie screens at the height of military activity in Vietnam in the late 1960s.  As such, the US Navy nervously withdrew permission for director John Sturges (The Great Escape) to film a single frame aboard a real nuclear submarine.  A traditional diesel sub was substituted.  In some of the aerial shots of the sub on the surface you will see that the ""nuclear"" submarine has a traditional shark-nose bow.  The interior submarine set is fantastic.

The complete soundtrack to the film has also been recently re-released after years of being available as an import only.  It is the perfect soundtrack if you are driving by the water or cruising through heavy snow flurries.

Great film at a great price.  For those of you who are THE PRISONER fans, this movie is traditionally viewed as Number 6's (Patrick McGoohan) last mission before he was taken to the village.",1153008000,,2535,4.938534278959811

Most notably, it is overlong and suffers from a wooden performance by Rock Hudson, who is stiffer than the ice floes at the North Pole.  Shoddy special effects and sets also detract.  On the positive side, performances by Patrick McGoohan and Ernest Borgnine were well worth watching.  One comes away wishing McGoohan, best known for his television work as ""The Prisoner"" and ""Secret Agent"" (AKA ""Danger Man""), had been in more films.",1152057600,6,524,4.788888888888889
394804,4,6301969413,"Based on the Alistair MacLean Cold war thriller, ""Ice Station Zebra"" is an above average military and espionage drama with significant submarine footage.

An all male cast features Rock Hudson playing U.S. nuclear sub captain Commander Ferraday who has been ordered to transport secretive British spy David Jones played by the mellifluously tongued Patrick MacGoohan to Ice Station Zebra.  Ice Station Zebra a remote North Pole weather station has been transmitting an SOS signal.  Along the way the sub picks up imposing no nonsense Marine captain Jim Brown and friendly Russian spy Boris Vaslov played by Ernest Borgnine.

They carefully navigate their way under the polar ice cap, surfacing by cracking through the icy crust three miles away from the weather station.  Creeping their way through a howling Arctic ice storm the U.S. team finally arrives at the fire decimated Ice Station Zebra.  Once there Hudson manages to learn that the reason for the mission is to procure a sensitive bit of film that was contained within a downed Russian satellite.  The film contains information containing the location of all U.S. missile installations and due to an aberrant orbit also reveals the location of Soviet missile locations.  As expected the Russians have also sent a team to the Pole to recover the film.  A stalemate ensues between the opposing forces in the remote and icy confines of the North Pole.

The John Sturges directed flick while short on action and about 15-20 minutes too long does a decent job in chronicling the chess match between the two superpowers during this pivotal era of the Cold War.",1144454400,,1614,5.033834586466165
394805,4,6301969413,"This is a 5 star for a 1968 movie and a 4 star our present time and technology.

I was 13 years old when I saw ICE STATION ZEBRA in a movie theatre back in 1968. At that time and like any other kid I expected a submarine war action movie; in return it was a half submarine picture and a half spy story which, at that time, I hardly understood; yet I was fascinated by it.

I watched this movie again and I am not surprised that this movie fascinated me years back.

The submarine footage on and below the surface is excellent; the dialogue and the plot including the acting and the visual effects are way better that any other 35 year old movie I have seen.

In general this is a great movie to watch or own. Well recommended.",1143417600,4,726,4.091549295774648
394806,1,6301969413,"I loved this movie when I was a kid. I bought it out of nostalgia, and regretted it. The movie may have been good for its time, but it is just bad now.  Rock Hudson gives a not-believable performance as a Sub Commander, and the bad guys are sterotypes.",1139270400,4,252,4.142857142857143
394807,5,6301969413,"A team of American marines and naval personnel aboard a nuclear submarine are ordered to a tiny observation camp on the ice near the North Pole. The Americans have been receiving distress signals from the camp but cannot reach anyone by radio. What at first appears to be a simple rescue mission changes dramatically when the sub picks up a British secret agent and a Russian double-agent as passengers. The nuclear submarine races to the camp when the true mission is disclosed and word reaches them that the Soviets are also heading to the pole by jet to recover a spy satellite.

The cast is awesome and their acting really stands the test of time. Rock Hudson is superb as the mission's leader Submarine Commander Ferraday; Patrick McGoohan is excellent as the evasive and secretive British secret agent; Jim Brown is outstanding as the tough American Marine Captain; and even Ernest Borgnine is believable as oddball Russian expatriate Boris Vaslov (although I kept thinking of him driving a cab for Snake Plisken). Director John Sturges had the technical language of the crew aboard the sub carefully screened for accuracy to increase the sense of reality in the film. Although the special effects were cutting edge for 1968, they may seem a bit fake to current audiences. And for trivia buffs -- Ice Station Zebra was the favorite movie of billionaire Howard Hughes, who would watched it fanatically in his Desert Inn hotel room.

I recommend this movie for a couple of reasons. First, it is a well done film with top shelf acting and character development. The plot is great and you won't be disappointed by the ending. Second, this is an excellent example of the workings of espionage during the Cold War years. It's a good movie to show the younger generation when they ask questions about the Cold War. But honestly, it's a great suspense movie with spies, traitors, jets,  paratroopers and a nuke sub.",1132617600,6,1913,4.844036697247707

As was pointed out in the film, the Soviets used their German scientists to launch the satellite containing the camera stolen from England's German scientists using a special film developed by the US's German scientists. The film has the location of both side's missile installations and both sides want it. Neither side will give an inch.

The chase takes place with a US nuclear sub, overcrowded by marines and spies. The problem is that there is a double agent on board who will give up his own life to sabotage the mission. The twists and turns don't stop and neither does the excitement. The film is dated but still a good show. The photography especially is spectacular, especially for that day and age.

Rock Hudson leads an all star cast which does a great job across the board.",1129766400,9,915,4.573170731707317
394809,5,6301969413,"This movie has a strong star name cast - Patrick McGoohan, Ernest Borgnine, Rock Hudson and Jim Brown.  McGoohan is brilliant as ever.  A perfectionist of an actor, he once again is play a Brit super-spy (Secret Agent, Prisoner).  It's a role he is comfortable with and he brings his subtle, yet incisive touches to conjur this character alive.  Borgnine, never gives less than 110% to a role is perfect at the anti-Russian Russian.  Brown to fierce as the man no one really likes and suspects he might be more than he pretends.  Hudson is the weakest link.  His lines were written to come out of an actor with the same power and presence as McGoohan and Borgnine - Robert Mitchum.  Had Mitchum played the role this movie would have been dead on target.  Against McGoohan and Borgnine, Hudson shows he had all the range from A-B.  In the very dramatic scene where McGoohan is telling how to wreck a sub, he is dead on perfect - every word every gesture.  Hudson gives his rebuttal and comes across as trying to echo McGoohan's strength.  Mitchum could have looked McGoohan in the eye and it would have been a long staring contest before either blinked!

It's a race to the North Pole to reach a weather station that has gone out of contact after a camera that contained spy film lands there.  You have the Russians rushes to reach there, and the US group with their multinational spies trying to make it there first.

394811,4,6301969413,"One of the better cold war dramas produced during the 60's, ""Ice Station Zebra"" isn't exactly an action adventure; it's more of an action drama. Most of the ""action"" is the dramatic conflict between Commander Ferraday (Rock Hudson) and his guests Boris Vaslov (Ernest Borgnine)a former Russian spy who now works for British Intelligence, MI-6 secret agent ""David Jones"" (the wonderful Patrick McGoohan) and Marine Captain Anders (Jim Brown). A nasty ice storm brews at the North Pole. When Ice Station Zebra calls for help the Tigerfish is sent north to break through the ice to save the men stationed there. That's the cover story. The reality is that a satellite has crashed in the arctic tundra and must be recovered before a Russian expeditition gets to it.

The image quality is stellar on this first time release from Warner Brothers. There's hardly any analog or digital artifacts. While there's no commentary track we do get the original promotional featurette on the movie ""The Man Who Makes a Difference"" and it's actually pretty good at providing behind-the-scenes footage about the shooting of a real Navy submarine to be integrated with visual effects into the movie. The big attraction here is a wonderful 5.1 remix of the original soundtrack. While it's not as active as, say, a brand new movie, it sounds pretty darn good with better depth and expanded sound than any previous incarnation of the movie on home video.

This was originally shot in SuperPanavision and, atlhough this is a widescreen presentation much like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". It's a huge improvement on the previously cropped versions that have floated around. The original Overture from the roadshow edition of the movie has been restored to this version with Michel Legrand's marvelous score. The intermission is also included, hence the 2 hour and 30 minute running time.

Patrick McGoohan took time away from shooting his series ""The Prisoner"" to make ""Ice Station Zebra"". Ironically he plays another secret agent. ""David Jones"" doesn't stray too far from John Drake the character he played in ""Secret Agent Man"" (aka ""Danger Man in the UK)but McGoohan's clipped sarcastic delivery and unpredictabllity make him a stand out in the cast. Hudson's relaxed performance as the Commander provides a nice counter balance to McGoohan's intense one and provides a nice counter point to Borgnine's cagey Vaslov. The first half of the film is marvelous and, although it sags during the second half (for a lot of reasons) and the conclusion doesn't have the cinematic style of John Sturges' previous films (""The Great Escape"" and ""The Magnificent Seven"")but, all in all, ""Ice Station Zebra"" still provides marvelous entertainment. The footage of the real submarine surfacing and going under the water looks marvelous.

Nominated for two Academy Awards (Best Cinematography and Best Special Visual Effects), ""Ice Station Zebra"" lost in both categories to ""Romeo and Juliet"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". The visual effects that open the movie are still exceptionally good and wouldn't look out of place in Kubrick's film of the same year. That's ironic since MGM pulled ""2001"" from some theaters to premiere ""Ice Station Zebra"".",1112313600,50,3204,5.132183908045977
394852,4,6301969413,"Released in 1968, ""Ice Station Zebra"" remains an engrossing, suspenseful thriller, well directed by John Sturges. With films like ""The Magnificent Seven"" and ""The Great Escape"" to his credit, you know that any movie directed by Mr. Sturges is going to hold your attention, even if--in this case--it clocks in at over two and a half hours.

The titular station is a weather outpost located close to the North Pole. Something has gone terribly wrong there, and an American nuclear submarine is sent on an urgent rescue mission. Nasty Arctic weather--and the polar ice cap--will not allow any other means of transport to reach ""Zebra"". Of course, there is a more sinister agenda here than trying to save the lives of a few stranded scientists. This is why the submarine has two espionage ""experts"" on board--one British and one Russian--as well as a platoon of marines.

Rock Hudson stars as the sub captain. While this role does not challenge Mr. Hudson's acting abilities, he is appropriately fearless and stalwart in the face of danger. Ernest Borgnine is our Russian secret service agent, working for the ""West"" as a ""good Russian""--or is he ? Mr. Borgnine is a good actor, and after the first few scenes, I found myself accepting him in this role. Jim Brown is the tough-as-nails marine leader. I would never call him a great actor, but Mr. Brown is certainly convincing as someone nobody wants to annoy ! Real acting honours in this movie go to Patrick McGoohan as the British ""agent"". Fondly remembered for his sixties TV series ""Danger Man"" ( aka Secret Agent ) and ""The Prisoner"", it will always be a mystery to me why Mr. McGoohan did not choose to make a greater number of films and become a huge star. Frankly, for me at least, he steals the film.

The colour, widescreen picture is excellent, as is the sound for a 36-year old film. While some of the arctic action clearly takes place in the studio, I was impressed with the submarine footage, and once you are under the ice cap, you can really feel the tension. Yes--it's a submarine film--things do indeed ""go wrong"" !

Ladies--while my wife did enjoy ""Ice Station Zebra"", she did confirm that this is a ""guy movie"" ! In fact, there are no women in the cast at all. If you are looking for romance, this is not the place !

It is not clear to me why Howard Hughes would want to watch this film hundreds of times, but is it a coincidence that this DVD starts with a trailer for ""The Aviator"" ? I don't think so.
The disc includes a few other trailers, and an interesting short on one of ""Zebra's"" cameramen who helped to pioneer action film photography--fascinating.

I suppose the West vs. Soviet ""cold war"" scenario is dated--in 2005, international tensions are much more complicated--but ""Ice Station Zebra"" still delivers a tense, exciting story, and this DVD was worth the wait. Recommended.

A very sad footnote, dated 15 January 2009--Mr. Patrick McGoohan has passed away--another fine actor has left us.",1110585600,24,2971,4.7129094412331405
394853,4,6301969413,"I would rate this movie as 3.75 on the five star system. I found Ice Station Zebra to be quite an interesting and entertaining movie. A great cast led by Rock Hudson proves to be superb and fun to watch. The movie was adapted from the Alistair MacLean's novel. Guns of Navarone and Where Eagles Dare were both taken from MacLean's novels and both were great movies.

The Cold War situation really don't looked that dated to me. Its part of history. The script is well written and although the special effects on ice and snow appears to be bit cheesy by today's standards, it doesn't take away from gripping story about espionage, betrayal and secret microfilm. The photography was superbly done, even on the cheesy ice and snow area. Personally, I didn't see anything wrong with Ernest Borgnine playing a Russian, If Sean Connery can, why not him? I felt sorry for Jim Brown again, cutting a promising football career only to be killed off in movies. Patrick McGoohan was great and he and Hudson carried the load of the film.

The film became infamous when it was learned that it was Howard Hughes' favorite movie of all times but that shouldn't distract from the fact that its a pretty decent film. Its on my guilty pleasure list of films I like despite of some flaws. What some flaws? Well, the movie more closer to a drama, not action adventure as some folks may have thought. When I first saw this movie at the age of ten, even I could figured out that Ernest Borgnine may end up being a the bad guy. It was bit obvious. The ice and snow set were really pretty lame but it can be overlook. And for some of you guys out there, there is no female in this movie!! (All male cast.)

The DVD edition of this film proves to be quite good. The images are clear and crisp, the 5.1 DD works pretty decently although not very aggressively. There is a short documentary on the film and some trailers to watch. Definitely not much on the extras.",1107993600,13,1937,4.435393258426966

The film's plot is dated, but even with the fake sets and Hudson, something weird happens when watching it that makes it strangely compelling. It's hard to explain.

Films such as 2001:A Space Odyssey, Planet Of The Apes, Thunderbird 6, Romeo and Juliet, The Lost Continent, among the many. However, they were not as powerful as this Cinerama release. One that made reclusive billionaire Howard Hughes watch this movie over and over, without ever becoming bored. It is easy to understand why. Ice Station Zebra is also a favorite movie of mine, too.
Based on British novelist Alistar MacLean's classic Cold War action adventure/political thriller, the box office smash hit MGM film focuses on a downed Russian satellite in the Artic Circle region. A satellite that crashes near a British civilian weather research station known as Ice Station Zebra. The English scientists discover that the satellite contains film of Western power missile sites and other defense instillations. At the same time of the discovery, disaster hits the station in the form of explosive sabotage. Enter into the picture Captain James Ferraday and the crew of the United States Naval Submarine U.S.S. Tigerfish. Ferraday is given orders to bring British intelligence agent David Jones, former Russian agent turned defector Boris Vaslov, U.S. Marine Captain Leslie Anders and a platoon squad of Marine sharpshooters. While officially their mission is to rescue the scientists in the North Pole, unofficially, they are ordered to recover the satellite, obtain the film, and prevent it from falling into the hands of the Union Of The Soviet Socialistic Republic.
Not everything is all that it seems to be on the ""rescue mission."" The submarine is nearly destroyed by sabotage. When the Tigerfish arrives at Ice Station Zebra, it is soon discovered that there is a double agent among the crew and scientists. And this double agent is a madman who will stop at nothing to obtain the film and kill those who get in the way.
When both Anders and Vaslov are accidentally killed and a squad of Russian paratroopers arrive on the scene, it soon becomes a struggle to maintain the balance of world power, and prevent the Cold War from becoming a thermonuclear war between the United States of America and Soviet Russia.
Like The Guns Of Navarone, Force 10 From Navarone, and Bear Island, Ice Station Zebra is shockingly timely as tomorrow's headlines. The movie truly reflects the Cold War period of the late Sixties with powerful results. From the cold, deadly beauty of the world under the ice to the howling fury of an artic blizzard, the 1968 MGM film painstakingly records every twist and turn with upmost realism. It perfectly demonstrates how complex world politics and the balance of power can be, but most of all, it can demonstrate how something mass produced by either side can literally change the structure of our world.
If you enjoy action and adventure, as well technothrillers, cold war classics, science fiction, or just war movies in general, then you will not be disappointed by this classic form of entertainment. The race is on, so join the fun at Ice Station Zebra.
