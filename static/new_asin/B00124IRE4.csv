8243724,5,B00124IRE4,"My 11 month old had tried another signing DVD for about 5 weeks and we weren't getting anywhere.  She'd watch that one for about 5 minutes then lose interest, and learned no signs.  At the end of 5 weeks I gave up and bought this DVD.

By the 2nd viewing of this DVD, she had her versions of ""more"" and ""milk"" down.  I don't know what it is about this one -- the puppets, the music, the dolls or the children, or maybe even the low production values (more realistic, less stylized, no stock footage) but my daughter is interested immediately after it starts and watches the whole way through.

It's not a very long DVD (<20 mins) since there are only 6 signs, but honestly, that just means we can get through it while I'm making her dinner on a weeknight.",1303430400,,755,4.288732394366197
8243725,5,B00124IRE4,"The fact that this DVD has only six signs is actually a very good thing. Did you ever wonder why there rates of attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)are on the rise? There is good data based on research studies demonstating that exposure to TV programming with its fast moving immages and data overload in this young and a non-verbal age group is one of the causes of ADHD.
 Toddler's brains are different and a slower pace of this DVD with only 6 words is more developmentaly appropriate!  As a physician I strongly recommend this DVD!",1239148800,2,550,4.71875
8243726,1,B00124IRE4,"I understand that this is meant to be a beginning DVD, but I was unpleasantly surprised to see that there were a grand total of 6 signs (all of which the baby already knew) on this DVD.

Go for one of the other ASL based recordings that give more content like Baby See n' Sign (1 & 2)",1238544000,2,284,3.896551724137931

A great help for parents and care givers to understand their babies a lot better.  Would eliminate frustration in figuring out what the babies are trying to say to them.  I also liked the music very much.",1233532800,,333,4.15625

It is so helpful to teach your toddler some signs to help with communication when s/he is just learning speech.  I particularly enjoyed the cultural aspect - it really adds to the video.

This peaceful DVD brought moments of joy to our home and our baby communicating with us so well thanks to sign language.
