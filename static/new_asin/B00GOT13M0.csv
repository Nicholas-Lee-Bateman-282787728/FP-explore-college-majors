6096227,5,B00GOT13M0,"Fantastic show that reminds me a little bit of Firefly but much more alien mix to the crew as well as the enemies and inhabitants of the worlds. They do change a few common words such as Hour=Arn, Minute=Microt, and ill let you figure out frell. All in all I really love this show and it's characters.",1414022400,,301,4.298245614035087
