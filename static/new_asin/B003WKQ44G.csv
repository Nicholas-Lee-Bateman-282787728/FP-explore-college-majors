8407363,3,B003WKQ44G,"This documentary is shot well and narrated well, but leaves a lot of information up to question. The viewpoint of the filmmakers is clearly on the side of the poor of Kenya, and against the management of Dominion, the corporation that attempts to create a rice farm. A more balanced presentation of information would have made the film stronger.",1428537600,,345,4.864406779661017
8407364,4,B003WKQ44G,"Good Fortune (2009 release; 75 min.) is a documentary that looks at the potential negative side effects of international development aid. As  documentary opens, we are confronted/exposed to Kibera, a shantytown in Nairobi, Kenya. The US, in partnership with the Kenyan government, wants to demolish the shantytown and rebuild it. In a separate but parallel story line, we are introduced to the Yala Swamp, in Western Kenya, where an outfit called Dominion Farms, led by an American with too much time and money on his hands, wants to redo the entire area into rice farms. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, youll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, the documentary does a great job placing you, the view, in the middle of it. I have never been to Kenya and hence it is difficult for me to imagine what day-to-day life is like for people there. The shantytown footage is raw and shocking at times. Second, I don't claim to be an expert on international development and aid, but when you see how strongly the local people are resisting change, you have to wonder at what point you say fine and stop imposing your will. Third, the skepticism of the locals towards their own government is huge, and how could they not be, having been lied to time and again by their own politicians.

Bottom line: this documentary raises some pointed issues. At one point, we see the CEO Of Dominion Farms make a comment that this place is going to be a Garden of Eden someday, and the question is of course for whom?. This was originally broadcast on the P.O.V. series on PBS in 2009, and the DVD was released the next year. Definitely worth checking out!",1424908800,2,1698,4.634551495016611
8407365,5,B003WKQ44G,This documentary was very well put together. It really opened my eyes to the issue of where funding goes and who needs it.,1378339200,2,122,4.3478260869565215
8407366,5,B003WKQ44G,"Well balanaced, very critical, very eye-opening, and well produced video. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this, even as somebody with extensive experience doing international development projects",1358467200,,193,6.76
8407367,3,B003WKQ44G,This was pretty one sided.  I would not take everything you see here as good info.  Consider there was not one interview with a person working for the big farm and many have been hired for that...,1331856000,3,196,4.27027027027027
8407368,5,B003WKQ44G,"This is an excellent movie, outlining people's perception of being poor.  On one hand, you have a micro-economic thriving community that others view as the slum and needs improvement.  In the farmlands there are a people who feel that they have all the wealth that will last generations and a company that feels the solution to their issue is to tame nature.  This movie really gives a balanced view to all sides of the story and allows one to see that everyone has good intentions.  It really is thought provoking and definitely opens the door to a good discussion amongst friends.",1328313600,8,582,4.732673267326732
