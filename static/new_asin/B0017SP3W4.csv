8267097,4,B0017SP3W4,"I am currently studying 14 separate DVDs plus as many books on the Nikon D300 as I come to terms with my transition to digital photography and this is one is quite good.

So let me commence with what I really didn't like. Firstly, when I came across this product advertised on Amazon, I immediately noticed the distinctive yellow and black packaging and use of the word ""Nikon"" in exactly the same font and format as used by the Nikon company themselves. This gave me the impression (and I have been using Nikon cameras for over 30 years!) that this was a DVD tutorial produced by the Nikon company. It is NOT!

My second gripe is the way in which the presenter is portrayed in a very poor quality film. Any product which sets out to teach and demonstrate the very best about anything relating to photography must strive for perfection in every aspect of that presentation. Just as we do not expect to see a blurred photograph, so we also expect a high level of filming skills when studying the DVD itself.

That said. I do believe this is an excellent DVD for the beginner. The presentation style is both easy and competent and I only came across one item which I could not immediately follow. That was my fault because I had momentarily forgotten how to do something which had already been covered.

Whilst this DVD is not intended to replace the user manual which comes with the camera, I cannot recall a single instance where we were referred to that manual. In other words, unlike other similar products, the presenter was relying on his own skills of explanation and was not dodging any awkward areas by telling the viewer to go look them up.

Once again, you do need to sit down with a D300 camera and concentrate on the DVD content as it takes you through the various settings - all of which are well explained.

My own additional advice would also be to have a notebook handy for those all-important notes. Then go out and put what you have learned into practise - BEFORE watching the entire DVD again. It does work...
