3787533,5,B001SXZ7TW,"I am a Tyra Banks die hard fan. So if her name is surrounded by anything I must have it. I go back a long long way with Tyra and I carry her dearly in my heart. This movie just gave the audience another side of this beautiful woman. Of course being much younger she was perfect for the role. On the other hand I was not happy about the Lohan girl being portrayed as a thief.
Sometimes Hollywood goes off the beaten path and beomes too insinuating.
A pretty good movie for a young person who realizes the story is a Hollywood Lie!
I love the product and Tyra's acting...",1371340800,,569,4.135135135135135

3787537,2,B001SXZ7TW,"The Disney studio producers struck gold when they signed 11-year-old Lindsay Lohan to play the parts of Annie and Hallie in the 1998 remake of The Parent Trap,  Then they cast her in lead roles in Life-Size and Get a Clue, two unambitious films that gave young Lindsay little or no chance to demonstrate her acting ability.  It's sad, really, and disappointing that these precious years of Lindsay's life were squandered in this way.",1461628800,,433,4.837837837837838
