7969362,4,B00006IUFX,spent most of dvd laughing in floor - BUT NOT FOR KIDS - has some drug related scenes (Based on smuggling across border) and at first some comedy played sexual innuendo scenes. Haven't laughed this hard in years!!!,1370649600,,214,4.657894736842105
7969363,5,B00006IUFX,This was a slepper comedy that came out of the 90's.  It brings together the MOB vs The ways of the wild west..,1365638400,,111,3.8260869565217392
7969364,4,B00006IUFX,"The critics have panned this movie, but I say..... LIGHTEN UP.  This is pure slapstick and a send up on so many bad guy/good guy/western/drug dealin' scenarios.  Paul Rodriguez and Tommy Chong could have given each other a run for their money in the smuggling role.  If you have a funny bone, this farce should give it a good tickle.",1246060800,2,333,4.516666666666667
7969365,1,B00006IUFX,"The Shipment was one of the most unfunny comedies that just didn't seem to work out at all. Only the beginning was a bit funny with Steve Bacic in it,But if you want real action and real comedy,better get use to The Medallion instead of this garbage.",1107388800,,250,4.340425531914893
7969366,1,B00006IUFX,"I felt compelled to comment after I saw the positive review here.  This can in no way be considered good, funny or even mildly amusing.  Most of the ""name"" actors look embarrased with the notable exception of Modine, who gives his all in a pointless performance.  I have no idea how any of the actors were persuaded to join this sinking ship, but it's painful to watch and I wouldn't waste my time or money on this dud.",1101772800,2,419,4.346153846153846
7969367,4,B00006IUFX,"This is a great film. It is very funny, but the dvd has really no features at all (trailer, scene selections). they could've made this dvd great. All the actors are great in the movie (especially Elizabeth Berkley!). So, buy the movie...but do not expect to get a great dvd. That is why  Igave this 4 stars, because of the dvd.",1050883200,3,327,4.360655737704918
