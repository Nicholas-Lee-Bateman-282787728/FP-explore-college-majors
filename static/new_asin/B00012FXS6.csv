8202990,3,B00012FXS6,"This is halfway decent, but it's your typical soft-core stuff. The movie is also known as ""Marilyn Chamber's Naked Fairy Tales"", and is shown periodically on Cinemax.  From what I can gather, Seduction Cinema got the rights to it, and added some scenes featuring their own actresses (I don't recall seeing the Misty Mundae scene on TV).  I don't how 'naughty' this is exactly, but these women sure are naked.",1117411200,4,408,4.814285714285714
8202991,1,B00012FXS6,"When I picked up this dvd I thought it would be full beautiful women being harassed by other ""evil"" beautiful women.  However what I found was Marylyn Chambers narrating the beginning of each scene, and the lame narration is supposed to make the scence work, but it doesn't.  With the narration you get about 30 seconds of build-up to the scene, and then you get about 5 minutes of lame sex scenes.  One thing that really bugs me about this dvd as well as ""Lord of the G Strings"" is that the sounds of love making have been removed and replaced with music.  If you didn't like ""Lord of the G Strings"" then you will like this even less. Don't be fooled by the cover-art, no women dress up as animals.  In case your wondering, the feature runs about 50 minutes.  Of the 50 minutes, about 10-15 minutes is taken up by two lame strip teases (One with a model dressed as a wicked witch and another with a model dressed as Snow White).
I actualy enjoyed the trailers on this disc more than the feature attraction.",1084579200,30,1007,4.358288770053476
