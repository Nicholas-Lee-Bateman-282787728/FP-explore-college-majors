1958477,4,B0000WST6A,"James Ivory goes outside the normal realm of his film subject matter with an adaptation of Diane Johnson's very contemporary ""Le Divorce."" Though this may seem like an odd choice of subject matter for the team of Ivory and Merchant and screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, on second thought, it isn't. Because once again, as in ""Jefferson in Paris"" or ""Remains of the Day,"" Ivory and company is once again attracted to material in which we have characters from another culture, another country, another social strata mixing it up/clashing with those of the home culture: as in ""Le Divorce"" two American girls loose in Paris sampling all that is good about France: the culture, the food, the leather goods and shoes and of course, the men.
Naomi Watts plays Roxy: a pregnant, stressed, soon to be divorced sister to Kate Hudson's Isabel, who has just dropped out of Film School. Both go to Paris for a respite from their supposedly harried lives in the USA and are, at least on the surface, definitely not looking for romance. But what would a romantic comedy be without Romance and more to the point sex?
Ivory has directed with a very light hand and with his tongue planted very firmly in his cheek. The physical production is first rate but this is no surprise in an Ivory film: the man knows how and where to spend the money so that it has the most impact. Hudson, Watts and Stockard Channing are tres charmant and luminous as always...and by film's end, much wiser.
""Le Divorce"" is a French kiss to France at a time when most Americans do not feel terribly pre-disposed to hug, much less kiss a French person. But Ivory has the talent and the wherewithal emotionally to keep the proceedings as light as a Napoleon yet world aware enough to show how serious the underside of a burnt souffl can be.",1059868800,11,1798,4.639498432601881
1958478,2,B0000WST6A,"I really cannot see any comedy in this movie at all. And I wouldn't call any connection between the characters a romance. Still, the actors and actresses were very good, and I did watch the entire movie. The ending almost made up for the entire storyline although it did seem too good to be true, and very quickly wrapped up, considering everything that occurred throughout.",1490572800,,374,4.769230769230769
1958479,4,B0000WST6A,"I found this movie delightful for many reasons. The cast is a mix of American and French actors who must deal with the cultural clash between their very different points of view. The story has some improbable plot twists, sometimes bordering on fantasy, and the ending may seem contrived or deus ex machina. For me, that was just a part of the overall charm. Paris and the French countryside are very much characters in the movie. Anyone who lives Paris will find at least something to love. This is a very different kind of movie for Merchant/Ivory.",1489449600,2,550,4.680412371134021

1958491,4,B0000WST6A,"I really enjoyed this movie, although it's difficult to place it firmly in one film genre - it is at once a drama, comedy, tragedy and farce.  The star power is pretty high (Kate Hudson & Naomi Watts are both still early in their careers here, but Stockard Channing, Glen Close & Matthew Modine were well-established).  If you can resign yourself to just follow along and accept the frequent and often abrupt changes in tone (you go from lighthearted scenes to rather more serious ones, and vice versa, throughout the film), you'll probably enjoy it.  There are a lot of ""French"" clichs to ignore, as well, but since they are the catalyst for much of the action in the story, you have to swallow them (older French man seducing young, nave American woman; French women disparaging American women over cultural differences; French husband leaving one [American] wife because he fell in love with another [Russian] woman and he's ""helpless"" to fight his feelings [and the woman he loves is married, too - it's one big spouse swap]).  The basic gist of the movie is that Naomi Watts' French husband leaves her while she is pregnant with their second child; Kate Hudson is her sister visiting from America and she arrives just as the husband is leaving.  The movie loosely follows the divorce proceedings (hence the title), but there are a great many subplots (a painting ""maybe"" painted by Georges de La Tour owned by the Americans and claimed by the French husband's family as marital property; Kate Hudson's affair with the husband's much-older uncle; a romance between Naomi Watts & her divorce attorney; the husband's family & their many amusing quirks [due to being French, of course]; the drama with regard to who has rights to the painting, the husband's girlfriend's American husband going crazy over their affair...) - I don't want to give away too much, but you'll definitely be hopping, attention-wise throughout the film.  A classic?  No.  Worth a rental for a light evening's entertainment? Sure.",1461024000,4,2006,4.914201183431953
1958492,4,B0000WST6A,"I love this movie.  People should know that it is a very true depiction of the sometimes quirky, and very unique, French culture. I am an American and was married for nearly 20 years to a man from France. I spent a lot of time there and with his family and with friends there, and got to know the culture well.  This movie really presents the differences well.  Also, I like the film for its own sake. It is well-written, has some fine performances, and is a good story.  The trailer is a bit misleading... it isn't a comedy at all. It has a few amusing moments, but it is fairly serious, has a twist, and ultimately is a fairly serious and sometimes sad look at growing up, cultural difference, relationships, marriage.  I really recommend it.",1457222400,,744,4.4411764705882355

But if you've never lived outside the United States, and never been confronted with an entirely different culture, you could be perplexed. The comic balance is good. The arrogance of the French, defending their turf and culture, and the arrogance of the American intruders, who believe that everyone should behave and think the way they do. And are confused when they don't. It's good to look at, the cast is perfect, and it's witty and perceptive. No wonder it failed at the box office.

1958544,3,B0000WST6A,"As one would expect from anything associated with the Merchant Ivory team (or part of it), this film is beautiful to watch.  It's not ""A Room With A View"" by a long shot, but it's a very polished entry in the Romantic Comedy genre.  Kate Hudson plays the younger sister to Naomi Watts, an American married to a Frenchman, living in Paris.  She arrives just as hubbie is departing, for good.  Oddly enough, Kate looks best (that is to say, stylish and Parisian) when she arrives, as later in the film she adopts a sort of society dame helmet hair pageboy that makes her look ridiculous, as opposed to anything else.

In any case, what is billed as an observation of cultural differences is really more of a long-stare at Parisian style as Americans see it.  The American family of the two sisters, who come over to offer support during the divorce process, is nice enough---very informal, not one to stand on tradition--at least not on purpose---and the brother, representing the Red States, is obsessed with the value of a family owned painting that the older sister took to Paris, and which has now become a source of enmity within the divorce, and the attention of major museums.

Well of course, being French, the conservative in question is dirty old Uncle Thierry, an elegant womanizer who is tolerated by his wife and never exposed by the press.  Oh the French, even their conservatives have fun!  Sadly, he buys every one of his girls a red Grace Kelly bag from Hermes, and the dopey new American girl carries it everywhere, even when informed about its significance.

One of the movie's extended cameos is Glenn Close who plays a professor for whom Kate's character ends up working, and as it turns out, one of Uncle Thierry's former Kelly Bag recipients.

Of course, there's still the question of Le Divorce, which sort of hangs over the film---not in any menacing way, it keeps things moving when the production team forgets what the movie is about.  So, as it turns out, the french hubby has a mistress too (it runs in the family) but she also has a boy friend, or is she married too?  I forget.  Well, needless to say the boyfriend is an American, which means he's crazy and he's got a gun...

It might be Merchant Ivory, but no one said we were dealing with high culture here.  At least this one has french people in it---unlike Woody Allen's film which featured Paris in three eras with practically no french people in any one of them.

Most of the movie takes place indoors so you really don't see much of Paris, although there is a nice vignette expounding on french women and their scarves.

It's a romantic comedy.  If you like the genre, you'll probably like this film.  If you're coming from Merchant Ivory, you may not.  Or maybe you will.  It's entertaining.  I've seen much worse.",1356652800,2,2803,4.606854838709677

I've never done that for a movie, so that says a lot right there.

Let's be honest; Americans just aren't as interesting in a Merchant-Ivory film as Brits or, in this case, the French.  I haven't read the novel, but the film perfectly depicts the cultural differences, and also skillfully intertwines them with the generation gap between the young heroines and their parents, uncles, aunts, etc.  Yes, it's arguable that the depiction of the French relies too heavily on stereotypes...but who can honestly claim there's no truth there?

But all that they can come up with is to thank the philandering husbands mother for accepting them for lunch in their lovely country estate, and enjoy wonderful meals at restaurants that are outrageously expensive.  One ridiculous scene even pokes fun at the fact that Americans are too stupid to even know that the 17% automatic gratuity charge at the end of the meal requires an additional tip because that is the right thing to do.

1958558,2,B0000WST6A,"The point of this film is revealed at Sunday lunch (at least three generations are present) in the French countryside.

Roxy, her sister Isobel (the Americans) are having lunch at the country home of Roxy's mother in law, Madame dePersand who is very rich. Roxy's husband is not present as he has left Roxy and no one knows where he is. Roxy and her errant husband Charles-Henri seem to be rich too but they live in a simple flat in Paris.

Antoine (Roxy's brother in law) says that everyone in France is following the exploits of an American senator whose sexual appeal is due to his not using gel when he blow dries his hair. All of his conquests, referred to in his diary as S1, S2, S3... attribute his sex appeal to his lovely hair. It has more bounce, explains Antoine.

And in fact, hair is what this movie is about. Everyone except Roxy's divorce lawyer has lots of it.

Long blonde hair: Roxy, Isobel
Medium long blonde hair: various dePersand women
Short blonde hair: husband of woman Isobel's husband leaves her for

Short dark hair: both of Isobel's lovers, Roxy's husband, Roxy's mother in  law, children

Medium dark hair: Magda, woman Charles-Henri leaves Roxy for. Talks like a demented bird and moves her hands like she has a neurological problem.

Long graying hair: Olivia Pace, writer

Long white hair: landlady where Roxy lives

No hair: Roxy's divorce lawyer, who seems to be French but speaks perfect accentless English

1958564,5,B0000WST6A,"Kate Hudson is prettier than her mother, but she doesn't have half her range.  Nevertheless she is well cast as Isabel, particularly in the scenes in which she finds herself drawn to her enigmatic uncle, Edgar Cosset, played as a sophisticated pundit by the one and only Thierry Lhermitte.  When Edgar appears on TV, don't ask Isabel to do anything but stare at the screen.  Even if the house was burning, she'd be there slack jawed forgetting all about anyone else she's with.  I felt sorry for that other boyfriend Isabel had, that little nothing with the frizzy, greasy hair, but he was too much of a boy to compare to the magnificent Thierry Lhermitte.

He gives her a red Kelly bag which she then totes everywhere as a symbol of his love, and consequently everyone finds out that the two are involved.  We, the viewers, can see a mile ahead of Isabel and know he's just using her, quel tragedy.  If it was me, I'd have stapled myself to Thierry Lhermitte's iconic fesses before I let him kiss me off with a silk scarf, no way, Jose!

Obviously author Diane Johnson was interested in doing a French version of the Sylvia Plath-Ted Hughes story.  In both stories a female American poet, very pretty with blonde hair and two children, a boy and a girl, find themselves trapped in a foreign country when their sexy native husbands just dump them for younger, darker, more ethnic seductresses who also happen to be married.  And then the female poets at the center of the storyline attempt suicide.  The only difference in this story is that you would have to imagine that Sylvia Plath had a younger, peppy sister who went to England to help out and wound up sleeping with Ted Hughes' uncle.  Case closed, except for, the way Matthew Modine plays David Wevill, Wevill should sue.  The whole movie falls apart everytime Modine hogs center stage with his demented ramblings.  French police in real life would have shot him in an instant the first time he steals Kate Hudson's striped umbrella in the rainstreaked courtyard to her building, yes, and packed him off to Devil's Island, good riddance.",1175731200,,2095,4.6730245231607626
1958565,4,B0000WST6A,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and it boasts a very talented cast, from veterans Sam Waterston and Glenn Close to Naomi Watts and Kate Hudson. This film is a delicious foray into French culture.  After watching it with some friends, I annoyed them by speaking in a French accent for the next fifteen or so minutes and told them of my resolution to start wearing ""scarves.""  (Apparently, if memory serves me correctly, there are a dozen or so different ways to say scarf in French, depending upon context and style.)

The American in Paris, Roxanne (Watts), and her visiting sister, Isabel (Hudson), are thrown for a loop when Roxanne's husband announces his intent to file for a divorce.  A painter of sorts, Roxanne's husband has found a new muse in a married Russian woman.  The Russian woman is married in turn to an American (Matthew Modine), and this man goes ballistic when he discovers the affair and literally, puts ""an end to the affair."" (Sorry, couldn't resist the reference to another movie with Ralph Fiennes and Julianne Moore.)

Roxanne will not agree to le divorce and learns that she is pregnant. The most disturbing part of this movie is when Roxanne attempts suicide while pregnant.  Granted she wasn't in her right mind: a woman's hormones are all over the place during pregnancy and add to that the stress of an impending divorce suit coming from left field.  Fortunately, she is resuscitated, and in time, delivers a healthy baby.

Roxanne's family discovers that a painting of St. Ursula that hung for years in the living room is actually worth millions--Roxanne brought this family heirloom with her to Paris, and her husband, knowing its value, wants it as part of the divorce settlement.

There are other subplots, like the affair between Isabel and Roxanne's ""uncle-in-law,"" whose right-wing politics leave little to be desired. He tires of women easily, giving them a red Hermes purse as an introductory gift and a silk scarf as a parting gift. (Glenn Close's character had had an affair with this man many years before his affair with Isabel, but throughout the years, he hasn't deviated from his gift-giving routine: a red Hermes bag and a silk scarf.)

All-in-all, a worthwhile film that deserves more appreciation :-).",1175472000,5,2251,4.912928759894459

When Kate Hudson's character, Roxeanne's visiting sister, undergoes a Parisian ""education amoureuse"" in the arms of Theirry L'Hermitte, a right-wing politician, who ritually begins each of his affairs with the gift of a Hermes bag and ends them with a silk scarf, the sensual glories of France, its food, its love of fine underclothes (""les messieurs adorent ca"", and perfumes are laid before us, photographed as only Merchant and Ivory can.

My favorite scene was that of the visiting American parents and the boorish brother at Le Tour Argent. Stephen Fry, as a representative of Christie's auction house, does a wonderful turn as a no-nonsense British businessman character, ""I used to be in wines before I got into old masters.""

Matthew Modine is hilarious and sinister as an unglued cuckolded husband. The Hermes bag floats over Paris in the final scene in an homage to the famous movie ""The Red Balloon.""",1174780800,5,1286,5.056603773584905

1958568,4,B0000WST6A,"The majority of the Amazon reviewers for this movie were unhappy with it, but I think most of them didn't really ""get"" the movie. I think Americans who've lived abroad, especially in Europe, are more likely to appreciate the views expressed in this film concerning culture clash between Americans and Europeans, the French specifically.

I won't outline the plot, as that is done in too many other reviews, but let me just say that I came to appreciate this film more the 2nd and 3rd times I viewed it. The script somewhat forgoes conventional character development, and the viewer must be savvy enough to pick up on the characters' actions to discern their motivations. Naomi Watts and Kate Hudson make two pretty believable sisters as Roxy and Isabel -- Roxy is married with one young child and another on the way when her husband leaves her. Isabel is the affectionate but somewhat self-absorbed, immature younger sister who comes to Paris to keep Roxy company, but definitely persues her own agenda and ends up getting sucked into some sordid goings-on with her French in-laws.

The film touches on many themes and deals with the emotional upheaval and trauma of divorce while at the same time trying to retain the feel of intelligent romantic-comedy. It is perhaps trying to accomplish too much, as you can tell by the editing that some scenes were cut out to prevent it from being an over-long film. This is especially evident in Isabel's relationship with Yves. One minute, she's meeting him, and the next she's in bed with him. That is unfortunate on the filmmakers' part, but it didn't take too much enjoyment away from me, as I didn't have a problem filling in the blanks. But I know that not everyone can tolerate these kinds of faults in filmmaking.

As someone who lived in Europe for 5 years, I think I enjoyed it more than viewers who have more limited experiences of European lifestyle versus American. Another plus of this film is that it offers some great views of ""insider"" Paris, and Roxy's and Isabel's wardrobes are FANTASTIC. Beautiful clothes. My main annoyances with this film are the stupid flying Kelly handbag scene at the end (totally unnecessary), and the new DVD cover, featuring Kate and Naomi in outfits that were never seen in the film.",1168387200,26,2270,4.8005115089514065
1958569,4,B0000WST6A,"I don't know what I think about French culture. I don't hate it, but I'm not exactly in love with it either. I respect it, I understand it (well, at least I think I do) and I suppose that's all I can really hope for. I quite liked this film, though I can't really put a finger exactly on why. I'm even more confused about why I like it, seeing that so many reviewers here don't seem to think it's that great. Ah well.

""Le Divorce"" is all about a divorce between an American woman and her French husband, set in and around Paris. There's a lot of infidelity, a lot of disputed possessions, a little bit of legal work, and surprisngly for a divorce, hardly any open, aggressive anger. There's a mentally unhinged man stalking the poor ex wife (the husband of the woman her own husband is cheating with), a relative up for the French election, and a group of art critics and valuers (one of which is Stephen Fry) debating over a very special painting.

For a film set in Paris, I thought there'd be a few more outdoorsy shots, perhaps to places you don't normally see on film. Still, it's an atmospheric enough film. Paris is a funny old place, it looks more like a town down the road that a capital of a nation, I've always thought. I liked the use of the Eiffel Tower in the finale. The funny thing about that is you don't see the tower anywhere else in the film. I was actually wondering if they were going to show it all, then they use it for this climax. Unexpected, but I thought it was a nice touch. My favorite film for Parisian scenery is still the Doctor Who serial City of Death, mainly because of being the 1970s, (haha!) but anyway.

The characters, the main part of the film I liked and don't know why, I found fascinating. Like I've mentioned before, there's not a lot of open emotion, and when you're used to seeing things a bit more emotionally obvious is movies (like I am) sometimes you don't quite understand why a character has gone and done something. The actions of the characters remind me a bit of some of my relatives, mannerisms, dialogue and such. Perhaps I could relate to it, I don't know.

It's worth a look if you're into films about relationships, and maybe even fans of French culture. I mean, I'm not usually, but I liked this one.",1156032000,2,2264,4.3451536643026

While poor Roxy (Naomi Watts) suffers from the recent rejection of her crumby husband, Isabel (whose intention in visiting her sister was to help her through her pregnancy) self-indulges in her affair with the crumby husband's much older uncle.

But just as well I got it on a ""$1.25 Tuesday"" deal, since I would have felt horrible cheated if I watched this in the movie theatres or had forked out to purchase it.

There are far too many sub-plots that never get fully developed, and the result is a hap-hazard mish-mash mess.  It is an insult that actors with such talent have been cast into cardboard roles.

There are a few little tid-bits that are worth nothing; Naomi Watts performs well in her part of Roxanne - an expat American who is pregnant to her estranged French Husband.  She gives her character enough depth to gain the empathy of viewers.

Also, little cultural glimpses into the mannerisms of the French are like breaths of fresh air into the mediocrity of the central storyline (or storylines?).  I'm not talking about the apparent cavalier attitude towards marriage, but little mentions of how French women wear scarves, and the niggling of Roxanne's French In-Laws over little things like use of sugar grains as opposed to the French preference of sugar cubes.

Still, I definitely do not feel culturally enlightened after watching this movie.  In fact, I do not feel enlightened in any way.  Kate Hudson is flat and unconvincing in her role of Isabel,  Roxanne's sister - one particular part of the movie bothers me about Isabel; and this is where she meets... no, is introduced to Yves and in the very next frame it shows the two of them in bed together.  I was watching this with my Mum, and in response to this she said, ""Already?  Is there a scene missing?""  This lack of attention to time was apparent throughout the movie, with plots being rushed through and resulting in an undercooked waste.

If you're looking for comedy, you will not find it here.  I don't remember finding too much funny.  For a successful blend of culture and comedy, you are better off with movies like 'Under the Tuscan Sky', 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' - heck, you are even better off with 'Bend it like Beckham'.

It is not even one of those typical Merchant Ivory films which hark back nostalgically to Victorian England or the times of the Raj. ""Le divorce"" is something like a voyeur peep into the life of two families, one upper-crust French, the other high-brow American which are bound together by the couple whose marriage is drifting apart. The plot has not enough dramatic flair as to have been made into a film, if plot were the only thing to account for to define a film as a work of art, but it has plenty of charm if, like me, you are partial to Paris. For those who love French lifestyle the film will prove delicious: superb decors, shots in Caf Flore, the understated stardom of a plush Herms Kelly bag and Leslie Caron's appearance as the embodiment of French chic and cartesian rationale...all these will appeal to you. Glenn Close is also breathtaking as ever as the American writer who after years of living in Paris has impeccably assimilated the best of both cultures. This is not a film for a rainy day and less so for people who look for entertainment of jaded senses.

1958579,3,B0000WST6A,"The Merchant Ivory team usually produces films with a classic feel, with richly textured moments and subtlety.  In ""Le Divorce"", they've gone commercial - and it doesn't suit them.  American Isabelle (Kate Hudson) arrives in romantic Paris just as her sister Roxy's French husband (Melvil Poupaud) is leaving her.  Roxy (Naomi Watts) is pregnant and obstinate; she refuses to grant her husband a divorce despite the difficulties in French law it will cause her.  Like all messy divorces, the two focus their battle on an object that both covet, in this case a painting that Roxy has hanging in their apartment and which belongs to her family.  Isabelle, who comes across as a spoiled American, has an affair that complicates things.  Subplots abound.

Naomi Watts is likeable as Roxy, and her chemistry with Kate Hudson makes them believable sisters.  The Parisian scenery is filmed with a loving eye, and I enjoyed when the characters (realistically) switched between French and English.  Some wonderful actors make cameo appearances but have little to do:  Glenn Close, Sam Waterston, Stockard Channing, Leslie Caron, Matthew Modine, Bebe Neuwirth.  The result is blandly entertaining, with otherwise good actors hashing out a mediocre script.  Even the flying red purse at the end, an homage to the classic French short ""The Red Balloon,"" comes across as ludicrous.

1958583,4,B0000WST6A,"Not liking Kate Hudson and her vapid, vacant ""acting"" and slim range of facial expressions, and not having been able to make up my mind about Naomi Watts, who is considerably more talented than Hudson (but I am still not sure if I like her, despite her clear range/versatility), I watched this film, not expecting too much but was pleasantly surprised. The tale unfortunately moves a bit slowly at times, but this is almost charming. Because Watts's character Roxeanne has been living in Paris, the viewer expects a more thoughtful, slower-paced, ""French"" film; her life, after all, is not a fast-paced, fast-food mess like a life in America. In the story, Roxeanne's French husband decides to leave her for another woman on the same day that Roxeanne's sister, Isabel (Kate Hudson) is coming to visit. Complicating matters considerably, Roxeanne is pregnant; Isabel is nave and enters an affair that complicates many matters. While this could have been total crap, the supporting cast of characters actually lend a greater depth and cleverness to the story (the divorce proceedings drag on while Roxeanne fights with ex-husband over the ownership of a painting that has been in her family for many years). It is actually quite delightful to see Glenn Close in this film, and Jean-Marc Barr's presence (as annoying as he can be to me sometimes) is a reassuring and always smiling face. Matthew Modine's appearance as a deranged sort of stalker is also of interest. Because the cast of characters is broad and varied, one does not become too bogged down by the fact that the story and indeed the divorce itself does not move along as quickly as one might hope.

A man getting in the Eiffel Tower through the exit door, but nobody stopped him, and nobody had any suspicion until that guy took a gun out of his jacket??? that's just impossible to believe... after 9/11, shouldn't security system be strict everywhere you go, especially in a well-known place like the Eiffel Tower???

1958592,5,B0000WST6A,"One very bad reason to criticize a film is that it was different than what was expected. One could go see Le Divorce expecting a fluffy, lighthearted, typically-kate-hudson romantic comedy. For the most part, it is not. but it's not the film's fault.

I had already seen the bad reviews when I decided to see the movie, it has been one of my all-time favorites ever since. What do I like so much about a movie so horrendously criticized? well, Le Divorce is tasteful. no car crashes, no explicit sex, no building blowing up. the social commentary in film is very low key, as is everything else. Although the obvious major plotline is one involving the divorce, but there are so many other things happening at once. some critics complain that the characters are not fully developed. Some even say that none of the characters - except Roxy maybe- are likeable.

this film isn't made to preach or to instruct. We are not given god-like insights into the characters' minds. There are no heros or heroins. Le Divorce is an honest, yet tasteful portrayal of life and the people in it. although I see people's frustration with Isabelle, to me, she is a wonderfully pleasant and just simply cute, yet at certain mometns she reveals depth and sharp insights. she's also a just another girl who is capable of losing perspective (as we all are at one point or another.) Roxy is not without fault, not to mention her French husband and his family. However, to me, that is exactly what makes this film so endearing. we see the characters as they are, with their flaws and vulnerabilities. We see their fear, apprehension, and tears.

Summed up, Le divorce is an intelligent, low-key, mellow, tasteful, visually charming, social comedy at its best. anyone expecting anything other than that will be disappointed, yet the film beautifully fulfills its mission.",1095984000,7,1845,4.79559748427673

 Hudson plays Isabel, a free-spirited woman who travels to Paris to visit her pregnant half-sister Roxanne, played by Watts. Roxanne is devasted at the news of her husband's affair and debates on whether or not she should file for le divorce.

 Hudson and Watts are joined by a superb cast which include the long absent and always beautiful Leslie Caron (Gigi), Sam Waterson, Glenn Close, Bebe Neuwirth, and Stockard Channing, to name a few. This delightful cast and the beautiful Paris locations are unfortunately the only redeeming quality in this boring and muddled film.

1958598,3,B0000WST6A,"The City of Light is certainly full of it -- ""Le Divorce"" brims over with gorgeous scenery, light-filled streets, and dozens of minor aesthetic details. The plot is fairly flimsy, and most of the acting requires little stretching, but it's an amusing piece of anti-romantic fluff.

 Hippie-esque Isabel Walker (Kate Hudson) is coming to Paris to look after her pregnant sister Roxy (Naomi Watts). But Isabel walks into the building just as her brother-in-law Charles-Henri (Melvil Poupaud) walks out -- for good. He wants a divorce so he can marry a seductive Russian married woman but Roxy puts her foot down and won't give him a divorce so easily.

 As the two wrangle over the custody of priceless art and their two kids (one still unborn), Isabel slips into a fling with Charles-Henri's sexy middle-aged uncle Edgar (Thierry Lhermitte), while working for one of his former flings (Glenn Close). As the divorce nears and emotions work to a boil, the separation is granted in an unexpected way...

 ""Le Divorce"" is not quite a romance per se. Instead it's more of a comedy of manners and a societal satire all in one. Not a very barbed satire, but it calmly skewers the hypocrisies and mores of French civilization. One particularly enticing subplot is Leslie Caron's bigoted character, who automatically sides with her scuzzy son rather than her wronged, pregnant daughter-in-law. Unfortunately, whenever this starts to rev up, it takes a backseat to ""Kate Hudson's Shopping Spree in Paris.""

 The direction is pretty solid, making the atmosphere tense or lightweight when it needs to be. There's lots of clothes and shopping, some low-key romantic interests -- like that guy who looks like he's touched a live wire, or the bald lawyer -- and the occasional moment of tragedy, like Roxy's suicide attempt. But the plot seems to wander in the last third of the film, when the Americans arrive and Isabel's romance starts to sputter out with hardly any problems.

 Hudson really doesn't get to do much in this film except look perky, although her transformation from bohemian to Parisian chic is striking. Watts is the real winner of the film, with her restrained tears and quiet intensity. Poupaud also manages to give some dimension to an utterly unsympathetic person, and Caron is fairly amusing as the politely catty mother-in-law from hell.

 There's nothing outstanding about ""Le Divorce"" -- it's merely a piece of light fluff, pretty as a Parisian postcard. Fairly amusing, but not much more than a Euro-flavored chick-flick.",1090454400,2,2533,5.01909307875895

Names like Glenn Close and Stockard Channing have no real prominence in this film, and that is because there wasn't enough time to develop their characters.  Maybe when they first signed on for the film, the script was different.

Le Divorce tries to introduce too many characters, too many storylines and disguise it in a french setting (maybe they thought viewers would fall for the romantic setting and overlook the crappy storyline).

James Ivory film was never so humorless and pointless as ""Le Divorce,"" wasting everything and everyone who must have gathered here simply because of the name of the director.  Sorry that I have to say so, but it was a painful experience to sit through the two hours watching this mess.
The premise based on the bestselling novel of the same title is promising.  Naomi Watts and Kate Hudson are American sisters.  Naomi is married to a French, who turned out unfaithful at the beginning of the film, and we see him leaving the apartment in Paris, where Kate arrives at the exact moment when he ditches (when his wife is pregnant).  Naomi's character Roxeanne refuses to divorce (for no other reason than ... well, we are not allowed to know), while Kate's sister Isabel falls in love with a guy (and husband), watching him in a show on TV.
Now, it should be the time for hilarious culture-clash comedy, or at least some good romantic comedy against the backdrop of the beautiful city of Paris.  And Naomi Watts and Kate Hudson can really act, as you know, plus you get delightful Stockard Channing as their mom flying all over from America.  You also get Stephen Fry, Bebe Neuworth, Jean-Marc Barr, Leslie Caron, and even Glenn Close.
And what happened?  A mess.  A real mess.  Don't be mistaken, please.  The photography is great, showing the charms of the city.  And I do not particlulary disagree with the descriptions of the French.  Well, they may not like talking about money; they do not care much about infidelty; no, no, I just don't know these things, but the film suggests so.
The real problem is its characters, or the way the film shows them on the screen.  In short, you can relate to none of them.  French may act like this, but the problem is, THE FILM FAILS TO MAKE THEM CHARMING.  It is quite unfunny to see a pregnant woman deserted unless the hubby in case has some redeeming quality.  In ""Le Divorce"" there is none.  And you see wrist-cutting; stalker, and murder.  What do these things mean?
Or see Kate Hudson.  It is quite disheartening for us to see a grown-up American female (and played by Kate 'Penny Lane' Hudson') fall in love with a cardboard character, simply because he looks great and speaks French.  And it seems that Kate thinks he is gorgeous (actually, he is not) and marvellous even after she knows that she is just one of many affairs.  If this is a typical case of love in France, the film should be dealt with more delicate touch and convincing characters.
The sub-plot about the painting is just as uninteresting as the main one, and the film, with so many great locations, adds up to nothing.  It's all about the fantastic costumes and hairduts, but the they can hardly cover up the fact that ""Le Divorce"" is awfully empty and its values are quite dated.

The movie seems to scream at the viewer that the French are evil, gauche, and utterly frivolous, while Americans are victims, innocent and pure.  While neither can be the case, it is ridiculous to taut such views.
The characters in the movie as well as their interactions, comings and goings make no sense.  No one has a reason for doing what they do or going where they go.  Kate Hudson's character falls in love with two men that she barely knows and is in no way a support to her sister whose French husband mysteriously runs off with a Russian woman.  The evil French husband then does all he can to be utterly unfair to poor Roxy (his wife).  He wants to take her children, her family's painting, ie everything he can for reasons that the movie does not go into.
What bothers me more than ridiculous people doing ridiculous things for ridiculous reasons is when movie writers have cardboard cutout people do ridiculous things for reasons that are kept hidden from us.  From the scene where Kate Hudson gets a strange haircut for seemingly no reason, I simply lost interest in the story.
Also, the writers were trying to elicit emotions where their wasn't sufficient development for there to be any.  Examples were the murder of the cheating husband and his girlfriend, the selling of the painting, the suicide of Roxy, the mad gun battle on the Eiffel Tower, etc. Need I go on?

1958603,3,B0000WST6A,"I am a fan of Kate Hudson and Naomi Watts.  And, since I saw the brilliant films they produced in the 80s such as ""Room with a View"", ""Maurice"" and ""Howard's End"", I am also a fan of Merchant/Ivory as a writing and producing team.  This film is not a bad film, but it moves along too slowly and didn't have me completely entralled like their earlier films
The story centers around two sisters, one (played by Hudson), who goes to Paris to be with her pregnant sister (played by Watts).  As she arrives, her sister's husband, an unfaithful scoundrel is literally walking out of her life.  To further complicate things, Hudson's character becomes involved with her brother-in-law's uncle, a handsome and charming 50 something French man, who has worked his way through a long a line of young ladies like Hudson, an addiction he can't seem to break.
There are lots of interesting people in this film such as Glenn Close, Stockard Channing and Sam Waterson but they are not given much to do.  And I have to admit, the character, Magda, drove me NUTS.  She wasn't in the film that much but every time it showed her, her voice and manner drove me out of my mind!  She was completely annoying!
If you want a really good Merchant/Ivory film pick one of the three I mentioned earlier (or perhaps, Remains of the Day).  Want a good Naomi Watts film...I recommend ""The Ring"".  This film I only recommend marginally.  I hope Merchant/Ivory hits their stride again and really gives their fans something to rave about!",1085788800,2,1504,4.620300751879699
1958604,4,B0000WST6A,"Okay.  This is NOT a run-of-the-mill romantic comedy (which I happen to be a fan of), but it is still interesting and worth seeing.  If you remember that it IS a Merchant-Ivory production, you will not be so surprised that it is not fluffy and light.  (Nothing wrong with that; ""light"" and ""heavy"" movies each have their time and place.)
The thing that I think of most fondly about this movie is the actors themselves.  I would never have thought to cast a movie with Sam Waterston and Stockard Channing playing parents to Kate Hudson and Naomi Watts (although Stockard is Naomi's step-mother, in the movie, I think).  Seeing the four of them, in addition to the impressive actor who plays Kate & Naomi's brother (who co-starred with Kate in HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN TEN DAYS), interact was a great pleasure.  I also really enjoyed Kate & Naomi's one-on-one scenes, although I wish Kate's character (Isabel) had been more emotionally supportive of Naomi's character (Roxanne) and less focused on her affair with Edgar.  But, I guess it is more realistic that sometimes people let themselves get overwhelmed with their own dramas and forget to keep up with their loved ones' emotional crises.
The contrasting of American and French perspectives on life, divorce, infidelity, and ""good taste"" in general is interesting, although it can be annoying when one realizes how snobbish one culture tends to be about another culture.  Such is life.
One last point I want to make, which I think is being missed by some other reviewers here, is that Roxanne (and to a slightly lesser extent, Isabel) had a great EMOTIONAL attachment to the painting, not just an interest in the money it was worth.  If most of us think back on our childhoods (or look at old photographs or home movies), we can remember the reassuring, constant presence of certain furnishings in the home we grew up in.  One person may fondly remember a sofa or love seat that they sat on with their first boyfriend/girlfriend, etc.  Another person might remember the wallpaper in the kitchen that was so distinctive to that time and place, and the happy memories it evoked.  And another might remember a chiming clock that you got so used to hearing in your home that you almost didn't even notice it, but yet you felt safe and contented knowing it was always there.  So, I think Naomi's character had a nostalgic, emotional attachment to that painting (especially since it was of the saint who watches over young girls).  I wanted to make sure that this was pointed out, in case a viewer wasn't watching closely enough to see how crushed Roxanne was when the painting was being wrapped up and taken away.  She seems to only really reconcile herself to the loss of it in her life when they decide to honor it in a way that benefits others.
I recommend this movie to people who are interested in the differences between American and French cultures, as well as those interested in movies about love and the loss of it.",1085356800,2,2969,4.69364161849711
1958605,5,B0000WST6A,"The joy of this film is not the comedy (though one cannot help but laugh at the interactions of the vividly drawn characters in this film); this film's redemption comes in the sharp eye it takes to the relationships and the differences in the French and American people.
In the film, Americans are as comicly cheap, gauche (""It's so perfectly convenient, why wouldn't I want to carry it everywhere?"", Kate Hudson says of a ten thousand dollar bag), and laidback, as the French are hysterically haughty (""Sugar grains? How original!"", the French Mother insults the American daughter-in-law), frivolous, and decadent.
I think that many went into this movie looking for the wrong thing.  This is not the typical Kate Hudson romantic comedy, this is not some crass slapstick routine about an American fumbling around in Europe, this is a sophisticated look at a head-butting of American attitudes and French ideals.
Visually, the film delights with quick peekings into not only French cuisine, landscape, architecture, and art, but also with disturbing images of sadness and pain.  In one scene, Kate Hudson walks into her sister's apartment to find her slumped over a couch bleeding to death.
Sure, the movie does jump around, but it had a lot of ground to cover: for those interested in a quick, brainless, formulaic presentation of boy-meets-girl plotting, this movie will disappoint; but for those who are interested in a well thought out, yet charming, juxtaposition of the modern French and today's American, this film will go down as a contemporary screen gem.
(And of the title, Le Divorce: while much of the movie does thematically circle around the idea of divorce, it's actually quite ironic the rigidity of the French idea of divorce and the American.  While the French still exhibit the legendary Flaubertian attitudes toward infidelity, their ideas about divorce aren't as capricious as the American.  And in many ways this movie details not only the literal divorce of the sister and her husband, but of a divorce,a separation, an end to the romantic notion Americans have about the French.  While Kate may indulge herself with a French lover thoughtlessly, she finds that she too must divorce herself from that ideal.  The family must divorce itself of its prized French heirloom.  Even the French have to divorce themselves of the idea of the victimless affair.  This film operates on so many human levels, it's surprising that so few actually ""got it."")",1084665600,23,2467,5.044226044226044

Last year watching the trailers of movies coming soon, I watch the spot of ""Le Divorce"" and I was absolutely convinced it should be a comedy. Even the comments of the off-voice was sort-of-a-joke: ""Le Divorce: if you say it in French, it sounds more sexy"".
When watching this film at home, I found it very suprising that dialogs didn't have any point of joke, and that the plot was only around who should be owning a picture, not a divorce in its own sense. But, at least, I finished watching it and my sensation was not bad. I thought it was a decent film (3-stars or so) and somewhat recommendable.
But some hours later, I discovered it was a real lie. I was sold a comedy film but it was only a melodrama or so. I was feeling bad like being cheated!

1958612,4,B0000WST6A,"It always kills me how people can view movies so one mindedly. Holding this film up to other Merchant Ivory pictures is inconceivable. Firstly, movies like ""Room with a View"" or ""The Remains of the Day"" are masterpieces, rich with beautiful scenes, witty reparte, and conventions of their times and places. ""Le Divorce"", in many aspects, is not much different on these planes. Yes, it is a flawed movie, with some holes, but mostly it is a very subtle movie. I've read some reviews on this site attacking the views on Americans in this film... okkkk... may I just remind everyone that this is a film SET IN FRANCE about the cultural differences between the French and Americans. In some scenes it might be overplayed some what, but I am willing to bet most of that was done to emphasize the point for typical lazy American audiences. Okay, I am American, I love my country and the people in it, but come on, most American movie audiences go to a movie to be entertained, especially a movie featuring Kate Hudson that sports a poster of her smiling innocently next to an equally blonde beauty, Naomi Watts. This movie is not to entertain, and it's charm is in the subtle details. Example; Isabel's smile and nod routine to her neice's ballet teacher because she doesn't know French, or when Edgar makes his comment about deciding if she will become his misteress and she looks around to make sure no one is listening in. This is a movie that is supposed to be about an American coming to Paris, who, like most Americans, is stunted culturally (as in worldly) and starts to change her personality and become more sophisticated as a result of this different culture she comes into contact with. Also, may I just mention that Roxy and Olivia Pace are expatriates, not ex-patriots. There is a huge difference, which I will assume, perhaps wrongly, you can figure out on your own. Overall, I think this movie has a lot of merit, but I also think it must be approached by an impartial audience looking for a movie that is smart and witty that you will perhaps have to think about for awhile. This isn't ""A Room with a View"", how could it be, but on it's own this movie is an interesting look at what happens when two very different cultures come together to work through a problem.",1079568000,7,2274,4.575980392156863

1958614,3,B0000WST6A,"Kate Hudson and Naomi Watts appear on the cover for ""Le Divorce,"" and so there is a natural tendency to wonder which one you are going to care about more when you see the film.  But instead my attention was drawn to a pair of inanimate objects, an expensive Hermes purse and a possibly even more expensive painting.  It was one of those that I actually ended up caring about the most in this 2003 film and when it became the key part of the climax I was sort of pleased.  But up to that point this James Ivory film never really clicked for me mainly because I found out the characters were not as interesting as that painting.
I think the problem is that the cast is so stellar that we expect something more substantial.  This is a cast that has Leslie Caron and Glenn Close, Stockard Channing and Sam Waterston, and Mathew Modine and Bebe Neuwirth running around in it.  But except for the first pair, the rest have relatively little of importance to do in the film.  The screenplay by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala and Ivory is adapted from Diane Johnson's novel, and tells the story of the clash between American and French culture on not only divorce but also affairs.  We already knew the two cultures clashed on the subject of war, so maybe we should not be surprised the conflict continues with regards to love as well.
Roxeanne (Watts) is the one who is getting ""le divorce"" and her sister Isabel (Hudson) is the one having the affair.  Roxeanne's husband Charles-Henri (Melvil Poupaud) has fallen in love with a married Russian woman named Magda and she has to deal with the irony that as the injured party she has to ask for the divorce she does not want.  Her husband has no grounds, but he has found the love of his life so why is Roxeanne being so unreasonable? (i.e., so ""American"").  Meanwhile, Isabel decides to have an affair with Edgar (Thierry Lhermitte), the brother of Roxeanne's mother-in-law (Caron).  Why is she doing something that is obviously stupid?  Because she is an American and that is what they do.  Look at Modine's character.  He is the American husband of Magda and distraught over his wife's infidelity whom does he go after?  Why, Roxeanne, of course (altogether now: stupid American).
With a lesser cast this story might work better, because I did not want to believe Kate Hudson's character would have an affair in which all she was really getting out of it was a purse (and, eventually a scarf).  I was more sympathetic toward Roxeanne but then she does something stupid and I had nobody left to root for and was back to being worried about who was going to get that painting.  Caron as the critical matriarch of the Persand clan and Close as the ex-patriot American writer are the more interesting supporting players.  However, it was when Stephen Fry pops up as a representative of Christie's auction house that I really started paying attention again.  Roxeanne will get divorced and Isabel's affair will end, and who knows what that really has to say about American versus French sensibilities on such affairs of the heart.  But the important thing here is that the French would not know a great undiscovered work of art if an expert from the Louvere came out and looked it over long and hard.",1078963200,2,3229,4.602094240837697

Reasoned painter Charles-Henri de Persand (Melvil Poupaud) while found out by the visiting sister-in-law Isabel (Kate Hudson), which is amusing since both are equally not well disciplined in addressing a relationship but that, is awesome to say anyway. Honest, romantic, and spontaneous as the way Charles-Henri's quote should, LE DIVORCE sounds and looks better than any other contemporary comedy.
Realising her broken marriage could get as worst as losing a precious family heritage [the painting La Tour], and not getting any helpful support from young Isabel who is deeply fascinated by the diplomat uncle-in-law Edgar Cosset (Thierry Lhermitte), the pregnant and emotionally devastated Roxanna (Naomi Watts) finally looked up to her parents in America for help. The entire Walker family arrive in the springtime Paris. Together with a little help from Roxy's devoting lawyer Maitre Bertram (Jean-Marc Barr) they must protect their daughters from the Persands who relentlessly spoiled the son, and claim their ownership as surely as the 4 million value of La Tour amidst LE DIVORCE. Not a surprising happy ending.
I particularly like the screen writer's link of uncle Cosset with the residing American publisher Olivia Pace (Glenn Close) decades before his current affair with Isabel. Even a forever Hrmes Kelly [handbag] could never team up with a lightest, finest strip of silk scarf.

1958619,1,B0000WST6A,"A character in Le Divorce says something to the effect of, 'there is a fine line between tragedy and comedy'. This is what viewers are ultimately to take away from the film, but the failure to deliver either tragedy or comedy renders this movie pointless. The existing tragedy is forced and overly foreshadowed through the film's entirety by a manic character who is never fully fleshed out. Perhaps this is an attempt to create intrigue and, by film's end, suspense, but the delivery falls flat and deprives viewers of the character with the most interest potential. As for comedy, expect neither cultural satire nor slapstick. The wit is dry and the subject matter never truly lends itself to a comic focus.
When watching Le Divorce, expect underdeveloped characters whose various predicaments are neither compelling nor surprising. It is difficult to connect emotionally with any of the leads leaving most viewers to simply shrug their shoulders at their onscreen interaction. Even during the most traumatic of moments designed to elict shock and sadness I found myself asking, ""Who are these people and why do we care?"" This is never answered and made more fustrating by a subplot involving a family heirloom that consumes large portions of the movie by introducing unnecessary characters that shed little light on the main players.

1958621,2,B0000WST6A,"There was some speculation that the reason ""Le Divorce"" flopped at the box office was due to contentious relations between Americans and the French.  Really, the film bombed because it is a great big silly mess.
It starts out promisingly--Kate Hudson is as fresh as a California breeze as she arrives in Paris to visit her pregnant sister, Roxy (Naomi Watts), whose aristocrat French husband leaves her with no explanation.  Watts is stuck in a thankless role, but she does what she can, and you can't help but sympathize with the woman, especially as she reads Ann Bradstreet's ""To My Loving Husband"" at a poetry reading.
Hudson's character Isabel soon takes up with an older relative (by marriage) who is her polar opposite in terms of politics and values, yet who still has a certain sexual magnetism.  The concept of an older, married Frenchman keeping a nubile, young mistress might seem shocking to anyone who's been living under a rock for the past two hundred years, but ultimately, it's a fairly pointless plot detour that allows us a glimpse at expensive French purses and lingerie and shows us how the ridiculously wealthy French dine and spend their time, but little more.
The jokes at the expense of the French are lame and cliched and nothing you've never heard before.  The filmmakers stupidly pass up an opportunity to truly examine French family values and sexual mores.  That would have made for an interesting film.  Instead, they merely brush the surface.  As it is, ""Le Divorce"" promises too much and delivers too little.
After the film meanders through several other underwritten plot lines, Matthew Modine shows up, and things really fall apart.  As Tellman, the scorned husband of Magda, Roxy's husband's obnoxious Russian mistress, Modine appears just as befuddled by the film as those watching it.  We are given little reason for his erratic behavior, and when he finally loses it, the principal reaction is confusion, not shock or dismay.
Great actors like Glenn Close, Sam Waterston, Stockard Channing, Leslie Caron, and Jean-Marc Barr can do nothing but flounder in the cardboard roles given them.  It's difficult to say if this disjointed film suffers from poor editing or poor writing.  Either way, it's pretty forgettable.
On a side note, the DVD contains no extras and no deleted scenes, so there's no way of knowing if the best parts of this film were left on the cutting room floor.

I won't bore you by recapitulating the whole plot, but it revolves around MONEY (and a valuable painting) in a way that is actually less interesting than anybody's real divorce proceedings. Being so obsessed wtih money over relationships reduces any seriousness or caring about the characters we might have felt. Kate Hudson is very beautiful but looks absurd in a cheap, obvious wig and clothing that no 22 year old would ever wear. As a result, she comes off older (even though I think she actually IS around 22 or so), and the actor playing Edgar looks YOUNGER than 55, so their affair isn't remotely shocking. (IMPORTANT NOTE: in the novel, Edgar is 75 years old! the affair is supposed to be kind of creepy and awful, not sexy at all.)

Also this is not a traditional film. One goes in thinking it's an American-style romance or a dramady with a buildup and a story-arc.  Then you're surprised when one scene follows another and suddenly characters just-introduced are sitting in bed watching TV.

The resident 'passionate' neurotic was ridiculous.

The production team also manages to completely underuse the potentially dynamic duo of Stockard Channing and Sam Waterson.  These are two of their generation's finest talents, yet here they pop up in two-dimensional parents' roles.  If replaced, no one would miss them.  Same goes for Glenn Close.  Imagine, these three stars together in a film and no one barely noticed.  A shame.
Other than Watts, the only two things worth noting:
a) Thierry Lhermitte's excellent take as Watts' 'uncle' (in-law) Edgar Cosset (he looks and sounds great here, especially for those who haven't seen a lot of his previous work - *this* is a movie star).
b) Matthew Modine - apparently no one got the word out to him that you weren't supposed to do serious acting in this film.  He turns in a performance, and looks seriously out of place as a result.",1070236800,5,1099,4.722513089005235

Emotionally it is downright repulsive.  No character is likeable, and the majority are completely repugnant.  If, as is touted, this is meant to be a 'study' of the differences in attitude between the French and Americans in matters of the heart, then it a cynical, superficial, and wholly uninteresting 'study' - there are no worthwhile insights into human relationships, only tired, simplistic, and ultimately false cliches and stereotypes.  It seems that the writer thinks that he has deeply analysed the French, that is all the French people and their entire culture, in terms of their purported readiness to say, 'But, of course', to any event, however disturbing.  It is hard to think of a less intelligent analysis.
*
As a narrative, or as straight entertainment, it also fails dismally.  The focus on money, as embodied by a painting by an old master, is incredibly dull.  The characters are cardboard, with not even a hint of what lies behind their surface personas, and the latter are hardly engaging in themselves.  Naomi Watts struggles to give some spine to her role, but the script defeats her at every turn.  Kate Hudson doesn't even bother to struggle, figuring that simpering smiles and bafflement will suffice for her to pick up her pay check.  The French actors sleepwalk their way through the nightmare.

This film is also far too long.  So if you're looking for two hours of witless misanthropy, see 'Le Divorce'.  I still can't quite believe that Merchant Ivory had anything to do with a film this bad.",1068163200,5,1731,4.8338983050847455

Actually, it strikes me as a movie very insulting to the French. They are depicted as adulterous, two-faced, and out to steal your inheritance if possible. How different things would be if only they would have supported the invasion of Iraq!
There are a lot of good performances, that's true, and that's what does make the picture work as far as it does. The woman playing Kate Hudson's sister is absolutely beautiful, too.
One scene that did make me burst out laughing (but not the moviemakers' design) was when Kate visited a lingerie shop to outfit herself for an assignation. This totally flat-chested actress told the shopkeeper she needed a 34B! Oh, sacre bleu! There's just no way she could have that cup size!
It got a little too serious and then dipped into melodrama at the end; rather like an eclair that turns out to have a heavy crust.

1958634,4,B0000WST6A,"It is difficult for an unusual movie to catch a break these days, especially when it's brand of peculiarity does not capture the hearts of the ""artistic"" film community.  We have become so used to somewhat crisp storylines and a combination of characters and situations that fit into a neat Americanized package that it's no wonder a movie like this suffers from mixed reviews.
I think you have to love the French to love this movie, and I am quite fond of both.  Most Americans don't like the French because they consider them to be rude, but what they perceive to be ""rudeness"" is, in my experience, a difference in communication style.  There are several voice intonations in French that are completely normal in that language, but in English they are perceived as negative.  In much the same way, this movie's tone creates similar misunderstandings.
But let's talk about the movie in more specifics.  The storyline was admittedly somewhat weak and incongruous in some respects, and it does vary from the book on which it is based, but none of that really matters.  The acting was delightful, especially from Kate Hudson, whose charm I never tire of (much like her delightful mother, Goldie Hawn).  The characters were fascinating and added great interest to the picture.  The setting was enriching for a fan of Paris, such as I am.  And the generous amount of dialogue in French (with sub-titles) really helps to create the experience of being in France.  Indeed, it is a unique experience that can only be appreciated by a unique group.  Count me in.

In fact, this story had a serious side to it, but still had its comical sides. I loved the Paris scenery, especially the scene in the Eiffel Tower (seemed like you were there!).

1958637,3,B0000WST6A,"This film fails to live up to the promise indicated by its director James Ivory and his first-rate cast. Among the members of the cast are Kate Hudson (Isabel Walker), Naomi Watts (Roxanne, her pregnant sister), Stockard Channing and Sam Waterston as their parents, Leslie Caron as the mother of Roxanne's husband Charles-Henri (Melvil Poupaud), Leslie Caron (Charles' mother), Glenn Close (an expatriate writer and friend of several of the characters), and Thierry L'Hermitte (Charles' uncle Edgar and a politician) and Matthew Modine as the outraged husband of Magda, Charles' lover. This cast obviously comprises more than enough acting talent to result in a compelling cinematic experience, yet despite the visual beauty of some of the scenes of Paris and the achievements of some of the cast members in their individual roles, I found the experience disappointing.
The movie is based on the adaptation of a popular novel by Diane Johnson, and while I have not read the novel and do not intend to after viewing this film I suspect that a major problem is that the screen adaptation is in fact too true to the book. The central plot is that Isabel arrives in Paris to live with her sister as Roxanne prepares for the birth of her child. Literally, as Isabel arrives in Paris Charles is leaving Roxanne and soon announces that he wants a divorce. We are gradually introduced to Charles' family and Roxanne's family as they attempt to deal with the situation from their distinctly French and American viewpoints. Meanwhile, there is a subplot involving a painting in Roxanne's apartment that may or may not be a LaTour and the attempt to verify it's authenticity is complicated by museum politics (the Louvre vs. the Getty) and it's impact on the property settlement if there is a divorce. There is Isabel's eventual affair with Edgar and in addition increasing tension resulting from the attempt's of Magda's husband to end her relationship with Charles. And Glenn Close's role as the glue that ties a lot of these relationships together is an exercise in unrealized potential.
Yes, it is as complicated as it sounds. There are just too many subplots for a film; after all, in the theater you don't have the luxury that a reader does of pausing to consider the relationships and their complexity or rereading the sections necessary to refresh your memory. It appears that the screenwiter and director were so captivated by the book that they felt that to be true to the story they had to include all of its complexity, but of course it is impossible in a one hour
fifty-five minute film to do justice to all the elements of an over three hundred page novel. At a seminar that I recently attended, a well known professor of theaterestimated that the best you could hope to do in a two hour film is capture one basic plot line and one ancillary line, a few supplementary ideas and maybe fifty pages of the book. So the key is get the essential elements right and then use the visual medium at your disposal to present the story as accurately as possible.
By attempting to do too much, including an examination of the diffenences between American and French cultural attitudes about a range of subjects, this film does not come close to fulfilling its potential. However, while I was neither thrilled nor enchanted, the movie clearly had some good performances and excellent cinematography and was an interesting attempt to transport the book to the screen. Thus, I defintely feel that it deserves a weak three star rating and is neither the masterpiece that some reviewers considered it to be or totally lacking in merit as other reviewers have indicated.

Admittedly, there were some delightful visual tidbits that almost made the film worth seeing.  The imagery was clever.  However, the film story possessed none of the wit, whimsy or intelligence of the written story.  It made no sense.

The movie is great example of culture shock, and the plot is complex. So much MORE could have been done with this film, especially the dialog.

1958641,2,B0000WST6A,"Had I not been watching LE DIVORCE with my wife, who seemed marginally entertained, I would likely have walked out.
As the film opens, American Isabel Walker (Kate Hudson) is passing through Immigration at Charles DeGaulle Airport in Paris. She's in town to stay with her newly pregnant sister, Roxeanne (Naomi Watts), who's married to Frenchman Charles-Henri de Persand (Melvil Poupaud). Unfortunately, Isabel literally arrives at her sister's residence just as Charles is leaving his wife for another woman. He departs in the same cab that deposits his sister-in-law on the doorstep.
As it turns out, Charles is having an affair with Magda, a married Russian girl. Charles wants a divorce; Roxeanne doesn't. Charles comes across as a real piece of bandini. Rather than provide her sister with support, or maybe even just scratch Charles's eyes out, Isabel starts her own affair with fifty-something Edgar (Thierry Lhermitte), an uncle to Charles on his mother's side.
The apparent point of this film is to spotlight the differing French and American cultural attitudes towards marriage, sex, divorce, and extra-marital affairs. (Well, duh!) Is it a comedy or a drama? It's hard to tell, and doesn't succeed at either because, except for Roxeanne (with whom an American audience will perhaps strongly sympathize), there are no engaging characters whatsoever. Moreover, several are absolutely useless to the storyline, e.g. an expatriate American writer played by Glenn Close, her scruffy house painter, Magda's jarringly unpleasant and mentally disturbed husband (Matthew Modine), and the Walker parents (Stockard Channing and Sam Waterston). There's also a superfluous subplot involving an old painting, perhaps by a master, perhaps not, inherited by the Walkers, taken to Paris by Roxeanne, and now being fought over by the Walker and de Persand families, the former wishing to auction it off. Finally, a sequence at the very end of a red handbag floating over the rooftops of the city must be one of the stupidest symbolisms, if that's what it was, ever put on film.
The absolute sole reason I gave two stars to this waste of my time is that it was filmed in beautiful Paris. There's a sequence involving the Eiffel Tower that, for those who haven't visited the structure, is almost as good as being there. Other than that, unless you're wondering whatever happened to Leslie Caron (who plays Charles's mother), or are a rabid fan of Kate Hudson, don't bother.

a bit about the french culture.  apparently anglophones think that there's nothing more to les francias than old paintings, wacky deserts, and lingere (bleu, blue BLEU  . . . it's not funny).  shame on us.
i've been to france several times, my wife is fluent in french, and take it from me, all this nonsense about french sophistication about desert and sex really is an embarrasing trivialization.  the most interesting aspect of the french is that they provide a welcome intellectual counter point to AMERICAN power.  we're the powerful and important ones (sadly).

Personally, I was expecting a coming of age story, or rather a quirky divorce tale full of anger, humor and/or revenge, and in all honesty, the storyline fell quite flat. The actors, although a very impressive cast, were awful, the lines seemed forced and the timing of their reactions and commentary towards one another was a few seconds off.
Also, the effort to illustrate French culture was trite and clich&eacute;d. I kept waiting for something slightly interesting to happen (and even invented situations that could happen in my head), and then the movie was over.
Development of the characters was almost completely nonexistent, so you leave the film not really knowing who you just watched, or care at all what happened to them in the slightest bit. Even Kate Hudson's character, Isabelle, who appears the most throughout the film, we know barely anything about (for example-her background, or why she could pick up her life to move in with her sister in Paris). Naomi Watts' performance was equally bland, and although I felt that I should feel empathy towards this abandoned pregnant wife, I couldn't muster up any feeling at all towards her.
Then, towards the end, at a pathetic attempt for drama and suspense, a random suicide, murder, and a few mental breakdowns are thrown in for good measure. But even these are out of the blue, and leave you with a perplexed look of ""why did that happen?"" and ""do i really care that it did?""

While there is a whole lot of eating, drinking and chatting in le Divorce, there is so much more.
I will never forget finding out more than two years ago that James Ivory was set to direct one of the best of the previous year's novels and have not been disappointed by the wait. I could not imagine the film cast, photographed or directed differently and while the adaption  is true to the spirit of the novel, circumstance has left the finished film somewhat more true, more French, more appropriate than the original (Merchant Ivory were forced to rewrite the Euro-Disney scene that featured Cinderella's Castle so as to take place at the Eiffel Tower - an improvement on the original if there ever was one!). I do not want to pick apart the plot any more, but will say that you will adore the film regardless of whether or not you read the book.
With le Divorce, Merchant Ivory have set their name in plaster; a  hundred years from now people will not think of them only as the people who adapted the  Forster novels of a century before to another medium, but what they have always been - truly independent film-makers who produced the sort of films that Hollywood could not and dared not try to make.

Hot Toasty Rag, October 21, 2017

Given the fact that Im neither a Kate Hudson fan nor a Naomi Watts fan, I probably shouldnt have rented this movie expecting to like it. But I love Leslie Caron, and will watch anything shes in. Unfortunately for me, she was in Le Divorce and I had to sit through it.

Kate Hudson goes to France to support her pregnant sister Naomi Watts, whose husband has just left her for another woman. While they battle through a very messy divorce, Kate gets involved with two men, Thierry Lhermitte and Romain Duris, and her callous attitude towards both is very off-putting. Meanwhile, Leslie Caron plays Naomis snobby and cold mother-in-law, and Glenn Close plays an odd author, whose purpose Im still trying to figure out.

There was absolutely nothing about this film I enjoyed, and to be honest, I turned it off and didn't make it all the way through. People who absolutely love France and the French culture, or die-hard Kate Hudson fans might like Le Divorce, but besides that, I cant imagine most people getting through it. Although marketed as a romantic comedy, it actually gets pretty heavy as everyones affairs and issues collide. If you do decide to watch it, against my recommendation, keep an eye out for Sam Waterston, Stockard Channing, Matthew Modine, Bebe Neuwirth, and Stephen Fry in small roles.",1508544000,,1362,4.787234042553192
