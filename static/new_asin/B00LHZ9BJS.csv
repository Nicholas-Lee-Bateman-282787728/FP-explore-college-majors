6487817,4,B00LHZ9BJS,"The series is very well written.
All episodes mean something both for the characters and the story.
If you like superpowers, science-fiction and storytelling this is your series!
Unfortunately, the series doesn't really end, cause it was cancelled at the end of the Second season.
Anyways, every episode is worth watching even if the series doesn't have an end.
So be it!
Just have fun!",1414454400,5,386,4.953846153846154
8666019,5,B00LHZ9BJS,"great series, to bad they didn't make more.",1532995200,,43,4.5
8666020,5,B00LHZ9BJS,"This series does right what you are supposed to do in writing.  Character development.  That is really what is going on in this story line.

The cover to the plot is the super power angle, but it is directly related to who the characters are.  This is not your typical super powered human being show.

This has been and still is one of my favorite shows of all time.  It surely will not disappoint.",1531180800,,398,4.3108108108108105
