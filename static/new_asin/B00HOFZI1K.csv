The storyline is fascinating and almost everyone in the cast deserves an Oscar for their performance. If you like mystery, high drama, twists an turns plot, and a touching ending, this film is for you. By the way, my copy plays on my regular DVD machine without a problem.",1396569600,,446,4.247058823529412
