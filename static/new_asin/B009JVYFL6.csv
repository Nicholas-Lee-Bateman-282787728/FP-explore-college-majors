Kept my interest and kept me guessing until the end. The acting was average was when you see this movie was filmed by actual scientist and people working in Antarctica it wasn't that bad. I would recommend this movie to people who like slasher films with a mystery involved.",1440028800,,433,4.551282051282051
8542293,4,B009JVYFL6,"The movie blends elements of dramatic character study with classic horror slasher in one dark story of afflictions of the mind and isolation. It is a pretty well written story with a classic yet modern spin to the traditional horror tale of man facing the psychotic monster that is neither otherworldly nor fantastical rather very human and even more dangerous. The setting is similar to other films located in these desolate corners of the earth still untarnished by industrialization only with South Of Sanity the location is very much for real, not set recreations nor faux locations more hospitable. This film was shot and edited entirely on that one mysterious frozen continent lavishing pristine at the bottom of the globe.

 Now for my thoughts on the film. First I set down not really expecting much and as I began this somber tale I almost felt justified in that notion. The movie starts in that melancholia state that lingers between droll and mundane with the majority of the on screen action belonging solely to dialog and near emotionless human interaction. That was only for the first 20 minutes though and I was pleasantly surprised by the movies ability to slap me out of my discontent with how simple and yet sadistic the murders transpire. No big fanfare or instrumental sounds to herald in the horror.

 This film as you might tell from my language moves in a rather slow and steady pace almost right up to the very end. Just a warning to anyone seeking heavy thrills or insane gore that this film will not hit that g-spot for you. However the movie is straight up chilling in delivering a great unknown masked slasher that is unapologetic and brutal in his systematic method of execution of the characters. When the killer is on screen it almost snaps you back to the glory days of horror with deranged killers that seem to have no love or remorse what so ever. The film gives a gradual rise in climax toward the end of the film and holds your attention until the final moment when the killer is realized. That scene already has me wondering if we will see him again maybe in the Galapagos or South America some where.",1433462400,,2138,4.678191489361702

8542297,5,B009JVYFL6,"Bravo! This homage to John Carpenter will be viewed by all winter-overs
on the ""Ice"" during the station closing parties across the continent.  Considering
this film is made by fellow W/O's who had to endure those long dark months like
the rest of us it establishes a unique pathos in the contemporary horror genre.
The general public really has no idea of the sociological, and psychological strain
one endures as a W/O at a small station, during, or after.
  This brilliant amateur cast and crew supply a nostalgic conduit taking former W/O's
back to those dark days. Cheers mate.

8542298,5,B009JVYFL6,"...In a good way.
It really helps to know that the scientists filming this movie were actually cut off from the rest of the world during the Antarctic winter. It adds a genuine sense of isolation.
In fact, I thought it presented far more dread than ""The Thing"" prequel.",1367712000,2,269,4.510204081632653
8542299,5,B009JVYFL6,What a movie. It's all that is good about a fictional documentary! Very realistic and very scary. If like to be scared out of your mind I recommend this movie!,1364169600,2,159,4.333333333333333
8542300,5,B009JVYFL6,I thought the production value for this movie was amazing for being a low budget indie film! The acting was great!,1362873600,,114,4.476190476190476
8542301,3,B009JVYFL6,"it was interesting. these are not actual actors but people who were wintering over at the ice and then, only those that were willing to participate. therefore, the acting isn't the greatest and it's about halfway between a documentary and a horror flick. some of the horror parts were scary and the gore stuff was reasonably well done. I found myself wishing I had watched ""the Thing"" instead but it was nice to see this and know it was really filmed at their base.",1353024000,4,465,4.5476190476190474
