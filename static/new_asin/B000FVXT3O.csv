While there was a American remake, Hollywood wouldn't dare have the cahones to make a film like this in today's Politically Correct world. Kids in danger, robbing banks, kids using curse words? Nope.  But the story was solid, well paced, and Ida did what she did out of love.

Note to parents-this movie has  f-bombs by the kids throughout, but it's not worse what you would hear on a middle school playground every day, in fact, they have probably heard worse.  Ignore/downplay the language and let kids see what a ""good"" kids movie is really like. One that doesn't talk down or preach to kids. One that doesn't  show adults as idiots. It also shows, which is the truth, that kids are far more attentive and alert that they get credit for.",1394323200,3,783,4.557142857142857

8293018,5,B000FVXT3O,"This is the original version of ""Catch That Kid.""  It is so much better than the U.S. version remake that there is little to compare.  The young actors are better and more believable, although the U.S. version does make the ending a bit more plausable - though not a whole lot different.  Julie Zangenberg is an incredible actress, and the two boys are also quite good.  For U.S. viewers - if you can put up with subtitles - this DVD is well worth the money.",1198281600,7,458,4.352941176470588
