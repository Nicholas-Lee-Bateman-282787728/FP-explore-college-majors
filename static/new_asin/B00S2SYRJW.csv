6950582,4,B00S2SYRJW,"When I was in high school, there was a punk rock band that made a video called ""Scrape.""  It showed skateboarders who fall off their boards and rip off patches of skin.  I hate to have schadenfreude, but the video was quite entertaining.  Here you see all kinds of things fall into sinkholes.  One woman fell into a sinkhole that seemed like she was the only thing that could fit inside it.  The lives lost and property ruined based on sinkholes is tragic.  I wouldn't wish it on any person or property owner.  Having said that, visually it's fascinating.
I'm not a science person, but this work made the science behind these mysteries interesting.  The computer graphics were phenomenal.  I didn't have to be a trained geologist to understand what was going on.
This work focuses a lot on Florida.  However, it also covers Spain and shows a map suggesting there are sinkholes all over the planet.  Thus, this is not the result of capitalism or financial greed.  Nevertheless, it mentions how ppl pass the buck.  Homeowners don't want to tell potential buyers that a house is on a sinkhole.  Developers don't want to tell potential buyers that a neighborhood is dangerous either.  Still, luckily not every one or government is indifferent.  Sometimes whole communities do relocate based on common sense or choice.  People don't just turn a blind eye to this huge problem.
This would be great to show to a high school or junior high science class.  There's no blaming Democrats or Republicans, but there's also no suggesting it's witchcraft or a curse.  I really appreciated having viewed this.",1422835200,5,1593,4.8118081180811805
8697041,5,B00S2SYRJW,"This is really great.  I wish I was a geologist.  All the various topographies fascinate me,  but especially karst. This documentary is informative enough to help people begin to take steps to better protect themselves by knowing some of what to seek out and what to avoid when choosing property to purchase.  Watch the documentary,  collect sinkhole maps,  and know what to look for in order to make the best choices when buying property in Florida or in other sinkhole-prone areas of the world.",1513468800,,496,4.845238095238095

8697047,5,B00S2SYRJW,Arrived on time and in excellent condition. Extremely eyeopening as to just how oblivious I was to just how they form and where how many locations could be susceptible to these and areas they are located which most people would never think of. It was very through  in both how they are formed and most of the locations where there located while they even say their understanding and locating them is still evolving. All in all very factual information and displayed examples as well the science behind this phenomenon in a very entertaining way as with the serious under tone that it is. I recommend this movie especially for the science buffs as well the serious minded. I recommend the seller for the source to obtain the video from.,1448755200,,735,4.6976744186046515

They can occur suddenly and catastrophically.  They have swallowed cars, animals, and people.  They have destroyed homes. And for an unlucky few they have become graves.  These are sinkholes.

All across the globe, enormous sinkholes have cracked the Earths surface like an eggshell, devouring every type of terrain with a destructive force that defies imagination.  In Louisiana, a 40-acre monster [sinkhole] has been consuming the bayou for two years.  In Spain, sinkholes are cracking apart historic towns and leaving others in ruins.  And in Florida, a sinkhole becomes on familys worst nightmare.

Why is the ground under our feet collapsing?  What dangers lurk beneath the surface?  Whose home will be next?

They above is the introduction of this fascinating documentary about sinkholes.

What are sinkholes?  They are a growing worldwide hazard that occurs whenever the underlying bedrock is composed of water-soluble rocks.  It is this type of bedrock that underpins the topsoil or ground and has the potential of forming a hazardous sinkhole either gradually or suddenly if the ground gives way.

There is good use of dramatic archival film footage, animation, and pictures.

Throughout this documentary, there are brief comments made by hydrologists, engineers, geologists, eyewitnesses of catastrophes, etc.  I found that the narration was quite good.

Finally, we get to follow scientists as they explore the underlying forces behind these natural disasters.

In conclusion, there is a growing worldwide hazard that is occurring worldwide that may give you that sinking feeling.  This hazard is called sinkholes.  This documentary allows you to understand them and the destruction they can bring.
