1834534,5,B00008CMR2,"Jack Palance was great in this movie.  A side of Palance's acting not often seen in his movies.  A good western with a life story that never ends, no matter what era it portrays.",1418083200,,178,4.205882352941177

1834537,4,B00008CMR2,"Jack Palance portrays a reformed gunfighter trying to live down his past and forge a relationship with his bitter son (played by Anthony Perkins) all-the-while being tracked down by a gang of killers out to test his reputation.
Neville Brand,Lee Van Cleef,Claude Akins and Elisha Cook are fitting as the stalking gang. Another must have for us 50s Westerns fans.",1274400000,,362,5.05

1834539,3,B00008CMR2,"Jacob Wade (Jack Palance) used to be a celebrated shootist just stepping into middle age and mortally weary of having to be asked to leave every town he rides into... To make matters worse, a few notorious outlaws, led by the vile King (Neville Brand), are also out to take him down...

Now he tries to do something for his boy Riley (Anthony Perkins) by catching and breaking mustangs in Echo Canyon, the best wild horse country in the territory...

Complicating the situations further is Jacob's bad relationship with a kid who hates him, and Ada Marshall (Elaine Aiken), a young woman whom Jacob met in a gambling hall, and shot a man on account of her...

Here is a thinking person's Western that deals with one ex-gunman who also is unable to shake his past and whose ultimate goal for taking root again is by lynching...

Levin shows a dark, depressing, and sadly realistic face of the west... In fact, the entire movie is a drama of characters... But watching the film, you would be able to feel how Levin equates victory with redemption...",1162684800,2,1047,4.643243243243243
1834540,4,B00008CMR2,"When we think of Jack Palance today, we often think of him as a bad guy, like in Batman or Shane. But back in the Fifties, he played a variety of roles, quite a few of them sympathetically.

And one of his best starring roles came in this film, about a gunfighter trying to live down his past, and build a relationship with his estranged son, played by Anthony Perkins. To complicate matters, Palance is going blind, which he keeps a secret from almost everyone, and he is also being pursued by a revenge-minded gambler, played by Neville Brand, who was shot by Palance some time back.

This is a beautifully filmed, poignant Western that deserves to be seen.",1107993600,6,659,4.529411764705882
1834541,5,B00008CMR2,"In this western, the only real format to aficianados, Jack Palance displays every ability expected of the finest actors.  He is gracious, honest, even having been one of the bad guys.  He is courageous to a fault, facing down a number of bad people at once at terrible odds.  He even rates a traitors loyalty.
This movie is a must-see if you liked ""SHANE"", and are tired of ""RIO BRAVO"" reruns, but like the genre.
Someone in those days actually knew all the classic elements of a good story, and it's obvious when you see this flick.  Todays special effects, with bullets whizzing by, would be the only possible improvement for this film.  Don't miss it if you like westerns!!!",992908800,21,677,4.608333333333333

7981408,2,B00008CMR2,Just saw this last night on Encore Western. Jack Palance looked way too old here in 1957. Anthony Perkins seemed uncannily passive as his son. He showed no emotion at the end of the film when his dad is shot dead. The girl who lives with Palance isn't given enough of a reason to stay with him. A really weird situation. Have no idea why Lee Van Cleef was cast in this. He had only one line in the film.  With all the shooting in the film the town is like a ghost town. No one seems to live there. Not worth watching more than once. Very dull story line.,1515542400,,554,4.036363636363636
7981409,4,B00008CMR2,"This is a good well-acted black and white western. Jack Palance plays a gun fighter who after fourteen years of killing many men returns to settle down and help his son. Antony Perkins plays the son who does not want to reunite with his dad because he believes Palance mistreated and abandoned his mother who committed suicide. Palance takes Perkins to a shack where he hopes to finally settle down with his mistress and his son and raise horses. The mistress is closer in age to Perkins than to Palance and Perkins falls in love with her.
Palance is not allowed to settle in peace. In one instance six gunmen come to take his horses and he must get involved in a gunfight with them, six against one, with one holding a pistol to the head of his son.
Palance had in the past taken his mistress from a gambler and shot him, but the shot did not kill him. The gambler has come back for revenge and Palance must now engage in a shootout against four men. Beside the problem with odds, Palance is losing his sight and can only see haziness.",1502150400,2,1036,4.373056994818653

*Plot and ending analyzed*

A few scenes come to mind in The Lonely Man (1957), a unique Western. It has Jack Palance, as a misunderstood gunfighter. Jack Palance's physique matches his laconic attitude. We don't know whether he truly is evil at heart, or a killer. We believe it at first, but then, we see that he is nothing but a fragile human who is going blind. He exists in the wild West where men will kill you for nothing. He has merely defended himself.

Townspeople want him out of their town, a few rivals want him dead. Anywhere he goes, he is treated like a pariah.

Jack Palance wants to find his son (Anthony Perkins) before it is too late. Anthony Perkins doesn't want anything to do with him, but goes with him nonetheless. When they get to a town, Anthony Perkins wants to simply go to eat, but Jack Palance says, ""A man first takes care of his horse."" That scene to me is stupendous, it is what makes Westerns so good. A cowboy who knows the ways of the West.

Elisha Cook Jr., Neville Brand, Lee Van Cleef, Claude Akins and Denver Pyle are just a few familiar Western actors in the film. This is a nice character study.",1493251200,,1180,4.36986301369863
7981411,3,B00008CMR2,good but not that good,1458086400,,22,3.6
7981412,4,B00008CMR2,This is a western about revenge and redemption. A good basic plot and a very young Anthony Perkins pre-Psycho movie which probably helped get him famous but ruined him for bigger acting venues. Pretty good acting by Palance and Perkins.,1444953600,,236,4.925
