1333351,2,B00003TKFD,"With inept acting, horrible casting and schlocky attempts at portraying new technology that blurs the lines between what's real and what ain't. this series is to the point of almost being 'so bad it's good'. It's weird to be taken back to a time when the influence of something like Twin Peaks could be felt in the surrounding and less successful TV shows of the era. This could easily be described as a mix of Twin Peaks and something like Strange Days, but without the effect or power of either one. I had really high hopes for this after seeing the marvelous Map to the Stars which was also written by Bruce Wagner.

This does fit into the long standing tradition of digging deeper into the Occult layers of Los Angeles. It has elements of Noir with a modern science fiction edge, but like stated before, describing what this movie is attempting to do and what it actually does are unfortunately two very different things.",1430006400,2,925,4.606060606060606
1333352,4,B00003TKFD,"There are times when a television show is way ahead of it's time and not appreciated during it's original airing. I would put Wild Palms in this category.  The film is an easy one to explain (set in the near future, two political groups, the ""friends"" and the ""fathers"" are fighting for control) but a hard one to explain well (there are some shadow groups within groups, working to control virtual reality television, the internet, drugs, etc.........see what I mean?)  But I have to say, I loved Wild Palms when it first came out and even more now that several of the ideas presented in the show's future have come true, especially the rise of the internet. If you just note that Wild Palms is more like an opera than a TV show similar in style to David Lynch's Twin Peaks, then assuming you liked Twin Peaks, you should like this. Enjoy.",1426464000,2,840,4.519736842105263

1333355,3,B00003TKFD,"My memories of seeing this series originally on TV egged me on to order a copy. You know, the production is burdened by ""cutting edge"" CGI circa 1993. The actors and directors give it their all, but GAD! A simple actioner of today like ""G.I. Joe"" wipes the floor with ""Wild Palms,"" which is a shame. Old high school romances tend to disappoint.
Unfortunately, disc 2 plays, but it looks awful: spotty on the shiny side and blurry on the print side. Quality control fell through chez MGM. Hope you have better luck!",1400630400,2,514,4.537634408602151
1333356,5,B00003TKFD,"Like many other fans, I taped this off TV when it first aired, and did not get around to watching it until 10 years later. I absolutely love this mini-series. Over the years I have re-watched it numerous times, and I still love it. I haven't read the comic it was based on yet, so I can't compare the two, but the series is top-notch. This series is almost a made for TV version of The Matrix, and while it is a bit dated in some ways, it is still very cutting edge in others. As a neo-noir storyline, it incorporates influences as far reaching as technology, corruption, and scientology. Granted, the quasi-religious movement in the series is called syntheotics, but there are many parallels to scientology.
I found the series to be well-written, the performances honest and convincing, and the dialogue very natural with the exception of a few puns. I'm sure not everyone will like the series, but I for one was thrilled to find it available on DVD.

1333371,2,B00003TKFD,"unless you are a critic and have to review the early 90s  ""virtual reality"" craze, or have to research early Kathryn Bigelow/Oliver Stone works, don't pay money for this.  Actually, no one should have to pay money to watch this, and I'm sorry I did. Watching this reminds me of a thought that creeped up on me through many, many 90s movies and TV shows, and finally became a moment of clarity:  James Belushi is a terrible actor. He should never be given a leading role, never again.  Watch instead Bigelow's ""Strange Days"", a good and peculiar movie about virtual reality with the same themes as this show but superior in every way.",1363996800,,633,4.575221238938053

1333374,5,B00003TKFD,The sheer resonant breadth and depth of this project is breathtaking. It blew me away when I saw it first on TV and it still blows me away.  Vaguely reminiscent of Russell Hoban's book Riddley Walker by sheer coincidence in terms of it's structure and revelatory power. This is a story that reveals it's layers slowly - becoming more and more powerful and deeply interwoven with each passing minute. An amazing premonition of the political climate we are just starting to enter now... I can't recommend this enough.,1303689600,,515,4.8522727272727275
1333375,2,B00003TKFD,"My Girlfriend and I just finished the last episode, and this was a horrible *horrible* show.  A lot of motivations go unexplained, the acting is bad -especially Belushi, who has no range whatsoever.  The actors try to convince you that your looking at a world rife with cultural, spiritual and political tension, but it just doesn't work.  You don't feel it at all.

It's painfully obvious someone wanted to make their own version of Twin Peaks but failed.  I have to commend the effort, but to give this series anything above 3 stars is ludicrous.  Only watch this movie if you want to yell at James Belushi for 5 hours.",1266969600,,621,4.6
1333376,5,B00003TKFD,"I'm not going to comment on the actual series... except to say that I enjoyed ""Wild Palms"" very much, having missed out when it was first broadcast.
The video quality is acceptable (you'll just have to live with the fact that this was made when 4/3 TV was the norm), but don't expect too much on the audio side. You're only getting 192 kbps stereo AC3 sound; though let's remember this was a TV production.",1266105600,2,406,4.426666666666667

1333378,3,B00003TKFD,"What's there to say about Wild Palms that hasn't been said a hundred times before?

With that, I'll stick to the DVD itself: despite the back proudly proclaiming ""High Definition Transfer"", the picture quality is pretty bad. I'm not sure what the master was on this, but there's a lot of color bleeding, and a lot of blur -- more than the intentional soft focus that many scenes were shot it.

The picture itself is 4:3, which isn't completely unexpected, given that this was a miniseries... but it's disappointing nonetheless. And unfortunately, the audio was a bit neglected, as well.

For the price, I can't really complain. But since I own the VHS set and the Australian import DVD set, there wasn't very much to gain here.

Since so many people draw parallels with Twin Peaks, I can say that the picture and sound quality of the Twin Peaks DVD's are incredible by comparison. David Lynch showed a LOT of love on those. Sadly, Wild Palms seems unloved by MGM and Oliver Stone.",1207526400,3,980,4.6473988439306355
1333379,5,B00003TKFD,"Oliver Stone's dark take on cyberspace, computers and the tech future. Again, the familiar thread of conspiracies, forces at work that want to change and control the world fighting the forces that want to help and save humanity. Sound familiar? Well, it's a thread that runs through the history of storytelling from the Greeks in their plays, Hans Christen Anderson in his fairy tales and George Lucas' stories in Starwars. This series is a bit long and involved. Take it in small doses, a chunk at a time over several nights or an entire weekend when you have the time. After watching this movie, reaffirm the light in the world by going out to the beach and enjoying yourself or something equally life-force invigorating like a family get together.",1205712000,4,750,4.821705426356589
1333380,4,B00003TKFD,"I first discovered Wild Palms in the back of Details magazine in the early 90s. I had a college roommate at the time who liked Details; I just liked the comic :). Anyway I was intrigued by the comic and read it every month.

In 93 I was again surprised, this time when I found out that what I thought was a little-known comic was now an Oliver Stone miniseries. I found it engrossing in a the-world-sucks-and-it-oughta-end-but-just-wont-and-religion-sucks-william-gibson way, which was right up my alley then and still is today.

Buy it if you like Gibson or cyberpunk or any sci-fi that's more-or-less set today, slightly in the future, and shows reality for the crap that it really is. Really! I'm not making this up!

1333401,5,B00003TKFD,Very good example of modern film noir that leaves you gessing even after it's over. A brilliant blending of different eras to create a timeless setting as compelling as it is surreal.,1192147200,,183,4.75
1333402,3,B00003TKFD,"Here's a show exec-produced by Oliver Stone, one of the great conspiracy theorists of our times, and in the vein of Philip K. Dick as washed through the sensibilities of David Lynch. While ostensibly about mind control, political extremism, shadow cults and rich people wearing ties outside of their collars (apparently the new fashion in this ""alternate reality"" of the 90s), It's really a film noir exercise in merging American culture, especially Los Angeles culture, with Japanese tech sensibilities. Sometimes it works, sometimes it's a muddle.

Jim Belushi notably remarked that after reading the script several times that he had absolutely no idea what the film was about and he just showed up every day and read his lines. After watching myself, I can understand...it's a very confusing story, assisted by the fact that for at least half of every episode some or all of the characters are tripping on the mind-control techniques that are the heart of the show. Who knows whether an important plot point is real or invented by the villains? We certainly don't.

The good news is that if you like near-future paranoid conspiracies with likeable actors, Wild Palms is kinda fun to watch. Jim Belushi is pretty good as a lawyer thrust into a shadowy world he has no idea how to navigate, Robert Loggia chews up his scenes like nobody's business, and Angie Dickenson is the supreme corporate bitch-queen. Largely wasted are Dana Delaney, an '80s icon who never exceeded the heights she reached in ""China Beach,"" and Ernie Hudson, who put his wry, world-weary act to better use in ""The Crow."" Brad Dourif was firmly in the grip of his brilliant-but-mentally-crippled phase after making his name in ""One Flew Over The Cookoo's Nest"" and losing it again with ""The Wall."" Sure some of the dialog and plotlines are clunky, but at least they move the story forward. For those of us raised on sci-fi, the idea of projected holograms and drug-induced virtual reality a l Star Trek TNG's Holodeck was pretty enticing, though, and the hidden agenda infighting was fun to chew on.

The bad news is that this DVD set is dreary. The transfer is muddy and dark, colors never pop, everything's too red and there's no shadow detail whatsoever, and besides it's 4:3 not widescreen. Honestly, I'd believe the studio dubbed this off a VHS tape if I didn't know better. There are no extras to speak of; the most you can say for the video is that there aren't any commercials to interrupt the show.

Interesting side note: Kathryn Bigelow, whose next film was the equally paranoid ""Strange Days"" (which was produced by Alien-lover Jim Cameron and had similar themes of drug-induced VR) directed the last episode of the series.",1192147200,5,2708,4.880434782608695

I can't quite compare this to Twin Peaks since that was a different genre, but definitely a gutsy attempt.  This dealt with virtual reality pre-Matrix.  The pop cultural references (and the satirical ones too) are on mark.  Unfortunately, the DVD can't erase Belushi's strained acting performance (easily the weakest link here).  This is an underrated and overlooked charm.  If you consider yourself a frequent watcher of SCI-FI channel programming, this is definitely worth checking out.

Oliver stone, riding high from JFK fame, wrote the story to this one.  James Belushi plays the main character, which was a choice that still boggles my mind.  The series was plenty long, but not to drug out. It to me seemed choppy on exactly how many months/years the series took place over. And for some reason everybody let Belushi go instread of just killing him or locking him away. The ending did leave the series open to interpretation, I thought the friends had won, but it sounds like he was going to fight more of the fathers, and did the senator die, or is he in cyberspace and we not find out yet.  Stone did well with the small screen format. A good piece of TV history, and catchy to rewatch periodically and see if any other clues are noticed.

Yes, cyberpunk.  Only a few years before the internet really spread in the world, ""Wild Palms"" was exploring virtual reality and other addicting technologies in this dystopia of a future.

1333466,1,B00003TKFD,Getting this mess to the screen had to be a conspiracy! This waste of time features miscasting: Belushi as the lost lead;overacting:Loggia as a demonic something;wasted talent:Delany as a sometimes confused and sometimes heroic(?)missing person from the plot and Cattrell seemingly searching desperately for the person that gave her that silly hair. I like these actors. What a shame they were involved in this unfortunate [film].,1015372800,,430,5.53030303030303

1333469,5,B00003TKFD,"The Wild Palms Mini Series first aired a few years ago, it was made for TV and it is based on the comic strip by the same name that appeared in Details Magazine in the early 90's. Its main audience was Generation X'ers,  but I've heard that the comic strip became very popular with  aging  hippies, potheads, and the ""underground"" in general because of  its offbeat pace and cerebral content.  I taped it off the TV when it first  aired and have watched it many, many times. I will definitely buy it on DVD  when it comes out. The film stars Jim Belushi as Harry Wyckoff; Dana  Delaney as Grace, his wife; Angie Dickinson as Josie, Grace's mother;  Robert Loggia as Senator Tony Kreutzer, Josie's brother; and a few others  like Kim Catrall,  Bebe Newirth , and Ernie Hudson.
Wild Palms is a story  that takes place in the year 2065, and shows how technology has advanced to  the point of being at the verge of making hollographic images physically  interactive with human beings. Senator Kreutzer is about to launch a new  sitcom on Channel 3 called Church Windows which will project the characters  into people's living rooms. It will make people ""feel"" like part  of the TV program. The dark side of the plan is that in order for people to  interact with the hollograms, they have to take the drug MIMIZINE.  Prolonged use of the drug has a side effect...it causes the user to see  hallucinations of cathedrals and churches and it is ultimately fatal. But  Senator Kreutzer wants the whole world to get hooked on hollographic TV for  his own purposes, but you'll have to watch the film to find out what that  is.
Wild Palms is the first major production concerning VIRTUAL REALITY,  though there was a kind of predecessor in TRON and in other lesser known  films. The concept of VR has been used in movies again and again since Wild  Palms in varying degrees of benevolence and malevolence (e.i. THE LAWNMOWER  MAN, VIRTUOSITY, THE MATRIX), but when Wild Palms first came out the idea  of VR was pretty fresh and open to exploration. The premise of VR is that  human beings can communicate, interact, copulate, and in essence live and  die in VR which is an extension of the real world within a network of  computers (like the internet).
The conflict in Wild Palms begins with  Senator Kreutzer, he is the founder of a group called ""The  Fathers"" who epitomize capitalism and right-wing, traditional politics  (their corruption notwithstanding). Their antagonists are ""The  Friends"" whose founder is a political prisoner named Eli Levitz. Eli  used to be married to Josie...their daughter is Grace.
Chickie Levitz  (played by Brad Douriff) has the secret to the GO CHIP, which is the thing  that will allow Senator Kreutzer to achieve his final goal once everyone is  hooked into the Church Windows Sitcom.
Throughout the film there's  betrayal, seduction, incest, murder, and torture. None of it is overly  graphic as it is not a ""gore"" film as such. The atmosphere of  fear and impending doom is created more by what it implies than by what it  shows. Like when Josie pokes the eyes out the artist. Not much is shown in  the way of gore, but the scene is pretty disturbing.... Later in the film, as  he prepares for revenge ,he says to Josie, ""...once I was a painter, and  mixing colors was my joy..."", he then pokes her eyes out, and as she's  screaming on the floor he shoots her a number of times.
The film is very  textural and warbles in and out of psychological focus. It mixes Oriental  mysticism, politics, philosophy, hi-tech drugs, and the American Dream in a  mish-mash so weird, you just have to watch it to understand it. Many of the  scenes are reminiscent of Peter Greenaway films (a.i. A Zed and Two  Noughts, Drowning by Numbers, etc.)",957312000,82,3758,4.659541984732824
