2703156,4,B000LC52EG,"Saw this listed and thought it might be interesting. Then I saw that Mark Harmon was the Tuareg and would never have thought it of him for this role. But he does a pretty good job of it! The movie itself seems a little spaghetti Italian but it is still rather interesting.

I like the attempts at showing the cultural customs in this movie. There is nothing fancy about it, the filming is so-so but the plot is good. Would I watch it again? Probably not, unless they do a re-master of this.",1379116800,3,490,4.268817204301075

2703160,4,B000LC52EG,"At 62, I hate to waste my time also, ... but, one man's onion may be another man's rose. Sometimes, great books require the persistence of 30 or 40 pages before they really start getting interesting. If the other reviewer had persisted for 16 minutes, he might have found the movie slightly more interesting and not so much a waste of time. Granted, Italian movies, even with American stars such as Mark Harmon, can still be a little off beat, but a country that produced Sophia Loren and Claudia Cardinale can't be all bad, ... and neither is this movie. It has a very interesting plot and story line, with a bizarre twist included. The acting was probably directed to represent the culture presented in this movie, one which has a sense of honor and laconic stoicism juxtaposed to tyrannical barbarism. I found the movie very interesting and gave it 4 stars.",1365206400,20,860,4.6644736842105265
2703161,5,B000LC52EG,Enzo G. Castellari directs this action masterpiece. The action is over-the-top in the highly original Castellari style. The music is EPIC.  If you are an Enzo. G. Castellari fan or a fan of Italian exploitation and action this will be right up your alley. My copy was 2.25.1 WIDESCREEN. It looked and sounded great.

2703307,3,B000LC52EG,"Not a bad movie right up to the terrible ending which made the entire movie pointless.  I suppose that the director was trying to be artsy rather than be satisfied with making an enjoyable movie.  Mark Harmon is pretty good as the desert warrior bound by tradition and his own idea of honor.  There really is no point to the movie except for these two things.  I too believe in honor and tradition but they are not enough to make the movie fun to watch.  Particularly, when in the end, his peculiar idea of honor negates almost everything he has done.",1455062400,,551,4.415841584158416

2703400,2,B000LC52EG,"Buried in a slew of pretty horrible movies on a 30-film disc set, this turkey isn't quite as bad as the others. Interesting to watch a film where Mark Harmon wears more makeup than the rest of the cast, though the beard may be real. Fake mustaches abound. If you're wondering about the quality of this film, here's a hint: Mark's name has been wiped from the credits. Sorry, buddy, we still recognize you. The plot is strange with a very strange twist at the end. Acting is on par with standard B movie fare, tons of dubbing. Mark's face is covered by a veil in many shots, which I'm sure makes dubbing pretty darn easy! It's an Italian picture. One wishes they had some tomatoes at the ready.",1442361600,,693,4.37984496124031

2703402,4,B000LC52EG,"I have to admit this goes against everything I know of the Tuareg tribe of Morocco and the North African deserts. They were called the Purple Men, because the dye used in their purple turban and robes gradually melded with their complexions. Their reputation is one of thieves and bandits, but this hero wears black, sticks closely to the Muslim principle of the ""guest"" which demands hospitality and protection to anyone seeking it. Some of the exploits are more typical of a Hollywood superhero. It is fiction based on a genuine Muslim principle, and generally well-acted and directed.",1439596800,,587,5.0
2703403,4,B000LC52EG,"A solid movie, reflecting a more classic era of Italian cinema.

Mark Harmon (NCIS's Gibbs) depicts Racel Sayah, a Tuareg chieftain in an Italian production of Spanish novelist Alberto Vzquez-Figueroa's novel of the same name. Two men stumble into his camp out of the desert, and he gives them shelter. They are shortly pursued by members of an unidentified North African military, who demand their guests. This insults Tuareg hospitality, and Racel Sayah refuses, but the military responds with force, and he surrenders, only to promptly pursue them to rescue his guest, who is revealed to be the first president of this new republic.

And so on.

The tension between the aspirations of the new government and the ancient traditions of the aloof Tuareg is at the heart of this movie. More subtly, and more pressingly, we see the conflict between Racel Sayah's inflexibility and the demands of the changing times.

It was a pleasant watch, and sufficiently cerebral for what it is. It makes me believe the book is worth reading, also.",1436918400,2,1034,4.959537572254336
2703404,3,B000LC52EG,This is kind of interesting if you want to see Leroy Jethro Gibbs as a Tuareg warrior.,1436745600,,86,4.117647058823529

2703456,5,B000LC52EG,"This was an interesting movie. I likes it and decided to purchase both the dvd and streaming. If you like 13th warrior, Soldier of God and the movies that have an unlikely hero or heroes you will enjoy this movie.
And see the same quiet character displayed in Mark Harmon's Gibbs, with more physical action.",1407715200,,307,4.6
2703457,4,B000LC52EG,"For most of the movie the narration was about what it meant to be a Tuareg.  This is fine but I did not see or feel that the plot was centered around this Characters that were Bedouin and an off shoot of the Bedouin culture the Tuareg. The conflict is that the Tuareg do have as much contact with the outside world as their 'Cousins"". They believed the country was still run by the French.  While, in the reality there had been a coup that ousted the French and a second coup that had put they  first popular leader in to exile.  And it is around this that the story turns. The Tuareg Chieftain had under the laws of his people provide to travelers the hospitality of his home and thus the protection that went with it.  The newest leaders were not aware or did not care about the laws of the Tuareg.  Thus the conflict that provides the remainder of the plot of the movie.  Their was little action and some adventure.  Regardless. the concept and story were born.  It became part 'Steinbeck'  and part 'Hemingway'.  over the entire course it is primary monologue and part Narration by which you learn the laws of the Tuareg and the lengths they will go to live up to their laws which stem from the Koran. It is very interesting until the end.  This is where it seems the show could have used another 15 minutes and provide a triumph for following the laws of his people.

Instead, the movie is cut short by an unthinkable action and no consequence that I believe would have been a betrayal of all that this man stands for. Yet he comes home a victor and manages to do so with nothing as the Tuareg are traders and have little or any money. yet he manages to loose on camel and acquire a second and perhaps a third. The acting for a French to English dubbed film, was very good. what was not so good was the direction editing and script.

Still I learned a lot about a people I knew little about and that may not live as they did when this film was made. It was still interesting and rather than subtitles they chose to Dub the film which is my preference.  If I wanted to speed read a book I would.  Subtitles are too fast for an action film you miss the cinematography when you are forced to read a film.  So my hats off to the distributors of this film for choosing to use voice over.  All-in-all it was a decent film . Just don't expect Action like you find in Star Wars or even or even the music induced anticipation of the Spaghetti Westerns, or the acrobatics of the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time.
