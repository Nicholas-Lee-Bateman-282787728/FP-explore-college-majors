The Shout! release is so different compared to the old Coffin Baby cut. I actually prefer the Coffin Baby version. I found it to be a better movie all around and better music. It had different scenes and a better ending too I think. TBM2 was not bad though, but I was not a fan of the way the story went in that cut. It's pretty nasty at times too. Some very creepy moments and some great special effects work. I would say it's worth watching if you liked the remake. It is very different in tone and story compared to the last one, but a well made movie. TBM2 cut I would give 3/5 I would give the Coffin Baby cut a 4/5. If you can find Coffin Baby though, I would recommend that version over TBM2. Shame they didn't have both cuts on the Shout! bluray.

I also want to mention this dvd of Coffin Baby in the pic is cut. It runs 88 minutes. The bluray version with the same cover also appears cut. The others I have seen are a few minutes longer. You can import the Coffin Baby cut from Germany and other countries. The best version you can get is the Limited Uncut Edition. It has a cool looking cover and also comes in a steel book looking case. From what I can tell it is the complete uncut version and runs 94 minutes. I will post a picture below in this review so people can see the picture of the dvd cover.",1440028800,,1444,4.102473498233215

Hollywood, California is turned upside down by a series of strange and horrific murders creating chaos and turmoil in tinsel town. One particular victim is kidnapped, held captive and subjected to witness the torture and murder of numerous other victims. It is by her will, strength, and faith that she must survive the ordeal.
Other than that we know nothing about the killer or why he chooses his victims etc, there is an open sequence set in the 50's im not really sure what that was all about, jump to present day and most of the movie focuses on the killer tormenting the girl he has kept alive like a pet locked in a cell like cage, she is witness to death after death of victims, and has vile things done to her too, the movie is very graphic with the blood and gore and violence which is what saves it for me, the effects are top notch practical effects, great make-up on the killer, the bloody gory scenes are very frequent throughout the running time of the whole movie which is great if your a gore-hound, the cast was ok, the lead actress isn't too bad, some other characters are a tad pathetic but who cares, this movie is just a display of splatter at the end of the day! Worth checking out if you can pick it up cheap, the German release is uncut, I cant imagine the UK ever getting this uncut.",1429747200,2,1641,4.366013071895424
