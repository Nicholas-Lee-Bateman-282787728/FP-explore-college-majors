3156379,4,B0016H72RU,"it's a great deal getting all three of these films in one box (they each come on their own dvd). Tigerland is an interesting film written by a soldier who wanted to go to viet nam just to write a book, but never makes it out of training. Great acting job by Colin Ferrall, but I'd recommend ""Tribes"" as the stateside viet nam war movie to see.
The Big Red One is an awesome film, and worth getting the collection just for that one.",1260403200,2,431,4.142857142857143

8262462,1,B0016H72RU,"As reported earlier. one of the movies had no sound and I was too lazy to return it. I only wanted one of the three movies, and It was the one with no sound track, The other three had sound, so it was not my player. Look before you leap, caveat emptor, and all that stuff.",1508457600,,272,3.875

8262466,5,B0016H72RU,"BEHIND ENEMY LINES looks as though it was made with all good intentions. I really wanted to like and enjoy it. Because the character motivations were never deeply explored it lacked the essence of what could have made it a good old fashioned stand-up-and-cheer movie. It moved at a lethargic pace. If the character motivations were explored in depth, lethargy would have been replaced with viewer concern and interest and it would have been a much more entertaining film. Only the confrontation between Joaquim de Almeida as Admiral Piquet and Gene Hackman as Admiral Reigart gave this film some character based emotional fiber and substance that it sorely needed. I also thought this made the Hollywood theatrics at the end of the movie were just too unbelievable and out of place. Owen Wilson, Gene Hackman and David Keith do their best with what script they are given. Actualy Joaquim de Almeida, a very underated actor, came out the most memorable and believable.

I found THE THIN RED LINE to be a deep film, very ethereal in nature and liberating as it is disturbing. Director Terrence Malick focuses on the conflict at Guadalcanal from ground up and showing empathy and apathy along the way. Nick Nolte's performance as an over the hill Lieutenant Colonel trying to impress a very shallow and aloof Brigadier Geneneral (John Travolta) is moving. THE THIN RED LINE is a devastating film. The philosophical and psychological nature and the morality of war within that context seems to be present in some form in Terrence Malick's film. I see Nick Nolte as Colonel Tall as the most tragic figure in this film. In some respects he appears to be sacrificing men for the advancement of his own career, but he is sacrificing his own soul in the process trying to impress the high command of a military by delivering the objective. Nolte fails to see that he has been passed over for many years now and if he doesn't get the job done then someone else will.

Director Joel Schumacher's TIGERLAND and his minimalist approach used in this film really work and the term Auteur comes to mind. It is a Vietnam era war film that never leaves the United States. The film focuses on recruit Roland Bozz a rebellious loner who gets released from the stockade and joins a platoon that is sent to Fort Polk, Louisiana where the Tigerland training area is located. Colin Farrell plays Private Roland Bozz. Roland Bozz is a born leader, but he's trouble. Yet like any born leader he can get the job done his way. He is hated and despised by most, but he is a wheel. The Tigerland training area is the last stop before shipping out to Vietnam. The training there is rough and rugged and it replicates the dense and thickly forested jungles of Vietnam. Colin Farrell as Private Roland Bozz is a real standout. He makes friends and enemies. He is a pacifist at heart and he has ways of getting recruits discharged from the army using the system. The training exercises at Tigerland mimic real scenarios and real death is always a possibility. The story, the camaraderie and the tangled web that gets woven, the overall outcome is something to see. This is a great film and totally underrated.",1421625600,,3175,4.729241877256317

Director Terrence Malick focuses on the conflict at Guadalcanal from ground up and showing empathy and apathy along the way. The conversations, the dialogue between Jim Caviezel and Sean Penn is thought provoking, moving. This is a devastating film. THE THIN RED LINE is as Liberating to the senses as is Disturbing.
