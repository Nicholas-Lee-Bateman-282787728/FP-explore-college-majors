8318097,4,B001LIK8FM,"I think this film may disappoint some people.  Although the nudity isn't nonstop, there's some good nude scenes in the film; but it doesn't have as much nudity and sleaze as some as Gemser's other films.  There's a couple of sleazy nude scenes involving Gemser and a crazy photographer, one of which is a sleazy rape scene.  However, most of the nude scenes are more classy than most of the stuff with Gemser and Joe D' Amato; most of it isn't that gratuitous.  The film has a couple elements of horror thrown in.  In one scene Gemser is forced to pose near some dead bodies, and a baby goat is sacrificed near the end of the film; and the film benefits from its Egyptian locations that provide great scenery. I also thought it's very well scored and directed, and the acting is good also. The story involves Gemser who travels around some nice locations in Egypt where she meets a variety of characters; one of these people is Al Cliver who plays a bizarre holy man. Around the beginning parts of the film, Gemser is forced by a photographer to pose near a carcass of a dead dog in the desert. Later on in the film, another horror element is tossed in when that same photographer forces her to pose near a bunch of dead people; this is followed by a sleazy scene when the crazed photographer rapes Gemser. It should be noted that despite Gemser being the star of the film, the movie doesn't always revolve around her; other characters are given ample screen time. The film contains some full nudity from really good looking women, and I really liked the soundtracks that are soothing and peaceful at times and at other times they are energetic and lively. The soundtracks and beautiful locations play a major role in the film, and those tossed in horror elements involving the photographer and the goat help it as well. The problem that some people may have with the movie is that it doesn't have a lot of action, and some people may have wanted more nudity and sleaze. There's an emphasis placed on story, characters, and the films locations to involve the viewer.

The DVD quality looks great.",1350086400,5,2096,4.5611702127659575
8318098,2,B001LIK8FM,"This movie is your average Black Emanuelle outing. I bought it because it has my two favorite soft core (run around naked) actresses. It doesn't go quite as far as Emanuelle In America, but it's better than others. The transition to DVD isn't bad, and it's not as hard to come by as it used to be. I only recommend it if you're  addicted to these two girls.",1275177600,,357,4.25
8318099,4,B001LIK8FM,"I hate to cross swords with the other reviewer, but this is in response to his review. Almost no one (except possibly myself on a good day) watches these flix for any other reason other than to ogle at the flesh on parade, that`s the whole point the producer`s of them realized back in the `60`s - most men will watch ANY type of cinematic swill as long as there`s undraped women in them. Now, we try to hide this fact in the current crop of torture-porn Horror, National Lampoon`s un-bare-ably bad films, late-nite soft-core solutions to insomnia, and all movies w/ Ron Jeremy in them. So it seems a waste to 'justify' or 'redeem' them here, it`s simply a matter of how bad are they? Was there enough nudity involved to get your jollies, abundant enough to hold your attention, were the women attractive enough, could you sit through it again - these are all subjective questions I think most folks want answered when they read these reviews. But he`s right in most of his points - there`s little plot to speak of, but riddle me this, Batman - if you`re a fan of Laura Gemser (check), Annie Belle (check) or Nieves Navarro (check), and there`s copious amounts of nudity, could you do worse? `Know what I`m sayin`? I think you do...",1269388800,4,1232,4.5291479820627805
8318100,1,B001LIK8FM,"Black Emmanuelle, White Emmanuelle (Brunello Rondi, 1976)

There was a time in the mid- to late seventies when Al Cliver was, simply, the luckiest man on the planet. The Egyptian-born actor dated softcore actress Annie Belle, with whom he appears in this picture, during the mid-seventies, while onscreen, he found himself in clothes-less romps with such legendary beauties as Nieves Navarro (also in this flick), Auretta Gay, Annamaria Rizzoli, and, of course the immortal Laura Gemser, one of the most beautiful actresses ever to grace a movie screen. That doesn't make him all that great an actor, though; in general, the smaller his part, the better he is. His part here is relatively small, but that's not enough to save this disturbing flick.

First off, as with many movies that have the Emmanuelle tag attached to them, this flick has no ties to the original film or any of its sanctioned sequels; the original title of the film was Black Velvet, and I assume the Emmanuelle tag was attached because of Gemser's presence. The film, which lacks anything that looks like a plot, follows Laura (Gemser), a fashion model, and her photographer (real-life boyfriend at the time Gabriele Tinti) through their time in Egypt, which involves a photo shoot, then a fight, and Laura going off with a new friend. And, of course, a socftcore scene every ten or fifteen minutes.

It's kind of hard to understand how Rondi could go from working with Fellini to turning out bad erotica. Still, that's what we've got, and it's really only worth watching if you're a rabid fan of one of those involved; depthless characters, plotless script, passionless sex scenes. Altogether awful. *",1242950400,2,1674,4.950177935943061
