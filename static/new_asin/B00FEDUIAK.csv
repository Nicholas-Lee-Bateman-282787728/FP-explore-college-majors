Although I haven't watched all of them yet, what I have seen looks great.  3D is the way to go with this material.  David Attenborough is a terrific narrator.

5979434,5,B00FEDUIAK,"When you watch movie narrated by David Attenborough you  know that it will be excellent one, and all these movies are outstanding. My favorite is micro monsters with unbelievable 3D affects in the micro world. I enjoyed watching all of these movies and will watch them many more times. All three movies have exceptional 3D recording and narrating by David Attenborough make them educational for audience of all ages.",1409961600,7,416,5.028985507246377
5979435,4,B00FEDUIAK,"Excellent and stunning photography. The discs played fine in the region-A (North American) 3D BD player. The shows can also be viewed in 2D by having your 3D-HDTV convert the 3D video to 2D (if it has such a function). None of the programs have any subtitles (disappointing in this day and age) so 1 star is removed. Recommended.

For Micro Monsters, it looks like the producers shot many more creatures than are narrated in the program but they can be very briefly seen in many scenes. I would have liked to see these ""deleted creatures"" since they would have been interesting to see even if no narration was included.

For photography buffs, the depth of field in the shots is just amazing.",1408924800,5,692,4.617886178861789

This set of 3d blue-ray disks blows me away. Already, I've watched the twice. Many great hours of immersive viewing in excellent 3d effects.

5979440,4,B00FEDUIAK,"The 3D camera work is beautiful. The only problem is that none of the bonus material on any of the three 3D discs will play in my Panasonic Blu-ray player (Region 1).  Neither will the ""Making of Kingdom of Plants"" (a 2D disc) play.

 David Attenborough's narration is lucid and his enthusiasm for his subject is infectious.  The 3D disc on plants contains scenes that are not only gorgeous to look at, but also at times pretty scary (with scary-movie music for added pleasure).  You've heard of the Venus Fly-Trap, but seeing it and other plants in 3D interacting with and capturing insects and even a rodent, in scenes that speed up or slow down time, brings a whole new level of excitement for the nature-doc aficionado.  The Galapagos 3D is gorgeous and informative, too.  Micro Monsters was absorbing, but also disturbing and disgusting at times.  It reminded me at times of ""Silence of the Lambs."" Attenborough doesn't sugar-coat the natural world in the way that some nature docs do.

All in all, a very worthwhile purchase.",1508544000,2,1031,4.779661016949152

5979442,4,B00FEDUIAK,"I had trouble deciding how many stars to give this set of video disks, because it is excellent in many ways but it does have flaws.  Lets look at the strong points first.  Above all, the photography is superb.  I have never seen sharper images from my TV and Blu-ray player.  The brightness and contrast are just right and the colors are excellent and vibrant.  The MicroMonsters disk uses magnification to make these scary creatures look big enough to jump out at you.  On top of all of that, the 3D effect is perfectly managed so that the overall effect is total realism.

As if that weren't enough, we have narration by David Attenborough, with his encyclopedic knowledge and infectious enthusiasm.  His narration of the Galapagos disk helps us understand why the creatures on those islands helped Darwin become convinced of mutability of species and evolution by natural selection.

Now for the flaws.  Unlike most of the BBC nature study sets, this one has no subtitles.  On top of that, there is a music track.  It seems to me if they are going to be too niggardly to give us subtitles, it would be more intelligent to save some more money by dispensing with any music.  Attenboroughs diction is pretty clear and the music is not loud, so I missed very little, but there are a few places where his words are obscured by the noise of the music.

Every manufacturer of DVD and Blu-ray disks forces us to sit through several minutes of garbage before we get to the program.  There is the art work of the studio which they think everybody wants to see.  Then there are the warnings intended to terrify us if we were planning to copy the disks.  Then there is the idiotic disclaimer, called for by their lawyers, that the opinions expressed in any interviews are not necessarily the opinions of the Emperor of Japan.  Then they may want to inflict some previews on you.  All DVDs and many Blu-ray disks are made in such a way that if you leave them in the player and turn it off, when you turn it on again it continues where you left off and the garbage is bypassed.  Two of the disks in this set  MicroMonsters and Galapagos  work that way, but the two Plant disks do not.  If you watch the several Plant episodes on separate occasions, you will have to sit through the garbage again each time.

Im not sure the Plant disks should have been included in this set.  Personally, Im not that interested in plants.  Since they don't move around they aren't very interesting to watch, though time-lapse photography is used extensively so you can see how they grow.  There is one main Plant disk and one Making of . . . disk in the set.  I thought the Making of . . . disk, which by the way is not in 3D, was so boring that I skipped most of it.

Since you cant pick and choose, you may well decide that the first two disks on their own are worth the price.  I feel that way.",1506643200,,2870,4.401140684410646

I would like to point out one bit of confusion in the listing for this set, which is actually an error as printed on the back cover of the box set.  Here's how the instructions for watching the 3D content is stated: ""To watch these programmes in Blu-ray 3D, you will need a 3D-capable television that comes with active-shutter glasses and a 3D capable Blu-ray player. This Blu-ray disc will display only in 2D without special hardware.""

My AV system is made up of entirely 'Sony' equipment and my television and glasses are the Passive 3D Polarized version.  The 3D content of this set plays fine and is very impressive.

5979465,5,B00FEDUIAK,"I have practically everything I can get in 3D, but this is by far my favorite thing to watch on it, particularly Micro Monsters 3D. They use their 3D cameras very skillfully to great effect, to show rather dramatic blowups of the arthropods on display. And of course, the direction and narration are as fantastic as you'd expect from David Attenborough.

There are, only very occasionally, cases where 2D content is used that has been ""3D-ified"". Most people don't even seem to notice when this happens, but I'm sensitive to it. They'll either take 2D content and ""inset it"" in 3D, so that it's a 2D image that appears to be further back than your screen, or in some cases they apply a general and arbitrary 3D effect to it (like your TV does when you tell it to go into ""fake 3D"" mode when you're viewing 2D content). They just do this in a few ""filler"" instances that last a few seconds, and it's likely you won't notice - all the primary material (the vast majority of content) was recorded with 3D equipment and not ""fake 3D""

Anyway, it's not enough to remove a star for, and as I said, this is far and away the best content you can get for your 3DTV. Seriously, buy this collection. I also just discovered ""The 3D Collection: Volume II"", and you can be sure I'll be getting that too.",1468454400,3,1289,4.411764705882353

5979467,2,B00FEDUIAK,"It is greatly disappointing to view David Attenborough's 3D Collection.

He presents a direct and clear narrative for some of the best stereoscopic nature photography I have ever seen.
The macro and microscopic stereo images are especially beautiful and profound.

All that excellent work is wrecked by a disc compression that appears to be too low, resulting in poor resolution.
The lack of definition is most noticeable when looking at pebbles, sand, or harsh textures.

Another let down is due to many 3D shots displaying heavy, distracting ""ghost"" (""cross-talk"") images, which is irritating.

To top it off, the ""Behind the Scenes"" (50 min.) bonus videos _do not play_ on both the ""Galapagos"" and ""Kingdom of Bugs"" discs.
Plus, the entire Disc 2 (""The Making of 'Kingdom of Plants' "") does not play at all.

This amazing video work has been crippled by bad menu programming, and bad disc encoding technique.
I hope a 3D set -- made with the same care as the video itself -- will be released soon.

First, let me say that it is Sir David Attenborough, so it is already a keeper.

I had purchased ""Kingdom of Plants 3D"" as a single (all region) and though the program disc played, the bonus disc did not.  When I received the collection set, again, the bonus disc would not play.  I also found that the program part of the other discs played, the bonus part would not.  I am disappointed in not seeing the bonus material, but can live with only the 3D program material.  BBC & Amazon should fix this and replace at no extra charge.  Region Free should refer to ALL MATERIAL on the discs.  This is the reason for four stars.

The programs themselves are FIVE STAR all the way.  The 3D has great life like depth and color.  It is truly like looking thru a window.  If you don't have a 3D HD TV and 5.1 surround sound system, you don't know what you're missing.  3D IS HERE TO STAY!

5979503,5,B00FEDUIAK,"Flawless, beautiful 3D. I'm a Professional Stereographer so I see plenty of product. This is worth the price if you enjoy nature. SkyTv deserves credit for producing this historical series. And don't forget the Trade Craft that went into this. It sets the technical bar. Your purchase is an edorsement of art and education. It's that good.",1421452800,2,339,4.964912280701754
5979504,5,B00FEDUIAK,"Stunning color, photography...this has to go on my list of top 3D movies, along with Avatar and Alice In Wonderland (Johnny Depp). If you have a good 3D TV, you will want this.  The ""Making of "" 3D-CD in my set does not work/play at all, but I would not watch this anyway...thought of returning to see if another set would work but the other 3 DVD's (the ones that count) work perfectly, so who cares?  Each of the 3 DVD's has several segments and last a really long time...this set is a bargain...David Attenborough was an amazing person...so sad he is no longer around.",1420588800,3,571,4.428571428571429
5979505,5,B00FEDUIAK,"This should be an easy review...wow, wow, wow and oh did I say WOW!  I really enjoy watching movies in 3D.  I also happen to love watching shows like Planet Earth.  So when I saw this I knew I was going to be impressed.  Impressed doesn't begin to describe my thoughts on this set.  This is the set that answers the ""why do you like 3D"" naysayers out there.  It's reference quality 3D and truly blew me away with how impressive the 3D was.  Some of the plants and insects looked like they extended out into my living room.  I know a lot of people say you should own Avatar and they are right.  That's a good 3D movie.  This is great 3D.",1419379200,13,636,4.097560975609756

8614768,4,B00FEDUIAK,One of the most fascinating 3-D experience ever! The contents of this offering are beyond words. I dropped one star only due to the fact that the non-3-D Extras will not play. Two of the discs [MICRO MONSTERS and GALAPAGOS] contain Extra non 3-D material on their discs but this material will not play. KINGDOM OF PLANTS is a two disc set with the 3-D program on one disc and the non 3-D material on a separate disc and it won't play either. I'm fascinated by how these programs were made and so look forward to seeing the Extras.,1524960000,,530,4.363636363636363

8614770,5,B00FEDUIAK,"Wonderful shows and very much of the same quality as the 'Planet Earth series but more in depth of the subject matter.  The Galapagos episodes are my favorite, and this series explained more to me about the Galapagos than any other show I've seen.  I understand now how and why the creatures there evolved separately and so quickly and sparked Darwin's famous writings. The 3D is great and adds to the enjoyment of the show without distracting from it.  Highly recommended for both its educational and entertainment value.",1521244800,,522,4.909090909090909
