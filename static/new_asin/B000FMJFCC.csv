8124721,4,B000FMJFCC,"Sober, slow, beautifully photographed study of a murder trial in 1930s
fascist Italy.

The accused is clearly guilty, but one judge, opposed to the death
penalty, is determined to understand the man and his motives rather
than join the rush to execute him and be done with it.

Some terrific, subtle acting. But the ideas get a bit clunky in the
last third - more didactic, less nuanced. And while I enjoyed and
admired the film, I wasn't really moved by it. That said, I will
certainly re-watch it at some point, and moments have really stuck with
me over time.",1284076800,,562,4.554455445544554
