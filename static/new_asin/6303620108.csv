7851211,4,6303620108,Watching this one can only guess it was slapped together rather quickly. Some footage can be found in Traces of Death and other well known shockumentaries BUT there was also a lot of footage i had never seen before and some rather good narative and backstories to most (rather than either made up naratives or slapstick humor taunts.) I was torn between 3 and 4 stars only due to quality but the unseen footage pushed the 4. The film was worth a watch.,1476748800,,452,4.457831325301205

7851214,5,6303620108,"There is lots of footage with good British narration.  It is not extremely bloody as many of the executions were chosen or viewed from a distance.  Certainly to be seen by all those who are FOR execution as to how inhumane we are to each other.  In the end, I think you will come to the same conclusion that ""an eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind.""  Forgiveness of sin is harder than dishing out the same, but it is what separates us from the animal world.",1327536000,,465,4.191011235955056
7851215,3,6303620108,"Having looked frequently for video footage of human tragedy and ""the stuff you can't see on TV,"" I came across this peculiar video.

Maybe I'm getting a little desensitized to the world of shockumentaries, but ""Executions"" leaves a lot to be desired. Hardly ""hardcore"" in any respect, it's more or less a mish-mash of very old footage from war-torn areas of the globe. That's not to say that the content isn't intriguing, it's just fairly tame. There's only so many times one can witness executions of criminals (both suspected and guilty) in the middle of dirty streets before it becomes uninteresting. ..and that's what this video has a lot of.

The classic series, ""Faces of Death,"" may have been chock-full of reenactments and bad acting, but the approach was well-done. The narrator spoke to you as if it were personal, giving the footage a more ""as a matter of fact"" feel to it. Treated as a documentary of death, it worked...and shocked many who stumbled upon it. ""Executions"" doesn't work the same way. There are various narratives describing what's happening in many of the clips, but unfortunately, it comes across as being more or less a stiff news report rather than someone attempting to speak to you on a personal level about the tragedy of violent death. Very cold and distant.

If you're merely a person with fleeting interest in controversial footage that the nightly news wouldn't let you see, give ""Executions"" a shot. If you're a gorehound or a hardcore reality freak looking for wanton violence, you may want to steer clear of this title. A nice addition to a collection of dark footage, but pretty much, nothing more.",1212969600,3,1639,4.8464285714285715
7851216,4,6303620108,"Man, only see this if you want to see REAL stuff.  Seems like all b roll newsfootage.  Really gory.  Production values a little bad but looks like they did what they can to clean it up.  Hardcore stuff, MUCH better that wimpy Faces of D.",1112486400,9,237,4.2
7851217,4,6303620108,"I got the DVD of this from the UK. I been interested in getting this film ever since i heard about it when I was in 4th grade. Like everyone else said, this film shows executions from around the world. Also shows Saddam Hussein's rampage as he gassed his own people, why wasn't this footage in Michael Moore's movie, Farenheit 9/11 ?

Think about that one.

Also, the footage in this film is extreme, although nothing to turn away from,it's not something to eat popcorn while watching.

If you want to see people die, get Traces of Death, if you want a historical lesson about executions, get this.",1090713600,5,598,4.518518518518518
7851218,4,6303620108,"whether you are for or against the death penalty you should give this video a chance, it just may change your mind! This isn't just a mindless ""faces of death"" video, it is a very well done documentary that covers almost all forms of execution and give you an estimate on how much time it takes someone to die using that certain form of execution. Basically throughout time the purpose of executions was to punish but then it became a mission to make executions ""humane"" and ironicaly enough the last execution the video shows seems to be the most inhumane way to die but took the least amount of time to kill the accused! You have to see this video to believe it, it was vey well done and you just might learn a few things.",1074384000,3,724,4.330882352941177
7851219,3,6303620108,"Watching ""Executions,"" one quickly gets the point of this video: Little editing, no effects, and plenty of barbarism. This video shows executions from around the world. None are pretty nor quick.
This video  is made for those who want to understand how justice is execised around the  world. They will quickly be shocked as to the speed and brutality of some  styles. Brace yourself, this video is not for the faint hearted.",943574400,15,424,4.861111111111111
