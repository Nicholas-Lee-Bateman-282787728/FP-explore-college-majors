5683229,1,B00BZW5WLE,"The fact that they spelled her last name wrong on the top of the DVD (zoom in and see for yourself) and the fact that it says ""Unauthorized"" on the bottom says it all. If they can't even spell her name correctly on the cover before they produce the thing, why should we trust anything else on the DVD itself? I wasn't dumb enough to buy it and hopefully no one else will be either.",1373846400,14,381,4.093333333333334
5683230,1,B00BZW5WLE,"I agree with all the previous, negative reviews; they sum things up big time. This DVD is mostly a bunch of boring interviews (including Ryan Seacrest, an airhead I hate with a passion). I was expecting at least a few performances. I almost sent the thing back, and I wish I would've. Don't get this DVD, just don't. Never have I been so disappointed with a Demi product. I guess it's not for anything why this thing is so darn cheap.

Smr, this DVD does blow. Some of the interviews (including that of Ryan Seacrest) were so awful to the point words can't even describe.",1373673600,7,571,4.438095238095238
5683231,1,B00BZW5WLE,the entire thing was 3 interviews that you can see on YouTube and gave wrong information about demi.....don't waste your money,1373673600,11,126,5.0476190476190474
5683232,5,B00BZW5WLE,This is so amazing. Is the life and biography of one of the best amazing artists in the world. She inspires so many people and is amazing role model. She sold millions of records. She is talented and she changed my world,1372809600,2,220,4.261904761904762
5683233,1,B00BZW5WLE,"demi lovato is a talented singer and likeable actress and all this really is , is a few copyed off the tv interviews . true, I didn't watch the whole thing any parts where they showed her singing it was mute because they didn't have her permission . to make money off someone with as little effort as this is like leaching off someone elses fame . do her right and don't pay for this trash",1372723200,14,389,4.131578947368421

5683238,1,B00BZW5WLE,"I love Demi Lovato, but I wasn't crazy about this DVD. I was reading all the reviews and it was really helpful. Thank goodness I didn't buy this DVD because I really would have been disappointed. If your thinking about buying this Please read the reviews before buying. It will save you money. Plus Demi's last name was missed spelled on top of the DVD. It's LOVATO!!! Plus this DVD is unauthorized, which says a lot. LOVATICS BEWARE!!!",1393545600,,436,4.602564102564102

5683242,1,B00BZW5WLE,"Lovatics and other fans of Demi, don't waste your money buying this. I paid for it thinking it would have exclusive interviews as it claimed it does on the front or at least be of some interest. All this DVD has is 3 interviews which you can watch on youtube (with Ryan Seacrest etc.) and facts about Demi, half of which are WRONG. Do NOT bother purchasing this. In short, it's terrible.",1376956800,27,387,4.388888888888889
