8302011,5,B000WFVDOK,"Lance Burton has been a good friend for almost 40 years!  I have been fortunate to be able to turn to him for insight and advice as I have pursued my own career in magic.  Lance has always been knowledgeable and helpful, and I am a better magician because of the things I have learned from him.  This DVD gives you the opportunity to learn from a master as well!  Lance has tipped some great stuff here-- magic that is easy to do but that will have a powerful impact on your audience.  Even though I have been performing magic for almost 50 years, I learned a few things myself from this DVD!  The instructions Lance gives are clear and easy to follow.  Perhaps more important are the thoughts he shares about presentation.  The production matches the content.  You will enjoy watching Lance do these tricks.  Then you will enjoy learning them and performing them yourself!  Highly recommended!",1493683200,2,894,4.594936708860759
8302012,5,B000WFVDOK,"So you want to learn Magic, what better way to learn than have Master Magician Lance Burton teach you!! This is an excellent magic video and has some really good tricks on it to fool and amaze your friends and family with. Watch Lance perform the tricks first and then personally teach you step by step how to perform them yourself, all probably with things you have laying around your house. There's something for everyone on this Video. GREAT MAGIC EASY TO LEARN!!",1493251200,,466,4.626506024096385
8302013,5,B000WFVDOK,"Excellent Video. A great way to introduce someone to the art of magic! Well worth the $2 rental and much more! ! I highly recommend Lance Burton's ""Magic Made Easy""",1493164800,,164,4.5
8302014,5,B000WFVDOK,Lance Burton is a Master Magician and a master teacher too! What a great video to learn some tricks with playing cards and things you have around the house. Everything is well explained and demonstrated and easily performed with just a bit of practice. There's even a bigger illusion that you can do for a larger audience included which looks really fun. If you want to learn some good magic from a great magician I'd recommend this video and he even has more recommendations for more magic at the end so be sure watch it all the way thru.,1493164800,,539,4.454545454545454
8302015,5,B000WFVDOK,"As Lance states in his DVD, he began his interest in magic, as I did, years ago, having to learn magic from books.  Though books remain an excellent and reliable source of great magic effects and practices, today's technology allows beginning and practicing magicians the opportunity to learn magic by observing some of the best performers via the internet or other entertainment devices.  I believe any good magician will always seek to learn from others, as we all can benefit from individual talent strengths.  Lance Burton has established himself as a legendary performer, yet he remains humble in his character and ""down-to-earth"" in his explanations for beginning magicians and his audience.  I always admire any performer who tries, and is able, to appeal to people of all ages and abilities in positive ways by providing routines with dignity, poise, and respect to numerous audiences.  Lance is one such performer.  All of his performing that I have seen has been done in good taste, with class. The difficulty for any magician creating a DVD is to appeal to everyone.  Even if you are a practicing magician, watching Lance perform his more basic routines should prove to be a joy unto itself, as it was for me.  Lance certainly has made enough money performing over the years that he didn't have to produce this DVD, but I applaud him for taking the time to offer, as he reveals, a DVD that he wishes he had had when he was starting out in magic.  I am very pleased with this DVD and I believe others who enjoy watching quality magic will be, also.  Thank you, Lance, and thank you, Amazon vendors, who make such a purchase possible.",1371859200,3,1643,4.753521126760563
