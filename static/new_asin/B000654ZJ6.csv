The fact that they decided to talk over the top of otherwise perfectly good songs is a complete let down and absolutely horrible decision. Like the other reviewer, I can't put into words how disgusted I was with this disc after waiting for it for so long. Bad move guys. Please try to get it right next time, if there ever is one.",1101686400,3,490,4.061855670103093
2168444,5,B000654ZJ6,"Should this be the first  DVD of this band?  Hell no.  I can't believe that they haven't put out stuff from the glorious 70s.  This was a great tour.  When they were with Kiss, they ripped up the joint.  This video captures their fire and ability to put wanna be bands to shame.  This is real rock and roll (with a detour here and there Don't Want to Miss a Thing)

Next time, I would like the ability to track individual band members so that I can watch Joe's guitar playing or I have the choice to not switch camera angles every other second.  When I am at a concert I take in one thing at a time and then do a quick scan of what is around.

These videos are cheap to film, no reason that there can't be ten different angles to switch to.

If you like Aerosmith, this is a bargain.  DVD with bonus songs, a song you can mess with on the computer, and a live cd is thrown in so you can hear them live on the way to work.  Good deal.",1101600000,3,933,3.9251336898395723
2168445,4,B000654ZJ6,"What's great about Aerosmith is that they've been doing this for so long they have nothing to prove and may finally be at the stage where they can just let go and let it happen. The idea that comes forth the most in the interviews is that at this stage of the game, they're really all about finding that moment in each show when they lose themselves in the moment and enter ""The Zone,"" where time and space slip away and the feeling takes over.

When I think about all the home video releases I've purchased by Aerosmith I lose count of how many concerts feature ""Toys,"" ""Saddle"" or ""Walk This Way."" At the end of the day, I've heard these songs a million times and while it's still a pleasure to hear them done so well I'm probably more interested in the guys and the process they go through today. Like, it's amazing to me that they still need to rehearse-- if you've ever seen them live you know they make it look so easy. ""Honkin' on Bobo"" is such a down-and-dirty Aerosmith rock album it's somehow surprising to see them work out a riff in the studio. It just sounds like it all flows naturally, like at this point they just pick up their instruments and it happens in the first take.

That said, I'm going to say that I enjoyed the glimses of the boys working in the Bone Yard more than the actual concert footage. They seem to have a great time in the studio today, and how cool that they worked with longtime producer Jack Douglas on this album.

If you're a longtime Aerosmith fan (30 years and counting!) you'll probably be as amazed as I am that these guys seem to be at the top of their game, and you'll enjoy the honest look at their behind-the-scenes as much as I did. If you're hoping for Alicia Silverstone and all the Top-10 hits, you're shopping for ""Big Ones You Can Look At.""",1101427200,12,1795,4.304733727810651
2168446,5,B000654ZJ6,"You Gotta Move is a documentary featuring live concert footage from America's Greatest Rock-n- Roll Band, Aerosmith.  While the performance is not as good as the show in Charlotte, NC back in April of '86 , it still kicks a ton of ass.  The documentary parts get old after a few viewings, but you can avoid that by going to the song index and clicking on 'Play Songs' and it will just play  all the song tracks and skip the documentary tracks. Yes the ""Oh it's so fun being a Rock Star"" voice overs on some of the songs are a bit annoying primarily because if you have it cranked up, the voice overs are way too loud, but it ain't nothin' worth blowing a gasket over!... I think some people need to lay off of the caffeine.

By the way, any hardcore fan would have gotten an email from the boys earlier this year informing them that ""You Gotta Move"" was going to air on the A & E Network and any hardcore fan could have seen for themselves that this was a documentary with annoying voice overs and all.  But, I digress...

If I wanted to have the experience of ""being there"", I would have shelled out  $75 for a ticket when the boys came through Charlotte.  However, since I'm too cheap to do that, this DVD is the next best thing.  The songs span Aerosmith's 30 year (Boy, do I feel old) career. In my not so humble opinion, the show stoppers are the 'Bobo' songs ""Baby Please Don't Go"" and a smokin' version of ""Stop Messin' Around"" sung by the original American Bad Ass, Papa Joe Perry. DIABETICS BE WARNED: the syrupy sweet Diane Warren penned ballad ""I Don't Want To Miss A Thing"" is included. However, Steven Tyler's performance of the song is top notch, so just take an extra hit of insulin and enjoy.  The DVD also includes 5 bonus songs that weren't featured in the documentary.  The pick of the litter is "" Rats In The Cellar"".  The sound and video on this DVD are both excellent.  If this DVD were a straight up concert  I would give it 10 stars out of a possible 5, but since it ain't, I'll only give it 5 stars!",1101340800,13,2024,4.250652741514361

myself this is the one we have all been waiting for...

Great rock & blues music. This is the way I remember

the show's from the 70's....strong & powerful. The band

and fans move as one while the music is playing. There's

alot ( more then any other rock DVD )of good video shots of ""girls-girls-girls"" throughout this DVD. There's nothing

like the guys partying and watching all the women dancing

around during the whole show. ha! ha! Are you still reading

Negatively. This is NOT a non-stop concert. we see footage of the band speaking between songs and even sometimes when the song is already started(easily 30 seconds into the song sometimes). We see an awful lot a silicone babes and stripper looking girls...really I never saw a DVD concert with That much shots of the public.

A re-vamped version of their 70's style music. The album rocked and the tour was one of the greatest I have seen Aerosmith on. After seeing You Gotta Move on TV, it rocked. Defiantly one of the best Music DVD's I have seen in a long time. This is their first ""live"" Dvd since the 70's and they didn't miss a beat. They obviously play their old songs like it is the last time they are ever going to play them. Plus Aerosmith gets better each and every tour.

From their rock favorites to some Blues tossed in for good measure, I doubt you will hear Aerosmith or Steven Tyler at this level ever again. I just saw him perform the now infamous rendition of the National Anthem prior to one of the NFL Football playoff games. He sounded a little rough around the edges now, voice wise...but gave what I expected of an old rockers version, so to me, it was not a bad rendition at all. For the price of this concert DVD, the extra CD included, some damn good songs with excellent sound quality to watch.

2168494,5,B000654ZJ6,"Last night, I watched the WHO at a recent BBC session at the roundhouse in London ... once a brilliant group, here were Roger ( who looked like a botoxed waxwork ) and Pete ( greying and lethargic ) looking and sounding HORRIBLE. Daltrey could not hit a note, his timing was rubbish and they killed what were once fantastic songs. On top of that the ""energy"" of the band was about the same as that produced my hamster running around his exercise wheel.

My point? Here are Aerosmith 30 years on rocking as hard as ever, and Steve Tyler producing a vocal performance which was simply breathtaking. Throughout the entire concert he does not miss a note, and I am in AWE of his vocal ability after a lifetime of ..well, everything he has lived through !

OK, we can all criticise this DVD ""packaging"" for all the stated reasons, but lets remember that there are precious few reviewers here who criticise the music, energy, and brilliance of Aerosmith the group. You should be proud of these guys because they are everything that a rock group should be, and the fact that they are as good now as they were when I first saw them 20 odd years ago, and are still able to put 100% into their performances, is almost unique.

I wish I could say the same for some British groups that attempt to maintain rock credibility, but are now frankly, embarrassing. That is NOT something you could EVER level at Aerosmith.

1. Good music, performances, and sound quality but so irritating how interviews intrude on the performances.

2. Headache inducing rapid fire edits that rival the movie Catwoman, band members somehow change guitars in the middle of songs, visuals don't match what's heard, producers show no affinity for the music.

3. Too many shots of the crowd, many of which seem to be planted strippers, etc.

The people that made this show just should have let Aerosmith and the music do the talking. This hard-sell editing seems more suited for an up and coming boy-band or somebody else that is trying to establish itself and create hype.

About  all the audience shots, what do you think the band wants to see, a documentary of nothing but shots of themselves, they want to see there fans reacting to there music. Its not only a film for their fans, but a film for band  to enjoy as well.",1136073600,6,379,4.208333333333333

2168499,5,B000654ZJ6,"This a superbly well done live album. The only problem with showing the crowd is that the shots of the chicks were too short!! Aerosmith hard rock is about sex and drugs (in the old days) and rock and roll, and this DVD delivers. Joe Perry plays with a frenzy.

2168500,5,B000654ZJ6,"Aerosmith has done it again. For anyone who has had second thoughts about attending an Aerosmith concert, this amazing DVD puts those doubts to bed. Album after album, Aerosmith has lived up to their own and the fans' expectations, and now to add to the momentum, they give us ""You Gotta Move"". This DVD chronicles the backstage experiences first hand, a history/summary of the bands' past, and also shows that America's greatest rock band hasn't lost their edge. Aerosmith is the best ""classic rock"" band of its time as far as retaining fans who became attatched to their music in the early 70's, and still to this day attracting a whole new generation of fans. Having attended an Aerosmith concert in 2004, I can honestly say without a doubt it's an experience that will put you on a high for a long time afterwards. This is true for ""You Gotta Move"" as well. Their sound is unmatched, the music unforgettable and legendary. As far as the voice-over aspect of the DVD, how can you possibly refer to yourself as a fan unless you know the history of the music you are listening to? Sure the main attraction is the music itself, but listening to the bands' personal thoughts about their music and how they made it this far helps everyone better understand and respect the music. I highly recommend ""You Gotta Move"" to everyone.",1130284800,2,1326,4.670940170940171

At least you get to hear the full songs except the start of sweet emotion which is drowned out by interviews. The performance is great Steve Tyler is a great frontman and the band are great muscians. Compare this with the dismal Black Sabbath (Last Supper dvd)were every song except for five are cut to pieces by interviews. But next time Aerosmith could we have a full concert as your fans know how good you guys are live. Ps at least they don't waffle on about their drug problems like they use to in every interview.",1126483200,,1055,4.176470588235294

2168503,4,B000654ZJ6,"So here we have at last a live dvd perfomance of Aerosmith. Don't be tricked fellows. When i bought this dvd,i had that bad feeling of it and that was because these people are getting realy old. I can't say the concert sucks,but it lacks the energy Aero-guys used to have and this is of course because of their age(Somehow J.Perry reminded me on stage of Keith Richards!:).Anyway,i've read all of the reviews here and watched this dvd several times,so here are the things i've mentioned:

1. An average live perfomance,not acousticaly,but visualy. As i said,these guys are not teens anymore. Steven continue to save the  visual image of the band.

2. Paid models dancing and kissing?!!!Come on ppl,i've saw gals kissing even at Scorpions concert! I'm pretty sure that if you watch the entire thing,you'll soon notice that the main purpose of this release is to catch and show a point of energy and entertainment. Pointing the gals and happy crowd and not the band,shows that the band isn't as energetic as they used to be,thats why all the cameras were looking for cheering people,to fullfill that gap. Some people liked this,some didn't and some even said it was a whole fake thing. In my opinion it was 100% true. Bands like Aerosmith don't need to pay girls to sing their songs or dance in their concerts.

3. The thousands of cuts included may get you tired a bit,but it's a matter of taste as well.

4. The interviews covering the intros of most of the songs,realy suck. This is not a spoiler though,but it gets realy annoying.

I think most of the fans will enjoy this release. It could be pretty better,but it is a way better than i personaly expected.",1123545600,2,1659,4.645051194539249
2168504,5,B000654ZJ6,"We wanted Aerosmith and we got Aerosmith.  They're out there on stage, they're rocking, they sound great.  For those who have a problem with a few models, might I remind you that we are, once again, talking about Aerosmith.  Steven Tyler was having fun playing up to the pretty things in the front row, just watch him.  He was into it.  The menu graphics are dominated by naked women.  Those women in the crowd ain't nothing but a bit of decoration themselves, albeit with more clothing on (for the most part).  Aerosmith have quit the drugs, please leave them the sex and rock 'n roll.  It's all good fun, right?  This snake is gonna rattle...  Right?  Eh..?  Anyway, the section on the making of Honkin' on Bobo was fantastic and worth the cost of the DVD just by itself.  It was great to watch them performing live in the studio at such length.",1122854400,7,847,4.457516339869281
2168505,3,B000654ZJ6,"The concert footage was excellent, but I did not like the documentary segments between the the concert footage.

2168506,1,B000654ZJ6,"this once great rock band's first ever official DVD release is not what it should be. Before you buy, consider this - it's NOT a proper concert. It's a selection of songs chosen from one of their gigs, put together but hidiously edited with pointless interviews and behind-the-scene footage in between the songs that are so annoying they even run over the concert footage. In other words, during the cool intro to ""Sweet Emotion"" you don't actually hear it coz an interview is still going on!! so if you're expecting a full concert start to finish - avoid this DVD now.

Aerosmith better bounce back with a major comeback soon before their fans get bored - their ""Honkin' On Bobo"" album was dreadful and this poor excuse for a DVD is not much better.",1120694400,3,750,4.597014925373134
2168507,1,B000654ZJ6,"To summarize:

(1) Horrible editing. Six cuts per second made me disoriented and angry.  Please, Mr. Director and Mr. Film Editor, just point the camera at Steven Tyler and give us the film of him doing his thing.

(2) Voices talking over the music.  Hey, guess what Mr. Film Editor - I bought this DVD thinking I'd see and hear a concert, not somebody's irrelevant comments over the music.

(3) Shots of the audience instead of the band.  Obvious plants of paid models in the ""audience"" (although they coulda been filmed separately in a studio, for all I know), acting as if they are jamming to the music.  I gagged.

I hope someone (Aerosmith, maybe?) will take the raw camera footage from this concert, and re-cut it into something coherent.  THAT would be the DVD to buy.",1120262400,19,775,4.598540145985401
2168508,5,B000654ZJ6,"I finaly got it! I have been wnting this for so long and I finaly found it in the store! Got home watched it and as I expected it was absolutly amazing. Well thats what you get from the worlds greatest rock and roll band. This is easily one of the best purcheses I have ever made. You get a DVD and a cd of Aerosmith all in one, what could be better? Nothing right? Right! I have been a fan of Aerosmith my whole life, Concedering Im only 16 thats not that long compared to some of you old time die-hard Aerosmith fans! I know someone out there reading this is going ""well so I have been listeneing to Aerosmith since I first saw them in 1972!"" which is so cool that the band has been around that long.

The DVD gives you the A&E special they made about Aerosmith which shows the band talking about how good it is to be sober and play live and show some of the recording of Honkin' On Bobo. Or you can just watch the live concert with out the commentary. And they also give you five extra songs that were not on the A&E special. The concert shows the band on a really really really good night. I have seen Aerosmith 5 times and each time they were amazing and on this time on the DVD they sure don't disapoint. Joey Kramers drumming as usualy keeps the whole band together. Tom Hamilton's bass playing is amazing as always as he is one of the better bass players ever. Brad Whitfords shows off some impressive guitar playing here and shows what an underrated guitar player he really is. Steven Tylers vocals are just simpley perfect as always and he puts on the best show you'll ever see, the truley is the worlds greatest front man. Then there is the one and only Joe Perry, my hero, my idol, the reason I love and listen to rock and roll and the whole reason for me ever picking up a guitar! He goes off on some of the craziest guitar solos ever in this DVD and proves once and for all that he is the worlds greatest guitar player! All the songs are performed well and sound just like the records.

Also on the DVD is a section where the band shows you the entire making of the album Honkin' On Bobo. Which is cool cause you get to see the band play record and here them talk about why they even started playing music in the first place. Also there is a section that shows you Aerosmith's entire discovery from their first album, Aerosmith all the way up to their latest album, Honkin' on Bobo. A really cool feature.

Lastley the DVD comes with a live Cd featuring five of the songs from the DVD. 'Toys In The Attic' 'Rats In The Celler' 'Back In The Saddle' 'Love In An Elevator' and 'Road Runner' and also if you put the disk in your computer you can remix the song 'You Gotta Move' which is realy cool.

So all in all this is a really good buy and one of the better things Aerosmith has realesed in recent years past. Do yourself a favor and keep on rockin' oh and do yourself another favor and pick up Joe Perrys new solo album it's amazing!",1119744000,2,2948,4.166666666666667

2168510,1,B000654ZJ6,"Good set list, and Aerosmith really rocks out to their good songs.  I particularly liked the Fleetwood Mac cover.  So why did someone feel it necessary to make a dvd that is just unwatchable?  6 camera cuts per second, with hired models dancing around in the audience?  Why?  I could not imagine a worse concert dvd being made.  Worse yet, when I try to forward to songs just to listen (with the video off), I can't do that because I have to try to sift through several minutes of talking!  And believe it or not, they actually put interviews over the songs!  The beginning of Sweet Emotion is drowned out by a band interview. The accompanying audio cd, with just 6 songs, is much more pleasurable to listen to.

In summary, it's a shame that there is not an audio cd version of this show, because the dvd is just unwatchable, and it's too much trouble to find the actual songs.  I would not recommend this at all.  It's a shame that Aerosmith allowed this to be released, because their playing is actually pretty good on it.

If you want a good concert dvd to check out, I'd suggest U2's ""Go Home: Live from Slane Castle Ireland"", from their 2001 tour.  It really rocks, and the video prodction is actually competent!",1113955200,5,1218,4.457013574660634

If you like Aerosmith for their music and energy, just listen to ""Nine lives"" ""Rocks"" or ""Toys in the attic"" . Or better yet, go to the show !

The making of ""Honkin' on Bobo"" is very good though, but makes the main concert even more frustrating to watch, because you realize that the real great live performance is happening INSIDE the recording studio !!!

BUT WHEN I FINALLY GOT AROUND TO WATCHING IT, I WAS ONE DISSAPOINTED AEROSMITH FAN. I'M SURE GLAD I DIDN'T SPEND MY MONEY ON THIS DVD! PERFORMANCES ARE MOSTLY BAD OR BORING, THE BAND FAILS TO PERFORM SOME OF THEIR BEST MATERIAL, AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, IT'S JUST REALLY TIME FOR THESE GUYS TO RETIRE NOW. THIS DVD SERVED BASICALLY AS A WAY TO HELP PROMOTE THEIR NEWEST CD, ''HONKIN ON BOBO''. WHILE THIS COULD'VE BEEN A PRETTY GOOD SHOW, A LOT OF MY FAVORITE AEROSMITH SONGS FAILED TO GET PERFORMED. BUT DESPITE THE MANY HALF-HEARTED PERFORMANCES ON THIS DVD, THERE ARE A FEW MOMENTS OF FUN ON HERE. THE SONGS THAT WERE PERFORMED THE BEST ON THIS SHOW WAS ''TOYS IN THE ATTIC'', ''RATS IN THE CELLAR'', ''LOVE IN AN ELEVATOR'', AND ''DRAW THE LINE''. OTHER THAN THAT, THIS IS PRETTY MUCH A PAIN TO WATCH. THESE SONGS DEFINITELY DESERVED TO BE ON THIS DVD: ''NO SURPRIZE'', ''COME TOGETHER'', ''EAT THE RICH'', ''SEASONS OF WITHER'', ''RAG DOLL'', ''SHUT UP AND DANCE'', ''MAMA KIN'', ''CHIP AWAY THE STONE'', AND ''ADAM'S APPLE''. AS FAR AS THIS BEING THEIR FIRST-EVER LIVE CONCERT DVD, IT WAS A MISTAKE TO RELEASE THIS DVD. BUT OF COURSE, REGARDLESS OF MY OPINIONS, THE AUDIENCE ON THIS DVD SEEM TO BE HAVING A GOOD TIME ALL THROUGHOUT THE SHOW. AND THERE'S A 6 SONG CD THAT COMES WITH IT [WHICH IS REALLY NEEDLESS, BEING THAT THE CD SUCKS ANYWAY]. IF YOU WANNA HEAR AEROSMITH IN CONCERT, STICK WITH THE ''A LITTLE SOUTH OF SANITY'' CD INSTEAD.

I saw Aerosmith in 76'and 93',and they were a hell of a lot better in 93'.The sound on this is very good ,possibly the best I have heard on DVD.The 5 bonus songs save the whole thing and I love Brad Whitford on lead guitar. The whole band is in great form and this is worth the $15.00. It could have been 5 stars except for the above criticisms.",1107993600,,522,4.178217821782178

Steven Tylers interviews are spoken in his own language I guess. I had no idea what he was babbling about. And really didn't care.

As a guitar player, I picked up on the overdubbing. I wonder what the editors are looking at?

There was a segment involving an ill child, they spent 3 minutes on it tops. If they spent more time on that, and less on Tylers incomprehensible interviews, I may have like this better.

Sound is fairly good, though I don't have any HIFI equip.",1107993600,,557,4.378640776699029
2168517,2,B000654ZJ6,"Why why why why why do the clowns who edit these ""live"" concert dvd's continually insist on ruining the music by overlapping interviews and other bull sessions into the songs themselves? Didn't Sony learn their lesson after Black Sabbath's ""Last Supper"" editing disaster? Am I wrong to think that the job of a concert video should be to give the illusion of actually being at the event? What fan in actual attendance would sit still if during every song lead in, Steve Tyler turned down the volume and talked about his life experiences? I don't know about you, but it would annoy the hell out of me! It's a shame because You Gotta Move could have been a great dvd. The sound quality of the music is excellent! And I was very impressed with the track selection. Sure one could argue that there are several key Aerosmith tunes missing from the set list. But to play every hit from Aerosmth's huge library, the dvd would have to be 12 hours in length. What makes this dvd fall flat on its face though is the totally inexcusable editing job. There's hardly a track on the entire dvd that isn't partly interrupted by the band members chatting about things we already knew and that could have easily been added in the bonus section. If that's not annoying enough, the camera angles change each and every second or two throughout the show. It's kinda like watching while riding a spinning merry-go-round? You never really see anything but a blur as it passes by. As for all the fan shots (almost half the dvd), I have to wonder if there were any plain looking/non model types/small chested people in the crowd at all? You wouldn't know it by where the camera men had their cameras pointed all night? lol Anyway, being a die hard Aerosmith fan aside, i'm very disappointed that they dropped the ball with their first official live dvd. It would have been so cool to sit back and enjoy an awesome show without feeling the need to throw a hammer at the tv. 2 stars for the good music that WASN'T interrupted with gab and for the bonus audio cd that's music, music, and nothing but the music!

I was hoping that after the first or second song the constant scene changes would settle down, but I was wrong....I was terribly wrong. My eyes couldn't focus fast enough to lock in on any one band member or people in the audience, for that matter (oh and by the way, the audience made up about 40% of the video).

  It's really a shame, the audio was great even in the PCM stereo mode.

These new generation producers and editors have to get back on track and slow the roller coaster down a bit.

2168519,5,B000654ZJ6,"Cream, The Rolling Stones, The Doors, U2, all these legendary bands eventually came to the blues (and three of the four I just mentioned aren't even from the U.S.), so it so no surprise that Aerosmith, probably the best hard rock band to pepper their sound and spirit with that of the classic bluesmen since Led Zeppelin, decided to release an album paying homage to the music from their southern roots, the music that eventually gave birth to rock n' roll. ""Honkin' On Bobo"" was a stunning album, one of the best 2004 produced, it was a ripping collage of the Aerosmith sonic assault with the flavors of legends like Willie Dixon and even Aretha Franklin. ""You Gotta Move"" is a documentary exploring the tour for the album and the origins of this most stellar production. It is a fun film to watch for various reasons, not least that this is a band that proves that age doesn't tarnish the thrill and sexual fervor of the best rock music. We get interviews with Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, Brad Whitford, Joey Kramer and Tom Hamilton where they discuss touring, writing music and all the wild things that happen during a tour. The performances are incendiary, especially a roaring ""Baby Please Don't Go"" where Perry unleashes classic blues rock ferocity. ""Never Loved A Girl"" is a stellar performance with Tyler evoking Aretha ""The Queen Of Soul"" Franklin and does her justice with a cover that is romantic, dangerous and totally classic. A lot of classic numbers like the immortal ""Dream On"" and the wickedly raunchy ""Love In An Elevator"" make an appearance as well. There are also some fascinating moments like a man proposing to his girlfriend backstage in front of the band or a boy dying of cancer meeting the group with his mother tearfully explaining how ""I Don't Wanna Miss A Thing"" gave him courage in dire moments. The Making Of special is a detailed look at the roots of ""Honkin' On Bobo,"" we get some priceless footage of the band recording and preparing, digging into the music of their land and bringing it to life for a modern audience but never losing the essence of the original pieces. Having been raised in a Southern Baptist home, the blues are very close to my heart and Aerosmith has done the genre complete justice. ""You Gotta Move"" is a fun and exciting DVD chronicling the band's most recent tour and the making of what has to be one of their best albums ever.",1104883200,2,2383,4.649289099526066
2168520,5,B000654ZJ6,"I stumbled on this about a month ago and knew this would be a great Christmas gift for my fiance. We saw this tour roll through town this summer and enjoyed the show.  This band has been around for over 30 years so you would think having that many songs to play live would create a mixed playlist but these guys have learned to play what the fans want to hear.  Look at the songs on this: Toys in the Attic, Love in an Elevator, Road Runner, Baby Please Don't Go Cryin', The Other Side, Back in the Saddle, Draw the Line, Dream On, Stop Messin' Around, Jaded, I Don't Want to Miss a Thing, Sweet Emotion, Never Loved a Girl, Walk This Way, Train Kept a Rollin', not to mention the bonus tracks of Fever, Rats in the Cellar, Livin' on the Edge, Last child, Same Old Song and Dance that eliminate all the needless shots of the audience.  A great audio mix and fantastic camera angles bring back the memory of the Honkin' on Bobo summer tour.  My only complaint is that the intros of the songs suffer from the interviews from the band members speaking until the verse starts.  Small complaint.  This also comes with a Six-song CD: Toys in the Attic, Love in an Elevator, Rats in the Cellar, Road Runner, The Other Side, Back in the Saddle as another bonus.  All for under $20 bucks.  Stop wasting time and run out and get this, you will groove from the opening riff of Toys in the Attic until the closing credits of Train Kept a Rollin'.  I never saw this on A & E so this was a true surprise and treasure for me.",1104796800,,1510,4.215277777777778
2168521,4,B000654ZJ6,"My opinion as a 1970s-era Aerosmith fan is that this is a great sounding disc that every fan will probably get some enjoyment from. However, I agree with other reviewers that it does have some significant weaknesses.

WEAKNESSES:

1. The interview footage sometimes overlaps the concert performances. (But as someone else pointed out, the Song Selection menu allows you to choose ""play all songs,"" which makes it skip the DVD chapters containing only interview material. However, the interview footage still overlaps some of the songs.)

2. The DVD contains zillions of one-second-or-shorter edits. I don't usually object to quick edits, but this is extreme. It made the DVD a lot less enjoyable.

3. The DVD contains about four times more audience shots than any other concert video I own (and I own about 30).

4. Many of the women in the audience shots dance suspiciously like strippers. (There's even a shot of two women kissing!) Even if they are legitimate fans (doubtful), the band can certainly stand on its own merit -- it doesn't need a hundred and one bimbos!

5. The discography only lists albums released by Columbia. (How shameless on the part of Columbia!)

STRENGTHS:

1. Superb performance by the band.

2. Great sound.

3. Interesting interview and behind-the-scenes footage.

4. A lengthy bonus featurette of the band making their latest blues CD, Honkin' On Bobo (worth the price of the DVD alone).

5. The extras include footage of about six or seven additional songs, this time not edited by someone with Attention Deficit Disorder and an audience fixation. Includes ""Rats in the Cellar,"" ""Last Child"" and ""Same Old Song and Dance"" (also worth the price of the DVD alone).

6. Included concert CD is very good.

CONCLUSION:

If you're a fan, you'll probably want to have this. I just wish the editors would have ""LET THE MUSIC DO THE TALKING"" a little more.",1104537600,,1879,4.901898734177215
2168522,2,B000654ZJ6,"I have been waiting for a good Aerosmith concert dvd forever. I had ""Live at Texxas Jam '78"" and ""Video Scrapbook"" on VHS. They are ok But they were not an entire concert. Good music but not the real deal.

  I knew before hand this was a documentary show from A&E but assummed that the DVD would have the option to see the concert in its entirety. Wrong. It is filled with voice overs and cuts to interviews and making of segments. thats all well and good but offer another version of just the concert. They included unedited versions of 5 other songs from the concert but only as a bonus feature. Is it too hard to edit these back in to the rest of the concert. This could have been the Ultimate Concert DVD with little effort. This seems Thrown together in a hurry to get it out on the shelfs.

  Another thing I would love to have seen is a CD version of the entire thing to take with me in the car. Why waste time with a little teaser disc of just a few songs? It would be better then that over produced piece of trash that was ""A Little South of Sanity"". If you can find it get the bootlegged ""Back in the Saddle"" from there Monsters of Rock concert. Even ""Live Bootleg"", though it does have a edited performance of ""Mother Popcon"". I have a bootleg of the Paul's Mall concert with the entire performance. and it is great. I wish I didn't need to resort to bootlegs to get these great Aerosmith concerts. All those concerts are far better than what we have been given until now. A release of this performance on CD would definetly be the best to date though. And a release of the ""unplugged"" concert from MTV would be just awesome. But I digress.

  Further more when you look at the Discography, Sony decided not to include the geffen albums. They are the best selling of all there albums. So much for being accurrate. I don't know if Geffen said no or Sony just didn't want to give there competitors any free advertising but its just a shame. This is an insult and a joke to Aerosmith's credit. The greatest Rock & Roll band America has ever produced deserves better than this.",1104451200,4,2085,4.298469387755102
2168523,5,B000654ZJ6,"Aerosmith waited to put this dvd out until the ""honkin on bobo"" cd. I want to explain as a life long aerosmith fan why i think there was so much chit chat in between songs. They wanted to explain the PROCESS of making honkin on bobo, they wanted to give their fans who they are devoted to dearly a inside look on their ""back to their roots"" project. Alot of people in these reviews especially one by somebody named christopher claims that no girl u nder 25 knows all the lyrics to aerosmith songs and hes wrong because Im 24 and i know every lyric to every aerosmith song. If you want to know why aerosmith has came through everything from publisized drug abuse, some managers that were just trying to back stab them and use them, 2 of its original band members leaving the band, and then returning in the 80s, and the ability to get clean and rebuild their outstanding carrer then you need to see this dvd. The dedication that These guys not only have to their fans but each other is something that is never seen in bands. The reason why aerosmith has stood the test of time and will continue to rock and roll for years is because along with being band mates, these guys are brothers by choice. Any TRUE aerosmith fan knows what im talking about and LOVE THIS LONG OVERDUE DVD.",1103932800,2,1278,4.351464435146443
2168524,5,B000654ZJ6,"This music DVD has the best picture quality I have encountered on a concert DVD.  Many of the preceding reviewers are correct that there is too much talk at the beginning of the songs.  The interruption of the lead in to to ""Sweet Emotion"" was particularly annoying.

The 5.1 mix is very tight, and one of the best 5.1 mixes I have come across.  The music is very clear.  There is a selection of songs in the bonus material that is pure concert footage without the voice overs and cut scenes of the crowd.  It was very enjoyable.

If the DVD had an alternate track with the voice overs and snippets on it, and a primary track with just music this disc would be perfect.  As it is, I have enjoyed repeated viewing/listening of it and highly recommend it.",1102550400,4,753,4.366906474820144
2168525,4,B000654ZJ6,"Having directed and produced the concert film for A&E (Live Concert) and then seeing it turn up as a DVD is a very enlightening development. I really enjoyed working with this band in the hopes of creating a concert film that captured the raw energy and musicianship that demonstrates the concrete credibilty this band has maintained over the years. My objective was to make the viewer feel as though they were being showered from the sweat off of the face of the five hardest working rock and roll performers in show business. Hey guys, thanks for the thanks as well as the experience. Perhaps we will meet again someday! I can't wait....",1102464000,4,639,4.714285714285714
2168526,3,B000654ZJ6,"Yeah, talking over a song does suck but the thing that really turns a 5 star performance into a 3 star video is that constant cutting from the stage to the fans back and forth.  Maybe the band thinks its a tribute to the fans to put some of them on their DVD.  More likely is that video directors and editors cut to fans having a good time in order to remind dvd viewers that you too are ""partying with the band.""  I believe I can safely say that fans don't buy DVDs to look at fans.  We want to see the freaking band!",1102464000,4,518,3.951923076923077
2168527,3,B000654ZJ6,"If you're looking for a live concert, this isn't it. The live cuts are terrific. The dialog leading into each cut is interesting, once or twice. The problem is that you have to listen to the dialog each and every time, which gets tiring in a hurry.
Summary. Good material, but the format is very disappointing.",1102204800,3,310,4.553571428571429
2168528,3,B000654ZJ6,"Plenty of people have talked about the annoying voice-overs, so I'll pass on that part.

This is a good performance, but a tacky editing job.  A&E were stuck in the past when they edited this performance, loading it up with hired models pretending to be girls in the crowd.  Find me a woman under 25 who knows 70s Aerosmith lyrics, and I'll buy you this DVD.  There are also plenty of ""glory shots"" of band members where it's clear they are not playing the parts you are hearing.  I find that unacceptable because it just doesn't add anything - I already know they are cool, I don't have to be convinced.

What saves the whole thing in the end is five performances included as extras which must have been edited by someone else.  These are clean shots of the songs with no extra frills, and they are simply amazing.

Guitar fans: Joe Perry busts out a double neck black Gretch for Living On The Edge that probably resulted in a call from his buddy Jimmy Page looking for a Christmas present.  Amazing tone!",1101945600,33,1006,4.453551912568306
2168529,5,B000654ZJ6,"Though I'm not a hard core Aerosmith fan, I do love their music being a musician myself. I was blown away with this DVD. If your thinking about buying it, your money will be well spent. Just do it !!!!",1101945600,,201,4.05
2168530,1,B000654ZJ6,This could have been a great DVD. As mentioned in earlier reviews the voice over introductions during the songs make this DVD a garbage can special. Why would anyone want to hear the same comments over and over while trying to listen to music. In the words of the late Frank Zappa just shut up and play your guitar.,1101859200,5,315,4.3559322033898304

8038691,5,B000654ZJ6,"Tremendous DVD from Aerosmith at the top of their game. They are Producers of the effort, which documents an Orlando FL Honking on Bobo tour concert and combines band commentary on Bobo's recording and their general outlook. The DVD is a total blast- it's been replayed five times in a row since arrival. Highly worthwhile, especially for viewers who want to get to know these guys who have contributed so much great music for so long. Bobo was recorded without tracks, BTW, so no production tricks or FM market  concerns interfere with their excellence blasting through.

  We've all been too critical  before- that explains any negative Amazon reviews. Occasional split screen works fine on this DVD. Promise: Blast it and see if it isn't all I say and more. Trust the band- they really shine on this. Plus a live CD! What a deal.",1467763200,,832,4.75
