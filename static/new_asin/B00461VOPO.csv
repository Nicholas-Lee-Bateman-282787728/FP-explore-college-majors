4263898,5,B00461VOPO,"This video is outstanding, educational, and eye-opening!!!  Every believer in the Lord Jesus Christ needs to view this video, especially those who are or have been followers or been under the teaching of David Barton.  If  you have a pastor who has shown Mr. Barton's videos in your church, please make sure he views this video.  He owes it to his congregation as a shepherd of the flock to get all the facts and, if he still disagrees with Mr. Pinto in this video, to research it out himself before he dismisses Mr. Pinto's documented claims.  As a former follower of Mr. Barton, until I conducted my own research several years ago, this video was very encouraging and enlightening.  I learned a lot more about the truth of our founding fathers and their backgrounds that cemented my beliefs that this country was not founded as a Christian nation.  Be a discerning Christian!!!  Remember, this earth is not our home.  Our hope is not in a nation but in a person -- Jesus Christ!!!",1288915200,14,982,4.630057803468208
4263899,5,B00461VOPO,"As a Bible-believing Christian, I know that we are to search hard for the truth and follow it wherever it leads, rather than basing our opinions on the prevailing traditions of men.  I have a master's degree in political science and took several graduate courses on the political philosophy of America's founding.  As a result, my own studies largely match those of Chris Pinto and this film.  Sadly, there are those out there who make a living promoting the myth of ""America's Christian Founders"" such as Washington, Jefferson, et al.  The sad reality is that these men were anything but Christians, as can be readily observed by their own writings (including what they didn't say as much as what they did--after all, if a man is a Christian, it should be obvious from his life.  Jesus said he who is ashamed of or denies Him before men will himself be denied in the end.)

This is not a perfect film as there is a lot to cover, even in 3 hours, but overall it does an excellent job of marshaling the facts regarding this very important topic.  It will not be a pleasant pill to take for most American Christians to hear that many of their political heroes were deists, agnostics or outright atheists.  Yet the truth is the truth, even if it is unpopular or difficult to hear.  The film does go down a couple of rabbit trails such as the bodies in Franklin's house or Washington's alleged deathbed conversion to Catholicism.  Foes of this film will probably latch on to those issues rather than face the overwhelming force of evidence presented in the film that the American Revolution was conceived and led by non-Christians.  Although this documentary does not address the implications of this line of thinking, many Christians both then and now believe the Revolution was an unbiblical venture (see Romans 13 and elsewhere).

I encourage anyone who has been influenced by David Barton, D. James Kennedy, ""Little Bear"" Wheeler and others of their school to get this film and prayerfully view it.  Your eyes may be opened, unless you choose to keep them closed.",1288310400,57,2063,4.729050279329609
4263900,5,B00461VOPO,"I found ""The Hidden Faith of the Founding Fathers"" DVD by Chris Pinto of Adullam films to be a timely documentary that deals with the true beliefs of our founding fathers and how these beliefs came to frame our founding documents. Were our founding Fathers Christian, according to the Bible? And, was it the original intent of these revolutionaries to found America on the teachings of Jesus and Biblical principles or base their founding principles on their own reason.

Chris Pinto carefully takes us on an examination of 5 of the major framers of the American Revolution and what history has shown their true beliefs to be according to their own writings and witnesses who conversed with these men.

Also, Chris explains the dangers of Patriotic Faith or Patriotic Christianity, which is being taught in our churches by Barton and others today and the dangers of this movement.

This documentary is very well done and is quite informative on what many of our founders actually believed and how their beliefs came to frame our founding documents and our nation.",1287532800,18,1063,4.927374301675978

The irrefutable truths regarding the philosophies and beliefs of the Founding Fathers and America's beginnings presented in this film are critical to understanding the deception being perpetrated upon undiscerning Christians, the false teaching of Dominionism. Do your homework and check the facts, don't submit meekly to polished presentations designed to enlist your dollars and support to Con-servative causes and candidates. God is not a Con-servative, neither is he a Liberal, He is so far above and beyond all that it is unimaginable to attempt to box Him into a worldly philosophy. When I dialogue with Christians regarding America, I ask them 'When you speak of America, what do you mean? Do you mean America the land, with its incredibly beautiful and rich natural variety and wealth of natural resources? Do you mean the American people, also (at least at one time) incredibly prosperous and varied culturally? Do you mean the American government, which, for better or worse, oversees it all? Or do you mean the large American and multinational corporations that mostly seem hell-bent on raping plundering and pillaging God's natural bounty? (Rev. 11:18) Do you mean all the above? That's a lot of complex territory to render down to a single descriptive word, a nation.' Although America since its inception has had a significant Christian population, America has never been a Christian nation, is not today a Christian nation, and will never be a Christian nation. Beware the Dominionists and their lies.",1287446400,17,1724,5.070422535211268
4263902,5,B00461VOPO,"The Hidden Faith Of The Founding Fathers is an interesting and challenging movie, providing perspective on the true history of our Nation's beginnings.  It produces documented proof of our Founding Father's true feelings toward the Christ, and Christianity and also what they did believe and whom they associated with in regards to their true feelings of Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.  What you have been taught about these men has been wrong.  What your pastor is saying about our Founding Father's true faith is wrong.  Sure, everyone knows about the dead bodies in Benjamin Franklin's basement, but what about the other guys?  You will be surprised, because this film brings things you've never heard before about the men who brought us the Novus Ordo Seclorum.

4263903,2,B00461VOPO,"The narrator Chris Pinto is waging his own personal vendetta against another person (who is also a right-wing fundamentalist), is touting a conspiracy theory against the beliefs of the founding fathers, is attacking the Age of Reason, is using his definition of Christianity as the ONLY definition of Christianity, and is trying to portray various people as anti-Christs, including Barrack Obama, Thomas Paine, and all the popes of the Catholic church. The only reason this gets two stars instead of one is that it is reasonably well-organized and does a good job of explaining how you can take quotes out of the context as a whole to give a wrong impression. Unfortunately, Pinto is guilty of exactly the same thing. The only thing that I agree with is that most of the founding fathers of the United States were not right-wing fundamentalists and they did not try to turn this country into a Christian country. He fails to see though that they tried to make it a country that allows religious freedom and that they refrained from forcing the people to believe what they believed. I personally don't think that Amazon should be offering films with such religious propaganda. In fairness, I watched every single minute of this film, so I did NOT base my review on just the first few minutes as many other reviews of this film did.",1498348800,,1330,4.78695652173913

Yes, the truth can be very painful but as the Holy Bible tells us in the words of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, ""And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free"" Luke 8:32. This documentary explains a lot for the condition the United States Of America is currently in and unfortunately becoming worse. Just because the truth makes one uncomfortable and just because one chooses to not believe, doesn't change the facts......This documentary was researched and the words spoken are from the Founding Father's themselves.....how is that disputed??

These days this fact flummoxes a portion of our American Christian community. And so we see one of two reactions, arguing either (1) these men really were preeminently Christians -- that is, essentially denying that they were Masons -- or (2) that these men, as Masons, were antichrists -- as we see in this video -- and thus the Constitution itself, with the freedoms it guarantees, is becomes at least somewhat of an apostasy.

I cannot say I'm well versed in this subject, so I don't feel the need to get into a wordy debate of a review. But simply as a documentary, it's easy to watch. Pinto has good engagement in his presentation. And the visuals aren't bad. As for content, even without knowing much on the subject, there are obvious flaws in the argument and evidence. Use of statements such as ""It has been said..."" Which left me asking, where did ""it"" come from? Sometimes cited sources are simply from a 19th century historian. So I wonder where did this historian get his information? What is his source? And Pinto often fills in gaps of what people may have done or even thought at the time without any basis or reference. His bias really shows. Plus there are some stretches towards conclusions without presenting other plausible explanations... If I were a judge or jury in a courtroom, I would dismiss much of his argument as hearsay.

On the other hand, it validates my personal belief that this Country as a Christian Nation could be nothing further from the truth.  As was brought out, the Founding Fathers were rational, logical thinkers, more than Christian believers.  What sickens me is this documentary's constant effort to lift up the Christian bible over the Founding Fathers; almost as if to say God's law supersedes the Founding Fathers, the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.

4263958,5,B00461VOPO,"Of course the 'Founding-Fathers' were not these 'born-again', bible-believing, 'filled-with-the-spirit' Christians, anyone studying real history and taking their Christian-blinders off will understand this to be true.  They wanted a 'secular' government, and NOT a religious government as was the case in England!  The words: ""Norvus, Ordo Seclorum"", regardless of how history/Christians have tried to change the meaning of those words (Christians are KNOWN to do that so as to give credence to their god-delusion)...what those words literally mean is: New Order Secular, or as in Latin many words in a sentence may be odd to us in their placement, it means: New Secular Order!  The words 'under god', and 'in god we trust' were ADDED, and were not a part of the original(s).

We understand that most Christians are like 'sheep' as they are called many times in the bible, however, they are also like parrots repeating that which they've been told by lying, deceiving, misinformed Christians. Then, of course by the usage of the 'Repetition Principle', they all just 'know' that the lies told them by Christianity/Christians must be true.

Most Christians are extremely misinformed, and can be 'quite-dumb' in many simple to understand matters; that is not an ad-hominem attack, just factual. One example out of many would be GOP candidate Dr. Ben Carson, an obviously brilliant man, but Christianity has caused a part of his brain to make him a moron it what seems to be, so far, almost every area of life, knowledge, and understanding (sans of course his own field). He, (as are most Christians), is living in a world of delusional thinking. Those that are not able to 'see' his delusion, are also a part of his 'cult', the Jesus-cult, so they are blind, their brains/minds have 'shut-off' any negative information concerning their god-delusion.

The IQ, nor the letters suffixing a Christians name matters not, Christianity causes portions of the brain/mind to malfunction, and this has been PROVEN!  Most Christians don't even know their own bible very-well, and this includes Pastors, and bible-teachers.....I know that for a FACT!  Most, almost ALL Christians have never read the bible from cover to cover, page by page even ONCE!
If they don't know the book they want to defend never having read it in its entirety, then how can one expect them to understand/read/study about actual historical events?!  To the Christian brain/mind, a fictional character walking on water, and/or a man living inside a fish....are to them....'historical events'....that's the delusion one must deal with when trying to have a rational discourse with most Christians.

The Christian brain/mind has become corrupted/trained to accept unproven biblical fantasy as reality  ...(talking animals, a bush on fire and talking etc.etc.etc.)......yet deny proven facts such as evolution.
Trying to teach a Christian about actual scientific, and/or historical truth, is next to impossible due to one of the mental disorders Christianity can cause, is having severe cognitive dissonance to any information which may go against the Christians 'faith'.

So of course most Christians are going to get upset when any part of their delusion has become revealed as not being true.  In the past, Christians fought us over such things as: gravity, geocentrism, the Earth being a sphere etc.. Christians arguing over scientific facts which may go against the prevailing Christian dogma at the time, has always been part of the Christian delusion. They fought science then, and as history shows to oftentimes repeat itself, it is being repeated by those in the Jesus-cult to this very day.  The scenario is the same, only the subject matter may be different, this time Christians are fighting us with evolution, the Big-Bang and-so-on, instead of gravity, geocentrism et.al..",1452384000,4,3843,5.2479608482871125

I have to say I do not accept all of the premises or conclusions, but there is fascinating documentation of statements made or written by various founders which makes it hard to identify many of them as Christian vs Deist. There are other sides than that presented by the producer on both sides of where he stands in his conclusions of the faith of many of the founders. It left me with a great sense of gratitude that America was founded in a way in which an individual was not required to accept a particular doctrinal position in order to be considered a good citizen, unlike all country's ever in existence in all of human history beforehand. My conclusion is that some founders were absolutely ""born again"" true believers and some were not and that it can be unwise to try to make a conclusion about what any person's standing with the Lord may be based upon one or a few statements, especially public personalities in the sphere of politics or diplomacy. This film at first turned me off a little bit. In the end it left me with less certainty about my understanding.

It's like a spaghetti of reason to reach a single conclusion. Like he twisted facts to fit his agenda.

Most of the sources quoted in the film are not credible by any means. Many of the books used, were published well after the events of the American Revolution (like Rulers of Evil, published in 1999). With all of the journals and diaries that the Founding Fathers kept, you'd think that the theory that drives this film could easily be connected using their own words, but the fact is, it can not. Many of the words and beliefs attributed to the ""founders"" in this film are mere speculation. The biographers were not there, and nor were their sources.

However, I decided on one star because 1) the accurate information is peppered in amongst so much inaccurate, misleading, and biased information that only someone already at least a little familiar with these subjects could tell the difference; and 2) the film is misleadingly packaged as an objective historical examination when that is absolutely not the truth. My longer explanation is below.

Although this documentary presents itself in the summary and in the opening statements of the narrator/commentator as a simple historical examination of the religious beliefs of the founding fathers, it soon becomes clear that it is actually a religious/ideological statement. The actual purpose is to argue that the teachings of the founding fathers should not be a part of modern Christianity, and that modern Christians should stop thinking that the U.S. is a Christian nation and therefore that Christians should be politically involved.

The format is to examine the writings of and evidence about one man at a time, then after it has been established that this particular one was not a Christian, to discuss how ""sad"" and ""unfortunate"" it is that he did not repent his blasphemous views even on his death bed and not even when a bunch of good Christians begged him to do so and warned him of his impending damnation. Viewers are then treated to several biblical verses assuring them that the man's beliefs resulted in him going to hell.

There is some good historical information, including quotations from the founding fathers themselves, that more or less accurately portrays what several of them believed. However, there is also a lot of information presented so sloppily, with so little proper context, and with so much innuendo that it is, at best, half-truth and, at worst, blatant misinformation. The film frequently makes extraordinary, sensational claims and then attempts to back them up by discounting more reasonable explanations with little more than ""Yeah but our sensational explanations totally make more sense if you think about it,"" and sometimes altogether ignoring contrary evidence (I can only assume they hope viewers won't know enough about these subjects to notice the omissions). Additionally, some information is clearly based not on facts and evidence so much as on biased assumptions that certain groups have long spouted as fact (e.g. about Free Masons and the Illuminati); there is enough factual information to attempt to present a veneer of objectivity, but there are many statements that would make an experienced viewer laugh out loud.",1431043200,57,2688,5.275700934579439

It made me feel very patriotic and American, and determined to always question and opposed people and politicians who continue to spout Christian quackery to justify their actions and polices.

The premise is ridiculous!!  That's what makes this country so phenomenal -- and long lasting!!  The people fleeing Europe during that time were so fed up with being told what to believe and how to practice that basing the development of a new nation on one religion (divided into sects as it was) would have been a disaster from the start!  The God Jesus teaches us to love rather than fear in the New Testament is inclusionary, rather than exclusionary.  If we can't co-exist, how on earth would we ever spread the Word in the first place?  Nearly all brilliant minds throughout history trusted too much in their own wisdom -- and in only what they could see and prove physically.  I don't know why we would be surprised to find that the most intellectually developed minds of the time would fit that category.  I BELIEVE, whether the founding fathers did or not, that they truly were guided by the Holy Spirit to create a nation in a Promised Land where ALL people could develop and grow and become something more than what they had been!

4264077,2,B00461VOPO,"Our founding fathers have always been respected (to the point of worship) for establishing a great, enduring nation based on lofty principals.  At the same time, the religious views of the founders have been greatly debated.  Secular historians have always said that the founders--Washington, Jefferson, Adams, Franklin, Paine--were not religious Christians but Enlightenment Deists, and that constitutional precepts such as tolerance, freedom of religion and freedom of speech grew out of this secular Enlightenment foundation.  More recently, some conservative Christians have tried to show by selective quotations that these revered figures were actually believing Christians who intended to found a nation based on Christian principles.

This movie takes an interesting third position.  Coming from a very religious, conservative Christian viewpoint, it nonetheless agrees with historians that the founders were greatly Influenced by the Enlightenment and were not  religious Christians.  It quotes extensively from their writings (which, again, historians have known about for two centuries) to clearly establish this fact.  But then the film concludes that because of this lack of belief in Christianity, the founders were essentially evil, or at least misguided and unworthy of our respect.

Conspiracy elements such as the Illuminati and Satanism are thrown in without evidence of any connection to the founders.  On the other hand, the influences of Freemasonry and European philosophers cited in the film are undeniable, as are the founders' own numerous statements of skepticism regarding many aspects of Christianity.  Washington's refusal to take communion was an interesting point.

I come from a different perspective from the religious absolutists who made this film, but i can agree with them on one fundamental point: the founders of our country had nothing in common with them and did not found this country based on the principles they espouse.

Pinto mostly quotes Jefferson, Adams, Washington, Franklin and Payne throughout the movie.  These were the most vocal about their religious beliefs.

 In searching for if George Washington was a Christian I immediately was overwhelmed with not just a few letters chosen out of context that organizations with volumes of proof. Chris  Pinto went out of his way to disapprove a band who use snippets of many letters to prove the founders Christian beliefs. That he would and took a few letters and said that these proves that those snippets were invalid because they were the letters  whole, while not producing all the exact letters. But he is guilty of the same thing but other much grander scale as there is much more proof of the founders Christianity in history that there is of the few letters that Chris Pinto was able to scrounge up split between four founding fathers over three hours about their concerns for religious leaders that were not true to their faith. In truth just for example take George Washington the leaf was not only in Christianity but his actions and his life was based upon Christianity as witnessed by this letter. Much more is on the site where this letter was taken from: http://www.ushistory.org/valleyforge/youasked/060.htm

Q.Could you please tell me the primary source where George Washington states ""It is impossible to rightly govern the world without God and the Bible""? and Could you please tell me if there is any proof that George Washington was a Christian? I understand he does not speak much about his being a Christian in his writings but that he did attend church. Would you happen to have any quotes by him? Thank you for your help.
K.P.

A.There are hundreds of writings of Washington out there. In fact, the University of Virginia has been publishing volumes of work for 50 (I believe!) years now. They are well over a hundred volumes strong. You can find more about them at:www.virginia.edu/gwpapers

Also, another great place to look on the web is at theLibrary of Congress. You can do a search for specific topics or phrases from his writings.

As for your question regarding the quote, I do not have the whole text, but the date is September 17, 1796.

For your other question regarding George Washington  was he a Christian? There are several schools of thought. Some consider him a Deist, others a devout Episcopal, others a Christian. Then, there is the thought, what do you mean by Christian? Many people consider themselves Christian whether they are ""Catholic"" or ""Born-Again."" George Washington certainly was a religious man. His own diary shows of his dedication. For one perspective, you could read the book ""George Washington, The Christian"" by William J. Johnson. (Nashville, TN: Abingdon Press, 1919). Also, for specific quotes related to this subject, a nice compilation of materials from various sources including Washington is ""America's God and Country: Encyclopedia of Quotations"" by William J. Federer. (Coppell, TX: Fame Publishing, Inc., 1994).

For another thought, the letter below was written by George Washington's adopted daughter (also his step-granddaughter) Eleanor (Nelly) Parke Custis Lewis. It was written in 1833 in response to author Jared Sparks [who compiled a set of Washington's Writings] request for info on Washington's religious beliefs for a book he was writing that was published under the title ""The Life of Washington"".

Woodlawn, 26 February, 1833.

Sir,

I received your favor of the 20th instant last evening, and hastento give you the information, which you desire.

Truro Parish is the one in which Mount Vernon, Pohick Church, and Woodlawn are situated. Fairfax Parish is now Alexandria. Before the Federal District was ceded to Congress, Alexandria was in Fairfax County. General Washington had a pew in Pohick Church, and one in Christ Church at Alexandria. He was very instrumental in establishing Pohick Church, and I believe subscribed largely. His pew was near the pulpit. I have a perfect recollection of being there, before his election to the presidency, with him and my grandmother. It was a beautiful church, and had a large, respectable, and wealthy congregation, who were regular attendants.

He attended the church at Alexandria, when the weather and roads permitted a ride of ten miles. In New York and Philadelphia he never omitted attendance at church in the morning, unless detained by indisposition. The afternoon was spent in his own room at home; the evening with his family, and without company. Sometimes an old and intimate friend called to see us for an hour or two; but visiting and visitors were prohibited for that day.

No one in church attended to the services with more reverential respect. My grandmother, who was eminently pious, never deviated from her early habits. She always knelt. The General, as was then the custom, stood during the devotional parts of the service. On communion Sundays, he left the church with me, after the blessing, and returned home, and we sent the carriage back for my grandmother.

It was his custom to retire to his library at nine or ten o'clock, where he remained an hour before he went to his chamber. He always rose before the sun, and remained in his library until called to breakfasdt [sic]. I never witnessed his private devotions. I never inquired about them. I should have thought it the greatest heresy to doubt his firm belief in Christianity. His life, his writings, prove that he was a Christian. He was not one of those who act or pray, ""that they may be seen of men."" He communed with his God in secret.

My mother resided two years at Mount Vernon, after her marriage with John Parke Custis, the only son of Mrs. Washington. I have heard her say that General Washington always received the sacrament with my grandmother before the revolution. When my aunt, Miss Custis, died suddenly at Mount Vernon, before they could realize the event, he knelt by her and prayed most fervently, most affectingly, for her recovery. Of this I was assured by Judge Washington's mother, and other witnesses.

He was a silent, thoughtful man. He spoke little generally; never of himself. I never heard him relate a single act of his life during the war I have often seen him perfectly abstracted, his lips moving, but no sound was perceptible. I have sometimes made him laugh most heartily from sympathy with my joyous and extravagant spirits. I was probably one of the last persons on earth to whom he would have addressed serious conversation, particularly when he knew that I had the most perfect model of female excellence ever with me as my monitress, who acted the part of a tender and devoted parent, loving me as only a mother can love, and never extenuating or approving in me what she disapproved in others.

She never omitted her private devotions, or her public duties; and she and her husband were so perfectly united and happy, that he must have been a Christian. She had no doubts, no fears for him. After forty years of devoted affection and uninterrupted happiness, she resigned him without a murmur into the arms of his Savior and his God, with the assured hope of his eternal felicity. Is it necessary that any one should certify, ""General Washington avowed himself to me a believer in Christianity?"" As well may we question his patriotism, his heroic, disinterested devotion to his country. His mottos were, ""Deeds, not Words""; and, ""For God and my Country.""

With sentiments of esteem, I am, & c.

The founding fathers are so highly revered in our country that this is a great point of debate. I don't know a lot about the subject, so I approached this with an open and curious mind. I had to stop after about 15 minutes because I couldn't stand it anymore. The documentary has very poor production values and is very biased, taking the perspective of an espiecally preachy Christian condemning the founding fathers as evil anti-christs. (Yes, the word ""anti-christ"" was used). They used faulty evidence, misinterpreted or entirely misquoted testimonies, and cheesy conspiracy theories to support this. One of the main narrators was literally up-in-your-face, taking up most of the frame, making me wish I could reach through the screen and slap his over-zealous face.

Amusingly enough, this documentary has the unique ability to piss off both godless heathens like me, and devout Christians, as you will see the the crowded one-star section of the reviews here.

Like Thomas Payne. The structure of Common Sense and the theology utilized have no connection to any other Payne work.
Then add that Ben Franklin advised Payne against publishing the Rights of Man and other French revolutionary fashionable pseudo philosophy.
Only intervention by Jefferson would enable Payne to escape the French Revolution by returning to America.
Of course the famous obituary for Payne. Did some good. Did more Bad. Rest in peace.
Truth is Common Sense is clearly some product of Franklin and Payne was the useful dummy.

As for Ben

  I think the System of Morals [devised by Jesus] and his Religion as he left them to us, the best the World ever saw, or is likely to see; but I apprehend it has received various corrupting Changes, and I have with most of the present Dissenters in England, some Doubts as to his Divinity.

Perhaps Ben is not saved. But this is a completely different proposition from judging his philosophy as applied to our founding documents.

Dare I say, the world needs opposing viewpoints.

This film seems to tiptoe around the fact that this country is not founded as an expressly ""Christian"" nation; rather, it is a nation of freedom of religion - or from religion. The shocking aspect of this construct is that any modern American would be so painfully unaware of the facts the film presents - that the founders were mostly Deists, that the Revolution was an outgrowth of the Enlightenment. We should all know this by now. The real travesty is that the truth is often veiled and the country is inaccurately dubbed a Christian nation.

This film also suffers from the fanatical fear mongering we've come to expect from contemporary conspiracy theorists, with its overdose of dramatic music and references to the fabled Illuminati, which is probably one of the most overblown points of conversation among conspiracy theorists at this point.

In the process of researching a book on lying I came across this appalling and hate-filled spewing of misinformation from religious bigot Chris Pinto. In the form of a 3-plus hour documentary film, Pinto defames our Founding Fathers, millions of Christians whose beliefs do not align with his perverted version of reality, our President who according to Pinto is a closet Muslim, multiple Popes and pretty well any historic figure he could misrepresent to make his case. Bigots like Pinto use pseudoscience and contaminated historic analysis to develop their argument. Laughingly Pinto dedicates a whole section of the documentary to expose the devices that fellow Christian bigot David Barton uses to deceive his audience, while Pinto uses the exact devices himself throughout the video - the word hypocrite comes to mind. Pinto makes frequent references to the Bible as though the text represented historic fact and uses extracts from both the Old and New Testaments as a counterpoint to quotes (often taken out of context) from letters, speeches and other documents in the historic record. In other places in time and or location this could be construed as heresy.  Pinto should be thankful to the people he reviles who gave us the First Amendment.

4264120,1,B00461VOPO,"Our Founding Fathers where very religious and Christian.  Here are a very few documented facts that will help you.

George Washington wrote, ""You do well to wish to learn our arts and ways of life, and above all, the religion of Jesus Christ. These will make you a greater and happier people than you are.""  (George Washington, The Writings of Washington, John C. Fitzpatrick, editor (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1932), Vol. XV, p. 55, from his speech to the Delaware Indian Chiefs on May 12, 1779.)

George Washington wrote, ""While we are zealously performing the duties of good citizens and soldiers, we certainly ought not to be inattentive to the higher duties of religion. To the distinguished character of Patriot, it should be our highest glory to add the more distinguished character of Christian.""  (George Washington, The Writings of Washington, John C. Fitzpatrick, editor (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1932), Vol. XI, pp. 342-343, General Orders of May 2, 1778.)

George Washington wrote, ""I now make it my earnest prayer that God would most graciously be pleased to dispose us all to do justice, to love mercy, and to demean ourselves with that charity, humility, and pacific temper of the mind which were the characteristics of the Divine Author of our blessed religion.""  (George Washington, The Last Official Address of His Excellency George Washington to the Legislature of the United States (Hartford: Hudson and Goodwin, 1783), p. 12; see also The New Annual Register or General Repository of History, Politics, and Literature, for the Year 1783 (London: G. Robinson, 1784), p. 150.)

Benjamin Franklin wrote, ""As to Jesus of Nazareth, my opinion of whom you particularly desire, I think the system of morals and His religion as He left them to us, the best the world ever saw or is likely to see.""  (Benjamin Franklin, Works of Benjamin Franklin, John Bigelow, editor (New York: G.P. Putnams Sons, 1904), p. 185, to Ezra Stiles, March 9, 1790.)

John Adams wrote, ""The Christian religion is, above all the religions that ever prevailed or existed in ancient or modern times, the religion of wisdom, virtue, equity and humanity.""  (John Adams, Works, Vol. III, p. 421, diary entry for July 26, 1796.)

John Adams wrote, ""The general principles on which the fathers achieved independence were the general principles of Christianity. I will avow that I then believed, and now believe, that those general principles of Christianity are as eternal and immutable as the existence and attributes of God.""  (Thomas Jefferson, The Writings of Thomas Jefferson (Washington D. C.: The Thomas Jefferson Memorial Association, 1904), Vol. XIII, p. 292-294. In a letter from John Adams to Thomas Jefferson on June 28, 1813.)

The Declaration of Independence affirmed the Founding Fathers belief and trust in God in these words: We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.

The Convention delegates had completed their work. As Gladstone said, it was the most wonderful work ever struck off at a given time by the brain and purpose of man (William Gladstone, North American Review, Sept. Oct. 1878, p. 185)
The delegates were the recipients of heavenly inspiration. James Madison, often referred to as the father of the Constitution, wrote: It is impossible for the man of pious reflection not to perceive in it a finger of that Almighty hand which has been so frequently and signally extended to our relief in the critical stages of the revolution (The Federalist, no. 37, ed. Henry Cabot Lodge, New York: G. P. Putnams Sons, 1983, p. 222).

Alexander Hamilton, famous as the originator of The Federalist papers and author of fifty-one of the essays, said: For my own part, I sincerely esteem it a system, which without the finger of God, never could have been suggested and agreed upon by such a diversity of interest (Essays on the Constitution of the United States, ed. Paul L. Ford, 1892, pp. 25152).

Charles Pinckney, a very active participant and author of the Pinckney Plan during the Convention, said: When the great work was done and published, I was struck with amazement. Nothing less than the superintending Hand of Providence, that so miraculously carried us through the war  could have brought it about so complete, upon the whole (Essays on the Constitution, p. 412).

During his first inaugural address in 1789, President George Washington, a man who was raised up by God, said: No people can be bound to acknowledge and adore the invisible hand, which conducts the affairs of men, more than the people of the United States. Every step by which they have advanced to the character of an independent nation seems to have been distinguished by some token of providential agency (First Inaugural Address, 30 Apr. 1789).

John Adams said, Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other. (The Works of John Adams, ed. C. F. Adams, Boston: Little, Brown Co., 1851, 4:31).

John Hancock, he called on the entire state to pray that universal happiness may be established in the world [and] that all may bow to the scepter of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the whole earth be filled with His glory.""  (John Hancock, A Proclamation For a Day of Public Thanksgiving 1791, given as Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, from an original broadside in our possession.)

But this is a strange, maverick kind of production, whose theme is an intended refutation of the idea that our founding fathers were traditional, devout Christians who wanted America to be founded on Christian principles - a critique not from the secular left but from the Christian right (!).  The creator of this documentary, Christian Pinto, is indeed a Christian horse of a different color (pun intended).  What's interesting is that much of his thesis is solidly based in historical fact.  Most of our ""founding fathers"" were indeed deists, freethinkers, and skeptics, and were especially opposed to the kind of established state religion associated in Europe with centuries of senseless religious wars and social and intellectual oppression.  I'm unsure regarding the validity of some of the contentions presented regarding the supposed extensive influence of freemasonry and the Bavarian Illuminati, but much of the factual analysis presented has validity, and is much more honest than the use of ""cherry-picked"" quotations, used by others of the Christan right, to advance the idea that America was intended to be a republic based on Christian theocratic dogma.  Where I depart sharply from Pinto's point-of-view is in his assumption (presented essentially as a ""given"" with little philosophical support) that the secular nature of our founding, and the ideas of the founding fathers, were horrible for our country.  I'm one of those secularists who believes that the secular basis of our government is an essential saving grace.  While providing freedom for anyone to pursue whatever religious inclination they wish, we have been spared the inevitable sectarian strife, religious bigotry, and social oppression that would have followed, had this country truly been founded as a Christian theocracy. (Not that we haven't had problems enough even without being a theocracy).

This is anything but a religious puff-piece, instead presenting selective historical reference and revisionism to show how areligious the founders were. Further, that America was founded by anti-Christian blasphemers.

Severely lacking are first-hand accounts of most of the film's subjects (exceptions of Paine & Jefferson). The featured founders wrote extensively on their faith, or lack thereof. Yet mysteriously missing from the film are the writings of these founders themselves, unless indicating a lack or doubt of faith. Instead, Pinto chooses to cite observational opinions from the founders' contemporaries (as well as out-of-context quotes from Jefferson and Adams specifically), many of whom were not more than mere acquaintances to the founders themselves. Worse, he relies upon ""testimony"" from historians writing centuries later than when any of the featured founders were alive. To any historian worth the paper upon which his PhD is printed, such sources are known to be the most unreliable and least useful compared to first-hand accounts (of which in this subject there are plenty). For example, Washington wrote more than 100 volumes of works himself, and spoke exhaustively on his faith in his own words. Jefferson, while questioning the Trinity and the virgin birth, did in fact believe Jesus to be the son of God and attended Christian church consistently at the Capitol while serving as President.

Also, Pinto focuses on a handful of our founding fathers: Paine, Jefferson, Franklin, John Adams, and Washington. The majority of the film is focused on Paine, the most ardent Deist of our founding era. Sure, I am convinced Paine was not Christian, but the rest would require compelling evidence; however, little-to-none within context is presented. See paragraph above. But what about the remaining +/- 240 founding fathers? If anti-Christianity was so rampant in the founding era, more subjects would have been easily included. Yet they were not, and for good reason. The overwhelming majority of these remaining hundreds of founders were devout Christians. Many earned seminary / Bible degrees, started Bible schools, created Christian Sunday school movements, and financially backed and supported the printing and distribution of the Bible throughout America.

More, I couldn't keep up with all the conspiracy theory tangents. Illuminati, NWO, East India Company...I was hoping to at least be entertained on these topics, let alone possibly learn a few ""intriguing"" morsels. However, the film's details were merely prima-facie and lacked any real conviction. They fell flat as simple tangents to the film's titled subject matter.

And finally as a Christian, I find it deplorable for another Christian to claim to know what was in the hearts of men professing to be believers. I take men like Washington, Adams, and Jefferson at their words when professing faith in Christianity. I also take Pinto at his word when he claims faith in Christ. To judge the person and not the sin is not a Christian tenet. Pinto can take issue with the decisions these men made, but he has no Christian basis to question their faith when they declared it in their own words. They called themselves Christians (Jefferson, Adams, & Washington) and lived their lives according to Christ's teachings as best they understood as mortal human beings. Even Pinto lives an imperfect life, so he is merely marginalizing based on the degree of imperfection.

If my review doesn't dissuade you from wasting your time watching this film, then at least know that you can watch it for free on Amazon Instant Video as well as other sites.

Based upon this work alone, I find Pinto to be either fundamentally misguided or intellectually lazy, or both. I will not be seeking out any more of his ""works.""",1390867200,8,3911,5.229665071770335

I would think this would be welcomed into the public school classrooms here in the 21st century since there is a drift away from religion in schools, and the DVD documents that such a drift is exactly what the Founding Fathers hoped would come to pass.

I recommend it to the curious and the open-minded.

This portion, while difficult for many to watch and hence the negative reviews, exposes very frankly the truth behind  right-wing conservatives who denounce our country for the founding belief in separation of church and state, and instead believe in the need to proclaim our government as based on the Christian religion rather than being a government for and by the people (infidels).

America is NOT a Christian nation. Never has been. Never will be. Pinto cites the beliefs of the Pilgrims and Puritans (You remember, they of the Concentration Camp-like existence, the reverence of wealth, and the Salem Witch Trials.) over the system of government left to us by by the Founders. The fact is that these flawed, yet ordinary, men put their religious inquiries and beliefs aside and created a governmental system that (with the exception of their oversights that led to the Civil War, has served us well for more than two centuries. These men created a nation open to people of all races and beliefs, where people are welcome to come and pursue their own separate religious journeys and behave as they will as long as their actions do not infringe on the rights of others. That sense of tolerance is what has made us a strong nation.

4264187,1,B00461VOPO,"This propaganda piece simply denies the overall history of the founding of our nation.  Some of the founders were very skeptical of organized religion because of the priestcraft of the paid ministers of their day, and that tradition has continued to our day.  They recognized that ministers drew near to God with their lips, but their hearts were far from Him.  They taught the doctrines, the commandments of men.
For example, the narrator somehow thinks it is bad that Washington believed in a land where people were free to worship as they personally saw fit.  God would have that His people choose to follow His Son, the Savior Jesus Christ, but He does not compel any man or woman to do so because God wants people to freely chose good instead of evil.  The founder's vision of a free land is consistent with the Holy Bible.  Satan and the philosophies of evil men and women want people to be compelled and controlled.
Paine and Jefferson to some degree were probably the least religious of those men, and it was good that Jefferson was in France when the Constitutional Convention took place as he had a socialist streak in him as did Paine, I believe.  Franklin was the man who asked that the convention pray, for they needed the wisdom of God to create the Constitution.  He reminded them that prayer was crucial to winning the Revolutionary War.  Were these men perfect? Hardly, but they put their lives, their names and all they possessed on the line to further the cause of freedom.

There are no outside opinions, no expert interviews... just the Director/Producer's talking head the entire time. I don't profess to be an expert in the faith of our founding fathers, but this documentary does not seem to do any justice to the actual study of their beliefs. While the opinions of the documentary may be entirely true, they were not presented in a fashion to convince me one way or another.

Many of the writings the Director/Producer presents from Paine, 'Washington and others makes it appear the founding fathers were not Christian. I can't tell one way or another because full evidence and back and forths were not present in the documentary, but it appears to me that the founding fathers had a problem with the gospel of the time - that which had morphed and changed in Europe over centuries of the dark ages. The gospel of the time, taught by the Church of England in a reprehensible manner, is what I think these founding fathers were distancing themselves from.

I believe in good deeds, we need to make this world better, helping others and working every day to be less wrong and better ourselves. I don't believe that saying ""I repent"" should bought a ticket to a heavenly after life, that's the easy way.

I believe, that the bible is a great book, full of learning, and the the best part is the gospels. But, I do not abide to its divine origin.

I believe, that is a right of every human being to pursue happiness and that every one should be free to choose is own way. Freedom of choice is the foundation of the wider view of the world we live into and the way to explore and learn.

I do not believe in dogma, no one should be subject to the points of view of any one, you can agree or discent on the truth of ideas, but ultimately, the world is perceived though your own believes and ideas, and I can asure you, that you view changes, as everything in the natural world is subject to change and refinement until you get to know your self.

I rated this video so hight, because enlighten me to realice that a shared many of the views of The Founding Fathers, and that allow me to know a little more of my self.

I should have rated this video with one star, because I didn't like that the director/producer used it to bash on David Barton. I really didn't know the guy (and I really do not care his views).

This one is rather different and might help explain why the reviews are all over the place.  The positions here are:

1. Christians who believe the US is/was a Christian nation (with various civic implications).  I think this is probably the mainstream position among American Christians.  These positions are mentioned but not represented in the show.

2. Christians who believe this US was never a Christian nation (with various civic implications). I think this is a fringe position among American Christians, and is the stance taken in the film.

The production values are ok.  Pinto handles himself and his material relatively well.  The narration is a bit amateurish/cheesy.

4264199,4,B00461VOPO,"As an Episcopalian turned deist Unitarian, I thought I was very well informed about the very similar beliefs of many of the key founders of the republic.  However, I was stunned to learn how much crystal clear evidence exists for the premise that the US never intended to be a ""Christian nation.""  In fact, it would apparently be more accurate to say the founders were proactive and purposeful in being non-Christian, perhaps even anti-Christian, in their philosophies both personal and political.  It was also interesting to see/hear the differences in the reactions among them when confronted concerning their personal faith:  Paine was defiant, Jefferson was rational, Washington was evasive, Franklin was politely and passively curious, etc.

And here is the real kicker:  this is NOT some left-wing ""see we told you so"" effort to secularize the government and society.  Rather, it comes from the angle that the founders should stop being held up as Christians heroes because it misleads Christians into violating key tenets of the faith.  In other words, it's not a film aimed at protecting the purity of the nation, but rather the purity of the faithful.  For example, it takes an action or comment by one of the founders and juxtaposes it with a passage from the Bible to show the founders were flagrantly violating Christian doctrines and ""rules.""  Also, it repeatedly (and to somebody who has spent a lot of time studying the whole church-state thing) jarringly interjects adverbs and adjectives that reveal the underlying intent of the film.  For example, rather than saying something like ""On his death bed, Thomas Jefferson rejected the notion that Jesus was divine,"" the narrator would say, ""Unfortunately, even on his death bed, Thomas Jefferson never accepted the divinity of Jesus.""  Maybe that's a clever subterfuge rather than a sincere bias at work, but if so in my case it was certainly effective in bolstering the credibility of the evidence and arguments presented.

Speaking of, as is true with most historical detective work, I recommend you pay close attention to the cited sources for the quotes offered since the credibility varies a great deal in that there are personal letters and books and treaties and such that really cannot be questioned re the authenticity and accuracy of the alleged comments, but on the other hand there is also a lot of hearsay that may come with its own bias.

4264203,4,B00461VOPO,"Wow, was I surprised and amazed by this documentary.  Based on the title and some reviews I expected yet another misleading attempt by right-wing evangelicals like David Barton (of Glenn Beck fame) to prove that America's Founding Fathers were good Christians who founded our nation on Christianity.  The producers and narrator (Christian Pinto) are indeed very right-wing evangelical Christians.  If you didn't know that from researching them independently it becomes obvious early on in their choices of scriptural references and their clear disdain for Obama and Pelosi who they clearly think are phony Christians because they support abortion rights.

However, in the first two-thirds of this long film  running 3 hours -  the documentary does a thorough and reasonably scholarly job going through the historical documents, not in out-of-context snippets, like Barton and his ilk, but with full context and extrapolation via the Founders  documented interactions with their compatriots, family, friends, and even, in some cases, their slaves and pastors.  The film takes aim at Barton specifically and does a good job proving that the Founders (primarily Paine, Jefferson, Franklin, Adams, and Washington) were not Christians but rather Deists with a pagan Freemason foundation.  The film documents the many ways that not only Barton, but even religious Christians in the Founders day tried to mislead and whitewash the record to make the Founders appear Christian and attempted mightily , in vain, to obtain deathbed confessions from the likes of Paine and Franklin.

But the producers don't stop there.  They not only show the Founders weren't Christian but also demonstrate that most of them were openly hostile to Christianity and/or many of its tenants  rejecting Jesus divinity, virgin birth, miracles and many fables of the Old and New Testaments.  And this is where things get weird and make this such a strange product of the religious right.  Because the producers clearly concur that the Founders were infidels and anti-Christs and reference much Scripture to support that these men held evil ideas.  They then try to tie the freethinking evil ideas of the Founders to devil worship in the 19th-21th centuries and the election of phony Christians like Obama and Pelosi today  with far less scholarship evident to back this up.

So the film does a great job destroying one of the perversions of modern right wing evangelicals, to misleadingly portray the US as being founded by Christians with Christian principles.  So what are we to make of a country founded by such evil men?  The film is silent on this and how the founders could do something so great without a reliance on Christianity.  How is a Christian supposed to feel about this?  At least the misleading attempts to portray the Founders as Christian give us Christians a sense of solidarity and pride in our faith and Country.  This film creates an unintended chasm.  I don't know how to feel about that.  But as a comparatively liberal Christian (in comparison with the Barton, Beck, and the producers of this film), I cant buy this interpretation of history, though I do accept the facts that the Founders were not Christian.  I believe the pluralism of religious and non-religious freedom enabled by our Founders is our true strength and if it took non-Christians to see that light first, then so be it.

If you know little about history and want to hear how modern-day Christian fundamentalists look down their noses at the faith of our founding fathers, this ""documentary"" is for you. This is a propaganda piece. It's overly produced and constantly puts images of our founders onscreen to add a fictional legitimacy to the silly assertions made by the producers. It ridicules the intelligent, thoughtful, diverse faith (and well-considered non-faith) of our founders to make their points more appealing. Our founders were more educated, intelligent and deeply thoughtful than these clowns can understand.

Some of our founders were overtly, devoutly religious. Some held their faith in quiet dignity. Some were decidedly deistic but did not follow a particular religion.

We can measure the genius of our founders in many ways. One of the most important was how they chose to keep government and religion at arms-length. Our founders understood that faith and can be a crucial, formative element in individual lives. They knew that the religious views of men vary widely but the most important aspects of character are integrity, reason and tolerance.

Our founders knew that government-sponsored religion commonly results in tyranny and the suppression of freedom for citizens. I hope that people today can appreciate the way our founders valued and respected diverse opinions on faith and religion. I'm afraid this piece of work moves us in the opposite direction.

The producer(s) of this show are so blinded by the religious lens through which they see the world that they miss the bigger, more profound message of the history and contribution of our founders.

The intertwining of religion throughout a countries' government has always met with ruin. But somehow claiming the greatest country on earth is the enemy of true Christians seem to be the other side of the same coin.
It would be foolish to say that the founders were God fearing Christians and equally foolish to believe they were worshipers of reason. Historians often create a structure and order where there is little evidence of either. I find it hard to believe that a group as large as the continental congress all believed in reason or faith.
What is clear is that they believed that England was oppressive and that they could and wanted to do a better job. They didn't as far as we know sacrifice any animals like early Jews, Christians and Satanists and they didn't seem to rely on thinking alone. So perhaps this country was not founded one way or the other but rather by men who had enough of King George and his taxes. And maybe, just maybe they all arrived at this conclusion via different means.

These are biblical facts:

Jesus rebuked Peter for taking up the sword to defend himself.
Christianity is a faith, or a relationship with God
The mission of Christians is to bring reconciliation of God to men, not to condemn those who do not believe.
It is the Spirit of God who shall ""convict"" of sin.
Jesus said his kingdom is not of this world.
Israel was rebuked by God for desiring a ""kingdom"",  God does not desire ""Monarchies"".
ALL governments are given by God for the establishment of peace and justice.
Jesus says that his followers here his voice and will not listen to others.
Paul stated that the ""law"" causes death, but the ""Spirit"" brings life.
The only religion acknowledged by Paul is the practice of caring for widows and orphans.
Christians are saved by faith, but true faith brings works otherwise it is dead faith.

Why is it that Christians cannot understand that righteousness and faith shall never come through the ""law"", whether God's Law, or human law, nor USA Law?

4264257,4,B00461VOPO,"First, my main criticism of Pinto's work and of this video is what some others have rightly observed: There was no real need to tie in Illuminati-type conspiracies. The video could have stood on its own just fine using the quotes from Jefferson and others to support the thesis. The point would have been abundantly made but the conspiratorial clutter - whatever parts of it may actually be factual - just gets in the way.

I think Pinto's video provides a valuable service to those within the Body of Christ with ears to hear (and that ain't everyone, sadly). However, I agree with him from what's been a largely and sadly ignored angle: Where in the writings of the apostle Paul - Christ's designated apostle to the Gentiles - do we find even the possibility of a truly ""Christian nation,"" much less a mandate for establishing one? Nowhere. The closest we could possibly get would be a nation peopled and governed ENTIRELY by citizens who have believed the Gospel of grace. That is impossible. As Christianized as America perhaps was, once upon a time (for good or ill), it was never GODLY in the biblical sense, which is the only sense that matters. It definitely is not Christian now. To try to paint a veneer of godliness onto an utterly morally corrupted nation like this one by saying ""Hey, the Founders were Christians"" not only doesn't make the point they're trying to make - that America has some special ""in"" with Christ - but totally misses it and in fact serves only to deceive many more than already are deceived.

America is unique in all of human history, true, and I am thankful I was born to experience her blessings as she lay dying. But from her beginning, *as a nation* she was not ""Christian."" She was not God's. Individual Christians within her have done enormous good for the cause of Christ but America herself, like all Gentile nations, was and is an integral part of Satan's world system. No amount of massaging our history will change that and I applaud Chris Pinto for standing against the popular attempts to do so.",1360972800,9,2045,4.6464088397790055

4264259,1,B00461VOPO,"I have a real hard time seeing how Christian Pinto makes sense of his hypothesis on the collection of his work. Forgive me for this review in advance because there's just to much to rant about. First like all his movies the production isn't bad, but his formula is pretty much the same at how he makes a film. Find a few quotes, books, and authors who support your view and turn them into a documentary. This film like the rest of his essentially ruined my lust for conspiracy theories. It's really pretty easy to create a film based on any hypothesis. This makes me think I can pretty much make an argument that French Toast is the cause of all the calamities of the 20th century (with protools of course).

This film basically presents the ideas that a majority of the founding fathers where atheists and or a form of antichrist that are undermining our culture and how we view our form of Government. This is done based on their own words and (similar to how Pinto grabs at scripture) is taken out of a context and formulated into a (semi) coherent film. I say semi because like all of his films they are based on a house of cards where is one aspect is disproved the whole thing falls. He goes down the line through founding father and criticizes their writing for not supporting a literal Bible interpretation....or Chris Pinto's approved version of Christianity. Good Luck trying to find any two people who have the exact same beliefs regarding Christianity.

Another notion that came through my mind was..who cares? Most mainline history books have gone this at nauseam. When I read the Declaration of Independence or Bill of Rights I'm not making the connection to Christianity. I make the connection of allowing the freedom for individuals to make up their own damn mind. To allow people like Mr. Pinto the ability to critique everyone else's views on what constitutes being a Christian because his mind Catholics are not Christians as we learn that Washington made a deathbed conversion to Catholicism, which placed him on his Sheet list. No, only if you read the KJB written for 17th century Englishmen can you really learn about true Christianity.

One example is Thomas Jefferson. Criticizing Jefferson's religious views is nothing new and was done even in his day. But essentially Jefferson was a man who went through his life in varying correspondences trying to understand  religion as we all do. Pinto rails on him for creating his own interpretation of the Bible, wanting change scripture, and even eliminating parts of the Old Testament. This is presented of course with dark music and a cautious tone. Funny...Martin Luther wanted to eliminate the Old Testament, created his own Bible, and did change scripture to fit his ideologies. But Pinto won't que the dark music or present that in his anti-Catholic film Lamp in the Dark.  Like a majority of literal interpreters if it doesn't fit their argument you hear ""nope, it's not in the KJB"" but if it conflicts with their interpretation you'll hear ""well that's more of a metaphor"".

And just as he portrays the Catholics through a solely negative scope, he does the same of our founding fathers. Without Catholocism a majority of the world would not know Christ or even have collective manuscript format of the Bible. Without the founding fathers sincerity to allow freedom of thought and pursuit of happiness, Chris Pinto would not be able to create his ""documentary"". Mr. Pinto seems to want a Govt. overseen from a literal Biblical perspective. I.E a universal (Catholic) church governing the nation....But when the Catholics suggest that it's NWO propaganda. There's a sea of hypocrisy that people like Christian Pinto spout that will simply drive you mad trying to discern where their dogma begins and ends. Men are not perfect and neither were our founding fathers, you can find whatever you want to in them, but look at the larger picture and you'll see the greatness they created. Watching this honestly made me sick. Mr. Pinto.. how about focusing on the blatant atrocities affecting our world. Your megiddo series at least did that. Listening to him freak out on Jefferson's correspondences he had in a letter is just ridiculous and is no bombshell. Read some of our forefathers other quotes and sacrifices they made for our future. Washington alone was a man unbelievable character and morals that is rarely seen today.

I'll leave you with some other quotes

""The doctrines of Jesus are simple, and tend all the happiness of man; 1. That there is one only God, and He all perfect. 2 That there is a future state of rewards and punishments. 3 That to love God with all thy heart, and thy neighbor as thyself, is the sum of religion""-Jefferson

4264260,2,B00461VOPO,"The first explanation of this film is it is from a strictly evangelical Christian perspective where the Bible is taken literally.  It has an agenda, which is to convince the viewer that the Founding Fathers were not Christian by the producers definition.  According to them, no one can be Christian unless one takes communion, goes to church regularly, speaks publicly about their Christianity and that Christ is their savior. The last part of the video is quite ridiculous as they jump into the modern era and question President Obama's Christian beliefs.  They show a clip of President Obama being interviewed by an evangelical preacher and Obama says that he is a Christian and is asked further what that means to him, he goes on to say that he believes in Jesus and that Christ died for his sins.  This is still not proof to the producers of this film that Obama is indeed Christian because how can Obama say he is a Christian and believe in gay marriage and abortion.  That is complete nonsense and drops the video to a new low.  The producers and writers of this film are clearly Bible literalists, who have a very strict definition of who they consider ""real"" Christians and that doesn't include Catholics either. It's implied that there is a secret conspiracy of Vatican influence since the beginning of America and hints at a ""New World Order"" that the Catholic Church is in cahoots to secretly engineering.

The Founding Fathers were Masons and/ or Deists for the most part and although most of them believed in a God, according to the video, they didn't believe necessarily in a Christian God.  It is a fact that America was not founded as a Christian nation or any other religion.  The Founding Fathers knew of the undue influence religion had on European governments, so the separation of church and state was well thought out and very important to them.  The producers of the video are not happy about that and I guess they wish we in America lived in a theocracy based on one religion and strict adherence to evangelical Christian beliefs and that all law should come from the Bible.  The first 2/3 of the video is interesting in its history, but I could definitely do without the constant editorializing from Christian Pinto and his evangelical judgments of what makes a ""true"" Christian.

The last 1/3 of the video is absolutely ridiculous!  They question Obama's spirituality and religion as well as Nancy Pelosi's and hint that all liberals are secretly infidels because they believe in gay marriage and abortion.  All liberals must be atheists because they don't believe in their version of Christianity.  Their version is cultish thinking that if one doesn't believe exactly what they say is the literal interpretation of the Bible, then they're not going to heaven and all the founding fathers are in hell then, except for maybe George Washington because on his death bed he converted to Catholicism.  The video starts out as a rational and historical look at what the Founding Fathers religious/ spiritual beliefs were based on many of their writings and there are many, but devolves into a right wing attack on President Obama and all liberals making it quite silly and insipid.

The Founding Fathers; George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Thomas Paine, Benjamin Franklin were all intellectuals, most of them were Deists, a well known fact and were scientific and critical thinkers. Of course they would have had a critical view of Christianity and the Bible, this is not surprising.  I didn't appreciate the preaching the video turned into and I completely disagree with their view of Obama not being a Christian. Obama is a great example of a truly spiritual person with ""true and real"" Christian values because of his actions reflecting the teachings of Jesus. If Jesus was alive and American, he'd definitely be voting for Obama. Don't you think Jesus would want everybody to have affordable health care?  Don't you think Jesus would want the rich to pay their fair share in taxes for the good of society as a whole?  The answer is definitely yes.",1348012800,14,4086,4.860230547550432
4264261,5,B00461VOPO,"I have studied secret societies since soon after I trusted Jesus Christ as my savior.  As I studied the faith of the founders, I noticed many of them were Deists - this religion allowing for belief in a supreme being of their own making (so many believed, and still do).  Thomas Payne made it plain that this was as far as Deism agreed with the Word of God, though all the founders quoted it - as do many of our 'christian' leaders today.  Christian Pinto takes the same documents used by David Barton, expands the context and exposes the complete statements and feeling of the Founders.  It illuminates an entirely different understanding about the ""HIDDEN FAITH"", which when compared to the Word of God is exposed as 'another gospel'!  Also, Barton's attempt to white-wash the secret society prevalent in George Washingtons' day, seems to me to be as inaccurate as his history of the Founders. In my opinion, ""HIDDEN FAITH OF THE FOUNDING FATHERS should be shown in every fundamental Church - hopefully in many classrooms.",1338595200,14,1024,4.795454545454546

It presents cold, hard facts that support the founding fathers were NOT Christians, while maintaining a, what I feel is a fair, analysis of Christian beliefs as counter arguments.  As an Atheist, this documentary was proof that the lies Christians and politicians try to use to confuse the truth are just that.... lies and false.  Just so you know I am credible, I have a Masters Degree from the University of Oregon from the USA and a bachelors degree in teaching.  Therefore, you could presume to say that I am more credible than someone without said degrees from a credible university.  If you are sick of people on TV, politicians or others trying to cling to the belief that the FF's were Christians and set up the United States Government to be a Christian nation.... watch this documentary.

If you watch this video and disagree with it, you are basically an ideological moron who denies truth in order to continue believing what you want to believe.  I once bought into Barton's slight of hand, but no longer.  How does David Barton sleep at night?  I guess on a really expensive mattress paid for by his tours in DC.  You can't argue with the letters these men wrote expressing their disdain for Christianity.  As a Christian, that may disappoint me personally but I'd rather know the truth about our country than be deceived by pseudo history.  Many (not all) of the founding fathers were Deist at best, pagans at worst.  This video will shake the very foundation of the ""Christian Revolutionaries"" movement in a good way.  I myself have watched it 3 times in 1 week.  It is on par with the highest quality documentary films you'd expect to see on The History Channel.

4264264,3,B00461VOPO,"This film is a rather pedantic and overwrought counterargument to the idea that the leaders of the American revolution and founders of the government of the United States intended to create a nation based on Christian principles.  Anyone with a decent university education already knew this, but here filmmaker Christian Pinto presents a case made in evangelical-speak for those who refuse to believe anything from anyone who doesn't carry a bible or pepper his or her speech with the name of the saviour.

Pinto presents more than enough examples from the letters and diaries of Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Ben Franklin, George Washington and Thomas Paine to convince most any sane person that these men had very low regard for Christianity.  Unfortunately, Pinto veers off track and gets bogged down in boringly circumstantial detail on the influence of Freemasonry and Catholicism on early American government.  The overly dramatic score gives the impression that something important is being revealed, when really all it does is impress upon you how little to which it all amounts.  The dramatic recreations, if you care to call them that, amount to little more than a few old guys in period costume shuffling papers, looking at maps, or attempting to write longhand with a quill.  Look closely to see what a mess they make of it - big globs of ink whenever they start from a fresh dip from the inkpot.

At three hours, the film is a bit overlong but is nevertheless a great one to give or recommend to your friend who thinks America is a Christian nation.  It might seriously upset his view of the world.

4264265,3,B00461VOPO,"I don't know that much about Chris, but I will comment on this issue. First of all, anyone who suggests that the War for Independence violates Romans 13 is both a shallow theologian and historian. They obviously are not familiar with the traditions of Christian polity that are outlined The Vindicae Contratyrannos or in Lex Rex, which layed out the biblical case for overthrowing a monarch who violates his authority under God.

Secondly, Article 11 in The Treaty of Tripoli is hardly a substantial proof of the true nature of America's traditions. It was a treaty with a Muslim nation, and a treaty by nature contains diplomatic language. What do we then say about the language used in the Treaty of Paris ending the Revolution ""In the name of the Holy and undivided Trinity?""

David Barton, like any historian, slants history to some degree, but Barton never claims Paine, Franklin ot Jefferson were ever Christians. Other Founders like Adams and Madison, appeared more orthoxdox during their years of publc service, but moved away from that stance as they grew older. It is dishonest scholarship to take things said in, say, 1820 and apply it as though these were the views held in 1776 or when the Constitution was being framed and ratified. When one claims that certain men were ""the least religious of the founders,"" he cannot avoid making a comparative statement about the commitment of the others.

I conclude with a statement from atheist historian Perry Miller

"" Actually, European Deism was an exotic plant in America, which never struck roots in the soil. Rationalism was never so widespread as liberal historians, or those fascinated by Jefferson, have imagined.""

The founding fathers are still my heroes as well as anybody else that places intelligence,  reason and bravery above superstition of ANY kind. The time of the Enlightenment was one of the greatest times in Western history. It was the age of scientific discovery, freedom from political tyranny, and justice for the common man.  It is, however,  a shame, and somewhat dangerous, that some of us have regressed back to a state of biblical intoxication.  I DO thank Mr. Pinto for all the nice little anecdotes about Payne,  Washington, Adams, Jefferson, The Illuminati, the Masons (which in modern times include the likes of Gerald Ford, LBJ, both Roosevelts).

It is interesting that the World Union of Deists actually sells this DVD.  I would give it 5 stars if it did not project the ideas of Heaven, Hell and Sin onto their thoughts, which maybe reading too much.  This is a fairly minor problem though.

It is produced by Christians for other Christians.  I would say with that in mind, it is useful to anyone interested in the beliefs and history of the founders.",1295308800,7,658,4.981651376146789

4264270,5,B00461VOPO,"This documentary is a powerful THREE HOUR presentation that gives a step by step analysis of what the key founders of the American Revolution believed.  Most importantly, it is presented from a Christian perspective, comparing Biblical teachings with the beliefs of the founding fathers.  The film begins by showing a clear difference between the Pilgrims who landed in 1620 (who were Christians) and how 150 years passed until the time of the Revolutionaries, who held to radically different doctrines.  The production is said to be the fourth part of the ""Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings"" series.

There is an in-depth explanation (with detailed documentation) of the connection between the ideas of the Enlightenment thinkers in Europe (like Voltaire and Rousseau) and how they directly impacted the founding fathers.  Once you understand their general philosophies, and how they exalted the concept of ""Reason"" above the supernatural elements of the Bible, many of the quotes from the founders make more sense.

The film then takes you through the writings of Thomas Paine (who wrote ""Common Sense"" which inspired the Declaration of Independence), along with Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams and George Washington.  Shocking quotes are presented from several of the key founders (Paine, Jefferson and Adams) who made vicious comments about Christianity and the Bible.  Again, detailed documentation is given.  The film also shows that while men like Franklin and Washington did not insult the Christian faith, there is strong evidence to suggest that they did not believe in it.

The film then presents documentation that connects George Washington and Benjamin Franklin with Rome and the Jesuit Order during this era.  The information is fascinating, well documented, and presents a side to American history that you will not likely see anywhere else.  Most disturbing are two busts of the Roman Catholic popes who founded the Great Inquisition, which can be seen inside the U.S. Capitol.  These popes are presented among the great lawgivers of history.  Additional evidence is presented to show that the conflict of Rome against England through the Protestant Reformation era had much to do with America's conflict with England in the American Revolution.  Proof is presented that key parts of the U.S. Constitution were directly influenced by Rome.

The final hour of this film is dedicated to exposing David Barton, who has appeared in the last year with Glenn Beck, presenting the founders as God fearing men who were supposedly fighting for a Christian nation.  This evidence is powerful, showing how Barton manipulates history, and quotes Jefferson and Adams out of context, making it appear that they believed things which they actually refuted.  Those who have seen this segment seem to lose all confidence in Barton's view of American history.  There is also a step-by-step examination of Barton's book on ""Freemasonry and the Founding Fathers,"" showing its many flaws, and proving that the philosophies of Masonry are identical to those of the Revolutionaries.  While Barton argues that George Washington was a Christian, it is shown from his own letters that Washington worshiped the Masonic god, (the Great Architect of the Universe), which Barton admits is not the God of the Bible.

The production is partly presented in a History-channel type format, with dramatizations, visual graphics, and a professional musical score.  Other parts are in an off-the-cuff, guerilla filmmaking style, which seem designed to keep the work interesting.",1291420800,71,3580,5.366726296958855

When someone is honest enough to share a truth even though it does nothing to accommodate or support their personal belief system, I think it re-enforces their credibility.  Many of the low ratings come from people who claim this is liberal extremist propaganda.... which is sad because if all this evidence is out there in the personal writings of the founding fathers then it just makes conservatives look like ignoramuses.  If we disagree, then we can look up the full original copies of the writings of the founding father's for ourselves, right?  That will settle the controversy.

Some people have given this a bad review due to the length of it but I watched it twice because I found it to be so important to absorb and fully understand.  For us Christians, we are called to be pilgrims just passing through this life onto our real home and on our journey we are to stay separate from the world's ways and so I think this video really helped me to separate out in ways that could've really harmed my Christian walk.  That's because if Christians are clinging to America as if it is equal to Christianity somehow, then Christians are ignorantly angering God and they will be surprised on the day they face God when He says ""why did you embrace Babylon?""  So, for those who reviewed this and said ""Informative, but who really cares about all of this?""  They don't understand how spiritually dangerous it is to be linked up to Masonry in any way!  I spent time in prayer after watching this film and renounced all spiritual connections to anything America, (Statue of Liberty, Washington Monument, American Revolution etc.) and I felt so much freer afterwards and my relationship with God has felt so much more pure of a connection since then.  So I highly recommend this video for any Christian who feels bogged down in their Christian life and doesn't know why.  The reason is Masonry has disguised itself as Christianity and has even infiltrated Christian churches who all now celebrate all of the American holidays during church services such as 4th of July with flag ceremonies and/or war remembrance ceremonies etc. and it stifles the Spirit of God.  Being that we are in the last days, no one can afford to have one foot in Masonry (America) and one foot in Christianity and this video will illuminate how to get both feet on the right path by showing you what the real facts are behind the formation of our country.",1518134400,,1923,4.629411764705883
