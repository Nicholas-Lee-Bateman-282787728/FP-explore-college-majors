7837894,1,6303118097,"This is a completely failed attempt at creating a film about Bix Beiderbecke that even remotely touches on the real facts of his life - which are actually much more interesting than anything this film has to offer.
Some of the music is excellent but it is a recreation; nothing of the real Bix can be heard.
Finally, the actors do not look like the characters they are supposed to represent, least of all the guy playing Bix who does not resemble him whatsoever.
If you want to learn about the real Bix - then better not waste your money on this.",1255392000,,546,4.362745098039215
7837895,4,6303118097,"Considering the complexities of the Bix Beiderbecke story and the time allowed within the confines of a feature film, I think that this is a reasonable attempt to educate and entertain anyone with an interest in the music of the period. It contains factual errors and a fair amount of poetic license but is also full of great recreations of musical performancies and the flavour of the 20's really does come across.
The flashback style used to tell the story is, at times,  confusing but once accepted, does not spoil the enjoyment of a film that deserved a much wider release.
This is a must for Bix fans",1023148800,7,605,4.601851851851852
