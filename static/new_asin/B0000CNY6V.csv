1920339,5,B0000CNY6V,SHE IS SENSATIONAL! I'm glad she released this DVD. Every performance is really good. I can't wait until her next one.,1088380800,,118,4.666666666666667
1920340,4,B0000CNY6V,"This movie is definitely not well written or filmed, but I must admit, it's hilarious. The cheesy beach/spring break scene combined with spontaneous song and choreographed dance makes it worth your while. Justin Guarini is pathetic but again, it's funny to watch him try.",1082937600,,271,5.181818181818182
1920341,5,B0000CNY6V,This is a must have for any kelly clarkson fan! I love it has all of kelly's best performances.they never get old I watch them every day! I LOVE KELLY!,1081468800,,151,4.066666666666666
1920342,5,B0000CNY6V,"Kelly Clarkson first came into our hearts when she won American Idol(season 1). Getting through Simon Cowell's tough comments, she proved to us that she really was ""miss independent"". Today Kelly Clarkson is one of the most well known recording artists and nothing can hold her down. Working as a ""Red Bull"" promoter just 3 years ago, she was making $12.50 an hour, now she has a 1 million dollar empire. If the phrase Livin' it up were to be put into the dictionary, you would see a picture of Miss Independent right next to it. WE LOVE YOU KELLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1080432000,,561,4.62
1920343,5,B0000CNY6V,"This is absolutely the best ever for a Kelly Clarkson fan.  I was definitely waiting for something like this to come out, and thank god it did.  I've watched this over and over again, and I've had it for at over 3 months already.  I can't get enough of some of Kelly's performances.  I really enjoy her ""LOW"" performance as well as ""Miss Independent"" on the Late Show.  All I have to say is GET THIS!!!!!  You won't regret it.  How could anyone not enjoy Kelly's voice.  =)",1078012800,,473,4.295454545454546

1920345,5,B0000CNY6V,"I am very happy with my purchase of this ""Kelly Clarkson-Miss Independent DVD"".  This DVD captures the great moments of Kelly Clarkson's performance on television.  I have been reading some other comments, and I found them quite ridiculous and poorly thought out, like comments about Kelly Clarkson herself, etc.  I mean, aren't you here to review product items? Please.  And no matter how ""big"" or ""small"" an artist is, it doesn't affect they way a performer performs! Kelly Clarkson is such an outstanding performing and has a very good sense of herself, as well as her self esteem.  In each performance, it will show her vocally strong powerhouse range that will reflect why she has won American Idol.
This DVD contains:
TV Performance
Miss Independent:
1. Performed on TRL: This performance is the MTV Summer TRL performance. This performance is great.
4/5
2. The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn: This performance of Miss Independent is the best performance that I have seen.  She shows her range and the strength that puts her talent where real artists belong.
5/5
3. American Idol 2: Well, actually, IT'S missing? Where the heck is it? It's not on MY DVD AT ALL! But, having watch American Idol 2 and seeing this performance, she really did a great job with this one with her back up dancers.
4/5
Some Kind of Miracle; Summer Music Mania: This performance is from Summer Music Mania and Kelly does a great performance of this song. Solid performance.
5/5
Low: The performance took place at The Teen Choice Awards.  This has to be the best `Low' performances that Kelly has ever done on television.
5/5
Live Performances from the Fall 2002 tour of American Idols
Respect (Washington, D.C.): A good fun live performance of Respect.  She does some dancing in this one as well.
4/5
(You Make Me Feel Like A) Natural Woman in Atlanta: This is a good solid performance of this song, but nothing compared to the one that she did on American DVD.  This is with full lyrics, meaning she sang the whole song.
4/5
Before Your Love in (Washington, D.C.): This is a great different performance of Before Your Love.  This is a good song supported with great vocals to further emphasize the strength in the song.
5/5
The Videos:
A moment like this: Significant and meaningful music video.  She is basically singing on the stage that she had one on American Idol, which was the Kodak Theatre, and showing memorable clips from the series.
5/5
Before your love: A thrown surprise party thrown for Kelly by her friend and her ""boy friend"".
4/5
Miss Independent: Basically a party scene, in the end she meets someone.
3/5
Low: A music video of Kelly driving her ex's boyfriends car, in the end, it's gone.
4/5
More:
Behind the scenes: Low Video-very long and not much talking and interaction for the audience
Behind the Scenes: Low photo shoot-same ting as the video shoot, not much interaction with the viewers.

Overall, I recommend this DVD for Kelly Clarkson fans, as well as those who want to see a true artist.  The only thing that I would like to say is for most of the performances, they fade out too quickly at the end.  As for the Performances from the American Idol Tour, the fade screen doesn't even fade in right away.  The camera angle of Natural woman is horrible, until half way of the song. And finally, where did Miss Independent of American Idol 2 series disappear to?  But besides this, I would really recommend this DVD, much over her single DVD with Before Your Love/A Moment like this.  You would get much more for just a couple more dollars.  Once again, Kelly Clarkson proves why she is the winner of American Idol one and has the capabilities of lasting within the hectic music industry.",1070841600,,3711,4.702160493827161
1920346,5,B0000CNY6V,"This is such an amazing DVD.I liked it a lot. She performs really good. It shows how good Kelly Clarkson really is. She is a young , beautiful & has an amazing talent. I just have to say KELLY ROCKS !!!!!!!!!!!",1069545600,,210,4.146341463414634
1920347,5,B0000CNY6V,"I absolutely loved this DVD, but I wish there were more live performances like when she was on her mini tour.  Nevertheless, it is a great DVD to own because it's all about the true #1 American Idol herself, Kelly Clarkson.  You can't go wrong by buying this DVD, so buy it now!!!!",1069286400,,281,4.283018867924528
1920348,5,B0000CNY6V,"I actually enjoyed the DVD.  Especially the live performances, as haven't had a chance to see some of them, wouldn't mind if there were more however.  Hopefully we will be getting more live performances from this her in the future.....she's very talented.  Impressed by her versatility.  Overall I rate this highly....with future note..(add more live performances).",1069200000,,365,5.464285714285714
1920349,5,B0000CNY6V,"Kelly was great when she was recently in Sydney for her Australian promo tour, so I'm really hanging out for when this DVD gets released over here!
She has a beautiful, strong voice and I just know her talent is going to get her so far!!",1069113600,,237,4.173913043478261
1920350,5,B0000CNY6V,"This has sooo many features... Her voice is sooo great! There is something for everybody on this cd. It is well worth the money!!!She is a miraculous talent and is a wonderful role model...
GO KELLY!!! :)",1069113600,,204,4.54054054054054
1920351,1,B0000CNY6V,"The least I can say is she is singing a new song and not ripping off someone else's work. However this song just comes off as a Xina Aguilera toss away. The video is nothing new. Clarkson, looking a bit thick around the waist and face, delivers her ""singing."" I'm sure this will sell well since the majority of music buyers wouldn't know taste or originality if it bit them on the behind.",1069113600,,388,4.328767123287672
1920352,5,B0000CNY6V,"No matter how many American Idol competions come up in the future. There's nothing like the original. If it wouldn't have been for Kelly winning the first season of American Idol, then Clay and Ruben would be no where. Kelly was the one who showed the world that this compition is seriuos talent like she is. I think everyone should buy this Kelly ROCKS!!",1068422400,,355,4.5625
1920353,5,B0000CNY6V,"They should have promoted this better!!!!!!!! the only reason that I bought was because I found it on accident!!!!!!!!
SHAME ON THEM!!!!!!!!!!
i'm shure this DVD will be great!!!!!
after all it is KELLY CLARKSON we're talking about =)!!!!!!!",1067731200,,241,5.205128205128205

7999647,5,B0000CNY6V,"I was so satisfied to watch this DVD title and it contains precious moments for not only her but also her fans.
All of watching this would be so moved because you guys could ""just"" watch her so many moments from debut to performances after winning on American Idol.",1313798400,,265,4.428571428571429
7999648,5,B0000CNY6V,if your a fan of kellys this is a must have it has music videos making of music videos performances especially from the 2002 american idol tour and footage of a photo shoot five stars isn't enough,1239840000,,196,4.324324324324325
7999649,4,B0000CNY6V,"The performances of Kelly Clarkson are wonderful. Her music and voice deserve a 5-star rating, she should be more famous than Shakira, Madona,... However, I have given this DVD 4 stars because it is impossible to see all the performances continuously, that is, one has to select the performances one by one on the menu which is tedious.",1212019200,,336,4.810344827586207
7999650,1,B0000CNY6V,"I have purchased 2 of Kelly's DVD's and i was not impressed with either.
I am dumbfounded at the 5 star's given here, half the stuff listed on the box isn't even there. It's not Kelley's fault, but the fault of those who produced those shabby dvd's. I am rating this according to what I expected and what I got. I can't say that i will ever buy another unless I hear it first.",1196553600,,376,4.094594594594595
7999651,1,B0000CNY6V,"need some advice weather to buy this dvd or not, because i think my dvd player is a region 2.",1145059200,,93,3.7
7999652,4,B0000CNY6V,"They did a nice job on this first DVD for Kelly Clarkson.  I liked her performances on the various shows she was on, especially MTV, another show and the first American Idols tour.  It allowed her to do more with her vocals than what she did on American Idol.  The audiences actually like her, especially those who are seeing her for the first time.  Hope she does a live concert DVD soon focusing more on the Breakaway album, since that one rocks more!",1104278400,,453,4.421686746987952
7999653,5,B0000CNY6V,This DVD is awesome!  Every performance is awesome!  And it's awesome to have all the music videos in one DVD.  Kelly rocks!,1102896000,,124,4.545454545454546
