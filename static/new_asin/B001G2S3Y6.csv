But then she says that about most things...Very colorful and fun, typical Disney style bad acting and lame storyline. Fine for pre teens.",1232409600,2,269,4.4

Plus also its a great movie to watch with friends or with your girlfriend or which ever. if your going to watch this movie, watch the other titles by the cheetah girls part 1 and 2 there very talented and big plus very attractive.

3595573,4,B001G2S3Y6,"To a baby boomer like me, The Cheetah Girls are a variation on Josie and the Pussycats. But much as I loved the Josie comics and the Hanna-Barbera cartoon, the creators of the movie version failed big time where Disney succeeded -- very likely because the Josie movie took the ""edgy"" route and turned its back on both its family audience and the fans of the franchise.

The Cheetahs, on the other hand, have been highly consistent initiative for Disney Channel and Walt Disney Records. While not the ""lightning in a bottles"" that Hannah Montana and High School Musical have been, instead this peppy pop threesome have been perhaps the longest running enterprise in the Disney catalog of tween attractions, with three TV movies, five albums and three tours. Actually the concept began as a book series in 1999.

In the lollipop-colorama that is The Cheetah Girls: One World, the group has just the sort of glamorous international moviemaking experience that little girls make up on the living room floor with their Barbies. The movie definitely hits that target, as well as introduce many Americans to the idea of Bollywood and a little bit of Indian culture (though if Big Bird visited India in one of those specials we might have learned a little more).

Hmm... the plot. Chanel, Dorinda and Aqua meet hunky guys but don't get too serious, get a chance to be Bollywood stars but choose friendship and loyalty instead and sing a crispy, crunchy package of catchy songs -- on camera rather than ""in their heads"" which is creditable since few modern musicals allow their audiences to stretch their imaginations like old time ones did.

The movie also causes some speculation that it is just a part of an overall Disney/Bollywood corporate incentive to bridge the two industries for a fiscal win-win. It may or may not be a coincidence that the first Disney animated film created for India, Roadside Romeo, came out around the same time this film premiered.

It's interesting to note how the filmmakers managed to give this movie a somewhat opulent look with a limited budget, by filling the screen with color at every opportunity and filming a lot of outdoor scenes with heavily dressed settings (as in the marketplace sequence which looks much more ""art directed,"" with each color perfectly complimenting the other, that the eclectic real thing possibly could). It's a nice-looking production.

The DVD features a new song sequence and bloopers, but what most impressed me was ability to watch the entire film with ""Cheetah Spots"" in which the performers comment on camera every few minutes and the film image become an inset. It's a nice alternative to an audio commentary and is perhaps easier for the intended audience to enjoy. You can also tell who is talking because you see them. These ""spots"" additionally reveal which choices Disney Channel viewers voted on to take place in the film: what props might show up, etc, which is a clever way to involve the fans.

Still, I can't help thinking how Josie and the gang might have fared in a similar production. We'd probably be watching movies with them today, instead of seeing the movie DVD in the bargain bin.",1229385600,2,3163,4.8462962962962965
3595574,1,B001G2S3Y6,"Why must Disney kill The Cheetah Girls?

These movies used to be so fun, and have great music in them....and RAVEN!

The acting in this movie really sucked!...A LOT!!! I did watch the movie though, and wasn't impressed at all!

I did like the songs, ""Cheetah Love,"" and ""Dance Me If You Can."" Also, the ending was probably the best part of the movie...but, that's not a good enough reason to give this movie a 4-STAR rating.

It is really a 1-STAR, it's just not good. And so worthless watching. Go watch ""The Cheetah Girls,"" and ""The Cheetah Girls 2,"" some of the best movies ever released from the Disney Channel Original Movies!",1228262400,5,631,4.557522123893805
3595575,1,B001G2S3Y6,"Watching the preview of ""The Cheetah Girls: One World,"" makes it look like a really good movie, despite Raven-Symone not being apart of the movie.

This movie was the most boring, blandest, ""Cheetah Girls"" movie out of the whole series. ""The Cheetah Girls 2"" was probably the best from the scenery, acting, and the great music like, The Party's Just Begun, Strut, and more!

The music in this movie made a little impression on me. Dance Me If You Can, is the ultimate dance/fun track from The Cheetah Girls. I like the ""Dance"" dance scene in ""The Cheetah Girls: One World.""

Songs like No Place Like Us, Dig a Little Deeper, Fly Away, and that title track, One World, kill this soundtrack! So does other individual songs from The Cheetah Girls themselves. Raven-Symone sung on two solo songs on the second Cheetah Girls, Everyone's a Star was terrible, while, It's Gonna Be Alright, was a really great track!

Overall, little kids will love it. Because, well...it's The Cheetah Girls. Hannah Montana is way better than this stuff, so is ""High School Musical.""

As for parents, or older people above 13, you'll find this movie very boring, and annoying. From the movie, music, and the really bad acting in this movie.",1228262400,3,1216,4.771428571428571

She liked that it was set in India and it prompted her to ask numerous questions about Indian culture, etc. Personally, I thought it was pretty cheesy with sub par acting and a bit too much emphasis on boys and dating. Id purchased this movie thinking it was focused primarily on singing and dancing (which my daughter loves), but the plot was a bit all over the place and the singing and dancing seemed to be a backdrop to the theme of friendship and romance.",1421020800,,500,4.445652173913044

In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!
