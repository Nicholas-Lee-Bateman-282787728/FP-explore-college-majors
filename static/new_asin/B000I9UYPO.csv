Me and my family love this film, its one of the best! I am 24 years old and I could feel like I was one of the boys when I was younger. BUY IT TODAY! Best regards, Robert in Sweden",1160870400,,348,3.8472222222222223
2654112,5,B000I9UYPO,"At this time of movies with huge budgets & special effects comes along a movie made for the whole family. My kids saw it & when their friends come over, they sit & watch it over & over again. As a parent, you don't have to worry. With the movie being set in the early 80's, the movie does a good job of capturing 1980 & it brings me back to the days when I was a rebel as a kid.",1159488000,4,378,3.6790123456790123
2654113,5,B000I9UYPO,"As the mother of three small boys, I am thrilled to find a movie as refreshing as Rounding First.  It is everything you want in a movie without the violence, nasty words or animation that can be so tiresome.  My boys (ages 7, 5 and 4) loved the movie and have been quoting scenes from it since the first time we watched.  We watch it every few days and really, really love it!",1159488000,3,376,4.123287671232877
2654114,5,B000I9UYPO,"This movie was really great because it really shows how children grow up and the different things they go threw as preteens. This movie reminded me of ""Stand by me"" because the way the children acted with each other and some of the lines and plots were very similar. So if you really like ""Stand by me"" then you will really love ""Rounding first"". Rounding First will be added to my favorate movies of all time. Also if you liked ""Josh and S.A.M you will like this movie also. Great for all ages.",1159056000,,495,4.333333333333333
2654115,3,B000I9UYPO,"""Rounding First"" is a unique, original character study which features some beautifully rendered performances by a uniformly impressive cast. A casting director who really knew what they were doing put together an extraordinarily accomplished ensemble featuring a mix of impressive newcomers and veteran players. John Michael Bolger, a fine actor perhaps best known for his strong supporting work on the NBC series ""Third Watch"", is particularly impressive; fans of daytime drama will also enjoy an unconventional turn by Emmy winner Michael E. Knight, long-running Tad of ABC's ""All My Children"". some astonishingly accomplished art direction for a film of such modest budget. The use of locations is remarkable, and a genuine period flavor suffuses the entire film. ""Rounding First"" is a fresh, compelling viewing experience.",1158192000,4,826,5.616
2654116,5,B000I9UYPO,"At a time when our world is upside down and our children have absolutely no sense of true friendship, loyalty, committment, and redemptiveness, Hollywood just keeps spitting out the same trash. But writer/director Jim Fleigner's film Rounding First takes all those worthy charateristics listed above and offers us an opportunity to remember what they really mean and how desperately we need to teach our children about them. Rounding First is a film Frank Capra would be proud of. It allows adults to remember, their children to peek into the past, and compels all of us to call all our dearest friends and tell them we love them. Each one of us is represented in the three main characters. And all of us will recall how the hard lessons of life shaped our character the most. It's refreshing to be able to sit down with the whole entire family and watch a movie again. This will remain a valuable part of my movie collection. Thank you Mr. Fleigner, thank you very, very much.",1158019200,4,977,4.686046511627907
2654117,5,B000I9UYPO,"This wonderful family film is a combination coming-of-age and buddy / road trip story of three 12-year-old boys who run away from baseball camp to find some elusive truths.  When they finally learn what they've been seeking, it's almost too much for two of the friends to bear.

In the spirit of ""Stand By Me,"" Rounding First is a coming-of-age dramedy set in the summer of 1980.  Twelve-year olds Joe, Tiger and Chris break out of baseball camp to secretly trail Joe's parents, who have lied to him about a mysterious trip they're taking.  The boys must piece together clues, avoid their parents, dodge the police, trust a stranger - and not destroy their friendships in the process - during an adventurous road trip in their last summer before junior high.

The three boys are wonderfully portrayed by Soren Fulton (Joe), Sam Semenza (Chris) and Matt Borish (Tiger).  Filmed on location in and around Allentown, Pennsylvania, the boys are very convincing in their roles.  The soundtrack is brilliant and adds to the film's pace and feeling.  Highly recommended.",1157673600,3,1063,4.932584269662922
8144569,1,B000I9UYPO,This movie gets one star because my brother and I were both extras in it and never got paid for our boring and tedious day of work. I should actually give this movie another star because it did teach me the value of holding a grudge.,1516406400,,233,4.086956521739131
8144570,4,B000I9UYPO,"I am the biggest baseball fan on the planet. Baseball movies make up a whole section of my DVD collection, and based on the title and DVD cover of this film, I was led to believe that this was another baseball movie, it's not. What this movie is, is a terrific story, about three boys who break out of sleep away camp, to find out why their parents have been acting so strangely. These boys cross the state to get to the truth and what they find is really unexpected and made for one hell of a story. I really didn't figure out what was going on until the very end and once I did the rating for this film went way up, as it makes the story pure genius! You also wouldn't expect the acting in a movie centered around three kids to be as good as it was, but these boys were terrific. Soren Fulton plays Joe, the twelve year old leader of the group. Even at the rip old age of twenty-one, this kid has been in everything and had a ton of experience coming into this thing, so his strong performance wasn't so unexpected. What did surprise me was just how good Matthew Borish was. Aside from the TV show, Hack, Borish hasn't been in anything before this film, but he really made it exciting, playing the role of Tiger. Tiger is the small kid who always has to act tough and be crazy, not only to get respect, but to cover up how troubled his life is. Borish gives a performance that is both funny and heartbreaking, he did a truly incredible job. Rounding First will make you laugh, boost your curiosity, and give you something to watch that is out of the ordinary. I was disappointed once I figured out that this wasn't a baseball movie, but what I saw may have been even better.",1361491200,,1676,4.224299065420561
8144571,5,B000I9UYPO,"I FOUND IT TO BE AN EXCELLENT MOVIE. IT HAS SOME ""STAND BY ME"" ELEMENTS TO IT. I ENJOYED THE MOVIE. I ACQUIRED THE MOVIE AND GOT THE DIRECTOR OF THE MOVIE TO AUTOGRAPH IT FOR ME. THAT WAS TOTALLY AWESOME.",1315267200,,204,4.0
8144572,4,B000I9UYPO,If you like stand by me you will enjoy this film a lot. I was impressed with this film. Wish they would make more movies like this.,1290038400,,131,3.888888888888889
8144573,5,B000I9UYPO,"What can I say that hasn't already been said.  Soren Fulton was incredible.  Matt Borish was incredible.  And the ending scene, let's just say that it was as emotional as it gets.

Loved the ""Behind the Scenes"" extras.  That was too funny when Soren mentioned that he was wearing women's shorts the whole time the movie was being filmed.

And that hideous blue and red shirt he was wearing?  Way too funny.  This movie had 1980 pegged down to a T.",1236643200,,447,4.432098765432099
8144574,5,B000I9UYPO,"This is a very good film! The performances by the young stars - Soren Fulton and Matthew Borish in particular - are the kind you'd expect to see from seasoned actors much older. The final scenes are riveting and real. You believe in the strength of their friendship, and that the bond they share will withstand anything. Bravo to everyone involved in this film! It's a real winner.",1235606400,,381,4.617647058823529
8144575,4,B000I9UYPO,"From time to time, apparently small-scaled films come along that manage to leave a lasting impression that simply was not expected. It is a refreshing fact that some of the best and most rewarding films out there are not coming from Hollywood but from independent sources. Often, the huge efforts that were put into the writing and making of these films find their way to the final viewing experience, and with Rounding First this is most definitely not an exception.

Jim Fleigner is the man who both wrote and directed this wonderful film that everyone who somehow loves cinema will probably enjoy. Some might just find the film sweet and entertaining, while some will find some deeper layers and aspects that carry this coming-of-age film towards the same level that Rob Reiner's comparable Stand By Me brought to its audience. And regarding the emotional and dramatic aspect, Rounding First has little trouble reaching Reiner's film, probably causing many tears to roll down the face as a result. While everyone will obviously develop their own thoughts on Rounding First, it is impossible to dismiss the amount of love and work that went into bringing this picture to the screen - be it in theatres, or at home.

Rounding First is basically sharing the coming-of-age story of three 12-year old friends who are having a dramatic - but also fun - adventure, trying to find out the truth behind a situation that has left one of the boys in great emotional pain. Taking place in 1980, the boys head out to find out what is really happening - traveling many miles and becoming involved in some powerful and engaging situations. While the film's story undeniably is an emotionally powerful (and ultimately even devastating) one, there are also many other aspects that will make the experience highly suitable and recommended for just about everyone. There are laughs, but there will also be tears. Carefully crafted and balanced, Rounding First draws its viewers into a childhood journey that feels exciting, personal, and also very dramatic.

Coming-of-age films would appear flat if their young actors would not be able to display honest and moving performances. Rounding First amazed me with its talented and stunningly performing child actors. Soren Fulton is bringing his emotionally scarred character to life with incredible prowess - making it impossible to remain unaffected by his role in the story. Matthew Borish is also very powerful as Soren's character's best friend - showing both anger and incredibly affecting moments. Sam Semenza brings great joy and genuinely funny moments to the film, which are required things with some very dramatic events finding their way to the viewer.

Backing up the film experience is a highly enjoyable and moving score by Czechoslovakian composer Ludek Drizhal, offering wonderful support for the many powerful moments in the film. Sweet and calm piano, harp, strings - brought to life by the Slovack Radio Symphony Orchestra, which was clearly in the right mood to do the job well.

Ultimately, Rounding First is a wonderful and required experience for everyone to enjoy. It is a moving, well-written and ditto crafted coming-of-age film, performed by truly gifted child actors and supporting cast, granted by a sweet and memorable score. It is impossible for me to not recommend this heartfelt film.",1185148800,,3348,5.08
8144576,5,B000I9UYPO,"""Rounding First"" is not your usual kid's film.  Without giving away the plot it deals with complex family issues.  3 preteens set out on a quest to find out why the parents are lying to them about something.  The journey is a strange and eventful trip.  Two of the young actors, Soren Fulton and Matt Borish give great preformances.  I give this film a high rating as suggest it for both kids and parents.

Sincerely

Geoffrey A McGeoch",1167350400,,436,4.512820512820513
8144577,5,B000I9UYPO,"Rounding First was a pleasure to watch, both for me (an old man of 36) and my 9 year old daughter. It had something for everyone in the family - humor, action and suspense. Weeks later, my daughter is still going around citing lines from the movie. It was a great bonding experience for us.

The film fully succeeds in capturing the spirit of being a kid in America in 1980. I grew up in Western Pennsylvania, on the other side of the state from Allentown where much of the film is set. And I was about 10 when the main characters were 12. So I know what I'm talking about.

But more than just nailing the era, the film tells a timeless story about friendship, loyalty and courage. Every parent should watch it with his or her children.",1165795200,,736,4.287769784172662
8144578,5,B000I9UYPO,"There is something very special about Rounding First , writer-director Jim Fleigner's labour of love . Rounding First is a beautifully written story about the value of friendship , and is unflinching when it puts that friendship to the ultimate test .  It is a film that challenges young and adult viewers on some tough questions in life, like ""when is it ok for parents to lie to children?"" and ""when is it ok for children to disobey parents?""  . Anyone who watches this film will be deeply moved by the themes and questions it poses , and it will be impossible to walk away by film's end without having those questions linger in one's mind .

Filmed with a modest budget, with no special effects ... just a solid story and some incredible acting by its emsemble of veteran and young actors, Rounding First is a return to old school filmmaking , and it is a film with great heart . The 3 young leads, Soren Fulton , Matt Borish and Sam Semenza , are amazing , and they are pivotal to the film's impact . They made their characters thoroughly believable , appealing yet edgy , and when asked to step up to the plate in a truly intense and dramatic scene towards the film's culmination, Soren Fulton and Matt Borish  were superb .

The kids are more than ably supported by the veteran cast of John Michael Bolger , best known for his work as Lt. Johnson on the critically acclaimed NBC series THIRD WATCH, three-time Emmy Award winner Michael E. Knight from the soap opera ALL MY CHILDREN, and actress Deborah Lee Johnson , known for her work on both TV and in the movies. Their presence leant resonance to the film.

If you want to see a film that is intelligent , life-affirming , and with tremendous heart , you must see Rounding First . This film deserves a wider audience , and I love it not only because it is a wonderful little film that dared to tell an important story , but the passion that was poured into the making of this film is evident in every single frame . The DVD is worth getting, not only for the film , but for the special features as well, which include a detailed commentary by writer/director Jim Fleigner , interviews with young actors Soren Fulton and Matt Borish , an extensive digital gallery , as well as some interesting deleted scenes .

This is one film and DVD that I would recommend without reservation.",1163289600,,2338,4.423255813953489
