8501634,5,B006O8K4XU,"I was completely floored by Solas upon my first viewing of the DVD in this DVD-CD package.  And I continue to marvel at the artistry, genius, energy, honesty and conviction of this great band. This reunion show gives the viewer a nice overview of the history of the band and its members over the years.  I really can't express how much I love the music of Solas and if you watch this DVD, I think you'll see why.",1423526400,,412,4.269230769230769

8501636,5,B006O8K4XU,"Solas, the Celtic band based in Philadelphia, has been a favorite of mine for years, though I admit that - even though I live in their hometown - I've never seen them perform live. Either I'm out of town when they play or they are out playing around the country (or the world).

Though originally founded in 1995, the press release and DVD title refer to  a ""decade of Solas"". Ten, or even 15 years, not a long time in many band's lives - but Solas has  had changes in personnel over the years. For the Reunion Concert in Philly - captured in its entirety on this DVD - leader Seamus Egan brought back three founding members.

The concert itself runs nearly two hours and has some interview clips inserted between the 16 songs performed. None more songs are included in the 30 minutes of bonus material. The images and sound are first rate.

Any fan of the band will want this DVD and it might draw in some new fans as well.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

The band's music is already incredible, and this DVD has let me enjoy the original band members from years ago all over again. Their music is energetic and full of emotion... the video element just lets you see more of their greatness. For the fan of Irish/Celtic music, this DVD is a must-have.",1334102400,,367,4.492537313432836
