2865769,5,B000RFQEFS,"Like the previous reviewer Debbie said, this workout seems to fall in intensity between Art of Strength's other workouts, Providence (easiest) and Newport (hardest). Although it is marketed as being for fire fighters and first responders, you definitely don't need to fall into those categories to do this workout!

In addition to what the previous reviewer said, I also want to add that you can pick the length of your rests and how many times you do the workout.  Setting the DVD for a Two Alarm workout, for instance, will allow you to go through the workout once through, with short rests, for a total of 25 minutes; a Three Alarm workout is twice through, with long rests, for a total of 55 minutes; a Four Alarm workout is twice through, with short rests, for a total of 45 minutes, and a General Alarm workout is once through, with no rests, for a total of 20 minutes.

Just be warned that you will need a matching pair of kettlebells for many of the exercises.

This is a good, tough workout that I really enjoy, but it doesn't have quite the fun factor for me that Newport does.  Overall, though, it's an excellent kettlebell workout!",1227052800,13,1143,4.583333333333333
2865770,5,B000RFQEFS,"This workout is from a female's perspective:

Anthony's Art of Strength workouts are by far the best kettlebell workouts on the market to date. The production, music, and format of his workouts are all excellent. The music options, practice chapter, and out takes, add to the quality of these DVDs.

I have all three of Anthony's workouts, and all of them have blown me away. I'll break them down from the easiest to the hardest.

Easiest-AOS Providence. For me personally, this is the near perfect workout. I'm so glad that I did this workout first, because I fell in love with Anthony's training style.

AOS Firepower-I find this workout to be between Providence and Newport. This workout does require two kettlebells during some of the exercises, so if you don't have pairs, this might not be doable for you.

AOS Newport-The first time I did this workout I was shocked at how hard this workout is. I work out at home, and I have a VAST collection of workouts. This is by far the most difficult workout in my collection. I'm just happy that this wasn't my first workout by Anthony. If it had been, I never would have done another workout, which would have been a shame, because I'm telling all of you, the AOS workouts are the best.

Breakdown of Firepower:
All of Anthony's workouts are done in circuits.  What makes this workout much different from the other two is that Anthony adds an exercise to each circuit.
warm up-Fantastic warm up
circuit 1-one exercise
circuit 2-2 exercises
circuit 3-3 exercises
circuit 4-4 exercises
circuit 5-5 exercises
bonus circuit

5 minute snatch test

The only negative that I could find with this DVD is that you can not skip chapters.  For some reason this DVD will not let you do this.

Kettlebell DVDs are extremely expensive, and I have a few that are not worth their price tag. The AOS DVDs are worth every single penny!",1187049600,24,1866,4.658536585365853
8200390,5,B000RFQEFS,"Anthony Diluglio once again puts together a very thorough warm up and workout. He explains every exercise clearly, even during the toughest movements. On this DVD, you can workout from about 20 minutes to an hour or more, depending on your fitness level. Note that you must have at least an intermediate understanding of proper form.",1489708800,,333,4.964285714285714

8200392,5,B000RFQEFS,I own all three Art of Strength DVD's but this one is my favorite. The Art of Strength Newport DVD is a harder workout and it takes around 45 minutes to complete. The Art of Strength Providence is an easier workout but runs for around 1 hour. This workout has multiple options depending on how long or short you want the breaks in between rounds to last. There is an option for no breaks which shortens the workout to 20 minutes as well as an option to run through the workout twice in case once through isn't enough for you. The workout does require two kettle bells. The time for each set is left on screen and the instructor completes the entire workout. There is a decent warm up routine before the workout but no cool down routine. I like that I can get a full body workout in 20 minutes with this routine and still feel as though I was able to put in a decent amount of work. I rotate this workout with the Newport workout just to vary things a bit. This workout has 5 rounds while the Newport routine has 8 rounds. The instructor is not annoying or overbearing and the background music isn't bad. I'd definitely recommend this DVD.,1482624000,3,1138,4.322429906542056

8200394,5,B000RFQEFS,I love this workout! I can tailor it to how much time on any given morning.  Either way I feel worked. Anthony is a master with kettlebell workouts.  You can't go wrong with any of them.,1428883200,3,186,4.138888888888889

8200396,5,B000RFQEFS,"I have waited for over nine months to write this review because I wanted to ensure that I was able to provide feedback that was not based on the excitement of starting a new workout routine. I was first introduced to Anthony Diluglio's Firepower DVD by a coworker. I watched the DVD and wrote down the workout routine and started doing it once a week at my local gym. I worked for six months eventually building up to working the Firepower routine two to three times per week. I then branched out and purchased his Providence DVD. This shocked my system because it moved from working each exercise for one minute each, as in Firepower, to two minutes per exercise. However, I was able to get through it nonstop the first go around even though it was challenging; I attribute getting through Providence on day one to having taken six months to build a solid base with Firepower. After working Providence for three months I again branched out and purchased Newport. Newport is awesome! Talk about a shock to the system. Each workout set is four to five minutes including a one minute set of abs; thankfully I had that strong base built through Firepower. Getting through Newport is still a struggle and requires a little more mental toughness than Firepower and Providence. I do have to use a lighter KB for some of the Newport exercise but I know eventually I'll build to where I'm using the same weight KB for all of Newport.

The above method is what worked for me and I provide it to hopefully encourage others interested in pursuing KB workouts a good starting point. I cannot emphasize enough though the importance of starting out slowly, working at your own pace, and building a solid base focusing primarily on developing your core strength. Of note is that I also lost 35 pounds during that first six months (245 to 210; I'm 6 ft. 4 in. for height/weight reference purposes); I'm still dropping weight too. This is in part due to three major lifestyle changes: (1) I quit drinking alcohol; (2) I reduced my sugar intake, to include natural sugars, to less than 20 grams per day (if you think this is hard the book `The Belly Fat Cure: Discover the New Carb Swap System and Lose 4 to 9 lbs. Every Week' by Jorge Cruise can help); (3) I started working out five days per week (Mon - cardio, Tue - strength training, Wed - cardio, Thur - cross training, Fri - cardio).

As far as Anthony Diluglio is concerned, I could not ask for a better virtual personal trainer. He does go through some tutorials for some of his exercises which I do recommend watching as it will help with form and prevent injury; all-in-all though he expects that you will come with some sort of knowledge of KB strength training on how to do exercises properly. Even if you are just starting out, as long as you take it slow and at your own pace, you can easily follow along with him during each routine and the changing camera angles really help capture the nuances of each exercise. Again, start out slow and build that solid base focusing on keeping your core tight during each exercise!

Currently, my workout rhythm for strength training in general is on a monthly cycle with one hard strength training workout each week. Week one is the Providence followed up with a run through Firepower. Week two is the Newport routine again followed up with a run through Firepower. Week three is the Firepower routine walking up the five set pyramid and then working down through the same pyramid taking my rest at the pyramid's top. Week four is a rest from KBs and I do the CrossFit Filthy Fifty (or Dirty Thirty if I'm not feeling up to par; Dirty Thirty is the same thing as Filthy Fifty but just 30 sets of each exercise). Recall that I spent over six months building a solid base, focusing on core strength, before being able to get to this point of regular, injury free strength training. Take it slow folks and build that core!

I hope that Anthony Diluglio keeps making workout DVDs. I will buy them every time over any other workout DVD out there. They might be a little pricey but it is worth every penny if you are willing to invest your time in improving your physical fitness and your body in general.",1368489600,2,4186,4.525759577278732
8200397,5,B000RFQEFS,"I have three of the Art of Strength DVDs: Providence, Newport, and Firepower.  I was nervous at first that they would all be too similar, but that is not the case, which I am very happy with.  While a few exercises do overlap, for the most part each DVD has its own unique drills.  For reference, I have been using Kettlebells on and off since 2004, and currently I can comfortably do a few sets of 5 overhead presses with a 53lb kettlebell.

Providence:  Using a lighter kettlebell, this is a good one to start with.  However, the exercises are simple enough that you can use a heavier weight and really crank up the intensity.  I think the warmup round could include a few more leg moves since you then go right into doing a ton of swings.  If you sit all day long like I do, you may want to do your own warmup for a few minutes prior to starting.  This DVD is a little more monotonous than the others since you will sometimes do one exercise for up to 2 minutes straight, which I have come to dread (but its good at the same time).  The others usually break it up a little more.  I work in 53s, 44s, and 35s depending on the round, and it can make this either the easiest or hardest DVD depending on how much weight you choose to go with.

Newport: This uses longer rounds that mostly consist of two exercises and then finish with an ab exercise.  The kettlebell exercises tend to be more complicated and require more balance, so it is hard to go heavy.  And, since the rounds are longer, I would say this is more conditioning focused than strength focused.  I find I sweat a lot more doing Newport, but my muscles are usually not as tired.  This has a faster, lighter feel to it overall.  For me the core exercises at the end of the round are the most challenging aspect.  Of all the DVDs, I would say definitely warmup on your own before hand, the first round is a bit much to go into cold.  I use a 35lb kettlebell for most exercises, but may start adding a 44 in certain rounds.

Firepower: This is the most strength focused of the three, but, like all three DVDs still gets your heart rate cranking.  Two features I really like are the nice long warmup and the ability to choose how long/intense a workout you want to do, since having the energy and time to set aside and hour to workout isn't always an option. The downside of that is it allows you to get lazy!  There are fewer exercises that put you in awkward positions in this DVD as well, so if you are returning from a bad back, shoulder, etc., it may be a better starting point. Unlike one of the other reviewers here, I actually think the production quality is the same or better on this DVD as the others.  One strange glitch is that you cannot skip ahead or back once you have started.  I am currently using 35, and may start adding 44s soon.

Having all three is a great way to add variety and keep the intensity up without getting bored or overtrained.  I highly recommend any and all of these!",1328572800,6,2965,4.25
8200398,3,B000RFQEFS,"This is a tough workout (I'm not a firefighter).  It is a great whole body strength routine.  I personal think it is better for real wold strength that can be used in daily life.  It's only one routine.  The variations are to repeat it more.

For $50+ for one DVD, I expected a better production quality. I work in the video production field, so I am probably the exception here.  I doubt most people would be bothered by these same things.  To me, it's like a film student project (and I've been to film school.) I can tell they put effort into it, with a jib, two cameras, etc but one of the cameras is clearly much lesser quality and does not match.  The lighting is also way to harsh!  There are no close-ups that would have helped engage the viewer to relate to the host.  The editing is jarring at the starts and stops of several segments/exercises.  The dvd menu is lacking some features.  I really wish that when I watched a single drill or instruction, that when it automatically returned to the menu listing all exercises it would remember which one I just watched instead of always going back to the beginning.

 I have no idea what limitations the producers of this video faced, but I'm bothered by how expensive this DVD is considering it just one and how poor the quality is. I've bought quite a few other workout DVD's and all had better production quality and were cheaper.",1325635200,5,1389,4.4603174603174605
8200399,5,B000RFQEFS,"I love working out with my kettle bells and this video is my favorite addition to my workout. Video has different but very good stretches to start out with, good workouts broke down by time & difficulty, with easy to understand instructions. Good 5 min cool down and a must for anyone who enjoys kettle bells. I am a female so I use my 10 lb kettle bells, I recommend gloves so they don't slip out of your hands when you work up a sweat. This video is easily adaptable to time, skill level, motivation and what your goals are with weights. Shipped fast with no issues and I have been loving it ever since!",1276128000,5,605,4.269565217391304
