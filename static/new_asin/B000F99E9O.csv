8119198,3,B000F99E9O,"We have 2 Indians in New York (Akshaye Khanna & Aishwarya Rai) abandoned by the people they thought would support them there.
It is about people following dreams of  riches in the US and abandoning the values of their home culture. It is a reminder that the US experience isn't all rosie and that Indian family values are important measured up against riches.
Some of the Indians and Pakistanis who assist them there are played well and endearingly and add solid weight to the movie. The romance between the leads is also fine, and Akshaye and Ash do fine in their parts.
The music wasn't memorable but there were a few OK songs when they were on. Dance wasn't really that much of a feature either. The plot had its interesting moments but more towards the end when there was an unexpected plot twist, and some coincidences and fairytale endings. It has nice humane values and its heart was in the right place.
It was fine if you like romances but didn't stand out as anything very extraordinary. I think I will most remember the support cast and the great connections between the Indians/Pakistanis who assist- and I appreciated the plot twist near the end. Not a bad way to spend time though.",1233014400,,1194,4.605633802816901
8119199,3,B000F99E9O,"Overeducated, overqualified and unable to land a job in India, Rohan moves to New York to pursue his personal American dream. But stranded in New York, refused a welcome by his childhood neighbor and friend, he is befriended and taken in by a pair of working Indian cabbies named Hindustan and Pakistan. Rohan himself becomes a cab driver and later, in one of his fares, picks up newly arrived Pooja (Aishwarya Rai), who is coming to live with her brother. However, Pooja learns that her brother aims to marry her off to his boss to further himself in the work place. Pooja runs away and is picked up again by Rohan, who then provides her shelter. Trodding down that old romantic trail, Pooja falls in love with Rohan. But Rohan, blinded by ambition, only has eyes for the gorgeous Loveleen (Suman Ranganathan), a rich Non-Resident Indian girl. Pooja attempts to catch Rohan's eye in several scenes, abetted by Hindustan and Pakistan, but to no avail. She departs after being coldly rebuffed by Rohan and is hired as a personal aide to Balraj Khanna, who thinks her perfect for his jerk of a son, Karan. Meanwhile, Rohan grows disaffected with Loveleen and at last realizes his feelings for Pooja. But is it too late?

As per most Bollywood films, Aa Ab Laut Chalen (Let's Go Back) is replete with  twisting subplots. The plot complications in the movie's first half alone would've been enough for one Hollywood movie. But because a normal Bollywood flick runs up to almost 3 hours, just when you think you've gotten used to the characters and their personal arcs, the plot switches up and goes off on a different tangent. But you'll get no more spoilers from me. Just sit back and marvel as the melodrama and coincidences unfold.

This is an okay three star movie, featuring the first teaming of Aish and Akshaye Khanna. Aish is pretty good; I mean, how can you not fall in love with her character? No one delivers a look of longing more wistfully than Aish. Akshaye Khanna as Rohan does a nice balancing act, material minded yet a nice guy at heart. His role reminds me of many of the parts Tom Cruise played earlier in his career: self-centered go-getters, who refuse to see a good thing standing right in front of them but who later find a change of heart and thus, redemption. It's frustrating for the viewer because the guy just doesn't seem to get it. But good job, Akshaye. Suman is not given much to do other than play the ""other"" girl; but we all know she really doesn't stand a chance versus Aish.  The actors who play Hindustan and Pakistan are properly caring and corny and at times disgruntled. Rajesh Khanna is just okay as Mr. Balraj. My favorite is Paresh Rawal, who portrays the gruff but kindly Jack Patel, a New York policeman and pundit.  By the way, if you enjoy the romantic pairing of Aish and Akshaye Khanna, check out their later movie Taal.

I liked two of the songs. Yehi Hai Pyar (This Sure is Love) features Aish and Suman in lovely Indian costume, both dancing and vying for Rohan's attention. Mera Dil Tera Deewana (My Heart is Crazy For Yours) is a fun number filmed on the Jersey boardwalk, with Aish being a cute pest whilst Rohan and Suman are trying to enjoy their date. It's a breezy tune featuring Aish and Suman in bathing outfits. Rrrrrrr.

The movie's message is pretty blatant but nevertheless true: that, in the end, nothing matters more than the universal values of friendship and family.",1149984000,3,3433,4.627257799671593
