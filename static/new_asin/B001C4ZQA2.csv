3506041,5,B001C4ZQA2,"The second half of Season 2 of the 2003 Turtle series, and thus far none of the episodes have been lacking in anything, although there's been some filler episodes but what animated action show isn't expected to have at least a couple every now and then.  Season 2, I feel went about taking what Season 1 established and go about taking it a step further.  I have to say that they sure outdid themselves with this season doing things I never thought that they would go about doing for a TMNT show, with having episodes of City at War.  Even going back to something that was brought up in the first season, by helping out some friends they needed to help out from that season.  To top it off the turtles get to take part in something they never competed in before in their lives, but the question is who's going to win that?  Overall it's definitely worth 5 stars out of 5.",1279756800,,871,4.319018404907975
3506042,5,B001C4ZQA2,The DVD works perfectly. No marks or scratches were on it whatsoever! I would definitely recommend this title to anyone who enjoys watching TMNT cartoons.,1267228800,,154,5.2
3506043,4,B001C4ZQA2,"The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is the fact that they split up the seasons instead of putting them all in one set. So, it takes about 4 or 5 dvd purchases to make up one season.",1266019200,,186,3.7948717948717947
3506044,4,B001C4ZQA2,"My son loves this series-- he is six.  He unfortunately won't be seeing this from the order I placed.  Amazon cancelled this a week after I ordered.  I contacted Amazon requesting the order be fulfilled for the price it was offered and customer service told me two times they would not fulfill the order.  I was told they did me a favor by sending me an email that they were cancelling my order.  Thanks Amazon!  This is bad business and this is the second time Amazon has pulled this. I liked amazon but,Idon't do business when companies start this.",1228953600,2,550,4.505050505050505
3506045,5,B001C4ZQA2,"This 2-disc set collects the remainder of season 2 from the 2003 Ninja Turtles animated series. Note that while the Amazon graphic lists 13 episodes, there are actually 14 on this set and the final packaging has the correct number.

Season 2 of TMNT took the Turtles on a wild roller coaster of stories, and the episodes here reflect this. There are gang wars, inter-dimensional tournaments, alien planets, underground civilizations, and more. One of my favourites is the two-parter ""Rogue in the House"" where the Turtles team with a lost Triceraton to take down the Shredder's newest fortress. You also get crossovers with Stan Sakai's ""Usagi Yojimbo"" characters and a loving homage to the golden age DC/Marvel superhero teams.

There's definitely enough TMNT for your buck here - a few of the stand-alone stories do feel filler-ish and there's occasionally some story pacing issues (a result of TMNT having its last commercial break so close to the end of each show), but the problems are easily over-looked. Kudos again to another great original cover - can't wait to see what season 3 will look like.

One final note: the synopsis on the back cover actually lists the story arc for the beginning of season 3, which is only briefly teased in the last episode on this disc. Whoops.",1225584000,6,1283,4.876146788990826

3506093,5,B001C4ZQA2,"I love the series as much as any Turtles fan, but we can love it even more if the price wasn't so ridiculiously high with very little DVD sets for these episodes. I would've thought that since Nickelodeon now owns the Ninja Turtles franchise, Nickelodeon would also stock up on those old episodes of the 2003 series and the 1980's series.

Besides that, I know that many people are trying to see if this is a great series to watch, and in my opinion, it is the only TV show that 4Kids channel did right, for once. TMNT 2003 series holds a darker tone and takes its audience seriously, unlike their previous shows. It has a lot of action, mythical elements, aliens, ninjas, samurais, dragons, Triceratons, time travel, and alternate dimension travel. Another thing that this show hits is its' character development, story arc, and maturity level. It definitely raised the bar to how serious the creators are taking the audience and the fact that it doesn't even apologize for being so dark and sophisticated, just like Batman the Animated Series.

I have very few problems with the show and if you do have money and/or time on your hands, go ahead, check it out, and find out for yourself.",1388361600,,1188,4.652380952380953
3506094,4,B001C4ZQA2,"this is more about certain sellers then the DVD set itself. some sellers try to gouge up the prices to the point that the buyer will skipout on completing collections. this volume for example would be great to finish out the season 2 of the '03 series, but the sellers decided to markup a $25 DVD that may be ordered from the distribution company directly and charge nearly 8x it's price new while used currently starts over 11x the price if a direct sales new. I understand the price/ demand factor, but there is a difference between a very limited run from a company that went under, and a company that might re-release the sets for an anniversary. those that want to complete the season will end up buying the volumes that contain these episodes, even if they are in random orders throughout volumes 11-14, to complete it just out of frustration instead of the convienience of them in order in 1 set just because some sellers want to pull a ""gamestop"" profit margin level to try to make more money. this is why some products don't sell no matter how much people want a series. hope this helps buyers as well as honest sellers to the products they want out there.",1347840000,15,1165,4.5
