3876110,5,B00294Y722,"I received my dvd and I was able to complete two of the segments in the dvd. I did the crosstrain and a different one. I noticed I was out of breath shortly after the first segment. I love the 10 minute solution dvd series but, I feel that more time should be put in the warm up and cool-down without taking away from the segment. my suggestion would be to have a warm-up segment and cool-down segment each 3-4 minutes in duration. I believe this will reduce any injury that may befall an individual. I am almost 40 years old and I know I have to do my own warm-up session before any ten minute solution workout as well as a cooldown both 4-5 minutes or more. Overrall wonderful dvd and Cute Gloves I love pink. I have a long way to go as far as my weight goes , so any time saving fitness dvd's can help :).",1250467200,,808,4.05625
3876111,5,B00294Y722,"This is my first workout by Jessica Smith and it is my favorite of the 10 Minute Solution workouts.  Her form is excellent and so is her cuing.  It's not too intense; perfect for days when you want to warm up for another routine or to get a good workout in without over-doing it.  (I use it before my kettlebell routines and also on my ""active rest"" days.)  The gloves that came with the DVD fit great; I was pleasantly surprised.",1250208000,10,430,4.271604938271605
3876112,5,B00294Y722,"My new favorite dvd. I alternate between Jessica's, Jillian's and Ellen Barrett's pilates dvds. I know you should switch things up and not workout the same everyday but I have a really hard time not picking this one up for a day. I look forward to using this dvd at least 4-5 times a week. I workout 6 days a week and feel that I work very hard- I want to be dripping with sweat  at the end of my routine and this dvd gets that done. I have added ankle weights while I do this dvd just for a bit of an extra punch. The only complaint I have is that I think Jessica needs more dvds out there. I think I have all of hers and I love each one- she always seems to have  a new spin on things and makes exercising interesting again. She also is wonderful at explaining techniques- I think that's hard to find on many of the dvds out there. It took me one or two times all the way through to get the routines down but once you've got the exercises down it feels great. Love it.",1247616000,15,970,3.9692307692307693
3876113,5,B00294Y722,"This is the third 10 Minute Solution DVD that I own, and I must say it is my favorite.  The others that I own (a yoga DVD and a dance DVD) were ones that I bought with high hopes, but was very disappointed in them.  Not with this one!  Jessica Smith is the instructor, and she was the reason I bought it in the first place.  (I love her Women's Health DVD, Train For Your Body Type.)  She doesn't disappoint, and the 5 10-minute segments are all solid and targeted to what they are supposed to do.  The five workouts are:  Knockout Body Blast (a total body workout), Fat Attack (total body workout but increasing heart rate here with jumping & shuffling moves), Ultimate Upper Body, Kickbox Cross-Train, and Fierce & Fabulous Abs.  (This is the order they are played in if you hit ""Play All"" from the DVD menu.)

I wouldn't say it's for advanced exercisers, but it is a great intermediate workout that will get your blood pumping and work those ""problem areas.""  It comes with weighted gloves (I think they're 1 pound), which are used in every 10-minute segment.

The good:

1. The first two segments, Knockout Body Blast and Fat Attack, will get your heart rate up!  There is some jumping in these segments, so be careful if you have bad knees.
2. The Abs workout is fabulous; Jessica does some newer moves that I haven't seen before, and my abs were on fire by the end of those 10 minutes. (You need a mat for this segment.)
3. The moves, for the most part, were easy to follow and to do.  She does ""add on"" to moves, but she does more complicated moves slowly first, and then speeds them up.  I had some issues on more complicated moves, but they weren't anything that I couldn't pick up after watching her.
4. This is a solid workout; I really felt like I had worked out, unlike the other 10-minute solution DVDs I own.  Again, it wasn't super-high intensity, but it was a good solid workout.
5. Breaking this up into 5 10-minute segments really made the time fly by; for some reason it's mentally easier for me to complete this way!
6. You can customize your workout by playing any of the segments in any order, or you can do them all for a complete workout.

Needs improvement:

1. If you are seriously uncoordinated, you will have problems with the moves in the Knockout Body Blast, Fat Attack, and Ultimate Upper Body segments.
2. The upper body workout could have been a bit more intense.
3. It seemed like the Kickbox Cross-Train should be done first; Jessica actually shows you how to do the punches in this one.  If you hit ""Play All,"" it will be the next-to-last workout.
4. There really isn't a true warm-up to this workout.  When I saw that, I stopped the DVD and did some light cardio for a few minutes, and then continued.  There also isn't a real cool-down, either; I did my own with some stretches after doing all 5 segments.

I really like this workout as a nice intermediate workout.  I am recovering from a lower back injury, and just increasing the intensity of my workouts from doing 3 weeks of yoga and walking; this DVD made my back feel good, not broken!  =D  If you want to increase the intensity, you can buy heavier weighted gloves; if you want to decrease intensity, just don't use the weighted gloves and make your moves smaller and less intense.  All in all, Jessica Smith makes this workout fun and invigorating.  If you like the 10-Minute Solution series, you won't be disappointed with this one!",1245024000,115,3431,4.456730769230769

Also, she goes very quick at explaining the later segments so you have to be prepared to think fast and learn quickly.

3876143,2,B00294Y722,"I own A LOT of fitness dvds, mostly Jillian Michaels with some barre/yoga thrown in.  I bought the 10 Minute Solutions Booty DVD and LOVED it, so when I was on the hunt for a new cardio dvd to mix things up a bit, I decided to try another 10 minute solutions.  No matter how many times I try this DVD, I end up spending more time trying to keep up with her than actually getting any exercise in. By the time I finally think I have a combo down ... we're moving on to the next one and I'm struggling all over again.  I've never had a dvd that frustrated me so much.  I like the abs segment and have gotten pretty good at one of the others, but the rest might as well be impossible for me, because I'm just as bad at them today as when I bought it a month or so ago. Maybe I'm just that uncoordinated ... but some of my other dvds move pretty quickly or have sequences of multiple moves, but I never felt so hopeless with them, at least not past the first run through when you're learning the moves.",1476316800,7,997,3.9949748743718594

3876147,4,B00294Y722,Jessica Smith's Knockout Body Workout Exercise DVD is more suitable for people who are in shape. I could barely keep up with it because I'm just beginning. But I kept it because I have a vision that I can get to her level in the near future.,1470268800,,241,4.148936170212766

I have had this dvd for years now, gave my first copy to my mom and missed it so much had to buy myself another one! Love the mix and match feature and that each workout is only 10 minutes each. Don't let the time of each routine fool you though, each one will work you out and make you feel great and worked. Never gets old no matter how many times you do it. Love it!!",1457222400,2,503,3.9313725490196076
3876154,4,B00294Y722,"These workouts are excellent. Short, but they really pack a punch. Jessica is upbeat without being annoying, encouraging and clear. I work up a nice sweat and feel like I really maximized my time with her routine. My only gripe (and the reason I'm giving this four stars, not five) is that Jessica does the workout alone; I find that when exercise CDs include at least two people in addition to the instructor, they're more enjoyable you feel like you're part of a class.",1456963200,,471,4.619047619047619
3876155,5,B00294Y722,This is the 5th 10 minute solution DVD I own and I really love that I can customize my workouts. I really love kickboxing classes but don't have any near me. So this was a good alternative. Good workout.,1455926400,2,203,4.230769230769231
3876156,5,B00294Y722,"This video really impressed me.  I have many work-out videos and was a little leery to purchase this one because I have purchased other 10 minute solutions dvd's and was not impressed.  This video definitely changes my outlook on these dvd's.  I just received this last night, but was able to get through the first 3 ten minute workouts and absolutely love it!  Jessica breaks it down so you can easily follow along and then brings it up to speed, so that you can get a good workout.  I was sweaty after completing the first 3 sections and can feel the muscles that I worked today, which is always a good sign.  The time flew by to the point that I was shocked when each section was over.  I would definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a good kickboxing video.",1453852800,5,771,4.425531914893617
3876157,5,B00294Y722,"Good and fun workout!  I really like how I can do all 5 or just 1 or a few of the workouts and in the order I want.

3876159,3,B00294Y722,Best for someone has a good idea and some experience of kick boxing.. this is NOT for a beginner she moves too quickly without enough explanation or 'trial' run through the exercise.

3876165,5,B00294Y722,"There are not too many workout DVDs that don't have annoying instructors--(at least to me) and for me, an instructor that I can't stand listening to kills my motivation, no matter how good the work out is. (or maybe I just look for any reason to not work out....)  In any case, this instructor is great-- pleasant voice,  not oozing with fake enthusiasm and she actually sweats !!  The workouts are fun yet challenging, and the fact that there are 5 separate 10 minute workouts means you can do one, two or all of them for a super workout.  I like the kick-boxing theme, which actually makes me feel as if I'm learning useful moves!",1434412800,,632,4.469565217391304

3876169,1,B00294Y722,this has to be the worst kickboxing video i've ever seen. it's too fast paced (jessica expects you to know the moves already which is impossible). i spent more time trying to figure out what the hell she's doing instead of doing this rushed workout. i know each workout is 10 minutes long but really? i know there has to be better kickboxing videos than this.,1428364800,3,359,4.454545454545454

3876172,4,B00294Y722,"I do these 10 Minute Solution DVDs in sections, and then review each one as I go and I started getting better at writing these as I went along, so here is my breakdown please bear with me :)
Knockout Body Blast
This was fun kickboxing cardio, Jessica does a great job cuing and I enjoyed her style throughout.
Fat Attack
Some of the footwork in this one didn't flow as I would have expected for kickboxing, at 4:50 AM that can really throw you for a loop, but Jessica was great as always and this straight cardio routine was fun as well.
Kickbox Cross Train
I did this one, led by Jessica Smith this morning before an early meeting. Im not sure where the cross training comes in. All of the traditional punches were run through in a stationary position, then a few kicks and squats and lunges. More squats and lunges than I would have expected. There was a weird combo of plie and what would have been a tricep move overhead (is this a French press?) had I been holding a weight, at the speed it was done here, it felt a little awkward.
Upper Body
Though I did not acquire this workout with the weighted gloves that came with some versions of it, I wore my regular Turbo Jam weighted gloves as I figured the upper body component of this would require the weight. Lots of punches which is to be expected, though not many combinations of punching patterns. Typically in a kickboxing workout (or any boxing workout) the combo is Jab, cross, hook, uppercut. This one is Jab, cross, upper cut, hook, and it took me longer than it should have to grasp that change. She wraps it up with bent over flies (no weights, just the gloves) and pushups which I actually enjoyed with the gloves on. The cushiness was nice and it took some pressure off my wrists. Might invest in some of those yoga jellies that were all the rage awhile back.
Fierce and Fabulous Abs:
Let me preface by saying I really hate working abs, I feel like I get no payout for the hard work, but maybe that's because I don't do it enough (or I eat junk LOL). I wish this had been all standing abs, because that's my preference. That being said there were some innovative floor ab moves (mentioned in the other reviews) and it was only 10 minutes, so I couldn't hate it that much for long :)",1425427200,5,2248,4.329383886255924
3876173,5,B00294Y722,I was looking for a short cardio workout and this one really delivers!

It's nice because you can customize the workout depending on how much time you have. Do two of them if you're in a rush and only have 20 minutes, or do all of them in a row if you've got time and are in for a beating =) The workouts are surprisingly challenging and really fun. Definitely recommend to anyone who loves kickboxing or wants to try something new.",1423440000,4,477,4.195652173913044
3876176,2,B00294Y722,"This is a jumpy, girly aerobic workout with some punches and kicks thrown in (and some confusing cueing, but the impact of that lessens with repetition).  It's challenging, but the instructor doesn't really acknowledge that at all.  When I do kickboxing, I want snarling encouragement and stress relief, not ""beautiful"" and ""nice job"".  Go with Jillian Michaels instead.  Or, for a slower pace but still more like fighting, 10-Minute Solution Kickbox Bootcamp; I really feel that one all down my back the next day.  My favorite 10-Minute Solution workouts are anything by Lara Hudson--she's friendly and encouraging, and her workouts are great for when you want to feel challenged, but also stretched out and ultimately mellow.",1422662400,,727,5.232758620689655

I did not expect to like it because I thought it was going to be too hard or boring, like lots of cardio, squats, or repetitive moves.  It is just the opposite of what I expected.  I rarely look at the time and how much longer it is to the next segment.  The instructor is motivating and gives clear directions.  I think it is easy enough to follow, even if you have never done kickboxing.  This is the only 10 minute solution video in which I do and like all 5 segments.  They also are in a good order so I never have to re-arrange the order in which I do them like I have to with other 10 minute solution videos.  This is an excellent workout but isn't so hard that I dread doing it or avoid doing it, like some of my other exercise videos.

Obviously, you won't like every move but you can adapt it or you just push through it because you know it will be done in a minute. I will say that this workout tends to focus more on arm shaping and toning. It is great but I wish there was a bit more lower body toning. But they still do some with plies and squats and back kicks. So it is definitely still worth it.

my favorites. Initially,the combo moves and the idea
of the weighted gloves(I bought
the package without them)intimidated me. I'm  an
intermediate exerciser who's WELL past 50,so I knew it would
be a challenge. Well,it WAS,but in a GOOD way.

I tried out 4 of the 5 segments(the ""fat attack""
workout is too frenetic for ME) for 2 weeks without
the weighted gloves( I got the DVD without the
enclosed gloves) to get the hang of the moves,
then picked up a pair.

You do get nice definition and added strength in your arms
and shoulders. In six weeks I noticed positive changes in
my increased energy level, my physique,and the fit of my
clothing.

I appreciated the balance challenges in the ""cross train""
workout,which are especially helpful for older women. And
I LOVE the ""fierce and fabulous abs""segment which is tough,
but very effective;I was pleased by the results!
An added bonus is that this is a GREAT workout for travel;
both the gloves and the workout take up little space.
I dock it one star because I FEEL that the warm ups and
cool downs are inadequate;I use the segments from other DVDS
or improvise my own. But I definitely recommend it.",1338681600,4,1203,4.5813953488372094

I kind of had low expectations because of that so when I tried this, I was pleasantly surprised! The kickbox element is perfect (I love to kickbox), and I was already sweating after the first 10 minutes. I really like the instructor too; she's not annoying at all.

The only downside I found was that when she said what combos/moves we were going to do, she just went into them without showing or demonstrating them before. I kind of had to jump in when ready, which was a little confusing sometimes.

I know I did good then.  :)  I do recommend you know the basic boxing or kickboxing moves to keep up with the mini workouts.  There is no breakdown so do some reviews or other workout DVDs for kickboxing prior to this if you need too.  I recommend walking three to five minutes before beginning as there is no warm-up.  (I am big on warm-ups if you do not want to end up sore the next day.  Enough said.)  I recommend doing your own cool down at the end.  This is why it is a mini workout.  Not much to it.

(This video, like all the other 10 minute solution videos has 5 ten minute segments.) This DVD changed my mind completely- you can truly break a great sweat and burn lots of calories in a short amount of time. All the segments are kickboxing inspired, one focuses on abs, the other on your upper body, then there is a pure kickboxing segment, a cross training segment, and finally an intense cardio segment. My favorite segments are the Kickboxing Body Blast, and the Fat Attack. They will make you sweat and you will be sore the next day. I LOVE the instructor too, her name is Jessica Smith and she is so easy to listen to and follow- she makes it a pleasant experience to exercise. I would definitely recommend this video: it's effective, easy to follow, and enjoyable.",1317168000,39,935,4.571428571428571

I love Jessica as she's really the perfect trainer. Her instructions are really clear and she manage to be calm AND encouraging at the same time meaning she's motivating but not too much and never sounds like a crazy cheerleader or tries to make humor when there's no point doing it... Finally her figure speacks for herself and gets me more motivated every time.  I also love the 10 minute solution concept.  I'm from France and wanted to workout at home but here we really have no good fitness dvd so i ended up on amazon.com and discovered the 10 minute solutions dvd. It helped me a lot as i was a fitness beginner and couldn't workout more than 20-30 minutes at first and now it's the perfect way to put fitness in my agenda. I really wanted to rate this product because it's completely doable for a beginner and still gives you the opportunity to progress. Plus i'm french and i still understand everything she says...which let's face it .. is not always the case with other american fitness trainer...

This gives you a pretty good workout in a short amount of time and the moves aren't awkward or have you moving to the next move with little notice. Very user-friendly to work out with.  A shorter workout is better than no workout and recommend this to those with a busy schedule and want to keep working out a part of their day!",1315612800,,506,4.111111111111111

That being said, I'm also very selective about which workout DVDs I will praise and let me just say, this one takes the cake. I would give it an A-, which is as high as I'm willing to go with just about any workout.
This DVD has everything you could want in a workout: the host is friendly and motivating, the workouts are diverse and not repetitive, it's challenging and will make you sweat, but most of all, it's FUN. I have never gotten such a strong endorphin rush out of a DVD workout before, but these routines (the arms sadly being a weak point) always leave me smiling! I truly enjoy them and look forward to them. I even use this DVD as a special treat away from my other workouts, or as a pick-me-up to boost my energy or mood on days when need be.
So if you're looking for a workout that won't feel like work, even though you KNOW it's working--look no further! This is quite possibly my favorite workout ever, and favorite exercise DVD I own without a doubt. I truly can't recommend it highly enough!",1313884800,8,1084,4.371287128712871

I gave it a chance and had a good time. I did three of the workouts and sweated my butt off I had to add a little of my own moves to keep my heart rate up but overall this is awesome. The abs portion is my favorite some pretty cool moves I haven't seen before. I definitely recommend this workout.

The workouts are great, not only do they get your heart rate up while you're having a blast... they're great for burning off steam after a crummy day! Lol. Probably not what they had in mind, but it's a nice way to let off some aggression.

The gloves are a nice addition. A little awkward, as they're designed to fit all, but the extra weight really makes you work and put some strength into your punches. I feel oddly powerful and highly skilled when I'm throwing my fists around in these things, like I actually know what I'm doing.

Definitely a workout I'll be going back to A LOT.",1306281600,,707,4.348484848484849

I have done boxing a few times and the only issue I have is on behalf of newbies: she doesn't explain how to make a fist or how to properly execute the different punches (jab, uppercut, etc.). This is important if you are going to get the benefit and not hurt yourself, especially if you want to take it up a notch and start hitting a bag.

The hand weights are great. You definitely feel a difference when you do the workout without them, even though they feel like nothing when you put them on.

Overall, great if you're short on time.",1302566400,,697,4.2330827067669174

I can usually only wear them for about 20 minutes, then I take them off. I don't really notice any difference with them, vs. with out them for difficulty.

Last but not least, these boxing techniques are a great way to get your stress n frustration out. It feels good on every level mentally and physically. The techniques teach you how to really ""punch""! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you get this set.

3876271,3,B00294Y722,"I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.

Pros:  Overall, I like this instructor and have other workouts with her.  Her kickbox moves look quite athletic and crisp (unlike quite a few other DVD instructors who look terrible in comparison.)  I have a martial arts background and love kickbox routines because they burn a lot of calories and are fun for me but I cannot watch workouts where the instructor's moves are awkward, sloppy, or just plain unconvincing.

Cons:  Unfortunately, the cons outweigh the pros on this one.  This would be a good start for beginners.  That said, I barely ever hit my target heart rate zone.  The slow breakdowns of the moves --- again good for beginners who are not used to kickbox moves --- just dragged down any cardio impact.  I think all workouts --- no matter what level --- should break down individual moves in a separate segment of the video.  Proportionately, there was not much kicking in these kickbox inspired workouts.  Worse, I found the choreography often awkward the way the angles or lead sides were put together.  Probably the best workout was the abs routine.

Over all, this was still rather promising and served to make me want to try an intermediate/advanced kickbox workout from this instructor someday (hopefully with choreography that flows a little better.)",1298592000,9,1330,4.9324324324324325
3876272,5,B00294Y722,"""10 Minute Solution"" has become one of my favorite brands of fitness DVDs, and I tend to really enjoy each workout I buy from them.  This one is no exception with its high cardio kickboxing and boxing workouts that give me sore muscles the next day.  Jessica Smith is the trainer in this workout, and she does an amazing job cuing as well as breaking down some of the moves to make sure they are taught.  She is no-nonsense while still being fun to workout with.  This DVD is probably not for beginners to kickboxing, though, since it doesn't talk much about technique and doesn't break down every combo, but I think an intermediate to advanced exerciser who enjoys kickboxing will really like this DVD because the moves are familiar just done in combos that are unique and fun to do.  Like every other DVD in the ""10 Minute Solution"" series, this workout is broken down into 5 10-minute workouts.  They are:

Knockout Body Blast - This section is good at warming you up before giving you an intense workout.  You start out with bob and weaves with up to tempo punches (jabs, crosses, hooks, and uppercuts) in between.  Then you throw in some jump-roping (without a jump rope) and some running and jumping jack moves.  Next is a broken down basic front kick before moving onto some combos that are broken down before being pulled up to tempo.  The combos will include punches, knees, and kicks.

Fat Attack - You start off this workout right away with shuffles to the side and forward gradually adding punches and eventually kicks.  You then add on a punch combo and jump squat/turn around step.  You then put all of this together from the top.  The second half of this section will have you do the same thing on the left side.  You do some jumping exercises in between as transitions, but these aren't done for very long at all.

Ultimate Upper Body - This section is full of punches because they are, as Jessica says,""The ultimate upper body workout!""  You start with just some side taps with jabs before doing speedbags and hook punches; then you move onto jabs, crosses, and uppercuts.  You will then do some punch combos, putting punches together with other moves such as shuffles, hops, and squats.  You finish with fly exercisers while standing up and push-ups.

Kickbox Cross Train - This is an odd section to have as the fourth in order (although, you can, of course, change the order of these workouts with the mix and match feature) because it actually starts by breaking down and teaching all four of the punches I've mentioned before.  Then you move onto squats with triceps toning before then doing plies, dancer's lunges, and leg lifts.  This section really seems to focus a lot on leg exercisers, as a side note.  The next exercise you do is a back kick with lunges.  You next do roundhouse kicks, front kicks, and more back kicks with some added squats and bicep curls.

Fierce & Fabulous Abs - NOTE: A mat is recommended for this section.  In this part of the DVD, you warm up by do some twists and bends.  Eventually you add knee lifts to the twists and really squeeze your abs eventually adding a balance factor.  You then move onto standing crunches before moving to the mat to do planks with rotation and then back exercises.  Finally, you finish with crunches, bicycles, side planks, rotations, and a combo consisting of leg lifts and crunches.  This section is really tough, and will make your abs burn!

Also included with my DVD were 2 weighted gloves that each weigh about 1 pound.  They are supposed to really make the punching and arm movements tougher by working your arms harder, but, to be honest, I found that they were too light to add too much to the workout, although, they undoubtedly make the workout slightly more effective.

Like I said at the beginning of this review, I really recommend this DVD to intermediate/advanced exercisers that have done kickboxing before.  If you're a beginner there just won't be enough breakdown, and the workout will be pretty intense.  But, if you want an effective fat burner full of fighting-type moves (with an excellent instructor) then this is the DVD for you!",1296691200,8,4138,4.651515151515151
3876273,5,B00294Y722,"I really enjoyed this one.  Jessica is a really motivating instructor.  She makes you move pretty much the entire time.  It is not the hardest video in the series, but it is definitely fun.  If you are doing it for the first time, I recommend doing the sections in order because she teaches you the moves more in the early sections.  Note: there is no separate stretching section like in many of the 10 Minute Solutions DVDs if you really enjoy those.",1293580800,6,451,4.451219512195122

I really dislike home workout videos in general and get board easily with the repetitive things being said over and over again. Since I like boxing I bought 5-6 videos on boxing or kickboxing to try to keep me motivated.  This by far is my favorite!  It's fast paced so you don't get board easily and she doesn't say stupid or silly things over and over again so you can do it several times a week and not go crazy. She is encouraging without being annoying. I do the whole video at once and I sweat like I do when I run.  The moves are fun and solid. Oh, and for those who can't stand the back-up people smiling in the background as if the workout doesn't phase them, this video only has one trainer with no back-ups so it makes it that much more enjoyable.",1290643200,7,863,4.094674556213017

3876277,5,B00294Y722,"Oh my god! - Those were the words I kept on saying over and over again while working out to Jessica Smith's intense workouts. I am by no means a beginner and definitely not a hardcore fanatic but working out on these 10 min solution dvds have got me so motivated that i have worked out far more than I have ever wanted since I was in high school.

This is by far my favorite. All the moves in this series are fun, engaging and really works you out. I haven't tried all the dvds in the 10 min solution featuring different instructors though. I only bought Jessica Smiths's dvds because before buying, you get to watch a sample of the video. And the most important is that Jessica doesn't annoy you like some other instructors. She is encouraging, enthusiastic and really keeps you wanting to try harder. It definitely helps more when her fabulous figure is in constant view and you're thinking, ""I want those abs and arms!"".

What's smart is that you get to choose each workout on it's own or work out to the entire dvd. I like variety so it really helps that I can mix and match not only to this dvd but Jessica's other dvds too. It also works psychologically that it's only 10 mins/workout so you don't already feel depressed that you have to work out for an hour. By the time the first 10 mins fly back, you're ready and pumped to keep on going. I started 20 mins and slowly progressed to 50 mins and this is only my first week. I have been working out steadily for the last 5 days straight. For someone who dislikes the gym or even attempting to work out, I definitely am thankful to have found my solution.",1287014400,3,1610,4.31023102310231

3876279,5,B00294Y722,"I really LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this workout!!! I had so much fun doing it!! I was looking for a routine to replace the kickboxing class at my gym [can no longer afford the fee]..and THIS IS IT!!! Jessica is upbeat, engaging, motivating but she is not annoying, snarling or overly cutsie.  Her body is very motivating to me as it is athletic with curves.  I feel like she is really speaking directly to me.  For the record, I am trying to get back into shape after letting myself go for several years.  I am formerly a high school and college cheerleader/dance team.  I also played volleyball and soccer.  I consider myself pretty coordinated and after watching the DVD through the first time and then doing it a couple of times I found it easy to catch on to the steps.  But, I can totally see how it may be frustrating for others to learn the steps.  KEEP TRYING! You will get it or just do your own modifications -- I think it will be worth it!!

Sometimes your WII person is swinging their arms and you haven't even moved.  The graphics are terrible.  The people look deformed.  Once again it takes longer to get set up to do the exercise than it takes to actually exercise.  Slow movements and way too much down time.  It is not really a 10 minute work out since you can only do one five minute and then a break while it reloads the next five minute segment.

Bought this 10 minute solution workout set and I am really liking it.  I usually will do 3 of the workouts in a row and you have the choice to mix and match them differently each time.  I think this is what is keeping me interested, and the 10 minutes go by so fast you are ready to do another workout without thinking about it.  At first I didn't feel the workouts were very difficult, but I soon learned differently the next day when my muscles were sore. The weighted gloves also add to the workout.

It does exactly what it advertises.
The instructor is motivating and nice. The gloves are great for the price. The exercises really work and I saw changes in my whole body since the first time that I tried this.

To me the better way to do this if you want to do the whole 50 minute workout is:
1. Kickbox Cross Train
2. Ultimate Upper Body
3. Knockout Body Blast
4. Fat Attack
5. Fierce & Fabulous Abs
One good thing about the 10 minute workouts is that when you are really getting out of breath it finishes the segment and the on the next you have it again.
Because it doesn't really has warm-up or cool down I recommend doing the Kickbox Cross Train first as warm up or jump ropes a lithe bit before that. As a cool down some stretches are enough.",1270512000,6,812,4.211538461538462

However, I use them for 45 minute Turbo Kick classes as well. They became so stretched out after only a couple of classes, that now I can barely keep them on my hands.

The instructor is absolutely amazing... she is not annoying in the least but still very encouraging... my favorite phrase is "" there's no time to waste"": personally, I hate the mess around factor, and would rather just get it done. That's exactly what she does. However, this is a tough workout in my opinion, and I feel it ALL OVER the next day. I am starting from baseline (had 4 babies in the last 5 years and smallest 3 months) but I can do most of the stuff without dying. I do substitute some of the more ""outrageous"" abdominal moves she does, but look forward to working up to them.
I think the best recommendation I can give is that most of the time ( depending on my mood and the childrens'!)  I am often surprised that each segment has ended already... unlike other fitness DVDs I have had, I am not just making it through and hoping for the end. I actually have a positive attitude and enjoy this workout, which for me is 90% of the battle, since if I hate it I won't do it, no matter how good the intentions.",1269302400,2,1305,4.283400809716599
3876290,4,B00294Y722,"This is my first 10 Minute Solution DVD and I had a blast! Not only was it a great workout but with it being broken up into 10 minute segments, I found myself finishing up one and thinking ""yeah I could do another."" I only stopped at 4 because I was had other things to do haha! It was a GREAT workout and just a ton of fun! She is a great instructor and it while some of the moves are a little tricky, she's really good with her cues and keeping you moving the entire time. Also, I really like the gloves. They do fit me a little awkwardly and by the time I'm done I'm a little sore where the gloves rubbed up against my skin but its a minor discomfort and simply because of how they fit me.

I would absolutely recommend this DVD! I've tried a lot and this one is definitely a fun one to add to my collection!",1268611200,,811,3.9451219512195124

They are both motivating, cue well and it is obvious that they know what they are talking about. This workout is not easy, and I am sure it really burns calories. I recommend Amy Dixon's Kickin' Strength also. It is another fun workout!",1268092800,,318,4.5964912280701755
3876292,3,B00294Y722,"The DVD and weighted gloves are certainly a bargain.  The gloves are still in good condition and fit well on my hands.  They are also a nice easy weight to do during the moderately intense workout.  The workouts themselves are also good and intense for 10 minutes.  I just wish that there were perhaps a 30 minute workout mixed in that was a little less intense but a longer cardio workout to build stamina.  You do need to really pay attention the first time you workout since she keeps the pace fast for the 10 minutes.  Overall, it's good.",1268006400,3,542,4.424242424242424
3876293,4,B00294Y722,"I read a review of 10-Minute Solution:  Knockout Body Workout Kit w/Weighted Gloves, in Real Simple magazine, and decided to try it as a compliment to my regular gym workouts.  In the past, I tried a number of home exercise videos and DVDs, with no success (Winsor Pilates; The Firm Fat-Burning Cardio Toning w/resistance tubing; Tone, Trim, Tighten:  A Flexball Workout; 15-Minute Abs, etc.).  I just didn't like them, and as a result, stopped using them in about a month.  But this DVD I like a lot!  The moves are not complicated, don't require a lot of space, and are done at a pace that I find challenging, but comfortable.  The DVD contains five (5) 10 minute workouts that can be done individually, or combined to create a custom workout, which is also a plus.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone who is looking for a new execise challenge - its a great introduction to kickboxing.",1267488000,3,890,4.624203821656051

3876295,5,B00294Y722,"I bought this video because I love kickboxing and was super excited about the weighted gloves. I did 2 workouts (20mins) back to back and it was just tough enough that I was sweaty, it could be tougher but it's a good mix of difficulty. I've had one other 10 min solution video in the past and really liked it. I think it almost seems like I workout longer knowing I just need to finish 10mins then I feel good to do another 10 min workout.

I'm glad to have it in my collection now.  Trainer Jessica does a great job and has good energy.. she makes it look effortless.
It's a good choice for a beginner or intermediatte levels and fun if you like kickboxing!",1266624000,,659,4.222222222222222
3876296,5,B00294Y722,"Unlike some other reviewers I bought the DVD for the workout and was not disappointed. I'm interested in the instructor and type of workout rather than if it's 10 Min Solution or some other series. Jessica Smith is great and gives perfect instruction throughout these workouts. I'm very familiar with kickboxing, so this was super easy to follow (but challenging on endurance), I don't know how a beginner would feel though. Additionally, 12 oz. gloves don't do it for me, so I use 2.5 pounders and it's awesome. For segments with less jumping I strap on ankle weights. Great DVD.",1264550400,,580,4.81

The weighted gloves are very comfortable and so good for resistance, it really get's your cardio jump-started.  I love the fact that I can pick and choose my workouts and workout for 10 minutes or 50 minutes.

For an allover body workout I highly suggest this; especially if time plays a major factor in if you are going to workout or not!

I plan on ordering more as gifts, I already lent this to my college age daughter, it's portable as a workout, so that she can do it right in the dorm.
Thank you.
Truly inspiring!",1263945600,,627,4.148760330578512
3876299,2,B00294Y722,I bought this thinking it would be fun and easy to follow since it came from the 10-min solution products. However you go straight into a fast moving section and the instrutor gives you no instructions or explenations of the moves(she does do some explaining is a different segment)so I was left standing there going HUH? which when your trying to excercise is counterproductive. The only good thing about this is the gloves that I use with different workouts. If you don't have a kickboxing base or alot of time to just watch and flounder through until you can finally get it. Don't waste your money,1263340800,7,600,4.669811320754717

I cannot think anything bad about this exercise DVD.",1261699200,,366,4.825396825396825

3876303,5,B00294Y722,"I own a lot of the 10 minute solution videos and usually I am pretty pleased with what is produced. I took a break from them to do some heavier workouts. I picked this one up when I decided to start back into varing my workout. I was very pleased.

Pros:

The trainer. I love her! She gives very good cues and is not super perky where you want to slap her. Also, she has a very fit (healthy) body type not some of the super skinny ones I have seen. Gives good encouragement. However, I made my boyfriend do this one with me and he just loved her ""bikini season is coming up"" comments.

The moves. It is a step up from some of the other videos where the moves were just too easy. Good intermediate moves, just a step under advanced.

Cons:

I really don't have cons on this video. The gloves made my hands sweaty, but I used heavier hand weights the next time I did the video so no issues.

I wouldnt suggest this one for a beginner just starting out. If you are ready to move on to the next stage, this one is wonderful.",1260230400,,1020,4.075

I easily get irritated by some video instructors and the 'over peppiness' they can bring, but Jessica is a fantastic instructor and I plan to purchase more of her DVD's soon. The gloves are so cute and they really add to the workout, especially when it comes to her balancing moves. I am in no way coordinated, but after doing the workouts a couple times she's easy for even me to follow. You'll get some major cardio in this one, I'd absolutely recommend this to anyone who wants a balanced and fun workout in their collection!",1258588800,2,627,4.508771929824562

3876306,5,B00294Y722,"I love, love, LOVE this DVD! This was my first 10 Minute Solution workout DVD, and it's made me a fan. I find myself wanting to use this DVD more and more. Each workout is great on its own--though short! But putting several together in what order I choose makes this series special. I really like Jessica a lot. She's very positive and down-to-earth and cues well. The workouts make me actually break a sweat and feel like I've done something, even though the workouts are short. The weighted gloves enhance the workout, and can be used with other DVDs/exercises as well. I tend to get bored easily, and the fact that I can pick and choose and mix things up is a real plus. I've ordered several more 10 Minute Solution DVDs based on how much I enjoy this this one, and I'm sure I won't be disappointed. If you have trouble finding time to work out (like I do), you can't go wrong with this DVD! It's so easy to fit one or 2 or more of these into your day!",1257465600,,955,4.224043715846994

3876308,5,B00294Y722,"This is the first 10 minute Solution workout I have ever bought and I have to admit that the main reason I got this was for the weighted gloves. I like how the workouts are divided into 5, 10 minute workouts and that you can mix them in the order that you want to do them and how many you want to do.  I did the full 50 minutes and all I have to say is ""wow"". Today I really feel the muscles I worked, my arms, back, legs and abs. The weighted gloves add a little intensity to the workout and I'm pretty sure they are the reason I am sore today. Fun and easy to follow. I really liked this one, will add this one on my cardio days for sure.  I'll be buying more 10 min solution workouts again..",1253923200,,694,3.880281690140845

I do all the video segments to have about an hour of workout time and by the beginning of video two, I am sweating bullets.

It's such a good idea to break the workouts up into 10 minute segments. I'm definitely NOT a workout DVD veteran (this is my first one). She is a great instructor. I've done this DVD about 5 times now and it just gets better.

The ab workout is especially great! It's only 10 minutes but it seriously works.",1252454400,2,448,4.149425287356322
3876311,5,B00294Y722,"Now owning 13 of the 10 Minute Solutions workout DVDs, I think it's fair to say I'm very happy with my training library and this latest addition is absolutely fantastic.  Jessica Smith is one of the best instructors I've worked with, as she not only encourages but uses different ways to motivate, by mixing up what she says while taking you through the set, including imagining yourself swimsuit ready all year round, throwing out snappy phrases to keep you going until the end of the reps, 'finish strong!' and informing you of the health and science part behind the moves, in such a way that I found my determination to succeed doubled.  She's friendly and knowledgeable without being overly perky and annoying, so repeat sessions won't be a problem.

I like that Jessica wears the exact same gloves that come with the DVD and not a modified version.  Sometimes, if there is anything even slightly different about the kit, say a different colour, you can wonder if you are getting the same workout, but not here!  I agree with the previous reviewer about having 'Kickbox Cross-Train' playing first as the 4 basic arms moves are demonstrated in this section: jab, cross-punch, upper-cut and hook-punch, but it plays 2nd from last if you choose the 'Play All' option.  If I'm doing all 50 minutes, I tend to programme it so I do 30 minutes of cardio first, then upper body, closing with abs.  Although all the sections are cardio intense, and there is a surprising amount of lower body work too.  All the workouts are based on the principal of interval training, so plenty of metabolism raising moves, incorporating fat attacking steps, strength training with plenty of sculpting and toning too - what more could you ask for!  Plus, there are some inventive routines and excellent transitions between repetitions, so you don't get bored, it's all kept really fresh.

My only minor quibble is the loss of the minute timer on my DVD player when programming my workout as opposed to using the 'Play All' feature, which does have a timer.  When exercising to my other 10 Minutes Solution DVDs using the 'Create your own Workout' option, my player displays a timer for each section, which I find really useful.  For instance, if I glance across and see that 3 minutes have gone by, I know where I am in the routine, what's coming up next and how far I've got to go - and this comes in really handy when doing the very intense 'Blast off Belly Fat' and 'Quick Tommy Toners' workouts.  With this DVD, a rather unhelpful 'Play' is displayed, but it's not a major issue, I've just got used to being able to see exactly where I am at any given point.

Overall, a challenging cardio workout, that will get you sweating and with the use of light weighted gloves, you'll see accelerated results - very highly recommended!",1251590400,30,2809,4.694501018329939

I found that it gave a good work out and it was interesting.  It was also good in that it didn't seem to rely soley on high impact exercises (unlike hot body bootcamp that almost always hurts my knees).  I also, when I did the whole thing, found my arms nice and sore the next day.  Yay for toned arms!",1251504000,,518,3.8679245283018866

I have not done a lot of kickbox workouts but I have the 10 Minute Solution Kickbox Bootcamp workout and really like that one, so I thought this one would be fun too.  Knockout Body is more advanced than its predecessor. This workout got me sweating and my heart pumping!  The choreography was easy to follow (I have two left feet) and I kept up with no problem.  The first two sections (Knockout Body Blast and Fat Attack), really got my heart pumping while working my whole body.  The Ultimate Upper Body section lives up to its name, because I got an effective workout for my arms and the rest of my upper body.  The Kickbox Cross Train was great because I still got a good whole body workout and cardio, while giving attention to my legs a bit more and getting them toned.  I love the Fierce and Fabulous Abs section!  This other four sections worked my core pretty good, but this section shredded them!  I could really feel the burn! This was a really fun workout, but is also effective.  I was surprised by the results I feel and see by using the weighted gloves.  The gloves are very well made and very comfortable, as well.  The instructor, Jessica Smith, has been used in three other 10 Minute Solution workouts and she is very good.  I like her style, motivating and cheerful, but not annoyingly perky.  Her cueing is very good also.  I hope she is going to be featured in more workouts.  I will be using this workout a lot and really hope others will try it.
