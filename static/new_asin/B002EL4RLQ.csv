3917814,4,B002EL4RLQ,"One of the big arcs of the ""Stargate SG-1"" series was finding the Lost City of the Ancients, also known as Atlantis.

It also turned into fertile fodder for a spinoff series (come on, you KNEW they had to make one eventually). And though it had a slightly shaky start -- much like its parent series -- the following seasons saw ""Stargate: Atlantis"" blossom out into a solid sci-fi series with a legendary series, new alien parasites, and new nasty machines from long ago.

At the Antarctic base, Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) has finally figured out the location of Atlantis -- in the Pegasus galaxy. General Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) lets an exploratory unit to go to Atlantis -- even though they don't have the power to return back to the Milky Way, and will be stranded there.

So Dr. Elizabeth Weir (Torri Higginson) leads an international group of scientists and military personnel to another galaxy, and arrive in the sunken Ancient city of Atlantis. After some initial problems, the ancient city is secured and has risen above the water -- but unfortunately the military unit, including Major John Sheppard (Joe Flanigan), have run afoul of the parasitic, life-sucking alien Wraith, who destroyed the Pegasus Ancients long ago.

And the Pegasus galaxy has plenty of its own dangers -- nanoviruses, spies, life-sucking bugs, cannibal Wraith, enzyme addicts, whales, an egomaniac baker, weird Ancient devices, Wraiths transformed into humans (and vice versa), ""alternate reality drives,"" Ancient artifacts, crooked businessmen, fear machines, a race of hybrid bug monsters, crystalline nightmare aliens, and a race of ruthless soldiers pretending to be Amish-like farmers.

The Atlantis base regains contact with Earth, but this may not be enough to save them from the Wraith's attempts to gain control of Atlantis -- and the only Stargate with Earth's coordinates. To make matters worse, they encounter a planet of what seems to be Ancients, only to find that they are in fact a mechanical experiment gone horribly wrong. And they really, really hate humans -- and an attack of theirs leads to Weir being horribly injured.

At the same time, Atlantis receives two new commander -- first Colonel Samantha Carter (Amanda Tapping), formerly of SG-1, and then the once-fussy Woolsey (Robert Picardo). Not that it's any easier than SG-1 was, as the crew faces a startling pregnancy that attracts unwanted attentions, predictions of doom, and Wraith incursions that are striking a little too close to home -- on the way to Earth.

""Stargate: Atlantis"" has an easier introduction than most series, even spinoffs. The whole idea was introduced over a few seasons of ""Stargate SG-1,"" some of the characters (Weir, Woolsey and McKay) were also recurring characters, and Tapping was a regular. Teal'c and Daniel even drop in. And while the first season is a bit bland (""The romancing of the alien priestess? It's very 1967 of you,"" Rodney snipes) the storyline hits its stride in the second season.

And it has plenty of sci-fi staples -- ugly nasty aliens, tightly wound scientists, little tubular ships, explosions, moral quandaries and a bit of classic-style horror (just look at Michael's ""experiments""). But it doesn't lose its laid-back style (Rodney having trouble with a mustached woman who resents being called ""sir""), or its human side, such as the handling of certain characters who are lost (some of whom are not really gone for good).

And the dialogue is pretty great, with lots of one-liners and snappy exchanges, with the occasional pop culture reference (""It's the ultimate answer to the great question of life, the universe and everything!""). Most are from Rodney (""Just once, I would like to be taken prisoner by the sexy alien!""), and Sheppard (""But then I'd be The Man, and who would I have to rage against?""). But there's humor from everyone (""He put his hand in my forehead! How can you resist that?"" ""Well, I like to close my eyes and think of England""), including the Wraith (""I hope they prove as delicious as the farmers who grew them"").

One thing Atlantis does have is a high cast turnover, compared to the relatively unchanging cast of the previous series -- Higginson does a pretty good job as the scientist-command but is given too little to do. After season three, she she was replaced by Tapping, who brings a bit of seasoned science-military fusion to the mix, then fusspot Woolsey who manages to actually be a good if befuddled commander (""Monkey? Did you say flying?"").

Flanigan has a nice O'Neillian snap to his performance (""I HATE clowns!""), David Hewlett is hilarious as the antisocial, ever-exasperated scientist, and Paul McGillion is adorable as a Scottish doctor. And while Rachel Luttrell and Jason Momoa are never quite as endearingly alien as SG-1's Teal'c (who makes a guest appearance), they are quite solid as a psychic martial-artist and a rough-edged warrior.

""Stargate Atlantis"" loses a few too many cast members, but the storylines and aliens add a fresh dimension to the Stargate universe. Definitely worth the while.",1245888000,46,5083,5.045292014302741

3917820,5,B002EL4RLQ,"Love the show, love the characters. Jason Momoa is incredible as Ronon Dex, appearing in Season 2. Rodney, Teyla, John and Ronon make up a fun team, each becoming a favorite character in no time for their own qualities. This is similar enough to the original Stargate series, but becomes its own show. Every episode is well written, fun to watch. Some are more funny, while others are serious. Todd the Wraith is one of the best villains, premiering in the episode ""Common Ground"". And Rodney, well he's Rodney. Quirky, smart, egotistical, but a central part of the team. Teyla, a warrior who can take care of herself. Even when the evil Michael (another Wraith) targets her. Nothing can stop that woman! The entire series was so much fun to watch, I have binge watched my favorite episodes over and over. Its worth every penny. I do wish Amazon would not put boring and biased Editorial comments though. Some are misleading and so biased it might make some people reluctant to purchase. A brief synopsis of the series, along with actual reviews by actual viewers is more accurate",1479340800,,1080,4.75

3917828,2,B002EL4RLQ,"Love the series. But horibble packaging. I am just now starting to view these though bought couple of months ago. Almost every disk has scratches so that either the picture ""stutters"" or freezes and won't go further. It's almost like the burning process is flawed for the scratches seem to be in an arc following a circular pattern and some are deep enough, it's totally worthless. The other thing is that without a remote for the DVD, you can't fast forward to the next episode. You need a remote with up and down arrows. With the first 3 disks, i can continue to whichever episode i wanted by using FF botton, but with some of the disks cannot. Tried fast forwarding and it comes right back to the same first episode like it's on a loop. Just getting the DVD out of its pocket is difficult. Without care one could damage it just getting it out. Very tight. Now I have to buy a DVD with a remote just to see the episodes and then hope I can skip past the scratched part.",1469491200,,971,4.311475409836065

3917859,3,B002EL4RLQ,"Don't know why you'd spend $60 to own a series you can watch for free online, but anyway, Atlantis was very very definitely the jewel in the Stargate crown, vastly superior in every way to the relentlessly dumbed-down SG-1 and the thankfully short-lived and glum SGU. In fact, it's one of the better TV sci-fi series in recent years. It's no Firefly, but still good. Good writing, generally good acting for tv, excellent bad guys in the Wraith, very high production values for tv. It's too bad the writing started to wobble and then went off the rails in the last 2 seasons, and terrible the way it ended -- it should have gotten a few more years to get back on track and get a proper sendoff after, oh, 8, 10 seasons. The dopey SG1 got 10. In a better universe, the last 5 of those would have been swapped over to Atlantis.",1440115200,,824,4.357142857142857

3917877,5,B002EL4RLQ,"My sister's favorite TV series in the world (both on AND off the air) and easily on my top 3 myself. It beats out its predecessor, SG1, in a lot of ways, primarily the movement away from a total militaristic storyline. In SGA, we have a civilian operation with a military presence, but in a way that ultimately puts forth a lot of conflict in the show: do we take this from a military approach, or no? It's a question they struggle with throughout the series.

The main cast, Dr. Rodney, Sheppard, Teyla, and Ronan, all bring something to the table and bounce off of each other in ways that remind you of the original SG1 team: the team chemistry is there, and they all contribute both to their personal lives, and to life in the Pegasus Galaxy. The support cast of Beckett, Weyer, Carter and Wolsey from SG1, not to mention various crossover characters from the spaceships and SG1 series, really help the story and characters come to life.

It's not necessarily the sci-fi to end all sci-fis but I do believe it's one of the greats, moving people the way Star Trek did in years past to jump into the show and stay interested.

In terms of special features, you have the typical show commentary, behind the scenes, etc., that can help immerse you in the world of SGA, but personally, the show will always be what keeps my interest. The series is fantastic on the DVDs (I'm not sure if bluray could truly do more justice to the special effects, but that's just me), and well worth the price to have the whole series, especially in one nifty box with SGA artwork.

I think my only gripe isn't a gripe at all--they just canceled the show too early, without renewing the movie or series the way we all desperately wanted when it was still on air. I could easily have watched this running as long as SG1 did!",1432252800,,1803,4.438066465256798

3917901,5,B002EL4RLQ,"I have always loved this series the thought of a lost expedition to Atlantis fighting for survival cut off from the rest of their world just had me glued to the tv screen. I think what ruined the series for me was when the earth ships started to make trips back and forth from earth and used the ultra powerful weapons that three shot the wraith ships. it made the expedition too powerful and took away from the shows intention of being the lost expedition. I thought the final show / end of the series a bit rushed, its like the producers had a short notice that it wasn't being renewed so they scrambled to make it work.

As far as the boxed set itself it is very beautiful and I didn't have any issues with any of the discs as reported by the others but I can see how they could have. the main box has several leaflets that get caught if not put in place properly. but on the leaflets themselves there are stoppers for the dvd holes that have the consistency of molded and cooled hot glue. they leave streaks of the dvds and if not stored properly could damage the dvd. I don't know who thought it was a great idea to do this but if not careful this could lead to disastrous results. I would recommend never keeping them in a area where the sunlight could hit the box or where it gets above 70 degrees. I wouldn't recommend storing the leaflets without all of the dvds to avoid smudging.",1426377600,2,1390,4.245283018867925

I have read other reviews of other series where the reviewer complained about faulty discs, but this is the first one I've ever run across. And now, it is too late to do anything about it. Amazon doesn't do returns after 30 days, and doesn't seem to have a ""faulty disc policy.""

The original doctor is an embarrassment to Scots, so much so, I'm surprised they didn't start a letter campaign and complain.  Joe Flanigan's character is an over-used stereotype.  Come on, anyone with military service is aware of ""loose cannon"" syndrome.  But he takes so many security risks, you can't believe he's not a civilian... Luttrel has the best character, though Momoa's character is at least consistently plausible.  If you can get past the inane defects, it is slightly entertaining...",1421107200,,806,5.1461538461538465

the picture quality is good and sound is also good. My only problem with the set was disk 3 of season 4 refused to play one episode so had to work around that and play it via the scene menu, and disk 4 of season 4 also had a similar issue.

3917952,4,B002EL4RLQ,"I really enjoyed this series despite having the same formula as the first. When I saw pieces of Atlantis and its characters on the first SG, I was taken aback and did not want to see Atlantis (the sets looked corny and I found the characters, such as Weir and McKay, annoyed me). Nothing could top the first series, right? Wrong. It took me years after seeing the first to get to this one, but I finally did after a friend's recommendation. This show has the same renegade off the cuff against impossible odds leave no man behind everybody speaks English formula, yet it has something that pushes aside the cheese: the characters. It took me a while, but I actually liked the characters of Atlantis far more than SG1, especially Rodney, which I completely unexpected. The SG1 characters seem rather two dimensional now. What seemed like cheap knock offs of the original characters turned out to be an improved second generation product (think SG 2.0).
Seasons 1 through 4 had good cliff hangers and multi part episodes, while season 5 just kind of ended with no build up at all. The commentaries showed that they had no idea that the show was ending until they were at the last episode or two, but I think they knew something because they were not building up to the typical season end cliff hanger. Unfortunately, they were not building up to a particularly satisfying resolution either, however, my favourite episode is the second to last episode (Vegas), which was a great character piece, and the very last episode itself was satisfying enough.
The series itself gets five stars. The extras are a fine bonus and I looked at some, but I am not a huge extras person so I have no rating. The DVDs and packaging are a three because 1) the paper case is not good for protection 2) my player had trouble reading some of the discs despite no scratches 3) two or three of the seasons have a navigation design issue of which I cannot recall details.",1417132800,,1944,4.589080459770115

3917986,4,B002EL4RLQ,"Love this show. Not nearly as good as its big brother SG1, but way, way, way, way better than I would have expected of a spinoff. Vastly higher production values (About twice the budget of the parent series) and a generally great cast. It falters in season 4 when they bring in two major new characters, one of whom everyone was looking forward to, but who just didn't work. The show recovers in season 5, but, alas, as with ALL Stargate series, it suffers from the lack of a real finale. It is curious how McKay took the spotlight in the final season, and Sheppard became less of a dominant lead.

Just the same: a great show, a lot of fun, well worth watching, and way the heck more fun (And often smarter) than Star Trek.",1411776000,,724,4.323529411764706

3918013,1,B002EL4RLQ,"OK first let me say my wife and I love the Stargate series. We decided to get this collection because it was a little cheaper than buying each season individually. We have had several episodes that have not played well. The video cuts in and out and freezes etc. There is no visual damage to the disks that we can see but they are acting as if they are severely scratched. We recently found that season 2 disk 3 will get half way through the first episode then starts cutting in and out then freezes all together. When you go to main menu and try other episodes on the disk it will either load the next menus but freezes there and only showed half the menu screen, or it stops itself and when you get it to play again you go back to the beginning of episode 1 regardless of what episode you were trying to watch. Needless to say this has a little mad. We don't like waisting hard earned money and if there are more disks like this one that is exactly what we did! We are not at all happy with the product!

3918031,5,B002EL4RLQ,"I'm not going to say anything about the story line, characters, special effects, video and audio quality or many other aspects of ""Stargate Atlantis: The Complete Series."" For one thing, I haven't watched any of it yet. I never saw the series when it first aired because I didn't get the channel, so I know nothing about the series as a television production. I bought it sight-unseen simply because it was a no-brainer to pick it up after I purchased the complete original ""Stargate"" series DVD set.

However, so many of the reviews here complain about bad packaging and scratched, damaged and unplayable DVDs that I felt I had to offer my observations on that topic.

The set that I received contains six thin cardboard folders in a sturdy cardboard slipcase. Each folder holds five DVDs (except for the 6th, which contains just the one special features DVD). Most importantly for the issue at hand, the folders all feature thin, soft, rubbery plastic spindles above the DVD slots that engage with the hole in the DVD hub. Thus the DVDs are held firmly in place; they don't move around in transit and they don't get scratched. I inspected each and every DVD, and each one is pristine.

So I'm not sure what's going on here. My set was packaged exceptionally well to avoid damaging the DVDs, and it absolutely succeeded. Has the manufacturer upgraded the packaging recently because of the many prior complaints? I don't know. But I do know that all 25 DVDs in my set are perfect.

So if you've been considering buying ""Stargate Atlantis: The Complete Series"" but have held off because of concerns about whether your DVDs would arrive damaged (as I did for quite a while), I hope you find this report of my experiences useful. There's no reason not to pick up this set because of such concerns. Now it's REALLY a no-brainer.",1401926400,2,1824,4.70846394984326
3918032,5,B002EL4RLQ,"What's there to say... Ronan! Lots and lots of Ronan. Loved the humor and techno-babble on this show. It doesn't take itself as seriously as the other Stargate series'. The trio of John, Dex and Rodney was great.",1401408000,,212,4.605263157894737
3918033,5,B002EL4RLQ,"Classic Sci-Fi series, or at least a good spinoff of one. Has a different feel than SG-1, and takes time to get used to the new characters, but is familiar enough that if you enjoyed the original series, your probably going to love this too. The only complaint I have is with the character Tayla. She's always got mental/psychic/womanly problems all the time. Every other episode she's clutching her head and moaning in a way that makes my neighbors wonder what the hell I'm doing. I wonder how that actress's audition went that the director wants her moaning all the time, in like every episode. Sorta takes away from the kick-a image they were going for, also making her character look like a mentally deranged woman who let's out bedroom sounds at every sign of danger, death, or destruction.
And the space ships, good lord the space ship. They're everywhere, massive and epic full scale battles, and for once earth has an actively used fleet of it's own rather than stolen Go'auld transports/ mothership, although they make an appearance too.

I bought one set and finally gave up during the second season.  One disc would not play at all.  Five other discs, of about eight, stopped playing at some point during a show.  Amazon promptly replaced it with a new one, but it was even in worse shape, so again I gave up during the second season and got a refund.  Very frustrating since I really enjoyed Stargate SG1.

If you do buy these, check every disk immediately!  I didn't open the set until 5 months after I bought it.  The very first DVD was totally unreadable - couldn't even bring up the menu.  I tried three difference DVD readers.  Even IsoBuster couldn't recover it.

The next 4 were fine.  That leaves 21 more to check.

I called the number on the box.  After just a couple minutes on hold and about two minutes with a rep, I was told I'd be sent a return label by email to return the entire package for a replacement.  The email appeared just seconds later.

I can't even get past season 1!  I called Amazon customer service to see if they could just send me a replacement although I was past the return time.  They make no exceptions even though all I want is a replacement.  I paid $198 for the series and I see now it's on sale for $55.  Wish I had waited then I wouldn't be so upset having paid all this money and not be able to watch them.  I'm going to try CD repair and see if that resolves the issue.  Mine is DVD and not Blu Ray which may make a difference.  Extremely disappointed in the piss poor quality and customer service of Amazon.  I gave it a one star for these reasons.  Love the series.

I had read this on all reviews and have transferred all discs into much sturdier and containers. That being said I had not a single problem with any of the discs. They all played perfectly fine and I am in the middle of watching the whole series through for a second time. If you purchase this set be very careful removing the discs from the packaging that it comes in. I wouldn't advise letting the kids have access to them with out supervision.

This was a cool show.",1387497600,,119,4.714285714285714
3918078,5,B002EL4RLQ,"I had never watched this series in its original broadcast run. After completing SG-1 on dvd, I purchased this set. I'm glad I did.

First, the product itself: The packaging of the set is attractive but not great, with the discs held in place in a less than ideal way. It's nowhere near as horrible as the disastrous SG-1 complete series disc arrangement, but it would have been preferable for the discs not to have to slide and overlap as they do. Fortunately, I did not have any damaged discs.

The set is loaded with commentaries by the executive producers, writers, and others. There isn't much cast participation, but the producers and showrunners provide often interesting insights, and - though I'm not the type who generally feels compelled to listen to commentaries - I did find myself checking a lot of them out. Warning, though: if you haven't seen the series before, they do tend to reveal spoilers randomly in commentaries. If, like me, you hate spoilers, wait until after finishing the series to listen to the commentaries.

As I watched, I jotted down some notes for this review, so the following thoughts on the series might be a little disconnected. Spoilers follow as I look at the show season by season:

Season One:

Not very good. Especially the first half, before the show found its footing. I felt they set up the Wraith as the bad guys too quickly. Similarly, Teyla's joining the team was rushed, and it felt like they had an idea about what the thrust of the show would be but were not patient in building the foundations.

The Ford character was awful. I think he was supposed to be an audience surrogate in disparaging McKay, but McKay is actually more relatable and far more interesting. Bad acting plus poor character development meant writing Ford off for season two was a great move, probably the single best casting change in a show that saw numerous shifts in its five-year run.

Season Two:

Much improved.

Ronon was a good addition. Jason Momoa is not an amazing actor, but he had something very important that Rainbow Francks lacked as Ford: charisma. He was a better fit for the team than Ford, but again, like Teyla, joined the team a bit too easily. He's trusted too quickly, and they should have done more to develop him and his backstory in season two.

The team itself doesn't quite make sense to me. Clearly Dr. Weir isn't qualified to lead in the face of the military threat of the Wraith. Then there is only one actual military person on the Stargate team. I found myself wondering, why would McKay be sent on missions? He's totally vital back on Atlantis, so sending him out to random planets seems like a risk that should not have been taken. For the dramatic purposes of the television series, it's fine, but it was a thought that got in my head and stuck.

Interestingly, our people make some rather stunning moral/ethical decisions at times, e.g. experimenting with converting Wraiths to humans and thinking that Wraithness is an ""unnatural"" state. This experimentation of the Wraith was where the show started to really find some depth.

Season Three:

Four episodes in, we finally get a Ronon story.

At this point, the show is definitely in its groove. It had a move-like double-episode, featuring Richard Dean Anderson, which was great. Many other episodes were the best in the series, like the powerful, gut-wrenching ""Sunday.""

The Wraith finally get really interesting this season. The best one, Christopher Heyerdahl's ""Todd"" added a great wild card element to every episode he was in.

Season Four:

This season saw the addition of Amanda Tapping to the cast and the subtraction of Tori Higginson, who had acquitted herself okay but had become a dead end. Higginson had improved over the years, and Weir had some good episodes in the third season, but I was happy to see her go. But then there were a surprising number of episodes without Amanda Tapping. She was definitely underutilized, and of course she would leave for Sanctuary at the end of the fourth season, so an opportunity was, if not entirely wasted, not taken full advantage of.

I wish David Nykel's Dr. Zelenka could have been in even more episodes. He should have been a full cast member.

By season four, it's firmly ""The Dr. McKay Show"" or ""The McKay and Sheppard Show."" Rodney McKay, played by the outstanding David Hewlett is the character that gets the most development and most interesting stories.

The show slips a little with episodes like ""Harmony."" More episodes this season feature fewer characters.

Season Five:

Great special effect to open the fifth season. No more Amanda Tapping. She moved on to Sanctuary.

Jewel Staite finally earned her spot in the opening credits. Robert Picardo joined the full-time cast, too. Picardo's a fine actor, but he was wrong for this series. His role was limited, for good reason, though he was finally coming into his own by the end of the season.

Paul McGillion was better after his original character had been killed off than when he was a regular. I think it's notable that this was true of Francks and Higginson, too. Both of their characters were better in their returns than when they were there each week. McGillion's appearances in particular were well done and always welcome.

It was great to see a Daniel Jackson two-parter.

I love the Sheppard calls Ronon ""Chewy,"" as Sheppard definitely has a Han Solo vibe and Ronon a Chewbacca one. I think it's great that they acknowledge this in a small, funny way.

Eight episodes from the end, they did a clip show. That should not be allowed to happen in a modern television show.

Stargate Atlantis was prematurely cancelled. The bonus features highlight the surprise of all involved. It's also clear that they expected to make annual tv movies, which, unfortunately, have not happened and likely never will. There should have been a season six. Though the show has a good finale, it deserved another year or two. McKay in particular, but Sheppard, ""Todd,"" and the others, too, had a lot of depth, and the Pegasus galaxy held the promise of many more story options. The series stands tall, and wonderfully complements SG-1, as a must-see science fiction series, along with Battlestar Galactica, Farscape, Babylon 5, and the (first three) Star Trek series. Atlantis's humor, willingness to explore different ideas, and memorable characters qualify it as a top-tier show in my book.",1387065600,,6412,4.815118397085611
3918079,5,B002EL4RLQ,"I started watching Atlantis during a long weekend, snowed in at a crummy motel with nothing to do and was hooked!

3918081,3,B002EL4RLQ,"This series is very good, but this set is packaged very poorly which caused several discs to be scratched.  Two discs were completely ruined, so I returned it for another.  Luckily I had a month to return the first set after receiving the replacement because one of the discs in the second set wouldn't play either so I replaced it from the first before returning it.  I have moved all of the discs into a standard CD wallet because the packaging is so terrible I fully expected to ruin more discs before watching the series twice.  Moral: if you order this set, make sure to watch all the discs to make sure they aren't scratched beyond repair before it's too late to return them!

3918085,3,B002EL4RLQ,"I liked the packaging but I can see how it would be problematic for people who want to watch the series multiple times. I might watch it a second time but it isn't engaging enough to watch more than that. The storyline kept getting broken up by ""filler episodes"" that added nothing to the series. I fast forwarded most of those-go to a planet;get in trouble/danger; solve the problem (usually with extreme force and violence coupled with pseudo science); go home; YAWN!. The actual storyline of the fight with the Wraith (sp?), the Replicators, and Michael, was quite entertaining. If they had stuck to that I would have given the series 5 stars. Side note- hated Dr. Weir and was relieved to see her go.",1384214400,,704,4.64

I, too, encountered playback problems as reported by many on the very first disk of Season 1.  The read errors occurred on both a modern DVD player and my computer's DVD player.  Even ISOBuster software on my computer encountered read errors when trying to read the disk.

3918090,4,B002EL4RLQ,"The quality is great. I am pleased with my viewing experience.

The only thing I don't like is the fact that there are ""nubs"" that lock into the whole in the middle of the disc. To take out a disc, one must first pull the disc away from the nub and pull the disc out of the sleeve. This runs the risk of sliding the bottom of the disc on the nub and causing damage. Also, each individual season is in its own cardboard sleeve. I don't know how I feel about that. It's nice that if I'm looking for an episode in a particular season I know exactly which sleeve to pull out. On the other hand it also means that there's a lot of loose, moving components inside the box. I liked how they made the Stargate SG-1 sleeves. All ten seasons in two separate sleeves and no nubs, you just slid the disc out. The box looks aesthetically pleasing on the outside. My box however, was bent a little and had a stress seam running down one of the corners.

Despite this, the overall product seems to be working well. I recommend it.",1382486400,,1015,4.173469387755102

The video and sound quality is good however there were a few episodes that had digiblocks randomly messing up scenes which I conclude were a result of a bad dvd copying process.

3918120,3,B002EL4RLQ,"The series is o.k. for Stargate.  Not much logic in what they do in several of the episodes, but that is t.v. programing.  The writing is a little short sighted, the actors can get a little annoying at times.",1375315200,,208,4.3076923076923075

3918122,3,B002EL4RLQ,"Bought this for my wife when it was crazy on sale with a Gold Box - she's a huge fan of the show.  The packing on these is terrible though!  It looks cools, but discs are held in with a rubbery  post that's glued to cardboard that folds in to hold the discs.  Many of the discs weren't even secured to the post when we received them.  None of the discs were scratched or damaged, but I can see that while trying to pop these off and put them back on something could happen.  I had to order new 27mm plastic cases to hold the discs and then find some custom covers to print off to make it look nice on my shelf.",1374710400,,610,3.9186991869918697

Writers did an awesome job of taking disgusting ""bad guys"" and developing many layers of personality within them, even to making some likable.

3918132,5,B002EL4RLQ,"I loved the original stargate series and, when this series first came out, I was on the fence about it. But it really was a good series, and it was getting freaking amazing when they cancelled it (the last couple of episodes up to and including the finale were insane!).

The series was at times funny, adventurous, serious, playful, and surprisingly deep and I miss it sometimes. I do wonder if they knew that some of the things they were doing were hilarious in a rife for mocking sort of way. For instance; Major (then Colonel) Sheppard had a long standing battle with a rival military man from another planet named Kolya and he liked to say, ""Kolya!"" a lot, which made me laugh really hard and mock by saying, ""Khan!"" because, honestly, they had to have known.

I don't know if I have a review, so much as a fangirling, but I wasn't allowed to rate it without writing something. So, I've written something.",1370044800,,910,4.509090909090909

3918140,5,B002EL4RLQ,"I love Stargate Atlantis. I love the original Stargate SG-1 too, of course, but I like SGA for its uniqueness. Great characters who also serve as yummy eye candy, interesting overarching themes and individual stories in each episode. If you like sci-fi, I recommend you give this a go! If you liked SG-1, this is a must-see series. Love having the whole series in one collection (though as another reviewer mentioned, the little sticky dots that the discs are held by in the box are a little annoying).",1367020800,,502,4.715909090909091

3918142,5,B002EL4RLQ,"SGA is second only to SG1 as great science fiction fantasy. Some of the characters are a bit overdrawn (Rodney can be a bit irritating, Tayla and the Marines are sooo serious!) but the story lines are inventive and satisfying and the special effects are good. The concept is the thing with me - imagine exploring a city filled with alien technology beyond imagination! Even the science is at least fair. I thoroughly enjoyed the series!",1366761600,,436,4.75

3918145,5,B002EL4RLQ,"Okay, I am a fan of both SG-1 and Atlantis - a big fan.  I bought the SG-1 Collection a few months ago and am still enjoying it.  Now I have this one as well.  One of the things I wanted was the commentaries.  I love watching an episode and listening to the director and actors talk about how the episode was filmed and produced.  As to the comments about the rubber mount for the disks, just take your time taking a disk out and putting it back in.  Those are definitely not deal breaker kinds of things.  I went and bought sleeves and was all set to put the disks in sleeves.  When the package got here, I saw that it just wasn't the big deal that some of the reviewers were making it out to be.  If you are an Atlantis fan like me, I just have one word for you - ENJOY!!",1366156800,,773,3.935483870967742
3918146,5,B002EL4RLQ,"SGA gets 9.5 out of 10 for the first 3 seasons.  Season 4 (which is where I am at right now) is a little less interesting.  Weir is taken over by Pegasus Replicators and Sam takes control of SGA.  Loved Sam in SG1, not as much in SGA.",1366156800,,234,3.8333333333333335

Great series! When this was on TV, I high such high expectations based on the SG1 series that I was convinced that nothing would ever compare. I have since change that attitude. All the characters provided a good blend of personality and contribution to each episode, and their developments were pleasing as the seasons progressed.

Meh packaging. This certainly doens't go well on my DVD shelving along side other sereies that are stacked the traditional way. The disks are pack by season, but then they are placed broadsided into the case, making the case double wide and not very deep. he individual seasons are very tight within the box, causing them to not sit side-by-side comfortably. Again, there was no damage to the disks, but I typically had to to remove most the seasons to get to the one season that I wanted, due to the way they were packed. Annoying.",1365724800,,1068,4.645502645502646

I couldn't advance past the bad spot which sometimes will work. I have returned this and hope to replace it sometime but a direct replacement wasn't offered when I returned it. I look forward to being able to enjoy this series without the frustration of technical difficulties. Stargate SG-1 played flawlessly so I am hoping the next time I get this, it will too.",1364947200,2,529,4.408163265306122
3918149,2,B002EL4RLQ,There mission is boring by comparison to the mission of the orginal stargate series.  The characters are not startdem or just a little to real.  Boring mission and no action.  It's not what I was looking but it was my mistake in looking for these in a stargate title atlantis.  I overlooked the secluded setting of the show.  I can't say it's bad show because its just not what I was looking for.  Those with apreciation for the setting may say otherwise.,1364169600,,455,4.487804878048781

1. That packaging could have been better to protect for longevity...I don think the cardboard sleeves are going to last all that long,

2. This is probably getting petty, but as s series box set I expected all the menus to work the same.  for instance season 1, if you forward to the next chapter at the opening credits it takes you to the end of the episode, but seasons 2-5 don't have that problem.  and the menus look and work differently",1363996800,2,588,4.3577981651376145

The packaging and storage for the disks is very efficient and creative, however; there is a problem with the backing to where the disk go. There is a small paper slot with a plastic piece to prevent sliding.

This is a really great TV show with lots of wonderful characters and stories. I'm really glad we have the complete set.

*HOWEVER*, the actual production of the disks and packaging is shockingly poor. We had to exchange 3 different sets and go through two different sellers (one Amazon, one 3rd-party) to get a complete set in which the packaging wasn't significantly damaged and the disks would actually work (some had programming errors that prevented episodes from playing, some were cracked and un-playable, etc.). Amazon ultimately worked with us to make it right but it took a few months and a lot of patience.

To this day I still don't understand why it was cancelled prematurely when Stargate Sg1 had been given ten years with sho and the sci-fi channel.

It's definitely worth the money. I've now watched the series start to finish twice; and I'm going back and re-watching my favorite episodes.

Now for the packaging....when I rated this product, I rated the dvd series. I did not rate it for packaging. If i would it would be a 2/5 maybe. It really isn't the greatest packaging.

I read some reviews before buying. yes the packaging sucks, but i took some advice and peeled of the foam knobs and put tape on them so as not to scratch the discs further. anyways to get to the point of this review. Most if not all people said they got read errors on more than one of the discs. to repair this all you need is a CD doctor kit. if you don't want to spend the money on a kit you may use EXPO dry erase board cleaner OR lens cleaner for glasses. spray the CD with either and let it sit for a minute. then take a soft cloth and wipe gently. wait for it to dry completely before using the CD. this DOES NOT make the scratches disappear but it does fix the problem. its better than sending the set back 3 or 4 times to get a complete set without errors.this set gets 3 stars for being a great show and as someone who has not yet stepped up to Blu Ray, I'd rather have this complete set than the individual seasons.

Do not get me wrong, I am a very big Stargate Atlantis and Stargate SG-1 fan, but this is review of the product and not of the series.

I made the mistake of purchasing this product along with the similarly made and packaged Complet Stargate SG-1 Collection.  Both were severely disappointing.  Before purchasing either I had read many reviews on them both and decided the price was worth the risk.  I was wrong.  Many of the reviews I read complained about the packaging but said nothing about the manufacturing of the disks themselves.  When I purchased them I also purchased cases to transfer them into in order to avoid the packaging problem.  Unfortunately the real problem is with the poor manufacturing of the disks themselves.  On inspection no less than 1 out of 5 disks was pitted or whorled, both of which are manufacturing defects that can render a disk unreadable, and both of which disk cleaning or resurfacing will not address.  Fortunately Amazon was willing to take both back and give me a refund.  But it was still a cause of stress and frustration, and I now I have 100 cases that have no purpose.

I would very strongly advise against purchasing either.  If you want the series, be willing to pay more for a properly manufactured and packaged collection.",1302566400,15,1420,4.67741935483871

In both, there are a total of 3 episodes that have distortions- clearly a technical problem...thus why I didn't penalize the product with less than five stars.  It was probably one in a million that my dvd set has this problem.  I will likely return it for another from Amazon.

Only one unreadable out of the whole set, which isn't as bad as I was expecting (my SG-1 experience showed about a 25% defect rate).  Still, there's no excuse for them selling products in this condition.

To make matters worse, Amazon seems to think that shipping a cardboard DVD set in a book mailer is acceptable packaging.  The problem is that book mailers are designed for---you guessed it---books.  Things that are HARD.  Things that inherently cannot be crushed.  Book mailers have soft, curved sides on all four sides so that they can accommodate books of varying sizes and shapes, and they depend on the book to provide the structural integrity.

What happens when you pack a box of DVDs in such packaging, you ask?  The first one arrived badly crushed.  I complained about it and asked for a replacement.  They shipped the replacement in the SAME INADEQUATE PACKAGING.  It, too, arrived crushed.  I'm trying to work through the process to get a proper replacement shipped in something that actually qualifies as a cardboard box, but until Amazon fixes their packaging, I would strongly advise people to NOT buy this product from Amazon.",1287014400,18,1251,4.839622641509434

3918254,5,B002EL4RLQ,"Upon getting this series to add to my growing collection of movies I wanted to know what the Total Run Time was for the STARGATE Atlantis: The Complete Series Collection and here is what I found:

STARGATE Atlantis: Season 2 -- 14 hrs 32 min 01 sec
STARGATE Atlantis: Season 3 -- 14 hrs 31 min 21 sec

Grand Total Run Time: 4,491 min 32 sec OR 3 days 2 hrs 51 min 32 sec.

I checked all 26 discs over 2 days, which I recorded in my personal movie collection records, and I thought I would share with others out there wanting to know.

Overall the series was great to watch again.  However, one side note to the series that I would have like to have seen, is that Dr. Rodney McKay could have shown off what he does in the Series Finale to all the scientists who critized him at the Kramer Conference, which is about the 3rd or 4th Episode from the Series Finale.",1279756800,,1070,4.052132701421801
3918255,1,B002EL4RLQ,"First off, let me say I love Stargate (all versions) and am not rating the quality of the program. I am rating the quality of this dvd set. And it is HORRIBLE. MANY of my discs did not play properly. At first I thought that it was simply my computer's software, so I tried other programs. Then I tried other computers. I even put the discs into different stand alone DVD players. The same problems happened everywhere. From the start, when the DVDs were burned at their factory, they must have made mistakes because when I looked at the bottom of the DVDs, there were no scratches or irregularities. The dvds would stop playing in certain spots, and the menus would not function properly.

As far as packaging, it was TERRIBLE. When you buy complete series sets, you expect a level of quick, cheap packaging, and you have to know that they are not going to encase every DVD in its own jewel case or wrapping; that's fine as far as I'm concerned. But with these Atlantis sets, I'm shocked at how foolishly they were packed. The main issue is that in every cardboard DVD slit (where you slide the disc into to hold it) they placed a rubber like knob for extra sturdiness. The attempt, I'm assuming, is to fit perfectly into the hole at the center of the DVD so that the disc is safe. The EXACT OPPOSITE occurs. When they place the DVDs into the rubber holes, they scratched MANY of the DVDs. When you attempt to remove the disc from the rubber holder, YOU scratch the DVD on accident. If you're lucky enough not to scratch the DVD (a technique I had to figure out after three seasons), you almost always are faced with rubber residue from the rubber knobs that gets stuck on the DVD. If you don't wipe it off, the dvd plays even more erratically. So when wiping, BE CAREFUL. Use a soft cloth, because if you don't, you'll scratch the disc. I ended up ripping off the rubber holder in every box to avoid having these problems in case I ever want to watch the discs again. If you decide to do this, make sure to put some smooth scotch tape over the area where you rip, because when you rip off the rubber knob, the tear of the cardboard will also scratch your disc when you return it to the slit. By putting the piece of scotch tape over the rip, you'll make it nice and smooth for the dvd to rest.

I thought purchasing directly from amazon.com as the seller would be a safe bet, but it was NOT. To summarize:

-Discs are burned improperly - even if you find no scratches on the bottom of the discs, they do not play correctly, regardless of how many players (both computers and stand alone dvd players) you use

-Most discs come scratched

-The packaging is EXTREMELY POOR and ruins the discs further

I recommend everyone to read ALL reviews on this product. You'll find that even the positive reviews talk about the same issues I mentioned. When I first read them, I thought ""this will never happen to me."" But it DID! (I read that someone else wrote the exact same thing, but still, I thought 'this will never happen to me.'). In any case, I recommend buying the separate DVD sets season by season from some place like Best Buy. They are considerably more expensive, but honestly, it's your only real choice. If you buy these DVDs, you'll never even get to watch them. I read another's review, and he said that he sent his dvd set back to amazon countless times, only to find the same problems with EVERY set he received. After returning 5 times, he finally mixed and matched enough to get a working set. That's just plain ridiculous. I'm very disappointed with this and will probably never buy directly from amazon again. Good luck with your purchase, and I really do recommend buying this series, just not this set. It's a very entertaining show.",1277078400,52,3749,4.441860465116279

The disks are all number differently as if they were thrown together from a bunch of different versions of the set. Season one disks have some weird numbering like season 1 volume 3 disk 1 and that carries on until your get to season 3 or 4 when it becomes season 3 disk 1. That's not too bad either, but that's not all. The worst part is that these disks lock up. I play mine in my xbox 360 and about 10 times for each show during the first 4 seasons it will lock up and say attempting to read media. I went as far as to try the disks on my dvd player and they wouldn't play at all. After reading other reviews, it turns out I'm not the only one!

Please understand, my rating is for the product, not the show, as SGA is one of the greatest sci-fi shows of all time! This box set, however, is awful, at best!

1) The packaging - I'm not sure what drunken 2nd grader thought it would be a good idea to put the seasons in a large box that would not hold them in place in any way.  They are free to slide from one side of the box to the other... Not good when you're trying to protect DVDs.  Then there's the individual season packaging.  This gives a new definition to ""WTF!?"" since they are not held in place by the little pieces of plastic which has been used since the beginning of CDs... No, those are replaced with some weird piece of plastic which ensures that once the disc has been taken out of the package, it will NEVER go back in place!

2) The DVDs - I'm taking an educated guess that the plant that made the DVDs is either: a) A place where they play a lot of football using the discs as the ball; b) Every piece of equipment they have in the plant is lined with steel wool.  Why? Because more of the discs that I received were scratched than the discs I received which were not scratched.  Sorry, but this is a little maddening when you're in the middle of a great episode only to have it skip!

I thought about sending it back and getting a replacement, but I realized something: The people writing these reviews were right, therefore I could play a sick game of Send & Receive with Amazon for months... So I just decided to go to Best Buy and get the seasons individually.

When the set arrived, I immediately examined each of the discs for scratches, fingerprints, etc. The first disc was scratched but played okay. I found fingerprints on many of the discs, but I was able to clean them off easily. I realize that you shouldn't have to do this with new discs... but what can you do?

I have watched slightly less than one-half of the set and, so far, everything has been okay (keeping my fingers crossed!). What some people said about how the discs are held in the cases (i.e., the rubber knobs) is correct. The discs are hard to remove and even harder to reinsert.

3918274,4,B002EL4RLQ,"Excellent series.  After the first season the show really takes off.

The packaging is the worst that I have every seen.  I thought that Stargate SG-1 packaging was poor, but Atlantis is much worse. The DVD's are inserted into cardboard sleeves and have a hunk of rubber inserted into their center hole to keep them in place.  Good luck getting the rubber piece back into the hole after you remove the DVD.  The rubber expands after the DVD is removed.  The rubber is also not tapered. It is easier to get a cork back into a wine bottle.

The DVD's have not been changed for the series box set, so the menus and special features are the same. The menus on the first season are poor with a useless play button that plays a ship flying across the screen and then going back to the menu.  The second season improves a little by adding a 'play all' button, but when you hit the next button during the opening credits, it not only skips the credits, but also the first set of scenes. I have not gotten to season three yet, but hopefully things will get better.

One DVD was unplayable on one of my players, but my other player was able to play it.  There is also a momentary freeze between some scenes.

I mean StarGate SG-1 went for 'ages' well past it's ""use by"" date, when they simply lost track of the main story, completed it - and then began to throw new 'stupid' things into the mix.

The show is a wonderful, exciting product that needs to be respected by MGM.
I ordered this set - EVERY SINGLE DISC WAS SCRATCHED!
The packaging while colorful and interesting, does not protect the discs.
The weird gel disc holder / tray combination does not allow the discs to be held securely.
The bonus disc that is exclusive to this set was neat, it had the broadcast and extended versions of Ep 99: Vegas and Ep 100: Enemy at the Gate as well as two exclusive featurettes.

This is the problem of the recording and manufacturer's, and I was glad to read that Amazon made a note to try and have this problem corrected.  So, for any of you who read these reviews and think to go to an outside vendor, the same problem will exist.  I had already gotten season 1 from Amazon and was very happy with it and I just couldn't wait to watch all the others, and on mistake, while surfing the net, found the whole set cheaper and ordered it.  I do hope this problem gets fixed soon, it's a great show.  I'll be getting it per season now, since the boxed set isn't up to snuff.

3918279,1,B002EL4RLQ,"I bought the Full season set for Stargate SG1 awhile back, and I thought whoever handled quality control for that set was dumb. There were scratches, read errors, etc on the discs. I returned it to amazon and got a better set and read error checked all 54 some discs in the set just like I did with atlantis.

Now it seems MGM fired dumb and hired dumber for the Quality control for Stargate Atlantis. Knowing the horrors I faced with the SG1 set, I made sure and checked every disc as soon as possible.
How do I check discs - I play about a minute or so throughout the disc using media player homecinema just to get past the copy protection enough so I get an accurate read error check. I then do a file copy from disc to my hard drive to see if any read errors occur, and then I use nero's discspeed utility to run a scandisc for read errors. If I get errors I will locate which chapters and section it's at and play them back on standalone dvd player. It's time consuming, but I hate having flawed sets.

On my first set, all of season 1, 3, 5 and the bonus disc had read errors and scratches. Seasons 2 and 4 had no read errors and they played back fine. I filed for a replacement, they shipped a replacement, and I swapped discs to get a set that was as flawless as I can get it.. After swapping around, all of season 3, 4 discs on season 5 and the bonus disc had read errors on both sets and they skip and screw up on my standalone.

This is horrible - the quality control at MGM is far worse now than it was for SG1. on my original SG1 set - there were scratches, but the only read errors was on bonus disc1 and 3 discs on season 4. Our of 54 dvds, 50 had no read errors and played back fine. 10 of the discs in that set had scratches, but no read errors on them. I got a return on amazon, swapped out 14 discs and was good. 14/54 is about 26% bad discs.

For stargate atlantis - 16 discs out of 26 discs bad. That's a 62% failure rate. That's actually higher than the xbox 360's red ring fail rate at around 54%.
After swapping around and returns, I have 10 bad discs out of 26, that's 38% fail. I have to do one more return to get 0% fail. I hope amazon is ok with me doing a third return.. I really don't want to get the credit card company involved...",1259366400,16,2262,4.008869179600887

3918283,4,B002EL4RLQ,"Despite considering myself a bit of a science fiction connoisseur, I was a very unlikely candidate for Stargate Atlantis fandom.  How come? Well for starters I could only go as far as labeling the 1994 feature film Stargate, the one that started it all, as merely an average effort.  I went to the theater opening week, owned the VHS then DVD incarnation but there was never any real danger of it dethroning such classics as my Star Trek collections.  Then there was SG-1, which I considered entertaining enough whenever there wasn't anything better on the tube.  It carried on with many of the finer moments of the film, perhaps going as far as improving upon several of them.  While it was solid enough for broadcast television, I fear a lack of connection with the characters made it not quite compelling enough to warrant purchase of the colossal 10-season & multiple-movie dvd releases.

Enter Stargate Atlantis, a spinoff of a spinoff and at five seasons, precisely half the size of SG-1.  Somehow I was able to avoid catching a single episode in its wildly successful broadcast history and hadn't even really considered buying the Complete Collection on DVD except for the simple fact that with every scifi DVD purchase I made of late (Star Trek Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Enterprise, Farscape, Battlestar Galactica Complete Collection and so on), this collection was recommended.  And so without so much as a single episode to draw from, took a gamble and purchased the Stargate Atlantis: The Complete Series Collection.

First the facts: This set contains all five complete seasons (100 episodes) of the show spread across 26 discs with a 27th disc full of bonus material (which in this case contains two new featurettes: Mission 100: Stargate Reaches a Milestone & Stargate Atlantis: A Retrospective). It should also be noted that all of the extras from the original season releases are retained here.  The region 1 release is presented in widescreen format with the default language being English as was the case with the broadcast version.  Additional language options are available in the form of subtitled text.

The story goes something like this: set in present-day, a military team from Earth led by John Shepard (Air Force Major then Colonel later on), along with two dozen other teams from various nations, venture to the lost city of Atlantis in the distant Pegasus Galaxy.

They use the title-inspired device known as a Stargate to make the trip, which just so happens to be located in an abandoned ""Ancient"" outpost in Antarctica.  Atlantis, it turns out, exists underwater on an aquatic planet labeled ""Lantea"". The technologically advanced city was built tens of thousands of years prior by one of the most advanced races of the Stargate universe: the Ancients.

After a plague in the Milky Way Galaxy some ten thousand years ago, the Ancients were forced to set up shop in the Pegasus Galaxy with Atlantis operating as their home base of operations.  There they populated life on countless worlds just as they had done in the Milky Way.  Things were going great until a threat known as the Wraith awoken and stopped the poor Ancients in their proverbial tracks with a brutal war that lasted some hundred years and ended with the Ancients getting their butts handed to them and ultimately having to submerge their central base of Atlantis beneath Lantea's ocean to hide it from their brutal adversary.

After ten thousand years of dormancy, the city of Atlantis is reactivated due to the aforementioned visit by Shepard and company.  The tale links seamlessly with the SG-1 thread that introduced it back in Season 7 and the flow is such where even the most fair-weathered viewer of SG-1 (ahem, me) can pick it up and follow along.

As is often case even in the most revered of science fiction franchises, the first two seasons struggle to find their rhythm.  The case of earthlings immediately expands to include several humans from Pegasus Galaxy worlds that were reached through Gate jumps.  It also doesn't take long for the Wraith, which have been in a state of hibernation, to become awakened by this sudden increase in activity. No pushovers, these Wraith, as the crew quickly discovers.  Looking a bit like a veiny vampires with long wispy white hair and a penchant for leather, these creatures feed by literarily sucking the life force from human prey through a slit in the palm of their hands.  Borrowing a bit from the ALIEN franchise, they live in hives led by a single queen.  However, and not to give any spoilers, the Wraith are certainly more intelligent in this comparison and, as revealed in the later seasons, not entirely the evil feeding machines as initially perceived.

Yes there is quite a bit of cool technology scattered about but unlike the mechanical bits of say Star Wars or Star Trek, much of the spacecraft, weaponry and locales of Atlantis have a decidedly organic slant to them thanks in no small part to having been designed by the very same Ancients who brought us the Stargate.

The crew spends a lot of time exploring neighboring worlds throughout the course of the program (""offworld"" as it is known here) but be forewarned that every single one of them is identical to earth.  Now before you get bent out of shape by saying obviously, since earth is where the show is made, I'm not talking about the deserts of Dune, swamps of Dagobah, or icy tundra of Hoth here.  I'm talking every environment is basically a forest with a sun, a village, breathable air, lakes, clouds  and so on.  The logic here is that since the Ancients populated these worlds initially (presumably as they did with earth), the environments would have to be similar to sustain life.  Fair enough but they certainly could have pushed the boundaries a bit here with foliage, native creatures, cultures and so on.  Perhaps some CG to create a different colored skyline or an earth-like atmosphere where the inhabitants live in floating pods.  You know- typical scifi gags.

As it stands, however, most offworld voyages are basically Middle Ages earth visits with water wheels, windmills, and some incredibly well endowed native women.  The space scenes on the other hand are generally very well done with high budget CGI, great sound effects, and plausible physics.

The show's not without some cast discrepancies as well.  Some characters you'll spend dozens of episodes getting to know die off without warning while others still die, come back to life, die again and so on.  It becomes a bit wearisome later on once the whole concept of death not being final sinks in.  Worse still, there are far too many cheap threads that do little more than serve to allow the cast members from SG-1 a chance to make a cameo appearance.  While I'm sure fans of SG-1 were delighted, it does kind of make the viewer feel like the show's development didn't have complete faith in their new cast's ability to draw ratings.

The show's format isn't entirely linear in its progression either.  The early shows followed a system where our heroes went offworld, encountered a problem, solved it, then returned to Atlantis all within the 48- minute runtime.  The third and fourth season shifted to massive story threads with ongoing battles of epic proportions.  In my opinion these larger threads (against the Wraith, Replicators, Genii and so on) represent the show's greatest moments and I was quite surprised (disappointed) to discover that the 5th and final season went back to the beginning format with basically a bunch of self-contained episodes.

The show's conclusion, though satisfying, does instill a feeling of unfinished business in several near-forgotten story threads throughout the show's run.  Of course by this point in time it was pretty well known that the creative forces behind Atlantis (& SG-1) had been commissioned to work on an all new incarnation of the franchise, Stargate Universe.

While I certainly felt that the characters were a step-up from SG-1, the show's biggest fault lies in its conservatism.  Like the environments of the worlds, we're basically given a hodge-podge of humans (either military or scientist) to follow along with.  Though there are a few cool races out there (the Asguard, Wraith, Replicators), these are all few and far between compared to the incessant sniveling of guys like Dr. McKay and Beckett.

In all the show does entertain, which I suppose is the aim of any fictional property.  There are a few too many annoyances to consider it top tier science fiction but it certainly, in my opinion, manages to continue to improve upon the tradition started back in the early 1990's.  Amazon is selling The Complete Collection for $92.99 (free shipping) these days (down from $233.99 last week), making the set a literal steal when compared to the price of some of the other shows I mentioned above (Complete Star Trek TNG or Battlestar Galactica to mention a few).  In that line of thinking, it's money well spent and the perfect means of eating up many a cold, dark winter's night.",1257292800,5,9055,4.89908256880734
3918284,2,B002EL4RLQ,"I had already seen most of the TV series, it's great, no complains on it. I'm a huge SG fan and have the full 10 season SG-1 set as well, in addition to the DVD release movies.

The disks are in bad shape, I noticed scratches on some but they played fine. Got to 3rd disk, and it had defects so bad it was unwatchable. I'm in the process of sending it back now, hope my replacement is in better shape but I don't have my hopes up.

Packaging looks nice, but as others mentioned it's not handy for using the disks, the gel center holders make it hard to get the disks in and out.

I'll edit in any further issues I come across, hopefully the replacement will be better. Quality control utterly failed somewhere in the manufacturing process of these disks. I heard similar complains about my SG-1 disk set, but the one I got was fine, maybe eventually I will get a second run of sets with better quality standards eventually.

EDIT: Got replacement set, these don't appear to be as bad as the others, but still some scratches. 1st Season seems to be the worst, however I have not found a disk that does not play well yet.",1256083200,136,1119,4.264150943396227
3918285,2,B002EL4RLQ,"EDIT: This review is for the DVD version of this set only, NOT the Bluray version.  I've heard that the Bluray version is much better.

Before I begin I would like to point out that this review and star rating is for this set and its packaging ONLY.  The show itself is great and would get a 7 out of 5 stars from me, but before your mouth starts watering over the ""Collector's Edition"", hear me out.

Pros: The outside package and photos used are nice and add something you wouldn't get by buying the seasons individually.  The episodes ""Vegas"" and ""Enemy at the Gate"" come in both the extended versions and broadcast versions.  There is a bonus disc that has two featurettes that come only with this Complete Series set.

Cons:  Where do I begin?  I was appalled to find some of the discs were scratched and has smudges on them (most notably the season one discs and the bonus disc).  One disc had errors, even though there were no apparent scratches on it.  The 26 disc are divided up into seasons, and those individual seasons are housed in thick glossy paper with slits in it for the discs.  The discs are supposed to be held in by rubber knobs... it was very hard to get the discs onto these knobs, and when you pulled a disc off of one, sometimes little pieces of the knob would come off with it and the knob would often smudge the disc.  The Season One folder would ALWAYS catch on a tab just inside the packaging when you pull out the ""drawer"" to get a disc (a way around this is to lay down the season one folder on it's side; the rest can stay upright).

Although this isn't really a pro or con, I was a little disappointed that they reused the discs put into the individual season sets.  The discs still mention the volume numbers, which don't apply in the complete set; this is confusing to some.  I thought they (the people who designed this) would take more pride in their product than they apparently did.

So, to summarize, Stargate Atlantis is a great show that everyone should see and consider investing into all five seasons... but you'll need to be a very patient and sympathetic person to be satisfied with this set.

P.S. - This isn't an isolated incident... I put in an order for an exchange and the new set had almost identical problems.  (It should be noted that, as of yet, Amazon has been good to work with.)",1255824000,319,2336,4.378190255220417
3918286,2,B002EL4RLQ,"So I like the series, and I'm enjoying it right now.  The problem I have was with the packaging.  If you bought the complete SG-1 series, it came in two large foldout cases of something to the effect of glossy cardboard.  Roughly 3 of the disks were damaged and some episodes wouldn't play.  You can see a lot of message boards talking of similar problems.
The Atlantis set takes the poor planning a step further.  It is broken up by season, but uses the same glossy paper, and now a hard gel-ish holder for the middle of the disc which is both unnecessary and annoying.  I don't know if any of the discs are damaged yet, but if I leave them in the current case, they likely will become as such soon.

Save yourself A LOT of headache and buy a CD/DVD case at the same time.",1255564800,156,773,4.217687074829932
3918287,4,B002EL4RLQ,"Looking at the set, I'm rather disappointed that everything is marked with the Milky Way gate chevrons instead of either the Pegasus ones, or the Pegasus chevron logo seen on the show. To me, it seems like an emphasis on being a spin-off instead of crediting as its own show.

The first review I read is pretty good, btw, but I disagree about Sheppard being like O'Neill. Some of the lines might be similar, but the delivery is a totally different thing. Especially since the character actually has an extremely high intelligence, where O'Neill was pretty average in that area.  Sheppard's role was very different, and it played that way. Me, wanting to separate Atlantis form SG-1, and here I am comparing the two lead characters. :)

Well, The 4th season was shaky, but as a whole, the series is fantastic. Even though I already own the seasons separately, I intend to buy this set soon.

BTW, the commentaries on these discs are exceptional. They really went out of their way to give viewers something for every episode. Almost all of them were entertaining or informative or both. I like that in a commentary.",1255478400,,1113,4.721649484536083

It certainly was worth the price. Just to have all five seasons of Stargate Atlantis plus a Bonus disc, 26 discs, of Joe Flanigan, is sheer heaven!!! Discs are safely tucked into sleeves. Maybe the studio that owns this series, will re-package the original Stargate SG-1 this way, instead of the ridiculous one they sold. Let's hope. Anyway, this Atlantis is a 5-star Winner!!!",1255046400,,595,4.96
3918289,4,B002EL4RLQ,"As currently priced, this is an excellent way to obtain all five seasons of STARGATE ATLANTIS relatively easily and at a reasonable price.  The show itself is an interesting spin off of STARGATE SG-1.  The show deals with the discovery of a means to travel to the distant far end of the universe to a city built by the Ancients, the city of Atlantis.  Over the course of five seasons they explore this part of the universe, encountering various new races, especially that of the Wraith, vampire like creatures that suck the essence of life out of their victims.  The struggle between the humans and the wraith constitutes the central conflict of STARGATE ATLANTIS.

As nice as the central concepts in the creation of STARGATE ATLANTIS, the show was from the beginning plagued by a number of problems.  Chief and foremost, the show suffered from serious casting problems.  Joe Flanigan was excellent in the lead role as Col. Sheppard, but there were problems with nearly every other role.  For instance, Davide Hewlett was excellent as Dr. Rodney McKay, but even a little bit of Rodney went a long way, but in the series we almost always got huge amounts of him.  Torri Higginson was, however, never very effective as Atlantis head Elizabeth Weir and certainly was never very convincing as the head of such a project (though I was predisposed to like her because she bore an amazing resemblance to an ex-girlfriend of mine).  Rachel Luttrell as local alien Teyla was likable enough, but as an actress her goal seemed to be to communicate as little emotion as possible.  In Season One Rainbow Francks was ineffective as the uninteresting and poorly conceived Lt. Ford, and his replacement in Season Two, Jason Momoa's Ronon Dex, has to go down as one of the dullest characters in the history of TV, with an emotional range even smaller than that of Teyla's.  To top things off, the show killed off (well, kinda) one of the truly interesting characters on the show, Paul McGillion's Dr. Beckett.  In Seasons Four and Five Amanda Tapping and Robert Picardo tried to step in and fill some of the slack, but it was a tad too little too late.  The one person who did add enormously to the show during its final seasons was Christopher Heyerdahl.  Now, he was an important contributor to the show from the very beginning, being for a long while the only person to play a Wraith.  Eventually, however, he began to play more and more a particular wraith, who our feckless heroes referred to as Todd.  As a Wraith who found ways to cooperate with the humans, he emerged as far and away one of the most interesting characters on the show.  Still, they never managed to get the cast right.

The other really big problem on the show was that there was very close to no character development.  Despite feints that various characters might be developing some interiority that could lead to some genuine growth, pretty much all the characters on the show stayed the same from their first introduction until the end.  The problem on ATLANTIS was not as bad as on SG-1, but it was still a pretty crippling problem.  It meant that whatever happened on the show was largely limited to the larger plot and not to the characters themselves.  Contrast this with BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER or BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, where the primary focus was always on the characters.  This is all connected with another serious problem with the series, one almost certainly caused by the network.  Namely, ATLANTIS is far too focused on stand alone episodes.  Networks always adore standalone episodes.  Their thinking is that people unfamiliar with a show will be more likely to jump in and try a series if they are not required to know very much about what has gone on before.  Networks yearn for the days of the sixties and seventies, when it made little difference to the viewer whether they were watching the first or the hundredth episode of a show.  One could jump in anywhere.  Fans of shows, however, tend to prefer serial formats to episodic formats.  On DVD the difference between episodic versus serial formats is incredibly stark.  Serial series on DVD can be incredibly exciting, coming across more like epic movies than mere TV shows; episodic TV series on DVD simply seem like TV shows with better resolution.

Still, STARGATE ATLANTIS, though ultimately something of a disappointment, a lot of great moments.  The Wraiths are great.  Some of the epic battle sequences, especially the ones that end seasons, are especially impressive.  And some of the individual episodes are very fine.  The show never fulfilled its potential, but that doesn't mean it didn't manage to produce some very nice moments.",1254614400,,4675,4.79875
3918290,5,B002EL4RLQ,"This is not a review, per se, but more of a comment on realizing that TPTB can and will do anything to get us to buy, buy, buy.

THANKFULLY, I bought the first four seasons when they were on a really good sale with AMAZON, then bought Season Five from EBAY. Actually, bought it a bit TOO EARLY, as the price went down within two weeks.

SOME DAY I will learn to WAIT until a SCI FI series is over - for a year! - before buying the darn set! To think I spent near $1K for ST:TNG when came out each month MANY, MANY years ago... and now can buy it HERE for less than $300????  Oh, that just hurts, way too much.

As for the show of ATLANTIS:  I love it! Much more than SG:1, actually, as I got a bit tired of O'Neil and his sarcasm - way over the top, and after 10 years..well, it was a bit too much. Yes, was great to see them explore and find new civilizations - hey, I grew up on ST:TOS!

For me, though, the characters on SG: ATLANTIS were more developed, the predicements (sp?) they found themselves in far more adventuresome, and I TREMENDOUSLY liked the number of ""aliens"" they had as main characters or returning characters in the five seasons.

With the introduction of the WRAITHS, the show took on an entire new territory - one where, yes, these beings WERE incredibly scary, but also, that is what they were, not their fault. LOVED the returning character Wraith who ends up sort-of being a ""good guy"" in many ways, tho always with a touch of, ""hhhmm, do you really think I'm not looking at you as FOOD?"" in his voice and mannerisms. GREAT ACTOR!

All in all, I am extremely pleased with the five seasons, would have liked THIS to go on longer, but SG:1 I think made ATLANTIS burn out more quickly. In terms of the money factor, I think the cost of this COMPLETE SERIES will go down, don't buy right away - look at how much BSG has gone down since first came out just last month! (another series I spent WAY TOO much on without WAITING for it to end, and now need to spend outrageous money for the last 10 episodes - aarrghh!). And the packaging looks SUPER KEWL for BSG, tho don't know how it holds up in real life (flimsy or good? haven't read reviews, too ticked off about the money I spent already).

I don't know if that happens a lot, or would happen to yours. just wanted to make sure you were aware before going through them",1504569600,,519,4.242424242424242
8367842,1,B002EL4RLQ,Just started watching the series.  So far the first season has had one DVD that freezes and resets it to the begin.  So we never saw a couple episodes on it. Just started the second series and already the same thing has happened again. The frustration of not knowing how episodes end and how they tie in with the series.  I really question the quality of the DVD's used for this series.  Frustrated and disappointed. Wouldn't recommend to others.,1503360000,,446,4.6075949367088604
