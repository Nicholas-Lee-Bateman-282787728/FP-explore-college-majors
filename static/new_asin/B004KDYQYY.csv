4396860,4,B004KDYQYY,"Another great Luke Perry western to watch on those ""Western Movie Weekends."" I thought it ironic that the punishment for the ""Alcoholic Lawyer"" was the Governor making him Circuit Judge over the territory that so haunted him from childhood to now. Awesome!",1348099200,,256,5.119047619047619
4396861,4,B004KDYQYY,My husband and I enjoyed this movie. My husband only likes westerns and it's hard to find something he hasn't seen. Luke Perry saved the day.,1320105600,3,141,4.461538461538462
4396862,4,B004KDYQYY,"I watched this film with trepidation, as it appeared Charles Goodnight's life was to be reinvented, making him a hard-fightin' crusader for justice. (Goodnight's name has been whitewashed over the years. He was actually a agro-capitalist murderer.)

Turns out the film's principal character is fictional, one John William Goodnight, a hard-drinking lawyer. The story gets off to a bad start, portraying him as an amusing-and-not-very-serious roughneck. This is corrected as we learn his Batman-ish backstory, and he's made a circuit judge serving the area where his parents were murdered, in the hope he'll not only dispense tough justice, but exorcise his demons.

Not surprisingly, the story comprises mostly clichs, especially the one of projecting 20th-century liberal values on 19th-century characters. But the sober, believable dialog, and everyone's (including the director's) underplaying largely suppresses the ""I've seen this a hundred times before"" reaction. The slight twist at the end isn't much of a surprise, but the murderer's motivations are unexpected and surprisingly cruel -- decidedly John Meston-ish.

Given that Luke Perry is credited with creating the character, and the story's lack of a conventional romantic resolution, it would seem Mr Perry has a series of films in mind. (A check of IMDb indicates two more films are ""in the hopper"".) Perry is not only a competent actor, but he's appealing dressed -- and even more appealing dis-habille. The visual clich of the nude man in the wash basin is trotted out, with Perry pushing it to the limit of acceptability for a film children might see. Nevertheless, this is a PG-13 film not suitable for pre-teens (despite some reviewers calling it a ""family"" film).

""Goodnight for Justice"" is light entertainment, but well-done. That's why I'm giving it a positive, four-star review.",1312588800,12,1852,5.375862068965517
4396863,3,B004KDYQYY,"I really don't like to read the synopsis of books or movies before I read the book or watch the movie. I do want a little snippet, to see if it's something I'd be interested in, but not much more. I find that the synopsis takes my just about halfway through the book, and it tends to tell me too much of the storyline. So I'm glad I didn't know what to expect when I watched this movie.

This was a decent movie. I didn't think the acting was great. I was actually pretty mediocre. Because I don't watch much television or see many movies, I can't compare the movie or the acting to a better movie or better actors, but the acting just wasn't what I expected it to be. However, the way the story played out, it kept my attention from the moment the movie started, all the way to the end. I appreciated that the movie attempted to be accurate with race relations and how things worked in the west back when it was still pretty lawless.

Reviewed for Arms of a Sister",1303948800,7,965,4.182795698924731
4396864,3,B004KDYQYY,"How long can you wait for justice?  After being appointed Circut Judge, John Goodnight (Perry) travels the territory dispensing justice.  After returning to a town that brings back memories of his parents murders, he sees someone who looks familiar.  After seeing the last two TV westerns (Doc West & Triggerman) I was not expecting much from this one.  Although this was nowhere near the caliber of ""Tombstone"" or ""Open Range"", this was actually a pretty good western.  It is pretty cheesy in some parts and the acting is lacking, but it will keep you entertained and watching.  Unlike the ""Doc West"" series this one will hold your attention and you won't forget what you are watching as you are watching it.  The quality of westerns lately has dropped off a lot, this one stands above many of the new ones.  Not great, but much better then the latest offerings.  I give it a B-.

Would I watch again? - I don't think I would.",1302220800,11,927,4.597560975609756

4396920,2,B004KDYQYY,"This is a watered-down, TV type western that is just so mediocre.

When I read that Luke Perry had an idea to do westerns, I thought it would be great.

Anyway, it is a SHAME that you can't rent it for two dollars, because that is about what it is worth.

I bought this for $8 and Quick and the Dead for $5 and guess which is a MUCH better western?

4396921,5,B004KDYQYY,The actors used to portray the characters in this movie are the best. I love movies that tell stories about what it was like living in the  time of the old west 1840-1900.  This movie is the best so far as to show what it must have really been like. There are also some humour written in sections of the movie. Luke Perry is excellent acting as Judge John Goodnight. I have fallen in love with him all over again. Jason Priestley did a wonderful job of directing the movie. I have the other two movies that followed this one portraying Justice John Goodnight and they are also extremely good.  I would recommend Goodnight for Justice movies to anyone who would love to see how law and order was dealt with by a circuit court judge in the lawless old west Wyoming territory.,1383609600,2,773,4.391608391608392
4396922,4,B004KDYQYY,"Luke Perry has a thing for westerns. His first western-themed picture--8 seconds (1994) was a flop though. The accent and the concept were 'off' who he was even in real life. He did not know how to play the script

Obviously not one to give up, Luke was undeterred. He read for a western which he could convincingly portray, and partnered with a  long-time friend (who apparently knew how his mind worked). for directing.

John Goodnight grew up to be a lawyer after having seen his parents murdered when he is a little boy. Becoming burnt out and disillusioned, he gets appointed a circuit judge. This surprise career change reinvigorates him--and sends him on all sorts of adventures around in frontier Wyoming.

In addition to property cases and martial disputes, the judge deals with more serious issues of race and sexuality. I'm certain this scripting is is 'modern'. Yes, the African Americans sit (like in ""To Kill a Mockingbird"") in the balcony. The young man is visibly shocked that Goodnight shares the same cup with him. He initially suspects it might be poisoned. Other people in the town, such as a pompous real-estate owner make no secret that they don't like 'different' kinds, so our smart-alec judge really stick out. Being a judge can be dangerous too!

Other parts of the film seem both dramatic and unrealistic--Goodnight pretends to lynch a white man who had mistreated African Americans, refuses to convict a showgirl who self-defends herself against assault, and supports Indian property rights. I do have a hard time believing that a frontier judge would have done all this. It does make an action-packed screenplay and Luke is awesome as the Wild West superhero  but it's not entirely realistic. Not by a long shot.  Attempting to avenge his parents murder, and clean things up, he almost morphs into Batman in the wild west when dealing with cases/people which he's not entirely fond of. The obviously gruelling work revitalizes him from the slacker lawyer we see at the begining of the screen play. Now he actually has to work and think to get things done, and keep his own tail intact.

Parts of the screenplay also reminded me of Doc Hollywood: a big shot searches for and finds his inner peace--and an unconventional girlfriend--where he is not expecting it. And since it's Luke Perry, there are some kissing scenes in here. He's a couple of years older now--but still in great shape (the shirtless scenes).

The parts about this woman's father and the necklace WERE just completely stupid.  Luke and Jason could have done something else other than throw these lines in to obviously fill up screen space. I still think she's Amy Acker's long lost twin because she even has the accent.  I wish that Lara Gilchrist had a more substantial plot line in this movie. They did not really know what to do with her once she had been introduced in the screenplay. Make her a schoolteacher or community leader (Wyoming gave women the right to vote first) other than flirt with Luke and sew him up after an injury.",1383350400,,3033,4.802303262955854

8432904,1,B004KDYQYY,"I felt like throwing several hours of my life away today, and accomplished it rather spectacularly by watching these three (cough) movies on Hallmark Movies Now.

As I'm almost 70 years old, I can well remember the hay day of the 1950s/60s television westerns. These three Goodnight for Justice movies rank almost as good; though, I was a kid then, and plots, acting, and any semblance to historic realism didn't mean much at the time. Apparently, those factors didn't mean much to the producers of these movies, either. Now, had there been some tongue-in-cheek humor written into the scripts, I'd say okay, but these movies have the temerity to take themselves seriously. Really, I just about choked during the first one, Goodnight for Justice (no subtitle), when the female protagonist (played by Lara Gilchrist) walks into Luke Perry's hotel room, where he's conveniently naked in a bathtub. Supposedly, Gilchrist's character is a respected towns person, but her reaction and costume are more reminiscent of a San Francisco prostitute of whichever post-Civil War decade the story purports to represent -- though the movies' producers, through costuming and props can't seem nail that down either. The plots of these three movies are highly contrived and laughably improbable, and the acting does nothing to improve on it.

Treat yourselves to a good night by avoiding Goodnight for Justice.",1515196800,,1393,5.1866666666666665
