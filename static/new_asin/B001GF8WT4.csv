8305208,5,B001GF8WT4,"If you enjoy goofy spoofs of overdone genres, Bloodsuckers From Outer Space is definitely worth a look.  Between characters breaking the fourth wall (""d**n, that incidental music's scary!""), vampiric zombies who talk normally (""does this mean you won't be staying for dinner?""), a military leader who humorously embodies the ""bomb it into the ground"" mentality, and more, it manages to make fun of just about every illogical horror/zombie convention I can think of.",1511654400,,465,5.36986301369863
8305209,5,B001GF8WT4,"Robert Bradeen was my great grandfather, and he always considered this movie to be his lasting legacy, making the while family watch it multiple times and telling the same stories about it over and over, but it will always have a lasting place in my heart.",1509753600,,256,4.586956521739131
8305210,4,B001GF8WT4,"Original and done well for the budget, Glen Coburn's 1984 space zombie schlock-fest is a staple of independent 80's cinema.",1477526400,,123,5.2
8305211,5,B001GF8WT4,"Along with anyone who actively sought out this movie, I share a penchant for really abysmal acting/special effectsthe worse, the better. I picked this up because a friend of my dad's was on the production crew. If you are into the polished and refined big studio productions, this probably isn't for you. But, if you are looking for a break from the norm, and enjoy low budget films then this ""WEIRD"" movie will surely satisfy.",1473638400,3,427,4.706666666666667
8305212,5,B001GF8WT4,"From the blood-spewing opening, and the incredible theme song, to... well, everything else, BLOODSUCKERS FROM OUTER SPACE is an ultra-low budget spectacular! Jeff Rhodes (Thom Meyers) is a small town reporter, investigating a series of strange deaths. He soon becomes enmeshed in a zombie onslaught, brought about through extraterrestrial means. Of course, it doesn't help when a group of idiot scientists, as well as the military get involved. If movies like KILLER CLOWNS FROM OUTER SPACE, ATTACK OF THE KILLER TOMATOES, INVASION OF THE BLOOD FARMERS, RABID GRANNIES, or FLESH-EATING MOTHERS send your heart a-flutter, then you'll find ecstasy here! Made entirely of cheeeze by-products, BFOS makes the best of its nonexistent funding, complete w/ sinfully bad acting, ludicrous dialogue, the world's most absurd, house-demolishing love scene, and the beautiful, banjo-enhanced, fight-to-the-death sequence! Nothing, and I do mean NOTHING, can possibly prepare you for the headless farmer dance routine! Gorehundts are guaranteed a gloriously gooshy good time! Give this juicy gem from 1985 a try. Fun will surely follow...",1430611200,3,1125,5.662721893491124
8305213,4,B001GF8WT4,So bad it's hilarious. If you like low budget cheesy horror films then this one is for you.,1427500800,2,91,4.111111111111111
8305214,5,B001GF8WT4,"The DVD is great and the only negative I have had to do with the content itself, the ""reunion"" interviews and behind the scenes doesn't have the two main stars. Not sure why they'd not want to be part of it. I was really disappointed that they didn't want to be part of the only thing they are really known for at all. But otherwise it's a fun silly movie and just pure simple laughs. Don't expect much from it except that.",1393200000,5,423,4.170731707317073
8305215,5,B001GF8WT4,"Love this movie, one of my favorites from the 80's. My friend and I used to rent this at least once a month for cheesy horror movie night! So happy it was available as a digital download.",1390176000,2,187,4.081081081081081
8305216,4,B001GF8WT4,"My favorite movies are good cheap low budget horror movies like this one and boy this one is cheesy,""but good."" This invisible presence invades this small country town. killing the towns people and turning them into zombies. I love the effects that they use in this movie. The vains in the zombies look like they were drawn on with blue sharpy. I love that. Like I said this is a good cheap zombie movie. But I have seen better. I recommend The Dead Next Door. Another great zombie movie. If you don't like cheesy zombie movies just movies like Night Of The Living Dead and nuthing else. I don't think that you will like this one. But if you do give this one a go. Pick it up at amazon.",1264377600,3,686,4.2846153846153845
8305217,5,B001GF8WT4,"Before we begin I must tell you my favorite films of all time include The Toxic Avenger, Pink Flamingos and Frankenhooker. The badder the acting, the badder the effects the better the film. With that said, and if you like the other films I mentioned above then Bloodsuckers from Outerspace is right up your alley ,er, in your gutter. It's supposed to be a spoof of the zombie horror/sci fi alien genre (even if the alien space wave attacking the people is oderless,invisible,tasteless and there is only a wind gust to signify the danger???) but that's hard to read with the way the story is told. You gotta be quick to catch it...like when being chased by Bloodsuckers the protaganists jump in the car and it fires right up(that never happens when zombies are chasing you) and our damsil tells us ""First time, every time"". The comedy is truly funny, not one concern about who might get offended or cry(so offensive I won't even repeat my favorite lines in fear of being censored). The make up is god awful, the f/x not so great but that's what makes the film. It has a campy feel through out and has no shame in that fact. This one's for the fans of b-bad cinema and fans of the cult classic. I myself enjoyed every minute of Bloodsuckers from Outerspace, but remember I also enjoyed ""The Suckling"" and ""Inseminoid""...""Fishing with Gandhi"" and ""Street Trash"".",1232150400,8,1359,4.643153526970955
