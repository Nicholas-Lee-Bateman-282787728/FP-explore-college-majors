2070713,1,B00029NMRM,"I am one to watch alot of movies and to be sort of pleased with all, but this movie was completely rediculous. i mean why would they make the movie this stupid. Granted the first one wasn't all that but this one was just thrown right into the theatres and no one was even thinkin bout the public's reaction to this movie. in all i don't recommend this movie to anyone. if it's on tv then im sure there is something else better on. don't waste your time like i did. tell everyone..this movie is Bulls***.",1088380800,4,503,4.25
2070714,1,B00029NMRM,"This will rank right up there in my list of aimless films with a forced and pedestrian plot, that are made simply to rake in some more juice from a Part 2 of a moderately successful Part 1. The gags are so uncomical, the execution so muddled, and the editing so sloppy that Matthew Perry's character gets it right-on when he starts exclaiming about how confused he is by how everything turns out. The audience can surely feel his pain. What a lazy and irrelevant sequel to Nine Yards, which was at least bearable for what it was.",1087776000,12,529,4.408163265306122

2070736,2,B00029NMRM,"As far as sequels go, this wasn't the worst. Maintaining most of the cast from the original movie (The Whole 9 Yards), we find our ""heroes"" in yet another humorous debacle with the same mafia family that they battled before. The neurotic dentist (Matthew Perry) and the sociopathic hitman (Bruce Willis) are reluctantly brought together again by extreme circumstances. I will say that I was pleased to see this movie did sport its own plot and wasn't simply a repackaged duplicate of the first. That said.... while it has its funny moments, I think they just tried too hard with it. The Whole 9 Yards was much funnier and had a better plot. But that's of course just my opinion.",1516492800,,678,4.658333333333333

I feel genuinely sorry for the people who appeared in this movie. Plot makes no sense, and Bruce Willis in partial drag isn't really funny. Jokes are labored, corny but not funny. Had high hopes because I liked the original movie.

It's the same characters later. Problem is, there is no longer a story, there are only weak attempts at humor and what slapstick there is, is poorly done. Save your time with this one - there is nothing to redeem it. If you need to know more, ask yourself why they never made The Whole Eleven Yards as a sequel to this sequel.

2070920,4,B00029NMRM,"I love this movie for a few reasons.  One of those reasons is that I'm a HUGE fan of the previous film 'The Whole Nine Yards' to which this serves as the sequel.  The next is the fact that Bruce Willis is one of the best of the underrated actors out there and captivates my attention with every performance he gives.  The third, and biggest reason I love this film is a little scene where Jimmy (Willis) and Oz (Perry) visit the local pub and get a little (or a lot) drunk.  The whole scene is worth the price of the rental.  I guess since it reminds me so much of myself and my friends (I'm an emotional drunk) and the whole morning after thing is so the way it would happen.  All in all the laughs are there, some are forced and the gags can be a bit cheesy.  'The Whole Nine Yards' was a far superior film, but this sequel is not without it's moments and Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry are a great comic team.  Bruce can tackle everything from action to comedy to drama and should be recognized a little more for that.  This may not end up your favorite title but it won't be your least.  The premise follows Oz and Jimmy as they try and rescue Oz's wife (Jimmy's ex) from a mob boss trying to get revenge on Jimmy.  Amanda Peet plays Jimmy's wife whose fed up with the softy Jimmy has become and is trying to be the tough contract killer that Jimmy once was.  There are subplots and a twist at the end that makes this more than a no-brainer, but the fact still remains that the film makes little sense...but it doesn't really matter.  Just sit back, relax, don't think about it and enjoy it for what it is...or at least watch the drunk scene, then pop in 'The Whole Nine Yards' and really enjoy yourself.",1149552000,,1708,4.2024539877300615
2070921,5,B00029NMRM,"This is an extremely unusual film in that it is better than the first one - nine yards- which was very good. It has only one disadvantage : you may need, or rather I needed to view it twice to understand what was going on. Not a real disadvantage - I just viewed it for the third time and enjoyed it even more.",1141516800,,310,3.9365079365079363
2070922,2,B00029NMRM,"Thanks to falsified dental records supplied by his former neighbor Nicholas Oz Oseransky, retired hitman Jimmy The Tulip Tudeski now spends his days compulsively cleaning his house and perfecting his culinary skills with his wife, Jill, a purported assassin who has yet to pull off a clean hit. Suddenly, an uninvited and unwelcome connection to their past unexpectedly shows up on Jimmy and Jill's doorstep: it's Oz, and he's begging them to help him rescue his wife from the Hungarian mob. To complicate matters even further, the men, who are out to get Oz, are led by Lazlo Gogolak, a childhood rival of Jimmy's and another notorious hitman. Oz, Jimmy and Jill will have to go the whole nine yards--and then some--to manage the mounting Mafioso mayhem.

There isn't much about this film to enjoy. I was hoping it would be a lot funnier than it was, but I just didn't laugh at anything except Kevin Pollack's character who was hard to understand most of the time. I had no problem with the cast, I enjoyed all of their performances. Especially Kevin Pollack and Natasha Henstridge who really made the film at least somewhat watchable. If only Bruce Willis could have had more funny lines, or Matthew Perry been a little funnier, or if Amanda Peet...wait there's nothing wrong with her. Anyway, I can only recommend this to someone who likes the cast but not necessarily the story, otherwise, this movie gets a 5 out of 10 because they did try...to some degree.",1122163200,7,1462,4.778656126482214
2070923,4,B00029NMRM,"As a huuuuge fan of ""The Whole Nine Yards"" I knew that there was no way ANY sequel would ever match the comedy and plot twists as the first.  This being said, I went into this film with minimal expectations.

Well, this movie turned out better than I had hoped.  The cast is still fun to watch and the story, aalthough a little confusing at times, is still plausable and symetric with the first movie.

Matthew Perry plays 'Oz', a dentist, who recently married 'Cymthia', 'Jimmy the Tulips'(Bruce Willis) ex-wife.  Picking up where he left off in the original, Perry is hilarious in this film.  'Oz' is a very scared man after all that he had been thru in the first film; and, Perry plays this to perfection.  WHile this role for 'Oz' is different than the first; where he played a Dentist who simply had no clue what was happening around him; it still works with the plot and is a pleasant change-of-pace for the sequel.  'Oz' has decided to arm his house with guns and monitor the perimeter with cameras.  This drives his wife, 'Cynthia' mad to the point where she goes behind his back and plots an inheritance heist with her ex-husband 'Jimmy'.  NAturally, the the 'heist' involves both 'Oz' and hitwoman-wannabe, 'Jill'(Amanda Peat).

The plot involves 'Yanni Gogalack's' father, threatening 'Oz' and kidnapping 'Cynthia' for information as to the whereabouts of 'Jimmy'(or Yimmy') as the 'Gogalacks' always say.  The rest of the movie is basically the unraveling of the planned 'heist'.

Amanda Peat is great in this film, as is her character 'Jill'.  IN this one, they play-out the fact that she wants to be a professional hit-woman and continuously screws up potential 'jobs'.  Sh eplays the role well, albeit the fact that this is a 'cheesy' comedy.

Bruce Willis is good and believable as 'Jimmy', but 'Jimmy' is pretending to be psychaotic thruoughout most of the film and it does get a little annoying after awhile.

Matthew Perry makes this film, much as he did the first.  He is constantly being picked-on by 'Jimmy' and he just takes it all in stride so well.  He's really funny in this film.

ALl-in-all I would recommend this film, but DO NOT expect anything near as good as the first.",1118275200,,2201,4.712041884816754
2070924,1,B00029NMRM,"This movies is not bad. It's worse than that, it is.... useless. Yes, I asted 98 minutes of my life watching it (otherwise I would not review it!), but I advise you to not do so. It's really weak, the onnly average performance is by Willis, who seems to be having fun. The rest of the cast is lost inside a screenplay that has abolutely nothing to offer.",1115942400,5,354,4.220588235294118
2070945,3,B00029NMRM,"The original cast return for an unecessary sequel of the much funnier original nine yards movie, and work hard to lift this picture above forgettable. Bruce Willis is now an apron sporting homemaker getting in touch with his feminine side and hiding in Mexico with his new hitman wife Jill (Amanda Peet). Oz (Perry) is living the high life in LA with his new wife Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge) still in dentistry but with a small arms factory in his lavish home. All appears well until Lazlo Gogalak (Pollack) emerges from prison and comes after them for murdering his son (also played by Pollack) in the first movie. What was a reasonable idea suffers badly from ""Sequelitis"" and comes across as little more than reworking old ideas. There are some funny moments, and the 98 minute run time moves quickly enough, without requiring to much concentration, but this picture is quickly forgotten. Everything seems to be overdone to try and squeeze cheap laughs, from Pollacks poor command of English, to Willis's apparent erectile dysfunction, and Perrys paranoia and confusion. All obviously ends well for our loving quartet, but the lack of any real surprises, and a very weak script don't help the end result. OK movie, but nowhere near as good as the first, and rent before buying is a must. The DVD also has non existent extras (unless you include one trailer and director commentary) adding to the whole feel that this package was a money driven exploit flick devoid of depth or intelligence.",1113696000,,1494,4.8858267716535435

Matthew Perry (Almost Heroes, Fools Rush In) reprises his role as Oz the dentist who's new wife Nastasha Henstridge (Tv's She Spies, Species 1 and 2) gets kidnapped by old fart mob leader bad dude Lazlo Gogolak, the father of Yanni Gogolak from the first movie, both played by Kevin Pollack (The Usual Suspects, Grumpy and Grumpier Old Men). So, Perry travels to Mexico form Willis' help to save his ex-wife and this takes Willis out of hiding and from him to stop wearing wis, aprons, bunnies slippers and stop vacuuming the rug...hmm. Willis is wasted big time folks and seeing his rear doesnt help at all. Perry falls down, gets hit and wiggles around alot and hey, from his real life experience, maybe he did some drugs or something...booze maybe. That's Bruce Willis' daughter Tallulah Willis as the Girlscout...you rememeber the scene, where Perry opens the door holding the gun telling her ""who sent you"". Kevin Pollack is not even funny as the old fart. Too much nonsesense and not enough brains.",1112745600,2,1332,4.721030042918455
2070947,2,B00029NMRM,"I will start off my review for this film with a little bit of support going for it, saying that Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry are two of my favorite actors. The bad part is that sadly, even though this film has a great cast, it happens to be one of those poor sequels with a great cast.

This film picks up on where ""The Whole Nine Yards"" left off.  This time, Jimmy ""The Tulip"" Tedeski (Willis)is living in Mexico with his wife Jill (Amanda Peet).  Jimmy and Jill are both hitmen.  In the meantime, Oz (Perry) is living in Los Angeles with his wife, Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge).  Everything is going well for Jimmy and Jill, and everything is going, well, OK for Oz..........until Cynthia is kidnapped by the Hungarian mob that appeared in the first film (note that in the first film, Jill was Oz's assistant and Cynthia was originally Jimmy's wife), leaving Oz to turn to Jimmy and Jill for help, which leads to about an hour of boredom.

When I first saw ""The Whole Nine Yards"", I thought it was hilarious, and I didn't understand why professional movie critics didn't like it (although it did make a lot of money and was very popular when it first came out).  Maybe the fact that the guy who directed the first film, Jonathan Lynn, was not involved behind the scenes with this film could have something to do with it (Director Howard Deutch substituted for Lynn on this film).  Maybe it just had bad timing. After all, this film was released shortly before the hit show ""Friends"" went off the air; maybe Matthew Perry was just too worried about what would happen to him and his career after his show went off the air.  It has often been said that nervousness can often result in a bad thing; maybe that's the case for Perry and this film (and maybe Willis if you heard the thing about him and Lindsey Lohan).  As I sit here typing this I am grateful for the fact that I am not a professional movie critic, and that I just do this for fun during my spare time. The performances in this film aren't that great, and like several critics already mentioned when this film came out, Amanda Peet didn't pull off much of a performance than Willis, Perry, and the other actors in this film did, but you can tell that she was TRYING to act.  And like I already said, Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry are two of my favorite actors, but in this film, they come off as very annoying.  I wanted to slap both Willis and Perry for their annoying performances in this film the first time I saw it.

Overall, if you are a die hard movie fan who always like sequels no matter what the critics and movie buffs think, then this film is for you.  Otherwise, if you are not one of those people, then just skip this film and see ""The Whole Nine Yards"" instead.",1112227200,,2740,4.368110236220472
2070948,3,B00029NMRM,"The Whole Ten Yards was quite a disappointment, considering the success of the first film and the make up of the cast.

The acting is pretty good (but nothing great), the humor is very poor, and the plot is just average.

Matthew Perry getting hit and smacked around got tiring and annoying very early on. As for the ""idiot"" Hungarian mafia family, it was just SAD and not funny at all!

Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really...

In a nutshell, it's an ok movie, and that's about it; it lacks that extra something to put it over the top.  No masterpiece here.",1107475200,,619,4.385964912280702
2070949,3,B00029NMRM,"The first movie was diverting fun, with some surprises - and this sequel follows up with less of the same.

In the last movie, Nick ""Oz"" Oseransky (Perry) was a dentist and often reluctant conspirator of on-the-run hitman Jimmy ""Tulip"" Tudeski (Willis), as the contract killer lies low in Canada.  At the end of the last movie, Oz married with Jimmy's ex-wife Cynthia (Henstrige) while Jimmy ran off with Jill (Peet), Oz's assistant who turned out to be a contract killer hired by Oz's wife to kill him.  It was diverting fun, which looked more like it was more fun to make than it was to watch.

In ""Ten Yards"", Oz and Jimmy remain married but not quite happily.  Oz is a wealthy dentist in Brentwood, CA, but his home less a castle than an embattled fortress oozing with high-tech security devices and dripping with assault weapons.  Jimmy has gone the other direction - setting himself up in a Mexican hacienda, becoming an obsessive domestic god while leaving Jill to do the whacking.  Needless to say it's an arrangement that doesn't make their wives any happier, especially Jill who, skills aside, only accidentally kills her victims.

Complicating things for everybody is Lazlo Gogolak - the father of Yanni Gogolak from the last movie (both being east-European gangsters played by Kevin Pollak) - who is determined to kill everybody from the last movie.

The humor is scattershot.  It's clear that the guys who made this flick are as mystified to the sucess of the last movie as we are, and they've just thrown the leads together hopinng to repeat its sucess, and ramped things up a notch just to remind us that this is a sequel.  Willis seems more hair-triggered

psychotic than the last time (and we must wonder twice as often whether Willis will kill Oz) while Oz seems even twice as clutzy as before.  Henstridge gets kidnapped early, so her scenes are fewer.  Pollack is actually more funny here than in ""nine yards"" but the script surrounds him with one-note morons that the movie has no interest in developing.  There are scenes that are supposed to be either funny or scary, and it seems that the writers were as mystified as the rest of us, hoping that Perry's adorable dopiness and Willis's homididal charm would acrry the way. How much you enjoy this flick will depend on how much you enjoyed the last movie.",1099180800,,2327,4.711111111111111
2070950,2,B00029NMRM,"'The Whole Nine Yards' was not a classic, but made with a surprisingly refreshing tone.  The story was unpredictable -- about the ex-hitman and the timid dentist, and some unique characters (including a hitwoman wannabe Amanda Peet).  Now, they made a sequel to it, but frankly, do we need it?  Or can they really do it when the original was based on the premise you can use just for one time?

The results are lame, tired, even miserable comedy that is not funny at all.  Bruce Willis comes back as Jimmy the Tulip, whose life is now, again, in danger because a mafia boss Lazlo is out of jail, who is played by Kevin Pollack.  Many characters you saw in 'The Whole Nine Yards' return (not Mr. Duncan, though)  But the central story is about the new baddie Lazlo (buried in a heavy make-up) who happens to be the father of the baddie of the original, played by the same Kevin Pollack.

This is the same ruse used in the sequel of 'City Slickers' -- once charming characters, after put in the right places at the end of the original film, are called back simply because another film must be made.  Bruce Willis 'must' act like silly, because he was not before; Matthew Perry (as the same dentist Oz) 'must' act like silly because he believes somebody must kill him, the plot nobody believes now.  Amanda Peet 'must' act like silly for, well, she has nothing to do this time (except for some bumbling 'jobs'); and most damagingly, Natasha Henstrige 'must' sleepwalk all through the new film simply because her role is nothing but a poor excuse for kidnapping plot, which is pointless and thrillless.

In one earlier scene, Bruce Willis, now in Mexico, appears with tired face, wearing a pair of fluffy, bunny shoes.  This is the same thing as Christopher Walken did in 'Country Bears' and  that's a bad sign indeed.  You know, these films are  shamelessly craving for laughs, which they will never get in this so obvious fashion.  And as the film goes on, the cast raise the voice (see the scene in a bar), and speak out loud the long, winding, not-so-funny dialogues you can never remember after ten seconds.  Well I didn't because I fell asleep.  Sorry.

One thing I should praise is that even in this mess, Bruce Willis retains his charisma to some extent.  I still don't know whether or not he can really act, like Keanu, but he is unmistakeably a star.  In this case, however, that only makes this film more unwatchable.",1096502400,3,2424,4.564814814814815
2070951,3,B00029NMRM,"This movie is the sequel to a really funny comedy (The Whole Nine Yards) that was full of intrigue and had a cast that worked extremely well together!  While most of the same cast is in The Whole Ten Yards, I had significant trouble following the story and was very disappointed in the characters.  The lovable former hitman 'Jimmy the Tulip' played by Bruce Willis - was just awful - he wasn't funny or likable - which is just not Bruce Willis.  Matthew Perry as the bumbling dentist is stilted and unbelievable and even Jill (Amanda Peet) who was a really cool hitman wannabe in the first movie - became a total incompetent.

I really hate to say it, but this film is almost embarrassing to watch - at a minimum it has a very hard-to-follow story line.  While there are some good parts, they are few and far between.

If you want to watch it just because you really enjoyed the first one - I say, ""go for it""!  But, if you haven't seen the Whole Nine Yards yet - definitely go watch that one instead!",1096243200,,1002,4.32620320855615
2070952,1,B00029NMRM,"The first movie (...Nine Yards) was entertaining.  This one is - or should be - an embarrassment to everyone involved in its production.  They should have called it ""One More Yard"", since it is about 1/10 as good as the first one.  When the actors are interviewed in the future, this should be the answer to the question ""What is the worst movie you ever made?"". With all due respect, I have to believe that anyone who writes a positive review of this movie is either not sober, or stands to make money from it in some way.",1094860800,6,523,4.316326530612245
2070953,2,B00029NMRM,"I really enjoyed The Whole Nine Yards, but this sequel was a letdown, not to mention unnecessary in the first place. There's a few worthwhile moments, but overall the movie screams ""money grab"". The various head games Bruce Willis plays was funny in the original, but feels sorta recycled here. It might be worth checking out if you come across it while channel surfing, but otherwise you should probably save your cash for something else...",1094601600,2,441,4.8933333333333335
2070954,1,B00029NMRM,"There is no other way to explain why this movie was so spectacularly bad except through analogy.

We are all familair with the concept of ""it's so bad it's good"" when it comes to bad movies. You look at a movie and think, ""Man, this is bad!"" But you don't look away. In the end, you conclude that it was so bad it was good.

""The Whole Ten Yards"" is like a train wreck... only without the train. It's like the Train company taking out a full page ad in the newspaper to tell everyone that there will be a train wreck at the railroad junction at 5:00 P.M. on Saturday. And you know how it is with train wrecks - they're bad but you just can't look away. Anyway, the people of our town get ready for the 5 PM train wreck. They get blankets and camp out and picnic waiting for the train wreck. They toss the football around and eat cheese and drink wine. Finally, 5:00 approaches and they get ready... and ready... and ready... and 5:00 passes and no train wreck. Minutes pass and people are waiting in postponed anticipation. A half hour passes and people start to get annoyed. An hour passes and people start to leave.... but not all of them. A few remain for 4 hours waiting for the promised train wreck but none occurs - the only thing wrecked was their Saturday afternoon expectations.

The plot was vacant and meandering. The characters (all the holdovers from ""The Whole Nine Yards"" plus Kevin Pollack playing ""Lazlo Goglak"" the father to the troublesome gangster in ""The Whole Nine Yards"" also played by Pollack) suffer immensely. In ""The Whole Nine Yards"" they were tightly written and well-developed. In this movie, they have become perverse and stunted. The characters and the actors who play them have no idea as to the character's motivation. The plot resolution is both predicitable and preposterous.

At the end, the viewer is wondering why he had waited to see this movie with eager anticipation and angry at having been cheated of the adept comedy which was part of ""The Whole Nine Yards."" Those who stopped watching before the end of the movie did so because they were convinced (much like the above mentioned train watchers) that this movie would never deliver on its comedic promise. Those who lasted until the end held out hope that the movie would deliver what it promised only to be bitterly disappointed with the result.

Woe to the trusting potential viewer who believes the promises made by this movie. Pity those who have come to learn that ""The Whole Ten Yards"" is as bland as it is derivative with its ruined characters and its unintelligibly pointless plot.",1093219200,6,2584,4.596529284164859

The wife can't shoot straight and the husbnad is retired from the business. the plot centers around a Hungarian mob leader who is released from prison and wants vengance on the retired hit man (Bruce Willis) and a dentist, Mathew Perry. It goes down hill from here. The only interesting characters were the mobster and his son and the son was killed off about mid-movie. This move is a real stinker.

2070976,2,B00029NMRM,"The movie, ""The Whole Nine Yards"",  that was the catalyst for this sequel, was a hysterically funny, black comedy with a great cast and a very tight, well-written script. While this film still has the same great cast, they can only work with what they have, and what they have is an incomprehensible script from hell.

This is a film that is embarrassing to watch. The only comfort for those cast in this contrived and confounding piece of drivel is that they were paid big bucks for reprising their original roles. The ever charming Bruce Willis, reprising his role of retired hit man, Jimmy the Tulip, is barely able to make his character likable. Matthew Perry, reprising his role of Oz, dentist and  Jimmy's friend, turns his former good guy innocence into total  buffoonery that is contrived and unfunny. Jill, his former dental hygienist turned professional hit woman, is played again by the lovely Amanda Peet,  now married to Jimmy, and has seemingly lost any intelligence she had in the original film.

For those watching this film, there is little to keep one interested, as the plot makes no sense. The only people who may want to watch this film are those who loved the prequel and are interested in seeing how the mighty have fallen.

And while this movie does have some good chuckles (due to the neurotic comedic performance by Matthew Perry), the rest of the movie lacks the punch of the first.  The scripting seems a bit shallow at times, and aside from Perry's performance, the other actors don't seem to be putting out the effort.  Amanda Peet's character shines at points, but at other times seems lackluster.  Since we've already been introduced to the characters in the first movie, the director attempts to throw off the viewer by introducing a plot twist - one which backfires by coming off as chaotic and cliche.  I would recommend the movie for any die-hard The Whole Nine Yards fans, but unfortunately this isn't one for the collection.",1091145600,,805,4.933333333333334
