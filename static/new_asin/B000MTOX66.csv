8172183,5,B000MTOX66,The interview with Jancis Robinson is wonderful. She is a wine critic/writer from London working for the Financial Times. She is very interesting and so delightful to listen to. I would love to share a bottle with her someday.,1363046400,,226,4.82051282051282
8172184,5,B000MTOX66,"Excellent interview with Guillermo del Toro, director of Pans Labyrinth and two other Mexican directors. Streaming worked fine. Enjoyed it",1345680000,,138,5.95
8172185,4,B000MTOX66,"I have seen high praise for the Randall interview. Perhaps because I am not really a maven  in the world of particle or for that matter any other physics I did not particularly go for the interview. String theory and all its speculations, multiple worlds and universes, branes, and other supposed possible stuff wait, as she herself indicated, for the Large Hadron Collider to provide some evidence. Even then I suspect that Physics  has gotten to the point where Speculation so far outweighs evidence that mumbo- jumbo is the result. I may be absolutely wrong about this.
Wilson is speaking about real dangers, global warming and other human processes which are contracting the biosphere. His appeal is to Evangelical Christians to help with the effort of preserving the Earth. He refers to Genesis, and the fundamental idea that Mankind is meant to be a steward of Creation, to protect it and promote its flourishing. A crusty fellow and great scientist, striving to save the world.
Rose was as usual a fine questioner who really listens to the people he speaks with and makes a major effort at dialoguing truly with them.",1196899200,,1124,4.87958115183246
8172186,5,B000MTOX66,"In his series of interviews with scientists, Charlie Rose presents an authentic view of scientists at work.  In this disk of interviews with Lisa Randall in particle physics and cosmology and E.O. Wilson on the demise of species, we find an encounter of the plain man and the learned woman and man.  Rose is a good interviewer who asks the questions that can sensibly be asked by an intelligent observer.  Purchasers of this record will judge the merit of its content for themselves, but they can be sure to encounter views of investigators distinguished in their respective disciplines.  This disk is well engineered and presents an excellent video and audio record of scientific insights and findings to grace the collection of anyone whose interest in science is keen.",1187827200,,771,5.0
8172187,5,B000MTOX66,"THIS INTERVIEW WITH DR RANDALL, A PHYSICIST SHOULD BE REQUIRED VIEWING FOR ALL SERIOUS STUDENTS OF SCIENCE.  THIS IS NOT JUST MY OPINION AS THERE ARE MORE REVIEWS (292 AS OF TODAY) ON THIS CONVERSATION THAN ANY OTHER RECENT INTERVIEW OF CHARLIE'S.  CURIOSITY AND DISCOVERY ARE CRUCIAL TO OUR SURVIVAL.  HER ILLUMINATION OF THE QUESTIONS BEING ASKED BY PHYSICISTS SHOULD BE AN INSPIRATION TO ALL WHO ARE CURIOUS ABOUT LIFE AND THE UNIVERSE.  SCIENCE IS NOT JUST ABOUT ASKING QUESTIONS AND TESTING HYPOTHESES; ITS ACKNOWLEDGING THAT WE MIGHT NOT EVEN HAVE THE UNDERSTANDING TO KNOW ""WHICH"" QUESTIONS TO ASK.  THERE IS AN ART TO SCIENCE AND DR RANDALL OFFERS THE PALETTE.",1170374400,4,668,4.981981981981982
