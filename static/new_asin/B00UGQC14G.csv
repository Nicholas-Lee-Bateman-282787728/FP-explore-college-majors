8706596,5,B00UGQC14G,"The intervening years have been kind to the John Belushi-Dan Aykroyd cult classic, which can be seen in a better light thanks to John Landis' ""director's cut."" Exhibitors balked at the original 2-hour running time and forced Landis to trim 15 minutes for the 1980 theatrical release. Happily, the musical performances have been gloriously expanded  including Aretha Franklin's ""Think,"" James Brown's ""The Old Landmark"" and the powerful John Lee Hooker segment. Thanks to this extended re-edit, the emphasis lies more on rhythm and blues than spectacular car chases. No matter what version you see, ""The Blues Brothers"" is great fun from beginning to end.",1464393600,3,654,5.288461538461538
