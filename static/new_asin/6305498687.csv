7891927,5,6305498687,"This is a small Canadian Movie based on a book by Malcolm Bosse that exists only on VHS. I value my copy and get it out to watch at least once a year. One the pleasures of watching it is to see 15-year-old Ryan Reynolds playing the leading role.

Jeffrey Moore/Ganesh is a Caucasian raised by his father as a Hindu Vegan in India. No mention is made of what befell his mother but as the story begins his father is dying of heart failure. When his father expires Jeffrey digs up the family fortune stored in a tiny vault in the earth under the chicken coop in the back yard. Using an old letter from his father's sister and the cash Jeffrey sets off by plane dressed in sandals and sarong to meet his Aunt Charlotte at Malton Airport in the middle of an Ontario winter.

If Paris on the Grand in Ontario is unprepared to meet Jeffrey his Aunt who works at a local cafe has no clue about raising a self-reliant teen male. Jeffrey's teacher at High School represents all that is worst in a bigoted, smart-Alec. He's the kind of teacher we'd like to think no longer exists. In a small town that worships teen sports athletes Jeffrey practices Yoga startling his gym teacher when he sits on the bottom of the swimming pool holding his breath for over 4 minutes.

The movie then is about the manner in which Jeffrey wins the respect of his peers and the town at large shrugging off racist jibes directed at his stilted use of the English Language and his choice in clothing. Both have something to learn from the other as do we. This is a charming bit of movie making.

Fun to see Paul Anka in a bit part as the villain.",1380931200,,1614,4.281967213114754
7891928,5,6305498687,"This movie has the formula that many afternoon specials use, where the displaced kid knows more then those around him. The title is the redeeming factor. The movie presses upon you the lessons of magic. That it is real and works in ways not planned. At any moment, they could have lost their house. Due to process and time people had time to reflect on what they were doing. Therefore, magic does not have to be supernatural. Especially ordinary magic. Similar to miracles, it is not some supernatural process that is a miracle; it is that the process happens when you need it.",1258243200,,577,4.611650485436893
7891929,5,6305498687,"When Warren Moore dies as a Canadian expatriate in India, he leaves a son Jeffrey who has been raised his entire life in India and who has been taught to follow Indian beliefs including Hinduism.
Jeffrey (nicknamed Ganesh by his father) is forced to return to Canada to live with Charlotte, his father's sister. Jeffrey's beliefs are as foreign and unsuited for Canada as his wardrobe.
Charlotte is not entirely able to take care of herself, let alone a teenager who is different. She has been ignoring legal notices for some time and is in danger of losing the family's ancestral home.
Jeffrey's fellow high school students and even his teachers quickly single him out as different. He is mocked for his different way of speaking but the students and faculty soon learn that Jeffrey has an inner strength that makes him different in positive ways as well.
Some students are more generous of spirit. Tom, the captain of the high school basketball team, and Lucy, a girl at the school, take an interest in him and befriend him.
Jeffrey finally gains acceptance and a bit of local notoriety when he starts to aid his aunt in the struggle to keep the family home. He explains the principles of satyagraha to her and they begin a hunger strike that end up changing the whole town.
This movie is a great story, well told. The movie has an honest, genuine, life affirming quality ably served by the Cat Stephens music sprinkled throughout. Ryan Reynolds and Joe Roncetti are adorable as Jeffrey and Tom and Glenne Headly is very convincing as Charlotte.",990921600,13,1547,4.733333333333333
