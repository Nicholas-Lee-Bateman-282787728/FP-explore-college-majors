8009175,5,B0001AGI2S,Very interesting. I liked Paul Heinerth in it too!,1439510400,,50,4.666666666666667
8009176,5,B0001AGI2S,"Fantastic, exciting film....",1414972800,,28,8.666666666666666
8009177,5,B0001AGI2S,"I couldn't put the book down.  An Antarctic research diving trip to explore a massive iceberg is well-documented in prose and photos.  A die-hard oceanographer and marine biologist, a hotshot underwater film maker, excellent camera and sound people -- superb divers all -- document freezing cold adventures in a pristine environment.  Since most of us couldn't, wouldn't, make such a journey, you can live it through the book.",1398643200,,426,5.235294117647059
8009178,1,B0001AGI2S,"There are maybe 6 to 7 minutes (tops) of dive footage in this entire documentary. I feel like this movie is marketed as a diver documentary, but the movie is mostly about how hard it is to get to Antarctica. The main question of the film is ""Are the changes seen at the edge of Antarctic ice shelves a result of global warming, or just a natural cycle?"" They leave without an answer.",1243987200,4,383,4.260273972602739
8009179,5,B0001AGI2S,"It takes a lot of courage to go dive into in iceberg, something that I would never do. But this team of divers got an extraordinary look into some big ice, and it seems some extraordinary luck as well. This is an enjoyable doc, an educational adventure.",1154563200,3,253,4.404255319148936
8009180,5,B0001AGI2S,"Wes Skiles and a team of scientist and explorers embark on a long journey to Antartica to explore an iceberg named Godzilla, because of its size. Its so big that (fresh water) that it could supply the US  with drinking water for years. Wes films the whole thing in HD, so the color, depth, and clarity is outstanding on this DVD. THey explore the icebergs, above and below, and encounter many marine mammals, like seals, and penguins also. If you liked the Hidden Rivers of Florida and the River Returns DVDs, you will like this one also. You cant go wrong with Wes Skiles and his Karst production works. I highly recommend this dvd to any diver, or nature lover....",1137715200,7,666,4.55
