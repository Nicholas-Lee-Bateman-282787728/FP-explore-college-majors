8758710,3,B01EGRC15Y,"This 40 minute video is disappointing.  The video shows pilots in Costa Rica flying over beautiful scenery with majestic music in the background.  There is no dialogue at all in this video.  I don't believe these are real bush pilots either. I Think these fellas fly tourists.  I have many DVD's on Alaskan and African bush pilots.  They fly many types of aircraft large and small.  They service remote communities that are accessible only by air and deliver all types of material needed by the community; food, fuel, mediciens, tools, basics, what have you.  I don't see these pilots in this video load or unload anything from their aircraft.  You hardly see the pilots at all.  They fly only one type of aircraft, single engine cessna's.  If all you care about is great scenery and pretty music then this video is for you.  If you want to learn about what bush pilots really do, I suggest you check out DVD's on bush pilots in Alaska and Africa.",1532736000,,947,4.610778443113772
