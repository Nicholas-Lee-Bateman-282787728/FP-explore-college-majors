2613985,3,B000GIW9GO,"I only bought this for Christian Kane.  I'm slowly collecting all of his movies.  This one is fairly predictable, standard chick flick sort of movie, with the standard cliches and a slightly playful ring to it.

The virgin thing that is supposed to be the hook is at least not handled offensively, speaking as someone who didn't do the deed until 28 for various reasons that were not unlike the main character's reason.  Though, to be fair, had I had an offer from Christian Kane, no reason in the world would have been good enough.

It's a pleasant diversion, and like I said, the kissing thing is superb.  I could watch that boy kiss for hours.",1245196800,26,646,4.525862068965517
2613986,5,B000GIW9GO,"When do you ever find a movie with a good story, funny, for adults? But with no cussing, no nudity, but plenty of sex appeal. Great movie.",1220832000,17,138,4.148148148148148
2613987,3,B000GIW9GO,"Girl is ""accidentally"" a virgin at age 25, has that fact inadvertently revealed to her whole city, is made to feel humiliated because of it, and subsequently finds the right guy to fornicate with. Sure, many movies glorify sin, but I've rarely seen one that mocks purity so blatantly.

Proverbs 14:9 Fools make a mock at sin: but among the righteous [there is] favor.

Galatians 5:19-21 Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality...I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.

Hebrews 13:4 Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous.

1 Corinthians 6:9-10 Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral...nor adulterers...will inherit the kingdom of God.",1218153600,4,921,4.884615384615385
2613988,4,B000GIW9GO,This was a nice little movie.  Better than some of the big budget comedy romances.  I actually watched it twice already.  Christian Kane does  a very nice job as Paul.  His vulnerable sweet Southern cowboy look was nicely done.,1214611200,,227,4.717948717948718
2613989,5,B000GIW9GO,I also bought this movie because I knew Christian Kane was in it and as always I was not disappointed. He is adorable...and he seems to be able to make any role the right role.,1207353600,2,176,4.057142857142857
2613990,5,B000GIW9GO,Bought the movie for Christian Kane and Michael Weatherly and wasn't disappointed.  Would recommend it to anyone.,1186876800,3,113,5.647058823529412
2613991,4,B000GIW9GO,"Great guy gets girl and vice versa with lots of twists and turns and smart, sassy comedic interludes.  A great movie when you get together with your girlfriends...and guys like it too...but they might not admit it!

I love all the Sacramento backdrops..a great movie if you live in Sac because you can pick out lots of venues.",1172361600,9,326,4.603448275862069
2613992,3,B000GIW9GO,"Jeana (Estella Warren) has never quite made it over the threshold and had sex. When things get a little heated with new boyfriend Tom (Michael Weatherly of ""NCIS""), Sacramento's hot newscaster, she admits her virginity. Stunned, he blurts it out over the air while prepping for a story, and to Jeana's horror, she is a laughingstock at work, the pro-virginity gurus want her as a poster girl, the media won't leave her alone, and men keep coming up to offer to make a woman out of her. Then she meets quiet photographer Paul (Christian Kane), who works with Tom but has no idea that the sexy new gal he is friends with was in a relationship with a blowhard like Tom.

Meanwhile, Jeana wants to get her hands on the cruise tickets to Brazil to keep Tom from going on her dream vacation with someone else. Ever the arrogant jerk, Tom figures she wants to go with him. Will Jeana find out that Paul is aware of her secret? Will Tom's vacuous Russian ex Zsa Zsa accompany him on the cruise? The supporting cast includes former SNL player Victoria Jackson as a travel agent and the ever annoying Kathy Griffin as a lawyer in need of a muzzle.

Filmed entirely on location in California's capital city, the setting gives it a more realistic, non-Hollywood vibe. Overall, it is a cute and breezy romantic comedy, directed by Charles Matthau, son of the late Walter. The younger Matthau has a small role as one of Jeana's potential lovers.",1171238400,33,1431,4.5859375
2613993,4,B000GIW9GO,I liked it. :),1454544000,,14,2.75
2613994,5,B000GIW9GO,"I was not at all impressed with the actress from this movie. I definitely think they could have found someone better. She made it really difficult for me to stay ""in"" the movie for the first quite awhile.

There were also a handful of weird ""comedic"" moments that brought the quality of the movie down a little bit, but nothing too outrageous.

So why on earth would I rate this movie 5/5 stars? Is it because I'm a Kaniac? Well... yes, and no. ;)

Yes, I AM a Kaniac! But that does not mean I love every movie or show Christian Kane has been in, or every role that he has played. But I LOVED him in this. He was funny and sexy, and many of his scenes were worth instant replays. I streamed the movie the first time I watched it, but even before it ended, I bought the DVD so that I could watch it (read: him) again and again! This is my favorite Christian Kane role to-date, AFTER Eliot Spencer in Leverage. And that is saying a lot!

This movie is no masterpiece, and I'm no movie connoisseur. But if you're a Christian Kane fan (more specifically, a fan who lusts after him), you won't regret seeing this movie. If you're a Christian Kane fan because he's a badass and you just want to be like him, but you're not attracted to him... this probably isn't the movie you're looking for! It is definitely a chick-flick.",1453593600,4,1318,4.281124497991968
2613995,5,B000GIW9GO,"This is a great movie. I'm not one for romantic movies, but this has Christian Kane. He is one of my favorite actors and singers. The story line moved along really well. This held my attention for the entire movie. This is most definitely a movie that I will watch again. Maybe even a few more times.",1452038400,,300,4.280701754385965
2613996,3,B000GIW9GO,its a solid chick flick...and as a 23 year old virgin i did relate to Jeana. And it was fun seeing Christian Kane as a Romantic Dork...instead of his usual role as a tough guy who could kick the s*** out of anything.,1443139200,,216,4.046511627906977
2613997,3,B000GIW9GO,"Watched it several years ago. Wasn't as good as I remembered, but still decent.",1441497600,,79,4.714285714285714
2613998,5,B000GIW9GO,"Great movie, it will make you smile. It has a good non hollywood vibe. Of course I love Christian Kane!",1441238400,,103,4.2
2613999,5,B000GIW9GO,Wonderful movie. Michael Weatherly and Christian Kane did a wonderful job along side Estella Warren. Can't wait until my copy gets delivered to my house.,1435968000,,153,5.16
2614000,4,B000GIW9GO,Entertaining but I wish the main actress hadn't had her upper lip Botoxed. Distracting.,1435190400,,87,5.285714285714286

2614011,3,B000GIW9GO,"The premise of this movie was kind of far-fetched in that I don't think a town would suddenly explode over the news that someone is a virgin, let alone for the time span this story seems to cover, and also fairly predictable. If you get past those things, though, it was really sweet with some very amusing moments.",1412899200,,315,4.448275862068965

2614017,1,B000GIW9GO,Was so bad we watched only about 10 minutes and turned it off...four gold stars should signify something worth watching...,1398038400,2,122,5.15
2614018,3,B000GIW9GO,"Enjoyed it mostly for Christian Kane. Silly, goofy movie but still fun to watch. Lead actress not impressive but rest of supporting cast good",1397088000,,141,4.916666666666667
2614019,5,B000GIW9GO,"First, Estella Warren has the best lips. With that out of the way, it was a formulaic, good comedy where you smile while watching the movie. Estella's character is ""ready"" so it's not a bunch of will they, won't they to distract from the movie. Instead, it opens with her planning the virginal romantic getaway only to have an A-hole boyfriend mess things up and the comedy ensues from here.

Oddly, my favorite relationship wasn't fully explored. It was the relationship between Jeanna (Warren) and the firefighters who seemed to be willing to help her get revenge on her A-hole ex. This means that there was more of a big-brother(s) friendship that wasn't unpacked. Too bad because it seemed like it was cute.",1391990400,,711,4.780487804878049
2614020,3,B000GIW9GO,...Christian Kane...yum.  Worth the price just to look at him.  His Sensitive Paul character is not nearly as interesting as Bad-Ass Eliot but the boy is hot.,1391299200,,158,4.814814814814815
2614021,3,B000GIW9GO,"It was ok, I was hoping it would have been better though. It was worth the money for an evening's entertainment, but not something we'll watch over and over.",1380672000,,157,4.448275862068965
2614022,5,B000GIW9GO,"It was so enjoyable to watch a lovely , romantic, light and  humerus  movie.  No beat them up or bad language. Just delightful .  Christian Kane and cast were the right pick.  I know I will watch it many times. Thank you  Susan",1374969600,,227,4.162790697674419
2614023,5,B000GIW9GO,The cartoons and music at the beginning started me thinking this movie was going to be dumb.  Once Christian Kane came on the screen I was very happy with the movie.  He is one of my favorite actors.  He could do a movie reading the phone book and I would watch it.,1373241600,,265,4.0576923076923075
2614024,1,B000GIW9GO,"We relied on the number of stars given this movie and on the trailer. Unfortunately, the only good scenes (such as they were) were in the trailer. The movie sleep-walked through a series of brief episodes that made engagement with the characters virtually impossible. The script was derivative, borrowing from much better movies, and the directing and editing were poor. We were also distracted by the main character's being dressed in high school tops and skirts that revealed her middle instead of decent adult attire. We decided the director did that because the actress is not particularly beautiful and he was trying to give her some sex appeal. Unfortunately, we never succeeded in liking her character. The final outcome was predictable from the point when we met the man she ends up with. This movie is not worth the time you'd spend watching it.",1370217600,3,854,4.9375
2614025,5,B000GIW9GO,Good movie ! Will watch any movie with her playing any part. She is very down to earth and girl next door beautiful !,1370131200,,117,3.9166666666666665
2614026,3,B000GIW9GO,"It's a typical chick flick.  One dimensional characters and lame, obvious plot twists.  This director, I think, was atttempting touse unique camera angles for some of the shots but they mostly consisted of close up of Estrella Warren's body.  Good booty does not substitute for talent.  The bright spot was Christian Kane.  He CAN act as well as he looks and he looks damn good!  Worth the rental just for him.",1369612800,,410,4.704225352112676
2614027,5,B000GIW9GO,Being a Christian Kane fan and a Michael Wetherly fan this was a must watch!!!  It made you laugh and it made you cry!!!  What more could you ask for in a classic chick-flick????,1368489600,,178,4.205882352941177
2614028,3,B000GIW9GO,"This is a cute movie, all the characters are great except the female lead! :(  The poor girl can not act.",1365379200,,105,4.0
2614029,5,B000GIW9GO,bought movie for christian kane wasn't disappointed. it  has a made for tv movie feel but otherwise a good movie.,1362096000,,113,4.65
2614030,5,B000GIW9GO,"I would never have known about this movie if it weren't for Christian Kane.  Loved it!  He finally gets to play a lead role, and does an outstanding job!  Michael Weatherly's character is someone you just want to give a Gibbs' slap, as he plays his obnoxious part equally well, as does Estella Warren as Jeana... Great movie, all around!",1359331200,12,337,4.583333333333333
2614031,1,B000GIW9GO,"I came across this one on one of the movie channels...thank God I didn't get this as a pay per view. First off, Warren is not a competent enough actress to pull off any lead role. So, when a producer and/or director cast an 'actress' like that, you can usually expect a run of the mill script, chainsaw editing, highly unbelievable situations, and/or poorly developed characters. This movie manages all of that.

Just another trite, overdone, weak attempt at romantic comedy. Perhaps the genre in itself is a dinosaur.

You'd be better off spending your time watching paint dry.",1322697600,2,578,4.828282828282828
2614032,2,B000GIW9GO,"While watching this movie I got the odd sense of watching a porno not because of any sex scenes (there aren't any) but rather because the acting seems like porno quality. I'm not usually a big critic of acting in romantic comedies, but in this movie it just really bothered me. I couldn't get beyond that to the movie. Not that there was much else to the movie as it was a pretty banal plot.",1318809600,4,391,4.226666666666667
2614033,5,B000GIW9GO,"I remember seeing this movie on new release shelves, however I passed it by because I did not know anyone in it or saw a trailer for it. NOW I watch NCIS and Leverage and thus know BOTH the male leads. I rented it on a Friday night and watched it no less than 7 times and ordered a copy before it was due on Wednesday. This movie is hilarious. The plot seems silly with a reporter accidentally telling the city (and beyond) that his girlfriend is a virgin but it makes a great launch point. Everyone contributes to the humor and greatness in this movie. When I think of my favorite scenes or parts-they are varied and nearly everyone is a part of at least one. It was great to see Christian Kane in a goofy fish out water sweetheart role, Michael Weatherly is SO good at playing a narcissistic idiot and Estella is just awesome. One of my faves has to be Rachel Dratch as the men hating roommate who gives her opinion that killing or maiming the guys is always the best course of action. I tell people if you liked Someone Like You-this is even better! There isn't a part of this movie I didn't like. The running gags are great too and done perfectly so as not to get overbearing. I dare you not to laugh at least once! Easily one of my absolute favorites.",1298592000,6,1256,4.2375
2614034,5,B000GIW9GO,I order this movie when I heard Christian Kane was in it. I have been watching Leverage and have since become a huge fan of him. I read the distription on the back and I thought I would not like the subject matter. But after veiwing the movie it has quickly be come one of my favorites. Michael Weatherly was very good in this movie. He played his character well. As I watched it I was rooting for Christian Kane's Paul the whole time. I have recommended it to all my friends. It is a must watch for any Kane Fan.,1296259200,,513,4.089108910891089
2614035,3,B000GIW9GO,This is about a dumb guy who tell hundreds of thousands of people on national television(he's a news reporter) that his girlfriend is a virgin. Instead of just apologizing they end up just playing games with each other over some vacation tickets that they had purchased together and one of the dumb guy's co-workers(a photographer) steals her away from him.,1295308800,,357,4.966666666666667
2614036,5,B000GIW9GO,"This movie REALLY tells the story about what women want from the MAN were dating.  It was a great movie, filled with at least one character we can all relate to.",1295049600,,161,4.193548387096774
2614037,5,B000GIW9GO,"I bought this movie because I'm a fan of NCIS and Leverage and it featured Michael Weatherly and Christian Kane.

Basically you can fast forward through all the scenes that don't have Christian in them. It's not that there is anything wrong with the rest of the movie. It's just that, those scenes are so good... from the charming boy who is lost and who abandons his old VW on the sidewalk while he goes for gas, to the artist showing his photography, to the guy trying to be ""just a friend,"" and then oh! When he gets to finally use those lips.  To say more would spoil it. Nothing else matters. Especially the watching the movie scene and the talking in the intercom scene and the holding my head in my hands scene.",1290556800,2,718,4.350746268656716
2614038,5,B000GIW9GO,"It's another story of men vs. women, or you could call it Men are from Mars & Women are from Venus. I never heard of this movie, but I got it because Christian Kane is so cute & I love him in the show Leverage. The movie is cute, funny, romantic, & love wins out in the end. I'm a sucker for a happy ending. This movie will make you laugh, it'll make you smile, and you'll be happy at the end.",1277596800,,393,3.8048780487804876

2614040,4,B000GIW9GO,"Estella Warren plays a computer professional who is (at the beginning of the movie) dating Michael Weatherly, a television news anchor, who just doesn't get it.  He keeps trying to get Estelle in bed, who unbeknownst to  him is still a virgin at 27. After she reveals her secret, he accidentally spills her ""minor thing"" on national tv. Problems arise, and then it happens...in comes Christian Kane, who bumps into Estelle at a coffee shop(?), and it's instant chemistry. This movie, although the writing can be overall weak at times, is actually one of the better movies I've seen in quite a long while. The 3 main actors really bring the story to life.  It is very enjoyable to watch again and again. And Christian Kane? All I can say is OMG. THE finest. I would recommend this movie for: (1) people who are tired of movies that feel the need to swear every other sentence, (2) want a lighthearted romantic comedy they can watch over and over, and (3) definitely anyone who is an avid Christian Kane fan will love this movie. It will make you wish you were Estelle Warren.",1256256000,12,1074,4.583333333333333
