8362804,5,B002C0SIKA,Great deal as it gives you 2 good movies (BluRay at that) at a very reasonable cost. Can't beat a deal like this for a full afternoon or evening of movies for less than the cost of a theater ticket.,1361404800,,198,3.975
8362805,3,B002C0SIKA,"These are two Hallmark mini-series packaged together.  They're not great art but I didn't hate them as much as other reviewers.  Supernova is about our own sun having a bad day with some top scientists thinking it will go supernova.  In the extras we get interviews with the actors and director.  The director said he decided to set it in Australia to make it truley global in scope.  This really hurt the film because some elements are very specific to the US... like a serial killer getting the death sentence or a witness buying a gun for protection.  Despite the many flaws I thought it was watchable.  I also found something to applaud... the actor who portrays the serial killer really did a great job.  I give Supernova 3 stars.

*2013 edit*  I just watched Supernova for the second time.  The science is very bad, but I enjoyed it anyway.  It will be a few years before I go for a third watch, but I'm sure the time will come.  The FX (which are digital) still hold up.  They are very good for a TV movie.

I take a dim view of remakes.  When you remake The Poseidon Adventure you invite comparison with the original and you eliminate too much surprise.  This remake is weak.  Hallmark suddenly cared about improbable science and changed the cause to a terrorist attack rather than a mid-ocean tidal wave.  The cover says it has 40 minutes of unseen footage.  I'm not sure that they did us a favor.  This cast and this budget would have been better spent on some original material.  This is a weaker film and I only give it 2 stars.

Two films in blu-ray for only $17.00 as of this writing?  I think it was a fair deal.  I'm still building mu blu-ray collection and I kinda like these double features.  On the other hand, I don't expect great films with these double features either.  If you are only after 4 or 5 stars films, keep looking.  But if you have room in your collection for a couple of B movies maybe this set is worth a shot.",1265932800,2,1946,4.360335195530726
8362806,2,B002C0SIKA,"When movies are doubled-up, such as this pair, it kinda makes you wonder what the motives are. Supernova/ Poseidon Adventure are two films that deserve each other, but are truly a waste of time to watch and a waste of money poorly spent.
Here are two movies that failed to sell well, so the studio decided to pair them up in hopes the two together would bring in $$$$ for their bottom line.
The original Poseidon Adventure was an excellent film. This version is trash from beginning to end. Supernova is not even a tic better. Save your time & money, and forget this pair.",1264550400,,572,4.457142857142857
