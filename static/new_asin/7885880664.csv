7900529,5,7885880664,"This is one of my favorite movies (although loosely adapted from Gide's story--but it's silly to argue that cinema is cinema). The acting and direction are superb--and I wonder why Criterion Collection never had the guts to issue this brilliant film (it won the Palme d'Or)--and the utter stupidity to release a nutty one such as ""Brazil""--well, no accounting for taste, kiddo.",1215648000,6,377,5.096774193548387
7900530,3,7885880664,La Symphonie Pastorale depicts the tale of a pasteur who takes in a young blind girl (Gertrude).  The story concerns the ramifications of his involvement in her education and her life.  The film sides on the melodramatic and certain physical qualites of both the Pasteur and Gertrude make their roles difficult to believe.,984355200,4,322,5.056603773584905
