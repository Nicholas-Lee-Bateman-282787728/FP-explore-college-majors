7993191,2,B00009VPI7,"Well just the name of the film will give you a hint that this film is cheesy......and by the way the film studio that produced this film was Cheesy Studios.  I gave it a rating of two because it is a vampire flick and I feel that just to watch a vampire flick deserves a 2.  The acting was rather dull with most scenes being down right droll in nature.  the dialogue was humdrum and there were several times that I really wanted to just move on to a different movie.  There were some slightly comical parts; but they were few and far between.  By the by the copy of this film was a sub standard copy.  If you are an avid fan of vampire flicks, than you will be the only one that would be desiring to watch it just to see how it measures up to all the other vampire flicks out there.  And yes there are several others out there that would receive a minimal rating of 2 and as I said in the beginning that is just to give honor to the vampire realm of films.  If you are looking to study the film for a class project, than I am sure that you will have a tough time not wanting to move on to your next project.  If you are some one who is a fan of cheesy films than this one will still be at the bottom of your favorites.",1420416000,,1218,3.9186991869918697

movies! He's made some great and not so great movies but always
gave great performances much like Bela Lugosi! He starred in
many of the Universal Horror Movies and even played Dracula!
This movie made in his later years is still great! It was cheap
made but still better than most B movies of the time. I'm sure
most people today would laugh but I think it's a classic movie!
It's well written funny and moves fast. You can't take it as a
serious Dracula movie. If you like old westerns and horror then
this is the movie to get! I use to watch on the 10:30 sunday
morning movie with other classics from the 60's and I loved it
and still do. I'm watching it now that's why I wanted to see if
it was available. I have a good vhs copy sorry to see the dvd is
not better. too bad I was hoping for widescreen. anyway I say get
it and watch it with the kids. this is old classic movie making.",1299110400,,950,4.112903225806452
