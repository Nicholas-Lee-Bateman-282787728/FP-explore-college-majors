Leslie Groves is not included. Niels Bohr is a cameo role. There are plenty of spies and military police. There are a few soap opera side issues.

7583725,5,B019WJ6W88,"Excellent! Great script, excellent acting. Yes it has ""hollywood trappings"" i.e. many of the nurses are prostitutes on the side, one lesbian relationship goes on w/ one star character. Those things might turn off the real WWII vets but gotta do it to compete w/ today's TV. There is no Interpol in 1943 but so what. And for the prop master, I did catch a mistake. I happened to pause ""a diner scene"" and what do I see but a post year 2000 stainless steel tea dispenser in a 1943 diner. HA! Bet I'm the only one to catch that one. And some gripe the uniforms are off. WWII vet's way in on this? Nevertheless. Ignore the mistakes and just fall in love with these characters that are as genius as the characters in Mad Men. Actually this is Mad Men in the desert! The show sends me to Google constantly looking for ""Nuclear Science for Dummies!"" Serious. I've learned so much about how ""the gadget"" actually works due to this genius TV mini-series drama. Oh one more for the prop master. I can't resist even though I'm a huge fan. Notice the electrical power lines. The crew only made it about 200' long. If you watch the cars and jeeps go down the dirt road, the power line abruptly ends. Caught ya. HA again. But guess the budget had it's limits. I understand.",1456617600,6,1259,4.384615384615385

7583727,5,B019WJ6W88,"WGN's Manhattan is one of the best period pieces in the last decade
It's also one of the most overlooked

It runs circles around Mad Men

If you enjoyed season one for what it is and don't over analyse the story
You'll love season two
Three new cast members make guest appearances in season two
 William Petersen  (Col. Emmett Darrow)  This is one of the first times i hated a character Peterson has played mostly cause Col. Darrow is in no way a good person
Mamie Gummer  (Nora) This is a different role for Mamie it's very dark
Neve Campbell  (Kitty Oppenheimer)

The two major negatives about season two
 Frank Winter  ( John Benjamin Hickey) isn't in enough of this season mostly cause this season is the story of other key characters from season one
The other negative would be the way the season is constructed
The opening of season two is 45 minutes before the season finale
Then it goes backwards a year before the night they test the bomb
During this season there are glimpses into that night with new clues and info being thrown at you!
(This is by no means as manic and confusing as Legends Season two) But, it messes up the flow of everything going on
If you thought you knew any of these characters after the end of season one
You'll be surprised there's a lot of interesting backstory to everyone
Rachel Brosnahan  (Abby Isaacs)
Christopher Denham  (Jim Meeks)
Olivia Williams  (Liza Winter)
Harry Lloyd  (Paul Crosley)
Ashley Zukerman  (Charlie Isaacs)
These 5 actors are  phenomenal and add so much quality to the story

This is one of those series that holds a mirror at ""us"" living in 2015/2016
It has a deep and very dark social commentary
These real scientist wanted to have powers like a God and look where the world ended up
World War II wasn't the last major war
We are no better from that time up until now
Nothing has really changed for the greater good/better
If you love American history this series is amazing the production values on all the authentic clothes, hair, music  and everything in between
is awe inspiring it's like going into a time machine  10/10",1452384000,17,2088,4.564516129032258

7583737,4,B019WJ6W88,"My wife and I really liked Season 1 of Manhattan.  It had all sorts of things going for it: intrigue, history, science and secrecy.  Season 2 however, doesn't fare so well.  It's all over the board with too many sidebar stories to make it cohesive.  The central story is still the development and subsequent building and testing of the first atomic bomb.  Substories include Oppenheimer's mistress, lesbian lovers, several murders, a couple who-dunnits and treason.

The acting is mostly solid with the best performance by one of the most unlikely cast members, Michael Chernus, who plays Louis 'Fritz' Fedowitz.  From the moment he enters the scene to the last scene of the series he is the most believable of all the characters.  There are many suppositions to this series but mostly it's enjoyable.  Certainly, Season One stands out as a winner with Season Two closing the door, never to open again.",1487289600,2,902,4.920529801324503

7583740,5,B019WJ6W88,"This is one of the most fascinating and enjoyable series I have viewed in the last few years.  It is terrific fiction within the constraints of what really happened in the development of the atomic bomb.  The ethical and moral issues, the stress on all the scientists, the tension with the military--all provide an exciting, and totally unpredictable action line.  We liked it so much, instead of watching one episode a night as we ususall do, some evenings we watch two and once three,  It was too exciting to stop.",1485734400,2,516,4.7

7583743,5,B019WJ6W88,"My wife and I watched both seasons of 'Manhattan' on Hulu. We are both in agreement that this short lived series is among the finest to have ever aired on TV. The writing and acting in this show, is about as good as it gets.

Since I have a great interest in, and have read a lot of books on the Manhattan Project, I was thrilled to discover that this series had been made. The show is absolutely riveting, and is so interesting, that each episode seems to go by in an instant.

With so many mediocre shows on TV, it's sad when a series of this caliber gets cancelled, due to low ratings. With that said, I'm happy that I was at least able to watch with thorough delight, the 23 episodes that were produced.

If you like period pieces, and have any interest in the lives of those who participated in the Manhattan Project, you'll no doubt agree that this is among the finest shows of this type ever made. The lives of the scientists, their families, and the secrets they had to keep, make for an epic storyline.

Living in the middle of the New Mexico desert, working on the most highly classified project in the world, certainly took its toll on all those involved. The manner in which the lives of all are intertwined, and the incredible acting performances by all, make you feel as if you're part of the actual scene.

This is a TV series not to be missed. In addition to the outstanding writing and acting, the cinematography is simply breathtaking. In addition, the automobiles of the 1930's and 1940's are interesting in their own right. I cannot recommend a TV series any higher than this. It just doesn't get any better.

The bottom line is that 'Manhattan', will leave you wanting for more. After you finish watching this series, it will take a while to find something else worth your time. This is one of those shows, like 'Breaking Bad,' where everything you watch afterwards is a letdown. That's how great it is.",1480204800,,1924,4.467236467236467

Manhattan is a must for everybody interested in one of the major historic events that took place in the 20th century. Director Shaw really gave a heart to all who contributed to this project, and the acting of the cast is wonderful.

7583762,2,B019WJ6W88,"If I were rating just Season 1, I would have rated this 3 stars. But Season 2 is simply ridiculous. Do the writers know anything about science, or scientists? Or the project itself (of which Manhattan was only one of 3 prongs)? A history-changing ""gadget"" is being built, but among all the soap opera, there's NOBODY ACTUALLY BUILDING THE BOMB!  Season 1 at least allowed for artistic license in that there was some relationship to actual events. Why do writers bother to try to connect with an actual event when they run so far afield of it for the sake of soap-opera theatrics that it insults the truth far too much to be called ""artistic license"". The real shame is that the truth, such that it is known anyway, is a very interesting story on its own.",1462924800,,754,4.5036496350364965

8746056,5,B019WJ6W88,"The discs come in plastic snap cases. They play fine.

The Manhattan series is terrific. I love period shows that take a little history and make it dramatic fiction, in other words, they breathe life into the subject, make it interesting. If you like Manhattan (2014-2015) you might like Granite Flats (2013-2015) or Taken (2002). All three series are set during WWII or shortly after. They are about secret government programs. Manhattan is about making the first atomic bomb, like the movie Fat Man and Little Boy (1989). Taken is about UFOs and alien visitors, sort of a fictionalized version of Project Blue Book. And Granite Flats is about the experimental drug program MKUltra (the CIA mind control program).

All three series have great story arcs. They start and finish strong and have great middles. One difference is the smoking and drinking. There is smoking and drinking in almost every scene in Manhattan, which was set during the era when soldiers received packs of cigarettes with their meal rations. Ever been around a chain smoker? In Taken theres a scene where Crawford says his doctor prescribed cigarettes for hypertension. Imagine that. I don't remember any smoking in Granite Flats, but that might just be my poor memory.

If the above don't sound interesting you might like a couple of space race shows. I spent a month on a space race binge. First I read Space by James A. Michener. Then I watched two movies, The Right Stuff (1983) and Apollo 13 (1995), and then two great series, From Earth to the Moon (1998) and The Astronauts Wives Club (2015). Theyre a great combination.

If the above shows don't sound interesting here are a few of the series I really enjoyed watching more than once. I love good miniseries like Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000) because they have beginnings, middles and endings, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek The Original Series (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish, or the hundreds of other fantasy and science fiction shows Ive watched.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520812800,,2925,5.212765957446808
