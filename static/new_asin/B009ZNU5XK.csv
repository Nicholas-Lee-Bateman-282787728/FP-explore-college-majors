8545762,5,B009ZNU5XK,I liked the movie.  It had a good plot and some twist and turns in it to keep you guessing on who the murder was.  Just didn't like it because of who the murderer was.  (If I say why it would give it away who it was).,1411862400,,217,3.574468085106383

I'm a Stephen Dillane fan and looked forward to seeing this.  I guess my
only real complaint would be the price.  It was a newly released movie
on DVD  (from the UK)  when I purchased it and it was pricey.  Having said
that, I would definitely recommend it!",1360972800,2,333,4.125
8545764,3,B009ZNU5XK,"Set in the run up to the Olympic Games this is a London based gang and crime story. The title of the film is the name of a fictional gang living in a fictional part of London, South Wood. One of the gang members gets arrested and charged with shooting his friend. His world of fashion sister, Deeva (Parminder Nagra - `Bend It like Beckham') then comes back from Paris to try to help him, and she turns into a regular Sherlock overnight.

This is a stylish film and all of the actors put in convincing performances, and I really wanted to like this. There is a but; and that is it falls down on facts, there are plot holes and a sugar coated ending that would be better placed on `Scooby Doo'. The sex scenes are far from impressive too and if the police really were as bad as portrayed here, I would take up international drug dealing too.

So sorry guys, whilst this is entertaining on a certain level, it most certainly is not an excellent film. The action is done well, the production does not seem to lack because of budget, this is down to the actual plot. I do appreciate independent films, especially British efforts, but this could have been better, hence my rating.",1355270400,3,1175,4.385321100917431
