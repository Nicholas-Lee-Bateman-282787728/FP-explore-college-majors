3077281,5,B0012680BM,"I never saw the entire series on TV unfortunatly. I only had Vol. 6 on VHS and I watched it nonstop. I did have a couple of the toys (K.O. Kruiser, Gun Grinner and Trailblazer). Now being on DVD, I get a 2nd chance at watching the entire series. I can't wait for Vol. 2! My favortie thing about the cartoon was the music performed by Haim Saban and Shuki Levy. The intro and ending songs are awesome! Thank you ""Shout Factory"" for bringing this classic back into the 21st century. ""LIGHTNING STRIKES""!",1212624000,,501,4.397849462365591
3077282,5,B0012680BM,"I will admit a huge bias right off - I LOVED this show when I was a kid!!!  Unfortunately Jayce came in at the end of the wave of the ""toy"" shows of the 80's, such as Transformers and He-Man, and got lost in the shuffle.  The premise and characters are definitely borrowed from ""Star Wars"", but the writers also were able to come up with some cool original storylines.  Wheeled Warriors showcases a lot of bonuses that may have been missed - good animation, laughable dialog, and an amazing cheesy soundtrack.  Seriously, if you don't love the theme song, then you REALLY don't love the 80's!  This series actually got me interested in anime - BEFORE anime was really known in the States.  Now that anime is pretty much commonplace, the charm of this series seems lost and almost insignificant against the mass-produced and ubiquitous fare of now.  If you're a Gen-Xer and are feeling nostalgic, definitely give Jayce a try!",1210032000,,924,4.666666666666667
3077283,5,B0012680BM,"I am glad that Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors has made it to a DVD collection.  It is one of my all time favorite cartoon series.  It has substance and depth that I find lacking in today's cartoons.  The characters are realistic and believable, lending themselves to the story.

The setup for this story is the best I have ever seen.  Audric, Jayce's father, is a botanist and has been trying to grow plants that will end hunger everywhere.  Just as he succeeds, a solar flare emits radiation that changes his plants into Monster Minds, the evil plants led by Saw Boss.  Audric develops a Magic Root to end the threat but the Monster Minds take over his laboratory before he can unite it.  Audric gives half to his servent Oon, to take to his son Jayce and escapes the lab.

Oon makes it to Jayce and gives him the half of the Magic Root Amulet.  Jayce and company (Gillian, Flora, Oon, and Herc Stormsailor) with their armored fighting vehicles become the Lightning League and set out to find Audric and unite the root that will end the threat of Saw Boss and the Monster Minds forever.  I hope that the second volume will be available soon.",1209254400,,1142,4.468599033816425
3077284,5,B0012680BM,"When ordering this volume I was really skeptical, I was wondering if they were going to really put together a good volume of this show.  It is one of the more obscure and older shows.  But overall I am very pleased.
When ordering these volumes, you always have to check the amount of minutes to make sure that it was worth the price.  It totally was, and the memories from watching it as a child really started coming back.  The clean up was great on it the shows, I was very pleased with the volume.",1208908800,,500,4.231578947368421

3077287,5,B0012680BM,"I recently purchased the rag-tag collection of 3 episodes plus a ""bonus"" 4th, but that was a year ago and it was the only bit of Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors availible.  Now finally we get to see the whole first season with all the characters we remembered in the 80's.  I remember this being my favorite cartoon on TV at that time and aside from Transformers, nothing else mattered.  Jayce is a Luke Skywalker rip-off but who cares?  His unique land vehicle command is what makes him unigue.  In additon to the Thundercats, this is the other animation DVD I have been waiting to purchase.  Herc the Jerc is the likable character as in Han Solo clone, yet he is awesome as a horseback rider and has some other qualities Han Solo didn't. Odviously, Herc was voiced by a guy experienced in D.J. radio or a sports caster as his voice is that quality. Jayce's side-kick Oone is a miniture cavalier who is annoying more than funny.  Flora is a young plant/human girl hybrid and the fish named Broc, is even weirder.  The wizard utilises magic and science in equal measure proving they are one(as in ether I suppose).  Other characters(NPCs) are more interesting in these tapes than in the mere foursome collction I was milked for, where mostly the regulars appeared.  I assume the rest of the series will soon be out!  Don't settle for ""difinitive collections"" but seasons.",1202428800,3,1370,4.643153526970955
3077288,5,B0012680BM,"""Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors"" was one of my favorite 80s animated series. It's right up there with ""ThunderCats"" -- that good! But ""Jayce"" was rather overlooked compared to the likes of ""ThunderCats"", ""He-Man"", ""She-Ra"", ""Voltron"" and many other good animated series of that decadent decade.
""Jayce"" has very good storytelling for starters: the basic premise is about a scientist named Audric (Jayce's father) who nearly succeded with ending starvation and hunger in vast star systems with the creation of genetically-engineered vegetation. Out of the blue, a cosmic explosion occurs and causes Audric's creations to wildly mutate into creatures with evil brains (called Monster Minds). Audric had to flee his laboratory with one half of a magical relic called ""The Root"" (Jayce somehow has the other half) that, when fused, would revert the evil creations and their machinations back to harmless vegetation. Jayce, with the help of an old and wise wizard named Gillian, an empathic girl named Flora, and an intergalactic traveling merchant named Herc Stormsailor, sets out to search for his father before the Monster Minds take over the universe. And I can't forget Jayce's little companion, a robot squire named Oon who believes his lance is ""magic"" (which adds a degree of cuteness to what is otherwise dramatic and thrilling stories).
""Jayce"" was among J. Michael Strasyncski's (""of ""Babylon 5"" fame) first major efforts at sci-fi storytelling and was also co-producer of this series. It also has great music by Shuki Levy and Haim Saban (some of the most talented musicians for animated fare), and is pretty nicely animated by DIC (the creators of ""M.A.S.K."", ""Inspector Gadget"" and ""Where On Earth is Carmen Sandiego?).
I think ""Jayce"" is a timeless series and is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, especially if you are a fan of 80s toons, or any 80s TV program for that matter.",1201392000,27,1873,5.144262295081967

3077322,3,B0012680BM,"It was great to relive some childhood memories but the lackluster video quality ruined what could have been a nostalgic trip through time.  Pixelation cluttered the screen and the video quality was blurry and lacked a sort of mastered quality.  I felt the Betamax copy they used must have been worn out from so much use or something but it was sad to see something so beloved degraded and callously thrown onto a DVR and sold without any sign of wanting to try and clean up the visuals at all.  This is a great collection of the first episodes of Jayce and the sound quality is perfect but the video quality suffers a lot and really is hard to overlook if your looking to relive those childhood days.  There is no extras no making of no interviews this is barebones early youtube quality recordings that really could use a touch up.

I don't recommend it if your a person who wants near perfection

3077325,5,B0012680BM,"Anybody remember USA's Cartoon Express? Man, I loved that programming when I was a kid. This show was on it at one point in time. Considering it was cobbled together to sell toys they did a great job with it. The people who were involved with making it wanted to make the best show they could with the material they had, and it shows. Yeah, it's cheesy but it's some awesome velveeta. The story is about the titular Jayce, he of the skunky hairdo on the cover there. His father is superscientist Audric (also skunky haired so that you can easily see the family resemblance) and Audric's specialty is botany. Some time in the past that is never mentioned on this show, Jayce lost his mother, so Audric made Jayce a little sister out of plants; the little redhaired girl Flora that you see on the cover. Flora can talk to plants and has a giant floating pet fish because: reasons. Audric also has a robot squire assistant named Oon because, why not? Oon is the comic relief in most episodes. As the show starts, Jayce is kind of petulant because Audric never has time to spend with him, but he better step up because Audric just accidentally made the Monster Minds, so things are about to get real. So, Audric accidentally makes sentient plants bent on world domination while trying to find a cure for hunger. It's kind of funny how quickly he decides they are evil, but I guess anyone would be alarmed if their plants suddenly started growing out of control. Audric hares off to find the other half of a magic root that will stop the Monster Minds that he accidentally unleashed on an unsuspecting galaxy. He leaves Jayce and Flora in the care of  his mentor, a wizard scientist named Gillian. Gillian is a character in the mold of Gandalf and Dumbledore. Why there are wizards in space is never explored, but Gillian tells Jayce he needs to guard his half of the magic root and use the Ring of Light to save as many people as he can from Monster Minds while they try to catch up to Audric. They enlist the help of a space pirate named Herc Stormsailer to ferry them around on this errand. Herc is in the mold of Han Solo. I did always like Herc's ship, the Pride of the Skies II. It looks like a galley ship except the sails are solar panels. Every time Jayce and his group encounter Monster Minds, they wind up in a fight using armored vehicles that they store in the ship's hold when not in use. The armored vehicles were the toys that this whole cartoon was built around. I think you can see why the toys didn't sell as well as the company had hoped. They show up in every episode, but there's a whole lot of stuff going on that has nothing to do with them. The cartoon lives on as TV junk food of the highest order. This first group of episodes sets up the premise and is not the best that were ever produced. The show gets a lot better as it goes on.",1404950400,,2855,4.326492537313433

There have been only a couple of episodes that were a little washed out. But it's not because of compression. This show is almost 30 years old.

3077374,5,B0012680BM,"Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors Volume 1 is another DVD that I won in a recent giveaway. I didn't recognize the name or the cover art. It wasn't until I played the first episode that I finally, more like vaguely, remembered the show, as I was a four-year-old when it aired on television. Actually, I don't recall much about the show, but I do the toys, which were released by Mattel before the show was created. Mattel needed a way to explain the strange looking silver vehicles and the even stranger looking organic/machine vehicles, thus Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors was created. Talented writes such as Larry DiTillio, Barbara Hambly and J. Michael Straczynski, creator of Babylon 5, wrote most the episodes.

Here is the series main plot: Audric, a botanist, was experimenting with biotechnology, and developed a crop that could grow in any environment.  A burst of radiation from a solar flare mutated one of his crops, transforming it an evil creature called Saw Boss. The other plants transformed as well and were called the Monster Minds. Audric created a magic root to destroy Saw Boss, but time was not on his side as his laboratory is being attacked. He splits the magical root in half and gives the other half of it to his faithful servant, Oon. He commands Oon to take the root to his son, Jayce, and serve under his command.

Oon (a magically animated suit of armor servant) finds Jacye along with Gillian (a wizard/scientist), and Flora, who was created from a flower by Audric. With the help of a Han Solo ripoff character, Herc Stormsailor - a pilot and  mercenary, they become known as the Lightning League. They use their ground vehicles to battle the Monster Minds vehicles, that are grown from vines. The Lightning League travels to planet to planet by the Pride of the Skies II, Herc's space barge, as Jayce searches for his missing father.

Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors definitely has that 80s feel to it, along with the catchy pop rock theme song. Obviously, the show had one purpose - sell the toy line. The talented writers took a silly premise and did what they could with it, giving us an original science fiction cartoon. Now thanks to Cookie Jar, a division of Mill Creek Entertainment, old fans can watch the series again and introduce the Lightning League to a new generation. Despite each episode being similar (searching for Jayce's father on a new planet, Saw Boss and his minions show up, and they battle it out with their vehicles. Sadly, the series never got a conclusion as it was cancelled before a movie could go into production. I enjoyed revisiting Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors, and I can't wait for Volume 2 to be released.",1337731200,11,2672,4.71306209850107
3077375,5,B0012680BM,I just got the set in the mail earlier today and i'm hooked. My only previous exposure to Jayce and the wheeled warriors comes from clips of the theme song I saw on youtube. I've watched the first 4 episodes and imo this show has aged far better than most other 80's cartoons like Thundercats or Voltron. The dialog is pretty awkward but the characters are still likeable enough that you actually care what happens to them. The music is epic and the animation is anime quality.,1332979200,4,477,4.494252873563219
3077376,5,B0012680BM,"I am very satisfied with this purchased. The show is exactly how I remember it and the overall quality of the product Mill Creek has put out beats all of my expectations. In addition, the price is stellar for what you get. Although the packaging is somewhat unorthodox, I actually like it better than a standard multi-disc case.

1). Quality - Very good compared to cobbled together version I purchased from EBAY years ago, but not remastered.

I was a huge fan of Jayce as a child and the DVD version does not disappoint. Please note that this is the original cartoon as aired on TV NOT a remastered version. This is stated in the product description, so I was not surprised, instead I was pleased with how good it looks. The image and sound quality is good and true to my memory of the show. In fact, I would say that current TV technology ability to render deeper and richer colors actual enhances the experience even though the material is unmodified from the original. The manufacturer has included a disc menu that helps to bring up favorite episodes (it also plays the closing theme song!)

2). Delivery - Quoted long at first, but came in within 7 business days.

When I first made this purchase, Amazon informed me that this DVD set would arrive 2 - 3 weeks. In my opinion this was very long wait, but only a few days later I received an update that my package was being prepared for shipment and I could expect it in a few days. True to their word, the package arrived soon after (within 7 business days of my original order). I am not sure if this is a factor of incomplete production updates between Amazon and Mill Creek or if the total volume of orders is less/more than expected, but I am happy to have recieved my order within a resonable time frame. This could also have been due to the Print on Demand style of production.

3). Packaging - Very good for the cost.

The set comes in a sturdy DVD box. The 32 episodes are split among 3 DVD's with 11 episodes per DVD (note that the 11th episode on disc 1 is a bonus episode of C.O.P.S.). Each disc is stored in a separate disc envelope and the interior of the DVD box has special bumpers and hooks that hold all 3 of these envelopes securely in place. I have seen similar box interiors where there are two large clamps that you slide the DVD underneath to hold it down. This set up is nothing like that, you bend the corners of the envelope (where there is no DVD to rub) underneath the hooks and between the bumpers. Again, this is somewhat unorthodx, but I like it.

I am worried that dirt and dust will get into the envelope and scratch my disc, but the jury is still out on this (come on folks - its still new!)

4). Overall - If you are a fan of Jayce, 80's and or 90's cartoons, cartoons in general, or mechanic wizards, plant girls, flying fish and space lightening - just buy it, you'll be happy you did.",1330646400,10,2878,4.326530612244898

Mill Creek Entertainment asked us to share with you that they're working on a pair of early 2012 releases for Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors, currently scheduled - for the time being, anyway (they could move) - for a street date of February 14th. This sweetheart of a Valentine's Day gift will either be the low-cost 32-episode collection of Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors - Volume 1 on 3 DVDs, or you can instead get the even-lower-cost 10-episode ""Best Of"" title on a single disc. Word is to expect the second volume shortly afterward, hopefully with the rest of the show's 65-episode run!

3077379,5,B0012680BM,"I remember watching this show when I was ten years old and my enjoyment of it hasn't diminished at all. The main premise of this show is that the Lightning League is out to rid the universe of the monster minds. The monster minds are vehicle/plant hynrids that are out to destroy and take over other worlds. They were accidentally created by Jayce's father. Jayce and his crew travel the universe in a spaceship shaped like a pirate ship to search for his father to reunite two parts of a magic root in order to eliminate the monster minds once and for all. Jayce's crew consists of a centuries old wizard, a plant/girl hybrid, a mercenary, a walking suit of armor and a huge flying fish. They have a variety of vehicles equipped with a claw, a drill, a spiked wheel and various types of guns. The monster minds vehicles are equipped with saws, wrecking balls, bolos, snake heads and guns. The crew go to many different planets throughout the universe. The planets are alien but they are similar enough to Earth to relate to. They may be in a jungle, a desert, in an ocean or on a junkyard planet. There's plenty of variety but not to the point to make the show ""schizophrenic"". There's also plenty of comic relief. Very enjoyable show.",1314921600,,1236,4.522321428571429
3077380,4,B0012680BM,"I found that I still enjoy watching this series as much as I did when growing up.  It's still a good show today and fun to watch.  I recommend this set, especially for those of you trying to recapture the shows you watched way back when. =)",1295395200,,240,4.085106382978723

3077382,5,B0012680BM,"I watched this show when it was first on it was a compelling dramatic war cartoon that you don't see anymore.  It is in the same vein as the robotech saga but had more of a realistic war theme to it.  They don't make them like this anymore.  Instead today's cartoons are so dumbed down that they make the viewers stupid! Atleast cartoons like this prompted you to think and feel the struggle of the characters bring a sense of what being human is about. .
The cartoons of today have no substance or even anything educational.  The children of this current generation are going to be the idiots of tomorrow.",1266451200,,606,4.4324324324324325

3077384,4,B0012680BM,"Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors has a very simple plot.  Father accidently ends up making a race of EVIL half-plant half-machines.  Father escapes with half a magical root, giving the other half to his son.  Now his son, with the rest of the Lightning League who, must find it, to combine the two halves and SAVE the universe.  If they can find the Father.  Who is also being chased by the EVIL plant-car-creatures.  The EVIL plant-machines call themselves Monster Minds, which seems kind of a give away, and their leader is the EVIL Saw Boss.  EVIL!  Oops, lets move on.
The whole cartoon, like most cartoons, was made to sell something.  In this case action figures with fighting Road Warrior kind of cars that fought alien Road Warrior kind of cars.  Think cars with saws, guns, lasers and arms.  While there is little to no character development and the story never gets past the quest phase, my young mind at the time just enjoyed the combat and, for the time, the advanced artwork.  This is an American, kind of, cartoon yet the designs and artwork has the feel of an Japanese anime.
Magic, science fiction, rogue pilots, pirates, bounty hunters, and robotic cars.  This had everything my young heart wanted.  Herc Stormsailor is the character I liked the most - he is Hans Solo in cartoon form.  Once he even responded to a insult by saying - Who are you calling scruffy?  He loved money, his space barge Pride of the Skies II was always in need of repair, and he has a interesting background which is slowly revealed during the show.  Seems he worked on BOTH sides of the law and knows some people in high places.
The music is great and the battles were fun.  Some of the episodes, like Ghostship seem to have been thoughtfully plotted out, others were just shot-them-ups, bang-bang, which was great for a kid.  Yet Steel Against Shadow, by J. Michael Straczynski, had a very heavy hand when dealing with the Good vs. EVIL theme, with little or no action.  In other words - BOO!  LAME!  More explosions!  Who wants themes and thoughtfully stuff - more mindless firing of weapons into the massed ranks of the EVIL enemy!
This set is the first part of the series and I plan to look for volume 2 when it comes out.  Many of my memories seem to be from the latter episodes and I hope to enjoy them too!
Good for small kids or adults who like to watch cartoons with lots of explosions, lasers, war machines while eating pizza and thinking of high school.  Think of it as a American-Canadian-French cartoon version of Robotech before Robotech came to the American TV.",1239235200,,2568,4.566739606126915

3077397,2,B0012680BM,"Jayce and the Wheeled warriors was a very nice series which featured good animation combined with a good sound track. The unfortunate part however is that it was setup with a long, long loong run in mind. And that didn't happen because quite frankly; the show was aired right amongst other high qualified animation series (right in the time when anime started its rise, it even left some influenced on Jayce and his gang) which  made the public very unforgiving when it came to something which started to look like a never ending story really quick.

And unfortunatly thats what happened here. This series has never reached an end, the original is 65 episodes and thats it. Personally I think that when you lived this period you (should) have realized as much yourself. So this box? If you want to grab as much of the original series to relive it then this is a good buy. If you only want some ""Wheeled warriors action"" I suggest you grab the previous intro release. That features a good collection of episodes to make you relive the good times without any extras. I think thats the best approach because simply put: there isn't much extra available anyway. This series never came to an end; it was originally setup to be a VERY long lasting series hoping for a VERY long lasting toys sale. That didn't happen since most fans saw right through it.

And there you have it.. Good entertainment but don't expect much more. There simply isn't any!",1231459200,2,1443,4.62890625

3077400,5,B0012680BM,"Well the title was my first reaction to seeing this:

Jayce And The Wheeled Warriors #2 - This item has been discontinued by the manufacturer.

Until I perused the Shout Factory (publisher) forum. It seems that another publisher (NCircle Entertainment) was about to do a second volume - again probably a 4 episode disc.....(bit dumb in my opinion as we have half of the 65 episodes on this DVD already).

Reason for the initial panic, was that shout factory will only publish the second half once the first half have enough sales....evil perhaps, but there you go.

I was overjoyed that they did the first half (I preordered) as I have collected bits on VHS awhile....until I got a 8 DVD full series of VHS copies (years ago - now not available) which unfortunately had a few episodes either missing, duplicated or not in order. Damn!
It's menues were good ..quality..hmmm. I still miss a few episodes from second half (wrrra! ...ahem).
The only other option was to get the complete thing in French...Doh!

Although the series never released/made the final movie tie in (aparently still on drawing board & written), it is truly an enjoyable & amazing work...well written, great characters & a theme tune that will have you happily pumped up!

That done, what about Jayce....well I'll try not to be biased, lol....BUT:

A friend recently lent me Thundercats to watch......it does get to be same all boring after a while (admittedly a long while). Ulysses 31 - another great from the time, which I own - just does not seem as good.

In Jayce & the wheeled warriors they created a great mix of story, fun,  characters, music & lively animation, that for the era simply cannot be beat (even by battle of the planets). In aging it is still extreemly good & appropiate for all ages. Not tiresome at all.

This rates for me (incase you cannot guess my love & fond memory for it) as one of the top 2 series in the era (the other being Star Fleet - which I happily own in full with thanks - they really need to do this too - probably don't know what I mean, but do know it).

If you buy this (great price for ammount you get) & you like any of the series mentioned above - you will not go wrong.

Plus also you will help us all be one step closer to completing the series by getting the 2nd half released.....you never know - they may even be tempted someday to do the final movie. We can only hope.",1227916800,2,2390,4.456422018348624

It's a good thing they digitized them. Cause you can see the wear and tear and degrading quality in the video image, which I assume come from the original recordings.

Unfortunately Jayce came in at the end of the wave of the ""toy"" shows of the 80's, such as Transformers and He-Man, and got lost in the shuffle.  The premise and characters are definitely borrowed from ""Star Wars"", but the writers also were able to come up with some cool original storylines.  Wheeled Warriors showcases a lot of bonuses that may have been missed - good animation, laughable dialog, and an amazing cheesy soundtrack.  Seriously, if you don't love the theme song, then you REALLY don't love the 80's!  This series actually got me interested in anime - BEFORE anime was really known in the States.  Now that anime is pretty much commonplace, the charm of this series seems lost and almost insignificant against the mass-produced and ubiquitous fare of now.  If you're a Gen-Xer and are feeling nostalgic, definitely give Jayce a try!",1210032000,,924,4.666666666666667
3311780,5,B0012680BM,"I am glad that Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors has made it to a DVD collection.  It is one of my all time favorite cartoon series.  It has substance and depth that I find lacking in today's cartoons.  The characters are realistic and believable, lending themselves to the story.

The setup for this story is the best I have ever seen.  Audric, Jayce's father, is a botanist and has been trying to grow plants that will end hunger everywhere.  Just as he succeeds, a solar flare emits radiation that changes his plants into Monster Minds, the evil plants led by Saw Boss.  Audric develops a Magic Root to end the threat but the Monster Minds take over his laboratory before he can unite it.  Audric gives half to his servent Oon, to take to his son Jayce and escapes the lab.

Oon makes it to Jayce and gives him the half of the Magic Root Amulet.  Jayce and company (Gillian, Flora, Oon, and Herc Stormsailor) with their armored fighting vehicles become the Lightning League and set out to find Audric and unite the root that will end the threat of Saw Boss and the Monster Minds forever.

When ordering these volumes, you always have to check the amount of minutes to make sure that it was worth the price.

Now finally we get to see the whole first season with all the characters we remembered in the 80's.  I remember this being my favorite cartoon on TV at that time and aside from Transformers, nothing else mattered.  Jayce is a Luke Skywalker rip-off but who cares?  His unique land vehicle command is what makes him unigue.  In additon to the Thundercats, this is the other animation DVD I have been waiting to purchase.  Herc the Jerc is the likable character as in Han Solo clone, yet he is awesome as a horseback rider and has some other qualities Han Solo didn't. Odviously, Herc was voiced by a guy experienced in D.J. radio or a sports caster as his voice is that quality. Jayce's side-kick Oone is a miniture cavalier who is annoying more than funny.  Flora is a young plant/human girl hybrid and the fish named Broc, is even weirder.  The wizard utilises magic and science in equal measure proving they are one(as in ether I suppose).  Other characters(NPCs) are more interesting in these tapes than in the mere foursome collction I was milked for, where mostly the regulars appeared.  I assume the rest of the series will soon be out!  Don't settle for ""difinitive collections"" but seasons.",1202428800,3,1370,4.643153526970955
3311785,5,B0012680BM,"""Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors"" was one of my favorite 80s animated series. It's right up there with ""ThunderCats"" -- that good! But ""Jayce"" was rather overlooked compared to the likes of ""ThunderCats"", ""He-Man"", ""She-Ra"", ""Voltron"" and many other good animated series of that decadent decade.
""Jayce"" has very good storytelling for starters: the basic premise is about a scientist named Audric (Jayce's father) who nearly succeded with ending starvation and hunger in vast star systems with the creation of genetically-engineered vegetation. Out of the blue, a cosmic explosion occurs and causes Audric's creations to wildly mutate into creatures with evil brains (called Monster Minds). Audric had to flee his laboratory with one half of a magical relic called ""The Root"" (Jayce somehow has the other half) that, when fused, would revert the evil creations and their machinations back to harmless vegetation. Jayce, with the help of an old and wise wizard named Gillian, an empathic girl named Flora, and an intergalactic traveling merchant named Herc Stormsailor, sets out to search for his father before the Monster Minds take over the universe. And I can't forget Jayce's little companion, a robot squire named Oon who believes his lance is ""magic"" (which adds a degree of cuteness to what is otherwise dramatic and thrilling stories).
""Jayce"" was among J. Michael Strasyncski's (""of ""Babylon 5"" fame) first major efforts at sci-fi storytelling and was also co-producer of this series. It also has great music by Shuki Levy and Haim Saban (some of the most talented musicians for animated fare), and is pretty nicely animated by DIC (the creators of ""M.A.S.K."", ""Inspector Gadget"" and ""Where On Earth is Carmen Sandiego?).
I think ""Jayce"" is a timeless series and is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, especially if you are a fan of 80s toons, or any 80s TV program for that matter.",1201392000,27,1873,5.144262295081967

There is no extras no making of no interviews this is barebones early youtube quality recordings that really could use a touch up.

3311822,5,B0012680BM,"Anybody remember USA's Cartoon Express? Man, I loved that programming when I was a kid. This show was on it at one point in time. Considering it was cobbled together to sell toys they did a great job with it. The people who were involved with making it wanted to make the best show they could with the material they had, and it shows. Yeah, it's cheesy but it's some awesome velveeta. The story is about the titular Jayce, he of the skunky hairdo on the cover there. His father is superscientist Audric (also skunky haired so that you can easily see the family resemblance) and Audric's specialty is botany. Some time in the past that is never mentioned on this show, Jayce lost his mother, so Audric made Jayce a little sister out of plants; the little redhaired girl Flora that you see on the cover. Flora can talk to plants and has a giant floating pet fish because: reasons. Audric also has a robot squire assistant named Oon because, why not? Oon is the comic relief in most episodes. As the show starts, Jayce is kind of petulant because Audric never has time to spend with him, but he better step up because Audric just accidentally made the Monster Minds, so things are about to get real. So, Audric accidentally makes sentient plants bent on world domination while trying to find a cure for hunger. It's kind of funny how quickly he decides they are evil, but I guess anyone would be alarmed if their plants suddenly started growing out of control. Audric hares off to find the other half of a magic root that will stop the Monster Minds that he accidentally unleashed on an unsuspecting galaxy. He leaves Jayce and Flora in the care of  his mentor, a wizard scientist named Gillian. Gillian is a character in the mold of Gandalf and Dumbledore. Why there are wizards in space is never explored, but Gillian tells Jayce he needs to guard his half of the magic root and use the Ring of Light to save as many people as he can from Monster Minds while they try to catch up to Audric. They enlist the help of a space pirate named Herc Stormsailer to ferry them around on this errand. Herc is in the mold of Han Solo. I did always like Herc's ship, the Pride of the Skies II. It looks like a galley ship except the sails are solar panels. Every time Jayce and his group encounter Monster Minds, they wind up in a fight using armored vehicles that they store in the ship's hold when not in use. The armored vehicles were the toys that this whole cartoon was built around. I think you can see why the toys didn't sell as well as the company had hoped. They show up in every episode, but there's a whole lot of stuff going on that has nothing to do with them. The cartoon lives on as TV junk food of the highest order. This first group of episodes sets up the premise and is not the best that were ever produced. The show gets a lot better as it goes on.",1404950400,,2855,4.326492537313433

But with the openings of 80s cartoons, you got a great punch that really hyped you up for the show. The episodes, for the most part, are pretty decent quality. There have been only a couple of episodes that were a little washed out. But it's not because of compression. This show is almost 30 years old. Still, the show is a lot of fun, though the story can get a bit boring and repetitive at times. The disc are in little paper sleeves tucked in the box.

3311871,5,B0012680BM,"Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors Volume 1 is another DVD that I won in a recent giveaway. I didn't recognize the name or the cover art. It wasn't until I played the first episode that I finally, more like vaguely, remembered the show, as I was a four-year-old when it aired on television. Actually, I don't recall much about the show, but I do the toys, which were released by Mattel before the show was created. Mattel needed a way to explain the strange looking silver vehicles and the even stranger looking organic/machine vehicles, thus Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors was created. Talented writes such as Larry DiTillio, Barbara Hambly and J. Michael Straczynski, creator of Babylon 5, wrote most the episodes.

Here is the series main plot: Audric, a botanist, was experimenting with biotechnology, and developed a crop that could grow in any environment.  A burst of radiation from a solar flare mutated one of his crops, transforming it an evil creature called Saw Boss. The other plants transformed as well and were called the Monster Minds. Audric created a magic root to destroy Saw Boss, but time was not on his side as his laboratory is being attacked. He splits the magical root in half and gives the other half of it to his faithful servant, Oon. He commands Oon to take the root to his son, Jayce, and serve under his command.

Oon (a magically animated suit of armor servant) finds Jacye along with Gillian (a wizard/scientist), and Flora, who was created from a flower by Audric. With the help of a Han Solo ripoff character, Herc Stormsailor - a pilot and  mercenary, they become known as the Lightning League. They use their ground vehicles to battle the Monster Minds vehicles, that are grown from vines. The Lightning League travels to planet to planet by the Pride of the Skies II, Herc's space barge, as Jayce searches for his missing father.

Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors definitely has that 80s feel to it, along with the catchy pop rock theme song. Obviously, the show had one purpose - sell the toy line. The talented writers took a silly premise and did what they could with it, giving us an original science fiction cartoon. Now thanks to Cookie Jar, a division of Mill Creek Entertainment, old fans can watch the series again and introduce the Lightning League to a new generation. Despite each episode being similar (searching for Jayce's father on a new planet, Saw Boss and his minions show up, and they battle it out with their vehicles. Sadly, the series never got a conclusion as it was cancelled before a movie could go into production. I enjoyed revisiting Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors, and I can't wait for Volume 2 to be released.",1337731200,11,2672,4.71306209850107
3311872,5,B0012680BM,I just got the set in the mail earlier today and i'm hooked. My only previous exposure to Jayce and the wheeled warriors comes from clips of the theme song I saw on youtube. I've watched the first 4 episodes and imo this show has aged far better than most other 80's cartoons like Thundercats or Voltron. The dialog is pretty awkward but the characters are still likeable enough that you actually care what happens to them. The music is epic and the animation is anime quality.,1332979200,4,477,4.494252873563219
3311873,5,B0012680BM,"I am very satisfied with this purchased. The show is exactly how I remember it and the overall quality of the product Mill Creek has put out beats all of my expectations. In addition, the price is stellar for what you get. Although the packaging is somewhat unorthodox, I actually like it better than a standard multi-disc case.

1). Quality - Very good compared to cobbled together version I purchased from EBAY years ago, but not remastered.

I was a huge fan of Jayce as a child and the DVD version does not disappoint. Please note that this is the original cartoon as aired on TV NOT a remastered version. This is stated in the product description, so I was not surprised, instead I was pleased with how good it looks. The image and sound quality is good and true to my memory of the show. In fact, I would say that current TV technology ability to render deeper and richer colors actual enhances the experience even though the material is unmodified from the original. The manufacturer has included a disc menu that helps to bring up favorite episodes (it also plays the closing theme song!)

2). Delivery - Quoted long at first, but came in within 7 business days.

When I first made this purchase, Amazon informed me that this DVD set would arrive 2 - 3 weeks. In my opinion this was very long wait, but only a few days later I received an update that my package was being prepared for shipment and I could expect it in a few days. True to their word, the package arrived soon after (within 7 business days of my original order). I am not sure if this is a factor of incomplete production updates between Amazon and Mill Creek or if the total volume of orders is less/more than expected, but I am happy to have recieved my order within a resonable time frame. This could also have been due to the Print on Demand style of production.

3). Packaging - Very good for the cost.

The set comes in a sturdy DVD box. The 32 episodes are split among 3 DVD's with 11 episodes per DVD (note that the 11th episode on disc 1 is a bonus episode of C.O.P.S.). Each disc is stored in a separate disc envelope and the interior of the DVD box has special bumpers and hooks that hold all 3 of these envelopes securely in place. I have seen similar box interiors where there are two large clamps that you slide the DVD underneath to hold it down. This set up is nothing like that, you bend the corners of the envelope (where there is no DVD to rub) underneath the hooks and between the bumpers. Again, this is somewhat unorthodx, but I like it.

I am worried that dirt and dust will get into the envelope and scratch my disc, but the jury is still out on this (come on folks - its still new!)

4). Overall - If you are a fan of Jayce, 80's and or 90's cartoons, cartoons in general, or mechanic wizards, plant girls, flying fish and space lightening - just buy it, you'll be happy you did.",1330646400,10,2878,4.326530612244898

Mill Creek Entertainment asked us to share with you that they're working on a pair of early 2012 releases for Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors, currently scheduled - for the time being, anyway (they could move) - for a street date of February 14th. This sweetheart of a Valentine's Day gift will either be the low-cost 32-episode collection of Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors - Volume 1 on 3 DVDs, or you can instead get the even-lower-cost 10-episode ""Best Of"" title on a single disc. Word is to expect the second volume shortly afterward, hopefully with the rest of the show's 65-episode run!

3311876,5,B0012680BM,"I remember watching this show when I was ten years old and my enjoyment of it hasn't diminished at all. The main premise of this show is that the Lightning League is out to rid the universe of the monster minds. The monster minds are vehicle/plant hynrids that are out to destroy and take over other worlds. They were accidentally created by Jayce's father. Jayce and his crew travel the universe in a spaceship shaped like a pirate ship to search for his father to reunite two parts of a magic root in order to eliminate the monster minds once and for all. Jayce's crew consists of a centuries old wizard, a plant/girl hybrid, a mercenary, a walking suit of armor and a huge flying fish. They have a variety of vehicles equipped with a claw, a drill, a spiked wheel and various types of guns. The monster minds vehicles are equipped with saws, wrecking balls, bolos, snake heads and guns. The crew go to many different planets throughout the universe. The planets are alien but they are similar enough to Earth to relate to. They may be in a jungle, a desert, in an ocean or on a junkyard planet. There's plenty of variety but not to the point to make the show ""schizophrenic"". There's also plenty of comic relief. Very enjoyable show.",1314921600,,1236,4.522321428571429

Instead today's cartoons are so dumbed down that they make the viewers stupid!

3311881,4,B0012680BM,"Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors has a very simple plot.  Father accidently ends up making a race of EVIL half-plant half-machines.  Father escapes with half a magical root, giving the other half to his son.  Now his son, with the rest of the Lightning League who, must find it, to combine the two halves and SAVE the universe.  If they can find the Father.  Who is also being chased by the EVIL plant-car-creatures.  The EVIL plant-machines call themselves Monster Minds, which seems kind of a give away, and their leader is the EVIL Saw Boss.  EVIL!  Oops, lets move on.
The whole cartoon, like most cartoons, was made to sell something.  In this case action figures with fighting Road Warrior kind of cars that fought alien Road Warrior kind of cars.  Think cars with saws, guns, lasers and arms.  While there is little to no character development and the story never gets past the quest phase, my young mind at the time just enjoyed the combat and, for the time, the advanced artwork.  This is an American, kind of, cartoon yet the designs and artwork has the feel of an Japanese anime.
Magic, science fiction, rogue pilots, pirates, bounty hunters, and robotic cars.  This had everything my young heart wanted.  Herc Stormsailor is the character I liked the most - he is Hans Solo in cartoon form.  Once he even responded to a insult by saying - Who are you calling scruffy?  He loved money, his space barge Pride of the Skies II was always in need of repair, and he has a interesting background which is slowly revealed during the show.  Seems he worked on BOTH sides of the law and knows some people in high places.
The music is great and the battles were fun.  Some of the episodes, like Ghostship seem to have been thoughtfully plotted out, others were just shot-them-ups, bang-bang, which was great for a kid.  Yet Steel Against Shadow, by J. Michael Straczynski, had a very heavy hand when dealing with the Good vs. EVIL theme, with little or no action.  In other words - BOO!  LAME!  More explosions!  Who wants themes and thoughtfully stuff - more mindless firing of weapons into the massed ranks of the EVIL enemy!
This set is the first part of the series and I plan to look for volume 2 when it comes out.  Many of my memories seem to be from the latter episodes and I hope to enjoy them too!
Good for small kids or adults who like to watch cartoons with lots of explosions, lasers, war machines while eating pizza and thinking of high school.  Think of it as a American-Canadian-French cartoon version of Robotech before Robotech came to the American TV.",1239235200,,2568,4.566739606126915

3311894,2,B0012680BM,"Jayce and the Wheeled warriors was a very nice series which featured good animation combined with a good sound track. The unfortunate part however is that it was setup with a long, long loong run in mind. And that didn't happen because quite frankly; the show was aired right amongst other high qualified animation series (right in the time when anime started its rise, it even left some influenced on Jayce and his gang) which  made the public very unforgiving when it came to something which started to look like a never ending story really quick.

And unfortunatly thats what happened here. This series has never reached an end, the original is 65 episodes and thats it. Personally I think that when you lived this period you (should) have realized as much yourself. So this box? If you want to grab as much of the original series to relive it then this is a good buy. If you only want some ""Wheeled warriors action"" I suggest you grab the previous intro release. That features a good collection of episodes to make you relive the good times without any extras. I think thats the best approach because simply put: there isn't much extra available anyway. This series never came to an end; it was originally setup to be a VERY long lasting series hoping for a VERY long lasting toys sale. That didn't happen since most fans saw right through it.

3311897,5,B0012680BM,"Well the title was my first reaction to seeing this:

Jayce And The Wheeled Warriors #2 - This item has been discontinued by the manufacturer.

Until I perused the Shout Factory (publisher) forum. It seems that another publisher (NCircle Entertainment) was about to do a second volume - again probably a 4 episode disc.....(bit dumb in my opinion as we have half of the 65 episodes on this DVD already).

Reason for the initial panic, was that shout factory will only publish the second half once the first half have enough sales....evil perhaps, but there you go.

I was overjoyed that they did the first half (I preordered) as I have collected bits on VHS awhile....until I got a 8 DVD full series of VHS copies (years ago - now not available) which unfortunately had a few episodes either missing, duplicated or not in order. Damn!
It's menues were good ..quality..hmmm. I still miss a few episodes from second half (wrrra! ...ahem).
The only other option was to get the complete thing in French...Doh!

Although the series never released/made the final movie tie in (aparently still on drawing board & written), it is truly an enjoyable & amazing work...well written, great characters & a theme tune that will have you happily pumped up!

That done, what about Jayce....well I'll try not to be biased, lol....BUT:

A friend recently lent me Thundercats to watch......it does get to be same all boring after a while (admittedly a long while). Ulysses 31 - another great from the time, which I own - just does not seem as good.

In Jayce & the wheeled warriors they created a great mix of story, fun,  characters, music & lively animation, that for the era simply cannot be beat (even by battle of the planets). In aging it is still extreemly good & appropiate for all ages. Not tiresome at all.

This rates for me (incase you cannot guess my love & fond memory for it) as one of the top 2 series in the era (the other being Star Fleet - which I happily own in full with thanks - they really need to do this too - probably don't know what I mean, but do know it).

If you buy this (great price for ammount you get) & you like any of the series mentioned above - you will not go wrong.

Plus also you will help us all be one step closer to completing the series by getting the 2nd half released.....you never know - they may even be tempted someday to do the final movie. We can only hope.",1227916800,2,2390,4.456422018348624

8244129,5,B0012680BM,"Two great things about 1985 were The Goonies and Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors. I already owned ""The Goonies"" on blu ray, so what I needed was this cartoon. I was very excited to see it on Amazon, so I just ordered it. I sat down to watch it with my 4 and 6yr old kids and they also loved it! I only had one problem. I didn't have the second disc set. The cartoon tv show was a great blast from the past and worth buying. If you're a cartoon collector, then you should own this. It shipped fast and was wrapped very nicely. I have no complaints except for the fact that I didn't have part two at the time. Overall, it's worth the buy.",1453593600,,635,4.0078740157480315
