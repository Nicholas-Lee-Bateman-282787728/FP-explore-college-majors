3484335,4,B001B73POE,"I have not read any of the CanLit that Margaret Laurence wrote - but after seeing this film it makes me want to make the time. I felt this was an impressive film that does not deserve the multitudes of slander and dislike for it that I read about so much.

Burstyn leads a great cast with the likes of Ellen Page, Cole Hauser, Kevin Zegers, Dylan Baker and out of nowhere - Christine Horne. The filming locations in Canada were beautiful, and the period recreations appeared very thorough (vehicles, homes, businesses, etc.).

The story of a woman's life from childhood to passing is flashed back and forth as we discover how the decisions in her life make her fate. You cannot help but think of Notebook in a variety of ways, but this story has so much more in realism and pessimism. The editing is done flawlessly to transport us between time periods, and the lady director (Skogland) helps add some nice feminine touches at the right moments.

Kari Skogland has another fan now after I watched the DVD docus and was VERY happy with how she had them made. The ""behind the scenes"" is not narrated and splices together random footage of actually making the film. The cast interviews were kept separate - something I wish more filmmakers would do.

I could not give it the higher rating because there was so much being left out or not elaborated on that I am sure had to be in the book. There were at least three story lines and two different sequences that begged for more but were cut short or not explained. I understand the gripes about the cover art, Ellen page has two pics (as she is very popular) front and back, but she is only in the film for a few minutes. The story was written before cell phones and other modernizations shown, but I think the purists need to take a rest on that one. Some nice surprises though; Wings Hauser plays his son's role as the old character, Dylan Baker's performance was very believable but will get overlooked, and the overall authentic/real feel to this (not everyone's love story from the old days ends up perfect in the end) gives this a nudge over Notebook.

Recommend as a buy or a rent.",1224115200,14,2133,4.487113402061856
8282013,3,B001B73POE,"(Rounded up from 2-1/2 stars, Major Spoiler Alert) Starring one of my personal favorite actresses, Ellen Burstyn (""The Last Picture Show,"" The Exorcist""), I really wanted to like ""The Stone Angel,"" and while Burstyn takes command of this hard-to-rate film with ease, the screenplay itself unfortunately can't match her performance.  (I'm also not sure why the quote on the box says she only deserves ""another Oscar nom;"" why would someone think she was good enough for a nomination but not another Oscar?)  Burstyn plays ""Hagar Shipley,"" whose son, ""Marvin"" (in the opening scene), wants to put her in a nursing home.  Not surprisingly, Hagar wants nothing of it and decides to run away (on a bus) to her hometown and thereby reminisces about the best and worst of times in her life (mostly the worst times, I'm afraid).  The film goes back and forth, from young Hagar (a perfectly cast and excellent Christine Horne, who admittedly bears a striking resemblance to Burstyn) to elderly Hagar (Burstyn).  While there seemed to be a genuine romance with her husband ""Bram,"" it decidedly ends sadly and without fulfillment.  Hagar also realizes that her father basically stopped loving her the day she married Bram, and they never make amends.  We learn that her mother died giving birth to her brother, and not long after Hagar's wedding, both her brother and father pass (though at different times), suddenly making Hagar an orphan.  To make matters worse, Hagar's father leaves her absolutely nothing in his will, cementing Hagar's destiny of a life of hardships, leaving her no choice but to work as a live-in maid elsewhere.  As if that wasn't bleak enough, the older ""Bram"" (Rutger Hauer, who barely speaks two lines in the film) also passes just after she moves back in, after their extremely long separation.  Of their two sons, the younger one, ""John,"" passes in a ""chicken"" accident with a train with the girl he was dating at the time, not long after he discovered from his mother that the girl was indeed his biological cousin, making it an incestuous and therefore uncomfortable relationship for the viewer.  The elderly Hagar does make it back home but spends most of her time away from town folk, except for one young, kind stranger in her old house that's barely standing and roofless, and hope for a redeeming ending soon produces more questions than answers (the soundtrack also didn't complement the film well).  A few questions among many:  Why does her only surviving son, Marvin, leave his mother's deathbed in the precise moment when she needs him most?  Why was the movie's namesake, the stone angel at the cemetery, left overturned?  Was this a symbolization?  Still, the film will probably satisfy Burstyn fans, but you'll be challenged to find life in a movie containing no less than seven (separate) deaths.",1464480000,,2831,4.940928270042194

8282018,4,B001B73POE,"This was an unusual movie.  I admit, I haven't read the book, but I also don't feel compelled to read it after watching the movie either.  I'm not saying the movie was bad, but rather that it seemed like a book involving it might be a bit slow, since the movie was too.  But it told the story of a very realistic woman.

The Stone Angel follows the life of Hagar.  We are introduced to her as an old woman, who's son wants to put her in the nursing home.  As she travels back to where she grew up, she also travels back in her memories as well, remembering her life.  Most especially she remembers meeting Bram, her husband, and the grief it caused her father as he disowned her for marrying Bram.  She has two sons, and its obvious she dotes on the younger, but they don't grow to what she thinks they will.  In between her memories, she shares some time with some unusual people and stays in an abandoned house, just trying to reconcile what's happening with her.  In her life she's lost quite a bit, and it makes those memories that more poignant.

I really liked both of the actors for Hagar.  They each added their own style to the character and while they worked together, they were also incredibly different.  The older Hagar is much freer than the younger, and Burstyn was very good at making herself seem like a strong old woman who is slowly losing herself.  The younger Hagar, played by Horne was passionate, but stiff, and it was easy to see she was never content with her life.  The other characters did a good job as well, but you didn't get the depth of feeling with them that you did with Hagar.  Even her sons were kind of regulated to the background, especially Marvin, although I suppose that was actually his role.  John was the favored and his actor was very good at making him seem like he had no direction in life.

I did like the story that the movie told.  It was touching, although you can get irritated with the characters sometimes.  Hagar seemed to have a lot of trouble in her life, and granted Bram wasn't always the best of husbands but he did seem to genuinely love her.  She just wasn't content.  And I'm sure its a story that could resonate with a lot of people.  But it did move sort of slow.  I realize it was a character building movie, but at times it drug and focused on things that just didn't seem that important in Hagar's life.  There are some adult themes in the movie, nothing is shown  overtly but there's some heavier romance scenes.

The music was nothing special.  It fit with the times but really just provided more background than anything.  It also was largely instrumental.  The shooting of the movie was also standard.  There weren't special effects, etc.  It was just the telling of a story so the camera followed the characters around.  But hey, it wasn't shaky so it was fine by me.  They did a good job on the settings as well, everything seemed to stay in sync with the era it was supposedly in.  I liked the touch the old cars in the movie made too.

An interesting movie.  Not necessarily for those who would like some action or suspense though.  It told a story.

8282019,2,B001B73POE,"I absolutely loved this book.  It's one of 3 that I own that I can open to a random page and start reading.  The story draws you in and you don't want it to end.
The movie--not so much.  The characters on the screen were totally unrecognizable, both in description and personality.  The time period was wrong.  The storylines were incomplete, and if you hadn't read the book you wouldn't know why some of the things happened as they did.  Important details were left out; things that didn't even happen in the book were put in.
The story is wonderful; I strongly suggest reading the book.  I really wish that whoever made this into a movie would have left it alone and allowed someone who wanted to take the time to do the story justice to make it instead.
The acting, however, was very good.  Ellen Burstyn never disappoints, and the appearance of Wings Hauser was a pleasant surprise.  And yes, the scenery in the movie was beautiful.
I would love to have seen this cast in this movie with a better script.
Please-don't waste your money on the movie.  The Movie Channel on cable runs it every now and then--wait and catch it on that.  Better yet; buy the book.",1272326400,3,1162,4.459715639810427
8282020,3,B001B73POE,"""Stone Angel"" is far from original. It is the genre of ""Green Fried Tomatoes"" and the like. If you are an Ellen Page fan, you might find yourself wondering exactly when she would make her appearance in the film. Well, it is close to the end and if you blink you might miss her brief bit, which ends tragically and makes no sense.",1246838400,,329,4.238095238095238
8282021,2,B001B73POE,"WARNING ! This movie is not exactly what it seems.  I expected a warm and nostalgic journey down memory lane, perhaps coupled with an ""escape from the nursing home"" fantasy road trip.  While there are elements of that and the movie is certainly well made and well acted, the story is a rather depressing one, filled with guilt ridden and guilt producing family members who drive each other to drink, to distraction, and even to death.  There really is not a sane person among them.  Even the main character, Hagar Shipley played by Ellen Burstyn, is not all that sympathetic and seems clueless as to her own impact on other family members while very aware of everyone's impact upon her.  The characters are not as bad in their younger days perhaps, but seem to get worse with age.  The movie is well done and to a large extent realistic.  However, you may ask yourself at the end, ""did I really want to spend two hours with any of these people.""",1234396800,5,945,4.523529411764706
8282022,4,B001B73POE,"Though I'm a Californian, I've had a passion for Canadian writers for most of my life; especially Margaret Laurence and Alice Munro.  I read The Stone Angel at least 30 years ago, and its disturbing themes stayed with me.  I'm unsure how close the movie is to the book, but I wasn't disappointed.  The cinematography was beautiful, the acting excellent, the disturbing themes were portrayed with a clear eye.  Seeing any of the works of Laurence and Munro brought effectively to the screen is a joy.",1229817600,9,499,4.767441860465116
