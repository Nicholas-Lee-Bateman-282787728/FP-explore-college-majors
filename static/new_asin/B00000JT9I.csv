1238799,4,B00000JT9I,"Strangler reminds me of some movies I watched as a kid with lots of fog, figures creeping around in the dark, and classic mood music:  Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes or those B/W Cat People films.  Found the ending interesting as the young girl is willing to forfeit what some of the elders (""I'm only 70"") are not.",1326412800,,318,4.4655172413793105
1238800,4,B00000JT9I,"Strangler of the Swamp is, in a sentence, a haunted love story.  But don't let that brief description fool you.  It is also a low (low) budget B-movie full of cheesy swamp sets, buckets of fake fog, and a surprisingly creepy Strangler.  Luckily for me, I have a thing for swamps and 'atmospheric' fog and especially for Swamp Stranglers.  And with a run time of only 58 minutes, one can make it through this flick without dozing off.

The Strangler shows up a regular intervals to keep everyone on their toes, but the bulk of the story revolves around the budding romance between the granddaughter of the old ferryman and the son of the most respected landowner in town.  I was pleasantly surprised at the strong and independent character that is given to the granddaughter; it is a refreshing change of pace from the fainting damsels featured in many 40s films. I also found it interesting that religious faith and the power of God is given a prominent place in combating the Strangler.  The film is not heavy-handed in its portrayal of religious belief, nor does it resort to caricature, both of which seem all to common in more modern films.  It seems very natural, or supernatural as the case may be.

If you are a fan of low budget, yet atmospheric, horror films from the forties, I'd recommend this one.  Amazon has it affordably priced, and as long as your expectations don't go beyond awesome/awesomely bad swamp sets, fake fog, and occasional appearances by that creepy spectre, then Strangler of the Swamp won't let you down!",1247443200,3,1535,4.715355805243446
1238801,3,B00000JT9I,"The life of a ferryman certainly doesn't seem like a glamorous one, living in a hovel on a muddy bank, endlessly schlepping people and their possessions back and forth, regardless of the weather, for a mere pittance.  And it's not like you get to set your own hours, either...no, there's always people coming around all times of the day and night, looking to cross...the ones at the night are the worst.  These are usually men who've stayed out late drinking, and they almost always get to heaving the contents of their stomachs once that ferryboat starts a rockin'...it wouldn't be so bad if they managed to spew forth over the side of the ferry rather than in the ferry...there are some benefits...lots of fresh air, great upper body strength, and the juicy gossip one hears when ferrying people back and forth, especially from the ladies.  Co-written and directed by Frank Wisbar aka Franz Wysbar (Secrets of a Sorority Girl, Devil Bat's Daughter), the film features Rosemary La Planche (Devil Bat's Daughter, Betty Co-Ed), in her first starring.  Who's Rosemary La Planche, you say?  Well, she was only Miss California two years in a row (1940 and 1941), and crowned Miss America in 1941.  Also appearing is Robert Barrat (The Last of the Mohicans, The Life of Emile Zola), Charles `Ming' Middleton (Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars, Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe), bit player Nolan Leary (The Abductors, Man of a Thousand Faces), Frank Conlan (The Devil and Daniel Webster), and Blake Edwards, who would later go on to become more famous behind the camera writing and directing such films like Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961), The Pink Panther (1963), A Shot in the Dark (1964), and The Party (1968), to name a few.

As the movie begins we see four men, one unconscious clad only in a bathing suit, trucking across a foggy swamp in a ferry.  On reaching the bank, the unconscious man is laid out, and one of the men puts his coat over the prone figure...okay, maybe he's not unconscious (who the heck goes swimming in the swamp?)...the old biddies gather and we hear about how `the curse' has taken another life.  Apparently, in the not too distant past, the men of the town strung up the previous ferryman, whom they thought was a killer.  Prior to his death, the accused man, who vehemently proclaimed his innocence, vowed to come back from the grave and take vengeance on all the men, including their male descendants, for their heinous act (turns out the evidence tying the hanged man to the crime was a bit thin).  Since then, various male townspeople have suffered bizarre deaths attributed to some form of strangulation, and now the town is divided into two groups, the superstitious lot who believe the curse, and the `enlighten' few, including town leader Christian Sanders (Barrat), who see the deaths as nothing but a series of coincidences.  Shortly after the current ferryman meets his untimely demise, one of his descendants arrives, a pretty woman named Maria (La Planche), and takes over the business (the townspeople neglect to mention the circumstances about the old man's death).  Shortly after this Sanders son, Christian Jr. (Edwards), returns to take up the family farm, and he falls for Maria.  As their love grows, so does the ominous presence in the swamp, as the prodigal son is now in apparition's sights...

Strangler of the Swamp, released by PRC studios, which went under around the time the film was released, is actually a remake of an earlier Wisbar film, a German feature titled Fhrmann Maria (1936), and among a handful of films Wisbar did for the ""Poverty Row"" studios upon arriving in America from Germany.  I have not seen the earlier film, but I thought this one was quite good.  It wasn't very frightening, but it did have a whole mess of atmospheric flavor, as whoever was manning the fog machine surely earned his money.  At first I thought this was going to be a straight up mystery, but that wasn't the case as there was a sense of the story existing in the ether of a thinly shrouded twilight realm, much like that of the film Carnival of Souls (1962).  The two films are very different, this one featuring more of a linear storyline, but both exhibit a spooky ethereal quality, one that transcends their respective shoestring budget origins.  This isn't a great movie, especially given the extremely `talkie' bits and penchant for the characters to spend an awful lot of time traipsing around the swamp, but those elements where it succeeds, it does so extremely well, rising above its meager budget.  And having Rosemary La Planche in the film certainly didn't hurt...her acting here was decent enough, but her actual presence in the foggy mists, her physical beauty (and that long hair), kept me interested thoroughly.  Oh mama...my favorite scene in the film featured Barrat as Christian Sanders, the staunch, well-to-do, grounded in reality community leader, and Leary as Pete Jeffers, the town ne'er-do-well, afraid of everything, including his own shadow.  Both men had been involved in the nastiness of the past, and now Jeffers, fearing specifically for his life, tries to convince Saunders to do the altruistic by giving himself to the ghost (thereby breaking the curse) because Saunders has lived a full, rich life, and achieved about as much as a man could expect.  He also prattles on about how Saunders will be fondly remembered by those he saves through his sacrifice...Saunders, seeing the cowardly ploy for what it is, makes a counter offer in that Jeffers should sacrifice himself if only because Jeffers has done so little for the community, contributing practically nothing towards the common good, and his sacrifice would be the pinnacle of a relatively pointless life.  Another scene I enjoyed was when Maria was being accosted by a lecherous, drunken ferry customer, and Christian Jr. shows the man the errors of his way with a few, good smacks upside the head.  All in all decent little obscurity, steeped in atmospheric goodness, one whose charms more than make up for its humble origins, in my opinion.

The fullscreen, original aspect ratio picture presented on this DVD looks decent, but does have a number of visible flaws, which I expected, given the age and relative obscurity of the film in general.  They didn't distract overall, and were very acceptable, in my opinion.  The Dolby Digital mono audio comes through fairly clean, but again, any imperfections are easily overlooked.  There aren't any special features or extras, but there are chapter stops.

1238802,3,B00000JT9I,"German writer-director Frank Wisbar made one of the finest low-budget horror films of the 1940s, ""Strangler of the Swamp."" Produced by PRC, this little-known ""B"" movie was a 58-minute remake of Wisbar's 1936 classic ""Fahrmann Maria."" Wisbar duplicated the dark, misty atmosphere of his earlier film with a paltry $20,000 and a one-week shooting schedule. Though ignored upon its 1946 release, ""Strangler of the Swamp"" managed to rise from the cinematic dead  thanks to a chapter in historian William K. Everson's 1974 book, ""Classics of the Horror Film."" Rather than create a traditional horror movie, Wisbar emphasized mood and expressionistic style in this gothic tale. The plot centers on a ghostly ferryman (played by Charles Middleton) who swore his vengeance upon the swampland villagers responsible for his wrongful hanging - including their descendants, one of whom must sacrifice their life to end the shadowy curse. PRC's shoddy production values actually work to Wisbar's advantage. Except for a few brief exterior shots, ""Strangler of the Swamp"" exists in a claustrophobic, studio-bound world. The performances are surprisingly restrained, with Middleton making the most of his limited spectral presence. ""Strangler of the Swamp"" is not the rediscovered masterpiece some have claimed, yet it remains a textbook example of Poverty Row filmmaking.",1094256000,2,1357,5.524038461538462
1238803,4,B00000JT9I,"To appreciate this movie, we need to remember that, before the era of the Muliplex and cable TV, people expected to see two movies at most theaters, the ""double feature."" (You could also walk in on the middle of a film, but that's another issue.) As a result, there was a whole industry of B-movies, to give the moviegoers a bit more for their money, and every now and then, the B-movie gave you some interesting watching.
Such a movie is Strangler of the Swamp. It's not heavyweight, the story isn't classic, but it's carried out subtly and, as others have noted, with a great deal of atmosphere.
The movie takes place in a little town separated from the mainland by a swamp. The swamp can only be crossed by an old-fashioned rope ferry--the kind where a ferryman pulls the boat back and forth for a small fee. The town has a nasty secret--the old ferry operator, Ferryman Douglas, was wrongfully accused of murder and virtually lynched. His ghost haunts the swamp and quietly strangles those who killed him and their families in ways that seem accidental.
The gloomy atmospehere is so nicely done that when the pretty granddaughter of the most recent ferryman, killed by Douglas, shows up, she is like a bright light. She decides to remain in her home town as the new ferry operator, like a Lovecraft character drawn back to an ancestral horror.
This short piece lasts less than an hour, but the time is just about right. The oppressive atmosphere of the swamp and constant mist create a mood of corruption as certainly as a Tennessee Williams novel. The avenging ghost, played by Charles Middleton, is a spectral character, little seen but readily identified by his strong rich voice.
Ferryman Douglas' killings seem less a stalking horror than a rough justice on this secretive little town. In a poignent moment, Douglas pulls the boat across and tells his passenger, who now understands who he is, that ""once this was my boat,"" a plain statement that tells us of a simple life ended by others' meanness.
For the price, worth a place in your library if you like the ghost story genre.",1072310400,16,2088,4.692098092643052
1238804,4,B00000JT9I,"I don't remember seeing ever seeing this one as a kid in the 1970's, but it's pretty cool if a bit simplistic. It's only about an hour long and it's almost like watching a play. The swamp is richly spooky, and the strangler delivers the goods.
If you like older, classic horror, this one's worth a look.",1034640000,7,303,4.333333333333333
1238805,3,B00000JT9I,"This movie is okay-and reminds me of Val Lewton--just not as good.  It's rather short and involves a man wrongly hung, who has vowed revenge.  Somehow-everyone knows how to end the ""curse"" but only the heroine of the story is willing to act upon this knowledge.  I just don't understand how everyone came upon this information--but other than that-the stories okay and worth a watch.",985219200,3,383,4.861538461538461
1238806,5,B00000JT9I,"To be honest, I don't quite remember how I ended up ordering this  particular film (somehow the recommendation robot must have something to do  with it <g>), but it definitely had me hooked the moment I pressed  Play on the remote.
As pointed out in the amazon-description this is sort  of a remake of Wisbars earlier German effort ""Faehrmann Maria""  and therefore is less a 'horror thriller' than a dark, moody fairytale.
The plot circles about villagers housing in a swamp area which have  lynched an innocent man some years ago. The hanged man swore deadly revenge  to all involved in his killing and does this quite effectively. When young  Maria shows up, granddaughter of the real criminal, and falls in love with  Chris Sanders, next on the stranglers list, the real trouble starts. Well,  sort of. This is not an action flick and, this has to be said, the climatic  standoff between strangler, Maria, Chris and his father in an abandoned  church is a bit of a letdown but I figure that this has something to do  with the budget (if the movie actually had one - you can't be too sure when  you're talking 'bout a PRC movie).
But you watch a film like this not  because of the plot (as a matter of fact, we are introduced to our leading  characters over 20 minutes in the film - considering that the entire  picture runs 58 minutes, it's quite hard to put up some characterization,  but somehow it works) . You watch it because of the stylish, dark  photography, which puts Dreyers ""Vampyr"" into mind (not exactly  surprising, as the German version even starred Sibylle Schmitz of  ""Vampyr""), the scary swamp settings and an overall eerie  attitude. Besides that the movie is quite intelligently written, well-acted  and in its own way haunting.
The DVD transfer is really good considering  the age of the material (I've seen FAR worse transfers of younger films),  even the sound is quite understandable. Only letdown: with 58 minutes of  film, why didn't Image pair it with ""Devil Bat's Daughter""? A  trailer or some accompanying material would've been fine, too.
But  overall enthusiastically recommended to all who have the slightest interest  in expressionistic filmwork - it's a rare example of an American film of  that kind.",968716800,11,2238,4.782722513089006
1238807,2,B00000JT9I,"An unjustly hanged ferryman (played by Charles Middleton of Ming the Merciless fame) lurks around as a ghostly presence in the swamp where he was executed and takes revenge on those responsible.  However he doesn't  appear much since, for the middle half of the film, he is absent apart from  two spliced in close-ups.  Almost atmospheric chiller set in the Louisiana  swamp on a painfully small budget (the ferry goes about 20 yards and almost  all of the action is confined to one set) with a lot of religious  symbolism.  Most of the footage is taken up with Blake Edwards (future Pink  Panther film director) romancing Rosemary La Planche who somehow loves the  horrible swamp and has taken to running the ferry.  This has a cult  reputation but is really not all that good since the horror element is  missing from too much of the film and the climax has La Planche running  everywhere only for Middleton to pop up at all corners (yet he still can't  find Edwards).",953596800,4,970,4.65680473372781

1238826,4,B00000JT9I,"If you enjoy 1930s and 40s classic American horror such as the Universals, or others such as Chloe and White Zombie, you will appreciate this one. I'm not sure why it is often described as a ""fantasy."" It's not. It's an extremely atmospheric ghost story. Some of my favorite scenes from any of aforementioned classics are the fog-bound bogs from The Wolf Man. In Strangler of the Swamp we are treated to an eerie fog-shrouded swamp, creaky docks, dangling nooses, and dirt paths leading to who knows where, all photographed in that beautiful, flat, claustrophobic manner typical of well-devised interior filmmaking. The ghost is creepily presented, and an aura of dread pervades the story, which takes place almost entirely outside, at night in the swamp. This phrase is overused but I will say it: this film is a lost gem, sadly overlooked. For sure Strangler was not brilliantly conceived in the manner of something like The Bride of Frankenstein - it's not in the same league - it was after all a low budget quickie - but it is worth repeated viewing, so I do plan to purchase it because who knows when it might disappear from circulation since it has never risen to classic status.",1440374400,3,1185,4.757281553398058

This is an old black and white movie that I enjoyed a lot.  It is simple and straight forward, but has a simple tenderness between some of the characters.

The Strangler, an innocent man quickly tried, convicted and hung for a crime he did not commit, returns to life to seek vengeance against those responsible for his fate. The movie is interesting only for its cast.  The female lead, Rosemary LaPlanche, was a former Miss America who had a brief movie career.  Blake Edwards plays the young male lead.  He later became a major film director and the husband of Julie Andrews.

Rosemary LaPlanche is the granddaughter of the man whose false testimony got the ferryman lynched.  The budget is very low and the acting mediocre to terrible with the exception of Middleton, best remembered today as the original Ming the Merciless in the FLASH GORDON serials (he's pretty spooky even after almost 70 years).

7913651,4,B00000JT9I,"Of all the so called ""Poverty Row"" studios that flourished in Hollywood from the 1920s through the 1940s, none was cheaper than PRC (Producers Releasing Corporation). They specialized in westerns, action melodramas, and horror pictures and never spent more than $100,000 on any film. Most of their movies were shot in a week or less. Bela Lugosi made THE DEVIL BAT there in 1941 but the studio had no real stars under contract. The Austrian born director Edgar G. Ulmer made several films there of which two, BLUEBEARD w/John Carradine (1944) and the feverish film noir DETOUR (1945) are now classic B Pictures that have developed cult status.

THE STRANGLER OF THE SWAMP (1946) should have developed a cult following but as it has no stars of name value like Lugosi, most people (including fans of ghost stories) have never heard of it. It actually does contain a famous name in the person of Blake Edwards who was briefly a B movie actor before becoming a well known director in the 1960s. Fans of old movies and serials will instantly recognize Charles Middleton as the swamp ghost by his voice (you never clearly see his face). He was Ming the Merciless in the Buster Crabbe FLASH GORDON series.  The female lead Rosemary LaPlanche, a former Miss America, is actually quite good.

The film is a remake of a 1936 German film about a woman ferry operator who sacrifices herself in order to end a curse (THE FLYING DUTCHMAN, anyone?). The director is Frank Wisbar a German immigrant who made the original. He moves the setting to a swamp in the Deep South and uses light, shadow, and lots of studio fog to create a wonderfully oppressive atmosphere. A much later British film, HORROR HOTEL, contains the same kind of atmosphere. Long unavailable, STRANGLER is now part of Amazon's FAT-W (Films Around The World) series of public domain films. If you like old B&W films that drip with atmosphere, look no further. It's even available on Amazon Prime.",1469664000,,1950,4.7804154302670625
