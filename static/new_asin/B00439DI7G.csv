4254286,5,B00439DI7G,"Green Wing is a ""quirky"" comedy series that ran on Channel 4 between 2004 and 2006, consisting of two series of 9 and 8 episodes respectively and a one-off special. The episodes each run for just under an hour and the special 90 minutes.

The series is set in a hospital and follows the fraught and often tortuous relationships of the various employees and their fractured character traits. The series covers a lot of ground and a brief synopsis is almost impossible, but the two highlight plot arcs are:

= An ""on-off"" love triangle between the three surgeons, Caroline Todd, Guy Secretan and Mac MacCartney, (Greig, Manganand Rhind-Tutt) and the attempts of the monumentally wet student doctor Martin (""Fartin"") Dear (Karl Theobald) to break into the triangle and win Todd's affections.

= A rather unconventional love interest between the pompous, stuttering and deeply disturbed radiologist Dr Alan Statham (Mark Heap) and the aging, insecure but sexually aggressive administrator Joanna Clore (Pippa Haywood).

The series relies for its humour on peurile, eccentric, extreme or even surreal behaviour of the protagonists and for the most part it works with plenty of laugh-out-loud moments interspersed with fair doses of ""cringe comedy"" and less extreme forms of amusement.

If I'm honest, though, the concept is sarting to wear by the second series and while the humour remains it seems to be taking second place to the somewhat soapy relationships themselves and by the special, I became a little tired of the whole thing. Some of the surreality goes a little too far and Sue White, the Scottish staff liaison officer played by Michelle Gomez failed to raise a single laugh. Overall, however, this is a great example of good Channel 4 comedy (a genre in itself, I think) and well worth the expense and effort.

I have to say, though, that the one shining star throughout is of course Mark Heap's wonderful performance as Alan Statham and, if other story arcs or characters are losing a little of their comic gloss, you can be sure that Heap will get you rolling on the floor, breathless with laughter. You can hardly call such a parodical character ""well observed""; I think that ""fine tuned"" is probably a better description. Credits also go to Olivia Colman who plays the disorganised and absent minded admin office worker - a far gentler comic performance.

4254303,5,B00439DI7G,"This is so good that I bought a region-free DVD player just so I could watch all the episodes. Laugh out loud funny, it is full of classic British humor: witty put-downs, ridiculous characters, physical comedy, and absurd scenarios. As long as you have no expectations of it making any sense, you'll enjoy it immensely.",1431820800,,319,4.818181818181818
4254304,5,B00439DI7G,This TV series is a little hard to get into for the typical American. It seems raunchy and strange at first. But wow it turns out to be funny brilliant and sad in a way that TV rarely achieves. I love Gray's Anatomy and Green wings kicks its butt.,1401667200,2,247,4.061224489795919
4254305,5,B00439DI7G,"We discovered this show on line and thought that it was hilarious. However, as with several streaming sites, the show was taken down after after a short time. Unfortunately the only DVDs we could find are region 2. So we bought a multi-region DVD\Blue Ray player and now can watch this when ever we want.

If you like goofy British comedy this is one you need to add to your collection. Michelle Gomez as Sue White and Mark Heap as Dr. Statham are two of our most favorite characters in the series, which says a lot because all of the characters in this show are great.",1400284800,,569,4.367924528301887
4254306,5,B00439DI7G,"Green Wing takes place in a provincial British hospital and features a group of the strangest edgiest characters I have ever seen on TV.  Just another example of the kind of show that gets made in Britain, but would never get past the pitch in the States.  Bravo!",1371945600,3,263,4.458333333333333
8414400,2,B00439DI7G,"I simply could not bear the horrid, shouty, tv commercial style music jammed between each scene which made it seem more like a sketch show than a typical sitcom. It is so grating I simply couldn't enjoy the other comic content at all.
It might be possible to watch this on a computer monitor, tablet or smart phone, but it is incredibly annoying on a proper AV system.",1528675200,,368,4.426470588235294
8414401,5,B00439DI7G,"The time I spent watching this show was possibly the strangest of my life.  Strange deviants, the struggling normals, and the crazy selfish interacting in incomprehensible ways made me laugh out loud, and I'm sad it ended as soon as it did.",1526083200,,240,4.714285714285714
8414402,5,B00439DI7G,"Take the wacky storylines and comic dream sequences of ""Scrubs"" minus a lot of that show's sentimental core and feel-good endings, add in the raunchiness of ""Coupling"", dust it all with the peculiarity which can only come from and be exhibited by British humour (yes, humour, not humor), and you get something like ""Green Wing""!

Not enough for you? Okay, it's a show set in a hospital but lacking any medical content, with random fast forward and slow-mo moments for no reason at all. It's weird and wonderful, and I'm so glad I gave that first episode a try!",1524441600,,560,4.656565656565657

8414404,4,B00439DI7G,"This is a highly bizarre, very funny show! If you have a strange sense of humor, you will likely love this. Especially if you like strange British humor. I love Monty Python and the original MASH (novel & film). The ""gas passer"" reminds me greatly of the Trapper John character in the original MASH. Not so much the TV series character. Best of all, it is stylistically unique. If you cannot handle shows that are not just like other shows, you will not like this. But if you like to experience things that are new to you, then you may enjoy this one as much as I did. Give it a try. If you do not love it after the first two episodes, then you never will.
