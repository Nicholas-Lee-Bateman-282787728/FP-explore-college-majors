7971735,5,B00006LPGQ,"I'm a huge fan of Jon Vickers, having seen him at the Met in the 70's, my favorite Otello, a performance with Scotto, was brilliant, and I was lucky to be in attendance at the that stunning production  of Tristan with Nilsson and Vickers in the 70's.  Both of those performances will remain in my memory for as long as I live.",1241913600,2,326,4.241935483870968

I am happy to be the first to review this DVD for you.  This is amazon review #2 from me.  I am probably a bit young to offer proper analysis for this great singers work, but here goes.
Let me just say that Jon Vickers is my Favorite Singer out of a long list of great singers, including Fischer-Dieskau and Domingo.  I have been inspired by his work for the last six years since I was first introduced to this leagendary voice on one of his recordings of Don Jose in Carmen.
This video performance made in his fourth, and last, decade of public performance finds Vickers in, still, fine vocal condition. Yes, the high chest register, so profoundly present in the two previous decades is not what it once was( yet the lovely pianissimo head tones are still as glimming and haunting as ever).
All four excerpts are well introduced, and there is a fine digitally remastered excerpt of his work from a 1960s concert performance of ""Die Walkure.
In this video includes work that will set the standard of performance and interpretation for all Heldentenors and heroic singers to come.
There are many of us who will miss Vickers when he is gone.  The Opera world won't see much of his like again.  All of his recorded and preserved work is invaluable.
I highly recommend this DVD for all Singing Artists.
PS.  As always will be the case, his excerpts of his work of Peter Grimes are worth the price of the whole product alone.",1081987200,16,1428,4.515503875968992
