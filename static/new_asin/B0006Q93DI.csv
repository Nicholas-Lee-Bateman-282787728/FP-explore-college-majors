2191408,5,B0006Q93DI,"If you enjoy dunks, you will enjoy this DVD.  The disc also includes the entire dunk contest of 2000 and 2005.  It is also cool watching the players talk about each other's favorite and most incredible dunks.  I got this title 2 days ago and have already watched it twice!",1212192000,,272,4.4

2191411,3,B0006Q93DI,"This was pretty good, but not as good as I thought it may be.  The main reason for this was that it doesn't have just non-stop and back-to-back dunk clips, it has to interview every player that does them.  It would be nice if it were just like the FURIOUS FINISHES: bonus buzzerbeater feature, of course with dunks though.",1127088000,4,322,4.440677966101695
2191412,4,B0006Q93DI,"this dvd was not as good as the version from last year. One thing that made me like it is that they included the entire 2000 Slam Dunk Contest w/ VC, T-Mac, and Stevie Franchise. That's one thing that would make you want to buy this.",1108598400,3,233,4.086956521739131
2191413,4,B0006Q93DI,"The 2000 slam dunk contest showcased a 20 year old T-Mac, a rookie Steve-O Franchise, and a second year Vince Carter. Everyone knows that Carter burst into the scene with this one, taking home the trophy. Not to be outdone was Steve-O, who placed second with his acrobatic jams. T-Mac assisted VC on his perfect 50 dunk, the one that prompted TNT's Kenny Smith to yell ""It's over, it's over!!"" and was an instant classic.

The rest of the DVD shows highlight reel slams, 2004's best jams, the rookie game dunkathon from 2004, and includes a bonus music CD. I don't like Clue, unfortunately he is the host, so it is only 4 stars. Otherwise this is a getter.",1108425600,8,656,4.512605042016807
