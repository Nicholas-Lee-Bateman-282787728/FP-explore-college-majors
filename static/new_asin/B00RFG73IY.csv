6930211,4,B00RFG73IY,"this was a cute movie for the order. I thought it was going to be longer than 60 minutes however my daughter who is 5, loved it.",1426464000,,128,3.7777777777777777
6930212,5,B00RFG73IY,"Just pre-ordered. Usually not a fan of ""short films"". But this also includes the very hard to find short films LEGEND OF THE BONEKNAPPER DRAGON and BOOK OF DRAGONS. Thats 3 half hour shorts for $6.50 and its everything the kids are lacking for the complete collection.",1424131200,4,268,4.723404255319149

Every One even adults were thrilled with watching them and filling in all the missing gaps. Was very entertaining to all ages.  Is a must if you have the 1st and 2nd/last movie.  Buy the Complete Series to see why, what, when and so forth",1484265600,,335,4.442622950819672

6930229,3,B00RFG73IY,"I saw the running time on this at about 60 minutes, that it was a continuation of the movies and TV episodes, and picked it up for ten bucks. Listing this title at a 60-minute running time without clearly marking the packaging that the one new feature only runs about 20 minutes is a case of retail bait-and-switch, like the various Dreamworks' 20 minute holiday shorts packaged on what could be a feature length DVD.",1459209600,,417,4.573333333333333

6930233,4,B00RFG73IY,"I loved the VERY VERY Short movie. It was way over priced, but if your kids enjoy Hiccup and Toothless this disc tells the story how dragon racing began.  I didn't give 5 stars because the price was to high for a 28 minutes episode.",1447459200,,232,4.155555555555556

6930241,1,B00RFG73IY,"Drivel.  Whiny-voiced characters who promote a callous attitude to animal abuse (film opens with teenagers propelling sheep out of a giant slingshot for 'training').  If they're being raised on dreck like this, it's no wonder some kids treat pets and farm animals as disposable commodities with no ability to feel fear and pain.",1436054400,,328,5.169811320754717

6930250,3,B00RFG73IY,The title episode is great. Brings it back to where the show ended but before the 2nd movie has taken place.  The two bonus features are totally different and are basically a cartoon story within the animation. My son loves this series but was not impressed by the two bonuses.  Overall for the price I'm happy with the one episode but it also shipped later than I was guaranteed.,1428710400,2,380,4.492753623188406

8695281,5,B00RFG73IY,"This is a fun movie with Hiccup as an older teenager reminiscing with his friends on how Dragon Races first started. There is no cussing or using God's name in vain in these episodes, however, there is a lot of using mythological god's names used instead (weird). If you're a fan of Hiccup and the gang, this DVD is a must.",1505865600,,323,4.311475409836065

8695286,5,B00RFG73IY,"This is a fun little short that tells you the story of how Berk started Dragon Racing. This short takes place after Defenders of Berk and before Race to the Edge of the Dreamworks Dragons TV show. Hiccup and his friend start reminiscing on the past where they first came up with the idea for Dragon Racing. If you're a fan of Dreamworks Dragons, this will be very entertaining for you and a great addition to your collection if you love the TV series.",1487203200,,451,4.380952380952381
