4856628,3,B003FSTVFO,"The review we wrote for another title in this series applies here also: We expected a ""RV"" orientated trip but this turned out to be a standard travelogue. For what it is it is fine, but as new owners of a RV we expected much more information on the RV aspects of the trip... information on RV campgrounds and other RV specific information would have been appreciated. The film makers should take the ""RV"" out of the title... it is just a colorful general travelogue.",1411516800,2,467,4.5058823529411764
4856629,2,B003FSTVFO,"While the sights were nice, the fact that they were travelling with an RV-and any info really pertinent to that-was almost an afterthought. I'd have liked to see more about where they stayed, what type of facilities there were, etc.",1393200000,,232,4.825
4856630,4,B003FSTVFO,"We planning a trip to Alaska next year and we are pleased with the information that is provided in this video which has helped us to begin the planning phase of our trip.
Thank you for a job well done.",1388793600,,201,4.05
4856631,4,B003FSTVFO,What a great way to see Alaska at your own pace! You have a nice warm place to go on the bad weather days which are part of the adventure.,1388707200,,138,3.6333333333333333
4856632,5,B003FSTVFO,Great story about island hopping trip to Alaska where roads are few and far between. Really enjoyed this and the companion piece about actually driving to Alaska.,1379721600,,162,5.037037037037037
4856633,5,B003FSTVFO,Very nicely done with focus on the natural wonders of Alaska's inside passage.  We thoroughly enjoyed this in anticipation of our Alaska cruise.,1373328000,,144,5.260869565217392
4856634,5,B003FSTVFO,"Very well done. What a wonderful adventure. I have always thought of taking an RV through the inside passage. This is a beautiful look at what it would be like to do just that.
The music and video are great.",1358208000,,207,4.2
8482513,4,B003FSTVFO,I enjoyed it. The pictures were wonderful,1470873600,,41,5.0
8482514,3,B003FSTVFO,"The general information is not very concise and not complete. Some sections are really written in a way that makes me think the author was paid for each word written. A good editor could reduce the seize of those sections 50% without any loss to the content.

The main part of the boos is basically description after description of each campsite and RV park and brief descriptions of destinations.

Certainly this book is helpful, GPS coordinates very much help, too.",1469318400,,467,4.825
8482515,5,B003FSTVFO,I simply cannot wait to go and see this wonder of the world....,1465171200,,63,3.923076923076923
8482516,4,B003FSTVFO,"Beautiful scenery, but would have liked some idea of the cost of some of the ferry travel and boat trips.",1458086400,,105,4.3
8482517,3,B003FSTVFO,"Interesting video, but too bad it's not HD.",1458000000,,43,4.5
8482518,2,B003FSTVFO,This had pretty much zero to do with RV's except mentioning that you can actually take the RV on this trip. There was some interesting info on stops along the ferry route but that's about it.,1456876800,,191,4.333333333333333
8482519,5,B003FSTVFO,It covered a lot of places the cruise ships don't go. Great Video.,1446768000,,66,4.153846153846154
8482520,4,B003FSTVFO,Nicely done.,1444521600,,12,5.5
