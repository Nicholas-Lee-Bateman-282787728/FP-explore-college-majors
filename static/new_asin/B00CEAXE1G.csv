5717294,2,B00CEAXE1G,"Very disappointing!!!!!  Giving this only two stars because only two movies there able to play.  Third one would not come up and so it knocked out the forth one.  If the DVD had not been so cheap I would have sent it back.  Just marked it up to ""you get what you pay for""  One of lifs little lessons.",1404432000,15,300,4.016949152542373

5717354,1,B00CEAXE1G,I am halfway through the movie that is supposed to have Tom Selleck in it. Super dumb. I think he has appeared 4 or 5 times at this point. Did not like the first movie either. Too much war and not enough cowboy.,1434758400,4,211,3.9302325581395348
5717355,2,B00CEAXE1G,"On the disk the movie Superdome pixels out It is very annoying even though the rest of the movies are ok, it is not what I had expected from a commercial DVD Pretty bad!  Mike",1434240000,4,175,4.0
5717366,1,B00CEAXE1G,I read all 12 reviews before I bought this DVD because I figured at least one of them would name the four movies on them. No such luck. The first movie is Gone to Texas starring Sam Elliot who plays Sam Houston during the period after the Alamo and before Texas became a state. I will fight no more forever with Sam Elliot about the Nez Pierce tribe of indians who were the last indians forced onto a reservation and how they were forced onto the reservation. Superdome with cameo appearances from Tom Selleck about a football team that was expected to win the superbowl and how gamblers went about trying to cause the team to lose so they could win their bet. This is the only movie that had Tom Sellect in it and he does not wear a hat liked pictured on the DVD case. Blue river with Sam Elliot about two brothers who had been estranged for 15 years and how they because estranged. I already had the first 2 and did not like the last 2. If someone had listed the movies I would not have bought this DVD.,1433462400,45,1005,4.212435233160622
