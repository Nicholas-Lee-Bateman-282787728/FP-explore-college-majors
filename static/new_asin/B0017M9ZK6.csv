8266591,5,B0017M9ZK6,Six more Dvd's from Nature films and I am still impressed. Living in South Australia I can say that we have as many Great White Pointer sharks around the Port Lincoln area as in the Red Triangle. These programs are just a delight to watch.,1468108800,,239,4.333333333333333

8266593,5,B0017M9ZK6,"NATURE LOVERS TO CHILDREN AND EVEN OLD FARTS...THIS IS A VERY EXCELLENT DVD.  GOOD FOOTAGE ON MANY SUBJECTS RELATED TO THOSE BEAUTIFUL MOUNTAINS WHERE MANY HAVE NEVER BEEN WALKED UPON BY MEN.  THERE IS MUCH FINE WILDLIFE FOOTAGE AND MORE.  IF YOU LOVE NATURE AND ALL HER GLORIES...THIS IS TRULY A FINE DVD TO KEEP ON THE SHELF AND EVEN DONATE TO YOUR LOCAL LIBRARY OR SCHOOL.  MY DVD WAS NEW AND VERY CHEAP...IT WAS DELIVERED QUICKLY IN PROTECTIVE PACKAGING.  I PLAN TO BUY ONE MORE TO DONATE. OVERALL, I WILL RATE THIS DVD AT A MUST HAVE 10....ESPECIALLY AT THE PRICE. SERIOUSLY, YOU CAN'T GO WRONG IF YOU ADD THIS TO YOUR NATURE COLLECTION.",1395878400,,642,4.547826086956522
