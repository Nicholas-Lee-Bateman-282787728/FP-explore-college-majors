7983712,2,B00008G92N,Just another bad low-budget Urban movie.  You watch it once and you are unlikely to desire to watch it again.,1367798400,,109,4.45
7983713,1,B00008G92N,"This is not so bad, it's good: it exemplifies pure badness!  Countless people die in this film in that extra-fake, ""Dr. Who"" style.  They often have the ubiquitous line of ketchup-acting-as-blood on their forehead or near their lips afterward.  Instead of showing one murder to illustrate that a duo is cold-blooded; they show four, similar murders in a row.  Next, a woman gets into an expensive red car four times in a row.  The main character is often seen shirtless here.  But he ain't Action Jackson or Mr. Marcus!  His chest was not impressive.  Many of the roles that should have been played by middle-aged actors were played by people 25 years old or younger.  If I were from NY, I would be horribly upset about how this low-budget stinker misrepresents my city.  Awful, awful, awful!  Please don't make the mistake I made wasting time in my life to see this.",1245888000,,867,4.675496688741722
