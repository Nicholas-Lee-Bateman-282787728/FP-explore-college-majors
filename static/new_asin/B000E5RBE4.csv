2494410,2,B000E5RBE4,"I got this as soon as I could from Amazon, but I'm disappointed to report that this was a poor recording of the 2006 Rose Bowl game.

First of all, it's in 4:3 fullscreen standard definition, which was hugely disappointing since I originally saw it in beautiful HD.  I can't believe ABC couldn't spend enough to record this in widescreen.

Even worse, it's a flaky standard definition recording.  There are several instances of snow and blurry patches in the playback.

Overall, I'm hugely disappointed that the game didn't get the first class DVD treatment it deserved.",1143417600,15,570,4.895833333333333

2494492,5,B000E5RBE4,The picture is pristine and feels like your watching HD - it's awesome quality . Probably the greatest college football game ever and Reggie Bush and Vince Young out on an absolute show in this game. Should be in every college football fan collection .

2494494,5,B000E5RBE4,"I saw some comments that this is not in HD, but at least my copy is.  It is in wide screen, and the colors are stunning.  There are a few short parts (seconds not minutes) where there are glitches (pixilation, and hickups), but they don't bother me too much.",1363996800,3,258,4.244897959183674

2494497,2,B000E5RBE4,"The game is 5 of 5 stars.  The video is below par.  I too saw this in HD and I would have paid double to have it on bluray format.  The best game of all time and it was sold in a grainy, 480p, 4:3, 1989, VHS lookalike format  ??  What a waste.",1310601600,,243,3.509433962264151
2494548,1,B000E5RBE4,"I read the other reviews here about the poor quality of the DVD, but decided to buy it anyway because I'm a fan, and watching that game live was such an amazing experience. I returned the DVD. The picture quality truly is horrible. It is not hi-def, it is not even regular-def. It is, as someone else here said, a poor copy of a poor recording on a VHS tape. It's so bad the picture is actually pixelated. Don't waste your time or money.",1261008000,2,437,4.214285714285714
2494549,5,B000E5RBE4,"Bought this as a surprise gift for my husband.  He was totally thrilled and never even mentioned the quality.  He is thrilled to have a copy of this Longhorn history to enjoy.  When the Horns aren't in the championship game, he just puts in this DVD and pretends they're winning all over again!  Also bought him the Live the Dream season highlights, but the game disc was much better.  Don't remember him ever getting out the highlights DVD again after the first time, but we see the game, or at least the last quarter, at least once a year.",1247616000,,541,4.424242424242424
2494550,5,B000E5RBE4,"This dvd is a must have for all Texas Longhorns fans! Before I ordered this dvd, I was concerned, because the description said that the dvd is only 90 minutes long. Do not worry, because the entire game is on the dvd. It also has postgame interviews, but sometimes you can not hear the questions being asked. The special features are also good. The special features include interviews with Vince Young, his offensive lineman, and some game footage of Texas v.s. Ohio State, and Texas v.s. Oaklahoma. I hope this review helps you, big tex",1242777600,,537,4.663157894736842
2494551,5,B000E5RBE4,"ABC did a very good job with this dvd.  Texas came back and beat USC to claim the national championship in 2005.  USC was hailed as the greatest team ever in college football.  What they did not have was the greatest player, well at least in the last 20 yrs to play.  Vince Young the previous year single handidly beat Michigan in the Rose Bowl and basically did the same against USC.

Get the Texas vs Michigan 2004 Rose Bowl.  Its as good if not better.",1233014400,,455,4.232558139534884
2494552,4,B000E5RBE4,"Unfortunately we are in an age of HD and super-crisp picture quality that we've become spoiled.  The game is awesome and yes, the picture is not HD quality, but it's not 1988 quality either.  After reading the reviews and buying the DVD, I was expecting digital squares all over the screen.  It was definitely watchable and there are select replays where you think the picture's not primo quality, but let's not be big babies about it.  However, if you're a HD snob and you want this DVD in the highest quality, my suggestion is to buy a Blu-Ray player and slap it in there...it automatically upgrades the picture quality to twice the resolution.",1231286400,,646,4.6902654867256635

2494554,3,B000E5RBE4,I was hoping for DVD to include game highlights and commentary.  All it incliuded was the game and the game only.,1215993600,,113,4.380952380952381
2494555,5,B000E5RBE4,"I just finished reading all of the reviews of this DVD and let me tell you that this is a great DVD for the average fan.  I have no idea what to tell you if you're here looking for a great ""digital transfer"" or what not.  All that I know, is that this was possibly the greatest National Championship of all-time featuring the arguably best college football player of all time in Vince Young.

The DVD features the entire game with the original game commentary but minus all the commercials.  As I said, I don't really care about the quality of the video.  It is good enough to watch and enjoy the game, jus as if you were watching it on TV.  I can't say much more than that about the quality; however, it brings back so many memories about that great game, that great team, and of course Vince Young himself!  You need to make this DVD a part of your collection if you are a true Longhorn fan!",1202515200,,893,4.2176470588235295
2494556,1,B000E5RBE4,"This is an excellent game, and when it got transferred to DVD, it seems like SOMEONE in Marketing thought it'd be a cool idea to cram THE WHOLE GAME on one disc to save money. The problem is, when you cram 4 hours of content on a single disc like that, you're going to have to lessen the quality of the video and maybe even the audio. And OH GOD, did they ever SCREW the video quality. It's pixellated GUTTER TRASH that completely insults this great game.

You better hope that this DVD gets re-released in a 2 or 3-dvd box set, because this is a slap in the face. They kicked us down and spit on us. Do NOT buy this DVD, and make sure ""DVD Marketing (oh, that's a good one), Inc.) knows that this is UNACCEPTABLE.",1197158400,,714,4.136690647482014
2494557,1,B000E5RBE4,"I bought this video for $9.99 at the checkout line of our local grocery store.  The previous reviewers comments were right, the video quality is on par with an old VHS.  I'm going to have to shell out a bit more money for the other DVD videos that are out there.  Looks like they have more stars, probably an indication of the quality.",1194480000,2,335,4.285714285714286

2494619,4,B000E5RBE4,"Prior to the 2006 Rose Bowl, UT managed to go undefeated, benefitting fully from a severely depleted Big XII in 2005.  USC went undefeated in a characteristically weak Pac 10 during the same season.  The first three quarters of the 2006 Rose Bowl game, UT managed to hold on only by the skin of its teeth.  In the fourth quarter, Vince Young, who must have gotten into UT through a remedial student program judging from his grammar, was simply magic.  The 2005 Longhorn team rose above 36 years of futility to stand at the top of the college football heap for the third time in its long football history, joining the 1963 and 1969 Longhorn teams as national champions.  (UT claims the 1970 championship, which in fact belonged to Nebraska after UT fell to the Joe Theismann led Fighting Irish team in the 1971 Cotton Bowl.)",1155081600,3,823,4.609589041095891
2494620,4,B000E5RBE4,"This was probably the greatest game of all time, with the greatest individual preformance of all time. However that wasn't enough to keep them from presenting it with low-quality picture. Also, if you're a USC fan the commentary should seem just fine. But, if you're a Texas Fan or indifferent, get ready for the most biased broadcast I have ever seen or heard. The same biased anouncer constantly makes the wrong calls of whats happening on the field and his co-anouncer carries him through the game. However this was not the makers of the DVD's fault, just the wrong choice of anouncer by ABC.",1154304000,7,595,4.730769230769231

2494622,1,B000E5RBE4,"I didn't buy this DVD. I watched it though when a friend of mine bought it. This was probably the best college football game I have ever seen! This DVD does this beautiful game a huge injustice with the video quality. I can't understand WHY this all time classic game was not respected enough to produce a quality DVD recording of the game. This game I guarantee will become legendary... things we tell our grandchildren about. Yet we wouldn't be able to show our grandchildren because they wouldn't be able to handle all the pixelation! If you just want to relive the memories... (which are probably more clear than this dvd), then go ahead and buy this dvd. But if you want to collect this game and give it the respect it deserves with a quality recording, then find someone who recorded it with their dvr, or some other recording that actually appreciated this wonderful game. It was a wonderful college football season, an outstanding college postseason, a super-hyped up matchup, and a legendary and unforgettable championship game... oh yeah, and a poor recording to show for it. And all I can ask is WHY? They should fire the whole media department would put this DVD on the market!",1153872000,8,1189,4.69377990430622

2494624,5,B000E5RBE4,"For those of us who were eyewitnesses of this game, this DVD is a must. I am a USC alum, but this was still probably the greatest game in college football history. It reminded me of what Pete Rose said after losing game six of the 1975 World Series: ""It was a privilege just to play in this game.""

Well, being at the Rose Bowl on January 4, 2006 was a privilege, win or lose. I experienced it with my daughter, and it was a treasured memory, never to be forgotten. . . again, even in defeat!

That said, the DVD does what watching the game in person does not: reveal USC's many miscalculations, mistakes, mental errors, decisions gone awry, and agonizingly, barely-by-inches calls and plays that cost them. . . any one of which would have assured victory instead of losing that 12-point lead with five minutes left.

This DVD does definitely bring back the sights, sounds and smells of that perfect, sunny winter day in the Arroyo Seco, the pre-game festivities, hours of hob-nobbing with old and new friends, and of course magical performances by Matt Leinart and Vince Young. This will go down with the 1979 Indiana State-Michigan State Final Four game between Larry Bird and Magic Johnson as a groundbreaking, seminal sports event. Young, Leinart, Reggie Bush and others will battle each other over the next decade for NFL supremacy, and this game will mark the beginning of the rivalry! Pete Carroll always said a team would have to play great to end his winning streak, and indeed I can only think of one other college performance to rival Young's: Joe Montana, bringing Notre Dame back vs. USC in a 1978 loss at the Coliseum. Young was greatness personified, just like Joe.

We will never see another team like USC. They were the greatest team of all time, which is just a way of expresing admiration that the only team that could have beaten them was the 2005 Longhorns with Young at QB.

One last note: It was a bitter loss for USC, but assuaged by the wonderful sportsmanship of the Texas faithful. They were loud and boisterous, but polite, respectful, and knew the traditions of not just Texas but USC, too. It was a pleasure to speak with them, and if we had to lose they were better than some of the foul-mouths who often express jealousy at Trojan greatness. Their women were beautiful, their children respectful, even in celebration. Hook 'em Horns!

2494625,1,B000E5RBE4,"After waiting 5+ weeks for this dvd after I ordered it, and 3+ months after the game itself, I am saddened to report that the picture quality on this dvd horrible. I bought this dvd because I failed to record the game on my dvr (through user error). I assumed that an officially licensed dvd of the game would be better quality than I could have recorded, but I was wrong. I can record and burn dvds of better quality than this on my dvr. The picture on this dvd looks like VHS. This is, by far, the worst dvd picture I have ever seen. Shame on ABC/ESPN for ever licensing this bootleg-quality product.

This is the greatest game of the year, and one of the greatest of all time. It deserves better. If there is another dvd available, buy it instead of this one. If you can get a copy from a friend who recorded it on his dvr at home, get that one instead of this. Whatever you do, DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!",1144627200,23,902,4.125
2494626,1,B000E5RBE4,"I bought this because I was wantinga  copy of the game and something to bring back memories of a great season for UT.  What I got was dissapointment.

If you just want a copy of the ABC TV broadcast, a few extras that are so poorly done they aren't worth having, and resolution that is so crude that you see pixelation that appears to be composed of Legos, this is the DVD for you.

This looks like someone took a VHS copy of the game, captured it at LOW resolution, and burned it to a disk.  Really, really bad, but it's what's available.  I guess they thought the fans would buy ANYTHING and, sadly, they are probably correct.  So if you HAVE to have a copy (UT grads), buy it.  Otherwise, don't support this kind of shoddy, thrown together junk.

Oh, Vince Young is a GOD.  Just watch the last 6 minutes and you'll see why.",1144368000,5,826,4.237179487179487
2494627,5,B000E5RBE4,"This is one of the greatest games that i missed, 3 quarters anyway.  I only saw the 4th qtr and wished i had seen the entire game.  Now i can see this entertainingly high-scoring, last-minute affair with many future NFL stars on this dvd.  As a previous reviewer stated though, the video/image quality is somewhat poor(the audio isn't great either).  During some replays or image transitions, you can see some pixellated images.  The closer you are to the screen, the more noticeable the flaws will be of course and overall it's definitely not up to quality dvd standards.  Having said that, it still is watchable and the visuals are usually good enough for the most part as the color is vivid and if you watch it in its natural 4:3 mode, it looks really good and sharp at times. (note: i was watching the dvd on a 52"" rca hdtv-compatible big-screen and a philips 60"" hd-built in tv.  it looks better if you view it in fullscreen mode, but i like to watch it in panoramic/16:9 view on my big-screen, which unfortunately stretches the images a little and hence the extra pixellation).

As for the content, it delivers in this area.
*  A handful of brief featurettes concerning the University of Texas football team, with an emphasis on Vince Young.
*  The game in its entirety, including a pre-game bit with Will Ferrel/USC vs Matt McCounaghy(sp)/Texas.
*  AND GET THIS...two condensed, bonus highlights of the great game between Texas and Ohio State, and the blowout between Texas and OU!  I was not expecting this and was pleasantly surprised they were on there(esp the classic with THE Ohio State).  (note: these highlights have terrible bootleg-looking image quality, but still watchable)

This is how i would rate this release:
5 stars, if you loved the game or love college football, you've got to have it in your collection.
5 stars, if you're a Texas fan.  A national championship you won, plus bonus features including 2 other game highlights.
3 stars, if you loved the game or the Texas Longhorns and demand only the best picture quality available because of it.  This dvd will let you down in that case.

Personally, i thought the game was great enough to offset the the not-so-great image quality(which is still very watchable imo and comparable to other releases of this type).  Overall, highly recommended; but i do wish they would do a better job putting these dvd's together concerning quality control.",1143676800,14,2417,4.783132530120482

8106162,5,B000E5RBE4,"This may be the greatest national championship game played. Until a few years ago, this was definitely true. With Florida State/Auburn and Clemson/Alabama x2, it still may be but it is no longer a stand alone thing.
Offered without commercial interruption, this is ABC's complete telecast of the 2006 ROSE BOWL with condensed pregame and postgame but no halftime. An occasional edited huddle also is part of the production.
Reading other reviews, picture quality comes up quite a bit. Personally, the quality seemed very good. I didn't go into it expecting a high definition experience(it isn't) because this isn't a Blu-ray(which is offered) so there was no disappointment for me. Some of the poor quality referred to in other reviews only occurred from a certain camera angle which means it was part of the telecast and not a dvd issue.

I was given the DVD version of this game as a Father's Day gift a few years ago.  I had seen the game numerous times on the Longhorn Network, and didn't watch the DVD until two years after I received it.  I was so disappointed in the quality that I vowed never to watch is again from the DVD.  I just purchased the Blu-ray Disc version, and man what a difference.  The quality was pure HD.  I was prepared to send it back right after I received it if the resolution wasn't any better than the DVD version, due to the one negative feedback post that stated it wasn't Blu-ray quality, but I was pleasantly surprised, and enjoyed every minute.  This is the real deal, I give it the highest rating, and encourage you to buy ONLY this version and not the DVD version.  The only thing that you won't get in the Blu-ray version that I received in my DVD version is a glossy of each team USC and Texas played, and the score of each game that was played for the 2005 season.
