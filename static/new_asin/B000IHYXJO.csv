2657491,5,B000IHYXJO,"The success of Perry Mason is that it a mystery series first and a courtroom drama second.  Plus, the casting was perfect, just perfect.  The crusty Old Tragg with a heart of gold, the imminently loyal Della, the interminable bachelor Paul, and of course Perry who is always two or three steps ahead of everyone else.  The rigid Hamilton Burger could not have been better cast, and who can forget each time he objected to Perry's antics in the courtroom as being irrelevant, incompetent, and immaterial.  As with the first volume, my kids are all over these DVDs and enjoy them without hesitation - but better yet they enjoy guessing and betting who the killer is.  Not to mention that my kids have now found out that the Blue Brothers recorded a cover of the Perry Mason theme song.  Who would've thunk?",1166313600,8,804,4.626760563380282
2657492,5,B000IHYXJO,"What a treat to see high quality un-cut Perry Mason episodes on DVD. The show has been in syndication for years but you have been watching cut up versions so more commercials could be shown. Now you can enjoy the full length of 52 minutes that each Perry Mason episode lasted.

Each episode you see Perry Mason defending his clients rights to the fullest with zeal and uses his sharp wit to fluster those who would do his client harm. In episode ""The Case of the One-Eyed Witness"" look for a young Angie Dickinson.",1165968000,7,514,4.468085106382978
2657493,4,B000IHYXJO,"Just in time for the holidays, we get the final 19 episodes of the first and one of the best seasons of Perry Mason.

Raymond Burr imbues his performance with a sophistication and toughness that became the standard for future shows about lawyers.  Along with a light touch of humor that is very refreshing in contrast to the more somber elements of his cases.  It's these lighter scenes with his confidential secretary Della Street (the ""Beautiful"" Barbara Hale) and detective Paul Drake (the constantly smoking William Hopper) that make this series a joy to watch.

William Tallman is the decent, yet appropriately stuffy as the world's least successful DA Hamilton Burger along with the world's oldest police Lieutenant Tragg as played by Ray Collins who were akin to the Washington Generals of the show.

All episode titles begin with ""The Case of..."" and each show has its own merits. Although some can strain credulity like ""The Case of the Deadly Double""; which relies on a key figure having a true split personality.  But the show is at its best when combining desperate characters in a post-film noir like setting with Perry coming to save the day.  Especially when there is enough room to let the natural chemistry of Burr, Hale, & Hopper play out.

Like the first volume, there are really no extras in this set unless you include previews of other DVD releases.  The back of each DVD case promises that the episodes are shown in the order they were originally broadcast, yet we get no airdate for each show.  At least the Menu screens have publicity photos taken during that time.  There are mostly Raymond Burr looking somewhat bemused (and colorized) and holding either a paper with ""Murder"" in the title or an actual Perry Mason pulp novel.

Admittedly, this set is a bit pricey considering it's rather bare bones.  However it's great to see these episodes in their original, uncut form.  I heartily recommend it to anyone who enjoyed this series and seeing some fine actors at the top of their game.

Tidbits:

Look for a young and very sexy Angie Dickenson in ""The Case of the One Eyed Witness"".

Della's taste for fashion is usually conservative, although in ""The Case of the Screaming Woman"" the striped blouse she wears in the apartment scene matches her gloves perfectly.

In ""The Case of the Fiery Fingers"" has the client complimenting Della on being ""quiet"", which may be a subtle recognition of the fact that she often says little during an episode.

Future ""Commissioner Gordon"" Neil Hamilton and future ""Batgirl"" Yvonne Craig of the original ""Batman"" TV series can both be seen in ""The Case of the Lazy Lover"". Also in the same episode, the long shots of Perry and Paul driving up to the hotel room are clearly NOT Raymond Burr and William Hopper.",1165363200,16,2771,4.783613445378151
2657494,5,B000IHYXJO,"I am so happy to see these wonderful old shows being released on DVD. I do not watch the TV shows of today. I find them lacking talent, boring, cheap and a sad reflection of our times. In my opinion, wonderful shows like Perry Mason, represent TV at its finest.  Great acting, great stars and wonderful writing. I recommend this set to anyone who loves vintage television. The transfers and sound are wonderful! Watching these great old shows bring back a time when life was simpler and we did not have to watch our fellow man eat bugs to get their 15 minutes of fame.

2657499,5,B000IHYXJO,"Perry Mason was certainly the finest courtroom drama ever on television. It was entertainment that kept viewers glued to their seats, waiting for that moment when Perry would nail the killer on the witness stand and free his client.

Raymond Burr had some good roles in films, but will always be remembered for the tough defense attorney you wanted on your side in the toughest jam. Barbara Hale was his pretty secretary, Della Street, who kept Perry human and was in love with him. William Hopper was the dapper detective, Paul Drake. He had a playful and flirtatious relationship with Della but every viewer knew that secretly her heart belonged to Perry.

William Talman as D.A. Hamilton Burger was the perfectly cast guy you almost felt sorry for, as just when he was ready to gloat over his victory in court, Perry would spring his client by revealing the real killer, once again defeating poor old Burger. The relationship of these four people made the mood and mystery of the often gripping conclusion fun to watch. There has never been anything close to it in genre on television since. Its mix of drama, noir, and humor, and its truly likable characters, made for terrific viewing.

Earle Stanley Gardner's original creation of Perry Mason was a bit more two-fisted pulp type reading, but slowly grew into something resembling the show when it became so popular. Gardner's Perry Mason novels, begun decades before the show and continuing for decades more, are still fun to read. The same can be said of every single show in the series.

The first season, unlike many shows, hit its stride immediately, and remained top-notch television for many years. Like the novels, the title of every episode began with ""The Case of-"" and each one had some wonderful moments, both in and out of the courtroom. Only the first 19 episodes were included on the first release, with the final batch from the first season included on this one. The episodes for season one, all 39 of them, beginning in the fall of 1957 and ending in 1958, are as follows:

THE CASE OF THE------- Restless Redhead -- Sleepwalker's Niece -- Nervous Accomplice -- Drowning Duck -- Sulky Girl -- Silent Partner -- Angry Mourner -- Crimson Kiss -- Vagabond Vixen -- Runaway Corpse -- Crooked Candle -- Negligent Nymph -- Moth-Eaten Mink -- Baited Hook -- Fan-Dancer's Horse -- Demure Defendant -- Sun Bather's Diary -- Cautious Coquette -- Haunted Husband -- Lonely Heiress -- Green-Eyed Sister -- Fugitive Nurse -- One-Eyed Witness -- Deadly Double -- Empty Tin -- Half-Wakened Wife -- Desperate Daughter -- Daring Decoy -- Hesitant Hostess -- Screaming Woman -- Fiery Fingers -- Substitute Face -- Long-Legged Models -- Gilded Lily -- Lazy Lover -- Prodigal Parent -- Black-Eyed Blonde -- Terrified Typist -- Rolling Bones

You can't beat this for entertainment, any more than Hamilton Burger could beat Perry Mason in court. There were great stories, often taking Perry out of the courtroom and his office, but always returning in those final moments of doom for the real murderer. This is one DVD release that everyone who loves great television will want to own. Just hearing that opening theme song will make you nostalgic. Don't pass this one up.",1158624000,155,3221,4.85792349726776

These TV films from 1958 are mostly the simplified and condensed versions of the original novels by Erle Stanley Gardner. The books are more complete and informative but the films still tell stories about life that is not experienced by most people. The books can tell you why certain things are done, the films only show you what happened. The books tell you about ropers, rough or smooth shadows, and how to evade surveillance and avoid leaving a back trail. Some may question the legality and ethics of Perry Masons tactics but most stories were written before the modern legal rules of the 1960s. The backgrounds tell about life in Los Angeles. It is difficult to film a scene at night but easy to describe it in a book. Erle Stanley Gardner was the founder of the ""Court of Last Resort"" which sought to free many unjustly convicted persons. Gardner, among others, sought to use scientific means to find the guilty, rather than using hunches or guesses alone.

Some of the stories and names were changed for TV [and added politics!]. The theme music is typical for the late 1950s. Note the style of clothing and culture; ladies wore white gloves. People seldom lock their doors. The prices date these films (35 cents for hamburger with fries). One advantage is seeing the many automobiles from that era (no Studebakers or Hudsons). How many can you identify? Note the slimness of people then, and the familiarity with pistols. Smoking was very common [a tobacco sponsor]. Watch how the actors express their emotions by their facial expressions. Dont blink or sneeze! The camera sharpness and quality is excellent on these films.. There is nothing like these entertaining and dramatic stories on todays broadcast TV. When was the last time you saw a trial lawyer as a hero? These stories often use the misinterpretation of circumstantial evidence to provide dramatic effects. The courtroom scenes are usually the Preliminary Hearings [this saved the cost of extra actors]. Some of the stories were greatly modified from the novels. The cars tell of product placement. Note how many years of output were used in the first season. All titles begin with The Case of the .

If you like the show, what's not to like about this set?  We already had the first half of this season and continued on here.  It's interesting to see the early episodes after having viewed later seasons.  The character of Perry Mason is slightly different - he smokes, is a bit more volatile, regularly goes beyond the bounds of the law (for a good cause), wears louder sport coats, and initially - briefly - dons a hat.  The other characters are virtually unchanged, but there are a few running themes absent in later episodes; it seems that Perry's bar membership and Paul Drake's PI license are on the line with every case.

Although each episode follows an almost identical template and trajectory, the series somehow remains interesting and even challenging.  Several episodes have so many details, characters, subplots and twists that I'm ultimately lost, but it hardly matters.  The show has great production values, crackling noir dialogue, the running rivalry between Berger/Tragg and Perry/Paul/Della, and the melodrama of an inevitable courtroom meltdown.  The epilogue sequences tend to err on the side of light and almost always fall flat, but it's a minor complaint.  The only other shortcomings are episodes where one of the major characters is absent, or there is a poorly executed ethnic theme; it takes the five main characters to really carry the show, and accents/foreign culture were not their strong suit.  Luckily, most episodes do not fall into these categories.

Product details:  DVD has a simple menu with Perry graphics in the b/g and the theme song playing on a loop.  Set has several discs with 3-4 episodes per disc.  Audio and picture quality excellent.",1445040000,2,1930,4.907407407407407

2657670,5,B000IHYXJO,"The Perry Mason TV series was a long-running and poular 1950's-60's eries.  I think it's great entertainment, in part because of the who-donnit and the courtroom drama but also because of the amusing 50's morality and fashions. Check out the women, wearing pointed bras that look like inverted ice cream cones.  The law aspect is also accurate as far as I could tell.  Perry Mason may not be for everyone, however.  My suggestion is to catch a couple of episodes on one of those nostalgia TV stations to see if you like it.",1432252800,,523,4.591397849462366

2657693,5,B000IHYXJO,"I am old enough to remember when this show first ran on TV.  We had a 1951 Admiral Radio/Record Player/TV combo with a 14"" screen.  My dad got the a combo because he was a radio fan and ""would never learn to watch TV"".  Right.  He got hooked on Perry Mason the first season  and the family never missed an episode.  So clever is this series that we used to all try and guess just who the real culprit was.  We rarely got it right.  So, I thought I would try out Season 1, Volume 1.  Turned out to be every bit as good as I thought it would be...even better!  The transfer quality to digital is superb.  In fact, I liked this so much I purchased the entire series.  All you get in this volume are the shows with no extras.  But, the shows are what you want in the first place. Remember, this volume is in glorious Black and White and not widescreen.  Only now, unlike our original 14"" TV, I can watch this show on a large home theater monitor.  Be sure NOT to watch it in the Widescreen setting, however,  Finally, the American automobiles from the 1950s are nothing short of spectacular!  Perry alternates between driving a Cadillac convertible and a Ford Galaxie and maybe Fairlane convertible.  I remember my 1958 Pontiac with great fondness.  These are in the series also.  Many great cars.  So, great acting, great cars, great plots and lots of fun overall.  Highly recommended.",1423008000,5,1382,4.400793650793651

Earl Stanley Gardner the writer for Perry Mason has done a good job, however every episode Tragg manages to be in the right place at the right time. That being said in real life Huh! come on. If these crime were committed in real life with real people, police, lawyers we'd all be just one step behind the criminals. Since when do police run in grab a suspect from the clutches of their attorney or appear at a fresh crime scene as Perry often does and Tragg right on his heels.

2657743,5,B000IHYXJO,"This volume's most enjoyable episode is: ""The Case of the Substitute Face.""

Perry and Della are returning to LA from Vancouver, British Columbia aboard a cruise ship.  They share a promising romantic moment at the ship's railing in the moonlight.  Before returning to the lounge for an after-dinner drink, they meet the Hauser's.

Mrs. Hauser, her husband and daughter, were enjoying a delightful, relaxing voyage until she discovers her husband's money belt crammed with large bills - he explains that he had won it, but she suspects he embezzled it.  She seeks help from Mr. Mason.

Before the evening is over, the ship is suddenly buffeted by a squall.  The ship's captain is informed that a man has fallen overboard.  The witness's story, that it was not an accident, seems to check out when his purser finds Mrs. Hauser's wet dress and a money belt . . . .

Note:  It is easy to miss what really happened - pay close attention to the ending.

Perry's caseload in this season's volume: 20.  Total Run Time is about 1040 minutes.

Picture: good.  Sound volume moderately low, clear.  Subtitles: none.",1405814400,2,1104,4.797872340425532

With so much junk on current TV, it's a pleasure to be able to acquire classic TV series' like this Perry Mason (and Matlock, Murder She Wrote, Columbo, Rockford Files and others). There are only one or two shows on TV these days worth watching (NCIS and Bones). Most of the shows on TV are vulgar, violent, unfunny and promote offensive social or sexual agendas. The comedies (both live and animated) are included in that description and even game shows (Jeopardy clues are starting to be Left-leaning or presented by left-leaning celebrities and celebrity politicians including the current residents of the White House which is disrespectful of the office in my opinion). The reality shows are unreal and stupid with most having mercenary goals. And don't even get me started on the low morals and quality of Saturday morning cartoons.

2657805,5,B000IHYXJO,"This release is of the second half of #1 of ""Perry Mason,"" the venerated 1957-66 CBS legal series, starring Raymond Burr as the title character, a criminal defense attorney in L.A. The other main players are still there: Barbara Hale as Della Street, Mason's ""girl Friday""; William Hopper as Mason's investigator, Paul Drake (this was back when ""shoe leather""--actually getting out on the streets and sleuthing-- was still employed); William Talman as Mason's adversary, D.A. Hamilton Burger (who, it was said in the #1-1 review, had an interesting pun made of his name, in that Mason more often than not made ""Ham Burger"" of him); and Ray Collins as Lt. Arthur Tragg, homicide detective of the L.A.P.D.

Each outing (the last 20 of #1 of which are included in this #1-2 release) is as before about the commission of a murder and the establishment of the suspects. Mason and his team then, as before, go to work sleuthing and uncovering clues to use in the courtroom segment, in which both sides (Burger for the prosecution, Mason for the defense) each build what they consider to be a strong case; Mason usually won the day, however, when Paul Drake came in with a crucial piece of evidence that would turn the tables on Burger and expose the real killer, who would either be fingered by Mason or a related suspect, or confess to the crime him/herself. In the tag scene, Mason, Della and Drake would usually discuss how they came to the solution of who the real killer was.

The closing credits of each outing varied in their setup; some episodes' credits would be against a gray screen with pictures of the sponsor in an octagon-shaped area at the lower-left, while many more would be against a background of several volumes of ""Corpus Juris Secundum.""

The 20 outings of this #1-2 release are, as before, uncut and restored to their ORT's (original running times as presented in the 50s, when ""Mason"" was originally on CBS), and they are remastered from how they looked when they were originally on. The #1-1 release had only 19 outings, with 16 of them on the first 4 discs, and the last 3 on the last; the 20 outings of this release are apportioned equally among 5 discs in 3 cases (as before, two discs in each of the first two cases, one in the last). The cases as before have episode descriptions on the back of each. The package of #1-2 is in a sepia color scheme (#1-1 was bluish). The front has color images of the characters, which would make you think that ""Mason"" was in color throughout its run (it did have one color outing near the end, but for the most part, it was B/W). The back describes what this release is about, and why ""Mason"" was popular with audiences then.

All this considered, like #1-1, this is a must-have release if you enjoy seeing how a clever defense attorney outwits his prosecutorial adversary (which is generally why ""Mason"" was very popular then).",1354752000,,2888,4.645792563600783

Yes, you may very well want to remember at which episode you left off, but simply try to remember ""just"" the title instead.
Why? Well, unfortunately, the two sentence description gives away a great deal of what's going to happen, which can spoil some of the fun and mystery.",1285632000,3,580,4.37962962962963
2657816,4,B000IHYXJO,"Erle Stanley Gardner (1889-1970) began his career as a lawyer--but it was quickly overshadowed by Perry Mason, the fiction attorney Gardner created in 1933. The character would be the subject of numerous novels, motion pictures, radio programs, made-for-television movies, and most famously a television series that ran from 1957 to 1966.

In a certain sense, PERRY MASON episodes are pure formula. The first portion of the program sets up a questionable situation that drives a character to seek aid from Mason. The murder generally occurs after Mason has accepted the client, who now finds the situation going from bad to worse and who is accused of the murder. There follows a hearing or trial at which Mason proves the client innocent and exposes the real killer--very often on the witness stand. While the structure is repetitive, and although it is a bit much that Mason never seems to lose a case and the killer almost always cracks under cross examination, the repetitive nature of the episodes and the inevitable climax is part of what makes the show fun and entertaining. You know that Perry will win, you just don't know how and who.

The series is also notable for exceptional production values. Television programs of the 1950s and 1960s were often cheaply made, but PERRY MASON was not: it was filmed on high-grade celluloid, done on location and meticulously rendered sets, and the classic black and white look makes the series seem very noir-ish. The script had a driving quality and often mixed dry wit with drama, the music was spectacularly memorable, and the regular cast was nothing short of flawless. Raymond Burr (1917-1993), Barbara Hale (b. 1922), William Hopper (1915-1970), William Talman (1915-1968) and Ray Collins (1889-1965) were not stars, but they had solid bodies of work before they came to the series--and they played exceptionally well, with the chemistry between Burr, Hale, and Hopper particularly enjoyable. Episodes also often featured actors who would go on to become famous in their own right, and this set has the usual quota, including Angie Dickinson (later of Police Woman fame), Nancy Kulp (best known as Jane Hathaway on The Beverly Hillbillies), and Marie Windsor (noted noir actress.)

PERRY MASON SEASON ONE VOLUME TWO finishes out the series' first broadcast year, and each episode is enjoyable.  Although most people like to think that Mason never lost a case, actress Barbara Hale noted that Mason actually lost at least six during the run of the series--and this set may include one the six to which she referred, a particularly twisty story that finds Mason duped by his own client.  But they are all fun.  Recommended.

2657821,5,B000IHYXJO,"This set contains the remaining twenty, of the thirty-nine episodes in Perry Mason's first season caseload.  By the season's midpoint, Perry Mason was already a major success.  The cast of regulars, including Raymond Burr, Barbara Hale, William Hopper, William Talman, and Ray Collins, had settled snugly into their roles, and were performing superbly.  The writers had Erle Stanley Gardner's novels as source material, and in their hands, his stories came to life marvelously on television.  Great casting, down to the minor roles, contributed to the program's excellence.  Producing thirty nine episodes, required an incredible effort by all concerned.

Mason's cases are complex, usually demanding the viewer's attention, to keep on top of what is happening.  There are few extraneous moments.  The stories often reflect the variety of settings in southern California, with Mason's clientele coming from all levels of society.  Even if you have seen them before, the engaging stories and fine performances, make the episodes very rewatchable.

The program looks and sounds fantastic, for being over fifty years old.  After viewing blurry, truncated versions through the years, it is wonderful to see these pristine full-length episodes.  Unfortunately, they are not subtitled.  Perry Mason's proactive approach, and courtroom theatrics, may not be very realistic, but it certainly makes for extremely compelling and entertaining, classic television.",1253232000,2,1452,5.6976744186046515

2657838,5,B000IHYXJO,"Having just completed PM season 1, volume 2, I must say that I was thoroughly happy with this purchase.  (I powered through season 1, volume 1 in early April--and loved it.)  The storylines are all good here--a few are excellent.  The acting is top-notch by Burr, Hopper and Hale.  And I think Ray Collins (as Lt. Tragg) and William Tallman (as Hamilton Burger) also turned in good performances.  What I like most about this first season of Perry Mason is the feeling it brings to the viewer--it is almost like being transported back in time to 1957.  I was too young to watch these episodes on broadcast TV--and experiencing them now immersed me in a seemingly simpler time--when judgments about people and their actions were more or less cast in black or white, not in shades of gray.  The dialogue moves along at a crisp pace.  The guest stars are interesting, some are excellent supporting actors.  Raymond Burr's character nuances are amazing (he is very good at using his facial expressions and authoritarian voice to convey attitude), and the quality of the video and sound is very good.  Thankfully, you get the entire episodes--with the scenes that were edited or cut to make room for TV commercials--restored.  I only wish that Paramount / CBS would put together a well-produced documentary on the Making Of Perry Mason.  Even without this missing bonus feature, my plan is to purchase the next DVD set on June 17th.  Wouldn't it be cool if, somehow, the producers and CBS-TV had filmed a special 2-hour episode back in the day--and having kept it a secret all these years--could NOW release it as a 100% new product on DVD?  Certainly, it could bring in plenty of money--but back then not many could justify the expense of such a plan when few could have predicted the massive DVD home theatre market of 2007.",1179014400,15,1820,4.7365079365079366

The series in the early years is noteworthy for the great characters and character dialogue coupled to terrific sets with the use of camera angles and lighting to create shadows, ominous situations in marvelous black and white photography.

2657849,4,B000IHYXJO,"On a whim, I recently ordered the Perry Mason DVD set.  I'm now an addict!

I DO live in the 21st century....note I am not a 50's throwback, unable to watch,

respect and enjoy contemporary (and far more scabrious) entertainments.  I'm a

big Sopranos fan, for example, and a Scorsese fan as well.  That said: the old

Perry Masons are often somewhat astonishing, all the same.  The acting, a roster

of the cream of 1950s personalities (including an episode with the unforgettable

Constance Ford!), provides treasures-from-the-deep in nearly every episode.

The pacing, unlike most 1950s and 60s products (including, sadly, The Twilight

Zone, Thriller, and, too often, Alfred Hitchcock Presents) is quick, punchy,

smart, and to the point.  These shows NEVER drag.....the puzzles are often

quirky, but are fair, and provide truly good mental workouts for the whodunit addict.

HIGHLY recommended ... and for those of us who are fascinated with the evolutionary

history of popular American culture, these black and white gems are not to be

missed.

By the way, although the chapter editing of these Perry Masons does leave a

little to be desired, because the original shows were shot on film, the

quality of the transfer is excellent.

I would love to see Season 2 on DVD as well!",1171238400,5,1287,4.971698113207547

These are excellent transfers, and the occasional ones I've found to be a little grainy were, compared to tapes from TV showings, amazing.  It also looks to me that everything originally shown is included, they're not chopped up from syndication, there are no ""EH?"" moments so far.  So if you love Perry Mason, they're worth the money.

2657855,5,B000IHYXJO,"The second volume of Perry Mason, Season One continues the fun legal thrills that are found in the first volume. Murders, twists, deception and the constant maneuvering between Mason and his two rivals, police Lt. Tragg and D.A. Hamilton Burger, make for more compelling television. As always, Mason's stalwart secretary, Della Street, stands by ever ready to take notes, or to help Perry skirt the law, all in the name of defending a client. Private eye Paul Drake is also a solid staple in Perry's ongoing fight to find the truth.

The series contains a kind of high-brow intellectual quality about it, mostly thanks to the touches of original author, Erle Stanley Gardner, who was himself a lawyer. There is little action in this series; I can only remember watching one character being shot on-screen in this volume. But Mason's calm yet tenacious will and daunting presence makes up for any hard-boiled, tough-talking sleuth with a pension for fist-fights.

Notable episodes from this volume include, ""The Case of the One-eyed Witness,"" ""the Case of the Half-wakened Wife,"" ""The Case of the Lazy Lover,"" and ""The Case of the Terrified Typist,"" in which Perry actually loses a case.

As it is with any long-running TV series, not every episode is a winner. ""The Case of the Deadly Double,"" is rather dated in it's treatment of schizophrenia. By today's standards, The dialogue sometimes comes off as waspish and too formal in the series, but that's simply the way drama was done in those days.

The packaging is again impressive and, though I continue to lament the lack of any extras, the sharp restoration and uncut episodes make the buy worthwhile.

If you love crime fiction with a noir touch, and if you aren't too snobbish for black-and-white television or intricate plots, Perry Mason is a must for you.",1169078400,3,1814,4.915032679738562

There is not a lot to say about a TV series that has become a real classic, except that this program is one of the best in TV history and still passes the test of time.

8145582,5,B000IHYXJO,"This is a series of programs based a character in the writings of Erle Stanley Gardner. The CBS TV series stretched form 1957 through 1966.

Perry Mason (Raymond Burr) is a defense lawyer who is always thought of after it is too late for him to save the defendant from being accused of murder. Supporting Perry is his trusty more than friendly but professional secretary Della Street (Barbara Hale). And their trusty and sneaky privat investigator Paul Drake (William DeWolf Hopper, Son of the actress-turned-gossip-columnist Hedda Hopper). On the other side of the courtroom is the district attorney Hamilton Burger (William Talman) assisted by the not so neutral Homicide Lt. Arthur Tragg (Ray Collins).

You wonder how they get away with manufacturing evidence and the defendant usually has foot in mouth. Then there are the signature courtroom demonstrations.

Be sure to re-watch these programs as you can then see at even in TV programs they can sprinkle in subtle clues.

The was a mad magazine mock that had a boy scout immediately confess from the back of the courtroom upon seeing Perry mason.

Many of the subsequent programs allowed many TV actors of the time to become different characters and even replace the Burger and Tragg characters. You find yourself not only trying to outguess Mason but also saying ""Hey I saw that actor in...""

Even though the characters are from Erle Stanley Gardner the actual programs are written by many different TV writers of the day.

I have on occasion read some of the Erle Stanly Gardner Mason's and they are closely related. The TV version has a few less characters and has to write in some of our favorites.

The DVD's themselves usually have four episodes with a glaring lack of the extras that are so popular nowadays. The plus is that there are no advertisements.",1506988800,21,1818,4.87987012987013
