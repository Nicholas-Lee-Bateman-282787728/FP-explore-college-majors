7872004,4,6304474008,"As a dog person I have watched many many documentaries on dogs, but had never seen a film about cats.  This program is filled with information about the primal origins of domesticated cats, periodically demonstrating the relationship between house cats and the big cats of the wild.  The movie also goes into detail about why cats behave in their quirky ways and how they are able to do the crazy things they do physically.  The material and language in this film are good for adults who have interest and curiosity.  One of the reasons I like it so much is that it is definitely not a program designed for children.  I would recommend this film for children no younger than maybe ten or twelve because there are some graphic scenes and discussions, plus it doesn't have the flashiness and fast pace of a kids program.  The only reason I gave the film four stars is because it is so old and the technology (and possibly some information) is very dated, especially in this case being on VHS.  Plus, I'm a dog person! :p",1331942400,2,1018,4.530054644808743
