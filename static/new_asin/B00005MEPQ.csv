1624908,5,B00005MEPQ,Fascinating by the honesty that nothing appeared 'set-up' or changed for the camera.  A real insight and appreciation that on-board is one of the few times the President can relax.,1193011200,,180,5.0
1624909,2,B00005MEPQ,"I tought that this movie was going to tell you the real secrets of Air Force One, but it only talks about the story of the airplane since Nixon, and then it just tells you that it is cassified everything about it, so not so many details. I didn't like it.",1140998400,3,255,4.019607843137255
1624910,5,B00005MEPQ,"This is a great movie about the U.S president's official plane Air Force One or rightly called White House on wings. Covers the history of Air Force One as to how the need for an air travel was considered a must after the second world war as the head of states of the world usually avoided Air travel before world war 2. Shows the planes in complete details alongwith the interviews of some of the former Presidents of U.S and some of the Crew members of this amazing plane. Also covers some of the sad moments of history of mankind like the transport of Dead Body of the former president of U.S John Cannedy who was shot dead in 1963 and was carried back by Air force one and the next president took oath in the plane itself. Quite a sentimental and at the same time dutiful moment captured on film.

  The movie tells about the routine of the flights and the jobs of the crew members in details and what weapons and accessories are carried alongwith the plane. All in all it's a must see for everyone who lives in this world and is in touch with the current events of the globe. Must make you feel envy about the fate of U.S presidents for possesing such an out of the world Air Plane.",1111708800,8,1187,4.266666666666667
1624911,5,B00005MEPQ,This video is up to date and shows you Air Force One like never before. I am a TV news photographer and have covered Air Force One many times. This was a great way to see what goes on inside and behind the scenes. Great job National Geographic!!,1035590400,3,245,4.125
1624912,5,B00005MEPQ,"This is a fantastic video on Air Force One. They have done a great job getting access. A little too much was shown I think
that could hurt the security of the President",1012435200,4,168,4.121212121212121
1624913,4,B00005MEPQ,"During President Clintons state visit to NZ last year nothing seemed to define the imperial US presidency more than his arrival in his personal jet-a modified boeing 747 no less.
It was not so much the plane itself, grand as it was but also the preceding paraphenalia of accompanying aircraft bearing personal security and bulletproof limousines. The entire apparatus of presidential security was on the move. For every visible SS agent their were 4 in the background. Waiting and watching....for anything.
Even The Queen is now relegated by her own government to the first class cabins of british airways, alas. Not to mention the mothballing of her private yacht. It says a lot for a nations head of state in what conveyance they choose to travel the globe.
I was impressed with the dedication and professionalism of the crew designated to work in AF1-although  a certain servility is required their downright obsequiousness seemed to be a job requirement. From the captain even to the lowliest steward, to be seen and not heard. Do not speak unless spoken to. To some a reminder of the Nixon years.
The obligatory escorted tour through a plane only a few are priveleged to see up close-the plush carpets the spacious interiors and conference rooms and secretarial offices echoed a businesslike atmosphere, and everywhere the presidential seal as if anyone would forget who the main passenger was. If it lacked the luxurious interiors and gold fittings of the Sultan of Brunei's own 747 no-one noticed. Besides such extravagance would seem garish and gaudy. The might of the US industrial military complex was enough to offset any hint of that.
The brief history of previous presidential aircraft did seem to concentrate of the Kennedy years more so than those preceding and following, otherwise it was informative-showing us old newsreels of Eisenhower and Truman and even FDR's one overseas trip during the war-to Casablanca. The triumphant times-Nixons 1974 trip to China and the sad times. The familiar picture of LBJ taking the oath in the cabin of AF1-Jacqui and Lady bird beside him that sad day in Dallas so many years ago.
Finally we must spare a thought for Bill Clinton, now a private citizen who out of all the perks of office must have enjoyed this one the most, as any political leader would have. During his eventful 8 years in office the president seemed to be constantly filmed arriving somewhere in presidential state-stepping of alone as protocol dictated- with the familiar blue fusilage behind him like some imperial backdrop. I now sympathise with his current circumstances-Poor Bill travelling 1st class on a commercial airliner just isn't the same.",1009497600,12,2674,5.036117381489842
1624914,4,B00005MEPQ,'National Geographic - Air Force One' is a wonderful documentary that lets you see all the inside information of Air Force One.

7945348,5,B00005MEPQ,I have watched this program on Netflix and I had to own it. I watch it one a month or more.,1461283200,,91,3.380952380952381
7945349,5,B00005MEPQ,Bought this one with the DVD on Marine One. They are both exceptional. It's a good feeling that we take such good care of our leaders. I would so recommend this DVD along with the one on Marine One.,1451779200,,198,4.102564102564102
7945350,5,B00005MEPQ,Great DVD...everything you'd ever want to know about this aircraft and its legacy.,1419811200,,82,5.384615384615385
7945351,5,B00005MEPQ,"This is very well done.  I have used it for years in my government classes, and my students and I have decided that we'd rather get a ride on Air Force One than to visit the White House.  It gives a brief history of the planes that have been used and some previous Presidents talk about their experiences on it.  It does, however, end with Clinton's presidency, if that matters.",1417824000,,378,4.371428571428571
7945352,5,B00005MEPQ,"I watched this video in my home as part of my growing movie collection. It was great! very informative, and gives great insight into the amazing world of the president. It is slightly outdated (something you's expect from a VHS tape), but interesting nonetheless. Not sure why the rating is 'R', I'd happily show this to a child. A must-buy for anybody interested in planes, government, or simply just loves learning!",1408924800,,417,4.887323943661972
7945353,4,B00005MEPQ,"I have watched this DVD twice and it's a very informative look at Air Force One.  From the first President in flight (FDR) to the beginning of G.W. Bush's presidency, it tells of the changes made through the various administrations, the updates in technology and modern conveniences, and interesting tidbits about how the airplane has been impacted by specific events in history. Recommended.",1366156800,,392,5.222222222222222
7945354,4,B00005MEPQ,"I thought this was a good documentary, and the only thing I could suggest that would have improved it was if the background music stayed in the BACKGROUND!  Too many times, the music was competing with the narration or interviews.  Otherwise, it provided a very interesting peek into the behind-the-scenes operation of the president's aircraft.",1232841600,,344,5.236363636363636
7945355,5,B00005MEPQ,The Air Force has helped put out a great educational film on Air Force One.  You will see what others will not see as of course no tours are available.  You start from when the Air Force started transporting Presidents up to the point of George W. Bush.  It is both exciting and exhilarating.  Don't let the title fool you.  It of course takes you from preparations to take off up unto the time the President has made his final stop.  It takes you off the airplane and shows you what goes into protecting the President to the home of the President in the air.,1216857600,2,559,4.276190476190476
