It brings me back to my childhood where I would stay inside on Saturday afternoons and watch Godzilla, Gamera, Kung Fu movies and just about anything that was dubbed. Gyaos is a great adversary. I like  how they re-did Gamera's origin. Godzilla is my favorite monster, but this  has better special effects than any Godzilla film. Gamera is catching up. I  can't wait until they release Gamera 2: The Advent of Legion. Gamera has  come a long way!!",928368000,,467,4.728395061728395
913174,5,6304672128,"Most gamera fans have seen the cheesy 60s and 70s versions of the turtle that tried to be godzilla. But now, Gamera actually defeats Godzilla in FX. The Godzilla series from 1989-1995 (The Hesei series) had excellent to mediocre FX. Now Gamera beats the FX in this one! But not only do FX makes this a good movie, but the plot actually clicks without plot holes, and, IMHO, is well explained.
Synopsis: A floating atoll is discovered and a research team chases after it, while three giant bird-monsters appear and chow down on people. The atoll cracks open and releases a monster turtle called Gamera, a dragon created by an ancient civilization to destroy the evil Gyaos. All but one of the birds are killed, and the survivor grows to a size equal to Gamera's. The bird has been dubbed Gyaos and the military decides to stop attacking Gamera and turn towards Gyaos. Gyaos and Gamera meet in Tokyo and fight to the death.... I can't tell you who wins.  END",900806400,,956,4.590643274853801

913220,5,6304672128,"Thank goodness for ADV films putting out some great Kaiju action on DVD.  The DVD quality is pretty good and there are special features on each of the three Gamera movie discs.  This trilogy comes in a card case for the collector.  It's a nice if unnecessary touch.  All three of the Gamera flicks contained are above par kaiju movies and have won favorable reviews from western cineastes not accustomed to watching giant monster movies be good, let alone enthralling at times.

Def recommended if you have an old DVD player.  If you have Blu ray all of these movies are now available on that format, and on the cheap.  The Blu ray DVD quality is based off of the same transfers, I believe, as what you get here and there's not that great a difference in the visual quality between the two from what I can remember, so you are not going to be getting much less in the way of quality if you picked up these DVDs.",1410048000,,911,4.355029585798817

913234,4,6304672128,"One of the best 90's Gamera film. Gamera is link thru a little girl. Gayos returns with a atitude. Great fight scenes, and not so boring. Like Gamera 2&3. You could now buy this in a double pack with Destroy all Monsters. Gamera the brave is being release 10/17/08 another great film. Japanese giants rules!",1225065600,,307,4.6

Gamera always gets a little sloppy, and oops!  There goes another building!  I'm running out of exclamation points!!!

I was a fan of these films when I was a kid, and it took me by suprise that there was a remake in the 90's.  I picked up the boxed set and was pleasantly surprised to find that they kept the man-in-the-suit look, the hilarious dubbing, and all of the main staples of good old Japanese monster movie mayhem.  No CGI here, plenty of miniatures and slow-mo sloshing water.  There's something about those special effects that has a campy nostalgic feel, and it works.  I was cheering like a kid watching this film - here he comes!  Gamera!  I gave it four stars because, well, come on, it is a monster movie, but it does exactly what it set out to do.",1185235200,,928,4.485029940119761
913236,4,6304672128,"Mega-turtle Gamera sleeps in the deep and is summoned forth by a girl who retains a sympathetic connection through a comma-shaped rock pendant, to do battle with an old enemy in Gyaos, the monster pterodactyl who feasts on human beings. Gamera's whereabouts are divulged when a team of oceanographers discover an island which conceals a mystical megalith encribed with actual Futhark runes, describing the prophesy of the monsters returning when the world is in perceived environmental peril.*

The little humans are predictably afraid of the monsters, and seek to destroy both of them, despite Gamera's heroic inclinations, but after awhile, they realize Gamera is the only great beast who can battle Gyaos, who has set up nest atop Tokyo Tower in the middle of the city. Instead of luring the giant away, the seemingly idiotic military deem to destroy the pterodactyl right there amidst the metropolitan surroundings. Their battle destroys the city at the cost of only a few human lives {in which Gyaos treats herself to ""canned human"" as she peels away subway trains, shaking the residents into her mouth}.

With the help of the life-force of the girl, Gamera gathers up enough energy to defeat Gyaos, which takes them from the city to the ocean, and even into outer space. Though Gamera receives some potent blows, thus also effecting the girl, he prevails in the end, with a nod of recognition.

913238,5,6304672128,"This first in the trilogy pits Gamera against his long time and fan favorite foe Gyaos. The Gamera series takes a more mature tone and drops the childish themes the series was originally known for. This movie along with the following two focuses on adults and has nothing to do with children. Good film with excellent storyline and acting. This probably has the weakest special effects out of the trilogy, but that doesn't mean that the fx are terrible, quite the opposite, the special fx are amazing, nothing extremely special about it. A kaiju must, those who are not even Gamera fans and only Godzilla fans will really enjoy this movie and become fans of the giant turtle. It did it to me! Like the Godzilla movies, the story is completely different from the original series of the 60's, 70's and 1980. Incredible movie, but the best was yet to come! Kaneko is the best kaiju director of our time and this was his first time directing a movie like this, he would later go on to direct the other two and also direct Godzilla, Mothra, King Ghidorah Giant Monsters All Out Attack which is considered one of the best Godzilla movies of all time! Fantastic movie, believe me, go get a copy and see it! You won't be disappointed!",1133913600,3,1226,4.577272727272727
913239,4,6304672128,"Godzilla, a great movie was released in 1954, it was about a giant monster that attacked japan, it was a success, in japan and america, many succesful sequals were inevitable. so naturally everyone wanted to dublicate the success,even countries like korea gave it a try with yonggary(a overall terrible film).most were just one shots that were forever outshined by godzilla films but one series was fairly succesful, still nothing compared to the godzilla movies of the time, it was gamera a giant dectructive turtle that was a ""friend to all children"". It lasted from 65 to about 72 and was still very crappy and only lasted because of its appeal to children. then in 1995 gamera guardian of the universe was released and completely revamped the series ignoring even the original(something only one or two godzilla movies have tried, all other current ones regard the original and use it as a cruch for its own success) it also didn't rely on children either it was very refreshing to many, but it still has its problems. people praise it for having computer generated missles instead of just fire cracker looking things like godzilla movies of the time used, but the missles still look extremely fake, they have like no detail. this film also used a CG fire ball for gamera unlike godzilla movies of the nineties that still used 2-d animated looking lasers, but the monster gaos still has this bad 2-d effect for its non CG laser. the monster action is also a little dull. but it is still good taking in the fact that it was the first monster movie to use these better methods. so I gave it a four out of five. I will review its sequels as soon as possible.",1124668800,3,1659,4.64625850340136
913240,5,6304672128,"I've always liked Gamera.  His early films were a little silly, but they had a certain charm.  It's inevitable that Gamera gets compared to Godzilla, and I think that's a real shame.  Both are great monsters with very different styles.  Godzilla is the Terminator of the kaiju scene.  He's an unstoppable force with very little finesse.  But Gamera is the kung fu master of giant monsters.  Like watching a Jackie Chan film, you never know what quite to expect.

This first film of the new series is damn impressive.  The story is clever.  And Gamera's new origin makes him a good guy, so we're rooting for him in a way we rarely get to with Godzilla.  But what makes or breaks a kaiju film for me is the fights.

This has some great ones, full of twists and turns.  More than once did I wait in sheer suspense as I wondered how Gamera would defeat his foe, and I was blown away with his eventual triumph.  (Hope that doesn't ruin the movie, but I assumed everyone already knows he's gonna win in the end.)

The next two films in this series are every bit as worthwhile.  So I say it's a big universe.  Big enough for Godzilla and Gamera to coexist peacefully.  Of course they are giant monsters, and monsters tend to fight.

Gamera vs Godzilla?  Never gonna happen.  But wouldn't it be cool?",1118966400,6,1292,4.435897435897436

I loved it, the final battle scene was amazing and Gamera was very impressive. All in all this is a film for all true giant kaiju lovers, it's great, but in my opinion Gamera is no Godzilla.

913243,4,6304672128,"As most people know Gamera or Gammera as he was first known was the ""friend of children"" back in the sixties and the main competitor to Godzilla. Now Gamera is back and better than ever. No longer is he fodder for the boys at MST3K.

 Today Gamera is the Guardian of the Universe. In the movie Gamera must protect Japan and ultimately the world from the invasion of 3 flying, flesh-eating lizards. Gamera the massive turtle quickly eliminates two of these, but then fights the third in a massive oil refinery show down.

 The primary difference between this movie and the modern Godzilla movies is that the special effects are actually something to look at. For example Gamera flies numerous times and it somehow looks believable unlike the Gamera of yesteryear where you could sometimes see the strings. Every effect is done well including Gamera's flight and fireball, and Gaos' lazer breath. However sometimes it is obvious that effects are CGI.

 The movie is a rather basic monster film but its production and special effects are what seperates it from the herd.",1091145600,3,1067,4.835164835164835

913297,5,6304672128,"When director Shusuke Kaneko and screenwriter Kazumori Ito revived the kiddie kaiju hero Gamera, they also revived the kaiju genre itself.  The pair reached back beyond the day glow colored kiddie slug fests of the late 60s and 70s, stretching all the way back to the genres golden era, the 50s and early 60s.  Rather than treat the flying turtle as a joke, they drafted an intelligent and mature monster story that builds to the city crumbling battles every fan of the genre knows and loves.  This is the movie to show friends and family who think watching man in suit monster movies is strictly for kids.  Highest recommendation.",1078790400,2,631,4.761467889908257

It seems he has returned after thousands of years to face a threat of biblical proportions. Gyaos, the gigantic bat-lizard has laid eggs on a remote island. They've hatched, releasing three gyaos monsters that start eating villagers and their pets almost immediately!

913302,4,6304672128,"I say ""nearly perfect"" because I've seen all three of the new Gamera movies. I know what's coming. The special effects, editing, and photography are superior to the Godzilla movies of the period. This movie came out the same year as Godzilla vs. Destroyer (or ...vs. Destroyah depending on which fan you talk to). In Japan, both movies came out in 1995. Until I saw the movies that followed, this first new Gamera movie blew me away. It is nothing like Gamera vs. Zigra (1972) which was the last of the original Gamera movies before Daiei went bankrupt.
With this movie, Daiei totally resets the storyline and ignores all previous movies. Gamera is given a history here. He doesn't simply appear to protect children. There is a legend for him and Gyaos.
The extras include subtitled Japanese material including original Japanese trailers, TV ads, press conference, promotional events, and behind the scenes stuff. There is also the first part of an interview with the man in charge of the special effects, Shinji Higuchi. The interview includes clips from the later movies which show why I like the later films so much. The beginning of the interview seems a little weird, but it's not bad once it starts. The way the interview is presented is a bit unusual with video monitors sometimes being the focus of many shots.
The DVD includes both English and Japanese audio and English subtitles. However, ADV has reduced the number of quotes from reviews on the DVD package from what was on the tape box. The DVD has no quotes from Roger Ebert (yes, he gave it a ""Thumbs Up""), New York Times, or New York Daily News. Since ADV didn't include their own trailers for this movie, the one with the quotes from TV Guide, Roger Ebert, and Cult Movies isn't here. Among the ADV previews, there is one for Gamera 2.

Much better than it had to be. TOHO, the home of Godzilla, took over the studio that did the Gamera films, and I think that may be why this film is so good.

The DVD contains both the original Japanese dialog as well as the English dubbed.  Do yourself a favor and watch the Japanese with English subtitles, as the dubbing--good as it is--glosses over some of the effective subtleties of the original script.

913334,4,6304672128,"This 1995 film is as I see it a totally new approach, to the Japanese giant rubber monster genre. This film has a tight script, a heavy soundtrack and is cut in a faster pace than the Godzilla films of the 90s (And Godzilla 2000 for that matter). I've watched this film over and over, and I still enjoy it as much as the first time I saw it!
The origin of Gamera has been rewritten in this first film in the new series (G2 1997, G3 1999); Gamera is not an ancient race of giant turtles, that has accidently been awaken by nuclear testing - He's/She is some leftover biotech weapon from the anchient civilazation of Atlantis! He's left as an guardian against the people of Atlantis biggest biotech blunder; The Gyaos!
The story; A population of Gyaos have hatched on a island. The islanders and a professor and his team gets eaten. A huge floating atoll is found in the pacific - Is there a connection?
The Gyaos move in towards the Japan mainland, and attempt is made to capture the creatures. The Atoll inreases speed towards this location, Gamera arises in the harbour - The battle can begin!
A very enjoyable movie! Contains not so much digital effects as the later Gamera films - The gyaos for instance look very rubbery. But Gamera new ""flame trower"" is impressive. It's also fun to see him do the real Kaju thing; Wreck the tokyo tower...
The most remembered line in this film; ""I would like to take you out, in a monster free Tokyo...""
This dubbed version has a more pumped up sound track then the subtitled version.
Looking for Gamera 2 and 3?
In Japan a Dvd box has been released, containing G1/G2/G3 that carry English subtitles. Japanese Dvd:s does however have a region 2 coding. Try to find Cd Japan, Japanese site, in English - That's all info I can give here",1001376000,4,1773,4.458461538461538
913335,5,6304672128,"Gamera began his cinematic life in the 1960s, in a series of kid-oriented Japanese monster movies. A giant, jet-powered, flying, saber-toothed, fire-breathing turtle, Gamera may sound like a ridiculous concept to some, but to others (like me!) he's a beloved film icon.
Well, Gamera is back in a big way in ""Gamera: Guardian of the Universe,"" a 1990s update of the classic character. Remakes and updates are always tricky undertakings, but screenwriter Kazunori Ito and director Shusuke Kaneko have done an excellent job. The secret of their success is simple: they remain true to the original concept and characterization of Gamera, while bringing a high-tech 90s sensibility to the execution.
In this film, ancient monster Gamera is reawakened to the contemporary world. He forms a telepathic bond with a young woman, and engages in fantastic battles with a species of predatory flying reptile known as Gyaos.
This new ""Gamera"" is an exciting, superbly made film. A coherent script, good performances by an engaging human cast, effective special effects, and a thrilling musical score all contribute to the film's overall success. The filmmakers have expertly blended the excitement of an action film with the timeless feel of myth. And most importantly, this new Gamera retains the quirky charm that made his earlier incarnations so memorable.

913337,5,6304672128,"Gamera:GOTU is wonderful, modern approach to the monster movie.  By starting with the first discovery of the monster, it allows the world to be much closer to ours.  There is no 50 year history to reinvent or rewrite.  There are no Maser Beam Tanks to be destroyed.  The movie is about what happens to people when monsters are discovered today.
This movie has a great attention to detail:  all of the hardware used by Japan is accurate and modern, monsters showing up effecting commodities and stocks, background characters, the construction of the miniture buildings, etc.
The special effects are second to the story, and not the reverse.  This is a great improvement over many modern Hollywood movies.
For those curious if Gamera or Godzilla is the better series, the answer is simple.  Take a Saturday and rent this movie and Godzilla Vs. Destroyer or Godzilla Vs. MechaGodzilla.  With this fine double feature, comparing the least of the modern Gameras movies vs the best of the modern Godzillas, a personal preference will develop.

This also had some spoofing of Jurassic Park, AKA Gyaos (Rodan  wanabe) doodoo being inspected by some woman.  And now the special effects  (which wern't anything that special), it seemed like the only thing payed  attention to in this movie was the Gamera Fire Ball.  The flying turtle  sceans looked like they were just guys in rubber suits in front of a set  paineted on paper.  And the missles use to shoot the monsters looked like  they came strait out of a Disney/Pixar movie (you know, Toy Story, A Bug's  Life).  And maybe the monster fighting sceans would have been more  realistic if the monsters weren't dileberetly missing each other.  I may be  a Godzilla fan (I'm not saying I'm not a Gamera fan, and I'm not saying I  am a Gamera fan), but I'm not leting the fact that I own every Godzilla  movie (exept Godzilla 2000, which I saw in theaters yesterday and it was  GREAT) interfier with this review.  I'm not comparing it to Godzilla (but  if you do want my opinion, check out Godzilla vs. Destroyah, way better FX  than this).

913339,3,6304672128,"The original Gamera films were ok. The human plots were horrendous and  uninteresting except maybe Gamera vs. Barugon.  The monster scenes were  pretty good, not the best.  Overall they were good or really bad, but not  as good as Godzilla (he IS the King of the Monsters). Anyways, Gamera has  been revived in a trilogy of movies that have been widely praised.  This  movie makes me wonder why the movies are so highly liked though.  Gamera  and Gyaos aren't that cool.  The fights are adequate. The effects vary from  good to bad.  And the human drama equals that of any 60's-70's Godzilla  movie.  It could have been really good, but the monsters aren't that  interesting, and that's what counts.  My guess is Gamera 3 is the only one  that's really good (although I have serious doubts about it) and for some  reason they started giving accolades to the whole trilogy.  Gamera 2 and 3  are planned to be released by ADV Films in 2001, by the way.  So, until  then, I'm taking the raves of the new Gamera trilogy with a grain of salt.

However, I am also a fair critic, and I cannot deny that Gamera: Guardian  is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Most of the concepts that were  originated in the Heisei Godzilla movies, but never fully developed, are  beautifully done here, and the visual effects are some of the best ever in  a kaiju movie. Shusuke Kaneko crafts a story that never loses it's momentum  and is at no point ever unengaging. The score is also excellent, worthy of  some of Akira Ifukube's better work. If you think this movie is good,  however, watch Gamera 2: Advent of Legion and Gamera 3: Awakening of Irys.  They must be seen to be believed.",963273600,,784,4.395833333333333

Daiei's bankruptcies and subsequent takeover by Toho couldn't do it.  Gamera is  invincible and cannot be killed off.  He lives on in the hearts of his  fans.  And seeing this movie and his new origin, his first movie with a  decent budget and the benefit of CGI leave a viewer with only one word on  their lips: WOW!  An ancient race (supposedly Atlantis) accidently created  a race of monsters called Gyaos.  To exterminate them, they created the  ultimate Orkin Man: Gamera.  But the people eating Gyaos managed to kill  the Atlaneans before Gamera could finish them.  Now, years later a hidden  clutch of Gyaos eggs hatch.

Director Shusuke Kaneko, a man of extensive talent and vision, has created a  fantastic kaiju film for both die-hard fans and the uninitiated viewer.  Great pain is taken to lend believability to the monsters as well as to the  story.  The spfx are awesome; actually some of the best work since  Tsubaraya.  The miniatures, models, and pyrotechnics all exhibit a  perfectionist's care in their execution.  Good, well-developed characters  and a good score all help to create an enjoyable viewing experience.  Though not the best kaiju film ever made(the story is very much a reworking  of classic Gamera scenarios, and you would have to literally deliver the  moon to beat such classic gems as Godzilla, Ghidrah, the 3-Headed Monster  and Monster Zero), Gamera is an excellent film that does any kaiju fanatic  proud!",961632000,,954,4.987261146496815

Everything about them; from special effects, acting,  direction to just plain storytelling; is far superior to anything Toho  films have ever done with Godzilla.

The special effects were suprisingly good.  Still using rubber  suits and beutifully detailed models, this movie keeps the old charm.  And  now, the tasteful use of Digital effects for Gamera's Fire Ball Breath and  Jets, brings this movie into the nineties.
It is enjoyable and fun for  kids young and old.  I recommend it highly to all fans.",947721600,10,483,4.6

Quite simply, the new suitmation techniques flat out blow the Godzilla Heisei series out of the water...and  this is a die-hard Godzilla fan saying that.  The new effects are  positively magnificent...a lot of Hollywood SFX artists who are going  CGI-happy should take a long , hard look at this film, as well as its two  sequels (""Gamera 2: The Attack Of The Legion"" is also available  here in the States)...they would learn a LOT.  Both Gamera and his  arch-rival Gyaos look positively terrific, and their rampages of  destruction are first-rate.  And a funny surprise is Steven Seagal's  Japanese daughter as Asagi, the girl who psychically links with  Gamera...she has ten times the acting talent of dear old Dad.

The plot really isn't anything to write home about  and none of the characters are really interesting.  The only thing that  really strikes me is an improvement is the degree of violence, on the other  hand it is sometimes nice to watch a Godzilla film and not see thousands of  people getting killed--sure, lots died in the first one, but there are  plenty of violent movies, so it is hard to say if things like seeing a  train get dropped into a whole line of evacuating people, or seeing Gaos  gulp down citizens is really an improvement.  Beyond this darker aspect and  the special effects I found nothing in the film I could really attach to.  For all their faults, the Godzilla films have charm and Godzilla actually  has something of a personality.  The makers of Gamera really need to get a  sense of humor and not work so hard to convince us their giant turtle is a  bad ass.",940982400,4,1283,4.3559322033898304

7875943,5,6304672128,"Possibly the single best Kaiju movie of the Heisei period. If you liked the 2014 Hollywood Godzilla you really will enjoy this. It hits the perfect blend of brutal destruction and horror, awesome Kaiju action, top notch effects, compelling human characters and story, and the perfect blend between disaster horror/SciFo science and mysticism that this sort of subject requires.

This is NOT the Gamera of your childhood. This is not the silly horrible stuff you saw MST3K riff on. This is a truly great movie that surpasses most of the modern era Godzilla movies. (The director of these three 90's Gamera movies did so well that Toho brought him in to do a 2004 Godzilla movie). Of the three Heisei Gamera Trilogy movies Guardian of the Universe is probably the best all around. The monsters and effects improve with the next two, but this has the best overall stand alone story. If you have not seen this you will not be disappointed. It is a great evening in.",1440460800,3,961,4.720238095238095

7875945,5,6304672128,"I remember watching this particular movie when I was about 10 years or so, and it was on a video tape. I rented from a video store when there were thriving in business before DVDs and Blue Rays as well as Youtube, Netflix, Hulu, & Crackle dominated home entertainment. I wasn't aware of the fact that this was the first reboot of the Heisei era of kaiju movies [the second was Gamera the Brave - Millennium era 2006] compared to its first film from the Shwa era - Gamera the Invincible from 1965. It was at my childhood that I really enjoyed kaiju movies like Godzilla and Gamera that made such an impact as I marveled on how talented [and destructive] these movies can be. So jumping over 10 years into my future, where I forgot about kaiju movies and focuses on school and careers, one night I just on youtube on my laptop and for some odd reason I start to remember kaiju movies again. When I typed in Gamera, all three eras of giant turtle were full length movies and free to watch. After watching them on YouTube I wanted to find a DVD or BlueRay of Gamera. THIS ONE, Gamera: Guardian of the Universe, was a bit tricky to purchase it was outrageous...until one person here on Amazon made an offer I couldn't refuse for $6 plus $3.99 for shipping & handling. I was not expecting a special custom made box for not just the first movie, but the other two that make the Gamera Trilogy.

NOW THIS MOVIE, which I personally believe is much better the 1965 original, is definitely WORTH WATCHING. It takes away the silly sequels from its past and rebuilds itself to what it once was from the first film. DO NOT be fooled that this is remake of GAMERA VS. GYAOS. Unlike that movie, it establishes a concrete origin story about the two creatures from an ancient civilization [Atlantis or Mu]. The special effects alone are also really awesome compared to cheesey mid-late 1960s and early 1970s Gamera movies. And just like the 2014 Godzilla movie, it really makes modern age on how serious monster attacks can cause so much damage. Overall this is a movie you can really sink your teeth into.",1430179200,2,2088,4.480314960629921
7875946,4,6304672128,"Gamera is my monster. I was never the world's biggest kaiju fan, but that monster turtle has my unending enthusiasm, particularly when it comes to his most recent trilogy. Fifteen years after Daiei Film was forced to close shop on the big guy, director Shusuke Kaneko (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Note/dp/B0017SVH5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Note</a>) breathed new life into the franchise and established my personal favorite era of Gamera. The ""Guardian"" trilogy provides an appealingly mature contrast to the goofier installments of the past, and while I consider this initial entry to be the weakest of the three, it's still a lot of fun.

The story: The discovery of a species of carnivorous, flying predator called the Gyaos coincides with the arrival of an enormous monster identified as Gamera. With the military confused about which entity to target, the salvation of the human race depends on Gamera's psychic connection with an unassuming young girl (Ayako Fujitani,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tokyo/dp/B001V7RTAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tokyo!</a>).

Gamera is fantastic, here. Whether or not you approve of his new Atlantean origins, it's cool that he's such a heroic figure. Naoaki Manabe and Jun Suzuki do a fantastic job with the costume, and the filmmakers are very successful in establishing a titanic sense of scale. I wish I could be as unilaterally praiseful of his rivals. Though notable for being the first time that a woman (Yuhmi Kaneyama) has played a kaiju, the Gyaos look a lot less realistic and have a harder time coming across as gigantic...at least until the final showdown. Without spoiling anything, the Gyaos aren't actually a match for Gamera until a final, larger specimen shows up for the last battle. This fight starts off conventionally with the two creatures having a sumo match amidst the buildings, but eventually achieves truly epic proportions - they even enter space, briefly. The fight is the highlight of the movie, which I had considered giving a lower rating before the showdown provided a necessary shot in the arm.

As tends to be the case, the human cast plays secondary roles to the monsters, but do well enough. I appreciate that the most influential characters are female: Shinobu Nakayama (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fist-of-Legend/dp/B003EVAG4C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fist of Legend</a>) does well as a proactive scientist and the aforementioned Ayako Fujitani shows surprising amounts of deftness in her first film role. Fujitani is, of course, the daughter of action star Steven Seagal, and while Seagal has done plenty of cool things, he has never had a mental bond with a turtle monster. The psychic connection between Gamera and Ayako's character is played pretty conservatively and without bombast, and while that's a little disappointing, it brings out a little extra in Fujitani's dramatic performance.

Production values of the film are strong. This is the first time for the franchise wherein traditional effects are mixed with computer-generated ones, albeit not too ambitiously - the forthcoming features would attempt more, in that regard. The movie is bright, colorful, and fun to look at, and in all, it's a triumph. Watch it as a part of the trilogy and you may just become a new fan. Established devotees should definitely purchase this.",1427328000,,3464,5.655769230769231
