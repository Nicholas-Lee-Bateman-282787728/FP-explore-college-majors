8554776,3,B0002C4J80,"I could not get this Dvd to play in a U.S. dvd player.  I had to set my computer to the region for Asia to view it.  The starring actor, Chan Wai Man, was a friend of Bruce Lee and said to be involved with Triads in real life.  He's very skillful and flexible in this flick and actually has some fighting similarity to Bruce Lee.  I believe another name for this flick was ""Chinese Mack"".  It has some nudity in it.
  Wu Tang Witch is all swordplay.  It is obviously retitled and my internet search drew a blank.  It has nothing to do with Wu Tang and is a very bad copy, several generations old.  I do not believe it was even made in China but may be Japanese.  If you like swordsman and women flying thru the air and bursting thru the roofs of huts, you will enjoy the parts of this movie that are not comedic.  It seems the palace has mostly gay courtesans so they don't hit on the sexually deprived princess.  If you need to add $[...] to get super saver shipping it's not a total waste of money.  But if you pay full price skip this purchase.",1289347200,3,1047,4.093596059113301
