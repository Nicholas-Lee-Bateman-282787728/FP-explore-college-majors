4842227,5,B005N4DNDY,"Love Begins is just that a beginning point for the saga of Clark and his first wife, Ellen.  My opinion was that it wasn't as interesting as the others released, but nevertheless I look forward to the next episode.",1323302400,2,214,4.487179487179487
4842228,5,B005N4DNDY,"I am an avid Janette Oke fan.  I enjoy watching the DVDs of every ""Love"" series of the movies that have been produced from her books.  Such faith driven movies are hard to come by.  The love of God is a part of everyone.  Especially like this one because Clark Davis is so strong a christian character in the all  previous episodes and now I know why.  He was on the wrong path, trying to be like his friend who became an outlaw.  Clark meets Ellen and then the story begins.  Its great!",1323216000,,487,4.161290322580645
4842229,4,B005N4DNDY,"My wife is a big Love Comes Softly Series Fan and has seen all of the movies. Though this is the case, we were not around when this originally aired on television so she was a bit bummed, so when given the chance to review this, she was quite excited. This movie provides the great back story to the character Clark Davis who you come to know in later movies. As in all of the movies (or so I am told) this is a love story, but it is more than that too. The characters are strong and the plot is engaging. Though some of the acting is simply ok, I still have to say that it was a good movie and one that would make me want to potentially watch more to see what happens next.  So whether you are a long-time fan of the series, or a newbie like me, this was a good movie that I would recommend to all.",1321401600,69,799,3.901840490797546
4842230,5,B005N4DNDY,"Just like in the ""Love Comes Softly"" Series, this is a great prequel to Clark Davis' story. This movie is well done and told in the fashion of all the other movies. This is a touching story of how two people from very different ways of life come to meet eachother and eventually fall in love. This is not to be missed if you are a ""Love Come Softly"" fan!",1319414400,97,354,4.071428571428571

Clark falls in love with Ellen (Julie Mond) early on in this movie.  Ellen is a strong willed woman who tries to run a tight ship, until  Clark comes into the picture. Then you have Cassie ( Jere Burns)  to help keep Clark on his toes.  The entire cast works really good together.  I enjoyed this movie so much .  Clark was going to move on  and fullfill  his dream ,  but instead he married Ellen and lived happily ever after.  So please go out and get this movie or purchase it from Amazon like I did.  These are great movies.",1436313600,,656,4.136

4842431,4,B005N4DNDY,"All of these movies based on the Janette Oke ""Love Comes Softly"" series bother me a little bit because they veer so far from the book storylines. They've killed off characters that never died and created characters that never existed. In this movie, we see the story of how Clark met his first wife, Ellie (I think?) but that was never part of the books. Even so, it's still a clean movie that is worth watching, and maybe owning if you collect them all. It's not super awesome (my favorite is still #2 in the series with January Jones and Logan Bartholemew). I like to view this movie as a stand-alone, as if the rest of the movies don't follow it. That way I can pretend that the wife never dies, and she and Clark live happily ever after.",1430352000,4,741,4.338129496402877

4842621,5,B005N4DNDY,"Possibly one of my favorite movies. I like good clean movies (or as clean as you can get nowadays). Love Begins was really, really clean.  I think it had only one swear word and the only violence was where men fight with each other in the town's diner, breaking a few chairs and a window.  A man also falls from a roof but isn't seriously injured. Most people would skip it because they think it is too predictable or ""lame"", but I like movies like that because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been ""slimed"".  The Dove Foundation gave it a five star and approved it for ages 12 and older.

I don't like the entire series, several are a little boring and it seems that Janette Oke has a thing with killing off the husbands and having the women remarry.  So I only watch certain ones.  Love Begins first (since is covers how the ""Love Comes Softly"" saga began), second is Love Comes Softly, third is Love's Enduring Promise, fourth is Love's Unending Legacy, and 5th is Love's Unfolding Dream.  They are all amazing, really clean, high morals, family friendly, inspiring, and focuses on the more important things in life.

Ellen and her younger sister Cassie struggle to maintain the family farm after their father's death.  Clark Davis works for the two sisters to pay off his debts after getting into a fight in town (that he didn't start and tried to stop).  Cassie immediately takes to him and loves helping him around the farm, but Ellen doesn't trust him or like him at first.  However, before long they unexpectedly start to develop feelings for each other and their relationship grows.

Overall, I really love this move and will definitely watch it over and over again.",1372636800,,1720,4.5667752442996745

4842687,2,B005N4DNDY,"I love this series but this one was the worst of them.  While it's pretty much G rated like the others and you can watch it with anyone there are just too many unbelievable things in it.  Like two sisters stuck with the family ranch who can afford to eat in town at the restaurant every day and run the whole ranch themselves...yah right.  Or the restaurant in town advertising it was homestyle cooking when gee everything back then was homemade, like they would have called it that.  It was like putting 20th century dialogue in what is supposed to be a different time period.  Plus Clark who is such a man of faith in the other movies seems to have not come from that kind of background at all.  I just found these inconsistencies hard to swallow and never reached a point where I really felt for the characters because this movie did not have the emotional element that say Love Comes Softly did.  I never read the book so don't know if it was bad screenwriters or a bad prequel novel, but it just wasn't as believable or heartwarming.  I was happy to have another piece of the story, it's just I didn't like or believe that these characters then turned into what became Love Comes Softly.  So I found it interesting (to know how it began), but definitely not as good as the rest of them.",1361059200,12,1291,4.368200836820083

4842723,4,B005N4DNDY,Good movie.  I would have given it a 5 star rating if it hadn't been for the one curse word.  Why do they have to do that?  This movie of course would appeal more to girls than guys.,1357516800,,182,3.736842105263158

All series are touching and takes you back to the time of our ancestors in the west or coming from the east with little know knowlege of what was ahead to start a new life with your wife and the obsticle of life that lay ahead for you both. All the Love Begins and Loves Journey all of them are great for a collection, I like taking a weekend when I feel i want to watch something wholesome and clean and will relax me into just relaxing and going from one story to another almost like watching the whole thing of Gone with the Wind it take several hours or two days to get thought them but its a great story.",1355788800,,797,3.9565217391304346

It is easy to follow, with pleasing, clear-cut  characters and a straight-line plot.  The picture is clear and fits widescreen TV, and there are real subtitles.  It has a cheerful outlook, is respectful of traditional values, and it all adds up to a good (but not exceptional) sample of the genre.

4842782,5,B005N4DNDY,This movie is just as heart warming as the others that follow it. It gives insight into how Clark Davis became who he is in the later movies. I believe this movie is essential in the series. It shows us how he got from point A (being a lost young man) to point B (a grown man who's faith is virtually unshakeable) however I would have liked to have seen Missy's birth included in this or perhaps another movie about that portion of his life. I think adding that would make their whole story complete.,1327536000,17,500,4.273684210526316

4842805,3,B005N4DNDY,I got this for my daughter for Christmas. I loved the first one. The second and third aren't bad either  but the more they make the worse they get and I hate to say this is the worst one. The main girl character is so silly! She is over the top mean and then silly and giddy latter. The boy was beautiful and acted better than anyone else in the movie but no one else pulls there weight. The story falls flat to me too. So disappointed but I will not give it a lower rating because these are good films that are clean and sweet and I will continue to support this type of entertainment.,1325116800,6,586,4.051724137931035
