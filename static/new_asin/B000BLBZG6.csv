2423479,5,B000BLBZG6,This tries to uncover certain issues in the porn business. For example the amount of work availabe to non-white performers. I had never thought this would be an issue but surprisingly some females will not work with non-white males and there is the thought that some people will not purchase/rent a video that features a colored performer. Other issues includes the risk of HIV and weather the female performers were abused when they were kids. One thing that is not covered is the amount of drug use in the industry. Director Dag Yngvesson knows he always liked porn don't let him lie to you.,1142899200,27,593,4.711538461538462
2423480,5,B000BLBZG6,"I saw this documentary at a film festival a little while ago.  The movie is incredible.  It really gives you an insight into the porn industry and lets you see the good and the bad.  The movie gives a truly unbiased viewpoint and provides you with the information on which to base your own opinions.  The soundtrack and video quality is top-notch.  I think there is a Web site that has more information about it...  If you are looking for a porno flick, this is not it.  It is a well done documentary.",1130889600,68,501,4.32258064516129

2423485,1,B000BLBZG6,I thought this documentary was really weak. I feel like I got ripped to be honest haha As I watched this documentary I found myself constantly looking to see how much time was left. It's really a film that you have to sit through verses a film that you watch. It failed to grab my attention at any point. The people this film interviews are extremely annoying either because they seem dumb or are very clearly racist. This DVD is tainting my collection.,1310774400,,453,4.469879518072289
2423486,1,B000BLBZG6,"If this movie ever had a niche, it has not aged well.  This director is the sort of self indulgent dweeb that makes one cringe, and this matters as he is on screen and narrates personal anecdotes.  He attempts to be challenging and self righteous and a bit above it all, while at the same time he obviously made a movie about something he loved.  He sets up a straw man in the form of non-white performances and is very critical on this issue while managing to miss black male and interracial material as a trend happening right under his nose (there was a veritable torrent of interracial adult material concurrent with this release).  Don't waste your time or money.",1295827200,5,668,4.541666666666667
2423487,5,B000BLBZG6,"Good documentary.  Liked the part about Jeanna Fine and how she lives (lived?).  The drugs, the relationship with her husband/boyfriend, the tricks she does on the side to make ends meet, and how it all worked together isn't something you see every day.  The porn audition stuff was interesting.  Amazing to me that people end up making these decisions, so it was cool to get perspective behind that and more information why they do.

If you're a fan of Jeanna Fine, you'll like this.  Fans of adult movies will like this.  Pretty good documentary.  Definitely something that will make you think.",1254614400,8,596,4.8316831683168315
2423488,5,B000BLBZG6,"This was a great documentary, I love anything that has to do with the real people in porn, and I think there should be more.  The biggest problem I see with this movie is that it was done right before the internet boom.  Since the internet boom most of what you see is pretty much a thing of the past....",1245110400,7,304,4.05
2423489,4,B000BLBZG6,"Overall, this is a good documentary.  It was a little more explicit than I expected, but definitely not hardcore.  This is a dated title: one of the topics discussed is the lack of work for black porn actors.  This no longer seems to hold true with the plethora of black and interracial titles flooding the market.  It was good to see the lighter side of some of the actors and Jeanna Fine's drug addiction was also a major subject of the documentary.  It would be nice to see a documentary about the health hazards inherent in the porn industry, which was mentioned in passing maybe once or twice.",1242432000,14,598,4.5
2423490,5,B000BLBZG6,"As I am working on a research project dealing with the adult industry, I ordered ""Rated-X"" with the hope that it could shed light on the interviews and accounts that I have already studied.  It does just that.  It brings to life the players in the business and does a credible job of revealing how videos are made.

More importantly, it shows the industry's psychological impact on those who are in it.  Especially significant is the presentation of the male performers.  So often, I have discovered that the concerns of male performers are shortchanged in that most resources I have used concentrate on the women in the business.  But the issues that men encounter on the set and in their personal lives are clearly pointed out.

There are times when I found some moments to be emotionally overwhelming.  Jenna Fine's drug abuse stands out, as does Bill Margold's  efforts to comfort the girls coming into the business.  So often when being interviewed, the women seem distant and troubled . . . perhaps revealing an unspoken sadness.  In addition, the video deals with a part of the adult business that is little discussed . . . that of racism.

For anyone who is interested in casual look at the porn, I highly recommend Dag Yngvesson's film.  For others who may want a more academic investigation, I believe it to be invaluable.",1221609600,47,1332,4.739130434782608
8088557,4,B000BLBZG6,"THE FILM: I have seen many documentaries on the subject matter, but so far ""Rated X"" sill holds the top spot for me. The film has a good overall flow. Also, something appeals to me about Dag Yngvesson realness. His style of exploration is very sincere and down to earth. He really does makes you feel like you're there on the journey with him learning things. In my book, this film is a documentary classic.
THE DVD: Sadly, the disc is quite flawed. Some of the menu items (including one that is, ironically enough, labeled ""DVD Credits"") proved inaccessible. There is also heavy skipping half way into the film, so in order to be able to actually view it, I had to copy the .VOB files to a hard drive and watch them on a computer. Speaking of which, there's no copy-protection applied, which is another clue to this DVD's poor standards of authoring. Lastly, the video image would exhibit visible MPEG compression macro-blocking artifacts here or there, but it's not too bad.
SHOULD YOU BUY IT?: Well, if you absolutely must own a copy of this classic and you don't mind the somewhat flawed menu, the skipping, the occasional compression artifacts, then sure. After all, flawed or not, at the moment, this DVD is the highest quality in which the film is available.",1512864000,,1265,4.651785714285714
