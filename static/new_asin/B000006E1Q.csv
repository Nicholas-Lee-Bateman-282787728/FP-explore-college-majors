Storyline reminds me a lot of Who's Affraid of Virginia Wolf.",1173312000,,155,4.464285714285714
1192975,1,B000006E1Q,"This film and 'Life is Sweet' (I haven't seen any other Mike Leigh films) gave me a creeping feeling in my stomach. Mainly this was caused by the sheer stupidity of his working class characters. And I mean stupid - this is the fundamental message of these films, that working class people are thick. This stupidity leads to emotional crudeness and a total lack of warmth. I grew up in a working class family in London and this is not my main experience of the people. Yes, they could be direct (thank God!) but they were also often clever (note: not intellectual) and extremely supportive of family and friends. You have to ask yourself why this man keeps making films about a class of people he considers to be stupid and crude. If the subjects of his films were Jews or West Indians, there would be all hell to pay, and I don't suppose he would get screened. But film-makers and actors in this country are largely middle-class and will therefore quite happily support what appears to be a shared prejudice. And the actors aren't much better, with their horribly caricaturised (and largely unrealistic) accents. But I guess they enjoy getting their hands dirty with Leigh, especially if there's an award at the end of it, when they can turn up at the ceremony looking properly middle-class with educated accent restored, just in case anyone was under the impression they were actually like those awful people in the film. In short, there's a nasty, bitter mind at work behind these films, on a long quest, I suspect, to prove he's better than those ghastly Hollywood showmen by creating 'realistic' characters he can keep constrained in a sub-human fantasy world of his own creation.",1131667200,7,1684,4.750853242320819
1192976,3,B000006E1Q,"the conversation is purposely dull, yet it indeed sounds funny.  this is the mike leigh's magic.  the only disappointment about this piece is that the quality of the image is really poor.  it feels like playing the video tape upon the vcr of 20 years of age.  this, in a way, does make you feel like you are watching a 70's programme, perhaps.",1129507200,,343,4.396825396825397
1192977,5,B000006E1Q,"Like ""The Office"" 25 years later, ""Abigail's Party"" is such perfectly targeted, close to the truth humour that it makes you laugh out loud and cringe with embarrassment at the same time. In a setting that represents everyone's nightmare of mid 70's middle class life it sucks you into its brilliantly drawn world and then leaves you as some sort of unwelcome voyeur in the cocktail party from hell. Like most of the people there, you want to get out but you can't, and as things go from bad to worse you end up totally transfixed by the sheer awfulness of the situation you find yourself in.

With characters whose lives are so desperately frustrating that real aggression lies only just below the surface, this is black comedy at its very best precisely because it's much too close to reality for comfort. You can't help but laugh but you know that you're laughing at these people and their tragically depressing lives, and by the ""sting in the tail"" ending you really wish you hadn't. Brilliantly written, directed and acted ""Abigail's Party"" is far more than a humorous period piece and, quite rightly, stands up there as one of the very best British TV plays of the past thirty years.",1104192000,8,1188,4.684210526315789
1192978,5,B000006E1Q,"This wonderfully comic play can be viewed at many levels:
- A clash of classes (Beverley and the neighbouring couple are working class; her husband Lawrence aspires to be middle class; and Abigail's Mum is upper middle.)
- A conflict of skills (Beverley as the stay-at-home, childless wife doesn't work, doesn't cook and orders poor Lawrence to do virtually everything, whereas her apparently inept neighbour comes into her own as nurse at the climax of the play.)
- As an allegory on the white man's departure from Africa. At the time of the play's creation, Britain was negotiating its exit from Zimbabwe (then Rhodesia). Abigail's posh Mum doesn't know whether to leave the partygoers to it -- possibly causing havoc -- or to interfere herself, or to ask Lawrence to go round and report back.
Whichever way you look at it, it's tremendous fun throughout, with a flawless performance by Alison Steadman as Beverley. There are some fantastic lines, most of them uttered by Janine Duvitski (who went on to star in ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE), such as ""I've got very beautiful lips"" (you have to see Steadman's reaction), and ""We're so alike"" (ditto).
Strangely the weakest performance is by Tim Stern as Lawrence, who never totally convinces as the stressed-out, over-sensitive estate agent who thinks he's cultured because he owns a set of Shakespeare's works which he never expects to read.
The accompanying featurette is all too short, but it's pretty clear that this play simply wouldn't have existed without Alison Steadman's demonic creation. Mike Leigh may have been the writer/ director, but Beverley was based on an Essex woman and a cosmetics demonstrator whom Steadman met prior to the improvisations.
The DVD picture quality is a good as you could possibly expect from a BBC 1970s studio production. The 1970s decor comes up wonderfully!",1078704000,19,1844,5.009771986970684
1192979,5,B000006E1Q,"I saw this film years ago and it has stuck in my mind ever since. Excellent! It's just a small group of people in a room, but it's far far more entertaining than any multi-million dollar Hollywood blockbuster.",1050537600,3,209,4.526315789473684

1192981,5,B000006E1Q,"This has to be one of the funniest films ever to be shown on british tv. I  first saw this film back in the 70's, and it really made an impact on me  and my friends. I now have the video, and still after all these years, my  family and I get together to watch this all over again. Alison Steadman  gives a wonderful performance, please keep looking out for her cutting  glances. With the music of donna summer and demis russos playing all the  way through this play...adds to the ambience This is definatly a cult  video.....you will catch yourself repeating lines from this film ...ie:  ""are you allright sue"" ""is he always violant""  etc  etc.. PLEASE BUY THIS VIDEO...it will be used time and time again, in the  end you will know the lines (like we do) completly off by heart......",965260800,4,784,4.4125874125874125
1192982,4,B000006E1Q,"Well, what do you expect when you have someone like Beverly as your hostess?  When the said bored housewife decides to hold a dinner party inviting neighbours you can bet she wants a more insidious and vicious bit  of fun than a game of charads.
She dresses in low-cut tops, flirts with  her neighbour's husband and does everything she possibly can to humiliate  and put down her helpless guests.  And you can tell she holds her prim and  proper husband Laurence in contempt as well.  This is very much a play/film  where sub-text and interplay are essential to make it worthwhile viewing  and if you don't watch stolen glances and listen to the odd remark  carefully then you might miss important bits;  so if you prefer more  in-your-face type films then you're unlikely to like this flick.  But stick  with it and you'll enjoy.
So who is Abigail then?  Why, the  fifteen-year-old daughter of one of Beverly's guests who is having her  first party and boy is Beverly going to enjoy stirring things up.
Watch  out for an unexpected and  dramatic ending.",956793600,4,1054,4.6923076923076925

7904108,5,B000006E1Q,"Dennis Potter famously said he didn't like this film because it was a film about 'them'
Mike Leighs' response to this was that is wasn't. It was a film about 'us'

I believe Leighs' career, since that early breakthrough, has shown who was right.......
Have you seen Mr Turner ?
You should.",1420070400,,289,4.5576923076923075
7904109,5,B000006E1Q,"This is basically a stage play recorded with a TV camera in 1977.  It says a lot about marriages during that era, the desire to keep up with the Joneses, rampant alcoholism, and the absurd pressure some middle aged people seemed to feel to seem young forever.  The lead character Barbara is pathetic and insufferable but fascinating to watch.  Mike Leigh would later try to write several other ""nouveaux riche"" characters like her but none would ever pack quite the same punch.",1372377600,,477,4.7926829268292686

7904111,5,B000006E1Q,"This is a comedy of suburbia (British suburbia) wishing it were something else.  It's made priceless by the performances of the three women.  Harriet Reynolds stands out as Sue, an unremittingly morose one-and-a-half-times-size Julie Andrews look- and sound-alike who, like everyone else involved, falls in the path of party hostess and steam-roller Beverly (Alison Steadman).  Janine Duvitski is painfully funny as the irrepressibly sympathetic Angela who always finds something worth commenting on in the most banal conversations.",1345334400,2,532,5.883116883116883
7904112,5,B000006E1Q,"Abigail's Party is widely seen as one of the greatest ever one off TV programmes by Brit viewers. A comedy drama masterpiece in natural dialogue, embarrasing situations and all-too believable characters. If you feel uncomfortable watching this and wish to be somewhere else (just like the play's character Susan ),then the brilliant Mike Leigh has done his job in showing the awfulness of 70's middle class suburban Britain - but you still have to watch all of it! This play is still loved and respected to this day in the UK, possibly due to when the BBC repeated it when rival TV channel ITV were on strike and off the air. This was back when there were only 3 channels in the UK, so an amazing 16 million people saw this ( a huge audience figure in the UK for a TV play ). I was one of those millions, and even though I was just a kid I was aware I was watching something special, even if all the play's subtleties were way over my head. I'd best describe it as a British 70's tv sitcom but directed by Harold Pinter. I suspect Ricky Gervais is a fan too, as The Office also captures all the same social awkwardness and tedium of the modern age, along with a central character just like David Brent who's an unbearable deluded idiot that you still end up sympathizing with. Especially worth seeing for Alison Steadman's powerhouse central performance as the dreadful Beverly, though the rest of the cast are perfect too.",1330646400,2,1423,4.498069498069498
7904113,1,B000006E1Q,"Abigail's Party: 2 out of 10. This is a poorly lit (especially first half) extremely stagy TV show (basically a filmed play.) Highly regarded by some critics but at close to two hours with 5 very unpleasant people it hardly ranks as entertainment.

The main character Beverly reminds one of Peg from Married with Children but with no Al to provide the counter pointing laughs she remains strangely unchallenged throughout. In fact the description of Abigail's Party as a comedy is a bit of a puzzler as this is drama writ large. A true character exercise only a stage actor could love.

While insightful into the desperation of some of the middle class of England, countless movies and shows have exposed middle class foibles with better results. Even a half hour sitcom like ""Keeping Up Appearances"" covers the same ground more completely and with many more laughs.

Truth be told these people would be miserable no matter what class they were in and like a trapped guest I was looking to leave Abigail's Party as soon as I could",1267833600,3,1030,4.743016759776537
7904114,5,B000006E1Q,"There exists a certain unexplored territory.  Or so I thought.  Between Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf and 70's porn.  And here it is.  Wow!  All pornography is is man's attempt to fill in the missing scenes of soap operas.  This is more unusual void filling than that.  This is the greatest porn film ever made -- without sex.  So many times here the dialogue and situations feel like a porn movie is about to unzip yet they continue and you cannot believe it.  This is very funny and if you've only seen Mike Leigh's later works nothing like you'd expect.  If you've ever sat through through Look Back In Anger or other highly overpraised, or at least dated works.  This is not that.  The ironic mustache of recent years began to grow here.  I don't know how this was received at the time but this is  fantastic.  I rented The Rules of The Game, The Earrings of Madame De, Divorce Italian Style and this.  And this is the best.",1264809600,2,928,4.402366863905326
7904115,3,B000006E1Q,"This is a comedy that will make you snicker, masquerading as a (not really) great ensemble peice.  The characterizations have all the subtlety of a college work, frankly.  Leigh sinks his teeth into social class like a little Rotweiler and doesn't let go.  In some works like ""Secrets and Lies"" it feels visionary.  In others like this it feels like a self righteous college kidwho's only just read Marx wagging his finger at his parents. Okay so everyone in Abigail's Party is priggishly middle class wannabe, or an obnoxious upper working class type.  They're having a little casual mixer at Bev and Larry's.  It gets very ugly what with Bev's working class coming through as she drinks, and Larry's priggishness coming through as he watches Bev throw herself at her new neighbor's husband. The thing is the anger and conflict feel quite forced. There's no way anybody has EVER seen a party go down like this since ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" which had an emotional impact because it was about the lies we tell ourself to keep on going.  Instead this is just sort of a term paper on social classes, and it doesn't really give anybody any credit- or humanity.
At first though its very funny.  The characters ask each other for a drink more often than in a Dasheil Hammett story. And Alison Steadman's accent as Bev will be one to mimic for the centuries. And the seventies decor and costumes are to die for.

I would have loved this if I'd run across it on cable. If you're seeking out Mike Leigh go get Secrets and Lies. He's never done anything better.",1257292800,3,1561,4.6268115942028984
7904116,5,B000006E1Q,"Based on a theater play produced for the BBC, Leigh's dark-humored situational farce examines a group of people feebly attempting to have a good time although they are all secretly miserable. As Beverly, Steadman (wife of the director) is aggressively jolly and controlling, not to mention drunk and openly flirtatious with Salthouse's simmering Tony. For every awkward moment, another drink is poured. This is an ensemble piece, and the interplay between the five actors, confined to a single living-room stage, is exquisitely handled by Leigh. Crash this ""Party"" for a harshly funny look at failed marriage and the cruelties of passive aggression.",1183420800,5,649,5.372549019607843
