8583029,5,B00CLDOZDW,"Great setlist and very energetic live performance from the veteran Scottish rockers. A 2005 show filmed at Shepperton studios.  Very good audio/video quality. The band is TIGHT and the audio is crystal clear. This one sounds best turned up to eleven. :)  If you're a Nazareth fan you should have this.  A couple of short behind the scenes films are nifty bonus features.
