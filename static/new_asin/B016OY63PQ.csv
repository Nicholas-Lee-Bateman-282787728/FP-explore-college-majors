7476687,4,B016OY63PQ,Fantastic movies and unopened great stuff right there. My only qualm Is it was from canada and the blue ray/ultraviolet code to keep a digital copy is only for canada.. I live in the us.. so you can see my dileman I didn't know this wold be an issue when I purchased. But still great price for an awesome buy.,1473206400,2,309,4.166666666666667
7476688,1,B016OY63PQ,"Very misleading. I paid $40 when I could've bought both movies individually for under $20 because the description stated digital copy.... Yea, ONLY in certain ""areas"" and the United States is NOT included in those ""areas"".",1470355200,8,222,5.194444444444445
7476689,2,B016OY63PQ,Digital copy is only for Ireland and U.K. It doesn't work in USA I had to email providing company Sony to find out what's wrong with code they explained and they where kind enough to add the movies to my collection.,1508025600,,215,4.2682926829268295

7476692,1,B016OY63PQ,"DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM IF YOU WANT DIGITAL COPY!  It is very misleading.  I bought this for my daughter for a road trip, and I was very disappointed when I wasn't able to redeem the digital copy.  If you just want the discs, it is fine.

However, my digital code failed....",1480291200,,98,5.533333333333333
8736917,1,B016OY63PQ,"I bought these DVDs with total excitement of watching them.  NOWHERE was there an explanation of different regions on the planet from where DVDs can come.  So I ordered and found that there was a warning on the wrapping: This will not work on any player that is not Region B or Region free.  Huh?  I have no clue what my player is, no clue what a region is (until I looked it up), and am very dissatisfied with my effort and loss of money, when I simply thought I was buying movies I wanted to see and could play them. Now I'm concerned with my second effort - no information to the contrary that I will be able to watch them.  Am I successful or out more money?",1536019200,,662,4.10077519379845
8736918,3,B016OY63PQ,I am at a point in life where if I am going to buy a movie I am going to buy one that also offers the digital HD code so we can watch the movies we have where ever we go. I just went to type in the code for these movies and it says code not valid in your territory because its a digital code from LONDON. There is nothing wrong with the DVDs but I am pretty disappointed that I can not use the digital code. When I buy from amazon I expect to get things that work for my area.,1535673600,,476,3.6310679611650487

8736921,4,B016OY63PQ,"The movies were great!! But the digital copy was not supposed to be used in the US.  I had to contact Sony in order to claim the digital copy.  A suggestion: please ensure the copies being sold are for the area in which the buyer is located, or make it know in the details of the item so the buyer is aware.",1534204800,,307,3.935483870967742

8736925,5,B016OY63PQ,The digital copy did not work. I tried to contact Sony to get correct code but no help. I would have lowered the stars for this review due to the digital code but these movies are so cute. The actual movies are worth full 5 stars.,1528243200,,230,4.021739130434782
8736926,3,B016OY63PQ,"Movie is cute and my 4 year old loves both 1&2.  We bought it for the digital copy, which apparently isn't from our region.  I had to call the studio and they said it was the wrong region, unable to be redeemed in the USA.  Had to return it, if it weren't for that issue I would have kept it.",1517961600,,292,3.8333333333333335
