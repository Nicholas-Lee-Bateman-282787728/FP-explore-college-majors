Though the (...) scenes are central to the plot, that's not all this film is about. And I have to say, as far as (...) scenes go, these are well-filmed. They are realistic without being (....) Joe and Sissel are teenagers growing into adults. Their passion, through fits and starts, grows into love. Slowly, each learns about responsibility and failure. Some viewers may wonder about Sissel's strange behavior, just as Joe does. But I think she's bearing the brunt of her parents' recent break-up and her little brother's trouble with the broken family. All the while, Sissel's parents act frequently like children. I couldn't figure out why Joe, the boy from Brooklyn, was in Louisiana at all except that he was on ""vacation."" But who cares? I liked being able to think up my own various scenarios for his departure from New York to the South. The soundtrack was the best I've heard in a long time. I, like another reviewer, had some trouble with the dream sequences. But, they also gave me additional food for thought. I see very little meaningful symbolism used in films; this one's chock full of it. Enjoy.",979689600,15,1272,4.657777777777778
7886628,1,6305263264,"One of the reasons I dearly love independent cinema is the fact that it often breaks the rules of Hollywood, which state that a film must include an all-star cast, car crashes, lots of special effects, and stunningly  beautiful characters in order to make money.  With budgets approaching  pocket change, many indie directors are breaking new ground in visual style  by sidestepping these laws.  The downside?  Some filmmakers are a bit too  eager to disregard rules which *shouldn't* be ignored.  ""First Love,  Last Rites,"" for instance, does away with the notion that a movie  should contain a coherent narrative.  It cheerfully tosses aside the  thought that we should care about our characters.  It laughs in the face of  the idea that a movie should hold the audience's attention.  In short,  ""First Love, Last Rites"" is a film that goes nowhere, and is in  absolutely no hurry to arrive.
  The story, such as it is, revolves  around Joey (Giovanni Ribisi) and Sissel (Natasha Wagner), a young couple  living together in a run-down shack in the swamplands of Louisiana.  What  do they see in each other?  I have no idea.  Apart from the fact that  neither of them are the least bit personable and always appear to be half-  asleep, they seem to have absolutely nothing in common.  Oh, I take that  back: they both love sex.  Approximately a third of the film's scenes  feature the two of them boinking like rabbits.
  I'd like to describe the  film's ending, but it doesn't really have one.  Sure, there's a moment when  images are no longer appearing on your television, but the final scene is  purely ambiguous.  Pick any moment from the movie, and it would be just as  sensible a place to end as the one chosen by the director.  A great film  can have an ambiguous ending: both ""The Full Monty"" and  ""Chasing Amy"" leave things up in the air at their conclusion; as  I left the theater after each, I found myself wondering what the characters  would do next.  Although ""First Love, Last Rites"" leaves a lot of  unanswered questions when the credits begin to roll, I have not devoted one  iota of thought to how they could be answered.  I just don't care, unless  it involves Joey and Sissel both getting a swift kick in the rear.
  ""First Love, Last Rites"" is a tedious viewing experience, full of  bizarre symbolism (the rat in the wall, for example), paper-thin  characters, and scenes that make no sense whatsoever.  I've seen home  movies that had a better storyline.  Though the images of the Louisiana  bayou are occasionally lovely, most of the visuals depict the interior of  the squalid, rodent-infested house inhabited by our two main characters.  Only the music shines, capturing the flavor of the photography in every  scene.  Skip the film and check out the soundtrack instead.  I wish I had.",930268800,3,2812,4.74321503131524
