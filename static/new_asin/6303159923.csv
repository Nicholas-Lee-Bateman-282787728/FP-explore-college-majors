588716,2,6303159923,"This was not one of his best works, this movie has so much repetitiveness and an exteamly slow story, it did not have to be as long as it was which is too bad this story could have had a lot of potential.
If you looking for a good Stephen King TV movie try The Stand, Storm of the Century, It or even The Langoliers those are so much better and far more superior than the Golden Years.",1020470400,,385,3.948717948717949
588717,4,6303159923,"Okay, it needed an editor to get a hold of this, but it is King and they don't edit his books near enough, so a tale where he had a hand in production, even directed part of it, was sure to be the same.
Despite that, it is a marvelous tale, not so horrific as most King stories, so most King fans will find it dull.  It is more that horror or Sci Fi, it is a gentle tale and romantic, in its own fashion.
Keith Szarabajka (Mickey Kostmayer of the Equilizer; Angel; Nighlight) is a superb, underrated talent.  In his middle 30's in real life at the time, he portrays an old man nearing retirement working at a top secret lab as a janitor.  There is (UNFORTUNATELY) the mad scientist that King should have been ashamed for creating in the stereotypical fashion straight from 1930's horror films, but there is also so really neat characters that round at the tale and make up for the deficiencies.  Ed Lauter is great, in a range of role he does not usually play.
In a lab accident, Szarajabka is accidently exposed to a substance that reverses his age.  And that is what makes the tale work so well.  The fine, subtle talents of Szarabajka and the amazing Francis Sternhagen as his wife, who is watching her beloved husband grow younger day and day, make up for the uneven writing by King and sloppy editing.
Maybe everyone should forget this is Stephan King, and just judge the film on its own merits and I think you will be surprised.
I nice way to pass a rainy day.",1017964800,9,1466,4.3321167883211675
588718,3,6303159923,"While this mini-series was not the finest work ever done by Stephen King, it is worth watching.  The series also suffers by a change in writers for the finale.  The story is quite simple and the biggest suprise is that there are no real suprises.  This would be a better purchase as a part of the 5-part Stephen King collector's set (The Stand, The Golden Years, Cujo, The Langoliers and Thinner).",1016755200,,397,4.563380281690141
588719,3,6303159923,"When this miniseries first aired, I remember getting lost in the world it created.  Upon viewing this new DVD transfer however, I'm confused as to how I could've liked it so much.
The story of what would happen if an elderly man was accidentally exposed to some chemicals that made him become younger is very intriguing and full of possibilites.  King jumps on those posibilities and can get your mind going, but the execution of them is flawed.  I like the languid and reflective pace of the series, but there are too many scenes that don't add to the plot, don't make much sense, or worse, repeat points that have already been covered.
I remembered the strongest element of ""Golden Years"" being the relationship between the elderly couple Halrn and Gina and I find I'm still touched by it today.  The actors do such terrific work that I never once questioned the reality of their love and concern for one another.  It's refreshing to see an elderly couple that's so 'normal', 'real' and alive.  Most of the other preformances though are a bit too over the top to be believable.  The mad scienist especially, seems to be making an entirely different film than the rest of the crew!
The central relationship and interesting premise are almost enough to make up these flaws, but then we get a rushed, tacked on ending that defies all reason.  It's a great dissapointment after investing so much time and caring so much for Harlan and Gina.  Don't see ""Golden Years"" expecting too much and you'll find many things to like about it, but it will never be anyones favorite Stephen King project.",1006041600,17,1589,4.68705035971223
588720,2,6303159923,"I knew nothing beyond the jacket blurb when I rented this video.  But when I got into it, it intrigued me enough to sit through the whole thing (in two sessions - it's a VHS two-reeler on the long side).
See the other reviews for plot details.  It's an intriguing premise.  The chemically-dusted protagonist comes only gradually to realize he is growing younger.  The slow unfolding of that proposition occurs like artichoke leaves being peeled back, well done.  The byplay between the elderly couple (Keith Szarabaika and Frances Sternhagen) is very well acted, sweet and almost believable.  The heroine Terry (Felicity Huffman) is nice eye candy.  The villain Jude (R.D. Call) is duly evil but somewhat over the top.  But much of the other acting is truly over the top - the ""mad scientist"" Toddhunter, the Major, the hippies, etc.  Those exaggerated, caracaturish personae get in the way of what began as a promising plot.  The ending leaves one kinda unfulfilled, too.",980899200,,972,4.944444444444445
588721,4,6303159923,"Well, King has strayed from his usual horror story genre to produce a little bit of TV mini-series heaven.  Set in upstate New York, ""Golden Years"" is based around 70 year old Harlan Williams, a janitor working  for a top secret government plant.  He is accidently caught in an explosion  from one of the labs where mad scientist Dr Todhunter was conducting  'regeneration' experiments.  Over time, Harlan begins to notice sudden  changes in his body.  Brown hairs begin to reappear in the place of grey  ones, his skin becomes softer, his eyes don't need glasses anymore!  He  begins to get younger. The accident causes some concern in the government,  so the spooks are soon on the scene.  Witnesses to what is happening to  Harlan begin to disappear after the arrival of government agent Jude  Andrews. The heads of the plant, Terri Spann and General Lewis Crewes, grow  suspicious of the intentions of the people they have been working for and  decide to get to the old man and his wife before the spooks do. A race  across the states begins, Harlan and his wife flee for their lives while  coping with the effects of his reverse ageing. This is a great little  story, and had it not been rushed to an ending, it may have become a King  classic.  The original ending to the series finished on a cliff-hanger  where Jude Andrews and his henchmen may have actually caught Harlan.  It  ended with the tag-line 'To Be Continued...'  But the TV network was  disappointed with viewing figures, so a new ending was shot, providing  closure for this quite inventive story.  The concept is great, the  characters are brilliant (especially the play-off between old enemies Jude  Andrews and Terri Spann as she manages to be one step ahead of him every  time), it is just a shame that the final scene was so rushed. For die-hard  sci-fi and King fans, it's definately worth a look.",952560000,33,1874,4.685185185185185
588722,1,6303159923,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  The directing was extemely poor and the plot confusing.  The ""mad scientist"" was so over the top that it was a farce.  The only saving grace in this whole  affair was the acting of Keith Szarabajka (one of the Equalizer's  sidekicks!).  His role as a janitor who suddenly begins to grow more  youthful is well acted.  At no time does his performance seem forced or  artificial.  His contribution is the only reason I forced myself to watch  through to the end.  For those who are actually looking for a movie with  plot, script and direction....my advice is to look elsewhere.",931305600,3,627,4.54054054054054

588788,2,6303159923,"When I feel that I wasted my time watching a movie, especially a Stephen King story, I have to review it.  This movie is just so bad, it leaves me sad and disillusioned. I could not believe that King could write such a poorly developed story but I understood more when I read the Wikipedia article on the production.  The movie began as a mini-series that was to lead into a regular series of weekly adventures. CBS nixed the regular series which left the mini-series with a cliff-hanger ending.  I was too quick to blame King for what might have been a decent presentation gone bad; it was actually CBS that ruined the movie.  A ridiculous ending was tacked on to the mini-series and the package wrapped up to place on a DVD. But, to be frank, there are few redeeming features in the movie. The CIA agent is stereotypically ruthless and the ""mad"" scientist goes beyond stereotype to ridiculousness. The acting is mediocre at best.  It is not King's best writing but all the blame can't land on his neck. CBS would seem to be culpable in this travesty.  My recommendation, leave it alone. It was ruined but never approached being a masterpiece.",1385251200,2,1144,4.583333333333333
588829,5,6303159923,"As far as I'm concerned Stephen King has his ups and downs, of course depending on your taste in stories.  I'm not one for blood and gore and things that come up out of the grave; Pet Cemetary, for example would rate a 1 on my list.  Golden Years, however, is a great story of intrigue and suspense and action with science fiction (as opposed to horror).  It is extremely well cast, well written and well acted.  For me, it was a lengthy film that I didn't want to end!  But end it did and quite surprisingly so.  I thoroughly enjoyed Golden Years and hope you will as well.

588837,4,6303159923,"I have watched this 20 year old movie/ mini series for the first time. The movie has a timeless SF theme, okay acting, and special effects that were B grade (green glowing stuff and a clock that runs backwards).

The theme is simple. A 70 year old janitor is accidentally exposed to ""stuff"" (biological agents?) during a government experiment that resulted in an explosion. He starts to slowly grow young. There are people who ""want"" him and to kill anyone who has come in contact with him, and those who want to save him. Felicity Huffman plays the sexy sultry security officer who reminds us of the X-Files Scully. Good guys on the run from the government SF movie.

The movie is very long but the plot somehow keeps us from getting too bored. Minor twists, minor humor.

No bad language, no sex, no nudity (bra and panties- thanks Felicity).",1312502400,,844,4.613333333333333

588903,5,6303159923,"Golden Years is one of Stephen Kings best works. It's the story of a simple nobody who has lived his life and is nearing retirement. He has an accident and suddenly things change. He starts to grow younger. Growing younger means a lot of change in his life, Stephen King explores those changes in this story. How does growing younger affect his marriage or relationship with his wife, what will others do to find out his secret to growing younger?  I just wish the story would have continued, as the ending left a lot to the imagination. I have found out there is more than one ending to this story.  I originally wrote this review in 2008, after six years still no edition with the alternate ending.  I would love to see the alternate ending as I am certain most of us would.  I have revised this review as of 6/14/2014.

588905,2,6303159923,"When this show first aired, it was my absolute favorite. I loved the sci-fi concept, the fugitive-style stay one step ahead story, and of course the titular David Bowie song.

The reason why I've given this dvd 2 stars is that the full story was never allowed to unfold. This is NOT a miniseries. This was a full-fledged television series, meant to play out over a number of seasons. The main character, Harlan, who ages backwards, was played by an actor in his mid-thirties. Had the show been kept on the air for two or three seasons, we would have seen him regress back to that age.

The slapped-together series finale was poorly handled, though really there was no good solution. The show was dependent on having multiple seasons, and no ending could have worked. Better to simply pass it by and remember the show for what it was: an intriguing television experiment that was not allowed to work.

I do think sometimes: In the modern age of cable channels putting out quality shows, wouldn't it be wonderful if a channel like Sci-Fi were to commit to three years of a Golden Years remake, and do it right this time?",1202342400,3,1118,4.58

This, however, is not it.  This piece is a butchered version of the original-- cut down to fit the media, I suspect.  It is better than nothing.... but not by a whole lot.

I wouldn't hold my breath for a full version; there's not enough interest in it.  My advice:  Buy it second-hand for a cheap price.",1147305600,5,419,4.434210526315789
588907,2,6303159923,"Of the two movies in this set The Langoliers was pretty mediocre but Stephen King's The Golden Years stands out as without doubt one of the worst movies I have ever seen! The plot is that an explosion in a secret laboratory sprays an old guard with unknown chemicals that begin to turn the man younger instead of older. As the government is interested in finding out more about this development, the guard is hunted across the country. The movie was so slow and uneventful that I fast-forwarded the last half hour hoping in vain for something to happen. The movie was so boring that there is no sign that Stephen King was involved in this. Please avoid at all costs unless you want to fall asleep!",1042416000,7,697,4.496062992125984

The first two hours on this DVD is great.  I think it was the two-hour premiere.  However, it goes downhill in the next two hours.  Things were taken out that made the plot confusing and even worse some thing were left in that did not make the story flow.  The last two hours are disjointed and for some reason goes away from the Protagonist.  We don't see him.
The ending had to be re-done because the original ending was a cliffhanger for the following season.  The ending totally reeks.  It is really, really bad.  You sit on your sofa for 4 hours and then it ends the way it did was he most disappointing of all.
