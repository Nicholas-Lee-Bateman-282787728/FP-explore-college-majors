8481231,5,B005OFI152,"I learned to speak Portuguese by watching Mazzaropi's movies on You-tube. At present, there are only a few left on there, so I decided to invest in one. Typically of Mazzaropi's films, this one combines the comedic with the touching. The film is extremely dated, with the clothing and home dcor of the late 60's-early 70's. That in itself is entertaining! In this film, the main character, separated from his twin in Portugal as a young child, has the chance to reunite with his brother, following the death of his own wife. He goes to Portugal and ""sees the world"", but finds that the pull of his granddaughter in Brazil is too strong and he decides to return to Brazil. Meanwhile, his son and family have come to realize that family is more important than appearances or money. Mazzaropi has a clear, slow Portuguese that is easy to understand. I didn't realize till I began to watch other Brazilian films, how plainly he speaks. It's a good place to start learning!",1433376000,,968,4.666666666666667
