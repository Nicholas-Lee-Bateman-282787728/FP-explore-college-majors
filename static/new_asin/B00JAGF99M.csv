8649448,2,B00JAGF99M,"Very predictable movie, have to agree with a previous reviewer in regards to wondering what the title Deadly Revenge has to do with anything.  It certainly is a title that attracts you to pick up the DVD, but has absolutely nothing to do with the movie.  No one is getting revenge in this film. They could have done the whole movie in the first fifteen minutes being it was so predictable than had a character get revenge for what's happened in the past, that would have made a much better movie.

This movie early on has a really dumb scene where the two main characters, get locked in a room in the office due to a sticky door which lets them hook up for events in the rest of the film.  This is the dumbest scenario.  What office building isn't required by law to have emergency exits.  What security guard doesn't respond to the phone on the security desk ringing.  That's kind of a key aspect of their job?  Anyway the two hook up, she decides to relocate to his city to be with him, but soon discovers the guy has a bit of a creepy thing going on with his mother from having a photo of her when she was young before he was born in a picture frame, to his mother having the same haircut as her.  These two give Norma and Norman Bates  a run for their money.  The movie might have worked better if this wasn't so obvious and there was some sort of mystery to another back story introduced after he goes on a business trip to Tokyo leaving her to look after his mother.

Really unless you really need to watch everything one of the actors from this is in, Deadly Revenge is one to give a miss.",1510963200,,1596,4.213815789473684

8649450,5,B00JAGF99M,"Deadly Revenge starring Donna Mills is a good scary film to watch. All stars do at least one of these in a long career, and I enjoyed it very much ! Donna still looks wonderful, and her career has lasted years. Fans of Donna Mills, and thriller lovers will like this the most.",1429401600,,276,4.226415094339623
8649451,3,B00JAGF99M,"Seriously predictable...I'm also not sure why the title is ""Deadly revenge"" because revenge has nothing to do with it?? but overall it was okay. Nothing spectacular and nothing horrible just pretty much okay. it is primarily a 3 person movie. the female lead is Alicia Ziegler and she is capable, the male lead is Mark Hapka who is appropriately handsome and is also very capable and then we have the unfortunate casting of Donna Mills as the guys Mom. She just never was much of an actress and isn't in this either.",1423872000,,516,4.619565217391305
8649452,4,B00JAGF99M,"The two youthful attractive stars of this movie, appropriately played by Alicia Ziegler and Mark Hapka (of Days of Our Lives fame), are more like star crossed lovers for the greater part of the film. As ""Cate"" and ""Harrison"", the two first meet by chance in a coffee shop. They both reach for the same cupcake. Harry (as Harrison is called) offers to divide it and does.  They then meet again when it happens that both are being employed (Cate temporarily) by the same architectural firm. Love begins to bloom between the two.  But there are some complications. Cate discovers that a previous love of Harry's, also named Cate, mysteriously and suddenly disappeared a couple of years earlier and was never seen again. (NB: This movie has an inordinate number of coincidences.)  That is a lingering problem. Cate is also introduced to Harry's widowed mother who lives in an opulent home with a swimming pool. Hello Donna Mills - that is who the mother is.  In case that name doesn't mean anything to some, Donna Mills played the part of a blonde bombshell and femme fatale on the long running evening soap opera Knot's Landing back in the 80s and 90s. She appears to be sweet and loving, perhaps too sweet and loving.  This is, after all, Donna Mills.  Without giving anything away, Cate begins to experience dizziness, vertigo, and general malaise.  What is causing this?  Is her new lover Harry responsible?  Is he doing something to Cate #2 that he possibly did to Cate #1?  How did Harry's father really die? Was it really an accident? A similar theme to the one found in this film has been done many times before.  One that comes to mind (The Naked Edge) had Gary Cooper and Deborah Kerr in it.  Another one could be Gaslight with Ingrid Bergman and Charles Boyer.  Be that as it may, this film is a good teaser if not a great mystery. And, in the end, it does have some very nice eye candy AND Donna Mills!",1421712000,,1910,4.5659824046920825
