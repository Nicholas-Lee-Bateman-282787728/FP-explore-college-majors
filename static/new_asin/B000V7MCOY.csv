8217115,5,B000V7MCOY,These are great well made videos full of Christian character and good moral lessons. Have bought several for my grandson he loves it!  If they are going to watch videos/tv this is great as it has a positive influence unlike most of the cartoons on television.,1373846400,,259,4.630434782608695
8217116,5,B000V7MCOY,"My son absolutely loves Auto-B-Good videos, but this one is his favorite. He loves the Cars movies and we love them too, but I know he's learning Biblical values with the Auto-B-Good videos.",1334620800,2,190,4.787878787878788
8217117,5,B000V7MCOY,"I had never heard of this show until a few months ago when I just happened to catch on TV. I have been thrilled by it ever since! Unlike many shows on TV these days, this show promotes not only ""good"" values but Godly ones. The show is entertaining, funny, and has a good moral basis. It's a bigger hit with the boys than the girls, but I've found everyone is willing to watch it because it's just a great show. It's good for the family looking for a fun, new show to watch with the kids that focuses on Godly storylines and morals.",1304812800,2,532,4.125
8217118,4,B000V7MCOY,"These videos were perfect for what our church was needing. We have a Children's Bible Hour during the sermon time and we needed a short video to be able to show once a month. These little movies are the perfect length (20 minutes each, except for bonus video) and had a good message. I liked the short music video at the end of each too. It sums up what the story was about. I plan on buying more of them. I think the cars will be a big hit with the kids too. My 1 year old liked them at least.",1291680000,2,494,3.900990099009901
