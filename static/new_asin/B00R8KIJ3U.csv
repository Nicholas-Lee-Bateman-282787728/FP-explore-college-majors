6908542,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"I happened to catch a small review of this little treasure in my  local paper, and seeing it was the kick-off to my birthday weekend. Turns out to have been a perfect present, and speaking as a ""Celtophile"" from since forever, I scarcely can contain my  enthusiasm for this film.  When people come together and get everything so just right about a project we all feel and benefit from it.  Moore's team has a rich pool of myth to dive into with the vast array of tales from the Irish tradition. I am loving how they draw that into a contemporary tale and allow us to see the relevance of myth in our lives today. Not just the selkies, but Mannanan macLir, the goddess Macha, and Finn's hunting hounds Bran and Sceolan all make appearances and have their human counterparts in the story. I loved the message of what  is magical in life really being what infuses our own with meaning and joy. I have to say, I am ordering the DVD, as this deserves more than one viewing for sure.  Not to be missed!",1424476800,5,996,4.356756756756757
6908543,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"Based on the legend of the Selkies, ""Song of the Sea"" is a visual feast of hand-drawn art in a feature-length animated film.  The story is sufficiently complex to engage adults, yet is focused on kids.  It's a true joy to watch, and very deserving of the Oscar for which it has been nominated. Buy it, view it, and save it to view again or share with your grand kids.",1423267200,,367,4.228571428571429
6908544,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"This is the first movie we took our 4.5 year old twins to see in a movie theater.  My husband and I are huge fans of Secret of Kells, but feel it is a little bit too violent for 4.5 year olds so we were very excited when Song of the Sea was released.  As we sat in the theater we were a little bit concerned that the material might be too dark for our children, but as soon as we left the theater they asked to see it again.

My husband and I found the film visually and thematically exquisite and one doesn't need an understanding or appreciation of Celtic mythology to love it.  The music is dreamy and the pace is a refreshing change from the overstimulating fare that abounds in our culture.  While we were watching the movie, all of us were swept away by it.  And, entertaining as it was, it also sparked meaningful discussions. A remarkable film.

Thank you Tomm Moore!",1423180800,148,875,4.234939759036145
6908545,4,B00R8KIJ3U,"One of the most beautiful things you'll ever see. Not just animated films, or films, but just in general. This is a work of art, and you could literally pause this film, at any second, screen capture that moment, and have something you could proudly hang up on your wall, or at the very least have as wallpaper on your computer. The sad truth is, the kids weren't as glued to the story and fi;m as much as I am. Otherwise I'd give it a full 5 stars. It's brilliant.",1422489600,33,465,4.177777777777778
6908546,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"We folk of the Emerald Isle don't get to watch a lot of children's entertainment from our own fair country. So when I learned that the folks behind the beguiling and utterly beautiful The Secret of Kells were making The Song of the Sea, a magical fairy tale steeped in Irish folklore and mythology...I knew I had to see it as soon as possible. I was not disappointed! The Song of the Sea is a magical, poetic, moving, and beautiful little tale that will entrance children without talking down to them. The visuals are stylized and rich, and just plain beautiful. More importantly, Song of the Sea has got a big heart and lots of charm.

The story goes like this: Ben and Saoirse (said seer-sha) live in a lighthouse with their father Conor. One night, Saoirse is taken into the ocean by seals, where it's revealed she's a selkie: a magical being that takes the form of a seal in the sea. When Ben and Saoirse are sent to live with their grandmother in the city, they must step up to face their inner fears and complete a task to keep the magic stories alive.

I recommend this magical film to kids and adults alike. Come and share in the wonders of Ireland.
As they say in Gaelic, go raibh mle maith agat!",1422316800,412,1205,4.375
6908547,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"Song of the Sea is probably the most magical animated movie I've ever seen.  Based on the Irish legend of the selkie (girl who turns into a seal), the artists have created not only a quest story but also glorious visual moments.  Older brother Ben becomes involved in a quest to save his little sister for whom he's felt nothing but jealousy or annoyance so far during their lives.  In their journey he becomes heroic by protecting, saving, risking his life and eventually loving her. Most inspiring are the animated water-color scenes, mystical figures from Irish mythology, toe-tapping music and a moving story.  Don't miss it.",1422144000,62,629,4.90566037735849

6908572,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"A tale for all ages about family, loss, unintended consequences, love and redemption. Several cultures have legends about the Selkie, but this is firmly about the Celtic folklore of selkies, fairies, trolls, witches and owls. It is a gorgeous movie of what appears to be hand-drawn animation rather than CGI.

The film focuses on a family that has been torn apart by the death/disappearance of the mother. Their grandmother takes them to the city, away from their lighthouse-keeper father.  Bringing the family together is the plot of the film and it is the two children who battle the forces of Macha to return to their father.  Macha, also known as the Owl Witch in this story, aims to remove feelings from all humans so they feel no pain or sorrow.  As she drains them of their feelings, they turn to stone.  Breaking that spell allows the characters to fully experience life, not just joy and laughter but also  sorrow and pain, for all are essential to appreciating our life and helping us choose our path in it.",1529712000,,1017,4.7175141242937855

6908606,4,B00R8KIJ3U,"Like Tomm Moore's The Secret of Kells, this is another animated movie involving Irish history and folklore. This one is about selkies, which are humans that must transform into seals at a certain age. Like The Secret of Roan Inish, another movie about selkies, this one is also about a family thrown into disarray when a selkie mother is forced to leave her human family, but it tells a much different story. While Roan Inish is more of a mystery, Song of the Sea is an adventure, and a beautiful, whimsical and sometimes heart-wrenching one at that. It uses the same medieval illustration style found in The Secret of Kells, but it looks even better and is even more magical here, and even though it's a strictly Irish story, it takes cues from Miyazaki's fantasy adventures such as My Neighbor Totoro and Spirited Away. Not to take away from Moore's unique approaches to animation and storytelling, but if you're a Miyazaki fan who is in the mood for something similar, Song of the Sea will satisfy your craving.",1522281600,,1014,4.702247191011236

6908644,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"I love this movie. I watched it with my family (we love all the films made by Cartoon Saloon, including the Secret of Kells and The Breadwinner) and I was not disappointed. The fluid 2D animation is stunning, the music enchanting and trance-like, and the acting on point. 2D animation is so rare these days, as is a good theatrically animated story (apart from whenever Disney wants to be original and not churn out a sequel) and the story in this film is so ENGAGING! I could not look away.  The only problem with the video was the quality of the picture (Amazon Video's fault) and the fact that it LOADS EVERY 2-5 MINUTES. I've seen people giving this movie one star. They say it was ""too slow in the beginning"" so they didn't bother to watch the whole thing (which if they had stayed long enough they would quickly change their mind) or they said it was ""too scary for the kiddos"" which, honestly, don't just assume that because something is animated it will be all mindless blabber like Illumination Films. They tell you under the rating why it is PG. It has some thematic and scary elements. Watch the movie by your self before showing it to your kids.  There is actually a conflict and something at stake in this movie, and if your kid cannot get past the beginning, maybe consider their age to be a factor. Overall, I loved this movie. I recommend it to anyone mature enough to understand it's complexity. Watch it.",1521331200,,1422,4.507751937984496

I wasn't sure what to expect going into this movie, but what I got was beautifully animated, well written, well acted, and touching, with some lovely music on top of it all. Also, they seem to have drawn from authentic Irish folklore for many of the characters, and if so, that would make this movie an interesting window into a rather under-served area of mythology. Maybe this film will inspire people to learn more about the giant and the owl witch and the selkies and the fellow with all the hair. I also liked that the dog's name is Cu, which is Gaelic for ""dog"" or ""hound"".
Honestly, I can't think of anything I'd change about this. I wish there could be a short film about how the father and mother met, given what we learn about them, but you can't have everything; where would you put it all?",1517270400,,849,4.345911949685535

6908813,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"This movie is an eclectic masterpiece of audio/visual art, appropriate for all ages. I'm a 26y/o male, and it tears at my soul in a way that I can't describe. It shows the nature of children, and our angelic intentions to explore the world around us, without taking understanding for granted. It's very touching, and an emotional Rollercoaster. I've seen many Miyazaki films and many animated movies, but the song of the sea has a special magic that I will treasure for years to come, easily one of my favorite movies /artistic experiences to enjoy, telling the tale of an older brother struggling to be what he thinks is the model he should be, for his younger mute (won't speak) sister, as she is compelled to change her life, but cannot express how she feels, or why, the brother slowly realizes their intimate and delicate family connection shared, and becomes a better and more compassionate person. A mesmerizing adventure, and the music is very inspiring as well.

In short, this movie is ""angelic and full of wonders""",1502496000,2,1025,4.790960451977401

6908815,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"This is one of the best movies I've seen in awhile, whether aimed at children or adults. If you love mythology and legends, then this movie will have a lot for you, but even if you don't, there's still a wonderful story and beautiful art. All of my children love it, over an age spread of seventeen down to four years old. It can be hard for us to find something to suit everyone, but this was one movie that did. I was concerned as a parent on viewing it initially, that the brother is incredibly mean to his little sister. If you are a parent, you probably have some of this going on in your house anyhow, and you surely don't want to promote it. However, I was glad to see that the older brother comes to understand the error of his ways. Personally, I don't mind the family viewing behavior in films that is incorrect, as long as the behavior is shown to be incorrect. All of the characters are flawed, and their flaws hurt other characters, but I suppose I'd rather have this portrayed (it is realistic, in life, this really happens) than to have a story where some or all the characters are either completely evil, or almost completely without flaws. Stories can help us see and cope with our own failings if they mirror real life in an honest way. This story does that, setting the very believable characters into a context of legendary and magical events. Something I especially liked was that many plants were represented in a way that is botanically correct! That level of attention to detail was echoed throughout the film. Like The Secret of Kells, it is truly visually and artistically masterful. I would say that everyone should view this movie, and share it with others to enjoy as well. It really has something for everyone.",1502150400,,1740,4.5094936708860756

The wonderful thing about this film is that it shows the suffering of children after the loss of a parent, and the sort of sadness and resentment that follows. It's also very educational in Irish folklore, which is wonderful if you aren't familiar with it. The artwork is masterful, and the storyline is great, and I and my friends all cried at the ending.

6909234,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"The art style is different from the vast majority of animated shows I watch so it took a couple minutes of getting used to. Once that was out of the way it really drew me in with how well the story was told and how well the animations weren't just there to look at, they ADDED to the story. On top of this was the music which I loved. This is a perfect example of how your animated movie does not need to have the best possible CGI, as an animated drawing style can work just as good when the story and music help it along.",1486512000,,523,3.943396226415094

6909248,4,B00R8KIJ3U,"This is a beautiful animation of a story based on the Irish selkie myths such as ""The Seal Mother"". Parts of it are a little emotionally intense for young children. I watched it with my granddaughters. It helped to talk them thru those parts, and the story resolved to their satisfaction. The music was lovely and the background illustrations are moving watercolors with rich details. I have seen it a couple of times and would see it again.

It leaves you, and the kids, feeling contemplative, relaxed and at peace, upon watching.  We need more films like this and by director Hayao Miyazaki.  In fact, I see many similarities between this and Miyazaki's films, such as the artful use of silence (in comparison, Disney films seem obnoxiously loud) and the connection to the spiritual world.

6910197,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"If you are a member or a descendant of the northern seafaring folk of Ireland, Scotland, and the Scandinavian countries, you may know what a selkie is. Or if you're a fan  of folk music, you may know about the tragic ballad, The Great Selkie of Sule Skerry.
 If not , Ill explain that a selkie is what could be called a shape-shifter. On the land, he or she has human form; in the sea it becomes a seal. The selkies are beautiful and seductive creatures who mate with humans and produce offspring. But in some tales they must eventually return to the sea as seals.
 ""The Song of the Sea"" is about two selkies, a mother and her daughter who knows nothing about her heritage. The mother returns to the sea while the daughter is still an infant, and we flash forward five or six years to find the daughter and her older brother taken from their seaside home by their paternal grandmother to live in the city. The balance of the story finds them struggling to return to their home and their father, and to protect the world of mythology.
 Their adventures provide the conflict and suspense of a good story, and the underlying knowledge that the daughter is a selkie provides mystery.
 But to my mind, the greatest attraction of this little movie is the beautiful artwork throughout. We have a controlling visual theme that unites the scenes into a consistent and solid work of art. As an old geezer with inadequate hearing I often missed what the children were saying, but the action and the art more than made up for the lack of subtitles. Next time I watch it Ill wear my hearing aids. And I will watch it again. Several times.",1484524800,6,1625,4.457912457912458

But when Ben's little sister Saoirse (Seersha) plays the shell flute their mother left them and releases a long held magic, the two youngsters begin a journey that will lead them home in more than one way. Ben will have to call on his memory of the fairy tales and songs his mother taught him to save his sister and set right the wrongs among the fairies. Along the way he'll have to repair his relationship with Saoirse and learn the truth about his much mourned mother.

I found it when my son was about 6 months old and it's been a lifesaver ever since. The music and animation are so calming and soothing. He would wake up in the middle of the night crying and when I would put this on he'd be asleep in minutes.,1484265600,,341,4.181818181818182

6910393,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"A funny, sweet, and heartbreaking movie about family that draws on Irish folklore but is at the same time utterly modern in its sensibilities. The visual style is very simple, almost stylized, against the backdrop of a very rich story in which mythical and real-world characters are trapped in the unintended consequences of decisions made with the best of intentions. This is not a movie for very small children; the child protagonists do face dangers and separation from their father, the story begins with the implied death of the mother in childbirth, and the nuances of the family dynamics may be lost on very young viewers. Despite this, my 8- and 11-year-olds have returned to the movie for its non-patronizing portrayal of children, myth-laden story, and quirky dialogue and characterization again and again (and we still laugh and cry every time).",1484092800,,856,5.078014184397163

6911701,4,B00R8KIJ3U,"Almost as magical as The Secret of Kells.  But in this offering some of the charm is missing.  The story features a bully older brother named Ben who treats his mute sister Saoirse abominably.  Dear old dad is distant and distraught ever since his wife, their mother, disappeared into the sea.  He decides to send them to the city to live with their formidable Granny who is a tyrant.  But the faerie folk have a kinship with Saoirse and the witch Macha wants her for reasons unreasonable.  This requires an abrupt change in Ben as he fights to protect and save his little sister from forces he doesnt fully understand.

The hand drawn backgrounds are exquisite, the character artwork less so.  The story is a bit of a downer as it deals with grief and the seduction of losing ones sorrow, becoming numb in order to survive it.  For the witch Macha this means turning people to stone to take away their pain.  In this, she thinks she is doing them a favor.

I am very disappointed after watching this movie with my two kids they both started crying and my boy was upset for days at the thought of his mom just leaving him and throwing herself into the sea.  Not a good story line in any way for the age group watching this stuff.  The school called and said they were concerned about my son.  He is a well rounded good kid with a great personality and no worries.  He asked multiple times if his mom was ok and kept asking them if she was picking him up and if they were very sure of it(because he kept thinking ""what if"").  I know what they tried to do in the movie and I respect neat art in kids movies.  But it was disturbing on multiple subjects.  I don't really write reviews but I felt strongly enough about this that I thought I should put on my 2 cents against all the positive reviews this thing got.",1477526400,8,859,4.132530120481928

6912396,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"Great and artistic story.  A little dark and complex, not like Disney fluff at all.  My almost 4 year old daughter and I watched it curled up together--she is ""artistically sensitive"" and started to watch it alone another time but found it too scary.  I'm pretty sure it's the darker hued colors and slower pace, etc. that evoked the feelings in her.  She's a child that will hide behind curtains or what have you when emotive classical music is playing because it touches her and she needs help processing so perhaps others will feel differently. Anyway, very good but I'd be prepared to discuss the complexity with the little ones :).",1477526400,,636,4.702702702702703

There definitely are at least a couple scenes in there that make me want to cry. This movie is my favorite movie to watch once in a while when it's the end of the day, I've nothing else to do, and I just want to relax. Also, props for Irish culture!

I got it because of all the good reviews and didn't have time to watch it before we went on a trip, which was for when I had hoped my four-year old would enjoy watching it. It is the first time I do this, it was just because of massive pressure of time. So after 10 minutes of watching it my daughter says, ""mumy, I don't want to watch this anymore, this little girl's brother is nasty to her..."" I pulled over and put an old and trusted Curious George on and later that night flipped through it and can only say that it all looked dark and scary. I would NOT recommend you getting this for a 4-year old, unless you want them to have nightmares!",1474848000,,659,4.076923076923077

6913264,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"My favorite kid's movie. So refreshing to watch a compelling movie that doesn't rely on sexist, classist tropes. I also love that the ending is complex; the story lines are resolved yet not in an artificial way. The characters have competing needs and the viewer is left to ponder that life is beautiful but not perfect. Heads up: for sensitive kiddos, there are a few tense/scary parts. No blood or violence, but there are some slightly spooky bits and a climax where there main characters face another character with magical powers.",1474848000,,534,4.8791208791208796

I'm so glad I did, though, because this movie is seriously gorgeous. The animation style and music are beautiful and haunting all at once. The story is deep, but it had an old school fairy tale style that so many movies are lacking these days. The ending had me sobbing like a baby, though, so if you're a crier (which, come on, you're probably a mom so you probably are, haha) be prepared for that. Oh, and if you're sitting there wondering why the dad's voice sounds so darn familiar it's because he's Mad Eye Moody in Harry Potter!
Overall, I love this movie. I've made my kids watch it again multiple times and my husband has even been roped into the affair. I can totally understand why this has been nominated for so many awards.",1474848000,4,909,4.290697674418604

6913661,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"The first time I watched this movie with my two children (3 and 7), I thought it might have been too slow paced and the concepts would go over their heads. However, they loved it. My children hardly sit still, normally, but for this movie that sat engulfed in each scene.

The animation is beautiful, it reminded me of an old children's book come to life. The colors are not as bright as a Disney movie but it did seem to have this calming effect. Each scene had its own magical essence to it. As an artist, I, myself, enjoyed the stylized animation.

The story admittedly is much slower pace than the animated movies from the US, but depending on the child, it is still very entertaining. Some concepts may not be understood by some children, but my children did seem to understand the main storyline. Afterward, my 3-year-old kept asking if my hair will turn white and if I will turn into a seal.

This was a bueatifully done movie with a wonderful story.",1474156800,3,957,4.457142857142857

It's a very cute movie that I watched multiple times in Amazon videos and had to buy the DVD.

6913957,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"A contender for greatest film of all time. Look at the negative reviews. You will notice the one complaint is that their kids didn't like it. I admit that this movie is not primarily for kids. It is primarily for adults. Some mature or intelligent kids will be able to appreciate it's greatness. But you shouldn't expect this to be in the same category as, say, Pixar's Planes. It's not a babysitting movie. It's not a song and dance movie. It's a heavy and beautiful movie about death and loss and pain and coping with that pain, overcoming it, and finding happiness again. Also, selkies.",1473120000,,589,4.619047619047619

Nice graphics and content; a softer presentation compared to many.  She's was not singing ""Let It Go"" and asking for immediate replay.  But she will watch it again later and, sometimes as important, I think her older siblings (10 and 11) will watch with her.  So a good movie and would recommend.",1472947200,,470,4.5476190476190474

The end is heart wrenching and I always cry. My daughter asks to watch ""Saoirse"" again once it ends. I can only hope they make some more Irish fairy tales come to life over and over again!

6915243,4,B00R8KIJ3U,"The movie was very engaging and thoroughly enjoyable. If I had to come up with a complaint it would be that the main storyline is slightly predictable, but there are enough little twists and turns to keep it from becoming anywhere near boring at any time.

Even our three year old stayed pretty much engaged the entire time and was never scared or upset by anything that he saw, on the contrary he had some big eyes during a lot of the magical scenes. It was wonderful to see!",1469145600,,476,4.348314606741573

Along the way he is reminded just what it is supposed to mean to be a big brother, something that he has since forgotten since a tragic loss in his life.  If you like any Studio Ghibli film or any film that gives you the feeling that you just watched a good purposeful film, then Song of the Sea won't disappoint you.  The artwork is great, and the film keeps you at the edge of your seat near the end.  Really loved it!

It's chillingly beautiful, with a magical message that is subtle enough my kids (6 and 9) didn't catch it until the 8th (or so) time they watched this movie. We're not usually a re-watching movie sort of family, but I could watch this regularly. I've looked for a place to purchase the stills, with little luck. I did find the production company's website, (Gkids.com) and see there are other movies that promise to be as unique and beautiful as this one.

It is full of magic and includes all sorts of magical creatures ( fairies, witches, giants and selkies) so if that makes you uncomfortable you may want to think twice, but I would encourage you to push through as the themes of joy and heartache, family and the importance of living into our gifts are well worth the journey.",1468627200,,445,4.506172839506172

This had a similar artistic style (which I love) rooted in a similar Celtic theme - though ""Song of the Sea"" is set in modern time.

6915703,5,B00R8KIJ3U,My 2 year old loves it and sings the main sing in Irish. It's a great tale but there are some dark aspects that may upset a sensitive child. The mother dies but so does the mother in most Disney stories and there is a witch called Macha but the underlying story about not bottling up your feelings is a good one and the animation and music are beautiful - one you can enjoy as well as the children.,1467849600,,398,4.050632911392405

6915785,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"I loved the ethereal, dream like aesthetic that complements the children's socio-emotional  journey.  Concepts are hinted at through colors patterns and song, which beautifully characterizes the changes that shape the experiences that children overcome throughout childhood. It is such a sobering tale of siblings emerging from their own egocentric perspectives of their existence and coming to see themselves within the context of their broader reality. The mystical elements of the story remind us all that there are things beyond our control that shapes who we are, and accepting this will help us to appreciate the magic that life inherently is!",1467590400,,649,5.48

Not sure who this movie is made for. If its for kids it would not hold their attention, if its for adults then its to predictable.",1466380800,,428,4.011764705882353

It's truly mesmerizing, richly beautiful, a story with deep mythological roots and near-perfect execution.  The story line is deep enough for any adult, yet it is presented in such a way that my 5-year-old can't stop watching it.  The music is brilliant and memorable, and it presents so many meaningful life lessons that my daughter and I often talk about elements of the movie and their connection with real life.

This movie is very unique and very entertaining to watch. It seems to be an Irish fable, with Gaelic songs and Irish imagery. It's the story of a young couple with their young son. The mother is very pregnant and sharing stories, songs and gifts with him. Suddenly, the story jumps ahead several years where the family has drastically changed. The mother is gone, the little boy is now around 9 and his sister, the spitting image of her mother, is about 6. The father is in a great state of grief which initiates his mother visiting and taking the children to live with her for their safety. This is where the story follows the 2 children on a magical adventure to find the truth of their family while trying to get back to their home. The story is very unique and very well told.

It sparked several conversations in our house.

***Spoilers below***

It is implied that the mom dies at the beginning. She makes a reappearance (she's a selkie), but does not stay with her husband and children at end of the story (make your own conclusions: is she really dead? Does she have to remain a selkie?)

I liked ""The Secret of Kells"". I am enchanted by ""Song of the Sea"". There is little armed warfare in ""Song"" (none, if beaks are not considered weapons), so small children may find the story less scary. There are beautiful blended colors and some lilting Irish music; there are panoramic visions of the land and magical undersea views. A few references are made to the films of Miyazaki, appropriately, but this animated story is a most original rendering of the ancient Celtic myth of the selkie.",1464825600,,657,4.823008849557522

The art style is refreshingly different and there is so much character development, despite the fact that the movie is only about an hour and a half long. It is family friendly, even though I don't think children would understand the main point of the movie as well as older people would.

My 6-year-old watched it without me, she's a bit sensitive to ""scary"" things - dark lighting, ominous music, lots of suspense, and this didn't bother her. It did make her cry at the end.

The attention to character detail infuses life into the movie. The background art deserves a gallery exhibit of its own.

It's basically everything that Ponyo (directed by Miyazaki) should have been, and wasn't - and more beautifully animated. It isn't quite as strong a story as Secret of Kells, partially because it isn't based on true history, but what it lacks in story, it more than makes up for with the sheer joy of beautiful drawings, the kind that make you gasp and pause the movie so you can admire the picture. Well worth the watch, and I'll be returning many times to this gem of a movie.",1463616000,,578,4.514285714285714

6918232,5,B00R8KIJ3U,My daughter (3) and I. Loved this movie. There were some intense moments that i thought would scare her but for the most part she seemed fine with them might be too intense for some younger viewers though.

6918397,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"It is amazing how much this movie does with classic animation techniques. The whole film is medicine for the eyes. As if the excellent animation and story line weren't enough, the music is sublime, setting a mood of Celtic mysticism in a classic Irish/Scottish story of the magic interplay of human and selkie. The complex portrayals of Saoirse (the half human, half selkie) and her brother Ben go beyond the usual representation of children in animated movies.

She gasped at certain dramatic points, and her eyes were glued to the screen the entire time. She would point and ask about certain things, clearly involved in the story. Once the movie was over, she asked to see it again immediately. As for me, I cried like a baby at the ending. It is a beautifully crafted movie that has an awful lot of heart.

6918703,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"From the very talented group behind Secret of Kells, The Breadwinner, Anam an Amhrain, and Puffin Rock (Cartoon Saloon), Song of the Sea is a wistful and decidedly mythical tale about two siblings embarking on a journey filled - just below the surface - with legends, magic, and mystery. The movie is quiet and earnest, and more of the story is told through looks and lack of dialogue than most children's films, which is a pleasant refrain from the norm. Parents and children alike will enjoy the larger-than-life symbology that the film deftly maneuvers.

The art style is beautiful and the fluid animation is wonderful to behold, and both translate nicely to quiet, still scenes and action packed encounters. Each scene is filled to burst with detail but it's never pointed out, allowing the viewer to steep in a world that feels very much a real place, even while we watch faeries turn to stone. In the end, the movie is about loss and overcoming it, and how far we're willing to go for the ones that we love. I whole-heartily recommend this to anyone.",1461801600,,1056,4.708108108108108

I was very impressed with the consistency od the forms in this film, as well as the atmospheric quality of the animation. The artwork is beautiful, imaginative, spot on.  The characterizations are also perfect; the older brother, Ben, is a nearly perfect study of an exasperated older sibling.  The Celtic mythology is fun and tells a touching tale. Only small knitpick is that the tale gets a bit confusing towards the end; there are many threads to tie up.

6919441,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"i don't particularly know much about irish culture and folklore, so i can't speak to the adherence of any fairy tales or bedtime stories, but man this is a good one.
the story opens with a very unique style of animation, and i thought, ""okay, this looks good. it's probably a flashback or something and we'll just jump into cgi after one of the parents dies and they're set on their quest."" well, i was only half right. one of the parents does die, but the animation stays the same. it's very refreshing to see an animated film that's hand-drawn, or at least sticks with the style. it's gorgeous to look at. in a way it resembles something like what a talented child might illustrate, trying to recall a faint dream or a whimsical fantasy. it's a touch of the daydreams of bridge to terabithia and a bit of ponyo.
for a kid's story, it's simple enough, but man does it do it well. it seeks to meld a mythical world with the parallels of modern day correlations, as though it's a child interpreting events around them. and the music is as creative and just as whimsical as the animation. it's like coraline but not as creepy.
this is definitely worth a watch, not just children but children of all ages.",1459987200,,1202,4.4434389140271495

6921103,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"I can't express enough how much I love this movie. The kids love it as well, but I think I may love it more. Other reviews talk of what it's about, a selkie girl and a journey her brother takes her on to help her become who she is and keep alive the magic of the stories they grew up with. But there's such emotion in this movie that cannot truly be captured with words. The family is torn apart when they lose their mother, and with their fathers grief, the children are left to fend for themselves. The kids are sent to live with their grandmother and only when trying to run away home, does the adventure start for them. The beginning shows a grieving, almost neglectful father, a little boy who's angry at the world and his sister. And a little girl who's desperate for love and the acceptance of her brother. As the story goes on, the boy becomes less angry, less resentful, and more loving toward his sister. He begins to understand that nothing that happened in their lives was ever her fault, and becomes her leader, her protector and her support system. Characters in the movie mirror each other. The grieving giant turned to stone mirrors their father, and the owl witch mirrors their grandmother, only trying to help but hurting everyone in the process. It ends in a happy way for all, and God bless you if you don't shed a tear.",1456185600,19,1340,4.407258064516129
6921104,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"Song of the Sea is a G-rated animated fantasy based on an Irish myth, but don't let the G-rating or the fantasy descriptives fool you into thinking the movie doesn't deal with real drama and real life emotions. Unlike so many other G-rated kids' fantasies, particularly the ones that come out of Hollywood -- and, believe me, I do like those, some of them quite a bit (Robots, Wall-E, etc) -- Song of the Sea doesn't fall back on cliches or formulae. It isn't afraid to get deeper into a kid's head. While the delivery vehicle is one of Earth-bound spirits and their savior child born to one of their own, the story follows a path of loss, fear, misdirected anger, despair, illness, and, ultimately, understanding, sacrifice and heroics.

I watched this with my eight year old granddaughter, and she was mesmerized. After the movie, we had a chance to talk about how one deals with being sad. Pretty heavy stuff for an eight year old, but the movie made the conversation easier.

Technically, the movie is beautiful. It's artful and visually inventive. It looks hand drawn.

The movie has some very sad and anxiety-producing undertones. However, it's mostly this incredible adventure that this little girl and her older brother find themselves on; it's an adventure made more exciting by the real-life consequences of failing to succeed.

There's an old meme in filmmaking. ""What's the character's motivation?"" Producers, directors, writers, actors, will ask this question from time to time. It's so cliche it's become kind of a joke. However, it's the mark of a good script when the characters within are clearly defined by what they want.

In Song of the Sea, every character is clearly defined by what they want or need. Their motives are clear, and even more interesting, they're very different.

5-Stars. Highly Recommended.",1456185600,39,1829,4.941368078175896

Oh. My. Glob.

I can not say how wrong I was. My wife and I are both part Irish and she is huge on the Selkie and Irish folklore in general so when we sat down to watch this, she was a bit more enthusiastic than I. Even as the movie starts it's drawing you in with the charming, no muss no fuss artwork that is both comforting, and calming as you are taken through worlds of color and somber tones. The Music is Celtic and so stirringly beautiful that it moves you through various parts of the movie so that each scene is perfect.

Over all? I can not recommend this movie enough. Five stars is not high enough rating for the wonderful masterpiece this movie is. Please don't pass this up like we did for a while, truly, it's one of our favorites now.",1454716800,,874,4.159763313609467

6921620,5,B00R8KIJ3U,I couldn't fall asleep one night and decided to give this movie a try since it had good ratings on Amazon Video.  I was bawling throughout the movie!  I knew my kids would love it and they sure did.  My 6-year old son likes to sing the little girls song around the house and my 3-year old daughter frequently requests this movie.  The movie caught my attention in the beginning by its beautiful imagery.  It is a slower paced movie in the beginning but the imagery and cuteness of the little girl keep you engaged.  Great story about family and yes it has its sad moments but my little ones enjoy it.,1453507200,,600,4.3125

I love folklore and fairytales in general, but there is something about Irish folklore that is even more intriguing- especially when it comes to the mysterious sea. There are no plot holes; everything flows wonderfully. I loved Tom Moore's other film, The Secret of Kells, but I personally enjoy this one even more.

It's a rich story with emotional intelligence that we really appreciate.

6921781,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"This may be the most beautiful animated film ever made. Yes there are many that could rival it, and you could make a strong argument for Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Beauty and the Beast, Finding Nemo, and of course, virtually every Studio Ghibli film ever made. And I place particular emphasis on that last comparison because Spirited Away changed how I viewed animated films, introducing me to Hayao Miyazaki and being the one animated film I truly became obsessed with. It was the music and the colors and the fantastical story and the larger-than-life characters all set to a highly stylized vision that immersed me in Japanese culture. SONG OF THE SEA is all of this for Irish culture, and perhaps more. It's warmer and more professional than director Tomm Moore's debut film, The Secret of Kells, and takes his Celtic-based visuals to a new level. They're so stunning they are nothing short of brilliant; a true work of art. I can count on one hand how many times a film has made me cry, and the final scene left me weeping. It was the culmination of having seen and heard and felt such a complete masterpiece. Even as Studio Ghibli looks to close with Miyazaki's retirement, Moore's studio Cartoon Saloon is brighter than the sun.",1451347200,,1237,4.731481481481482

My five year old son and I loved it.  And he gets pretty scared by a lot of ""bad guys"" in other ""kids"" movies, but this didn't have anything for him to be scared of.  The music is great as well.",1451347200,,340,4.435483870967742
6921783,5,B00R8KIJ3U,This movie was simply spectacular. Mythical. Emotionally deep. The story of two Irish children living in an isolated -- though idyllic -- light house on the coast.

I have not watched a movie in many years--am so glad I broke my ""fast"" with something this exquisite.  Also the layered messages struck home for me--the ways in which so many of us have had our true nature taken from us or have tried to dull the pain by becoming hard.  This film works to put one back in touch with that which is lost or numb.  My thanks to the makers of it.",1450915200,,480,3.96875

The story takes me back to childhood fairy tales and myths: the message of love, simple yet powerful; the grand adventure, perilous yet magical; the bitter-sweet finale, makes you laugh and makes you cry.

The visuals are appropriately stunning, the sound and music is top notch (the songs are very catchy, and I do recommend sitting through the credits to hear both of the titular songs), the story is sweet and well-wrapped up.

6921800,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"A gorgeous film, with lovely music and evocative drawings. Tells a story of sibling relations and complex family dynamics against the backdrop of the Irish legend of the selkie that is highly accessible to children but does not pander to them. The film has beautifully rendered landscapes and oceanscapes, as well as brief but incisive visual commentary on the stifling alienation of urban life. In many ways, the plot is similar to the much-heralded, but far less interesting ""Inside Out"" -- both films revolve around children dealing with difficult emotions and the importance of acknowledging fear, anger, and sorrow.  Compared to ""Song of the Sea,"" however, the colors and graphics of ""Inside Out"" are garish and facile, and the story is low-stakes and uncompelling.  ""Song of the Sea,"" by contrast, has real moments of anxiety, relief, and beauty, as well as intriguing characters and subtle environmental commentary. The creators of ""Song of the Sea"" also made ""The Secret of Kells,"" which my kids and I also love and highly recommend.",1450483200,2,1041,5.117647058823529

Granted, she probably has a little bit of a longer attention span than some her age, but, it's now been requested by her, and watched, at least 30 more times, and it's only been a month or so.  Maybe 5 weeks?  And as an adult who grew up with hand-drawn Disney stuff and the subsequent 3D/CGI movies over the last ~15 years, this movie is one of the best I've seen in AGES, both for the story and the animation/beauty.  It's fantastic.  I've watched it at least 8 times and even listen to the main theme song on a regular basis, and got it on a usb drive for my daughter to listen.  She frequently says ""Song Sea"" as soon as we get in the car.  I'm just saying, this movie is amazing.  It has some dark tones to it.  There are some heavy subjects, but, it's super all around.

It is a great story about our lives.  About our needs, and dependence and the meaning that emotions give to our lives. We are beautiful creations because of our emotions, loves, personalities.
With two children that both are enamored by the film I love the lessons.  I have the older son and younger daughter. I hope they love each other.
I hope that the full circle of this film in its love, tragedy, loss, hope, searching, and finding, can embody life.
While I think they are all stories from the bible, I know other cultures have the same.
So, while this can be a great move, with awesome sound tracks that your kids and you will enjoy, it opens conversation with families about life, and that is great.",1449100800,,781,4.416666666666667

""Song of the Sea"" justly deserves the Oscar for Best Feature Length Animation. Wonderful use of Celtic motifs. The film is fluid. Dreamy. Haunting. Perhaps one of the best pieces of animation in a long while. Your family will enjoy it.",1448582400,,375,5.163934426229508

When the children are sent inland to stay with their grandmother, a little girl needs the help of her brother to return her to the sea if she is to live.

My only problem with this animated film is that one of the animators seems to have enjoyed writing vulgar terms on items throughout the film. How unfortunate! Otherwise, I would have given this five stars.",1448064000,,769,4.370629370629371

6922107,1,B00R8KIJ3U,"The art was beautiful. I really wanted to like this movie. And I would have liked it if the writers had taken time to make the plot make sense. But no. They didn't. If Ben's mom was a selkie and a selkie needed to sing the magic selkie song to free all of the magical creatures, why didn't Ben's mom sing the song to begin with? And speaking of the mom, why did she have to leave her children? The movie never tells us. And then she just shows back up after years and is going to take her daughter and she doesn't say anything to her son and husband until they say, ""Please don't take her, she's all we've got."" (Um, you have each other.) I think they would have said, ""Why did you leave us?"" She tells them she has to leave today, but again, we're given no explanation as to why all the magical creatures have to leave. What a great message for children. Sometimes your parents just leave you for no reason.

Also, why wasn't Ben half selkie since his mom was a selkie? Are only girls selkies? Do you have to be born in the water to be a selkie? Either of these explanations might be a part of selkie mythology, but the writers shouldn't just assume the audience is going to know these details. Ben never asks these questions and the movie doesn't explain.

Why didn't Ben's sister speak until the climax of the movie? Again we don't know.

And then there's the grandmother. She takes the children so they'll be safer, sends them to their room in the middle of the day and then apparently doesn't check on them again. She wakes up that night and, again for no apparent reason says, ""The children are gone!"" Well, maybe she would have realized this earlier if she'd checked on them before she went to bed.

It wouldn't have taken much time for the writers to throw in some explanations to these issues, but they didn't.",1448064000,11,1819,4.325513196480938

6922132,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"This is a fabulous film.  If anything, it is stronger than Moore's _Secret of Kells_.  That may be an unfair comparison because each film is directed at, and accomplishes different things.  With_Song of the Sea_ you get jaw-dropping, beautiful animation (especially the backgrounds and sets), you get witty dialogue, mystery, and ultimately something very deep.  The modern translation of traditional Irish folk culture is impeccable.  The captured sense of childhood (a strength shared with _Kells_) should be an object lesson to every parent--think hard and remember the depth of passion, the vision, and the powerful love that defined your childhood worldview.  Remember it and honor it in your own kids.  Watch this, whether you have kids or not.  In the end, it is a beautiful and fanciful exploration of how mythology unlocks deeply true things about being human.",1447804800,,869,5.246376811594203

I gave the movie three stars because the pace of the film was quite slow at times, which did not add to the plot in any way. Also there was a lot of missed opportunities to flesh out some of the locations and characters. Overall a really enjoyable movie for the whole family.",1447632000,,406,4.151898734177215

While the themes are a bit overwhelming for my 3- and 6-year-old, I cannot say enough good about this incredible movie. It is a movie I will absolutely watch again. The animation is the best I have seen, the story is enchanting and heartfelt, and the voices are perfection. I'm an adult who is kind of weary of the over-sexualized and overly violent movies made for ""grown ups"" these days. It is refreshing to have a story told in such beauty and grace that imparts significant meaning. This is a re-watchable movie that is quite memorable.

My 8-yr-old daughter was completely enveloped by the story, the music, and the artwork (as was my 6 and 5 yr-olds, my 3 yr-old was a little scared, but watched it).  Later, she asked me about how they drew so well and definitely wanted to emulate some of their techniques.  The closing credits that showed some of the early artwork and animation were a real treat.  Highly recommend to anyone!

I also really love the idea of engaging stories that don't have true villains, like Kiki's Delivery Service. This film is a good example of that.",1447459200,,607,4.574074074074074

6922210,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"I am a big fan of Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli. ""Song of the Sea"" has the same sort of appeal for me as Miyazaki movies do, including excellence of story, artistry, and music. This recent (11-08-2015) review in The Guardian accurately represents the way I feel about ""Song of the Sea"":

""Irish animator Tomm Moore nabbed an underdog Oscar nomination this year for his crystal-delicate Celtic fable Song of the Sea (Studiocanal, PG); his loss to the slick Disney mechanics of Big Hero 6 was as inevitable as it was unjust, but his lovely, lawn-lush vision may just become a whispered word-of-mouth classic. Moore understands children intuitively enough not to pacify or patronise them: as the film follows two young siblings  one human, one selkie  as they find their way home after being brusquely moved to Dublin, theres a very real sense of sadness and insecurity coursing through its fantastically imagined twist on folklore, drawn as though refracted through stained glass. Though its steeped in the imagery and mythology of its region, there are welcome echoes of the already missed Studio Ghibli here.""

We'll probably watch it again, to appreciate the drawings and music in minor key.  Nothing in this movie was too scary.  The ending was thought-provoking.

6922318,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"I watched this on my own, without the kids. But I just adored it, the art, the music, their voices- it was all sweet and lovingly done. The family dynamics, sadness, and imagery all combined to make this a wonderful, delightful treat for the eyes. The brother and sister dynamics felt realistic, and Ben's pain was always there, but it added to the story, rather than serving as an annoying plot device. Seirsa (sp?) was so complex and really developed as a character. Poor little girl. The grandmother is underrated- she really did try so hard, and received so much abuse for it. Overall I really loved how the siblings worked together for their common goal, and how pain and feelings were used to develop the story, rather than just serve as distractions. I felt very pleased and satisfied with the ending, no baring problems became clear to me. Would definitely recommend for a night in, or for family.",1446768000,,905,4.69811320754717

6922575,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"This movie stirred up so many feelings in me over the course of an hour and a half that by the end I was an emotional cocktail. The art is drop dead gorgeous and if I wasn't so enraptured by the movie itself, I could spend hours just staring at the flawless backgrounds and seamless animation. Every character is lovable in their own way and each has their very own method to capturing your heart in the end. Plot was very moving and wasn't rushed at all, the pacing leaves you feeling as excited and anxious as the characters do while the story unfolds. I will admit, I cried during this movie. It gets very emotional at certain parts while still managing to make you feel both excited and happy.

All in All, a near perfect movie. You won't regret watching it!

Like The Secret of Kells, the visuals in this movie absolutely blew me away  every single frame was a breathtaking work of art. Im a huge fan of fairytales, folklore and mythology, so it was really interesting to hear about a mythological creature Id never heard of before. Selkies seem to be the Irish take on mermaids women who are able to turn into seals with the help of a magical sealskin coat.

Overall I really liked this movie. I didn't like the storyline quite as much as The Secret of Kells, but the artwork and uniqueness of the tale made up for it. I would definitely recommend this movie to adults and children alike!",1444867200,,733,4.343065693430657

There are themes that can be delicate  to navigate, but even with two very sensitive young children, the movie flows in such a way that it's not difficult to explore complex emotions with youngsters, and in fact, can be very cathartic for young people who have experienced loss, isolation, confusion, etc. This is a riveting movie, and such a much needed departure from Disney  and other over-commercialized and violent rubbish",1444867200,,481,5.153846153846154

The animation is different than what I am used to, but it was very pleasant and detailed. It is nice to know that there are still clean, family-friendly movies out there. This movie doesn't rely on over-the-kids-head sort of jokes and innuendo. The magic and wonder of the story sells itself without catering to two different audiences at once. If you are looking for a movie you and your kids will enjoy, this is it. Especially if you are concerned about the adult content slipped into so many modern children's shows, as this has none. It is a truly magical film, capable of capturing the interest of all ages. Come prepared to watch the entire movie, you might not be able to turn away!",1444867200,,856,4.45859872611465

6922795,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"With an imaginative storyline of Irish folklore and beautiful imagery, this movie has taken over my top spot in favorite animated films.

Full disclosure, I cry through 75% of this movie. Not necessarily out of sadness, but out of sheer emotional attachment to the characters and their respective journeys through magical, transformative events. It is about family bonds, love, loyalty, and a little girl who is capable of freeing the spirit world from their purgatory of sadness. It has a touches of Studio Ghibli's Ponyo, but Song of the Sea is a deeper web of storytelling, and hits heavier subjects like death and depression, with an underlying message about bottling up negative feelings. The bittersweet nature of the film is the crux of the story; it never remains stagnant or black and white, but ebbs and flows in an abyss where reality and metaphors become one.

If you are banging your head against the wall because your kid wants to watch Barbie Fairytopia Mermaidia for the 937th time, this will be the cure for what ails you.",1444348800,,1039,4.864406779661017

6922947,4,B00R8KIJ3U,"I must say, this was an excellent film from every perspective.  The only reason it didn't get five stars was the slow start.  Yes, it had a slow start, but it drew me in once it really got into the plot.  And I also like that unlike a lot of movies that feature magical creatures, this one wasn't about them fighting...  Per se.  There wasn't a huge amount of magical combat.

Although the magical creatures were fighting for the Selkie, it was more about Saoirse's and Dan's relationship, and how Dan went from resenting Saoirse to loving her and dreading the moment when she had to leave, it was a beautiful film about a beautiful subject.  The simple art style was also nice.  There weren't complexly drawn characters in it, but that also kept the viewer from being distracted from the point of the film.  So kudos.

Overall, I'd say that this film really did a great job, and I'd recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind a slightly slow start.",1443830400,,946,4.47953216374269

But this movie has great things some of them
  -> will never let your head turned for a single moment as every frame depicts outstanding colors and eye captivating scenes.
  -> the profound sound quality which makes your ears filled with elixered symphonous music.
  -> a great script which has captured all the necessary ingredients of the original skandinavian folk tale.
  -> brings all the old nostalgic moments of your child hood days where we use to live in our dream lands after reading a story/ folk tale.

The animation, which I've read is hand drawn, is phenomenal! There is such a nice flow of the artwork, it intertwined beautifully with the storyline throughout the movie. The story itself is very unique in that it is based on a figure from Irish Folklore, a Selkie, which is a seal that can live as a human. Sounds weird, but it's really interesting and I was so engaged in this story (much more than my distracted 11 month old) that it was the equivalent of reading a book you can't put down. The artwork gave the movie a really magic feel, I actually can't wait to watch it again. And if for some reason it was not free with my Prime membership, I would buy this movie.

I have over a quarter Celtic blood and I am fond of the Scotish (?) legend of Silkies being seals that can become human when the reach dry land (they pronounced it Selkies in the film.) The animation and art, plus the mythology surrounding the subject are interesting enough, but the story line of an older child resenting the arrival of a new younger sibling also struck a chord with me... oh yes and there's lovely music too!

6923252,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"Much better than the director's other animated movie, the Secret of Kells.  I don't know if it has the repeat watchability of the obvious comparison and no doubt inspiration, Hayao Miyazaki's 'My Neighbor Totoro'  (what could??), but it has a sustained plot that 95% of Miyazaki's movies DON'T have.  (Ahem Spirited Away, and every other HM movie not NMT.)  The animation and overall painting of the characters and especially sets are amazing.  Only complaint  (SPOILER):  they younger sister is by far the stronger of the two (three, sorry, forgot dog) protagonists, and dominates the first half;  but by the latter half she has become merely a prop for her bother's story.  However, her brother's journey is ultimately rewarding, so, forgiven.

Others have probably mentioned this, but look for the Easter Egg when they are boarding the bus.",1442275200,,843,5.087591240875913

6923264,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"I liked the Secret of Kells but this movie really blew me away. The combination of the autumnal modern day setting intertwined with Celtic mythology was just breathtaking. On the surface, the story is about the legendary selkie, but there's so much more to this tale in terms of the other myths it draws upon and the very realistic little family at its center. A beautiful story of wonder, grief, independence, dysfunction and ultimately, love, this movie is on the shelf with my all-time favorite animations. If you're a fan of Coraline, Fantastic Mr. Fox and Miyazaki films, you'll certainly enjoy this movie.",1442188800,,611,4.941747572815534

6923494,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"Tom Moore is an Irish Hayao Miyazaki. song of the Sea incorporates Celtic art to tell a beautiful story that reads like folklore. I'm not Irish, but if I was, I would be immensely proud of Moore after Secret of Kells and now this immensely imaginative gem that is Song of the Sea.",1441584000,,280,4.30188679245283
6923495,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"Just finished watching ""Song Of The Sea"" released by Universal.
How this wonderfully animated story of love lost and rediscovered failed to win the Oscar back in 2014 for best animated feature film is beyond me.
""Song Of The Sea"" tells the story of Ben, who holds his baby sister Saoirse responsible for the death of their mother, who he believes died when she gave birth to her.  Only Ben's mother was a Selkie, and Saoirse was the last born of that enchanted race.
To celebrate Saoirse's birthday, their Grandmother comes down from the city to visit the island where their father is the lighthouse keeper.  Ben's resentment of Saoirse creates tension throughout the day, and at nighttime, when everyone is asleep, Saoirse slips into Ben's room and takes the enchanted seashell their mother gave him.  By blowing into the horn, she soon discovers the enchantment which leads her to her seal skin, which her father had hidden away.
An outing in the sea with her seal skin on, leads their Grandmother to take her back to the city; where Ben plots to escape; but soon learns that Saoirse is more than just his baby sister, and if he is to save her and his family; he must put aside his fears and do the one thing he's been afraid of all his life - swim.
At times, the animation almost rivals Studio Giblhi in it's story telling.
STRONGLY RECOMMENED!

Song of the Sea is simply one of the best animated films I've ever seen. The animation is stunning, albeit not what you'd expect from a 2014 film, it is still beautiful and it absolutely works. The movie is based off of an Irish legend of the selkie, which I honestly had no idea about before watching this film but you don't have to understand the legend to understand this film, the story is simple enough anyone can understand and enjoy it! Nothing complex about this film, both kids and adults can enjoy it. The music as well is phenomenal, it is absolutely beautiful from start to finish. I don't feel I need to say more (As I won't go into movie plot details), other than just watch this film already! You won't regret it!",1441497600,,886,4.503105590062112

6923735,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"Song of the Sea is an absolutely gorgeous animated film that is equally enchanting, adorable, and heartbreaking.

I remember when Big Hero 6 won the 2015 Oscar for Best Animated Film, and I remember there was an overwhelming gnashing of teeth from people who were all, ""What even? It wasn't that good!"" and I, not having seen Song of the Sea (or Boxtrolls, or Kaguya), was thinking that they were a bunch of sore losers and that Big Hero 6, even with its flaws, was a great movie with fun characters, quick plot, and good lessons, and deserved the win.

After I watched Song of the Sea, I found myself in the camp of teeth gnashers. It's not that Big Hero 6 isn't a good movie, Song of the Sea is simply a BETTER one.

The same storybook style that was so intriguing in the Secret of the Kells has evolved into something transcendent in Song of the Sea. The characters are very relatable even if you are not familiar with the Irish backdrop and the inheritance of Irish folklore that runs through this film's veins (heaven knows I was a bit lost with all that talk of Tir Na Nog and giants and fairies). The main character is a little boy who loses his mother on the night his sister is born. The loss breaks his father and induces the paternal grandmother to try and get the kids to stay with her, in the city, instead of on their little lighthouse island. We see how much the little boy resents his sister, and though it's clear that it's unjustified--she's a sweet, curious, and quiet little girl--we still can't help but sympathize with him a bit. This starting point makes his subsequent physical journey as he tries to get back to his lighthouse home from his grandma's house in the city, and the emotional growth as he finally confronts the wounds in his heart and tries to find closure to a tragedy, all the more substantial. You see real character development, and it happens in such a natural, organic way (even with all the fairies and owls about).

Put it this way--the movie's ending is heartbreaking, whether you read too deeply into the symbolism of it or not. But it's also strangely uplifting, as though the whole movie is meant to be heartbreaking, until the very end, when sadness becomes acceptance, and acceptance into joy at a new day.

I would highly recommend this film to both children and adults. I'm not sure who would cry more: mom and dad, or the kids. My husband and I blubbered quite a bit at some points, but it was cathartic in its own way, so I'll consider it a bonus. I fully intend to add this movie to my hardcopy collection; it really is that good. Better than an inflatable robot hero.",1440979200,7,2624,4.458333333333333

6923796,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"This movie is by the creators of ""The Secret of Kells"" and it shows in similarity of the art work and designs.  It is a lovely piece of animation with a strong story.  Fans of ""Kells"" will not be disappointed.

No criticism of other animated movies, but a lot of 3-D animation and stop motion animation these days go for realism.  I am thinking of the hair and fur in the How to Train Your Dragon movies and the action sequences in such films as Box Trolls and Kung Fu Panda.  Those are amazing feats of animation and the camera work and craft make you forget this is all hand done.

But Song of the Sea takes a completely different track.  This is clearly 2D style animation, with very stylized characters and settings.  This is a cartoon and it never lets you forget that fact.  But the artwork is so beautifully done and carefully designed that you could take almost any frame of the film and frame it as a picture.  I am thinking specifically of the swirling underwater scenes, the circular designs in the forest and the flying owls, and moments of magic that glisten on the screen.  It is an old fashioned, very painterly approach to the genre that is a great change of pace.

I have said little of the plot, but the old tropes of family love and youthful quest are given a nice spin with the Celtic legend of the selkie that makes this story feel original.  It is not an action packed adventure but it lulls you into a story full of magic and wonder.  It is a type of film that could easily get lost in the shuffle but it reminds you what ""old school"" animation is still capable of achieving.",1440720000,,1598,4.318791946308725

But viewers of any age will marvel at the animation, which will remind you of the minimalistic yet breathtakingly beautiful style of The Secret of Kells, this studio's first feature from 2009. The deceptively simple 2-D animation style and the focus on the children's point-of-view mask deeply resonant themes, and the film displays a very deft understanding of the complex, powerful, sometimes terrifying emotional relationships between parents and children. The easy interweaving of traditional Irish imagery and mythology is an added bonus.

6923883,4,B00R8KIJ3U,"If you have seen the Secret of Kells and enjoyed it, then you should definitely see Song of the Sea. The same art style, fantasy meets reality theme, and child perspective is carried over in Song of the Sea. It's nice to see something that while created on computers has a hand-drawn artistic quality to it, that is unlike today's typical polygonal animated fair. At times however this has somewhat of a Studio Ghibli (My Neighbor Totoro, Spirited Away) feel to it. Not only is this a emotional children's movie, it is a nice introduction to Irish folklore and thematically outside of your typical anime or american-made animated film. The characters and their motivations are relatable and believable within the context of the world.

For slightly older children I could see this movie coming off as a little slow as it's not ""action packed"" and the pacing is even-keeled without a lot of dynamic scenes which may come of as boring. As an adult that enjoys animation and creativity, I loved the plot as well as the aesthetics of the film.",1440633600,,1039,4.740331491712707

6923904,3,B00R8KIJ3U,"Part culture-promoting modern treatment on Irish folklore, part coming-of-age tale for not one, but two characters, Song of the Sea is a *highly* emotionally manipulative tale with a rich storybook-like presentation and an excellent soundtrack.  The story is at times rushed and nonsensical, and the characters come off as underdeveloped, but it's nice to see a sincere attempt at a bittersweet, original story to contrast with Disney's formulaic, royalty-obsessed drivel.

The Studio Ghibli influence is strong, and the film does little to hide the obvious fact that many Ghibli films had been directly drawn from for inspiration, particularly Ponyo (which was pretty much the source of the story - both films center around a house on a cliff by the sea and a magical girl whose mother is a kind of goddess), but also Spirited Away (lending the witch Yubaba in the form of Maca, with her large-headed bird-like appearance and avian lackeys and similar theme of ""alter egos""), and My Neighbor Totoro (whose Cat Bus was split into a normal bus scene and a magical-spirit-dog-powered transportation scene.)

There are some truly cathartic moments - particularly the reawakening of the old ""spirits"" of folklore at the end - which are only somewhat sullied by a nagging feeling of hollowness to the characters which I'll get to in a second.

The animation, similarly to Ghibli's, is good, but somewhat inconsistent, perhaps taking a page out of the Japanese book of animation production, which prioritizes shots to control workload, conserving extra keyframes and in-between frames to shots where it will count the most.  Sadly, it seems that at certain points, budget or time constraints forced some very rough-looking animation to make it into the final cut in places where it was unfortunately conspicuous.  It's hard not to notice the lack of detail in much of the actual motion of the characters themselves - think of it as TV serial quality animation on steroids - which perhaps was meant to go hand-in-hand with the minimalistic character design - but it does not always service the story as effectively as it should.  Some scenes are done better than others, and it's easy to downplay it for not being up to the level of Disney or Ghibli in terms of attention to detail, but the quality of the animation sits somewhere in the area of ""adequate"".

Crucial scenes, particularly involving any dialog, are surprisingly abbreviated for an hour-and-a-half-long screenplay, which seems to favor poignant, pretty vignettes over convincing characters.  Some of the worst bits of dialog can be found at the conclusion.  ""Saoirse's a selkie?""  ""Yeah.""  That shot was particularly enraging because the father's response (or lack of one) did nothing to resolve the impenetrable ambiguity of the father's actions up to that point.  The visuals of the film are so lush it sets the viewer up to expect a story that is sophisticated and, one would hope, also accurate in its portrayal of how people would act in this situation.  However there are many, many broadly-stroked exchanges between characters that unfortunately leave all the characters easily-digestible and predictable.  The brother is the most fleshed out of all, but he isn't particularly believable, being more of a cute-ified abstraction of a troubled boy presented at arm's length than a character I could truly believe and relate to.

Ponyo this is not, but for a second outing, it's a remarkable and definitely unforgettable achievement.  This is bound to become a favorite of children all over, while also being well-enjoyed by adults alike.",1440547200,2,3599,5.114334470989761

Better than Secret of the Kells (was that its name?), which was also good- and had a similar animation style/feel.  If you liked that, you will like this one too.",1440374400,,295,5.020408163265306

6923931,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"Love the animation - the beautiful scenes are so artistic.  The story is great, and a little sad - better for older children.  It would be hard for little ones to follow, but they would enjoy the scenes and song.",1440374400,,212,4.275
6923932,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"Not having seen or hear of Secret of the Kells, I wasn't sure what to make of this from the trailer alone. However, the animation was what intrigued me. During the opening song I immediately recognized the signature of Bruno Coulais from his work on Coraline. The movie drew my wife and I right in and we both thought it reminded of us Neil Gaiman's Mirrormask. An equally enchanting tale told using very artistic methods and music. While Mirrormask may have more in common with Alice in Wonderland, the idea that fantasy and another world can help us understand and work through the difficulties of reality is what they really share.",1440374400,,634,4.7207207207207205

Song of the Sea was a complete surprise and we enjoyed the film tremendously, now that is what story telling is all about, I was deeply touched and impressed by this work of art.

I remember reading an American Indian story about a woman who was a seal. I don't know who had the story first. It doesn't matter. I still think this wonderful whimsical tale is just beautiful.

It took the kids a few minutes of watching to get into it, but they liked it after it was over.

6924031,4,B00R8KIJ3U,When it started I was concerned that the art would be amateurish and vague but it was perfect for the story. We don't need Pixar type animation to stir our imagination. The main song in the movie was beautiful and haunting and leaves you wanting more. The story itself went through all the emotions a child would go through given the circumstances. Very good movie; I liked it. Not a five-star just because I don't 'love' fairy tales - nothing to do with the film itself.,1440201600,,471,4.488372093023256

We fell in love with the characters, the music, and the detail of the story.  Its a movie for young and old alike!",1440115200,,259,4.14
6924038,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"In many years I have not seen a movie which has had the same effect on me. Tender, warm, it brings a myth to life through this family. The brother at the beginning of the movie is rough with his sister, perhaps because he thinks she was responsible for the loss of their mother. As the stories progresses his love for his sister shows itself and he risks his life for her.
There are many lessons within the story. One is the confrontation between father and young son when the boy had to disobey his father and dive to find the selkie's skin. Sometimes we find ourselves disagreeing with someone we dearly love and respect, but we need to follow our convictions or we do not grow and will live with eternal regret if we do not act.
The little girl, the selkie, so trusting of her brother and so reliant on him at times. On her life other lives are held in the balance. The scene at the end in which she is allowed to stay with her father, who in such simple words tell her mother 'she is all we have.' And so the little girl stays with her brother and father because she knows there is love there also. I will purchase some copies and give to a few relatives.",1440115200,,1159,4.201793721973094

6924040,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"The art style and animation are amazing and the story is unique. It had my attention throughout from mythological creatures I have never heard of before. There are a few ""iffy"" parts where I would have been a little scared if I were a kid, but watching it with a family, these parts later turn out to be both sad and happy to where I almost teared up. The last movie I've seen that had my attention like this was spirited away. I'm surprised I have never heard of this before.",1440115200,,476,4.241758241758242

I thought the graphics were a little too simple, but the story was compelling, even for the 60+ crowd.  Definitely recommended family fare.",1439856000,,447,4.753246753246753

6924159,4,B00R8KIJ3U,"I'll have to admit that I liked this movie quite a bit.  The animation style bothered me at first because I'm not used to it and so it caught me off guard but after 5-10 minutes it made sense.  This is a colorful artistic film which usually I avoid because they tend to have vague plots.  This story was easy to follow in my opinion.  Sure it can come across sophisticated but that's so adults and children can enjoy it.  I'd rather say it's elegant.  Had I not known that this is based off of folklore I'd probably say it was written by someone high on acid.  It's not a fast paced film full of action, it's rather more of a fluid flow.  Soon as it was over, I recommended it to my sister and her girls.",1439769600,,704,4.087591240875913

6924173,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"Definitely one of the best animated films in a long time, it doesn't have the budget of something you might see made by one of the cookie cutter style studios(dreamworks, fox etc.) But it extruded originality, secret of the Kells is also very beautiful, lots of homages to studio ghibli you can see if you pay attention, characters look awesome, scenery is beatiful, voice acting is great very fluid and full of emotion at the right times. It's short and sweet perfect for children although of you're over protective like Marge simpson when they don't know nemos mom died this is about death in a family, illness, it's very emotional at times not overly but might be difficult to understand for some people overall I don't understand why unless you have already watched it.... haven't yet?",1439769600,,789,4.8088235294117645

6924176,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"Like this team's previous work, _Secret of Kells_, _Song of the Sea_ is absolutely gorgeous. _Song_ is even cuter than _Secret_, too, with some of the most adorable singing and voice acting. There are distinct resonances with Miyizaki's _Spirited Away_ and _Ponyo_, but this one lies somewhere in between: more accessible to younger viewers than _Spirited Away_, but with more for slightly older kids and adults than _Ponyo_.

I haven't seen Pixar's _Inside Out_ yet, but from what my wife tells me of her two viewings, a major theme is the idea that you can't be any one emotion (Joy, for instance) all the time, and trying to have one emotion all the time is dangerous. Given that, I think _Song of the Sea_ dovetails nicely, as a major theme here is the danger of trying to lock-away, hide from, or (in this case, literally) bottle-up your emotions, positive or negative.

The animation is like nothing else, as are the fairy characters out of Irish mythology. It's absolutely a must-see, and probably a must-own if you have kids.",1439769600,,1033,4.797752808988764

6924236,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"SONG OF THE SEA was nominated for BEST ANIMATED FEATURE, 2014. Seeing how it was up against Disney's FROZEN, it never had a chance.

The story is sweet, sad and in a single word, ENCHANTING. The design, artistry and execution of the animation is deeply satisfying in both detail and simplicity. There is nothing Disney-esque about SONG OF THE SEA--nor does it resemble Anime. The music is by composer Bruno Coulais (Coreline, Secret of Krells) and is extraordinary. Some of the images and situations may be too frightening for kids under the age of 5.

In conclusion, this is a world-class animated feature that will engage kids and deeply touch adults. This is a must see--especially if you have Amazon Prime which offers this film for free!",1439596800,,742,4.834645669291339

6924328,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"Absolutely beautiful film.  The animation has a unique style that turns minimal geometry into spectacular scenes- it's so strong that it propels Song of the Sea as much as the plot.  The plot and characters were similarly composed: minimal, but so well-done that they become engaging.  The movie honors Irish folklore, but makes it more relatable by choosing a modern setting.  It's extremely rare to find a film that comes together so well.  Everything was well-executed, and I'd recommend it to anyone.

6924334,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"Reviewed with two adults and two children below age 12.

Awesome. The animation style is very unique and hold its own as a fable like tale enfolds during the duration of the movie. It's a good pace and not too scary for the youngest though there were certainly a few tense moments and the sid'he turning into stone could be one of those moments requiring explanation and reassurance. Something similar could be said of the ending requiring discussion with the kids. Otherwise the general opinion is that this is on par with some of Pixar's works. Haven't seen the prior work, Secret of Kells, yet (well started the first minute or two but had to do other things), so can't compare.",1439424000,,681,4.628099173553719

I took my daughter to see it at an independent movie theater near our home in Western Massachusetts and was excited to see that it was available on Amazon Prime. The beautiful animation is hand drawn and painted over rich watercolor backgrounds. The moving story of a grieving father raising his two children alone in Ireland is steeped in myth and folklore. The accompanying celtic score is serene. My four year old daughter loved this movie and has watched several times with rapt attention as these two children navigate the Irish countryside on a journey of self-discovery that brings them back to their home in a lighthouse overlooking the sea.,1438992000,,672,4.852173913043479
6924482,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"Beautiful movie. Up there with Ponyo and Totoro as one of our true favorites for whole family. We must have watched it a dozen times in the first month after first viewing. Didn't know any selkie stories before seeing this. This is much happier than the traditional selkie story, so don't let that dissuade you.

Has a few harrowing parts that upset our 4 yr old boy the first time. Makes mom cry more than kids. More harrowing than Ponyo, less so than Up or Planes. Not harrowing to our 7 and 9 yr old boys, but still captivated.

The story in a story is beautiful and held the attention of the older children.

The art is interesting, enchanting. The water colors are gorgeous while the main characters are simply drawn. It makes it very beautiful and accessible to kids too.

Almost nothing inappropriate. But: graffiti in a couple scenes shows an Fbomb spelled in..perhaps Gaelic? At least not in English, so they probably can't pronounce it and make out it's a swear word. It went totally over my kids' heads.",1438992000,,1014,4.585635359116022

The sound and music designed were great as well. In essence it was a semi-musical adventure, wear singing was the main topic, without going into a musical (which, this movie greatly benefited from). That really matches the semi-slow pacing of this story as well.
The voice acting... was okay. Though this story was about a song, it really benefited more from its animation than its voice acting or singing, which was quite average.
I was annoyed at the child... but its to be expected, since the plot itself is sort of cliche (big brother hating little sister, then changes). Quite predictable plot really, but that is not what makes it good.
The story itself, along with the sound and music design and the visuals make this a great movie.
And its about a seldom talked about subject in english culture... irish lore. (I think. I don't really know anything about European lore).

So everything goes great until the ending.

***Spoilers***
I don't know if I missed something while watching the movie, but why do they have to leave the world again? Was there a purpose for them leaving? I don't really understand why they had to leave. There was pretty much nothing that touched upon it. So it makes no sense why, in the end, everyone ended up leaving. If its because of some spiritual life force that can't exist in this world, then it would be best to be explained.
Why do the worlds need to be separated? Is this some pre-Korra avatar stuff? Do they die in this world? But it appears that singing solves everything, so all they would need to do is sing every now and then. They had physical bodies before. Wait, does that mean their dead, and are pure spirits?
If that is so, that this ending is kind of depressing. Everyone ""died"" anyways, despite the daughter's effort to save everyone, so they had to leave anyways, neglecting the whole point of the plot. And they had to leave anyways. Why didn't the mother do this earlier? Clearly she still had her Avatar powers to connect the spirit and material world, thus opening a gate for all the spirits to go in.
And wait, doesn't the daughter need the coat to talk, or did she become pure human, since the coat was destroyed? I missed that part in the story, because I was completely stuck upon wondering why everyone had to leave.
And, why are they dying? Because they are losing their power? I don't really know, its not explained. Why would they come to the human world if they were going to come here knowing that it was a one way street, ending with death, even in their spirit form? That would mean that it wasn't like that before, so what changed since then? Can't they change it back, so that they don't ""die"" in the material plane?
Do I have to know actual irish lore to understand this? Then I refuse, because such an explanation should be in the story, even if its the mother telling the story to the child.
Uhh.. I don't really understand. Why. Why are the fairies in the human world. Why does the Selkie have to avatar everyone back to the spirit world? And why the hell does the Selkie have to go with them? Because she is their queen? It appears they would still be connected anyways. I mean, her mother probably did the same thing. So does that mean, there is an endless cycle of all the spirits moving to the human world, and the selkie singing them back to the spirit world? What would even be the purpose of doing that? Does that mean this is the last and final time spirits can cross over (because based on the prologue scenes, it seems that they have been doing this for eons)?
These are questions that are never explained, and I would never care to find out the answer to because they were never elaborated in the movie.

tl;dr Aside from a ""nitpick"" that I consider a major plot failure (or hole as some would call it, but I consider it a failure because how this is answered would completely deny the premise of the story). It was a good movie. Great story (minus some plot), great sound and music design (though the acting was lacking, except for the prologue voice acting), and cute and beautiful visuals and styles. I would recommend this.

I immediately fell in love with the trailer and had to see it. After watching, it quickly became one of my most favorite animated films, in the history of ever.
The art, the music, the story; they're a feast for the eyes, ears and imagination!

6924752,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"We all remember when the nominees for the 2014 Academy Awards were being read off to us and we got to the Animated Film category andno one heard the name The LEGO Movie.  Actually, you may not remember it.  You see, the film was heavily considered the frontrunner to such an extreme that I personally didn't notice the snub until a few minutes later when I was compiling my list of the nominees and I noticed I didn't type The LEGO Movie down in the list.  I did a double take, looked it up, and low and behold, it was indeed snubbed.

Outrage ensued.

I, personally, was pretty upset about it.  I was upset because I had seen three of the actual nominees (How to Train Your Dragon 2, The Boxtrolls and Big Hero 6) and while I liked all of them to a certain extent (some more than others), The LEGO Movie was a notch above the rest.  I was NOT upset because The Tale of the Princess Kaguya and Song of the Sea were nominated.  I had not seen those films, but I had read the raves, and I have no problem with foreign films sneaking in anywhere, so that was not a problem for me at all.  It was the American films I took issue with.

But, a lot of people didn't look at it that way.  Did you happen to read the Brutally Honest Oscar Voters comments from that year.

And I quote:

for that movie not to be in over these two obscure freakin Chinese f***in things that nobody ever freakin saw, that is my biggest b***.

Ignorance people, ignorance.  I absolutely hate ignorance, but when  it comes from your craft then I hate it even more.  These are Oscar voters, which means they work or have worked in the industry.  Have some class.  Honestly, it shows that these voters consider Animated Films to be lesser works that are to be judged by their children (one voter actually stated that she let her children decide the winner) and not judged on the merit of what they contribute as a standalone film, and this is a shame.

Heres the thing; Song of the Sea is a better film than The LEGO Movie.  This isn't a knock on The LEGO Movie a film I found endlessly entertaining and extraordinarily clever, but Song of the Sea is pretty close to absolute perfection and, in a just world, would have won the Oscar (I still haven't seen The Tale of the Princess Kaguya).

Song of the Sea tells the story of Ben, a young boy who loves his mother dearly, but on the eve of his sisters birth his mother disappears in quite the tumultuously mysterious way, and so Ben has grown to nearly despise his younger sister, Saoirse.  But there is something special about Saoirse.  You see, shes the last of the selkies.  If you aren't familiar with selkies, they are basically Irish mermaids, creatures of folklore that are seals who transform into beautiful women.  The film then follows Ben and Saoirse as they journey to undo a curse placed on her people and free them once a for all, in the process saving Saoirses life, as she struggles to survive without her coat (in Irish folklore, a selkie sheds her seal coat when she becomes a human, but needs it in order to survive).

Im personally quite fascinated by selkies.  I love that kind of fairytale, and Ive seen a few wonderful films that have touched upon the subject.  Song of the Sea is the best that Ive seen.  It has such a beautiful way of being both magical in scope and yet so intimate and honest in texture.  The way it touches upon the bitter and consuming aspects of grief is so heartbreaking, whether it be the way that Ben and Saoirses father, Connor, becomes a mere shell of a man in the wake of his wifes disappearance, or the way that it was one mans uncontrollable sadness that caused his mother to curse the land in order to spare him (and herself) the continued grief.  It also shows how grief can be overcome and can be used to make us stronger, to help us love deeper and appreciate what we do have.  And lets not forget the beautiful tale of the bond between siblings here, which is so touching, so moving, so heartwarming.

Not only is Song of the Sea a profound piece of storytelling, but its a visual wonder.  The animated here is truly transfixing, with complex and spellbinding sets and a range of details that light up the screen.  The scope of this animation is astonishing.  And the music, oh the music.  The rich Irish musicality complete with some stunning Original Songs by one of my personal favorite singers, Lisa Hannigan, bring such life, spirit and culture to this brilliant film.

So, The LEGO Movie should have been nominated for the Oscar; no doubt.  Im in agreement with you there.  BUT, it should not have been at the expense of this cinematic wonder.",1435795200,,4626,4.395294117647059
6924753,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"A gloriously beautiful film. The character animation is not to my taste--highly stylized and super ""cute""--but they were still effective and well done, and the background animation was absolutely stunning. The detail, the color, the design--it's all just so beautiful. The story is just as rich and lovely as the artwork, about a broken family, a fabulous dog, and of course a selkie, and the healing she brings to all the characters. The music was beautiful too. Just a gorgeous film. I'll be buying more copies to give as birthday and Christmas gifts.",1435708800,,553,4.956989247311828
6924754,3,B00R8KIJ3U,"Pretty, alternative style with nice animation. It just seems a bit too focused on its story and seldom takes much time to let you take in the beautiful world they have created for this. The voice acting is also a little on and off at times. If you enjoyed the Secret of Kells (made by the same folks behind this) then you should watch it, just don't expect it to hold up well next that movie.",1435622400,2,392,4.171052631578948

It does have ""magik"", so if that's not your thing, you might not want to watch it or allow your kids to watch it, but I agree with other reviewers about the gorgeous animation and music. It is a magical film with more visual storytelling than words. The expressions and moods evoked through the animation and sound track are to me brilliant. You don't NEED a lot of dialogue in this film. If you have a child dealing with abandonment, grief or loss issues, this film might be an emotional trigger. The mother ""goes away"", but not because of any lack of love, yet a child may not be able to comprehend the complexities of the parents' challenges.

I am only writing in response to some other reviews that claim this is anti-female... I am a feminist, in the sense that I believe men and women should be treated equal in all aspects of life... With that said, Sircha is the Heroin in this movie... Her brother is a big ol'nasty brother (like they often can be) in the beginning, and treats Sirche like she's a pain in the ""you know what"" (which little siblings can be.) Other than that, this movie is incredibly moving. No joke, I tear up every time I watch it. I don't know what gets me more, the story or the visuals; any frame could be framed and put on a wall... It is by far the best toddler/children s movie I have ever seen, and quite possibly one of the best overall movies of all times!

I thought the movie actually could have been shortened down--there were slow scenes that I viewed to be somewhat repetitive, and maybe I was just in the wrong mood, but I was confused by the fantasy; I re-watched portions to understand why certain beings were turned into stone. All in all, I recommend this movie for youngsters, and adults alike. I recommended it to a friend who has young teens--I thought the story was sufficiently sophisticated to appeal to her kids, who are 16 year old twins.",1431907200,,824,4.456953642384106

The story is wonderfully rife with Irish folklore (selkies, witches, etc.) and is told through the eyes of a young boy and his sister who are working through a family tragedy that they don't fully understand. They're quest through the fairy realm reveals symbolism which echoes they're own lives and helps them unravel a mystery about their mother and resolve a long standing sibling rivalry. This movie is beautiful and a little sad, but not overly so. It is rated PG. I have a 8 and 5 year old daughters, and we all absolutely loved it! As inspiring as any Miyazaki film!

6924899,4,B00R8KIJ3U,"Admittedly, I had never heard of this movie until its nomination at the Oscars. But after seeing a bunch of clips, and reading a ton of nice reviews about it, I decided to give it a watch, and was utterly blown away.

On a lighthouse hilltop in Ireland lives two kids and their dad. Ben, the older brother, is both sad and angry at the mysterious disappearance of his mother, and he takes his frustration out on his younger sister, Saoirse, who, despite being six years old, has yet to start talking.  On the night of her birthday, Saoirse puts on a strange, white coat, and, upon entering the ocean, discovers she's a selkie; a girl who can magically change into a seal. In order to keep her origins a secret, her dad sends both her and her brother to live with their grandmother in the far away city. But the kids can't run from destiny forever, and when a scheming owl witch kidnaps Saoirse, it's up to Ben to summon all his courage and newfound brotherly love to save his sister, who holds the key to saving all of the magical creatures in Ireland.

First off, the artwork and animation in this is utterly incredible and beautiful. After seeing so many CGI animated movies, it was nice to see something traditionally animated again, and we REALLY need to lobby for more classic animation again, especially if it turns out looking like this. Often times, the artwork looks like a storybook come to life, and that serves the story well, considering much of the plot revolves around old folklore and keeping fairy tales alive.  If you liked cartoon shows like ""Samurai Jack"", or any of Hayao Miyazaki's work, you'll definitely enjoy this.  There's a lot of slow and quiet moments, allowing the audience to soak up the scenery, and not rely on constant talking to get the plot across.

While there's very few characters, they're all a nice bunch.  Saoirse, despite being mute for almost the entire movie, is a sweet and adventurous girl, and you can always tell what's she's trying to say or what's on her mind just in her movements and expressions.  Ben goes through a lot of development; starting off as being very jealous and resentful of his sister, but over time, comes to understand their sad circumstances aren't her fault, and learns to love her; risking his life to save hers. Even the owl witch isn't really evil; she steals and locks away the emotions of herself and others, thinking they'll be better off that way, and not realizing she's only making her and everyone's personal pain worse.  In a sense, she's very similar to Ben and Saoirse's father, who tries hiding the truth about magic; not understanding that he's only creating more sadness and more problems by not facing them.  The other magical creatures that appear get relatively small parts, but each of them are funny and memorable, and taught me a lot more about the figures of Irish folklore, and makes me want to look them up and learn more about them.

This is one movie that's truly a masterpiece of art, and deserves a lot more attention.  Now I really want to look up this studio's other raved about movie, ""The Secret of Kells"".",1431302400,2,3111,4.615942028985507

I admit it, I had to look up what a selkie was and read up a little on Irish mythology, but that's what made it so good, I actually learned something from it. I even memorized the theme song in Gaelic and sing it to my baby as a lullaby, she loves it.

We've seen that film many times, and my son still can sing the cat's song.  The animation of Song of the Sea is often astonishingly beautiful, so the film is worth seeing.

6924962,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"Children's movies aren't something I gravitate to now that I'm an adult, but I still am on the lookout for interesting animated films that have intelligence and maturity. Sadly, the US is sorely lacking in that department, with Disney having (seemingly) lost its way. Thankfully, I am able to find what I'm looking for with animated offerings from other countries, and SONG OF THE SEA is just the latest of these discoveries (for me). SONG OF THE SEA is loosely adapted from an Irish/Scottish legend about women (mostly) who can exist in seal form. That was something I had to look up to more fully understand this rich mythology, which might be a sizable learning curve for someone who isn't from Ireland or Scotland, but the story told in this film should be understandable and relatable on an emotional and intellectual level by anyone who chooses to watch it. I really don't want to give away any of the story at all because doing so would spoil the experience of seeing it for the first time. The film generally deals with family, loss and magic, which should be enough going in. The magical elements will appeal to children, as will the young protagonists, while the adults will be able enjoy the allegorical and symbolic layers that gradually unveil themselves as the film progresses. Aside from a few narrative conveniences, I thought that this film was exceptionally crafted and emotionally involving. I should also mention the animation style, which had a watercolor-like/storybook feel to it and gently moved between soft, impressionistic images and more angular, expressionistic ones. If I had to make a comparison, the character design reminded me a little bit of PERSEPOLIS, but this film is in full color and uses it to beautiful effect. Ultimately, I hardly found any fault at all here and this Oscar-nominated film deserves to seen more than it has. A definite ""see it.""",1430092800,,1887,4.9

6924995,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"HERES A princess of the Celtic-kind for you. And her brother, a true prince of a lad  although it takes a while for him to get his bearings.

Like director Tomm Moores The Secret of Kells (2009), Song of the Sea was nominated for Best Animated Feature Film at the Academy Awards. A high honor and well deserved for this charming tale of two siblings, born of a lighthouse keeper father and a selkie mother, a fairy creature who lives in the sea and becomes human on dry land once shedding her magical fur. Theyre a kind of Celtic version of the mermaid myth, Moore says in his lyrical commentary.

Selkie stories  like many Irish tales  are a bit melancholy. Things rarely work out well for the lovely creatures and Song of the Sea doesn't skew this point. How could they? Moore says he was inspired when on holiday with his son in the west of Ireland. He was just beginning work on Kells and they were sketching on the beach when the child noticed dead seals on the shore. A local woman advised that the fishermen had started killing seals out of frustration because of the falling fish stock.

I found out that [that] had much more to do with human intervention than anything to do with the seals, he tells us. The woman went on to say the killings wouldn't have happened in the past, that there was more respect for sea life and a belief that permeated the local culture that seals could be selkies, people that could transform into seals, or they might be the souls of people whod been lost at sea. That got Moore thinking about how folklore had once been more integrated into peoples daily life, a life that also helped protect the environment and led to a more balanced way of living.

Maybe, Moore says, we were losing more than stories.

Song of the Sea takes Irish legend into contemporary times, where magic weaves its spell throughout the city and buses and dumps as well as the land and sea. It also tells a tale of sibling rivalry. Young Ben is stuck with a little sister, Saoirse, who seems to get all his fathers love and attention after their mothers disappearance. Its not true, but from Bens point of view, nothing in his life is exactly right or fair. When Saoirse finds her own magic fur and takes off into the sea to swim with the seals, her father and grandmother are frantic with worry. They have no idea  or will not accept  that her magic works. Ben and Saoirse are bundled off with the old woman to live in the city. Dad packs up Saoirses fur and throws it into the sea.

Leaving his home and his dog only upsets Ben more. Distance from the water sickens Saoirse, and soon the two are running away together, heading back home. Thats when they begin to discover the enchantments that literally saturate their homeland and how it is endangered, particularly by a bitter old witch, who wants to bottle up all feeling, a misguided attempt to help her centuries-old son thats turned to stone because of grief.

Only Saoirses magic can help them all  and only if Ben can find a way past his own loss to help his little sister.

Whew  thats pretty deep for a fairy tale. Still, it all works in a way both children and adults can enjoy. One of its many charms is that it never talks down to us or simplifies the characters emotions. Even granny and the old witch are motivated by the love inside their damaged hearts.

Like Kells, Song of the Sea boasts a unique animation style that speaks of illustrated books and it is gorgeous to watch. The backgrounds tell a story as well as the characters making this worthy of many repeat viewings on the Blu-rays HD transfer. Colors are rich; the atmosphere golden and warm, even under water. A DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack balances effects, ambient sound and a haunting score by Bruno Coulais in a masterful surround-sound experience.

In addition to Moores commentary  which sounds like a fairy tale itself told in his Celtic brogue  Universal presents a nice package of bonus features. Behind the Scenes can be viewed with or without Moores explanations, while Animation Tests, a concept trailer and The Art of Song of the Sea reveal some of the secrets behind this animated story.

Song of the Sea is an enchanting tale of family and magic in the tradition of My Neighbor Totoro. It is highly recommended for all.   Kay Reynolds",1429574400,,4298,4.518709677419355

6925009,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"There is a character in ""Song of the Sea"" called 'The Great Shanachie', which is also a fitting title for the author/director, Tomm Moore.

In a style that resonates at the most fundamental human levels, Mr. Moore presents a tale of legend, of discovery, heroism...and, most of all...the importance of family. ""Song of the Sea"" is, on the surface a tale of the Shelties...seals who can turn to beautiful women and sometimes marry human men. In Mr. Moore's hands, the tale is about the impact of loss on the human heart; and, how in trying to end the pain, the soul can be lost. Yet, it is a tale of hope...of how in the simple act of raising one's eyes from the ashes of lost dreams, one may find that the dreams have always remained...simply out of sight.

If I wax poetic, forgive me. This film is incredibly human, with a depth of story and characterization that makes many 'live' films pale in comparison. It is like something you would expect to listen to at dusk, in front of a turf fire with the strains of a Celtic harp singing all around you. Add to that, an utterly unique and beautiful animation style that enables the film to achieve the dreamlike state of myth.

Utterly beguiling and suitable for all ages, the ""Song of the Sea"" is a film to be cherished, and handed down to the next generation.",1429401600,,1309,4.468619246861925

6925017,4,B00R8KIJ3U,"Tomm Moore and Will Collins have done it again. This wonderful movie for all ages introduces the audience to the heart of some Irish legends and folklore.  The superb animation is a wonderful follow up to there groundbreaking and spectacular previous feature ""The Secret of Kells.""  For those familiar with Irish history and legends, both films are filled with delightful story lines and references to the some of the best tales the Irish have to offer.  Add to that the stunning visual imagination of the marvelous production team and these films soar as some of the best animation in recent film history.  I have used ""Secret of Kells"" in my Celtic Spirituality course at Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota and it is a highlight for many students.  I will add this film to the class in the future. This reviewer only hopes that there are many more films from this gifted group of film makers who do not compromise on intricate imaginative style in the midst of master story telling.

With Miyazaki retiring, I felt we had nothing to look forward until stumbling upon a review of Tomm Moore's work.  Now we've found our new filmmaker to love, who doesn't pander to kids or punctuate with pop culture references.  We loved the characters, the beautiful brother/sister relationship and the beauty of the animation.  Amazing film, I can't wait to watch it again.",1429142400,,521,5.011627906976744

There are definitely some sad elements, although heartwarming in message, including the story/turmoil of Selkies and Irish mythology, which I love. I was glad I was watching it with him though so I could check in about how he was feeling during the sad, scary or more abstract parts, discussing  what was happening or what it ""meant."" I think the movie was enchanting. I loved the music and the artwork/animation was refreshingly simple and amazingly beautiful, especially since now a days animated films bombard us with CG.",1429056000,,598,4.98
6925031,4,B00R8KIJ3U,My three year old son loves this movie. everytime we go on amazon to watch TV now. We have to play this trailer first to get a fix. The music is what locked in his interest the most. Only reason I did not give 5 stars is because I was turned off at first by the way the little boy treated his sister and the devil mask shown while they were riding the bus on holloween.  Could have done without that given the intended age group.,1429056000,,429,3.988372093023256
6925032,4,B00R8KIJ3U,"This was a very good movie. My 4.5 y.o. sat transfixed watching it. Wasn't sure about it, but he loved it. The animation reminds me of the Book of Kells, very graphic and deceptively simple.  Think its just uncomplicated round bits... then watch as they move and transform into something magical. The voice work is well done, and worked very well with the story without any difficulty for little one in understanding the accents. The story is good (big brother/little sister dynamic was easily translatable to friend dynamic, and the scary plot moments were manageable (nothing not in the average Disney tale). It almost instantly entered the play it again category. It's a lovely story, and reminded me some of a Hiyao Miyazaki film with the acceptance of magic and the centralness of the children. Adults are supporting characters here.

Why not 5 stars? I didn't deeply fall in love with it, but there wasn't anything I didn't like.",1429056000,,935,4.8742138364779874

6925050,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"Just like Secret of Kells, this film is full of wonder, magic, and beauty. But it is also full of mystery, darkness, and sadness. There's some childish humor in there too, but it's mostly a contrast of darkness and lightness, freedom and restrictions, love and hate. I recommend this film to lovers of mythology and folklore, as well as children with great imaginations and patience. It's not an easy movie to just sit and watch; it takes you on a full journey and you have to pay attention to the details. The animation is stunning, the voice actors are superb, and the music and score are some of the best I've ever heard recently, far better than Disney and Pixar films.",1428710400,,673,4.570247933884297

6925087,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"As I was looking through the 2015 Oscar nominees for Best Animated Picture, I came across the title ""Song of the Sea.""  I already figured it had little to no chance of winning, as Disney and/or Pixar usually take home the statuette every year (a personal pet peeve of mine, but nothing I can do about it), but immediately the concept of this film intrigued me.  One doesn't often hear much about movies made in Ireland, and if an Irish movie was notable enough to garner an Oscar in a field largely dominated by American and Japanese animation, it had to be something special.  And the fact that it featured creatures of Irish folklore -- including selkies, one of my favorite underrated mythical creatures -- was an added bonus.

I'm happy I gave this film a chance.  It's adorable, exquisitely animated, and overall beautifully done.

""Song of the Sea"" is centered on two children who live with their father in a lighthouse on an island off the coast of Ireland -- Ben, resentful that his mother has abandoned their family, and Saoirse, his mute little sister whom Ben blames for the death/disappearance of their mother.  When Saoirse discovers a beautiful white fur coat and ventures into the sea with it, nearly drowning, their grandmother decides their father is incapable of taking care of the children and takes them to live with her in the city.  Ben is determined to return to his father, however, and he and Saoirse set off through the city to find their way home.  But on the way, they encounter a troupe of Ireland's Fair Folk, who reveal that Saoirse is a selkie -- a girl with the ability to turn into a seal if she can just find her sealskin -- and that if she can find her fur coat and her voice, her song will save all the faerie creatures from Macha, the fearsome Owl Witch who is turning the faerie creatures to stone.  But the children's father has gone to great lengths to hide Saoirse's coat... and even with the help of the faerie folk, will they be too late to save them... and Saoirse?

This film is beautifully animated, with a unique visual style that's quite pleasing to the eye.  It's not quite anime-ish, but the large eyes and the lush landscapes will call to mind the works of Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli.  And when many studios have given up 2D animation in favor of CGI and 3D animation, it's nice to see the art form hasn't entirely died out, and even better to see it used to create something so beautiful.

The characters are oddly bland in this film, and Ben starts off as an unlikable brat, but thankfully he, at least, develops over the course of the film and gradually becomes more likable.  Saoirse is more of a static character, almost more of a plot device than an actual character, but she's oddly adorable and it's hard not to like her.  And even the two villains of the movie, the grandmother and the Owl Witch, aren't without good traits -- it's obvious the grandmother wants to help the children and means no malice, and even the Owl Witch believes her intentions are good in what she's doing.  One can draw some obvious parallels between these two characters...

In contrast to a lot of American animation, ""Song of the Sea"" is quieter and more atmospheric, not relying on a bombastic musical score or a lot of slapstick humor to hold the audience's attention.  Thus, it may not be for small children, or for people more used to the brisk, almost frantic pace of most modern animated films.  But for those who are fans of Miyazaki's work, or are willing to be patient, this movie is quite rewarding.  It takes time to set the atmosphere and let mysteries reveal themselves without a lot of exposition, and that makes it well worth watching.

Beautiful and a lovely showcase of some of the lesser-known creatures of Irish mythology, this is a great film for those who want an animated feature that's a little bit different from the norm.  And if you like Studio Ghibli's work, give ""Song of the Sea"" a watch.  You won't be disappointed.",1428278400,,3984,4.563202247191011

It's visually clever as well as aesthetically pleasing, and contains wonderful - and refreshing, in western film  messages about the power of acknowledging feelings, good and bad; about the vital importance of remembering the old songs and stories; and that heroic feats are achieved, not individually, but by family members learning to appreciate, champion, and rely on one another despite their vast differences.",1428105600,,753,5.172131147540983

6925117,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"I just got out from watching this film in the theaters and immedietly ordered this film on blu-ray. For those who don't know, This is the second full length animated film, after The Secret of Kells, from up and coming Irish studio Cartoon Saloon, and revolves around Ben and Saoirse (pronounced sear-sha), and their struggles after learning that Saoirse is a selkie, a creature in Irish mythology that turns into a seal when in the water. The film is heavily influenced by a number of aspects, predominately Irish culture and lore. You don't need to know any of it to watch (I didn't), but you will probably get more out of it the more you know.

Song of the Sea shows how much Cartoon Saloon has already learned in the span of one movie. The Song of the Sea is better than Kells in almost every conceivable way. It's animation is crisper, its music is more gorgeous, it has a better story, better pacing, and more relatable characters. My biggest qualm with The Secret of Kells was that the ending seemed incredibly rushed, and Song of the Sea remedies this beautifully. It is exactly film I wanted when Cartoon Saloon was first advertising it.

It is not a perfect movie. It did have some problems with it, notably a slow start, a few characters being overly eccentric, just for the sake of it. There are some frames that stick out, and the film often flips in between exuberance and fear too abruptly. Also, it may have been because I was spoiled on the ending accidentally, but it felt that the film had trouble inducing a sense of tension near the climax of the movie. However despite that, this movie still ended up being one of my favorite films period of 2013, and easily makes it into my top two spot along with Kaguya.

If you're a fan of animation, and you have not yet seen this film, you owe it to yourself to watch it. It truly is a wonder to behold the amazing animation, beautiful music, enthralling lore, and amazing adventure that ties this film together.",1428019200,,1973,4.5210084033613445

I cried a lot (quietly so as not to concern my sweet boy) because it is so touching. Even the animation and art is stunning. I fast forwarded through the part with the owl witch because he didn't like that. It's not that scary maybe for ages 3+, but he's sensitive and is used to more docile things at his still-delicate age. Anyway, I recommend this movie for children and adults.

The story takes us through young boy Ben's journey of losing a mother, and, subsequently his his sister, Saoirse, while simultaneously reminding us of humankind's journey of losing our connection to Mother Earth. Ben must find compassion within himself to understand that his sister is different than he is, and garner the courage to protect her differences through overcoming his own prejudices about the role she played in his mother's death while dealing with an emotinally absent father. The movie deals with these issues gently but profoundly, through the magic of the natural and mythological world.

6925197,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"I blind bought this Blu-ray because of the critical acclaim and my lukewarm fondness of the studio's past film, ""Book of Kells"". I couldn't have been more blown away and this is now one of my favorite movies of all time!

Everyone from Mom & Dad to our 5 kids (ages 2-7) was completely engrossed, and it even caused my 6-year-old to put down her iPad mid-game, which not many movies can do! :-)

The hand-drawn animation is gorgeous, stylized, and distinctively Irish in the country- and sea-side settings and Celtic-style art.

However, the real strength of the movie is in the rich personalities of the characters and their engrossing struggles; from the young boy who resents his adorable little sister, to an intimidating and charismatic witch who tries to steer the quest off course, to the parents and grandparents of the children, whose involvement in the story nearly left me in tears (of both joy and sorrow) at times.

This movie easily qualifies as a masterpiece and distinguishes itself in a ""sea"" of computer animated kid films which tend to shy away from such emotional subject matter as this movie contains.

After watching the Tale of Princess Kaguya this year, I thought that no other animation film could beat it for the year but I believe Song of the Sea did just that. This movie is wonderful in every single way from storytelling to the visuals and even to the music. This is my review of Song of the Sea.
___________

NARRATIVE: The primary characters in this this movie is Ben and Saoirse who are brother and sister. Ben's mother abandoned him and his father when Ben was a young child but lefther new child behind who is Saoirse. Six years later Ben begins to resent Saoirse and often blames her for everything wrong that has happened to him. Saoirse is a quiet 6 year old girl who still hasn't learned how to talk yet and it has become a mystery  for Ben's father who often is gloomy and detached after his wife had mysteriously left him 6 years ago. This is where the story kicks off and I will not say anymore to prevent spoilers.

Throughout the narrative, we get to see the character progression of young Ben and how he grows up in the story along with his relationship with Saoirse. The story takes elements from Irish Mythology and works itself into the story really well. It kind of reminded me of Spirited Away a couple of times during the story because that movie too is based off Japanese mythology in similar fashion. The ending was beautiful and heartbreaking as well and definitely left an impression. This movie is extremely memorable.
__________

ARTWORK: I was captivated by the artwork done in this movie from the very beginning where I saw the lighthouse on the cliff all the way to the ending credits. The design of the film is highly based of the Book of Kells which was the studio's previous movie but it significantly improves upon it. The whole film is done in a 2D backdrop but it is extremely well executed. I truly appreciate the work that they have put into this film in terms of animation and design. The scenery is beautiful and the colors just pop like eye candy.
___________

MUSIC: The music is gorgeous. What can I say? This movie is downright perfect. The main song ""Song of the Sea"" is played multiple times throughout the narrative but it does not seem annoying in any way. It captures the essence of the film and will captivate you every time you hear it. I know it sounds like I am fangirling here, but trust me the sound is just magnificent.
___________

CONCLUSION: This movie is a must watch for everyone out there. I can't seem to think of anyone who wouldn't love this film. Go out there and watch it now! BengirlxD approved.",1426636800,,2728,4.424302788844622

6925210,3,B00R8KIJ3U,"There is no doubt that this - aside from The Wind Rises and The Tale of the Princess Kaguya - is the most beautiful animated film of the last two years, hands-down. I just couldn't get behind the utterly and deliberately sexist themes of the story. It's the 21st Century, and we still have women's rights issues around the world. Why are we propagating more of this in the art and film world?

Throughout the tale, we see a young boy as the centerpiece, responsible for his sister, a grand quest full of peril, and saving the world from turning to stone. Meanwhile, his sister is also in every scene, but is treated like an object rather than a person - bullied, tugged around on a leash, and not even given the ability to speak. And when she finally does speak, the first thing she says is the boy's name. And she appears to readily accept a brief apology for the years of torment he put her through.

The other females of the tale either exist as the magical ""other,"" unattainable by humans and therefore also objects to covet, or are inane, or just plain evil.

And it's the women that trigger the greatest pain and suffering of the story: mother selkie destroys the emotional stability of a human family out of selfishness, old witch turns everyone to stone also out of selfishness, grandmother takes kids away from their father also out of selfishness.

I want to like this film. I really do. My question is this: what is its message to the young girls of the world?",1426636800,18,1471,4.477611940298507

There were tears streaming down my face as I watched the film, and I left the theater grounded with a resolve to 'man up' and make some changes in my life. That, in itself was enough for me to rate it five stars, but everything else about the film is superb as well!
You don't have to be Irish to appreciate this film, that would defeat its purpose and message! As a first generation Irish-American I was already familiar with the superstitions & folklore surrounding the selkies and fairies. As a 'born again Celtic pagan' I had studied Celtic mythology to gain a deeper understand of my roots. They brought those elements to the film with a light touch, as a backdrop for the human story, without becoming heavy handed or preaching. Everything about the film (music, animation, art, storyline, etc.) really worked for me, and I will buy the DVD to share with my friends!",1425945600,,986,4.607954545454546
6925214,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"This should have gotten the Oscar in a year full of great films.
There is no question that nearly all of the talked about animated films had great animation, I won't talk about plot since simplicity is key in this section of the entertainment industry, so my criteria is simple yet off topic to most people; what did I feel thanks to the feel.

SPOILERS FOR ALMSOT EVERY ANIMATED FILM IN 2014 (but I will try to be vague).

How to Train your dragon 2 tried to give us a story about losing the ability to make peace and learning how to man up and save the day, but it did not grab my heart that tightly.
Big Hero 6 gave me coping with grief and the futility of revenge, but not strong enough.
Box Trolls had a moral of self determination which includes not trying to succeed by society's standards.
The Lego Movie was a glorious kick in the face to Joseph Cambells Power Of Myth philosophy and much needed penicillin for the mentality of the industry, but as poignant as that is it was a touch far from the human condition to resonate beyond that context.
The Tale of Princess Kaguya had a ""be careful what you wish for"" moral coupled with the trials of being seen as an object and prized by others. That honestly gave me a fresh viewpoint on an experience of being a woman (I say ""an"" because all humans are complicated and I hate to generalize).
Kaguya would have my vote for opening my eyes for the oscars......until I found a familiar emotion in Song of the Sea that I had yet seen articulated in film at large; the tragedy of selflessly helping someone and hurting them in the process. It is in a subplot, but choosing between kaguya revealing an experience someone else felt and Song of the Sea showing me something I have seen and never articulated, THAT IS MOVIE MAKING. It changed a core way I understood the world and gave it a face and poetry. Not a flight of fantasy, not a reinforcement, not a comment on something trendy, not a new experience that is still distant from me, but it gave me myself in a way I did not think was possible. That can only be achieved by extraordinary coincidence or truly insightful writing and directing and considering my friends feel the same way I would like to believe the later.

I am going to preorder this movie rather than hunt it down later for a cheaper price. These writers and animators deserve every dime I can spare.",1425945600,19,2371,4.384090909090909
6925215,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"'Secret of Kells' was a brilliant movie, rich in imagery, characterization, and history. The same team put together this masterpiece, too, and it wholly deserves its Oscar nomination. The plot centers on a very human family (dog included), of a small boy (Ben), his younger sister (Saoirse, 'seer-shah') and their widowed father. Saoirse's cute, eager, and intelligent, but still hasn't spoken at age six. We find out she's a Selkie, as at home in the water as a seal as much as on land as a girl. A bit of family drama separate the children form their father, in an unhappy and unfamilar environment - and the real story begins.

It turns into a grand quest, with fairies, giants, an owl-witch, and other magical beings of no easy description. And with a doom descending on the magical world that only Saoirse can forestall. This combines elements of mythology whit things like high voltage power line towers seamlessly, imbuing even the most mundane objects with wonder and menace. Dozens of the movie's elements seem to draw on traditional myths and stories - none of which I'm familiar with, adding a touch more mystery to the magic.

But, however much I like the story (and that's a lot), the telling is what you'll remember. The cartoons are visually lush in more different ways than I can name - you really have to see them. And the music! Sound tracks don't often stick in my mind, but the centrality of music and song in this story helps make it memorable. Although completely kid-friendly (unless your little one is very skittish), adults of any age can enjoy this - and maybe even more than the kids do.

6925216,5,B00R8KIJ3U,"About a month ago, I saw THE SECRET OF KELLS, which I found delightful enough. I was determined to catch the filmmaker, Tomm Moore's, most recent Oscar-nominated animated feature while it was still in theaters, so I jumped at the chance to see SONG OF THE SEA when a couple of showings cropped up near me.

Tomm Moore's fully hand-drawn story spirals color and pattern and wisps of details as it recounts a tale stemming from Irish and Scottish legend: a legend of the Selkies, women who walk the land as humans but swim the sea as seals. Our story focuses on Saoirse (Lucy O'Connell), a mute six-year-old girl and the last of the Selkies, being raised by her single father (Brendan Gleeson) and ignored by her older brother, Ben. The one-sided rivalry between Ben and Saoirsehe feeds on his resentment because he blames her for their mother's deatheventually leads to his discovery of her magical origin... and the role she's meant to play in saving the remnants of the mystical world.

This may be a fantasy, but it's really about a family, and a relationship between siblings when a tragedy is constantly hanging overhead. Their evolution as brother and sister IS the story. Everything else is secondary, but it is hardly nothing. Moore constructs a nearly flawless movie, one like I've never seen before. His feature, THE SECRET OF KELLS, was similarly beautiful, stylistically, but it didn't have the heart that this one does. By the end, my heart had nearly burst from love for little Saoirse and the endlessly loyal Ben.

By far, the best animated feature of 2014, if not the last few years. It is pure magic, and precious without sacrificing its storytelling for that warm, fuzzy feeling. Even though, yes, that feeling is there, too. I walked away pondering the themes, the implications... it actually reminded me of my feelings walking out of PAN'S LABYRINTHso many incredible possibilities, all of them adding layer upon layer of meaning.
