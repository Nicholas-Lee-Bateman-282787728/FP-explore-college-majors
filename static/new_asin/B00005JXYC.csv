I rented it from a video store (if that tells you anything about a time line lol) because it had Jami Gertz who I've liked since she played Star in Lost Boys.  Kat gave Alli a contemporary styled chair back when they were in college that she had made herself.  Kat was creative, Alli not as much.  Years later Kat shows up and finds out Alli built her career selling copies of Kats chair while Kat, well didn't.  Allis a conservative business woman and Kats the same bohemian wild child she's always been.  Alli shouldn't have taken advantage of her friend like that and Kat shouldn't have, well I don't want to give too much away.  It's got a fantastic soundtrack which if you love Ani.....  Most anyone I've watched this with loved it and as I see people having a problem with the sex, drugs or language?  Look at the cover.  It's a fun stay home and curl up on the couch kind of movie.
Oh and Amazon, that video is an entirely different movie.",1456272000,,1011,4.358288770053476
7942614,3,B00005JXYC,she not very well presented in this movie shes better class than her potoral too much drugs and bad sex,1393718400,,103,4.2
7942615,4,B00005JXYC,This movie is very enjoyable.  It has the spice of sexual prowess and the humor that creates a good handful of laughs.  It isn't raunchy but definitely has sexual content that is seasoned with humor.  It also provides a great amount of suspense that keeps you involved wondering Oh wow what is going to happen next.  Definitely worth watching.,1361318400,,343,4.762711864406779
7942616,2,B00005JXYC,I purchased this movie on DVD recently because I like Jami Gertz.  There was some excellent acting in this movie but the overall story and language was not my cup of tea.,1347840000,,170,4.3125
7942617,5,B00005JXYC,"What can i say.  Its a movie thats meant to be a bit suspensful and it is.  Its also quite hilarious.  Alie is quite well off, and runs her own company selling artsy furniture that she puts off as her own designs.  Her most successful piece being a rosebud chair.  Only thing is Alie really didn't make that chair.  Her best friend Kat made that chair.  Well, Kat comes in for a visit.  See Kats not like Alie, atleast not anymore.  Kats still the same as she was in art school.  She sleeps around alot, drinks alot and basically does everything alot.  Shes a dred head bohemian wild child and Alies, well, not.  Kats a sweetheart and Alie knows that, but when Kat finds out that Alie has used her gift to get ritch off of while Alie was selling herself to make money for dinner she is less than thrilled.  She then proceeds to slowly destroy Alies success.  Its not a thriller.  Its not a drama.  Its not a comedy.  Its a movie about honesty, rules in love, and of all things, its a movie about friendship and finding the root of it and whats worth fighting for.  This movie is not risque, which the cover makes it appear that way.  Its a fun movie.  I definatly recomend it.  Its also set the the sounds of Ani Difranco which is a definate plus in my book.  She fits the film.",1045180800,9,1278,4.215767634854772
