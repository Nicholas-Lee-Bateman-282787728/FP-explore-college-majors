Bud Abbott and Lou Costello were probably the greatest comedians in twentieth century America. They made many comedies that dealt with life, such as Buck Privates, In the Navy, In Hollywood, Keep Em Flying, In the Foreign Legion, etc. I never saw a bad movie. They also had a radio show and a television show. These are satires on the horror movies of the 1930s. You should have seen the original horror movies to best appreciate these satires, but its not necessary. All their movies were funny and very popular. Some of their movies dealt with the popular Westerns of that time (Ride Em Cowboy and The Wistful Widow of Wagon Gap). Read the individual reviews for more details.

Abbot and Costello Meet the Invisible Man.
Bud and Lou graduated from a Detective School and get their first client, a man wanted by the police. A boxing manager was killed because of a fixed fight and Tommy is the suspect. The horror in this movie is the crooked boxing matches and those who profit from them.

Abbot and Costello Go To Mars.
The boys load supplies into a rocket ship. They start it and it lands in New Orleans (after a trip through the Holland Tunnel!). Space suits are look like costumes for the Mardi Gras festival. But then the rocket ship takes off and lands in Venus. They meet the natives, there are jokes. They return to earth for a ticker tape parade.",1436832000,,1398,4.517786561264822
