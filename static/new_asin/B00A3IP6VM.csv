8546483,5,B00A3IP6VM,"IN THE DARK HALF is an extremely layered tale of loss, mourning, longing and coming-of-age, with a gentle, yet persuasive supernatural sub-text. It is brilliantly nuanced in the way it questions/side-steps conventional mores as it examines the deep-seated often seemingly contradictory emotions which make us human. The acting is equally brilliant across the board; the directing/editing assured. The only minor downside is the slight overuse of music and music cues. With a story, script, acting and direction of this calibre, one doesn't need musical underscoring. (Still, I must say, the theme is poignantly lovely.) However, the main reason I'm writing this review is due to something I missed when ordering. It's clearly stated on the product page that this is a made-on-demand Blu Ray-R, rather than a Blu Ray. (I was so keen to get a Blu Ray of this film, I missed the caveat.) I was initially disappointed, but the video is utterly, impressively pristine. Additionally, the dialogue is clear, though, given the accents, the subtitles are a help; despite the fact that they are, on occasion, in error, and, amusingly, miss a word key to the story (which is thankfully mentioned on the jacket summary).",1482624000,,1208,5.137055837563452
8546484,4,B00A3IP6VM,"Me be likin' those 'rubber reality' movies. The good ones draw you in and keep you guessing. They hint that something is up, you just aren't sure what it is. Then, when it delivers the punchline, it urges you to head back and gather all the hints that were there all along. This is one of those films.

Here's the scoop. Marie has lost her father(?) but we don't know how. Her next door neighbor, Filthy, has lost his wife with hints of murder lingering. They live in a small (small) town in the English or Welsh countryside. She is at odds with her mom. Is mom losing it or is Marie losing it? While sitting Filthy's only son, he drops dead for no apparent reason. Now things get really rough. There's quite a bit more but this will need to suffice.

This is heavy on mood. The plot points are all soft. They don't outline a destination in the beginning and make a bee-line for the end. Instead, there is strong reliance on leitmotif. Recurring images, sounds, shots that add to the sense of gloom. The sound design is also very good. It really raises the creep factor. The rural/forest setting in fall, with the constant blowing wind and sense of chill also put me ill at ease. Then there's Marie. She seems to be struggling with some level of O.C.D. and her filching rabbits from Filthy's snares, killing them and then ritually burying them in a bunker, while scribbling various notes and symbols on the bunker walls is unsettlingly curious. How about mum. Is she heading 'round the bend? Her actions are curious but she seems to have her reasons for doing things. These are just a few of the things that contribute to this nifty flick. I'd better stop now or this will get too long.

I can see where someone might not be disposed to this sort of film, but for me it was a great and creepy watch. I must see it again.",1362441600,2,1820,4.378698224852071
8546485,4,B00A3IP6VM,"This is a BBC film that got a limited theatre run and tells a very off beat tale indeed. We meet Marie played beautifully by Jessica  Barden (`Tamara Drew') she is living with her mum after her dad has disappeared. Her mum is renovating the house by apparently smashing it up. Her next door neighbour is the delightfully named `Filthy' - Tony Curran (`Boardwalk Empire' and `Gladiator'). He has lost his wife and the nasty village rumour circuit has it that he actually killed her and disposed of the body. This is given weight by the fact that he goes out hunting and trapping - especially rabbits which are a constant theme running throughout the film.

He does have a little boy Sean, whom he dotes on. Then one night he wants to go out `lamping' and asks Marie to babysit the six year old boy. Whilst away there are some shenanigans but on Filthy's return he finds his son dead in his room. Marie takes solace in hiding away in the hills in a den she has turned into a sort of Wicca shrine to the dead and to ward off evil spirits. Her increasingly erratic behaviour alienates her to almost everyone, and Filthy's grief can only be assuaged by finding out who is to blame.

This is very spooky almost super natural in places but that is done deliberately to ramp up the atmosphere as this is actually quite a slow paced film in many respects, but you don't actually notice until you ruminate on the production. The performance from Jessica Barden is astounding as she worries her way in an anguish fest through the whole thing. That said the film pretty much hangs on her and Tony Curran who is always reliable. This won't be to everyone's taste and is more of a moody drama with heightened levels of anguish, but for such an unassuming film this really does pack a wallop.",1358467200,3,1777,4.461538461538462
