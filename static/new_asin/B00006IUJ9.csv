7969459,3,B00006IUJ9,"I bought this as a stocking-stuffer for a college-aged girl.  She liked the general idea and thought it was totally cute, but when she followed the directions she found that her hair twisted, pulled, and hurt.  This product is perfect for someone who has another person to do the styling.  It does work for somebody doing it by herself, but it might be frustrating (and therefore abandoned) if done alone.",1230422400,,405,4.757142857142857

Each concentrates on a 5-7 min. set comprising basically the most famous premises from each comic. Not necessarily a great or comprehensive collection, but nice as an intro. to each comic's particular style. Rita hosts. Rich Hall is just after his Sniglets run. Cho bit is not the MontgomeryWard set - it's the one about her name and parents.
