5895868,4,B00E8N314C,"Pretty funny.

Overall he's not quite at the top of the stand up comedy world, but he has a fairly good grasp on international comedy. His routine will play well to an international audience with an open mind.

It can be a little slow at times and he spends a bit of set up on getting to know the audience so for someone without patience it can drag a bit at the beginning. But overall he hits on some universal humor and ends in a really positive place.

I'm not sure this is the kind of comedy show I'd bother to watch again as the overall themes are not particularly unique enough to demand additional viewings, but once through was a decent hour of laughs. (note the show is an hour and 15, there's about 15 minutes of banter that kind of drags here and there, hence the 4 instead of 5 stars).

Anyway, I enjoyed it, but it was free (Amazon Prime) and it's not something I'd probably bother to buy as I don't see much rewatch value in it.",1471219200,,942,4.1878453038674035

5895921,5,B00E8N314C,"It's not just his material, which freakin' original, clever, and hilarious, it's his timing.  Sooo perfect.  That and the way he masters so many accents -- Persian, Arab, Jewish, American, Mexican, Russian, Indian, African, Swedish, you name it.  Definitely a comedy all-star.  And he does it with a minimum of profanity.  Not that I'm a prude, because I definitely appreciate that a judicious amount of profanity can heighten the humor.  But these modern comedians who sprinkle the F-bomb and various other no-no's every other word strike me as just plain lazy.  Instead of clever material, they give us the equivalent of a couple of kids hiding behind the garage saying ""tee tee"" and ""doo doo"" and giggling at themselves.  Laughs on the cheap.  If you're going to give me profanity, fine.  But give it to me in material that's at least funny for some quality other than saying verboten words.  Anybody can do that.  Doesn't make one a legitimately funny or original comedian.  Maz Jobrani is a legitimately funny, clever, and original comedian.",1436918400,6,1046,4.976878612716763

5895983,4,B00E8N314C,I believe this was one of his best performances. You must know that this is not super witty comedy. It's mostly building on ethnicity jokes.,1402185600,,140,4.64
5895984,5,B00E8N314C,A natural flowing style without absolutely no jokes that were not thoroughly funny. His cleaner jokes make him refreshingly different from his contemporaries.,1402012800,,158,5.913043478260869

5895991,5,B00E8N314C,Maz Jobrani is no doubt one of the best comedians of our time. Maziar with his variety of material and skillful body gestures nails you to your seat and cracks you up till it hurts! As an Iranian American I'm grateful to have people like him around in order to show every man and woman who believe the nonsense media puts out there that not only we're fun and loving people but also respect and embrace the western culture and values. I dream of a day that people see us as the unique individuals that we are and not a group of screaming angry terrorists that the media portrays us to be.,1396569600,12,588,4.258928571428571

5895993,5,B00E8N314C,This guy is so goddam funny. His type of comedy is similar to Russell Peters. Meaning that most of his jokes is about his race (Arabs and Persians),1395878400,,147,4.285714285714286
5895994,5,B00E8N314C,"Maz Jobrani is naturally funny, engaging, and I just really enjoy his type of humor. Axis of Evil was great, Brown was OK, this one is also great fun. Enjoy.",1395273600,,157,4.266666666666667

5895999,5,B00E8N314C,"As a multiculturalist, I really like how he compares different cultures. So much of his material leaves me in stitches. The only thing that detracted is that I watch so many of his youtube clips that I already knew a number of the jokes. But otherwise, this was really good.

Some of his impromptu humor is every bit as good as his planned jokes though. I like how he tries to set up a rapport with his audience as well.",1391472000,,420,4.25
5896000,4,B00E8N314C,"I liked the international perspective and good comedy without a plethera of vulgarity. It was very interesting to observe the responses of the Stockholm audience, which in itself, was very diversified.",1391385600,,201,5.516129032258065
5896001,4,B00E8N314C,I had never heard of Mr. Jobrani but thought I would take a chance and am glad I did. I started by wondering if other countries would find or understand American humor funny but being an Iranian Immigrant he delivers it very well. Understanding their humor he does bits on each of the countries in that part of the world and as it turns out we can all find humor in  each other. I had been looking for a good comedy part and some  I couldn't finish but found this .which was really good. I would highly recommend to others.,1391212800,,523,4.22

5896006,5,B00E8N314C,I enjoyed this video very much. Maz through his comedy show presents a more accurate picture of Middle Eastern cultures and especially Iranian culture. Can't wait for his movie.,1389830400,,177,5.137931034482759

5896008,2,B00E8N314C,The jokes were not as funny as before. Maz sounded more like Russell Petter and his jokes. I know he can do better without copying Russell.,1389052800,,139,4.384615384615385
5896009,4,B00E8N314C,"Not as good as the ""Axis of Evil Comedy Tour"" but still quite good. Clever use of the audience and his being married to an Indian, but he needs some brand new material.",1389052800,,168,4.121212121212121

5896011,5,B00E8N314C,I always like a good laugh that is what this video brought me.

I will planing to watch it again in couple of weeks again when I need a good laugh again,1388707200,,322,3.9692307692307693
5896012,2,B00E8N314C,I watched the first half hour of this so-called comedy performance by Maz Jobrani. It was terrible. His routine consisted mostly of asking people where they were from or what was their name. I gave up.,1388707200,,201,4.611111111111111
