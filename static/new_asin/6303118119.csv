571977,3,6303118119,"This is a good romantic comedy which features on two characters who meet on top of the empire state building and end up falling in love during the coarse of the night. This film is a bit talkative because it was adapted from the stage play, but it's funny, warm, and romantic because of William Holden, David Niven, and Maggie McNamara.

571978,3,6303118119,"A fairly amusing sex farce from nearly half a century ago features the unusual, now-forgotton (and ultimately tragic -- a suicide victim) Maggie McNamara, who is courted, swooned and wooed by both David Niven and Bill Holden. David Niven's career at the time this film was made was in serious jeopardy; he had a contract break-up with the legendary Samuel Goldwyn which was anything but cordial and his pictures prior to this weren't much of any consequence (a good example is a silly, inane ""comedy"" entitled THE LADY SAYS NO, 1951). The notoriously tyrannical Otto Preminger suddenly came to Niven's rescue ( it was rather like being snatched from drowning by King Kong!). The director was noted for enjoying the experience of striking terror into the hearts of his cast members and technicians alike. Niven emerged unscathed, however, and was ultimately deeply grateful to Preminger for casting him as the middle aged playboy. Niven does a commendable job and there is a certain chemistry between the three leads. THE MOON IS BLUE outraged many in its day by using such words as ""virgin"" and ""seduce"". In light of what's allowed in films today, this is hilarious. In 1953, however, it was condemned by the Catholic Church and banned by the censor. Aided by distributors, United Artists and director Otto Preminger defied the ban and released the film -- the first time the American censor had been so defied.",1017446400,19,1411,4.932773109243698
571979,4,6303118119,"This is a great romantic comedy from the early 1950's that will make you  laugh all the way. The two leads are superb, especially William Holden,  whose role seems very modern. If yo like romantic comedies, this one is for  you!",965433600,3,228,4.512195121951219
571980,5,6303118119,"Anyone wanting to know what was considered ""racy"" film making in the early 1950s should see this movie.  (It was ""condemned"" by  the Catholic Church which usually meant huge box office receipts.) Two  people meet by chance at the top of the Empire State Building, an architect  (Holden) and a young, inexperienced, naive girl (Maggie McNamara).  Written  for the screen from a hugely successful Broadway play, it could be compared  to a Moliere hysterically funny, yet poignant boy-meets-girl,  boy-loses-girl, boy-gets-girl story line.  The word ""virgin"" is  cast around casually and Dawn Addams runs around nude in the city  (well-covered by an enormous fur coat).  New York City is the real star of  this movie and when I first saw it as a teenager (much to my parents'  displeasure) I promised myself to live there one day.  Maggie McNamara  never got past the type casting (the definitive ingenue)and never had much  of a career afterward, but what a great role for a young woman!  As my  heading reads, William Holden was in his glory..a heart throb for every  young girl.  Also cast was David Niven...playing David Niven...as the  ""other guy"" (in more recent times the Tony Randall role).  No one  before or since could deliver an innocuous line such as, ""You could've  knocked me over with a feather,"" and make it hilarious like David  Niven.  See this black and white classic and try to understand how  sensuality is so much more effective in films when done with subtle care  and great writing.",962064000,45,1504,4.8804780876494025

He serves it up the way it should be without adding extra water, even at a time when such dilutions were the rule.  The young girl, Maggie McNamara, was wonderful in this film. I don't recall seeing her before, nor in anything else, but she stays in your head after seeing this film.  David Niven was probably never better, and Holden is Holden.

572134,4,6303118119,"I saw The Moon is Blue for the first time in January 1954 and always wanted to view it again. When I found that it was available on DVD via Amazon.com I ordered the disk and viewed the movie once again. The movie was considered too risque for general viewing when it originally opened and was exhibited in ""Art""  movie houses where I lived. Not surprisingly this movie did not seem one bit risque when I viewed it 60 years later. It was still a cute story but quite corny by today's standards. Back in 1954 I nearly ""fell in love"" with Maggie McNamara. Now, I could name plenty of modern-day actresses who would have that same reaction, even more so. I do recommend this film, especially for people who might remember seeing it long ago. It will be amusing if nothing else. David Niven and William Holden, the males in the movie, did their usual job as fine actors, too.

Well, I sat down to see how they did sophisticated adult comedies back in the early 50's and, guess what, I was totally delighted. First of all, I discovered one Maggie McNamara, a petite actress with a humongous screen presence. Where has this woman been my whole life.

572219,2,6303118119,"Ok, honestly, I ADORE William Holden, he is a bombshell man. He is gorgeous, sexy, funny, and charming. And a terrific actor! The only reason I enjoyed this film was because Bill Holden was in it, otherwise I would not recommend this movie. It needed to be more romantic and fun with that ""sweep-you-off-your-feet"" kind of playfulness that a lot of romantic comedies did in those days...this movie did not have that. I quickly grew very tired of having someone barge into Don's room at every hour! If they weren't barging in his door, they were calling him off the hook!  Don and Patty never had a moment alone, it seems..maybe two scenes. This movie was simply made annoying by Maggie McNamara's character! She was naive, nosy, simple-minded, and childish...not to mention, a real nagging pain! I am not blaming this on the actress, that role written for her is awful. I am sorry but William Holden is a dynamite man, he deserves a dynamite woman!! It was almost as if she were a 16 year old child and he was this handsome, charming 30 year old...doesn't mash, he needed a woman of somewhat equal prowess.

I had no problems with William Holden in this, I never do lol, he was fantastic in this :)

If you are interested in watching this film, I would say watch it so you can decide whether it tickles your fancy or not!  I just wanted to share my thoughts so that when you watch it or if you have already watched it, you can see a different perspective of the film that is not yet represented in the reviews for this movie (everyone seemed to enjoy it).

572300,5,6303118119,This is a great story and superb acting. Miss McNamara's character was particularly well done.

572301,4,6303118119,"The film version of THE MOON IS BLUE is virtually identical to the Broadway stage production of the early 1950s.  As such, this gentle comedy dances around '50s sexual mores, especially the heroine's comic obsession with her virginity.  The parts are well-played by Maggie McNamara, William Holden, and David Niven, and Otto Preminger's direction is just right.  Even by 1950s standards, none of the characters does -- or suggests doing --  anything 'immoral,' yet the dialogue tweaks then-current mores so wittily that it provoked the Hayes Office (Hollywood's censor) to the ultimate stupidity of withholding its Seal of Approval.  THE MOON IS BLUE is dated but fun -- in part, perhaps, because it is so dated.",1267315200,2,712,5.103448275862069
572302,4,6303118119,"I was drawn to ""The Moon Is Blue"" by it's notoriety.  Sure there are some dated elements here but there are also many that are timeless.  The frankness in which matters of sexuality and male-female relationships are breached are presented both maturely and humorously.  It must have been cathartic for the makers of the film as well as the actors to be part of a production that bravely tears down walls that others feared to approach.  Nary a swear word is uttered but the script is replete with some delicious double entendre that will make you wonder how did they think they would get away with this.  The love triangle that encompasses the main story are downright superb.  Both William Holden and David Niven as the seducers of the ""unsuspecting"" virgin are at once charming and just a smidge slimy.  They reminded me of Steve Martin and Michael Caine in the more recent ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"".  Newcomer Maggie McNamara is a breath of fresh air as the targetted innocent whose not as naive as her suitors are led to believe.  The only real debit here is a certain staginess to the proceedings which derives from it's theatre origins.  Many films that were taboo in their day seem dated but ""The Moon Is Blue"" still retains a certain freshness.",1265500800,,1252,4.701834862385321

If you like this movie, another movie in the same vein is ""Roman Holiday"" staring Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn.  For more of the 50's, see ""The Red Shoes"" (Criterion Collection).  Both on DVD.",1264032000,,441,4.475

The reason for the scandal was that the subject of virginity was discussed at length. Considering what passes for romance these days, the movie is innocent and the story is rather naive. Still, it is fun and the dialogue is clever and light. I enjoyed it almost as much as I had when I was 13. It's obvious it was a play before it was a movie but the action moves right along.",1234569600,3,502,4.13265306122449

William Holden and David Niven are terrific but the best in the cast is Maggie McNamara and I wish she had done more movie work.  The dialogue is witty and the story is charming.

With all the trash being put on DVD it is a shame that this little gem is not.  It is also fairly hard to find the tape and it is not cheap but it is worth paying a higher price for.
