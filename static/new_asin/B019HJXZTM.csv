7575802,2,B019HJXZTM,Boring.  Moved very slow. I watched the whole movie.  Seems like I remember this received a lot of critical claim.  The ending was the first real moment I felt like Sangaile was not the typical depressed teenager.  Not my kind of movie.,1457308800,,236,4.5476190476190474
7575803,5,B019HJXZTM,"The film was excellent, a good story of adolescence and discovering oneself. The chemistry between the two newcoming actresses was superb, the scenery was absolutely breathtaking and the soothing music just added more to the film. Definitely one to see on your free time!",1456963200,5,271,5.181818181818182

8745195,1,B019HJXZTM,"Glacial....slow....shallow...empty characters...thin ""plot"".....Beautiful??? 71% on Rotten Tomatoes?  What have these people been watching - drywall tutorials? So little happens here between two underdeveloped characters it's a wonder anybody stayed with this long enough to review it. I got to 29 minutes left and bailed. 'European' style, ooh, nice languid pace, beautiful countryside, so blah blah blah.' How could anyone write a screenplay for this? Maybe on a matchbook cover. Bored sleepy cutter girl meets bored sleepy non-cutter girl, both mumble and almost fall asleep filming on location, lorazepam and unisom all around everyone. Hunger Games it ain't. You state your thesis - visually or in writing, build on it, illustrate it with character development, move your characters through experiences that define them individually, mix them with situations and or other characters to flesh them out, bring them to the finish line by referencing your initial thesis, now developed with experienced characters to the compelling conclusion. Think the opening scene of The Hunger Games with Gale and Katniss tied with the closing scene of Mockingjay 2 with Peeta and Katniss, thesis of resistance and family and unity in love replayed like a symphonic theme, several threads echoed, completed, characters richly developed and experienced, now sharing a future shaped by the developments written in the books and illustrated in the films. Poor. Oppressed. Resistance. Unification. Struggle. Victory. Family reunited. Peace for the future.  Or - dreamy stare, long - did I say long........meaningless silences, vapid groggy stares, going nowhere in particular. I can't comment about how this - whatever it is - ends - since it wasn't worth staying to see it die.",1516320000,,1763,5.501845018450185

8745197,1,B019HJXZTM,Movie should be x rated.  Very poor movie.  Do not recommend at all.,1469577600,,68,4.153846153846154
8745198,5,B019HJXZTM,Beautifully done!!,1465430400,,18,8.5
8745199,4,B019HJXZTM,"A beautiful, emotional romance that perfectly captures that post-school feeling of having no idea where you want to go next and even less of an idea as to how to get there. It's way slower than I'd like to get going, but once it does, the actresses have great chemistry together and the film just looks gorgeous. Sensual and emotional, but definitely not quite as accessible as some other modern lesbian romance, like CAROL.",1464998400,5,424,4.743243243243243

8745203,5,B019HJXZTM,"I'm a visual person. The imaginative storytelling, stunning cinematography, and developing characters work well for me (though apparently not for all viewers). Also, the score sets a fitting, youthful tone. I loved the romance, and how love fosters growth. The interplay between the two leads is compelling.

The physical setting shapes opportunities for the characters. I found myself wanting to learn more about it. With that in mind, here is some background that this US film viewer found helpful:

Lithuania resembles Minnesota, with its flat topography, forests, and abundant lakes. Perhaps because of its flatness, Lithuanians are fascinated by flying craft of all kinds. Airshows are a common summer event.

In the 1960's, 30 miles west of Vilnius the Soviets built a power plant fueled by gas, oil and bitumen. To cool it, they  dammed the Streva river, creating a reservoir. For the workers, they built a town of sorts called Elektrenai, which consists of many block-style apartments, and a few stores and community facilities. Both the reservoir and the town are heated by the power plant.

Today, the Elektrenai power plant is Lithuania's primary source of electrical power. People still live in the aging apartment blocks. In this story, in the post-Soviet era, single-family-detached vacation homes for wealthier families have sprouted up along the water's edge but away from the town.

The teenagers in this story would have been born a few short years after the re-establishment of Lithuanian independence. The parents of these teens would have grown up and become adults under Soviet occupation.",1460073600,13,1611,5.2734375
