2248047,5,B0007XG01S,"I saw this movie in Spain, including the explicit sexscene in the beginning.  I hope that is what the unrated version is.  I heard about several (if not all) screenings in the US with the first (sex) scene cut from the movie.

2248048,5,B0007XG01S,"i just happened to be in dallas tx while this movie was playing and i am so glad that i had seen it.  this movie is a testament to the bonds that form in a family.  a gay uncle is forced to care for his nephew when his mother was detained in a foreign country.  that is the basic premise of the movie.  the true beauty of the movie comes through when the uncle is faced with the boy's grandmother blackmails the uncle into giving up custody of the child.  you really see the emotion and the torment the uncle goes through when the grandmother uses his lifestyle against him in her fight to take away the child.  in a very short time you see a father son relationship form between the two and it rips your heart out to see them separated.  the young boy knows all about the world and knows all about his uncle and his homosexuality and the fact the he still loves and encourages his uncle is a beautiful thing to see.  the movie hits all the right notes and does not pull any punches and lets you see who these characters are.  i love this move and cant wait to get it on dvd, see it if you get the chance",1109808000,24,1104,4.050691244239632
2248069,2,B0007XG01S,"When it was launched, on 2000's, I liked very much this movie. Nowaydays, surprisingly, I keep on loving it. In fact, I've watched this movie several times since then in South America, whether in Brazil, Argentina, Chile or Uruguay, where it has not been cut or biped. For me it is a kind of piece of art that goes far beyond the intents of merely portrait a branch of a gay identitiy so-called ""Bear homoculture"". Its sensitive approach from the core of bear ideology -- in which gap generation is so important -- transport us to a broader discussion on how postmodern families has been built and established in our era. In my opinion, the director splendidly demonstrated how to dose hipermasculinity, a crucial feature of homossexual bear subculture, through well-taken sexy scenes, with a deeper reflection on how people are behaving and handling contemporary issues like HIV seropositivity. Nevertheless, I've got really surprised when I acquired for the first time a legal copy of it and realized that it has been mutilated by histrionic and hypocrite censorship here in USA. What can I say: It's a pity that it still occurs in the ""home of the braves"", the land of liberty and freedom of speech!",1382054400,,1202,4.839805825242719

2248075,5,B0007XG01S,"This is a Spanish film from 2004 that I have taken a while to see, and I must say I found it worth the wait. It is billed as a comedy drama, but it is also sexually explicit in places and manages to wend its way into your heart, as I ruddy loved it.

It is the story of Pedro (Jose Luis Garcia Perez), who likes Bears, his family know and accept his predilection. His `forward thinking' sister is going on a fifteen day holiday to India to indulge her passion of holistic hippydom. Whilst she and her Significant Other are away she asks her brother to look after his nephew `Bernardo (David Castillo). No sooner has the little lad settled in than his estranged Grand Mother turns up seeking to be a part in her grand sons life (at all costs).

The story then starts to take a few turns which would be plot spoilers to reveal. There was some strong adult content from the start and interspersed throughout, which is why it has the certification. This is not a love story but a human one, and one of the nastier side of human nature as well, but it is all the more real for that. I found it to be totally engrossing and was hooked from about scene one, everyone puts in a brilliant performance and the time (95 mins) just flew by. I actually didn't want it to end I was that caught up in the stories.

It is in Spanish with some French and a smidgen of English, and be warned some of the exchanges are so fast you will need the subtitles, unless your Spanish is excellent.

Director and co-writer Miguel Abaladejo has produced a great little film about big, gay men, with big gay hearts and it is a such a joy to have a film that does not stick to the slavish adoration of  all gay men having to be under twenty five and have spent at least twenty of them either in a gym or exfoliating their chests. If you like this then you should also check out `Boys Town' another great Spanish gay themed film.",1320105600,,1897,4.200549450549451
2248076,5,B0007XG01S,"As simple as that... there should be more about this one.  More stories like this one, because it takes on a fraction of the gay community that doesn't fall in the expected standards, that doesn't lose its masculine side to follow its preferences (at least most of the time).  But there should be more material included in the movie.  The deleted scenes are fun, and I wonder why they were cut, but at least they're there.  Also, the story leaves you wanting to see more about the characters... you can do okay leaving it where the story drops, but it still makes you wonder a bit about everyone involved in the plot, which means it achieves its goal:  To tell a realistic story about a man having to take care of his nephew and how that changes his life style.",1305331200,,761,4.4071428571428575
2248077,4,B0007XG01S,"This movie was both insightful and inspiring. More often than not, gay media tends to focus on the image conscious club kids, or the gym bunnies, and in Bear Cub it touches on another side of the LGBT community: the bears. The film itself is deep and touches on issues from psychological welfare, kids in the gay community and health issues facing today's queer community. The only thing restricting this movie to a 4 star and not a 5 star is the subtitles. I LOVE subtitled movies, but the subtitles in this one move VERY FAST. I literally had to pause the movie a few times to catch up. This draws away from the movie if you need to read all of them. However, this movie was moving enough to make up for the execution of the DVD features.",1298332800,2,740,4.330935251798561
2248078,4,B0007XG01S,"Probably the sweetest single gay film I've seen.  This fish out of water story would have been turned into glossy, sappy glop by Hollywood, but the subtlety of writing and directing, the explicitness and acceptance of promiscuous, unglamorous gay men, and its general humor and humanity raise it well above it's slightly formulaic story.

An aging hippie mom brings her son to stay with her gay brother while she goes off to India with her new lover.  While there she's thrown in prison on drug charges, and the man and boy slowly form a tender father/son like bond.  Meanwhile the boy's estranged grandmother schemes to use this as a chance to force her way into the boy's life.  While that might sound slight or familiar, the details, humanity and fine performances transcend to make something richer, funnier and deeper.",1276214400,,823,4.892086330935252
2248089,3,B0007XG01S,"This is a nice little film about the power of relationships and family.

Wholesome, not simple. Wholesome because of the generous amount of love--yes, some between chubby, hairy gay men--shown in the movie. There are problems; there is intrigue, but there is always love.  And, after viewing so many loveless films, this film was a particular treat.",1212624000,2,650,5.622448979591836

2248094,1,B0007XG01S,"This show could have been so beautiful in the telling of a gay uncle/guardiam and child and I would have rated it 3 stars for the tale if not for the following;

The gay guardian is permissive about drugs, seeing nothing wrong with them personally and the show shows no ill effects of drugs, only positive. He speaks out against his gay friends doing drugs in front of the kid once, but after being chastised by them he forever after allows it, thus sending the message that drugs are cool are good to use. This actually is shown by the child eventually taking drugs himself and all his friends all starting to do it too, again with no ill effects shown, just their euphoria. Am I the only gay man that sees the problem with this highly distructive message?

In addition the gay guardian may be out when it comes to homosexuality but the show suggests you should be secretive and ashamed of everything else, including HIV/AIDS.. and furthermore that you shouldn't tell your partners and that you cannot have a committed partner with AIDS. The uncle /guardian dismisses the one he really loves due to his HIV BUT WITHOUT TELLING HIM WHY, but yet would continue to have casual sex with him. Also by then going and having casual sex in swarmy places before and after he gets worse, he doesn't learn any lessons but instead the film suggests that the HIV/AIDS suffers should simply keeping going and having casual sex, especially when after doing that he gets better. What is this film trying to say? C'mon my fellow gay men, wake up! Don't support something just because it's gay. Make sure it really is good, this film isn't and in fact sets a terrible standard.",1186704000,6,1660,4.585858585858586
2248095,3,B0007XG01S,"Sometimes it lacks of focus on storytelling but it's interesting and symphatetic enough. I didn't like that its showing gay cruise areas as potential blackmail garden.

Anyway, if you bought it, you could watch it twice or thrice and catch subtitles.

2248096,5,B0007XG01S,"I've read the 22 reviews that exist as of this writing (june 2006).  I am so glad the the majority of reviewers have appreciated this amazing film from Spain.  There are plenty of spoilers in the reviews and I wouldn't want to rob new viewers of the joy I had in the story unfolding.  It was a beautiful, well-acted gem from a country that seems to have it more together than here in the United States (I guess nearly 30 years of Almodovar movies will do that).

This movie is not only worth watching but its worth purchasing.

And as for ""robotsloveme"" who hated this film -- I can understand why robots love you.  Because anyone with a pulse would find you insane -- that's the only way I can understand your SO UTTERLY missing the point of this movie.  Was it dubbed wrong for you or something?  I'm fluent in Spanish so maybe I got the original voice.  But your calling this an insulting film for gays and AIDS is ridiculous.  Utterly stupidly ridiculous.  It made me think you must have watched a completely different film then the one I own.

For everyone else, trust the absolute gushing love that the GRAND majority of reviewers have bestowed on this special special film.",1151625600,10,1180,4.488262910798122
2248097,5,B0007XG01S,"I've seen this movie, rented it from my local video store, and loved it very much. I'm assuming since it was a rented copy, what I watched was the rated version. My hats off to Michael Arentz and any other reviewers for telling everyone the difference between versions of movies like this. In a market where the difference between rated and unrated can be anything from a 10 second filler scene to major parts of a movie being cut out, it's often next to impossible to know what your getting. Unfortunately, the editorial section and/or reviews on Amazon rarely tell you the difference between various versions which I believe should practically have it's own section on each of the pages. Now that I know I've probably seen the distributors' presumptuously hacked ""version"" of this wonderful film, I will be buying the true version which the director intended.",1151020800,7,861,4.863945578231292
2248098,3,B0007XG01S,"Bear Cub (Cachorro) tells the story of a gay Spanish dentist who agrees to take care of his nephew while his hippie sister travels to India.  However, when she gets in jail for drug possession, the man is forced to assume responsibility of the child and to battle his nephew's estranged grandma for custody.

The film opens with a pretty explicit credit sequence featuring sex between three gay 'bears' (the hairy, overweight type), but after that the sex quotient dies down to focus on the growing relationship between the protagonist and his 10-year-old nephew.  This is the film's strongest aspect: the scenes between the gay man and his nephew ring true and make you care for the characters.  Unfortunately, the filmmakers seem so intent in going against stereotype that the main character is given too much baggage to pull of convincingly as a full-fledged character, in spite of the best efforts of the actor.  And the filmmakers really screwed things up at the end.  Apparently they didn't know how to solve the conflict they set up, so they came up with a really unsatisfying conclusion.  However, the first 2/3 of the film are great, its only during the last twenty to thirty minutes that the movie falls apart.

Its good to see a movie where none of the gay characters are obsessed with fashion and going to the gym.  But the most interesting aspect of the movie is the film's take on gay parenting.  While most U.S. gay media tries to present gay couples as essentially straight clones to convince people that they make good parents, this movie refuses to do that.  The main character doesn't really want to be a father (though the child grows on him), turns down the chance to settle down as a couple (with a nice, responsible man he loves), and (despite initial hesitation) refuses to give up his lifestyle (uncommited sex, visits to bathhouses, pickups in bars and under bridges).  And yet, he remains an excellent (if realistically imperfect) father figure and a more caring and responsible alternative to the child's mom and grandma.

Be warned that although the sex is tame by foreign movie standards, there are a couple of strong scenes (especially the credit sequence).",1146528000,13,2188,4.833780160857909

2248110,5,B0007XG01S,"Very simply, the reason I loved this movie is because it was such a sweet depiction of life involving a man who happened to be gay.  He and his buddies are bear types.  It was great to see a gay movie about real sexy manly type people instead of unattainable pretty boys.  I highly recommend it.",1142208000,7,295,4.232142857142857
2248111,5,B0007XG01S,"Having just finished ""Cachorro"", I'm left with goosebumps. There is no way a movie of this depth could have been made in America. The reason being that homosexuality isn't vilified or degraded, and actually shows gay men caring about each other.

***Spoilers ahead*** The plot centers around a gay man, Pedro, and HIV positive dentist, who is left in charge with his 9 year old nephew, Bernardo, while his widowed sister heads of to India for a 'vacation'. Instead, she is jailed for drug trafficking and Pedro is put into a precarious situation. He's grown close to his nephew, and has to deal with an estranged grandmother who it seems will stop at nothing to gain custody of the grandchild she never knew.

I can't comment on the edited theatrical release, but the DVD release treats gay sexuality in a pretty straightforward manner, no pun intended. There are sex scenes, but they're not out of line with what I'd expect from progressive European cinema. We are instead treated to a closely knit social group who rally behind Pedro and Bernardo. The movie ends neatly with a few surprises that I will not reveal here.

There is a strong message of family throughout the movie. We see it in the relationship between Pedro and Bernardo, as well as with the other outstanding cast members. I must say that I was a bit taken aback by the casual drug use in the movie. It's just not my scene, but we do see Pedro move away from them throughout the film.

All in all, a wonderful effort by writer/director Miguel Albaladejo. The principal cast is terrific here, led by Jose Luis Garcia Perez as Pedro and David Castillo as Bernardo. What a treat! Recommended!",1138406400,,1657,4.683848797250859
2248112,3,B0007XG01S,"Spanish film has 30-year-old gay dentist taking in his young nephew after his sister gets into legal trouble; the kid isn't particularly curious about his uncle's lifestyle, but the grandmother wants him out of the house anyway. After a sexy opening scene (which puzzlingly has little to do with the rest of the picture), this light drama settles into a disappointingly formulaic pattern. The dentist and his stocky, hairy friends have a happy-go-lucky rapport which is infectious, but there's not enough of them (one deleted sequence with the gang hanging out should've been part of the theatrical release). The dentist's health woes and the boy's guardian problems are sketchy (at best), and, after the opening scene, the homosexual content seems to get a bit timid. More insight in this man's lifestyle and the friends who love and support him would've made this a more satisfying film. B-",1137542400,2,892,5.074829931972789
2248113,4,B0007XG01S,"The real important aspect about ""Bear Cub"" is not just that it is a decent movie that combines emotional aspects and bonding as important factors of family life. The real breakthrough is that the gay characters are not the usual stereotypes that films have been foisting on us for the last 20 years.

The man are all good looking but average. The ""bear"" subculture that subscribes to the idea that gay men don't have to be gym-bunnies or ""fabulous"" in order to gain acceptance is prominent in ""Bear Cub,"" much to the film's credit. The gay men aren't comedic foils that mince around and camp to the delight of the straight (and often female) lead. A disco or bar is not the central meeting place for the characters. AIDS is a prominent feature in the plot, but it isn't a tragedy. And while sex and drugs are also prominent, it is also NOT an major focus in anybody's existence here.

In other words, as a gay movie, ""Bear Cub"" does almost nothing that other gay-themed movies of recent vintage would expect you to prepare yourself for. The characters advance along the story-line without flaming theatrics. Even the villainess in the film has dimension, even if she is a misguided old bat. In fact, the only thing that kept me from giving this bitter-sweet and lightly funny movie a fifth star is that I thought the ending to be a bit soft and unresolved. But along with the recently released ""Brokeback Mountain,"" ""Bear Cub"" at last presents gay folk (and woofy bears!) in a manner of men that live realistic, everyday lives.",1135987200,5,1527,4.630996309963099
2248114,2,B0007XG01S,"From watching the trailers, Bear Cub appears to be a heart warming, goofy story of a party loving ""bear"" suddenly stuck with a kid to take care of. Don't be fooled - Bear Cub is, unfortunately, yet another sappy, underdeveloped, depressing gay-themed movie. The story felt extremely rushed & the character development was just plain weak. I do applaud the film for attempting to display a unique slice of life, but its delivery of the bear subculture (and of gay culture in general) was narrow, stereotypical, and borderline insulting. Similarly, the film's light treatment of the issue of AIDS was thinly explored and almost insensitive. Honestly, the only thing I enjoyed about the movie was the eye candy of the cast; there are good lookin' dudes crawling all over the place. But I need more than just good looks, beards, and flannel shirts to truly engage me in a movie. Bear Cub didn't do it for me.",1132704000,6,904,4.764331210191083
2248115,5,B0007XG01S,"This DVD was recommended to me by my very close friend ""Tobes"" from the UK. We talked about the DVD a few times, until I finally gave in and purchased it on amazon. Well...I most certainly don't regret buying it, because from start to finish, my partner & I really got into the movie. Neither of us expected it to be half as good as it turned out. I guess the English Subtitles & quick Spanish dialogue was hard to follow, but we got the picture and I cried half-way through the film, directly to th end. The film is all about wisdom & courage (Which many gay & hetero men in real life are lacking). I even questioned myself on how ready I'd be if I were in the same situation. People nowadays take for granted the things we so dearly need in life (family values, patience, love, understanding & honesty).

Bearcub is sure to capture & warm most viewer's hearts with its sweet but non-saccharine charm and realistic, every-day ups and downs. The setting mainly takes place in Pedro's apartment, located in Spain. Pedro (Jos Luis Garca Prez) is a single gay man whose lifestyle is open and party-oriented. He's a dentist and feels intruded upon when his sister Violeta (Elvira Lindo) dumps her son Bernardo (David Castillo) on him, supposedly for 2 weeks, while she goes on vacation. From the start, it's obvious both Pedro & Bernardo are unhappy with the sudden change. But soon enough, they bond and rely on one another's company and affection.

All through the movie, ""Bears"" are evident in the movie...as the movie is themed on ""Bears"". Being a Bear myself, I thought it was cute and only natural for masculine, natural, bearded, large-framed men to partake in the movie. The scenes in which Pedro is showing Bernardo a good time are so cute and playful. Pedro definitely makes a great Uncle, no matter what he or Bernardo is going through. I liked the lighter parts of the movie, where Bernardo's babysitter Lola (Diana Cerezo) shows him a good time, and the part where Pedro cuts Bernardo's hair with the clipper. It's really cute and shows how easily adjusted this 9 year-old boy becomes to change.

Unfortunately, Bernardo's Grandmother Doa Teresa (Empar Ferrer) enters the scene and spoils the bond between Uncle and Nephew, thereby breaking them apart in every way possible. During this time, she desparately tries to turn her grandson against his Uncle, disapproving of his lifestyle and their living conditions. Toward the end of the movie, she lies to Bernardo about his Uncle's health (H.I.V. infection). Due to certain circumstances, Bernardo has to leave his Uncle, alone and unhappy, until he reaches the age of 14. Until then, he moves to Valencia, Spain, to continue his education in a bording school.
In the end, the movie takes on a suprise ending and Dona Teresa passes away, enabling Bernardo to return home to Pedro's residence. It's a very touching, suprising ending, which confused me for a while.

Having seen this movie twice, it helps me appreciate my lifestyle more, and it reminds me not to take for granted, the things I've been given, including my health & other most important things. If you plan on purchasing the ""Unrated"" version, there are some brief ""explicit"" parts in the beginning & toward the end. It's nothing to be ashamed of, though. This is a fantastic gift and I highly recommend the unrated version because it's about 10 minutes longer than the rated version.",1131408000,6,3407,4.759729272419627
2248116,5,B0007XG01S,"This film, is Spanish with English subtitles, is one of the best gay-themed-- whatever that means-- movies I've seen in the past few years. The plot is straight forward. Violeta, on her way to India, drops off her nine-year-old son Bernardo to stay with his gay Uncle Pedro in Madrid for a couple of weeks until she returns. She manages to get herself thrown in prison for possession of drugs and the plot, as they say, thickens. The central conflict is all about who gets ultimate custody of Bernardo, his gay uncle or his deceased father's mother.

This unpretentious movie has a lot going for it. The acting, particularly that of Jose Luis Garcia-Perez (Pedro) and David Castillo who plays his nephew, is quite good. When you think you've got the plot figured out, you find out you're wrong. At a place or two in the movie-- the first time around-- your heart will be in your throat. Almost all the men in the film belong to the ""bear cult,"" so it's quite refreshing to see men for a change with less than perfect bodies who could be someone you know down the street. Additionally, a movie that says that gay people can be good parents is certainly worth seeing as pyschologist after psychologist keep saying that in spite of the ranting of the religious right, at least in these United States.

One problem I had with the DVD edition is that one has to be a speed reader to catch all the subtitles. I do not remember having that reaction with I saw BEAR CUB in the theatre.

2248118,4,B0007XG01S,"The 2004 film ""Bear Cub"" (a.k.a., ""Cachorro"" in Spanish) was produced and filmed in Spain.  The film is about a gay man named Pedro (Jos Luis Garca Prez) who lives alone in Madrid, but enjoys spending time with his numerous gay friends.  Being a robust man, Pedro is commonly referred to as a ""bear"" in the gay community.  One day, Pedro is visited by his sister Violeta (Elvira Lindo), who asks Pedro is he would be willing to look after her son Bernardo (David Castillo) while she and her boyfriend travel to India on a vacation.  Pedro agrees and cleans up his apartment before Bernardo comes to stay.  Bernardo, naturally, is somewhat concerned about his mother traveling overseas; but his fears are magnified because he knows of his mother's drug habits that might get her into trouble.  Pedro is also concerned and when he receives a call from a Spanish government authority, he immediately pays a visit to the Indian embassy to find out that Violeta and her boyfriend had been arrested and imprisoned on drug possession charges.  Pedro decides that he will raise Bernardo, but Bernardo's estranged grandmother, Doa Teresa (Empar Ferrer), sees this as an opportunity to spend time with Bernardo herself.  (Violeta and Doa Teresa, Violeta's mother-in-law, never got along.)  When Doa Teresa has an attorney contact Pedro that she wants Bernardo in a private boarding school, Pedro initially rejects the idea; but his H.I.V. infection and pictures of some of his night-time activities taken by a private detective hired by Doa Teresa, force him to give in to Doa Teresa's demands.  Bernardo is, naturally, very angry with Doa Teresa and misses his mother terribly, but adjusts to life at the boarding school and his limited visits with Pedro; but things eventually change.

""Bear Cub"" is an endearing and engaging story that is sure to capture most viewers' hearts.  The film won the ""Best Film from Europe"" award from the Montral World Film Festival and actor Jos Luis Garca Prez was nominated by the Goya Award in Spain for the ""Best New Actor"" award.  Overall, I rate the film with 4 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.",1125273600,3,2130,4.850828729281768
2248149,4,B0007XG01S,I really liked this movie it had a bit of everything for everyone.  It had gay elements and also a family story.  I know you will like this one.,1124668800,7,144,3.9310344827586206
2248150,5,B0007XG01S,"This was seriously my favorite ""gay"" genre movie i've ever seen. It gives an honest look into the bear/cub sub-culture of gay men and isn't all about sex and drugs (although they are included).",1124496000,5,193,4.705882352941177
2248151,5,B0007XG01S,"This is how a ""gay"" film should be done. It shows every aspect of our lifestyle. Admittedly the subtitles can be a bit hard to keep up with, but this is one of those rare films that reveals more and more to the viewer each time it is seen. At times touching, brilliantly funny, and incredibly sad. Without spoiling the ending for anyone who hasn't seen it, all works out quite well by the closing scenes. And the lead character - the dentist - is perhaps the most strikingly handsome men I have ever seen on film. Very well acted. Directed with a deft touch, nothing is too obvious or over the top. The script is wonderful.  Bear Cub, I must say, is not for everyone - the opening ten minutes of the film make you wonder if this is nothing more than soft core gay porn, but it has its reasons for being that way, to show the lifestyle in a honest and quite frank way. A real treat, and the rare film that shows the life of a gay man without falling into  cliche or camp. Hats off also to the young actor who plays the ""cub"" in the title - he possesses a sensivity and range of emotion very rarely seen in an actor of his age. A very sharp and well thought out movie - perhaps the best I've seen in years. A real keeper, and a movie ew in the community can be very proud of.",1122768000,7,1273,4.067729083665339
2248152,5,B0007XG01S,"Bear Cub is a family story of a successful dentist (Pedro) who happens to be a gay bear who finds himself responsible for his 9-year-old nephew, Bernardo. Pedro tries his best to be a good parent to Bernardo, and right when they both start bonding, a disgruntled grandparent shows up and tries to separate the two through blackmail and other unethical means.

Throughout this drama, the characters face issues like AIDS, single parenting, friendship, sex, HIV-phobia, corruption, drugs, prison, love and ultimately the meaning of family.

What's great about this film is that it's real thanks largely to a superb screenplay, stellar performances and outstanding direction. No issue is overly dramatized or underplayed. Emotions are raw and uncensored. The intensity level is just right that watching the film seemed like witnessing a slice of reality; Pedro's reality.

To completely enjoy this film, it helps if you speak Spanish. The dialogue is fast-paced and the subtitles move so quickly. That was the only annoyance I had, but it's still a very minor annoyance :-)

This movie is a testament of why I love foreign films. When we use special effects to awe moviegoers, they use artistry and realism. I take artsy realism any day of the week, and if you do too, you should definitely check Bear Cub out!",1121817600,6,1307,4.981651376146789
2248153,5,B0007XG01S,"BEAR CUB (CACHORRO) is a delight!  This joyous film has the wisdom (and courage, if US standards are applied!) to open the doors and windows depicting a segment of the gay population who are healthy in attitude, in lasting relationships and friendships, and who don't swerve from addressing issues such as AIDS, single parenting, recreational dalliances, the dangers of drugs, and the importance of family.  It is honest in dialogue, in casting, and in demonstrating that all people are subjected to the same ups and downs, no matter their sexual proclivity.

Pedro (Jos&eacute; Luis Garc&iacute;a P&eacute;rez) is a successful dentist, a warmly human man who is surrounded by caring friends - primarily men who call themselves 'bears', a subunit of the gay population identified by hairy faces and bodies, stout husky physiques instead of the usual gay image of the perfectly carved gym body, and a live-and-let-live philosophy of upfront honesty, warmth and caring for their extended families.  Pedro is openly gay, a fact that his widowed sister Violeta (Elvira Lindo) and her 9-year old son Bernardo (David Castillo) happily accept.  When Violeta and her current paramour Borja (Cali Caballero) decide to vacation in India, Bernardo is left with Pedro for the promised two week stay.

During their time together Pedro and Bernardo bond, Bernardo is introduced to Pedro's friends and is entirely comfortable by the healthy relationships he sees.  Pedro is not partnered (his lover Eduardo died...) but he dates openly with Bernardo's knowledge. When Pedro is in his Dental Office, baby sitter Lola (Diana Cerezo) introduces Bernardo to go-go and other parts of the world outside and becomes a happy trio with the two males. News comes that Violeta and Borja have been arrested in India for drug trafficking, changing the two-week vacation into a time indefinite absence.  Pedro and Bernardo adjust.

Things take a turn when Bernardo's estranged grandmother Do&ntilde;a Teresa (Empar Ferrer) enters the scene, haughty, disapproving of Bernardo's living situation, and taking advantage of the absence of her hated daughter-in-law to attempt to gain custody of Bernardo, 'the only thing I have left in life.'

Due to some unfortunate twists of behavior and fate, Do&ntilde;a Teresa gains evidence to blackmail Pedro, not only because of his sexual outings photographed by her investigator, but because she discovers Pedro is HIV positive.  In her attempts to denounce Pedro we discover the Bernardo already knows of his uncle's HIV status (as well as Violeta's) and Bernardo pleads with Pedro not to let Do&ntilde;a Teresa take him away.  A compromise is reached and Bernardo is sent off to a coed school in Valencia.

How all of these twists and turns resolve constitutes the surprising ending of this excellent film: each of the characters is shown to be wholly three-dimensional, even Do&ntilde;a Teresa, and the overriding importance of family and compassion and love rules the day.  The ending is open ended, allowing the viewer to select the way to conclude the story.

Director and co-writer (with Salvador Garc&iacute;a Ruiz) Miguel Albaladejo is a master at finding the core of truth in each of his characters, their individual life styles, and the unfettered joy of living uncompromised lives.  The cast is extraordinary: Jos&eacute; Luis Garc&iacute;a P&eacute;rez is a natural actor, David Castillo is completely believable as Bernardo, and the remainder of the cast is outstanding. The original music by Nacho Canut and Olvido Gara is so in keeping with the tone of the film.  Yes, there are some consensual sex scenes in this film, but they are treated with respect and decorum and without them the flavor of the film would be lacking.  This is a refreshing film about the sanctity of love - and it just happens to be populated with one of the most lovable gay groups ever created!  Highly recommended.

2248154,4,B0007XG01S,"BEAR CUB is a really wonderful film, but to respond to Jeffrey of Ill., there was a ""bear"" film made in 2003 called ""A BEAR'S STORY"". It is a short. It has been playing in film festivals all around the world for the past 2 years, but has not been released on DVD as of yet. It is a contempory coming-of-fur story about a man who discovers the bear community after not fitting into the ""gay lifestyle"" that is so prevalent. I truly hope you get to see it in some film fest someday or hopefully catch it on DVD when it finally is released. It has won a few festival awards. It will play next in August 2005 at the first Vermont Bear Film Festival and then this fall in Norway. You can check out the web site for news on showings [...] Until then buy BEAR CUB and enjoy. Why do I know so much about ""A BEAR'S STORY""? I am one of the leads. Hope you like it.",1117065600,6,854,4.0
2248155,5,B0007XG01S,"It usually takes a foreign film to successfully take on human issues that Americans avoid.  ""Bear Cub"" is full of real characters with real emotions.  These include the lead (Pedro), a determinedly single gay dentist, his liberal `hippie' sister, her educated well-adjusted son, a meddling grandmother and a cast of friends that could be the `gang' over for a football game.  Pedro takes care of his nephew while his sister takes an unexpectedly delayed vacation.  Although he tries to change his lifestyle for the child, he realizes there is no need.  His friends take to the child as anyone's uncle would and all seems great.  Of course, real life needs to interrupt this simple event and soon misunderstood feelings and good intentions make for a heartbreaking mix.  Suffice it to say that ""Bear Cub"" is full of mild twists and surprises enough to give it a world-class appearance.  Most Americans will be surprised at the openness of the playful affection between the men, but that soon fades as the more important issues start unraveling.  With an even balance of comedy, drama and love, ""Bear Cub"" rises above most of its genre.  This is one of those rare movies that show us a wonderfully human slice of life that is all around, yet private enough to portray it in an honest and respectful manner.",1117065600,9,1304,4.807174887892376
2248156,5,B0007XG01S,"""Cachorro"" (""Bear Cub"") is a touching and original 2004 comedy-drama from Spain.  The director/co-writer explains his goals for the film in notes included in the DVD extras, and his idea was quite ambitious:  to deviate from the usual type of gay lead character, and give us someone who doesn't have a ""queer eye"" on fashion, isn't a straight woman's roommate or best friend, has HIV but doesn't have the ""victim"" mentality about it, doesn't live for the gym or circuit parties, doesn't have problems accepting himself or telling others he is gay, and isn't desperate to get into a monogamous relationship, being pretty happy with his life as it stands.  Taking it a step further, the lead character, Pedro, a middle-class dentist, is a ""bear"" ... part of the gay male subculture of mostly hairy, affectionate, easygoing men that is almost ignored in films and TV shows.

Pedro's world changes when his widowed hippie sister, Violetta, arrives with her 9 year old son Bernando (played wonderfully by young actor David Castillo), whom she has arranged to leave with Pedro while on a two week holiday to India with her boyfriend.  Pedro isn't too crazy about the idea, but resigns himself to pretty much put his life on hold for a couple of weeks and play babysitter, but he is soon impressed by his young nephew's energy and positive outlook on life, and a mutual respect and love grows between them.  When Violetta gets imprisoned for an indefinite time in India on a drug charge ... to quote the films tagline ... ""parenthood gets a bit hairier"" when it becomes obvious that their arrangement may become permanent. Pedro's ""bear buddies"" come around and throw a surprise party to cheer up Bernando after the news about his mother, and one babysits afterward so Pedro can go out cruising and end his sexual fast.  Unfortunately, his ""night out"" sets up a scenario that could take Bernando away from Pedro, and into the hands of his estranged paternal grandmother, whom the boy does not like.

The film is more of a drama than a comedy, but has its amusing moments and situations.  It also has nudity and some simulated sex*, but nothing I would consider extraneous to the flow of the story (If you view the DVD extras, you'll see why two scenes were excised, which were a bit too ""over the top"").  It's in Spanish with English subtitles, which unfortunately are tough to follow because the story is dialogue-intensive and the characters talk very fast (I had to reverse the DVD a few times, then pause to read subtitles that went by too fast to read).  Much recommended.

* Note that the DVD comes in ""R"" and ""Not rated"" versions, with the latter being 8 minutes longer.",1116028800,5,2670,4.730603448275862
2248157,5,B0007XG01S,"I recently emailed the company that's releasing the DVD and asked them what the differences between the R-rated and Unrated version were. This is strait from them... ""The difference is that there are two sex scenes removed from the U.S. theatrical version for the MPAA. We included the Unrated version to satisfy the director's original vision."" Also, there will be NO English dubbed audio track. Only Spanish audio and English subtitles. I hope this answers the questions of people that are as curious about this kind of stuff as I am. :^) Take care!!",1114041600,66,552,4.882978723404255
2248158,4,B0007XG01S,"If the bear movement started in the United States, then how did Spain beat us at making a bear film? Moreover, it was quality and worked on sooooo many levels. If I ever met the cast and crew, I would bow to the ground and kiss their feet

Technically, this wasn't a movie about bears. In this movie, however and fortunately, bears are at the center. There is no bearphobia, unlike gay films such as ""Parting Glances"" and ""Mishima: A Life in Four Acts.""  I must admit though that I was surprised that a man with a huge appendicitis scar was chosen as the lead. That just shows how European casting associates aren't afraid to pick actors that their American counterparts wouldn't touch.

Like so many recent gay productions, this is about how gays interact with straights, especially their straight relatives. Where ""Ellen"", ""Kiss Me Guido"", and John Goodman's bad sitcom failed, this movie succeeds. Unlike ""The Disappearance of Garcia Lorca"" and the universally-panned ""The Next Best Thing,"" this film didn't cast gays to the side in order to push the heterosexual main narrative along either. The whole line about ""being gay, but not just being gay"" resonated here.

I guess in Spain that cliche about animals and child actors doesn't apply. The boy in this film was beating the hell out of this role. I hope he is nominated for Spain's Oscar or Cesar equivalent. Big props to him. Maybe he'll be the next Garcia Bernal, even though GB just stepped on the scene.

I'm a member of the ""happy endings for homosexuals"" club. It just broke my heart seeing the main character dump the bear pilot that wanted to be with him. I guess I'm so used to American films where the main character always has a devoted partner by the end of the film. Man, this dude could have had a constant companion to care for him as he faced you can guess what. Instead, he makes poor choices which will cause his downfall and may hurt others.

One character was kinda lispy, but otherwise, the Spanish here didn't differ much to New World Spanish, at least to my gringo ears. I didn't hear anyone say ""vosotros."" There are scenes where the main character and his dumpee, a pilot in Paris, speak French but the audience is never told that code-switching is going on. Coco Fusco and other Latin Americans have said that learning French is a sign of being cultured. Spain is multiracial just like the US, Britain, or France. I wish there could have been a bear of color in this film.",1112054400,18,2456,4.608695652173913
