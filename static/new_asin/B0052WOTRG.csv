8454645,5,B0052WOTRG,i love this group and getting to see the background of the tour and inside what these guys do was pretty cool....if you like their music then you should see this video. its not a live show taped at once but over time at several places,1455235200,,234,4.108695652173913
8454646,3,B0052WOTRG,"i don't know. i love this band and have since their first album came out but ""...we're from winnipeg""  is just ok. to call this a documentary / rocumentary is a bit of a stretch to me. this is, basically, a ""live"" dvd with quick interview segments separating each performance. the fault in these segments is that besides being extremely brief, they're also pretty devoid of interesting information. you don't really get a whole lot of insight in to the band, their history or even the tour they're currently embarked on. they all come off as genuinely nice dudes that really enjoy what they do but that's about it.

as for the ""live"" stuff, the song selection is great. it's a nice mix of material spanning their entire discography. the footage is very well shot. my biggest problem with it is that the audio is clearly not pulled directly from the actual performances you're watching. if i had to venture a guess, i'd say one show was recorded and the audio from that was placed over footage from each city. i found this to be pretty distracting because there are some pretty obvious (and some not so obvious) sync issues. drums frequently don't match up or you'll hear a harmony but your tv says only john is singing. for me, this caused a disconnect between what i was hearing and what i was seeing. it's something i noticed within 15 seconds of the first ""live"" song. it just didn't feel ""live.""",1426291200,2,1399,4.569721115537849
8454647,5,B0052WOTRG,"The Rolling Tundra tour was amazing to watch in person in Vancouver, yet even more enjoyable to see my wife and I in the video multiple times during pamphlateer.  If only I could see them live again if they ever tour outside of Eastern Canada.
Thanks again JKS

8454648,5,B0052WOTRG,Great insight to a pretty cool band. Although all of this film was shot in Canada I'm pretty sure I saw them around the time they did this film. I mention this because I live in Sunny Orlando Florida. Saw them downtown at The Social. Great show! Anybody remember them doing a sidetrack tour to Florida? They had just released Reunion Tour. Anyway get the DVD its everything I thought it would be and more.,1360713600,,405,4.413333333333333
