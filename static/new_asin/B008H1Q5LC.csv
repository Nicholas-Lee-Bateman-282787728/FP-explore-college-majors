5161507,3,B008H1Q5LC,not a bad film...story not very factual ..there are many books that give a lot more accurate accounts of their lives...,1400544000,,119,4.714285714285714
5161508,5,B008H1Q5LC,"Great movie....fantastic acting....They did a fantastic job playing Bud & Lou, I believe they did an excellent job showing the inner life of these great comedians and the hell that Bud went through to really keep this team together.",1393286400,,232,4.9743589743589745
5161509,4,B008H1Q5LC,I really enjoyed watching this movie.  I know that it was a TV Movie back in the day but I missed it when it was televised.  I had always wanted to see this and was very glad to find it on Amazon.  I found this movie to be quite poignant.,1390176000,,238,3.72
5161510,2,B008H1Q5LC,"I suppose being a huge fan of Abbott and Costello I am put off by the bad reenactment of their routines. The ""Who's on First?"" skit was almost sad but only the originals could have done it right. Buddy Hackett was really bad as Costello. He is a baaaaaad actor. Only Harvey Korman's Abbott made this movie watchable.",1388188800,,316,4.4655172413793105
5161511,3,B008H1Q5LC,This film from the '70s was ok.  I thought the film one dimensional.  More was focused on Lou vs. Bud.  Also I have seen Buddy Hackett do better.  It would be great if someone did an updated version of Bud and Lou.  My opinion is half the story was left out about these two.,1380672000,2,274,4.0
5161512,2,B008H1Q5LC,Not accurate - a better film is needed. Lou is portrayed as a bitter jerk pre-death of his child > he was not so.,1366156800,,113,3.75
5161513,5,B008H1Q5LC,if you want a perfect match for abbot and Costello here it is don't get no better buddy Hackett and Harvey korman are priceless story was great about their homelife and pro life just a great movie all around,1364601600,,207,4.333333333333333
5161514,5,B008H1Q5LC,"What more can I say, than Bud and Lou are the templates of some of the greatest comedians today.  My kids watched this DVD and immediately found a common connection with the comedians they laugh at today.  My Husband and I have plenty of memories of Bud and Lou and find it a true pleasure getting the opportunity of having this on a easily obtainable and affordable DVD special.",1352246400,,379,4.478260869565218
5161515,4,B008H1Q5LC,"I watched this TV movie growing up and was anxious to finally see it again all these years later on DVD.  I really like both Harvey Korman and Buddy Hackett and they do good jobs as Abbott and Costello.  The movie starts a little slow but gets better after they become big stars and ends on a very sad note as the IRS enters the picture and audits the boys, causing them to lose their homes and money.  It's a sad ending to a great comedy team.  The only reason that I gave this movie 4 stars instead of 5 is because even though Korman and Hackett do a good job, they don't do so good recreating ""Who's on First?"" and other skits.  Buddy Hackett tries so hard to imitate Costello's voice during ""Who's on First?"" that the rapid fire routine is reduced to a very slow routine.  The comedy sketches were hard for me to watch because I know how fast Abbott and Costello delivered their lines.  That quickness is what made them so great and it's painful to watch it recreated at such a slow pace. Fortunately, not many of their skits are recreated. If you like Abbott and Costello, you should check this TV movie out.  Harvey Korman and Buddy Hackett do a good job.",1350864000,2,1161,4.293577981651376
5161516,5,B008H1Q5LC,"Based on the book ""BUD AND LOU:THE ABBOTT AND COSTELLO STORY"" by Bob Thomas, and directed by Robert C. Thompson this comedy/drama follows Abbott and Costello (Harvey Korman, Buddy Hackett) from their modest start in vaudeville through their early radio success and, utlimately, to their stardom as motion picture and televison stars.",1350777600,,333,5.423076923076923
8527879,1,B008H1Q5LC,"I tried to re-watch this yesterday. It was disappointing and painful, IMO. This review has spoilers. I watched the  a&c routines. Totally not funny and there no timing. In the film Lou comes across as bitter and insecure. I wish it was better. I can't watch it again.",1524528000,,267,4.5625
8527880,4,B008H1Q5LC,"Nice biopic, with Hackett and Korman doing a great job as A&C.  Highly recommended!",1506124800,,83,4.928571428571429
8527881,2,B008H1Q5LC,"I've been a big fan of Abbott and Costello since I was a little boy, so I was excited about seeing this movie.  Alas, I was disappointed in a number of ways.  The movie attempts to contrast their public image as comedians with their often-rocky relationship behind the scenes.  Many of Lou Costello's friends concede that he was not always easy to work with, and he became increasingly difficult after the death of his son.  Bud Abbott was generally more easygoing than his partner, but his drinking problem often made him unreliable.  Needless to say, this made for quite a few fireworks between them.  The movie brings out these issues quite well, but in my opinion, it neglects the brighter aspects of their relationship.  The result is an unbalanced movie that's too easy on Bud and too hard on Lou.

The movie gives a lot of attention to their famous 1945 rift, and suggests that they never really recovered from it.  The facts speak otherwise.  Their popularity endured well into the early 1950's, when they were eclipsed by Martin and Lewis.  The movie depicts their final split in 1956 as rancorous, and gives the impression that the two men never spoke to each other again.  Other sources, however, say the 1956 breakup was friendly, and that they kept in touch after they stopped working together.  It is a fact that Abbott was shattered when he heard the news of Costello's death, and was an honorary pallbearer at his funeral.  Not long after Costello died, Abbott tried out a new comedy act with a different partner, but he soon gave it up.  His reason: ""No one could ever live up to Lou.""

The most disappointing parts of the movie are the attempts to re-create Abbott and Costello's comedy.  They were famous for taking tired old vaudeville routines and breathing new life into them.  Alas, Harvey Korman and Buddy Hackett just couldn't seem to pull it off.  Their performance of the legendary ""Who's on first?"" routine is downright depressing.  Overall, it's an interesting movie with very few laughs, but I suggest viewers take it with a very healthy dose of salt.  According to people who knew the real Abbott and Costello, this movie takes quite a few liberties with the facts.",1454544000,,2196,4.741424802110818

8527883,3,B008H1Q5LC,Fun to.watch but at.times.difficult. I am sure that Lou Costello.was a nicer. Man than this movie implies. But Buddy Hackett and Harvey Korman did great work.with the less thAn great script.,1442534400,,190,5.161290322580645
8527884,3,B008H1Q5LC,"When I first heard about this back in 1978 I was so very excited. After watching it on TV I was a bit disappointed. Where was Bud's wife? Where were their children? Turns our that Betty Abbott (Bud's wife) did NOT approve of the script and subsequently was written out of the film completely. There were some things that were incorrect, which made the 'bio-pic' a disappointment to me.
In MY opinion, there should've been a 6 hour 3 night presentation (2 hours each night). The first hour would be Bud's life until he meets Lou. The second hour should be Lou's life. Third hour would be their early career together. Fourth hour would be their rise to fame. Fifth hour would be the breakup and Lou's death. The final hour would be Bud's life after Lou's death and his final moments.
They could've explored some very interesting things that happened to both of them.
Maybe someone at Universal will read this and put something together. They should start with Lou's daughter Chris Costello's book, 'Lou's On First'.",1418601600,,1013,4.696629213483146
8527885,4,B008H1Q5LC,"Where Buddy Hackett was a decent choice for his comic abilities (although facially he tends to come off more crazed, rather than Costello's sweet puppydog look), he was truly awful dramatically. It is Korman and Lee's performances, both comically and dramatically, that raise the bar for this film. Unfortunately, the 'made for t.v' cinematography is a drawback, and one is left feeling like something is missing...wait, perhaps it's Abbott's wife of over 50 years who only gets a ridiculously brief mention?? You can see how they pushed the movie towards more of a portrayal of Costello's life, with Abbott as a bit of a sideline, but Korman never lets his presence or performance resign to it. Again, the straight man is quietly essential to the story! It's too bad the work wasn't received better, but I blame Hackett, and whoever didn't notice that there wasn't much chemistry between Korman and Hackett, no matter how they may have tried. I'm easy to please though. If it's got Harvey in it I'm sold, so, don't listen to me!!",1415404800,2,1030,4.857954545454546
8527886,3,B008H1Q5LC,"I hesitated giving this a three. I like Bud and Lou (the real ones) so much even a flawed film like this still can provide enjoyment. Buddy Hackett gave an outstanding performance. As he subsequently said edited out many scenes that would have better explained things, thus causing Lou to look bad. Other things like saying Lou had Rheumatic fever when a child when he contracted it in 1943 shows they did not do any research. Most of the problems were over stated and many truly great moments never mentioned. Lou did not blame his wife for his son's death. Lou and Bud had great marriages and both had families that were loving (each were the godparents of the others children). Their agent was not the great guy this film projects. Maybe it should be a two star?",1413158400,,765,4.550724637681159
8527887,3,B008H1Q5LC,this film didn't really tell the true story about Lou.,1410220800,,54,4.5
8527888,5,B008H1Q5LC,It was great movie the only thing wrong was then never Lou Daughters and Bud Wife Wife & Children,1407456000,,97,4.157894736842105
