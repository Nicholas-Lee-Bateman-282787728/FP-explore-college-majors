8687980,3,B00PHK6LJW,"Good movie, Dana Brown's commentary is weak. Story does not develop well and too much footage was used from other sources and has been seen before. Especially a lot of the Robbie Maddox footage as well as a lot of the GP footage and interviews. Fun movie, but no where near the original which is what all movies get judged by.. Even after over 40 years it is still a great movie to watch..",1425254400,,389,4.27027027027027
