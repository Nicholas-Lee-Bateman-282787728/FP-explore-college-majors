The story is captivating, the soundtrack is original and varied and the characters engage the children and encourage them to get up and dance, which my children and their friends never fail to do!

Also, we have given the Music Box as a present many times and it's an all-time favorite for kids of both genders.

GREAT JOB!!!!",1235952000,16,471,4.329545454545454

3052724,5,B0010WDQ9E,"We've had this movie for about 2 years, and my girls ADORE it. I was a little worried it would be too advanced for my daughter when I bought it, but it never felt like too much for her, even at 2.  A few weeks ago, I brought it up to my in-law's cottage as a just-in-case-of-rain activity for my girls and my nieces.  They are 5, 4, almost 3, and 2.  They are busy energetic kiddos, and sometimes the 5-year-old is ""too cool for school"" and will reject things my 4-year-old loves because ""that's for little kids.""  Well, she decided she didn't want to watch the movie.  As soon as the ""confetti"" screen showed up as the kids were falling into the music box (a few minutes in), she abandoned her pony coloring book - maybe I DO want to watch that!  5 minutes later, she was dancing with the rest of them, and it held all 4 girls' attention for the entire movie.  (Despite some borderline hyperactivity).  Then they watched & danced it again!

The production values may not be perfect, but the dancing is a great mix, the music not at all annoying to parents, and it ends with a crazy dance party.  (My oldest's favorite part!)",1347321600,2,1125,4.314285714285714

I believe their fascination with this video is due to its presentation of a gentle magical storyline combined with learning tools: easy to follow repetitive instructions on the various dance genres.  I wonder whether my nephew's fearless ability to dance even by himself in front of crowds is due to the encouragement the characters in this video provide.",1338249600,2,526,4.758241758241758

I have to admit, I got drawn it too, and my son and I watched it from beginning to end.  Great story and dancing.  The original music is well produced and so catchy that after one or two views, you'll be humming right along.  Very educational and entertaining. I highly recommend it!",1337644800,,449,4.235294117647059
3052727,5,B0010WDQ9E,"This DVD arrived yesterday. My daughter was a bit bored after dinner so I put it on and watched with her. She loved it! I was surprised because parts of it seem a little slow for a 2 year old. The plot is cute for a child a little bit older than mine. Regardless my daughter watched the whole thing.
After breakfast this morning she asked to watch, ""the magic ballerinas movie."" She is watching it right this minute. She is clapping and calling to the ballerinas. She is trying to convince her 10 year old brother to watch with her. My kids are both doing plie's and freeze dancing. My son joined in for a while both last night and this morning (He is a rare breed of brother. He is often found engaged with his little sister and her activities. I am not suggesting 10 year old boys would like this). The dances are fun and simple. I really like that they call some of the dance moves by name. I also like that jazz, tap, ballet, and more are covered. A lot of the dances incorporate simple dance moves that I learned in dance class years back. For example shuffle ball change, the arm positions for ballet, port de bras, and more.
It is adorable to see my toddler dancing, interacting, and learning the dance vocabulary. She however, loves the characters, the magical feel, and the fun of this unique and wonderful option for a DVD. It truly is different than anything else available on the market. I am very happy with my decision to purchase this. I was a bit leary and bought it because the reviews were so good and I did not see any other ""dance"" DVD that I thought my toddler might engage in. I was hopeful but not convinced my bouncy, strong-willed toddler would like it. But, this met my expectations in every way.",1334620800,3,1722,4.350931677018633

I didn't know what to expect when I ordered it, but while visiting my grandchildren at Christmas, I decided to play the DVD. To my amazement, all of them stopped what they were doing and danced along with the video, even asking to ""play it again"". This kept them entertained for a good 20 minutes until we had to leave for an appointment. This gift was truly a hit with staying power. Thank you so much and please create more. And by the way, the DVD arrived promptly and in perfect condition.",1331510400,3,662,4.296

My daughter who is only 1 and half year old, has been requesting me to put this DVD on every day since it arrived in the mail, she finds this DVD box among other DVDs and would take my hands to go in front of the DVD player. :) She is mesmerised by the story. I really enjoyed watching this DVD with her too. The DVD is well-made and the dancers are all great. The teddy bear character is of course very interesting for young kids, the bird fairy (Freeze Dance) and the jazzy cat inspire children to immitate animal movements and create their own dance steps from observing pets or animals. The pirate character (Hip Hop) would be engaging for boys to dance along and gives the stroy a sense of adventure. The ballerina, with her pretty tutu would defintely be a favorite for girls. The clown's tap dance is set in a circus and gives children an early taste of ""show business"", the exotic princess takes you to a faraway land and reminds you of stories such as ""Arabian nights"". And then finally the story comes to the end and everyone danced together in Rock & Roll fashion.

The children actors in this story all acted very naturally and looked like they have enjoyed the dances themselves, not like they were requested to perform in a dance class or in front of a camera, the leading girl sometimes pauses and talkes to the audience to get them to dance along which makes it very viewer friendly, kids need little invition to get onto the fun wagon.

The ""meet the dancers"" segment on the DVD was very inspiring too. The actor who played the clown mentioned that he didn't like teachers so he borrowed old Hollywood musicals DVDs to watch and that's how he learned to dance. Your kids might find it the same way and learning to dance in a dance class can be supplemented or even replaced by watching dance moves from DVDs. I find the advice the dancers given on this DVD very heartfelt, helpful and encouraging for young kids.

The settings for each dancer's individual dances are all animated and well-chosen. Overall, the settings give the whole story an old-fashioned feel which serves very well for a fairy tale story. They are also very pleasing to the eyes. I wouldn't mind watching this again and again with my daughter. It can also grow with the children, as they get older they will learn to appreciate and master more moves from this DVD, for very young babies or toddlers, it will help create the interests in them for starting to move to the rythems and get up and groove.

This DVD is a grest investment for parents who want to introduce differnent tyes of dances to their young children. I have purchased other dance DVDs for kids before but so far this one tops the list. Buy this and you'd be glad you made the purchase, it is a quality one for keeps.",1302998400,3,2776,4.458661417322834
3052732,5,B0010WDQ9E,"""The Music Box - a Dance along Fairytale"" contains all of the components of a traditional ballet: a narrative (the fairytale), costumes, characters, good music, lighting, and movement! It was given to my five year old grandson as a birthday gift and within two days he viewed it fifteen times. He did not differentiate gender roles except for the pas de deux when he insisted on being the cavalier rather than the ballerina. While I observed his efforts to master the steps demonstrated by each character, it became apparent that he was directing his naturally kinetic energy into simple voluntary and goal directed movement. Ultimately, goals translate into motivation, initiation, and intention which are positive traits for children to develop. Humans and particularly children learn by observation. In fact, our brain has mirror neurons that are specifically designed for the purpose of imitation. This video taps into those neurocognitive processes and is excellent in terms of teaching physical co-ordination, focus, and musicality.

They are learning the steps and have become excited about dancing and moving, and they watch it all the time.  I also really like the innocence and joyful attitude that Music Box has, which I find increasingly hard to find for kids now a days.

The music is not at all annoying, either.  We had a lot of company over for Christmas, and the kids played this DVD many times....it didn't bother anyone, a definite plus!  The children who enjoyed it ranged from ages 4-7.  I highly recommend this DVD!",1293235200,3,418,4.506666666666667

It's crazy. They get up and dance every time and also love to watch the info about the actors at the end.  I find it quite unexplainable -- i had never guessed they would be so crazy about it, but they are.  And I love that it's more than just watching something and zoning out. They're totally in to it.  And whenever they have friends over, their friends love it to. I almost didn't buy it because I wasn't sure they'd like it.  It's seriously the ONLY dvd in our whole collection that stands out or that I'd recommend.  It's simply amazing how much our girls love it!",1291334400,3,761,4.149659863945578

3052738,4,B0010WDQ9E,"I have an adorable little 3 year old girl who is craZy about this DVD.

What sets it apart is the interactive dance sequences whereby each character teaches the moves.

Candidly, we have never watched the film because the kids go crazy for the Dance Sequences which are like in home dance lessons.

The kids LOVE the characters who speak directly to them and instruct them on how to act like a ballerina, a bear, a bird, etc

When we have play dates or guest from out of town--slip this in and  you have 4 kids in front of the television learning the dance moves.

Even the older snobby kids get involved.  It is not loud or obnoxious but intimate which makes it great.

The kids get the sense they are being spoken to directly by the characters.

The children in the production set the tone and they take the queue's from them

I never review anything but this is the best kept kids secret around.

I only wish they would make a sequel or other materials.

This is a fantastic DVD. It introduces dance in a way that I never thought possible. Very well done. My kids (3 and 4 1/2) both LOVE IT. My daughter loves it for the pretty ballerinas and the storyline. My son loves the other styles of dance and figuring out the clues.

It did not disappoint!!! Ever since it arrived in the mail, my daughter has requested it repeatedly. She loves to follow along with all the dance characters and the overall storyline nicely ties everything together. The children in the movie display varying degrees of dance ability so it does not intimidate my daughter at all. She dances the entire time, although she has a bit of difficulty keeping up with the hip hop character. My one (very small) criticism might be that he demonstrate some of his hip hop steps a bit more slowly since they are pretty complex. Otherwise, this is a very nice piece of work, created on a lower budget, but with a LOT of care - and it shows!!!",1268524800,5,862,4.39375

As soon as the ""confetti"" screen showed up as the kids were falling into the music box (a few minutes in), she abandoned her pony coloring book - maybe I DO want to watch that!  5 minutes later, she was dancing with the rest of them, and it held all 4 girls' attention for the entire movie.  (Despite some borderline hyperactivity).  Then they watched & danced it again!

The production values may not be perfect, but the dancing is a great mix, the music not at all annoying to parents, and it ends with a crazy dance party.  (My oldest's favorite part!)",1347321600,2,1125,4.314285714285714
3287222,5,B0010WDQ9E,"I have given the Music Box video to toddlers ages 3 and 4, girls and boys, including my nephew, all of whom adore it.  They watch it over and over in deep concentration.  I believe their fascination with this video is due to its presentation of a gentle magical storyline combined with learning tools: easy to follow repetitive instructions on the various dance genres.  I wonder whether my nephew's fearless ability to dance even by himself in front of crowds is due to the encouragement the characters in this video provide.",1338249600,2,526,4.758241758241758

I have to admit, I got drawn it too, and my son and I watched it from beginning to end.  Great story and dancing.  The original music is well produced and so catchy that after one or two views, you'll be humming right along.  Very educational and entertaining. I highly recommend it!",1337644800,,449,4.235294117647059
3287224,5,B0010WDQ9E,"This DVD arrived yesterday. My daughter was a bit bored after dinner so I put it on and watched with her. She loved it! I was surprised because parts of it seem a little slow for a 2 year old. The plot is cute for a child a little bit older than mine. Regardless my daughter watched the whole thing.
After breakfast this morning she asked to watch, ""the magic ballerinas movie."" She is watching it right this minute. She is clapping and calling to the ballerinas. She is trying to convince her 10 year old brother to watch with her. My kids are both doing plie's and freeze dancing. My son joined in for a while both last night and this morning (He is a rare breed of brother. He is often found engaged with his little sister and her activities. I am not suggesting 10 year old boys would like this). The dances are fun and simple. I really like that they call some of the dance moves by name. I also like that jazz, tap, ballet, and more are covered. A lot of the dances incorporate simple dance moves that I learned in dance class years back. For example shuffle ball change, the arm positions for ballet, port de bras, and more.
It is adorable to see my toddler dancing, interacting, and learning the dance vocabulary. She however, loves the characters, the magical feel, and the fun of this unique and wonderful option for a DVD. It truly is different than anything else available on the market. I am very happy with my decision to purchase this. I was a bit leary and bought it because the reviews were so good and I did not see any other ""dance"" DVD that I thought my toddler might engage in. I was hopeful but not convinced my bouncy, strong-willed toddler would like it. But, this met my expectations in every way.",1334620800,3,1722,4.350931677018633

I didn't know what to expect when I ordered it, but while visiting my grandchildren at Christmas, I decided to play the DVD. To my amazement, all of them stopped what they were doing and danced along with the video, even asking to ""play it again"". This kept them entertained for a good 20 minutes until we had to leave for an appointment. This gift was truly a hit with staying power. Thank you so much and please create more. And by the way, the DVD arrived promptly and in perfect condition.",1331510400,3,662,4.296

My daughter who is only 1 and half year old, has been requesting me to put this DVD on every day since it arrived in the mail, she finds this DVD box among other DVDs and would take my hands to go in front of the DVD player. :) She is mesmerised by the story. I really enjoyed watching this DVD with her too. The DVD is well-made and the dancers are all great. The teddy bear character is of course very interesting for young kids, the bird fairy (Freeze Dance) and the jazzy cat inspire children to immitate animal movements and create their own dance steps from observing pets or animals. The pirate character (Hip Hop) would be engaging for boys to dance along and gives the stroy a sense of adventure. The ballerina, with her pretty tutu would defintely be a favorite for girls. The clown's tap dance is set in a circus and gives children an early taste of ""show business"", the exotic princess takes you to a faraway land and reminds you of stories such as ""Arabian nights"". And then finally the story comes to the end and everyone danced together in Rock & Roll fashion.

The children actors in this story all acted very naturally and looked like they have enjoyed the dances themselves, not like they were requested to perform in a dance class or in front of a camera, the leading girl sometimes pauses and talkes to the audience to get them to dance along which makes it very viewer friendly, kids need little invition to get onto the fun wagon.

The ""meet the dancers"" segment on the DVD was very inspiring too. The actor who played the clown mentioned that he didn't like teachers so he borrowed old Hollywood musicals DVDs to watch and that's how he learned to dance. Your kids might find it the same way and learning to dance in a dance class can be supplemented or even replaced by watching dance moves from DVDs. I find the advice the dancers given on this DVD very heartfelt, helpful and encouraging for young kids.

The settings for each dancer's individual dances are all animated and well-chosen. Overall, the settings give the whole story an old-fashioned feel which serves very well for a fairy tale story. They are also very pleasing to the eyes. I wouldn't mind watching this again and again with my daughter. It can also grow with the children, as they get older they will learn to appreciate and master more moves from this DVD, for very young babies or toddlers, it will help create the interests in them for starting to move to the rythems and get up and groove.

This DVD is a grest investment for parents who want to introduce differnent tyes of dances to their young children. I have purchased other dance DVDs for kids before but so far this one tops the list. Buy this and you'd be glad you made the purchase, it is a quality one for keeps.",1302998400,3,2776,4.458661417322834
3287229,5,B0010WDQ9E,"""The Music Box - a Dance along Fairytale"" contains all of the components of a traditional ballet: a narrative (the fairytale), costumes, characters, good music, lighting, and movement! It was given to my five year old grandson as a birthday gift and within two days he viewed it fifteen times. He did not differentiate gender roles except for the pas de deux when he insisted on being the cavalier rather than the ballerina. While I observed his efforts to master the steps demonstrated by each character, it became apparent that he was directing his naturally kinetic energy into simple voluntary and goal directed movement. Ultimately, goals translate into motivation, initiation, and intention which are positive traits for children to develop. Humans and particularly children learn by observation. In fact, our brain has mirror neurons that are specifically designed for the purpose of imitation. This video taps into those neurocognitive processes and is excellent in terms of teaching physical co-ordination, focus, and musicality.

They are learning the steps and have become excited about dancing and moving, and they watch it all the time.  I also really like the innocence and joyful attitude that Music Box has, which I find increasingly hard to find for kids now a days.  This is truly a worth while investment.",1296086400,2,367,4.27536231884058
3287231,5,B0010WDQ9E,"This is a lovely little story, and very fun to try and dance along to.  Not too complicated, and very fun.  The characters/actors are not over the top and annoying.  The music is not at all annoying, either.  We had a lot of company over for Christmas, and the kids played this DVD many times....it didn't bother anyone, a definite plus!  The children who enjoyed it ranged from ages 4-7.  I highly recommend this DVD!",1293235200,3,418,4.506666666666667

It's crazy. They get up and dance every time and also love to watch the info about the actors at the end.  I find it quite unexplainable -- i had never guessed they would be so crazy about it, but they are.  And I love that it's more than just watching something and zoning out. They're totally in to it.  And whenever they have friends over, their friends love it to. I almost didn't buy it because I wasn't sure they'd like it.  It's seriously the ONLY dvd in our whole collection that stands out or that I'd recommend.  It's simply amazing how much our girls love it!",1291334400,3,761,4.149659863945578

3287235,4,B0010WDQ9E,"I have an adorable little 3 year old girl who is craZy about this DVD.

What sets it apart is the interactive dance sequences whereby each character teaches the moves.

Candidly, we have never watched the film because the kids go crazy for the Dance Sequences which are like in home dance lessons.

The kids LOVE the characters who speak directly to them and instruct them on how to act like a ballerina, a bear, a bird, etc

When we have play dates or guest from out of town--slip this in and  you have 4 kids in front of the television learning the dance moves.

Even the older snobby kids get involved.  It is not loud or obnoxious but intimate which makes it great.

The kids get the sense they are being spoken to directly by the characters.

The children in the production set the tone and they take the queue's from them

I never review anything but this is the best kept kids secret around.

I only wish they would make a sequel or other materials.

This is a fantastic DVD. It introduces dance in a way that I never thought possible. Very well done. My kids (3 and 4 1/2) both LOVE IT. My daughter loves it for the pretty ballerinas and the storyline. My son loves the other styles of dance and figuring out the clues.

It did not disappoint!!! Ever since it arrived in the mail, my daughter has requested it repeatedly. She loves to follow along with all the dance characters and the overall storyline nicely ties everything together. The children in the movie display varying degrees of dance ability so it does not intimidate my daughter at all. She dances the entire time, although she has a bit of difficulty keeping up with the hip hop character. My one (very small) criticism might be that he demonstrate some of his hip hop steps a bit more slowly since they are pretty complex. Otherwise, this is a very nice piece of work, created on a lower budget, but with a LOT of care - and it shows!!!",1268524800,5,862,4.39375

I loved that it included a character from the Cats Broadway show and hip hop dance, as well as tap, ballet 2 other dance styles. There is also light terminology for each of the dance styles and you can use the menu to watch each dance style one at a time, apart from the story-line.
