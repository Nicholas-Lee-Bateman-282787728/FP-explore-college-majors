8729435,5,B0142WF76I,This was a very interesting DVD. I didn't realize how many different groups these people (The Wrecking Crew) recorded songs for them. Extremely talented people. Enjoyed watching some of the extra material as well. Didn't know Glen Campbell started out as a studio musician.,1461024000,,273,5.2272727272727275
