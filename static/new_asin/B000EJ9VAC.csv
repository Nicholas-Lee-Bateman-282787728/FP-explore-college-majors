8110563,5,B000EJ9VAC,2 great old time classic western comedies and at a great price too. May only work in some DVD players but good for playing in a computer DVD (Format Type),1452124800,,154,4.166666666666667
8110564,1,B000EJ9VAC,If you can't hear don't buy this one. It was very disappointing as I'm a Judy Canova fan and there don't seem to be any that are cc d or subtitled,1399075200,,146,3.7419354838709675
8110565,3,B000EJ9VAC,"It was hard to rate this one.  Oklahoma Annie looks very good with no real problems.  The disappointment is the Bride Wore Spurs.  Besides the print damage, there is no mention of Ginger Rogers or Jack Carson in the credits.  The supporting players are all there.  They could be gone because of a splice, but it doesn't really look like it.  I've haven't seen another release as of yet, so I'm just not sure.  But, it's still incomprehensible that they would release a print that omits credit to the stars.  Thus, the 2-star deduction.",1325116800,2,535,4.617021276595745
8110566,5,B000EJ9VAC,"The Groom Wore Spurs starring Ginger Rogers and Jack Carson is a romantic comedy for those looking for something entertaining but not too taxing on the brain. Ginger plays a lawyer who falls in love with and marries her spoiled client only to find he was merely using her to avoid financial ruin. Of course, the beautiful and refined Ginger shows her man that two can play that game causing her husband to really fall in love with her along the way. Oklahoma Annie is the real prize in this double feature. Starring the extremely funny and talented Judy Canova this musical comedy will tickle your funny bone. Judy plays a shop keeper who falls in love with the new town sherriff and helps him clean up the rampant corruption around town. Of course nothing Judy does ever goes quite right but you can't help but love this Queen of hillbilly corn!",1257206400,6,846,4.572368421052632
8110567,4,B000EJ9VAC,"excellent comedy of 1951 with ginger rogers and jack carson ( who had supporting roles in a number of ginger's early movies). They are both very funny, as is Joan Davis (of course) in a small role. Monochrome photography is brilliant and even though it is a minor film, it is genuinely very entertaining.",1225584000,2,304,4.648148148148148
8110568,5,B000EJ9VAC,"From back in a time were watching movies you knew what was good and bad by the clothes that were worn. Good won, bad lost, that was the long and the short of it. Judy made you love her and anyone that wasn't nice to her was your enemy. Dear God, please make more judy Canova movies available. Amen.

8110569,4,B000EJ9VAC,"Judy Canova was a hilarious comedian who I remember from my childhood.  With all of the revival interest in stars from the 40's and 50's, I can't understand why she has been overlooked.  As far as I know, only two of her films are available on DVD, and those have only recently been produced. I bought this DVD especially for her movie. If you remember her from your childhood, or are interested in one of America's comedic legends, buy her films.",1184284800,9,447,4.506172839506172
