8745094,5,B019G9DSOA,"This picture takes place in one of the most beautiful natural locations that France mayboast . Corsica and its charming contrasts between beach and mountain. The admirable landscapes encloses a nice story between two pals and their respective daughters, when all of them decide to enjoy a well deserved beach vacation.

The plot will lead to an awkward situation  that will make you think. The script runs between the drama and humor. Agile and concise with the presence of two monsters of the French cinema (such Clouzet and Cassel) the screen will ignite with the alluring presence of  Lola Le Lann ( a true muse a spectacular and spelling beauty).

Absolutely recommended. Go for this one.",1474848000,,692,4.939655172413793
