I am wondering why we do not get very many movies and series in our region from Europe?  I have noticed that Europe gets many of the U.S. Movies and series, which I think is awesome. Please bring more movies and series to the U. S.  in region 1.",1385510400,,356,4.0

8414584,5,B0043CEQHY,"I well remember watching and enjoying the original broadcast of this series on TV and it is a real pleasure to have it available on DVD. From my memory of the original series, this is somewhat different particularly in the final episode which has been very heavily edited from what I remember watching!

Nevertheless, it is a television classic, it follows the original books fairly closely and would be well worth rebroadcasting.",1344643200,2,430,4.972222222222222
