8303083,4,B001FY3D9U,"The film isn't very long, but it does have loads of funny and crazy scenes in it. Everytime I watch it, I notice a new funny/crazy thing I somehow missed the previous times. The surfing and locations are good, and the film is entertaining. Wished it was a little longer.",1335225600,,270,4.42
