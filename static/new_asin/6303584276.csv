7851818,2,6303584276,"I finally found a movie worse than ""Lady Godiva Rides"".The actors and actresses in this movie must have worked for free. Marsha Jordan getting undressed was the highlight of the movie
but they killed her off too early. The actor and male stars must have been handymen at the studio who decided to be actors. Georgia's husband was horrible. The step daughter was just as bad. If you can find a plot to this movie go public with it. This
movie is even worse than ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"".Don't buy this movie,find one and steal it.",1026604800,,530,4.474226804123711
