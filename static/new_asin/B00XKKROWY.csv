8716209,5,B00XKKROWY,"I bought this just for the last three movies shown in the photo, cause I did not have those. And I had not seen two of them. All three came in very well and sound is also excellent. So I am sure the others would be too. I have all the others in other sets. All are very good movies. Well worth the cost, even for just three.",1529020800,,324,3.7794117647058822

8716212,5,B00XKKROWY,"Some surprisingly good westerns in this collection.  Fred MacMurray, unknown to me as a star of westerns, is amazing.",1471305600,,117,5.157894736842105
8716213,4,B00XKKROWY,"As of now I've seen 5 of these 8 movies, and those I've seen are respectable productions with good acting and scripts, although most of these 1950s era films are not among the best Westerns ever made. The movie books I've looked these up in, Leonard Maltin's and Martin & Porter's guides, generally agree with my assessment that most of these are good but not top-notch, although the Maltin guide does give especially glowing reviews to ""The Lawless Breed"" and ""Man from the Alamo."" I thought that ""Seminole"" was also a stand-out drama as Rock Hudson tries to protect Seminole Indians from a belligerent captain (ably played by Richard Carlson), although I wonder why this is considered a ""Western"" since it's set in Florida. For the price I'm surprised that these movies look and sound as good as they do - I'm watching them on a 50-inch high definition TV, but still they look and sound quite good. I doubt that any Western fans would be disappointed in this set, especially considering the low price.",1468195200,5,1003,4.7371428571428575
8716214,5,B00XKKROWY,"I have this compilation of 8 westerns, and I can tell you, as a fan of westerns, that these are all in full color and are high quality movies. The quality of the picture is excellent, the star quality is good and stories are first rate. I don't give five stars very often, since that signifies perfection and nothing is ever perfect, but for the price I paid for this package and the quality of them, this is a steal and well worth the five stars. In addition to the usual Western character actors, the main stars are Glenn Ford, Rock Hudson, Maureen O'Hara and Fred MacMurray.",1454544000,,577,4.401869158878505
8716215,4,B00XKKROWY,"I purchased this dvd at a big store for under $10 felt I got an excellent deal sure there are 4 movies on each disc but 3 of 8 i'd never seen & I added 4 more movies to my westerns collection that I didn't have, I found them all to be 2.5 or 3 out of 5. Well worth the $, I didn't find the quality all that bad, maybe I'm just easier to please.",1441670400,2,344,3.539473684210526
8716216,2,B00XKKROWY,"I just purchased this set, and was shocked to open the package and find only two discs. Universal has loaded four (4) full length movies onto each single sided disc. As soon as I inserted them into my DVD player and hit ""play"", I knew I had made a bad purchase. These movies are so badly compressed, it is like watching a bad download on YouTube.

I would have expected this if the label on the case had been ""Mill Creek"" or ""Echo Bridge"". But really Universal? You've gone from your defective DVD-18 sets to this? Have you no sense of responsibility to provide something of quality to your customers?",1436054400,,601,4.463636363636364
