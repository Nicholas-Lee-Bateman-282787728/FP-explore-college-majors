8261792,2,B00169MLBA,"I got this as part of a 4 dvd set of Tracey Mallett's quickblast method  total body makeover system. The exercises were definitely beginner but what's more disturbing is I don't think they targeted the abs and buns at all. It starts with a 12 minute yoga session that claims to be geared towards warming up your abs and glutes for the main exercise, but it's just your standard yoga. The most ab warmup there is are some side stretches. At the end of this section she says ""okay, we're getting ready for our cardio"" then starts jogging in place for 5 seconds then it cuts to her on the ground for the ab section. There is no cardio. I know the dvds come from her old ""Renew You"" programs but it could have been edited to make it all move more seamlessly. This in my opinion was just careless.

For the 20 minute floor exercises that supposedly work your abs and buns it's fairly easy. The majority of the work seems to actually target your inner and outer thighs. She claims you're using your core the entire time, which is true, but it's true of most exercises, and I don't call all of those ab workouts. My abs did not get fatigued once. I was consciously trying to activate my core muscles further to get a better workout there, but it was useless as the exercises were targeting my legs. There was one teaser section that worked the abs and some of the leg work also activated the glutes, but all in all I feel like this was definitely more of a thighs and hips workout. And a fairly simple one at that. I haven't tried the other dvds in the collection yet, though I've heard positive things about the collection as a whole so I'm hopeful the other dvds included are better. As for this one, I'll do it occasionally when I want a low key exercise day. This is not the one I'll go for though if I'm ever looking for an ab workout.

I will say this as a positive... included was a brief tutorial on how to safely and accurately activate your various ab muscles for the most effective workout. Though it was nothing revolutionary, she did explain things well and gave me a new way to think about how to breathe and hold my spine when doing ab exercises.",1299888000,7,2154,4.31358024691358
8261793,2,B00169MLBA,"I'm a Tracey lover. I have many of her DVD's. The name of this one struck my interest so I bought it - not what I thought it would be.

I thought it would be similar to some of ther other DVD's that offered a fun way to get in shape. This one was too slow for my and I started yawning. I think I'll stick with the Quick Blast Method DVD that has an Abs Blast in it...",1269993600,3,367,3.6455696202531644
