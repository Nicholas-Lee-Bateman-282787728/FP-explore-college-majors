957290,5,6305063508,"I saw this many, many years ago in the theatre... still a great movie, but the tape didn't exactly capture the lush backgrounds, the erotism of the first time. Well, I'm also not 6 (or whatever) years old.
  Still, I experienced again: a delirious crush on Hans, the romantic, too-good-to-be-true, hero- who was able to love AND LUST after Christine, the flawed and mistreated servant girl (haven't we all been her at one time?)His ability to see past the scars she felt such shame from made him a big numero uno for me even way back then.
  Second: yowza! I prayed that my pre-adolescent self would develop into ANY SEMBLANCE WHAT-SO-EVER of the oozing sexuality of the transformed/re-created (isn't that another wish of ours, ladies?) Christina (Susan Denberg)...
  And, oh yeah... Peter Cushing is in it, too.
  HA! Just kidding...the blend of old school, classic horror and repressed sexuality made for a memorable movie that I had to buy and watch again and again.
  If you dig the mix... and you know who you are out there... get this movie",1021593600,4,1046,4.761111111111111
957291,3,6305063508,"Hammer's Victor Frankenstein owes little to the Universal series (where the character was named Henry and in fact the sequels featured the monster and not the Doctor) or even the original novel (whose Victor was a young college student and not a Baron).
When one follows the Baron in the Hammer series, one finds a lot of inconsistency.  The insensitive, murderous Baron of CURSE is toned down a bit in REVENGE, misunderstood in EVIL, is the ""hero"" of CREATED WOMAN, is a killer and more evil than ever (and just transplants a brain) in MUST BE DESTROYED, and is back more or less like the Baron in REVENGE in AND THE MONSTER FROM HELL.  Cushing is a wonderful actor and makes the character interesting, in spite of the scripting.
  One wonders how the Baron came upon the idea to transplant souls since he seems to be an atheist or how he is able to acquire the machinery to be able to accomplish it without arousing suspicion. FRANKENSTEIN CREATED WOMAN is a pretty good film overall, but the ending does seem weak.  One gets the feeling they couldn't think up a more satisfying ending and just had her drown herself again.  Hammer fans will probably enjoy it anyway.  Others should look for a more traditional Frankenstein movie.",1006214400,4,1232,4.675925925925926
957292,4,6305063508,"Although you might think from the title that ""Frankenstein Created Woman"" is Hammer films version of ""The Bride of Frankenstein,"" it is really a strong return to the studio's original Frankenstein series after the dreadful mistake of ""The Evil of Frankenstein.""  Baron Victor Frankenstein, played by Peter Cushing of course, has become bored with stitching together corpses and is now interested in transplanting souls by occult methods (with a little help, believe it or not, from a small atomic pile).  This new direction is due in some small part to the fact his hands were damaged in the fiery conclusion of the previous film.  Dr. Hertz (Thorley Walters), the local doctor in the village where the Baron now lives, willingly serves as Victor's hands.  Meanwhile, a pair of young lovers named Hans (Robert Morris) and Christina (Susan Denberg), meet tragic fates.  He is mistakenly executed for murdering her father, and the heartbroken girl drowns herself.  Victor acquires the bodies and transfers Han's soul into Christina's body.  When a visit to the guillotine awakens Han's memories of what happened, he uses his new body to claim vengeance for what happened to them both.
Ironically, not only do we not have the traditional monster in ""Frankenstein Created Woman,"" the mad doctor is also pretty much a secondary figure in the film, although the new twists on the character makes him much more sympathetic than he had previously been.  Indeed, Victor is the film's ""hero.""  This is arguably the best script in the series by Anthony Hinds (writing again as ""John Elder"") and the return of director Terence Fisher to the series is quite welcomed.  The casting of former Playmate of the Month Susan Denberg as the, ah, creature did require her role to be dubbed because of her Austrian accent, a final irony since Hammer's Frankenstein films are always set in that lovely part of Central Europe that looks like Austria/Germany while everyone speaks with English/Cockney accents.  ""Frankenstein Created Woman"" is probably the second best film in the series.",989625600,12,2063,5.091988130563799
957293,4,6305063508,"Frankenstein Created Woman(1967)- A film alot of people dislike mainly becasue it's perhaps the only Fisher/Cushing/Frankenstein film to sideline the character of the Baron. I on the other hand find the premise very intresting, and a very innovative and inteligent approach. The film is less of a horror film and more of a poetic gothic mood piece, if anything else. The movie is structured as a pattern of symmetrical inversions and echoes. The first half starts with the double ritual of horror as a father is guillotined before the eyes of his son and then the son's decapitation is witnessedby his lover, while the second half, contained between Christina's two suicideds by drowning, is punctuated by two rituals of pleasure as she seduces and gruesomly kills Han's tormentors. These flamboyant explosions of violence are mingled with pleasure and death are bound together by the Baron's calm but relentless experimantation, filmed in tenderly muted technicolor, whi ch culminates in the ironic poetry of the ending as Cushing watches Denberg's body being carried away along the moutian river and, with a shrug of his shoulders, turns away, providing what must be the most understated ending ever for a horror movie.  The film is filled with felictious directorial touches, the movie contains a spendidly characteristic scene which summarizes Fisher's coception of the Baron's character. Apearing as a witness in court, Cushing casually and with an air of amused condesension fingers a few pages of the bible. Enhanced by wondefully controled acting, especially by Cushing and Walters, who both give superb perfomances, this is the most touching/moving, emontional, and most oneiric of Fisher's wonderful Frankenstein series. If there is one complaint from me of this film, it would be, and only be the ""tacky looking sets"". The film like most Hammer Horrors of it's period come off looking rather cheap.(Due to money problems Hammer was having during the 1965-1968 period). Many of the sets appear either cramped or tacky, as some of the shooting locations seem poorly chosen. Most of the time I can forgive low budget productions and their some what ""much to be desired"" looking sets. But with FCW, were dealing with poor resources. And this effect very much hampers the film, which is quit unfortunate. Aside from this rather obvious quibble, the film remains a very underrated masterwork, and one of director Terence Fisher's most touching, personal films. There are many moments of delicate beauty - I swear the first time I saw this film, the scenes with Susan Denberg, and that of Thorely Walter's, coupled with one of James Bernards best film scores, almost made me shed a tear. It's one of Fisher's most powerful films on a emotional standpoint.

He intends to take souls from fresh corpses,and give them new life,in another body. In order to do this,the Baron,and his colleague Dr. Hertz,need two fresh corpses.

The picture quality on this disc is excellent,no defects at all,no grain. Sharp throughout. No problems,4.0/5. The sound quality is also without fault,a Dolby Digital (Mono) track is sufficient to re-create the classic Hammer feel. 3.5/5.

This  film contains enough action and terror to keep you interested, but the  Baron seems out of character. Nothing against Cushing's performance at all,  but he seems almost too casual here not the intense madman we had come to  love. Instead he seems more like a man just tinkering around on the  weekend.

957416,5,6305063508,"Hammer Studios made many films.  Many of these were of the Horror (and to a lesser extant Sci-Fi) Genre.  These became some of Hammer Studios more Lucrative and now famous films.  Many of these films were of low budget but well crafted.  With lavish sets & were brilliantly acted.  Three of the acters from Hammer Studios later went on to have carreers outside of England/UK.  David Prowse, Peter Cushing, and Christopher Lee.  All three were in the Star wars films.  David Prowse as the man inside the Darth Vader Costume.  Peter Cushing Played Grand Moff Tarkin (Carrie Fisher found it difficult to act like she hated him.  As Mr Cushing was always a proper Gentleman & Smelled of Lilac & Lavender).  Christopher Lee of course holds the distinction of playing Dracula the most times as well as playing Count Duku in Star Wars & Saruman The White in LOTR & The Hobbit Series Respectively.
  With all that being said, Frankenstein Created Woman is one of Hammer Studios better attempts at the Frankestein genre.  This sees Peter Cushing as Victor Von Frankenstein (He was well known for Frankestein & Van Helsing roles in Hammer Studios).  He learns of how to trap a person's soul and transfer it into another person's body.  Using the talented & BEAUTIFULL Susan Denberg, as a tragic serving wench, he transfers the soul of his local assistant into her.  Of Course with tragic results.

957424,4,6305063508,"FRANKENSTEIN CREATED WOMAN

Don't get me wrong,
i am a big fan of the Hammer films and have been even since the films were released on VHS
but i do not love every singe Hammer film, some are my favourites which i love, some i just like
and some i think are very boring and i think what was the point making this film in the first place
just to make some money
all the Hammer Dracula's i love with Christopher Lee and the Hammer Frankenstein's with Peter cushing i love
but there are some Hammer films that turned out very boring from a fans point of view
and FRANKENSTEIN CREATED WOMAN is one of those Hammer films, i'm sorry
i remember buying this film on DVD when Anchor bay released it over 10 years ago now
which i still have in my Hammer collection.i bought it out of curiosity really
cause i was a big fan of Hammer's Dracula films and Frankenstein films at the time
so i bought it anyway

i was very very dissapointed when i watched the film, i thought what a waste of money
all Hammer fans will have different opinions of this film

but the story line is terrible, the plot of the film Dragged on a lot, not much suspense at all
there is no Horror compared to other Hammer films released in the 60's
this Frankenstein film is a more of a Drama with some suspense in it, that's it
it's definitely not a Gothic Horror
the Acting is definitely average, Peter cushing is the best Actor in the film
Susan Denberg whose soul is possesed by her Dead boyfriend is the killer in this film
very very ridiculous plot more ridiculous than other Hammer films i must say
the killings do not start  until the last 20-30mins of the film so the first hour is boring
it builds up some suspense but not much
and the kill scenes are not scary at all, you don't see any kill,
you see the scene cut to the next scene when susan Denberg is about to kill, so there is no Horror
Susan Denberg was just another Pin up Girl for Hammer's money making scheme, that's all
she was never an actress, just a model
Peter cushing is the only Actor holding the plot together, that's it

Terence Fisher Directed this film so i was expecting more suspense and Horror and there is none
i think this film is his worst film in my opinion
Terence Fisher's earlier Hammer films are the best, but not this Frankenstein film
maybe back in 1966 when this film was released it did scare audiences at the cinema
but these days this film is boring,
Hammer were just releasing another Frankenstein film year after year back in the 60'S
regardless if the film made lots of money or no money they still released the film
 and sadly this film is one of those that are at the bottom of the list
you either like this Hammer film or you don't that's it.
to me i think the film was pointless

so why did buy this blu-ray if i don't like the film
i bought it cause of the brand new special features that all, the film is just a bonus to me
the Anchor bay release from over 12 years ago has no extras at all, nothing.

so this brand new blu-ray reissue is the first time ever this FRANKENSTEIN film
has ever been given new special features
there is a brand new Audio commentary by 2 of the Actors from the film
Derek Fowlds and Robert Morris which was not on the Anchor bay release

there is an all new Documentary on the Hammer Glamour, very recent Doco it goes for about 45mins
it's interviews with all Hammer's Glamour actress's from the Hammer films
some were Models turned Actress's and some only appeared in 1 or 2 Hammer films and that's it
Valerie Leon, Caroline Munro, Martine Beswick, Madeleine smith, Jenny Hanley
are interviewed about their Acting roles in the Hammer films they starred in
some other Models/Actress's were not interviewed cause they have passed away now
or were not available for interview
Ingrid pitt, Barbara shelley, Ursula Andres and others
so very interesting Documentary
2 world of Hammer episodes from the 90'S Peter cushing, curse of Frankenstein
are also re-issued on this blu-ray and a stills Gallery
the Anchor bay dvd release had no extras at all
so this blu-ray is definitely worth buying just for the 45mins Documentary i think

i have watched some scenes from this blu-ray reissue
the picture quality is excellent in a brand new HD transfer with only a Dolby stereo soundtrack
the Anchor bay release had only Mono soundtrack

so i gave this blu-ray just 4 stars for the brand new special features
only about 2 stars for the film.
so Definitely time for an upgrade, get rid of the old Anchor bay dvd
and get this new Blu-ray release, if you love the film and the extras on this blu-ray
it's definitely worth the cash, $23 on amazon.com",1392249600,4,4627,4.374854481955762

957519,4,6305063508,"The Hammer franchise for both Dracula and Frankenstein could be decidely uneven but even in the worst films, there was usually something (usually Peter Cushing's or Christopher Lee's--or both--performance) worthwhile.

""Frankenstein Created Woman"" is, for me, one of the outstanding films in the series. Director Terrence Fisher focuses less on the process of creating a creature and more on the outcome of Baron Von Frankenstein's creation.

SPOILERS:

When Hans a local man is framed for murder and executed, his girlfriend Christina (Susan Denberg) drowns herself. Frankenstein (Cushing) and his able assistant Dr. Hertz (Thorley Walters) bring the girl back from the dead using a new device that also traps the soul at death. What Frankenstein brings back though isn't quite Christina as Frankenstein and Hertz use Hans' soul (a transexual transplant so-to-speak). Hans now has someone that can carry out his revenge at being falsely accused and executed.

END OF SPOILERS:

Ultimately what holds ""Frankenstein Created Woman"" together like the fine stitch work of the Doctor is Fisher's direction and Cushing's performance which is, as always, powerful.

Cushing's Frankenstein has always been a fascinating anti-hero who often failed often due to his own ego and hubris.

Interestingly, ""Frankenstein Created Woman"" plays as sort of a peverse horror film version of ""Pygmalion"". Frankenstein and Dr. Hertz remake Christina in their own image.

The Blu-ray transfer looks quite nice. The transfer seems to be the same restoration done by Studio Canal for the U.K. edition from earlier in the year. Colors are subdued which is fairly true to the original film presentation with clarity and detail being a highlight particularly compared to the previous DVD issued in the U.S. by Anchor Bay.

Be aware that the original 1.66:1 aspect ratio has been shifted to 1.78:1 for the Blu-ray.

Keep in mind, however, that the film has always had something of a gritty look to it which is largely due to the approach by the director of photography here and the film stocks being used in the late 60's/early 70's. Film grain is largely left in tact here giving the film a more natural appearance especially compared to ""Dracula Prince of Darkness"" which Millennium Entertainment released earlier last year.

We also get The World of Hammer episodes ""The Curse of Frankenstein"" and ""Hammer Stars: Peter Cushing"".

Aside from bringing us a nice restoration, Millennium Entertainment has ported over many of the extras from the U.K. edition for this set.

Among the highlights is an audio commentary with actors, Robert Morris and Derek Fowlds, moderated by Hammer expert Jonathan Rigby.

We also get a number of exceptional featurettes including ""Hammer Glamour"" focusing on the beautiful women cast in the Hammer films. It features new interviews with Caroline Munro, Martine Beswick among others discussing their roles, casting, etc.  We get a stills gallery, trailer and Millennium also includes five collectable cards that are mini versions of the lobby cards originally issued for the film.

Although it isn't a perfect film, ""Frankenstein Created Woman"" demonstrated surprising ambition in terms of its story and is particularly noneworthy for the complexity of its themes.",1390953600,3,3268,5.304263565891473

957521,5,6305063508,"I have a guilty pleasure, I like the Hammer Frankenstein series better than the Universal series. I think in large part it is because Hammer made a smart move. They kept the same actor and same character of Baron Frankenstein, and the actor who owned the role was of course, the brilliant Peter Cushing. Cushing is to Baron Frankenstein what Karloff was to Frankenstein's Monster.

The problem with Universal's parade of Frankensteins was a lack of consistency. They couldn't keep Karloff in the role of the monster and thus lost continuity. After all, it was Karloff who ""made"" the monster come to life for audiences. He only played the role three times (Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, and Son of Frankenstein) out of 6 films (there were seven films if you count ""Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein"", but Glenn Strange played the monster in that one).

Yes, the Frankenstein monster used the same iconic makeup (sort of -- they didn't quite get the look of the original in the sequels) and admittedly, he had a limited role to match his limited ability, so they must have decided that any actor could be done up in the makeup and it would work. It sort of did, because the Universal opus is quite popular. But it had a simplistic formula that became a parody of itself. One could sum up a later Universal Frankenstein film as: ""Monster is sick or dead (undead?), mad scientist revives him, he goes berserk in the last five minutes and dies again."" The thing that drew the audience, the Monster, often had very little screen time and got bumped off anyway! So it was always a question of, ""How will they revive him this time and how will they kill him again?""

I feel that the Hammer series is more sophisticated than the Universal one and that they were spot on in choosing to keep Peter Cushing in the recurring role of the complex Baron Frankenstein. One might sum up the Hammer approach as ""Baron Frankenstein uses genius and science in a desperate attempt of creating meaningful but artificial life. He comes close to success but something goes horribly wrong, his creation becomes a monster, and he fails miserably, getting seriously hurt himself. But, there's always a next time!"" With Hammer it was a question of ""How far will Baron Frankenstein go this time in trying to succeed?"" The focus was not on the monsters, but on the Baron.

In ""Frankenstein Created Woman"" (a racy title at the time it came out), we see him in his mid-series transition, sometimes heroic, sometimes noble, sometimes arrogant and unfeeling. Only Cushing could pull this off. His Baron is handsome and impeccably dressed - he fills out a 19th century ""morning suit"" like no one else. He is the epitome of a sophisticated genius who is borderline schizophrenic. He is a delight to look at and entertaining to watch, while being maddeningly frustrating and haughty at the same time. He is clearly aware of his own superiority. Imagine having lunch with the man! What would you talk about? How long could you hold a conversation with him before he lets loose with a condescending remark?

This film avoids being a 'sexploitation film', in spite of the title and the beautiful lead actress. It shows off the Frankenstein character quite well. In one scene he is the 'noble scientist' trying to uncover the secrets of the Universe (in this case exploring the role of the soul in the drama of life and death by capturing it) and we learn that his hands have been seriously hurt in his experiments, yet he struggles on - because he's a determined mad scientist. In another scene he is indifferent to the plight of a poor disfigured girl whom the locals mock and belittle. In another he argues eloquently in defense of an accused murderer, using his genius to add credibility to his testimony. In yet another, he guides his assistant to perform miraculous surgery that successfully transforms the same girl from deformed to a raving beauty. And after all this, he seems callous toward her and even expects her to be his servant and make him coffee and pastry! You have to be fascinated by such an amazingly complex and inconsistent character.

Hammer made this character about as complex as was possible, given the time period, in a series of scenarios that would take a TV series 13 episodes or more to develop.

I won't give away the plot, but suffice it to say it is something of a reversal. In the iconic novel, Frankenstein, Victor Frankenstein (who is neither a doctor nor a baron) seeks to create a man who is physically perfect and superior to human beings. His ambition and imagination clouds his actual vision and common sense, so he doesn't realize what a mess he has made until the creature comes to life. And thereby hangs the tale.

In this film, Baron Frankenstein takes a deformed girl who has a sweet and loving spirit, and gives her new life in a beautiful body, but with the tortured soul of her executed boyfriend - a not so sweet and loving spirit. There's a joke about ""till death do us part"" in there somewhere, but I'll avoid it.

Okay, the plot is just plain weird. But it certainly works as a platform for Cushing. What is interesting to watch is the rapid shift between caring and indifference Cushing's Frankenstein shows towards the other characters of the film and the possible outcome of this bizarre experiment, waiting to see how it unfolds and only then trying to come to terms with it.

There are many fine supporting actors and performances in this film, but Cushing is the one to watch. His Baron really is quite insane. Charmingly so at times, maddeningly so at others.

The film also has the signature technicolor, blood and some gore, and period sets and costumes that are the hallmark of Hammer productions, as well as the musical score that matches their other offerings.

Most of the Frankenstein films in the Hammer series are about the horror of what Frankenstein does (although Revenge of Frankenstein has much more pathos), with gory surgery and bloody sets and strange monsters, sometimes murderous, sometimes tragic.

This one is much more a study in the horror of the psychology of what Frankenstein - and the rest of humanity is doing, and tries to expose a sense of the basic depravity of human beings in general. There are many killings. Some are murders, some are executions. Not all are done by Frankenstein's creation. In this film, there are six deaths. Three are committed by 'normal human beings'. Three are done by the 'creature'. It is about the implication of killing... when is it justified, when is it murder, when is it revenge? If you watch it on that psychological level, it becomes very interesting, and explores the Frankenstein story much more closely to what the original novel was trying to do. The original author was interested in exploring the basic concept of ""man's inhumanity towards his fellow man.""

There is plenty of physical beauty and ugliness to draw you in, as well as the usual lab equipment and blood and gore. The ""creature"", Christine, is very beautiful and seemingly innocent, the period sets are wonderful as is the costuming. The lab equipment borders on science fiction, and it glows appropriately in all the right places, and the performances of the supporting cast all around are well done, highlighted by yet another outstanding performance by Peter Cushing.

He is always worth watching, and in this film, his character is wonderfully complex yet so smoothly transitions from  one insane mood to another... he is very believable as a mad scientist after all.

It's a fun ride.

Not horrific, but still a pleasant diversion.",1380931200,6,7605,4.770342205323194
957522,5,6305063508,"Using his brave new techniques, the Baron Frankenstein manages to migrate the souls of two young lovers into the same body, transforming the disfigured Christina into a beautiful woman. The two use Christina's voracious good looks as an instrument for revenge against the men that crossed them! Terence Fisher returns to direct the fourth in Hammer's FRANKENSTEIN series after Freddie Francis's slight misstep in the last. FRANKENSTEIN CREATED WOMAN is built on a tragic love story that unfolds around Hans and Christina, with Peter Cushing taking a step back behind his fellow cast members. Fisher takes long, artful strides as always in the development of his moving characters. The timely build leads up to the pair's perfectly-executed plot for revenge, which draws greatly from classic fairy tales and traditional storytelling techniques. The philosophical implications involving the existence of the soul and one's ability to transcend death also weigh heavier than in Frankenstein's other outings. Along with the fantastic performances by Thorley Walters, Robert Morris, and the ravishing Susan Denberg, FRANKENSTEIN CREATED WOMAN not only becomes one of the series' strongest sequels, but also one of Hammer's finest films!

A must see for all Peter Cushing fans and of the Frankenstein series he made. They don't make these well made classic movies anymore in my opinion and anytime you can get your hands on one as they are slowing being released on DVD is a pure pleasure.,1337212800,2,366,4.477611940298507
957524,5,6305063508,"""Frankenstein Created Woman"" is Hammer's fourth entry in their ""Frankenstein"" series released in 1966 and starring again Peter Cushing as the quintessential depiction of Mary Shelley's iconic character, Baron Frankenstein.  This role along with his similarly reprised role of Van Helsing in the ""Dracula"" series are the defining roles of his long and fabulous career.  Cast opposite him in this entry is the beautiful Susan Denberg who will be remembered for this role especially.  She had a memorable part as the beautiful maid in Warner Bros. version of Norman Mailer's book, ""An American Dream"" also in 1966 which shows her to full advantage in a very small part.  She basically plays two parts in this and definitely deserves a place in Halliwell's Who's Who but she is sadly not present.  Perhaps today the film's biggest recommendation comes from director Martin Scorcese who admired this film the most of all of Hammer's catalog.  If Hammer's films are called ""fairy tales for adults,"" this film has all the innocence and moral complexities and the dark horror found certainly in stories by the Brothers Grim and Hans Christian Anderson.  It is heart-wrenching at times.  John Elder of the Hammer stable wrote the screenplay and their master director Terence Fisher are responsible for a well thought out entry in the series and also to stand alone in what many believe is Hammer's greatest effort.  The film was distributed by 20th Century-Fox and dismissed as just another Hammer effort.  This edition is from the people of Anchor Bay who know what bringing cult films to new audiences in some of the best preserved presentations possible should know.  There are extras including trailers.  They are to be applauded for returning a luster to a rich jewel.",1329350400,6,1764,5.044827586206897
957525,1,6305063508,"This is all style and no substance. There is no suspense, scares or action.

I enjoy the Hammer films of the 50's and 60's because they re-invented old tired genres and upped the ante, injecting more scares, more gore, more elaborate sets, more suspense and lots of sexuality. They took the concept of the genre but reintroduced it to a new generation...a generation that needed more to be scared and entertained.

This movie is too talky and boring.

The ending is sooooo lame. The creature doesn't fall/jump off a cliff. She jumps from the bank of a river into the water...like a 5 foot jump...big deal!!!! She tries to kill herself, jumps into the water (like it's a swimming pool) and then the credits roll. In a non-horror film, that same jump would have resulted in the swimmer emerging, squirting water out of their mouth and leisurely doing the backstroke.

Coming off ""Curse"" and ""Evil"" of Frankenstein, this movie was a disappointment. Even with Peter Cushing usual commanding performance, this is the same role that has been played to death",1320019200,,1051,4.822222222222222
957526,4,6305063508,"Frankenstein Created Woman starring Peter Cushing as the haughty, intelligent and knows it super scientist Frankenstein.

This is a typical Hammer horror film with the gothic trappings and the crazed mob, the scoffers and the dummies, the jealous ones and the drunk ones.  This film had a little bit of everything which kept me moving through the plot quite nicely, thank you.

Story and Plot:

Basically little Hans sees his drunken father lose his head over a guillotine.  This scars the boy so that when he grows up, he becomes one of Frankenstein's assistants, along with a bumbling doctor.  The doctor (Dr. Herz, played by Thorley Walters) plays the foil where Frankenstein has to explain everything to and of course through him to the viewer.

After some interesting play with three rich boys who somehow cook up a scheme to get Hans falsely accused of murder, and Hans' girl, distraught over his fate (and his head being separated from his body) kills herself by drowning.  Hans' girl is Christine, a scarred, deformed girl.

Hans could have gotten off the murder charge but then he would have had to admit that he was sleeping with the girl on the night of the murder.  What a guy!

I love Cushing's portrayal in this film.  He clearly makes it known that he is the smartest thing around in town and everyone else is just a few cards short of a full deck.  His haughty air becomes a bit shaky when the typical mob throws a rock through is window but he comes through.

Bottom Line:  Some parts typical, some parts incredible, and many parts fun to watch.  Not at all scary for a ""horror"" film, but so what?  You get to watch Frankenstein perform miracles regarding experiments of the human soul and the sexy Christine (Susan Denberg).  What more could you ask?

DVD:  There is a brief narration by Oliver Reed on the makings of Frankenstein horror films by the Hammer Film Co. which is quite interesting.  There's the usual trailer and scene selection.  I don't recall any language choices but there may have been.  Nice bright saturated color!",1313712000,,2052,4.702247191011236

Back then, there were lots and lots of monster flicks, but this one, like a few of the haunting Mario Bava classics and the atmospheric Vincent Price Hammer films, just drew me in right away and lingered in my mind.  It's rarely if ever shown on TV, and I have never found it on DVD, so I am very pleased to have my own never-opened VHS copy. You know a story has to get its hooks in if you're to root for the ""bad guy,"" and this one does.  We just don't have this kind of movie fun anymore, sadly.

957587,1,6305063508,"I was so glad when on a whim one day I noticed that old Hammer horror titles previously released by Anchor Bay Entertainment appeared to be getting a re-release. Boy, was I wrong about that! Don't be fooled. DVD-R's are no substitute for a real factory manufactured product. The pictures appear murky, bleeding and washed out even though its obviously a direct burn from a genuine Anchor Bay DVD. The sound drops in and out. I played each disc on 3 different players manufactured by 3 different companies. In all I wasted $20 dollars a piece on 3 of these pathetic knock offs. Originally when I purchased these titles there was NO mention of them being bootleg quality DVD-R's. I don't know who's ingenious idea it was to propose such a gross misuse of wasted effort. Either shame on Anchor Bay or shame on Amazon for perpetuating such poor quality knock offs at such an absurd price. They even use the original Anchor Bay DVD's cover art printed by a laser printer however most of the special features listed will not appear.

I.E. - The Legend Of The 7 Golden Vampires does not include the U.S. cut of the film as mentioned.

What a crime in itself either release the film correctly or don't bother at all. What a tease. What a waste of my money and time.

The movie had this been a genuine product released through Anchor Bay would've received 5 stars.

957589,5,6305063508,"Hammer Studios did 7 Frankenstein films from the late 50s to early 70s:

The Curse of Frankenstein (1957)
The Revenge of Frankenstein (1958)
The Evil of Frankenstein (1964)
Frankenstein Created Woman (1967)
Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed (1969)
The Horror of Frankenstein (1970)
Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell (1973)

Peter Cushing played Baron Frankenstein in every one of these except ""The Horror of Frankenstein."" The reason is because ""Horror"" was a remake of the original story and they needed a much younger actor to play the role; in this case they chose Ralph Bates (who superbly played the love-to-hate OTT satanist in ""Taste the Blood of Dracula"" released the same year).

Until relatively recently I hadn't seen any of the films in this series with the exception of a few clips of the first one while channel surfing. This initial segment never intrigued me mainly because I'm bored with the basic Frankenstein plot and feel Christopher Lee makes a weak Frankenstein monster (sorry for my blasphemy). What got me interested in the series was ""Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed,"" which is a creative and well-done piece of gothic horror. Yesterday I viewed ""Frankenstein Created Woman"" on dvd and was similarly impressed.

One thing that perked my interest in this film was the appearance of Susan Denberg as the titular ""woman;"" she appeared in the 1966 Star Trek episode ""Mudd's Women"" as the blond bombshell and was also a playmate-of-the-month that same year (not that I keep up on such things).

THE STORY [Don't read this paragraph if you don't want to know that basic plot!]: Susan plays a disfigured working class young woman, Christina, who is harrassed by the locals. Hans, a local peasant, who's father was guillotined for murder when he was a boy, truly loves Christina despite her outward marring. Unfortunately Hans is falsely accused of murder and put to death; when Christina finds out she commits suicide. Baron Frankenstein gets his hands on both bodies and is able to resurrect Christina by infusing Hans' soul (his immaterial being) with Christina's soul & body; hence, he ""creates woman."" In the resurrection process the Baron is able to remove the girl's disfigurement through his skills. Things go awry when Hans' soul compels Christina to enact revenge on the pompous aristocrats who falsely accused him.

I'll be honest with you, with a title like ""Frankenstein Created Woman"" I wasn't expecting much. In fact, I was expecting unwanted goofiness but, no, this is a serious and moving piece of gothic horror. What a nice surprise.

The story hooks the viewer right away with the dilemma of both Christina and Hans. Anyone who's ever been teased for one reason or another when they were young will no doubt be able to relate to Christina. The only one who sees her true beauty and worth is the orphaned peasant, who is ostrasized because his father was guillotined for murder. By contrast the high-class mockers are brutal towards her. There's something about being poor in spirit that naturally creates true character and beauty; such is the case with both Christina and Hans. This is perhaps why a certain well-know person said, ""Blessed are the poor in spirit."" Humility is beautiful; arrogance is hideous.

Another potent piece is the entire sequence culminating in Hans being falsely accused. It effectively shows how easily someone can appear to be guilty even though the charges are false.

The film drives home the point that those who commit injustice and evil will reap what they sow sooner or later. The villains are good in a love-to-hate sense and the viewer can't help but hope they get their comeuppance.

Of course Peter Cushing is excellent as Frankenstein. The story emphasizes his brillance and skill, which so exceeds that of his contempories that he's accused of witchcraft.

Some complain about the ending but actually it's a quite fitting way to end the storyline if you reflect on it.

The story's runtime is perfect at an hour and a half -- not too long and not too short.

FINAL ANALYSIS: I don't know about the other five films in the Hammer Frankenstein series, but both ""Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed"" and ""Frankenstein Created Woman"" are excellent pieces of gothic horror -- intelligent, creative, potent and moving.

957590,3,6305063508,"Frankenstein Created Woman is one of the better of Hammer's Frankenstein sequels, an efficient programmer that sees Peter Cushing's Baron trapping the soul of his guillotined assistant and putting it in the body of his disfigured girlfriend, only for the wronged boy to use her to kill those who really done the crime he was executed for. There's more build-up than payoff, but its very sedateness (indeed, almost cosiness) is part of the pleasure, and it's hard not to warm to the Baron's arrogance and aloofness, whether it be reading in the witness box or casually answering a policeman's ""Do you take us for fools?"" with a simple ""Yes."" Still, it is remarkable just how well preserved that severed head is after six months...

The extras package is okay but not outstanding: trailer and TV spots (for its double-bill release with The Mummy's Shroud - ""Beware the beat of the cloth-wrapped feet!"") and an episode of the World of Hamer clip show.",1206662400,,948,4.851851851851852
957591,4,6305063508,"Peter Cushing effortlessly dominates this very good Hammer film, which would prove to be the best of their late Frankenstein movies. What makes this film a cut above the average Hammer film is the fine script by Anthony Hinds, which gives the film the feel of a classic Victorian horror story. You could believe this was based on a book by Mary Shelley or Bram Stoker.

Cushing portrays Baron Frankenstein as a driven man, intent at all costs to prove that the soul lives on after death, and that the soul can be returned to the body if the body is brought back to life... You can see where this is going. Cushing plays the role with his usual authority and even has the opportunity to show the Barons superiority in a court room, which is a lovely scene. Even if you don't spot him in the credits you can't miss Derek Fowlds (Bernard in Yes Minister) as one of the three upper-class louts.

As a general rule of thumb Hammer films directed by Terence Fisher tend to be the better ones. Guess who this is directed by - yes Terence Fisher. Keeping my feet firmly on the ground I realise this film isn't up there with 'Citizen Kane' or 'The Godfather'. However, Martin Scorcese did pick this film to be shown in a season of his favourites at the NFT in London 1987 and is quoted as saying ""If I single this one out it's because here they actually isolate the soul. The implied metaphysics are close to something sublime"".

So this isn't Fellini, or even Scorcese, but its much better than the title might suggest and well worth adding to your collection.",1198540800,,1552,4.457746478873239

Imagine the number of Hammer bit players who could have had longer careers had they just turned their faces over to Doctor Frank!  And then you got to ask the question if the Baron could transfer souls, why did he spend all that time and all those years and all those movies sewing up corpses and reanimating them with electricity?  I guess he just used the other ""inferior"" method to set the eerie mood we should expect from a good ""horror"" film (not to mention Shelly's original novel).

He is revived and to celebrate his success sends Hans out to get some champagne at one of the local pubs. Hans is in love with the owner's daughter (Christina played by Susan Denberg) and spends the night with her but when the owner is killed Hans is accused and refuses to tell where he was when the murder took place. Hans is found guilty and himself guillotined like his father. Christina sees this and jumps off a bridge and drowns.

7881677,5,6305063508,"Well, like in many horror movies--new or old--there is no attempt made to explain how Baron Frankenstein survived the ending of ""The Evil of Frankenstein."" I guess the only explanation necessary was that these films were popular and the public wanted more. So, this time, we see the Baron revived after being dead in an icy coffin for an hour--his soul never leaving his body.

This gives the great doctor the idea of trapping the human soul & possibly putting it into a new body--which, of course, he does. This time, a female body--hence the title of this movie. Not quite as great to me as all the previous Frankenstein entries that I've seen--of course, I thought ""Evil of Frankenstein"" was a masterpiece, so anything following that might be a bit of a letdown.

Still, this is a very good movie--you can hardly go wrong with Cushing as the Baron and Susan Denberg as his latest creation--the face of an angel and the soul of a killer. If you like ""Hammer Horror,"" then this movie shouldn't disappoint. The print of this particular VHS release by Anchor Bay is excellent too. 4 1/2 stars....",1497225600,,1095,4.668393782383419
