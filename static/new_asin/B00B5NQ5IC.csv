8562986,1,B00B5NQ5IC,"This is the most garbage item I have ever spent $50 on. I am so angry that I wasted this much money, it is worth $10 at most. The pictures and lettering are blurry, the music is weird, the voice narrating is so weird and the sound is off. Overall, extremely poor quality. The information is accurate, part 1 is extremely basic however, if you have taken any ballet at all you won't likely learn anything new. It looks like someone whipped this up on their home computer then went online and decided to trick people into spending $50 dollars per disc. Do yourself a favor and don't purchase this item.",1463443200,,600,4.414414414414415
