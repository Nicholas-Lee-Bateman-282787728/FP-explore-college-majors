I got it for about $6 on Amazon through a 3rd party seller. However it came from UK and doesn't play on North American DVD players. It plays fine on my computer and laptop, so I connect the laptop to the TV and I'm fine.

The music and songs themselves are usually great and the videos are very fun to watch. There's no special features but you get a lot of content for the price - 1 hour and 40 minutes in total (100 minutes).

I took off 1 star because the videos are not remastered in terms of sound and video quality.

Enjoy!",1451433600,,736,4.198581560283688
