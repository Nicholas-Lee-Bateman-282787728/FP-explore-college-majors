8143400,4,B000I2JDJ4,My used version was missing the booklet!  Darn.  I have not watched all of it yet...it is good but I was hoping to see more techniques without using so much thumb-work.  I am looking for better ways to do deep work and save my suffering thumbs!,1361145600,2,244,4.260869565217392
8143401,5,B000I2JDJ4,"I am a massage therapist works for Massage Envy in Indianapolis, and I purchased more than 3 dozens of DVDs concerning massage and bodywork; those two deep tissue DVDs (extremity and torso) are my favorite. I learned so much and come back to watch them again and again, each time I learned more new things. My clients and coworkers (who traded massage with me) told me that I exceeded their expectations and I received many requests for a newcomer (less than 2 months of employment). I found some scratch on my 'torso' DVD and I contacted the company, they sent me a replacement DVD within the same day of receiving my email. Great service too. I appreciate their professionalism and highly recommend their top notch products. Thank you thank you",1348444800,4,746,4.746153846153846
