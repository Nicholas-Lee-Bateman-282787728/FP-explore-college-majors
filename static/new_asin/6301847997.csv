7816171,5,6301847997,"I grew up watching ""The Little Prince"" and have been trying to find it for my husband to watch as well. I've never read the book, so I can't base it on that, but I do remember being transfixed while he caught the comet and rode to other worlds. And to this day I can still remember everything about his little planet... so I guess that has to say something for it. And if anyone out there knows where to find this movie or pictures of it... please post where.",1046304000,,459,4.111111111111111
