8015987,2,B0001PCCDW,"Upon reviewing this product one would think that the videos would be relativly new. However, they are videos of a home improvement show that aired in the mid 80's and didn't provide any insight to new techniques and current tools.",1187827200,7,230,4.775
8015988,3,B0001PCCDW,"I've only skimmed this DVD from the library. The menu system is great, it's divided by ALL the MANY different things they teach. Most of it is the basic stuff, nothing demolition or construction that you'd want a contractor for.  The con is you can easily tell it's an old VHS from the late 80s - early 90s? & though there's no date.. at one point, an electrician says, ""If your wall switch doesn't work, you can trade if for many other styles..."" He shows all the old ones & then says, ""here's a brand new special one called a ROCKER switch...""
Here's the scary thing, he shows you how to take out the old wall light switch & replace it, but never mentions *just in case for the forgetful or total newbie* to turn OFF the POWER to that switch so you don't literally kill yourself. Now I know that's common sense & no one likes to be reminded of something so obvious, but since this geared specifically for the people new at this, shouldn't they have to?",1137456000,17,954,4.329608938547486
