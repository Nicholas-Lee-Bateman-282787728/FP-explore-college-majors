2786125,4,B000NVT0SY,"Many reviews had deterred me from purhasing this movie.  Reviews that mentioned how few fight scenes there were and how boring it was.  Perhaps it was the low expectations that made me enjoy the holy hell out of it!  The cast alone makes this worth a view if you're a fan of old-school kung fu.  Add to that some classic screwball comedy and MAGNIFICENT fights once they do arrive and you've got a winner.  Directed by and starring the great Sammo Hung, this flick has more great fighters in it than possibly any other movie ever put together!  To even attempt to name them all is just silly.  Ironically this might be the only film that Hoi San Lee wasn't in!

Sammo stars as Chin Fong Tin, a perpetual screw-up and outlaw who decides to sabotage a train and dump off its passengers in a plot to earn some revenue for the town he grew up in.  A town he recently populated with his band of loyal prostitutes!  Well, they do make money.  The train isn't exactly filled with average tourists.  3 Japanese fighters (who are so cool they should really have their own movie) have stolen some kind of scroll and most of the people on the train are trying to get it back.  Tons of ememies will have to come together to fight off a HUGE group of bandits who were following the train and take over the town.

Other than a great fight between Sammo and Yuen Biao, the film offers little action until the final third.  A final third that in my opinion is well worth waiting for.  Some one-on-ones worth mentioning: Sammo vs Cynthia Rothrock; Yuen Biao vs Dick Wei (who fought Biao, Sammo, and Jackie Chan in tons of films of this era, including all 3 at once in Chan's ""Project A""); and my personal favorite, the all-too-brief brawl between Yasuaki Kurata and Richard Norton.  I am not familiar with the particular style that Kurata uses but it's mesmerizing!  It deserves its own flick.  If someone knows what it is, please tell me and I'll write one myself!  Besides Kurata, the other two Japanese thieves are played by the great Korean super-kicker Hwang Jang Lee and the lovely Oshima Yukari, whom I've never seen before but is fantastic.

Dragon Dynasty's release is fantastic as usual.  Nice widescreen presentation.  If you don't recognize a lot of the cast members, Bey Logan's commentary will help significantly.  This item is not listed on Dragon Dynasty's website anymore so if this sounds interesting you may not want to hesitate.  In Cantonese with English subtitles or English dubbed.  If you love kung fu and count patience as a virtue then this is highly recommended.

2786126,5,B000NVT0SY,"A masterpiece. Not a movie you skip to the fight scenes watching. You'll watch it front to back every time. Yuen Biu stands out in a stellar performance both physically and dramatically. Oh, and there's a lot of laughs too!",1294272000,2,223,4.6
2786127,5,B000NVT0SY,"This is a multi story movie. Which makes it more interesting. There are some scenes which are humorous, showing the nature of people, no matter from what country.

It has been dubbed in English, and helps a lot. Instead of trying to read what is being spoken, one gets the idea quicly.

Also, although not mentioned in the actor credits, Jackie Chan has a part in this movie. The first time I saw the movie, I did not catch him in it. After I read an article that he was in the movie, I watched it again and, yes there he was.

If you are a fan and buy this movie, see if you find him.",1244419200,,585,4.025862068965517
2786128,4,B000NVT0SY,"This film is a typically wacky caper, more of interest for hardcore fans of The 3 Dragons: Sammo, Yuen Biao, and Jackie Chan.  While it features some exceptional fighting in the last reel, any viewer not thoroughly steeped in HK films will have to work pretty hard to make it through the first 2/3rds of the movie.

This movie tosses in everything but the kitchen sink.  Slapstick and broad physical comedy is the main focus.  The filmmakers just went crazy with all the characters, situations, and plot elements: a Wild West town in China, Samurai, Wong Fei Hung, Confederate soldiers, bank robbers, train robbers, jail breaks, fat jokes, a Madam her and prostitutes, a Keystone Cops-style fire fighting caper with Jackie-Chan-esque stunts, and an enormous cast featuring at least half the actors in Hong Kong (including Lau Kar Leung, Jimmy Wang Yu and Corey Yuen Kwai to name three out of dozens!)--and none of it makes any sense whatsoever.  A lot of the humor is less than childish and will simply fall flat on most western audiences, unless you are really sensitized to this particular genre.

A lot of the humor is lost through the subtitle massacre that is perpetrated here.  I'm assuming the producers of the DVD simply re-typed in bolder face the original British-mandated subtitles that every HK movie was required to be released with back when the movie was originally made.  You'll have to work really hard to even come close to figuring out what the characters are saying, let alone get the jokes.

The plot is almost non-existent, and it doesn't take a genius to guess where it is all headed: a giant battle in which the huge and unwieldy cast comes together to beat the tar out of each other.  There is some pretty impressive fighting, including a good showdown between Sammo and Cynthia Rothrock.  Unfortunately, this show-stopping melee is over all too quickly, leaving the viewer with an appetite whetted for better movies featuring these same actors.

Why did I give this movie 4 stars then?  For the true HK film lover, this movie shouldn't be missed.  Just seeing all these actors jammed into the same picture is a treat.  You can spot about 50 of the best known film people in Hong Kong at the time, and they seen to be having a blast working together.  The fight between Rothrock and Sammo, Biao and Sammo, Richard Norton vs 3 samurai, the Lucky Stars gang pulling their usual pranks, the scene with a young Wong Fei Hung and his dad, are all treasures of a particular time and place and an era of film making history that will always have a very special spot in the hearts of the fans.  The extras are very well done, including an illuminating interview with Cynthia Rothrock, and typically fascinating commentary by Bey Logan, which alone is of interest to the fans.

In short, for the hardcore fans of this era of HK movies, this is a worthwhile and highly amusing artifact.  For most normal people, I'd think twice before attempting to make sense of this mess!",1243814400,8,2988,4.722543352601156
2786129,4,B000NVT0SY,"When you have Sammo hung, Cynthis Rothrock, Richard Norton and Yuen Biao in one movie, your gonna get some serious butt kicking. This a really awesome film, with some great fights and stunts. I did not give this the five star that some people will give it. The reason is, that this DVD version is a few minutes shorter than the video version. But, nonetheless, this is an excellent film to view if you enjoy some serious Hong Kong kung fu action!!!",1222387200,,448,4.475609756097561
2786130,4,B000NVT0SY,"SHANGHAI EXPRESS (1986), one of the greatest action comedies of Hong Kong cinema, is better known as MILLIONAIRES' EXPRESS and is finally out in a beautifully mastered DVD edition for U.S. fans under this alternate title (not to be confused with the Marlene Dietrich classic of the same name). Sammo Hung (EASTERN CONDORS) both stars and directs and his frequent partner, Yuen Biao (PRODIGAL SON), co-stars. (Their other frequent partner at the time, Jackie Chan, is nowhere to be found.) The plot involves a trainload of rich passengers forced to stay overnight in a remote Chinese town, all part of a scheme by the town's black sheep, Cheng (Hung), a fugitive from the law, to bring prosperity to the town. Meanwhile, a gang of armed bandits on horseback, having made plans to rob the train, now sets its sights on taking over the town and plundering it. Only Cheng, along with the town's provincial police force and a trio of Japanese martial artists who were on the train, can take the town back in a rousing 20-minute fight finale.

There are multiple characters and numerous plot threads established early on. Classic farce comedy elements abound, including a philandering train passenger who must divide his time between his oversized wife and his mistress, leading to a hilarious scene at the hotel in town where numerous parties, including some bumbling gangsters, converge on the wrong room and keep having to hide under beds and in closets as different characters come in and out. Among the great Hong Kong comic performers on hand are Richard Ng, Lydia Shum, Fan Mei-sheng and Eric Tsang.

The real draw for martial arts fans is the large cast of international stars in the cast: American karate champ Cynthia Rothrock, in only her second film; Australian Richard Norton; Korean Hwang Jang Li (as one of the Japanese); and two Japanese stars who made their names in HK films, Yasuaki Kurata (FIST OF LEGEND) and Yukari Oshima (IRON ANGELS). In addition, there is a dazzling array of old-school kung fu talent on hand, including Jimmy Wang Yu, Phillip Ko, Wang Lung Wei, Lau Kar Wing, Bolo Yeung, Hsiao Hou, Corey Yuen, Dick Wei and Shih Kien (Han from ENTER THE DRAGON), in addition, of course, to two of the greatest, Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao.

The film was shot in Thailand, Canada, and Hong Kong (where the town set was built). If I have any complaint it's that the film is too short. The final action could easily have been extended and we learn from one of the disc's extras that many scenes were shot with numerous other Hong Kong stars but weren't used in the final cut. I'd love to see those.

The disc offers an English dub, as well as the preferred original Cantonese language track with subtitles. It comes with three new and informative interviews with Sammo Hung, Yuen Biao and Cynthia Rothrock, as well as audio commentary by Hong Kong film expert Bey Logan. Also, there are four deleted scenes provided as an extra, one about 5 minutes long and the other three adding up to about a minute and forty seconds total. I have an earlier Hong Kong import disc of the film that includes all four of the ""deleted"" scenes but in an otherwise shorter (96 minute) version of the film, meaning that the 102-minute cut on this disc has 12 minutes of footage missing from my earlier disc.",1201392000,20,3301,4.725694444444445
2786131,3,B000NVT0SY,"This is the first Dragon Dynasty release that I can't fully recommend.  With all the great Sammo Hung films they could have suped up they pick this mixed bag?  More interested in individual comedy scenes and fights than any real character development or plot, the movie is altogether too slow much of the way.  Comedy and action are normally two great tastes that taste great together in kung fu movies such as Drunken Master and Magnificient Butcher, but here the jokes and slapstick scenes just aren't very funny and after seeing several in a row you'll be yearning for the fast forward button(if not the stop button).  But for those that can make it through the first 53 minutes(53 minutes!?!?) the action as choreagraphed by Hung and Biao is top notch.  In fact, the 3 star rating is on the films fight scenes alone, which are such a contrast to the film because they are so brutal, realistic, and bone-crunching, yet surrounded by a film that feels as if it was written as they went(and not well)... more fighting in the first half and some good editing could merit another star(the action is THAT good) but as is, 3 may even be too generous.",1188777600,3,1147,4.602941176470588

Sammo and Yeun Buio are fantasic they had every major Hong Kong action star in this film and CYNTHIA ROTHROCK is deadly and she fights exstreamly well. look at the intervews with some of the stars at the end you will love it and enjoy the film.",1186617600,,487,3.8316831683168315

8181985,3,B000NVT0SY,"The movie is in Cantonese with English subtitles.  Lots of major Hong Kong super stars in this film.  The story is simple.  A train with a bunch of wealthy people is coming through town, a small town that no one really stays.  It has all the basic amenities and a small police force.  Sammo, who owns a hotel in this town, is also a small time thief, whom a federal agent is trying to track down.  Sammo decides he's going to blow up this train in order to force the wealthy passengers to have no choice but to stay at his hotel and to raise the economic value of this small town.  The police learns of his plans and is trying to stop him, but they fail.  The train is stopped and the passengers all stay.  Among the passengers are a small group of Japanese who holds the map to a Chinese relic, and a gang that is trying to steal the map from the Japanese.  In the middle of the night a large group of mountain bandits raids the town knowing that these wealthy people are staying there.  Fights pursue.  Kung-fu scenes are well choreographed, but don't expect a lot of it.  There is humor in this film, but not much in terms of emotions.",1509494400,,1138,4.212962962962963

8181990,4,B000NVT0SY,"Jackie Chan wrote that Yuen Biao had more talent than either he or Sammo.  Unfortunately, the only times he's been able to display it is when he's been in projects with them, and in this one he gets a chance to shine.  In Shanghai Express Sammo Hung has created a movie with a lot of humor and great fight choreography that shows off the talents of all the performers, which includes Cynthia Rothrock in an excellant fight scene.
