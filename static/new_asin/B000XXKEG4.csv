8230234,5,B000XXKEG4,"These mini work outs are great and VERY EFFECTIVE. I like that he doesn't count reps - you do as many as he does or whatever you can in a certain amount of seconds (what a concept!). He recommends doing one 15-minute segment daily, but I do the five work outs as one work out (1 hour 15 minutes). I also have his other tapes: 8-minute abs, 8-minute arms, 8-minute buns, etc which I highly recommend. I CANNOT BELIEVE how quickly I am shaping up! Jamie chooses the best exercises, does them in a short amount of time, and they are very enjoyable. These exercises work VERY QUICKY and take years (no decades!) off your figure! Jamie Brenkus has created an exercise breakthrough!! I have never had such quick results using an exercise tape(s). I wish I heard of him years ago!! A+",1340928000,,777,4.440559440559441
8230235,5,B000XXKEG4,"If I could wish for anything, it would be for Mr Brenkus to do an updated version of these tapes on DVD.  I was introduced to this series years ago by my mother and fell in love with them because you can get a decent workout in just 15 minutes.  With my packed schedule, it's made it possible for me to stay in shape no matter what.  These workouts are designed exactly for that person on the go, especially a beginner, who wants to get and stay in shape.",1292371200,,455,4.089887640449438
