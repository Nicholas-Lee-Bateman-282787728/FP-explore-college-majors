8180943,5,B000NRAMI0,"I bought this tape from Amazon in 2012. I have sewn for a long time and know for certain the techniques Judy shows on this tape can be used in other areas, not just tailoring. The box should have an insert containing the directions and pattern for her method of doing the pocket welt and trimming seams, before cutting the fabric. I have quite a book, VHS and CD library and she is one of my favourites. I love the fact she loves what she does and would suggest you run, not walk, to buy one of these before they are gone. I wish it had been  reproduced in DVD format - tapes snap eventually. I'd give 10 stars if I could.

Update, same day. I discovered it is available in DVD, it's expensive and not from Amazon.",1421798400,,714,4.166666666666667
