1871402,5,B00008YLUP,"I recently came across this film (DVD) never having had any clue of its existence. I was profoundly affected by it in no small measure due to the wonderful performances of the major players (as well as those of the supporting cast of very competent Hollywood regulars).
Richard Chamberlain (Thaddeus), Michael Imperioli (Allen) and James Duval (Jaime) in particular give heartfelt performances that, in my opinion, either confirmed reasons for (as in the case of Chamberlain) or predicted (as in the case of Imperioli and Duval) the great success of these actors . Chamberlain has intonations and expressions that come from nothing short of great insight into the pains of a character who is facing a death with romantic frustrations. Imperioli, on the other hand, displays a mix of decency and  occasional rage which so typifies a person who has internal good within but still has been screwed up by the world around him.
James Duval displays uncanny understanding of the nuances of psychological complexity associated with many street hustlers who, very often, need a little love even when they may not let themselves admit it. He will forever be remembered and seen in this movie as the good looking, clean cut, tough, street smart kid who holds it all in until the end when he comes to realize the feelings he holds that he has previously been afraid to embrace. It's all masterfully summed up with his tearful expressions of affection towards the end of the film. The renderings of Clare De Lune in the background of the Santa Monica street scene at the beginning of the film and Mozart's Requiem at the end express the fleeting nature of youth, beauty and life while emoting deep feelings of sorrow and tragedy. The appropriate playing of Ave Verum Corpus towards the end of the film during the art show coincides with an action that Jamie has initiated which, as the ending of the movie seems to indicate, could result in a step towards his salvation (as well as Allen's).
A director's cut DVD should be made including a ""making of ""documentary. Independent films such as this are not to be forgotten. Period.",1129507200,5,2116,4.845303867403315
1871403,1,B00008YLUP,I rented this movie on .99 cents night and it wasn't worth it.  It wasn't worth the drive to the video store.  Ugh!,1078790400,2,115,3.9565217391304346
1871404,5,B00008YLUP,Very well done.  Loved every minute of it.  However it is a matter of taste as to whether on not you will like it.  More than one of the characters really hit home with me.  Certainly much better than many of the movies out there which are full of the same old boring young straight predicable characters.,1065139200,3,305,4.298245614035087
1871405,1,B00008YLUP,"A dreadful waste of talent and celluloid. If you get to the end, ask yourself ""What was the point."" There was none. Thaddeus (Chamberlain), an aging gay man in the final stages of AIDS, sets out to find the two ""loves"" of his life--2 street hustlers--under the guise of ""helping"" them by leaving them his non-existent inheritance and imparting his ""wisdom"" (also non-existent, as far as I could tell). One of the hustlers had apparently gotten his life in order UNTIL the arrival of his former ""lover"" (Chamberlain); the other hustler, who looked like he would have been about 10 when he was involved with Chamberlain alternates between street hustling and aspiring to be a Buddhist monk. (Huh?)  At the end of the film, Chamberlain is dead and BOTH former lovers are back on the street. (Huh?) Dreadful dialogue. ""Since we're both [expletive deleted]-up, we might as well be [expletive-deleted]-up together.""  Seeing a wonderful actor like Richard Chamberlain as an over-the-top effeminate old man was embarrassing and made me cringe.",1057881600,6,1035,5.08235294117647
1871406,4,B00008YLUP,"RIVER MADE TO DROWN IN has so much going for it that it is a shame it did not enjoy a wider audience when it was released.  Perhaps with Richard Chamberlain's new book about his 'coming out' on the bookstore shelves more interest will be created for this well made, well acted, albeit dark film.  This is a slice of life in LA that manages to capture an atmosphere that propels the story of a once wealthy lawyer who, dying of AIDS, returns to an ex-lover to 'replay' his former life before dying.  Richard Chamberlain is Thaddeus and the 'hustler' to whom he turns is Allen, played to perfection by Michael Imperioli.  Allen is still 'hustling' but at this point his target is a female gallery owner (another excellent performance by Ute Lemper). Thaddeus moves in with Allen with the proviso that Allen find Thaddeus' last hustler lover, one Jaime (again played with conviction and subtlely by James Duval)for final goodbyes.  In the end all are faced with the emptiness of the 'live life for the moment ethic' of the Hustler and the John and the vacuum created by Thaddeus' death seems to open the door of possible change for those remaining.
Though obviously a low budget film, the director makes excellent use of lighting and locations to create the seedy stench of Santa Monica Bovd and the attendant degrading scenes.  The music score uses Mozart's ""Ave Verum Corpus"" and the 'Lacrymosa' from his Requiem to fine effect.  In the end it is the quality of performances by Chamberlain, Imperioli (his most sensitive role to date and not at all like his role in The Sopranos), Lemper, and Duval (along with some fine cameo roles from the supporting cast) that makes this a film well worth seeing.  Though not for the staunchly homophobic viewer, the general public will gain a better understanding about a segment of life that is usually hidden from view.",1057795200,11,1858,4.730650154798762
1871407,3,B00008YLUP,"""River Made To Drown In"" looks at Allen Hayden (played by Michael Imperioli), an ex-hustler trying to make good as a modern painter. Allen is wooing an encouraging, well-to-do art gallery owner, Eva Kline (played by Ute Lemper). Then along comes Thaddeus MacKenzie (played by Richard Chamberlain), a wealthy lawyer client of Allen's from years back. Thaddeus, closing out his life before he dies from AIDS, asks to stay with Allen and asks Allen to perform one last favor, to find another, current hustler named Jaime (played by James Duval). Thaddeus loved just Allen and Jaime and wants to do well by both of them. Allen resists but takes on the task. What does Eva think of all this? Why does Jaime lead so dangerous life and not cooperate? As events move along, Allen has to figure out who he really is and how he can make a difference. He ends up an ok guy.
It is surprising such a movie would have so strong a cast in the key roles. Chamberlain gives Thaddeus a hearty gay-CEO bonhommie, deliberately (and appropriately) trying to bluster and charm his way past others. Michael Imperioli's Allen is a defensive guy in a shell who lashes out when others get too close. James Duval's Jaime is a believably wary hustler and a believably seeking Buddhist. The supporting cast is fair.
The concept of Allen's character development was interesting. The script was moderately good.
Allen and Jaime have some dreary to mildly kinky discreet sex scenes with clients. Skin shots are primarily and frequently of Allen. Jaime and Thaddeus display considerably less. In this arena, the back cover of the DVD case, the DVD itself, and the menu all contain a hot-looking picture of Jaime and his co-worker Luis (played by Michael Saucedo) in a bathtub. In the movie, there are only a couple of five-second glorified head-shots from this scene. This advertising still/deleted material could have gone into a photo gallery.
The end credits announce a ""making of"" team, but the DVD has no ""making of"", deleted scenes, interviews, photo gallery, or commentary. The film deserves more.",1057104000,14,2071,4.8696883852691215

7988176,2,B00008YLUP,"Michael Imperioli and Ute Lemper are convincing except when the script fails them. Chamberlain, whom I respect, mostly indicates and rarely convinces.

7988177,4,B00008YLUP,"For reasons unknown to me, director James Merendino signed this film as Allen Smithee, a usual sign of discomfort with the final product, or meaning a clash between producers and director. I exchanged correspondence with its producer-actor Jon Powell, who has in important role in the film, and he seemed satisfied with the film; so I still wonder what the reason was for Merendino's credit, because ""River Made To Drown In"" is a very good film that in its own way conveys the same feeling of despair and love for youth-as-art found in ""Death in Venice"" but in the 1990s. Written by Paul Marius (who plays the manager of a sex club), it is a perceptive look at the relationship between young male prostitutes and their much older clients (""johns""). These are usually persons beyond their sixties who still seek quick and impersonal sex among young guys who could care less for their old-age anguish. Richard Chamberlain plays Thaddeus MacKenzie, an old lawyer with AIDS, who wants to spend his last days with the only two persons he loved, two young hustlers. Allen Hayden (Michael Imperioli) has changed his life style and has become an artist. He is having an affair with Eva (Ute Lemper), a wealthy gallery owner who knows nothing about his past. The other one is even younger, Jaime (James Duval), the son of an ex model and a Buddhist monk, who wants to raise enough money to go visit his father. It is interesting that a young man like Marius, has come with an incisive story and some keen dialogues that could have been written by someone older and perhaps ""wiser"". What makes the Allen Smithee credit more intriguing is that Merendino is a filmmaker with real talent for directing actors, for composition, and with a good eye for expressing the inherent affective dislocation of the story. He receives good help from cinematographer Thomas Callaway, whose angles, use of cranes, hand-held camera or play with depth of field, convey the distortion of these people's lives. On the other hand, editor Esther P. Russell made a very good job suggesting the fragmentation of the daily experience of these persons. The cross-cutting between different scenes transforms dialogues to an extent that they have greater meaning because of her editing: take, for example, the dialogue between Thaddeus and Eva on a bench, while both Allen and Jaime are involved in different places, in unpleasant situations with their male clients. There is no place for silly sentimentality or gratuitous sex scenes here (unless they have been cut), although the story is about love and love-making: it is a bleak, almost heartless film, as most of the characters are. But even then, Merendino and Marius show real affection for these people, and have made a very rewarding and intelligent feature on the hustler scene.",1391299200,,2799,4.919661733615222
7988178,5,B00008YLUP,This movie was a heart wrenching but sad movie about a homosexual man who is dying of Aids that goes back to where he started from.,1362787200,,131,4.076923076923077
7988179,1,B00008YLUP,"The director of this film (James Merendino) wished to remain anonymous -hence the use of the name Allen Smithee in the publicity. It is clear to see why the Meredino decided not to have his name attached to this tedious work. The script never really gets beyond the mundane; it is stilted and gives the impression of being written by a group of drama students extemporising on the nature of relationships. The line ""I prefer warm hearted conversation to frigid sex anytime ..."" may have been said with a slight irony (the line ends ""...actually I'm lying""); but once you realize that this is the best line in the movie you KNOW that you are in for a tedious viewing.

The story is, ostensibly, about a dying lawyer (Thaddeus MacKenzie, played by Richard Chamberlain) trying to spend his final days with the only people that have meant anything to him (two young hustlers). Unfortunately, the major flaw in this film is that none of the main characters have any redeeming features. As a result, the audience can never meaningfully engage with the central characters' situation. This is not good for retaining the viewer's attention (well not this viewer's attention anyway).

Chamberlain's performance is painful and makes you long for a power-cut so that the misery can end. At one point, infuriated with the ex young hustler, he attacks him with the piercing phrase ""You're as transparent as cheap crystal"". His portrayal, of a man dying from an HIV related illness, is wooden and pedestrian. To borrow a phrase from Gore Vidal, or was it Noel Coward? ""You'd have to have a heart of stone not to have laughed out loud at MacKenzie's eventual demise""

This film was banned in Singapore, probably on the grounds that no one should be subjected to gay-themed cinema that is this bad! You have been warned.",1269302400,2,1803,4.790996784565916

 Has a great lesson of life and how to live it!",1244764800,2,203,3.5681818181818183
7988182,5,B00008YLUP,Powerful performance by Mr Richard Chamberlain and a completely different one which goes out to show that no subject is difficult for great actors. The story itself is very dark and edgy and everyone else in the cast has done quite a decent job.,1193529600,2,245,4.590909090909091
7988183,1,B00008YLUP,"As ""plot"" summaries are mentioned earlier on these pages, let me get straight to the point: This is a godawful waste of time. The best thing that can be said about this film is that the camera angles were interesting. Other than that, this boring chatfest features a must-be-seen performance by Dick Chamberlain where he channels Bette Davis, Truman Capote, and Winston Churchill -- simultaneously.

So, a dying gay lawyer wants to leave his fortune to two hustlers he spent time with. Okay -- an intriguing premise. But unfortunately, there is not one single believable relationship or character in the entire film.

I kept watching this film in amazement. The ""lead"" hustler kept saying either to others or to himself, ""What do you mean? Why did you say that? Why the f**k am I here? What the f**k does that mean?"" and questions of that nature. And as he asked them, so did I: What was the meaning of this whole insane waste of time?

Then there were fun scenes with the ""big stars"" -- Talia Shire ""plays"" the ""part"" of ""mother"" of the second hustler. She has two pointless, irritating scenes, one where the only thing taking up the frame is her head and her hustler son's head as she rambles and goes on about something that had no meaning. Then later we get to see her sleeping in a chair. Good job, Talia! Another Oscar nomination for you!

But the worst offender of all is Dick Chamberlain. Dick says certain lines as if he has imbued them with some magical wit or humor or sarcasm, as if he has elevated them to some Shakespearean level. As if what he is forced to say has some meaning. Hate to break it to you Dick: it doesn't -- none of it does, did or will.

This movie almost defies description. If you want to study what not to do when making a movie, this would be an excellent reference.

This movie satisfied my curiousity about the lives of hustlers: sad, tragic, dangerous, filled with unhappiness and loneliness.",1147478400,5,1930,4.547550432276657
