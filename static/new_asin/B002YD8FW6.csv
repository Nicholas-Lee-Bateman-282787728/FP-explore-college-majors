8503037,5,B002YD8FW6,"This collection of short films, each river in a nicely edited 4 minute segment, covers the mainly rural streams and rivers of Illinois which are most usable by canoeists and kayakers.  I have loaned my copy out so I don't have the list of included streams, but it is very comprehensive.

The filmmaker details where to go, what you will see there, how to know if the river is runnable that day, what skill level is needed, etc. A very well done package, with a nice DVD menu system to get you to the info you need. It will introduce, even for those that think they know an area, a whole new collection of streams that you may not have even known were accessible.

If you are an enthusiast of this area, or considering travel here, it belongs in your collection.",1277942400,,761,4.382978723404255
