3771540,3,B001QYBPH6,"I really thought that these were different or new episodes from the TV series ""A Haunting.""  They are actually older episodes that have already been broadcast and are 6 or 7 years old.  I didn't realize this until I received the DVD and started watching it.  Maybe it's partly my fault for not researching a bit more.  They are interesting episodes, but I had already seen them before.  The title under ""A Haunting"" says ""The Anguished"" and that threw me off thinking this was something new. So, if you are expecting entirely new episodes, please know that these are not new and have been previously aired.",1381017600,7,606,4.679245283018868
3771541,5,B001QYBPH6,I am obsessed with all things paranormal and A Haunting dvd series portray many real-life accounts into authentic and truly scary ordeals!,1379894400,,138,5.318181818181818
3771542,5,B001QYBPH6,"Great series, and a great addition to add to your at home collection to scare yourself and guests whenever you want. The fact that these are true stories make the chill factor even better to watch....but if you don't have one..get a bedside small lamp to leave on at night. You will probably be glad to have purchased both......Great to watch all year long!!!!",1350777600,2,360,4.640625
3771543,5,B001QYBPH6,"I watch this series all the time.  I have watched each movie probably 10 times each and I still get scared.  If you like scary, than you should get it",1320883200,4,150,3.966666666666667
3771544,5,B001QYBPH6,"I enjoyed these movies. I like that it was based on true happenings. It kept you interested during the whole movie. I plan to get all the ""A Haunting"" series. The price for them is real reasonable. In my opinion they was worth every penny I spent on them.",1281744000,12,255,4.224489795918367

8336850,3,B001QYBPH6,"These are,I believe,from season 1 or 2,which I had already,but because I couldn't find names of episodes in the information I was thinking they were different from what I had purchased years ago. The good thing is they didn't cost much and I know some people who would probably enjoy them. I liked the 2nd disc best!!! The Ghost Hunter is one of my favorite episodes from earlier seasons!",1456963200,,388,4.63768115942029

8336853,5,B001QYBPH6,"A Haunting has been one of my favorites since the pilot, 'A Haunting in Connecticut' premiered back in 2002 and was disappointed when the show was canceled in 2007 after four excellent seasons. (The show was later renewed in 2012 by Destination America.)

I was pretty excited to find A Haunting-The Anguished. The cover art is pretty cool and I was thinking these were new episodes. No Such Luck. The four episodes in this set: The Awakening, The Calling, The Apartment, and The Ghost Hunter are creepy and presented in 1.33 full frame and spread across two dvds. This would be great except all the episodes are from the previously released Season Four.

So BEWARE! If you own the Season Four Box Set, there is no reason to spend your money on this. This might be good as an inexpensive gift for someone but If you don't own any of A Haunting Sets, I'd recommend buying the season sets that over this sampler.",1428796800,8,910,4.576687116564417
8336854,5,B001QYBPH6,"I bought as many of these as I could find.  I love ""A Haunting"".",1426464000,,64,3.5714285714285716
