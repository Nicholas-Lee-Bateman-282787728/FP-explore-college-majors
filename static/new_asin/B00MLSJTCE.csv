6588333,1,B00MLSJTCE,"This is a bootleg cd. This is not APPLE CORPS LTD., nor Capital Records. This is a knock-off piece of trash. Certainly, the artists themselves get no royalties. You're giving your money to some bubba who makes these dvds in his basement, or orders them from Hong Kong, where International Copyright Laws are not respected.  LET IT BE isn't released yet. Not by Apple, not until the end of 2005 or early 2006. So, how come this one is for sale? Because it's a fake. Anyone can cut and paste an apple logo from the internet onto a dvd cover.",1126224000,5,539,4.39
6588334,5,B00MLSJTCE,"First, I'd like to say a few words on the film, as it stands now. Then, at the bottom, is the most recent news on the DVD release. If you are most interested in that, skip my review. At present the film is only available on bootleg. However, judging from the digital transfer of the film seen, in part, in the DVD version of BEATLES ANTHOLOGY, Apple's release promises to be a real treat. Even tho much has been made of how depressing this film is, I think for cinema verite, and modern esthetic tastes, it makes a statement that far outweighs its significance, as the BEATLES ""breakup"" film. In fact, much more than say, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR, or ""HELP"", this film has truly improved with time. I see it as the template for modern band documentaries.(Compare it to Wilco's ARE YOU TRYING TO BREAK MY HEART, or TMBG's A TALE OF TWO JOHNS.) There is a bit of the ""THE MAKING OF 'LET IT BE' the LP"" in there. Those types of DVDs are very popular, for classic albums. Then there is the final Beatles' concert, the legendary Rooftop Concert, which has been copied for videos, or parodied, countless times. Ironic, because so few Beatles fans have even seen it. Finally, the film ends with some music videos (The acoustic ""videos"" of LET IT BE, LONG AND WINDING ROAD, and TWO OF US). The way the film shows a month in the life of the Beatles, how they returned to their roots, how they learned material for new LPs, how they conceptualized and interacted, and even how they incorperated a ""new member"" into the band, at least for the show, (i.e. Billy Preston) gives the film enormous musical significance. Sure, it lays bare the band's infighting, the alpha dog fights common to ALL bands. I like that. It shattered the Beatle's myth of 4 perfectly mannered lads, and seperated them from the MONKEES-type, corperate manufactored stereotypes. The Beatles had the courage, to show us their humanity. There are so many FIRSTS in this movie, that had any band shown their LP recording process, mixing it in with videos and concert footage, it would have been historic, a true first. (The filming of the evolution of the song SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL in 1968, was an important first step. Still, that film was NOT about the Stones. Filming the song's sessions' evolution, was an analogy for the 1968 student revolutions in Europe.) The LET IT BE film was the first time an LP was analysed, pulled apart, and the LP's evolution fully exposed. Who did it? THE BEATLES, the most beloved band in R&R history. For that reason alone, maybe it was underrated. People didn't expect this, they wanted another ""HELP"". A HARD DAYS NIGHT showed that rock movies could be cool. LET IT BE showed that rock documentaries, could also be cool.

Now, let's talk about the OFFICAL RELEASE OF THE DVD.  Here are the FACTS, reported in MOJO MAGAZINE, September 2005 Issue, page 25.

It says the film will be released next month, with fully restored color, and remarkable extras. These extras include THE COMPLETE ROOFTOP CONCERT. Also included will be in studio audio material that was only available up onto now, thru Yellow Dog's DAY BY DAY bootlegs. The article also said, that the tapes that were confiscated in 2003, the previously mentioned audio tapes, will allow more film to be included as EXTRAS, which was silent footage up until now. I believe that this is the BEATLES release for the 2005 XMAS shopping season. And then, Christmas 2006, who knows? Perhaps the reissue of the rest of the Beatles CDS 24-bit remastered?",1125792000,18,3497,4.673701298701299
6588335,5,B00MLSJTCE,"If you really want to see the  movie no matter what the quality is, you're better off buying the bootleg 'cuz it's not coming out in September.

But, it was worth it.",1124928000,3,334,4.409836065573771
6588336,4,B00MLSJTCE,"I bought this DVD and it was a ""burned"" copy of a DVD that was almost certainly not authorized. Having said that,it is good to have this classic in any form. While not up to the standards of the ""Anthology"" DVD, it looks the way I remember it when I saw it originally in the theatre. The sound and picture quality are more than adequate. Get it while you can !",1120176000,9,360,4.084507042253521

6588338,3,B00MLSJTCE,"As LET IT BE has not been officially released on DVD in the U.S. I question the quality and legality of any DVDs being offered.

LET IT BE was officially released on Laserdisc and VHS in the very early 1980's before getting pulled by George Harrison.

I know that Paul & Ringo were planning on restoring the movie, now that George has passed away, but only the re-orchestrated CD came out.",1116633600,26,389,4.464788732394366
6588339,2,B00MLSJTCE,"Two stars because it's the Beatles, but the miserable, muddy quality of the images is a real disappointment, especially after I'd seen clips of the rooftop concert on YouTube that are sharp, crisp, and retain good color values. The fact that this film has been issued under the name of a major studio is an embarrassment. Is there no way to see a high quality version of this film other than in the bits and pieces of it on YouTube? I urge potential buyers to steer clear of this mess.",1504742400,,485,4.4
6588340,5,B00MLSJTCE,"I gave it 5 stars because I was glad to be able to see this documentary again and get a glimpse of them working in the studio.  As people who have already watched it ages ago already know, it is an honest - too honest - portrayal of a point in time and shows the Fab Four sharing some not so fab moments, warts and all.  The rooftop concert is still very good to see even though the event leaves the viewer with a sense of sadness if they lived through this and the events that ended the myth.  It's easy to forget that these were still four young guys in their 20s at the time this was made because for those of us grew up with them as the soundtrack to our youth, they seem like elders or contemporaries.",1504569600,,706,4.0285714285714285

6588343,3,B00MLSJTCE,"I was planning to buy this DVD.  Then I saw several references to ""bootleg"", so I did some research.  In the Wikipedia website, this is what I found:  >> The film has not been officially available since the 1980s, although original and bootleg copies of home video releases still circulate. The film's director Michael Lindsay-Hogg stated in 2011 that a DVD and Blu-ray was possibly going to be released sometime in 2013.<<<",1502755200,,424,4.861111111111111

6588345,4,B00MLSJTCE,"I didn't purchase this for me, rather for my husband whose a huge Beatles fan. We were in the truck talking and he was telling me about this video, the release of it, and his inability to locate a copy. While he was talking, I got on Amazon, just to check to see if it was available yet and there it was. I ordered it immediately. Personally, I can understand why it wasn't released for so long as it's really a ho-hum production UNTIL the end when they begin performing and then it's worth owning. The only roof-top parts we've been able to view have been on YouTube, so we were thrilled to experience the entire concert. This may not be a great production, but it is a monumental moment in history that should be owned and passed down. We'll be doing that :-).",1502323200,2,762,4.298611111111111

6588362,5,B00MLSJTCE,Better than expected.  Amazing gem and great insight on the Beatles writing style.  No narrative but that added so much character and context to the film in an interesting way.  Highly recommend this copy.  The seller was quick to ship and it was much better quality than expected.  It was created in 1969 so don't expect it to be HD.  Amazing just amazing.  Thank you to the seller for having this and letting people into this great piece of history.,1494892800,,451,4.5625
6588363,3,B00MLSJTCE,"This DVD will have to suffice until there is an official release. The quality is OK and if you can accept that, then the content is good. I saw this at the movie theater when it first came out in 1971 I think and really enjoyed it. I also rented it on VHS a loooong time ago and have been patiently waiting for the official DVD or Blu Ray release. Since there doesn't seem to be any good information on the official release, which would be much better quality, I had to settle for this version. That being said, I was not disappointed and the rooftop concert alone is reason enough to buy this.",1491177600,3,594,4.219298245614035

6588370,3,B00MLSJTCE,I'd give it five stars if the audio wasn't so bad.  I don't know if it was the recording or the DVD but conversation is almost entirely garbled and unrecognizable. Was this a bootleg? It is also nearly the same quality as a home movie. So there is a bit of frustration in viewing this historic event.,1489190400,3,300,4.2631578947368425
6588371,5,B00MLSJTCE,"Don't listen to the negative reviews. If you are old enough to have seen, and remember the original this may be as close as you can get to recreating that experience.  Also, to all the geniuses complaining about the quality, the original was recorded on 16mm and will look that way, as does pretty much any other documentary film of that time period. It looks the same as it did in the theater in 1970.  So, the bottom line is be realistic about what can be expected and enjoy this film for what it is.",1487548800,25,502,4.273684210526316

6588374,5,B00MLSJTCE,"So great to hear and see them again.  I feel just like I did when I was 14 yrs old in 1964 when I first saw them on The Ed Sullivan Show.  Sooo many memories and such wonderful music that is still great today.  Amazing time, amazing band, amazing music.",1485648000,9,253,4.02

6588378,3,B00MLSJTCE,"I love it for the historical aspects...but it seriously needs re-mastered and released properly.  If one knows what to expect...it is a documentary and
probably the worst Beatles movie they made just to fulfill contractual obligations.  You can see their hearts aren't in to it...that said the music is great.
As a lifelong Beatles fan I'm glad I have this DVD.  The only title I didn't have.  This is great for serious fans or students who know what to expect...

6588385,4,B00MLSJTCE,"Ok, let me start out with this. I actually bought 2 of the new widescreen versions of this Documentary/Musical DVD from an online auction website.
Here's what that seller has at the bottom of his/her listing: [Legal/_Bay] This DVD is exempt from or fully complies with US Title 18 - Section 2257 & other laws regarding the release of Media. ""I am the Copyright Holder, or am an Authorized Seller."" Before I continue with my review, Yes, he/she/they are authorized Sellers. Well he/she or they have to be authorized sellers, to sell on _Bay. There is no way that Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr or Yoko Ono Lennon would allow hundreds of people to copy this, well, re-release of a 90 minute Documentary worth millions of dollars to anyone else but them & Apple Corp, or any other company that would be in charge of producing this movie. Dang, Julian Lennon spent 10 million dollars in order to get 40 million dollars of his late Fathers estate from his wife Yoko Ono Lennon. Plus they wouldn't allow their last DVD/Doc to be copied on any DVD's that have the purple dye on the recording side of the DVD. That's just basement duplicating, plain & simple. The blank media would be silver just like any movie that's sold around the world. Also, the actual beginning isn't how the original movie started. George Harrison & Ringo Starr arrive at Apple Records, smile & give a wave before entering the building, or they were inside when those shots were taken. That was cut out from what's being sold today. As for this Documentary it's still pretty good. In my family, there's me, my son & his son, my grandson who love The Beatles. That was why I purchased 2 from that seller on  _Bay. Why I want the real deal. Shelf Life. Most of the blank media you or I can buy will not last as long as real commercial grade DVD media, with the exception of only a couple brands. Back to this movie. I guess I'll have to wait for more Blu-Ray versions to come out, or make digital copies..... If you're a Beatles fan, it's a great one to have in your Beatles collection. Just remember to back it up digitally, so it'll be around for years to come........

The movie was to chronicle how the Beatles made an album but in its stead it chronicled the breakup of the biggest music group of our time. The video is a little grainy and the audio could be remixed, but it was great to see again. You have to wonder who or why the music was given to Phil Spector to OVERPRODUCE for the album, when the finished songs, Let it Be, the Long and Winding Road, Two of Us were so strong without his interference...George Martin once again did  his magic as we found out much later with ""Let it be-Naked"" cd released in this century.

It happens to be a documentary wherein the recording sessions of the Fab Four for the release of the final album was being filmed by Michael Lindsay- Hogg. The band is shown rehearsing,performing,recording and sometimes arguing as they try to complete songs. Also included is the rooftop concert of the band which happens to be their final live appearance.

Majority of the documentary shows John,Paul,George and Ringo are doing various things. Also,glimpses of Yoko Ono were caught on camera as she watches the band. Then,Billy Preston later join them.

The end is near for the most influential and successful band in rock history. The viewer can see that the band members are no longer enjoying each other's company and what they are currently doing. Added to that,it was evident that there has been a lot of infighting among them and they are ready to go to different directions anytime soon. The presence of Yoko serves more of a distraction rather than an inspiration. But despite of the uninspired actions that the band members are currently taking and being on the brink of breaking up,they still managed to make great music. The musical talent of the group just shined throughout the documentary.

40 plus years have passed since then, and I'm still enjoying the Beatles! ... I've purchased the issues and reissues of Hard Day's Night, Help, Yellow Submarine, Magical Mystery Tour .. even Beatle cartoons are available!

and yet, this movie has still not been issued officially on DVD/Blu-Ray in the UK or USA! ... that just made me want it more!

I finally broke down and purchased the film from an overseas seller ... and first let me say, the service was very good!

As far as the movie goes, I rate it only a little higher than the first time I saw it .. mostly because it's the Beatles!

It's just a small camera crew filming their recording routine ... and glimpses into their music making process .. at times the film threatens to be boring! .. the rooftop concert brings it back a little bit .. and just seeing the Fab Four in probably their only Candid appearance in film, makes it worth the time!

6588448,5,B00MLSJTCE,"Let it Be is a difficult film to watch. The Beatles were once on top of the world. Young, cocky, truly appearing to be enjoying their success, by 1969, they were mentally and spiritually burned out.

John was nursing a serious heroin habit. He only found satisfaction in the drug and in his new-found love interest, Yoko Ono. He seemed uninterested in making music, and as you watch him in this picture, when he is lucid, he is secretly waiting for the right moment to break away from the group.

George was disgruntled. Frustrated at not being allowed to display his talents in the group, he was harboring deep resentments at the main songwriters, Lennon and McCartney, for holding him back. That sullen look you see in George's face is genuine. The ""highlight"" of the film is the argument he had with Paul. The result of that argument was George leaving the group for a few days until the other band members begged him to return. By the time the film was being made George had a cache of songs, and as you watch this film, he was secretly thinking what he can do with these songs. Of course, these songs became his three-LP album, All Things Must Pass, which was released after the Beatles broke up.

Ringo is just Ringo, but he also left the band for a few days during the filming of this movie. The  distant look in his face is his attempt to distance himself from all the drama in the group.

And then we have Paul. He is the only member of the band happy to be a Beatle. In this film he is constantly trying to lift the spirits of his band mates, mostly without success. On the surface, he appears to be a total control freak. This might very well be the case. But the spirits of the other members were so down, it is difficult to tell what were the real dynamics.

The Grey Eminence, the Darth Vader of the group was Yoko Ono. She was not liked by most Beatle fans and despised by the other band members. This reviewer's memory when seeing this film for the first time in the theater was that someone emitted an audible hiss when the camera first panned on her face.

For the longest time this movie was not available on DVD. For good reason. The four people we see on the screen are not the happy-go-lucky youths running down a street, chased by fans, nor the young lads peddling their bikes on a Carribean island. It is a depressing film, a documentary about the break-up of a band.

See it for the Rooftop Concert. All the in-fighting, grumbling, and drama were forgotten, and for one brief moment it must have felt like old times. And so it will for you, watching the Beatles perform for the last time. Perhaps they were so happy because they knew, secretly, it would be their last concert, and they wanted the last one to be a good one, and create the magic they were known for, in a concert they will and should be remembered.",1422144000,5,2839,4.373814041745731

The Beatles - Let It Be (Deluxe 35mm Widescreen Stereo Edition)
'For the Beatles completist and serious fans, the biggest frustration has
been in not finding the ""Beatles - Let It Be"" in a complete, uncropped,
great quality version. The reason for this is quite interesting. The original
film was shot in 16mm (standard TV 4x3 format).  However, when the film was
released, they cropped the 16mm print by chopping off parts of the top and
bottom and blew it up to 35mm widescreen. I myself wondered in the 70's why
the picture quality was so mediocre right in the movie theatre!
Now we all know why.  So even in the theatre, one did NOT get to see the full
picture that was filmed.'

here is a compare image:
http://s2.postimg.org/4xxzpw6h5/A_lib_compare.jpg

'Then to add insult to injury, when Let It Be was released in the 1980's on
Beta and VHS videotape and on Laserdisc (all in standard TV 4x3 format),
the manufacturers did NOT go back to the original 16mm film that was shot
in the same format. INSTEAD, they sourced it from the 35mm widescreen theatre
 print and CHOPPED it AGAIN!, this time from the sides. So anyone purchasing
previous Beta, VHS and Laserdisc versions of Let It Be, now got to see even
LESS!, since it has now been chopped on all 4 sides.'

That being set, the disappointment here is that this dvd quality IS like an old worn out VHS. No remastering, not even the original theatrical format of 16:1 which I imagine was the standard release format. The sound track suffers greatly here, not sure if due to the original recording being of poor quality but it's nowhere near the sound quality of any of the other Beatles films re released lately. They just need to revamp this one, looks like is just a transfer to DVD from someone's VHS copy.",1394928000,,606,4.371681415929204
6588475,5,B00MLSJTCE,"The film shows the Beatles in the studio working out songs, arguing, showing each other the chords for songs, joking around and dealing with Yoko's presence.  It ranges from the mundane daily working life of these legendary musicians to moments of sheer genius, like the Rooftop Concert.  The film has been criticised for exposing the tension and occasional boredom of the period when the group was on the verge of breaking up.  I feel the opposite -- while we see the ordinary side of their lives, it makes us realize that they were not superhumans living in a mythical land, they were a band made up of four young guys who were so brilliant and talented that they had a global effect on the music and culture of the 20th century.

6588478,4,B00MLSJTCE,"The Beatles' farewell to all, LET IT BE is very much two films. The first painful 50 minutes are rehearsals, demos, noodling, carefully planned bursts of ad libitum piano banging and amateurish run throughs of 50s r&r. Paul lectures, reminisces and suggests while the others sit in clouds of detached tolerance. In almost every glimpse of her, Yoko looks either very stoned or very depressed (perhaps a combination of both).

The real Beatles emerge in the last half hour. Following a set of music video-quality performances is an impromptu outdoor concert, given on a cold, gray day.

SYNOPSIS--
(r) = rehearsal
Studio set up. ""Don't Let Me Down"" (r). Paul gives chords and band runs through ""Maxwell's Silver Hammer."" ""Two Of Us"" (r). ""I've Got a Feeling"" (r). ""One After 909"" fragment. Paul and Ringo do a 4-hand piano boogie. ""Two Of Us."" Paul and George feud civilly. Initial try of ""Across the Universe"" is very bad. ""I Dig a Pony"" (r). A bored Yoko reads newspaper. George on guitar demos ""I, Me, Mine,"" then John and Yoko waltz to an advanced version. End of segment.

""For You Blue"" is heard as group arrives in separate limos. Segue to them playing this song. John enjoys his slide guitar while Yoko sits defensively, stiff as a statue. Paul talks about film shot with Maharishi. They cut-up on ""Besame Mucho."" George and Ringo use piano to define ""Octopus's Garden."" John and Yoko hide in a corner. Paul has young Heather with him. Billy Preston sits in on electric piano for ""You've Really Got a Hold On Me."" Silly ""Long and Winding Road"" cha-cha, then a false start. Uninspired 50s r&r medley includes Billy. ""Dig It"" improv has material not heard on the LP.

From this point on, the boys absolutely shine.
Polished ""Two Of Us."" Into a magnificent ""Let It Be"" and ""Long and Winding Road."" To the rooftop for ""Get Back."" Curious business district onlookers gather below. Next is ""Don't Let Me Down."" Grumblings from older folks. Close-up of glassy-eyed Yoko. ""I've Got a Feeling,"" ""One After 909"" and ""I Dig a Pony"" as the police enter building. Reprise of ""Get Back"" given more for them than anyone becomes the last public performance of the legendary Beatles.

6588480,5,B00MLSJTCE,"I love it... the rooftop concert is of course the highlight. I Me Mine is awesome, and VERY different than the version on VHS. Let It Be, The Long and Winding Road, Dig It, Besame Mucho, Don't Let Me Down are all excellent! It's cool to see Billy Preston playing with them, which leads me to wish they had considered having other 'guests' come in and jam with them for the film (such as Clapton or Dylan). The fighting is unfortunate... There are also some great happy moments. But in terms of style, appearance and music, this version of the Beatles is MUCH cooler than the Help or Hard Day's Night era of the band, and some of the performances here as I mentioned are AMAZING. The DVD is offering a lot of bonus footage... I just don't have enough words to go on about how great this film is. It's an unbelievable behind-the-scenes look at what is essentially the break up of the greatest band in history. And the rooftop performance that lends several tracks to the album release has always been considered one of the most historic moments in rock 'n roll. Well here is is on film! Need I say more?",1391558400,,1101,4.401960784313726

Thirty years ago I once met the Laser Disc of this film at a shop, but could not make up my mind to purchase it because it was so expensive.  A few weeks later I visited the shop again to buy it, but I found it had gone!  I had not seen it for so many years.  However, I found this dvd at this store by accident.  I was so glad to get another chance and ordered it right away this time.
The movie was so nice.  Though the image was no so good  or clear as shown in the dvd album ""Anthology,"" it is good enough to enjoy.  I was so impressed to see the last moment of the greatest rock group.  Since I am not so good at spoken English, it is a little bit difficult for me to catch the conversation in a low voice.  To my relief, the most part of this movie is wonderful Beatles' music!  I recommend you try this dvd to witness the very important scene of the rock history.",1258243200,,926,3.8983957219251337

The sound bites and small-talk banter between the individual Beatles is interesting at first but begins to grate very quickly. The best part of this production is the ""concert on the roof"" at the very end and here is where I have the problem. It is TOO BRIEF and ends very abruptly with no fanfare or closing commentary. Nonetheless, as a Beatles Fan, I HAD to own this DVD.",1257984000,,517,4.51063829787234
6588493,4,B00MLSJTCE,"Whether you are specifically a fan of the Beatles or just have an interest in the evolution of music, LET IT BE provides an important and historical record of a period in time toward the end of the greatest musical influence ever.
This film is both charming and sad but always valid and relevant.",1256428800,,296,4.5
6588494,4,B00MLSJTCE,"If you're a Beatles fan but you don't own this film in some other format, I would nevertheless recommend that you go ahead and buy this version. I've read some of the negative reviews and I'd like to offer a couple of comments.  I saw this film when it came out in the movie theaters back in the early 1970s.  I recall thinking at the time that the images were fairly grainy.  Not at all clear like a Hollywood movie. I also recall noticing that whoever did the editing didn't, at times, bother to synchronize the sound with the picture (e.g. note John's slide guitar playing on ""For You Blue"").  Finally, the original sound quality was pretty average, especially when compared with the kind of live concert sound we enjoy on today's video DVDs.  This is all to say that from a ""quality"" standpoint, it's not appropriate to compare today's 21st century digital video pictures and sound to a 1969 documentary that was shot on film, not video.  I received my DVD promptly from the seller and immediately put it in for viewing.  And what I saw and heard were the same grainy pictures I saw years ago and the same sound we heard back then.  The DVD picture itself is a bit darker than the original and I attribute this to the transfer process, but it's still what I remembered it to be.  I have no complaints about this purchase.  Having seen the original, I feel I got exactly what I paid for and to own a copy of this important piece of Beatles history was well worth the price.  Perhaps what I enjoyed most was showing younger family members in their twenties the Beatles' Ed Sullivan appearance followed by their appearance in Let It Be.  It was fascinating to observe the change from the polished, clean cut lads in 1964 to the long-haired, casual band in 1969.  In that regard I would highly recommend that you consider purchasing ""The Beatles - Their First USA Visit"" as a companion to ""Let It Be.""",1255996800,2,1901,4.491279069767442
6588495,2,B00MLSJTCE,"A friend of mine recommended this to me so that I can get a clear picture of what being in a hard-working and productive band is all about.  I was told that they were constantly fighting among each other, complaining about Yoko's presence, and I also expected to learn something about how improvisation works when band members try to communicate with each other in songwriting.  Unfortunately, throughout the entire film, you can barely hear what they're talking about when they speak quickly and quietly in their British accents.  It didn't seem as if there was much fighting going on, supposedly because they deleted those scenes out of the final version made for video.  I could make out what they were saying to some extent, but it seemed to be no more than comments on what they thought about the songs they were rehearsing, what experiences they had at some of the venues they played at in various countries, etc.  If this really is an actual movie, then it doesn't succeed at drawing my attention and keeping me interested in the plot of events, which is what I believe a good movie should be about.  The songs are fantastic, and I completely love and respect the Beatles for what they've accomplished and the impact they've had on modern rock, but a documentary should provide more to viewers than just footage of the band in the studio.  The rooftop concert was a sensation and it was nice to see how the police went easy with them.  Other than that, it was boring and there wasn't much to learn from this.",1255910400,,1515,4.626865671641791

6588498,5,B00MLSJTCE,"Though I applaud the sellers entrepreneurship, the asking price is just too much at this time for me. Shoulda' gotten this DVD before the new interest in The Beatles peaked and set prices soaring. It's just so frustrating that Apple is sitting on this much sought treasure. Waiting for what, only a 'Higher Power' knows. Even though 'Let It Be' is very dark, unpolished, and lets face it, it certainly does chronicle the very painful break up of the most extraordinary (rock) band of the last 100yrs. There are some beautiful moments & jams when Paul's not berating everyone, and chastising George's guitar playing. The song 'For You Blue', is a great example of that. The Beatles really cook, and as George says, ""Elmore James ain't got nothing on this baby."" John & Paul show us they still could work together (musically, anyways), and have fun on 'Two Of Us'. Of course, the now legendary ""Roof Top' performance is worth the price of admission alone. What a way for a band to go out!

The fact is...Money could be accumilating in huge amounts if this disc ever saw the ""proper light of  day!""... Another important point is that John Lennon is dead!,so is George and Billy Preston!, Producer Phil Spector is in an L.A. prison for murder(and at his age  and facing 15-20 before parole,with the state of the L.A. prison system..gang infested, overcrowded,daily stress etc..It well be left up to fate if he survives!) who else has to die before this film sees the ""proper"" light of day?? ..true fans ,lobby the record label..bombard McCartney's website/e-mail info (He could always use the cash to recoup from that last divorce payout!)",1251936000,5,1242,5.108374384236453

An excellent view on how to put a masterpiece together. Very interesting to see these geniuses of music at the Apple Studios at work talking, playing, jamming and having fun.

I've seen the movie before many years ago, and being a huge fan, and Let It Be being my fave album, loved the movie as well. Received the DVD quite fast, to my surprise. I Opened it immediately and put it on, was curious how the pic quality would be since I'd read some reviews about it being fairly poor. It was ""ok"" (acceptable)and not recalling how the pic was way back when I last saw it, just figured it was the way it was filmed ""back then"", I dunno. This DVD is advertised as Let it Be PLUS extra bonus materials. NO EXTRA BONUS MATERIALS, which I was also curious about! I'd seen the movie before and I'd at least know if the 80 minute movie had anything EXTRA. This is mostly why I made the decision to pay nearly $50 for it, assuming there'd be more than just the movie. So, am I glad I bought it? Yes, seeing as how it is simply not legitimately obtainable at any stores as of yet, and seemingly may NEVER be. I just wish there were BONUS material(s) on it, as advertised. Am I glad I paid $50 for it? No. You need to be a HUGE Beatles fan to justify paying that much for an 80 minute (albeit very intriguing 80 minutes,) movie that has nothing extra.

I somehow missed it at previous opportunities.  All the other books and documentaries always describe this as a documentary of their break up.  I was very surprised to see nowhere near what I was expecting in the way of animosity ... only two scenes come to mind.  The one I've seen a million times of George telling Paul he'll play it any way he wants it or not at all, and another of John seeming very bored and disinterested as Paul lectures.  Otherwise the roof top concert and the final studio versions of a couple of songs were great.  The rehearsal sessions were very rough, but that's to be expected for works in progress.  One particular scene tickled me ... Ringo arriving in the morning to find Paul at the piano greeting him, ""Good morning, Rich!""  Rich!?

As for the DVD itself the video quality is not very good ... audio okay.  Good attempt to look like an official release, but it can't be.",1243468800,5,1056,4.458333333333333

On the other hand, if you want to see Let It Be this is probably the easiest and quickest way to do so.

The film itself is not very good.  I love the Beatles but this was bad. Even the highlight of the rooftop concert is poorly edited.

If you are looking for one of the best movies, try watching A Hard Day's Night instead. This is an easy 4 stars. The DVD is ""very unofficial"". It is not Apple. It is however complete, but very badly mastered. It is probably taken from a VHS, but whoever mastered it to DVD must be color-blind! The tint is totally off! I needed to completely adjust my red tint to the max so it looks natural. The audio is a common Dolby Stereo, common of a VHS. It is sadly only in full screen, unlike SOME theatrical prints. If you can find it, try Let It Be Revisited or Let It Be Reformated, both are widescreen and have better quality. My total advice is to not get this edition, but try for Revised, Revisited, or Reformatted. The odds of an even semi-official release are .001-1,000,000,000,000 against.",1240617600,2,918,4.470238095238095

The second part of the video shows what is the Beatles' last live concert. Not only does it shows footage of the concert itself, filmed from Apple's rooftop and from neighboring rooftops, it also shows footage of London's reaction to the concert on the streets below and on the surrounding buildings. This is truly awesome Beatles in action.

Be warned that the first part of the video is a bit sad. (Take that any way you want.) But, for an old Beatle fan or for a music history student, this is a must-have video.

Arguments in the studio (mostly with Paul's want for perfection) from Ringo and George ( ""I'll play it anyway you want me to or not play it."").  Some interesting arrangements like the old classic ""Kansas City"" but the live stuff is what really makes this thing hum.  Why no region 1 DVD is available is beyond.

6588534,4,B00MLSJTCE,"This is presumably a legitimate release if it's here, since you obviously can't sell pirates here.  This hasn't even been on VHS officially since after John Lennon died (yes, it's been that long!), though I knew about the laserdisc for twenty years.  Since the Beatles inadvertently rule the black market, hundreds of unauthorised copies have been seen at record fairs and the like over the years along with those tinny-sounding LPs!  I once had a third-generation copy, which I was told was copied from a tape from a nursing home (home taping kills movies, too!), which was very grainy, yet had to do (though I found the 1981 tape).  This came close to a proper release when longtime cohort and then Apple CEO Neil Aspinall (who has recently passed on) said it brought back too many bad memories (as a member of the Beatles' circle, he's seen nearly it all behind closed doors.  He should've written a tell-all!).  Since the former head of Legacy at Sony Jeff Jones replaced him, maybe we'll get a true DVD release someday soon in time for the 40th Anniversary.  There can be interviews, lost footage, and more, like most DVDs.
As for the notorious film itself, needs little introduction.  A climax into the Beatles story as a group, as the legend goes.  The white album was the first sign that the magic was gone.  After psychedelia and indulgence, it was time to go back to basics.  The Fab Four booked the legendary Twickenham Film Studios in Middlesex in the London area (where ""A Hard Day's Night"" ""Help!"", some solo videos and more were filmed).  It was cold and uninspiring.  John was with Yoko as usual.  Paul ran the show.  George and Ringo were on the sidelines.  Hours of tape and film were made.  Then everyone's at Savile Row.  The late Billy Preston and young Heather (Linda's daughter) helped break the ice.  Then the last show on the rooftops, with mixed reaction on the street.  Some older folks were amazed, as were nearly all the younger locals, though the others and the police were not amused.  And the rest is history.
Sometimes, these gray market releases are from countries where the laws are more lax than they are here (there are a tonne of bootlegs of the sessions).  Who knows?  If it does come out officially worldwide, it will likely be released by Apple/Capitol/Abbey Road Interactive like the recent reissue of 'Help!'.",1198454400,3,2352,4.724815724815725

It is horrible that Amazon is hosting this illegal product. Don't waste your money.",1194825600,,495,4.53932584269663
6588536,4,B00MLSJTCE,"Yes, this is obviously a bootleg from a VHS tape.
It is legal (because the title has become public domain).
I actually was fortunate enough to pick up a used laserdisc player and lot of laserdiscs at a garage sale awhile back.
Let It Be was included in that lot - and was my main reason for picking it up.
The sound on that is mono because that's how the show/movie was recorded.
The picture on the laserdisc is much better than this DVD.
However, if you really really want this movie - buy it in some form now because I don't see the production company putting a ton of cash into a restoration job on this one.
While it may be spellbinding to us - this is not a film that Paul, Ringo, Yoko or anyone else associated with the Beatles is very proud of.
It shows them in a state of collapse.
This is not how they want to be remembered.
So I know the subjects aren't interested in this seeing the light of day in a super deluxe collectors package.
Also worth considering is the fact that this was shot for TV on inferior equipment (as compared to major motion picture stock) and initially poorly stored - so this present DVD may be about as good as it gets.

No doubt a proper official release will be forthcoming in due course, when they have edited out all the arguments! Suffice to say the fact that the last official film of The Beatles still isn't available 38 years after it was filmed is disgraceful. A large part of the film did need editing, but I have no doubt that there is more footage available that could replace some of the arguments. Regardless of that, the rooftop concert, which comprises the last 15 - 20 minutes of the film justifies the immediate release of this film anyway.

What I would like too see are some of the things mentioned on Nat Pub Radio's here and now like a video of the birth of Get Back(I am hoping for several takes) also several versions of Don't Let Me Down. For those of you who are unaware, on Nat Pub Radio, there was a 1 hour show on the lost beatle tapes and they presented several songs which were in early stages of recording and I found that show very interesting and being a musician I know that most songs are recorded anywhere from 35 to 100 times before they sound like the finished product. So if anything that is offered has less than that then I don't want it. We all hope that Apple puts out a respectible DVD with much of the same on it.

As a T.V. Special it played in 1970. Originally it was entitled as 'Get Back' showing the Beatles rehearsing, jamming and performing for their new songs. This is the only documentary film released officially and was then changed to be called 'Let It Be'. It marks the ending of the career of the Beatles. First played on TV for a one-hour message about the career of the Beatles told by the Beatles themselves. This video has won the Grammy Awards for ""Best Music Video, long form"". The Beatles had, as Paul said at the end of the video, ""united for somehow, some way"".

6588554,3,B00MLSJTCE,"Yes. This is a bootleg of the long out of print Let It Be movie. The price is unethically high considering there are no menues, special features, and it does not play on my computer DVD drive. It is, however, a decent transfer, probably from VHS. For more reviews of ATI products check out their 3-Stooges collections (on Amazon). Many of their customers feel cheated.",1173139200,47,368,4.676923076923077
6588555,2,B00MLSJTCE,"This collection of two cds and one DVD is a good example of how they must be the remastered CDS of beatles. Nevertheless the quality of the DVD is very poor. It was not remaster, the sound is very bad and the image distorted to half of the DVD. They do not buy it if they have Let It Be or Naked CDs. Another point in con is that the edition does not count on the original art in photos, book form of the original edition. A quite ordinary edition briefly.",1152748800,41,456,4.021978021978022

8672930,3,B00MLSJTCE,"I would have given this 5 stars, but I was disappointed that it was somewhat incomplete.  I really don't know what exists in the way of this movie these days but I remember vividly seeing it in a movie theater when it came out, and I have seen a few variations online.  This version is different in that you don't hear Mal Evans and the other Beatles management in entranceway on the main floor of the studios when they let the police in, talking to police and the police telling them they (The Beatles) had to knock it off after one more song or face arrest.  I mean, the thing about playing on the rooftop and the repercussions of doing so was that it was an act of rebellion.  I also remember at one point a cop turns down George or John's amplifier and speaks to management on the roof.  I mean the concert and studio footage was cool and an important look into how The Beatles worked, got along, fought, and how the band broke up.  But many cool bits are gone.  After the amp is turned down and a few words exchanged, likely including the band being told they could only do 1 more number.  In the version I saw, either John or George comments ""good the cops (or ""pigs"") are gone, we can sing on the roofs again"".  And George turns the amp back up.  I feel a bit like Winston Smith in the Orwellian novel ""1984"".  Where is this stuff and why don't they want people to see these scenes these days? This version has none of that stuff.  Music plays over a lot of the street commentary and the interactions with management.  I understand the movie has been seriously edited down over the years and it shows.  I wish they'd put out a full version of this movie with bonus stuff.  I understand that a lot of songs were recorded and never used.  Would be nice if they put this out on Blu-ray with the full uncut original footage, plus bonus footage - maybe the entire rooftop concert as it happened with all the missing songs.",1519084800,3,1924,4.28808864265928

8672935,3,B00MLSJTCE,"I saw ""Let It Be"" during its theater release in 1970 and even as an innocent teenager was struck by its starkness, the conflicts among the band, the insight into how records are made, etc.  I've always wanted to see the film again and was eager to watch this DVD.  This is a well-packaged bootleg-- after the fact I've learned that the film has never had an official DVD release- and there are lots of scratches, wonky colors and the instruments sound murky while the dialogue is difficult to understand.  But it is the Beatles and sort of worth having.  Paul and Ringo should do the fans a favor and authorize a deluxe restoration of the film for release in its original 16mm cut.",1511913600,,681,4.467741935483871
