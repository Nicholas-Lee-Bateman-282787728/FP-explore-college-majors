8322723,3,B001N0LEO2,"This came with different art work and seems to be a dvd-r. The quality is not good but it is watchable. I have long wanted to see William Powell as Philo Vance in other productions beside the Kennel Murder Case. So this was a find. The plus in this 1930 movie is William Powell, William Boyd (Hopalong Cassidy of early TV fame) as Harry Gray and Eugene Palette as police detective Heath. Another plus is seeing a 1930's take on the repercussions of the Great Depression of 1929 when stockbrokers sold investors stocks out from under them at a loss. The desperation of the characters here gives you a feel for what that era, so much like our own present dilemmas, was like.",1383955200,,672,4.471544715447155

I liked the Kennel Murder Case a lot more.",1349568000,3,106,3.8636363636363638

8322726,5,B001N0LEO2,"This is a new idea - creating a book to read on a TV.  In addition to the book, this DVD contains an old radio mystery, music in the background on two of the menus and some advertisements for other novels.  The book, itself, is black ink on white pages - pretty much what I expected.  You must page it manually.  I do so using the remote from my DVD player.  Each page of the book fits onto the TV screen.  So it's easy to keep the storyline clear in my head.  I can page the book forward and back on my DVD player so I read it at my own speed.  If my wife and I are reading the book at the same time, we don't always read at the same speed.  But sharing the book is fun because it opens up points for conversation about the story.  Because the print size is proportional to the size of the television screen even people like me with bad eyesight, can enjoy reading.  I thought I was going to have to give that pleasure up.  Because NO printed book can give me a full page of text with letters the size that I see on my TV screen.",1240876800,,1030,3.922705314009662
8322727,1,B001N0LEO2,"This is a DVD book that has extras.  Unfortunately the extras have nothing to do with the book.  The DVD book is very very plain, nothing special about this whole series of DVDs.  You can get the book in this form for nothing on the internet, because it is public domain.  Probably the most disappointing purchase I have ever made from Amazon.  It gets one star only because I can't give it none.  Don't buy it.",1237420800,2,411,4.342105263157895
