2612106,4,B000GH3CC0,"I keep up a fairly strenuous workout routine incorporating yoga, weights and cardio, so while I rotate my workout routines to avoid plateaus, I am also always on the lookout for fresh, solid, and excellent workouts.  I was not impressed with Kathy's ""Lift Weights Volume Two,"" but I thought I'd give this ""Matrix Method"" a whirl since the review sounded good.  It is!  Kathy must be getting up there in age, but not only does she look FAB in this workout (either the lighting is good or exercise IS the key to staying young!), she provides the participant with an excellent sculpt routine.  I have seen many of these particular ""core"" moves in other workouts, but for this workout, I would suggest that beginner levels first attempt this workout without using the weights, only because the moves and pace are fast and one could easily get hurt.  Intermediate levels may want to begin with lighter weights (3-5 lbs) and work up to heavier if appropriate.  Advanced may be able to breeze through this workout as is and use heavier weights.  Regardless, a great workout will be achieved.  I used ankle weights and alternated dumbbell weights (8-12 lbs), and I was able to execute the moves and I will tell you--I felt every bit of it!

Apparently, Kathy Smith ""discovered"" one of the participants, ""Angela,"" and her ""Matrix Workout"" at a popular gym, and Kathy provides an additional interview with Angela explaining the basis of this routine, as well as an approximate ten-minute advanced routine led by Angela.  As for this workout, the entire tone of the workout is upbeat, the filming, state-of-the-art, yet not distracting, the participants seem fresh and as if they are having a great time--different participants work at different levels, which provides the at-home participant with options.  Some of the participants are at top level, some mid-level, and some, like Nancy Walker, a veteran of Kathy's workouts, is at the beginner-option level, so everyone who wants to attempt this workout can because there are options.  The workout is tough, but good; fun, yet effective.  I enjoy circuit-type workouts, and while this is not a straight cardio workout, if one is beginning or using the weights and executing maximum effort, you will feel the heart pumping and receive some heartrate response!  I mentioned that I was not impressed with Kathy's ""Lift Weights Vol. 2"" workout...it seems slapped together and sloppy, and Kathy is not at her best.  This workout is fresh with plenty of moves to keep one's body in tip-top shape, and Kathy herself looks great and is in top form for the workout as well.  I would definitely recommend this workout as part of one's routine.  I can feel and see the benefits already after only one week, and it's great to see that Kathy's back with an excellent workout routine.  Aside from a few glitches in the filming (I caught a cord dangling in front of the camera, as well as someone's hand briefly waving across the lens...and yes, there are a few moves which Kathy does not repeat on the other side), this workout will do the job providing shape and tone to one's body!  I may edit this review after working out with the DVD for a few more weeks, which is usually when I notice some ""intricacies"" I may have ommitted; however, at this point, I love this workout!

***To update:  I have been working out to ""The Matrix"" every week since purchase (it's basically my Saturday workout), and the benefits are really amazing!  Also, the workout does NOT become stale.",1173225600,25,3502,4.811352253756261
2612107,5,B000GH3CC0,"I'm a certified personal trainer...I've used this video as a model for ""circuit"" training...some moves in the video could compromise ""form"", but with proper adjustments, I consider it very acceptable and challenging. Kathy gives good instruction of proper form for leg exercises, especially squats and lunges.  To compensate for some over-training on arm moves, I'm suggesting that my clients use lower weights.  I really like the challenge of the ""balance"" segments.  Abs are very challenging and stretch series is excellent! I'd rate this a moderate to advanced video, depending on the intensity chosen and weights used.",1173052800,8,622,5.458333333333333
2612108,3,B000GH3CC0,"I am a Kathy Smith fan; she did get me started working out and although I moved beyond her to The Firm and Jari Love, I have always liked Kathy as she seemed to focus on form.  However, this DVD does not.  It doesn't seem to know whether it is a cardio workout or a sculpting workout. If you use heavier weights, you run the risk of injury; if you use lighter weights, it is not long enough to get your cardio pumping.  Further, Kathy does have a problem with not doing the same number of reps for each side; that will be seen in this DVD.  I did like the unusualy movements; the body does move differently than in others; however, again, the speed in which Kathy seems to want to do this workout is not beneficial to those who may have a weak back.",1171929600,22,749,4.109589041095891
2612109,5,B000GH3CC0,Once again Kathy Smith hits the mark with her fitness training abilities.  This is great!  I really feel like I am getting a workout.,1171238400,3,133,4.5
2612110,5,B000GH3CC0,"I loaded this workout onto my IPOD.  I love it and it is great to use when I travel.  It doesn't take much room, or special equipment, other than small free weights.  I use this in addition to Pilates, Yoga, and Tae bo, and it is truly a fat burning workout.  Fun, too!",1171065600,4,269,4.018867924528302
2612111,5,B000GH3CC0,"I've been using this workout for a few weeks now and have really enjoyed it.  Although just a few minutes over 30 minutes for the Ultimate Sculpt portion of the DVD, you're dripping with sweat when it's over and feel sore the next day in a good way.

I've been exercising consistently 5-7 times a week for 3 years, primarily using The Firm for sculpting and Richard Simmons and The Firm for cardio.  So I was surprised at the level of soreness I felt from the workouts - but even more so from WHERE I was sore.  Like one of the other reviewers, I felt soreness in my rib cage area, but also from another hard to target area in the butt/glute/upper-side leg area.

The exercises themselves are different from the norm, which may explain why frequent exercisers are experiencing a surprising level of soreness afterward.  This has made this DVD become a regular in my rotation.  I was born without a waist :) and I am hopeful that maybe this routine will give me firmness at the side of my waist, even if my build isn't likely to develop a real defined waist. The time moves by quickly through the routine.  It's a nice balance of being neither tricky or boring.  There is variety in the movements, but no real ""choreography"" that you have to learn - just watch and follow.

One caution:  I would suggest starting out using a lighter weight for many of the moves than you would typically use in a sculpting routine.  Why?  Well, many of the moves involve a certain amount of lunging or twisting or bending.  The first time I did this routine was almost my last, as after just 10 minutes, my admittedly sensitive back was complaining and I had to stop.  I would have written this one off, but I'll confess the rib-cage soreness the next day - and after just 10 minutes of this tape - made me want to try it again because it's such an unusual place to feel muscle soreness.  So I backed it down from 7.5 to a 2.5 pound weight (Bowflex Adjustable, which increases in 2.5 increments, hence the weird amounts)and am very careful with form and have had no problems and have increased to 5 pounds, where I think I'll stay, as that's giving me a good workout.

I'd recommend watching through this DVD before working out to it - or doing it without weights the first time.  This may help give you a better idea of what size weight to use.  Though this DVD is named ""ultimate sculpting"", Kathy suggests doing it some days without weights. I also consider it a cardio workout because she has your heart rate elevated and I'm always soaked when done.

I have several of Kathy Smith's workouts and this is probably my most favorite of them.  I will probably use other workouts for a true upper body sculpting routine, but I think this is an excellent addition, particularly for those parts of the body often missed (at least judging from my soreness) by them.  This is available on Netflix if you want to trial this before buying - but with a price under [...], you can't go wrong.",1170460800,97,2966,4.44362292051756
2612112,5,B000GH3CC0,"I did this workout last night and my thighs, butt, and sides near my ribcage are SORE!  I felt I got a really good sculpting session as well as cardio because my heart rate was up so high and I was dripping sweat.  I have been exercising with the Firm for years...so I was afraid this would be too easy, but it is definitley for intermediate/advanced exercisers if you use handweights (there is a lady in the video that does the exercises without weights).  Great DVD!",1168214400,15,468,4.4186046511627906
2612113,5,B000GH3CC0,"I just received this DVD and did all of it except the bonus workout this morning.  This is an excellent timesaver workout.  The 30 min. sculpting workout keeps your heartrate up for the entire 30 minutes and works all of your muscles.  I used 5 lb. weights for the entire 30 minutes, although a few times I wished they were lighter.  This workout could be done on it's own for a quick overall workout.  I also did the core workout (10 min.) and the relaxation and stretch(10 min.)  The stretching is really relaxing. This is an intermediate/advanced workout, however, you could modify for a beginner.  I can't wait to do it again.",1165276800,65,630,4.571428571428571
2612134,4,B000GH3CC0,This is a good workout because you can make it as strenuous as you like.  It is a good 30 minute workout.,1358640000,,105,3.772727272727273
2612135,5,B000GH3CC0,"I bought this DVD since I have always enjoyed Kathy Smith workout tapes since I find her peppy, easy to follow, and relatable but I have her old tapes and now it isn't as easy to play them. I was very pleased with with this workout, it was tough but still doable my first time around. She is great at offering various moves for beginners to advanced so there is plenty of room to improve with the workout (aside from just increasing amount of weight). I really liked how the routine incorporates both arm and leg workouts at the same time because I think by increasing the dynamics behind the move, you are getting a better workout and it is also more efficient.  The routine is also conveniently divided into the different sections (30 minute routine, core workout, stretches, and bonus advanced routine). Another great part about the routine is she uses exercises (especially for the core) that go beyond the typical crunch and ordinary ab routines and therefore help target the muscles since they now get to be used in different positions which will only help increase their strength.
In short, I found this to be an efficient yet encompassing and rigorous workout that is suitable for many different levels (would probably be too difficult if you are completely new to working out).",1357776000,3,1286,4.741071428571429
2612136,1,B000GH3CC0,"This DVD was very disappointing in that it is the same as Kathy Smith's DVD Build Muscle-Shrink Fat.

2612137,5,B000GH3CC0,"I like the matrix idea and the mixing and matching of upper and lower body work. This is not a good workout to do first thing in the morning if you are not warmed up, there is a lot of twisting movement in it.",1322438400,3,209,3.772727272727273
2612138,5,B000GH3CC0,"This is very good workout. It is not too hard, I would say moderate. It is mix of cardio with weights. I like how it targets all mussels. First it gets leg workout, then moves to core and then arms. I like that Kathy does not push one specific mussels until it hurts or burn badly, it targets hard enough, then moves to another set of mussels while first one can rest and relax. It is not hard workout, but I was sweating and was not tired after all. The only thing, which is kind of annoying, that Kathy does not do exercises herself but keeps running from one person to another, but I was enjoying and focusing on workout that after awhile, I stop noticing Kathy and her ""slacking"".",1317081600,,684,4.269230769230769
2612139,4,B000GH3CC0,"I really like this DVD - it's such a change of pace from most other exercise DVDs that I use.  I especially like the way it tones all my muscle groups evenly.  The Matrix Method is fun and functional, and Kathy is always a pleasure to watch, with her smiling face and her upbeat attitude.  She takes the ""work"" out of workouts!",1285891200,2,327,4.241935483870968
2612140,5,B000GH3CC0,"I work out about 4 days a week.  The last few months consisted of EA Active.  Last week I switched to this DVD and what a challenge!  My face is blotchy red by the time I am finished, and I haven't even tried the ""advanced workout"" yet.  Mixes cardio with weight training, entire body.  Explanation and workout is simple enough to keep up with and understand from the onset.  I am definately not disappointed and look forward to seeing the results in about a month or so.",1269820800,2,471,4.35632183908046
2612141,5,B000GH3CC0,"I bought this DVD at FYE used for 2.99.  The price is what made me go for it and the fact it has the different sections for changing the workout around.  I love it!  I did it with 3 pound weights; for only half of the workout.  I definitely feel the burn already in my arms...Can't wait too see what else is sore tomorrow.  It was even slow enough for me too keep up the first time.  I only did the 30 minute workout; was sweating halfway through it.  I'd recommend this to any beginner too intermediate person.  The workouts are simple; yet, effective.  My new favorite workout.",1265500800,2,579,4.287037037037037
2612142,5,B000GH3CC0,"This is a great workout, challenging and quick.  I also have Jillian Michaels DVD's and I think she would like this Kathy Smith workout.  You stay moving the entire time combining upper and lower body moves.  I have weak ankles and so I am a bit slower than the video but I still get an excellent workout.  It also includes standing abs in the 30 min. workout (very nice not having to get on the floor).  Overall one of my favorite Kathy Smith workouts.",1260576000,,453,4.345238095238095
2612143,5,B000GH3CC0,"This is my absolute fab-fave workout. It is way challenging but never frustrating, and Kathy always mentions ways to increase your challenge as you improve. The pace is quick - in terms of the speed of the lunge repetitions and also that there's about zero time in between changing to a new set of moves. So, right after an intense cardio burst she has you immediately go into, say, a squat set with weights, and you know you gotta be scorching the calories! My fitness has improved dramatically since I've been doing this 2- 3 times a week and I have been steadily dropping weight. (Also using Kathy's Feed Muscle, Shrink Fat eating plan from her book of the same title.) I find that since the matrix moves mimic everyday task movements, my body is remembering the workout throughout the rest of my day. So I find myself craving to do a set of side lunges in the middle of the day -- and will even sneak in a set or two at work, hidden in the bathroom! Some reviewers have mentioned the ambiguity of where to fit the incredibly efficient routine into clear-cut strength or cardio slots throughout your week, and I admit I struggle with that too. I end up considering it cardio AND lower body strength....",1246579200,4,1205,4.506849315068493
2612164,5,B000GH3CC0,"This DVD was such a pleasant surprise to me. It's a rare thing when I can actually say I enjoy working out, but Kathy's routine in this DVD is fun and challenging--I really work up a sweat. I primarily focus on the 30-minute workout, which addresses all areas of the body (even the abs without any floorwork!). The downside is that some of the lunge positions seem awkward at first, and if not done correctly might be hard on the knees--so pay close attention to make sure your form is correct.",1239667200,3,494,4.43956043956044
2612165,4,B000GH3CC0,"I think this workout provides a great variation for Kathy Smith fans, what with doing lunges and bicep curls at the same time, you are bound to be testing your stamina. The stomach section is also challenging and different than some other conventional workouts.

The fact is that when you are stepping and lunging at awkward angles, when you are moving your arms and legs at the same time, and when you are carrying weights simultaneously, then you are feeling too busy to feel bored. Your mind is too engaged trying to maintain all of these activities at once. That prevents the workout from becoming boring. So, I applaud her in creating a unique and challenging workout. It's good toning and the cardiovascular aspect gets worked, too.

The additional instructor in the bonus segment at the end really introduces us to an advanced way of working out, too. The types of push ups she does while lifting up a leg at the same time is pretty impressive, and Kathy Smith even has a hard time keeping up.

All in all, if you opt for using weights, then this definitely is a workout for advanced exercisers.

Great workout! Nice change =)",1232064000,4,1133,4.65
2612166,2,B000GH3CC0,"At first I loved this workout because it provided some decent aerobics with interesting moves and it did work to tone muscles.  After several months of doing it twice a week or so, though, I had to drop it from my line up.  Instead of feeling good-sore the next day from working out, I started to have pain in my shoulders and feet (!) that kept building to the point that it would wake me up at night. I reluctantly decided to give the workout a rest and see it the pain diminished.  After not doing this workout for a couple of months (but doing others instead) the pain in both areas has diminished considerably. I do not think throwing those weights around, especially over your head, is good for much of anything.  I also think there is something about all those twists and lunges that puts pressure on feet in an odd way.  If you buy this, I would recommend using lighter weights and doing it infrequently as change of pace instead of several times a week as a regular workout.",1230336000,11,983,4.3791208791208796
2612167,5,B000GH3CC0,"I was pleasantly surprised by this workout because of some of the negative reviews. I'm glad I gave it a try anyway. I'm an experienced exerciser (working out daily for the last 25 years). I prefer Cathe or Amy mostly, but like a variety. I found that Kathy is very natural and motivating in this one. She also looks nicely toned. I liked how intense the sculpt and core workouts are making the most use of the time spent. I really think what Kathy does best is core work though. It's delicious, tough and unique. Overall, there is a lot of twisting and rotating to incorporate core and obliques which an intermediate to advanced exerciser can handle, but beginners may not know how it feels to use the correct form and could hurt themselves. Love this one!",1214265600,,757,4.532846715328467
2612168,2,B000GH3CC0,"I have always liked Kathy's exercise videos but this one is so disappointing. The reason is that she does not follow the beat of the music.
Most of the fun of these types of videos is following the beat. It makes it a lot easier to get through a major workout. But on this one it's like they added some music after the video was made so the music is out of sync with the exercises. It's very distracting for me. I think the exercises are good, but nobody is following the music so it's no fun.
Come on Kathy stay with the beat!",1213747200,4,527,4.076923076923077

And I like the fact that you don't need many additional things - just the weights, and a mat to lie on for the floor exercises.

Overall, I'm very satisfied.",1204502400,3,339,4.044776119402985
2612170,2,B000GH3CC0,"I have been working out regularly at home for years and so I own a few Kathy Smith videos, but I don't like this one. I agree with the other reviewer that the movements are just in bad form. Kathy has you rapidly HURLING your heavier weights overhead and moving in bizarre unnatural ways, like doing lunges at weird angles. When doing this video, I didn't feel so much like I was working my body in new ways (as claimed), but more like I was ENDANGERING my body. I know that sounds dramatic, but it just felt unsafe and risky. It is also annoying and distracting that she keeps stopping to go and point out her cast members. Makes me wonder if she has lost some level of fitness herself that she needs to keep taking these ""breathers."" Also, she seems to be trying to act too young... at some points it's like she's flirting with one of her young male cast members. Eeeew. It's distracting. Kathy, you look good for any age.

2612217,4,B000GH3CC0,"I ordered the Kathy Smith, Matrix Method to try something new after using many of the Kathy Smith workouts over the years, and I have been using ""Lift Weights to Lose Weight"" for over 2 years and love it in addition to running.

This is so much more fun and efficient. It works all body parts at the same time, upper, core, and lower and is easy to follow and fast paced. The workout is as hard as you want to make it or easy if you need to. The 10 minute core workout is quick and works the abs completely. I really like the relaxation stretching segment, it has helped my back tremendously. All in all, I am thrilled with this workout as it is a thorough workout, timesaver, and moves very quickly. I do not like to change routines, but this one is worth it.",1178928000,11,760,4.170068027210885
2612218,4,B000GH3CC0,"I just added the Ultimate Sculpt to my collection of workout DVD's.  So far the 30 minute sculpting and 10 minute core are just what I wanted to increase the level of intensity.

The reason I could not give this five stars is due to the annoying cackling and screaming noises Kathy make throughout the video.  She bounces around way too much and struggles to follow the routine at times.  I think she thinks it's cute.  If this was not such a good workout I would have returned it.  So if you can overlook poor filming and obnoxious noises then buy it....a great workout!",1178582400,7,571,4.4423076923076925
2612219,4,B000GH3CC0,"I watched this workout prior to doing it so that I would be more familiar with what to expect. You can tell from just watching it that it'll be a good, all-over workout. Although after viewing it I was a little concerned about being able to manage doing it entirely, I was relieved that I could afterall. I really sweat a lot each time, so I sip on water throughout. I like that the DVD breaks the workout down into multiple parts so that you can choose which segments to do (if not all), depending on how much time you have on any given day. So, you can do as little as 10 minutes and get a good workout, or you can do as much as 30 minutes (or more). Also, I like the Matrix moves. And she works the ab muscles in different ways than I've known before, a lot even while standing vs. laying on the floor. Plus, you can really feel the abs working. I've already lost 4-5 inches off my stomach and 17 pounds, and this workout combined with her Power Walk for Weight Loss, which I like even better, (in addition to cutting calories) is mainly what I owe it to in just two months time so far.

2612220,5,B000GH3CC0,"The workout alternates between 3 types of segments - standing abs/core work, short (but intense) bursts of cardio, and, the ""meat"" of the workout, the integrated, upper/lower body moves that were explained during the intro. There are two of Kathy's fellow exercisers that she points out as doing modified versions of the exercises for beginners. The core segments consist of knee lifts (while contracting abs) and side bends and twists to work the obliques, all with weights. The speed segments are high impact, but you're encouraged to go at your own pace, and they really help to keep my heart rate up. The integrated moves consist mainly of variations on squats and lunges, with a variety of arm and shoulder exercises using dumbbells.

The above is about 32 minutes, 5 minutes of which is the warm-up.

There are two additional 10 minute segments that are excellent - abs and stretch. There is really good variety in the abs segment - it contains no crunches at all - and I love the stretch so much that I do it even after other workouts. These segments are accessible separately on the DVD menu, so you don't have to scan through 30+ minutes to find them.

Kathy's hyper-perkiness from her old videos seems a bit toned down in this workout, which is a good thing to me. She's still definitely cheerful, and offers many good tips throughout about maintaining proper form.

If you're a bit out of shape (as I was when I started doing this workout) I would recommend doing the first time without weights - it gets you used to the movements, and it is still challenging. One of the women doing the easier modifications of the exercises doesn't use weights at all.

I love this workout because it challenges me and because doing it on a regular basis (alternated with other workouts) really has produced results - I`ve even had to increase the weights that I use for some of the exercises. I enjoy the efficiency of doing strength and cardio at the same time, and I really love the stretch session. Easily 5 stars!",1176249600,15,2014,4.661971830985915

2612222,5,B000GH3CC0,"I decided to start doing home exercise dvds since I can't get to the gym anymore.  I begin with my elliptical for 30-45 minutes and then do an exercise dvd 3-4 times per week.  I LOVE this Matrix Method by Kathy Smith.  It's the first one I've purchased from her (based on Amazon reviews), and it seemed to fit what I was looking for.  PRO's:  it's not boring, it's easy to follow along with, Kathy's instructions help me do everything properly, she motivates you and more.  Especially, I like the sequence of her exercises and how they work every part of the body, including your back.  The stretching in the last segment is fabulous! CON's:  Would like more Ab training (although I didn't do the 12 minute Bonus workout yet, which might have some on there)

Definitely try this workout if you want to get a quick complete workout.",1174780800,7,832,4.530201342281879

Kathy is always very motivating and a great instructor but this workout was not as difficult from the cardio or weight training aspect as I thought it would be.

The hour goes by pretty fast.  I think adding it in to my workout once a week is enough though.  I say for the Amazon price, add it to your collection :)",1173657600,4,329,3.642857142857143
2612226,5,B000GH3CC0,"I usually get my exercise by jogging, walking on my treadmill, working out with Leslie Sansone and strength training. Then at the beginning of the year I noticed I hit a plateau. I also noticed that I wasn't feeling challenged and worked out with my other forms of exercise. So I went on a hunt for something new and different. This is where Kathy Smith comes into the picture. I saw an ad in my Weight Watchers magazine for this workout dvd. I decided to look it up here at Amazon and read the reviews. With such good reviews, I decided to give it a shot. I have to say that I am NOT disappointed. I've been doing this workout 4 to 5 days a week for the last month and I can see a difference in the shape of my body. My husband has been very impressed with the changes, too. I still mix up the exercise routines with the aforementioned and Kathy Smith. I don't want my body hitting another plateau. This workout is tough but great. I highly recommend this dvd to those who consider themselves intermediate or better. I don't recommend it to beginners, though Kathy does have a woman who is supposed to be a beginner so that beginners can follow along. I personally believe it would be too much for a beginner which would and could cause discouragement.",1173312000,37,1253,4.358974358974359

8132222,4,B000GH3CC0,"I don't buy into this matrix method as revolutionary. Its lateral movement of lunges. I like it though it seems hyped.

Pros
Sweating furiously as a beginner
I like the various levels and modifications
The workout was over before i knew it
She incorporates all body parts
The cues are good
She is right there with u doing the workout

Cons
She sexually harrases her participants. I would do her video every day if i didn't have to watch her be so handsy. Its a turn off.
Some of the upper body moves for me don't safely or fluidly go with the lower body lunging and doing a lateral arm raise or whatever its called. Too quick of movements. Im afraid of rotator issues.

Overall i really like this video and her personality isn't that bad. At times idk she gets a little annoying. Maybe its just the sexual touches",1453420800,,813,4.406666666666666

8132226,5,B000GH3CC0,"I workout often, about 5-6 days a week pretty hard. I do Muay Thai and Boxing, not aerobically, the real deal, 3 of those days and try to compliment those workouts by doing lower body the other 2 days a week (since I am 32 and a mother). This is by far the best video I have EVER found, EVER for legs and glutes. Every time I try a new one just so I don't get bored, I end up horribly disappointed, even when they come highly recommended. Several things I love about this. For beginners you can start with no weights like I did, and slowly work your way up. I am now using 8 lb hand weights and I still get sore for 2 days usually. Although there are squats, the main focus is on lunges, which really works so much better in my opinion because really you are putting all your weight on one leg at a time. It also gets your cardio sky high. Seriously, the best video I have in my arsenal. I have gained real definition in my legs from this video.",1364774400,3,945,4.031914893617022
