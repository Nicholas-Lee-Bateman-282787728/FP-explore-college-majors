7984338,3,B00008H2HX,"This wasn't for me. It was for my parents. They love the movie, but they said it was kind of poor quality. But, for the price, you can't beat it.",1400803200,,145,3.8666666666666667
7984339,4,B00008H2HX,"I was skeptical when I read other reviews about the movie being short a half hour and such but I, at least, did not at all notice it. The movie arrived in a good quality movie case and the disc worked as I expected it to. I'm pretty happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend it.",1360713600,,290,4.105263157894737
7984340,2,B00008H2HX,"I was disappointed with the ""Calzonzin Inspector"" DVD. It is shorter than the original and, in some point, you miss the pace of the original film that ironicaly, was also projected in open mexican television with minor cuts.
If you want the ORIGINAL ""Calzonzin Inspector"", don't waste your money until the FULL version appears.
In the other side, the image quality is excelent, but I have the feeling that also the actual audio was censored.",1064534400,,441,4.8933333333333335
7984341,3,B00008H2HX,"Although this is one of the funniest movies depicting government corruption in Mexico (so accurately in fact that its release was limited and it remained commercially unavailable until today) this DVD is release is missing many scenes, which is unfortunate. I sincerely hope they release the full 2 hours.",1060387200,,305,5.244897959183674
7984342,5,B00008H2HX,"Calzonzin has been my favorite ever since I first went to Mexico as a teenager and discovered the Supermachos comics by ""Rius.""  He has suffered much censorship throughout the years because of his satirical, biting, and true political commentary.  Alfonso Arau has done a magnificent job of casting actors that look exactly like the original comic book characters...amazing.  If you knew the comics, you'll enjoy this hysterically funny movie even more.  I recommend the movie to everyone, it's even safe for kids, with a sometimes slapstick-type humor mixed with sophisticated political commentary you'll catch if familiar with Mexican politics and culture.  I've been trying to find a copy to buy for nearly 10 years!
My all-time favorite!",1034640000,,741,5.299145299145299
