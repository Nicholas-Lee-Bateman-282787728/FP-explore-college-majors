8002753,2,B0000TPAS8,"I picked this up because the character designer does some great stuff.  I wasn't expecting anything incredible and got even less.  I suppose some people like this sort of thing, but this dragged on way too long for me.  I wouldn't mind poor animation if the story was at least half way engaging. The first episode on this DVD is rediculously stupid.  The villian character pops up out of nowhere over and over again and it is irritating to say the least.
The last episode on this DVD had decent to good animation as they apparently changed up the team (different art direction and flat, single local color style of character animation).  If you really want to see these episodes -- rent.  Don't make the same mistake as I did.  Nice box art and a reasonably good 20 minutes of animation really aren't worth the price of this disk.",1076803200,,830,4.530201342281879
8002754,4,B0000TPAS8,"I just cant give this five stars.  Sure, it's cool, it's a great start to what promises to be an impresive series.  Unlike FF: The Spirits Within, this series really is Final Fantasy.  The opening of the show includes the classic FF crystal theme, and when battles end they are punctuated with the victory music from the games.  Other refrences thus far: Chocobos, Cid, Summons (Pheonix, Typhoon, and Shiva so far), and crystals, lots of crystals.  The series blends in CGI much in the same way that Cowboy Bebop did.
The problem is, it is starting a bit slowly for my tastes.  So far not a lot has been done with the characters themselves.  Maybe in the next four episodes, we'll see some real development.",1070496000,9,707,4.608
