7316746,5,B010U1MFV0,"This collection has quite a lot, spanning Sweet's career. While a couple clips are missing that I personally would consider essential, such as the Top of the Pops performance of Ballroom Blitz, this is still a 5 star set.

I watch it often. Not to be missed is the concert at musik laden. It showcases the raw talent Sweet possessed (and that those still living do. I just saw Steve Priest in concert and he's still got it even at his age now).

You won't regret this purchase. There's enough to keep you entertained for hours and you won't grow bored of it either.",1460505600,4,565,4.423076923076923
7316747,5,B010U1MFV0,"This is an amazing 3-dvd set!  I think $60 for a 3-dvd set is pretty ridiculous, but I paid it anyway.  Just as a previous reviewer noted, these dvd's WILL work just fine in a US Blu-ray/dvd player, so Amazon really should change their notes on this.  The discs are Region 0, and I had no problem playing them in my Sony Blu-ray/dvd player (which is sometimes even picky with normal Region 1 discs).

The clips are all fantastic; even enjoyed the '86 and '91 concerts with the ""quasi-Sweet"" incarnations.  The crown jewel of this set, for me, is the Musikladen mini-concert from 1974...wow!!!  It so freakin' rocks!  Absolutely love the version of ""No You Don't"" on there.  Also really enjoyed the Spinal Tap-esque feel of the old ""Sweet: All that Glitters"" documentary.

I was a little bummed that the clips for ""Fountain"" and ""Lettres D'amour"" weren't included...I really like those two songs from the Level Headed album.  Would have also enjoyed seeing more interviews (old and new) with the band members (yes, I know there's only two surviving members left), and maybe some more concert footage from their 70's heydays.  This band also deserves an all-new, in-depth documentary.

All in all though, a fantastic set for old fans, and new fans (like me) alike.",1457740800,11,1262,4.818604651162791

7316749,5,B010U1MFV0,"FAST shipping. FRIENDLY service. 5-star rating*****THANKS. I love it, finally DVD's of SWEET that have never been released.",1451001600,2,123,5.888888888888889
7316750,5,B010U1MFV0,"I have obtained this 3-DVD set from an Amazon 3rd party seller. The information given by amazon is INCORRECT. The set is NTSC/all regions. By the way, the 3-DVD set is a superb seven and a half hour collection, containing T.V. appearances, promotional videos and concert performances, not only by the classic Connolly/Scott/Priest/Tucker line-up, but also by several later line-ups of ""Andy Scott's Sweet"".",1449273600,10,406,5.359375
7316751,3,B010U1MFV0,"It's a good thing they brought out the promo videos & TV appearances from the early 1970s,1980s, and from today. Except a few promo clips were missing (Co Co, California Nights, Lettres D'Amour, Fountain) which was rather disappointing. Also, their ""lost"" Top Of The Pops performances of 'Ballroom Blitz', 'Teenage Rampage', and additional clips of 'Fox On The Run' on TOTP and 45, another set of TOTP clips of 'Co Co' and 'Love Is Like Oxygen' were excluded too. I could go on naming the other missing clips. It would've been great for Sweet is to have added a new documentary chronicling the band's history both past and present on this DVD boxset. On a scale of 1-10, I'd rate the item as a 7.",1445817600,5,696,4.576
7316752,5,B010U1MFV0,"This over-packed 3-DVD set features just over 7 hours of rare TV appearances, concerts, and music videos spanning Sweet's 40-plus year career.  All the biggest hits are here, including ""Little Willy"", ""Fox on the Run"", ""Ballroom Blitz"", ""Love Is Like Oxygen"", and of course, ""Blockbuster"".  Here's what's included:

DISC 1: SWEET ON TV - 19 TV appearances, including the post-Brian Connolly ""Call Me"" (approx. 59 minutes); Bonus section of 15 more TV appearances, including a performance of ""Do Unto Others"" by The Elastic Band featuring guitarist Andy Scott (approx. 51 minutes).  Of special interest in the bonus is an alternate take of ""Blockbuster"" from BBC Top of the Pops Christmas 1973 show.  Sharp-eyed viewers can catch singer Brian Connolly's microphone mishaps, bass player Steve Priest's pants changing from one shot to the next, and drummer Mick Tucker walking off stage for a second or two!  Best of all, this disc features 40 minutes worth of a previously-unseen concert recorded on 11/11/74, Live at Musikladen!  (The DVD liner notes speculate that the footage was actually a rehearsal that was filmed so the director could work out camera angles, etc.)

DISC 2: SWEET MUSIC VIDEOS - 17 music videos, including the Andy Scott solo song ""Krugerrands"" (approx. 59 minutes); the 19-minute BBC documentary ""All That Glitters"" (which features some wonderful behind-the-scenes footage!), and, as a bonus, 15 more rare TV appearances featuring several different 'versions' of the band, all of which feature Andy Scott (approx. 50 minutes).

DISC 3: SWEET ON STAGE - This disc consists of two separate concerts--Live at the Marquee Club London UK 2/12/86 (approx. 55 minutes), and Live at the Capitol Theatre Hanover, Germany 11/19/91 (approx. 1 hour 48 minutes).  Both shows feature Andy Scott versions of the band.  Other than the two concerts, there are no bonus features on Disc 3.

If you get the chance, pick this DVD set up!  It's worth every penny.  A Sweet fan's dream come true!",1444176000,27,1996,5.12037037037037

8723182,4,B010U1MFV0,"A must have for any Sweet fan, though I do wish Andy Scott did include complete live performances from the 1970s. The live sets from their later years are okay, and all the British TV stuff is good, but all of it does leave you wanting more than what is there.",1530144000,,260,4.117647058823529

There is not a lot of SWEET FOOTAGE available, this is the greatest collection out there. 74 MUSKILADEN is worth the price of admission all by itself.",1494547200,5,328,4.39344262295082

8723190,4,B010U1MFV0,"this  is  a  great  overall  dvd  of  footage  by  sweet  with  3  dvds jam  packed  with  so  much  stuff  it  runs  in  at  around  7  hours  long,  the  first  dvd  is  3  hours  in itself  and  of  coarse  features  footage  from  many  european  t.v  shows  from the  1970s  as  well  as  a  live  show  from  t.v  in  1974  wich  is  a  killer  part  of  this  dvd, i  was  not  crazy  about  the  1980s  incarnation  of  sweet  but  you  get  that  classic  marquee  london  show  from  1986  here  as  well  and  even  a  bit  more  from  1991  wich  really  does  not  interest  me  at  all,  i  wish  this  was  a  packed  two  dvd  set  of  footage  from  where  it  all  seems  to  begin  on  disc  one  with  t.v  footage  from  say  1972/73  onwards  to  1980  or  there  about  as  that  is  all  i  would  need. anyway  most  everything  seems  to  be here  but  as  others  have  complained  about  in reviews  there  is  that  great  top  of  the pops  footage  missing  but  the  few  things  i  saw  on  old  vhs  tapes  some  30  years  back  probably  did  not  make  this  three  dvd  set  due  to  LICENSING  issues  as  a  lot  of  us  fans  tend  to  forget  that  when  many  of  these  bands  appeared  on  television  way  back  in  the  60s,  70s  or  80s  THEY  do  not  own  the  rights  to  that  stuff  but  the  broadcasting  stations  do  and  tragically  and  sadly  i  have  been  told  a  lot  of  that  stuff  sat  in  vaults  and  after  only  a  few  years  they  (  the  stations)  destroyed  the  tapes  (  like  nhk  t.v  in  tokyo  did  with  that  killer  judas  priest  footage  you  see  on  youtube  from  1978) but  at  the  end  of  the  day  licensing  is  what  it  comes  down  to, im  glad  i  finally  got  this  dvd  set  though  as  it  is  great  to  watch  sweet  live  back  in  there heyday  as  they  where  such  a  huge  part  of  the  uk  glam  scene  but  seemed  to  get  robbed  of  a  lot  of  the  glory  they  probably  should  have had,  i  felt  the  best  uk  outfit  out  of  this  scene  from  way  back  then  was  SLADE!!!  as  they  where  a  lot  heavier  then  sweet  and  not  as  bubble  gummy  per  say  as  i  need  that POWER  that  slade  delivered  from  1970  to  1982.  as  of  now  in  2017  i  think  this  set  is  probably the  best  dvd  set  we  can  expect  from  sweet  as  after  all  there  is  so  so much here  and  if  you  where  a  fan  (  like  most  sweet  fans  i  know)  from  the  1970s  MAN  YOU  WILL  LOVE  THIS  FOOTAGE,  sure  you  can  find  quite  a  bit  of  it  on  youtube  but  i  also  really  enjoy  watching  stuff  like  this  on  my  T.V  screen  not  my  p.c  screen. anyway  i  am  very  happy  with  this  dvd  set  and  i  don't  feel  it  can  get  better  then this  in  the  future  so  if  you  where  a  big  sweet  fan  GET THIS  i  am  sure  you  will  love  it,  i  wish  a  dvd  set  like  THIS  would  come  out  for  STATUS  QUO  as  i  have  dvds  by them  but  most  of  them  mostly  carry  more  current  quo  footage  from  the  1980s  onwards  and  to  my  knowledge  there  has  not  been  a  single  quo  dvd  of  all  late  1960s  and  all  70s  footage  wich  would  be  great!!!!!!  also  i  think  we  are  long  over  due  for  a  nice  dvd  set  by  the  us  glam  band  ANGEL  as  im  sure  there  is  a  lot  out  there  from  1975  to  1980  as  i  remember  seeing  them  on  t.v  here  a  bit  during  that  five  year  period,  the  slade  dvd  set  was  done  a  lot  like  THIS  SWEET  ONE  back  in  2004  where  you  get  early  70s  through  the  80s  so  if  you have  that  this  is  a  lot  like  that  slade  dvd  where  you  get  it  all. i  guess  it  took  me  a  good  couple  of  years  to  get  this  as  sweet  where  not  my  favorite  band  of  this  era  as  i  said  before  my  ears  where  more  in  tune  with  the heavier  70s  stuff  like  UFO,  URIAH HEEP, NAZARETH,  THIN  LIZZY, WISHBONE  ASH,  DEEP  PURPLE, RAINBOW  BUDGIE,MOUNTAIN  and  so  on  but  i  am  really  glad  i  bought  this  as  it  brings  back  a  lot  of  great  memories  and  after  all  sweet where  a  great  band  from this  era...............................",1491436800,3,4224,3.7970027247956404
