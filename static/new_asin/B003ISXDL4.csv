8437732,5,B003ISXDL4,Bought this DVD for my son to use as research material for project that he is working on. I gave it to him at Christmas and we watched it together. He was extremely happy because of his age he never got a chance to ride on a Turbo Liner. His last view of the liners were as they were being taking apart to be used as salvage. This is A Great Buy and as Always Amazon is the BEST!!!,1357689600,,381,3.8354430379746836
