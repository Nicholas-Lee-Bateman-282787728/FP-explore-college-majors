8210926,5,B000NPLUTW,"This 1998 edition of ED SULLIVAN'S ROCK-N-ROLL CLASSICS is two half-hour episodes of the syndicated best of Sullivan series. Jay Thomas narrates vintage film clip montages prior to each act.

Dean Martin Jr. (age 13), Desi Arnaz Jr. (11) and Billy Hinsche (14) were discovered by Frank Sinatra while practicing songs in Dino's basement. He signed them to his record label, REPRISE. Sonny & Cher were originally called Caesar & Cleo. John and Michelle Phillips (of the Mamas & Papas) separated soon after this broadcast. The original Animals also disbanded one month after this final Sullivan performance.

The Lovin' Spoonful segment is a carefully edited trick video that Ed's audience viewed on monitors. The Supremes were a quartet that Diana Ross joined after one member left. When a second quit to get married, they became a trio that was soon world-famous. Unlike their Top 40 single, thanks to close miking here you can actually understand the lyrics to the Association's ""Along Comes Mary.""

Lip synched songs: ""Monday, Monday,"" ""Let's Hang On"" and ""Do You Believe in Magic?"" ""I Got You Babe"" is live vocal over a studio music track.
