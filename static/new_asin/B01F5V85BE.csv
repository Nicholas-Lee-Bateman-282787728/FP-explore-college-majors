7743847,5,B01F5V85BE,"Kind of off-beat and not what one might expect from the title, but like-able , simple characters.  Worth watching.  Not one of the best movies ever, but way better than most.",1477526400,,174,4.580645161290323
7743848,3,B01F5V85BE,"Good movie, period type piece; but no real denouement. These characters were definitely people of few words!",1477267200,,108,5.411764705882353
7743849,5,B01F5V85BE,"Gorgeous, quiet film with beautiful performances and so much to enjoy.",1475193600,2,70,5.454545454545454
8760212,1,B01F5V85BE,"Boring!  Watch people stare at a fire, cut wood, walk in the woods, read letters.  Shame on Richard Brody of ""The New Yorker"" for describing this tripe as ""an instant-classic western.""  Same goes for Alan Scherstuhl of the ""The Village Voice"" who calls it ""a knockout feature debut.""  Keep the names of these dimwits in mind along with the rags that hire them for film reviews the next time you look for critical reviews of movies.",1527033600,,431,4.631578947368421
8760213,2,B01F5V85BE,"The visuals  and scenery were pretty and nicely captured.  That was about it, though.  The story was basically what you'd get if you followed someone around with a camera and cut out most of the interesting parts.",1504569600,,213,4.702702702702703
8760214,1,B01F5V85BE,"The description says ""black comedy"" but I think it was meant to read ""dark comedy"". Horrible movie.",1491350400,,99,4.882352941176471
