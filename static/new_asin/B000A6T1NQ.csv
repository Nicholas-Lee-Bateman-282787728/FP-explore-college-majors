I later got to meet the stars and was even more delighted.  A solid rental, not every performance was on point but as the leads and supporting? Good stuff.",1401062400,,287,4.125
8075307,2,B000A6T1NQ,"For the budget this film was ok. Director Jimenez did as well as you'd expect with a script that, IMO, should have been re-worked a few more times. Not bad for the budget.",1285718400,,171,4.212121212121212
8075308,5,B000A6T1NQ,"I was one of the lucky people to see this movie before its release on DVD, its been in a few film festivals and i must say... it is a realistic action movie with characters that you can actually identify with.  The stars are not like the super-human ubermensch of the normal action movie, these are people that you can see yourself having a great night at a pub shooting pool with.

Then when the action hits, the plot only supports the character development.  (yes! theres a plot too) Speaking of the plot, it is something that i haven't seen before... the constitutional (pre 2000) loophole concerning bounty hunters.. interesting.

There are gunfights, doors are kicked down by masked gunmen, the FBI is involved, and the great thing is that if you haven't already been desensitized by the modern action movie's requisite ""it must end with an earth shattering explosion that the hero somehow escapes"" the action and violence is believable and appropriate.

If you miss the days of action heroes that you actually like, if you are sick of the ""cop on the edge blows up a small country"" plotline, if you like a movie where the plot, the action, the acting, and the characters mutually support each other, then you won't mind the ""indy film look"" compared to the token summer blockbuster, then you will enjoy this movie.",1123545600,6,1320,4.721739130434782
