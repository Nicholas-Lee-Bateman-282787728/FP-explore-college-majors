8181354,5,B000NTQNPY,"I finally managed to collect all three of this series, and there isn't a dog in the bunch. Great information and more importantly NEW information and ideas and approaches that would have taken YEARS to discover on my own. All three are fairly advanced, but they all really got me thinking along new lines. Inspiring stuff... seriously going to have to upgrade my system soon!",1298592000,,375,4.7846153846153845
8181355,5,B000NTQNPY,"Digital Set Extension and Matte Painting right now has exploded into the world of Entertainment! You've seen Star Wars, right? well most of the background scenery is done like this, you've seen Cast Away?, Fifth Element?, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, The Covenant, The Chronicles of Narnia, they too are good examples of the information that is jam packed in these dvd's, ""Digital Sets 1 through 4.
 If you want to be apart of it you must get these dvd's, I feel like I've gone to art college but only in the comfort of my own home. Like I said these gnomon dvd's are a little pricey but worth every penny!",1212883200,,616,4.451327433628318
