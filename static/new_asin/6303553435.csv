677659,5,6303553435,"Another State of Mind proves to be an excellent documentary exposing the ideals and values of punks in the early 80's. The film does a great job of capturing the spirit of the movement and what individuals, who were  involved, thought about their way of life. The flim also handles the other  side of the idealized values of punks well, as it displays the realities of  this society and members. The question of who can preach about punk ethics  when there's no food in your stomach, is correctly stated (and captured)by  Shawn Stern of Youth Brigade. The film unquestionably exposes the  inevitable tragedies of the 10,000 mile tour and does a great job in tying  the tragedy to somewhat of a learning experience, and thus triumph. Another  State of Mind is a must see/must have for anyone who has ever questioned  the society in which they live in. With themes ranging from the disregard  of money, to the the ideals of straight edge, this documentary covers the  entire spectrum of the pleasures and labors of punk rock.",920419200,5,1023,4.72316384180791
677818,5,6303553435,Great film.  It's very well put together and moves along nicely.  It shows the genesis of punk rock and is fun to watch.  I met the young filmmakers who shot this film and they really captured the movement and the music.  I cracked up over the scene of the musicians practicing stage diving at their family swimming pool.  I even have souvenir shirts from the film's promotion.  If it's playing anywhere go see it.  If it's not playing buy the video.  It's worth it either way.  Enjoy.,1407628800,,485,4.482758620689655

677824,5,6303553435,"""Another State of Mind"" is a documentary film made in the summer of 1982 chronicling the adventure (and misadventure) of two punk bands - Social Distortion and Youth Brigade - as they embark on their first international tour.  This film was discovered by my wife Linda many years ago when she met the young producers, Peter Stuart (son of renowned film producer Mel Stuart) and Adam Small.  After viewing the film we both thought the film was exceptional and deserved exposure so we got involved in its promotion.

Unfortunately, it didn't do as well as it should have and probably would have achieved it if more money would have been available for bigger promotion.  However, we are pleased that it is now considered a cult film and deserves a re-release which should elevate it to the position it deserves.  If you are looking for the ultimate depiction of the punk rock movement as it started this is the film to see.

677825,5,6303553435,"This should serve as an interesting introduction to the early days of the American punk scene for those who are caught up in the mediocre and boring culture of today. It's interesting to see the early stages of several great bands, most notably the mighty Social D. (Note: If you like this film be sure to check out the BYO comp CD ""Someone's gonna get their head to believe in something"" which is two of the BYO classic comps combined into one CD and is a great overview of early 80's southern California punk.) While the movie is interesting and fun to watch, you do get the feeling that the filmmakers probably missed a lot of the action (which Social Distortion front man Mike Ness mentions in his audio commentary on one of the DVD extras, which is almost as entertaining as the movie itself.) While the film is really just a sliver of what the punk scene was all about it does a great job of capturing the frustration and misunderstanding that the kids felt on a daily basis.

Talk about a group of intelligent, passionate, do-it-yourself kids. They literally patch together an old bus and hit the road on one of the first ever punk tours. All on their own dime. My favorite part was watching the young, soft-spoken Mike Ness. He always seemed to be operating on his own wavelength --true, he was drunk most of the time-- but his mind was always ticking behind those sad eyes. You just get the sense that if he wasn't writing and performing music he wouldn't have much other reason to live. A lot of cool interviews are peppered throughout the road trip and performances, and you get a real insight into the sensitivity, humor, hurt, and loss that make the punks tick. If you're an old school punk or you just want to see what punk rock was like back before it was turned into commodity, this is definitely worth checking out.",1355443200,4,1832,4.501501501501502

677859,5,6303553435,"This movie isn't really about Social Distortion or Minor Threat or Youth Brigade. It really focuses in on punks in 82, the punk revival I suppose though it seemed prominent at that time compared to now where it is non existent. It is apparent to me in this film that that whole emo thing has been done before and, only better when it really was punk. These kids, well people, who are my age disturb me to the core thinking they are original wearing eyeliner and tight jeans. Well it used to be punk now it is just sad. I may be ranting but I loved this movie as it is raw and touching and the cinematography is amazing in itself. The image of the whole group pushing the bus is amazing. I just bought this and plan to treasure it, it's a shame more people don't know about this mind blowing documentary.

677860,4,6303553435,"This is a classic punkumentary, which shows the reality of the road for up and coming bands. I don't think you'll see sum 41 or any other of the pseudo punk bands on the road like this.

This documentary makes Mike Ness and the Stern brothers look like dicks, especially Shawn who is so full of himself, but lets face it Mike (Orange County Sid Vicious) was a nihilistic prick when he was high/drunk anyway.  I wish there was more footage of Minor Threat.

If you want a raw and realistic look at the punk scene in the early 80's and what it took to tour with out the help of the music industry and producers, which are the death of creativity, then grab this documentary.  Don't believe everything you see and hear...regardless of being honest and raw, the makers of this film are not a part of the scene and loaded the movie with filler (pre-fab and post-fab)that was pre and re created for the movie.  The only truly punk rock, I mean nothing to live for, no tomorrow type of punk rock is Mike Ness and maybe Monk.  That being said...Ian Mackaye and Minor Threat are for real.  They are sold out...for their cause and truly real.  Do to the fact that they are straight edge, somewhat responsible, hold jobs and are squared away, they do not appear to be of the same credo as Mike Ness.

Love the music of Youth Brigade and the compilations that BYO has put out; Someone Got Their Head Kicked In et al...But if you really know who they are and their background...not so punk.  Sorry but I hate some of the ""college punks"" they represent.  I grew up in Huntington Beach circa 1980 (age 11) with no future, no money, single parent alcoholic hell...blah blah blah.  Hearing college punks try to tell me how it is and explain the deep meaning of the punk movement while they still live under the privilege provided by the establishment they supposedly hate makes me wanna puke.  I have a strong work ethic and want certain successes in life...so what, does that make me a sell out?  I grew up watching poseurs with a nice house and two parents, pretending to be hardcore...WTF!  Rebelling against what?  They were the same teacher's pets, jocks and the apple of their parents eye, GO DIE!  The whole dress code punk rock thing that in these days the mall stores market to, the instant punk/goth/whatevers,I feel ill.  These are the same type that acted like jocks ""What's up dick!"" while wearing the new Descendents T-shirts.  Mike Ness was for real...Ian MacKaye and his brotherhood for real.",1190419200,,2491,4.532438478747204
677861,5,6303553435,"Have to admit of all the punk DVDs out these days this has got to be my favorite, not least because of the content of the DVD but the commentary at the end from both the directors and members of Youth Brigade and Social Distortion.

I can only assume that some who have reviewed this DVD didn't watch the extra footage because for example the scene where the song 'another state of mind' was written was staged, other scenes such as the video of the Youth Brigade violenc has crowd shots from Circle Jerks amongst others mostly because the directors couldn't find good enough footage from Youth Brigade shows.

Its great to hear the 2 different perspectives from the directors who while wanting to make a loyal film on punk culture had to keep in mind that they had to sell the thing and they had contracts to stick to while band members complained about how many scene were unrealistic.  Scenes such as endless shots of toothless punks to make the film look more 'real'  the shot of the band sneaking in the back door of a show because the 'jocks' were waiting for them (in actual fact the 2 shots were from 2 different shows and while the band snuck in the back door the camera crew went in the front braving the crowd!  Other great things to look for are the punk chick/model from DC.  Realy interesting to hear the contrasting comments.  The band who deeply disliked that she was even in the film as she was unknown in the DC punk scene while the directors disliking the snobbish attitude of punks towards her pointing out that this was everything punk was not supposed to be!

Great to see Social Distortion live though, one of the great bands of punk.  Hear they always tried to sound like Americas answer to the Clash, not so sure about that but they were a great band.

Great DVD, one you will watch and watch again.  One point though, don't know why this is featured as having Ian McKaye in it as though he had some leading role.  He is in it for about 5 minutes.  If you are buying it to see some early Minor Threat there is about 2 minutes from a live show when the sound went and the crowd sings along.  Other than that you will be very disappointed.",1179187200,2,2162,4.359102244389027
677862,5,6303553435,"In Another State of Mind, we follow two fledgling LA punk bands, Youth Brigade and Social Distortion, on a tour accross the United States, as they leave a wave of destruction and cacophony in their wake.

This nostalgic throwback to youthful rebellion and hapless advocacy of the DIY ethic is quite contrary to what one might expect from current punk rock phenoms like Good Charlotte and Canadian pop-punkers Sum-41. Although, despite their best efforts(shooting in both 16mm and video), the deft editing and high production values are quite obvious.

Adam Small and Peter Stuart, whose mission was to prove to the masses that punk rockers were more than ""mindless morons,"" produce a high quality film, with most of the focus on the relationships of the band members and the ensuing drama within the tour. Mike Ness and Shawn Stern, from Distortion and Brigade respectively, are often taken aside for ""Real World""-esque interviews, exposing the seedy underbelly of the seedy underbelly that is punk rock.

As much as I enjoyed this film, one can't help but walk away wondering if a documentary of this quality and focus holds true to the cornerstones of punk rock: angst, violence, and the DIY ethic. It's ironic that Mike, Shawn, and the members of DC band Minor Threat devote their lives advocating these laurels, yet they participate in this new age project aiming to cut them off at the knees, exposing the drama of the softer, sweeter side of punk rock. If that's not MTV, I don't know what is.

I don't own any albums by Social D, Youth Brigade or Minor threat but this movie is alright. It reminda me a lot of the book Philosopy of Punk which I also recently read. The DVD offeres a lot of insight to the whole ""scene"" but personally it wasn't informative at all seeing as I already knew about it. At any rate, if you're into the three bands I'd pick up this movie just cause it has great tour footage and such also, it shows how the members of the bands really are behind the microphone and personally I always wondered who the asses of the underground are.",1138060800,2,662,4.1395348837209305
677865,4,6303553435,"Another State Of Mind is not just a title song of the movie, or a poplular song by Social Distortion. It was how they ( the young punk bands in the movie) lived their lives. These were kids that did not really fit into any socail structure. In the movie it is shown in many ways, be it the music, the way they dress or the way they talk. This is a movie that anyone that is into punk music should watch. It shows that punk is not something you can find at a local mall in a Hot Topic store. Punk was a way of living, and going across the country in a couped up bus is what real punk was. This is a great movie for fans of any type of music, and genre.

I have heard people say Another State of Mind is pointless and/or slow, but I think that works for it.  If you've ever been in a situation even similar to that, things don't happen quick and a lot of things happen during the journey and you don't always reach your destination.

677929,4,6303553435,"""Another State of Mind"" chronicals the trials and tribulations of three unknown punk bands making their way across North America in the summer of 1982. You can tell the tour is doomed before they ever leave Orange County, but that doesn't take away any of the fun of watching it all unravel. The VHS was worth renting just for the scene of Mike Ness giving himself ""a more sympathetic look"", but his 20th anniversary commentary makes the DVD version even more of a blast. Rather than be dissappointed by how little he remembers, you'll laugh along with him as he struggles to remember anything at all.

Hilarity aside (and there's lots of it) ""Another State of Mind"" also gives some pretty heavy insight into the familial dysfunctions and socio-economic realities that fueled punk rock at the start of the 80s. Its as instructive as it is funny. Its even (occasionally) poignant. Highly recommended.",1122249600,6,899,4.875816993464053

The Youth Brigade, Social Distortion, they worked pretty hard, traveling on a school bus that breaks down constantly, going hungry after not getting paid for their gigs.

I had a new respect for these bands. I look at Mike Ness with new eyes, which is funny since I have been a fan for a long time.

He is so young and open in his interviews, admitting to things like...watching General Hospital. You also see him actually putting together the song Another State of Mind.

He is so young and practically tattoo free, and this video gave me a taste of how they all paid their dues, and he is still doing it. He is still out there making great music.
