8342184,1,B001TOE8BI,"This video is a waste of time. It's basically a home video wrapped with a short prelim on the area along with some 'save the environment' BS. The voiceover is apallingly bad and it only runs for 15 minutes. The video quality is OK, but nothing special. If you're not into cave diving this won't impress you and if you are, it won't be anything you haven't seen before. As for the good cause it supposedly supports, I have my doubts.",1238544000,4,432,4.345679012345679
