1742948,3,B00006CY42,"I am writing this review for people who simply, like me, had no idea what to expect before picking up the series. Gasaraki is a mech anime with heavy grounds in politics and culture. I cannot help but admire Gasaraki for providing a realism to walking, warring, giant robots yet to be seen in any anime. Though many of the Gundams are political in nature, Gasaraki just gives vibes of an actual possible future (nothing is overly etrtraordinary). In other words, it's very down to earth for a mecha anime. It's views of politics are very persuasive and realistic yet somehow interesting as well. It really makes you wonder how ill-informed we in the public are about the actual truth of daily events. The culture, however....
 While you don't have to possess knowledge of Japan to understand the cultural references (as they are mostly unique to the anime), the cultural history provided in the anime seems to contrast the realism. The existence of beings known as ""kai"", though melding into the storyline of the use of mechanical robots, becomes too far-fetched when the viewer comes to learn of what sort of powers they are capable of. It also makes it a little hard for viewers to identify with the people who are ""kai"" due to the kind of lives they lead. And the ending is just WAAAAYYYY out there.
 In conclusion, I really wanted to like the anime for it's a innovative realism in the field of mecha-anime (a genre that has become exhausted and overrun by flashy toy selling robots), but it's that very innovative meld of politics, culture, and realism that seem to detract from one another. It's still a little refreshing change of pace from the rest of my collection but I'd highly recommend renting or viewing a little before you buy. Hope this helps!
Oh, just to add, the dub for this anime is also very well done.  I'm pretty much a sub purist but I felt the dub detracted very little if any from the content.  In fact, so many names are thrown around and so much dialogue takes place that it can aid the viewers understanding.  However, I always recommend watching something the way it was originally made first.",1030752000,5,2123,4.650666666666667
1742949,4,B00006CY42,"The success of an anime series hinges on many factors, such as animation, plot, and character development, and Gasaraki does not fail to satisfy on any of these departments. However, the plot is probably a bit too convoluted and excessively drawn out, which can make the otherwise good story seem boring. This is indeed a detriment, as one can start watching the series from the 13th episode, as it succinctly summarizes and clarifies the previous 12. It's much like watching DBZ. One can start at any saga one wishes and fully understand what's going on within that arc, yet he/she will not be knowledgeable of the back story.

Also, do not be misled by the heavy use of mecha as advertising art, as mecha battles are minimal, and personal problems and international disputes abound, and there is even a good dose of mysticism as well, perhaps more than one may initially expect. Gasaraki should be viewed for the story and not for the action, much like the original Gundam series from 1979, but unlike that seminal series Gasaraki isn't as interesting. Although many people prefer the original Japanese voice actors, the English actors presented on this series perform splendidly and do not fail to capture the emotions, or lack thereof in some instances, conveyed by the characters. However, the actor for one of the SSDF's captains (his name escapes me) annoyingly resembles Humphrey Bogart and the orangutan from the 1980s American cartoon show, Shirt Tails. His voice was completely unbefitting for the role, especially in such a serious series such as this.

Despite my somewhat harsh criticism, I found Gasaraki quite enjoyable. The animation is by far among the best I have seen, and the story, as complex and elaborate as it was, had a magnetic quality that prevented me from leaving the television. I believe that fans of Japanese voice actors should watch this series in English without apprehension due to the superb job of the English actors (with exception to the orangutan). Additionally, Gasaraki is a rather pleasant alternative to the typical action, magic, mecha, etc. anime out there that most people should enjoy. (Although this series is shrouded in mysticism, the overall militaristic nature has a stronger hold on the viewer).",1029283200,10,2251,5.016042780748663

1742991,4,B00006CY42,"Many have called Gasaraki an&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Neon-Genesis-Evangelion-Platinum-Collection/dp/B000767QTA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Neon Genesis Evangelion: Platinum Collection</a>&nbsp;rip off, and although I can see some of the reasons why, I could not disagree more. Although both shows have similar looking female leads (Miharu has a striking resemblance to Rei), both deal with mechs, and to some degree philosophy, the overall themes and focuses of the two shows are very different. EVA deals mainly with the human physique, the thoughts and ideas of its characters in order to explore what it is that makes its main character, Shinji, feel so lonely, outcast, and alone. EVA is mainly about the minds and thoughts of its characters with some mech battles thrown into it to make it a little bit exiting.

Gasaraki on the other hand is more of a political drama than anything else. Rarely does it dive deep into the minds of its characters, rarely does it explore the human mind in the way EVA does, instead it focuses on the politics of a near future world, the ways nations and major corporations constantly scheme against each other.

Although this show isn't a mech series, not in the way EVA or Gundum are, it does give a very realistic version of how mechs, or bie-pedaled weapons, could really be used in actual combat. EVA's mechs weren't practical in any way, and most others I've seen are used merely for the sake of having battles between giant robots, Gasaraki's mechs on the other hand could actually be used by real armies in real life wars. They have strengths and weakness that real weapons systems would have. They are very maneuverable, they can ever buildings, and can run circles around tanks. On the other hand, they are extremely difficult to pilot for long periods of time, and jam in the sand. They aren't invincible fighting machines like the Evangelions are in EVA, there simply a new battle platform, just like a tank or a personnel carrier with its own strengths and weaknesses. The mech battles, for the most part, are very realistic and exiting to watch. If you've ever wanted to see what a real mech in battle would be like, this show is a definite must see.

CHARACTERS. This show has a very large cast. From the Gowa family, which has seven members, to the TA team, which has eight members, to the Japanese politicians and illegal immigrants, it's very hard to keep track of everyone. Fortunately none of the characters look alike, so it's not too hard to tell them from one another.

The show also has a very great cast of secondary characters, some even better than the main characters. The TA crew is very fun to watch, with LT Sunao AKA munchkin (she's the youngest member) being my personal favorite. None of them get very deep pasts; for that matter neither do any of the main characters, but they do serve their purpose of lightning the mood of what otherwise could be a very dark series and movie the plot forward. Some, Captain Jun for instance, do get some pretty good development, even if it's completely dropped. Some are funny, some are serous, and some are just a little quirky, but they all get their own unique personalities and habits, which makes them all very fun characters to watch.

At the same time, however, the main characters, Yushiro Gowa and Miharu, are never really developed, especially Miharu. She's never given a real personality, or any sort of past. I never got a feel for who she really was, what she was thinking, or what her motivations were. In the end she, unfortunately, turned into a carbine copy of Rei from EVA. she was young, a mech pilot, a tool used by ambitious men, had short blue hair, and never did or said much of anything at all. Just as Rei was wasted in EVA, Miharu is wasted in Gasaraki. It's a real shame.

One character that was interesting to watch was Misuzu, Yushiro's little sister. All though the beginning part of the series she's the most annoying character I've ever seen (well, one of the most). She had a horrible voice actress, she didn't look her age, and she constantly referred to Yushiro as ""big brother"" instead of by his name, and was always weeping and running around scared. I have siblings and know how they act, but this girl was just too perfect, too innocent and whiny. She talks about dieing for her love, and quotes Hamlet. In the last volume though, her character completely changes from one of wasted potential to one of great interest. I won't ruin the ending, but lest just say she plays a surprising role in the outcome of this series.

PLOT. The plot in this series seems to change every two volumes, so there really are three parts.

Volumes 1-2 focus mainly on the war in Belgistan. These volumes introduce all the main characters and give us some really interesting battles to watch. As I've already talked about the war, I won't go into further detail.

Volumes 3-5. The middle part of the series, and the part I dislike the most, focuses on the two main characters, Yushiro and Miharu, running away from their captures and trying to find out just who exactly they are. These episodes get very mystical and delve a lot into Japanese myth and culture. We get to see a little bit of Japans deep past.

Volumes 6-7 bring the series back on track, revolve around a right wing attempt to other throw the Japanese government, and send the US into economic depression. This is, by far, the most exiting part of the series. When the US cuts wheat exports to other nations dew to crops failing, people riot in the streets and the Japanese government is forced to declare marital law. Since the right wing fanatics are in control of the military, they easily take control of the government after this. They then put into motion a plan that will throw the entire world into depression. In response the US sends it own TA's into battle.

ENDING. Oh, how the mighty have fallen. I've seen good series become great series because of their endings,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Now-and-Then-Here-and-There-Complete-Collector-s-Boxed-Set/dp/B000063K2C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Now and Then, Here and There (Complete Collector's Boxed Set)</a>&nbsp;comes to mind, and I've also seen great shows get ruined by their endings like EVA. Although I wouldn't say Gasaraki was ruined, I'd say that the ending brought it down to a 4 star instead of a 5 star rating. This is probably where most people get the idea that this is an EVA rip off, the ending is so much like it. I don't like psycho babble; I want the ideas and meaning to come out in the story, not a monologue at the very end. Fortunately the ending psycho babble only lasts for half of the last episode instead of two whole episodes like EVA's did, but at the same time it isn't as intelligent as EVA's ending (although that ending was very needlessly boring and complicated).  Gasaraki could have been a 5 star ending, but that ending was just unsatisfying. The ending credits save a little face, but just a little.

MUSIC. Most anime's have great opening songs but horrendous closers, think&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Serial-Experiments-Lain-Boxed-Set-Signature-Series/dp/B00067Z2X2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Serial Experiments Lain - Boxed Set (Signature Series)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cowboy-Bebop-The-Perfect-Sessions-Limited-Edition-Complete-Series-Boxed-Set/dp/B00005QCW4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cowboy Bebop - The Perfect Sessions (Limited Edition Complete Series Boxed Set)</a>, EVA, and just about every other anime series out there. This one is the complete opposite. It has a completely horrible opening song, but a really beautiful closer. The rest of the music for this series isn't really noteworthy; nothing really stands out.

BOTTOM LINE. I've only touched the surface of what Gasaraki has to offer. There is so much more to this series that I just wasn't able to get to. this series really has a lot more in common with Ghost in the Shell then it does with EVA, so if you like Ghost than this might be good for you.

1742992,5,B00006CY42,"to be frank, I love this anime. it's very intelligent, very realistic (well more like unrealistic with a lot of realist boundries.) it's not very funny at all, but it was never designed to be. if you like anime, if you like mechas and you wanna see how they would work in the real world. then this is for you.

the only down sides to this anime is that it's not always action packed which is ok because then you are just getting to know the characters around.",1179792000,3,459,4.215909090909091
1742993,2,B00006CY42,"Some folks liked it, some didn't get it. I guess I fall into the ""didn't get it"" group. Started very slowly, ending was, well, confusing and unsatisfying...

So, I guess this one and Serial Experiments: Lain I'll have to pass on. They just didn't much make sense...? Maybe it was the translation, maybe it was just good intention and bad execution. Who knows. If you don't ""get"" anime, or the super-complicated storylines and jumbled philosophical logic that doesn't end up making sense, you might want to skip this one too...

----------

Addendum: Okay, I re-watched Gasaraki again, more completely this time. It wasn't ""as bad"" as I made it out to be. There was some decent action in it. The philosophical mumbo-jumbo was still a bit much and left a slightly bittertaste in my mouth since it didn't really go anywhere. ""The dance"" didn't really do anything for me either. But that may simply eb a cultural thing I'm completely unfamiliar with. So, I'd perhaps give it a 3-star rather than my original 2. I'd still rather watch ""other"" mecha animes like  Mobile Suit Gundam Wing - Complete Collection&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1/dp/B000CEV3NM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1</a>&nbsp;&<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2/dp/B000EQ5UY6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2</a>, Mobile Fighter G-Gundam&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1/dp/B000EQ5UYG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1</a>&nbsp;&<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2/dp/B000EXOAG8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rahxephon/dp/B000929VA4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rahxephon</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Martian-Successor-Nadesico/dp/B00006CY45/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Martian Successor Nadesico</a>, or cyberpunk like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Texhnolyze/dp/B000FJGR6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Texhnolyze</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghost-in-the-Shell-Stand-Alone-Complex/dp/B000HIVQAS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a>...",1148601600,7,2300,9.118942731277533
1742994,2,B00006CY42,"Evangelion was a very good anime, but unfortunately it spawned a number of similar, lower quality rip-offs, and Gasaraki is one of them. Evangelion combined big robots fighting with religion and psychology to dazzle many viewers worldwide. Gasaraki combined religion, a dash of mysticism, and snooze-inducing politics of apparently fictional countries to lull the few people who sought it out gently to sleep.

The main female character even looks like a Rei Ayanami knock-off.

I really do like the end theme though.",1146960000,4,517,5.2926829268292686
1742995,2,B00006CY42,"This is possibly the worst thing I ever saw. It's boring and so much stuff happens too quickly. It's storyline is pretty stupid as well. Most of the characters are useless and only three of them have of sort of personality.

1742996,4,B00006CY42,"Gasaraki is a good anime to watch, if you have the patient to sit though the entire series. It is slow paced due to the complex deep plot and political intrigue. Some viewers are bored to tears because of it.

The legitimate Perfection Collection can be had for around $30 if you shop around, mostly due to the market saturation and insufficient demand of it.",1116028800,4,359,4.523076923076923
1742997,5,B00006CY42,"The reason I say so is that much of this series isn't action oriented.  It is highly politically and economically influenced.  Although it has action now and then, it might bore the kids with all the scientifical terms.  Truly a wonder as it goes through war, to a troubled and mysterious home life, to a political world and back to war again.

1742998,2,B00006CY42,"I'm not going to tell you the plot since you can get that from description above. I'm just going to tell you about the good and the bad.

The good thing about Gasaraki is it has a very deep plot and the termonology describing the giant robots sound realistic. It's definitely not for kids. The animation is also very realistic, the characters are more in proportion to real life people.

I think Gasaraki's major flaw is there is hardly any character development and it's almost a little too real. The whole story is centered around the technology, philosophy, and conflict of the story- not on the characters. There is absolutely no humor. Even when the people try to be funny, it's crushed by the extremely serious mood. It was hard for me to become attached to any of the characters with all the conflict and technology mumbo jumbo. I also wasn't a big fan of how the world looked very similar to our present day world. I would have preferred more Sci Fi scenery.

Gasaraki left me with a cold feeling. I felt like I was watching a war documentary. If you like that sort of stuff, then you should like Gasaraki. But you should avoid this anime if you like shows where there are many characters with tons of personality.",1109894400,5,1222,4.520361990950226

But you also had Gasaraki.  Gasaraki was my favourite of the mecha series immediately post-Eva because of its seriousness, its complexity and its realism.  No squealing kawaii heroines, no slapstick comedy, no animal sidekicks.  Probably because of its subject matter, which was greatly informed by Japanese culture and geopolitics.  Mecha were presented as realistic engines of war, and despite their skill and effectiveness, even mecha pilots could be lost in the currents of political and corporate intrigue.  It was a convoluted mess at times, but overall was a good example of highbrow seinen anime all too often lacking among the swarm of shjo and shnen series.",1104192000,4,875,5.207142857142857
1743010,2,B00006CY42,"Personally, I would give this a 2.5/5. However, its short of being the brilliant and amazing series that it could have been.

The good: Visually, it was beautiful, especially the last volume. Backgrounds and the mecha battle scenes. There were noticeable focuses towards the mecha battles, as in they got a little more detail than a IMPORTANT plot!

The basic storyline is still hanging, yet interesting, and the characters have good character development throughout the series. The sounds and music are all averagely appropriate, though there is a noticeable lack of background music during common conversation scenes.

The Bad:

Even though it is a mecha-centered anime, it's not an ""action-heavy"" series. Much more like the Patlabor movies, it prefers to tend down and go to the plot. Basically I think what happened is they had about thirteen episodes, condensed the plot that they then tried to spread over an entire 26 episode season. With meaningless conversations, mind-numbing ""tutoring"" in the pecific aspects of the machines and events that are occurring, and weak plot catches In the first disk they hint that it takes place 8 years, you would careless...its so boring. According to my brother, he fell asleep. The plot probably wouldn't be so weak if there weren't so few of them in each episode. I should also give fair warning here that the series doesn't pick up until about halfway through.

Gets better near the end. Not recommended, yet it did fairly well, if not well executed. I definitely agree w/ you that it deserves more than a 1...thats why I fairly give it a 2.3/5 stars",1102809600,2,1597,4.9440298507462686
1743011,4,B00006CY42,"The plot of Gasaraki rotates around the actions of the powerful japanese family ""Gowa"". Yushiro , the youngest member of the family and also the expert ""mech"" pilot, turns out to be the true center of all the events that will unfold along the 22 episodes of this series, as he sets on a quest to discover his true identity and unusual powers.
On the other hand, the existance of a foreign pilot with similar powers, Miharu, will take the viewer into a plain of love and romance as both pilots discover that they are bound in ways they could never have imagined and that their inner connection surpasses even their current existance!

Overall , I find this Anime to be quite exciting and also perfect for those who enjoy a good ""political plot"" behind the common ""mecha theme"". It is certainly one of the best choices if you like a VERY deep and consistent plot, that will leave you thinking quite HARD for most of the time, in order to fully understand the several events going on at the time!

In terms of SOUND, Gasaraki is also very good, as it can create the actual sensation of being INSIDE the series, which only deepens the already intricate plot.

The only problem I've seen in it, were perhaps some ""dull"" moments from time to time, but I also understand they are quite necessary in order to completely show you the complex personalities of each character.

In conclusion, I can only say that Gasaraki is a great choice if you're into Anime that leaves you thinking about it HOURS after you've finished watching it. If you're looking for something ""light"", then Gasaraki isn't for you!",1099180800,2,1594,4.602112676056338
1743012,5,B00006CY42,"I had read the reviews about this title, and I've wanted to get this series for a long time. Did this anime meet my expectations? Yes, it met them all the way!
Through the series' 22 episodes, we get that 'everything is not as it seems' feeling, which keeps the viewer guessing as to what the outcome of the anime will be. Gasaraki's story is deep in plot, and the use of realistic political threats set in today's world gives you a fresh feeling, compared to other animes where the main characters fight aliens, monsters from outer space, etc.
The mecha themselves are realistic in nature, and the theories mentioned in the story will make you believe that one day such machines will be real. But this is where the anime is different from other mecha titles. Only about 40% of the anime has mecha combat, but when it does get to a fight, it's put to good use.
The character development is top notch, and is crafted well. The main characters, Yushiro and Miharu are very believable, and you can feel for these characters.
I was VERY impressed by the dub cast, as I found very little flaws in them. While you may think that there is a voice or two that could've been better, it's nothing to really complain about, as it's near perfect to the way the characters are. I actually enjoyed the dub more than the sub. As a plus to this, you can enjoy more of the animation and not worry about reading subtitles. But the DVDs come with japanese vocals with subtitles, for those who prefer it that way.
This is truly a great series, and shouldn't be missed, whether you're a mecha fan, or a person who likes a great story. This DVD set is also well worth it, as buying each DVD separately by themselves would cost more.

1743013,3,B00006CY42,"The Gasaraki premise is unique and intriguing: only two people--young Yoshiro Gowa and Miharu, both opposing ""pilots""--are blessed with the ability as ""kai"" to summon the Gasaraki, a powerfuly, mysterious, but extremely destructive force. As kai, they are also endowed with wonderful physical abilities, such as extreme endurance, and the ability to raise and maintain their pulse rates at exceeding two to three hundred beats per minute, a quality that makes them ideal pilots of battle-ready robots thrown into the mix in a middle-eastern war.
A 3.5 star rating would be more appropriate for this series which seems to show so much promise. The art is of a newer sort that promises to be the medium in which all subsequent anime will follow: cleaner, flatter characters, drawn more thickly and with less of the lines that make some anime attractive. The main characters, Yoshiro and Miharu are extremely inviting and well-developed characters. The battle scenes are fluid, and the designs for the kugai (as the legend goes, the kai perform a Noh Dance to summon the Gasaraki, which takes or kills the kai, leaving a kugai--a primal, predator-looking giant robot in the Eva mode) are spectacular. The movie moves at a good consistent pace, with few slow spots, and the important section flashing back to the history of the kai in ancient Japan is extremely compelling, and could survive as a show on its own. Yet how does it fail?
The biggest culprit is in its ambition. The plot is extremely heavy and disorganized, loaded with plenty of philosophy, politics, legend, and politics. And politics. This would have been okay if it had the background story and character development to support it, but other than Yoshiro and Miharu, the characters are all given fluctuating levels of importance, with little or no exploration of who they are. There are so many characters anyway that doing that would be impossible. To better muddle through Gasaraki, separate characters into these groups before watching:
Yoshiro and Miharu, the kai/pilots; the Gowa corporation, Yoshiro's family, which basically rules Japan; the Symbol corporation, most noted by its CEO; Yoshiro's squad mates on Japan's battle mecha team; the US, Japan, and another Middle Eastern countries as separate entities; and a side group that includes Yoshiro's younger sister, mother, and Noh dance teacher.
Understanding that these groups exist and that they each have their own motivations will hopefully be helpful. It's a good watch, but requires plenty of patience. The ending is almost a side note to the climactic section on the kai flashbacks. It's an ending, but not a satisfying one.

Yushiro, of the Gowa family, and Miharu, of Symbol, are both mech pilots of great skill.  In fact they are many times better than any other pilot and seem to be linked in some way.

Set in a possible near Future, the Story is driven by the political Ambition of the Gowa-Family and of a mysterious Group, who is following the same goal: to call for the Gasaraki - an ancient mythical Figure with unknown Powers. This Power can be called or chanelled only by special peoples, known as KAI.
Although sometimes the story becomes difficult to understand when reaching deep into the esoteric and mystical ""Kai""-Plot, it is exactly this need of deeper understanding that makes Gasaraki unique and worth watching it (besides the great animation and music...). In a collection where you can find Ghost in the Shell, Cowboy Beebop, Princess Mononoke and Samurai X, Gasaraki should not be missing.",1046563200,8,896,5.0608108108108105

Gasaraki is a slow-moving complex political drama with some excellent mecha action thrown into the mix.  The series starts off right in the centre of a weapons development programme in Japan and goes on to develop a story about global political manoeuvring played on very high stakes.  Adding to this heady mix is the incorporation of some mystical and supernatural elements coupled with traditional Japanese dance theatre to drive this complex political drama along.
Mecha fans should rejoice as this series features probably the most realistic depiction of a military mecha unit, so realistic that it could possibly be built in the very near future.  Considerable thought has been put into how a real military mecha would be used, their strengths and weaknesses - e.g. a bipedal mecha unit in a sandstorm will suffer from having fine sand clogging the joints and actuators.
Not only is the mecha frightening realistic, some of the political events featured and how these are all presented (via cable and satelite news) are spookily like the real thing.  The political manoeuvring is a delight to watch while the philosophies and thinking are quite interesting.
By now, you're probably asking whether the ending is satisfying in light of what some have written before.  It all depends on how conclusive an ending you are looking for.  All I can say is that I'm quite satisfied with the ending.  Without giving out any spoilers, I can tell you the ending of the series will provide an explanation of what Gasaraki means which ties in with one of the overall themes of this series.
There is an unfortunate aspect to Gasaraki though, as given the amount of detail and depth of the story, something usually has to give and in Gasaraki's case, character development suffers.  This is due to both insufficient time to properly realise the key characters as there are many things that are left unexplained, and the large number cast of secondary characters involved.
Considering that this is a relatively recent series, the animation quality throughout the series is very good.  There is one very pleasant surprise though, the English dub for the series is excellent and is a match with the original Japanese track.  This is most unlike quite a number of anime series out there where the English dub just doesn't match with the characters on-screen.
There are no special extras with the boxset (except that it, of course, comes with a box) as it is just a collection of all the 8 DVD volumes into one neat package held in a cardboard box.  If you are ready to commit to the series, this Perfect Collection boxset is a cost-efficient way to pick it up.",1045699200,13,2909,4.80561122244489
1743017,4,B00006CY42,"I saw a trailer for it on a Robotech disk. When I saw it, I new I had to have it. The intro song is what got me. The story is there but it can get hard to follow. So if you like Cowboy Bebop, Akria and Princess Mononoke. you will like this.",1042243200,,240,3.547169811320755
1743018,3,B00006CY42,"Firstly, I would like to say that the production values for this series are much above the typical anime.  The artwork is great, the music is well above average (the opening theme is very haunting), the mechs (T.A.'s in Gasaraki lingo) are interesting, and the pseudo-historical tale of the kai's is both original and intriguing.  It's a great shame that this series never comes close to realizing it's potential.
Unfortunately the writing is badly flawed with faulty economic and political theory, endless silly techno-babble, and interminable rehashing of the same philosophical ideals in episode after episode.  It takes over the series, and by the time you get half-way through, you're wishing they'd just get on with the show. This is a series that I really wanted to like, but in the final analysis it was a disappointment.
If you're looking for a quality anime, you'd be much better served by Cowboy Bebop, Ninja Scroll, Princess Mononoke, or Ghost in the Shell.",1036800000,9,969,5.0062111801242235

 I was looking for global scale war and intrigue, perhaps some super powers and genetic experminenting religious orders like Code Geass.

Maybe good for a different type of anime fan, not this guy. Would not watch again. Anyone lookin for a lightly used set?",1394755200,,529,4.574468085106383

7967320,3,B00006CY42,"Yushiro is a member of the Gowa clan. The Gowa clan is about to start a revolution. They will use a new mech that Yushiro pilots. He is also a Kai. He has the power to summon a god called Gasaraki. The Gowa clan will use these powers to overthrow the government and take control. Yushiro has a secret that he doesn't understand himself, and his brothers aren't talking. He meets a girl named Miharu. Miharu has a strange connection to Yushiro and may hold the key to understanding his purpose.

This anime has a very well written story. It's carefully thought out and has lots of suspense and mystery. A lot of people say that it's very complicated. I don't think so. It's very easy to understand if you pay attention. The downfall of this anime is the terrible character development. Even at the final episode, you feel very distant and know next to nothing about the characters. I'll give the story 5 stars, and the characters 1 star. Unfortunately, it takes solid character development and a solid story to make a great anime. Gasaraki only has 1 of those aspects covered. I can't give it any more than 3 stars. I can't recommend Gasaraki to anyone that wants to see an anime with good characters. If you don't care about that and only need a good story to be happy, then you may enjoy this series. Personally, I was very annoyed and forced myself to finish it b/c I had bought the entire set based on good reviews.

I have tried to be objective and give good information about this series' strengths and weaknesses. There are lots of people that get pissed if you give an anime a bad review. I have only been truthful. The only people that should be angry with what I said are the people that made Gasaraki. I don't want a bunch of hateful comments and not helpful votes for being honest.",1355443200,2,1792,4.443768996960486

7967322,1,B00006CY42,"Some series create a sense of intrigue when you are thrown straight into the mix without an explanation -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elfen-Lied-Diclonius-Report-Complete-Collection/dp/B000I5Y8KA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elfen Lied: Diclonius Report Complete Collection</a>&nbsp;is one of them. However, for that to be effective there needs to be a sensible, satisfying explanation at some point. Gasaraki gives none.

I knew from the first episode that this series had lost me. It held a lot back on the storytelling, but in the sense of ""we're not going to let you know who's who or what's what"" more than any gripping sense of mystery. Like a modern-day Hollywood movie, they brought up a lot of correct details about why bipedal machines have never been utilized, but they never really get into what changed that and all portrayal of them in action was just like every other ""the mecha are invincible except to each other"" that makes me dislike many mecha shows.

The characters are typically a vital point of a series, but even by the end I felt absolutely no attachment to a single one of them. They, like the series, remained dry, flat, and lifeless. I understand that this is supposed to be more a political thriller, but they tried to bring in action and a few other things and failed at every single mark. Besides the lame story (which cops out at the end, making the time feel even more wasted), the sound, music, and graphics were unexceptional.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vandread-and-Vandread-the-Second-Stage-Complete-Collection/dp/B000OZ2CTS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vandread and Vandread the Second Stage: Complete Collection</a>&nbsp;looked and sounded amazing from the first 30 seconds and never disappointed even to the last 30 seconds.

7967323,3,B00006CY42,"Gasaraki is one of those shows that seems to be either a masterpiece or a total bomb, depending on who's doing the reviewing. Naturally, I'm right in the middle. Gasaraki is slow moving at first, but picks up speed around episode 13 and moves well to the end. The visuals are excellent for the era it was made, and the minimalistic soundtrack fits it well.
The dub is competent, if not stellar, and it's interesting to hear some of ADV's veterans in early roles.
As a political thriller, it's done well, with lots of intrigue and sub plots. The ending, however, felt like a deux ex machina to me, with the revealing of the origin of Gasara.",1215129600,2,640,4.478632478632479
7967324,4,B00006CY42,"This either will or will not be your cup of tea depending on how much patience you have, which is to say it takes some to appreciate this complex series.  This is one of those mechas where you have the standard teen pilots, ambiguous blue-haired girl, and secret organization.  That said, the series is really an attempt to lay a Noh drama on top of the mecha story and requires some background on Noh theatre to really appreciate.  Anyway, approach it as a Noh piece and you will see what an impressive attempt this series really is.

It isn't a perfect series as the complexity of the story adds confusion where less may have been more.  This is a series that relies on lots of text (with the newscasters serving as a type of Noh chorus) and at times, there's simply too much going on.  Some episodes simply end, but this may be a preference (on my part) of episodes which can be self-contained as well as appreciated on the whole.  Overall, Gasaraki is an above-par series for those interested and at the price, it's one to own!",1210723200,3,1031,4.452127659574468
