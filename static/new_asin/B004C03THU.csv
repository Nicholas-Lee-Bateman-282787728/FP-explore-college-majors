4321253,5,B004C03THU,"Its Funny how they are coming out with collection, as my wife and I were talking about this a few months ago. We told each other how nice it would be if they would come out with a DVD with all the Mater Toons on it. My son loves these shorts, and since we had to reduce over TV package, he isn't able to see them anymore. Now, he will be able to watch them whenever he wants. They are so funny, and I can't wait to see his reaction when he sees this. He asks us about these toons everytime he watches Cars, so now I can tell him he can watch them again. Great idea by Disney to release this.",1288224000,9,591,3.8524590163934427
4321254,4,B004C03THU,"For those of you who do not have the Disney Channel, Mater's Tall Tales are five minute CGI animated shorts based on characters from Pixar's Cars. They are about the tow truck, Mater, regaling his friends on his numerous (and outrageously unrealistic) adventures such as meeting a UFO, being a world famous bullfighter, professional wrestler or daredevil, and other crazy situations. These shorts always fall back on the same joke where Lightning McQueen challenges Mater's tale as being true and Mater replying with, ""Don't you remember? You was there too"", which ends with McQueen being in the thick of the tall tale.

The animation quality is on par with the movie. Plus you get appearances of other Cars characters like Sally, Red, Mia and Tia and more. They even get just about all of the original actors to do the voiceovers with the notable exception of Owen Wilson as Lightning McQueen (replaced by veteran voice talent Keith Ferguson). All in all a fun little cartoon to fill time between shows on Disney.

This Blu-Ray collects all of the shorts ever released and a couple that haven't come out yet. This totals nine cartoons, so it's not exactly a large amount of content at about 40 minutes. You do, however, get about 50 minutes of additional features to whet your whistle. Here's a list of the bonus stuff:

Paths to Pixar - Similar featurette to the ones on other Pixar collections this has interviews with Pixar artists, editors and such and gives insights on their experiences and other career details.

Studio Stories: McQueen Has No Hands - The challenges of manipulating a map when your character doesn't have any hands.

Mater: Bumper to Bumper - Goes into detail about the creation of Mater and how he is animated.

Making of Mater's Tall Tales - Self Explanatory. Documentary on creating the Mater shorts from conception to finished product.

Unmade Tales - Some of the ideas that didn't make it to production. Each one has an intro by Director Rob Gibbs and are pitched by the story artist. Tales include Runway Mater, Stunt Mater, Backwards to the Forwards, Car-nival and Import Mater.

Cars Toons Story Reels - Mater the Greater, Unidentified Flying Mater and Mater Private Investigator all shown in their conformed storyreels shown against the final audio track. You also have a picture in picture option to see both the reel and the finished product.

Cars Land Sneak Peek - Just as it says you get to see the upcoming Disney California Adventure attraction Cars Land. Mainly behind the scenes stuff.

If you love the movie Cars and/or the Mater shorts then of course this is the disk for you. Makes me wonder if they will re-release the Toy Story Treats that were done in 1996 somewhere on a Blu-Ray collection. Just keep in mind you are paying for about 90 minutes of content including all of the bonus features. It's a short disk.",1286928000,139,2861,4.796747967479675

My kids actually like watching the bonus features, too, and seeing the concept art, etc. It's really interesting! We take breaks from this, but it's one that we can always come back to and rely on to silence an epic meltdown on a long car trip.

Poor guy watches until it skips then parents have to try to skip past the defects. A pain in the butt to say the least.

4321348,3,B004C03THU,"Being the Pixar fan I am, I took note when they released Mater's Tall Tales, a collection of Cars Toons, late last year.  I kept almost buying it and talking myself out of it.  I recently finally gave in and bought the disc.  While I enjoyed it, I wish I had borrowed it from someone first instead.

Apparently, most of those shorts started out as a series shown on The Disney Channel.  And maybe that was my biggest problem.  We've got 9 shorts for a total running time of 38 minutes.  Yes, if you're doing the math, you realized that each story is only about 4 minutes long.  And considering they are formulaic, if you sit down and watch them all back to back, they begin to get a little repetitive.

Your basic story goes something like this.  Mater and Lightning McQueen are hanging out, sometimes with other characters from the movie Cars around as well (although they rarely speak).  Something happens that reminds Mater of some wild adventure he had.  Just as things are getting their most outrageous, Lightning asks Mater how he dealt with the situation, which prompts Mater to say, ""Don't you remember?  You were there, too.""  And sure enough, for the remainder of the tale, Lightning is part of the action.  Things end, and Lightning drives off not believing the story, but something always happens that makes us wonder if it was true or not.

So, what kind of tall tales do we get?  I've got to admit that some of them are downright clever.  Once upon a time, Mater was a famous bulldozer fighter in Spain.  He helped a UFO escape from Parking Area 51.  Mater was a wrestler, dare devil, and participated in a drift style race in Tokyo.

Two of the stories are new, created especially for this disc.  They are ""Moon Mater"" which finds Mater traveling to the Moon to tow a probe who falls into a crater and can't get out.  With my love of mysteries, it's no surprise that I loved ""Mater Private Eye"" which finds the tow truck on the case of counterfeit tires and a carnapped twin.  It's told in the classic hard boiled style, including black and white animation during the story itself.

Most of these stories are fun on their own.  They are a little short, even by shorts standards, but I can see why they'd be entertaining if sprinkled in to something else you were watching.  Sitting down and watching them back to back takes away some of the freshness, however.  They really all begin to look alike since the formula is so obvious.  These were meant to be enjoyed in very small doses and not for 38 solid minutes.

Another complaint is the voice cast.  Larry the Cable guy comes back to voice Mater, but Owen Wilson wasn't back as Lightning.  They didn't do a good job matching his voice either, and it was obvious every time he spoke it wasn't really Lightning.

The disc has about as many extras as it does content.  You get the typical stuff with the artists talking about the characters or the shorts.  It's interesting if you are a big enough fan, but there is little ground breaking information here.

I got the Blu-Ray version of this release.  It comes as a two pack with a DVD as well.  Best I can tell, the two discs have the same content, so if you want this and are thinking about getting just the DVD, spend the extra two or three bucks and get this set.  You'll get that second disc for not much extra money.

Mater's Tall Tales is fun in the small doses it was originally intended for and not to sit down and watch all at once.  Sit down and watch one or two, and you'll enjoy them.  Otherwise, they'll lose their humor.",1431734400,,3549,4.430340557275541

4321440,5,B004C03THU,My nephew loves this movie!! He watches on my Netflix account every time he visits so I decided to buy him the DVD so he can watch it at home. It keeps him occupied.,1388534400,,165,3.8823529411764706
4321441,5,B004C03THU,My daughter had been obtaining the movie from the library on loan; but now the children can enjoy any time they feel like putting it on.  It brings smiles to their faces!,1388361600,,170,4.3125
4321442,5,B004C03THU,This is a compilation of shorts which is very entertaining for the kids.  There is also behind the scenes that the adults really enjoyed about cars land and several other details.  Very much worth the sub 10 dollar price for a blu-ray and DVD combo pack.,1388188800,,254,4.5

4321444,3,B004C03THU,"I showed these at my 5 year old daughters car party and she and the guests loved them.  I found them to be a bit over the top action wise but our kids are very sheltered so they are probably alright for most kids who are allowed to watch more intense stuff.  She has certain ones she does not like to watch as they are scary to her, but overall she loves Mater and his tall tails.  Worked great for a BD party but I'd hold them for the end.",1388016000,,440,3.8666666666666667

Phrases like: ""You remember, you was thar too..."",  ""One daaaaay"", ""You didn't maaake it"", and ""Roger dodger Roger"" are common in our daily back and forth.  I mean if you have a youngster in the house you just have to have it...dad gum!",1386806400,,303,4.375

4321460,5,B004C03THU,"Maters Tall Tales in the Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack gave me a Blu-ray for myself and a DVD fro my granson who wears his favorite discs out.  This is his second copy of this release.  The Tall Tales are short, funny and can keep even me occupied for a while.  I had an elderly Uncle who has passed on due to cancer.  During one of my visits he told me that Cartoons were not meant for choldren but for adults.  Now, at nearly 61, I see his point.  No child will read the signs posted by Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck in the classic ""Duck Season, Rabbit Season feature...or read the huge ACME boxes delivered to the Coyote in the Road Runner Cartoons but they did offer my Uncle and I some quality time before he passed and offer the sane good times for my Grandson and Granddaughter when we watch their favorites together.  Maters Tall Tales are great any way you slice it but as a warning to parents...while you may tire of the child's favorites, this is the prime time to bond with the child.  Remember that you were once that age.",1378512000,,1024,4.269430051813472

4321463,5,B004C03THU,"This one is his favorite. We try to limit his TV time, but when he has the opportunity to watch something, this one is his first choice 80% of the time. All the stories are similar. Almost the same story line, just different costumes. But that makes it easy to follow and understand. He just loves Mader.",1377561600,,304,4.350877192982456
4321464,4,B004C03THU,"My son watched this over and over when we checked it from the library, and I was afraid that the moment I bought it he would somehow be burned out on this but not the case!

4321468,4,B004C03THU,I ordered this for our son`s 3 yr old birthday. I think there are 6 short clips and he really enjoys watching each of the clips. They are classic Mater and Mcqueen comedy.,1373414400,,171,4.212121212121212
4321469,5,B004C03THU,"Our 2 year old nephew will be in show business, of that we are certain!  He loves these cartoon books and DVDs, having them read to him or watching them over and over again, until he has memorized them.  Then he spends his time assigning each of us a character that he interacts with (I've been Mater), he is always McQueen.  Fun DVD.  I love how easy it is to discover and send through Amazon.  That's what makes this a 5 star rating!",1373328000,,435,4.192771084337349

4321473,5,B004C03THU,"This brief DVD is my son's favorite movie right now.  It has short clips of Mater as a hero in various story situations and his best friend, Lightening McQueen, being a part of the story as well.  For anyone who likes Cars and Cars 2 this is a must see.",1371945600,,253,4.04

4321475,5,B004C03THU,"My son loves this DVD, even better than some of the movies.  It is only 45 min or so long, but that is nice if you don't want to have them watch a full length movie.  Stories have the same good humor of Cars 1.  If your kids like Tow Mater it is a great DVD to own.",1371340800,,265,3.5344827586206895

4321479,3,B004C03THU,"I subtracted stars because for the price you would expect more.  The tales last all of about 30 minutes or so and the rest of stuff is pretty much boring 'behind the scenes' and the 'making of' stuff that kids don't really care about.  The tales are cute, but I feel kind of cheated.",1367366400,,283,4.222222222222222

4321489,5,B004C03THU,"My son, 2 1/2 yrs old, cannot get enough of this movie. It's actually really cute - Mater is just so dang endearing. Granted, the voice for McQueen isn't the same as the CARS movies, but it's pretty darn close.

My 5 1/2 year old daughter actually loves this movie too. Got it at Christmas and I'm fairly certain it has been played no less than 20 times.",1360108800,,354,4.205882352941177

4321491,4,B004C03THU,"Disney, and by extension Pixar, have established the practice of following up successful films with direct to video sequels and spin-offs.  Probably the most famous example recently is Mater's Tall Tales, which came out between the first and second Cars films.  Comprised of several short episodes, they have Mater in the lead role with Lightning McQueen in a supporting role.  The episodes cast Mater as the hero, often times saving the life of Lightning McQueen.  They range from Mater being a fire truck, to a monster truck, to a stunt car, to even being a bull-fighter, except fighting tractors instead of bulls.  Each episode is stand-alone, and all are equally good.  Overall, a great viewing for the whole family.",1359244800,,720,5.008403361344538

This ""movie"" was about 35 minutes long. Here is the plot (WARNING: SPOILERS...in addition to the one on the racecar).

Larry the Cable Truck: ""This one time, I was a monster truck!""
(flashback)
Lightning McWhatever: ""I don't believe you.""
Larry the Cable Truck: ""You should remember! You was there, too!""
(character from flashback appears in modern day to confirm story)

Repeat the above portion 6 times, replacing ""monster truck"" with ""daredevil, abducted by aliens, bullfighter, Japanese street racer, firetruck, and astronaut.""

Plus, the extras are very entertaining, too. They are done in a documentary style, of course, but my little guy will watch them with just as much attention as the features. He and I both especially enjoy the storyboards for the ideas that didn't make it past the drawing board. They are just as fun as the finished cartoons!",1338768000,,693,4.290076335877862

I was very impressed by the quality of the animation (to my eyes, it is the same as the two Cars ""feature"" films). I was even more impressed by the way in which the animators described how the different short features came to be. They even showed some animated drawings for a few of the ones left on the cutting room floor. I can't even imagine how many ""person hours"" must have gone into each short ""tall tale."" My favorite was ""Mater the Greater."" The audio that accompanies everything Pixar does truly brings everything to life.

I would recommend this DVD for kids over 8 years of age (though I would say that the content is really suited more for older kids and adults).",1337040000,,738,4.386861313868613

Someone earlier complained that it's only less than 40 minutes, but for my needs, that's perfect. We don't want littleman vegging on the couch forever.

When I first watched this with my son, it seemed way too loud and frenetic for my tastes.  I felt like we were both going to get ADD if we watched it more than once.  On repeat viewings, the more familiar I became with the stories, the more I enjoyed them, and I came to the realization that they need to pack a lot into each one because they only have a few minutes to tell each story.

In addition to the toons, there are also several short documentaries with the Pixar creators discussing some of the ideas behind the shorts, the movies and the characters.  They are all interesting, and the one involving the creation of Mater's character is particularly touching.

My 4-yr-old has watched this several times already.  I think he enjoys the short bursts of Mater and the Cars universe when he's not in the mood for watching one of the entire movies.  My 2-yr-old is just starting to get interested in Cars as well, so I'm sure we've still got lots of miles left on this DVD.",1324598400,,1212,4.370535714285714
4321538,5,B004C03THU,"Mater's Tall Tales is a really well-done dvd by Pixar. Often, most straight-do-dvd followup dvd's are rather low quality when compared to the original source movie, but Mater's Tall Tales is up to Pixar's standards (which is to say, quite good). Animation is top-notch, and Pixar adds its little touches (like scene details, facial expressions, appropriate subtle sound bits) that make it great. My 2 year-old son really enjoys it (we watch it about every other day, so it's gotten quite a bit of screentime).

The only thing that could make it better was if it was longer (as other reviews mention, it's only about 40 min long for the main lineup of tales, and includes a few other unfinished tales in the Extras section). That said, the quality of the product makes up for the lack of length.",1321574400,,794,4.712230215827338

I was disappointed to find out that it's only 34 minutes of cartoons.  The animation is spectacular, the stories are very creative, and everything is PIXAR level.  However, it's a tad short.

When I first played it, I couldn't believe the total playing time, chopping off the front stuff and the credits, is just a little over 34 minutes -- not counting the episode titles themselves. If you pay the Amazon price, that's 50 cents per minute. To add insult to injury, most of the stories are pretty dumb, and the whole animation is too flashy and fast-paced for kids under the age 9 or 10.  Larry the Cable Guy does a fine job voicing Mater, but the stories themselvers are just disappointingly silly (not the kind of fun silly Cars 2 is).

It's nice that it's several short stories (versus a long movie) so that he can finish a tall tale in a short car ride.  I just wish there were more stories for him!  Also, one of the tall tales has a song by Mater that repeats ""Dadgum!"" over and over.  Not sure if I want my son learning to say ""Dadgum"" repeatedly in song.",1314230400,,600,4.129310344827586

My biggest gripe is that this is $20 on a 30 minute show. I'd give it 4 stars easily if this were <$13, but $20 for a half-hour is unreasonable. The total run time of over an hour includes a ton of  ""making of"" type documentaries. Not the stuff my 3 kids 5-years-old and under enjoy watching. Which brings me to my second gripe...

I cannot, for the life of me, figure out how to easily restart the CARTOONS in my car's DVD player. Once the documentaries start, it will only back up to the chapter beginning the docs. There is also no easy way to get back to the first chapter. Returning to the main menu and selecting ""Play All"" resumes the documentaries. So you cannot back up, cannot start over. What the heck?! Rather than trying to select a specific chapter from the sub-menu (and distracting ourselves from the road even longer), we end up ejecting the stupid DVD and re-loading it.

4321549,5,B004C03THU,"This entertaining (albeit short) series of vignettes continues the saga of Disney's delightful movie, Cars.  The tales focus on Mater's backstory.  The stories are so fantastic, they couldn't be true... or, could they?  Each of Mater's Tall Tales leaves that question enjoyably open ended, a humorous twist that won't be lost on the kids.

With big studio movie production quality from every facet (writing, animation, sound, voice acting) this feels like an extension of the original film in every way.  Larry the Cable Guy reprises his role as Mater and Keith Ferguson steps into the role of Lightning McQueen.  Don't worry that Owen Wilson didn't return (for whatever reason).  You (and more importantly your kids) won't miss him.  Ferguson's Lightning is nearly flawless and you probably wouldn't have noticed if you hadn't read the credits (or this review).  The only reason I wouldn't give this DVD an ""A+"" for grade is that it clocks in at a very spritely 38 minutes.  It'll leave you wishing it went on for twice as long, but that's ultimately a reflection of it's high production quality.

Is this DVD short on content? Yes. But the price is worth it to me to have all the shorts in one place. And the quality is excellent. Even though Owen Wilson is absent from these shorts, the replacement voice actor does a great Lightning McQueen and there honestly isn't much of a difference. My toddler son is obsessed with Mater and Cars, and all these shorts are adorable. I will say, however, that he finds one of the two new Tall Tales - Mater Private Eye - a little scary. It's also in black & white, which little kids don't really appreciate, although I did like the film noir touch.

4321572,3,B004C03THU,"Gotten this DVD for my son as we just brought a blu-ray DVD player.
True to blu-ray, the picture is very clear and if you have surround sound, you can forget about going to the movie theater. This is better !
This DVD comprises a series a of 3-4min slots of short stories.  Quite nice as there is a variety.
But some of it may be a bit too violent for children under 5.  Especially the wrestling part.
What is disappointing is that for a near $21 DVD sold online, it is less 60mins in total.  Not long enough to keep a child quiet.
The package comes in 2 disc, one blu-ray and one standard player.  No one really need 2 discs of the same movie. it is just an excuse to price at $21. To me, it is just one movie of less than 60min and it is really pricey.",1293580800,,754,3.9735099337748343

It contains 12 different short tales and was very engaging for my 3-year old son.  He loves it and Amazon sold it at a remarkable price!!!,1291075200,,260,4.48936170212766
4321582,2,B004C03THU,"Sorely disappointed in this. Picked it up (at Wal-Mart) because my young son loves CARS and I thought it would be nice to indulge his CARS-fix without having to pop in the actual movie every time.  Unfortunately, the jacket doesn't really convey just how little content there actually is here.  Maybe because... I don't know... I paid a standard, feature-length Blu-ray price for it, I expected more than 40 minutes of (*highly* repetitive) material. (Yeah, it's got some bonus material. So does every Blu-ray. Bonus material don't cut it with a three-year-old.)

C'mon, Disney: The least you could do is price this where it belongs, around $10 or $12.  It's sub-par material: No Owen Wilson -- which really grates after a while since Lightning is in every short -- and the other characters hardly register. Most important verdict would be from my son, who LOVES (LOVES LOVES LOVES) CARS -- and seemed thoroughly unmoved by one Tall Tale after another.

One additional word of caution: I have a first-generation Blu-ray player, and the menu for this one simply will not load (I resorted to watching the DVD version before writing my review above).  With the latest firmware on the player, I can't recall the last time a disc wouldn't play for me.  But something about the menu on this one won't play nice with my player. So now I've got a crappy, overpriced Blu-ray which I can neither take back (an opened Blu-ray? Nope.) nor play. Ugh.",1290988800,6,1437,4.793522267206478

4321585,4,B004C03THU,"The tall (or short) tales are all very entertaining. However if you have Disney channel, then you can record and view all but two of the short tales from your DVR. HD quality is same caliber as the movie itself and that's a plus.

If you don't have Disney channel or no DVR to record them all in one place, this is may be worth it. For those with kids that have seen all but the two new ones, it's questionable value. The added DVD is a bonus for those that have something like a car DVD player that can keep kids quiet for another 40 minutes...

If you feel helpless buying this because of your kids, then might as well as sign up for Disney reward points website and get 4 more retail priced blu-ray/DVD combos to get the Sony blu-ray player for $59 before end of January 2011.",1290470400,2,779,4.1866666666666665

4321588,5,B004C03THU,"The detail of this DVD has been covered quite splendidly by previous reviewers; I really just want to add my 'aye' to the 4 and 5 star count, and to comment on the cost of the DVD, since a couple of people have mentioned it. I think that there are some movies out there that you pay a ridiculous amount for, as well as getting nailed for all the franchise stuff (cough, cough ""Princess and the Frog""), and you walk away from the experience feeling as though you've been taken... this isn't one of them. Maybe it's because, as noted, it is a handful of short cartoons, but each one feels finished, and there's no ""What, that's it?"" at the end of the disc, which our household has suffered through with ""Frog"", ""Marmarduke"", even as far back as ""Chicken Little"". And don't even get me started on ""Furry Vengeance""! And so, yes, it's short, if you want to get technical, but the quality of the product is absolutely great (Mater is my son's favorite CARS character, and so I buy alot of stuff having to do with the drawlin' haulin' guy), and I'd pay this same amount again for whatever the franchise has coming up next. Wait, am I supposed to admit that???",1289692800,15,1153,4.417840375586854
4321589,3,B004C03THU,"November 2nd was overshadowed by a Pixar DVD/ BluRay release, perhaps you've heard of it: Toy Story 3?  However, while TS3 was wooing fans, another beloved Pixar/ Disney collaboration franchise received a bit of an unofficial sequel of sorts that quietly snuck on the scene.  That franchise was 2006's Cars and this release (despite a name that insinuates an official sequel) is actually a collection of animated shorts that have aired on the Disney channel featuring the antics of the beloved tow truck Mater.  Side note: the real sequel, Cars 2, is scheduled for a summer 2011 release.

Cars Toons consists of 9 shorts, each of which that follows the same tall tale formula: Mater narrates an unbelievable story of something he has done in the past to a skeptical Lightening McQueen.

In the story, Mater finds himself in a near inescapable predicament at which point McQueen, at his fill of the unbelievability, interjects to question Mater as to whether the events in the story actually occurred.

Mater then responds that McQueen ought to remember since he was there as well and the story resumes to suddenly include McQueen's participation (usually as the victim in need of Mater's assistance).

The story then ends back in Radiator Springs with Mater and McQueen parting, often followed by characters or references to the story that was just told, suggesting that the outrageous story might in fact have been true.

In short, the formula works! Often times the situations presented, in their brilliant silliness, are nearly as comical as the dialog itself (which is pretty darn hilarious).  It turns out the friendly tow truck has been involved in everything from a moon mission to sleuthing in a black and white noir film, from UFO encounters to drifting in the neon-lit streets of Tokyo.

Despite including 2 never-before-seen shorts for this DVD collection, the runtime of the feature comes in at a very disappointing 38 minutes.  Yes there is nearly an hour of special features including interviews with some of the real-life characters that is Pixar (and even some witty exchanges with Mater's voice: Larry the Cable Guy).

The biggest complaint about the ultra-short runtime however stems from the fact that Disney feels entitled to charge full feature film price for this collection. Couple this to the fact that many retailers are incorrectly listing the run-time as 91 minutes (which is in fact the grand total including the special features rather than the feature itself) and the formula for disappointment is solidified.

The animation is easily on par with that of the first Cars film and the vocal work is equally stellar (Keith Ferguson doing a very serviceable Owen Wilson impression for the voice of McQueen and Larry the Cable Guy returning to reprise his role as Mater).

In all this is a terribly funny little collection of classic shorts.  The only thing keeping it from earning a 4.5 star rating that the material itself deserves is the reality that an anemic runtime should, at the very least, be priced accordingly.  One really gets the impression that ""the Diz"" is doing all they can to milk the franchise in this instance as surely these shorts could have been included as a special edition re-release of the first Cars or even as a very enticing bonus for viewers who preordered the upcoming Cars 2 (or something to that effect).

As it stands, wonderfully charming material that's sure to dazzle viewers of all ages.. just too little of it for the price.",1289520000,5,3489,4.936752136752137

I give the Tall Tales themselves FIVE STARS. But for Pixar/Disney to price so little content at $29.99 is ridiculous. Even at $19.99 it is too much.

Just look at all you get on the Cars blu-ray, that is pretty good value.

There must have been more stuff in the Pixar vaults that they could have paired this with.

He now once again plays with his Cars all the time, which makes me feel better considering the money we spent on all of it. It is a great selection of 9 of Mater's Tall Tales, along with some additional bonus information (that he rarely watches).  So I was a little concerned at the price for 9 Tall Tales, approx 45 min of running time, but considering he has watched it 11 times in the last 3 days (12 as I'm typing), I'd say it was more that worth it.
