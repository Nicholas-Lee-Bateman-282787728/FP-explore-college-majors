7975646,1,B00007ELLK,"This was not something to work out with, but an instructional video to gain information from for when you are ready to begin lifting. It did not work at all for me, I want something that I can lift weights to at the same time that I am getting instruction. I want a good workout when I'm done. I have been working with P90X and love the muscle fatigue that comes with it, but would like some diversity.",1271116800,3,402,4.166666666666667
7975647,5,B00007ELLK,"This is an easy step by step instruction on how to use the weights at the gym for those of us who need it. I received better instruction from this DVD than I have ever received from any trainer thousands of dollars later.
The explanations and demos are clear and easy to understand. You can work at at your own pace at home or in the gym. This is complete with a tour of the equipment. I highly recommend this. The routines are concise.",1242000000,4,436,4.2023809523809526
7975648,4,B00007ELLK,"This a very informative video.  Jake walks you through each procedure and lets you know which muscle is being worked and shows you the proper lifting technique.  There are no jerky moves.  I'd always wanted to use my workbench and weight bar, but was scared I'd use it improperly and do more damage then good.  This tape has definitely been a great help.  I enjoy working out in my home gym and most of his tapes/DVD's have a program to follow along with.  This one doesn't.  It shows how to perform a procedure and do a few reps, to get you started, and then moves on to the next and then the next which is nice, but I would have liked it better if he'd have designed it, as with his other workout programs, with a certain # of reps for each procedure.  Instead, I watch the procedure, pause it, do my reps, and then unpause it and go to the next and so on.  (Tht is the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5)...But, all in all, it's a nice starter video for getting into weight lifting.",1075161600,10,988,4.157894736842105
