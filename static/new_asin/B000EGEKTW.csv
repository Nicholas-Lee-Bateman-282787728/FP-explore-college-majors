8109247,3,B000EGEKTW,This was a fun dance video. However it took me awhile to realize what it was missing......The music. The music was ok but did not make me want to dance.,1301270400,,152,4.1
8109248,5,B000EGEKTW,"It's AWESOME! It is ADVANCED. Not at all for beginners. I even gave it a try...wow-hard work! However, if you want a challenge, to learn something new and burn calories this is great.
If you have some beginner hiphop training, this is a great next step.
My tween daughter loves it! I hope Jermaine makes another one ;-)",1286064000,,319,4.517241379310345
8109249,5,B000EGEKTW,"I love Mr. Browne's style.  His moves are fluid and sexy, not at all resemble music videos you see on TV.

The style of teaching is like taking an intermediate/advance hip hop class.  Mr. Browne won't break it down to minute detail because he expects you to know the basics.

I love that it's done in a dance class format, meaning he'd teach a few moves and then ""go from the top"".  The learning is accumulative.  By the end of the teaching you'd be going over the whole routine a dozen times.

All three routines are quite different in overall looks but share similarities in small details (like a lot of pop and lock and execution between counts).

Again, if you are new to dance or hip hop, this is not for you.  Community college classes will be better for your investment.",1248048000,2,777,4.415492957746479
8109250,4,B000EGEKTW,"I like to just add this isn't for the beginner who's into dancing for fun once in a while or who takes while to learn.
Jermaine has GREAT talent & so do the 2 back up guys. The use of mirrors & the camera to the side/behind the Jermaine is GREAT, I wish all dance dvds did that. But there is mostly only counting. So if you have trouble learning, this may be too advanced for you. You should already have fluidity in your moves, etc. I am among the ones who have trouble keeping up & got frustrated, but it doesn't mean I think this product doesn't have a lot to offer.
As another said, just look up this title on youtube & a great trailer can be found to see the awesome talent.",1191369600,5,679,4.037037037037037
8109251,5,B000EGEKTW,"It's a 60 minute video with 3 dance routines 20 minutes each. No wasting of time, he goes to teach you the routines immediately after a brief introduction. No complain at all about his teaching style. Nice flashy moves(there should be a trailer in youtube). Since all the moves are broken down nicely, it is recommended for beginners too. Worth buying.

Let me tell you what you won't learn: It doesn't specifically focus on specialized techniques involved in, for example, popping and locking and breakdancing. It's more a dance routine video. Delivers what it claims.",1187049600,7,569,4.989473684210527
8109252,5,B000EGEKTW,"This is my favorite dance instruction video so far. Jermaine is a great dancer and a very good teacher. He choreographed some flashy moves worthy of Michael Jackson.

Perfecting the routines in this video will take time but will make many better dancers.",1153958400,8,254,4.906976744186046
