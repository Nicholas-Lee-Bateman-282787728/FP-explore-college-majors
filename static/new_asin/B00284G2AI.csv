8355687,3,B00284G2AI,Not at all what I expected. Richard Roxburgh played his part as well as always but was let down by the rest of the cast and the story. Disappointing.,1358380800,,149,4.172413793103448
8355688,3,B00284G2AI,"NO SPOILERS:

First and foremost, I am a fan of Roxburgh (East of Everything et al).  Combined with the 1-very positive review and the less than $4 price on Amazon, I took a chance.  .

Because there is an insufficient synopsis:

Roxburgh is a Detective Sergeant in Homicide who is on administrative duties pending a psyche evaluation due to an ""incident"" from a recent case.  He is assigned as a curator of sorts in the Police Museum, charged with pulling together old crime scene photos for an upcoming exhibition.
He is cohabitating with another Homicide Detective (female), likes to on occasion ""burn one up"" and finds himself attracted to his new ""high strung"" Irish Police Therapist.
He finds himself intrigued by a female in one of the photographs and pulls the ""cold case"" file, which sets off a chain of events.

As referenced in my title, the premise was good.  Unfortunately, I found the pacing to be un-agonizingly slow and the action to be little and far between.  Given that this is not meant to be an adrenaline fueled shoot-em-up police drama, I found myself dozing off.  My friend thought it was above average with enough twists to keep it interesting.  Perhaps, I should have watched while drinking a latte.",1341619200,2,1225,4.785714285714286
8355689,5,B00284G2AI,"This Australian movie starts off as a crime story, but halfway through turns into quite a different film.
Highly enjoyable with strong performances from all the cast.  The ending is about as moving as it gets.
Probably would not get made it Hollywood. Definitely, something different.  Full of refreshing surprises.",1276387200,5,315,5.28
