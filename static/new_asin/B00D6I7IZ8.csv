8590004,5,B00D6I7IZ8,"These ""from the air"" series of videos are fantastic for their excellent photography. They either used a very slow plane or a helicopter to get thees shots. From a ""travel"" point of view these videos show the best tourist attractions and the beauty of the country. I highly recommend these videos. Some can be previewed on your local PBS channel or Travel channel..(National Geographic, Discovery, etc)......",1372896000,,407,5.181818181818182
