Given the age of these films, the video quality and the sound are quite good and as I have said before, it is nicely packaged.  This set would probably be ideal for a casual fan of these artists of perhaps someone who is not too familiar with these comedians .

Because of the easy availability of these films I am rating this box set a solid three stars, fun to watch but nothing essential.",1273622400,3,6328,4.821994408201305
