8763352,3,B01GQWUDCK,"The price was the best part, but I wish it was a little more lively & appealing.  Some good balance points, but better for someone more inactive & in their 80's rather than an active 66 year old.",1523836800,,195,4.131578947368421
8763353,1,B01GQWUDCK,"I was very disappointed in this dvd. I'm always looking for new exercise videos to use for my senior exercise group. I carefully read the entire description and all the reviews, trying to find out exactly what kind of exercise is on the dvd, what equipment is needed, exactly how long the actual exercise portion runs, and whether it includes floor exercises. I need an exercise period not to exceed 40 minutes,with no floor exercises.
Nowhere in the description on the site, or on the dvd case, indicated this exercise program requires a mat and includes floor exercises. When I opened the packaging and plugged in the dvd, I was informed on my screen that I would need a mat. Towards the beginning, the mat is used while standing, so I had hope, Halfway through, however, we were instructed to get on the floor. Oops. I cannot use this dvd at all--ever! And now the packaging is removed, so I don't think I can return it.
Actually, this exercise program seems to be geared toward the very elderly, It's very, very slow, and the people in my senior group expect something more lively.",1520899200,,1085,4.626943005181347
