8078389,5,B000AFENNA,"Certainly, this incredible documentary clearly shows that this conflict (1945-1975) was one of the most bitter wars of the century. The war brought in millions of soldiers, i.e. Vietnamese, Koreans, Australians, British, American, French, Thai, Filipino and Chinese-and maimed and killed uncounted millions of civilians. In retelling the story of the French defeat at Dien Bien Phu, this movie clearly shows that 20 years before any American ever set foot in Vietnam, the seeds for American involvement had been sown. After W.W. II the U.S. perceived Soviet expansion as the world's greatest threat.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hell-In-A-Very-Small-Place-The-Siege-Of-Dien-Bien-Phu/dp/030681157X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hell In A Very Small Place: The Siege Of Dien Bien Phu</a>&nbsp;In October, 1944, Mao Se Tung declared the start of the ""People's Republic of China"" and the battle lines were drawn. To American strategists, the Communist victory in China fueled the fear of Soviet and Communist expansion. At stake were the economic interests throughout the Pacific, and U.S. communication and trade links to the Indian Ocean. Then President Dwight Eisenhower (Ike) believed one Asian country falling to Communism would bring down it's neighbors in a ""Domino Effect"". Soviet and Chinese power would expand southwards until even the Australian continent was threatened.

""Indo China"" seemed to hold the key to the future of S.E. Asia. The region bordered the newly created ""P.R.C."" (People's Rep. of China) and was still a French colony. French strategy was to hold onto power by creating ""puppet states"" in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. The biggest obstacle to the French plan was the ""Viet Minh"", a Vietnamese independent movement headed by Ho Chi Minh. In Sept., 1945 under Minh, the Viet Minh took Hanoi in the North from the Japanese forces and declared independence for the ""Democratic Republic of Vietnam.""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vietnam-1945-The-Quest-for-Power-A-Philip-E-Lilienthal-Book/dp/0520212282/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vietnam 1945: The Quest  for Power (A Philip E. Lilienthal Book)</a>&nbsp;In the South of Vietnam, the Japanese surrendered to the British after the atomic bombings of the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the Japanese surrender. However, France, newly liberated from Nazi rule and shedding it's ""Vichy Government"" subordinate to Adolf Hitler, still considered Vietnam her colony. Let's explore the exact order of what happened, as the following sequence actually caused what was known as the ""First Indochina War.""

During the Potsdam Conference in July 1945, the Allies had agreed on Great Britain taking control of Vietnam south of the 16th parallel,  then part of French Indochina  from the Japanese occupiers. French Indochina was a French Imperialistic term that  encompassed their colonial empire in Southeast Asia.  It consisted of  three Vietnamese regions, ""Tonkin"" in the north,  Annam in the Central, and  Cochinchina  in the south. Included in this empire was Laos as well as Cambodia, formed in 1887. Clearly, the ""Potsdam Conference"" paved the way for much of the future conflict that later occurred.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Replacing-France-The-Origins-of-American-Intervention-in-Vietnam/dp/0813193303/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Replacing France: The Origins of American Intervention in Vietnam</a>&nbsp;The  conference  was held actually  in Potsdam, occupied Germany, from 16th to July to  August 2, 1945. The Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the U.S. were the participants. Representing them were the Communist Party General Secretary Joseph Stalin, Prime Ministers Winston Churchill[2] and, later, Clement Attlee, and President Harry S. Truman.  The purpose of this conference was to decide how to administer punishment to the defeated Nazi Germany, which had agreed to an unconditional surrender  on May 8th. This was called ""V-E Day.""  Decided upon were the establishment of post-war order, peace treaties issues, and countering the effects of war.

Upon the conclusion of hostilities from the Second World War,  Ho Chi Minh, the future leader of the Communist Party ""Viet Minh,""  proclaimed Vietnamese independence from French rule.  Anti-French demonstrations were held in Saigon, and the Allies became nervous. The British commander, General Sir Douglas David Gracey,  arrived in Saigon in September 1945.  to assist in restoring order and ensuring French subjugation. Gracey led 20,000 troops from India to S.E. Asia  with the purpose of militarily occupying Saigon. Thereafter, France persuaded Gracey's Commander in Chief, Lord Mountbatten to authorize Gracey to declare martial law.  Succeeding in accomplishing this, as well as simultaneously fearing a communist takeover of Vietnam, Gracey decided to rearm any French citizens who had remained in Saigon during W.W. II.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Churchill-America-and-Vietnam-1941-45/dp/0230298214/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Churchill, America and Vietnam, 1941-45</a>&nbsp;He also allowed them to seize control of all public buildings from the Viet Minh.  Japanese involvement can be traced to the situation at the end of W.W. II. The U.S., with Truman's approval, dropped an atomic bomb on the people of Hiroshima, Japan on Aug. 6 and one on Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945.  On August 15, the Japanese emperor Hirohito, realizing the hopelessness of the situation, addressed his people on radio and called upon his forces to lay down their weapons. On September 2, Japan signed the instrument of surrender on board the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay. Three days later, Allied forces .reoccupied Singapore,a Japanese enclave.

On September 12, 1945, Lord Mountbatten accepted the surrender of 680,000 Japanese soldiers in South East Asia. This massive Japanese force was still there in. October of 1945, as fighting spread throughout Saigon. General Gracey decided to use this force to help restore order in the city and issued guns to them all.  This controversial decision antagonized  Ho Chi Minh and made him more determined than ever to liberate Vietnam from foreigners' rule. This precipitated the First Indochina War which was destined to culminate at Dien Bien Phu.  Arriving in Saigon in October 1945 to assume authority was French General Leclerc  By June of 1946, sufficient French troops arrived in Vietnam to allow General Gracey to return with his troops to India where his Division eventually was disbanded. This is how the first French-Indo China war began.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ho-Chi-Minh-A-Life/dp/078688701X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ho Chi Minh: A Life</a>&nbsp;In the beginning of the war between the French and the Viet Minh, the U.S. stayed neutral. U.S. officials had originally supported Ho Chi Minh and the Viet Minh and strongly opposed the French attempt to keep it's old colony. However, this was before the Chinese Civil War and the rise of Communist China.

This was a civil war fought between the Kuomintang Chinese Nationalist Party led by Chiang Kai-shek (known as the acronym ""KMT"")  and the Communist Party of China (CPC), led by Mao Tse-tung.  The stakes were the control of China which eventually led to China's division into two: the  Republic of China, now commonly known as Taiwan, and the People's Republic of China on the mainland of China. The war began in April 1927, and ended in 1949.. The U.S. strongly supported the KMT, with over 150,000 Marines being sent to China guard strategic sites, and both equipping  and training over 500,000 KMT troops. Furthermore, the U.S. transported KMT forces to occupy newly liberated Chinese zones, as well as to contain Communist controlled areas. To this day, since no armistice or peace treaty has ever been signed, there is controversy as to whether the Civil War has legally ended. Nevertheless,  Ho Chi Minh watched all of these events, becoming increasingly galvanized against foreign interference.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Valley-of-Death-The-Tragedy-at-Dien-Bien-Phu-That-Led-America-into-the-Vietnam-War/dp/1400066646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Valley of Death: The Tragedy at Dien Bien Phu That Led America into the Vietnam War</a>&nbsp;Now the fear was that if the Viet Minh beat the French, they would open the door to the Chinese and Soviets. The ""Cold War"" had come to Vietnam. The Soviets and Red Chinese recognized the Viet Minh as the ""only legitimate government of Vietnam"" in Jan. 1950.

Red China was giving Ho ammunition, arms and training bases. The U.S. recognized a ""French Creation"" i.e. ""The State of Vietnam."" President Harry Truman approved a program of economic and military help. However, the situation changed dramatically by the outbreak in June, 1950 of the ""Korean War."" Communist Korean Northern forces, backed by Red China and the Soviet Union, invaded South Korea and the U.S. sent troops to intervene. By Oct. 1950 American forces were locked in major battles on the Korean battlefield. Now, the need to contain China existed on every possible front, including Vietnam.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Disaster-in-Korea-The-Chinese-Confront-MacArthur-Williams-Ford-Texas-A-M-University-Military-History-Series/dp/160344128X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Disaster in Korea: The Chinese Confront MacArthur (Williams-Ford Texas A&M University Military History Series)</a>&nbsp;This included a massive U.S. backing for the French in Vietnam. By 1953, one year into the presidency of Eisenhower, U.S. support for the French war against the Viet Minh had turned into a flood of ""Cash and Arms"". The U.S. paid 75% of the cost of the war (1 billion in 1954). Even with colossal U.S. aid, the French were failing to defeat the Viet Minh. Ho's troops now numbered 120,000 hard core troops backed by 200,000 local fighters.

As French casualties passed 50,000, anti-war protests in France were widespread. There were calls for French negotiations with the Viet Minh. Pressure to end the French Indo Chinese war increased in 1953 as the U.S. Korean War ended. However, in the U.S. ""Eisenhower"" and his Vice President ""Richard Nixon"" were dead set against the French compromising with Ho Chi Minh. In spite of U.S. opposition, compromise in Indochina between France and the Viet Minh seemed inevitable. France's hope was that she would win a major battlefield victory and thus strengthen her hand at any peace talks. However, vast tracts of land in Vietnam had fallen under Viet Minh control. In Northern Vietnam the only French enclave was in Hanoi. Most of Laos and Western Vietnam belonged to the Communists. The French plan was to create at Dien Bien Phu, deep in hostile territory a fortified base that would threaten the enemies supply lines to Laos. Also, the fort at Dien Bien Phu might act as ""bait"" to induce the Viet Minh to attack with their best troops. France thought incorrectly that the base could be exclusively resupplied from Hanoi by air.

In November, 1953 the Viet Minh 316th Division advanced towards Laos just as the French expected. On Nov. 20th, 800 elite French paratroopers and a battalion of the French Foreign Legion descended by air on Dien Bien Phu.  The Viet Minh reacted by bringing 5 more divisions on the now encircled French camp. The French quickly set up an airstrip and fortifications at Dien Bien Phu. The idea was to mount offensive sweeps into the surrounding area. However, the French were trapped, encircled, and it became suicidal to venture outside. An excellent account of this, albeit hard to find, can be found in Paul Grauwin's ""Doctor At Dienbienphu."" Within 2 months, the Viet Minh pulled ""the noose"" so tight that an extraction from Dien Bien Phu became impossible. The commander,  Colonel Christian de Castries was completely confident that the French could ""break out"" of Dien Bien Phu. He was wrong.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DOCTOR-AT-DIEN-BIEN-PHU/dp/B0000CJ9AH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DOCTOR AT DIEN-BIEN-PHU</a>&nbsp;He incorrectly assumed that aircraft could resupply all the French bases needs. De Castries also wrongly thought enemy artillery posed any real danger. He underestimated the Viet Minh anti- aircraft fire and incorrectly guessed that only a ""hand full"" of Viet Minh could deploy in the hilly terrain surrounding the encircled base.

De Castries also thought that French air power could destroy any reinforcements to the Viet Minh. Just like the massive U.S. B-52 bombing on the Ho Chi Minh trail during the U.S. war , over 1200 French daily sorties on Viet Minh supply routes had little effect on the Communists reinforcing their own troops. Too often, aircraft were grounded by the weather. Also, the Viet Minh were masters of camouflage, and deployed huge numbers of ""ack-ack"" (anti-aircraft guns). There the Viet Minh commander, General Nguyen Van Giap, used 5000 support troops to deploy more than 200 artillery pieces, anti-aircraft guns and a vast supply of ammunition around Dien Bien Phu. It was one of the most extraordinary feats of logistics in military history. To the 10,000 French trapped inside the base, the realization that they were surrounded by field guns, mortars and Soviet rocket systems came as a dreadful shock. The French base was sited on a flat valley floor.

The airstrip and headquarters were the focus for the main battle position. A complex of 5 strongholds code named ""Francoise"", ""Hugette"", ""Claudine"", ""Elaine"" and ""Dominique"" were set up. To break up attacks, strong points on ""Anne Maire"", ""Gabrielle"", ""Beatrice"" and ""Isabelle"" had been created on a series of low hills. The base was manned by 9 infantry battalions and 2 ""crack"" parachute battalions. For French support, there were French artillery and mortars by tanks and fighter bombers. By March, 1954, 49,000 Viet Minh had been deployed around Dien Bien Phu, with heavy mortars encircling Bien Dien Phu on all sides. Anti aircraft guns were secretly placed to cover the French air routes in and out of the valley. As the weeks went on, Viet Minh artillery fire caused more and more casualties amongst the French at Dien Bien Phu. The fortifications had never been meant to withstand heavy artillery, and the French were horrified to find that neither counter battery fire nor air strikes were able to silence the enemy guns.

They were too well dug in to ""hillside caves"" and bunkers and too well camouflaged. Any day the French knew they would face an ""all out"" attack. It came on March 13, 1954. The Viet Minh assault began with a massive artillery bombardment. French gun positions in the main area were destroyed. In three days after repeated ""human wave"" assaults and hopeless French counterattacks, the Viet Minh took the northern strong points of ""Gabrielle, Beatrice and Anne Marie"" resulting in over 1,500 French killed and 7000 Viet Minh casualties. The Viet Minh proved the French defenses could be overcome. The airbase at Dien Bien Phu was closed down for good. The French had to rely on parachute drop only for supply and reinforcement (similarly to the U.S. and their situation during the siege at Khe Sanh during the January, 1968 Tet Offensive). After a two week hiatus, the Viet Minh renewed their offensive. The battle raged for 2 more weeks with the French contesting every foot of ground.

In the end, shocking Viet Minh casualties forced Viet Minh commander General Giap to pause. Meanwhile, the French situation was getting desperate. Ammunition and food were short, and 3000 wounded were trapped in the base in appalling conditions. With disaster looming on the battlefield, the French appealed to the U.S. for help. There was a plan to use American bombers, and even to drop 4 nuclear weapons, which was code named ""Operation Vulture."" President Eisenhower ruled out any military intervention unless other allies took part. None agreed to help. The French were left to their fate.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Angel-of-Dien-Bien-Phu-The-Lone-French-Woman-at-the-Decisive-Battle-for-Vietnam/dp/1591142067/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Angel of Dien Bien Phu: The Lone French Woman at the Decisive Battle for Vietnam</a>&nbsp;Meanwhile, the Viet Minh had adopted new techniques in an attempt to reduce their terrible casualties. They secretly dug more than 50 miles of trenches creeping right up to the French perimeter. The final Viet Minh assault came on the night of May 1, 1954. After a massive barrage, the Viet Minh infantry hit the remaining French bunkers of ""Huguette and Elaine"".

In spite of fierce French resistance, positions fell one by one until the evening of May 6th, 1954.  On that night, a huge mine demolished part of ""Elaine"" and it's last bunkers were overrun. On May 7th, 1954, at approximately 5:30 PM, Viet Minh forces occupied the French command post and the French commander ordered his troops to cease fire. It was 55 days to the minute since the battle had begun. Three thousand French troops had been killed and 8000 wounded. The Viet Minh had 8000 killed and 12,000 wounded.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DOCTOR-AT-DIEN-BIEN-PHU/dp/B0000CJ9AH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DOCTOR AT DIEN-BIEN-PHU</a>&nbsp;For General  Giap, the outcome had still been a triumph despite these casualties. It is too bad that America did not study the resolve of the North Vietnamese to win despite massive casualties or regardless of consequences. This was a lesson the U.S. would only learn with a wall of 60,000 names etched in stone in Washington.

8078390,4,B000AFENNA,"I think the ""Battlefield"" series about World War II and now Vietnam are among the most informative documentaries about those wars available. They concentrate on the hard strategic facts of the wars as seen by the commanders and political leaders at the top. I think the latest series about Vietnam is a fitting continuation of the various series about the Second World War and is generally of as good quality.

A good friend of mine who was active in the anti-Vietnam War movement in the United States watched the series with me and he said that it showed that many of the beliefs he and others who opposed the war were hollow myths. Primary among them was the idea that the war in Vietnam was a popular, people's uprising by an indigenous movement of South Vietnamese who weren't necessarily all Communists. The Viet Cong fighters were idealistic guerrillas who wore black pajamas and lived on a handful of rice per day.
Also among the myths were that all South Vietnamese leaders were incompetant, corrupt people who didn't care about the country, only in despoiling it, and that the ARVN (South Vietnamese Army) was a puppet force that couldn't fight.
Thirdly, there was the belief that this ""indegeneous guerrilla force"" succeeded in defeating the United States military.

This series shows that these things simply were either not true, or gross overgeneralizations. Firstly, the Communists who defeated South Vietnam in the end were not South Vietnamese Viet Cong guerrillas, but rather conventional North Vietnamese armed forces who were armed to the teeth with billions of dollars of Soviet and Chinese military equipment. The war was won in a conventional, Second World War-style with tanks, artillery and aircraft.
Secondly, there never was a popular uprising against the South Vietnames government. The one big attempt to create one, the Tet Offensive in January-February 1968 failed miserably.
Thirdly, the ARVN, although indeed having many structural problems that were never overcome, improved considerably over the years, and they were the one who contributed the most to the devasting defeat of the VC/NVA forces in the Tet Offensive, which caused heavy damage to the Viet Cong in particular. The ARVN had many fine, dedicated officers and outstanding units. However, as I said, there were numerous problems with the army and its relationship with the South Vietnames government that did contribute to the final defeat.
Fourthly, the United States military, while suffering significant losses, ended up succeeding, along with the ARVN in defeating the guerrilla forces, making the North Vietnamese come to the conclusion that only a conventional military force could bring victory.
Fifthly, the Communist forces, tough, dedicated fighters that they were, were not supermen. They suffered immense losses and had many deserters. Although it is common to point out the corruption of the South Vietnamese government and forces, corruption is no stranger to Communist regimes and this no doubt effected their side as well, although this is not talked about very much. However, the North Vietnamese worried about a collapse of moral, which led them to agreeing to joing peace talks with the US in 1968.
South Vietnam might have had a chance to survive if the United States had not sharply cut back aid following the peace agreement of 1973. All-in-all, the war was a terrible tragedy, and the losses the US and South Vietnam suffered seemd to be for nothing. The question is still open whether the US made a mistake in committing itself to the war in the first place. Ironically, the defeat of the US in South Vietnam led the USSR to start expanding military committments to anti-American forces around the world, in Afghanistan, Mozambique, Somalia, Ethiopia, Angola and other places, leading to civil wars in these places which the pro-Soviet forces were not able to win, leading the USSR to waste billions of dollars in these places...and it was this economic strain that contributed much to the eventual collapse of the USSR and Communist sytems. Today North Vietnam's top backer, the USSR no longer exists and they are begging for Americans to visit and invest in their country. So maybe the US did win the Vietnam War in the long run?

Having said the above, I think this particular episode which describes the French attempt to reassert control of Indochina after the Second World War leaves something to be desired.  Although the siege of Dien Bien Phu is described in detail, there is a lack of information about the context in which the battle took place. The program does not make clear what the overall French strategy was in fighting the Viet Minh and more of the political background about what the French were really trying to achieve there would have been very helpful.",1221091200,2,4795,5.042875157629256
