493953,5,6302641926,"Charles Denner plays a seemingly mild mannered engineer who has a fatal attraction to beautiful women.  The story begins by showing the length he will go to track down an elusive beauty, then spins a wonderful array of thoughts and observations on the nature of relationships as Bertrand tries to come to terms with his obsession.  This leads him to pen a book that more or less forms the backbone of the movie as he drifts back in time to chart some of his early relationships, including the Oedipal one with his mother.  However, the movie maintains a firm focus in the present, ultimately leading to an engaging relationship with his editor.  Along the way there is the playful banter between Bertrand and the operator who provides wake up calls each morning; an older woman who runs a lingerie shop at which Bertrand gazes at the new window displays; and a couple of relationships from the past which come back to haunt him.  Unlike the 1983 remake featuring Burt Reynolds, this movie doesn't devolve into middle age angst.  Bertrand is modest and relatively honest with himself, which is what ultimately wins over his editor.  The only problem is that Bertrand still has one woman that has managed to elude him leading to a fateful closing scene where he rushs headlong into traffic after the perfect pair of legs.",1082419200,19,1319,4.758771929824562
493954,5,6302641926,"""The Man Who Loved Women"" by Francois Truffaut is
the critically acclaimed film released in Europe
in 1977 that is a comedy/adult drama that teaches
quite an interesting lesson about men and women.
Specifically the obsession of sex and carnal
pleasure without the input of love, respect
and commitment.
Bertrand Morane (Charles Denner), is a man
who loves every woman he meets, literally.
You can basically call him a leech, and
sex addict, because he has never loved any
women he has slept with. However in some cases
the man tries to develop a relationship
with these woman and it's the women and not
him that are problem. One woman comes to mind. Delphine
,is a paranoid sex slut who likes to have sex
in dangerous places for the thrills of it.
She reminds of the type of woman I briefly
have met and or even the schizophrenic ""kitty"",
bondage like women who have rated my reviews (You know
who you are). Later on we learn that she
does it to spite her husband. Morane at first
thinks Delphine likes him, but being a grown man
and being smart enough to realize when he is being
played for the fool, he soon realizes she is just
using him. She is just a piece of trash that
he had the pleasure and displeasure to be with.
In a way this incident describes the problems for
Morane, sometimes he meets really nice women
who are afraid of commitment but like the sex
(does feeding Morane's appetite for more sex
without love), and other times he meets these
nasty, gutter trash, unfeeling, abusive and
self paranoid women wholl screw him in the end.
Quite a sad story, and it gets sadder and at times
funnier throughout. The flight attendant encounter
he has is a pretty memorable fling, one those
flings where Morane and his mate have fun, and
both come away happy with their short term encounter.
However, the party is over when Morane through his
doctor, Doctor Bicard (Jean Daste) tells him he
has Gonorhea. In a funny scene, the Doctor tells
him to tell his sexual partner that she has it, but
Morane cannot do that, because he has been with
a dozen women over the last few years and taking
names was something Morane didn't do. LOL
It's this sort of negligence and irresponsiblity
that show the side of Morane that every womanizer
is. A man in pursuit in his own selfish
interest that when the time comes out to help
another, the man (whether a womanizer or a capitalistic)
doesn't care. In this case, Morane's
Gonorrhea infection is both ironic and fitting.
Morane through this predicament then tells the Dr.
about the book that he is writing and the Dr.
encourages him to write since it would help him
perhaps deal with his women issues and perhaps find
the sexual partner with whom he infected gonorreah with.
Morane, then begins his manuscript describing
every woman he's slept him. It's a part tell all book
but part dedication as he tries his best to
describe every he's been with respect, and not
just an object. Morane finally fishes a draft and
sends it Parisian Publishers who reject his book for
it's sexist title called ""The Skirt Chaser"",
although there is one publisher,a woman no less,
Genevie (Brigitte Fossey), who likes the book, but
secretly also like Morane.
Looking into Morane's book we learn more about the
women he's been but also the man himself.
His adulterous mom was basically a cheap slut
who had lovers back and forth
who soon left her, and in turn the mom left Morane.
Morane then says how his mom was strict on him
and always kept him from talking to any girls which
explains Moranes behavior as adult.
Meanwhile Miss. Genevie, despite passing herself
as a feminist is cast by Morane's charming spell.
However when it seems that perhaps Genevie and Morane,
might become a good couple an unforseen accident
will take the life of one of them...
Despite the somewhat offensive premise, ""The Man
Who Loved Women"" or better known by it's original
title ""Homme qui aimait les femmes, L'"" is a very
entertaining French adult comedy/drama almost
reminiscent of newer comedies like ""Amelie"".
The film by Francois Truffaut is regarded as one
of his best from a very respectable director. He
has done quite a good job here including themes
that teaches the audiences many lessons.
He shows one man's obsession in pursuit of women,
shows that there consequences in his actions, and
shows us importantly that the man , Morane realizes
he has wasted most of his life with the pursuit of
these women and likewise the women too. That applies to todays society when women complained about the
men they dated instead of realizing it's their own
fault. Morane does have his moments though, he is quiet
witty and charming, and he does have a good taste
in some of the women he meets, in that they in
rare case just don't want to make a commitment.
Truffaut's approach is similar to Blake Edwards
approach in that both like to poke fun and explore
male and female relationships and why they are so
volatile, but I found Truffaut's approach more
sophisticated since Blake does tend to glamorize
these male and female sexual deviants without
focusing more on the aftermath of their actions.
Face facts in the world, a womanizer like Morane
would become the victim of murder through either
his formers lovers, or at the hands of his
lovers husbands or boyfriends. He wouldn't
live long, let alone have time to write a
tell all book it.
The movie is well acted and well directed, if you
call yourself a movie critic and never heard
of ""The Man Who Loved Man"" let alone write about
dont call yourself because you cannot overlook
this classic. On IMDB alone it has gathered
a respected 7 out of 10 rating. In fact
, you guessed Blake Edward himself tried
to remake the classic and failed despite
the all star of Burt Reynolds and Julie Andrews.
Ask for the DVD released by MGM, it was a
dissappointment, no commentary, no trailer,
no nothing basically the film itself. However the fact
that the movie is available in U.S. is good
news since many of these rare films from the 1970's
are practically unavaible in the video store.
So rent or buy ""The Man Who Loved Women"" and prepare
for a funny but intellectually stimulating and important
film.",1078876800,3,6152,4.634615384615385
493955,5,6302641926,"This is one of Truffaut's best films and it is an excellent exploration into the impulses that drive men to seek out a woman. The main character falls in love with any woman who catches his eye and in one case is so attracted to a pair of legs that he seeks out the woman with a very devious - but innocent - system that will ring true to many a romantic Casanova. the man is so obsessed by women - never in a bad way - that he decides to explore his feelings through a book. as he looks for the publisher he ends up finding t=yet another interest.  the film, however, in no way presents women in a degrading way and is very thoughtful in its respect of women in fact.  The main character could be compared to Casanova as he too loved and respected women.  the film has a comedic tone and almost comes across as a personal documentary as the scientist narrates his feelings and motivations. The subject matter and its portrayal are still relevant today. excellent.",1010016000,30,964,4.314917127071824
493956,3,6302641926,"Francois Truffaut has made some wonderful films in the past such as ""400 Blows"" (Which is my fvaorite), ""Stolen Kisses"", and ""Day For Night"". And this film makes the list also. Fans of Truffaut are sure to love this movie, as are foreign film fans too. The movie is about a man who falls in love with every women he meets. Which sounds perfectly normal to me. He is completely enthralled with women, and loves everything about them, as he tells us about the different types of women. He also tells us just how much he loves legs, which is something I wouldn't mind majoring in college. Legs, to him, are the most important part on a women, that's funny, I can think of another! This is a comedy, and does offer some laughs. Which was a shock to me, because foreign comedies aren't usually that funny to me, except for a certain Bergman one. This is a wonderful movie to watch with friends or by yourself. It's bound to entertain all who watch it. I wouldn't suggest you start to watch Truffaut films with this though. For that I suggest ""400 Blows"". Watch this one after you've realize the genius of Truffaut, which shouldn't take you very long anyway.

493960,1,6302641926,"Franois Truffaut's The Man Who Loved Women is a pornographic film masquerading as feminism. It is pornography in the etymological sense of ""depicting women as harlots"". All of the women portrayed in this film are harlots. They have little ambition but to be wanted by men and f***ed by men. They craft themselves, via their clothing and appearance and mannerisms, in such a way as to attact the attentions of men. When a man treats her badly, like a cut of meat, she responds with love, affection and gentle understanding. When she says no, she means yes, or likely even YES. She is not a real woman, but a patriarchal fantasy of what a woman should be. She is a sex doll that never complains, that wants nothing more than to fulfill the desires of men.

The film's hero is an everyman, Bertrand Morane, who stalks women in exceptionally creepy ways. Right at the beginning of the film, he catches a glimpse of a woman in a store, and runs outside to write down her license plate number. When he finds he cannot do so without grounds, he wrecks his car in a parking garage and files a claim. He finds out it was a rental, and tracks down the woman the car was registered to. When he calls her, and he explains how he tracked her, she smiles a giddy smile at all of this attention. A real woman might have called the police and obtained a restraining warrant, but there are no real women in this film. She agrees to meet him for lunch.

Bertrand Morane is decidedly ugly. And he is not someone to brag about his prowess or virility. As a character in the film says, he is no Don Juan or Casanova. The same is of course true for the men in hardcore pornography. Consider Ron Jeremy, for instance. One might reason that this is so that even the ugliest men can see themselves making the same conquests. That is probably true. But even more importantly, this is done to emphasize the lust of the ""women"", and to move patriarchy past the simple idea of men conquering women into a fantasy world where women themselves beg to be conquered. Bertrand, like any good pornographer, spends much of his time recording and thinking about these conquests. And when a woman does refuse to be conquered, he finds himself badly hurt, his ego shattered. How could any woman deny any man the pleasure of carnal access? In most cases, she does not. For most of the women in this film, Bertrand is the center of the world.

Perhaps the scene I found most disturbing was when Bertrand came across a little girl crying, and asked her whether she didn't feel a little pleasure in it. After some coaxing she agrees with him. Why did he ask her such a ridiculous question? And why did she give such a ridiculous answer? I can only understand this as the filmmaker's way of saying that when you treat a woman with cruelty, and she cries, you shouldn't feel too bad, because deep down inside she really liked it.",1329955200,2,2884,4.458333333333333
493961,4,6302641926,"Bertrand Morane (Charles Denner) in Francois Truffaut's ""The Man Who Loved Women"" wants every woman he sees and usually gets and beds them and then writes a book about his conquests. And that's most of what happens in this amusing film by one of the great film directors. Morane is likeable and perhaps lovable and certainly is never cruel to the women he meets. He just is determined to continue making notches on his gun. There is some indication that he was hurt when Vera (Leslie Caron) broke up with him four, five years ago although we are never completely sure-- at least I wasn't-- as to why he seeks quantity over quality. Certainly, however, the women he gets involved with, if just for a night, are for the most part lookers.

The movie is beautifully filmed as we see frame after frame of women's gorgeous legs for Morane sees them everywhere. Both the beginning and ending are quite brilliant.

A pleasant way to spent two hours of your life.",1281916800,3,955,4.6117647058823525
493962,5,6302641926,"The one thing that really struck me about this film is that it didn't have a laugh track.  Movies never do, of course, but at times ""The Man Who Loved Women"" is so side-splittingly funny that you kind of wish you were in a movie theatre with a bunch of people roaring with laughter, rather than just sitting at home watching a DVD.

But then again, the main character is not funny but really creepy.  Or is he?  Is he a heartbreaker, or just a victim himself?  The film's director, the brilliant Franois Truffaut, doesn't tip his hand.

The story concerns a 40-something aerodynamics engineer who lives in the beautiful French town of Montpellier.  The movie is set in, and was made in, the mid 1970's.  The main character has a long string of empty, meaningless trysts.  But there's something more to him than just that, as he fancies himself a philosopher of women and of love.  Oddly and counterintuitively, he becomes a sympathetic and intriguing character--but only partially--as the movie moves towards its conclusion.

As other reviewers have mentioned, the movie seems as light and simple as a souffl, but there's actually a lot going on.  On the witness stand, throughout the movie as it turns out, is the question of ""Does everyone need to be loved?""  Truffaut, in a very subtle and almost invisible way, weighs in.

Note: this movie is very heavy on conversation and very light on action.  It's also very subtle, almost quiet.  Probably not a good choice for someone looking for a lot of tension, drama, or swashbuckling.",1252108800,3,1532,4.746212121212121
493963,5,6302641926,"Truffaut's pseudo-autobiographical romantic comedy concerns a man who, at least outwardly, has no particularly exceptional qualities. And yet his persistence, frankness, and attentiveness to the physical attributes of the various women he encounters--played by Fossey, Natalie Baye, and Nelly Borgeaud--result in his becoming a rather roguish ladies' man. Denner--unsmiling, helplessly leering, yet somehow charming--was a perfect choice for the role, and there's a lot more to the story than conquest. As Bertrand writes about his life, he discovers dissatisfaction at the heart of his enterprise, a revelation Truffaut turns into bittersweet irony.

When he asks them something it's like his life depended on it, and they can't refuse. They love to be desired with such intensity, however short that relation will last. And he goes from one to another; every woman has something different that no other woman has, and he wants them all. He can't settle with one.

It's all very funny, but at the same time it makes one think of a great void that nothing and nobody can fill. It may be women, or anything else; but there is never enough of it to fill that void.

There is no real ""plot"", and it is senseless to give a pedestrian outline of what does or does not happen. I must have seen it when it came out, perhaps about 1977, and have not been able to forget it. It is, somehow, a perfectly made presentation of one man's life: insignificant yet universal, simultaneously realistic, surrealistic, artistic, fantastic, true yet imaginative. I was staggered to see that an apparently bone-headed remake by Blake Edwards, a clumsy and insensitive film-maker --- think of what a misuse of Peter Sellers' talents the Pink Panther series was! --- had attempted either to spoof it, or to exploit it. Well, I haven't seen his remake, but I can imagine it as the crudest possible American bludgeoning of French finesse.
