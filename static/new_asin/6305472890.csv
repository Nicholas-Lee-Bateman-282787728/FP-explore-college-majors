7889682,5,6305472890,"I have watched this movie over and over and I never get tired of it. The Plot line is not what you expect,if you like good movies get it.",1374364800,,137,3.7586206896551726
7889683,4,6305472890,"the first time i saw this i was looking for a movie with a good sex scene, won't deny it. the title screams sex movie to me for some reason. but its not a sex movie to watch if you're really horny or looking for something similar to porn, theres only one scene, and its nothing special

BUT

the movie itself was great. i liked the plot. i disagree with the review that says its predicatble. the only parts that are predictable are written about on the plot synopsis on the back of the DVD case. trust me, this movie has a great twist.

polly shannon was amazing, i actually ended up quite attached to her character. the other actors were not too special
but with this price you have nothing to lose.",1220745600,,700,4.2481203007518795
7889684,3,6305472890,"Interesting story line, but acting is flat and characters not very well developed.  The actor who plays the immoral doctor is good at being full of fear and guilt, but doesn't have a personality beyond that.  Could have been done better.",1122681600,,237,4.7560975609756095
7889685,4,6305472890,"Henry Czerny plays a married Doctor ,asked by his vacationing neighbours to keep an eye on their nubile teenage daughter,who is being harrassed by a fellow student unable to accept the end of their affair. An affair develops betweem them and she films him getting dressed afterr a sex session,which is somewhat unfortunate as she is shortly afterwards murdered,placing him in an invidious position as he wrestles with both conscience and adesire to protect his freedom,marriage and social standing.
The plot is well worked out although the murderer is easily spotted. Good acting and direction make for a pleasing time passer",1026950400,6,625,5.198019801980198
7889686,4,6305472890,"I first saw this movie last fall on one of the pay movie channels and enjoyed it. While it certainly is not a work of artistic genius, it's a fun movie to watch late at night and I thought it had sufficient eroticism and suspense to keep me watching. It is the sort of movie that won't require much thinking but it fulfills its purpose of entertaining and I tend to be one that is very critical of the mindless material the movie industry now releases.",996796800,9,452,4.267441860465116
7889687,3,6305472890,"I viewed this movie with some trepidation, given the title and the somewhat lurid box art. I've followed Henry Czerny's career with interest, and have found his career choices intriguing, so I thought, what the heck.  In brief, I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of performances,  production, and particularly the direction. In less talented hands, this  could've been movie-of-the-week schlock, but here, it's quite effectively  presented. Very little that could be called gratuitous...nicely  atmospheric...something of a ""neighborhood noir."" Again: a  pleasant surprise, and kudos to Czerny, an excellent supporting cast (who  ARE those guys? ), and a director who bears watching.",948585600,8,695,5.689320388349515
