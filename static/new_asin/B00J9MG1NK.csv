7616797,5,B00J9MG1NK,"The five stars are for the blu-ray image which is far beyond what I anticipated for this 20+ year old film.  This is a good concert, a nice memento of Bill Wyman's last tour as the Stones' bassist, and it's got most of the old favorites in terms of song selection.  But the restoration of the Imax image is really extraordinary, especially since this concert was available for a long time only on a really sub-par, washed-out looking dvd.  I actually use this as a demonstration disc for my blu-ray system and hdtv.  It blows away even the most recent movie blu-rays in terms of image quality, depth, crispness, and detail. Stones fanatics will get this for sure, but even casual fans might snap up this very affordably priced blu-ray.",1268006400,11,735,4.630769230769231
7616798,5,B00J9MG1NK,Really good video....just like being at the concert....I was at this concert in 1989...this is the next best thing to being there...,1265760000,,132,5.045454545454546
7616799,4,B00J9MG1NK,"This was a very nice and visually clear blu-ray DVD. It was a little short, being only a little over 70 minutes in length. The songs had a strange audio mix on the first half of the disc. It was Keith's guitar playing very prominent over everything thing else including Mick's vocals. I really enjoyed the video of ""2000 Light Years from Home"", which I do not remember hearing them ever doing on tour. This also was the last DVD to have bass player Bill Wyman, as he left the group not long after this was recorded, which to me is historic in itself. I just wish the Stones would drop the songs, ""Satisfaction, Brown Sugar, Honky Tonk Women and Jumping Jack Flash"" which always seem to be on every Stones DVD and in every Stones concert from the last 20 years. Don't get me wrong they are good songs and they do them well but they are being too repetitive when they have many great songs in their back cataloge that many of us would like to hear live before the group retires.",1264809600,4,976,4.309782608695652
7616800,4,B00J9MG1NK,"I remember when this concert was first released for IMAX theaters back in 1991: it was the first really cool IMAX movie, and a great concept -- a rock concert on one of those huge, larger than life screens.  The visual impact of seeing this thing at an IMAX theater was awesome, and highly entertaining to say the least.  Until recently, there was no way to really recreate that excitement at home, but this Blu-ray is certainly the next best thing.

If you have a home theater set-up, with a big screen hi-def. monitor or projector, then this title is the one for you.  I've got a fairly big Mitsubishi (73""), and it does a fine job showing the Rolling Stones in all their glory.  Filmed with IMAX cameras back in 1989-1990, the clarity, sharpness, and overall direction of the production is visually stunning.  The audio quality, as well, is very good.

Vintage Rolling Stones concerts is what I am into.  This being a 20 year-old concert (at the time of this Blu-ray release), it represents the best, oldest show available at this time.  ""Gimme Shelter"" is cool, but ""Let's Spend the Night Together"" (the 1983 concert film of the 1981 tour) is the one I am waiting for on Blu-ray.  (The mythical ""Ladies and Gentlemen...The Rolling Stones"" from 1972 would be the best...)  Until then, LIVE AT THE MAX gives Stones fans something to really enjoy.  Notably, LIVE AT THE MAX also marks the final shows with all 5 ""original members"" (including ""new guy"" Ron Wood), as this would be bass player Bill Wyman's final tour.  It is great to see some of these older rock concerts released onto Blu-ray disc.  LIVE AT THE MAX does not disappoint.",1261526400,3,1637,4.619377162629758

7616825,5,B00J9MG1NK,"This is a welcomed addition to my album,cd and DVD collection.. Wish I had seen it when it came out in the actual IMAX Theaters.. I grew up on the Navy Base at China Lake, Ca. In the 60's and my cousin's Patty and Mary Ann would come stay with our family during the summers.. They were not only years older than me.. But being from Redondo Beach, Ca. and Reno, Nv.. They had real music stores to go to.. They brought me Rolling Stones, Beatles, Steppenwolf and albums by many of the great rock bands of the time.. I still have every one of those in mint condition. Something else they taught me..  So, when this concert came out .. I was proud to add it to all the other great music these bands put out.. Do you agree with me.. Today's music just does not have what it takes to stand the test of time.. The Stones music  will out live all who read this review..

7616829,3,B00J9MG1NK,"with close to 100 concerts to my name now, I am an ardent fan of the Rolling Stones. I remember when this came out how impressed I was, how much more I liked it then Let's Spend the Night Together, the film from the prior American tour. Watching it now, after Four Flicks, A Bigger Bang, and the Hyde Park DVDS, this seems less like a concert film and an overl;ong promotional video. It is too slick for its own good.",1394064000,3,417,4.160493827160494
7616830,3,B00J9MG1NK,"The venue in which they performed was so huge that even viewing it on dvd, I felt a long way away.

7616844,5,B00J9MG1NK,"My favourite band of all time from the first time I saw them live back in '65 at the Empire State Theatre in Liverpool. The Stones still know how to put the rock into rock'n roll and this video is proof of that. Great to watch and listen to especially in Blu-ray. Go out and get it for yourself, you won't be disappointed.",1311724800,,322,4.126984126984127
7616845,4,B00J9MG1NK,"First off I'll admit I'm a huge fan of the Stones and I saw this tour in person.
Second I love IMAX films they are pinnacle of visual quality.  When I saw this
was out on Blu I took the plunge and I'm glad I did!
Visually this is as good as concert film gets great PQ and looks awesome on my large 50 inch LCD.
Audio is impressive as well really the only downside is this lack of substantial extra features.
Still if quality is what you are after this is a great concert Blu-ray to show off your setup and the next best thing to IMAX or being there!",1295568000,3,549,3.945945945945946

7616847,5,B00J9MG1NK,"I have the old DVD of this and just received the Blu Ray tonight.  I popped it in to check the quality and ended up watching the whole show start to finish, it was so great!  The audio on the DVD was so bad I contacted the producers who mentioned they knew about this and were working on a new mix.  The audio and video in the Blu Ray version is a HUGE improvement!  The band is so energetic, the guitars sound great, the IMAX filming makes you feel like you are on stage with the Stones, and the band sounds tight and rocks hard.  I noticed several things that I never saw watching this concert on DVD.  The guitars in particular are much more prominent and Keith is so much fun to watch.  My only complaints are (1) the audio and video do not appear to be perfectly synced (which I have noticed on almost every concert DVD I own!  I think the skill of audio engineering has been lost) and (2) some pixelation between chapters, which I am assuming is a problem with my PowerDVD software and not the disk.  But this is a 5 star must have show!  Probably my top official stones performance available, and includes Bill Wyman on bass!",1291161600,13,1132,4.247663551401869

And Blu-ray only makes the experience all the more enjoyable.  You get the enjoyment of seeing the band in all their glory, you have the best seats in the house, all while avoiding the outlandish ticket prices, the parking hassles and the huge crowds.

If you ever wanted to see the Stones, or you did see them live and want to relive the experience over and over again, this is the perfect vehicle for that.  It's money well spent.",1284076800,2,685,4.44
7616850,5,B00J9MG1NK,"First off I have to say that the older reviews of this DVD are from the original DVD release and you will see many low star ratings and complaints about the sound mix. This was Remastered in 2009 to a STUNNING new brilliant audio and picture mix. It's been totally revamped and you must get a copy!
This DVD to be truly enjoyed you need to treat yourself and get a 5.1 Home theatre sound system. Don't just watch this on your tv or jack the sopund through a stereo. The new 5.1 mix is incredible! Ronnie Wood's Guitar work comes in the back leftr speaker so Crisp and clear! Keith's Guitar comes in center and right speakers. There is just tremendious sound separation, it's truly a masterpiece of remixing.
The Picture is superb and clean and sharp. The close ups are fantastic!
This was shot on Film (Imax) and this gives the show a theatical feel (which it was actually was).
The Stones played a very enjoyable set and in great spirits, all through the show, you can see Ronnie and Keith play off each other ans really see the chemistry they have. Mick's voice is strong and sounds great. This DVD is more than 5 Stars, it's just that good!
This is not your typical DVD of a concert being filmed, they were making a MOVIE and knew it, the quality of the stage production and crew and Band all come through as true champions.
This DVD once agian shows and reaffirms that the Rolling Stones is the greatest Rock and Roll band!
The song's all sparkle with energy and excitement, I just with it could have went on for another hour it was so enjoyable.

To experience something similar at home one must have at least a decent home theater sound system with 200+ watts of output and a large screen tv (50"" or more).  My home theater (aka man cave) worked just fine.  If you are at this point in your audio-visual situation and happen to be a Rolling Stones fan you simply must buy this DVD.  Then empty your living space of anyone sensitive to loud sound, turn up the volume, kick back, and enjoy the music.  Pretty spectacular.",1475020800,2,573,4.480769230769231
