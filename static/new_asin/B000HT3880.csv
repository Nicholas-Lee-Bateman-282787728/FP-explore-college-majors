8141093,3,B000HT3880,"While this is a great product for any Gundam fan, I was slightly dissappointed. The first time I had watched Gundam Seed, I watched it on an anime site. For three days I watched nothing but Seed and Seed: Destiny, liking it so well I deicided to try and order the series. How ever when I ordered this collection. I was dissapointed to find that, instead of it being broken up into episodes, it was broken up into three diffrent movies. Which really isn't a bad thing save for the fact that a lot of scenes has been cut from them. Many scenes which are needed to get a clear idea of whats going on. How ever if you are new to Seed, then this is the perfect thing for you.",1243987200,,670,4.122137404580153
8141094,2,B000HT3880,"I too bought this Set for the ""Amazing price"" that it sells for. Only to be hurt whenever I watched the DVD's and almost 3/4 of the scenes in the movie were taken out!!! So not funny, Only bonus to this set is that it comes with a CD of the Seed music from the movie, Which in fact is not bad if your into music you cant really understand. If I would have known any better then to buy this because of the bargin buy it was, I would have just bought each Episode DVD over time.",1195862400,3,476,3.86734693877551
8141095,3,B000HT3880,"The reason I think that Gundam series is a kid's movie is:

In Gundam shows, you see Gundam dodging a laser beam in flashy moves.

How does a gigantic machine like Gundam dodge a laser beam? Unless its body moves in a light speed, it is not possible. So, the whole Gundam battle premise break down. Once you realize that, you realize that you can't even build a pseudo-science to back up Gundam technology.",1179878400,,406,4.472972972972973
8141096,2,B000HT3880,"a gundam fan myself, i bought this boxed set out of impluse seeing that it has the complete collection in three discs, for $39...too good of a deal. i did a little more research & found out that this collection compressed all 10 discs into a movie format. many of the important scences are missing & too much will be happening. i canceled my order & will wait for the price to drop on the economy box set with all 5 discs per season",1179187200,28,432,4.154761904761905
8141097,4,B000HT3880,the story between the characters was good though i did not like the end very much.,1173312000,,82,4.1875
8141098,5,B000HT3880,"I've been a Gundam Fan ever since the original Mobile Suit Gundam, but this series pars with the previous products of all-things-Gundam.  It's a great collection for a great price because it includes all of the Movies in one set.  Consider buying this since buying it separately can cost about 30 dollars each.

The movies are quite different from the actual series since they compile and cramp all of the important events into one collection, and in three movies like what they did with the original Mobile Suit Gundam.

Overall it's a great series that has much action, drama, and the scars of battle written all over it.  Get it while it's in stock.  I'm also promoting Gundam since the Gundam Fad had quite diminished over the years after Gundam Wing, so I'm hoping that the Gundam franchise could rise again.",1169251200,6,813,4.7304964539007095
