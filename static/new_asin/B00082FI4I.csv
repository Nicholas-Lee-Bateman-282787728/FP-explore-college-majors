If so,  you'll like this DVD which explains everything you could possibly want to know about the New Orleans festival. There isn't much stuff about other things in the south, so the DVD is sorta mistitled, but the carnival footage more than makes up for it. You get a really good sense of why this party matters and why even in the days of post-Katrina, people still celebrate fat tuesday.",1153353600,,455,4.617283950617284
8174975,5,B00082FI4I,I'm a big fan of these types of movies because they help me figure out where I want to go on my next vacation. This one gives a fairly comprehensive tour of the Southern States. My favorite track shows New Orleans at Mardi Gras - which I found particularly poingent in the post Katrina era. It made me want to go next year. The other areas also look interesting and I might take a trip to Florida. The movies are not too  promotional and I felt like I got a balanced perspective.,1148428800,,479,4.206521739130435
