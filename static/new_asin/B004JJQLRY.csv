8431916,1,B004JJQLRY,"We love Santorini, and even though this DVD was $25.00, I thought, what the heck, it would bring back some great memories.  Wrong!  First, strangely, the DVD would not play on our Panasonic BluRay player; it did play on an older DVD player.

Anyway, the narration is very dull and boring, the cameraman and narrator seemed to have a fascination with the donkeys of the island, and this was filmed at least ten years ago, if not more.  There is nothing to recommend on this DVD; even at half the current price of $27.00 it would not be worth it...our copy is going in the trash.  I don't like giving negative reviews, but I wish there had already been a review to warn me.",1363132800,,671,4.379032258064516
