8164267,4,B000LTN7KK,"The series itself is really great, the story is funny, cute, and entertaining. I really love the character of Kang Tae Bong as well.

On the down side, the subtitles became terrible when I reached the 4th disk.  Words were spelled wrong, sentences made absolutely no sense and somehow the main character's name was changed from ""Oh Dal-Ja"" to ""Wu-Dazi""
I can understand very basic Korean and the actors are still clearly saying ""Oh Dal-Ja"" so I am baffled as to where this other name came from.

That said, I don't believe this copy is an official release from KBS and I couldn't understand enough hangul to figure out the official website to  determine if it was or not.

I will be waiting anxiously until a copy with decent subtitles comes out.

Even though the show is lovely, it may not be worth it to watch unless you are fluent in Korean.",1205193600,8,844,4.519736842105263
8164268,4,B000LTN7KK,I enjoyed this one.  It was a little off with the subtitles but you get the point though.  Good story line sweet.,1184112000,2,113,4.090909090909091
8164269,4,B000LTN7KK,It was good. I would watch it again. As always the music was the thing that brought the rating up from a three to a four.,1183420800,2,121,3.6923076923076925
