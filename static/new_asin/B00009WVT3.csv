1894994,4,B00009WVT3,"This is an enjoyable heist film where the character development is the central element rather than the heist itself. If you want nonstop action and complicated plots, watch one of the big budget spectaculars with the marquee names; if you want a well told story then you should enjoy this movie. I highly recommend the initial Amazon reviews (posted in April) as accurately capturing the essence of this film: thus I will not repeat their detail here but strongly suggest that you read a few of them in order to understand the nature of this cinematic endeavor.
Nick Nolte is Bob, a burned out heroin addict and former master thief who is recruited to mastermind a Monte Carlo casino heist. Tchecky Karo is Roger, a policeman who is his nemesis and is convinced that there is something being plotted. Nick's sidekick Paolo and a Bosnian prostitute named Anne who is befriended by Nick are the other main characters in a very engaging cast with several of the minor parts adding enjoyable twists to the story. There is the usual misdirection, just the right mix of humorous interludes and enough plot developments to keep the viewer's interest despite the slow pace of the story. The cinematography is excellent and definitely helps the story feel authentic.
My only major reservation is mentioned in jupitergirl's review but deserves emphasis. Both my wife and I found that the dialogue was often hard to understand, especially early in the film until we became accustomed to the accents, inflections, and cadences of the various actors (most of whom with the exception of Nolte were European and unfamiliar to us). In fact our unfamiliarity with the actors also meant that it took us a while to sort out the characters and their roles since they were introduced casually throughout the early part of the film.
This is a well constructed and enjoyable movie, but given the slow pace at which it proceeds you should plan to see it when you just want to relax and see a story gradually unfold. The conclusion is really wonderful, both for its cleverness and sense of irony; it nicely tied together all the storylines. The caper was fun; the film was a pleasurable experience",1053388800,10,2172,4.825737265415549
1894995,5,B00009WVT3,This film is quite a refreshing pleasure. It could easily be described as another highly stylized capper film but it is quite a bit deeper than that assessment. It is strongly character based with many participants who are themselves all quite quirky with Nick Nolte at the hub of this ensemble who is in fact the catalyst of a very intriguing but vague plot line. Even Nolte's character is that of a very vague art thief whom we really know nothing about yet he entices you and keeps you just interested enough before the bottom drops out. This is quite a mesmerizing film and to tell too much about it would just be telling too much! Take my word for it that this is one absolutely brilliantly orchestrated film that should leave you quite satisfied.,1052784000,2,752,4.5777777777777775
1894996,3,B00009WVT3,"This film was another deep disappointement.  Everything what could have missed was missed there.  In this film I saw a very good story, which was almost impossible to screw up.  This story could make one of the greatest films if not for Nick Nolte and for the rest of the group.  The film is very weak, primitive, I would say.  I gave it three stars only out of respect for the past.",1052697600,2,383,4.263888888888889
1894997,1,B00009WVT3,"This is a movie that I would never want to see a second time--it was bad enough the first time.  The plot was difficult to follow and Nolte is a mess even when he is supposed to be ""cleaned up.""  The acting was strained and mostly unbelieveable.  Don't waste your money.  The movie is a bad ""B"" version of Ocean's Eleven, but without any interesting characters.",1051833600,6,361,4.424242424242424
1894998,5,B00009WVT3,"When I read in Film Comment last year that Neil Jordan (who made The Crying Game, one of my all-time favorite films) was making a remake of the great Jean Pierre Melville's classic Bob Le Flembeur, I was very excited but at the same time worried. As most of us who have seen it know, it's one of the greatest crime films ever made (one of Melville's best). Needless to say, this film does the original justice and more. Nick Nolte turns in brilliant performance after performance (just his face is interesting to look at) and this film is no exception. After making a string of bad movies in the early-mid 90's, he bounced back with a haunting role in Affliction and has been on top of his game. Ralph Fiennes makes the most of his short yet memorable role. Jordan's camera prowls and stalks the streets of Monte Carlo like a minx, and the scenery is absolutely breathtaking. Great photograpy, direction, performances, and screenplay make this (so far) one of the best films of 2003.",1051747200,2,983,4.590909090909091
1894999,4,B00009WVT3,"I wasn't too sure what to make'a this flick when I went to see it at the local artsy theater downtown. I'm a fan'a Nick Nolte's work an' my taste in movies leans toward the more obscure like this, but I was still skeptical. But, I gotta tell y'all, after about thirty minutes of uncertainty I was hooked. It's dark an' atmospheric, the story, set in South France, is simple enough to follow, but complex enough to remain interesting an' innovative. An' is' focused on a character who's hadda life'a hard drugs, hard booze, an' hard times an' seems at the end'a his rope.  I hafta agree with what the reviewer Michael Acuna in that Nick Nolte plays this role like it's his last performance ever. The character of Bob Montaigneis an aging gambler and heroin addict, who's masterminding a casino theft in hopes of breakin' his downhill streak of poverty, bad luck an' depression. He's as complicated an' difficult a person to relate to as any, but Nolte plays him in such a way that he becomes a mysterious enigma, spoutin' off stories an' philosophic musings, but never REALLY lettin' us know what it is that makes him feel so empty. Because'a that dark an' cynical aspect of Bob; the anticipation of the actual heist as Bob gathers his team of cohorts who're gonna help him pull the job, all the while with a dogged police inspector breathin' down his neck, has a sense'a dread surroundin' it. But director Neil Jordan tends to end his movies on as unexpected a note as possible, an' 'The Good Thief' was no exception.

Like I said, this movie was hard for me to get into at first, but once you get drawn in, it doesn't let you go. The acting is all superb though Nolte obviously is runnin' the show here (he's burned-out an' reflective, but never overly-cynical, you will LIKE his character). The young newcomer Nutsa Kukhianidze who plays the 17-year-old Bosnian prostitute who comes to stay with Bob, shows several flashes of promise (an' several flashes of another kind), an' Tcheky Karyo as the police inspector as well as the kid who played Bob's worshipful sidekick Paulo (sorry, his name was too hard to remember) both were great support.

This movie ain't gonna be for EVERYBODY. It does fall into that artsy-fartsy category an' as I said you hafta have patience at the start an' not allow yourself to be swayed by the odd an' unorthodox feel. If I'm gonna complain about ANYTHING in this movie, is' that I feel like Bob kicks his heroin habit rather quickly an' rather easily. He seemed to have one night of hardships, an' then he was jus' fine. No relapses, no serious references to it, NOTHING. That bothered me, because the story paints him as this wasted, burned-out junkie who's beyond help by the time he decides to kick, yet then it allows him to kick with no problem. But, other than that one minor infraction, I dug this movie a lot, an' if you wanna get away from the typical fluff Hollywood is churnin' out, then give this a shot.",1051228800,6,2950,4.583333333333333
1895000,5,B00009WVT3,"This was a fantastic movie.  Nolte is wonderful in a relaxed, intriguing role.  The supporting characters are believable and the movie flows like great, mellow jazz.  This is a film you don't want to miss.  I pray the soundtrack comes out on cd, soon.",1050796800,2,251,4.636363636363637
1895001,4,B00009WVT3,"A remake of Jean Pierre Melville's Bob Le Flambeur, The Good Thief tells the tale of Bob Montagnet, a gambling as well as a heroin addict who is down in his luck.  As an avid art lover, he recently discover that the new owner of the Monte Carlo at the French Riviera has a sizeable collection of priceless pieces, and is determine to pull that one spectacular job in which no one else can rival.  Assembling the right group of people and concocting a plan within a plan, the line between truths and lies becomes increasingly blurry as Bob attempts to outwit the pesky policeman following his every movement.  Will fortune smiles down on him, or will he be dealt another loser hand?
Bob is a skilled thief and a master storyteller, from how his parents first met to the accounts of his own life, no two versions are ever the same.  It is hard to pinpoint the exact reason, but Nick Nolte's portrayal of Bob appears to be almost effortless.  The man's struggle with a drug habit, the desolated look and his stubborn refusal to be beaten.  Nolte was able to relate all of these feelings on the screen convincingly.  Tcheky Karyo plays his nemesis Roger, a French cop who is both a friend, as well as an enemy due to their occupational differences.  Their cat and mouse relationship provided many of the humorous moments in the movie.  Newcomer Nutsa Kukhianidze held her own opposite of Nolte as the seductive prostitute Anne.  Her acting is subtle, confident, and likeable.  Definitely someone to keep an eye out for in the future.  The rest of the cast is made up of Said Taghmaoui as Paulo and Gerard Darmon as Raoul, Bob's good friends and associates in the business.
Rather than falling back on flashy action or dramatic car chases to tell the story, award-winning director Neil Jordan chose to concentrate on having his characters do all the work for him.  The Good Thief is a rare instance where the development of these roles take precedence, and the picture benefits greatly because of it.  The finely woven plot consists of numerous twists and turns common to caper films; fortunately, they are kept fresh by the smart writing along with the solid acting all around.  You may not be able to follow everything that is going on, but you can be sure that there isn't a dull moment.  Cinematography by Chris Menges is stunning.  The contrast between the glamorous Riviera and the squalid but exotic underworld is remarkable.
Sexy and stylish, The Good Thief is one of the best heist films I have seen in years.  Nick Nolte delivers an outstanding performance in a part that seems to be tailored especially for him.  An intriguing and an unpredictable plot, the witty dialogues, combined with a strong focus on the lead characters made this an immensely enjoyable experience.  Admittedly the movie was hard for me to get into at first, but once you were drawn in, it does not let you go until the very last scene.  While The Good Thief does not have the same star power as the highly successful Ocean's Eleven, don't let that stop you from checking it out.",1050796800,10,3058,4.636363636363637
1895002,5,B00009WVT3,"Set in the beautiful and panoramic hills of the South of France, THE GOOD THIEF is an intriguing remake of the 1955 French film noir classic BOB LE FLAMBEUR. Bob Montagnet (Nick Nolte), a gambler and drug addict down on his luck and fortune, assembles a crew to pull off a casino heist while deceiving the French police, in particular Roger (Tcheky Keryo) who has been given a tip of Montagnet's plans. Seeking refuge from her pimp, Anne (Nutsa Kukhianidze) helps Montagnet get clean while simultaneously trying to seduce him with her stunning body and youthful charm. In THE GOOD THIEF Nolte delivers an impressive performance that makes one believe that he remains true to his form. The viewer trusts his characterization of a strung-out gambler and his pain is well detailed across his persona. To top it off, Nolte throws in some laughs and is creative in his interactions with Roger, the member of the French police who is insistently following him. The cinematography is original and inventive as end of scenes are frequently met with a freeze of the last frame. It's jolting but at the same time it peaks interest in the film. Scenes of backroom gambling in addition to the utilization of primary, bold colors throughout this film creates an effective portrayal of the underbelly of this often-cited glamorous geographical location of Europe. Overall, THE GOOD THIEF is a bold and original film that rightly deserves recent critical acclaim. I fully recommend this film.",1050278400,8,1477,4.959677419354839
1895003,4,B00009WVT3,"Neil Jordan is a master storyteller and filmmaker and also the director of the new Nick Nolte film, ""The Good Thief."" Nolte plays Bob Montagnet (montaigne): a beat up, past his prime, drug addled, seemingly out of it, former big time thief faced with the prospect and challenge of his final, once in a lifetime heist.
Nick Nolte, craggy-faced, whiskey voiced and dripping with charisma plays Bob like it is his final performance ever: his every word is delivered with deathbed earnestness... voluptuous with meaning.
Bob is a man who has come to the realization that his days as a thief and a romancer of women have just about come to an end. And because of this, when he is offered a chance in a lifetime to plan and execute the ultimate heist, he grasps at it with every fiber of his being for he knows there will be no more chances to make his mark .He is a man possessed with self-knowledge enough to know that this is his final chance to collect enough money to live out his days in luxury. Bob Montagnet could not, would not ever live without the finer things in life.
""The Good Thief"" was shot in the south of France and in Monte Carlo by Michael Balhaus in gorgeous jewel tones to reflect the luxury of the world in which Bob revolves.
If there is a fault in this film it is in the re-dubbing: the voices do not always blend with the milieu in which they were shot.
""The Good Thief"" is a thoughtful portrait of a man at the end of his career who must decide between fading into the sunset with a whimper or going out with a bang; even though that final bang might cost him his life.
As he showed in ""The Crying Game"" and ""End of the Affair,"" Neil Jordan has an affinity for the disenfranchised, the disaffected, the outcasts of the world. And once again in ""The Good Thief"" he shows that he can relate and empathize with those who can only survive if they live on the fringes: steadfastly adhering to a code of ethics that they alone can explain and which most of us would be hard pressed to uphold or adhere to.",1049932800,17,2020,4.332453825857519
1895044,5,B00009WVT3,"You seen one heist film, you seen them all. But every once in a while, somebody who really gives a you-know-what, figures out how to make it fun again.

The Good Thief doesn't stray from established nostrums of the genre.

There's the eclectic band of robbers drilling holes under a sealed room. There's the stoic and ultra-exotic moll - and I mean EXOTIC because I've never seen something like Nutsa Kukhianidze. There's the double, triple cross plot and the debt that must be paid by Monday... or else. Yeah, on paper this reads like the heist film blueprint by Jules Dassin or Jean-Pierre Melville himself, but The Good Thief is a lot more and a true underrated gem. It's a heck of a surprise considering it's a remake of a Melville's Bob Le Flambeur.  It's all in good fun, Picasso stole too right?

Nolte never seemed so at home or at ease. It's questionable if he read any dialog from a script at all. Nolte is not acting - this is pure skill, confidence and simply brilliant casting. Where the hell was his Oscar? Under recorded environmental dialog has you leaning in to catch every word under the ambient scattered noise. The photography has a realist punch that makes Ocean's 11 look like the bench warmer who tries too hard. Don't miss the slick soundtrack of blues, jazz and even vibrant French rap.

Rapid fire dialog right out of David Mamet leads character exchanges, but here it is far more engaging than his rhythms of nonsensical unimportance you find in most Mamet productions. There's a drive and purposeful feel to the editing too. Where Michael Bay movies are loud orgies of quick cutting rock nonsense, the Good Thief cuts less like a Bay Ferrari commercial but with a pulse of real life. You can't miss the frame drags in chases or the Jules and Jim freeze frame at the end of scenes. At first it seems too much, but in reflection of the whole, you see it's just a director doing things because he loves what he does. He's in love with making the movie.

Einstein didn't believe in luck and I never knew Neil Jordan had it in him.",1332547200,,2054,4.537837837837838
1895045,5,B00009WVT3,"Cannot say enough good things about this utterly fantastic film.

Everyone remembers Nolte's mugshot - pretty hard to dismiss. The man looked like warmed over dog poo capped with an Einstein bad hair day.

But what everyone forgot, well almost everyone 'cept maybe Director Neil Jordan, was that Nolte is one hellacious actor; perhaps one of best his ever generation ever produced. Unfortunately that mugshot and his crazed anti-aging health kick took center stage in the man's career and, for the most part, he's been on the outside looking in ever since.

Well, the man may have indeed lost his mind, but he definitely didn't lose his talent. And one could argue - that's the definition of genius.

In this very Mamet-like flick he plays an expatriate junkie thief diddling away his life gambling, shooting H, and generally trying to stub out the coal of his existence. Until he unexpectedly meets a young woman, Anne, a lost soul in amongst an ocean of lost souls - himself included. But this one he saves from the sewer pit of sexual abuse, drug addiction and damnation. It wasn't intended as a life changer, but it turns out to be anyway. Suddenly, his slow downward path skews off in a different direction. Whether that's a good thing or not is what this film is about.

And once again, my favorite European actor, Tchky Karyo hit his role with laser precision as the good cop and ersatz friend to Nolte's character Robert 'Bob' Montagnet. A perilous friendship based on professional and mutual respect; he's captured the silver-tongued pinch several times. But despite his thieving, each time the hardened officer sees within him the spark of goodness, so he tries his best to keep Bob from going back to prison. Not necessarily on the straight-and-narrow, just off the dark trail that leads back to the iron hole. After six stints in the cage, he knows that his thief buddy will not survive another conviction.

Unfortunately, he's gotten word that his friend might be attempting another high profile heist. And he's determined, friend or not, he won't allow that to happen. And if it costs Bob his life, then that's the price for gambling.

Filled with hilarious offbeat and wonderful characters; this indie tears apart and craps on the slick ""Clooney/Ocean's"" franchise with an energy that Hollywood, with their preprocessed Powerpoint charts and doughnut-fed focus groups, will never be able to capture.

Personal notes:

- Ntsa Kukhianidze in this role and particular make-up is STUNNING. I've rarely seen a beauty like her. Enchanting would kiss her backside in groveling respect. Beauty would be her ugly best friend. I'm stunned that a French production actually used an age-appropriate actress for this important role. Too often the crow-feets squirm their way in and ruin the potency of too many a film. Just my two pennies in this regard.

- Ralph Fiennes does the dual-edged gentleman scum so well, I suspect I take it for granted. The man is brilliant - again. And interestingly took no credit in the production. Certainly not because of shame, because this was a genuinely fantastic movie. Perhaps because he was only briefly on film, as little as a couple of minutes. But it was an extremely vivid one-hundred-twenty seconds. Interestingly, it's very similar to his '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-Bruges/dp/B0018BD9DA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In Bruges</a>' performance.

- And finally I want to give props to Sad Taghmaoui. He's one of those truly amazing character actors who seem to be descended from the chameleon family; deftly changing his acting appearance at a whim. There doesn't seem to be anything he can't do. Seen him do terrorist, businessman, murderer, goofy techno-geek, comical sidekick, and so many others. Love him in everything! The man needs more work period.",1327190400,,3847,5.119617224880383
1895046,3,B00009WVT3,"THE GOOD THIEF, starring Nick Nolte and filmed on location in Monte
Carlo, released in 2002, is a movie that is perhaps of special
interest to criminologists, as it covers a number of aspects that
are widely reported in the media, as scourges of society. It also
associates the weaknesses of the film's protagonists to the profit,
glamor, class and prestige of a casino, thus making viewers reflect
on how there's always someone, somewhere, raking it in from another
human's failings - not exactly a brother's keeper, is it?

Here, there's tales of heroin abuse in the character played
tastefully by Nutsa Kukhianidze, whose youth and innocence in this
picture are a true complement to Nolte's older ""tortured mind and
soul"" presence; in this manner, there's a chemistry between the pair
that is charismatic. Also, the movie has a small part for a role of
a transgendered weight lifter, perhaps to throw a curve ball to the
audience. There's also prominence given to gambling addiction, as
one would expect, from the plot, involving a casino for which Monte
Carlo is well known. There's the traffic of high value paintings, in
this case, Picasso and otherwise, and a mastermind plan from Nolte's
character to take possession of millions.

The filming spot adds value to the story, as the camera shows the
coutryside and also ""in loco"" filming in the city itself,
underlining its many glamourous and luxurious aspects, as its more
common aspects. The casino sequences, I find were done even better
than in 007's Casino Royale. The action is never slow ...time moves
rapidly over 90 mins, and the suspense is always present. Overall,
the GOOD THIEF's special effects, music, and more is well delivered,
and the story entertaining.

I wouldn't suggest this movie is intended for the patrons of Monte
Carlo, obviousl. I don't know exactly why the ""Algerian"" aspect is
combined into it, unless, the story writer felt first generation
newcomers from the Magreb deserved being associated with some of
what goes on in the movie, perhaps. A fun movie, and the law
enforcement is always present, throughout, to remind viewers
of the consequences.",1270166400,,2136,4.99438202247191

Though the idea is the same, the cops are all ready to get the upper hand, but it all goes to the dogs because one sexually ambiguous gangster is afraid of some spiders and this leads the cops to leaving the Casino per se. So the safe is emptied and the boss who has been playing all the time wins big, real big, but his gang loses and it is the small youngish others who win. The world is no longer what it used to be. Apart from that the film lacks the humor Ocean has and the very hostile world that really plays it as a game and not as a war. But apart from that it is an acceptable entertainment though it will not change the face of the world nor the color of the moon.

Usually I'll take the original over the re-make but not in this case....with one major consideration. In order to like this film, I had to play the DVD with the English subtitles on because many of the accents were just too tough to decipher and if you can't understand the dialog, it gets a bit frustrating. The story is confusing enough as it is, so, if you have a similar problem as I had, play this with the subtitles.

If there is such a thing as colorful film noir, this would be it, with many splashes of the neon nightlife of France, inside and outside.  Story-wise, if you're confused you are not alone. After two viewings, I still haven't totally figured out the twist at the end. The dialog tries to be snappy mid-40s Raymond Chandler stuff and sometimes it's great, other times it's affected. Overall, however, it 's fun. Nick Nolte delivers most of the clever lines. The young girl in here, Nutsa Kukhianidze, is intriguing new face, as was the case with Isabelle Corey in ""Bob.""

Using double and triple fakes, Bob throws the police into a frenzied chase to find out exactly what he's up to, who's being double-crossed by whom, why he's spending all of his time with a pretty young immigrant named Anne (the lanky but lusty Nutsa Kukhianidze), and where he plans to be on the night of the big theft.

Of course he's right under their noses, with tons of witnesses and cameras. Nobody could've planned it better than Bob Montagnet.

***********************************************************************************

A great cast and good acting by all made this a very watchable heist flick.

Although the plot has been over done in Hollywood (good thief going straight after one last job), Nick Nolte's characterization of Bob and all his follies made for an enjoyable flawed character study (someone who's getting old, still shoots heroin, fights with local club owners, but has a heart of gold).

Problems with the film are relegated to the film's editing and terrible level of volume during some pivotal moments. It was often times difficult to hear Bob talking with one person or another, especially during the planning stages of the heist, which made it very frustrating for me. I wanted to know WHAT was going on without turning my TV up to full-blast.

As others here have mentioned too, the editing of the film has problems. I'm not sure if this WAS an editing problem or a transfer to DVD issue, but at the end of each scene there was a half-a-second freeze frame that became maddening to watch.

 Nolte gives his finest performance in years. Neil Jordan pays enormous respect to - and has fun with the classic French film Bob La Flambeur. Without knowing what ""Thief"" was about, I began watching it and getting strong feelings of deja vous only to realize what an IDIOT I was not to recognize the homage to the earlier film (and set in Monte Carlo as opposed to the original's Paris.) A film which has you routing for the bad guys, who are, of course, the best guys.

 Everyone is obviously having a terrific time and Jordan provides a terrific reign over this large ensemble that is the equivalent of a world class conductor at the helm of a great symphony - everything is full of nuance and balanced so well that even the most convoluted moments (which are some of the best) have a feel so perfect they seem natural.

His lines are delivered in a monotone; you get no sense whatever of any real persona.  I felt sad for Nolte as I watched it (not for more than 20 minutes, I must admit):  does he (Nolte) need to be in the hospital?

I don't know why Nolte seemed so less-than-usual, and I am sorry--but he is way not acting on this one.  I would give this movie a big zero, cause if you ain't got someone to identify with, you ain't got nothing.  If genuine feeling is lacking..why bother?",1091059200,,630,4.3247863247863245

Frankly, I don't care how Nolte managed to fit so seamlessly into this role, because it was amazing to watch.  Bob's life is in the pits, but there's also humanity in him; if you look past the haze of smoke, the shuffling walk, and the droopy eyes you see a gentleman, a person who would never behave cruelly to others.  Though the plot gets driven along by a heist on an art vault in Monte Carlo, the movie is also a complex character portrait of an old criminal.  The dialogue is entertaining, the soundtrack is excellent, and the supporting characters are sharply drawn and add a lot of color to Bob's seedy world.  My one complaint is that it can be difficult to understand Nolte's speech; he has a tendency to mumble and swallow his words, and although this is in keeping with his character, it can be frustrating for the viewer and will necessitate hitting the rewind button many times.",1089590400,2,1138,4.5588235294117645

Nolte stars as a junkie gambler who's also the most revered thief in town. The fact that he's a walking train wreck only adds to his grizzled charm. Ralph Fiennes pitches in a pretty convincing performance as an art dealer.
But I have a couple of gripes.
One, as with most European productions that are dubbed into English (or, as in this case, made originally in English) the vocalization of the dialogue sounds like a high school theater audition. The film has quite a whip-smart script, but verbally it sounds somewhat stilted. In particular the Bosnian actress whose voice sounds like she has a broccoli stuck in her larynx.
Second, the DVD has a problem.  Each scene ends in a very short fraction-of-a-second freeze frame. I thought this was a problem with my DVD player, or my specific disc, but it seems others have had similar problems.

When I bought this movie, I thought it was going to be something like Ocean 11, but it wasn't.  Instead, it tried to mesh too many different ideas at once.  I'd say the worst part about this movie had to do with the girl Nick Nolte was with.  What was her purpose, anyway?  No one really says why she is even in the movie.
There were times I thought this was a low budget movie.  In any case, this is a great movie if you want to feel depressed and feel that you're superior in that you could create something better.  But if you don't have that as your purpose, don't rent or buy it.

1895111,3,B00009WVT3,"The Good Thief falls flat on many levels, but the ending was strong enough that I can almost let that slide.  Nick Nolte and Tcheky Kayro both turn in strong performances, but Neil Jordan, under pressure, it seems, to justify his rendition of Bob Le Flambeur, throws in too many directorial bells and whistles.  But these only serve to distract from the more gentle and amusing eccentricities of the film (such as the performances of the Polish brothers).  Nutsa Kukhianidze is the requisite girl, and is particularly grating, like a sissified Luc Besson heroine.
Whatever problems I had with the film, the last reel at least partially succeeded in winning me back.  The climax in Monte Carlo is subdued, but there's an energy in the air.  Anyone (it probably helps if you're a degenerate gambler like myself) whose pulse quickens at the thought of donning an Italian suit and playing for high stakes in the salons of Monte Carlo. Nolte initiating Kukhianidze in this foreign world, the quiet, dignified panic always just underneath the pit crew's bored facade, flop sweat on the upper lip.

1895133,3,B00009WVT3,"Another movie another heist as some critic once said. Is it just that really? After all, this being a N. Jordan film and with N. Nolte in the driving seat in the cast, a high class European setting and other smaller aces up the director's sleeve it should be a definite winner.

  It's not though. By the time the elaborate and concocted plot finally reveals its twist in the end, it's not a sure bet whether you'd have cared enough to stay along for the ride.
  Contrary to earlier Jordan films which have always been rich character movies this one rather lacks in that direction. To be more precise, the Nolte character (a big time gambler and junkie living the high life in the French riviera) is yes, very developed but everyone around him is paper-thin at best.
  This is exactly why the ""Good thief"" can be watched with ease assuming you're spending a night in with nothing better to do but it's no movie that will scar your mind and which you'll never forget. Far from.
  It's pop corn stuff for the more advanced viewers (and pop corn consumers) if i may put it that way.
  Sure, Nolte is a treat to watch as he takes on his role with particular comfort (no doubt aided by the experience in his own life) but that doesnt come out enough in the end. The plot weaves and unravels constantly but since the other characters will leave you totally indifferent it won't be easy for the plot to keep you gripped.
  Not one of Jordan's strongest efforts and yet this is by no means a bad film. Still, it's one destined to rather gather dust in video-store shelves in the not so  distant future.",1078272000,,1594,4.414383561643835
1895134,4,B00009WVT3,"I am not afraid to admit that I think Nick Nolte is one of the most overrated actors of his generation, but I think that he was really good in ""The Good Thief"", because he was playing someone so close to himself in real life. A burnt out junkie who is closer to the end of his career than the beginning seems to fit him perfectly.
This movie is a heist movie to begin with, and director Neil Jordan shoots it with the appropriate glitz and glamour that a film set in Monte Carlo deserves. He nails the atmosphere, giving the movie a dark, jazzy feel, mixing the styles of the classic films noir and the new reinvention of the style. The plot is good, as it is filled with twists and turns, as any good heist flick should. One thing that should be mentioned is the chemistry between all the characters. The cast is completely European, save Nolte, yet they mesh incredibly well together. The relationship between Bob and Roger the police officer is one of the movie's centerpieces, and their mutual respect and odd friendship is completely believable without too much explanation. Also good in this movie is the girl who plays Anna, and I won't even attempt to spell her name, because it could take up to an hour to get it right. She is as throaty as she is innocent, yet there is an obvious dark side to her character, one that often shines brighter than the innocence of a seventeen year old runaway.
Aside from the crime side of the movie, ""The Good Thief"" is about rebirth, in all of the characters. They are all ressurecting themselves from their past lives, trying to make good on the lives that still lay ahead of them. All in all, this is a good movie, and should entertain most people who are into this genre until the exciting end.",1077148800,2,1740,4.423676012461059
1895135,3,B00009WVT3,"Loosely based on Jean-Pierre Melville's noir classic, ""The Good Thief"" offers much for the fans of the genre, but little for the fans of the star Nick Nolte's ""48hrs"".  The film is slow-moving, and the stress is given on the characters, not the actions, so don't expect any Walter Hill-like machismo touch here.
Neil Jordan's newer version follows basically the same plot of the orginal.  It is about Bob, aging gambler living in the French Riviera, and is constantly under the influence of some substance.  While he rescues a Russian girl Anne one night, and finds himself utterly broke, he takes another (and the last) chance to do heist, this time a very big one.  He collects  unique members to do this job, but French cop Roger (Tcheky Karyo) is always watching him, knowing that something is going on.
Jordan gives a twist to the story of the original ""Bob le Flambeur,"" but the French film is also influenced by American noirs like ""Asphalt Jungle,"" and here and there in ""The Good Thief"" you will find what you saw in these old heist films -- a lady, a thwarted plan, and so on.  Neil Jordan follows the rules very carefully, but I am afraid too carefully to really engage us.
But the picture itself is beautifully done, capturing the glowing lights of Monte Carlo casinos or the dangers hidden behind the feebly-lit streets at night.  (The photographer is Oscar-winner Chris Menges, ""The Mission"" ""The Killing Field"" and others)  The moody images are one of the assets of the film, so is the strong acting of Nick Nolte as Bob.
The support is interesting, if not always great.  Tcheky Karyo can be as bad and evil as he wants (see ""Kiss of the Dragon"") but he shows unexpected tenderness here, like in ""The Core.""
You see a cameo of Ralph Fiennes, but his role is too small to need special mention, and so is Said Taghmaoui, who was so impressive in French film ""Hate.""  Emir Kusturica (himself a director of ""Arizona Dream"" and ""Underground"") is not bad as a comic relief, a high tech guy Vladimir playing rock guitar.  As Anne Nutsa Kukhianidze, though obviously she needs more training for acting, is very seductive and sexy enough.
So, ""The Good Thief"" is a good noir, but that is all I can say.  I find the film needs stronger driving force for any characters involved -- I don't think I saw much of Bob's character as gambler in the film -- but as noir that's ok.  Just good.",1076889600,3,2390,4.582159624413146

The original was a noir classic, and all about style, but a style that helped tell the story in a bold, new way, and a movie that helped to jump start the French New Wave Cinema to come. Well, this movie is all about style too, but again, it is style for the sake of telling the story....and this is an incredible fresh and new take on storytelling....a familiar story, but told with such a confidence and a visual flair that it makes it a joy to watch the story slowly unfold.

1895137,2,B00009WVT3,"The Good Thief is a new take on Jean-Pierre Melville's celebrated 1955 film Bob le Flambeur. Comparisons are said to be odious, and the critic's first commandment is to review the film at hand, not compare it with something else. I've broken a few other commandments in my time, and I'm afraid this one is next. There is simply no way I can look at a remake of a film I'm fond of and not measure it against the original, so I won't try.
Bob le Flambeur has been described as a precursor of the French New Wave films of Truffaut, Godard, Resnais et al.: the dialogue and editing were naturalistic rather than stage-play-like, the cinematography was a major element in the film rather than just a recording device. In that sense, B. le F. was a precognition not only of the French New Wave but of the style of most ""serious"" films today.
Neil Jordan, the director and screenwriter, wants to keep our eyes glued to the screen. The cinematographer, Chris Menges, gives us gorgeous saturated colors. The streets of Nice and Monte Carlo glow in the Mediterranean sun. Neon lighting in nightclubs bathes their inhabitants in the hues of tropical fish. Visually, there's hardly a dull moment in The Good Thief, and the DVD transfer captures the vibrancy of the camera work to perfection.
B. le F. -- set in Paris, not the south of France -- had its own ocular poetry, though, that didn't try to punch you out. Its black-and-white cinematography featured exteriors of Place Pigalle in the wan light of dawn, a bleak analogue to the lives of the gamblers and small-time crooks who were the movie's subjects.
The Good Thief, like B. le F., is about a man who has something of a privileged background (both films are a little vague about this) who has wasted his life as a gambler. After taking several falls and doing prison time, Bob is now way past his prime with not much to show for it. Temptation knocks, in the form of a chance to lead a clever burglary at the casino in Monte Carlo.
Jordan has gone all out to make the story ""contemporary."" Besides the hot visuals and fluid camera movement, he has added ""now"" touches and sub-themes: drug addiction, North African rai music (lots of Cheb Mami on the soundtrack), a trans-sexual character, Christian symbolism (besides Bob, the title refers to the thief who was crucified next to Jesus), 12-step programs, art forgery, and of course lots of whiz-bang technology for the burglary scenes.
Not only is most of this flapdoodle uninteresting in itself; worse, it serves as a diversion from the character study that the original was and The Good Thief imagines itself to be.
That's a shame, because some of the casting is strong. Tcheky Karyo gives a compelling performance as the detective who is Bob's nemesis. The young actress Nutsa Kukhianidze, playing a too-old-for-her years waif who wanders into Bob's subterranean world and gets enmeshed in it, is much better than her counterpart in B. le F.
But the portrayal of the central character (Nick Nolte) is about as wrong as it could be. An odious comparison is unavoidable. In Melville's film, Roger Duchesne captured our feelings and our imagination because he was a tragic figure in the classical sense -- a hero with a fatal flaw. Duchesne as Bob retained touches of elegance and gentility, as well as an inward quality. Nolte has been required by the script (and probably by his own acting tendencies as well) to keep showing us what a sorry loser he is.
We watch him go through a drug withdrawal, let us in on what a scammer he is, show us such pure cynicism that we don't buy into the supposed repentence suggested by the movie's title. It's all spelled out for us; there's nothing left to draw us into the character. To take one example: in B. le F., when Bob goes on a winning streak in the casino, he hands the croupier a big tip. In The Good Thief, he does the same but announces to his companion that it's one of his Rules for High-stakes Gambling: ""Always tip the croupier.""
Here's one of my rules for moviemaking: ""Don't just give us something to watch. Let us meet your characters half-way."" I'm sure Jordan studied Melville's film carefully, but that's one element he seems to have missed.",1068163200,6,4199,4.645161290322581
1895138,3,B00009WVT3,"Neil Jordan's filmography includes some memorable films (The Crying Game, Interview with the Vampire, End of an Affair). It also includes some films that stirred controversy (In Dreams, Butcher Boy). The Good Thief does not belong to any of those two categories, which is not good. On the other hand, it might be not that bad after all.
Without revealing the important parts of the story, The Good Thief is a heist movie without any heist. Bob (Nick Nolte) is an aging heroin addict and gambler, currently on a losing streak. As a result, he easily accepts the proposition of an old friend to participate in a big heist in a Monte Carlo Casino (The French Riviera offers ideal locations for the movie). While forming the group of people to assist him in his heist plans, he has to be careful of a cop following him (Tcheky Karyo), and at the same time, look after Anne, a Russian girl (Nutsa Kukhianidze) he saved from the man she was previously working for.
The problem of The Good Thief is that, as a heist movie, it cannot offer many original moments, but just original, stylish, I may add, ways to present the moments, common in all heist movies. In any case, as every heist movie that respects itself, it includes its twists and surprises. There is the loyal friend, the traitor, the girl, characters that you find in every film of the kind. But still, this one is different. It does not focus on the action (well, there is a car chasing scene, but, alas, with a comic conclusion), but on the characters. As a matter of fact, one of the most interesting points of the movie is the relationship between the thief and the cop, who may be Bob's only true friend.
The cast is international, with actors coming from many different countries. In small roles, you can find the excellent Bosnian director, Emir Kusturica, in a part that offers comic relief, along with Ralph Fiennes, who has just a few minutes of screen time, but manages to make us notice his presence. Still, Nick Nolte is the man that carries the film. He seems to be in every scene, his presence reassuring and confident. It is as if Nolte is getting better as he is getting older...
Special mention should be made to the soundtrack that blends ethnic, jazz with songs from Leonard Cohen and Bono.",1067299200,,2265,4.58128078817734

The story becomes unforgiveably lame in the third act, as the plans unravel and coincedentally fix themselves in unlikely and silly ways that have nothing to do with the actions of the protagonist, as he is busy getting very, very lucky at the casino while everyone else does the interesting stuff. Worth a rent for the cinematography alone, but not one destined for my permanent collection.",1066953600,,589,4.841584158415841
1895140,3,B00009WVT3,"***1/2 Set on the scenic French Riviera, Neil Jordan's ""The Good Thief"" is a remake of 1955's ""Bob Le Flambeur,"" a Gallic film that enjoyed a successful re-release in this country a few years back. This new version is a stylish caper film about an aging master criminal who comes out of retirement to help lift some priceless paintings from a Monte Carlo casino.
In terms of plotting, there is little that we haven't seen in this type of film before.  First, there's the idea for the heist, then the wooing of the reluctant ""reformed"" criminal, then the gathering of the other participants, then the intricate planning and rehearsing for the job, followed by the inevitable double dealing and double crosses, and ending with the sly turnabout ending to set our heads spinning and make us question everything we have seen heretofore.  But Jordan has a knack for turning the ordinary into the extraordinary, and this he accomplishes with a complex screenplay, a strong sense of atmosphere, a host of well-developed characters, a sly sense of humor and an assortment of first-rate performances from a talented cast.  Nick Nolte is superb as Bob, a shrewd, world-weary thief who is also a compulsive gambler and drug addict.  Needless to say, the role seems tailor made for the star.  Most of the rest of the cast is made up of French or Eastern European actors, all of whom do a fine job in their assorted roles.
Actually, the only complaint I have about the film is a direct result of that largely international cast.  Much of the film's dialogue is hard to understand due in large part to the very thick accents emanating from most of the actors.  Even the one native English speaker, Nolte, is difficult to comprehend at times, but that's just because Nolte is simply being Nolte and we expect to miss half of what he is saying anyway.
Apart from that, ""The Good Thief,"" less polished and slick than movies like ""Ocean's Eleven,"" offers top-notch entertainment for the hardcore heist film aficionado.",1063411200,,2000,4.796511627906977
1895141,5,B00009WVT3,"Neil Jordan has done it again!  THE GOOD THIEF is another one of those truly excellent films that for some reason didn't make it in the theaters.  Perhaps it takes too much concentration from an audience ready for a blowup blaster heist of a story.  That is here, but it it is delivered in so sophisticated a manner that the actual casino caper is secondary to the quality of the story, and characters who populate it.  Set on the Riviera, Nick Nolte stars as a 'has been' con man who apparently decides to have one last fling - but to do so he has to shake his herion addiction and clean up his past a bit.  This done, he encounters an assembled cast of characters that are each interesting and well acted, from a beautiful newcomer who plays the sole love interest to an arachnophobic body builder undergoing a sex change.  The police are for once treated as interesting individuals instead of chumps, the plans for the heist are laid out in a spellbinding way, and the whole planned caper is photographed in stylish camerawork which includes mesmerizing freeze frames that keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat.
If you can figure out the ending before it happens then you will be among the few!  Jordan paces this excellent film so well that it packs a wallop and all along the way he offers little asides that make you laugh and make you identify with the incredible assortment of people he has created and directed,

He now counts the local police inspector, Roger (Tcheky Karyo), among his good friends. But Bob has run out of money, and an old friend named Raoul (Gerard Darmon) has an idea for a grand heist. Crooks have been trying to figure out how to steal the 80 million francs in the safe at Monte Carlo's Casino Riviera for a long time, to no avail. But Bob and Raoul want  to steal the casino's artwork instead...while giving the impression that they are out to crack the safe. They assemble a team of specialists to do the job. But they must make sure that Roger, whose suspicions have been aroused, is on the wrong trail. The plan is complicated when one of the conspirators, Paolo (Said Taghmaoui), falls in love with Anne (Nutsa Kukhianidze), a young Russian woman of somewhat ill repute whom Bob has befriended, and whose drug dealer and ex-boyfriend both want information about the heist.
""The Good Thief"" was written and directed by Neil Jordan. It is a loose remake of the 1955 French film ""Bob le Flambeur"". This is a moody, complex and human heist film. Nick Nolte is superb as the down-but-never-quite-out Bob. He lies; he cheats; he steals; he shoots heroin; he cleans up; he loves art; he protects the weak; he's smart; he's senseless; he's fascinating, and he's lovable. He's a good guy who is an incorrigible thief. The supporting performances are all excellent, including a small role for Ralph Fiennes as an art dealer of questionable scruples. The film takes place on the French Riviera, mostly in the seedier quarters of Nice, but also exhibits its share of glamour in the casinos of Monte Carlo and riviera race tracks. The film's editing seemed at first to be a little disjointed, but once I settled into it I realized that it has a method and found that the editing enhanced the film's tone considerably. The film's cinematography and soundtrack are brooding. The characters are seductive. The story is sinuous. But somehow in the end it is all uplifting. ""The Good Thief"" is a cliched caper flick in its assemblage of a motley crew of characters, each with his own talent, to pull off a grand heist. But the cliches stop there. This film dwells on the relationships between the characters, in particular Bob, the good thief, Roger, his friendly nemesis, and Anne,  a bereft teenager who is wanted by too many people. I was disappointed to find that ""The Good Thief""'s soundtrack is not available. I loved the gritty, brooding French-English songs, which impart a strong sense of place as well as mood. ""The Good Thief"" isn't at  all action-oriented, but I give it my highest recommendation to admirers of heist films and great performances.",1062028800,2,2772,4.723140495867769

7993859,5,B00009WVT3,THE GOOD THEIF is quite a refreshing pleasure. It could easily be described as another highly stylized capper film but it is quite a bit deeper than that assessment. It is strongly character based with many participants who are themselves all quite quirky with Nick Nolte at the hub of this ensemble who is in fact the catalyst of a very intriguing but vague plot line. Even Nolte's character is that of a very vague art thief whom we really know nothing about yet he entices you and keeps you just interested enough before the bottom drops out. This is quite a mesmerizing film and to tell too much about it would just be telling too much! Take my word for it that this is one absolutely brilliantly orchestrated film that should leave you quite satisfied.,1421452800,,757,4.573529411764706
