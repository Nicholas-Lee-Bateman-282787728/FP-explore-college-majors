8542445,4,B009KFA32Q,"DVD Review: I don't know how long this company is out of business (Universe) but they were okay, I guess. *Shruggs* Anyways if you own a Widescreen TV then the picture won't fit/ It's smaller than usual. Picture quality is good but the sound is suspect.

Movie Review: I'm not much into Fantasy Fu movies but Zu was excellent and that's because of Tsui Hark's genius. Very different and original from any Fantasy Fu movies ever made.

Conclusion: 3 stars for the DVD and 4 1/2 for the movie!",1421712000,,491,4.50561797752809
