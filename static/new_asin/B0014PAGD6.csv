8256157,1,B0014PAGD6,"I bought this for my step daughter as gift, because Panic! At the disco is her favorite band. Imagine her disappoint when, after putting in the dvd, first thing that comes up on the screen that there are no actual  Panic! At the disco songs on the disc. And it just went downhill from there. Do not buy.",1409356800,,303,4.224137931034483

8256159,1,B0014PAGD6,"I wasn't aware this film was not associated with the members of Panic! at all until it showed up on my doorstep. I'm not happy AT ALL with it. I plan to talk to customer service to see if I can return it. If you are a huge fan of Panic!, like me, you could already find the information in the film because it has been publicized a bunch over tumblr and other places on the internet. It isn't interesting nor enticing. Save yourself the money and don't buy this!",1332028800,5,461,4.133333333333334
8256160,1,B0014PAGD6,"No Panic music at all in this DVD. If you're a Brent Wilson fan, you will love this. Otherwise, don't bother.",1222732800,7,109,4.238095238095238
8256161,4,B0014PAGD6,"This is an hour long documentary of the band up until after the release of A Fever You Can't sweat Out. I reccommend this DVD to all Panic! fans. I thought I knew everything about them until this documentary showed me more. It really makes you appreciate how talented they are for such a young age. A must-buy for their fans. The only complaint I have abut it is it does not contain any of their music and does not feature interviews of the band members, although they do interview their music video director Shane Drake, the circus members, ex band member Brent wilson, school teachers, and the studio director who helped them with their practices and auditions.",1214092800,13,663,4.627118644067797
8256162,4,B0014PAGD6,"This is not a bad product. considering no members of Panic appear, and they cannot use their music. They do talk to the members of the Circus group that appears with Panic. Also music video director Shane, and Brent.",1213488000,2,216,4.564102564102564
