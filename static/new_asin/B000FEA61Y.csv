There's no monsters or vampires...this time Santo is going after ruthless kidnappers wearing goofy rubber masks and behave rather clumsy! It has all what you're looking for... cheezy stunt action, wrestling matches, goofy jokes, some very bad acting and hot sexy Latina women that will make your mouth drool! There's a hot dance scene on Chapter 5 where one of the actresses is doing a steamy bump and grind dance in a tiny bikini that will make you melt and leave your mouth open!! but sorry guys she doesn't strip so no nudity here! :(
The  DVD box says it's in black and white but it's actually in color! It doesn't say what year the movie was produced but I'm guessing in the mid 70s? Also too bad there were no credits at the end of the movie all it says is ""Fin"" and that's it! So you really don't know the names of the other people in the movie and that's unfortunate! It's in Spanish with no English subtitles! The quality of the picture is fine! Get this action movie if you are a serious Santo fan! You will have no regrets!",1301616000,3,1166,4.348623853211009
