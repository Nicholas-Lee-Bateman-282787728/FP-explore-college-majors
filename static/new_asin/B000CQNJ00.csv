8100716,4,B000CQNJ00,"What impressed me right away was the fun these hosts are having with the Japanese language. I've taken so many courses where the instruction was just really dry and flat, it was so cool to get this DVD where people are actually having a good time teaching and speaking Japanese!

That said, this isn't an instructional video for beginners, but for someone like me who's had a little bit of Japanese instruction already and wants to move to the next step of talking like you know what you're saying! My Japanese friends tell me they sometimes hear the same things over and over from beginners, so I definitely won them over with the phrases from How To Impress Your Japanese Friends.

I prefer Keiko much more than Chie, and George (the main host) tries to have fun with them both, but I think Keiko ends up being more fun. I also liked that the hosts were mostly native speakers of Japanese so it was real-life conversation, not textbook.",1159228800,2,938,4.5773809523809526
8100717,1,B000CQNJ00,"I've watched this DVD several times, and each time I am more impressed with just how bad it is.  The production quality is terrible, with erroneous noises, shaky shots, and sloppy editing that rivals a bad home movie.  That the authors didn't re-take some of these episodes conveys a true disregard for their work, if you could call it that.

But okay, who cares about the production quality--how are the lessons?  How much Japanese will you learn?  I for one would gladly watch a poorly produced show if it improved my skills.  But if that's what you want, this isn't the product.  The shows introduce words more or less at random, with no structure or reinforcement.  The phrases provided are often useless, or just plain stupid.  You'll learn how to endear yourself to the elderly by saying ""I don't speak pre-war Japanese,"" and how to combine English and Japanese to create a hilarious joke:  ""excuse me masen.""  A real rib-splitter.

Basically, this DVD is 238 minutes of a gaijin acting dumb and annoying while his Japanese co-hosts look bored.  If you want to see how not to act (in Japan or anywhere else), then this would be a good start.  There's no learning plan, in the sense of organized instruction that might help you to acquire and retain the language.  The entertainment, such as it is, consists of such stunners as filling a water glass to overflowing and pointing out a palm tree while driving.

I also went to the YesJapan website and reviewed the courses, which are of less value than an average textbook, and no more interesting or motivating.  I will say, however, that the marketing is very good.  The YesJapan products look great from the outside.  Too bad they're not.",1153094400,10,1694,4.720136518771331
8100718,5,B000CQNJ00,"No one learns how to swim by being thrown into a pool.  I jumped into a pool when I was 4 years old.  I lashed around for a bit, but my wild movements couldn't keep me afloat.  I sank.  I was completely immersed in the pool.  It was a good thing my dad noticed my daredevil antics or else I wouldn't be here today.  I eventually learned how to swim with the help of a swim instructor.  The first thing I learned was blowing bubbles in the pool.  It was fun, and when I completed the program I could swim!

The show format on YesJapan's DVD reminds me so much of the instruction style that helped me become a swimmer -- it is fun and you don't completely submerge until you are ready for it.  For most segments, George will have a japanese conversation with a co-host who is a native speaker.  He'll break off to explain some parts in English, but a few parts are left unexplained.  Vocabulary and cultural notes sometimes pop up.  Subtitled translations are used in some portions too, but a good portion is left RAW and Untranslated.  I've found this balance to be most helpful in my language learning.  I've used complete immersion software before going with YesJapan.  I found complete immersion software to be extremely frustrating and boring to boot.  I tried learning the language by watching Japanese shows with English subtitles.  All I learned from that was how to read English really quickly.

I recommend this DVD to anyone interested in Japanese Language or Japanese culture.  There is a good dose of music by talented Japanese underground artists infused throughout the shows.  George and friends have interesting personalities and many of the things they talk about aren't found in any Japanese language books I know of.  The segment ""A Day with Satsuki"" gives a really nice look into the interior of a Japanese home.  This disc is a good value.  Learning another language takes a lot of work, but YesJapan knows that work doesn't have to be boring.",1137715200,5,1962,4.620289855072464
8100719,5,B000CQNJ00,"Expand your Japanese learning outside of the typical text books. One of the more difficult tasks in learning Japanese is listening and understanding the spoken language. Other than living in Japan, there are very few tools to hone your listening skills. This DVD is  perhaps the next best thing to living in Japan.

Through light-hearted situations and humorous dialogs, one is not only entertained but educated about Japan, Japanese, and George.",1137628800,3,446,5.267605633802817
8100720,5,B000CQNJ00,"I was looking for a fun way of learning japanese. So I saw this DVD and said what the heck. I am happy I did I never knew learning could be so fun !!! The guy George is really funny!!! But what amazes me how this guy teaches japanese and has great time doing it. Like I was watching the ""Date with Keiko"" episodes. While George is talking with his friend Keiko in a park he falls off the little ride and I laughed. But as soon as he fell the word in Japanese came across the screen. But by the end of the episode I learn how to say ""I fell"" in japanese. I mean it was fun and I learned a lot. Then the ""Tricks to Sound Good in Japanese"" was so cool because your learn how to sound like YOUR really japanese. I loved the quizzes at the end of the episodes too!!! I caught myself watching episodes making sure I remembered words and subtitles for the quizzes. I am a beginner and I thought I could not learn so much and have a great time doing it. If you want to exapnd your horizons in Japanese get this DVD. It takes from the US to Japan !!! Check it out !!! It is over 2 hours long !! I saw my 1st japanese band Guitar Vader and they rocked!!! Check it out !!!",1137628800,3,1161,3.9029535864978904

8100722,5,B000CQNJ00,I love this DVD! Not only does it teach Japanese but it is extremely funny as well. I watch it at least 2 times per week because I miss watching it so much.

8100723,5,B000CQNJ00,"From the website which has become a staple for students of the Japanese language comes the release of their debut DVD. A compilation release of classic shows the DVD depicts some of the reasons that so many people tune into each new episode.

The core of the disk lies with the George and Keiko Online Japanese Topics Show. Here the lovely Keiko and the ever joking George discuss first various techiniques for sounding better in Japanese with out actually being better, more in the way of mannerisms and proper body language. The next episode is tricks to impress your Japanese Friends. This episode focuses more on the words and grammar which while seeming seemingly very advanced can be used to add some flare to your conversations.  This show also includes  a performance by four of YesJapans premiere bands Smack Da Booty, Samurai Delicetessen, Guitar Vader and Yonbunnoichi making it an extra value to the dvd.

  The next to episodes are in are parts 1 and 2 of a date with Keiko. George somehow convinces the Keiko to go on a date with him ( in jest ) and the results are filmed with hilarious results.

  Supporting the G&K show is The George VS Chie battle show in which George challenges the fiery Chie to decide who can come up with the best words for the chosen topic.  The first topic is how to brush people off in japanese with uot seeming rude. The second is easily one of my faveriot shows ever, The Valley of Fire Road show. Here the crew set off for the valley of fire and we see some tension develop and sparks fly amid the beautiful scenery and spectacular views.

 Last and not least is the Japan Special - A Day with Satsuki , a god episode where George follows Satsuki around as she explains the various things in her home as well as taking a trip to her families farm to see the animals. This is by far one of the best shows from an education stand point as it gives you insight into how an actual japanese person might live and also teaches many words that would not be covered in the run of the mill college class.

 The Bonus features for the DVD are just that wonderful bonuses which make it such an ideal bargain there are two music videos form the band Guitar Vader as well and a set of audition tapes from one of the shows he was working on at the time.

Somehow Mr. George even managed to sneak in a few easter eggs for those eager enough to find them *you've got to be eager Those buggers are hidden well *

  All this together lends itself to a DVD release which is sure to entice many new members to join the site and perhaps encourage a few people to take up and active interest in the Japanese Language and at 19.95 this is definatley a must buy for any who are already interested.",1136851200,4,2719,4.361111111111111
8100724,5,B000CQNJ00,"This is a great DVD for anyone interested in Japanese. Not only is it educational (full of great tips and vocabulary) but it is very entertaining. There are definitely some laugh out loud moments on this DVD. I especially enjoyed ""Date with Keiko Parts 1&2"". Also, ""Tricks to Sound Good in Japanese"" is really helpful. You will be missing out if you don't get this DVD. Worth the price because of the educational value, worth your time because of the entertainment value.",1136851200,4,471,4.7560975609756095
8100725,5,B000CQNJ00,If you are looking for a fun way to learn Japanese you have to get this DVD. I've been a member of the web-site for close to a year. I can't recommend it any more. I have two words for you....multiplication table....,1136851200,3,216,4.166666666666667
