419903,3,6302075629,"As mentioned in other reviews, this is the same movie as The Next Man. Reading the reviews under that title as well, I was well prepared for the poor technical quality. More about that in a moment. By the way, one review said that the movie had been cut to 90min. My DVD player showed that it is 108min long (at least under the Arab Conspiracy title), as advertised.

If you can get past the quality issues, I think the movie is reasonably entertaining. To be honest though, I like killer-chick movies and Cornelia Sharpe makes a pretty good femme fatale. I saw it maybe 20-years ago and the ways she ""does"" her victims has haunted me ever since.

I was able to buy this copy new through one of the Amazon partner vendors for just $1.50 plus shipping, so I felt I could live with the technical issues. Lest you be unduly alarmed by the other reviews, I will quantify the problems: The print appears to be faded and has a lot of scratches in places. There is video noise comparable to a mediocre-quality VHS. The audio is akin to the non-hifi tracks on a VHS, with somewhat poor high and low frequency response and significant hiss. It was watchable, though. Turning up the color on the monitor helped the faded print a lot.

All in all I think it is worth watching. Having Sean Connery stalked by a beautiful chick is a novelty. The plot does have you guessing a little. There is some action. Surprise ending.",1267228800,4,1409,4.4324324324324325
419904,5,6302075629,"It's that opening scene that grips me: A female spy seduces an ambassador in a top floor room of his hotel, then smothers him with a plastic bag. Other operatives break in and throw his assistant out the window. Sean Connery is the Arab ambassador that wants to negotiate peace between the Arabs and Isrealis, but OPEC oil cartel members oppose the plan because it might drive oil prices down. They hire our spy (Cornelia Sharpe) to assasinate him. A detective uncovers the plan but he is too late to stop it. This film is so relevant to our current situation in the middle east and to explain some of the roots of terrorism. Are Arabs villainized? No,
only terrorism itself. And solutions are offered to those open to many of its underlying themes.",1213574400,4,749,4.597014925373134

419906,2,6302075629,"It would be understandable if this pathetic movie were made in the late 1950s before Sean Connery became a major star.  Somehow, though, he agreed to be involved in this mess in 1976.  Did the famous Scottish film idol have serious financial trouble?  Was Connery possibly blackmailed?  Not only is he the only leading actor, but the film's overall production values are not even equal to a badly made for TV special.  Connery plays the role of a top Saudi Arabian official who gets the permission of his government to form a working relationship with the Israelis.  They have the technical enterprise while the Saudis possess the oil.  Abstractly, this idea does indeed seem sensible.  Connery becomes the target of assassins who prefer to keep the power in the hands of OPEC.  Cornelia Sharpe is chosen to perform the dastardly deed.  Will she succeed?  More importantly, will Sharpe do so early in the story so that the suffering of the audience might be lessened?

Does anybody in their right mind really believe that the virulently anti-Semitic government of Saudi Arabia would ever seek to form a viable working relationship with Israel---even today?  This bizarre notion was completely laughable some thirty years ago.  Does this movie have a redeeming value?  Yes, it opens up with a now haunting scene of the World Trade Center against the Manhattan skyline.  Is there anything else?  I'm afraid not. It's all downhill after that.",1123286400,3,1439,4.953974895397489
