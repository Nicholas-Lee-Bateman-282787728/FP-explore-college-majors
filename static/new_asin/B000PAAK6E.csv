2814822,5,B000PAAK6E,George Sunday is really a Superhero from the planet Ultron.  This sitcom follows his adventures with his girlfriend trying to understand earth culture and customers. George is curious and innocent and so very funny.  A great britcom for your collection.,1187481600,6,253,5.3
2814823,4,B000PAAK6E,"I bought this DVD from Amazon several years ago. I'm reviewing it now because the other reviewers don't point out that this Season has one of the sweetest Christmas episodes ever! I loved the discussion between Janet and George about why Christmas dinner has to include food they don't really like. And George's attempt to make everyone happy by surprising them with gifts is touching. And I absolutely love the show's tired old Father Christmas. I watch it every year, and have loaned the DVD to friends and family.

I first saw this episode years ago on BBC America, and when I discovered I could buy a DVD that included this episode, I bought it just because of that. I don't find the other episodes quite as endearing (or enduring) but it was worth the money, if just for this annual Christmas treat.",1334534400,,804,4.6223776223776225

2814825,5,B000PAAK6E,"How many shows can be slapstick yet clever and intelligent at the same time?  Reminds me a bit of ""3rd Rick from the Sun,"" but with a flavor all its own.  I love this show and hope the BBC decides to share more with us in new DVD release.  A sublime mix of mock heroics and human comedy.",1317168000,,287,3.913793103448276
2814826,5,B000PAAK6E,"As I wrote in my review of Series One:

Ardal O'Hanlon is in classic form in My Hero. I can only describe his style as ""Father Dougal McGuire Meets Superman"" in that he has many of the same traits as his classic role in the hilarious ""Father Ted"" series - a gormless but lovable simpleton.

In this series, he is somewhat brighter than his classic role as Dougal, but due to his unfamiliarity with Earth customs (due to being a REAL alien!) and an apparently native ""Ultronian"" tendency towards telling the unvarnished truth at all times, or (in the case of having misunderstood instructions from his cousin Arnie or someone) getting the wrong end of the stick, he is screamingly funny in his miscues, inadvertently insulting or discomfiting all and sundry -- including his long-suffering girl-friend, her mother, and co-workers.

There are interesting and zany elements of other ""space alien"" comedies, including the ""Mork and Mindy"" series, but Ardal and his colleagues bring their own brand of charm to the mix.

I unreservedly recommend this to all lovers of British (and Irish!) comedy. Ardal is brilliant!",1311897600,,1111,4.956989247311828
2814827,5,B000PAAK6E,"I have just finished watching the second season of My Hero. It is very funny and at least as, if not funnier than, the first season.

The writers do a great job in how the dialog is presented so that George can misunderstand what is being said in hilarious ways. This is not exactly sophisticated comedy and is sometimes a little silly, but it is always very funny.

Two of my favorite characters in the series are Tyler and Mrs. Raven. Tyler is a real nutcase, but harmless. That Mrs. Raven is amusingly wicked, and her hair is so bizarre - is it a bad wig from a clothes dummy from the 1960's or do they do that to her real hair? The British always put in details like this that just work so well.

There are further seasons, but I don't think they have been released - hope that changes very soon.",1303344000,2,800,4.215686274509804
2814828,5,B000PAAK6E,"Thanks for the great service and product.  ""My Hero"" needs to be viewed by others, as it seems to be somewhat unknown with American viewers...  these episodes are original, creative, and very funny.  Thanks again!",1281139200,,213,5.0285714285714285

2814831,5,B000PAAK6E,"I am a big fan of ""Britcoms"" in general, and this is one of my favorites.  I wish they would hurry and release Season 3.  I saw some of those episodes on BBCAmerica, but it's been ages since they've been on.  I can't wait to see them again!",1238112000,,240,3.9583333333333335

2814834,5,B000PAAK6E,"I love this show. I was lucky enough to accidentally come across it on PBS one night, and have been watching ever since.
This is the best Brit comedy I've seen, since ""The Good Neighbors""!
If I have any complaints it would have to be that there are only 7 shows in a season.",1215302400,,274,4.092592592592593
2814835,5,B000PAAK6E,"Brilliant stuff! MY HERO keeps on with its hilarious lampooning of the superhero mythos. This is the second season (or series), and while I've already had repeat viewings of these episodes on PBS, I must say that, even now, they are still never less than marvelously entertaining. I just saw them again on this dvd, and again laughed myself silly. Our superhero from the planet Ultron, Thermoman, is still haplessly befuddled by Earthly customs, and still tends to take things too bloody literally. Translation: Thermoman is still pure gold when it comes to the funny bits.

Thermoman doesn't really have a gallery of evil masterminds, although he does get a supervillain of sorts in the form of an old classmate (in ""Nemesis""). Instead Thermoman can be found averting natural disasters and fetching take-out meals for himself and Janet from all over the globe. The fun thing about MY HERO is that its premise is all about how an all-powerful superhero copes with mundane, everyday stuff. The show wallows in a Douglas Adams-ian sense of the ridiculous, specifically in the series's introduction of bizarre Ultron traditions. However, the themes touched on are universal enough to draw in everyone, while keeping very much within its British sensibilities. And, thru all the jokes and the poking fun of, the show never falters in its presentation of George and Janet as a couple truly in love. Yep, he's a costumed alien crimefighter and she's a normal girl from Northolt, England, but, amidst the wacky shenanigans, the show reveals a relationship being constantly worked on by these two, despite their innate differences. Or maybe I like this show so much, I'm reading stuff into it, giving credit where it isn't due? I dunno, except that I really dig George and Janet.

One thing is clear: even tame insults such as ""prat"" and ""git"" and ""pillock"" carry more weight by virtue of being uttered with a clipped British accent. Having said that, I must say that George's cousin Arnie, who has an American accent, in his war of putdowns with the acerbic and ever nasty Mrs. Raven, seems to deliver the more incendiary barbs (""Oh, it's your perfume. I thought it was the drains.""). These two have some venomous, howlingly funny exchanges.

The excellent cast is spearheaded by the very deadpanned Ardal O'Hanlon as George Sunday (aka Thermoman) and Emily Joyce, delightfully down-to-earth, as his lovely, long-suffering nurse girlfriend Janet Dawkins. Meanwhile, two very funny standouts from the supporting roles are Geraldine McNulty and Hugh Dennis as, respectively, the aforementioned receptionist Mrs. Raven and the self-infatuated Dr. Piers Crispin (""I am always here."").

So watch MY HERO, not just this season, but all the seasons. Learn the third law of the superhero code. Witness Ultron's sacred stance. See the desperately perilous and ancient Chang Ching challenge (which is strangely reminiscent of a children's game), and also what Ultrons do when they get depressed (Okay, they face into a corner and howl mournfully). The special effects may be on the shoddy side, but the show's not really about smoke and mirrors as much as it is about characters you grow to love, yes, even and especially characters who sniff the air a lot and then spends ages of time in the loo.

For those who care, the following has possible episode SPOILERS:

- Episode 1 - ""Christmas"" - George tries to get into the swing of Christmas, but is it really a surprise that he gets it all wrong?
- Episode 2 - ""Parents"" - Weary of her unpleasant parents constantly putting down George, Janet reveals to them that he's Thermoman. This is a horrible move.
- Episode 3 - ""Girlfriend"" - Just as Janet complains that her relationship with George has fallen into a rut, George's Ultron fiancee pops in, wanting to get married.
- Episode 4 - ""Car"" - George's dodgy cousin Arnie pleads with him to intercede with the Ultron High Council to reinstate his superpowers, but George is reluctant to do so (""Arnie, I trust you about as far I could throw you - if I was someone who couldn't throw people really well."").
- Episode 5 - ""Nemesis"" - Janet accompanies George to his school reunion, held at a sci-fi convention. There, George runs into an old school mate harboring a personal, deep-seated grudge.
- Episode 6 - ""Pregnant"" - Janet is pregnant. And so, to protect the baby, George temporarily grants Janet super powers, but then being more than human goes to her head.
- Episode 7 - ""Wedding"" - The episode title says it all, with an ending that had me in hysterics.",1214092800,9,4544,4.871927554980595

2814837,5,B000PAAK6E,"George Sunday, a.k.a Thermoman and his fiesty girlfriend Janet are back with a whole new series that includes everyone except George's shop assistant, Avril! Instead Tyler takes her place and acts so strange that everyone is driven away!
I luv My Hero xxx
Episodes:
""Christmas""-Hilarious! From the toy Thermoman to Santa, it's packed full of laughs. The second half isn't as good as the first, but it still has a few laughs.
Best Moment: Jason (the little kid who sees George as Santa and accuses Stanley of being nothing to do with Santa).
""Parents""- After George ruins the NADS' play, Janet placates her parents by telling them that George is really Thermoman.
Best Moment: Mrs Raven's fantasy after Ella tells her about George.
""Girlfriend"" -George's fiancee from Ultron comes along and insists on getting married.
Best Moment: George trying to put Xil off, but failing because of his genuinely helpful sweet character.
""Car"" - Janet's parents think George should be able to afford a car for Janet, and Arnie wants his powers back. George gets Arnie's powers restored so he can do rescues and George can make the health shop a success.
Best Moment: Ultronian depression, especially Janet (standing in the corner and howling).
""Nemesis"" - An Ultronian wants to ruin George's life for revenge and takes over Piers, becoming ""Miracle Man"".
Best Moment: Tyler giving the voices in his head a party. ""All right, lads, who wants to play Pass The Parcel?""
""Pregnant"" - Janet realizes she's pregnant and George gives her powers to protect their unborn child. Weakest episode on the DVD.
Best Moment: All on about the same level.
""Wedding"" - Janet's parents insist the baby be born in wedlock and George knows the Ultron Council would expect it of him, so George has to convince Janet to marry him.
Best Moment: George proposes in the Health Centre and all the patients start telling her what to say, especially the man. ""She'll never get anyone better, not with her weight problem.""
""I'm PREGNANT!""
I really do recommend this DVD.",1204588800,,2025,4.923976608187134
2814838,4,B000PAAK6E,"Series Two of My Hero has started to hit its stride.  While series one is great, the comic writing in series two is really coming into its own.  Lots of clever jokes and great timing on part of the cast.

A few reasons why I won't give it five stars: While in the first series, the plots were centered around Thermoman adapting to life on Earth, the second series has more farfetched plots and characters.  I personally enjoyed it more when the storyline was centered around every-day occurances.

The audio on the DVD is a bit dodgy as well.  There were some scenes where the sound fluctuates so much so, you have to keep raising and lowering the volume to be able to hear the dialogue correctly.

Also, and this is what bothers me most:  No extra features!!!  There is closed-caption and there is a section devoted to only three of the cast member's biographies, but the print on these biographies (mind you, I'm watching My Hero on a 42-inch plasma), is so small, I found it more rewarding looking up the cast on IMdB than trying to make out what the DVD said.  It would have been absolutely great to have bloopers and deleted scenes bonus footage...after all, it is a comedy, so there's bound to be some outtakes.  Director and cast commentary would have been great, too.  It's a shame that no real extra features come with this series.

Just the same though, keep My Hero coming out on region one for us Yanks, BBC!!!",1203120000,4,1422,4.4863813229571985
2814839,5,B000PAAK6E,My Hero is a laugh a minute.  Our family watches this over and over because the writing is hysterical and the performances simply over the top.

2814841,5,B000PAAK6E,"I introduced my family to this hilarious comedy by taping shows from PBS in 2003, which was a turbulent year for us. This show brought a welcome respite from the troubles. The biggest laugh of all came from the last episode on this disc, where the couple are forced to marry before the birth of their child.

What a fantastic surprise to find that all 7 episodes are in widescreen format (despite the packaging on the box and printed on the disc itself declaring full frame format).

So, keep 'em coming. Let's have season 3 already!",1196467200,14,533,4.541666666666667
