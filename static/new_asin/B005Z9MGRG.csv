4907502,4,B005Z9MGRG,"""If it's a man's world God wouldn't have made me.""  Danielle (Temple) lives life on her own terms.  When her mouth gets her in trouble at school she is sent to the ""special"" classroom.  After an assignment pairs her up with a school loser her life is forever changed.  The saying goes don't judge a book by it's cover, that could not be more true for this movie.  The first ten minutes is what you would expect but from then on it becomes an emotional movie that deals with some pretty heavy subjects.  The acting is great in this and there is an all-star cast along with some surprising cameos.  If I keep talking I am afraid I will give something away and that would do the movie an injustice.  Much like the movie ""Good Old Fashioned Orgy"" I think that the movie would get a better audience if the title was different.  Do yourself a favor and watch this movie.  Overall, a very surprising movie that was much much better then I expected. I give it an A-.",1326499200,15,958,4.301675977653631

  Too mature for younger teens for sure - hmm, wonder if that's why it's rated ""R"" ? :)

Highly recommend it for a movie with your bestie, your BFF, your mate, your chum, oh heck - anyone you can grab to sit still. I watched it solo but you miss so much by not missing it with someone to share this with !",1326499200,3,443,3.955056179775281
4907504,5,B005Z9MGRG,"I saw this movie in the theater and can't wait to get my own copy on DVD. Juno Temple and Jeremy Dozier are going to be major start and I can't wait to see the next movie Abe Sylvia directs.  The movie combines both comedy and drama, which is great since it lets the young actors show their range. The coming-of-age story set in a small town in Oklahoma deals with serious subject matters, but in a way that's not depressing - instead the story unfolds in a way that allows you to really connect with the characters and everything they go through.  As a bonus, the soundtrack is perfect!",1326412800,5,587,4.327272727272727
4907505,5,B005Z9MGRG,"Some time ago, I watched the trailer for ""Dirty Girl,"" and I told myself that I needed to see this film - it looked really funny. However, having finally watched the whole movie, my impression is now a little bit different. Yes, it is funny, as I saw in the trailer, but it switches to drama probably after the first half, and the result is just fascinating, a delightful surprise, a little undiscovered gem.

The story takes place in Norman, Oklahoma, in 1987, and we immediately meet Danielle (Juno Temple), an incredibly flirtatious and vivacious young lady that is attending high school. It seems that she is only interested in boys and having fun, and getting away with anything she wants. Her three Ds of dating are: discriminate, designate, and dump. However, her world begins to crumble when the principal calls her to his office, informing her that she was going to be removed from her regular class and dumped in the ""challenge"" class, which is attended by problematic students. She reluctantly has to accept the demotion - for a lack of a better word - and joins that group. There, she is assigned to work on a project with Clarke (Jeremy Dozier), another student, who happens to be fat and of her dislike. However, they do need to do that project or they will fail school, so they put their act together, and, in doing so, they discover and/or realize some of their problems and deep secrets. This search will take them to Los Angeles in a joint adventure, without their parents knowing about it. On the way, they share some hilarious moments as well as some sad ones -a true life-changing experience for all involved, including us.

""Dirty Girl"" will really surprise you. Mixing comedy and drama can be fatal most of the times, but director Abe Sylvia somehow does it successfully. This is a story about broken homes and dysfunctional families, and their long-term effects. It really touched me. Juno Temple and Jeremy Dozier are amazing, and the fantastic cast - Milla Jovovich, William H. Macy, Dwight Yoakam, and the always dependable Mary Steenburgen -- provide great support. The DVD includes commentary by the director and deleted and extended scenes. (USA, 2010, color, 90 min plus additional materials).

4907506,5,B005Z9MGRG,"DIRTY GIRL is a funny, ultimately touching, coming-of-age/road movie that undergoes a major shift in tone during its third act, and yet remains an extremely satisfying viewing experience.

Written and directed by Abe Sylvia, the film is set in ultra-conservative  Norman, Oklahoma in 1987, and centers on Danielle (Juno Temple), the high school tramp, who is paired on a class parenting project with fellow student Clarke (Jeremy Dozier), an overweight gay kid.

When Danielle's mother (Milla Jovovich) announces her engagement to her strict-minded Mormon boy friend (William H. Macy, in a role that should make Mitt Romney cringe), the girl decides to head for Fresno, California, to finally meet her biological father, and because he has a car and a credit card, she drafts Clarke to accompany her.
Unfortunately, that prized Cadillac belongs to Clarke's violent homophobic father (Dwight Yoakam), who goes after the couple, while his repressed wife (Mary Steenburgen) and Danielle's mom join forces to also bring their kids home.

DIRTY GIRL is a clever, witty, well-acted  ""gem,"" a true audience-pleaser.

[Watch that bag of flour.  It almost steals the show.]

Extras on the DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment include audio commentary by Abe Sylvia and deleted/extended scenes.

you have a self serving young lady thats going to do as she please and a gay guy that feels he don't fit in

4907582,5,B005Z9MGRG,"I loved everything about this movie. It was very funny, I laughed out loud (which I rarely do watching a movie). It had a deep and touching story and I really cared about the characters (which I always hope for in a movie, but rarely get). There was a lot of character development because the characters grew and changed (for the better).

I loved the gay character of Clarke, he was sweet and deep and touching and adorable and I really felt for him (and the actor who played him did an amazing job, I do not think that anyone could have done better).

I also loved the character of Danielle, she starts out as a ""dirty girl,"" but as the movie progresses, I understood why she was that way (she desperately wanted love and attention which she was not getting anywhere and so she was acting out) and it was wonderful to see her change through her friendship with Clarke (which was what she really needed, just someone to feel close to without sex), and after she was so hurt (by realizing that her dream father was not reality) she let her real self come through.

This movie made me smile, laugh, cry, it kept moving and held my attention, and the ending was so sweet and amazing, so this movie had everything that I love in a movie, and I actually cannot even think of anything negative to say about it. I also loved that this movie was set in the 80s, which is my favorite decade, I loved all of the 80s references, especially the music, which made me love this movie even more.

I totally recommend this movie.
It should have a different title, because the title is very misleading, and I almost didn't watch the movie just because the title threw me off.
I would have named it, ""Misunderstood Danielle.""",1420243200,3,1708,4.412698412698413

4907601,5,B005Z9MGRG,"I really enjoyed this movie for so many reasons, many of those reasons already mentioned in other reviews, but nonetheless this is a movie I would expose to young teenagers, since this movie embraces so many notions that EVERY teenager experiences:  being judged by other teens, harassed for the stupidest things when we are teens, living up to parents expectations, and coming to terms with sexuality, regardless of being straight or gay.  Along with these lessons, comes points on being self-honest, loving each other as friends, and perhaps one of the biggest lessons out of the movie is loving oneself and being unashamed of who we are and what we learn through adolescence.  the movie's primary duo of actors are excellent in their roles, being very emotionally attuned to the characters being played.  Although the title is misleading, this is a movie I would label right between PG13 and rated R.  the lessons at hand are appropriate for young teens to fathom, even though there is sensuality, implied sex, and vulgar language.  In fairness, though,all kids transcending from middle school to high school will, at some point, test the waters on all these notes, and bother their parents to no ends in the process, lol.....That being said, the appropriateness of the movie comes down to what you as a parent are comfortable with as far as giving your would-be-teenagers (or early teenagers) an idea of the messages and lessons your teen will experience over the course of high school, and even their college years, really.",1411084800,2,1528,4.972549019607843

Its laughs mostly stem from the easy banter from the film's two leads. But Dirty Girl has so much more going for it than laughs. It's a touching look at family and love, and what it takes to be a good mother, or friend, or partner. It's expertly acted by its entire cast, from the bold performances of its young leads, to the quiet and graceful performances of their deeply good but deeply flawed mothers.

Every character is obnoxious (especially Clark, whose weight is the very least of his defects), every actor is terrible (even ones who have been great in other movies), the story is completely unbelievable, the dialog consistently phony and contrived, the photography extremely clunky (with light coming from impossible sources), and the direction like a very bad soap opera, with not the tiniest bit of subtlety or credibility.

This movie is about as realistic as Pee-wee's Playhouse, but a whole lot less entertaining. I can't imagine what sort of people they are who've given this piece of garbage such great reviews. I hated it.",1399593600,6,756,5.138211382113822

I felt it was trying to pass off a deep story in a very shallow way. The character development was not good. I didn't care about any of the characters. It was suppose to be funny but it came off more as crass. The acting was so so and it's a really sad movie in very bleak way. It was not meaty enough to be considered a drama. The title makes the movie seem is going to be more sexual than it is.  Any May/December fanatic's might like it. I found it very disappointing.,1389916800,2,587,4.104347826086957

4907642,5,B005Z9MGRG,"This was definitely not what I expected.  It was much better.  Juno Temple, Jeremy Dozier, Milla Jovovich, William H. Macy, and Mary Steenburgen were fabulous in this eye-opening candid look at dysfunctional families and the destructive behavior it creates in the lives of the youngsters.  I was expecting a tongue-in-cheek comedy about the aches and pains of growing up...a genre I thoroughly enjoy a laugh from.  The film is highlighted by spectacular acting.  Juno is a diamond in the rough.  What a talent.  And her gay school buddy Jeremy Dozier is equally as effective.  I don't give away plots.  I just hand out kudos when deserved.  Yes, you'll laugh at the comedy.  Yes, you'll cringe at their behavior from time to time.  And yes, you'll shed a few tears as this unfolds into a LOUD statement of life in broken households.  I was laughing at myself for crying.  Does that make sense?  Then rent or get a copy of this fiick. It needs to be seen by the young and the old.  And don't let the DVD box fool you. It says in the rating box that there is graphic nudity.  There is not one single nude scene.  It is not needed and it would have taken away from development of characters.  I gave it a solid 10.  Juno Temple will someday be on the big stage as an Oscar nominee.  Once I saw this film, I ordered three more of hers in a starring role.  I can't wait to watch them.  What drew me to this film was Mary Steenburgen.  I saw ""Last Vegas' two week's ago and I was thoroughly impressed so I looked her up on the IMDB and started perusing her filmography.  This one struck a chord. I made a good choice.  But I CAUTION you.  It does contain profanity and some sick dialogue at the beginning.  But it fits the role(s) of the cast.  This is not a film for people who look down upon same-sex relationships.  However, I'd recommend it to those who don't understand L-O-V-E.

Dirty Girl at first blush appears to be yet another lowbrow high school comedy, but it quickly morphs into a very different animal. In 1987 Oklahoma, Danielle (Juno Temple), lives with her financially struggling single mom (Milla Jovavich in an atypical role). Danielle thinks the father she never met might save her from her unhappy life. She studiously avoids asking herself why he is absent now. Her gay friend Clarke meanwhile needs to escape from his homophobic dad and his insufficiently assertive mother. A road trip and a very 80s sound track ensue. Offbeat humor mixes with high sentiment along the way. Sentiment in teen movies doesn't always work well, but this time it does almost perfectly.",1384560000,2,803,5.045112781954887

4907645,5,B005Z9MGRG,"In an effort to catch up on viewing and perhaps buying all of Dwight Yoakam's films I decided to rent this one first before deciding to purchase.  Half way through the gem I paused the DVD, went on line, and purchased this movie.  Not only was I happy with Dwight's performance and want to add the movie to his other films on my own shelf; I want to be able to watch this delightfully touching film over and over.  It was so much more than what I expected it to be based on the snippets of description I had read.

Juno Temple, who provided viewers with an excellent performance in 'Killer Joe', one again was amazingly natural, believable, and totally immersed in her character.  Jeremy Dozier I was not at all familiar with.  I had not seen him in any other film, and indeed, he has not been in my full-length movies, but he definitely should be appearing on the screen a great deal more.  He is an excellent actor and handled this part perfectly.  The each member of the well-known cast comprised of Mary Steenburgen, Milla Jovovich, William H. Macy, Dwight Yoakam, and Tim McGraw, as well as lesser known, but busy, performers such as Nicholas D. Agosto, Brent Briscoe, and Gary Grubbs, gave sterling pitch-perfect and thoroughly natural performances.

This was a lovely story and evoked an equal number of laughs and tears and was just a joy to watch. The sound track, heavily laced with Mellisa Manchester performances was very enjoyable and very well matched to the story.

The DVD contains a commentary, as well as deleted scenes, and has closed captions.

I thoroughly recommend this film and wish those in charge of such things had provided more appropriate art work to pitch the film and a more accurate description of the film for advertising so that more movie watchers would be interested in renting this wonderful little movie.  It is a shame that more people don't know about the movie and haven't had the pleasure of seeing it.

4907649,5,B005Z9MGRG,"I did not expect to even like this movie. I didn't want to like it. A friend suggested it and I bought it, based on the fact Mary Steenburgen, William H. Macy and Dwight Yokum were in the cast. The cover deceived me - I perceived it to be a soft-porn testament to teen angst; with a predictably tedious plot (or lack thereof), and rather regretted the purchase.
Watching the movie, ,my prejudice was shattered  - which I suspected was exactly what the producers/writers intended to do - and for that I'm grateful.
Just as the dynamic of friendship between lead roles of Danielle and Clarke blossomed unexpectedly, so did my relationship with the movie. I learned to love the very thing I anticipated to loathe.
There is a lesson in this. Often, in today's world, ""traditional values"" i.e. family, gender, education, sexuality to name a few, are dramatically challenged - leading to all manner of negative reactions and false or destructive ""solutions.""
Dirty Girl turns those traditional expectations and perceptions upside down and shakes them up.
I believe the movie illustrates that being outside the norm need not be tragic: in fact, it can be a hell of a lot of fun!
And I think it's a healthy caveat to parents whose children who may not fit the ""traditional"" mold, and reflects the potential damage that could be inflicted by the misguided strong-arm tactics employed to cram them back into that mold.
It is an altogether nurturing and healing movie for those who have the courage to take an honest look at the surprising value of real life, even when that view defies convention. Lives may depend on it.",1374969600,,1611,4.753571428571429

Usual story. Single mother in lack of affection (Milla Jovovich), takes care of her daughter in lack of affection. While the mother is looking for love and a husband all over the place, the daughter (Juno Temple) is looking for love affection in high school and the boys have a blast. She goes in detention where she meets a boy (Jeremy Dozier) who is gay and not accepted by his father (Dwight Yoakam) but his mother (Mary Steenburgen) adores him.  They suddenly find the name and address of her father and travel across the country to meet him with the expected consequences.

Juno Temple and Jeremy Dozier are fabulous and uninhibited and their performance is just outstanding.

Five stars all around for the acting and the direction. It shows you that even when you take a clich story with a predictable plot and ending but have great actors, you get a terrific movie.",1359158400,2,975,4.684210526315789
4907661,3,B005Z9MGRG,"Having read an early review when Dirty Girl got a very limited release(9 theaters what's up with that ?) and then watching the trailer I decided that I needed to see this film. It's the debut film of Abe Sylvia who's done a lot of Broadway work and some tv and short  films previously. Mr. Sylvia gets some things right and other things not so much. He also wrote the story so he's to blame here as well. And away we go the film is based on 2 characters the wild child Danielle played excellently by the petite and pretty Juno Temple and the shy,closeted gay character Clarke played excellently by Jeremy Dozier. Both are high school students at Norman Oklahoma High school in the year 1987. Danielle has the reputation of being shall we say a slut ? She wears provocative clothes,acts and talks in overly sexual ways and generally freaks out the  crowd of christian conservatives that seem to overrun Norman. After 1 too many rebellious episodes Danielle is sent to the Challengers class aka the special ed class. There she ends up being paired with the quiet reserved and chubby Clarke .The class project they are assigned is the parenting skills challenge. Each couple has a 5 lb bag of flour that they are to treat as if it were an actual child they were caring for. On a side note they actually do have classes like this or at least they did when I  was in High School back in the 80's. This is more than ironic as both Danielle and Clarke come from messed up to the max families. Danielle's Mom played quite nicely by Milla Jovovich is a former floozy who's been a less than stellar Mom and is trying to find redemption by marrying the Mormon and self righteous Ray (William H Macy ) .Danielle never knew her biological father other than what Sue Ann(Mom) has told her and from a small photo of him. Meanwhile poor Clarke has to deal with a bully of a Dad played with menace and a sense of pathos by Dwight Yoakum. His mother Peggy is a timid wallflower of a gal intimidated by husband Joseph played smartly by all world actress Mary Steenburgen. Peggy you can tell loves Clarke no matter if he's maybe gay or not. Joseph is a homo phobe to the extent that he berates Clarke endlessly about it. This of course would include therapy to try and ""straighten out"" Clarke and threats to ship him off to Military school to make  a real man out of him. After reluctantly paired together the sassy Danielle and the low key Clarke start a tepid relationship. Danielle knows Clarke is gay and is fine with that which is a relief to Clarke after he clumsily tries to act straight and seduce Danielle. It takes time but these two lost children find that they actually have some things in common and become friends. Danielle has a major falling out with Sue Ann and Ray and is hellbent on finding her real father. Meanwhile Clarke's Dad has gone off the deep end and assaults Clarke causing Clarke to flee in his Dads prized Cadillac. So feeling the need to get the hell out of Oklahoma they end up on a quest to find Danielle's Dad Danny (Tim McGraw) who's living in Fresno California now. They take their flour child now dubbed Joan (as in Joan Jett for Danielle and Joan Crawford for Clarke) and head west. Along the way they learn a lot of life's lessons and about each other. They pick up a hunky male stripper named Joel ( Nicholas D'Agasto) who in a sweet and thankfully non explicit way takes Clarke's virginity .Trouble ensues when all the parents find out what's gone on and each reacts in their own way. Joseph ends up in jail for B&E at Sue Ann's house. Sue Ann and Peggy decide to fly out to Fresno and head off a meeting between Danny and Danielle. The climax of the film is when our two mismatched friends are caught and split up with Joseph dragging Clarke back to Norman and Danielle fleeing for Fresno. Danielle makes it to Danny's abode in Fresno and I will not spoil things by revealing what happens. Where I had issues with the film were some of the set ups were either ridiculous or so cliche that it made you groan. Abe needed someone else to help him tighten up the story for one thing. The characters are all thinly drawn and if the actors were lesser talents this film would've been a disaster. Temple is amazing you learn to love Danielle warts and all and she could have been a bad joke of a character .Clarke could have been an even more stereotypical Gay character played for yucks in a less able actors hands than Dozier's. I found the set ups and little ribs as in ha,ha aint we clever annoying and take away from the character. Not being Gay myself I don't know if the stereotype's displayed here are offensive to the average gay viewer or not. One thing that was cute was how the flour aka Joan had changeable facial expressions and showed a range of facial expressions that were funny . Both Steenburgen and Jovovich are good as the respective Mom's. You'd expect that from Steenbergen who's an award winning actress of note but Jovovich noted more for her good looks than acting chops more than hold her own. I wish that Abe Sylvia had gotten some outside help on the story as it's really good in spots I even almost cried at one point. Really Dirty Girl is a good film that should have been a great one. i look forward to seeing the lovely Ms. Juno Temple for many years to come.",1357084800,2,5309,4.403258655804481
4907662,4,B005Z9MGRG,"Imagine if Alison Lohman had played the Dede Truitt part in ""The Opposite of Sex"" (1998) and subtly inserted a bit of Luna Lovegood into the character, and you will have a pretty good idea of the look and feel of ""Dirty Girl"" (2010).  Full of wisdom disguised as black comedy.

The dialogue is not on quite the level of ""The Opposite of Sex"",  especially the voiceover narration; but what is?  Christina Ricci had so much to work with in that film that Roger Ebert commented specifically about the narration provided by her character: ""I hate people who talk during movies, but if she were sitting behind me in the theater, saying all of this stuff, I'd want her to keep right on talking"".

Juno Temple (playing ""Dirty Girl's"" title character Danielle Edmondston) does not have as much to work with and her narration is much more conventional.  And since her narration does not contradict the events taking place on the screen,  any depth brought to her character must come from Temple's and Writer/Director Abe Sylvia's acting for the camera abilities.  They are up to the task and Temple non-verbally sells viewers a character who is a lot more that she first appears to be.  Sylvia's storytelling style juxtapositions crude and cute, which dooms the film commercially as there is a limited audience for a film structured around such contrasting elements.

The main suspension of disbelief element is Danielle having a classic Mustang convertible at her personal disposal.  This was a moronic choice by Sylvia as there is not time to insert a credible explanation; the car is not just a needless distraction but is also a poor fit for the character whose development would have been better served by something funky like a beat up Volkswagen.

Bottom line this is Temple's movie, although she is ably assisted by Jeremy Dozier and Mary Steenburgen (as Danielle's buddy Clarke and his mother).  The other characters are the deliberate stereotypes necessary for economically keeping the focus on Clarke and Danielle.

Temple is really starting to take off, she is getting a lot of work and is stepping into the roles that Lohman would be doing if she were ten years younger. And Temple should have additional opportunities as she has more range than Lohman; with a nice off-kilter airhead quality when required. You could see that she was something special back in 2008 when her supporting role in ""Wild Child"" literally stole the movie.  And she has finally overcome the first name confusion with a certain Ellen Page character.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1356393600,,2577,4.860411899313501

She is a relevation and I was in awe of her range. She hasn't appeared in a lot of films but I can definitely see a star in the making. The storyline is great, the music is timeless, and the acting is flawless, even Tim McGraw proves he is more than just a country singer. Dirty Girl left me with a huge smile on my face, it's a fun coming-of-age film. I highly recommend it!!!",1353196800,,532,4.174757281553398
4907665,5,B005Z9MGRG,"Full disclosure: I once spent a day at Pier 39 with the filmmaker/ director of this movie back in the 90's- Remember, Abe? You, me, and Robin saw Luke Perry walking down the street, we hung out with the sea lions, and I paid the all-day parking fee because your sister lost the garage ticket.
Good times, everyone. But, on to this review...Just because I had a passing acquaintance with the filmmaker doesn't mean I would give a good review. No, I watched this film twice over a six-month period to get the full feeling of the film, and I only have one word: LOVE! This movie is crafted and written with care and heart, and is brought to life by a stellar cast and a fast-paced storyline arc laced with fab 80's songs. Juno Temple plays Danielle, a promiscuous high schooler/wild child in late 80's Oklahoma.  Danielle's reputation as the school trollop is given a new level of indignity when she is sent to ""Challengers,"" the basement ghetto for marginalized and underperforming students at Norman High. Enter Danielle, a hair-tossing, attitude-laced, short-skirted dynamo who meets her polar opposite in Challengers: Clark (a career-making debut for Jeremy Dozier), a repressed, overweight, and withdrawn classmate who's  been labeled a ""f&g.""  Danielle and Clark get off to a rocky start when they're paired off as parents of a ""flour sack"" baby which will ostensibly demonstrate to them the permanence and commitment of raising a baby. (Yes, there was a rumor that they did this exact curriculum in my high school's home ec class!) Cut to Clark's sexual orientation therapy, Danielle's spirited confrontation with her Mormon stepfather-to-be (played by William Macy) and the violence Clark endures at the hand of his abusive dad (played with creepy authenticity by Dwight Yoakam, countered with Clark's oppressed mom ( Mary Steenburgen in a memorable characterization). Things come to a bubbling head when a classroom assignment leads Danielle and Clark to a long-buried secret of Danielle's mother Sue Ellen (Milla Jovovich), a struggling single mom. When Clark's father has a meltdown, a road trip ensues, and before long Clark and Danielle are singing, fighting, and running from the law in a mid-80's Cadillac on a cross-country quest for identity and love. I won't give away al the details, beacause you should watch the film unfold yourself. This movie isn't simple to characterize: is it a gay ""coming-out"" story, a story of power struggles and disparity of relationships, the surprising alliances we find ourselves in, the dangers of labeling people, or the strength of friendship? It's all of those things and more; it's funny, full of heart, music, and message that we have to be strong and proud of who we inherently are. Bravo!",1350432000,,2743,5.010964912280702

4907669,4,B005Z9MGRG,"Abe Sylvia, writer and director of Dirty Girl, brings ten years as a dancer and choreographer on Broadway into his debut feature film.  It goes without saying that Dirty Girl is filled with a slew of nostalgic music hits such as Teena Marie's Lovegirl, Melissa Manchester's Don't Cry Out Loud, and The Outfield's Your Love, and dance scenes that liven certain character roles. Dirty Girl is set in Oklahoma during the 1980's and centers around Danielle (Juno Temple) and Clarke (Jeremy Dozier), two high school misfits who become friends through fate and chance. Danielle is the natural born rebel that has a bad reputation, has a killer body and drives around looking for trouble in a red mustang.

Clarke is an overweight, witty, closeted virgin, and suffers the emotional and physical abuse of his domineering, homophobic father, Joseph (Dwight Yoakum).  If Joseph finds out Clarke is gay, he will send him to military school. Danielle's unruly behavior forces the school principal to send her to remedial class where she is paired up with Clarke to complete a parenting project. Danielle is disrespectful and bitter towards her mother, Sue-Ann (Milla Jovovich), and Sue-Ann's Mormon fianc Ray (William H. Macy), maybe because she feels left out or maybe she doesn't connect with the new future her mother is embracing. Either way, Danielle recruits Clarke to go with her to California to locate Danny Briggs (Tim McGaw), the father she never met.

Finding the rebel inside of him, Clarke takes Joseph's prized Cadillac and his parent's credit card to finance the getaway trip.  Danielle and Clarke learn and laugh at each other along the journey. They even pick up Joel (Nicholas d'Agosto), a stripper who Clarke eventually becomes intimate with. The fun comes to a halt when Joseph reports his car stolen to the police and catches up with the two.  Clarke stays with Joseph to take the beatings while Danielle forges ahead to California. When she reaches Danny Briggs, he's not interested in a father-daughter relationship.  Both Danielle and Clarke were forced to grow up quickly under their dysfunctional family circumstances.

In the end, the truth has set them both free.  Clarke is now out of the closet with his mother, Peggy (Mary Steenburgen) and Danielle realized her mother loved her enough to not to have an abortion. Dirty Girl is a creative and exciting movie. Each cast member holds their own when shifting between neuroses and normalcy. Director Abe Sylvia was very crafty with keeping the music in tow when tough scenes emerged. Overall, Dirty Girl is fun to watch and is a great first start for Director Abe Sylvia to build upon.",1336780800,2,2651,4.979638009049774

4907673,1,B005Z9MGRG,"Though it may not seem obviously so, coming-of-age films are difficult to pull off, because the balance one must maintain in order to offer just the right amount of sentimentality -- without crossing over into schmaltz -- is a tricky feat to master. In Dirty Girl, first-time writer/director Abe Sylvia makes things even harder for himself by setting the film in the nostalgic 1980s and promising a subversive edginess in his titular protagonist, a promiscuous high schooler named Danielle who embarks on a cross-country road trip with an unlikely partner in crime: a closeted bisexual classmate named Clarke. Unfortunately, Sylvia fails to bring it all together and make it work; I found Dirty Girl tame and uneven, never quite bringing the Dirty and then trying to tie it all up in a sentimental bow that's wholly unearned.
