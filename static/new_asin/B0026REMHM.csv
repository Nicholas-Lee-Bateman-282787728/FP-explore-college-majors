8353467,3,B0026REMHM,"1951's 'Close to My Heart' (Warner Bros.), an odd little sociological melodrama, offers fine performances from Tierney and Milland but feels overcalculated in its message when compared to superior (and similarly themed) heartstring-tuggers like Columbia's 'Penny Serenade' (1941). Still, a well intentioned time-passer.  Warner Archive's DVD-R features a clean print with clear audio.  No extras.  Movie earns 3-plus stars, presentation 3 1/2.",1460937600,2,443,6.112903225806452

8353469,5,B0026REMHM,"My library has an amazing collection of old movies on DVD. And I had Netflix and Amazon streaming. But they didn't carry this Gene Tierney movie, so I decided to buy it. Really good movie. Was it worth the money? Well, it was really bugging me that there was a Gene Tierney movie out there that I hadn't seen. I only had to spend ten bucks to get that annoyance out of my life.",1398038400,,377,4.108108108108108

8353473,4,B0026REMHM,"Originally titled ""Counter-Intelligence"" during pre-production, ""Close to My Heart"" is a warm, touching film that explores the issue of nature versus nurture in terms of babies and parenting.  In the only feature film she made at Warner Brothers, Fox contract star Gene Tierney plays Midge Sheridan, a young wife who is unable to conceive children.  Her husband Brad (Ray Milland) readily agrees that adoption is the answer to their problem, but when Midge becomes attached to Danny, a foundling born to unidentified parents, Brad begins to worry that the baby may have been born with genetically determined criminal tendencies.  He uses his position as a newspaper reporter to launch an investigation into Danny's parentage, causing the head of the adoption agency (Fay Bainter) to question whether the Sheridans are the most suitable couple to raise Danny.

This sensitive, thoughtful drama is expertly played by a talented cast.  Miss Tierney, in particular, is ideally suited to her role and turns in a beautifully underplayed performance that tugs at the audience's heart.  Her scenes with Miss Bainter, especially the ones in which she attempts to explain away Milland's obsessive doubts, are authentically tender and convincing.  Milland, who sometimes comes off as a bit more brash than necessary, is generally reined in by director William Keighley; his final emotional scene with Miss Bainter seems a little forced, but is nonetheless effective.  There's also a outstanding supporting turn by Mary Beth Hughes in the small role of rough-edged party girl who has information about the infant's birth mother.

""Close to My Heart"" is presented on DVD-R via the Warner Archives, a collection of films that are ""manufactured on demand"" (MOD) when ordered, rather than pressed in mass quantity and sold through retail stores.  These DVD-Rs are transferred from the best available film prints, but have not been remastered or restored.  They are presented ""bare bones"", without extras such as commentary tracks or theatrical trailers.  (For more about the Warner Archive Collection, visit their website.)  In the case of this particular title, the transfer is quite commendable.  My copy of ""Close to My Heart"" features a sharp picture with beautiful contrast and a crisp, clear soundtrack.  I am pleased to be able to recommend it to you.",1270252800,24,2342,5.258064516129032
