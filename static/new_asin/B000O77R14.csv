Surprisingly, the box cover wasn't enough to deter me.  I knew in my heart of hearts it could only be absolutely, soul crushingly terri-bad, but some masochistic part of me, the same part that wants to touch an orange, glowing heating element in the oven just to see HOW bad it would hurt, wondered ""what if it's one of those little gems, one of those rare finds that is SO bad, it circumnavigates the scale of awfulness and is actually quite fun?""

It could happen.

It didn't.

By any conceivable metric through which one can measure a movie, this one scores 0.0001 stars. Directing, acting, script, line delivery, special effects (and by ""special,"" I mean ""short bus.""), you name it. The minimum 1 star, A WHOLE ENTIRE STAR, is so egregiously generous, it hurts my soul.

Before you pay money to see this (or see it for free... or some unscrupulous weirdo pays YOU to see it for some reason): You would have more fun driving a lawn mower, weeping, over a litter of puppies.
