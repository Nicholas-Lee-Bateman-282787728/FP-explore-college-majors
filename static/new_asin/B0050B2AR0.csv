8451024,5,B0050B2AR0,"The CD is very good in explaining the different phases during Yukon and Alaska hunting seasons.  It will explain what calls to use throughout the season and how to do it.  Books can explain but to hear the actual calls and scrapes, identify where to hunt, and actually seeing the hunts were very beneficial to me while watching.  It's a CD to get you raved up to the hunt.",1519084800,,372,4.36231884057971
