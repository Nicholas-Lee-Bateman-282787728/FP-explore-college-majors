1806655,2,B00007DWRG,"I should have heeded the warning how badly wonderful scenes had been edited out.  If you still have a VHS player, the video tape includes all the scenes that made this movie so good.  I definitely don't recommend this DVD.",1499126400,,222,4.525

1806672,5,B00007DWRG,I envy first time viewers.,1488758400,,26,4.4
1806673,2,B00007DWRG,Ummm so no one else is concerned that in this movie Slater plays a stalker who follows Tomai home every night and watches her sleep??,1488153600,,133,4.36
1806674,5,B00007DWRG,"In an all-night diner, a diffident adorable young dishwasher, Adam (Christian Slater), stares silently and longingly at Caroline (Marisa Tomei), a bubbly kind-hearted waitress co-worker. He can vouch for her kindness as she tends to a cut on his hand. She's a lonely gal, likely in part, because she tends to beg guys not to leave her. He doesn't appear to be a great recruiter for himself either as he doesn't dare to speak.  But something's brewing, and the dynamic between them is very sweet and quite naturally sexy as it evolves. Having spent his childhood in a convent orphanage, it was only the nuns who offered him solace, and it was they who also offered him quite a bizarre accounting of the origins of his heart. Even there, he watched in silence as other kids were ushered off to family homes. Early on Adam rescues Caroline from a brutal attack, as she walks home from work. How he got here and what he's up to remain to be seen. The trajectory of this uniquely sensitive and sensual relationship is not to be missed.  Love the Nat King Cole tracks, especially  the very appropriate ""Nature Boy,"" as well as the instrumental version. The acting is extraordinary by the 2 principals and Rosie Perez is super too. All filmmaking disciplines are in sync and solid. Highly recommend for viewing time and again.",1487894400,,1319,4.701298701298701
1806675,5,B00007DWRG,Truly a sweet story with excellent acting.  I would watch this movie again.  I would purchase it for my collection.,1487721600,,115,4.7

1806687,5,B00007DWRG,"I smiled the first half of the movie, and sobbed the second half. People in these reviews are saying that he's a stalker, and yeah, in a way he kind of is, but keep in mind that he is not as developed as an adult is. He has the mind of a child. And when children like someone, they tend to follow them around. I thought it was sweet, and don't let that deter you from enjoying this movie.",1487462400,,388,3.9240506329113924

1806689,5,B00007DWRG,"Beautiful. Loved them both in this because they played it so real. This is my fave christian Slater movie because it was so much about everything but the words. I don't know how many times I've seen it,, but i cry every time beautiful. I always enjoy "" Nature boy"" in any Film, Moullin Rouge) it brings a sad sweetness just perfectly.",1487030400,,334,4.403225806451613
1806690,4,B00007DWRG,"I like both of the actors, Christian Slater and Marisa Tomei.  You have two people who ultimately found each other over a bad circumstance.  She's the everyday working girl trying to figure out what's she's doing, he's the antisocial quiet guy who doesn't know where he fits in in the world.  They both bring out the best in each other.  You could predict the ending, but getting there was what the story is really about.",1486771200,,421,4.573333333333333

1806710,4,B00007DWRG,"Love this movie and it being a love story. Despite the obnoxious Rosy Perez character and the mild nudity, which is why I gave 4 stars, it was good. WIsh the ending would have been better with them living happily ever after. How sad to be tempted by the love of your life after many disastrous relationships just for him to pass away suddenly.",1486166400,,343,4.375

1806730,5,B00007DWRG,This is one of the greatest love story movies ever made. The romance of an oddly paired couple and the moments they share is great. The opinions and pressures of the rest of the world put a stress on the relationship but it manages to survive and grow anyway.,1476835200,,259,4.3061224489795915

1806750,2,B00007DWRG,It doesn't make any difference to the story but I am both disappointed and annoyed by any sign of creepy puritanical cropping of exposed secondary sexual body parts. The previous dvd incarnation of this film was not cropped in this way. Hello 1962! Otherwise its is a good movie with a good cast.,1465430400,,296,4.60377358490566

1806754,4,B00007DWRG,"Pretty close to being maudlin, but I enjoyed it. Marisa Tomei and Rosie Perez both do good jobs, and that's the salvation of this movie. Christian Slater somehow just doesn't pull it off. He seems to be playing dumb.",1461888000,,216,4.564102564102564
1806755,5,B00007DWRG,One of the best movies that I've seen in a while.  It made me cry and laugh.,1461628800,,76,3.4705882352941178
1806756,3,B00007DWRG,"It's a sweet movie, but I found it difficult to overlook the glorified stalking. Additionally, the ending was unsatisfying--not because it was sad, but because it was sort of blah. The tall tale spun at the beginning of the movie doesn't really carry through the story and doesn't have much point other than to show Adam's naivete. I thought there would be some story tie-in or bit of dramatic revelation with Adam's gift to Caroline. Instead, the movie turns out to be little more than a slice-of-life story.",1461456000,,509,4.795454545454546
1806757,5,B00007DWRG,"Marissa Tomei is a beautiful goddess, in this movie she totally captivates the heart of all the viewers.  Really miss movies like this where she brings magic to the screen.",1461456000,,172,4.733333333333333
1806778,3,B00007DWRG,"This follows a boy meets girl plot pretty closely, but has a sorrowful ending which I will not disclose. It has good acting and the plot and location action in Minneapolis is believable. I have rated it as Okay.",1461283200,,211,4.435897435897436

It breaks my heart and makes me cry every single time I watch it.  I've always loved Christian Slater, but to me this was the first movie of his I've seen that really showed that he was more than wisecracking rebel.  It shows a more quiet, serious, deep side, that I never expected.  I've had this on VHS for years, but when it wouldn't play well on my VCR anymore, I KNEW I had to get the dvd finally.  Soooo glad I did, as I just couldn't imagine my life without ever watching it again!  I will only long for the kind of love Adam and Caroline shared.",1456444800,,727,4.179856115107913

1806878,2,B00007DWRG,"You know what?
To change the previous image is not really easy thing to do. Yes, it really is.
Christian Slater was an idol star back then. And to change that image, it needed more then just an unshaved face and some chest injury.
He was in the other movie titled HE WAS A QUIET MAN way later and he was a poor man like this film. His look was way changed. His hair was bald. It totally changed his image and it was like a domino. He was really different.
In this movie, his hair was really long and he looked like a hippy (He was always like that in other movies back then). It really made him like one and he was never even closer to look poor.
I would say his hair distroyed this movie.
Once his image couldn't changed his prvious image, it felt like Marisa Tomei was like acting to herself to make it work. It didn't and she was like a fool.
The movie for me was like a joke to me. A soft cheesy movie with no heart.
The movie crashed and didn't won the audiences' heart at the boxoffice too.
Maybe if i ddn't knew Slater, it would have worked better. I don't know.
Anyway, the story itself is so romantic and I think it really has potential, I would have been way better if the director could have seen the small little details.",1452384000,,1233,4.099173553719008
1806879,5,B00007DWRG,"This movie or any movie for that matter isn't worth a dime with the cut and missing 11 minutes since it's theatrical release in 1993. MGM is so greedy they simply refuse to re-release this movie in its entirety. It should finally after all these years be released again but in its entirety, including the tiny amount of nudity and lite violence, if one could even call a quick flash of young Marasi Tomei's chest when she first realizes that she's in love.

1806883,2,B00007DWRG,"I can't imagine how anybody could watch this and see it as romantic or quality. The dialogue is clunky and weird, and the characters have no common sense. The only reason Caroline pays any attention to Slater's Frankensteinesque character is because he happened to be stalking her on a night when somebody else assaulted her. He apparently stalks her a lot, as he lets her know he watched her sleep on a regular basis before they had met. And she is all for it. And apparently so is everyone else who watched this movie claiming it's romantic. The only reason I gave this two stars is because Rosie Perez is in it.

Christian Slater is convincing and brilliant as the child-man haunted and confused by a world that leaves him withdrawn in chronic unrest.  But deep beneath that anxious soul lies a heart that epitomizes the purest forms of love and one that his sweetheart (Marisa Tomei) is disarmed by again and again.  Writer Tom Sierchio creates an irresistable plot in asking the question, what if a fully grown man could love--as a child?",1418256000,,515,4.965116279069767

Luckily, Amazon had it for a reasonable price.  I now like Christian Slater so much, that I bought another of of his movies (suggested by Amazon): Bed of Roses.  Can't wait for it to arrive.

1807037,4,B00007DWRG,"Now keep in mind I was born in '86 and I watched this movie when I was in my mid single digits.  So about twenty years now I've thought about this movie and wanted to see it again.  It was one of those bittersweet memories that grew foggier throughout the years and the only reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 was because of the ending of the movie, which is not the merchant's fault.  I got this DVD quickly (but I do have Prime membership), the packaging was satisfactory, and I have no complaints as far as the merchant's end of the transaction.

Story: Little did I know Marisa Tomei starred in this teen romance after her performance in ""My Cousin Vinny"" and she gives a surreal portrayal here as a waitress who is sexually assaulted by old acquaintances of hers.  That moment of ""fight or flight"" arises in the story that too many women have tragically been subject to, and Christian Slater plays the hero, Adam, who comes to her rescue.  His backstory helps fuel the romance, and it leads up to the ultimately tragic, tear-jerking ending.  It's sad to watch because you just want her to find happiness, but it's a bittersweet gem of a story you'll remember for years to come.",1362700800,,1177,4.3963133640553
1807038,5,B00007DWRG,This is a nice romantic story with a suprisingly underrated performance by Christian Slater as Adam. His character stays to the background and doesn't say much till he rescues and falls in love with Caroline (Tomei). From there the movie is filled with sweet moments and a overall very nicely told story.,1360022400,,304,4.865384615384615

1807042,5,B00007DWRG,"I've loved this movie ever since it appeared in 1993 when I was in high school. I love the simple, working-class characters (no fancy houses or cars or sets) and their stories. Caroline (Tomei) is adorable, spunky, vulnerable, and endearing. Adam (Slater) is believably shy, awkward, and socially clumsy, yet valiant and generous at heart. This is not a romantic comedy, and this is not a feel-good, bubbly romantic story. This story is sad and touching and sweet, from beginning to end. It has moments of romance, humor, sadness, drama... but it doesn't fit into any one category. It's REAL... just like real life has all sorts of moments and themes. I love the quiet, unhurried pace of the story. Lines aren't rushed, you don't have clever quips coming like rapid gunfire, there's plenty of silence, much of the story is told through observing subtle movements and facial expressions. It's cute, sweet, sad, and completely unforgettable. One final note: do NOT watch this as a pick-me-up, this movie is far too sad in places to be watched on a rainy day!",1356998400,,1056,4.8397790055248615

Marisa Tomei and Chriatain Slater deliver such rarified performances that only the sensitive even get how deeply lovely their performances are---you've just got to let it enchant you.  I can barely believe such a peculiar, quirky, charming (and a bit corny) story could repeatedly transport me to the rarest of romantic delights----yet, even tho' it's a tear-jerker, it's a gentle, lovely ending that doesn't leave me sad.

It's actually one of my all-time favorite  movies---I immediately found myself looking for other films directed by Tony Bill.  I can't think of another film that could SO easily have been a waste were it not for perfect directing added to breathtakingly sweet & nuanced performance by Marisa and Christian.

It may not be for everybody, but romantics can't help but fall in love with it.  Don't let ""tear-jerker, chick flick"" put you off.  Marisa Tomei's closing performance just brings you back to wet eye smiling---right out the door.  What a gem of a little movie.",1352851200,,1079,5.01685393258427

1807048,3,B00007DWRG,"I watched this movie not too long ago on the MGM HD channel on TV and I vaguely remembered this film when it first came out in theaters back in '93. Seeing this movie in it's entirety for the first time on TV, I ended up liking this flick a lot. I'm usually not a fan of romance films ""chick flicks"" but this one stood out a lot to me and I decided to buy the dvd.

Well, it turns out that the film print used for the dvd is not the same as what I saw on TV. There's one particular scene where Adam and Caroline go into the bedroom. Marisa Tomei's character takes off her bra and there's a front shot of her boobs and she places Christian Slater's character's hand on one of them. On the dvd this scene is cut! Like what I mean is that it's not cut out but the image is cropped. It shows from just above her chest. Is this some form of censorship? I mean WTF! It's not like that scene was pornographic and it was still a tender moment in this movie. There were some other scenes like at the hockey game, the players skating on the ice, their heads were cropped out. The whole film on this dvd looks like some of the image was removed from the top and bottom of the film.

Doing a little research on this film on the internet, I hear there's supposedly a ""European Cut cable tv version"" in which I think that's the version I saw on TV? (I'm not quite sure about that). ""European Cut version"" hasn't been released on any video format. To anyone who happens to read my review do you know what I'm talkin' about?

...As for the picture and sound quality of this dvd it's actually pretty good. It's not 5.1 sound but the 2 channel stereo surround seems adequate for this type of film. I would've given this product five stars, but I'm led to believe that the ""original film print"" as shot by the director was not used for this dvd. I don't know how this film looked when it came out in theaters back in '93 but they need to put Marisa's boobies back in this film for the dvd!",1349568000,,1970,4.098445595854923

1807056,3,B00007DWRG,"Untamed Heart was a very different offbeat romance that I enjoyed in parts, in spite of some flaws and a weak story. Christian Slater, Marisa Tomei, and Rosie Perez all gave very good performances--all cast against type. Christian Slater, especially, since instead of the usual Gen X answer to Jack Nicholson, always quick with a quip, we get an understated and tender performance, with nary even a raised eyebrow. He is not his usual smart aleck character--in fact at first you think he is totally mute--but then once he does start talking, he is literate, well read, if a bit naive. It is a bit much, I thought, like he is Adam the Magic Bus Boy, but I'm sure that lots of people were able to suspend disbelief and got totally swept up in the romantic story.

--------------
Adam: I wonder if you think about me.
Caroline: Of course I think about you!
Adam: I wasn't finished!
Caroline: Finish.
Adam: I wonder if you think about me half as much as I think about you.
======================

Marisa Tomei plays a waitress in a cafe who is looking for love, but, let's just say that she kissed a lot of frogs trying to find her Prince Charming. I was enthralled with her sweet Caroline, but the way her character was written, there were just a few things that  didn't add up. Mainly, it was her reaction to Slater's Adam the seemingly mute busboy, who sneaks into her house on Christmas and leaves a Christmas Tree for her, and then confesses that it wasn't the first time he has sneaked into her house, and by the way, he watches her sleep. She has just gone through a very traumatic experience, yet she thinks this is cute? I commend her acting all the more, making us believe her, even though the writing was weak as water.

------------------
Adam: I follow you home...
Caroline: You follow me home?
Adam: I wasn't finished.
Caroline: Finish.
Adam: I follow you home to make sure you're... safe.
Caroline: Well I never see you.
Adam: I stay pretty far behind. I'm sorry.
Caroline: Well, I mean, don't be sorry... I just...
Adam: I wasn't finished.
Caroline: Finish.
Adam: I am sorry I was late that night.
============================

Rosie Perez plays another waitress, and for her, it is an understated performance, too. Still, she smolders, making the most of her supporting role as the friend. I enjoyed the song Bad Bad Boys Performed by Midi, Maxi & Efti with a dance from Rosie Perez that was sexy, but rather gratuitous all the same [maybe a foreshadowing of something--not to spoil the suspense or anything].

The film's weaknesses are also its strengths, as there are a lot of artistic and musical touches, like a beginning sequence with a kid (a dead ringer for Slater as a kid) in sepia tones. The sound track was quite ecclectic, with songs by Timbuk 3, Los Lobos, Suzanne Vega, Cowboy Junkies, Eddie Palmieri, among others; and the recurring musical motif of the Roger Williams version of Nature Boy (written by Eden Ahbez), and finally the Nat Cole version as credits roll.

----------------------
Caroline: I have fallen...
Adam: Are you hurt?
Caroline: I wasn't finished.
Adam: Finish.
Caroline: I have fallen so in love with you, so much more than I said I would.
=================================

The bottom line is Untamed Heart tries to tell a fable, but fables can be fickle mistresses. I really liked Christian Slater's performance, and also Marisa Tomei's. They were great together, and I commend the artistic touches and the chances the film makers took. Christian Slater, especially, tried something completely different from his usual. I loved his naive belief that the scratchy old records the nuns at the orphanage gave him were magic. Sometimes, though, the magic doesn't work. This was one of those times.

----------------
Caroline: Adam your heart is diseased! You need a new one.
Adam: But this is my heart! I'm afraid that if they take it away I won't be able to love you the same.

1807057,4,B00007DWRG,"This is a surreal and gentle movie that stands-out with its ability to utilize a fairy-tale feel in a simple setting (a small town and an average diner). This is a romance between an offbeat waitress ""Caroline"" who gets dumped by her boyfriend, and a quiet and strange busboy ""Adam"" who has silently been nursing a crush for Caroline. When Caroline gets attacked a few nights later and Adam saves her, they start to get closer despite Caroline's wariness of Adam. Soon Caroline realizes what a gentle soul Adam is, and their romance blossoms so tenderly. Adam also has a strange and fantastical story to tell Caroline about his heart. I also have to mention the dialogue, I found some lines very romantic and cleverly done . Through Adam, Caroline starts to find direction in her life. However I also wanted Adam to get a new lease on life, but the movie opted for a sad ending that I felt was completely unnecessary, and this is what caused me to take a star off of my rating. In conclusion, this is a surreal and tender romantic tale that I enjoyed.",1264204800,,1051,4.536842105263158
1807058,4,B00007DWRG,"Couldn't resist the pun there:) This is an old-time bittersweet love story that tugs at one's heartstrings. Marisa Tomei plays waitress Caroline, who can't seem to find a nice guy. The ones she does date are jerks, using her as one-night stands, and she can't fathom why she's treated so badly. One night, one her way home from work, Carolina is attacked by two guys who had earlier met her at the diner she works in - fortunately, Adam the busboy from the diner [Christian Slater] happens along and rescues her.

Adam is a bit of a recluse - he hardly ever speaks, and maintains a low profile at the diner. Initially Caroline keeps her distance from him, but eventually gets drawn to Adam's sweet and vulnerable disposition and discovers that Adam is drawn to her too. Thus two rather emotionally stunted people reach out to each other and find a real connection that transcends everything else. However [as in many classic love stories], the pair's happiness is threatened by outside factors beyond their control and the rest of the movie deals with this.

I felt that Marisa Tomei's performance as the emotionally vulnerable Caroline was spot-on, eliciting one's sympathy whilst also being frustrated by her lack of real goals in life. Christian Slater [who also delivered a compelling performance in ""Bed of Roses""] is subtle and credible in his portrayal as the quiet and unassuming Adam who has spent the greater part of his life hiding his true emotions, but whose love for Caroline [and her love for him], brings him alive. The leads are convincing in their roles and the chemistry between the pair is credible too. Speaking of performances, Rosie Perez delivers a good turn as Caroline's sharp-tongued fellow waitress and best friend.

""Untamed Heart"" is a bitterweet love story that will appeal to fans of romance dramas.",1242345600,,1831,4.881028938906752

1807061,5,B00007DWRG,"I think this is the purest love story movie ever made. This portrays the arrival of the deepest, truest, simplest, most unfettered love. I must have watched it over 100 times. There's magic in it, for sure.
I've never been taken with any actress ever in my whole life, I've never found myself pre-occupied with any actress, with the exception of Marisa Tomei. I think Marisa Tomei, in Untamed Heart, is just about the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. I have such a fondness for her that words can't describe it. any girl I date must have a little Maris Tomei in her. She stirs a flame in me.",1238630400,,595,4.418181818181818
1807062,4,B00007DWRG,"Released in 1993, ""Untamed Heart"" tells the story of Caroline (Marisa Tomei) who works the night shift at a Minneapolis diner. She's a beautiful and likable young woman but, for some reason, is unable to maintain the romantic interest of the guys she dates. The answer to her love problems turns out to be right under her nose in the form of the diner's quiet dishwasher/janitor, Adam (Christian Slater).

""Untamed Heart"" is a must for fans of Marisa Tomei (see the film and you'll see why) and the romance between Caroline and Adam works, although their sexual union is premature IMHO, but real-time has to be condensed into a 102-minute film so I guess it can be overlooked.

What struck me most about this film, aside from Marisa, was the character of Adam. He's an outcast; he doesn't fit with the crowd; he's quiet and mysterious in a misfit type of way; he's an easy target for people to mock; he's content to adore Caroline from a distance; his love for her doesn't change as she keeps making mistakes trying to find someone to love; he secretly acts as her guardian angel and doesn't care about getting credit.

Why is Caroline attracted to such a person? Because ""opposites attract."" We're naturally attracted to people that have what we lack and vice versa. Caroline is open, talkative and comfortable with practically any social setting; Adam isn't. Adam is aloof, meditative and unconcerned about fitting in -- qualities Caroline lacks.

You'll see people like Adam in real life if you open your eyes. At a local restaurant I sometimes catch a glimpse of one of the kitchen workers, whether taking a smoke break outside or whatever. He's in his mid-30s, maybe older, obviously intelligent with a striking appearance, but he's quiet and aloof from the people around him, with an air of mystery. This is a person, like Adam in the film, who doesn't fit into society's mold -- college doesn't work for him despite his intelligence, nor does a conventional job; he just does what he has to to live.

The film is very successful at bringing to life this type of outcast in the character of Adam. I found it quite moving. I understand and can relate.

Not everything in the story works, however, which is why I knock off a star in my rating. For instance, it isn't even remotely believable that Adam would be able to secretly break into Marisa's house and set up a Christmas tree in her bedroom while she's sleeping, especially in light of the fact that there are other family members sleeping there as well. Dumb. What were the writers thinking?

It's nothing amazing, but it's reminiscent of some of the older, classic Hollywood love stories from the 40s and 50s which I like very much. The only thing I really didn't like about the film was the occasional violence and profanity. I think it would have been more pleasant had there not been any of that. Otherwise, a pretty good movie.",1225843200,,461,4.566265060240964
1807064,4,B00007DWRG,"....and you will enjoy this film. It is a romance cloaked in a fairy tale and if you do not think about it too hard, you will be able to enjoy it.

I love to watch Marisa Tomei - think she is a great actress - and Rosie Perez is good too. The story follows a young couple who develop a relationship despite their circumstances. Tomei plays an outgoing waitress; Slater is a reclusive dishwasher who rarely talks.

This sweet eccentric story will give you a couple of hours of viewing pleasure but afterwards you may ask ""why?""",1207958400,,526,4.357142857142857
1807065,5,B00007DWRG,"So a lot of folks come away with a lot of mixed feelings regarding this movie. Ok, understood. Some people say that `On The Road' was boring and that they didn't get it. Not all the great masterpieces are appealing to everyone. But I think the problem is that you have to see this movie during a point of quiet, and when you're not expecting it. That's when books and films have a way of sneaking up on a person and hitting you over the head for all they're worth.

Untamed Heart was a film that came out when the market was already flooded with similar films, but with different messages, but none as endearing and honest. Young actors weren't in short supply by any means either. Independent Film was being given a second wind, too by younger and more eager Directors than the ones making multi-million dollar big budget pictures. A lot of those films have faded away, and yet this movie still has a credible amount of relevance and a striking amount of nostalgia and appeal.

The most interesting thing about this though is that this was a one-hit wonder in terms of writing by Tom Sierchio. The story is so well developed that it unfolds as if it were an adaptation from a best-seller. Snooping the internet, looking for information about his whereabouts, one comes up dry, realizing this was all that there was, and nothing more. The other possibility is that this film was ghost-written by someone else more famous and for whatever reasons 'Tom Sierchio' was the name given credit for the screenwriting. This kind of thing does happen from time to time as David Mamet has kept his name off of a few films and other well-known writers and Writer-cum-celeb's have done the same. Until someone posts a message about 'Tom Sierchio', I'm going with the latter of the ideas.

Untamed Heart is probably the closing arc of Christian Slater's early career, what he does now is anybody's guess, but to say that he squandered his fame and his carte-blanche is an understatement. It's strange to imagine that he worked on this film directly after coming off the set of the violent and over-the-top True Romance. Most of the reviews here, and on other sites, like Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb, all state that this film encapsulates Slater's best film performance by far. It's hard to disagree, even if you're a fan of Pump up The Volume, Heathers or True Romance. It's easy to be out of control, but harder to be serene, on camera or off. Just look how most people live their lives and consider how most people would like to live their lives.

The music is also stand out and signature. Several of the songs played will probably forever remind those that have seen this movie of Untamed Heart, Suzanne Vega's Tom's Diner and Nat King Cole's Nature Boy are the most prevalent.",1207958400,,2764,4.6232179226069245

1807074,2,B00007DWRG,"In an early scene of ""Untamed Heart"" (MGM, 1993, Working Title: ""Heart of a Baboon""), waitress Marisa Tomei is assaulted by two rather large hooligans.  Luckily for her, busboy Christian Slater has been stalking her in secret, and vanquishes the hooligans with a stick. And thus begins the romance - the more Tomei learns of Slater, the more she falls for him.

We may question her choice in men (she has been through several failed relationships), but her new flame's credentials are impeccable: Slater demonstrates his sensitive Buddhist leanings with nuggets like ""you are my peace,"" and lives next to the river with his anonymous and rather androgynous dog:

""Tomei: Good dog. What's her name?

Slater: I don't know. He didn't tell me.""

As an avid reader of literature and one who spends most of his time lost in profound recollection, it is only natural that Slater still believes the explanation given to him as a child for his heart defect: he has the heart of a baboon. Slater always struck me as being too perfect for a man. Now I know why, because he is a baboon.

Yet not all is wonderful in paradise. True to their nature, the hooligans return for their revenge, and Slater learns the hard way that two men with knives beats one baboon with a stick.  Soon Slater's in the hospital, where he is informed that although he was stabbed in the stomach, he must be treated with heart surgery.

As no human can perform surgery on a baboon heart, Slater flees the hospital to Tomei's house, where the following exchange takes place:

""Tomei: Adam your heart is diseased! You need a new one.

Slater: But this is my heart! I'm afraid that if they take it away I won't be able to love you the same.""

With final proof that he truly loves her - and has a baboon heart - Tomei doesn't take him back to the hospital, and instead holds him ever so gently while he comes to a slow, twitching end.",1145145600,,1894,4.524926686217009

1807077,4,B00007DWRG,"For those of us who have already ""met"" Christian Slater and Marisa Tomei in their star-making roles, ""Untamed Heart"" offers a series of pleasant surprises to go along with a tear-jerker of a plot.

Slater has made a career out of channeling Jack Nicholson into Generation X roles in such movies as ""Heathers"" and ""True Romance"" (which also came out in 1993, at the same time as ""Untamed Heart"").  In these movies, Slater is the smart-*ss with the devilish grin and irresistable command of the quip.  Adam, his role in ""Untamed Heart,"" could not be a further departure from Clarence of ""True Romance.""  An orphan with a weak heart, Adam speaks seldom but feels deeply, even though he's never had a relationship with a woman.  As a busboy and janitor for a small-time Minneapolis diner, he falls in a big way for Carolina (Marisa Tomei), a waitress at the diner.  But even though Adam feels big feelings for Caroline, Slater wisely restrains himself - I don't think we even get a single arched eyebrow!

Caroline is also a departure for Tomei from the wise-cracking Noo Yawka she played in her career-making ""My Cousin Vinnie.""  Caroline is one of those girls everyone knows in high school but never appears in the movies -- a cute gal whose talents lie buried under massive self-esteem issues.  Soft-spoken except with her family and fellow waitresses, Caroline is forever starting ventures but never finishing them.  We also get the sense that Caroline has gotten ""familiar"" with a lotta guys over the years.

Adam thwarts an ugly attempted rape as two guys ""escort"" Caroline home on a chilly night.  In a lesser movie, Caroline would have instantly jumped into the sack with her hero to ""reward"" him for his chivalry, but Caroline regards Adam with a confused wariness that's quite believable.  This reserve gradually melts, and soon Adam and Caroline are engaged in a very serious courtship -- Caroline is serious about Adam because he seems genuine, and Adam is serious about Caroline because he's incapable of being any other way.

These two characters truly merge on-screen into a believable couple, and their dialogue, while unusual, never ring false or contrived.  Indeed, this movie rings true with all the hallmarks of ""regular folks"" just getting by with their daily lives.  Even though it's set in Minnesota and has a few laughs, don't go looking for ""Fargo""-style humor about Minnesotans.  Even Rosie Perez, who can go as broad as humanly possible with the stereotypical Latina behavior, dials it down a notch or two in her role as Caroline's best friend, Cindy.  Notice the look in her eye when she tells Caroline that Adam is, in a sense, ""sponge-worthy.""  Even though it's funny, she doesn't really play it for laughs -- this is the kind of evaluation that occurs when you're closing up on the graveyard shift at the local diner.

A restrained ""chick flick,"" ""Untamed Heart"" is a must for the film library if you're a fan of ""weepies"" (you know, ""Terms of Endearment,"" ""Love Story,"" and the like).  While I'm not a huge fan of the sub-genre of romance films, I have to say that ""Untamed Heart"" offered a surprising amount of truth in its well-drawn, well-acted characters.  (The soundtrack offers a lot of gems, too, including the Cowboy Junkies doing ""Moon River.  A big clue as to the movie's plot comes from the constant use of ""Nature Boy"" from ""Moulin Rouge,"" too.)",1120521600,,3385,4.82842287694974
1807078,1,B00007DWRG,"This has to be one of the worst ""romantic"" movies I've ever seen.  From the very beginning, you know you're in for punishment just because Marisa Tomei's character Caroline is such a ditz, and only a ditz would fall for another of her kind.  Christian Slater as Adam is totally unbelievable.  Come on, nobody is that dumb...are they?  All old spaghetti face does is mope and whine about why ""this always happens to me"" as Rosie Perez turns her Mistah Kottah accent up to an annoying eleven throughout the entire film.  ""I'd doooo 'im if he wasn't so **** dumb!""  Yeah, sweetheart, and if you were a rocket scientist you wouldn't be fencing with your girlfriend in a diner with flyswatters.  Best you start jumping Adam's ribs right now.

Wow, this is a really shallow and stupid story that just goes from bad to worse.  Adam has a bad heart, and he actually grows up believing the nuns' goofy stories about how he had a baboon's heart, so he thinks nothing of fighting some creeps who try to rape Caroline after her shift is over at the restaurant.  The result?  She falls in love with a guy who's dumber than a box of rocks and lives with his dog under a bridge.

Throughout the film, we are pummeled with horrible dialogue.  For example:  ""I have fallen!""  ""Did you hurt yourself?""  Ugh, I think I'm going to spew chunks!  Worst of all, Dum-Dum doesn't know what a hockey puck is, yet he catches a flying one in his hand without breaking something or screaming out in pain, and hands it to Caroline.  Have you had enough?  Not only do Tomei and Slater make a highly mismatched couple in this badly written excuse for a romance, but their chemistry--and I use the term loosely--couldn't cover a ritz cracker with the aid of a good knife.  Spare yourself.  If you want to see some good romance films, try Serendipity (which is predictable, but lovely in every way), While You Were Sleeping, or an old and wonderful classic like Breakfast at Tiffany's.  If you must see this embarrassing mess, make sure you rent it first.",1119744000,,2021,4.54016620498615

1807083,5,B00007DWRG,"Where do I begin? This is one of my most favorite romantic movies of all time! To say it was sweet and yet sad does not even begin to do it justice. This movie draws you in heart and soul. You feel sorry for Adam's tragic life of being left alone as a child because of his bad heart. Then you feel bad for him because he is alone as an adult. Yet at the same time, you feel bad that Caroline can't find love or a decent guy to share time with. Then she finds Adam! When Adam saves her from two rapists, you can't help but believe that chivalry is alive again! You can see Slater and Tomei's chemistry together and they just seem to ""fit"". One of the most touching parts of the movie for me was when Caroline was cutting Adam's hair and they had a beautiful conversation and he opened his heart about being alone because the Nuns felt it better not to hurt his health by letting him be out with people. Slater did an excellent job of portraying his loneliness, but he also showed a gentleness you don't see in the movies much these days.  Adam (Slater) opens up to Caroline and she sees that he has a heart of gold. Caroline (Tomei) did an excellent job taking Adam's love and the two fell in deep! If you love romance movies, you will love this! You will be rooting for the characters all the way! This movie is one you can watch over and over again and never get tired of it.

Sadly, the plot was somewhat predictable and didn't do justice to what could have been a great theme. The script failed to challenge, choosing instead to sporadically produce some touching dialogue that draws you gently into the story but never quite reaches any significant depth. If this were music it would be in the 'easy listening' category which is a shame because there could have been so much more. Worth watching however in spite of that, especially if you enjoyed the likes of Notting Hill or My Best Friend's Wedding.",1079913600,,642,5.066037735849057
1807085,5,B00007DWRG,"""Untamed Heart"" is one of my favorite movies! It revolves around a shy, introverted young man named Adam who has fallen in love with one of his co-workers. Every night he walks her home (she doesn't know he's doing it until something drastic happens) to make sure she's safe.
Once she sees that Adam is a kind, gentle (almost child-like) soul and isn't the weird guy she always thought, she discovers herself falling just as much in love with him. The bad thing is that Adam's heart, which has been ravaged by disease, is ceasing to work as well as it once had. Adam has tough choice to make: receive a new heart from a donor or keep his heart and love her the way he had in the past (side note: Adam felt that if he lost his original heart he wouldn't love her the same.
This film will definitely tug on your heart strings and make you believe in love regardless of what others tell you or how someone is perceived. If it's strong enough, love can withstand all. I would highly recommend this film!",1052870400,,999,4.347593582887701

1807087,5,B00007DWRG,"This film is an unlikely romance that works on many levels. Deftly directed by Tony Bill who shows a penchant for handling delicate sentiments as if they were gossamer threads, this film is truly one of the most  romantic that I have seen. That this is so, despite the fact that many of the most romantic moments take place in a downtown Minneapolis diner, a dingy basement apartment,  the front porch of a house in a blue collar, working class neighborhood, or in an old dilapidated clunker of a car, is a testament to the ability of the director.
Marisa Tomei is luminous as  Caroline, the Minneapolis waitress with self-esteem problems who looks for love in all the wrong places, before finding it right where she works. She imbues Caroline with just the right measure of street smarts, working class edge, and little girl vulnerability. She is a needy, though nice, young woman who desperately wants to love and be loved.  Unfortunately, the guys she meets tend to treat her as a one night stand. Sensitive and romantic Adam, the reticent and quirky busboy who works the night shift with Caroline, is just what the doctor ordered.
As Adam, Caroline's veritable knight in shining armor, Christian Slater gives his best performance ever. An orphan with a disability that he cloaks with an intriguing story, Adam is a true romantic hero. His quiet sincerity, delicate sensibilities, and apparent contentment in worshipping from afar touch Caroline, tugging at her heart strings. You see, he treats her as if she were a princess rather than as a strumpet.  Christian Slater's sensitive and moving performance in a difficult role strikes just the right note. I would bet that nearly every woman who watches this film succumbs to his charms and finds herself half falling in love with him.

The film seems to tell the viewer that once one has love in one's grasp, hold it tightly, as one never knows what the fates may have in store. Though the ending may be somewhat predictable, it will not stop the viewer from needing a hanky. This is a wonderful film that will greatly appeal to those viewers with a romantic streak in their hearts. Beautifully directed and with superlative performances by Marissa Tomei and Christian Slater, it is a film that merits being in one's personal collection.",1048723200,,2290,4.829081632653061
1807088,4,B00007DWRG,"It is rare to come across a movie such as Untamed Heart.  Firstly, it's a Hollywood movie with a Hollywood cast.  Secondly, it's a love story.  Put the two together and you are bound to come up with something so sugary and sickening you'll want to throw up.  How then did this movie get to be so good?  The story is strong, structured and will stay in the mind (I first saw it around 1995 and have now, 2002, got the DVD) the acting is first class, with Tomei an absolute gem as always.  The biggest surprise of this movie was the ending.  If this had been typical Hollywood fodder, then you could have seen the sunset, smiles and happy-ending a mile off, but this movie remains defiant until the last, delivering one surprise after another, before you have to admit that you really don't know what's coming next in a movie as unpredicatable as life itself.

I thought oh it's probrably one of those lame movies where the actors have no chemestry and a pretictable ending like he dies in a hospital bed and she's weeping or something  and that's ow it ends . No way folks this is so much better. The chemistry really works well for tomei and slater. I love the part when he rescues her from the two creeps who try to rape her. And he so sweet about it how he covers her up with his coat after the creeps rip open her shirt. I love the fact that he wants to take care of her.ooh and in another pivotal scene is when after she thanks him for saving her he tells her that  usually every night he would fllow her home to make sure she got home safe then says that on that night he was sorry he was late . ooh you have to see what I mean watch the movie.if by any chance any one is a fan of GH then you may see some similiarities t the story line between lucky and liz.it's very much the same romantic way.

Rosie Perez' character is typically annoying, but not as much of a distraction as she normally is in films, because you spend most of the film pining for Caroline & Adam to be together.
Yeah, sometimes the plot seems silly/dumb, but so is life :-)
If you have seen ""Before Sunrise,"" ""Bed Of Roses,"" and other similar movies and enjoyed them, then you'll like this one too. I wouldn't be surprised if James Cameron lifted a little from this movie for ""Titanic.""

1807096,4,B00007DWRG,"Untamed Heart stars Christian Slater, Marisa Tomei, and Rosie Perez.  All three work in a diner where Slater is a busboy, while Tomei and Perez play waitresses.  Tomei plays Caroline, and is kind of a ditzy girl, but very sweet.  Seems she has a problem with the boys she goes out with, in that they don't treat her particularly well, cheating on her and such.  Perez plays Cindy, the more streetwise friend who tries to help Caroline out when she can, setting her up on dates, and commiserating with her when things go poorly.  Slater plays Adam, a quiet and shy person who has a crush on Caroline.  Cindy thinks Adam is mentally disabled, since he very rarely says two words, but Caroline sees him a little different, with more of an understanding attitude, but not as a romantic interest, at least at the beginning of the movie.

As the movie progresses, we see Adam saving Caroline from a particularly nasty situation when she is attacked by two men on her way home from work one night.  When she finds out it was Adam that saved her and cared for her, she begins to look beneath the surface at Adam, and finds more than she expected.  She learns of his feelings for her, and they develop a relationship, and fall in love.  Actually, Adam has always been in love with Caroline, so it's just Caroline who comes around feeling for Adam what he feels for her.  In getting to know Adam, Caroline learns that Adam was an orphan with a weak heart, and the nuns in the orphanage gave him some story about him having a baboon heart, which he still believed to this day.  Their relationship is very sweet, as we see Adam's unrequited love fulfill, and Caroline finds someone who treats her the way she should be treated, the way anybody should be treated, with love, caring, thoughtfulness, and respect.  Well, things are going really well, until the two guys that attacked Caroline and were subsequently beat up by Adam show up again and are looking for revenge on Adam.  I don't want to go any further, as that would spoil things for someone who hasn't seen this yet, but I really liked how this movie ended.

I guess one of the reasons I like this movie so much is I could kind of identify with Slater's character, being awkward and shy myself in school.  I know how it was to have a deep crush on someone, and yet not be able to bring yourself to tell that person how you feel.  Sometimes it can be difficult to keep that kind of thing inside, but then if you let it out, there is a good chance that you may spoil the fantasy with the harsh reality.  There were one or two points in the movie when I did tear up a little, and that doesn't happen often for me while watching movies (Old Yeller, Pride of the Yankees, Goodbye Mr. Chips).  Slater plays his character well, and Tomei is incredibly cute and seems to pull off the sort of ditzy, but sweet and caring girl quite well.  Perez also does a good job in her role.  A sweet and sappy movie, for sure, but very watchable.  Not much with regards to special features, but you do get an excellent wide screen presentation.",1000944000,,3071,4.407801418439717

There's one disturbing scene of abuse, but otherwise  Untamed Heart is a sensitive, gentle love story with genuine performances  by talented actors.  It will touch you and make you both laugh and cry.",948931200,,664,4.857142857142857

7975260,2,B00007DWRG,third class movie -- definitely not worth spending time exclusively to watch it - for multi-tasking is ok - even then somewhat stupid - but some nice parts too therefore not 1 star.,1524441600,,181,4.515151515151516

7975262,5,B00007DWRG,I have always loved this film because I love Christian Slater. I can't watch it very often because it takes an emotional toll.,1522195200,,126,4.521739130434782

7975264,2,B00007DWRG,I was recommended from a friend to watch this and so I finally rented it and was super pumped and total bomb! I didn't like the acting or the story at all. My friend says I have no heart lol. Anyway I didn't like it.,1519084800,,216,3.8222222222222224
