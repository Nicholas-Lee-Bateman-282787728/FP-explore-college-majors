8087612,2,B000BK7XJA,"If you are a Protestant heir to the radical Protestant Reformation, or rather Protestant Re-Invention, wishing to suppress historical facts that would undermine the foundations of Protestantism, this DVD product is for you.  If you are a Protestant desiring to expose yourself to the fulness of the Christian faith of the early Church, I recommend not wasting your money or time on this product.  I would recommend reading the writings of the following Bishops of the early Church to get a clearer picture of the early church, uncensored by Protestant revisionism: Ignatius of Antioch, Polycarp of Smyrna, Irenaeus of Lugdunum, Hippolytus of Rome, Basil of Cappadocia, Gregory of Nazianzus, Gregory of Nyssa, Cyril of Jerusalem, John Chrysostom of Constantinople, Athanasius of Alexandria, Cyril of Alexandria, John of Damascus, and of the two Orthodox Christian monastics John Cassian and Maximus the Confessor.  Start with them--some of the primary original documenters of Church history.  It may not always be the prettiest picture of Christian history or even the most accurate, but I would think it would be more accurate than Protestant actors following a Protestant script, portraying early Christians who predated Protestantism by at least a thousand years.",1367625600,2,1265,5.438775510204081
