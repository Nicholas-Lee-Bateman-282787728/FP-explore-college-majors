6069891,5,B005OTP7FU,"This movie is a classic and one of Gordon Liu's better films.  The plot is actually good, and it has some of the best bo staff fighting in a movie.  I prefer subtitles, but the English dub isn't bad.  All in all if you like old Shaw Brothers movies you'll like this.",1454198400,,266,4.076923076923077
6069892,5,B005OTP7FU,"Eight Diagram Pole Fighter: An honest review:

I consider one of the top 5 martial arts films of all time, alongwith 36 chamber, drunken master, drunken master 2 etc.
Here are a few reasons:
1) A shaw brothers classic
2) Directed by Lau Kar Leung and starring Gordon Liu and Fu Sheng
3) The beginning and ending are both just amazing (more bloodshed in the beginning which I didn't like though !)
4) I consider this the swamsong of Gordon Liu (more than 36 Chamber ! simply because of the ending and the end fight scenes, they are legendary)
5) The script is really amazing-Brothers fighting for the survival of their clan.
6) Kara Hui has a significant role & some good fightscenes, whereever I find she has a good role, that movie excels..

Don't miss this awesome classic, just because of the other reviews. I watched this movie over 10 times and still don't get bored, coz its a Kung fu Classic..",1442361600,,900,4.515337423312883

6069927,5,B005OTP7FU,"My first Review... Back in the 80's I watched these on Local TV on occasional Saturdays. Now on Prime I been watching steadily "" Kung-fu Theater"" this one really stands out to the  for for the past week o so. This one really stands out  to the rest.",1479945600,2,249,4.166666666666667
8621977,5,B005OTP7FU,"I'm rating this film from a simple lover of martial arts films. This film is stacked full of stars, first and foremost Gordon lieu from the 36th Chamber! There are many others that have played good and evil roles, and if your a watcher like me who has spanned 20+ years of watching then you will recognize all of them. This film was great, knowing all the styles and strengths of the character portrayed help to reinforce the choreography and what you would expect them to do or accomplish. I had been wanting to watch this film for a long time but never did, I finally watched the trailer and liked what i saw.",1525132800,,611,4.368421052631579
8621978,4,B005OTP7FU,"This movie is dubbed in English.  It would have been better if it wasn't dubbed, and kept the original language.  The story is about a period during the Song Dynasty when the Chinese emperor is fighting the Mongolian army.  A well respected, famous and loyal general to the emperor with a family of seven sons and two daughters is betrayed by a partner general who was fighting with him in a battle against Mongols.  In that battle, the partner general Pan Mei who betrayed the family caused the death of the famous general Yang and five of his sons.  Two remaining sons escaped, one returned home mad as in crazy while the other joined a temple to be a monk.  The traitor general and the mongols searched everywhere for the two sons to prevent them from reporting to the emperor that his own army has Mongolian supporters/spies.  While the enemies searched, one of the daughters went to find her brother who is the monk to get him safely home in order to report to the emperor about the situation.  However, she was kidnapped by the bad guys and the monk now has to rescue her after hearing about it.  The kung-fu choreography in this film was well done.

The Eight Diagram Pole Fighter is a famous Hong Kong movie because this movie was produced in 1983, and the famous actor who plays the mad son, Fu Sheng, died in the middle of production due to a freak auto accident.  Thus, he never re-appeared in the latter half of this movie, and the story had to be partially re-written for Gordon Liu, the actor who played the monk, to be the focus of the movie.  Fu Sheng was as famous as Bruce Lee in Hong Kong at the time due to the many kung-fu movies he was in, thus, his funeral had just as huge of a crowd as that of Bruce Lee.  He had been in movies since 1971 and was an actor for over a decade playing along side many other famous Hong Kong movie stars.  Fu Sheng did his own stunts and martial arts scenes that caused him to injure his head and leg during his time as an actor.  This was his last film and his talents are greatly missed as he was well liked by movie goers during his time.",1524268800,,2095,4.281725888324873
8621979,3,B005OTP7FU,"Not as good as the hype.  Story is jumbled due rewrites necessitated by the death of the original lead.  But while the fights are fairly epic, they are too over the top and feel over choreographed.
The main character's motivation is clear, but his behavior doesn't fit the mold, and he's fairly unlikable.  The message that it's OK to kill, even for a Shaolin monk, as long as you do some mental jujitsu, doesn't sit well either",1518480000,,428,4.532467532467533
8621980,5,B005OTP7FU,"this has got to be the one of Liu Chia-hui, best kung fu movies none stop action",1514332800,,80,3.764705882352941
8621981,4,B005OTP7FU,"The stars are for the incredibly cool staff fighting. The film is kind of difficult to watch at times because the heroes do soooo many stupid things, and they scream. The scream a lot.

That said, if you watch it with the volume turned down, and appreciate the classical kung fu its possible to enjoy it.",1504310400,,304,4.428571428571429
8621982,5,B005OTP7FU,"Much like Jet Lis Hero is the prequel to Bruce Lees legendary Fist of Fury, Eight Diagram Pole Fighter is the prequel to Shaw Brothers critically acclaimed film 14 Amazons. It tells the story of what happened to the Yang men when they were challenged to a duel to the death & how one of the surviving sons of that slaughter, the 5th Yang brother (Gordon Liu) hones his skills to ultimately face his enemies in an all-out finale for the ages. This is directed by the famed Lia Chia Liang who is known for such classics as 36th Chamber of Shaolin & that series of films, Heroes of the East, Shaolin Mantis, My Young Auntie as well as hundreds of films in which he was the action director.

The movie reads as a whos who in the SB universe at that time: Lily Li as Mother Yang, Hui Ying Hung as the 8th Yang sister, Fu Sheng as 6th Yang in his final performance on film, Wong Yu as 1st Yang, Liu Chia Yung as 2nd Yang, Robert Mak as 3rd Yang, Hsiao Ho as 4th Yang, Chang Chan Peng as 7th Yang, Ke Ming as the traitorous General Pan Mei, Wang Lung Wei & Chu Te Hu as the leaders of the Mongol forces, Phillip Ko as one of the Shaolin abbots, Yang Ching Ching as 9th Yang sister as well as sneak appearances from Yuen Tak & the director himself. The action is the finest youll ever see in martial arts. The plot is pretty good playing off of the famous story of the loyalty from the Yang family. This, to me at least, is Liu Chia Liangs finest hour in the directors chair. And the crazy part is that its a departure from his normal fare because it has zero comedy in it! If you haven't had this by now & you're a kung fu fan, it is an absolute MUST SEE!!! And its a welcome indoctrination into the martial arts genre for newbies or those curious about the kung fu  phenomenon",1498521600,2,1770,4.11271676300578
8621983,3,B005OTP7FU,"Decent flick, though the final fight was a little weak",1486598400,,54,4.5
8621984,4,B005OTP7FU,"This was a good straight film.
Good Shaw brothers expecting a standard film, I got it.
The action is good and plot was ok but again, what do you expect from Shaw. Some bad dubbing, (watched it on mute with subtitles helps) and some choreographed action made it very watchable.",1486166400,,276,4.54
8621985,2,B005OTP7FU,A bit too old fashioned for my taste.  And overly stilted.,1485993600,,58,4.2727272727272725
8621986,1,B005OTP7FU,B Rated poor character stars very bad  ..,1485734400,,41,4.125
