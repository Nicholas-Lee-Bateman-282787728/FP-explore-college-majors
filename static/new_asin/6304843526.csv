7878200,4,6304843526,"I bought this video set at our local library's sale bin. I have taught world history for 20 years and AP World History. The graphics and styles are dated but they are informative for those willing to learn. My video had professors and professionals explaining the events. Some were older and had British accents. These are not for casual students of history, they are too detailed for the general populace. If you are expecting drama and lots of computer generated images you will be disappointed but if you want to learn some details of history I would recommend them.",1371513600,,569,4.757575757575758

7878202,1,6304843526,"My eighth grade students had difficulty understanding the dialogue.  In particular, there was one presenter that I had difficulty understanding even though I teach this topic in World History.  I had to strain my ears to make out what he was saying.

I would not have used this particular person to present information orally. I'm not sure whether is was an accent or just a peculiar speech pattern.",1102464000,,399,4.838235294117647
7878203,1,6304843526,Because of the bad imag of the Iranian government in the western world. They use the time to creat this politically motivated and racist video. I suggest you never buy ths video. full of wrong information and propaganda.,1101254400,2,220,4.815789473684211
7878204,5,6304843526,"I thoroughly enjoyed this all-to-short treatment of the Gallic Wars, and particularly liked the inclusion of social and political information about the Celts. Not being a historian or an anthropologist, I cannot judge the accuracy of the movie's content, but it was well done and consistent with what little I know about Roman history and culture. The actor who played Julius Ceasar presented his character just as I have always imagined him.",1020297600,,442,5.152777777777778

7878206,2,6304843526,"If you know some history and want to know a little more, this tape set may have information that is new to you.  I have a very moderate amature's knowledge of history, mostly from reading a fair amount (no college history course work, for example - I am an engineer and avoided that stuff in college).  However, considering how much the producers of this tape could have done, the results are disappointing.  Quality productions may not have more than a few bad actors usable for ""reinactments"", as is the case with these tapes, but what they can do that us civilians can't is get access to portions of museums not usually open to the public, interview heads of private collections, museums, and the more prominent folks in the field, and put together simple but reasonably historically accurate graphical presentations using maps and simple computer graphics showing how things flowed and progressed as time passed.  None of this was done very well on these tapes.  The tapes have about as little of this as one can get and still fall in the range of professional productions.  In addition, the reproduction in SLP is inexcusable.  The tracking needs constant adjustment.  I accepted this 15 years ago when tapes were expensive, but tape is super cheap now.  The poor quality of SLP is not worth the $.001/tape saved, given the extra annoyance it ""provides"" for consumers.
My summary would be as follows: if you really like history and haven't investigated the battles covered by the tapes in other ways or forums, they are OK even if annoying due to the poor reproduction and lower-end production effort that was spent.  If you are not dedicated to the material, these tapes will be a turn-off due to their mediocre production coupled with the poor reproduction in VHS SLP.",996278400,2,1775,4.8283828382838285
7878207,1,6304843526,"In the introductory comments, the narrator starts off by saying how this video chronicles the battles between the ""civilized"" Greeks and the ""savage"" Persians (Iranians).  The same Persians, mind you, that at the time of the battles ruled most of the civilized world under the auspices of the first human rights doctrine in documented history.  The program's opening statement speaks volumes about the one-sidedness of the entire video.  The producers of this supposedly factual historic program aren't even good enough at their work to be able to effectively PRETEND to be unbiased.
Save your money.  If you want to watch fabricated half-truths, buy a standard Hollywood produced gladiator movie.  At least they are more entertaining.",995328000,16,735,5.356521739130435
7878208,3,6304843526,"Battles That Changed the World provides surprising academic depth for students of history.  Detailed descriptions of battle strategies are well placed in their respective historical contexts, enabling the viewer to understand not only battle tactics but the prevailing political and strategic climates that prevailed at the time.  For the casual student of history, the content of the videos will prove educational, although not enlightening.
It is a shame that such a valuable historical resource for historical hobbyists and students is handicapped by poor production quality.  From the repetitive battle re-enactment scenes shot with a minimum of extras, to sloppy editing, to the questionable decision to produce in Extended Play VHS format, the production quality greatly detracts from the overall experience.
While you will certainly get a solid recounting of the historical importance of each of the battles, you may find it hard to bear with the quality of the production.",974246400,5,980,5.52
7878209,2,6304843526,"This video concerns itself with the situation in and around Boston in 1775.  The British occupation and siege of Boston, subsequent campaigns to Lexington and Concord, and the Battle of Bunker Hill are all covered.  The  film's commentary and content are factually based.  Overall, this video is  a good synposis of the topic for the novice historian.
I was expecting a  more in depth coverage of the battle and was disappointed by the  ahistorical uniforms and battle reenactments.  The British reenactors were  incorrectly uniformed in the 7 Years War / French and Indian War era.  Also, indians were depicted fighting in the battle and historically there  were none present.",923011200,12,677,5.1192660550458715
