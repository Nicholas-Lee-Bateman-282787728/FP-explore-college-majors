6097392,1,B00GOYC3DI,The only good part of this movie is at the end when the credits rolled.  Very bad acting and not funny horror either,1393804800,,116,4.043478260869565
6097393,1,B00GOYC3DI,"When I sat down to watch SORORITY PARTY MASSACRE, I expected it to be bad. But I expected it to be FUN bad. Campy, gory, gratuitously nudey, tongue-in-cheek bad. The kind of bad that you and your friends can get a kick out of. MST3K bad.

Not so.

This movie IS bad, but in a bad way. It is bad because it fails to fully deliver any of the things you might expect, and it is generally so ineptly done that it becomes annoying even just to pay attention to it. Let me explain.

#1: The intended audience here is obviously young, horny guys. Too bad for them. The T&A is negligible at best. You'd get more skin looking at a JCPenny underwear catalog. Also, it is quite clear that NONE of these girls belong to a sorority. Most of them look like they're in their 30s. One of them is quite clearly 40-something. I'm not saying older women can't be sexy, and I'm not saying that a movie has to have nudity to be good. I'm saying a movie entitled SORORITY PARTY MASSACRE generally leads its audience to expect titillation of a certain type, and there is none of that here. None.

#2: The ""massacre"" is bush-league at best. Aside from an opening that is halfway-decent only because it shamelessly rips off the first SCREAM film, there is no real attempt at the kinds of gory SFX that movies with ""massacre"" in the title tend to have in spades. Instead, you've got maybe half a barrel of corn syrup and a ton of hasty, horribly edited cut-aways at the moment something scary or brutal is supposed to happen.

#3: The movie IS funny in that baffling, partially intended way that you might expect, but the comedy is spotty. The story, regrettably, ends up taking itself seriously by the end, and as the movie limps and shuffles along, the gags and self-referential moments grow shorter and rarer. It could've been a not-entirely-wasted experience had the flick not tried so weakly to also be scary and sexy when it should've just banked on its complete lunacy.

#4: Technically, the film is a nightmare. The soundtrack thinks it's a lot better than it is, and the volume of the dialogue and score is uneven. If you turn your sound up to hear the mumbled, barely coherent dialogue, keep the remote in your hand, because you WILL be walloped with a blast of sound when the music blares out of nowhere and for no reason, as happens approximately 76 times. Include an overly complex plot and a weird stab at backstory that comes out of left field, as well as horrendous make-up, costuming, and a total inability to frame most scenes or provide establishing shots, and you've got a movie that is hard to understand simply because you can't see or hear most of what's really going on.

So, a warning: you might think this film would be a fun, silly way to relive the 80's slasher-era sexy-serial-killer-romps, but you're better off just getting one of those old flicks instead of trying to relive them through this garbage.",1392681600,14,2907,4.525714285714286
6097394,2,B00GOYC3DI,"Sorority Party Massacre sounds like it would be in the vein of 80's cult classics like Slumber Party Massacre and Sorority House Massacre. Wrong! This movie is a mess. The opening sequence rips off Scream. From there, it barely qualifies as a slasher movie. It's more of a crime drama, to tell you the truth. Most of the deaths occur offscreen. Very disappointing!",1392076800,,364,4.7936507936507935
6097395,1,B00GOYC3DI,"I've seen some terrible b budget films, but this one actually made me feel ""dumber"" by the end. Don't waste your money!!",1392076800,,120,4.5
6097396,5,B00GOYC3DI,"I miss 80's horror movies and was happy to find this flick. The comedy was light, the characters were quirky and odd and it felt like Twin Peaks without the bizarre midgets. Don't want to give too much away, but make sure you watch the entire credits. Wish more independent filmmakers were making these kind of films.",1391817600,,317,4.578947368421052
6097397,4,B00GOYC3DI,"If you like your horror-comedies served up funny and gory with sexy women in the mix, then you are certainly in luck.  SORORITY PARTY MASSACRE combines all three aspects, and the result is a fun and humorous slasher.  And just like the title suggests, theres plenty of bodies to go around!

Ok, confession time:  I didn't realize this was a horror-comedy until about 20 minutes in to the film.  I honestly thought it was supposed to be serious horroreven with Ron Jeremys name in the credits!  But, once I realized what it was, the film was much easier to enjoy.

SORORITY PARTY MASSACRE is one of those films that is perfect to watch with a group of friends.  I found myself laughing at certain scenes and then yelling at the characters to warn them in the next; while not a perfect or high budget film, it is still entertaining and immersive, a movie that you and your friends will enjoy yelling at together.

The acting is pretty good and the titular ladies in the film are all beautiful.  I particularly like how the casting crew found so many different types of personalities to play the leads.  From butch and powerful to cunning and petite, each girl brings a different persona to the table.  And as a result, the cat fights are almost as much fun to watch as the killings.

The special effects are not bad however we don't get to see too much carnage.  Even in a horror-comedy, I still enjoy a nice dose of gore.  There are some nice shots of a bee-sting victim and even some grisly acid burn effectsbut there could have been sooooo much more as well.  Still, this is not a huge detractor, but more of a personal preference.

The story in SORORITY PARTY MASSACRE is pretty good as well, although a couple of the twists are just thrown in for comedic effect.  Since this film does not take itself too seriously, they work well for the plot and are fun to see unfold.  My sole complaint about the plot is that some of it is left unexplained, although its nothing that will keep you up at night.

SORORITY PARTY MASSACRE is a fun, low-key film that fans of horror-comedies should enjoy.  I recommend it, although I can tell you right now that this won't be for everyone.  The film hits store shelves next week if you want to give it a look.",1391731200,4,2245,4.4376528117359415
6097398,2,B00GOYC3DI,"A group of sorority girls head up to a ranch on Grizzly Cove to compete in a contest. Holly (Casey Fitzgerald) the daughter of a police officer is killed in the first scene.  An over aggressive police officer on probation is sent up to keep on eye on Holly. The girls competing are introduced grindhouse style and they are some tough party animals. As the body count starts, this turns into a who done it, with a twist at every turn.

I liked the opening and first part of the film. As the film progressed, the slasher aspect was low budget with no great kill scenes. It was if they combined a grindhouse with a made for TV film forgetting their target audience. If you are going to title a film ""Sorority Party Massacre"" you need to have a sorority party and some decent massacring. This fell short.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. Minor girl/girl action. Brief nudity.",1387756800,5,863,4.519230769230769

8625746,3,B00GOYC3DI,"Sorority Party Massacre is a clich slasher comedy that knows it is a clich slasher comedy. It plays up the vapid superficial aspects of bimbo meets death as if the films very life depended on it. It is not a spoof horror comedy though because the darkness is and atmosphere of classic slasher horror is very well present in the film. However the ridiculousness of the characters and melodramatic acting is just too much to consider the flick a straight up slasher flick. At times it feels a little too Prom Night III and at other moments it is very Sorority Row. The story is layered with typical sub-plots and explanations that can pass as long as you don't get too in depth with the films story. The gore and kill shots are well done and very entertaining. This film is not a stellar work of slasher horror movie making but it warrants respect for the simple fact that it is a very fun, slasher comedy that brings the babes and the blood. It manages to capture the atmosphere and classic style of 80s slasher, as well as the campy comedy of satire. The film doesnt really bring anything knew to the genre but it doesnt take anything from it either. I enjoyed the movie.",1432598400,,1171,4.4511627906976745
8625747,3,B00GOYC3DI,"The movie was decent as far as the initial mystery of who the villian was attacking the girls. However, when they started to have multiple villians the movie got carried away. I think it would have been better to only have one villian. The acting was alright, obviously some were better then others. I always liked Kevi nSorbo in Hercules, but in here he does not have much screen time.

I thought the deaths were fairly interesting as far as victims were killed in what they fear the most. The outdoor scenery was O.K, but they did not seem to show case the isolation enough of the mansion.

Overall you could do alot worse, and it is not a bad way to kill some time if you feel like having something to watch on a Sunday afternoon.",1427241600,,733,4.343065693430657
8625748,2,B00GOYC3DI,"Sorority Party Massacre starts out with a scene that is familiar but staged well enough to be promising--a reasonably hot blonde sorority sister stops late at night at what appears to be an all night body shop to get directions because she's lost and her lap dog needs to pee.  There's nobody around even though everything is lit up.  Her phone rings--there's a creepy voice that at first appears to be a crank but the caller knows her name.  He asks what her biggest fear is and says he'll kill her and her dog if she doesn't answer.  She tries to get away but her car has been tampered with.  She tries to run but ends up murdered in an extremely gruesome and sadistic manner.  Then a slick credit sequence comes one--sinister Atticus Ross style music and images suggesting sex and violence and more sex.

Then the post credits sequence movie starts and it immediately turns into a very broad comedy.  Huh?

The plot involves William Watts (Thomas Downey) a California police detective with serious anger management issues--a montage of his many recent offenses starts off with him repeatedly beating a suspect in the balls unaware that a cyclist is filming everything with his cell phone to an incident where he runs over a little boy's bicycle over and over ""In my defense chief my sister dropped the charges as soon as I paid for a new bike"" and a second incident involving a child where a little boy ends up crying with an ice cream cone on top of his head.  Two incidents involving children seems like overkill but Sorority Park Massacre clearly wasn't made by very smart people.

Detective Watts is going to be suspended for a month but gets it knocked down to a week by agreeing to check on his chief's missing daughter, who happens to be the girl that was murdered in the pre-credits sequence.  It's only the next morning and the chief (Kevin Sorbo, having fun with his one scene) can't get in touch with his daughter but at this point there's no reason to believe that anything really bad has happened to her.

Detective Watts arrives in Grizzly Cove where an exclusive yearly sorority contest is being held and meets the local sheriff Barney Lumpkin (Ed O'Ross, the best thing in the movie by a wide margin) and his deputy.  The chief's daughter never arrived and then a girl at the sorority function turns up dead even though the sheriff insists that nothing ever happens there.  Detective Watts wants to go back to the police station to check on things and quickly discovers that at least a dozen other young women have vanished from the immediate area over the years--although both the sheriff and his deputy claim to know nothing about that, which might be because they have no computer and have no idea how to work their fax machine.

The rest of the movie finds the big city detective and country bumpkin sheriff at the large estate where the sorority event is being held, trying with little success to keep anyone else from getting murdered.

The comedy in Sorority Party Massacre is very hit and miss with way too much of the latter but every once in a while the movie lands a goofy gag that actually works.  The makers of Sorority Park Massacre don't take the material seriously enough to create any interest in who might be the killer or in staging cool murder scenes--the fact that the murders could have provided some much-needed sight gags seems to have not occurred to the filmmakers at all.

The actresses playing the sorority sisters mostly don't make much of an impression and little effort is made to give their characters individual personalities.  The best is Marissa Skell who plays the seemingly nice Paige and gets to deliver a pretty funny line concerning her breasts.  Keith Compton earns a few laughs as Aggo, a mentally challenged hand who lives in the stables and turns up suspiciously at more than one murder scene.  Thomas Downey who plays the big city police detective never seems to figure out if he's supposed to be funny or if he's a straight man in the middle of all the lunacy (think Leslie Nielsen or Robert Stack in Airplane!)--since he's the lead Downey ends up being one of the movie's bigger problems.  The film's only real standout is Ed O'Ross as country bumpkin Sheriff Barney P. Lumpkin who seems oblivious and stupid and proves to be the movie's only reliable source of laughs.

Sorority Party Massacre is a silly, sloppy mess that delivers too few laughs and has a lazy script that barely makes any attempt to provide a coherent storyline, strong villain or coherent motivation for its many murders.  It also inexplicably punts completely on providing gory or amusing murders with the exception of the opening scene--and why that is played completely straight is really hard to fathom--it honestly feels like the opening scene came from an entirely different movie that was abandoned.  Sorority Party Massacre does provide a small handful of laughs and is generally painless to watch but that's not enough to justify spending 103 minutes of your life sitting through it--life is way too short to waste any of it sitting through crap like this.  Unless you are extremely stoned or drunk or in desperate need for something silly you should likely steer clear of Sorority Park Massacre.",1424044800,,5242,4.719298245614035
