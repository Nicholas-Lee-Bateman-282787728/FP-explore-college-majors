324867,3,6301175220,"I knew it would be silly & cheesy before I clicked the ""View"" button and I was right. It's always kind of fun to revisit the films I used to watch on TV after getting home from school in junior high, and seeing all those model vehicles & buildings is always fun. (For example, the little sticks obviously holding the model trucks up & moving them along a slot in the ""road"" while their wheels remain stationary...)  This is NOT high-class entertainment but if you're in the mood for some goofy eye candy it fills the bill.

Oh, and Godzilla really needed a better choreographer... LOL",1457568000,,584,4.5

To be honest I've seen this film over fifty times as I am a big fan of Toho and all fifties sixties horror genre. I love the cigar smoking alien and how the robot android falls in love with Nick even against her hard wired programming!  William Shatner has seduced many androids as well... I only wrote this review because Amazon keeps bugging me to. I watched this on my laptop as I prepared mashed potatoes and yams for Thanksgiving dinner on the Wednesday prior.

325009,4,6301175220,"This is a great example of one of the better entries in the Godzilla franchise.  It features American actor Nick Adams, and if you watch with the English dubbing, you will hear Adams' voice, and on the Japanese track he is dubbed.  But as an astronaut for the Japan space program, between Adams and his partner there are enough thumbs up given for a lifetime.  One of the fun this about this movie that was released around the 63-65 time period is that during one of the fight scenes, Godzilla does the Ali shuffle!  There is a fun interactive trivia game in the extras!",1438214400,,570,4.451923076923077

These are movies you either love or hate.
I've always had a soft spot for them so this was a good one. From the pro wrestler style fighting to the vinyl uniforms of the aliens from Planet X, this is classic monster/sci-fi camp.

I like this one better than Ghidorah; The three headed Monster and this movie seems to set up the next ones in the series with MechaGodzilla. Godzilla is not the terrifying monster in this film as much as an anti-hero. He begins his ""lovable"" phase here and becomes more appealing to kids.

The sci - fi in it is fun to watch, it is very colorful and the models look pretty good and the special effects while dated add to its charm. For me, this one ranks right up there with Godzilla vs The Thing. I grew up watching this stuff on late Saturday night Chiller Theater in Pittsburgh in the 60's so this stuff takes me back to being a little kid again.

I watched it with him and I was rolling over the floor with how corny it is -- for instance when Godzilla jumps up with the victory celebration after his win.  However, there is something fun and nostalgic about looking back at what was the parent's type of sci-fi with no computer animation and CGI.  Just a guy in a suit and miniatures of trucks and towns.  Yeah it's a bit campy compared to the dark and broody almost ominous Godzilla movie starting 5/16/14 yet I had a good time watching with my buddy.  We are going to make it our routine to watch one of these old ""B"" horror classics whenever he is over.

I don't think I've had such a good laugh with a movie in quite a while. I won't go into the plot, that's covered by other reviewers, but the content of the movie is light and mindless. It's typical acting for a Japanese monster movie but the actor's actions and dialog is almost priceless, and with Nick Adams as one of the stars I think they tried to incorporate some 'Westernized' - as opposed to strictly Japanese 'Eastern' - styles into this and it makes it truly a gem.

There is quite a lot of exchanges of the 'thumbs up' sign between them, not truly a Japanese gesture, and the villains from Planet X are dressed as what I imagine they thought Gangsters would be. But the dialog is what really made me laugh, there's a lot of it what sounds as if belonged in a 1950's Cowboy & Indian movie or a 1940's gangster film.

At one point Nick is sitting at a table with a Japanese general while the Commander from Planet X is explaining how they will help the Earth, and Nick leans to the general and tells him he thinks the Commander is ""...speaking with a forked tongue."" Then there is the leader of the Japanese gangster gang, who are in cahoots with the Commander, who's is made trying to sound almost like Jimmy Cagney calling someone who was trying to ruin his plans a ""Dirty Rat"". There are a few more references to somebody being a ""rat"" also. Ya' gotta love it!!

And the alien dialog is just as much fun. Towards the end when their plans are going awry and they are losing you get something like this:

""Commander, things are bad.""
""Yes, what is it""
""We've lost control the monsters""

When they are about to go down in flames - quite literally, their flying saucer is wobbling and smoking - the commander then starts talking about ...""going into the future with me"" (committing suicide - oh, how WWII Japanese)

Now to the film itself. It sarts off when astronouts travel to a planet behind Jupiter called ""Planet X"". They met aliens who want to borow Godzilla and Rodan to fight KIng Gidorah (the aliens call him Monster Zero). So the astronouts agree and the alines take away the kaiju (monsters in the Japanese language). I won't spoil the story, but the movie doesn't have enough monster action for me.

325414,5,6301175220,"Firstly, in this movie, Godzilla and Rodan are shown attacking humans a lot towards the end. They don't do anything 'heroic' except fighting with King Ghidorah, but, King Ghidorah is a planet-killing space dragon, so when Godzilla and Rodan fight him, I think its more because they want to stay alive than because of any 'heroic' motives, and, as anyone who's seen a movie from this series (meaning, not the Heisei or Millenium series) will know, if either of them fought King Ghidorah alone they would probably be killed off very quickly.

This is a movie where King Ghidorah is shown as he should be (well, he was debuted in the last movie for the purpose of being the main villain of the series). From movies like this, its clear that King Ghidorah is a considerably considerably greater threat than the later G-villains, such as Mechagodzilla for example.

Although, there is some corny stuff here, keep in mind that  in Japan, G-movies are designed so that a very general audience(in Japan, obviously) can relate to them. Because that means there will always be some kids in the audience they throw corny stuff into G-movies at various points throughout the movies.

Rodan is my favorite kaiju, and I would recommend the movie to most people who are fans of Rodan.

Finally, I've heard random sources saying that about 45 minutes of this movie were editing out and similar things. This is not true because the American version of this movie is 92 minutes long and the Japanese version is 94 minutes long.",1152403200,5,1509,4.766283524904215

325416,4,6301175220,"No need to go into the plot.  Just about every reviewer here has given their take on the fun mess.

The movie is obviously directed toward children.  Little kids are more prone to being awed by make-believe monsters and are thrilled by the notion of space flight - and they're more forgiving when the whole of the story does not make sense.  All they know (or perhaps care about) is that it's ""Good Guys vs. Bad Guys"" and the Good Guys always win.  Sprinkle a little G-rated butt-kicking by people in rubber suits in the mix, and the tots will love it.

Still, in terms of motion-picture quality, there are plenty of ""Good Guy/Bad Guy"" children's movies out there that are very well done.  I can only surmise that this film's ""Dr. Who-like quality of being filmed in some teenager's basement"" is the result of having next to no budget to put this movie together.

The usual cast of Japanese contract players have roles, supposedly because they were still under contract when the film was shot!  The addition of US actor Nick Adams makes the contract players seem extraordinarily talented.  (Adams was also in a movie called ""Die, Monster, Die"" with Boris Karloff.  He was just as wooden and god-awful in that film, too.  I read on here that Adams was nominated for an Oscar.  All I can say is, if Nicky seemed good enough to get a nod from his peers, then there must have been one heck of a director on that film, with a heavy hand in the editing booth).

Nevertheless, I have to admit that I bought the DVD of this film knowing what I would be getting.  It's a cheese-fest, a piece of garbage with no artistic merit; yet, I enjoy watching it.  I can't help but feel a bit nostalgic, watching the film and thinking back to a day when life seemed so much simpler and less stressful.  The film is fun to watch for that reason alone.

If this movie hasn't hit ""cult-classic"" status yet, I'd be surprised.  It's right up there with ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes.""",1128384000,,1960,4.470422535211267
325417,5,6301175220,"Campy? Well the dubbed versions usually are, but the original Japanese versions are a bit more serious--a detail worth paying attention to. The dubbing was done in the US by people who clearly didn't understand or respect this kind of Japanese film.

These remastered version are extraordinary. The art direction--even on these later movies when Toho didn't have as much money to spend--is superb. Lots of imagination and real magic--visually this is much more interesting than much of what was being produced elsewhere in the world at this time and I wish we'd start giving Toho, and the Japanese film industry, some credit for this. These are great and highly entertaining films!

Check out the Tokyo Shock releases: ""Mysterians"" (one of my all time favorites), ""Dogora"" and more. Also clean and wide-screened. Top notch stuff.",1123977600,3,829,5.133333333333334
325418,4,6301175220,"This film is one of my childhood favs. It is one of the few Godzilla films that I actually do not fast forward through the ridiculous human drama. TOHO has rehashed the story of this one many times the latest being ""Godzilla: Final Wars"".

Tetsui is a great nerd-like character who saves the world. I also like the two astronauts and the aliens with their mod space outfits and quirky hand signs.

Some have mentioned that they are disappointed that Ghidrah is always referred to as Monster Zero. Actually, if you listen closely, the astronauts call it by its actual Japanese kaiju name of King Ghidorah, something that was never done in the English dubs of the older Godzilla films.

The best thing about this film is Nick Adams as the American astronaut, Glen. His presence adds a nice feeling of universal cooperation (as it did in his other turn for Japan kaiju ""Frankenstein Conquers The World"") and he even looks good in that white and yellow outfit that looks like an Egghead suit from the TV show Batman. His dialogue is great. When the aliens reveal their evil plan to dominate Earth, he hisses ""Those double crossing finks!"" When the aliens exterminate his robot girlfriend, he yells ""You rats! You stinkin' rats, what did you do to her!""

Priceless!  He must have had a ball filming this picture.

The special effects are TOP notch in this. Yeah, they use a lot of footage from previous films, and its three guys in rubber suits, but they make up for it with the transport of Godzilla & Rodan to planet X, the showing of the sound waves and how to counter-act them, and the disintegration of the female robot is a great effect.

The famous Godzilla superiority dance after the defeat of King Ghidorah is VERY silly. You either love it or hate it. Personally, I think it looks a little too much like a winning Popeye moment, but as a child, I remember loving that moment. This was the point when the Godzilla movies were changing direction to appeal more to kids.

As an installment in the famous kaiju franchise, this is one of the more memorable films which has a good story line that is not bogged down by a whining child star. It's a keeper! It ranks up their with ""Ghidrah, The Three Headed Monster"" and is a great double feature with that movie and/or ""Destroy All Monsters"", the most ambitious of the earlier Godzilla films.

Akira Ifikube's musical score is a bit repetitious but there are some nice themes, including the films opening theme, which doubles as the alien theme for this film.",1123891200,2,2508,4.605381165919282

325432,4,6301175220,"VIDEO QUALITY:
Once again a two sided disc from Simitar. Side 1 contains the full screen TV version of ""Godzilla vs. Monster Zero"" and Side 2 contains the original 2.35:1 widescreen version. Sadly, Side 2 is not anamorphically enhanced. Side 1's image is as you would expect - rubbish. You loose over half the image, the print has bad colouration and print damage. It will still hold some nostalgia for those that grew up with is though. Side 2 looks reasonably good, with vivid colours and a generally sharp image. At times there can be quite a lot of grain on screen though, and during some of the effects sequences it looks like someone dropped the print, stepped on it a could of times, attempted to rub it clean with a dirty sweatshirt and rammed it back in the machine... I'll stop drinking so much coffee... As with all Simitar discs, there was also quite a lot of artifacting, most notably on Side 2 unfortunately. There was also the occasional rainbow effect, though it was very rare on this disc, and you wouldn't find it unless you were looking for it.
AUDIO QUALITY:
Side 1 comes packed with the original mono track, which sounds like it was kept in very good condition. There wasn't any trace of crackling, hissing, fuzzing or any other kind of wear. The only problem I could really notice was a little distortion when the sound became slightly loud, but then I doubt this mono track was exactly designed for home cinema systems with such huge subwoofers. Side 2 contains both the original mono track and an all new 5.1 track designed by Simitar. The mono track on this side is on par with Side 1, if not slightly better. The 5.1 track is pretty much the same as the mono, in fact I hardly noticed anything different about it at all. Some of the sound effects during the battles had a little more bass, and there were some new sound effects during the military battles that really sounded odd and didn't blend well with the film, though that's really the extent of this track's differences.
EXTRA FEATURES:
Again, it carries the same basic features as all Simitar discs: There are several Godzilla screen savers included for DVD-ROM users, which are only compatible with Windows 95 machines. There are also some custom trailers Simitar designed for their Godzilla releases, which are made in a cheesy 1950's American monster movie style. There is a video art gallery, and for DVD-ROM users a printable art gallery, which is fairly interesting, as well as a short trivia game to rest your knowledge on the film.
OVERALL:
This is probably one of the better Simitar releases. Simitar claim to have remastered this from the original source (presumably they mean the American source), which doesn't give you much comfort that we'll ever see anything better than this. Despite that, you're getting the film in widescreen with a reasonably good image and some very nice audio - add to that some quirky trivia games and some orchestrated image galleries you've got a reasonably good disc.",1083456000,11,2993,4.724665391969407

Once there, the astronauts meet the people of Planet X who are forced to live beneath the surface because of Monster Zero, which is the name they give the three-headed golden dragon, King Ghidrah.  They want permission to use Godzilla and Rodan to get rid of Ghidrah, as it was their combined might that expelled Ghidrah from Earth (q.v. Ghidrah-The Three Headed Monster (1965)).  In return, the technologically superior X people promise a miracle drug that would cure all diseases.  The men of Planet X surely qualify for some fashion victim award, with their gray suit, black vest, helmets with single protruding antenna, and thin wraparound glasses.  They're quite cold fish at that, seemingly scientific and rational and putting their trust in electronics and computers.
Meanwhile, Tetsui, a nerdy inventor whose glasses make him look like a Japanese Buddy Holly, has perfected the Ladyguard Alarm, a shrill handheld alarm system that can be heard for up to one block.  As someone who hasn't had much luck, he's quite surprised when the World Education Corporation buys it from him, offering him $100,000.  This is just the ammo he needs to impress Fuji, whose sister Harumi is his girl.  Fuji is less than impressed with Tetsui, and doesn't feel Tetsui is the kind to provide for his sister.
Glenn and Fuji though feel they are putting too much trust in Planet X and the Controller.  Glenn tells his friend that he saw the Controller here on Earth (later a truth) and mentioning something about a plan.  Both astronauts fears are confirmed when it turns out the X people have not very benevolent intentions.
OK, I know this is the cinematic equivalent of comic book nonsense, so the American-dubbed dialogue is excusable.  The colonial Commander's voice was dubbed by someone who's clearly a Humphrey Bogart fan.  However, Monster Zero is one of the worst in the series.  Much of my beef has to be goofs and continuity errors that even King Ghidrah could fly through.  For one thing, if I was up to something nefarious, I'd have cut the quiet sinister laughter of the Controller early in the film.  And these aliens, despite their efficiency and scheduled mindset, apparently lack the foresight to search their prisoners.  And what was the point of the apparent importance of water on Planet X?  It's introduced but just as soon deemphasized.
In one scene, Glenn tells his girlfriend, a Planet X plant, that life isn't something to be governed by logic and electronics, but feelings.  She slips him a note in his pocket seconds before she is executed, but as it's in response to what he said, she had to have broadcast her thoughts and turned them into ink on the note.
And as for the monsters, they only come out in the obligatory fighting and smashing up Tokyo scenes.  Godzilla's silly dance after winning the first fight against Ghidrah is totally embarrassing.  The whole drama is centered around the human principals and the people of Planet X and their shenanigans.
Nick Adams, who came out in two Doris Day comedies Teacher's Pet and Pillow Talk, plays Glenn.  This is one of his last few films before he died of an overdose from pills he was taking for a nervous disorder.  And I recognize a very young Akira Takarada as Fuji.  He plays the hotel executive victimized by the yakuza in Minbo-Anti-Extortion Woman.
If Mothra had counselled Godzilla and Rodan the same way he did in Ghidrah-The Three Headed Monster, he would've warned them against coming out of this nonsense.  At least the later Destroy All Monsters and early 70's movies (e.g. Gigan, Mechagodzilla) were more interesting.",1076544000,,3799,4.890795631825273

They control Godzilla and Rodan's tiny minds, and almost succeed in their nefarious plot, if not for the kooky invention of one goofy, and quite annoying, scientist. With his machine, the aliens lose control of Godzilla & Rodan, who turn on Ghidra for a rubber-suited battle-royal!

325437,4,6301175220,"In this movie, Godzilla and Rodan are literally ""kidnapped"" by aliens from a planet which lies behind Jupiter and hence apparently stayed undetected - called Planet X.  Monster ""0"" is the number given to King Ghidorah (or Ghidrah) by the species which inhabit this planet who are constantly being attacked by it.  Godzilla and Rodan are also given numbers as Monster ""001"" and ""002"".
The aliens need to ""change worlds"" (as many an alien seems to want to do in science-fiction movies) and, naturally, what better place than Earth, huh?  They are chronically short of water on Planet X and need a fresh new start.  They want to conquer Earth with the help of Godzilla, Rodan and Ghidrah which they control perfectly through their advanced technology transmissions of complex ""monster language"" signals via transmitters.  They trick humans into helping them get Godzilla an Rodan to drive out Ghidrah (Monster Zero) from Planet X and offer them the formula for a ""cure-all"" miracle drug which can cure all disease.
I found the ideas in the plot quite entertaining.  However, I have always had a problem with how Godzilla seems to refrain from using mainly his atomic breath against Ghidorah and instead opts to using ""wrestling tactics"" which is quite ridiculous and frankly stupid - unfitting of the tradition of Godzilla movies.
I mean, the fact is, if you have seen Godzilla 2000 and how Godzilla literally blasts out of the alien there with the sheer Armageddon-like power of his atomic breath, and knowing Ghidorah's powerful ""lightning bolts"", Godzilla should not even be able to get close to Ghidorah if the lightning bolts are fired at him constantly...so how does he manage to literally twist Ghidrah and wrestle him etc...??!!  This tactic is also used in other Ghidorah movies; perhaps the special effects required were too expensive - I mean to have both monsters firing at each other.  Also, Rodan also has an electrical charge which he can thrust about but we don't see this until much later movies in the 1990's.
When the humans manage to destroy the alien's transmitters, Godzilla and Rodan, (who are very happy allies indeed!) re-unite to drive out King Ghidorah back into space and away from Earth.  The aliens are also handed a well-deserved defeat (which I won't reveal).
The sound quality of my video was rather poor and required that I turn it up but other than that, it was acceptable quality.
I recommend this films for Godzilla enthusiast for it gives a new setting for Godzilla movies which usually take place on Earth and the aliens are a rather interesting idea too.",1062374400,2,2591,4.897260273972603
325438,3,6301175220,"In the sequel to ""Ghidrah, The Three-Headed Monster"", a couple of aliens from Planet X (led by the alien version of George Bush) need to borrow Earth monsters, Godzilla and Rodan to battle Ghidrah (now retitled ""Monster Zero""). As it turns out, it was all a ploy to use these monsters to attack the Earth. But the humans have discovered a weakness and plan to use it to get Godzilla back on our side.
This was actually the first Godzilla movie aside from ""Godzilla 1985"" that I saw as a kid. Despite that fact, it was never really one of my favorites. It seems like nearly forever until the aliens finally decide to begin the attack and after all that, the pay-off is average. For a kid with a short attention span who just wants some pointless monster destruction, this one waits too long. Most of the Godzilla battles, aside from the opening fight on a really fake-looking distant planet are taken from the last movie and the title is somewhat misleading. After all, most of the movie has Godzilla on the same side as Monster Zero and on the two occasions that they do fight, Rodan is also thrown in the mix.

It shows, from the excellent outer space effect and battle sequences; to the smart, taut plot; to the convincing star turns by Akira Takahara and Nick Adams. This film succeeds on several levels; as a buddy flick, drama, fantasy battle,  and science fiction film. This is an unusually sumptous Godzilla film, rich with context, effects and imagery.

325471,3,6301175220,"Planet X lurks behind Jupiter and spawns wily aliens who want to conquer the Earth by mind-controlling Godzilla, Rodan, and King Ghidorah.  This low budget movie is either a sci-fi thriller targeted at kiddies under seven, or a campy venture in chuckle-headed humor for older viewers.  Suit yourself.  As usual with Japanese sci-fi flicks, it is a mixed blessing.  It has immortal dialogue.  Note the above quote from Nick Adams in the role of Astronaut Glenn.  The movie has some real excitement when the alien controlled monsters wreak havoc on the Earth.  Buildings crumble, bombs explode, and rocket launchers and massed tanks fire.  Some scenes from the original ""Rodan"" flick were spliced in showing the devastation caused by the typhoon-like wind from Rodan's tremendous wing span.  Godzilla is his usual city destroying self.  King Ghidorah manages to look scary and awkward all at once.  Irony and paradox abounds.  From the complaint department, it takes this movie forever to get to the ""monsters on the rampage"" part.  The script wastes excessive time on the evil aliens and their dastardly schemes.  Toy space ships fill the skies.  Plastic rocket ships blast off for outer space.  Things get laugh-out-loud funny when Ghidorah spits lightning bolts and makes Godzilla tap dance.  Nick Adams stands around with his hands on his hips, looking grim and determined.

325472,5,6301175220,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla movies of all time. Monster Zero (better known as King Ghidorah) is to my eyes the most impressive foe Godzilla ever fought. Maybe it's just me, but the special effects of Ghidorah are stellar, much better than those of Godzilla himself. The plot features about everything I want in a good old-fashioned monster movie: weird aliens, a foe with an evil laugh, wanton destruction, and some funny poses and gestures from Godzilla. Of course, the whole story about a planet being discovered just on the other side of Jupiter is sort of silly, but who really cares? This is Godzilla we are talking about. One thing I could not figure out was why the aliens went to the trouble of transporting Godzilla and Rodan to their planet, only to bring them right back to Earth; it seems like they could have taken control of the monsters right here, especially since they had already set up a secret base in Japan.
There are a few drawbacks to the film. A regular red-headed American is featured prominently in the story (as opposed to being pasted in after the fact a la Raymond Burr), and he does a very good job of showing why Americans just do not belong in Godzilla movies. He really got on my nerves, to tell the truth... All in all, this movie is great fun for all.

Nick was a great actor, and proves it here, where he manages to inspire even when trying desperately not to kill Fuji's nerdy would-be brother-in-law in the alien prison. As for Godzilla, why is everybody so down on his moves after he defeats ""King Ghidrah"" (as Nick inexplicably calls him)? So far as I was concerned, that was nearly the highlight of the movie. The most implausible thing about it is the spectacle of the Earth's ""Council of Physicians"" approving the plan to rid the world of all known diseases. You KNOW the AMA would never let that happen.

I really started warming up to this film when I began to appreciate it more from a comical standpoint.
