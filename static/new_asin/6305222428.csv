997003,4,6305222428,"I ordered this DVD for my gifted and talented students in middle school.  Since we are studying the Maya, this video was totally appropriate for their viewing.  The content was presented in a manner that interested them with a young student working with an older teacher type person/archaeologist.  I would highly recommend it for grades 6 and on up.",1266883200,10,350,4.898305084745763
997004,5,6305222428,"Although it does not touch upon the dissappearance of the Mayan civilization, the Mystery of the Maya is a review of the great pyramids and the rediscovery of these ancient civilations.  We see the development of archeology from the hand drawings from the early 19th century, to the incredible photography of the late 19th and early 20th century.  We meet the people who had a lot of interest in their day for Mayan culture and how much of that information would be shared.  We see the grave of one of the kings, whom we find in ""Breaking the Maya Code"" to be one of the longest living monarchs in all of history.

Some of you will recognize the stone covering his tomb.  Some who claim ancient astronauts were here use this stone saying the character depicted is flying a space ship.  Thankfully that is not alluded to, however, the actual discover of the tomb and how they lifted the makes you wonder, how did it get there in the first place.

Simple in some of its presentation, The Mystery of the Maya is a very good short subject movie that is informative and useful along with anything about the demise of the civilization.",1265241600,7,1129,4.532019704433497
997005,5,6305222428,"This is one of those quirky imax pieces which i really enjoyed, but i can't put my finger on why.  I know that it wasn't a masterpiece of information...and i'm sure lots of folks would pick it apart for other reasons too.  But i'll be completely honest and admit that i thouroughly enjoyed it purely because it made me feel good to watch it.  I'd call it rather transporting -- and it had a feeling -- a mood which i enjoyed.  And it was beautiful to look at.  I'd buy it in a snap if it was still available and i wish so badly it would be made into a blu-ray.  I think with a little updating, and possibly add some stuff to make it longer and more current, it could be a wonderful addition to the Imax Blu-ray discs that are available.  There are just not enough of them -- and this is surely worthy of the visual magnificence that blu-ray provides.  I find myself sometimes wondering why some movies are even made into blu-ray (the Simpson's movie???  i love the Simpsons, but it is a crudely drawn cartoon -- hardly something which would blossom into visual a masterpiece in the blu-ray format like this would).  Anyway -- to whomever is concerned... Why not consider revamping this and re-releasing it on the format it should be in?  It is born to be blu-ray! :-)  Please???",1239667200,,1278,4.36864406779661

997008,1,6305222428,"I rented this DVD because I wanted to expand my knowledge, and refresh my memory, on the Mayan civilization since I had an AP World History exam coming soon. The film was a huge disappointment. I expected a documentary with hard facts about the Mayans, but the film gave me more information about the archeologists who studied the Mayan ruins, and their expeditions, rather than the Mayan civilization itself! I think I was better off going to the local library for a better video. Next time, I think I should just stick to documentaries made by The History Channel, Science Channel, National Geographic, etc. as they are more reputable for their documentaries. If you really want to learn about the Mayan civilization and its peoples, this film is not for you.",1108684800,4,761,4.816793893129771
997009,3,6305222428,"I rented ""Mystery of the Maya"" after returning from a visit to Tulum and Chichn Itz. This DVD provided a few interesting tidbits and some good shots of the ruins. But for the most part it's typical IMAX fluff: a brief (40 min.) documentary on a subject that deserves much more, with in-depth history sacrificed for a few random facts and sweeping cinematography (the latter of which doesn't translate to the small screen). The major faults of this production are that it doesn't identify the ruins as it shows them, nor does it give much substantial information. For instance, ""Mystery of the Maya"" didn't even discuss the theories as to why the Mayans suddenly abandoned these spectacular sites.

In the end, this DVD is good if you've been to some of these sites, but don't watch it before a trip expecting to get some great insider information for your visit.",1104364800,7,862,4.746666666666667
997010,2,6305222428,"I have watched many of the IMAX films that have been released on DVD. This one stands out as one of the most disappointing ones I have seen. I actually fell asleep watching it - and I wasn't particularly tired.  The film starts out with a great flyover of the coastline with a Mayan temple. After that it quickly loses that special IMAX expectation of panoramic shots and ""grandness.""

I found the storyline quite tiring and merely a distraction to what was being taught.  While educational, if the focus on close ups and limited camera visual scope is what the authors wanted to get across then standard video footage would have been enough. The dilution of the IMAX expectation knocked off at least 2 stars.",1094083200,7,709,4.656
997011,4,6305222428,"This documentary is below the image IMAX standard, don't buy it if what you want is to see spectacular landscapes shots, but if what you want is a good introductory documentary about the Maya, pick up this one, you are not going to be disappointed. In a glimpse you can get a good quantity of information about this amazing people.",988070400,9,331,4.533333333333333
7886048,3,6305222428,"Provides an overview of the Maya, and by that I mean some of the images are taken from a fly over. Interesting images as it explains that the structures were assembled without metal tools or the wheel, wow!  Other than that this features a teacher explaining to a student about the Maya. What is said is that the buildings were abandoned hundreds of years ago, does not say why, perhaps unknown. Missionaries burned the written scrolls the people had and they were understandably upset.

Explains that an explorer did some drawings of the structures in the 1800's and does an actor reenactment of an explorer who discovered what appears to be a secret passage. Not much information. Some insightful images.",1468281600,,706,4.875

7886050,1,6305222428,"The title is misleading. This is one story about Lady Six Sky and how she contributed to the fall of the Maya.  I was expecting a general documentary, but this is filled with re-enactments and simply follows one historian's views.",1385942400,,230,4.75
7886051,5,6305222428,"This DVD was converted from an IMAX film from Canada. It focuses mainly on the Maya calendar and the discovery of a  hidden tomb of Pacal, a king of Palenque  in the Mexican state of Chiapas. We also see the Mayan city of Chichen Itza in the Mexican state of Yucatan which has an observatory. Mayan cities are also found in Guatemala (Tikal and Quirigua) and Copan in Honduras. The film makes it clear that the Maya was an advanced civilization with a complex  base 20 number system and an advanced writing system.
I was fortunate to see all of these cities as well as Toltec (Teotihuacan) and Aztec cities near Mexico City as well as Monte Alban and Mitla in the Mexican state of Oaxaca.
If you would like to see the Mayan cities, I recommend that you go in the winter because the area is very hot in the summer. Tours are available with inexpensive lodging near the Mayan cities.",1384473600,2,881,4.425925925925926

7886053,3,6305222428,"Having read a lot of literature about the Maya I was looking forward to watching this video. But what a let down!
A story is vaguely built up around the historical persona of Lady Six Sky, who was sent from Dos Pilas to Naranjo to establish a new dynasty there. She is portrayed as a power-hungry warrior queen, who unleashes a wave of destruction on the Maya world, which in effect causes its downfall.
All this is based on research by Nikolai Grube, who is one of the foremost mayanists of our time. But this docudrama does not serve him very well. The story of Lady Six Sky is interwoven with a history of Maya research and the deciphering of the Maya script, in which Dr. Grube has a major part. There are interesting scenes of his expedition to Naachtun in which he tries to establish the ancient emblem glyph of the site. All of this is good and well if the producers had only left it at that.
There is a lengthy expounding on the old story that the Maya were once believed to be peaceful star gazers, something we all have now known to be long out of date.  What I mostly object to, however, is the extremely poor costuming of the production. The classical Maya are shown running about in white or black shifts. White shifts are associated only with the Lacandon, who until recent times still dressed themselves thus. The classic Maya wore extremely sophisticated clothes. They were expert weavers and their outfits were very colorful as can be seen on the numerous sculptures,  wall paintings and painted vases in existence. Lady Six Sky is shown in procession in a long white shift with a red cape with a  flowing train, something only uninformed western imagination could have produced. This scene is repeated ad nauseam as are staged brutal battle scenes with dead bodies, chopped heads, etc. The same stockades are brought down again and again. The same village scenes with children in white shifts are shown over and over.
 Claims about Lady Six Sky's ambitions and supposed fateful impact on Maya history are interwoven into this production in such a way that they appear to have no factual support, seemingly incoherent speculations that have been grabbed out of the air. We are told that Dr. Grube's has developed a new and alternative view of the Maya collapse, but we end up wishing that this story had been told in a better way.",1314748800,2,2347,4.621103117505995
7886054,4,6305222428,"Nikolai Grube provides a decent video on the downfall of the Maya. A few Cheesy dance/acting scenes that at times seemed to be just time filler but overall educational and interesting. Dos Pilas, Nachtuun, Tikal, Naranjo, etc...",1307664000,,228,5.1891891891891895
7886055,5,6305222428,"This wonderful documentary visits multiple sacred sites for pyramids, temples and palaces built by Mayan people.  They are credited and respected to advance in technology, engineering, mathematics and calendars long before Columbus.

The Spanish religious fanatics failed to understand and appreciate Mayan culture and civilization and declared the Mayan wisdom as the  work of devil.  They burnt books and killed all priests who were masters and keepers of Mayan knowledge.

Nowadays, researchers take great pain in decoding and interpreting the writings and pictures.  Why Europeans out of dark ages, did not want to learn from these far advanced ""native Americans""?

Mayan civilization splendor makes us proud of being American!",1306972800,3,731,5.651376146788991
7886056,1,6305222428,"I got fooled by the marketing tagline: ""as presented in IMAX theaters"". It sounded like a high class audio and video production. It is actually super cheap: cinematography is un-inspired and technically sub-par. Audio: the monotone commentary is barely audible, sound effects are very generic.
The content itself is very superficial. The back of box summary is more than a summary: it actually gives you the integrity of what you will learn watching the programm.",1290902400,2,463,5.1866666666666665
