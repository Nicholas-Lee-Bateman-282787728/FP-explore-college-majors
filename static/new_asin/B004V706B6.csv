This DW Special Edition is truely one of the top quality SE's I've seen, Packaging quality and included OST being the highlights. And ditto again, no english here, not even subtitles or navigation menus.",1410220800,,211,5.0285714285714285
8442992,5,B004V706B6,"This set contains only two episodes: Crow and Hummingbird, but comes with some sweet bonuses! It contains two discs: one for the two episodes and the other for 1 of 6 soundtracks. Not only that, but it comes with two postcards. If you are a true Deadman Wonderland fan, get this, it is amazing. Just know that it is only in Japanese.",1373155200,,333,4.387096774193548
