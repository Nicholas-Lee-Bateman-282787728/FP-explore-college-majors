8522416,1,B007W5ATJ8,I've been a big fan of the Crusty Demons of Dirt series since the beginning back in the mid-90s. This volume is just a documentary of their Australia efforts. It's a really weak effort and not recommeded. A waste of money in my opinion.,1354665600,,236,4.386363636363637
8522417,5,B007W5ATJ8,"What a wild ride from Australia and their Gold Coast. World record dirt bike stunts set to incredibly good rock music from various artists, a good time to watch and listen to. Watched it tonight at world premiere Newport Beach Film Festival (4-2012). Producers were in the audience. Cool people.",1335484800,,295,4.92
