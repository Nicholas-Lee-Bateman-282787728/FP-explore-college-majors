7953762,5,B00005TNWS,"This tape is very well done. Janis keeps a relatively fast pace all throughout the exercises, while explaining everything very clearly. She keeps the momentum at all times! The music is great too. The exercises are really challenging, you can feel every muscle working and she intensely works the whole lower body and the abs as well. Highly recommended!",1082592000,,354,5.016949152542373
