8302576,5,B000JJSDEW,"On a whim, I ordered Toronto Cybercide while picking materials to help me plan a course entitled: The Sociology of Literature and Film: Science Fiction, Space Fantasy, and the Cyberpunk Universe to be launched in July 2008.  With eager anticipation I popped the film into my dvd player and was simply awestruck!  The ideas in the film were good, the acting not so good, the special effects were just special, and the story was fine.  Here was low budget filmmaking at its best.  It reminded me of a film in which I had a minor starring role, Liquid Soul, directed and written by Ray Young, in which I played a mad scientist who was devoured by his pet cat.  Anyway, Toronto Cybercide is down right inspirational!  I'm going to show it to my students on the first day of class.  After we discuss the film, I'll reveal to them the class project.  We will make together a short film to be premiered on the last day of class.  We'll invite the local media (The Greenville Record-Argus) and have a gala event.

I liked the film.  I'd love to see a big budget film by the filmmakers of Toronto Cybercide.  One glaring weakness of the film was sound.  Sometimes the actors' voices were muffled and the diction was a bit quick.  I know that James Cagney didn't slow down his diction, but he had better sound recording.

Anyway, congrats to the filmmakers and actors of Toronto Cybercide!  I like your work.  Keep at it.  Cheers!",1205280000,,1420,4.5236220472440944

Having heard a few things about this during it's pre-production stage I had high hopes for the latest Key Pixel picture, and I must say I was not disappointed in the least.

UCF: Toronto Cybercide takes what we know about our world today and then skips forward in time to one-up our expectations of the future.  The film is yet another example of how this group of artists, writers, hobbyists, and friends can churn out quality projects again and again.  Keep an eye on this gathering of filmmakers - it may not be long until they make their way to a silver screen near you!",1161993600,,700,4.4453125
8302578,5,B000JJSDEW,"I have not seen this film, as it was just released on Amazon for the public. However, I can tell you that I will be ordering it immediately. The crew at Key-Pixel has created a number of shorts I have enjoyed, first and foremost being their collaboration spy-spoof, I Spy. Seperately, there have been shorts (I vs. Me), fanfilms (Planet with No Name, Darth Moby) and more interesting work put together which I've found enjoyable. These guys aren't going anywhere anytime soon, and I hope that this film helps launch them into the spotlight they deserve.

The trailers and spots I was shown for UCF, while containing visuals which look to be filmed with consumer cameras, are shot in such a way where it didn't matter to me, as it didn't matter with any of their other films. The content was enticing enough that I, being a fellow filmmaker, had to know what happened that I watched it, on a rare occasion, where I didn't think about how they were making it and simply enjoyed all which was presented to me.

I'm sure this will be great, and I can't wait to see these guys working on a large-scale production.
