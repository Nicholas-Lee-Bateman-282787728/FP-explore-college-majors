2576255,5,B000FML8TK,Sympathetic interpretation of Casanova's life with a wonderful cast and script.  Be aware of the censor's rating because of the subject matter but it is actually quite tastefully shot and I highly recommend it for the appropriate audience.,1384041600,,239,5.2894736842105265

2576335,4,B000FML8TK,"Great costumes, set, direction. Acting pretty good too. Well done. Like to see a series. The lead actor is a little weak, and it seems the actors voices are dubbed because they chose how they looked rather than how well they acted!",1446422400,,231,4.523809523809524

2576345,3,B000FML8TK,The series has potential but the pace is incredibly slow.  Lust for power seems to be main focus here but we know that it will all end horribly in the French Revolution.,1446249600,,169,4.28125
2576346,4,B000FML8TK,a good start with episode 1. it may mature as we go on. High production values if a bit gory here and there. A different Don Juan than Mozart described.,1446163200,,152,4.1

2576359,5,B000FML8TK,"Regarding all the feminazi reviews I have read, a historical drama's quality should not be judged on whether the women were ""empowered"" or ""strong women"". Yes, it is true that the Casanova character in the pilot episode may have been slightly chauvanistic (because he loved the chase). But guess what, so was the real historical Casanova (if judged by modern standards). Read any of the translations of his memoirs. Ironically though, in some ways Casanova's relationship to women was very unchauvanistic, as most sources indicate that he really fell in love and respected each of his many ""conquests"". Anyways, I feel Amazon did an outstanding job on this pilot and I would love to see more.",1445904000,,692,4.974137931034483

2576361,5,B000FML8TK,"1st episode captured my attention til the ending credit. The lead actor is great as Casanova as hurdles through his obsession to pleasing women like a Dracula of Love and the deal made with his savior in France. Also, this series looks to show that Giacomo Casanova not just as an flamboyant playboy but a gentlemen with feeling when one of his projects goes awkward.

2576373,5,B000FML8TK,"Stunning visually and the plot had me hooked right from the beginning. I found one slight flaw. One of the characters speaks of a character suffering ""depression."" That term was not in use in Casanova's time. They called depression, ""melancholia"".",1445472000,,247,5.2
2576374,5,B000FML8TK,Very interesting. I'd like to see more.,1445472000,,39,4.714285714285714
2576375,5,B000FML8TK,"While some settings and situations are most definitely adult, the artistic values demonstrated in this production cannot be praised highly enough. Costumes, sets, cinematography - there was obviously some very serious scholarship that went into this. I've been to Venice, and seen the cell from which Casanova escaped.

2576381,5,B000FML8TK,"I was very surprised by how much I enjoyed the pilot for this new series. Normally I'm not interested in movies about Casanova, because the plot usually just revolves around some decadent playboy trying to seduce the pure young virgin. This was not like that at all. In this series Casanova is a man who just escaped from a nightmarish prison sentence and is trying to find new meaning to his life. He heads to Paris and becomes embroidered in a web of intrigue and lies, all the while genuinely trying to make something better of his life. We get to see more facets of his character, from the ridicule he has to endure from his humble birth to his grief of being exiled from his beloved Venice.

I was particularly pleased to see how realistically they portrayed Alchemy in the series. People tend to think of Alchemy of as something Medieval, practiced in the smokey dungeons of old castles, but it was a vibrant pseudoscience that was believed in and practiced up to the twentieth century.

Madame de Pompadour was by far the best part of the show I've seen so far. Too often they only show her later in life, at the height of her power, so it's refreshing to see a young Pompadour struggling to hold her own in a court that wants nothing more than to destroy her for the unforgivable crime of being born middle class. Bojana Novakovic does an amazing job of portraying an iron-willed woman who cuts right through Casanova's charm and lies, proving that sex may have gotten Pompadour her position as King Louis's confidant and adviser, but brains are what enabled her to keep it all her life. This was not a woman who would throw away all she'd achieved just for a wink and a roguish smile.

All in all, I loved this series and I really hope Amazon decides to continue it because I can't wait to see what happens next!",1445385600,,1821,4.478915662650603

I would like the lead Luna to have more depth and be less like some pervy dude who doesn't seem that charming.  Casanova should rely more on his character, not empty compliments to win people over (men and women alike). Madame Pompadour -- I want to see more of her, she was intriguing and interesting.  I want to know her story. And I really don't want Casanova to seduce Manon the virgin -- that would really just make him more one dimensional-- that is unless we saw him unravel in the aftermath (like Carrie in Homeland please).

Casanova came off lacking dimension so please build him up with a man with many layers and depth -- like could his great love of women (i.e. booty) relate to the fact he himself just wants love?  Try to add some depth please!  Costume, setting, production value and on-location shots paid off -- I kept looking at the background and what everyone was wearing-- keep day dreaming of visiting Europe soon-- keep that up!

Instead of a hero who protects the meek from ruthless power, the main character also uses the weak to acquire goals with only remorse as a virtue.
Instead of a sugarcoat Hallmark series as the title may suggest, the pilot takes a moment to portray in detail one of the most gruesome recorded executions in history, which I found while rereading history that Casanova actually did witness and make comment.
Instead of fluff this pilot episode has enough meat to be a worthy series. Only its title could imply would-be-viewers to expect weakness in plot instead of the strength it shows in presenting manipulation and it's effects both upon character and history.",1444694400,,799,4.925925925925926

Same with set pieces like the infamous Heaven and Hell club which is presented as a mediocre whorehouse where topless women flirt with men dressed in the silk and lace power suits of the era.

But more than that, the performances are well-wrought and the characters (most based on actual people) interesting and I wanted to get to know them. Contrary to what other reviewers said and what I was expecting, there isn't an overabundance of sex (there is an overabundance of cleavage), and the story focused much more on Casanovas intrigues and machinations rather than his sexual exploits. However, the last five minutes where mostly horrific and utterly unnecessary. First, there was the public torture and execution of a convicted criminal, and then the brutal rape of a minor character. The points that the rape and torture/execution were making were valid and material to the plot, but they could just as well have been made with the action happening off-camera and the reactions to them seen on-camera. Because of this, Im downgrading my rating to 5 stars to 2 stars.

2576487,5,B000FML8TK,"this show is showing another side to the story, which is interesting and worthy of one more episode to be further judged and maybe have a decisive fan base. If you don't what to like or not like on this show, I have a tip for you, would it not be boring if it was a shallow piece and a poor excuse to make a ""porno"" except it won't be right? because you only get to see titis :{ so sad! ( I want a show that moves past sex) Look the setting is good, cast too, although the main character is no Brad Pitt he has that ""je ne sais quoi"" plus don't you love a man with an accent? say what you need to say, the story is there and a potential to become something too, plus it was only the first episode, everyone knows most series knock it out of the park or build up by the second time around.

all I ask you, if you have not decided, you won't waste your time. Give it a try.

ps: sorry if there is any spelling mistakes, I'm a ESL ( English second language)... Also if you don't get that this story is about him getting revenge, while always bieng wanted by a woman, someone on his little universe did not fall for his charms. how they will make the story develop is the same reason why people want more, just saying.",1443744000,,1214,3.971311475409836

I loved the actors, the style of the series, and the writing! Oh and the costumes are amazing as well as the cinema photography on locations in Paris and other new locations coming our way, i hope???...its the real thing...not just graphics pasted into a set. I also love where the show might be going with one of the most powerful women of this period. I won't spoil it for you, but the actress and actors are spot on for the parts, particularly the powerful women. peace and have some fun with the show! i hope it gets a good run!",1443657600,2,659,4.15625

optioning ""The Young and Prodigious T. S. Spivet""!). One little thing to the writer, De Sade was born 15 years after Casanova so...

Then, add in the violence (seeing a prison drawn and quartered) and the sexual assault against the young woman at the end of the story and I all I thought was I can't turn this off fast enough.

They were not helpful and in fact you could tell that couldn't follow the story of were so morally hung up they shouldn't have started watching it on the first place.

The show was good up to that point - good sets and costumes and typical Victorian-era politics and intrigue well-portrayed - but the end RUINED it. I can't trust this show now not to suddenly destroy the pleasant experience with unnecessary graphic violence. Amazon could be more ethical in this case.

2576654,5,B000FML8TK,"Be forewarned, if you're hoping for romance, love, and daring do from a dashing hero, go watch Lasse Hallstrm's lovely film, as this show will leave those looking for sexy, pretty people and pleasant feelings disappointed. If, however, crime drama is your thing, this Casanova might just tickle your fancy. I suspect it may be a bit of a slow burn for some, but I enjoy rambling stories so I can't complain, and as a long term student of the Enlightenment with a passion for baroque music, I found this pilot full to the brim with material to amply satisfy me. (It has a Remeau aria, several Scarlatti jingles, and my favorite Merula piece, all very nicely performed, so I can't really complain...) I was pleasantly surprised by the show, as it takes a different tack from the usual treatment of Casanova, with the famous sexual escapades playing second fiddle to a milieu of intrigues, grifts, and other unsavory undertakings, all played out against the often bizarre backdrop of a Europe caught in the heady throws of ""Enlightenment"". Strange characters, wild superstitions, giddily high hopes, and complex paranoias abound, making for all manor of juicy escapades, and the story takes quite good advantage of the colourful possibilities. Giacomo Casanova was more than just a notorious playboy, and boasted a resume that included spy, polyglot, novelist, and swindler (among several other things), all facts that have been largely glossed over in past treatments, so its fun to see it explored to such entertaining effect. Diego Luna gives an intriguingly quiet performance as a deeply conflicted, almost tortured Casanova, adding a slightly edgy, dark overtone to the drama enfolding amidst the Parisian upper crust's navel gazing decadence. The supporting cast is quite strong; Bojana Novakovic gives us a brittle and insecure Madame Pompadour conflicted enough to rival Casanova, while Miranda Richardson delivers a deliciously crazed turn as the batty, gullible Madame d'Umfre, and Paul Rhys' Comte Saint Germain is a stroke of casting genius laden with glittering possibilities. The historical accuracy, if a bit patchy and romanticized, is decent, and the production does a fine job of conveying how foreign and brutal the eighteenth century would appear to modern sensibilities. The costumes and sets are quite good, and the story takes us into some of the less known nooks and crannies of society, with the brothel scene being a particular high point, both for accuracy and execution. Granted, everyone's teeth are too strait and white, their faces are conspicuously free of the moon crater like smallpox scares so common at the time, and the execution of the bumbling assassin is absurdly short and benign. (The actual spectacle lasted for four hours, due to both the complexity of the sentence and several unforeseen complications (morbid readers can google Robert-Franois Damiens for details), morphing into an ordeal that makes the guillotine's Reign of Terror a quarter century later look weirdly humane.)  However, despite these minor shortcomings I thoroughly enjoyed the show, and with Jeunet at the helm it has great potential; I hope to see a full season. Kudos and thanks to Amazon for producing such interesting content. Keep up the good work...",1442188800,,3268,5.177693761814745

2576678,1,B000FML8TK,"The problem begins with casting--the actor playing Casanova is not believable as Casanova. There's plenty of actors that ooze sexuality and sensuality, I'm not sure why they went with this guy.
Second problem, and my main problem--amazon seems to be falling prey to the same issue that HBO and Showtime have had for years with any show that is billed as even remotely ""sexy;"" for some inane reason producers seem to interpret ""sexy"" as a completely one-sided thing just for straight men. We see countless breasts, COUNTLESS, fully naked women, yet we never, ever, see a penis (even in orgy scenes with men present). At most we see the side of a man's ass. I am SO tired of any and every edgy cable show throwing in boob shots for no reason . Boobs everywhere all the time. It taints the whole show as more misogynistic crap. I really hope Amazon doesn't go that route with their programming.
Problem 3--gratuitous displays of violence that don't add to the story line whatsoever. In this show it was the dismemberment and vivisection of an unsuccessful assassin. Do we really need to see all that detail to get the point? NO. And of course, they threw in the rape of a virgin for good measure.

The twist this story has been given of a pensive Casanova who embarks on a circumspect look at his activities in the past, how he engages women, appreciates them, and attempts to come to their aid, mostly without his legendary debauchery, makes me interested to see more.  Just to say, Amazon has given very few clues about this first episode, and, golly, we have to watch it before we can discover who even acts in it.  That this is about Casanova says much about what one might expect, but still, it would have been fair of Amazon to mention the nudity as a courtesy to those who who find it offensive and difficult to watch or to warn that this is suitable only for certain audiences.",1441929600,,908,4.386904761904762

While the jury's very much out on Casanova's chances to truly change his ways by the episode's end, the show itself definitely succeeds. In less than an hour, the pilot sets up a dense but coherent web of nested intrigues for its fugitive hero, weaving in other real-life figures such as Mme Du Pompadour and the Comte St. Germain, and dropping hints of espionage and alchemy into the mix. (To say nothing of a memorably risqu shadow-puppet show.) Anchoring it all is Diego Luna's performance -- which initially seems subdued, but gradually reveals smarter subtleties -- as a basically decent rascal who's movingly trying to be better than he was, despite a world of temptations all around him. Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet shows unusual restraint here, forgoing most of his striking, artful visual flair and nearly all of his love of quirky performances. However, just when you've written off the show as a pleasant trifle, writer Stu Zicherman pulls the rug out from under both you and his protagonist, revealing that what you thought was a kind of Paradise is actually Hell itself. The show's final minutes, for all their colorful sunniness and splendor, pack a wallop of real, unnerving horror that's all too rare in TV. On the strength of the ending alone, I'd very much like to see more of this show.",1441843200,2,1625,4.977941176470588

There is a lot of potential here with court intrigue, everyday 18th century Parisian life, the occult and of course, the story of post-prison Casanova.  Diego Luna is compelling and perhaps the most interesting character is that of Madame du Pompadour.  If the show goes forward, I suggest less lame gratuitous sex scenes and more political drama.  Obviously, a show about Casanova should have an element of sexuality but it would be much more interesting to make these scenes feel integral to the story (like Outlander).

2576820,5,B000FML8TK,Costumes and settings are superb. Graphic torture and hot sex scenes makes it  very interesting and intriguing . I have only watched one episode.

2576829,1,B000FML8TK,"I love costume dramas but this was dreck. The dialogue is clunky at best, and delivered by a star who appears to have attended the Kristin Stewart school of acting. He delivered a line to Madame Pompadour that sounded and looked like an expression of sincere regret and her response was ""Are you flirting with me?"" Apparently he was, too. Ridiculous! Add some gratuitous shots of a man being drawn and quartered and I'm just not sure who this show was designed for, but it's definitely not me. Amazon, don't waste your money by putting any more into this disaster.",1441324800,2,564,4.65

Great historical detail, smart modern outlook, combined with unexpected twists and turns, make this a luscious confection that could well become the next big hit.  Keep the quality of the script high, the fabulous production detail intact, along with the terrific actors you've introduced, and this will become a long running series with a HUGE fan base.

2576843,5,B000FML8TK,"I was pleasantly surprised by this show, which was more reminiscent of quality ""period"" drama, like the Tudors, than like lesser-written dramas (The White Queen, The Bougais). I thought that the attention to period detail was stunning. I also appreciated that the show was not just a series of sexual escapades from history's most notorious philanderer, but includes his other interests and perhaps even a bit of self-disgust (however, those looking for trysts will not be disappointed).

It will require some stronger supporting characters/actors to develop this potential series into the type of show Amazon is reaching for. The visuals are quit stunning, as mid 18th century Venice and Paris have the potential to be characters in their own right, and plenty of thought and detail went into costume/wardrobe choices.

2576966,4,B000FML8TK,"Casanova is an unexpected and surprising take on a well known take.  Instead of focusing on the traditional parts of Casanovas life, the story begins after his infamy and subsequent imprisonment.  I was particularly impressed by the caliber of the secondary characters acting, and the set's attention to detail.  She's design is beautiful and historically accurate. The acting of the lead character was a little rough in the beginning, but as the show moved on, both the actor and the show hit its stride.  If particular note are the historical details of the time.  I enjoyed the scene where an older, widowed woman sinks her time and fortune into the peudosciend and search for meaning in life and the hereafter.  Overall, it was a promising and engaging beginning to what looks like an entertaining show.  I hope the series is given the green light by Amazon.

2576970,2,B000FML8TK,"The storyline didn't grab me & the protagonist didn't convince me to continue watching the series.  This show will probably get some better ratings than I am given, but that's because I wasn't as taken in by the babes & boobs that abound the show.

Casanova, and many people he encounters are extremely intelligent and supremely self-centered, and they use their gifts to seduce, enchant, undermine, belittle, betray, and conquer (especially to conquer) everyone around them.

Diego is not even a southern Italian, or even a Sicilian - he is half-Mexican. I just hate when casting directors think...""Hm, Italians....they're all sorta dark, right? Let's put a Mexican in the role...no one will notice!""

There are about 100 million Italians in the world...couldn't they get ONE that suited the role?",1440720000,,478,4.901234567901234

2577066,4,B000FML8TK,"I really hope to see a full series.  I admit to being skeptical since most on-screen depictions of Casanova have been a bit over the top, but I really enjoyed watching Diego Luna in this role.  It's interesting how the pilot begins to show an inner struggle with the main character, between his incurable desire to seduce women regardless of the consequences, but still trying to maintain some sense of right vs. wrong and morality.  I suppose it will be up to the viewer to decide whether or not Casanova is a sympathetic figure.  Miranda Richardson also plays an interesting character, so I would love to see how that develops.",1440720000,,629,4.6909090909090905

This was probably the worst example of this where they have him escaping to Paris and becomes more apart of palace intrigue, but closer to a pimp than anything.

2577185,1,B000FML8TK,Not very interesting beginning - gratuitous sex substituting for plot and dialog.  Could not continue to watch.,1440633600,,111,5.529411764705882

I'm a huge fan of Jean-Pierre Jeunet and this was the first thing I looked for on Amazon Prime. Major disappointment. No excuse.",1501027200,,277,4.673469387755102

8124673,5,B000FML8TK,OMG I want this turned into a Series. It's like Game of Thrones in Paris (which is actually doing a disservice to the show but will help people figure out if it's for them.) The potential of where this could go is Amazing. Gives HBO and Netflix a run for their money.,1482192000,2,267,4.153846153846154
