4396317,5,B004K9WWAI,"I am a big fan of this 80's TV show.  The only down side to season 4 is the packaging,  Instead of the dvd 'clicking' into its own compartment, the discs are in individual sleeves which are loose inside the package. Just appears that they went a little cheaper with production than in previous seasons.",1363564800,,302,4.472727272727273
4396318,4,B004K9WWAI,"This is a fine season for this series, which actually improved and evolved over time (unlike many others). The interplay between the two leads also evolves, making this crime drama much more fun--and, Stepfanie Kramer just kept getting more beautiful each year (a wonder of nature!) All in all, very worthwhile for its type.",1348358400,3,324,5.018518518518518
4396319,5,B004K9WWAI,I luv the dvd however my mistake for not reading all the dvds that are offered here on amazon. I just realized that there is one dvd that is ALL SEASONS and i got individually seasons1-4. Im sad about that action I did:(,1332720000,,220,4.1395348837209305
4396320,4,B004K9WWAI,"I'm a big fan of this show but was very disapointed with the picture, seasons 1,2 and 3 were great, don't know what happened with this one, the picture looks plain, like they didn't remaster it for some reason,alot of the scenes at night look really bad,real fuzzy especially when they wear black you can see it right away,alot of the episodes are great, just wish the picture was as good as the previous seasons.",1331596800,4,413,4.52
4396321,5,B004K9WWAI,I'm so glad they put Hunter on DVD.  I can't stop looking at this show.  This is a must see DVD.,1331164800,,96,3.5238095238095237
4396322,4,B004K9WWAI,"It's about time they brought this 1987-88 Season out on DVD, especially since this was one of the best seasons of this this police drama that ran on NBC for 7 years.

This is also the season when Charles Hallahan becomes a fulltime and permanent co-star on this show as Hunter & McCall's no non-sense superior officer(Capt. Charlie Devane)and the last season with Hunter and McCall's street-savvy fellow officer Lt. Ambrose Finn(John Shearin)which dies off in the ""Silver Bullet"" episode which was also the season finale episode to Hunter's 4th Season.

This was the last season when Sgt. Rick Hunter(Fred Dryer)and Sgt. Dede McCall(Stepfanie Kramer)were so-called tough-as-nails homicide detectives working for the fictitious Metropolitan Police Department in Los Angeles since Hunter & McCall were all of the sudden street-wise and mostly by-the-book police investigators working for the LAPD Parker Center division in Downtown L.A. in the last 3 seasons.

This 1987-1988 Season also takes me all the way back to memory lane to when NBC's motto was ""Come On Home To NBC"" since that was NBC's motto from the Fall of 1987 thru the Summer of 1988 when I was 15 years old and a Freshman in high school during this season.

It was also interesting seeing guest stars like
*Erik Estrada in the ""City Of Passion"" episode after his co-starring days as the often short-tempered hot dog California Highway Patrol Officer Frank Poncherello on CHiPs

*Wendy Malick in the ""Boomerang"" episode before her co-starring days on the HBO comedy DREAM ON

*Robert Reed in the ""City Of Passion"" episode after his co-starring days as the sentimental Mike Brady on THE BRADY BUNCH

*Randy Brooks in the ""Naked Justice"" episode before his co-starring days as Nathan Hastings on THE YOUNG & THE RESTLESS

*Robert Colbert in the episodes ""City Of Passion"" and ""The Fourth Man"" after his co-starring days on YOUNG & THE RESTLESS

*Jon Cypher in the ""Turning Point"" episode before his co-starring days on MAJOR DAD and after his co-starring days as Chief Fletcher Daniels on the police drama HILL STREET BLUES

The only thing that sucks about this HUNTER-Season 4 DVD is Mill Creek didn't provide any Closed Captioning on this DVD like Anchor Bay did for HUNTER Seasons 1, 2, and 3.",1328659200,7,2256,4.976063829787234

8432673,5,B004K9WWAI,"I enjoy Hunter - the action, the interaction of the stars, the story lines, the locations. It all works for me! The only caveat is season four ends with a cliff-hanger and season 5 has not been released on DVD. Please release Hunter: the Complete Fifth Season. So, watch the final episode with caution.",1382054400,,302,4.611111111111111
