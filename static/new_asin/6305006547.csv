947795,5,6305006547,"Although this movie does deal with Anti-Semitism, it apparently is not dark enough for some of its viewers.  Perhaps they were looking for another ""Schindler's List.""  This movie focuses on a teenage girl and the impact her grandmother's Holocaust stories have on her.  Although the grandmother's flashbacks of Nazi Germany are tragic, no violent imagery is shown.  This is a very admirable trait in a movie--the ability to illustrate a horrible event without graphic violence!
There are many lovely aspects of this film.  Daisy (Claire Danes) is an only child.  Her parents are so in love with each other that they often unintentionally ignore their daughter.  Fortunately, Daisy finds all the love she needs in the arms of her eccentric grandmother, played by Jeanne Moreau.  Daisy's grandmother lives in a beautiful countryside.  North Rhine Westphalia (Germany) provides the wonderful scenery for most of this picture, even though the story is supposedly set in New York. Daisy and her grandmother share wonderful weekends of card playing, reading classics, picking flowers, eating pancakes, and other cozy passtimes!  From a carousel tucked away in a big city to an old bookstore in the middle of the forest, many scenes in this film have a fairytale-like quality. This movie is very charming but at the same time successfully deals with issues of love and prejudice.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes ""girlie"" movies.
Unfortuntely, this movie didn't sit too well with my boyfriend.  Perhaps I shouldn't have gawked at Jude Law (the hunk from ""The Talented Mr. Ripley""), who by the way is in this movie too!  As usual, Claire Danes gives a stunning performance.  This movie has five-star quality!  Buy it today!",982022400,10,1726,5.092526690391459
947796,5,6305006547,"If you like Claire Danes, you'll like this movie.  She gives a very moving performance as Daisy, an adolescent who is ignored by her parents and enjoys spending time with her cool grandmother.  Julia Stiles, Jude Law,  and James Van Der Beek also appear.  I enjoyed this film because it deals  with something we all go through directly or indirectly in our  lives--judging people because of what they are, not who they are. Claire's  performance, as always, is magnetic and real.",958867200,8,479,4.839506172839506
947797,3,6305006547,"I admit....the only reason I rented this movie at first was to see Jude Law. I must say it was a movie worth watching if you are interested in romance or drama movies or if you are interested in one of the leading cast  members (i.e. Jude Law, James Van Der Beek, or Clare Danes).  I must admit  this movie's plot was a weak one. The Holocaust was really out of place in  this plot. I found that it would have been better as a ""coming of  age"" story for the main character Daisy. I can relate to her struggles  and her triumphs (I've been through and still going through the whole nine  yards....except I never dated the man of my dreams). I think this movie  could have been better written, but nevertheless it is a decent movie.",949017600,,730,4.239130434782608
947798,4,6305006547,"The movie captures the experiences of the aftermath with the horrors left from  HOLOCAUST relived by ALL the survivors.  I strongly recommend this movie as a stepping stone to further debates on prejudice and racism .  An  interesting discussion and collection piece for teachers and other role  models.  I plan to  purchase this movie (when the rate lowers) to show my  children, nieces/nephews, and grand-children.  Please review this  movie with a teenager.  (The rating was given a four due to the fact there  was little storyline with the parental issues.  It would have been  interesting to know how Daisy's mother/father reacted/felt about issues.)",927072000,,655,5.233009708737864
947799,1,6305006547,"How can you compare life in Auschwitz concentration camps to life in high  school?  What ever gave the writer and the director the idea that this is  conceivable?  Worst of all, for a movie that tries to compare the two  experiences, it sure doesn't take the first one very seriously.  The  characters don't even say the word ""Holocaust"".  Now if the movie  took place during the Second World War or just a little while afterwards,  then maybe the prejudice and the absence of the word ""Holocaust""  would seem conceivable.  But no, it takes place in the nineties with  eighties-ish music and rather eighties-ish themes in terms of the high  school parallel.  Pretty inconceivable considering these PC-times.  Claire  Dane's character, an even more delicate incarnation of Angela in My-So-  Called Life, is at first sympathetic, but then she starts to gnaw at you  with her wholesomeness and pariah-like presence until you want to hit her  upside the head with one of her books.  Jeanne Moreau's character seems to  be more from the 60's than the Holocaust; she's one of those free-spirited  grannies who likes romp in her garden in white nighties.  But least  convincng of all is Jude Law, who, compared to his performance in Gattaca,  languishes; if he had traded his part with James Van Der Boek's  tormentor-character part , then it wouldn't have felt like a miscast.  Van  Der Boek has the boyishness Law lacks to be a WASP-ish popular, cuddly guy;  Law has the darkness that Van Der Boek lacks to be the tormentor and  all-around ignorant twit.  All in all, a fine mess that could have been  better if: a) the writer and director took the Holocaust more seriously  b)the writer and director just took out the Holocaust parallel altogether  and wrote a teenage romance.  END",907459200,5,1778,4.829431438127091
7880523,3,6305006547,Very abrupt ending. Really look like they shouldve been more to it than it was. Too much with the grandmother. Not enough time with the guy that she sort of liked and rejected her in the end. And left me saying thats all.,1525478400,,221,4.162790697674419

7880530,5,6305006547,"""I Love You, I Love You Not"" is a very good movie! Jeanne Moreau gives a beautiful performance as the grand mother of a teenage girl who is very intense and a little troubled about her Jewish family history. The cinematography is beautiful! I really enjoyed this movie, and since I am a student at the University of Texas at Dallas, and one of my courses is Holocaust, this worked in well with my studies.",1395619200,,405,4.413333333333333
7880531,3,6305006547,"This film had very little point to it. Claire Danes, Jude Law and Jeanne Moreau were all excellent in their roles, but there did not seem to be a plot. Danes plays the granddaughter of a Holocaust survivor (Moreau). She is very sensitive, poetic, and dramatic. She has a lot of dreams/nightmares about the concentration camps. Jude Law's character gets involved with her, but he cannot be trusted. He seems to like to spend time with her, but he is being pulled between her sensitivity and her being ""different"" from everyone else and his popular friends. Age old story (see Pretty in Pink, for example, although that story is more socioeconomic). When Danes confides in Law about her grandmother's past, she starts receiving anti-Semitic notes in her locker. However, these events are unresolved and pointless. Her relationship with Law is never really ""resolved"". They just do not see each other anymore. He does not talk to her anymore. She just longs to go back to her grandmother's house because she seems to hate her inattentive parents. But her grandmother, luckily, provides her with a safety she finds nowhere else.",1004832000,,1124,4.9523809523809526
7880532,4,6305006547,"Jude Law, Claire Daines, Jeanne Moreau did a fine job with their characters.  Can Jude Law do a bad job?  whether he's cold, indifferent, or being sweet -- he remains interesting.  Even as a non-hero dream boy with shallow interests.  In my favorite movies there is always a scene that makes watching the movie worth it.  In this movie it is the Early Morning date scene at the restaurant.  The acting in this scene was authentic and low key --the connection provided by Claire and Jude to the characters made the emotions seemed unforced and genuine.  I wonder about the script on this one, however, it seemed confused somewhere along the line regarding what it was really about.  There needed to be editing or clarification or focus.",1001548800,,735,4.732283464566929
