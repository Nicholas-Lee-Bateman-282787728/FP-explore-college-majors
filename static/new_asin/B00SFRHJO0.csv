6980206,1,B00SFRHJO0,"Lucy Castillo (Adriana Solis) can't seem to be a medical internship in Orange County. She needs cash to help her brother because he apparently has borrowed from the wrong guys or something. She takes on a high paying three week job as a housekeeper for a realtor who communicates to her by notes. There are also flashbacks to a fire and some bad whistling of ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" which is explained about an hour into the film.

The film is done differently and by differently I don't mean better or entertaining. The only person who appears in the film is Lucy. The plot points are given to us via an answering machine, notes, and in a rare moment, a person speaking. It grew rather boring as Lucy performed inane tasks day in and day out. The situation with her brother, I guess escalated, but did so through the answering machine so it was ""they need the money sooner...""

The film centers on Lucy apparently descending through despair and who really cares about despair.

Guide: No sex or nudity. Some PG-13 language.",1429315200,,1030,4.648351648351649

6980208,1,B00SFRHJO0,"WOW, this movie was terrible, I am SO SURPRISED it is part of the After Dark films.  They should be ashamed to have this as one of their films.
There is only 1 actor you seen in the ENTIRE movie, and she never speaks ! not even once !! You hear voices in it, voice mails,  her reading messages that were left to her, ( in the other peoples voice ) but not once do we here the main and only actor speak. Weird..... and Awkward......

This film is very,very,very slow, it drags on and on and on, and even at the end it FLOPS. Don't believe me ? rent it you will see lol.  I honestly feel cheated renting this garbage.  PURE GARBAGE",1428364800,3,629,4.040322580645161

6980210,4,B00SFRHJO0,"* I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

I absolutely love Lionsgates After Dark Original films.  Ive seen a slew of them, going back several years to the After Dark Horrorfest series.  Although Ive seen many of them, I can only recall two (out of the dozens Ive watched) that I didn't care for.  HOUSEKEEPING is an After Dark title that certainly does not fit into that category.  And while its not a perfect film, its very good, and I highly recommend giving it a shot.

Director Jennifer Harrington should be commended for what she accomplishes with this film.  Theres essentially only one character that we ever see, and she never talks.  The dialogue we do get is from voicemails, and they are skillfully used to tell the story.  I am very impressed with the originality of this concept, and I applaud Harrington for taking such a bold step.

HOUSEKEEPING is shot well for the most part, however theres one complaint I have about the picture quality:  the color correction.  The film practically has none.  The result is a dull picture with bland color that does nothing to help the story.  This isn't really a deal-breaker for me, but I feel it worth noting because it makes the film look cheap.

The acting is very good, with Adriana Solis portraying the main character, Lucy.  Solis gives a mesmerizing performance, conveying a wide range of emotions with simply her body language.  Despite the lack of dialogue, Solis convinces the audience to feel everything she feels, and in turn, offers viewers a deep immersion into the story.

There are practically no special effects in the film, but they aren't needed.  What wins the gold here is the story.  I will not give anything away, but lets just say a persons past can catch up with them when they least expect it.

But although I enjoyed HOUSEKEEPING, and I am recommending it, the film does have a couple of flaws.  I mentioned the color correction above, but I also have to mention the annoying voicemail beeps that precede each message.  There are waaaaaay too many of them, and they blast loudly each time.  I found myself having to adjust the level of my surround-sound each time they sprang up.  Normally, this wouldnt be such a nuisance, but the fact there are so many make it so.

Overall, however, HOUSEKEEPING is a great film, and I definitely suggest you give it a look.  The film released earlier this week in a variety of formats.",1427932800,6,2436,4.644028103044496

8698233,1,B00SFRHJO0,"After Dark Films and ""Housekeeping"" is a nothing movie, a film so incompetent in terms of acting, cinematography and even grasping the fundamentals of telling such a routine story as the one this one tries to tell. These are terrible mistakes made all the more horrendous by the inexplicable truth that the whole agonizingly dragged out 89 minutes that make up this soul-sucking, abysmal void of  a 'film' is just one woman who wordlessly rushes from one task to the next while reading letters, an off-screen narrarator who provides one of the few escapes from the main characters routine we are offered, from the homeowners whose house she keeps on cleaning even when all signs tell her too leave. There is no reason for such a distracting and lazy plot device as the aforementioned reasons to be utilized but to keep this obviously micro-budget, inexcusably poorly shot (many of the shots are like trying to decipher images by looking directly into a fog)disaster as cheap to create as possible.

  Such quibbles could be ignored if this whole movie had some drive, ambition, direction or if even some attempt at all was made to build suspense or offer us a few surprises. Barely any effort is even made to propel the story forward beyond 'a woman slowly begins to unravel in the home she cleans for a living as she reads increasingly hostile letters by the employer she never sees'. It sounds like a gross understatement to state this movie has so little plot, even less substance, but its the truth.

  I admire films, especially Horror features, which leave a lot to the imagination. This works when a film gives you enough of whatever menace is hiding in its cinematic shadows that your mind works overtime long after the end credits roll to put the on-screen enigma to rest and figure out all that you have seen. But, when the highest tech effect you see is handwriting in the left-hand sign of the screen from the movie's off-screen menace and some whistling from an unseen source taunting the main character the movie is far too subtle.

The solo actress, Adriana Solis,is given no more to do than look horrified,  slowly walk down corridors at a pace that would make a zombie seem lead-footed to pad the equivalent of a 5 minute short story they have here to feature length and wipe up random messes while contemplating her past. It's hard to say if her performance is as bad as it seems because the material it gives her is so minimal. This inability to tell if the only character observed through the whole film has even done a good job with her performance is just further proof that the filmmakers have sacrificed everything that makes a movie worthwhile to create a film as cheaply as humanly possible and to make matters worse this is the type of film which is perfectly content to take your money, waste your time and simply sit unapologetically on the screen and do nothing. It doesn't even attempt to throw in some rushed, last minute, half-hearted thrills in its last few minutes like far too many of these lazy, let's make a quick buck, shot in someone's basement films of the past.

  We've seen everything this so called 'terror-fest' has to offer so many times we can predict the pattern it takes,  the bare bones road of events it will take before the opening credits finish and After Dark Films, known for mostly mediocre films which look like timeless masterpieces compared to this incompetent trash, is scraping the bottom of the barrel with ""Housekeeping"". I can only surmise the company knew someone attached to this and they owed them a favor so huge their semi-respectable name is now dirt. It is the only way I can figure out that this film didn't stay in someone's basement, where it belongs, and not only saw the light of day but got picked up by such a well-known namesake.

  Such is a mystery worth pondering. At least it is one that is far more intriguing, illusive and entertaining to contemplate than anything to be found in this anger inducing snore-fest.",1429747200,2,3997,4.688571428571429
