Go beyond learning songs to learning how to make music.  I have four of Tony's DVDs and they are among the very best of my whole and huge library of guitar training media.  Do yourself a favor and follow along with Tony and learn there CAGED system and start making music on your own,",1448409600,,435,4.142857142857143
8711822,2,B00W1SICIQ,Not so awesome. It has outdated songs. May be of interest to some older folks but I did not quite like the lessons. There was no guidebook; you had to print the songs from pdf file. Reproduction of an old video in DVD format.,1444867200,,225,4.136363636363637
8711823,5,B00W1SICIQ,This is an outstanding video. My way of rating guitar tutorial videos is to count how often the tablature is required to understand something. The more I need it the more I feel I should have just bought a book. In this case the tab was just an added bonus. Everything was explained clearly. Showed numerous ways to approach each song which helped not only with my playing but with how I think when trying to learn other songs on my own. It is listed for an intermediate player but the content is workable for a beginner thanks to the different approaches presented for each song. Also because of how clearly things were explained. My son is a beginner and I am intermediate when it comes to fingerpicking. We were both better players after watching the video and working on the content.,1438300800,2,787,4.549295774647887
