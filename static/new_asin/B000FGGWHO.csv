8122269,5,B000FGGWHO,This woman is a prophet. She should run for President of the United States or Emporor of The World. She has opened upy eyes. I feel so connected to her. She has validated my relationship with my cat.,1515888000,,199,4.2631578947368425
8122270,4,B000FGGWHO,"This is a pretty good cat massage video, though I didn't learn much.  Honestly, if you are really close and in tune with your cat, your cat will teach you all these techniques emself.  I knew pretty much all the moves in the video just from lots of experience, trial and error, and paying close attention to what my cat enjoys.  That said, I honestly still enjoyed the video.  It was just really sweet is all - it was heartwarming to watch the instructor interact with her cat.  At the end of the video, she even sings a sweet little song to her cat that she made up for him.  Awww...",1386806400,,584,4.216216216216216
8122271,3,B000FGGWHO,My sister and I get each other a worst christmas gift instead of serious ones and we make a contest out of it. While I'm sure this is helpful to some I am using it as a prank. Sorry to those who are fans.,1274140800,,204,3.659090909090909
8122272,3,B000FGGWHO,"This lady is a graduate of some Swedish Massage School in NYC and therefore a Licensed Massage Therapist.  She did not indicate any special education regarding animal therapy.  She was on David Letterman tonight (12/09/09).  She explained the Cat Massage DVD in just a few main steps.  I am shocked that Amazon shows that the DVD is not available because Dave plugged it several times as if it is a current DVD.

1. Never speak in a high screechy voice to a cat.  They like soft, low singing (or sing-song)voices best while you do the massage.
2. Avoid using the fingertips to pet or massage a cat.  Use the mostly the palm of your hand.  Note that cats massage each other with their heads.
3. Use either hand or both as you stroke the back or sides of a cat in long firm strokes.
4. Within a few weeks your skittish or nervous cat will be calm,loving and more sociable.

I guess the moral of the story is ... be calm and loving around your cat and it will be more calm and loving with you.  What goes around comes around?

Save your money - why buy the DVD.  Maybe U-Tube or CBS has the segment from Dave's show that you can view FOR FREE.  Happy Cat Massaging !!!",1260403200,5,1165,4.264840182648402
8122273,5,B000FGGWHO,"This is an excellent how-to video on how to massage your cat.  What I really like about this video is that the instructor demonstrates the various massage techniques on her own cat so that you can see the proper technique. She also demonstrates how your cat might respond to the various massage techniques.  This is helpful because some of the massage techniques may stimulate your cat to stand up if they really like what you're doing.  If you didn't realize that this was the desired response you might think that your cat didn't like the massage.

My cats all love the massage techniques.  My little kitty who usually never purrs, gets so relaxed during her massages that she purrs and drools all through her massage sessions.

I am so impressed with the techniques outlined in this video that I have given this video as a gift to friends.  They love it as well.",1178409600,6,865,4.61437908496732
