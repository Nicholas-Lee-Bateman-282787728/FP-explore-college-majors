4373744,1,B004GSVX94,"I was astonished to see three two-star reviews.  How much worse would anything have to be for those reviewers to give only a single star, I wonder?  There is NOTHING IN THIS ""MOVIE.""  Nothing at all.  It is the project of some middle-school class with a video camera.  I say this in all earnestness: How does anyone feel justified in selling this?  There is literally nothing on free TV right now as bad as this DVD is.  Think of the worst thing you can imagine watching on broadcast television--the most inept, boring, crassest show you can think of.  River of Darkness is nowhere NEAR as good as that show.",1303689600,8,608,4.513761467889908
4373745,2,B004GSVX94,"Check out the box art.  Pretty cool right?  Looks like an action movie with some wrestlers and guns.  Nope.  What you'll see is some dv camera filmed low budget serious mystery/horror movie with un-hammy bad acting.  You'd think Angle is the problem; nope, he's fine compared to the other bit characters.  The moral of the story is that just because you have a script and a camera doesn't mean you should put it on film without thinking about it first.  If this was shot with 35mm and the actors hammed it up in the 80's horror/comedy style, it would work and be enjoyable; in digital with ""serious"" acting, it does not.",1302652800,2,620,4.531531531531532

After his investigation points to three brothers that are dead things start to get weird.  For starters the main stars of the movie are three wrestlers : Kurt Angle, Kevin Nash and Psycho Sid Vicious.  When these are you main stars you really can't expect alot from the movie.  The plot, acting and apparent budget reminded me of a ""Scy Fy"" channel original movie...only worse.  The acting is really, really bad.  The movie itself could have been worse I guess, but the acting was so bad it's distracting.  Overall this was better then I expected, but the acting was SO BAD it's hard to overlook.  Movie is a C-, acting is F.  When taking both into account, I say D+.

What it reminded.me most of was that old Dan Curtis series DARK SHADOWS. As a storyline on that series it would have fit right in...acting included. And I enjoyed it in much the same way I did those back in the day.

Definitely a pre-Barnabas story I hasten to add. More like the ghost and Phoenix stories.

Quite enjoyable, this.

4373767,3,B004GSVX94,"Update: This movie actually gets better the more I watch it. I can't explain that at all. But, again, with better writing (not Oscar worthy writing, just better) this could have been a really decent 3 Star movie. I recommend that Kurt does Pilates and Yoga. He is stiff in the movie. It would definitely help him get more comfortable with acting. But, seriously, for .99 cents, it is worth it. It is a seven day rental, for those who don't have Prime or are overseas (like me).

Okay, so, I am overseas (London)  and I wanted to watch a movie. I have Amazon Prime. But, as some of you probably already know, you can't watch certain movies and television shows abroad (especially if they are FREE!) You have to pay for the film you want to see. Yup, I can't watch it because of some licensing issue (if it is free on Prime), but, I can pay for the movie and those licensing issues disappear!!! What Aa rip-off, Jeff Bezos (or whatever your name is!!!) Once my prime membership is up, I will kick Amazon to the curb!  So, with that being said, I would not say that I didn't like it. But, I wish there was something like 2 1/4 stars. Something that says, ""It didn't stink as bad as I thought it would."" It could have been written better. Seriously, a fifth grader could have written something better. All in all, it cost 99 cents and I can be easily amused for seven days. The cover art is too funny! I wish Kurt was in full tactical gear and chasing something through some remote jungle. That would definitely be worth a dollar more. I don't go into detail about the movies I ""critique."" From reading other lengthy reviews or not so lengthy, you get a sense of what you are dealing with. This movie had potential of being 2 1/2 stars, if the screenwriter cared enough to use another .2 percent of his brain power. But, these types of movies do make money for most involved (producing, writer, director, etc...). Ninety-nine cents here and there adds up. Anyway, if you need to veg for a few, and if you are abroad, pay the .99 cents. If you are stateside and have Prime, its free. Or, .99 cents for US viewers.",1469491200,,2108,4.358778625954199

4373849,3,B004GSVX94,"RIVER OF DARKNESS

The last time writer/director Bruce Koehler and Kurt Angle did a film together previous to this one it was the serial killer flick End Game. Now if you read my review of that one or watched it yourself then you know what to expect here. This film is a horror flick that is ghost/zombie style with Angle actually a good guy here unlike that last one. Now I honestly don't know which of the two I like more, I will have to watch End Game again.

Sherriff Logan [Angle] is having a bad few days in his little town as bodies are turning up with the word Hix on them. He has no idea what is happening but he is determined to get to the bottom of it and stop these killings. He feels like this is the work of a serial killer but the town believes otherwise. They think a family from their past is back to seek revenge on those who wronged them. Now the Sherriff may be faced with something supernatural.

This is one of those movies that is bad and is funny most of the time for it. There are so many bad things about this film I don't know where to start. Now I know this is low budget so effects and things will not be touched, in fact I kinda liked them. With that said I have to say that the script may have been the weakest thing here. The dialogue is painfully bad at times and it seems that Bruce felt that almost every scene at to have some kind of one liner before we went on to the next. That can become the drinking game of the flick, every one liner take a shot.

Now I have read reviews that have said that the cinematography was bad but I disagree. In fact I actually think it was good but the editing made it seem otherwise. Like they got all kinds of coverage and the editor picked the wrong ones to go together or follow each other. An example would be the wide shot from the back of Angle pulling up on a bridge to talk to some old man who of course was standing on said bridge leaning over one side. The next shot after we see Angle walking up to him in that same shot was a shot of Angle still walking to him but from the front off to the side. This was then followed by a shot close in on them once they started talking. This was the first time in a while that I noticed the cuts in a flick in a while. It should have been the shot from the back holding all the way of Kurt walking up to him right into the tight shot of them talking. Watch it then think about it, you will see what I am saying about the editing.

Now on to the acting which I am sure most people are wandering about. Now I will admit that there is some horrendous acting to be found here, in fact most of it is bad acting galore. But there are a few people here that you can tell are good actors or at least are better than what they do here. This leads me back to the script, bad dialogue is just that, on paper or said out loud. Of course the direction is to blame here as well as some people just seem off even with their reactions, one in particular is laugh out loud bad.

This is the type of movie that Mystery Science Theater 3000 would have a field day with. If ever the show comes then this needs to be on there. I would have loved to have a commentary track for this from the director. Kevin Nash and Sid Vicious are the villains here and I am sure they had fun with that. Kurt Angle and Glacier Ray Lloyd are actually good here for the most part, like I said I blame the script. Over all this is one of those flicks that are good because of the bad. I recommend you watch it with friends and have fun with it, we did. In the end I actually liked it, it did have a cool storyline going for it.",1384732800,4,3605,3.9655172413793105

From the horrible acting, to production, story, everything! This is supposed to be a horror film but it's just so bad. Put this on at a party for a ""bad movie night"" then this movie should be put at the top of the list. As a bonus it has a theatrical trailer, the trailer actually makes the movie look good with good production, the trailer is a million times better than the movie.

4373867,3,B004GSVX94,"ok, so it's kinda cheesy lol, but it's still fun to watch with your friends and have a laugh with it!  It's too  bad that cheap filming was used to save money.  To be fair, I think that Kurt Angle would be an ok actor if he was given the chance to play in a real high budget movie.  However, it's still fun to watch when you're bored on a weeknight :)",1334534400,2,351,3.8333333333333335
4373868,1,B004GSVX94,"There really isn't much to this film. Kurt plays an atheist sheriff (not that it played into the film) who is attempting to solve murders in a small river town. There really wasn't much acting, not much of a soundtrack and not much of a plot. At first I thought this was an attempt at a Christian slasher movie, but it really failed there too as the heavy religion aspect didn't play any kind of role.

As a bad or campy film, it lacks there too. The dialouge was dry. I would say avoid at all costs.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. $3.99 for a rental? They need to pay you to watch it. This should be out on some cheap sci-fi 12 pack.",1325462400,,648,4.134920634920635
4373869,1,B004GSVX94,"This is the WORST movie I've ever seen. The acting done in the wrestling ring is better than the acting in this movie. Kevin Nash and Sid Vicious say about 6 words total between the two of them. Kurt Angle should have been so lucky. Everyone and anyone associated with this movie should be ashamed of themselves. The bad part about it all is that the story line is actually pretty good. If better actors with talent would have done this movie, it would have been better, with a few minor changes to the story. Also, no special effects, and a lame 70's late night movie look to the whole movie...almost soap operish. Even if you are a huge Kurt Angle fan, or wrestling fan (and I am) I cannot recommend this movie to anyone and not feel guilty about it. Terrible at best.

Second, the (and friends) cast's acting experience is largely made for TV or wrestle movies or practically no acting experience or D grade (no, that's not a B) level cheap horror/action flicks for the educated audience. Third, about the only place you can find this flick is as a $1 rental because - well, I wonder why.

Filmed on a grade school stage... the acting couldn't have been worse, porn films are better acted. The cap off for me was the boat scene.., I thought the story line is about a demented family of men coming back from the dead for revenge... Hmmm maybe there was a monster too???? You see a noose drop down hanging people one by one, yet the actors line up underneath it as if cued to do so by an understudy. The mysterious noose was on a pulley you could see the strings....lol  out of nowhere this monster's arm is lowered down on a rope (you can totally tell) lol... to grab someone??? Plot twist????? Where does a monster play into it??? did I miss something??? The scene where a woman learns her daughter is found mutilated.. let's say DELAYED REACTION?? She punches the sherrif I broke out the kleenex...I was crying from laughing my butt off....nothing was more hilarious, true HORROR films are somewhat SCARY!!The irony of it all is how they sucker people  into it with clever summation and cover art...this mess, more like a stage play gone bad.",1306368000,4,1175,4.537735849056604

8428946,1,B004GSVX94,"Honestly, the writing, acting/delivery, and lighting ruined what could have been a decent concept.

I have always thought that wrestlers should make great action stars. They have the physical acumen to pull off stunts. They often deliver odd and weird characters in the ring. WWE should be able to build an action movie powerhouse to rival Disney's Marvel studios. Sadly, despite the potential they seem to couple wrestlers with half developed scripts and weak supporting casts.

This film has more promise than execution. It is a cool concept that fails to deliver.",1500422400,,566,5.141304347826087

I found it much more interesting than a lot of ""horror""/gore-fest films I've seen, and it has an interesting take on folklore and paranormal occurrences.  I wouldn't say it has the best acting in the world, but it was passable all around.
