I am from Brazil and I want to make sure my baby will speak both English and Portuguese languages. The videos are cute and entertaining. I sit to watch the videos with her and she just stares at the TV. I repeat the words for her and I am always telling her what is on the screen. The music is so relaxing that she ends up sleeping. It is a great DVD collection. I love it!",1216339200,,549,4.238095238095238

Congratulations to the Super Baby Team for the excellent work done. I would love to see the series to grow, you must launch more titles!""",1198368000,,312,4.048387096774194
