5690804,3,B00C5OZL5S,"Wow this was much better than I expected. Had good scenery, crazy snakes, and a decent plot line. One of the better killer snake movies I've seen lately. Worth a look if you like killer snake movies. It is low budget, but not bad at all.",1375574400,,237,4.173913043478261
5690805,1,B00C5OZL5S,"The girl is engaging but the adults are awful, the script and direction more so, and the photography stinks.  And what kind of snake would seek out revenge on humans that killed its mate?  Huh?",1373155200,,193,4.485714285714286
5690806,2,B00C5OZL5S,"Rock singer Helen (Jessica Morris) and her daughter Lily (Oliviah Crawford) get stranded in the desert with homing snakes, criminals, and a bad script writer. In the subplot, the bad guys crash in a helicopter that burn with pink CG flames. One man gets shot in the back, but the wound first appears on his front shoulder. Later the wound moves to his upper arm. Likewise Helen has a tourniquet on her elbow that disappears for a while. The explanation is that Helen has the smell of the dead snake she ran over on her which is why the snakes are after her, the snake she didn't touch but removed with a stick. Lily was the stereotypical girl wise beyond her years.

It is a great film to look for mistakes. It was far from interesting or entertaining. A desperation rental at Redbox.

5690814,2,B00C5OZL5S,"Dull and unimaginative horror show, one of many with this uninspired and overused title.  A woman takes her step-daughter out into the desert for some alone time (she couldn't leave the daughter alone) to deal with issues with her husband (kids dad). Not only do they accidentally run over a snake, causing all the other snakes in the area to come after them for revenge, their car breaks down and they decide to walk the 30 miles  through the desert  to the next habitation, and they wind up confronting various components of a drug deal gone bad/murder. The snakes get one of the baddies (the one with the money) but the others catch them and demand to know where theyve hidden the druggies cash. Being stuck between a gun and a hard snake, they manage to escape, with the coincidental aid of the pissed-off snakes, and reunite with daddy and all is well. Its all very tidy, lacking any real sense of pacing. Cast is ok (Jessica Morris does well as the step-mom [look for her in 2016s horror-com CRABS] and Oliviah Crawford is good as the girl), desert environment makes an acceptable set. But its a competent but dull film with run-of-the-mill storyline and an overabundance of snake-POV shots that generate little suspense  or interest. Directed by Gary Breslin in his only feature directorial gig; hes better credited as a visual effects person/supervisor.",1436400000,2,1361,4.803418803418803

5690821,2,B00C5OZL5S,"This was a cross between a Syfy and Lifetime Channels movie if you get my drift.  I like what someone said in another review about it being so boring that even the snakes looked bored.

Spoiler:
Hardluck story for mom and daughter out in the desert.  Why are those mean ole snakes giving them such a hard time?  Boo hoo hoo!  Ifthat weren't enough, the folks they runinto aren't very helpful. That's about the extent of it.  No need to waste your time now.",1424131200,,456,4.369047619047619

5690824,2,B00C5OZL5S,"Just awful. The plot made no sense. The characters were dull and annoying. The ""venomous"" snakes appeared to be just regular nonvenomous black, corn and king snakes that somehow rattled. I was simply puzzled the entire movie. Two hours of my life that I'll never get back.

5690826,1,B00C5OZL5S,"What a waste of a perfectly good blank dvd. Instead of putting this piece of sh** on it, they would have done better to just throw the blank into the trash. Completely stupid. Acting wasn't too bad but the storyline was real bad. Unbelievable. Unlikeable. The actors were atrocious playing the roles they got. Not their acting but their parts. Crap. Total unadulterated crap. Why will NF not allow us to give movies like this one a minus stars rating because this one deserves a minus 5 or more.",1409443200,,495,4.573033707865169

5690828,3,B00C5OZL5S,"It seems a stupid premise that snakes take revenge but that is exactly what occurs in this movie. The flick has basically two story lines. At least it kept my attention and I would consider this a so-so movie. But hey, if you are thinking about viewing this flick, it really does not matter what any reviewer says.",1406851200,,314,4.431034482758621

5690830,1,B00C5OZL5S,"In a universe of bad movies, this one would still stand out. The most ridiculous situations, dialogue with zero self-awareness and a story that is so beyond preposterous it is mind boggling. The story involves a snake out to kill a mom/daughter because they ran over it's mate and ""it must have seen you do it"" and now it's mad enough to not only follow you, but marshal an entire desert to come after you. With some Mexican drug smugglers and an old desert man thrown in for good measure. The mere fact that this piece of crap got made should offend the entire film-making industry.",1404086400,,583,4.509433962264151
5690831,1,B00C5OZL5S,"A mid career crisis mom and her daughter are pursued by mexican black kingsnakes (non venomous) after running over a mangrove snake (mildly venomous, and not indigenous to deserts). There is something about some gang, or drug runners, I think. The mom makes one brilliant decision after another. It is just bad.

5690835,1,B00C5OZL5S,"This start is only because you had to put something.  How anyone can screw up a snake movie is hard to believe, but they did it.

5690836,1,B00C5OZL5S,"Slow, tedious, uninteresting. No character worth caring for. Stupidity factor sets the women's movement back decades.
