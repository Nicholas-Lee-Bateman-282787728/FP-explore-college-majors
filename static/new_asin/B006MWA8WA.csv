5006249,5,B006MWA8WA,I pre-ordered Heaven's Lost Property: Forte back in Feb. I recently received an E-mail saying that they are trying to obtain the item. So I'm not sure what I'm going to do. I love this series but damn I want it in my hands already. I saw on youtube someone who was doing an un-boxing of the item and the art looks great and it even came with several postcards of the characters. Very Cool un-boxing you guys should check it out.,1334534400,,428,4.2317073170731705
5006250,5,B006MWA8WA,"This series is one of the best i've ever seen, the release date of this is April 17, 2012. I don't know why amazon haven't update the date of the release yet but i love this series and i cant wait for season 3",1334102400,,209,3.772727272727273
5006251,5,B006MWA8WA,"Incredibly hilarious anime! Perverted but what do you expect of an Ecchi type anime, not that I mind! lol ^_^ Definitely recommend!",1331164800,,131,5.0
5006252,5,B006MWA8WA,"When I first saw Heaven's Lost Property's pilot for season 1, I thought 'I'll give this show a run threw'. As I was watching the credits of the second episode, I was sold on the series. 3 years later, it has been dubbed and I bought them up right quick and it was a ruff start for the dub (that 'WOowww~' in episode one...), but it got a heck of a lot better and I was glad I didn't have to switch to subs.

Now, I've seen season two 1 year ago and found it thousands of times better than the original. The comedy was thrown so far over the top, while still keeping that dark side with love mixed in was beyond well played by the creator. I LOVED IT.

After all that has been said, I cannot wait for the second season to come out.

HOWEVER! I would like something more on my Blu-Rays than just trailers and clean credits. Heck, a little commentary would even be appreciated than nothing. (The Baka to Test Boxset is prime example that Funi CAN DO A GOOD COMBO-SET)

After all that's said and done, I WILL BE BUYING THIS SERIES and I CANNOT WAIT for the Movie.

In conclusion, I would like to add that as of earlier this week, Japan aired an Ad that shows that they're coming out with SEASON 3. Be prepared everyone. You're in this for the long run, whether you like it or not... But it's impossible to not like it, so that's all there is.",1328054400,11,1338,4.130769230769231
5006253,5,B006MWA8WA,"Yes there will be a third season before you ask.

This is a great anime I bought the first season which was greatly dubbed and super funny i have watched season two or the forte in English subs and it was just as good. Lastly i would like to say that this anime is very perverted but this makes for some very hilarious moments. Between the Action and the love links this Dvd is a must have.

EDIT: The Forte comes with Synapse cards. I'm not sure if this is only for the limited edition or both but i thought i would add this.",1327449600,32,526,4.048076923076923
5006254,5,B006MWA8WA,"i already have this before the release date oddly due to a shipping error by rightstuff

Tomoki's peaceful life is far away in the past, now he has to deal with 2 angeloids Ikaros and Nymph along with his friends from school, each one of them is very special in their own way. Tomoki's dream about an angel warning him from the rage of heavens is getting very common at his sleep, then one day a new angel who has power up to the standard of Ikaros arrives on Earth with the sole purpose of terminating Tomoki since his dream is starting to connect both realities, the Earth and the Synapses. you will meet 2 new angeliods by the end of this season. delta and epsilon.

Heaven's Lost Property Season 2 DVD/ Limited Edition

the amazon current price is cheaper at 30 something with free shipping
and rightstuffs current is at : $41.99

they changed the picture of the box set at the last minute, which is odd. i got it and it had the picture it now has while it showed the ikaros and cake picture

you can consult the rightsuff site or heavens lost property on Wikipedia
and with some info i dug up via anime-news-network there is talk of SEASON 3 already in the [making] <YAY>

MY OPINION IF THE SHOW:
the show is crude, pervy, humor type but it has action , love and romance, great animation and consistent voice actors,i love the blue ray so id recommend that over. this is one of the best modern animes ive seen in quite a while and im looking forward to season 3.

series order:
start with heavens lost property
then buy heavens lost property forte

word of warning:
the dvd on this can be hard to read on old dvd players and will skip scenes or freeze the player.
i watch anime on both b ray and dvd

i hope this was helpful to those wondering about buying this item or getting into the series",1325721600,24,2156,4.2200488997555015

5006262,5,B006MWA8WA,"The fun continues in the second season with another Angeliod coming into the mix which as you seen in the last part of season 1 looks like trouble for Tomoki. There is still the same high school/adolescent comedy as in the first season and at this point there starts to be come in my opinion more insight on the ""Synapse"". I hear that it is during this section of the season towards the end that things began to differ from the manga ""books/magazine"".  I cannot comment much further on that as I myself have not read the manga but hope to in the future.
  I will try to keep this all spoiler free but I can say that the love tension rises and I so feel for Ikaros as she finds herself falling so hard for Tomoki and on the other had I would love to slap Tomoki for not paying better attention to Ikaros.  The innocence of Ikaros's character is what makes it feel so real for me and I also have to give complements to the rest of the cast as the rise to the occasion to make a great show.  Speaking of which I found myself warming up quickly to Astraea who like Nymph is unique from Ikaros.  All 3 angeloids gives a fresh feel to the show for me.  Still Ikaros is #1 for me!
  Also just by chance if you are wondering Tomoko ""the female version of Tomoki"" returns for additional fun and I couldn't help but crack up when I heard Tomoki as a girl say, ""Tomo knows what to do with a rod!"" Like I said earlier, its high school all over again for me.
  Now I gave this review 5 stars and I do think it earns it but if I had to complain I would say that I was disappointed to see only 12 episodes in this season as the 1st had 14.  As a general rule most follow up seasons typically have more episodes than the 1st season.

  Lastly, I said I wouldn't give any spoilers but as it seems in this anime, this season will be the pinnacle of the show as there is currently no season 3 but only 2 additional movies.  The two movies are another subject but as for this show, it is continues to have the right amount of drama mixed into the perverted ocean of comedy.  Honestly though, there are touching moments that really makes you feel for the characters and I personally wished I knew where to write in to try and get more seasons of this show.  If you enjoy anime and if you have seen season 1 than there is no doubt you'll love this show!",1488499200,,2331,4.085714285714285

5006270,5,B006MWA8WA,"- Synopsis: The whacky ecchi situations continue in this sequel. His life that is mainly of fun and games will be threatened as new enemies appear to instigate trouble and claim what they think is theirs. Luck seems to help out the main character, but how long will his seemingly peaceful, or rather noisy lifestyle last? Tune in to find out the conclusion to this fan-service heavy anime with its whacky situations as their story nears its end.
===========================================================================================================

- Analysis: This anime does a good job of emphasizing how many guys are: perverted and fairly simple-minded. Also the fact that women can get men to do many things by simply using their feministic charms. Likewise, that many guys have a tendency instilled into them to defend a female (girlfriend, sister, daughter, mother, etc.) in various situations.

- Comments: Overall, this is a simple anime to relax and enjoy. Has plenty of silly situations that can make for some laughs. Fan-service heavy, so if your tolerance for such things is low, it would be wise to stay away. Otherwise, enjoy the show for its fairly light-hearted tone, and whacky character interactions, not to mention the waifus.

- Features: English and Japanese audio with English subtitles. Includes 12 episodes on 2 DVDs, and 12 episodes on 2 Blu-rays. Approximate run-time of 5 hours. Although there isn't nudity, this is rated TV-MA for strong sexual content.

Ikaros, Nymph and Tomoki are back, with a vengeance. This season answers questions, and asks more. And has the funniest brother-sister type bonding scene. If you haven't seen season one, see it first. No you won't understand everything, I don't think even the creators do, but you will have a lot better understanding of the characters and settings. Note: I've re-watched any episode with Mikako at least 3 times. She's that fun to me.

5006285,5,B006MWA8WA,"This anime... Oh gawd this anime. Now I respect those who aren't into harrem anime on the account that they all seem to follow the same plot lines. I understand not liking echi stuff for similar reasons and for the fact people to want to see boobs in yo face. But this anime is not normal for even the two big genres it falls in no this anime breaks the rules punches you in the face and pulls you into the car and gives you a ride of your life. This show is hilarious and I enjoy the whole thing.

So the general idea of the show is some 16 year old pervert lives in a small quit town and simply wants to be left alone in his peaceful life. Then some half naked girl with wings falls from the sky and starts granting his every wish... Now I should mention that the lead in this show gets what's coming to hum , he doesn't get away with his perverted life style. Every character is likeable and generally quite memorable like that fish guy and the old quiet librarian lady and the guy who tricked the whole town to hunt each other down with guns in the woods for money.

If you want to watch a few episodes first before you buy go find them online Animeplace has the whole series. Oh and listen to the audio commentary they're a lot of fun too.",1460160000,,1244,4.094262295081967

5006375,5,B006MWA8WA,"When Tomoki Sakurai became the master of sexy, stoic angelic android Ikaros, his life of peace and quiet was turned upside down. In season 1, Tomoki struggled to deal with his newly acquired super-servant and her complete lack of knowledge of the human world. Nymph showed up and tried to carry out her orders, but found herself strangely attracted to the perverted teenager. Sohara, the childhood friend next door, slapped and karate-chopped Tomo for his numerous perverted escapades, but grew to become fond of Ikaros and Nymph. And the entire phenomenon of the dark orb in the sky remained a mystery.

But in season 2, a third angeloid, the busty blonde Astraea has come to take Tomoki out for her oppressive master back in the Synapse. Lacking computation skills (see: brainpower), the ditzy angeloid tries and fails to kill Tomo, and finds herself struggling with feelings for the perverted human. We also get more insight into Sugata, the head of the New World Discovery Club, as he tries to solve the mysteries of the new world the angeloids originate from. All of the stories are pretty light-hearted, though, and the antics more than outweigh any serious drama. Tomoki goes about groping big racks and getting pummeled by Sohara. Nymph struggles to deal with her romantic feelings for Tomo, and Ikaros struggles with hers as well. Overall, the zany plots have a heartwarming element to them that keeps them from getting stale. And the romantic struggles made me feverishly interested in each new episode- for anyone else who purchases this set, try not to think of the number of episodes you have left, it makes you that much more anxious to keep watching.

Season 2 is not very reliant on the first season if your just jumping in, but you have to watch both to get the full effect. Keep in mind, there are tons of dirty jokes and lots of sexual scheming on the mind of Tomoki. There is lots of fanservice, such as swimsuit scenes, jiggling breasts, panty shots, and more, but there is no real nudity. While there is nudity, all of it is censored. Unlike other fanservice shows, Lost Property censors naughty bits with little flying winged-thingies. So if you want nipple shots, try something else (I highly recommend Highschool DxD). In all truth, the lack of nudity is no big loss, since the sheer hilarity and heartwarming facets of the show outweigh any setbacks it would give.

The audio is great, and I assume is top notch if you have surround sound (which I don't). I am not an anime purist who watches in Japanese with subtitles; I watched the dubbed version only. The dub was HYSTERICAL. All the voices are perfect, and I never found myself thinking negatively of any of it.

The animation and art is beautiful. If you don't have a Blu-Ray player, you obviously won't buy the combo pack, but I highly recommend that you consider upgrading. This anime is gorgeous, and while it's not some award-winning masterpiece, the art and animations are all very fitting, funny, and attractive to the eyes. I haven't watched either of the DVDs in the set, personally. I probably wouldn't be able to stomach anything other than the gorgeous HD on the Blu-Ray discs.

In terms of extras, there are some trailers for the two season combo packs, other assorted Funimation titles, and all of the textless songs from the episodes on the disc (note that I speak for the Blu-Ray versions, as I haven't even touched the DVDs). I didn't really find the songs super-alluring, but they are all decent in their own right, so it's nice to at least have the option to watch them textless.

Overall, the give this combo pack a five of five. The only negative I can think of? That there isn't going to be a season 3! Er, well, that's what I've gathered from my reading online, anyways. Supposedly, the anime is being capped off with theatrical movies (the first is Angeloid of Clockwork, and I haven't read anything about the next one). That means we won't be getting much more of the series in anime format. (please note that I am NOT an expert on this subject; that's simply what info I know of at the time I post this review)

NOTE: Just in case anyone not informed wants to know, the watching order for the series is [Season 1 -> Season 2 -> Angeloid of Clockwork]. I bought Clockwork before this set came out, so I made sure to wait to watch them in order.",1410825600,11,4350,4.65625

5006381,4,B006MWA8WA,"Its been a while since Nymph and Ikaros landed on earth and made things chaotic for Tomaki.  But the dream warnings are becoming more frequent - as does the appearance of a new Angeloid Delta (a beautiful, yet completely dense angel) who has come to kill Tomaki - but seems to fail at every turn.  Nymph suggests they use the Dream Dive game to see if they can find out what the dream lady wants - but what will happen when they enter each others minds.  Also the master of Olympus is not happy with the loss of two of his precious toys - so he creates his own Angeloid of madness, Kaos.  Can the president of the New World club as well as three powerfull Angels stop not only the destruction of Tomaki, but also the entire world?

The perverse humor, disasters and humor continue in this second season.  All the original characters, as well as a few new ones show up as we learn more of the dark spot above the earth and we get more information about the Angeloids and where they come from.

The only thing I can add to the already accurate reviews( of the series, not packaging) is that this season must be watched after the first season. They give a little recap in the first episode but you won't get the full idea of what is happening to the angeloids and the struggle they go though. The first season shows the majority of the story of Nymph which is critical to entire plot.

It is seriously one of the funniest shows I have seen and they know how to turn up the action. After a while, the growing number of five star reviews will say more than words.",1398470400,,621,4.218487394957983

The animation, characters, story and English dub are great, but the excessive fan service maybe annoying to some!

Be warned that the series is not suitable for children due to all the fan service and if you're unfamiliar with the term then let me explain.

5006439,4,B006MWA8WA,"There is a humorous aspect to this show that differs to others, and I ended up seemlessly watching this entire series [with enjoyment].

Biggest part of that humor is the character's personalities. they are plain outrageous:
-the main char who is [VERY] perverted.
-the chairman who is so morally jaded, she thinks you should ""whack"" someone if they look at you wrong
-a supersoldier angeloid who gets stuck in freezers and thinks 1+1=50
-a guy who is really smart (this normally wouldn't be outrageous... except this is completely opposite of everyone else)

The ending is no more open-ended than any other series trying to leave room for a possible continuation; if anything, it wraps up more nicely than some others. it does end on a dull note though; I wasn't expecting another scene, but it would have been nice to leave some ""food-for-thought"".

Definitely generic plot and overstaurated fanservice, which I dislike. But wacky characters, a very sinister antagonist, a pretty good romantic aspect (the contrasting humor and characters help the viewer ""feel"" the romance) and good action [for a harem] made up it its weak-points.

Worth a watch for sure, but not worth buying for me.",1373587200,,1188,5.0152284263959395
5006440,4,B006MWA8WA,"In 2007, mangaka Suu Minazuki created the manga series ""Sora no Otoshimono"" (Heaven's Lost Property) which was published in the manga magazine ""Shonen Ace"" and is still ongoing in Japan.

With the popularity of the manga series, an anime adaptation by AIC was produced and aired on television on Oct. through Dec. 2009, with a second season that continued in Winter 2010 and a film that was released in June 2011.

With the US release of ""Sora no Otoshimono"" in 2011, the sequel ""Sora no Otoshimono: Heaven's Lost Property Forte - Season 2 was released on DVD in 2012, while other series and film were released on Blu-ray.  So, FUNimation decided to release the second season of ""Heaven's Lost Property: Forte - Season 2 on Blu-ray!

Directing the anime series is Hisashi Saito (""Bamboo Blade"", ""Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai""), screenplay by Yuuko Kakihara (""Fairy Musketeers"", ""Kage Kara Mamoru!, ""Persona 4: The Animation""), character design by Yoshiro Watanabe (""Bamboo Blade"", ""Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai"", ""Onegai Teacher!"") and art setting by Hiromasa Ogura (""Jin-Roh - The Wolf Brigade"", ""Ashita no Joe 2, ""Spirited Away"") and Hiroshi Gouroku.

For those not familiar with ""Sora no Otoshimono: Heaven's Lost Property"", the series is a perverted mature-themed anime series along the lines of ""Sekirei: Pure Engagement"", ""Rosario+Vampire"", ""B Gata H Kei: Yamada's First Time"" featuring a lot of perverse humor, fan service and sexual themes.

What ""Sora no Otoshimono: Heaven's Lost Property"" is about

""Sora no Otoshimono: Heaven's Lost Property"" focuses on a young high school teenager named Tomoki Sakurai, a perverted young man (who was influenced by his equally perverted grandfather) who has panties and sexual things that are constantly on his mind.  And if there is one girl he occasionally likes to check out, it's his neighbor and childhood friend Sohara Mitsuki.  Who is aware of Tomoki's perverseness and is unafraid to give him her special karate shop and knock some sense into him.

Despite how she tends to dislike his perverseness and constantly beats him up, she knows deep inside that she is in love with him. Sohara is also aware that for some reason, Tomoki has had some unusual dreams involving an angel which tends to awaken him like a nightmare since he was young.

Meanwhile, with the start of a new school year... Tomoki meets Eishiro Sugata, a scientist who is trying to discover a ""New World"" and his friend Mikako Satsukitane, a buxom sadist who has a mafia background and is also the Student Body President.

One day, while Tomoki was outside, he sees something in the sky, a UMA (Unidentified Mysterious Animal) and she happens to crash land on Earth.  The UMA reveals herself as Ikaros, a ""Pet-Class Angeloid, Type Alpha"" and together, the two are bonded by an invisible chain and Tomoki becomes her master.

In the beginning, Ikaros is an emotionless individual and because she is bonded to him and goes wherever he goes, it becomes somewhat of an annoyance for Tomoki, but at the same time, he realizes that with her abilities, it can help him make his perverted dreams come true.

Eventually, Sohara, Eishiro and Mikako learn about Ikaros and the two young women try to help Ikaros learn about how humans behave, while Eishiro tries to learn more about her programming and why she was sent to Earth, especially why she chose Tomoki.  And in order to keep the activities of Ikaros private, they join Eishiro's ""New World Discovery Club"" to see if Ikaros may have some tie to this new world of Angeloids and Synapse that Eishiro is currently researching.

Meanwhile, another Angeloid has appeared on Earth, and her name is Nymph, an ""Electronic Warfare Angeloid, Type Beta"" who can't stand humans and is sent to Earth to confront Ikaros. But similar to Ikaros, the more time she spends with Tomoki and friends, she gets to learn about human-kindness and what a nice master that Ikaros has.  Unlike Nymph, her master  (Master of Synapse) is abusive, maniacal and evil...but because she is tied to him, she will do as he wishes.

It is then revealed after a confrontation between Ikaros and Nymph that she was sent by the sadistic leader ""Master of Synapse"" to possibly destroy human-kind, something Ikaros does not want to do...especially now that she has started to discover newfound emotions...love for Tomoki.  But not just Ikaros, but also Nymph as she wishes more and more each day that she had someone like Tomoki as her master.

And now...""Heaven's Lost Property: Forte - Season 2

With ""Heaven's Lost Property Forte: Season 2, the sequel continues a few months later, but this time, a new Angeloid has been sent to Earth to kill Tomoki.  Her name is Astraea, blond, well-endowed and is a close-combat Angeloid, Type Delta sent by Synapse to kill Tomoki, but despite her awesome power, she is very dumb.  So, no matter what she does to try to kill Tomoki, due to her ability to keep falling all the time, Tomoki uses those moments to feel her up.  And at first she is clueless and doesn't like it but she starts to realize that she may be falling for Tomoki.

Meanwhile, Nymph shows Sugata that they can enter their own dreamworld.  But when Sugata ventures into Tomoki's dreamworld, for some reason certain things that can only exist in the dreamworld is also existing in the real world.

And while Tomoki and friends try to deal with Astraea, a new Angeloid named Chaos is sent to destroy Tomoki's friendly Angeloids.

VIDEO:

""Heaven's Lost Property: Forte - Season 2 is presented in 1080p High Definition. Because this is an animated film and not a TV series, everything from the scenes featured on the TV series and the footage shows much more shading and detail than the TV Series. Picture quality is much more vibrant, colorful and detailed.

Art backgrounds are well-painted and there is a good amount of lighting effects, especially when featuring the Angeloid's in battle or Ikaros wings come out. If anything, ""Heaven's Lost Property: Forte - Season 2 looks colorful, vibrant and sharp on Blu-ray and AIC A.S.T.A. did a pretty good job with anime production.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Heaven's Lost Property: Forte - Season 2 is presented in English Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and Japanese Dolby TrueHD 2.0. It's important to note that despite me typically watching anime series in Japanese, I chose to watch this series with an English dub because of the better dynamic range but mostly because FUNimation Entertainment really enhanced the perverseness and the craziness of the series through its dialogue.

Dialogue is crisp and clear with the action-scenes on both lossless tracks utilizing the surround channels.

The biggest difference is the Japanese version, while perverted is appropriate for Japanese television while the English dub really runs wild with mature themes and sexual perversion.  The voice talent in the audio commentary talk about why they enjoyed doing this series and its partly because they could let loose and have fun.

But it all comes down to preference.  Both versions are well-acted and I did watch it both in Japanese and English and enjoyed both voice acting, it's just that the English version was much more perverted and the dialogue changes made the series quite fascinating and hilarious.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Heaven's Lost Property: Forte - Season 2 comes with the following special features:

  Episode 4 Commentary - Featuring ADR Director Christopher Bevins, Greg Ayres (voice of Tomoki Sakurai) and Trina Nishimura (voice of Sohara Mitsuki)

JUDGMENT CALL:

If you enjoyed the first season and you are an anime fan who loves perverse harem anime with scantily clad women, boobs and panty shots, suffice to say, ""Heaven's Lost Property: Forte - Season 2 is for you!

There is no doubt that  ""Heaven's Lost Property: Forte"" is one of the most perverted anime series ever created that's not a porno.  Granted, the most perverted TV anime series (non-hentai) is still ""Ping Pong Club"" but the mature humor of this series definitely puts it's up there of one of the perverse series to make it over to the U.S. and one of the few that is available on Blu-ray.  From the opening episode, the character Tomoki, a teenage boy that just loves boobs, panties and it's in his mind continuously, so much this season that he is trying his best to calm his willy down and not have his periodic hard-ons.

But it doesn't help that a new angeloid with huge breasts, who often keeps tripping and falling down, thus showing her panties to Tomoki nor does it help that Ikaros is often not wearing much.  So, for Tomoki...having these beautiful Angeloids around is not helping much.

But it's not just Tomoki, you have Mitsuki Sohara, Tomoki's childhood friend who acts very strict towards Tomoki, but in her dreams she can't help but think about Tomoki being a pervert and fondling her breasts, while the gun happy Mikako has a thing about wanting to be naked in the hot springs all the time and like Tomoki, she's also willing to partake in booby grabbing as well.

So, you get the picture...this is indeed one of those anime that lonely otaku guys (or those who simply love perverse anime) will love but yet enough craziness and humor that makes it accessible to anime fans who love this type of anime.

Outside of Tomoki's sexual fantasies, while the first season focused on Ikaros trying to become more human, this time around we see more emotion coming from Nymph as she struggles as an angeloid without wings and without a master.  While Tomoki prefers her to be free with no master, Nymph still struggles of not having one, especially since she cares for Tomoki so much.

The first half of the season focuses on Astraea, while the second season focuses on the group taking on Chaos.  So, the second season also features quite a bit of action!

So, make no doubt about it, this sci-fi harem anime series is perverted and full of sexual themes but its important to note that there is no full frontal nudity or intercourse or anything like that.  Private parts are covered by hair (or some cloud) and if anything, the series is more comedy-driven through Tomoki's behavior and of course, the harem element as we know that Nohara, Ikaros, Nymph, Aestraea (and possible more) are falling for Tomoki.

As mentioned, the series does have some of that ""Urusei Yatsura"" craziness but also the ""Chobits"" style of an angeloid who acts almost like an emotionless android but overtime, her emotions start to come into play through more exposure to Tomoki and friends.  So, while the majority of the series does feature more lighthearted to crazy, wacky plots...it does has its serious and emotional elements, although the latter doesn't last that long.

As for the Blu-ray release, I'm glad that FUNimation has decided to release ""Forte"" on Blu-ray as it was the only title that was released on DVD.  So, fans should be happy that they can now complete their collections of ""Heaven's Lost Property"" with this second season Blu-ray release!

Overall, ""Heaven's Lost Property: Forte - Season 2 was a fun, silly yet entertainingly perverse anime series.  There is no doubt that this will surely entertain anime fans who enjoy harem anime series especially with that sci-fi element and a bit of raunchiness as well.

5006454,5,B006MWA8WA,This is the same review for season 1 multiplied by 3. Laughed so hard I was crying. Tomoki is some kinda special. And by special I mean (stupid) but funny.,1369008000,,155,4.2
5006455,5,B006MWA8WA,I have season one and this only adds to the greatness that is anime and anime collection!! So I say go for it!!,1368316800,,111,3.869565217391304
5006456,3,B006MWA8WA,"The first series was building an harem of angeloids and then working out what the mysterious new world was. The true nature of alpha also came out in a coherent way so that it (the series) built to a nice crescendo. I don't think they expected to get a second series, however. Quite a few ideas are poorly recycled (the gunman, etc) and the plot with Delta and Daedalus didn't really work. Delta was nicely insane though. One would have expected some form of resolution of the plot but they forgot to do so. So it's great for eyecandy but lacking in substance. The best harem/fan service anime's manage to combine some plot along with the visuals and this doesn't; 3 stars.",1366848000,,673,4.524590163934426
5006457,4,B006MWA8WA,i have season 1 and The Angeloid of Clockwork on blu-ray but it makes me sad that season 2 never got a blu-ray release. still an amazing show though.,1365206400,,149,4.172413793103448
5006458,5,B006MWA8WA,i really enjoyed the series but was a little upset when i opened the movie case to find it broken...  other than that no problems with it.  really good show,1363392000,,156,4.166666666666667
5006459,5,B006MWA8WA,The most amazing and hilarious anime I have seen yet! It is worth the money! Plus its cheaper than buy the first season dvd in standard definition than high definition. You can both season in standard definition off amazon instant video for about $36 or $37. No lag.,1362355200,,266,4.5625
5006460,5,B006MWA8WA,"awesome with delta showing up.  Harpies are still bad. The characters are still learning and feeling out their emotional structure.  Gen 2 is awesome, however, twisted in programming.  Funny that alpha showed her programming emotions in season 1 episode 1, but is still trying to figure it out. . .Angeloid. . .even sounds cool.",1360368000,,328,5.037037037037037

5006472,5,B006MWA8WA,"I loved this series because its about a young boy who is definitely a pervert in a cute way.  This series has great humor and the main character is constantly getting himself in some sort of trouble, one way or another. Sometimes you may get lost as to whats really going on after an episode or two but then the main story comes back into play. I would recommend this to any anime fan who like to laugh and see a lot of big boobed women every episode.",1359504000,,451,4.125

I wanna buy everything involved with this anime! i get depressed when I get closer to the ending if the show I watch so dearly,sooo...if the makers ever see this... PLEASE Don't stop making this show! Oh and if you could make a show with Tomoki near a valcano or desert that'd be awesome!",1359331200,,303,4.333333333333333

5006475,5,B006MWA8WA,"By now you know that if your not into harem or perverted comedy your in the wrong place.  You also should know that if your hardcore and plot focused your also in the wrong place.  If you want some great laughs and some uplifting humor this just may be for you.  Please see my review of the first season.

I just finished this season yesterday (yes I watched the entire thing) my two favorite episodes are in this season-- A proud fought battle and The brother who came from Heaven.  You will know why when you see them.  They also introduced two new angeloids in this season but didn't really focus on them much.  The plot evolves a little more with the occasional episode off for laughs.  I am rewatching part of season one but not because of the plot just because I like to laugh.

Something you may not know Heaven's Lost Property: The Angeloid of Clockwork (Blu-ray/DVD Combo) (2011) comes out Feb 26 2013.  Its a full length movie focusing more on the plot and some background.  I haven't decided if I am going to pick it up yet but if the price comes down I might.",1357689600,4,1071,4.331658291457287

5006478,5,B006MWA8WA,"I never use to like animes, along time ago my brothers friend or a family member got my bro into them so i watched one and started watchin a few more and it took awhile for this style of anime to grow on me (not speaking of these exact shows) but soon i was liking all sorts of shows, such as: Ghost in the shell: The movie , that was the 1st one i really enjoyed alot, then many years pasted and i got back into them when ghost in the shell: S.A.C. came along, also i enjoyed Cowboy bebop alot and loved the movie. There are a lot of great animes out there, the reason i like them so much is because of the things that are possible in them which are not in a real life setting, such as all that impressive magical powers most have lol. or having a robotic body or just plain sexy lol. Anyways If you have not seen season 1, i suggest you watch it or you will not understand the 2nd season of Heaven's lost property Season two.

A few things i would like to say about the show, there is almost zero nudity in it, however zero is not an absolute zero, so this is not for kids by all means, but if you saw the 1st season im sure you know this.

Another thing that really got me into liking this show is that i can really feel for the characters in the story, like you want them to do the right thing or maybe you had wished things had gone differently, this is the kinds of things that really bring you closer to your self and your own imagination that is.

Also please note that this is also a bit of a Out there anime, if you get what im saying, its not your every day kind, if you like big boobies that bounce a lot and sexy girls doing all sorts of stuff then i would totally suggest this to you lol.",1355961600,3,1702,3.941860465116279

5006501,5,B006MWA8WA,"Season 2 picks up where season 1 ends. A new Angeloid is sent to earth to eliminate Tomo. Fortunately she a dummy, and cannot seal the deal. She ends up just hanging out and getting on everybody's nerves. The plot is pretty much the same, but the fun factor is still very high.

The animation and the voice actors are both still good. I think I like the soundtrack better in season 1, but this one is good too. If you liked the 1st season, you will definitely like the 2nd. I had a lot of fun watching it and I hope you do too.",1350345600,2,527,4.019047619047619

5006510,5,B006MWA8WA,"This show is full of ecchi comedy gold and emotional scenes that may even make you cry. It is a great continuation of the series. It is a show that finds a way to combine a light hearted and fun atmosphere with a serious side that creates interesting plot developments. I fell in love with the series with season 1 and i was very happy with this release of season 2. I can not wait for a season 3 to come out for this show. I highly recommend getting this show weather you ave or have not watched season one, because in the beginning of this season it gives a brief explanation of what happened in season one.

5006524,5,B006MWA8WA,"This anime show is just amazing! It's a mixture of a pervy boy who always gets his plans foiled half the time, a bunch of angeloids that eventually become his friends, and funny events each episode.
This is the second season and a third season was said to be made, but I couldn't find the approximated release date. It will happen though so I'm excited.
The style of the anime art is new and not like old anime shows. It's a lot better though with very smooth texture and great shading.

I didn't know that it came with four tomoki's ""special"" stash postcards which is a surprise to me.
Heaven's Lost Property Forte was a lot more comical than the first season, but you should still buy both.",1335398400,,692,4.40625

Without the cardboard box it would be like having half of a season in the box. I don't know how this is ""limited"" I don't want a cardboard box and some post cards that aren't even set up to be post cards instead of bluray discs for the same price as a DVD/Bluray combo. I am very disappointed. It feels like I got half of what I paid for. I thought it had Bluray when I ordered it months ago, maybe I was mistaken, or maybe they changed it.

But I'm not hear to talk about that, I'm here to tell you that this anime is worth every penny.
Wiether it be on DVD, VHS, blueray, or even  on a pop up book.
The story will have you going, and it's crude humer will leave you smiling.
This anime is the perfect mix between dark, funny, romantic, and so much more.
If you're an anime fan then this a must for your collection.
I highly recommend it, and if it goes to pop up book I'd highly recommend that as well.
Because there is no way this story could be bad.",1335139200,,615,4.125
5006528,5,B006MWA8WA,"So after having received my amazing boxset, I completely forgive the fact that it arrived late, or rather I forgot about it. Anyway, onto the packaging. Just like the first set, it's totally sturdy and awesome to look at. You can sort of see some pixelization on the characters but other than that it looks good.

The inside is what interests us so onto that! The DVD case has a reversible cover, showing off the busty (in the cases of some and not others...)heroines of the series. I do love me some fanservice, and the extras that come bundled with it are great to look at, but they're just postcards of the girls in various promiscuous scenes, for lack of a better word.

As for the content of the DVD, I couldn't ask for anything more, other than the promised DVD/Blu-Ray combo pack. I would have loved to see the bouncing boobies in glorious 1080p, but beggars can't be choosers. The dub is okay, but I have trouble with Ikaros's voice since it lacks emotion, when in the Japanese counterpart she has begun to show more and more of it. Heck, there's even a scene where Tomoki points out that she's becoming aware of herself, though I guess that doesn't necessarily mean that she'll show more emotion apart from embarrassment. The characters show some development, and the story itself turns dark , though it retains the comedy that I so enjoy. I could swear I found myself crying manly tears for Tomoki, or tears of laughter, they both feel the same.

The one gripe I have with the show is the ending. Having read the manga well into the current chapter, it makes it completely impossible for them to really continue on with the story without adding some original stuff. I mean I don't mind I just wish it remained faithful to the story. Though I have heard that with the ending to the Sora no Otoshimono: The Angeloid of Clockwork movie, it would return the anime back to the manga and continue on from there.",1334707200,4,1915,4.528901734104046
