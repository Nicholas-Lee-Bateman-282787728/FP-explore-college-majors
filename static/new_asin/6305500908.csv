So when i  watched it, it started off great like a very serious action movie, but then  after the main title, everything just seems to fall apart, it could have  been really great, but they really picked the wrong animators and writers  for this. if it was by the same people that did the darker saturday show,  it would have been very good, but instead it was like the eraly mourning  kiddy one which i'm not to fond of, so after wathcing it, i was  dissapointed completely.",936403200,,667,4.196850393700787

The dubbed voices are good with the exception of Tails (he sounds nasal) & the animation is fast paced with plenty of action. This dvd is out of print & hard to find.

1040545,4,6305500908,"This is a semi-feature length animated film starring Sonic the Hedgehog and his friends Tails and Knuckles. Just under an hour in length, it's a raucous, entertaining ride.

Sonic gets contacted by the president of Planet Freedom (possible synonym for Mobius or yet another planet where Sonic resides). Doctor Robotnik sends Sonic and Tails on a mission to stop an energy surge in the dark, alternate dimension of their planet, before a planet-shattering explosion occurs. This is made somewhat difficult by the insidious Metal Robotnik and, eventually, Metal Sonic.

That's about as coherent as I can make the plot sound, but it in way does justice to the craziness in the movie itself. One minute the movie is an entertaining action adventure movie, the next it undoes all that with jokes that undo most of the movie's integrity. Think Shrek, only with Japanese craziness. Take how the president is an incompent dweeb (and try to ignore the irony in that). Take how Metal Sonic subdues a supporting character only for us to find out that he just dressed him in Sonic's favourite clothes. Take how one scene is like a game of whack-a-mole, where Knuckles is the mole. Take how Robotnik is bullied about by the not-at-all annoying-to-the-point-of-hair-pulling Sara. Take the turtle.

Yet for all its determination not to be taken seriously, I immensely enjoy this short movie. The plot is fast and keeps your attention from beginning to end. Sonic, Tails and Knuckles bounce off each other very well and all have entertaining personalities (though some die-hard fans may raise eyebrows over Knuckles stating that he's a treasure hunter). If you've ever played Sonic CD and remember its animated cutscenes, this movie is like that from start to finish. The bouts of over-the-top chibi-like craziness are forgiven because of the fast action and beautiful vistas.

Audio-wise, can't complain. The music is especially excellent, well-composed, catchy and supports every scene. The English dub is energetic (in the case of Tails, sometimes too energetic) and entertaining, if maybe a bit too doggedly lip-synched.

In conclusion, Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie is by no means perfect of perfectly canon (then again, nothing since Sonic Adventure has been), but this is a great early 90s flick that oughta scratch your itch for animated Sonic goodness.",1322870400,,2345,5.128272251308901
1040636,3,6305500908,"I love this movie since I was a little kid and am trying to get things that help me relive my childhood (in a sense). The only problem about this movie is that it's so expensive. Why is that, is it out of print and in little quantity. The last time I talked about this movie is when I was a kid and all my friends and other people who played the sonic games said this movie sucked and IMDB gave it a less than average review,but I didn't care. So why is it so expensive! Other besides that, love the movie, strongly recommend it.",1319587200,,529,4.0476190476190474

1040638,5,6305500908,"Sonic: The Movie is a direct-to-video movie which tells about Dr. Robotnik having to create Metal Sonic and kidnap Sarah (A human girl with a monkey tail. The reason why she's created is unknown). Sonic and Tails have to stop him again and crush Metal.

Like how a game-based movie SHOULD be, the movie follows the games' plot faithfully, and it's an animated movie, so the characters look familiar and are easy to identify.

The movie has several comedy bits, so it might be even more easier for you to enjoy it.

Some might say the voices are terrible, but I kinda like 'em.

Overall, the movie had made the blue blur proud. However, try to find this movie at a lower price than $60.",1290816000,,685,4.456

1040640,5,6305500908,"In Japan, this was a two part ova series. Dic changed it into one feature though, so it's a movie.

I'm unsure if all copies are like mine, I bought mine around 1999, and it's uncut. However, I recommend this movie.

It's light hearted near the beginning, but becomes increasingly dark. It might confuse some Sonic fans, especially new ones, but I still recommend it.

The dubbing is pretty good. It's, obviously, more similar to the original 90s voices, rather then the Sonic X voices, but the voices for this movie are not from any other Sonic movie or game. Tails sounds like he has a cold, but you'll grow on him.",1252972800,,617,4.491071428571429
1040641,5,6305500908,"First off, let me warn you: GET THE DVD AND ONLY PLAY THE JAPANESE VERSION! The dub will literally hurt your ears. The seiyuu picked for the Japanese voices, however, are excellent. (Especially for Knux!) Never watch the dub unless you need a spiteful laugh. I don't know what they were trying to do, but both Sonic and Tails sound like they have nasal problems. Knuckles' voice is just wrong. The only reason I did not detract stars is because I never need to listen to the dub again. The Japanese version is music to my ears",1236470400,,526,4.43298969072165
1040642,5,6305500908,"It may seem that there is no difference between the 1999 DVD version of this movie and the 2004 DVD version. But there is. When England translated the movie they also edited some content out of it too. The 1999 DVD version has those edits but the 2004 version doesn't. For instance Sonic was sapposedly flipping MetalRobotnik off but but England tryed to redraw it so it looked like his index finger but this edit is not on this version.

So if any of you parents want to protect your children then get the 1999 version, but for all you big guys that have been Sonic fans for a long time should get the 2004 version because it ROCKS!!",1174953600,3,634,4.3277310924369745

Sonic the moive is a great moive ok well not fully great the voices chould have been better and thare are more lines In the uncut version to see that version just switch it to japnese subtitled in english. Anyway it starts off with sonic and tails realaxing on the beach when the presdents hech man arives(a owl)To tell sonic and tails that he needs them. Sonic and tails rush to the white house only to find that doctor robotink is holding the presdent hostage and he will only let them go if they stop the genrater that metal robotink bulit along the way they meet pepole such has metal sonic knukles and metal robotnik. The moive runs for an hour full of action adventure and speed. But parents should beware this is PG and has some viloince a few swears(even in the edited version)blood and suggtive jokes and scary imges. And don't think just becuse amazon isn't selling it no whare is selling it just try ebay.com well I hope you see this moive and enjoy it.,1139097600,2,1029,4.392670157068062

1040745,5,6305500908,"True, This Movie Has Pretty annoying English Voice Dubbing.
But, This Movie Is Pretty Good If Your Fan Of (My Favorite Video Game Icon) Sonic, Or If You Grew Up With The Sega Genisis and The Sega CD Since The Main Story Is Mostly Based On The Games ""Sonic The Hedgehog"" 1, 2, 3, And The Sega CD Game ""Sonic CD"".

So If You Still Want To See This Movie, Just Remember.

Number 1: The Voices Dont Match The Characters(Espessially Knuckles).
Number 2: Before Watching This Movie, Pretend You Never Seen ""Sonic X"", ""The Adventures Of Sonic The Hedgehog"", ""Sonic
UnderGround"", And So On And So Forth.
Number 3: Keep An Open Mind, Invite Friends and Just Enjoy The Film.

I Find Sonic to be the first and all ways the most beloved franchise of mine. It is the very foundation of my youth and my friendships. But in otherwords The Movie is awsome, I infact just watched it a few hours ago. If your a Sonic Fan buy it without another thought, if you like good anime or a decent hour-long film then take time and investigate, I won't lie I love this film but I won't mislead those who would rather pass.

English version has been reamped for little kids, the dialog was changed, there were a few curse words in the japenesse version and sexual jokes, but it's been completly changed for little kids.

1040850,5,6305500908,"This single, relatively short 60 minute movie WITHOUT A DOUGHT tops the Adventures of Sonic the hedgehog, and the other old Sonic saturday cartoon. Any Sonic fan should watch this instead, (and probably the relatively new Sonic X anime as well). The only characters that people will recoginize are Sonic, Tails, Knuckles and Robotnik (no Amy or anyone like that), there are other ""movie-specific"" characters as well, though they don't add a whole lot to the story. Robotnik tells Sonic and Tails that his generator is going to blow sky high, and with it the entire planet, of course, they expect he's lieing, but what if he isn't? For the final battle Sonic ends up battling his robotic look-alike (kinda), Metal Sonic, which people may remember from the older video games. I like this movie because it reminds me of the video games, (lots of frantic action and jumping around). The animation style is a little weird here, but is okay for a change of pace. The english dubbing is just bad, but you should be able to get around that. I could have been a little longer, 60 minutes is barely feature length, but it's fun to watch as kind of a ""quick flick"". Great if you're a Sonic fan, but if you've never watched anime before I'm not sure what you'll think at first!",1115337600,4,1265,4.601769911504425
1040851,4,6305500908,"I'm a huge Sonic fan so naturally, I'm going to want to buy this DVD. The animation isn't the best but it's not as bad as the ""Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog"" series. The English dub isn't that good at all. I don't think Sega ever intended on having Sonic sound annoying at all. Sonic and Knuckles are NOT best friends, they're rivals. The fact that Tails is a technical genius is addressed as well as him being immature. The whole rival angle between Sonic and Knuckles does get addressed at the end of the movie making for a rather humorous ending. I did catch an adult oriented joke in the movie. The reason that I still give this 4 stars because it has a well thought out story behind it. The Japanese voices seem more natural than the English dubbed voices.",1110931200,3,764,4.387323943661972
1040852,4,6305500908,"The first disappointment I found with the DVD I got was it had no Japanese audio track to it. But this may not be the same version as what I bought (I had the mainstream PAL R2 DVD) so you should enquire first if that's important to you :)

Second disappointment was the terrible voice actors for the English dub. The characters (especially Tails) had the most annoying sounding voices.

Third disappointment is that it seems to stray from the Sonic plot a little too much. It may have just been me, but I don't recall Knuckles being Sonics best friend, I thought it was Tails. Plus where is this Land of the Sky? I thought Sonic was on Mobius? And what about Metal Sonic? Didn't he kidnap Amy Rose in SonicCD? That's not the way this plot tells it.

The good points about this movie are the action fighting scenes and the constant flow of wacky humorous scenes which aren't afraid to crack a few naughty jokes now and then ;)

The conflict between Sonic and Metal Sonic that happen at the end of the movie is worth waiting for. The beginning half of the movie was a little slow, with the only decent scene being the fight with the Metal Egg robot. I actually think Eggman wasn't taken seriously enough throughout the movie. He started at the beginning of the movie VERY well, but after that just became a bumbling idiot.

The scene at the end, with Metal Sonic plunging to his doom is the most touching of all, as Sonic tries to save him but his help is refused as Metal Sonic announces that there can only be one Sonic as the lava coming up from the ground slowly devours Metal Sonic.

I think a new Sonic movie is required, one that has a better story because this one is rather weak when you compare it to the Dreamcast games. Sonic fans will love this movie, but I don't think anyone else will.",1109116800,4,1799,4.339285714285714

It may get alittle confusing with characters that new sonic fans have not seen before. Its got comedy, Action, and even alittle romance.

When the movie was over one side of me was saying ""That was super cool"" and the other side was saying ""It wasn't really what I expected."" First off, the Movie itself is really good, if you watch it a second time you will probably like it better because then you pick up that it is supposed to be a funny and action-packed movie. The voices are pretty cool, But I kinda wish they had Ryan Drummond doing the voice of Sonic(voice actor for sonic games)

1040998,4,6305500908,"While there has never in my opinion been a cartoon that fully captures the spirit of speed and adventure found in the best Sonic games, this movie probably does the best job I've seen so far. Is the voice acting stupendous? No, more like hilariously cheesy (in a good way). Is the animation incredibly life-like and fluid. Not really, more like Saturday morning cartoons. And the characterization? The video games are deeper.
Why is it so great then?
SPEED.
This movie is fast, fast, fast. If you like the motion-blue zip-zagging that many anime are famous for you'll probably love the action sequences (I know I did). If you love the idea of sonic fighting metal sonic you'll love their fights in particular. And if you can get into the spirit of the whole thing (it is MEANT to be funny and DEFINITELY not to be taken seriously) you'll have a great time. I especially love the music, and the weird jokes like Robotnik and Sara playing a fighting game and her losing over and over.
Overall, this is definitely one worth checking out if you are a big video game or sonic fan, or if you've exhausted all the well-known action anime and are looking for something fresh and different (and maybe something cheesy like some of the great movies from the 80's).
Oh, and you've got to love the springboards and spikes! Right out of the video games...",1083110400,13,1342,4.595833333333333
1040999,4,6305500908,"Originally this 'movie' was a two-part special series created by the same team which did the intros/extros to Sonic CD (Sonic Team Animation Studios Japan). It was shown once on a Tokyo-based channel before being released onto video as two separate episodes.
When ADV did the dub, they merged them together to create the 60-minute 'movie', and if you have the original videos (like me), the cuts where they remove the Japanese titlecards are obvious (i.e. when the screen goes all red and the music skips a bit).
The animation was made in 1996/7, and has had three re-releases as the movie, this being the third. Only changes are the boxarts, and maybe the DVD menu system. This is BEFORE the Sonic Adventure adaptations ever existed, so comparing them to this isn't accurate.
The movie itself I believe is very good as long as you don't watch it with the English language switched on. The translation isn't too bad either, though it has been dubbed down a bit, but if you know Japanese you'll still hear the words (when Knuckles gets stuck in glue, you'll see ^_-).
South Island is also the second part of Mobius, Sonic 1+2 etc. are based around West Island, so again, anyone who says that it doesn't link to anything shall have to do a bit more research into the games.
I give this video 4/5 stars because it is very well made and is a good DVD to have in your collection. The art resembles a city similar to New York but after the apocalypse. Attention to detail is very good and ST Animation Studios JP did a good job on this.
(Note: ST AS JP did not do Sonic X which is premiering now. Sonic X is meant to be based loosely to the games, and link them all together. This is meant to be using an original storyline.)",1080345600,,1719,4.443037974683544

Others say this movie sucks in general. They're wrong. Sure, Sonic's personality was off, Tails sounds like he has a cold and Knuckles wears a cowboy hat, but in all honesty, this anime is GREAT!
Sure, it's crappy, but it's crappiness is what makes it great! It's one of those animes that isn't supposed to be taken seriously, you just enjoy it for what it is. Once you get intuned with the hilarity of the way the characters talk and move and the situations they get into as well as how they deal with them, you'll be laughing your butt off and cherrishing this movie as a work of art! My personal opinion might not pertain to others, but I know for a fact that the first time I saw this movie, I didn't like it too much either. The second time it got better. Once I got to the tenth time, it became one of my favorites. You may not like it at first, but give it time, watch it over and over, and believe me, you'll love it! It's hilarious!
I give this anime a five out of five for it's greatness, and I'd give it a ten if they'd allow me to. Give it a shot, guys. It won't let you down, I promise.",1075507200,9,1264,4.184426229508197

Knuckles for example, I have yet to see him wear a hat, and I don't think he's ever that chummy with Sonic, Tails sounds too young in this and it derates his character immensely, he's younger than sonic, sure, but he's not just a kid, he CAN fend for himself. Robotnik is just annoying, How many times have we seen the same plot here people? Some Mecha Sonic of some kind... whooo scary... seen it more than needed in the video games.

On this DVD, the features are more than annoying, Knuckles the Aardvark I think itw as? WTF!!! Knuckles is an ECHIDNA!!!!! Whoever was in charge of making the DVD extras did a shotty job and the movie it self seems very cheap and quick. I expect a lot better from the new Anime version of sonic coming out this fall called Sonic X, I've been a fan ever since the Genisis Days when Sonic the Hedgehog 2 came out. C'mon people, Sonic is cool, but we need to see something more like Sonic Adventure 2 going on here!

1. The music is great
2. It's pretty funny

4. Sara, the person that they have to save is an indrecibly annoying idiot, and it's a wonder why Sonic didn't just throw her off a cliff
~~~~~~~
Well, here's a brief description. Eggman threatens to kidnap Sara, the presidents daughter if Sonic doesn't save ""the land of Darkness"" from this reactor blowing up. So Sonic goes to ""the land of Darkness"", and it turns out to be a trap, and so, Sonic has to fight ""Hyper Metal Sonic"". It's basically like the video game - Run around. Blow up robots. Yay. It's good for a game, but not for a movie. I wouldn't really reccomend this, unless you're a kid.

1041180,4,6305500908,"I have seen three of the four Sonic cartoons. This isn't the worse of them, but it's far from the best. While the ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" show on ABC had a good storyline, good animation, memorable characters, etc and the syndicated ""Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog"" had... humor, this lands somewhere in the middle with decent animation, a little humor, and no memorable characters.
The story is simple: Robotnik (Eggman to those of you who've latched on to Sonic in his ""Adventure"" days) has been kicked out of his city, and Sonic has to go save it along with Tails. When they reach there, they fight a giant robot (This particular Sonic is an anime), and beat it with help from Knuckles. Then they go on to find out that Robotnik is behind the big robot, and he now plans to melt the polar ice caps in order to collapse the world.
One of the things I don't like about this movie is that the entire world is suspended in the air. This leaves Knuckles pretty homeless (He lives on a floating island in the games). They did give him a nice little niche, though, as a treasure hunter.
All in all, this is a good Sonic movie. Not the best, but not the worse. Sonic and Tails' voices may annoy you at first, but you'll get used to them.",1037232000,,1231,4.356521739130435

1041184,4,6305500908,"I am a long-time fan of Sonic, ever since the Genesis games.  I followed the Sonic Archie comic for years, but I finally stopped when it got too far out there and boring.  (Hey, Eggman was gone for about two years in the comic!)  I've started to get back into Sonic because of and in spite of SA2B, which I found to be a game with a few really fun levels and a lot of boring junk otherwise.  I'm telling you this to let you know that I am very familiar with Sonic.
I originally bought this (which is not actually a movie, but two ""episodes"") in English-dubbed VHS.  Thus, I was forced to suffer from Sonic's Felix the Cat impersonation; also, I hope Tails gets over his cold.  The dub informed me of something I did not know: apparently, Eggman has some German or Russian in him, as it seems from his voice.  As for the action, Sonic's running and jumping sequences were great.  I was glad to see just Sega characters (except for the two other Overlanders), since I've spent years seeing the contrived Archie/SatAM characters in print.  Also, it was cool to see Knuckles wearing Hawking's hat (fans of the Archie comic know what I'm talking about), but his character was still completely messed up.  A treasure-hunter?  Oh, please!  Knuckles is the Guardian of the Floating Island, sworn to protect it and the Chaos Emerald from threats coming from afar as well as those from within, or something like that.  I recommend this anime in the Japanese DVD version only.  The English dubbing is really bad.",1028764800,,1501,4.5315985130111525

1041261,5,6305500908,"I remember when many of my friends and I obsessed over the old SEGA Genesis games featuring Sonic the Hedgehog.  Now, after seeing some of the best anime from overseas, I still can't stop loving Sonic.  There are some minor flaws to the movie, but it's just too much fun to notice.
First off, let me warn you:  GET THE DVD AND ONLY PLAY THE JAPANESE VERSION!  The dub will literally hurt your ears.  The seiyuu picked for the Japanese voices, however, are excellent.  (Especially for Knux!)  Never watch the dub unless you need a spiteful laugh.  I don't know what they were trying to do, but both Sonic and Tails sound like they have nasal problems.  Knuckles' voice is just wrong.  The only reason I did not detract stars is because I never need to listen to the dub again.  The Japanese version is music to my ears.
And about the music... It's great!  The general SEGA style, upbeat, technoish, fast and fun.  It's all too catchy.  The animation is a bit DBZish.  (That's not a compliment)  I guess it most reminds me of Final Fantasy Unlimited because there are very few shadows that define the characters... They look a bit two dimensional.  Surprisingly, it improves a bit during the second half of the movie.
The characters in it are:  Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Eggman, Sarah, Old Man (Some owl), and the President who is father of Sarah.  None others.  (Sorry comic and cartoon fans, no freedom fighters besides the blue blur and flying fox)  I don't mind, though, because for the condenced and isolated story, it works to have only the main characters.  And while it doesn't follow nearly the same way, it does remind me of the games.
I highly recommend this to Sonic fans, but like I said, keep it Japanese.  Hey, it IS anime, afterall.",1021507200,35,1744,4.572815533980583
1041262,1,6305500908,"There is nothing wrong with converting video game characters to TV or film, just as long as it's understood that TV and film need more of a plot than video games.  Racing along knocking out robotic villains might be okay if you're playing a video game, but it hardly makes a good film.  The plot of this one, for what it's worth, involves Robotnik capturing a princess and tricking Sonic into going down to the underworld where a robotic Sonic is lurking.  That's about it - the plot.  There's nothing to make this even visually entertaining - the animation looks cheap and nasty, the same sequences are used over and over again.  The vocals are terrible, with Sonic as a squawking brat, a nasal-whining Tails and a Robotnik with a laughably unconvincing Germanic accent.  Basically the whole film has an ""it's just for kiddies, so we don't need to put that much effort into it"" feel about it.  Frankly that just smacks of laziness.  There are plenty of good kids' films and cartoons out there.  This kind of mindless dross is fit only for the boy scouts' rifle range.",1021075200,,1068,4.608465608465608

The ""old man"" was an old owl who was as empty headed as the day he was born. (I laughed kinda hard at his antics)
The president's daughter, Sara, was one of the funnier characters. However, there is some humor that is a little mature (in my opinion) for 7 year olds. It's the funniest part, but it really is a bit- over the heads of the younger Sonic fans. Never  mind what her cat tail means.
The animation was crude, of course, but the expressions on the characters' faces were really funny. Robotnik and Tails looked the funniest.
Oooh! And don't forget the action. There were ""badniks"" from the original few Sonic games, of course, and Sonic gave Metal Robotnik a headache he wouldn't soon forget.

Sonic, Knuckles, and everyone else's voices sounded like they spent the day in a william shatner reading studio, after breathing heluim for six hours.
The plot:  An interesting idea, with a few minor twists, but it just never seemed to get going, and before you know it, the show was over.  Plus it was hard to note just how evil Robotnick (Eggman) was supposed to be.  He had a love interest with the presidents daughter, despite the fact she hated him, and at times he appeared quiet comical.  It seemed that everyone had trouble staying in character.

HyperMetalSonic is not ""never-before-seen"" as the cover  dictates. Metal Sonic was directly from the 1993 Sonic CD game. He also  appeared in Knuckles Chaotix, Sonic R, and a few issues of the Archie comic  books (#25, to be exact, and two upcoming issues). Sonic would definitely  have needed 50 Magic Rings and seven Chaos Emeralds, but this film makes no  mention to the Rings or Emeralds.
The videogame Sara loses to Robumnik is  reminiscent of ""Sonic the Fighters"", an arcade-style fighting  game that never came out on Saturn. Viewers will notice Buttnik's robots fanning the President  and washing the windows.

1041453,1,6305500908,"Presumably released to cash in on the new Dreamcast game 'Sonic Adventure', this tells the tale of Sonic's enemy Dr Robotnik tricking Sonic into going underground to destroy a giant robot, but the reality of the  situation is that a robotic version of Sonic is waiting down  there.
Though there are a few attempts to do something serious, this is  little more than an early-morning cartoon.  True, all the characters are  present - Sonic, who spends the film being irritating.  There's Tails, who  sounds like he has the flu all the way through the film.  And there's the  one with a silly hat and no character, as well as Dr Robotnik sporting an  utterly fake-sounding accent and some girl who is so obnoxious you actually  want her to die horribly.
It's all very repetative and dull.  You may as  well watch somebody playing one of the Sonic games.  At least the graphics  in those are far better than the naff drawings and tacky animation on  display here.
A complete waste of time and money.  Watch it twice?  I  think I deserve payment for being forced to yawn my way through it once.",949363200,,1089,4.578125

7890721,4,6305500908,"I first took notice of this film in a trailer on another anime VHS. From what I saw as few brief and plot silent scenes the feature looked awesome making this the finest Sonic the Hedgehog animated product aside from the video games I've ever seen. Forget the games because this movie is designed to look, sound, and move like the early genesis productions.

To start the animation in this film is truly special. It's all well done with fast paced illustrations, beautiful environments, and great action. The anime style is a near perfect blend of standard contemporary animation and the old 50's American style which inspired the first great manga artists of japan.

It's great that sonic, tails, and knuckles are in this. The voice acting is at times a little ridiculous with accents. But the dialogue is cool and funny. Robotnik is perfect and he's great in every scene. The president and princess are mostly forgettable but still nice. Hyper Metal Sonic has only line and it's perfect.

The physics are also interesting. There are so many warp holes and variations on speed you really feel that these characters move in an entirely different dimension. Forget real life most cartoons don't function like Sonic and friends. Hell he stands on plane and doesn't fall because that speed means nothing to him.

The plot is great if not predictable but there are moments of destruction that catch you by surprise.

The music is superb and in itself is a good jam and idyllic of fast electronica from the 90's.

The timing of this movie is also interesting. It was released 1996 and appears to take place after the events of sonic and knuckles/sonic 3. I'm only a stickler on this because metal sonic is also seen in these games. The movie for the U.S. opened 1999 so this product is an edge transition between the later sonic universe known more so in the 128 bit era. Although he is robotnik he looks more like Eggman the android reincarnation of himself. Robotroplis also looks a lot like from the Television series in the beginning.

My only downers on this flick is the poor translation of the names for planets such as ""Mobius"" is missing. Also that the plot has no connection to the chaos emeralds which is the main cause of conflict on Sonic's home world.

What makes this film so good is that it was produced by Sega Enterprises under the direction of Team Sonic. It is not a cheap imitation or emulation but made by the real company. I give this move 4 stars just because of terminology and mild voice acting at times. If a redub were done it would change everything. However this film is more akin to the 1990's Sonic and probably has little appeal to newer or younger generations of game playing kids. Put this on before putting on any crappy incarnation of ""Mario.""",1407715200,,2775,4.648979591836735
