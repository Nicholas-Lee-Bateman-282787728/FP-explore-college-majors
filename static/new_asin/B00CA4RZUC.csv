8579068,5,B00CA4RZUC,"These transfers by Film Chest are the best I've ever seen. The video and audio are wonderfully clear. I've tried watching ""The Red House"" several times before, but the quality was always so poor that I never made it past the first 10 minutes. This is the first time I've watched it all the way through. It was an OK story, but there really isn't much to it, so I was disappointed with the story, but not the quality!  ""Suddenly"" gets the cleanup it deserves. It's tough to watch Frank Sinatra as such a hard-boiled, mean person, but he is believable. I had never heard of ""Kansas City Confidential"" before, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. This film has several actors whom I know from other films and was surprised to find them here---John Payne, Lee Van Cleef, Neville Brand, Jack Elam. The plot is offbeat and action-packed; the film keeps the viewer riveted all the way. Thank you, Film Chest for giving us great quality transfers to enjoy three great films! I'm anxious to see what you can do with other public-domain films!",1493596800,,1025,4.601092896174864
8579069,5,B00CA4RZUC,Three very good movies starring some great stars. Although two of the movies are not what I would call true film noir they are still great movies. The collection is released by Film Crest which I had never heard of but they did a great restoration of the movies. The picture and sound on all three movies is excellent. I would highly recommend for film noir or old movie fans.,1385078400,12,376,4.385714285714286
