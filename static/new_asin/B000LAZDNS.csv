8160996,4,B000LAZDNS,"Although the DVD for this program has only recently been released, the original date of the broadcast was in the 1980's.  If you're a novice like me that doesn't matter because the basic elements of gardening probably won't have changed that much and there is a lot of very good information on the DVD.  The host is an elderly English gentleman so his use of language is a little bit different than the American English with which we colonists are familiar, but he does not say anything you won't understand.  You might want to consider the ""Rebecca's Garden, Volume 2 - Rose Gardening"" DVD as an alternative.  The source material is newer and the host speaks in a comfortable (for me) American idiom.  Either DVD is about the same in length of time at just under an hour, they both are priced about the same.",1170806400,11,809,4.551724137931035
