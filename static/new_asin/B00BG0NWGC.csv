5615688,5,B00BG0NWGC,"I have had several workout videos over the years and this is hands down the best I've used! Erica's information is educational and understandable. Her workouts are effective and fun! After years of Pilates under multiple instructors, it's refreshing to learn new techniques I've never seen before. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone, postpartum or not!",1399593600,,355,5.245614035087719
5615689,5,B00BG0NWGC,I bought this for a friend who just had her first baby and had been struggling to get her pre-baby body. She was nervous to try her workout alone so I volunteered to try it out with her. This awesome workout kicked our butts! We finished the DVD feeling healthy and strong. We have been doing it for the last two months and my friend has finally got a taste of her old body. I will definitely continue using this great workout!,1399248000,,427,4.219512195121951
5615690,5,B00BG0NWGC,"I've had the luxury of working out with Erica in person during my first two pregnancies. During my third pregnancy, I was unable to train with her in person, and these DVD's were the next best thing! I've trained with other pilates instructors and Erica is hands down the best! Her understanding of prenatal & postnatal fitness is what makes her workouts so unique. She helps you tone your body safely before, during, and after pregnancy. She also helps you strengthen all the right muscles you will need for delivery and recovery. She offers a variety of levels and modifications so you can adjust to your own level. The workouts are also great because they are separated into short segments so you can do several in a row for a long workout, or just one for a shorter workout. These DVD's are the perfect postnatal workout. I can't say enough good things about the workouts Erica puts together. I wish I could train with her in person regularly, but since I can't, these are my go to workouts. I recommend them to anyone!",1387411200,,1023,4.595628415300546
5615691,5,B00BG0NWGC,My baby is 7 months now and I have been doing Erica's workouts since I was 3 months pregnant. The pregnancy and after baby DVDs are all great! The exercises are focused on strength and mobility and are perfect to help get your body back after having a baby! I have gotten great results and have enjoyed the workouts.,1386633600,3,316,4.372881355932203
5615692,5,B00BG0NWGC,"Thank you Erica Ziel for creating a program that helps me feel like I'm actually doing something to get my body back after baby! I used the pre-natal dvd's and still use some of the workouts after baby, but these have really helped me feel empowered at a time when you don't really feel like yourself. The workouts are easy to follow but very effective, and I always feel uplifted both physically and mentally afterward. I've even done them with my son in his swing next to me and it works out great. I would highly recommend these to anyone who wants a safe and effective workout after baby and beyond.",1384473600,,603,4.441441441441442
5615693,5,B00BG0NWGC,"My son is 2 months old and I have just started using this DVD, following a modified version of the sample schedule outlined in the booklet that comes with it. My joints haven't fully recovered just yet, but I find that this has much less impact on my knees and ankles than the couch to 5K workouts that I attempted. Although the workout is challenging (and you will definitely be sore!) I found that the workouts were easy to fit in when I could (segments ranging from 11-27 minutes) and were not so challenging that it discouraged me from keeping with it. I have also tried the Tracy Anderson Post-Natal DVD and found that so much of the DVD was focused on abs where I could barely get through the first 10 minutes! This DVD definitely focuses on core exercises without being all about crunches. Make sure you have a couple pair of dumb bells (I've been using 2 lb and 5 lb to start) and a yoga mat... and be prepared for your glutes to burn the day after your first squats workout! Once you've mastered the beginner series, there are intermediate and advanced workouts to progress you. Although I've just started using it, I would (and have) recommend this DVD to anyone looking to slowly easy back into exercise after giving birth.",1371600000,4,1234,4.513392857142857
5615694,5,B00BG0NWGC,"I have an 8 month old, and I'm just  now starting to get back in shape.  I had been looking for a video, since I live in Texas and it is way too hot to do anything outside.  A lot of the after baby workouts are a lot of cardio, and I really can't do those right now (nursing).  But this DVD is great.  There's no impact, but the constant movement from one position to another still gets your heart rate up.  There are several workouts (including options for more advanced users), and an enclosed booklet helps structure which ones you do when.  Each workout is no longer than 25 minutes, which is great when you have a baby.  There's also an option to play the video with music only, without the instructor's commentary.  One of the best workout DVD's I've seen.  Highly recommended.",1371600000,7,783,4.375
5615695,5,B00BG0NWGC,Challenging workout! And I'm still on the beginner level workout! Glad Erica has info on abdominal separation too! So glad I bought this!,1369180800,,137,5.0
5615696,5,B00BG0NWGC,"I love implementing these videos into my workout routine.  They were exactly what I needed when it was time to get back into shape after my second pregnancy.  All workout levels are great for the different stages you are in after having your baby.  The beginner workouts are great when you are first getting back into shape and the intermediate/advanced levels are fantastic workouts after you've built up your strength from the first DVD.  I followed Erica's workout booklet, which helped me build a base in the beginning and gave more structure to my workouts.  I cannot say enough good things about this great DVD set...if you are looking to get into shape after having a baby (or anytime), this is it!",1367884800,,705,4.745901639344262
8567866,2,B00BG0NWGC,Though this did have a few good exercises for bringing the abdominal muscles back together I was disappointed and have only used it three times.,1511740800,,144,4.8
8567867,3,B00BG0NWGC,"The exercises are ok, just low quality production. The girl herself has no camera experience....she keeps side glancing. It's annoying. Also, the children on the cover is misleading, I thought you could incorporate baby into the workout. Yeah....no.",1502841600,,249,5.578947368421052
8567868,5,B00BG0NWGC,"Love, love, love the postpartum exercises in the videos! Erica is very knowledgable  as she guides you in each exercise while thoroughly explaining its purpose etc. I definately recommended to start healing your postpartum body & beyond!!",1478131200,2,238,5.4324324324324325
8567869,2,B00BG0NWGC,I was not fond of this workout.  The arm workout injured my back because she wants you to swing the dumbells around and the Pilates part felt like I wasn't working out much.  She barely talks about kegals.  I needed more instruction.  I hate posting a negative review on this because she seems like a really nice person but it simply did not do much for me.  I like bounce back after baby by be fit mom much better.  The abdominals really feel worked but in a gentle way.  I also like the original post pregnancy workout by Tracy Anderson much better.  I use the band that comes with the bounce back after baby dvd and I wrap it around my stomach and have seen positive results.  Good luck!,1470441600,4,690,4.286821705426356
8567870,5,B00BG0NWGC,"This is a great investment if you're looking for a DVD set to exercise at home with. It's low impact, challenging and effective. Erica's voice is calming and easy to listen to. I don't have kids. I'm skinny and trying to tone up a bit and lose a few inches off my belly. Her exercises are working. I can already see improvements in my posture, and some definition in my arms, belly and thighs. I do all exercises from one DVD each day for 6 days a week and give myself one rest day in a week. Also, one minor detail that I really appreciate is her outfits. She is fit and toned but doesn't flash her body by wearing only a sports bra and skimpy  shorts. Not that it's a big deal but it really helps me not to hate myself for not having that perfect body already while I'm working on getting there.",1464307200,7,797,4.141935483870967
8567871,5,B00BG0NWGC,"Only 2 weeks in, but I love the exercises so far. The music is pleasant and the workout flows so well from start to finish. My posture has already improved and I feel really good!",1443484800,,179,4.142857142857143
8567872,2,B00BG0NWGC,"This video is in a ""home"" setting and is just not entertaining enough to follow. It looks great and very appealing, but for the price, I was expecting much better quality.",1425513600,2,171,4.548387096774194
8567873,5,B00BG0NWGC,"I lost all but 5-7 pounds of the weight I gained during my pregnancy by doing light exercise and eating healthily. To lose the last few pounds, I decided that I needed to take it up a notch in the exercise department. So I started looking for a doable exercise program. I did some research and learned that I had a bit of diastasis recti. Nothing major, but enough to know that I shouldn't be doing burpies or crunches until I was all healed up.
This program is the perfect fit for me! The exercises are challenging, get your heart pumping, but at the same time soooooo doable. During the workouts Erica switches up the moves so you don't feel like you're just doing the same thing over and over. And when you feel like you can't possibly do anymore it's over. She takes you to your limit, not past it.
SIDE NOTE:
I really appreciate how Erica Ziel dresses in these videos. She's modest, and I'm not concerned about giving my children a bad message about how their bodies should look. It's all about being healthy, inside and out and being a better Mommy.... and that means not obsessing about looking ""perfect"".",1423699200,18,1112,4.482758620689655
8567874,5,B00BG0NWGC,"This is an excellent DVD set. I started using it two months post-baby and am still using it 5 months later. I used this along with lots of walking and am in the best shape of my life. It did a great job safely and effectively strengthening my abs after my c-section. This program continues to challenge me as I have moved from beginner to advanced. The workouts challenge my whole body and there are enough workouts that I have not gotten bored. I love how the workouts are broken into small chunks so that no matter how little time I have I can always squeeze in some amount of exercise. Erica is pleasant, encouraging and gives clear directions. I highly recommend these workouts.",1416873600,2,682,4.508064516129032
8567875,5,B00BG0NWGC,"LOVE her workout.  Very comparable to the postnatal yoga class I was taking,  Perfect for those with ab separation!",1408406400,2,115,5.0
