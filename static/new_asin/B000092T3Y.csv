1877011,5,B000092T3Y,"You don't really need to review something this cool!  All I'm going to say is that if your not watching The Dead Zone on USA then your missing the best TV show since the Early X-Files.  Stephen King, the Pillers, and Anthony Micheal Hall have re-vamped the Dead Zone to a series that should be ruling cable television.
--Jonathan Leonard  (Third season Please!!)",1060646400,3,362,4.714285714285714
1877012,5,B000092T3Y,"This series is inventive, engaging and highly entertaining. I'm sorry I missed it on television. I highly recommend this series to anyone who wants some quality programming. I can't wait for season two to be released. I hope those people keep up the good work.",1058745600,2,260,4.8
1877013,4,B000092T3Y,"When I heard this show was coming out, I had no intention of watching it at all.  I am not into psychic phenomena or all that sort of stuff.  But I caught the pilot episode on an encore airing on the Sci-Fi channel one Friday night and was hooked from then on.
If you've read the original book or the reviews here, then you already know that ""The Dead Zone"" is about a man named Johnny Smith who lives a charmed life in a quiet Maine town.  Until a car accident and a LLLOOOONNNNNGGGG coma take all that away.  When he wakes up, he finds he has the ability to see visions simply by touching people, seeing both their futures and pasts.
Anthony Michael Hall gives a quiet but compelling performance as Johnny Smith, trying to fit in again...  Another great character is Bruce (John L. Adams), Johnny's physical therapist and best friend.  Bruce brings the show humor and warmth, helping Johnny cope with his unwanted ""gift"" and trying to discourage Johnny's obsessive pursuit of Greg Stillson.  Another interesting character is David Ogden Stiers' Rev. Eugene Purdy.  At first, I was concerned that Purdy was going to become a charicature, one of those televangelists squeezing people for money.  But so far his character has been supportive of Johnny's gift and has tried to show Johnny care and concern for his well-being.  He often leads the viewer to wonder exactly where his intentions truly lie, but so far he's turned out to be one of Johnny's allies.
As soon as this comes out on dvd, I am DEFINITELY getting it!  It is worth it, believe me.",1054771200,14,1548,4.592727272727273
1877014,4,B000092T3Y,"The Dead Zone is one of the best shows on TV. The show alone gets five stars. But the reason my review is four stars is because of the somewhat deceiving nature of this DVD release. When you buy the DVD set, there is one open slot with no DVD. This is for the ""pilot"" episode. And in order to get this episode, you have to send in a card that comes with your DVD. It would have been much better if they had simply included the DVD and saved the consumer trouble of sending in a card to get the pilot. It's just like those ""rebate"" offers - companies know that few people will go through the process of sending it in and that's why they offer it.",1054598400,101,645,4.007751937984496
1877015,4,B000092T3Y,"The Dead Zone is definetly one of the best T.V shows around nowadays (what with the demise of 'X-Files')and has finally given me something to do on monday nights.
 The basic plotline is the same as in the movie; Johnny Smith (played superbly by Anthony Michael Hall) is in a terrifying car crash which leaves him in a coma for six years. He awakens to find everything has changed and he now possesses the power of second sight, thus cueing a series of situations where he must use his psychic powers to help people.
 Everything about the series has a refreshing feel about it (especially some of the camera work and special effects) and all the lead carachters are perfectly cast (Anthony Michael Hall beats Christopher Walken hands down). Also, unlike most of the crap on nowadays, the stories actually rely upon and develop these carachters with emotion being the driving force rather than, say, kung-fu fighting (as in Dark Angel).
 As for the first season itself, it has some great storylines and plot ideas (the pilot and final episode are especially good). The only trouble is that some of these episoides are a little slow, especially the really early ones. Compared to what the series is doing now (season two was phenomenal!), this can be quite aggravating.
 Overall, i would say this is certainley a good buy, but leave some cash for the release of season two, as that season is just about perfect.",1052006400,24,1408,4.73469387755102
1877016,5,B000092T3Y,"If you have not seen this show before then you need to watch! I have been watching The Dead Zone since day one and I absolutely love it. I can not wait for the DVD to come out! It is one of those shows where you are leaned back in your chair at the beginning but by the end of it you are just about to fall over the edge.
To give you a little background Anthony Michael Hall plays ""Johnny Smith"" a man with psychic powers that he obtained after a car accident that left him in a coma for six years. How his powers work is by a touch. All you have to do is touch him and he will see something that has happended in your past or something that is going to happen in your future. ""Johnny"" uses his powers to help people though. In the First season he was able to save a woman from being raped and he was able to save a teen who was going to die from an unseen heart condition.
Each show is always suprising and you can't wait to see how Johnny Smith (Anthony Michael Hall) will save the day with his psychic powers.

1877018,5,B000092T3Y,"Really liked this series when it was on TV. Different from other series. Bought this one for a relative who has enjoyed it. The first season includes the pilot episode so anyone interested will not have to buy it separately. The beginning two or three seasons are always the best with any series and that is true here. Approximately 3rd season it begins to go into Armageddon, end of the world storylines, which made it less interesting to me. It only touches on that some and still has some of the storylines I prefer.  I like the human interest storylines where Johnny uses his ""gift"" to help/save people and the ones depicting his complicated life since coming out of the coma. Someone that likes something different will probably like this series. A more current series that is similar is Saving Hope (2012 to present).",1486944000,,823,4.715277777777778

However, one night is all it takes to change everything. After being in a coma for eight years, Johnny wakes up to find his girlfriend, Sarah (Nicole de Boer), is no longer his and his own son doesnt know who he is. He also discovers the added bonus of being able to see visions of the past and future. It seems that the dead zone in his brain is suddenly active as a result of the damage caused to his brain before going in a coma and suddenly Johnnys world has been turned upside down. Now he must use his newly acquired visions to help people but controlling the future isn't as easy as it sounds. One little change and suddenly a big change in the future can occur, but not always for the best. Johnny struggles with becoming the hero the world wants him to be and his newly acquired fame, wishing he could go back to his nice, quiet, vision free life and trying not to imagine what if, while at the same time trying to keep the people he cares about safe as well as the rest of the world.

Also, the intro is way too long. Acting is okay but a little too dramatic at times for my taste.

1877073,4,B000092T3Y,"Amazon Prime offers this show for free, so while shopping or whatever, you can watch.  When I saw the movie, 'Dead Zone', I didn't like the direction, and the lines were too predictable.  Acting was wooden.  But the story was good, and I wanted to see it in a series.  Here is that series, and it is much better than the original.

The first two episodes are patterned after the movie, but improve on it.  Script is much better, acting is superb, but what invested me in the series was the moment when Johnny met Sarah's husband, and the two soon bonded.  It was a believable moment, the timing was excellent, and the actors pulled it off well.  So now the husband is loyal to Johnny, and it's Sarah who has a hard time adjusting.  All this is played with subtlety.  The big ending in the movie, is reserved to become the long plotline for the series, and shows up at the beginning of the second season.  That too, is an improvement:  for the original Dead Zone movie, was way too fast (so the actors had no time, to nuance their portrayals).

The series explores the difficulty of having such a paranormal 'gift', as would be expected for any series of this kind, but no magic, witchcraft, or even divine implications are hitting you over the head.  Basic idea that the brain is not much used, so when a head injury occurs, possible abilities not normal to human experience, occur.  That's believable.  Tied to it, but unspoken, is the idea that time is but one big now, so seeing the future can be as perspicuous as seeing the past.  The hackneyed idea that touching an object unlocks that vision, isn't portrayed badly.  So you can get your head into the idea, whether true or not.  And thus, enjoy the series.

The biggest difference between the series and the movie, is that the series plays out, the 'vision' Smith had of 'Stillson' becoming president.  That is the long plotline.  It's a doozy, and worth playing, even though some stereotyping is used.  Stillson's and Purdy's characters are wonderfully nuanced, versus the movie;  should have been more scenes with them in it.  Great ensemble cast, good chemistry, good variety of topic coverage.

Sadly, the continuity people didn't do their job well, causing the longterm plot to unfold with inconsistencies, so is jarring.  Also, USA or whoever dictated the company line, is too enamored of the episodic:  Johnny saves someone with his psychic abilities, wash rinse repeat.  The episodic stories are good; but they need to be threaded each time to the long plotline, to avoid the 'canned' effect.  (Too many canned single episodes in a row, increase viewer boredom and lower ratings.)  What distinguished Buffy and Angel, is that each episode usually elucidated some aspect of the longer plotlines.  Hence only four stars for Dead Zone, which has the same goals, but loses sight of the longterm plot linkage too often.

As usual, the last few episodes of Season 6 are rushed, leaving lots of loose ends.  There were almost no clues to gradually get the reader to the surprise ending, so it seems contrived and disappointing.  Again, that's a continuity problem.

In sum:  great script, varied play, lots of humor and self-deprecation.  Would have liked to see more episodes with the other characters and their backstories.  Again, continuity is uneven, with respect to the long storyline, so you get the impression that advances in the long-term plot are just inserted, patched.  Even so, series remains a cut above expectations.",1368057600,3,3490,4.780569514237856

1877082,5,B000092T3Y,"I never thought that Anthony Michael Hall could have carried the rich legacy of one of Steven King's most celebrated and timeless works, ""The Dead Zone."" However, I could not have been more wrong. This series was outstanding and surprisingly very poignant to watch every week.

Just to give you an FYI.  I got the 1st season of Dead Zone with the booklet that goes with it, but to my disapointment, it had 2nd season discs in the box set.  When I went to check the lineup for the 1st episode online for the 1st season, it should have the title ""Wheel of Fortune"", that's the one when Johnny wakes up from his coma, and not ""Valley of the Shadow"" (from 2nd season / 1st episode).  And the 1st season should have 4 discs in the box set not 6.  I don't know how a box set titled for first season got mixed up with second season discs in this set.  Who dropped the ball on this one when the box set was made?  I am making arrangements to return it because I have the second season box set (black box) that I ordered from another vendor via this website.

1877108,5,B000092T3Y,"As a pilot, I do have down time often and in that time I can sometimes read a book or take in a show.  What I started doing was watching TV series on DVD, since my schedule hinders me from watching regularly scheduled programming.  I just finished this first series of the show ""The Dead Zone"" and have some compliments to shower it with.

The Dead Zone is based on the original novel by Stephen King, with many of the original characters from that book.  Some might remember the original movie that had Christopher Walken in it.  Instead of that particular outcome, this series takes on a life of a different nature after Johnny Smith wakes up from his coma.  Smith is soon back in his quaint Maine town and whether he likes it or not, is using his powers to help people.

The Johnny Smith character always intrigued me, and reminded me somewhat of the character created by Stan Lee so long ago called Bruce Banner, who turned into the Incredible Hulk.  Instead of an alternative form and personality, Smith has to balance his ability to see things in the past or future with the people that surround him in the present.  The risks are high and the reward is sometimes meaningless, but in the end Johnny Smith is a class act that I enjoy.  This series has mystery, action, drama, and just a fantastic element of filming that I have not experienced for quite some time.  I look forward to watching season 2 and strongly suggest that if you are tired of what is on your regularly scheduled programming, check out The Dead Zone!",1186099200,4,1526,4.492753623188406
1877115,5,B000092T3Y,"I came pretty late to this series.  My wife and I were looking for something to watch in the evenings of summer, when regular TV REALLY stinks.  Not having cable, we've often resorted to picking up box sets, and have thoroughly enjoyed binging on shows as varied as SIX FEET UNDER and THE 4400.

So we gave THE DEAD ZONE a try, and have really loved it.  We're both huge fans of the original book and the terrific movie with Christopher Walken.  But this Dead Zone is not really THAT Dead Zone...and that's okay.  Many of the events (particularly in the Pilot) are from King's version...but they are not building to the tragic ending of the book...they are used to setup the ONGOING story of Johnny Smith the ""Reluctant Psychic.""

In many ways, the show reminds me of X-FILES.  It deals with supernatural (or at least unusual) happenings, with most episodes pretty much serving as stand-alone stories.  Yet we also see the main characters evolve, and there is also an underlying ""Mythology"" of sorts that comes back from time to time.  The ongoing story is hardly as complex as X-FILES...but it does give the series an underlying feeling of dread.  I'm speaking the story line involving Smith and his relationship with an ultra-conservative church run by a minister who may or may not have Johnny's best interests in mind and a candidate for congress (Greg Stillson, also a character in King's book, but more fleshed out here).  Season 1 just begins to touch on the Stillson story, but Johnny and the minister (David Ogden Stiers) have a lot of business.

Anyway, there are lots of interpersonal dynamics that get played out during the course of the psychic visions Johnny has and feels compelled to act upon.  What I really like is that the show never got predicatable.  I would say EVERY episode had us saying...""Wow, that was a different spin"" or ""that was creative.""  The show never seems to coast or rest on any laurels.  (This continues at least through the end of Season 2 as well...that's as far as we've watched so far.)  The creativity is boundless.

Anthony Michael Hall plays Johnny, and while he is not an obvious choice for the role, he makes it his own.  His Johnny is quiet and just a touch unfriendly at times.  But he never shirks his responsibility, and he has a sly sense of humor which lightens his dark demeanor just enough.  Hall doesn't exactly give an Emmy-caliber performance...but he's solid and likeable and BELIEVABLE.  That's so important.

Everyone else in the cast is adequate.  The actor who plays Smith's therapist and friend Bruce is the best...with good energy and a light touch.  Johnny's former girlfriend (and mother of his child) Sarah tends to be a slightly annoying character and the actress playing her doesn't dig deep enough to show us the pain we should be seeing.  The actor playing Sarah's husband, Sheriff Walt Bannerman is sometimes not quite up to the emotional work he's asked to do...but he is very likeable and comes across convincingly as a solid, upright, trustworthy guy.  It makes me realize how we often don't see folks like this in TV shows.  He's also torn by jealousy over what Sarah and Johnny once had...but also realizes that Johnny deserves a part in the lives of his family and that Johnny has also helped make his job a lot easier.  He's Johnny's #1 advocate whenever the inevitable doubter comes in...first to stick up for the guy who is causing him a lot of emotional anguish.

Anyway, I hope you get the idea that this is a rich show.  Good, inventive stories and solid characters.  It's made for cable, so the special effects aren't flashy (and the show almost never pushes for more than it can do convincingly...that makes me so happy!).  For the most part, this is a family friendly show...except for one episode where Johnny has a particularly funny but mildly graphic one-night stand.  If you're letting younger kids watch...just read the episode descriptions beforehand, and you'll easily spot the one I'm talking about.

It's a good show, and quite simply, I highly recommend it.",1186012800,6,4057,4.753934191702432

1877118,4,B000092T3Y,"When the pilot for The Dead Zone television series was aired a few years ago, I remember watching a little bit of it and not being overly impressed.  Of course, I've seen the movie with Christopher Walken about twenty times, and it was difficult for me to imagine anyone else taking over the role of Johnny Smith.  Add to that the fact that Anthony Michael Hall was doing the lead, and you'll understand why I threw my hands up in the air in frustration, lamenting to myself on how TV screws up everything it touches by Stephen King.  I mean I still see Hall as the young, dorky teenager in The Breakfast Club.  Well, all I have to say is shame on me.  Anyway, I just purchased the pilot TV movie and the first four seasons of The Dead Zone.  I wanted to give Anthony Michael Hall and the show another chance, and I'm glad I did.  Though I had some problems with the pilot and the changes that had been made from the novel (for example, when Johnny wakes up from his coma, he discovers that Sarah is married to Sheriff Bannerman and that his mother is already dead and that she'd remarried while he was in a comma to the good Reverend Purdy, who's now Johnny's step-father and guardian), I still found myself enjoying it.  It took me a while to stop seeing Christopher Walken as Johnny and to accept Anthony Michael Hall in the role, but the important thing is that I did.  It's the episodes of the first season, however, that really grabbed me.  I gradually accepted the changes that had been made and got into the flow of the characters and what was happening to them.

Though this isn't evident in the description of the first season's boxed set, the TV pilot movie is included in this as the first two episodes.  If I'd known that, I wouldn't have purchased the pilot movie separately.  Now with regards to the other eleven episodes, some of them work better than others, but all of the shows are good.  There's one episode where a down-on-his-luck electrician decides to rob the local bank.  Sarah's cashing a check in the bank when the robbery goes down.  Johnny has a vision in which he sees everyone in the bank dying when the police try to take out the robber.  He decides to enter the bank and to see if he can change the outcome.  What made this particular episode so good was Stephen Miller, who plays the electrician.  He gives his character heart and soul, and before the show is over, you not only understand what's he going through, but you're also hoping that he won't be killed.  In another episode an elderly man (Arty) sees a young woman in New York City who looks just like his long-lost fianc (Abby), whom he never saw again after World War II.  The man begs Johnny to check it out, and in the visions that Johnny later has, he travels back to the beginning of the war and meets the woman that Arty was so in love with.  Elizabeth Ann Bennett plays Abby, and once you see her, you clearly understand why Arty loved her so much.  She's the type of woman that any man would fall in love with.  I guess you could say that she kind of stole my heart, too.  In still another episode, Johnny travels to what I can only describe as a parallel universe and sees what it would've been like if he'd never been in the car accident and had married Sarah.  It's almost heartbreaking because Johnny doesn't know which life is the real one.  There's one episode that I couldn't quite buy.  In it, Johnny and his friend, Bruce, stop in a small town to get something to eat.  A murder has just taken place the night before and a young girl is still missing.  There are satanic overtones to the murder.  When Johnny offers to help the police solve the case, the town's people begin think that he's the killer because of his psychic ability and want to literally burn him at the stake.  I had trouble with the premise of a town of supposedly rational people being manipulated into murdering someone by a few crazy individuals.  I will say that the final episode, which introduces Greg Stillson to the audience, accomplishes what it was meant to do.  It hooks you and then makes you want to immediately watch the second season.  That's why I took a big chance and got all four seasons at one time.  If I enjoyed season one, I didn't want to have to wait two-to-three weeks to get the next boxed set.

All in all, the majority of the episodes in season one are pretty good.  There's humor, suspense, and a lot of heart that makes you care about the individual characters.  The regulars who support Anthony Michael Hall all do an excellent job in their roles.  I've grown to like Nicole DeBoer, who plays Sarah.  I kept seeing Brooke Adams in the role from the original movie for a while.  Chris Bruno does a good job of playing Sheriff Bannerman, who's a person that is caught between the woman he loves and the man that she still loves, while growing to depend on Johnny for his help in solving many of the cases that come up.  John L. Adams, who plays Johnny's physical therapist and close friend, is also his sounding board and the origin for a lot of the humor that takes place in the series.  Last, but not least, is Kirsten Dalton, who plays the sultry redheaded newspaper reporter that's a threat to Sarah and her relationship with Johnny.  All the episodes have commentaries, and at the end of each disc, there's a behind-the-scenes featurette that deals with such things as the making of the show, its guest stars, and its visual effects and music.  If you're a Stephen King fan and haven't yet watched this television series, then you owe it to yourself to either buy, or rent, the first season and to check it out for yourself.  I think you'll find yourself hooked like I did.",1174953600,8,5688,4.419788664745437

Based on the Stephen King novel of the same name, the show gives continuity to Johnny Smith's life and surrounds him with the universe of a small town in Maine in which he is suddenly reintroduced to.  Johnny Smith's legacy began on the night he left a carnival that he attended with his fianc' Sarah.  On his way home he was in a horrific car accident that left him in a coma.  When Johnny Awakes from this coma years later, the life he knew has drastically changed.  He suddenly has the powers to see into the future and past of people through touching them or an object of theirs.

1877122,5,B000092T3Y,"The collapse of the Star Trek Television franchise left fans, like myself, looking for something new in Sci-fi. Where to turn, but logically to the exodus of writers and producers that were weined on that show and have now turned their creative talents to re-invigorating sci-fi television elsewhere. Ronald D. Moore went on to successfully re-create ""Battlestar Galactica"", Brannon Braga became the executive producer on the short-lived, but nonetheless thrilling, ""Threshold"", and Michael Piller, along with his son Shawn, adapted Stephen King's Dead Zone novel for television. My reason for ""getting into"" the Dead Zone is simply, Michael Piller, arguably the best Star Trek writer to come out of its television franchise. Included in the Dead Zone's first season are episodes written by Michael and Shawn Piller (formerly of Star Trek:The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager), as well as a few by Joe Menosky (also a former writer on Star Trek: The Next Generation), who serves as executive consultant on ""the Dead Zone"". Ironically, Dead Zone writer Michael Taylor is now penning episodes for Ronald D. Moore's ""Battlestar Galactica."" Check out Season Two for an episode by former Star Trek: DS9 writer Robert H. Wolfe.
If you were a fan of the later Star Trek series, you might want to check this show out. It has the suspense, drama, mystery and humanity that made me a loyal Trek fan for years. The Matrix-style visual effects are cutting edge/state of the art. As for the sci-fi element, there are no space battles, aliens, cool-looking robots, or space ships, but Johnny's ability to see into the past and future give him the perspective of a time traveler, while leaving him the human ability of only being able to change the future from the present.",1168560000,4,1767,5.034129692832765

The opening 2-part pilot episode is excellent, giving you insight into all the characters.  I think Anthony Michael Hall is an excellent actor and no more so then when he wakes up for the first time from his coma.  He looks and sounds so confused, plus he has his first vision which would scare the hell out of anyone.

What would it be like to be Johnny Smith?  At first you would think it would be cool but it must be scary knowing someone's future but also trying to tell them.  I think Anthony Michael Hall gives Johnny Smith not only humanity but integrity.  The episodes of the first series are all good and I enjoyed everyone.  My favourite's are the first two, especially when Johnny steps into the mind of the serial killer and becomes him.  He is really chilling and so believable.

""Dead Zone"", based on characters created by Stephen King, is a mix of drama, fantasy, action and comedy-although not all apsects are found in every episode.

""Dead Zone"" is about Johnny Smith, who, by appearances, has psychic powers through touch due to an accident-discovered when he awakens after being in a coma for 6 years.  Johnny is a 21st century hero.  He consistently tries to help people and change horrible ends, despite opposition by unbelievers and ignorance.  Anthony Michael Hall (well known for his role as the ""Geek"" in the movie, ""Sixteen Candles"") excels as Johnny Smith. Believe me, he is no longer a ""geek"".

""Dead Zone"" is a well written drama with incredible special effects.  The timing and flow create a non-stop thriller-which is addictive. I hope ""Dead Zone"" will be produced for many years to come.  I won't miss an episode.",1159401600,2,1051,4.826815642458101

1877128,5,B000092T3Y,"I can remember thinking, when I first heard that the popular King novel would be made into a series, man are these networks desperate to be mining something like this.  Given how many television shows like to play it safe as far as story lines go, I was also doubtful.  Thankfully my fears were drop-kicked into the trash can and I go to see this series on DVD!

  If you're reading this, you probably already know the premise:  guy gets psychic powers after car accident and can divine information about persons and future from touch.  The first season pretty much sticks to many of the episodes King laid out in his book, especially with serial killer Frank Dodd.

  Many of the episodes explore the temptation to play God, and the repercussions of being perceived a social freak the more the power is used.  My favorite episode was ""The Siege"", in my opinion right up there with any classic Outer Limits or Twilight Zone episode, where he is in the middle of a bank heist and can see a terrible future with every potential action about to be taken by the robber or the guard or the sherrif--truly mind blowing.  The other stand-out episode was ""Destiny"", where we meet Greg Stillson, sleazebag extraordinaire and see his rise to power.  DVD extras include interviews with pretty much every person involved with the show, from actors, two guest actors, the producers, directors and even the music guy.",1141862400,5,1403,4.700819672131147

Basis of the story: Johnny is at the peak of his life, with a decent job and a fiancee with a baby on the way, and then suddenly he has an accident and slips into a coma.  Years later he wakes up and he's lost his fiancee to another man, along with his son who doesn't know who he is.

There's another catch - Johnny wakes up with a hyperactive `dead zone'.  The `dead zone' is the part of his brain that allows him to see and live things that other people can't see - the past, the present and the future.  Together Johnny and his physiotherapist use these powers to help and save those who can't help themselves, and to search for justice and save the world by changing fate - queue the tissues!

Quick hint - for those of you who can't remember who Johnny is, remember the blonde geeky guy from The Breakfast Club and Sixteen Candles - yep, that's him!!!",1135555200,2,1042,4.395833333333333

He discovers he has powers when he touches a nurses arm and sees her daughter trapped in a house on fire. When he gets out he trys to move on and have a normal life but is hard when he gets a vision each time he touches something or someone.

  He sees things that are either happening at the time or didn't happen yet. Only he can stop them from happening. The movie from the 80's was great but the show goes beyond that. The movie easily could've had sequels since Christopher Walken was so good. Well that is if the movie didn't end how it did. The tv series shows how much further they could go with the idea and it's done well. Like when John wants to have sex but sees everyone that both he and she had sex with in bed with them.  Is both clever and funny. Anthony Michael Hall wouldn't have gone through my head if I was casting John Smith. However he handles the part excellent.

1877135,4,B000092T3Y,"Firstly, I should point out that I am a huge fan of the show, and if I was rating the content alone, this would be a five star review, no question.

I found myself rather disappointed when I openned the box to discover, as other reviewers have noted, an empty disc slot. Should you be considering purchasing this product, please be aware that the Pilot referred to elsewhere on these pages and in the packaging is the original, unaired pilot. All aired episodes from season one, including Wheel of Life and What It Seems (where Jonny gets into the crash and goes into the coma) ARE included. The major difference with pilots is that Gene Purdy is played by (I'm informed)Michael Moriarty.

This should not have been a problem, as other reviewers have noted that there is a mail-in rebate card which will get you the pilot DVD. Sadly, this offer expired in 2003 and the 'bounceback' card is no longer available with newly shipped boxsets.

My second gripe is relatively minor...no slip case was provided (ever, apparently) with this product, so it's best to keep it firmly sandwiched between other stuff on your shelves.",1118275200,9,1119,4.728205128205128
1877136,4,B000092T3Y,"I came late to this TV show. It premiered when I had too many distractions to allow me to sit down and actually watch it. Thank God for DVD. ""The Dead Zone"" shows stylistic flair and has strong writing throughout much of its first season. The basic premise remains from King's novel and David Cronenberg's film; Johnny (Anthony Michael Hall) a school teacher who seemingly has everything going for him is in a car accident. He's in a coma for six years. While he's away his love (the lovely Nicole deBoer from ""Deep Space Nine"")has married someone else, his mother has died and he has the ability to foresee the potential future (and the past). The departures from the source that Michael and Shawn Piller (""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" and ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"") introduce add depth and conflict to the show. When Johnny's mom dies, Reverend Purdy (David Ogden Stiers)becomes the benefactor of the will and guardian of Johnny. Johnny doesn't trust Purdy believing his intention was to soak his mom for all the money he could. Johnny comes out of his coma with his gift stronger than before. He had it in childhood and throughout much of his life but it was never more than a parlor trick. Now it's front and center in his life.

The pilot episode is still among the best but there's also a handful of the 13 episodes here that rank right up there. ""Destiny"" and ""The Seige"" both are among the best episodes of the first season as well. Lion's Gate has done a exceptional job with the DVD transfer. The colors are bright, vivid and there's hardly a trace of digital or analog imperfections that might mar the picture. The sound, likewise, is top flight. The extras include commentaries on every episode, a terrific featurette where we are privy to the writer's meetings and interviews with the cast and main production crew about the series and the departures from King's source material. It's pretty clear that the Pillers are trying to stay true to the spirit of King's work even if they can't practice fidelity to the novel itself through out the series.

My only complaint--and this has been echoed a number of times--is that Lion's Gate is still selling the DVD set with a missing DVD that you were supposed to be able to sent away for. Like many fans, I purchased the set quite a bit later but my set was manufactured recently (or at least was in the warehouse). Not having the unaired pilot episode is annoying. After Lion's Gate discontinued the offer to main out the extra disc they should have automatically included it or redesigned the packaging so it doesn't make reference to it. You don't miss it until you realize it's not there.

That minor flaw aside, ""The Dead Zone"" is a noteworthy show worth watching.",1114473600,40,2732,4.6521739130434785
1877137,5,B000092T3Y,"I took a risk and purchased this dvd boxset having never before seen even a single episode, but WOW how it paid off! This is television at its best- every episode is completely gripping and looks as though it has a budget comparable to that of a movie (i.e. with matrix style camera tricks).

While the concept of a central character with a paranormal advantage over others isn't much of a blindingly-original a theme, this is very much above the average. Though the key to its success, despite its many original qualities has to be the central performance by Antony Michael Hall- he's just perfectly cast as Jonny Smith, a guy who manipulates events in the present to avert disaster in the future for himself, his loved ones and complete strangers using the part of his brain aptly named 'the Dead Zone'.

The first 3 episodes are fantastic and while the season never quite lives up to this brilliant introduction, it does take us places we never expect with great writing and beautiful performances. My favourite episode is 'Shaman' (reminded me of a star trek: next gen. episode, but actually surpasses that in every way), 'Dinner with Dana' is the episode where very little happens action-wise, but which somehow manages to be effortlessly engaging, and 'Enemy Mind' would be the poorest because it's a little predictable (which is something you can very rarely say with the Dead Zone).

I viewed each episode carefully - for entertainment value, hokey-alerts, and characters.  The hokey meter never went off.  I was reasonably captivated for all the episodes.  Characters - well, first seasons usually leave a lot of room to grow their characters in the hopes that there will be second seasons - these characters were above average.

1877139,5,B000092T3Y,"Since discovering Netflix I have been trying to catch up on a number of TV shows that I had previously missed for one reason or another. The Dead Zone is one of the first of these and, quite frankly, it blew me away.

 I've been a fan of Stephen King for some time. I thought that the original novel and film were both excellent, so I was worried about what they would do to the concept with the new series. After the first couple episodes, my worries evaporated. They have treated the source material with respect, and I wonder whether King has seen the series (and how often he's slapped his forehead, wishing he'd written things this way from the beginning).

 My biggest concern was the addition of three new characters. Bruce - Johnny's black, dreadlocked physical therapist and confidante; Dana - the standard feisty redhead reporter with a minor Johnny obsession; and Reverend Purdy - a televangelist who's foundation has control over Johnny's mother's estate. Any of these characters could have turned into stereotypes or caricatures. So far, however, they have mostly avoided this pitfall.

 My main love of the series, though, is that they do an excellent job of showing what the life of someone with these abilities might actually be like. Episodes have dealt with the problems with intimacy, the Cassandra factor of getting anyone to believe dire warnings, the trouble of interpreting the visions, what happens when you see something too big for you to do anything about, or too big for your brain to deal with, etc.

 Some of the episodes aren't quite as good as others, but they are all far better than most of what is shown on television, and the finale will knock your socks off. This set has skyrocketed to the top of my ""must buy"" list.",1090540800,5,1754,4.709150326797386

Unfortunately, Johnny gets into a near fatal car accident that puts him into a coma for 6 years. When Johnny wakes up 6 years after the accident, his life goes through some major changes. The first is that Sarah has moved on with her life and is married to a man named Walt( Chris Bruno)who is the town sheriff. To make matters worse, Sarah was pregnant with Johnny's son that has been raised by Walt, and his son has no idea who Johnny really is. The second and most important change, is that the accident awakened a part of the brain, which is refered to as the ""Dead Zone"" which allows Johnny to receive visions from the past and the future whenever he touches someone or a physical object related to a particular person. Now as Johnny attempts to begin a new life, he must adjust to his abilities and use them to help those in need.
Up until very recently, I was extremely skeptical about this show for two different reasons. The first and most obvious reason was because Anthony Michael Hall played the lead character. Most people including myself have only seen Anthony play nerdy characters in John Hughes movies, and other roles in unknown ""B"" films. The second reason why I was always skeptical, was because I figured that there was no way that a weekly television show could be made dealing with the characters from Stephen King's book and the film, because it is a story that is pretty specific and hard to stretch out. However, since the show has received very positive reviews, I decided to put my skepticism aside and give the first season a try.
After recently finishing the first season on this DVD set, all I can say is that I was seriously impressed and literally blown away at how good this show turned out to be. Anthony Michael Hall shows that he is actually a very decent actor and does a wonderful job as Johnny Smith. He makes the character extremely believeable and easy to connect with. The show also features a great mix of romance, drama, and suspense with all of the visions that Johnny receives. You also get wrapped up in watching Johnny trying to adjust to his new life and dealing with the fact that the woman he loves is married to someone else. The reason I could only give the first season of ""The Dead Zone"" four stars however, is because there were a few episodes that were rather boring and slow moving. But, at least 10 out of the 13 episodes are fantastic. The DVD set overall offers some pretty cool extras as well like interviews with guest stars, a preview of season 2, commentary, etc.. All I can say is that I am definately a fan of this show now, and I plan on purchasing the season 2 DVD set as soon as June 8th arrives.

1877149,5,B000092T3Y,"I cannot figure out why this show is not a bigger hit.  It's fantastic.
Anthony Michael Hall, (now looking eerily like Steve McQueen instead of Farmer Ted) plays Johnny Smith, a young man who loses six years of his life to a coma after a car crash.
He wakes up to find that his mother is dead, his fiancee is  married to another man (who Johnny's son thinks is his father), and that his brain has created a new path to consciousness, leading his thoughts through what his neurologist describes as ""the dead zone"".  This new path gives him psychic visions, of the past, the future, and the present.
This could have been a very episodic show...mystery happens, Johnny has vision that solves it, blah blah blah.  Instead, the writers and producers give us a fascinating drama, where Johnny and his ex-finacee try to sort out their feelings for each other, where Johnny is alone in a world that not only doesn't have a place for him, but doesn't trust him.
There are not always happy endings.  Most of the episodes are bittersweet, at best.  But watching Anthony Michael Hall and an excellent supporting cast try to deal with the fallout from Johnny's tragedy and unwanted notoriety makes this one of the most compelling dramas you'll see.
Throw in David Ogden Stiers as the ""is he good or bad"" Reverend Purdy, and Sean Patrick Flanery as the ""definitely bad but will the world know in time"" Greg Stillson, and you have enough intrigue to keep you going episode after episode.
Especially if you are a fan of shows that deal in some way with the occult, like Buffy r Angel, you'll love this one!

1877151,5,B000092T3Y,"Of all of Stephen King's novels ""The Dead Zone"" is probably the one has the strongest potential for being turned into a television series, mainly on the strength of the character of Johnny Smith.  Many years after being adapted into a theatrical film, in which I thought Christopher Walken was miscast as Johnny, we have a television series based on King's novel, starring Anthony Michael Hall, that finally gives us something to replace ""Quantum Leap"" and ""Morning Edition"" among cult television fans.
Created by the father and son team of Michael and Shawn Piller, there are several significant changes and additions to ""The Dead Zone"" premise: (1) The night of his accident Johnny and his fiance  Sara (Nicole de Boer) conceived a child, so when Johnny comes out of his coma this time, he learns more shocking news than Sara being married.  (2) Sara is now married to Sheriff Walt Bannerman (Chris Buno), another character from the original novel, who is now given a more prominent role.  (3) Johnny now has a sidekick in Bruce Lewis (John L. Adams), who starts off as his physical therapist and becomes a confidant, true-believer, and good friend.  (4) In this version Johnny's father died when he was young and his mother (Anna Hagen), now a wealthy woman, died while he was in the coma.  The bulk of her state has gone to the Reverend Gene Purdy (David Ogden Stiers), who has used it to fund his religious organization.  This plays off of Vera Smith's fundamentalist beliefs in the novel, but gives the whole idea of the spiritual significance of Johnny's ""gift"" to the Reverend.  (5) The other key supporting character is reporter Dana Bright (Kristen Dalton), who not only becomes a true believer but is interested in Johnny romantically as well.  Consequently, Johnny has a much stronger support group in the television series.  Once Sheriff Bannerman becomes a true believer that helps to eliminate the tired element of Johnny having to convince skeptics he is not a lunatic.  (6) Finally, Greg Stillson (Sean Patrick Flanery), Johnny's ultimate antagonist in the novel, does not pop up until the 13th and final episode of the first season, setting up what will be the main conflict of season two.
If there is a fundamental flaw to the series it is that it is pretty much impossible to come up with a ""normal"" episode for the series.  ""Quality of Life"" would be one such episode, where Johnny takes a job as an assistant hockey coach, touches a kid, and knows that he is going to drop dead on the ice if he keeps playing.  Of course, nobody wants to believe him.  Fortunately ""The Dead Zone"" is one of those relatively new fangled series like ""The Sopranos"" and ""Six Feet Under"" where a full season is a dozen episodes, so that the series is not overwhelmed by more and more tales stretching the limits of Johnny's power (e.g., ""Shaman"").
The best episode of the first season is ""The Siege,"" where Sara is caught in a bank robbery and Johnny joins the hostages in an effort to figure out the shifting jigsaw puzzle and come up with an ending where everybody gets out alive.  This one does a nice job of exploring the consequences of various actions.  ""Here There Be Monsters,"" where Johnny ends up being charged with practicing witchcraft when he tries to help another sheriff's office solve a murder.  The twist here is that Johnny is in danger because people DO believe he can do what he claims.  ""Unreasonable Doubt"" is clearly inspired by ""Twelve Angry Men,"" but also does a nice job of exploring how Johnny can convince people of the validity of his visions.  Stylistically the television series takes the idea from the original film version of putting Johnny into his visions as a spectator and give it some ""Matrix"" like effects: often a scene freezes and Johnny is able to walk through it to see what needs to be seen.  The show also shows a pretty good sense of humor at times, as in ""Dinner with Dana,"" where physical contact brings into the bedroom their previous lovers.  At the core of the series is Hall's performance, and while I think his characterization is significantly different from the novel in that Johnny is no longer a tortured Hamlet of doubt, I also think that such a main character would not work for a television series.  Instead Hall's Johnny Smith is reserved but still willing to do what has to be done, no doubt helped by the strong support group he has in this series.
The season finale, ""Destiny,"" introduces candidate Stillson and returns the series to the last remaining element of the novel.  This is a Stillson who is aware of Johnny's abilities, which will make quite a difference in the second season, and who is affiliated with the Reverend Purdy.  It was nice to see the series go back to Cathy's episode from the novel, but there was one significant goof: Walt joins Johnny in trying to convince the owner of the restaurant to close down, and while they are unsuccessful, there is no way in the world that Walt does not somebody there watching the place (although given how quickly firetrucks seem to be there we might be missing something).  This final episode also gets back to the heart of the novel, with Purdy explicitly talking about how Johnny is clearly destined to do something important, and that each of these episodes is just another link in the chain towards that greater glory.  For a first season, often the most problematic in the history of a series, ""The Dead Zone"" is pretty good.  More importantly, the show successfully builds on this solid foundation in the second season.",1075420800,21,5548,4.728215767634855
1877152,5,B000092T3Y,"There seems to be some confusion about the Pilot. While it IS the same story that eventually aired as the first two episodes there are some significant differences. Foremost is that the Reverend is played by Michael Morriarty. There are also some other differences in the cast. What you see here (along with some deleted scenes) is the original pilot. After it was filmed, they changed some of the cast and refilmed any scenes with the old cast. Also, some of the other scenes were refilmed by the new director since he did not like the staging of the old version of these scenes (as explained by the Voice-Over Commentary on the Show and the Deleted Scenes).
Thus while the episode 1&2 and this Pilot is essentially the same story, you get alternate casting and interpretation.
I hope this helps other to decide if they want to buy the DVD - You WILL get something you have not yet seen (even if it is not a DIFFERENT Story).",1074297600,8,926,4.517857142857143

Now for the title explanation.  I was pleasantly surprised to see the bounceback card in with the first season.  Not because of the unaired pilot (which if you bough it when they released the pilot alone on dvd you already have) but because they offered the Sountrack to the show.  I jumped at this because of the amazing Jeff Buckley song New Years Prayer.  Now don't expect to get it right away... it took me about three months to get mine but now that I have it I can't complain.  It seems to fit the show perfectly.  It's a very nice combination of songs, all of them good, some of them even beautiful.",1062979200,4,941,4.306818181818182
1877155,5,B000092T3Y,"I'm a huge fan of the Dead Zone and tape every episode and will buy the 2nd season if and when it comes out on DVD.  BUT DO NOT BE FOOLED ABOUT THE ""UNAIRED ORIGINAL PILOT EPISODE"" that you can get with the bounce back coupon ($$$ for shipping).  It was aired on TV and is the very first episode on the first DVD called ""Wheel of Fortune"".  I ordered it and got it in the mail today and was looking forward to seeing an episode that I had never seen before.  WRONG! I was very disappointed when I found that it was the ""Wheel of Fortune"" on the DVD compliation that I already bought. So, don't waste your money on the allegedly unaired original pilot episode--because if you bought the Complete First Season of the Dead Zone, you already have it.",1062460800,76,746,4.232394366197183
1877156,5,B000092T3Y,"A friend of mine recently lent me the complete first season of the dead zone.  I had never heard of it, and wasn't particularly excited about it.  When I finally saw it I was completely blown away.  Why is it that the best shows on tv are always the best kept secrets?  I'm bucking the trend and telling everyone I know about this fantastic program.  The third season will air in 2004 and hopefully the fan base will continue to grow.  If you're thinking about buying the dvd don't hesitate, it's worth every penny.",1062460800,6,515,4.425531914893617
1877157,4,B000092T3Y,"I absolutely love the show and even pre-ordered the Season 1 set.  Amazon.com shipped it to me right on time.  I couldn't wait to see the TV Pilot Episode and ordered it right away.  However, I have to agree with Joe that the unaired pilot episode should have been included with the set because I'm still waiting for mine to arrive from Lions Gate Films!  My check cleared my bank on July 9th, so I know they have my money.  I even e-mailed a few weeks ago asking Lions Gate to check on my order but have never gotten a response or my DVD.",1061596800,6,539,4.144230769230769

7988768,4,B000092T3Y,"This series did an interesting job of extending the possibilities of Stephen King's original novel.  Episode 5, for example, has Johnny Smith on jury duty, judging the guilt or innocence of a young man accused of murdering a convenience store clerk.  The episode borrows heavily from the play and movie ""Twelve Angry Men"", but used Johnny's psychic abilities to drive the process of discovery and the discussion within the jury room.  The jurors still have to make up their own minds, and the episode is honest enough not to let Johnny solve it on his own.  Recommended as decent entertainment.",1515369600,,594,4.91
