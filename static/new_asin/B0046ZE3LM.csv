I tried classical stretch ,that did not work. I have also went to the chiroprater since. I have only been once but I am alot better!!",1348012800,,299,4.067796610169491
4271210,5,B0046ZE3LM,"I've been struggling with some minor back and hip pain for the past year...desk bound jobs will get ya.  The excercises on this DVD have been an excellent method to losen up the tightness and relieve stress.  Practicing this consistenly 3-4 times a week has really helped with both posture and minor back pain relief.  I have practiced yoga before, so the poses are familiar to me, however, I don't think this would be above someone just starting out with yoga.  Annie Carpenter is an excellent instructor and modifications are shown...there are two contributors on the DVD, one does the more advanced poses and one does the modified versions for beginners.  Annie is fantastic at instructing for form and alignment.  There are two workouts included, one for upper back and one for lower back.  Each is 45 minutes, and fine on their own, or if you have time, you can do them back to back.  You do need a yoga block (or two) and strap, or items from around the house that can stand in for the props (books, small ball for blocks and a towel for strap), unless you are VERY flexible and can do the poses without props.",1325894400,5,1116,4.545

4271213,3,B0046ZE3LM,"NOTE:  I received a free copy of this DVD from Yoga Journal to review.

This new DVD release from Yoga Journal features yoga instructor Annie Carpenter, who states in her included 6-minute interview that she teaches what she calls ""Smart Flow"" yoga.  Carpenter teaches live in a large, airy studio, where she leads two models (yoga teachers themselves) through the two 45-minute practices on this DVD.  (Carpenter herself does not participate in the practices; this style of teaching is very similar to what is seen on the Stott Pilates DVDs, and in fact Carpenter's entire demeanor reminded me significantly of Moira Stott.)  The Main Menu of the DVD offers the following options:  Lower Body (45 minutes), Upper Body, Neck, & Shoulders (45 minutes), Interviews (with Teacher and Models), and Play All (Sequences 1 and 2).

In introducing each of the two practices, Carpenter explains that she will be offering postures focused on both stretching and strengthening to help undo the effects poor posture, misalignments, etc. and to serve a preventative function for the future.  You will need a mat, strap, two blocks, and a blanket for these practices.

For the Lower Body practice, Carpenter has the participants start on their backs in a half savasana position.  She spends some time focusing on the breath, combining this with establishing a natural arch in the lower back.  She encourages you to continue to maintain this arch as you use a strap for reclined leg stretch.  While still on their backs, she then has the participants perform a more challenging abs-strengthening move, holding one leg straight up while the other hovers just off the floor.  Then it's on to hands and knees for a single cat/cow and a few repetitions of bird/dog before moving through down dog, coming to standing, and beginning lunge salutes.  (During the lunge series, Carpenter makes an error and repeats the twisted lunge an extra time to the one side only.)  The final standing sequence is a wide-legged forward bend performed with blocks under the hands, adding a twist.  Coming back to a supine position, Carpenter has the models place a block between their thighs for bridge pose, adding a one-legged bridge.  There are two lying twists before Carpenter concludes the practice with a short (2-minute) savasana.

For the Upper Body practice, Carpenter again has the models begin in half savasana.  From this position, they perform neck rolls (first with the arms by the sides, then spread out in a ""T"") as well as an arm stretch with the block in the hands and moving the arms overhead.  Next, several rounds of cat/cow are performed on hands and knees.  From here, Carpenter transitions the models through down dog to standing at the front of the mat, where she leads them through sun breaths, emphasizing the stretch in the arms.  Two standing postures follow.  The first is Warrior 2:  Carpenter sets up the pose, then has the participants repeat, adding in a neck stretch.  The second standing posture is extended side angle; here, Carpenter instructs a little vinyasa in which the models repeatedly come in and out of this pose.  After moving through down dog and plank to return to the floor, side plank is performed with an optional modification.  Then, Carpenter has the participants come prone for several locust variations.  Carpenter closes with seated postures, including cow-face arms (using a strap), eagle arms, and a simple seated twist; she ends with a 1 1/2 minute savasana.

Both of these practices were decent overall, but they did not provide the soothing, tension-relieving function that I had expected.  On the one hand, I could see how regular use of these practices could be beneficial in maintaining a healthy back.  On the other, however, I did not feel significantly stretched in the target areas (i.e., upper back and lower back), and I'm not sure that users who are already experiencing difficulties (including tension and/or pain) would be likely to find relief here.  In fact, I have chronic upper back and shoulder tightness myself, and I did not achieve nearly the same relaxation results with this video as I have had with other yoga DVDs targeted to this area (e.g.,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-to-the-Rescue-for-Neck-Shoulders/dp/B0021R52IU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga to the Rescue for Neck & Shoulders</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-Relief-from-Neck-and-Shoulder-Pain/dp/B000RLUMDW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga: Relief from Neck and Shoulder Pain</a>).

Still, I would have recommended this DVD for ongoing prevention purposes if it were not for one major problem:  the music.  I have to agree with the first reviewer on this one; the flute music is WAY too loud.  Although I didn't have any problems hearing Carpenter's instruction, the music was as loud as her voice, which I found to be a distraction--and, over time, an annoyance.  I rarely take issue with the music on fitness DVDs, but it was SUCH an irritation here that it affected by overall view of the practices, which is a shame.",1297468800,20,5141,5.279212792127922
4271214,5,B0046ZE3LM,"As a new yoga instructor, I am always looking for yoga DVD's and books to inspire and teach me new ways to share yoga with my students.  Yoga for Total Back Care did not disappoint me.  I have dealt with upper back and neck pain on an on-going basis for the past several years and have used yoga to help me keep my aches and pains under control.  I like the idea that this DVD focuses solely on total back care.  I specifically liked Annie Carpenter's style and instruction.  I could tell that she really knew what she was teaching which makes a huge difference in the quality of the product and workout.  I do hope she makes other yoga DVD'S in the future.

I enjoyed the pace and feel both relaxed and challenged by this DVD which I find is sometimes a difficult combination to create with yoga.  I also enjoyed the background music as it added to my focus and relaxation seeming subtle to me.  The DVD has two segments, each are 45 minutes.  There is one for the upper back, neck and shoulders and also one for the low back.  You can do them together or do each one as your schedule permits. I personally have been switching between the two for time purposes but I am partial to the upper back series simply because that's where I need it the most.  I would definitely recommend this DVD to my students or anyone with or without back issues.",1294876800,18,1344,4.3107569721115535
4271215,3,B0046ZE3LM,I liked the workout but the pan-flute music was disconcerting and too loud at times to hear the voice of Annie Carpenter.  I like some soothing background music for my home practice but this music was so inconsistent in the volume that I wanted a way to turn it off so that I could enjoy the asanas and the voice.,1294444800,13,313,4.216666666666667
8417538,5,B0046ZE3LM,"This DVD has been amazing for helping me with chronic back and neck issues. I can't speak highly enough about it.  If you struggle with any neck, shoulder or back pain, get this. If you want to help keep these areas healthy; get this. I've probably played this more than most of my other yoga DVDs (and I have a lot of them).",1478131200,,325,4.158730158730159
8417539,5,B0046ZE3LM,I got this DVD specifically for upper back/neck so  I haven't done the lower back routine yet. I have issues with my upper left shoulder blade/spine area- tingling/ burning and just soreness and I regularly go to  a chiropractor every 3-4 weeks for adjustments however lately doesn't seem to help my problem. I am the type of person who feels if you didn't do cardio you've wasted your time so I put off doing this DVD for awhile-now I wish I hadn't. Annie gives great instruction throughout DVD so you don't have to look at tv too much- background music is soothing as if I am in a spa. Some of the poses are challenging- Warrior and plank poses- prob weak in the upper back also causing my issues. At the end of the 45 min routine I feel relaxed/ stretched/ no pain in my upper back.  I cont to put off the dvd each week- its hard to not want to do the cardio dvds I have instead of 'wasting my time' with yoga dvd but hopefully I'll start getting rid of that mantra soon. I would say even if you can't do the warrior/plank poses there are still many great poses that will help you stretch that feel great! Highly recommend!,1439683200,,1126,4.276995305164319

8417545,3,B0046ZE3LM,"This is not a beginner yoga class. I would say it varies between intermediate and advanced. It is also what I would consider power yoga. It's not that the poses are difficult. No headstands or anything like that, but you hold the position for what seems to me to be a long time. Longer than most yoga classes. This is not as much therapeutic as it is strengthening. It made me sweat and raised my heartbeat. The sequence of warrior 2 positions was very challenging.

This is a good workout. Not an easy workout. It is meant to be done all at once, 90 minutes, although they have broken it into two sections of 45 minutes each. The second part is somewhat less challenging than the first part.
How does my back feel? I had some back pain when I began the workout. Now it is sore in a different way. Like when I have overworked it. I guess I need some conditioning and back strength.

 I don't think this video is something I would do if I needed therapy. This one is definitely good for conditioning. Rodney Yee's Back Care, or ""Back In Shape"" with Mimi Solaire  or the Gary Kraftsow videos are all good for therapeutic yoga. They help ease back pain without being too long or too demanding.",1395878400,2,1190,4.3710407239819

After reviewing a TON of yoga back and neck videos I own 3, and this is one of them plus Lillah Schwartz's, Rodney Yee/Yoga Journal's Yoga for Back care (which requires a bit more focus and strength). They make a good troika that'll take you in and out of good 'back' days and not-so-good ones.",1389398400,,478,4.635294117647059
