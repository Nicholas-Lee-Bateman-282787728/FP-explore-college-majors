8239377,5,B0010Y9Q3C,A really fine Laugh-in montage of some of the funniest moments in this series.  Love the cameo appearances by Sinatra and William F. Buckley in particular.  They could have issued a volume 2 because there were so many funny sketches week after week.,1525219200,,249,4.767441860465116

8239379,4,B0010Y9Q3C,"I loved the show as a kid, and I wanted my own purchased copy of Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In's 25th Anniversary Special since it aired on NBC in 1993; I taped the original airing on videocassette, but it was plagued by poor reception (no cable in a rural area).

The single disc DVD has its pros and cons. First, the cons:

I expected the same exact program as the original airing, but there are differences. Some skits were changed and/or moved around; for example, a segment on jokes about smoking was replaced with one on cars. There's three segments of quickies instead of two (adding a set where Sonny and Cher sing an intro).  The DVD also adds an Uncle Al (Alan Seus) skit not on the original airing. A few segments featuring JoAnne Worley's singing (including the ""Down and Out"" song) and the best laughing song of Ruth Buzzi were taken out. Also omitted was a very funny plate ""juggling"" act by comedian Paul Gilbert (pronounced zheel-bear), the father of ""Little House on the Prairie"" actress Melissa Gilbert.

One glaring omission from the original airing: a ""Here Come the Judge"" skit, but there are a couple of appearances of Sammy Davis Jr. donning the gown and wig.

Finally, the liner notes mentioning the reunion's press conference are inaccurate. Short segments from the conference are scattered throughout the program, and there are some fond memories shared by some of the cast members, but not every subject written in the liner notes is addressed.

Now the pros:

There's the cast's song-and-dance tribute to Vaudeville (though not the full bit). Three hilarious Gladys and Tyrone sketches are present, including the now-classic ""Hereafter"" bit. The ""Laugh-In News"" compilation includes two ""News of the Future"" reports that actually came true. The ""Laugh-In Looks at War & Peace"" segment features a rare serious sketch set to Frank Sinatra's song ""It Was A Very Good Year"".

There's also a ""Flying Fickle Finger of Fate"" compilation, Tiny Tim singing ""Tiptoe Through The Tulips"", and Judy Carne and Arte Johnson singing ""Coo Coo Laugh-In World."" Lily Tomlin is also featured, performing as Ernestine the Telephone Operator, Edith Ann, and the Tasteful Lady. Other Laugh-In staples included are the Fabulous Farkel Family, Robot Theater, Sock-It-To-Me, poetry by Henry Gibson, Arte Johnson's German soldier Wolfgang (""Verrry interesting!"") and the Joke Wall.

In addition, Hollywood legends such as Jack Benny, Milton Berle, Orson Welles, Kirk Douglas, and John Wayne are here, along with appearances by William Buckley, Dr. Joyce Brothers, and Richard Nixon (""Sock it to me?"").

The four-star rating is a reflection on its classic content and is a good intro to those not familiar with the series. This disc is the closest thing to a compilation release (unlike the two ""Best Of"" releases reviewed elsewhere), but someone out there (Rhino, Guthy-Renker) should give this classic variety show a fully comprehensive compilation box set, if not a full box set per season.",1370822400,14,2989,5.056910569105691
