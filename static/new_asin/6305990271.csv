1106595,4,6305990271,"As I've been trying to collect some classic serials, I've been frustrated by the lack of specific information on the various editions. So let me first say that while the print is far from pristine, for the price this VCI edition is hard to beat.
Second, let me say that I am astonished--to the point of feeling like my 10-year old self was had--how much of ""Star Wars"" Lucas lifted almost whole-cloth from this serial. Even the prologue as a steeply pitched crawl comes from Buck Rogers, not to mention countless scenes in the Millennium Falcon as the ship is chased by an evil-empire-like force of villains.
So here's the advice I would have been happiest to have had a few days ago when I was trying to decide whether to buy this disc: if you love science fiction on film, or are interested in the popular culture of the late 30's and early 40's, BUY THIS DISC.",1086220800,54,863,4.468354430379747

1106597,4,6305990271,"Buck Rogers was the earlier space hero, first appearing in two featured novellas in Hugo Gernsbach's AMAZING STORIES, the earliest science-fiction pulp magazine.  Then of course, he became a comic strip hero who was quite popular until the FLASH GORDON comic strip with superior illustrative art started competing.
Universal did well with Buck, though the serial didn't have the appeal of the Flash Gordon serials.  It's not as imaginative, but it is a good action serial.  Buster Crabbe shows a little of the calmer nature of the hero, compared to Flash Gordon's impetuousness.
If you don't have any of them, get especially FLASH GORDON: SPACE SOLDIERS and FLASH GORDON CONQUERS THE UNIVERSE first, but then be sure to get BUCK ROGERS.",1040601600,7,736,5.066115702479339
1106598,5,6305990271,"The 12 chapter BUCK ROGERS serial, was shot between the Flash Gordon serials ""Flash Gordon's Trip To Mars"" and ""Flash Gordon Conquers The Universe."" Audiences seemed indifferent to it, so the plans for a sequel were scrapped in favor of continuing the Flash Gordon series. While the Flash Gordon serials are probably better, I really enjoy the Buck Rogers serial too.
Buck Rogers has STYLE. Not to say that Flash didn't, but the Buck Rogers serial has:
The Art Deco Headquarters of Killer Kane, with it's convenient topiary shrubs for hiding behind.
The swirling mirror pool monitor screens.
The equally Art Deco space ships, with sparklers as exhaust and that sound, something like a microwave oven and a car missing a muffler. These ships were so advanced, all they needed was a simple door with handle.
A future full of wimps. Flash and Buddy easily push away or tackle anyone who they clash with.
The groovy De-Gravity belts and the transporter.
The Saturnian tram system.
The exotic terrain of the planet Saturn, which in no way looked like a California desert.
The Saturnian MUGGS, who should have all been nominated for academy awards.
Okay, I'm being a little sarcastic. But I really do have a great love for this serial, even with all its many flaws. Terrible performances by some of the supporting characters, a few cases of severely bad stunt doubling, and the effects, well......they did their best with what they had to work with. I love the little dolls in the Saturnian tunnel trams.
And Buck himself--Larry ""Buster"" Crabbe was so handsome. That wavy hair and that killer smile were all he needed. I wonder if the producers ever realized what kind of confusion they would cause in the years that followed, by casting the same actor for both Flash and Buck. It's always interesting to see a VHS version of Buck Rogers with a picture from Flash Gordon on the cover, and vice versa.
Buck Rogers is a true pleasure to watch. It's so much fun, and it's the perfect length. It's over before it has worn out its welcome. And if you want more, then watch the next chapter. The menu screens are fun too, with the ships swinging around on visible wires. If only they would have included a booklet instead of advertising.
This is well worth checking out, especially if you enjoy the Flash serials. Like the cover proclaims, it's a 12 chapter Thrill-O-Rama!",1032652800,90,2360,4.758536585365854
1106599,5,6305990271,"This takes me back to Saturday mornings as a ten year old, in the early 80's, when I first remember seeing Larry'Buster'Crabbe as Flash Gordon/Buck Rogers on the BBC.
So the wooden actors made local amateur dramatics look professional and the space ships looked like something made on Blue Peter, but it didn't matter because 'Buster' Crabbe WAS a Superhero.
Who cares about comparisons of productions and making analysis between Buck & Flash, they weren't meant for that, they're just pure fun and were made to be watched and enjoyed.
So anyone who saw these and enjoyed them, buy the DVDs, you'll be ten all over again.",996105600,17,621,4.813084112149533
1106600,4,6305990271,"While not as well known (and to be honest, not quite as good) as Flash Gordon there is much to like about Buck Rogers, especially the Art Deco sets.  Add this to your collection along with Metropolis and Things To Come and you've pretty much covered the Art Deco/Science Fiction connection that began in the 1930s and continues to this day.

One person who obviously liked Buck Rogers was George Lucas.  The story line and visuals of Buck Rogers and Star Wars are so similar its almost copyright infringement.",970272000,2,509,4.696629213483146
1106601,4,6305990271,"Although not as good as Flash Gordon series which also starred Buster Crabbe this is still an enjoyable SCI-Fi classic. Long before Star Trek and Starwars were Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon. I used to enjoy each episode  back in the 50's when I was alot younger. There was only one Buck Rogers  serial made and it followed the success of the first two Flash Gordon  serials. Buck Rogers never had the popularity Flash Gordon, probably  because it was an imitation. The charectors were never developed as well.  Killer Kane was no where near as intimidating as Charles Middleton's great  performance as Ming the Mercilous. Wilma Deering is just there and doesn't  stand out as much as Jean Rogers does as Dale Arden in the Flash Gordon  series. Charectors aside there is still plenty of adventure,space battles  and unique effects to make this a worth while video for any one interested  in early sci-fi. A classic and until recently very hard to find.",963446400,11,950,4.773006134969325
1106701,5,6305990271,this is a great place to make a first impression about cliffhanger serials.  if you like this you will like flash gordon too.  this one and the second flash followed by the first flash followed by the last are the ranking order of them.  the motion picture code changed after the first flash.  that one was a teeny bit cheesy as far as budget went but the story was one you'd like if you like adventure.  there are a fair amount of this adventure kind of serial.  also check out undersea kingdom and phantom empire.  and if you are forgiving darkest africa was good for its time and is also an adventure one.,1370217600,,608,4.327433628318584

1106703,5,6305990271,"Faithful and exciting, ""Buck Rogers"" brings the world of the Dick Calkins comic strip to life. Even without the vivid primary colors of the Sunday strip, this well-produced serial captures the look and feel of the comic.

Buster Crabbe, the greatest screen action star of all time, brings his dapper everyman persona from the lavish Art Nouveau world of ""Flash Gordon"" to the nuts and bolts hardware Deco world of ""Buck Rogers"", never missing a beat. Killer Kane is a memorable villain, and the supporting cast does a fine job of moving the story along.

The DVD itself looks great, an excellent transfer.

If you love classic adventure serials, space opera, or are a Buck Rogers fan, definitely check this out. It's way more fun, inventive, and exciting than the modern day brand of space adventure movie. Indeed, after watching this, you'll see how little space-movies have advanced since the 1930's.",1355616000,,902,4.960264900662252
1106704,5,6305990271,"This old movie serial is nothing short of terrific. Ever have a rainy Saturday with not too much on your agenda?  Sit back and enjoy this old reel: it will bring back fond memories and even stir the imagination of those too young to remember anything so simplistic yet so utterly fascinating.  The gadgets, the hero, the archvillan, the antagonists et. al. are all contained.  If you enjoyed the Flash Gordon Trilogy, this version of Buck Rogers must be part of your collection. Buster Crabbe and company travel forward in time to battle the tyrant Killer Kane.  Need I say more?",1319500800,,579,4.702970297029703
1106705,3,6305990271,"One of the few good aspects of this serial is the use of futuristic devices such as transporters and a cloaking device, concepts later seen on the original Star Trek, and high speed tunnel transports, later seen in the movie Logan's Run. The fading marquis that introduces each episode was also copied by the Star Wars movie.

The rest of the serial consists mostly of back and forth travels between planets and places. There are also a large number of physical skirmishes between Buck Rogers and Killer Kane's cronies. Constance Moore is obviously beautiful but the military style pants and cloth helmet largely obscure her feminine beauty.

There is a nice scene at the end but the scene disappoints because the series ends with the backs of the protagonists facing the camera. Due to the weak plot, I only recommend this series if you want to see a historically significant film.",1251849600,2,882,4.8344370860927155
1106706,3,6305990271,"For fans of old fashioned science fiction hokum and mumbo-jumbo, this isn't bad. Buster Crabbe (Buck) and his teenage pal Buddy have their blimp lost in the snow for 500 years and are rescued to fight a gangster warlord named Killer Kane (how subtle) who has taken over the earth and wants Saturn to join him.

This is filled with good, hokey fun. Overly hammy acting (with some restraint from Buster Crabbe), chessy special effex, outrageous story (Buck and Buddy wake up 500 years in the future and immediately know how to fly the updated spaceships) and an overall amiable corniness that makes these 1930s-40s serials so much fun if you don't take them too seriosuly. A really interesting aspect is that one of the heroes of this series is played by an actual Asian actor (Philson Ahn as Prince Tallen of Saturn) with no stereotyped dialect and a dignified role. Pretty progressive for 1939 when most Asian characters were played by Whites with stereotyped accents.

The only problem here is that Buck suffers in comparison to the MASTER of sci-fi serials, FLASH GORDON (also starring Buster Crabbe and directed by Ford Beebe). Killer Kane is a dullard compared to FG's delightfully evil Ming the Merciless, and the other villans are no comparison to the ape men, reptiles, and clay people of FG. Nowhere NEARLY as much fun! But for what it is, it's good entertainment for a lazy weekend.",1251676800,6,1391,4.791666666666667
1106707,5,6305990271,The serial arrived in very good condition. A very good print of one of my favorite serials. Thanks for the speedy delivery.,1251072000,,123,4.636363636363637
1106708,3,6305990271,"Universal's 1939 adaptation of ""Buck Rogers"" is no match for the ""Flash Gordon"" cliffhangers. Buster Crabbe's space heroics are still fun to watch, but this 12-chapter serial suffers from erratic pacing and weak villains. Compared to the ruthless Emperor Ming, dictator Killer Kane (horribly portrayed by Anthony Warde) wouldn't pass muster in a ""B"" gangster movie. Despite her limited screen time, Constance Moore makes an effective Wilma Deering  while Jackie Moran is a definite plus as Buck's youthful sidekick. A mixed intergalactic bag, ""Buck Rogers"" proved only a moderate success with Saturday Matinee audiences. Not surprisingly, the studio rejected a follow-up and opted for Crabbe's return in ""Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe"" (1940).",1248739200,4,748,5.619469026548672
1106709,5,6305990271,"The minute this disk starts rolling, any day becomes a rainy Saturday, no matter what the weather, and the smell of tired popcorn fills the air. It starts when Buck and his young sidekick Buddy crash their airship. After 500 years of suspended animation, they awaken in a world ruled by the rapacious Killer Caine. Buck's experience with a 20th-century dirigible makes him a skilled flier, so there's no problem in leaping into one of the 25th century's spacecraft, dodging Caine's blockade, and zipping off to Saturn in search of help.

In many ways this seems almost interchangeable with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flash-Gordon/dp/B00004Y2QO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flash Gordon</a>, in which Crabbe also starred. This has the same wobbly spaceships (pointy this time, not tubby) seemingly driven by flatulent sparklers, lab with bubbling this'n'that, and opponents dumb enough to fall for just about anything - repeatedly. Fight scenes look more like puppies wrestling than actual combat, and sets seem unsophisticated even by the standards of the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek/dp/B001DHXT6G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek</a>&nbsp;series. One thing stands out, though: Wilma Darling, the sole female character, presents a strong, competent character. Seeing her face danger in a flight suit, rather than being saved from it in an evening gown, added a pleasant and modern touch to this otherwise cheesy period piece.

But I mean ""cheesy"" in a good way. I first saw this 1939 creation a lot closer to it's creation date than to the current day, and it just keeps getting better - sort of. There's no way I can rank this iconic piece of nostalgia objectively, so I give it the rating that the seven year old in me demands. Buck Rogers forever!

1106710,5,6305990271,I have wanted this serial for years.  My wife and I really enjoyed it.  Very campy.  We both enjoy old serials and movies and this fit right in.  I remember seeing it on TV when I was a kid.,1223078400,,190,3.7948717948717947
1106781,4,6305990271,"Back in the late seventies I was first exposed to Buck Rogers via the television show with Gil Gerard.  I later discovered the old serials with Buster Crabbe.  Without the benefit of having read the old comic strip I have no idea which one is more consistent with the original comic strip but I like them both for different reasons.  Although I liked Buster Crabbe better in Flash Gordon he does a great job here as well.  He looks the part and can sell the character regardless of how outlandish the plot was.  One of the things I didn't like was the use of a kid sidekick that was frozen along with him.  I've never liked that concept even with Batman.  Plus having a second person frozen for 500 years with him makes him seem less unique.  Also, Killer Kane didn't seem ruthless enough to me.  There is plenty of action though as he goes from one tough spot to another.  One of the things that I really enjoyed were the extras.  They had some great bios on the different cast members that really made this set a great value.",1213574400,,1027,4.352631578947369
1106782,5,6305990271,"Perhaps the most difficult part of securing an education is unlearning a ton of misinformation.  If that is the case, youngsters who saw this serial when it was first screened had a formidable task ahead of them, because the misinformation about space travel filled every episode.  Consider the following few examples:

(1) Weightlessness in inter-stellar space did not exist.  Buck and friends walk around inside their spacecraft with no problem.

(2) It took no time at all to go from the earth to Saturn, in a space ship that puffed smoke and exuded sparks.  At one point we are led to believe that the spacecraft could go 1,000 miles an hour.  At that rate it would have taken centuries to go anywhere in space.

(3) Saturn was not a gas giant but was of sedimentary rock that was obviously formed by water over millions of years.  In addition, Saturn had the same gravitational pull as earth in this serial.

(4) Cumulous clouds are in the Saturn sky.  However, when we see earth from space, there were no clouds at all.  It looked like a school globe suspended in the sky.

(5) Humans could breathe on Saturn without any problem at all.  Obviously the atmosphere was the same as on earth.

(6) Humans could also breathe in outer space, and it wasn't cold.  Buck and his friends don't even wear a jacket.  Spaceship doors could be opened, and people could even step from one ship to another, although the vehicles were traveling rather fast.

Oh, the list of absurdities could go on and on.  But no matter.  This serial and those of Flash Gordon had a significant affect upon the youth of the 1930s.  Boys in particular were introduced to space travel, despite all the misinformation in the serials, and dreamed that it could happen--to them.  One of the common denominatorss among the original astronauts was their fascination with Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon when they were young.  First there has to be the dream, even a silly one, before there can be reality.

The story in this serial is more than a bit thin, clear good vs. clear evil.  Buck Rogers goes from piloting a dirigible that crashes to piloting a spaceship, without a hitch, shortly after he awakens in 500 years.  At some point he becomes a colonel--we're not told how or why.  Buck goes from being amazed at the technological advances to telling people what to do in a matter of hours.  The dialogue is stiff.  The characters have minimal dimension.  People wear strange headgear and cloaks for no reason that I could fathom.

And yet--and yet somehow this works and is important.  I enjoyed this despite all the nonsense.  I and other viewers of the serial have already unlearned the misinformation, and the effect is not ruined.  What will people have to unlearn of our day in 60 years or so?",1190246400,2,2768,4.650826446280992
1106783,5,6305990271,"Although an enjoyable serial, its special effects didn't quite equal those
of the Lydecker brothers of Republic Pictures.",1183852800,,121,5.777777777777778
1106784,4,6305990271,"Chances are, if you're here, you've already made up your mind. People don't just stumble across a 1930s serial. So you're probably a fan of this kind of stuff.

Which means we aren't going to judge this like we would a new, slick, Hollywood release with top-notch actors. This is budget sci-fi made for kids of the 1930s. It's not sophisticated, the acting is a little stilted, and the science laughable. But if you wanted that stuff, you'd buy something else, right?

Comparing this to other serials, I think it's one of the best. Like all serials, it tends to bog down a bit after the first half. That's because most of the really new ideas get presented in the first chapters.

However, the inventive approach to effects and matte painting are really enjoyable. The story is just silly fun. The presence of a fairly non-stereotyped Asian actor is interesting (even though his acting's as bad as everyone else's).

If you're adding to your archive, don't miss this one. Cool ray guns, gravity belts, transporters...",1148342400,17,1017,4.7942857142857145

I'm from Ohio so some of you may remember TV movie hosts like: Super Host, The Goul, and Big chuck & Little John and the movies they showed.",1142726400,5,322,4.193548387096774
1106786,3,6305990271,"There are aspects of old science fiction movies that I find fun in an antique sort of way.  I enjoy the buzzing noises the spaceships make.  I also like the props.  What I care less for are some of the cheesy special effects and the general butchering of physics and science.  If you can keep things in perspective, you may enjoy this movie.

Buck Rogers (Crabbe) and Buddy (Jackie Moran) crash in a dirigible.  A new gas causes them to oversleep the alarm by a little.  When I say a little, I mean something on the order of 500 years.  Buck and Buddy find themselves in a battle with a crime boss named Killer Kane (Anthony Warde).  After consulting with the local fighters for democracy, and quickly learning everything he needs to know about science and technology (Buck jumps behind the controls to a spaceship and flies it with no lessons), Buck travels to Saturn to get the people of Saturn's help.

After traveling through clouds, Buck lands on Saturn, but a representative of Killer Kane got there first.  We know today that Saturn is a gas planet, and we are reasonably certain that it would be impossible to land on Saturn.  Anyway, Buck escapes from Saturn and heads back to earth, hoping that he can find the emissary from Saturn and convince him that Killer Kane is the bad guy, not the fighters for democracy.

This movie plugs along, with people shooting at each other, but the angles are all wrong.  The ""rays"" are actually okay, just a lot wider than if the guns were lasers, and they sometimes come from the wrong angle.  In one case, the angle is from about 15 feet off the ground when the rays should have been parallel to the ground.  When I saw some of the guys in this movie in their ""futuristic"" space suits, I realized why those suits never became a style.  Pot bellies just show up way to well in these suits.

This movie has a lot of charm.  I enjoyed the buzzing, spark shooting space ships.  All the metal is heavily riveted, looking more like battleships than space ships.  Everyone gets to wear these tight, form-fitting caps.  It is interesting to see what people thought the future looked like back in the 1930s.  The use of helmets to turn people into robots seemed to me to be a kind of allegory to Nazi Germany, or perhaps communism.

If you liked Buster Crabbe in Flash Gordon, then likely you will enjoy this movie as well.  Another similar movie is ""Radar Men on the Moon.""  Keep your expectations in line with 1939 and you may find a treat.",1142640000,6,2480,4.479910714285714

Obviously these two classic serial have one thing in common, and that is its star, Buster Crabbe. Crabbe was a gold medal swimmer in the 1932 Olympics and then became a movie star much like Johnny Weismuller.  In fact Crabbe actually was up for the part of Tarzan that went to Weismuller.  Crabbe would go on to play Tarzan later as well star in a string of Westerns but he'll forever be remembered as Buck and Flash Gordon by most fans.

In this 12 part serial, Buck and his sidekick Buddy awake from suspended animation in the 25th century to find the world ruled by the nefarious Killer Kane (Anthony Warde).  Buck Gets help from Wilma Deering (Constance Moore) and Prince Tallen of Saturn to eventually overthrow the ruthless warlord and bring peace to the world.  Filled with classic space opera adventure, spaceships on strings, cardboard sets (and acting) Buck Rogers was a true early sci-fi classic.  While almost second rate on everything compared to Flash Gordon, it still rises above most other serials of its day.  Wilma Deering was no Dale Arden and Killer Kane no match for the deviousness of Ming the Merciless but this is still a very fun, and nostalgic serial to pop a few bags of popcorn over.  Action-packed, and never dull!",1116374400,7,1406,4.610441767068273

7899165,5,6305990271,"For me, this was a really long trip down memory lane. I last saw this serial at a children's matinee in 1956 or '57 - when I was eight or nine years old.

In the circumstances, it has stood the test of time remarkably well, holding my interest all the way through even as the old codger that I now am. There are minor grumbles of course. - giving Saturn a solid surface and a breathable atmosphere was unscientific even in 1939 - but I enjoyed it enough that I was willing to suspend disbelief.

The theme is nice and simple. Buck and his teenage pal Buddy are trapped in a crashed dirigible, and their lives saved only by use of a ""suspended animation"" gas. They wake up 500 years later to find that the world is now a dictatorship ruled by one ""Killer Kane"" with a hard core of resisters holding out in a secret underground city. Buck and Buddy of course join the Good Guys.

In fairness to Kane, his nickname is perhaps a bit harsh. As far as I recall, the only people he kills are ones who are fighting to overthrow him - something virtually all governments claim the right to do. But he is quite nasty enough, putting those who annoy him to slave labour as ""robots"", controlled by special helmets which suppress their memories and will power. Even one of his advisors suffers this fate for daring to talk back to him.

From there, it's  essentially to-ing and fro-ing between Earth and Saturn, with both sides trying to secure the support of the native Saturnians. In due course the Good Guys win.

One thing struck me. The synopses at the beginning of each episode were rolled out ""horizontally"" in the same way that the ""Long, long ago in a galaxy far,far away"" introduction was rolled out at the beginning of Star Wars. I wonder if the latter's makers acknowledged this.

In short, if you can tolerate what passed for special effects in 1939, and aren't too fussed about scientific inaccuracies, it's a surprisingly good view. Enjoy. I just wish I could say the same for the 1970s remake.",1489276800,,1996,4.467032967032967
7899166,1,6305990271,"The basic plot: Buck Rogers is exploring the in the Arctic when his dirigible crashes, and he, along with his pal Buddy, are told via radio that their only chance is to release the special preserving gas which is inexplicably included on their dirigible, which puts them into suspended animation.

500 years later, they are accidentally awoken by the people of the future, where they are immediately recruited to join the Hidden City, which is fighting the world rule of Killer Kane, a Hitler-like dictator.

The rest of the serial has Buck and Buddy, along with Wilma Deering, going back and forth between Saturn and Earth, with lackluster captures and escapes galore.

Ok, so any viewer going into this probably knows that the special effects aren't going to be good, with the sparks flying out of the exhaust system of the spaceships looking really cheesy, and I didn't mind that; what I didn't like was the incredibly bad acting, which is the worst I have ever seen.  And the condition of all of these actors!  Every one has an over-hanging pot belly, like they were recruited from the state winners of the pie-eating contests of America.  The lines that the actors have to speak are the most banal and boring things that you ever heard.

Looking at the other reviews that people have posted, I see many stating the Killer Kane's actor Anthony Warde is pretty awful, but I disagree, and think that he is the only actor, though very hammy, who brought any energy to his role, and the only one (besides Crabbe) who showed any emotion.

FYI, in the Sunday newspaper strip, the character Buddy wasn't Buck's friend from the past, but rather was Wilma's younger brother, and had his own comic strip attached to the bottom of the Sunday Buck Rogers, where he had adventures with Alura, a princess of Mars.",1467504000,,1803,4.719745222929936
