7936626,5,B00005B1YT,"The John Wayne The Later Years was very accurate in telling the story of the Duke's years from 1953-1976 which was his last film - It also said of his addiction to 4 packs a day of smoking cigarettes very heavily during his last years - This is what telling a story about a real American is all about - I have the Early Years of this, and everything that is and was said is true -  John Wayne made 142 filoms during his career, and personally, I own 106 of them, mostly taped from TV, but, I am a real John Wayne fan, as well as many members of my family are - Anybody and everybody, who is a real John Wayne fan, should get and have The John Wayne story, The Early Years and the Later Years both either on VHS or DVD.",1391472000,,718,3.9517241379310346
