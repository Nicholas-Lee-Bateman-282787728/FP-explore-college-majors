1361485,3,B00004W48W,"This is one of my favorite Chuck Norris films not because its good but because its so goofy. This whole plot of the movie is based around a final fight scene between Norris and Carradine. Its full of fun though if you can sit back and laugh at what was supposed to be a serious movie. Its got everything impossible from Chicks one-man shootemup of 12 horserustling villans at the beginning, to him driving his superchgarged bronco out from under three tons of packed dirt???!! Great fun in any case I cant wait till its on DVD.",995846400,,527,4.443298969072165
1361486,3,B00004W48W,"The movie is basically about a modern-day renegade Texas Ranger, played by Chuck Norris, who lives up to the old tales of how Texas Rangers were the ""Cowboy Cops"" who could out shoot, out ride and out fight just about anything that came across the prairie.  Norris' character is ultimately challenged by a ban of illegal gun dealers that use the Texas border as a way to get military weapons into Mexico. The movie takes place in an desolate location in West Texas and the action moves across the border towards the end.  There is a lot of action scenes where Norris exhibits his martial arts, and gun battles of the modern westerns movies. It is not a complete ""Man Movie"" as there is a romantic twist as well. For those who love Chuck Norris movies, will love to have this addition to their collection. Those who enjoy westerns and movies in or about Texas would also enjoy the movie. Not to mention those who enjoy martial arts.  It gives the spirit of what the Rangers mean to Texas, in a round about Norris way. A preview to what would become ""Walker, Texas Ranger.""",991094400,2,1071,4.510309278350515

1361488,5,B00004W48W,"This was definitely a vintage Chuck Norris film. Ranger Mcquade was awesome. David Carradine was the ultimate villain(evil to the core).The background of El Paso, Texas was also very classy and added to the Texas Ranger element in the film. Carradine is a gun runner who operates out of the area. It falls upon Norris to put a stop to his activities. There are many battles between Norris and the forces of evil. Norris faces many daunting challenges during this movie. All of this leads to a final show- down between Norris and Carradine. This is an excellent movie that you should definitely see. (It will bring up images of Walker Texas Ranger).Do not miss it.",982800000,,663,4.724137931034483
1361489,1,B00004W48W,"This movie represents the worst martial arts garbage on the planet. Every move is sluggish and impractical. ALL KICKS ARE ABOVE THE NECK! The acting  and plot are horrible and everything about this movie outrages me. These  people don't look like they are fighting, they look like they are  playing...POORLY! Chuck Norris and David Carradine are both capable of  terrific feats but they insist on making every aspect of their performance  a disgrace to their names and ranks. I boo them both. And this is the worst  of all the garbage that either of them has made. The only morals taught in  this movie are that police can break the law. Drinking, smoking and  uncleanness are fine,  violence is not a first alternative unless you are  really offended by what was said. Detestable garbage the whole way.",966297600,2,803,4.795620437956204
1361490,5,B00004W48W,"This movie must go down as one of the greats. Lone Wolf McQuade is action-packed from the very beginning, right up until that famous duel with David Carradine at the conclusion of the movie.  Ranger McQuade is a hero  to all of us: he loves his beer, drives a tough truck and kicks the crap  out of anyone who stands in his way. Chuck's best film by a long way.",934588800,6,361,4.128571428571429

1361523,5,B00004W48W,I think this is one of Norris' better movies and to me is a classic.  I have always wanted this to add to the collection and really enjoy watching it over and over again.,1494201600,,170,4.0
1361524,5,B00004W48W,"My small son who loves to have a ""Bro Night"" with me on rare weekends when my wife has to attend an academic conference. So, I am always on the search for a great ""guys movie"" that is decent but not too harsh for my small son. Lone Wolf McQuade comes fairly close to fitting that bill. I am not sure what most might consider to be the ideal action movie, but Lone Wolf McQuade might get my vote. It can easily stand side by side with other fan favorites of the 1980's like Predator, Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, Aliens, etc.... And the added bonus is that there is no overt bloodshed, cussing or sex in the movie. I would not say it is perfect for smaller kids, but if you fast forward through a few sketchy parts, it can be seen and enjoyed by a younger audience as well.

Most people who read this likely already know the plot but to help those few who may not, I will not divulge any spoilers. The story concerns the exploits of a fictional Texas Ranger based in El Paso whose name is J. J. McQuade (played by Chuck Norris). McQuade is a lawman who lives in a dilapidated home but who has extremely good skills with unarmed combat and with firearms. After dealing with cattle thieves at the beginning of the movie, Ranger McQuade quickly becomes involved in trying to determine who is selling stolen military equipment in the area. His suspicions quickly turn to Rawley Wilkes (played by David Carridine), a local businessman who seems to enjoy taunting others and is an expert in martial arts. Obviously a showdown is brewing and the two take turns trying to bring the other one down.

Is it high drama on par with the opera La Boheme? Hell no, but it is a great action movie and one that most audiences can enjoy. My small son loved the fights, and McQuade's Bronco but we did skip one or two minor areas that were a bit too violent. Overall the movie is great and a good watch for fathers and sons everywhere.",1494115200,3,1911,4.335195530726257

1361526,5,B00004W48W,"This film has always been a favorite. It is over the top in many ways. J.J. McQuade is a larger than life character. The music by Francesco Demasi adds to the impact. This is a loving homage by Chuck Norris to the Spaghetti Westerns of the 1960's. Just look at ""Marano"" (first bad guy).",1493078400,,286,4.314814814814815

Let's face it I don't watch a Norris film for great thespian oratory or complicated/sophisticated plots and deep characters, I just wanna see the Chuckster spin-kick bad guys into oblivion.  This film has lots of guns, an evil dwarf, more guns, explosions, even more guns, a bad-ass pet wolf, a bra-less Barbara Carrera (homina-homina wow wow!), Mexican bandits, and a whole lot of guns!  And of course a ""let's put down the guns and have a code of the Gladiator, mano-e-mano hand to hand duel with the main villain.  Solid production values and a homage to Sergio Leone, Clint Eastwood (check out the name of the hospital Chuck picks up his daughter from) and Ennio Morricone are evident here and they work pretty good.  Decent supporting cast with good ol' boys R.G. Armstrong and L.Q.

If chuck Norris had done more movies with director Steve carver maybe more of his movies would have been better. His movies after lwm were kind of lame afterwards because they were not martial art movies really anymore. And he signed with cannon after this movie. In aefae chuck would against like a summo wrestler known as the professor at the end. In lwm it was chuck vs Kung fu star David Carradine.,1446940800,,478,4.382022471910112

My dad(blue shirt) was standing right next to Chuck, counting money to place a bet on the fight. My dad passed a few years ago, and I am very happy to see that this movie made it to Blu Ray.

1361655,4,B00004W48W,"Released in 1983, Lone Wolf McQuade inspired the TV series Walker, Texas Ranger that came out a decade later. Chuck Norris stars as the eponymous McQuade, a kick-axx ranger from El Paso whos known for being a lone wolf. He takes on a drug kingpin (David Carradine) whose gang uses automatic weapons while protecting his daughter (Dana Kimmell) and romancing the kingpins babe (Barbara Carrera).

While its easy to write off this film because its so cartoony, melodramatic and unrealistic, its a quality action flick if you can embrace it for what it is. The actions good, which includes a few martial arts sequences, and the screenwriter at least attempts to add some depth to the characters. Carradine hams it up as the villain dripping with evil while Norris plays an effective loner protagonist. Kimmell is cute and Carrera is ravishing, but they couldve done more with them. The spaghetti Western score by Francesco De Masi is excellent and the authentic Southwest cinematography is a plus.

The film runs 107 minutes and was shot in El Paso, Texas.

GRADE: B- (or a weak 4/5 Stars)",1425945600,,1086,4.859459459459459
1361656,4,B00004W48W,"I'm not a fan of Chuck Norris, but I can't deny that the man appeared in some good movies. ""Lone Wolf McQuade"" is one of these, and according to some other reviewers, it's the best one Norris ever made. I'd believe that, given how over-the-top and indulgent it is. This modern western packs a great cast and plenty of action, but is probably too much to handle for drama fanatics. If you're seeking to introduce yourself to Chuck, this is great way to do it.

The story: A renegade Texas Ranger (Norris) wages war against a drug kingpin (David Carradine,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kung-Fu/dp/B000X07TLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kung Fu</a>).

I haven't seen every movie that the man was in, but based on those I have, I think that Chuck Norris looks most at home on this pseudo-frontier. He seems much more legitimate as a lawman than a police officer, if you know what I mean, and thus occupies the McQuade character with tangible gusto. Ridiculously macho, McQuade looks perfectly capable of taking on Rambo and winning. It's safe to say that he overshadows everybody else in the picture, but they make a good effort: despite his character being so one-dimensional, Carradine is always fun to watch, as is old L. Q. Jones (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Patriot/dp/6305428158/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Patriot</a>) as McQuade's buddy, and the same goes for Leon Kennedy (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Body-and-Soul/dp/B0006GAO40/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Body and Soul</a>) as the second of McQuade's two partners. The major female roles are a disappointment, though: the fantastic Barbara Carrera (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Centennial/dp/B00E3QJ8DC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Centennial</a>) is reduced to vacuuming Norris' house, and poor Dana Kimmell (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friday-the-13th-Part-III/dp/B00AEFY22I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friday the 13th - Part III</a>) - playing McQuade's daughter - is punched, shot, kidnapped, sees her boyfriend murdered, and is pushed off a ledge in a car over the course of 107 minutes.

Speaking of cars, the action content is strong. Expanding beyond his ""karate man"" image, Norris engages in a good deal of shooting and causes plenty of explosions. He has some remarkable moments of badassery, like when he kicks the gun out of a thug's hand, knocks him down, and shoots him dead before the schlub even hits the ground. A scene wherein Norris' stunt double climbs on top of a speeding car is actually breathtaking. There are several long-lasting shootouts, but the fistfights tend to be distributed throughout the picture in minute helpings. Naturally, the fights build up to the inevitable Norris-Carradine showdown. Disappointingly, this is not&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lee-vs-Norris/dp/B00005BCKD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lee vs. Norris</a>. The film was released in 1983 - purportedly the year that Carradine actually started studying kung fu - but even though their fight is longer and less one-sided than I expected, David is irredeemably sloppy and Chuck is clearly doing his best not to kill the guy for real.

Despite some moments of unintentional goofiness (e.g. the operatic vocalizing when Norris and Carrera kiss, and the cheesy organ music when Norris and Carradine begin their fight), this film is unabashedly cool. Its lead star makes a lasting impression, and between the nods to Sergio Leone and the creative efforts of antihero-idolizing director Steve Carver (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Bad-Mama/dp/B0042FUHUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Bad Mama</a>), it's hard not to be infected by this one's neatness.

1361715,4,B00004W48W,"This movie is hilariously awesome if you enjoy cheesy action flicks.  Chuck is great as the lone texas ranger that don't need no partner.  While Caradine plays the former karate champ now gun runner playboy.  I can't tell you how many beer commercial spots coors paid for during this film, but they certainly got their monies worth.  Not to mention whoever made the SUV he drives gets a few too many kudos to be coincidence.  The cheese in this movie is everywhere, but the action is great and the cast is as well.  But the best scene maybe ever is also in this movie, and I'm going to spoil it because you need to know just how awesome this movie is.

Okay, so Chucks been captured, beaten and thrown in his SUV.  Caradine has his boys bury the SUV in a hole with a bulldozer.  Chuck wakes up to find himself buried alive, Chuck then somehow finds a cold beer and opens it up and takes a drink, deep in thought on what to do about his predicament.  Chuck then has that F-this look on his face and starts the vehicle up, and floors it.  It takes a couple of seconds as you would imagine a SUV buried in say 5 feet of dirt would.  However after a couple seconds of plowing himself out of the earth he's able to gain enough speed to kill a machine gun villain who's right in front of the hole the SUV was buried in.  SO FUNNY, and SO MUCH MORE CHEESE!",1390435200,,1349,4.182170542635659
1361716,1,B00004W48W,"Read the plot synopsis (which is of questionable accuracy, but suitable for the purpose), then skip the first hour and a half. What follows isn't particularly worth seeing, either, but, assuming you skip the credits, you'll have only wasted 15 minutes.

The concept is serviceable, but the execution is terrible. Not for the lack of technology, but mostly for the lousy script and the seeming inability of Chuck to show much of an emotional connection to anything other than beer.

""SPOILER"" ALERT:

The ""love interest"" makes no sense. Hot, rich woman shows up to clean his disgusting shack and restock his fridge. Why? The ""relationship"" ""develops"" over the span of a couple of minutes to a water fight with a hose and a bit of ""romance"" in the mud. If she dies, who cares? (As it later seems, nobody.)

After his character's dog/wolf dies, he looks at the empty food and water dishes as if 'well, guess I don't need to bother filling them any more.'

The little person as a villain was ridiculous, but not really in a funny way.

At least the black FBI agent wasn't the one portrayed as a complete moron.

Some ways in which the movie could've been improved substantially:

Replace the cheesy secondary villain.

Get rid of the ""love interest"" angle; it doesn't work as written, not even close. The daughter provides sufficient motivation; the ""love interest"" plays none (plot synopsis notwithstanding, the only clear indication that she was kidnapped came too late to make any difference.)

Explain how his character went from getting married and having a daughter, to being a bitter prick who lives in a squalid shack in the desert while still being at least somewhat actively involved in his daughter's life.

Better yet, change ""bitter prick"" to just plain ""loner""; it's still well within Chuck's range.

Get rid of most of the gratuitous stupidity. (Some degree of stupidity can be useful in the genre (if for nothing other than keeping staples such as [don't quickly kill the ""hero"" when easily possible, so he can inevitably win the day] and [drop loaded gun->drop loaded gun->fight!]), but there's some stupidity that's just plain useless.)

If not doing EFFECTIVE character development instead, at least replace the ineffective character development with more action, or just cut the run time. Better to be thoughtlessly exciting than to be ponderously dumb.

Not having him violating the law on a routine basis would probably help. As it is, he comes off as a scumbag with a badge.

The story is typical action fare : Lone Wolf McQuade is the baddest dude around, but he needs to reign it in.  He gets results, but the brass aren't happy with his reckless, tough guy ways.  So they saddle him with a partner.  Also a girl shows up and cleans up his house, which really ticks him off.

You cannot access or pick scenes and there are no audio or language options either. The movies are in English. The movies don't have the greatest picture quality, especially Breaker, Breaker!

Lone Wolf is why there are the famous Chuck quotes today. It has one of the most epic opening credit sequences that sends chills up your spine. I loved seeing David Carradine get his ass kicked only cause I don't like his cockiness. Dana Kimmell of Friday the 13th part 3 is Chuck's daughter and she is always nice to look at.

1361775,4,B00004W48W,"Back in the 1980s Chuck Norris made a career out of starring in approximately 40 million low-budget action movies. Most of these were produced by the notorious Cannon Group, but thankfully Lone Wolf McQuade was exempt from that rule. With a price tag that wouldn't even cover the catering budget of the typical Hollywood film, and a PG rating, Lone Wolf McQuade actually manages to be very good for what it is.

Chuck is the titular McQuade, a grubby, rugged (grubbed?) Texas Ranger with hair covering 90% of his body who lives in a dirty shack out in the desert and spends what little free time he has blasting at target dummies. His wife and daughter have moved on, tired of his dedication to the job. Make no mistake, McQuade is one honest-to-God, genuine, straight-up tough guy. He's too good for the job, angering his long-suffering Captain who teams him with a cheeky, young upstart Highway Patrolman. McQuade doesn't take to kindly to this and just as he chases his new partner out of his dirty shack his daughter (Dana Kimmel, the cutie-pie lead from Friday the 13th Part 3) is caught-up in a gun-running plot operated by the evil Rawley Wilkes (David Carradine, who looks so much like Chuck they could be brothers, minus the body hair).

It's basically an A-Team plot (the clip credits don't help distract from this) but everything is overblown so much it truly would have been an awesome film to watch in a crowded cinema back in 1983. Even the score, by some guy I had never heard of, was brilliant, echoing Spaghetti westerns of the 60 and 70s. Everything that can be exaggerated gets the treatment. But it's important to note that this is not a ridiculous film in the vein of Commando. Lone Wolf McQuade takes itself seriously as a western and somehow, through sheer masculinity and a devil-may-care attitude it works.

Apparently Chuck liked the character so much he wanted to make a TV show out of it but MGM wouldn't budge so Walker, Texas Ranger was created instead. It's a shame that it had to turn out that way as a TV show would have been a nice legacy for the movie. As it is, it's one of Chuck's best. I went in with expectations so low they could ooze underneath the bathroom door. McQuade may be a lone wolf, but he's also a dark horse.

You've got to admit, for a studio that were brought back from the brink of bankruptcy very recently, MGM are quite generous when it comes to their catalog releases on Blu-ray. Even their lesser regarded movies are getting decent transers. Lone Wolf McQuade is presented in a very nice-looking 1.85:1 1080p transfer with all of the grain from the original negative present for you purists. The film doesn't have an eye-popping color pallet, but it's the best it has ever looked since the premier screening. A punchy DTS HD-MA mono track is also included with a single trailer as the lone wolf extra. Sadly, it comes in a nasty eco-case.",1350864000,4,2897,4.608527131782946

1361784,4,B00004W48W,"I love this movie! The cinematography, art direction, acting, the music score and fight scenes are all very well done. Chuck Norris was perfect for the role. The music provides a feeling of great depth and of something always about to happen. Supporting actors were magnificent, i.e. the great character actor R.G. Armstrong, the wonderful L.Q Jones as the epitomy of cowboy culture, and of course, David Carradine. Carradine was not much of a martial artist in real life but he plays the role well. He is cocky, arrogant, and just a downright evil person but still has a touch of humanity. The only thing I didn't like is that this movie perpetuated the traditional portrayal of dwarfs as either bufoons or villains. In this case, the dwarf was a villain though splendidly played by Daniel Frishman. Barbara Carrera, Latin American beauty, is excellent as Chuck's love interest.

The movie draws a lot of inspiration from Sergio Leone's spagetti westerns. The close-ups of villains twiching and chewing their cigarettes, etc., the framing of the hero before a fight scene, all are very engaging. Every action scene is beautifully staged and shot and we find ourselves wondering what will happen, though, somehow, we know Chuck will win out! Though Chuck is almost superhuman in his prowess, nevertheless, he is vulnerable and is seriously hurt in at least one scene. He and his team must prevail against overwhelming odds and turn defeat into victory.

Lesson 2:  If Chuck Norris wants to take a small arsenal of weapons across the border, Chuck Norris is going to take a small arsenal of weapons across the border.  (If you are a postmodernist, Chuck Norris is allowed to transgress the boundaries.)
Lesson 3: If Chuck Norris wants to kill himself, then Chuck Norris will kill himself.  Now get him a beer and get rid of these vitamins.

1361794,5,B00004W48W,"Another fabulous film inspired by Sid the Elf. You must check them out if you haven't already!

I've been a Norris Fan for quite some time, yet I haven't seen all of his movies since he's got over 500 in his library. So I've been catching up on my Chia-Chuck lately, hitting the good & the bad. This movie is quite good!

First of all it has a midget in the movie. And it's not your usual dwarf/elf/stunt-double midget. This little bugger is, basically, cause for all the chaos in the film. Midgets need more positive roles like this one in Hollywood. I'm tired of elf movies.

David Carradine plays a bad guy in this movie, and does it well. I'm used to seeing him as Bill from the Tarantino flicks (and vaguely remember him in Kung Fu). So it was nice to get a younger Bill, and more evil I think.

Norris is his usual bad self. A blend of karate and NRA member he takes out some slimeball with gold teeth and most of everyone else in the movie. And how does Norris get to bed all these hot women? He must have them write it in the script or threatens to quit the movie. In any rate his Chia-Chest pulls them in like the Death Star's tractor beam.

The final showdown is a bid silly, as Norris doesn't really show off his karate against Carradine, until he gives a good backfist to Norris' daughter. Then he goes into ""Hulk"" mode and almost kicks Carradine's head off.

A great Norris movie that has only 1 flaw: they left the midget behind, with his cute little arms swinging in the air.",1223164800,2,1490,4.26595744680851
1361805,4,B00004W48W,"Lone Wolf McQuade is a movie that has long been on Sid the Elf's ""Movies we absolutely must review at some point"" list. We knew the possibility for greatness existed because Chuck was involved and he was playing a loner rouge Texas Ranger. If that's not a recipe for success, Sid doesn't know what is. Upon learning that Chuck's co-star in the movie was David Caradine, our level of excitement went up a notch because we knew there would be some terrific B fight scene. So we finally took the oportunity to watch the flick that was a huge inspiration for Walker Texas Ranger. In fact, one-half Sid is seriously considering taking a cue from Ricky Bobby and naming one kid Lone Wolf and another McQuade. Also, to take things up a notch, we had Santa with us watching the flick, and it was so good that he stayed awake for almost the whole thing.

If there has ever been a better begining to a movie, Sid will eat his pointy elf hat. You have a group of Mexican bandits, or banditos, wreaking havoc and causing chaos on their horses even though the film is set in 1983. Anyway, the leader of the gang wore only a black vest, and he had no business not wearing a shirt. The film is set in sunny El Paso, Texas so thankfully, the gang leader's gold tooth glistened in the sun brilliantly. We cannot emphasize this enough, this guy looked like he smelled as bad as anyone has ever smelled. It ends up that these banditos kill a couple of state troopers, but the whole scene is being watched by J.J. McQuade(Norris) from the top of a hill. Obviously, a battle ensuses in which Chuck offs like 5 guys by haphazardly spraying bullets in their general direction while spinning around. Breathtaking. Later, Chuck's captain attemps to pair him up with a young but talented cop named Kayo. We said it even before Norris could, ""Chuck works alone."" Then we get a glimpse into McQuade's personal life. We see McQuade's shack and his pet wolf. The house is deplorable. It looks like a tornado hit it and the fridge is stocked with nothing but brew. Well done, Chuck. Then we get to see Norris take some target practice on homemade targets. Trust us, this was hilarious. He has an ex-wife and a daughter who is dating a swell guy who thinks McQuade is the tops. McQuades daughter and her boyfriend are not doing anything parked in a car atop a hill when they see an Army cargo convoy being hijacked. Somebody sees them and pushes the car down the hill, killing the boyfriend and injuring the daughter. Bad move, guys. Now McQuade is going to track you down and make you wish you were never born.

McQuade employs the help of Kayo and Federal agent Jackson, played by A.C. Green and his fro/mullett, to track down the hijackers who injured his daughter. McQuade's trail leads him to Rawley Wilkes(Caradine) and Lola Richardson, the woman Wilkes is trying to uncork. However, she takes one look at Chuck and says ""Why have hamburger when you can have fillet mignon, I want Chuck and his excessive body hair. I want him to give me a light rash."" We've seen that Chuck can kick butt like none other. Now we get to see Caradine put on a martial arts display at a county fair. And it was pretty good. You just know there's a showdown coming. McQuade meets up with Wilkes's sidekick, an elf. That's right, Wilkes's right hand man was a cunning wise-cracking motorized wheelchair-riding brethern of Sid himself. McQuade gets a bit of info about Wilkes' operations and decides to take him down. But, Wilkes is onto McQuade and decides to attack him first. He kidnaps McQuade's daughter and Lola and shoots McQuade's pet wolf. This sends McQuade into a frenzy and he goes with his two helpers to Wilkes's compound. For perhaps the only time in his life, Chuck gets a beatdown by Wilkes' henchmen. They put McQuade in his souped up SUV and bury him alive in the vehicle. McQuade regains consciousness and realizes the situation. Of course he floores the pedal and drives out of the dirt, what else did you expect?

So now it's time for the inevitable McQuade-Wilkes showdown. Lets look at the tale of the tape: McQuade just drove out of being buried alive and energized himslef with a beer, Wilkes just kidnapped two women and shot a pet wolf. Advantage McQuade. McQuade is wearing a sleeveless Army vest with no shirt unerneath, Wilkes is wearing a completely queer white Argyll sweater. Huge advantage McQuade. That's really all you need to know. After getting his butt kicked for a couple minutes, McQuade rallied and whooped Wilkes to a pulp. Chuck never has and never will lose a fight. That's the rule.

We couldn't imagine a better result from a spur of the moment choice to watch Lone Wolf McQuade. It has everything we could ask for. A Santa viewing with tons of borderline disturbing commentary absolutely not suitable for print, Norris and his obscene ammount of chest/shoulder hair, a hot chick, a great villain, a gang of banditos with a perfect leader, a crossbow, and most importantly an elf with a prominent role. The only reason this film got only 4 stars from us is the lag in the middle of the film. Despite this, we can't recomend this film strongly enough.

1361807,1,B00004W48W,"This film is pure comedy from start to finish - if you like bacon you''ll love this flick from Chuck Norris because it's packed with ham; hammy acting, hammy dialog, hammy themes, hammy music etc etc etc.

I won't bother to bore you with the films basic premise since it's the least interesting aspect - it's not like you're looking for a challenge right? Chuck Norris makes incredible comedy films in much the same way Steven Seagal does! Who knew that Norris had the raw comedic skill to play his own straight man in what has to be the equivalent of a spoof movie played for serious.

One thing that anybody watching this film needs to get straight is that it's really about beer. You heard me, beer ... that's right - it's all about how much beer the Ranger can drink whilst remaining completely fit in spite of it. It's all about drinking beer at the most inappropriate and unrealistic moments and letting the audience know that he's a real man because he can simply consume the stuff morning, noon and night, without the slightest consequence to his person. When does he get time to eat or train? He must be absolutely off his gourd 24/7! Let us never entertain the thought that he's drinking light beer ... or on the job for heavens sakes!

Some of the greatest moments of pure hilarity come when his dog is shot in a late night raid by the drug kingpins boys ... when he finally reaches the dead doggy he kneels down and punches the dirt with his fist then caresses the doggy with the same hand. This is pure genius as it illustrates that he can be violent and yet tender at the same time. The presence of his chick in the doorway wearing nothing but his shirt only serves to punch up the sexual tension seemingly hidden in this scene and underpin that while Mcqualude may have lost his dog he's still gonna get lucky when he goes back inside. This is screen writing gold!

In earlier scenes McQualude comes home to his babe who has just been languishing on the bed all day in a see through gown - we presume just waiting for the Ranger to bless her with his hairy presence. He walks in and ignores her attentions instead heading to the fridge and cracking a can of beer ... he lays on his back on the bed with that beer on his chest and gives her the strong silent treatment while she sprawls on top of him determined to see if she can get a swig. He cracks a smile at scenes end and we know right there that he's got a soft heart and will likely share a beer with her. Right on McQualude!

Fast forward now where the Ranger meets up in town in an office with an Army General, an FBI guy, a Mayor, a D.A the head of the Rotary organization, general director of AMWAY etc to get the heads up on whats going down. He then heads out into the desert with the FBI dudes - Ranger in his ( get this ) nitro charged 4x4! For anybody that knows anything about 4 wheelers and or driving such I'll just let that simmer a moment as you now consider scenes where he's seen speeding along highways like a Ferrari in the same Nitro Charged vehicle much like the Batmobile would exit the Bat Cave; Super stuff indeed!

So once out in the desert in his Nitro 4 Wheeler he is traveling in convoy with the Feds in their own stock standard 4x4 - what happens next is pretty gripping stuff but it's teaches the audience a lesson about McQualude. The Feds who are in front of the Ranger get stuck on a little bit of gravel about the same size as everything else they've been driving over for the last 30 mins. Amazingly to my observant eyes I could not detect the slightest sign of them being cross axel'd or hung up with their diff! But don't let this get in the way of an exercise in superiority because The Ranger turns to his young partner and says "" Let's show em what this thing can do"".

McQualude does a quick maneuver and nudges them from behind and un-sticks the Feds vehicle from the pebbles they were mysteriously hung up on - to which one Fed exclaims to the other ...""What has he got there, a tank or something?"". What the writers wanted us to learn here is that the Rangers vehicle is an extension of the Ranger himself and that he is superior in an unassuming and yet strong silent way. His truck drinks Nitro and he drinks beer ... together they are man and machine perfection! We are indeed a privileged audience and ought to think ourselves even lucky to be viewing a film like this about the Ranger.

After those intense moments in off roading we find the bad guys camp in the desert headed up by none other than Kung Fu's David Carradine. When the time comes at night for the Feds and McQualude to make their attack he gets shot and overcome after taking a few with him. A Helicopter lands and out gets Carradine with the Rangers chick who is also the Carradines chick ... confused? Don't be. So now they beat up on the Ranger a bit while the chick pleads for his release and Carradine decides to bury the Ranger in his Chariot like an old Viking. They chuck Norris into his Nitro machine of 4 wheeling superiority and begin to bury him, and it, alive with a huge front end loader smothering it with dirt.

What happens next is the central BEER axis point of the entire film - it's when the Ranger, his Nitro machine and a can of beer all fuse together, become one and by some hidden manifestation of all that is masculine Mcgyver their way out of certain death! So we now see the Ranger inside his truck cab, dirt pouring in over the vehicle ... the Ranger is still half conscious from his licking at the hands of Carradine but he manages in his near death like state - AND with eyes closed - to reach for a can of beer. We see his can cracking finger weakly hovering over the ring and he tries to summon the strength to crack one last beer ... he finally cracks it, takes a long swig and then pours the rest over his head in a show of cryptic defiance to his wanton alcoholism! He doesn't want to get drunk just yet ... but he wants a taste and the rest, the rest is for luck!

Just as the Ranger is done fusing his body with beer he reaches for the ignition, hit's the nitro super charger, digs his foot into the floor and screams in agony as he wheel spins his way out of his own burial ... the entire scene is ejaculatory as he bursts from the ground like a risen phoenix, as fluid would shoot from a freshly cracked can of beer! He kicks the door open and manages to blow a bad guy away while his partner takes care of the last few. When all are dead he rolls out of the truck cab a spent force and looks to all as though dead. His partner comes over and says ""Don't die on me now Ranger"" ... it's kind of like the dead doggy scene in reverse now ... but then just as we think McQualude might be a goner ... he looks up and says ...

""GET ME A BEER KID!""

This really should have been the end of the film right there ... the writers missed a golden op but it goes on for a while yet through more action sequences replete with comedic timing to end with the anti climactic showdown between Carradine and the Ranger. I won't spoil the ending but suffice it to say it's not as complex as you're likely to believe at this late stage. Does he get his daughter back? You'll have to watch to find out.

I gave this film one star but I give it with great love and respect! I laughed all night long.",1191715200,9,7303,4.207857142857143

1361813,5,B00004W48W,"Passport Video presents ""The Bela Lugosi Box - 15 Frightful Films"" (1942) --- (Dolby digitally remastered) --- Bla Lugosi was the stage name of actor Bla Ferenc Dezs' Blask (October 20, 1882 - August 16, 1956) --- Lugosi was born in Lugos, Hungary, at the time part of Austria-Hungary (now Lugoj, Romania), the youngest of four children of a baker --- best known for his portrayal of ""Dracula"" in the American Broadway stage production, and subsequent film, of Bram Stoker's classic vampire story.

Late in his life, he again received star billing in movies when filmmaker Edward D. Wood, Jr., a fan of Lugosi, found him living in obscurity and near-poverty and offered him roles in his films, such as ""GLEN OR GLENDA?"" (1953) (in which his role made no more sense than the rest of the movie) and as a Dr. Frankenstein-like mad scientist in ""BRIDE OF THE MONSTER"" (1955), during post-production of the latter, Lugosi entered treatment for his addiction, and the premier of the film was ostensibly intended to help pay for his treatment expenses. The extras on an early DVD release of ""PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE"" (1959) include an impromptu interview with Lugosi upon his exit from the treatment center, which provide some rare personal insights into the man --- this was one of Lugosi's most infamous roles was released after he was dead. Ed Wood (Director) features footage of Lugosi interspersed with a double --- Wood had taken a few minutes of silent footage of Lugosi, in his Dracula cape, for a planned vampire picture but was unable to find financing for the project --- Wood later conceived of Plan 9, Wood wrote the script to incorporate the Lugosi footage and hired his wife's chiropractor to double for Lugosi in additional shots --- notice however the ""double"" is thinner than Lugosi, and covers the lower half of his face with his cape in every shot --- Leonard Maltin (Famous Film Critic) was quoted - ""Lugosi died during production, and it shows.""

Lugosi died of a heart attack on August 16, 1956 while lying in bed in his Los Angeles home. He was 73 --- Bela Lugosi was buried wearing one of the many capes from the Dracula stageplay, as per the request of his son and fifth wife, in the Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California --- Contrary to popular belief, Lugosi never requested to be buried in his famous cloak; Bela Lugosi, Jr. has confirmed on numerous occasions that he and his mother, Lillian, arrived at their decision independently.

Where bald white guys who make a career out of pretending to be Asian no longer get to hang out with really, very, tremendously hot chicks whose waist-lines are above their belly-buttons?  Where a pair of cowboy boots is no longer a legal license to kill Mexicans?  Pardon me, but that, sir, is not the kind of world I'd care to live in.

Need I say more?  There have been countless scores of cowboy-karate movies, but looking back through even the most shining moments of the genre, I keep coming back to one title: Lone Wolf McQuade.  Chuck here is a true bad boy.  He's cleaned up his image plenty since the days before he began having his back waxed.  And this film finds him on the cusp of those two Chucks:  still bad, but a little less hairy.

McQuade is, essentially, the swansong of the old bad Chuck, crusading for street justice with a gun in one hand and a bottle of whiskey in the other.  These kinds of heroes--pure heroes, one might say--seemed to have died with the 70s, suffocating under the layers of pink T-shirts and white suits that the 80s would herald in.  What remained was the Chuck of ""Sidekicks"".  Not an objectionable scrap of content in sight.  Pity.

This is an *important* film.  It matters.  Dreams have been made, molded, shattered, remolded and then scrapped completely because of this film.

1361819,5,B00004W48W,"SOME SPOILERS INCLUDED

In what ranks as his finest starring vehicle ever, Chuck Norris plays Texas Ranger J.J. McQuade, the ""Lone Wolf"" of the title. This A- movie is a cinematic monument to macho men, albeit with it's tongue firmly jammed into it's cheek. Broadly sampling Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns and Sam Peckinpah's slow motion mass destruction epics, LONE WOLF McQUADE established Chuck Norris as a scion of the Clenched Jaw School of Acting personified by Kirk Douglas, James Coburn, Lee Marvin, and the early Clint Eastwood.

In the first five minutes of the film we are treated to a large scale automatic weapons shootout between a gang of modern-day Mexican horse theives on one side, and McQuade on the other. This entree sets the movie's tone of violent but cartoonish excess leavened with snarly comedy.

Despite McQuade's record of making more felony arrests than any other Ranger, the Establishment (personified in a fat, balding, self-righteous and pompous Ranger Captain) wants to rein McQuade in and make him part of the team. After being assigned a new partner (the rookie Ranger Kayo, played by a very young Roger Beltran, later of STAR TREK fame), McQuade withdraws to his sanctum sanctorum, a remote, filthy house in the desert cluttered with beer cans, dirty laundry, year-old take out food, gun catalogues and God-knows-what-else, all guarded by a coyote (in other words, a typical bachelor pad). Kayo tags along puppy-like, unwanted.

Lone Wolf McQuade's nemesis, Rawley Wilkes, is a big-time gunrunner, played by David Carradine (the former star of KUNG FU). Wilkes tries to kill McQuade's daughter Sally (Dana Kimmel) for having witnessed a major arms hijacking, and this plot contrivance propels the film. Rawley Wilkes' girlfriend, Lola Richardson (the incredibly sexual Barbara Carrera at the peak of her powers) decides she likes white hats, and moves in with the Lone Wolf. She cleans his house, does his laundry, buys vitamins, cooks real meals for him, and throws out his beer (!), putting McQuade into a complete panic. He almost ends their relationship in a fit of machismo during which McQuade pops open a foaming beer can at crotch level and growls, ""Lady, if I want to kill myself, that's my business."" Lola storms out in a feminine huff, but the big tough guy immediately begs her to return. This is all typical male behavior, of course. After all, would YOU toss Barbara Carrera out the door?

Wilkes, who is tired of McQuade's meddling on just so many levels, kidnaps his daughter, kills his best friend Dakota (the iconic Western actor L.Q. Jones), shoots the coyote, snatches Lola, and decides to entrap the Ranger, luring him into the middle of nowhere. After delivering a topnotch beating, Wilkes orders that McQuade be buried alive in his nitro-powered SUV. What follows can only be called ""the holy scene,"" undoubtedly the apotheosis of this genre of film:

McQuade regains consciousness. Realizing he is buried alive, he grabs a can, anoints himself with beer, starts his truck, fires up the nitro, and drives himself out of his own grave, all to the accompaniment of a choir of angels in full voice. As he falls to the ground horribly injured, Kayo cries out, ""Ranger! Don't die on me now!"" to which McQuade responds epochally, ""Get me a beer, kid.""

Having lost daughter, dog, lover and best friend, McQuade follows Wilkes to Mexico, where there is a huge set-piece battle between the good guys and the bad guys, capped by a karate matchup between the World Champion Norris and the much less talented Carradine, who is allowed a few good kicks and punches before being dispatched to his reward.

Amazingly, this well-casted, well-acted, well-crafted and perennially popular film spawned no sequels, but it did inspire Norris' mild salsa version TV show, WALKER, TEXAS RANGER. A well-spent ninety minutes, LONE WOLF McQUADE may never be your girlfriend's favorite film, but it's a movie Everyman can enjoy.",1148083200,24,3964,5.032012195121951

1361836,4,B00004W48W,"He's mean, he's lean, and he's not about to do things by the book! Welcome to the world of the action star, that social loner who won't sit idly by when the scum of the earth prey on the human race. While the rest of us live our little lives playing by the rules like the dupes we are, these guys go out and make a difference. They actually like us despite our weaknesses, amazingly enough, and take care of us out of a sense of responsibility similar to what a lord used to feel for his peons. No matter what they do or whom they kill in the process their instincts never fail them. Even when their partner, significant other, child, or anyone else close to them dies horribly as a result of the threat the action star poses to the villains, they never swerve from their core principles. Their superiors recognize the action star's godlike powers and, while complaining publicly about their reckless behavior, put them right back out on the street to kill the bad guys. No investigative committee will stop these right-wing heroes from mopping up the riffraff. Who needs lawyers or a judicial system when we've got Charles Bronson, Sylvester Stallone, or Chuck Norris? Not me.

Enter ""Lone Wolf McQuade,"" an archetype of the loner action star film starring none other than martial artist turned movie star Chuck Norris. In this grim thriller, Norris stars as J.J. McQuade, a loose cannon Texas Ranger with a penchant for getting himself into scrapes that result in extremely high body counts. Witness the introductory scenes where McQuade single handedly slaughters a group of Mexican horse thieves in order to save several fellow officers. He stands on a cliff and refuses to flinch even when the goons throw up a volley of fire. What a guy! Then it is off to a ceremony for Dakota (L.Q. Jones), a fellow tough guy who is retiring after years of civil rights' violations. THEN we see McQuade stand down his boss and refuse to partner up with one of the very same officers he just saved from the banditos, the impressionable Kayo (Robert Beltran). After a few scenes in which we see McQuade wow Kayo with his ability to blow holes in stationary targets, we meet Jim's family. Awwww, he's got an understanding ex-wife and a pretty young daughter who loves to spend time with him! But it isn't surprising McQuade's wife left him: the guy lives like a slob in a shack out in the desert, drinking beer all day and playing with his pet wolf. A pet wolf!

Trial and tribulation looms on the horizon with the emergence of Rawley Wilkes (David Carradine) and his diminutive business partner Falcone (David Frishman). Both men are gunrunners trying to make a buck during a time when selling weapons to third world despots and miscreants was a lucrative way to make a living. Wilkes, when he isn't double crossing clients, likes to appear in public martial arts exhibitions with his beautiful girlfriend Lola Richardson nearby (Barbara Carrera). Predictably, McQuade appears at one of these outings and quickly becomes enmeshed in a fight with several of Wilkes's goons. The two men stare at one another and then retreat to battle another day. It's not too long after this confrontation that McQuade decides to bring down Wilkes's operation, which he proceeds to do with the intermittent help of Kayo and a rat named Snow (William Sanderson). The feds decide to make an appearance too, sending in disgruntled agent Jackson (Leon Isaac Kennedy) to help McQuade bring down the baddies. Off they go to Mexico and a violent, explosion filled showdown with the smirking Rawley Wilkes. Did I mention that Carradine's character likes to wear sweaters out in the desert? Not only is he a bad guy, he was apparently born without sweat glands.

""Lone Wolf McQuade"" goes so far over the top and boasts so many clichs that it is easy to overlook the stylistic elements injected into what is essentially a run of the mill action movie. Director Steve Carver decided to turn this picture into a spaghetti western set in Texas during the modern day, so he hired a composer to mimic Ennio Morricone and shot a lot of scenes where we see extreme close-ups of the characters' faces. Sometimes this technique actually works, but far too often it doesn't. The movie treats us to tons of ridiculous scenes, including a ""touching"" sequence where McQuade mourns the killing of his pet wolf as well as an outrageously unbelievable scenario in which J.J. drives his rocket equipped truck (!) out of a giant grave. It sounds ridiculous, and it is, but ""Lone Wolf McQuade"" IS an enjoyable action flick. Lots of stuff blows up, car chases abound, and the body count climbs into the high double digits. Heck, even L.Q. Jones's massive coif inspires more interest than derision (although there is derision, no mistake about it). The film so aggressively indulges in its action sequences that it's relatively easy to ignore the wooden acting from Norris (bad) and from Leon Isaac Kennedy (worse). When I grow up I want to be just like J.J. McQuade.

MGM released ""Lone Wolf McQuade"" with an anamorphic widescreen transfer (yay!) but only a trailer as an extra. What's up with MGM and these barebones releases for old '80s action films? What, Chucko couldn't take a break from his infomercials to record a commentary track for this film? And what about Carradine? He's got some time on his hands after filming the two ""Kill Bill"" films, right? Anyway, give this one a shot if you like action films; it's cheesy, frantic, and imminently watchable.",1109894400,5,5505,4.761256544502618
1361837,5,B00004W48W,"Fellini, Bergman, Trouffaut: if those names mean nothing to you, then, buddy, you are in the right place! Now that we are among friends, let me just say the Lone Wolf McQuade is one of the greatest movies ever made! If I were sitting in my '70 GTO convertible in a Drive-in, this would have to part of the double bill. My only criticism for it is-What? No sequel!?! Now, let me count the ways I love this movie:

1. The cast-Bold and brawling Norris vs. bad and nasty Carradine.

 Outside of Kill Bill and The Long Riders, its Carradine's best cinematic work. Chuck Norris is inspired as the Lone Wolf whose workdesk is a shrine to sloppiness and whose hacienda is the ultimate machismo monument (not to mention his truck-a truly magnificent beast). Include Peckinpah favorites R.G.Armstrong and L.Q.Jones and you know they've scored a casting coup.

2. The music-Is that Ennio Morricone I hear? No? Well close enough. The soundtrack is a welcome return to the Spaghetti Western genre for this contemporary story. I wish I had gotten the album.

3. The over-all feeling one is left with-Satisfying violence (Peckinpah style), some good-lookin' fillies (Barbera Carerra at her finest), quirky bad guys (another nod to Spaghetti Westerns), a workin' class hero with extra-ordinary killing powers...dang, this is good stuff! And once again we are treated to the reoccurring theme of Chuck Norris movies: the ""system"" doesn't know it's a**hole from a hole in the ground and despite his utter disregard for the rules, our main man gets the job done and all is forgiven. This inherent truth is what connected Norris to millions of red-blooded Americans.

Now here's fodder for Q Tarentino: Take his Michael Parks character from Kill Bill back about 20 years and serve us up some more Texas Ranger hardcore chili. Maybe, just maybe, it could fill up that double billing at the drive-in with Lone Wolf McQuade!",1100217600,7,1902,4.8730650154798765

Texas Ranger McQuade must find his kidnapped daughter and falls in love with beautiful Barbara Carrera. (Their lovemaking scene in the mud with the garden hose is great). Hard to believe that a crippled dwarf can make a convincing villain, but this little dude is as nasty as they come. Beltran in an early role is equally tough as McQuade's sidekick, and the scene where McQuade is buried alive is an unforgettable classic. ""Get me a beer, kid.""

1361840,3,B00004W48W,"A rather decent action film of the early 80s where Chuck Norris' character is almost the prototype of his Walker, Texas Ranger, television character.  A good cast with David Carradine and Barbara Carrera allows for a decent film with good action sequences that keep it above your other average action duds from that time.

Lone Wolf McQuade (Chuck Norris) is, as his name suggests, the Dirty Harry of Texas Rangers, roaming the Texas badlands looking for villains and damsels in distress.  McQuade soon comes upon arms trafficers who kidnap his daugther.  Out for blood, McQuade comes to the isolated bandit's layer to start hell.  The final showdown is a martial arts exchange between McQuade and his antagonist played by none other than David Carradine (Grasshoper from the Kung Fu 70s TV series.)

This is a fun action/martial arts film with plenty of wild scenes to keep the audience thrilled.  The acting is decent and the film offers a memorable villain played by David Carradine.  A fun film to rent or own.",1093824000,,1014,4.888888888888889
1361841,4,B00004W48W,"This 1983 Lone Star state brawl has Chuck Norris, David Carradine, a really bad truck, and the scariest looking midget EVER.

Norris of course stars as Jim McQuade, a rough neck Texas Ranger who can do kung fu and drink beer. Carradine stars as a weapons smuggler who can do karate and smoke cigars. There's the conflict right there.

Classic (cliche) good guy/bad guy storyline includes:

1. Harassment from boss saying he's too dangerous and doesn't do things by the book.

2. The partner he doesn't want

3. The feds taking over the invesitgation

4. The kidnapped family member

5. Good guys take multiple shots to the gut but don't die. Bad guys die from pretty much anything.

So right there, the plotline is pretty much textbook. But let's talk about the acting!

Norris is a classic minimalist. So you don't get much from him, which is expected. Carradine probably delivers the best performance, as the cool, calculating arms smuggler. The rest of the cast is way over the top, especially the midget....the scariest midget EVER!

I don't know why this movie is so entertaining. Perhaps because it's just so low budget and ridiculous. Maybe the midget has some sort of spell on me. Who knows. So if you're a Norris fan, or just a fan of cliche action movies with plotlines thinner than David Carradine's hairline, give this gem, give it a shot.",1090800000,4,1351,4.735042735042735
1361842,3,B00004W48W,"Although the DVD release is still reasonably recent, this rough tough ""a man's gotta do"" action yarn is now looking a little dated. However, don't be too put off by the year of production, as despite the wispy plot, this is actually still a good movie that could arguably stack up to some of todays counterparts. This is the tale of Walker, Texas Ranger before he was turned into a pious, moralistic clean cut nice police officer, honed to housewife revered perfection for reruns on the Lifestyle and Hallmark channels. Gritty, tough and rough around the edges, the action comes fairly thick and fast, and the movie also has the necessary formula for the genre:
1)The hero must be in law enforcement (of some kind)insubordinate, but always right, extremely tough and be able to take unbelievable amounts of physical beatings.
2)The villian must have inexhaustible resources, a private army the size of Mexico City, and nefarious and vindictive motives.
3)Anyone close to the hero must be kidnapped, beaten, killed, maimed or otherwise visited upon by the bad guys goons. (This must also include pets, partners, dry cleaners etc)
4)The final showdown must be hand to hand combat to attempt to disguise the predictable ending, despite the availability of an arsenal the size of Fort Bragg.
Having all of these characteristics (and more) in place, and like any good Norris/Seagal style movie, fans of this sort of stuff will find plenty to enjoy. This is NOT a bad movie by any means, and as long as can plant your sense of credibility on hold for a couple of hours, this will certainly liven up a rainy afternoon. Good supporting cast, and David Carradine gives an early glimpse of his more villainous qualities, he so well exuded in the more recent Kill Bill movies. Enjoy",1084665600,,1771,4.848184818481848
1361843,4,B00004W48W,"While Chuck Norris has certainly appeared in some regrettable films during his lengthy career (can you say ""The Hitman""?), I must say that ""Lone Wolf McQuade"" is one mightily entertaining movie.  It perfectly plays to Norris's strengths, letting him to a little talking and a lot of butt-kicking as J.J. McQuade, a monosyllabic rebel who's earned legendary status as a Texas Ranger.  McQuade delivers plenty of steely glares along with punches, kicks, and bullets, and has little respect for proper procedure, but he always get his man, as exemplified by an implausible opening scene in which he takes out about a dozen Mexican border criminals by himself.  Yes, his character may be a cliche and a stereotype, but Norris plays him with admirable conviction, which is really all you can ask from him.
Perhaps more importantly, Norris actually gets a suitable foil in the form of ""Kung Fu"" legend David Carradine.  Carradine fills the villain role very well as Rawley Wilkes (cool name), a smirking, smarmy, cigar-chewing gun-runner whose martial-arts expertise is matched by his fondness for argyle sweaters.  Even if his first appearance in the movie didn't make it obvious, you'd be able to tell from one look at Rawley that he's pure evil.  Even better, Carradine is joined in his crimes by an equally amoral partner who just happens to be a dwarf in an electric wheelchair.  I'm not sure why, but that's just one of those inspired ideas that make a huge difference in movies.
The plot is rather minimal, but the makers of ""Lone Wolf McQuade"" were smart enough to give Norris fans what they want: action, action, and more action.  After all, if we wanted substance, we could watch something else.  Joined by a Mestizo partner and a renegade black FBI agent with a classic jheri curl, McQuade plows his way through a small army of inbred-looking thugs on his way to the inevitable showdown with Rawley at the end of the movie.  Naturally, the bad guys have to make things personal by kidnapping McQuade's daughter, but all that does is raise the stakes when he finally does face Rawley.  And while their fight scene may not quite match the legendary battle between Norris and Bruce Lee in ""Way of the Dragon,"" there's still plenty of impressive brutality and technique for the martial-arts buff.
While the camp factor in ""Lone Wolf McQuade"" is still pretty high, that's certainly to be expected from a Norris movie.  Yes, it's a bit dated, but those looking for some great pure action will not come away disappointed.  If you're a fan of action movies in general or Norris movies in particular, you can do a lot worse.  This is a prime entry in the ""redneck action"" subgenre.",1081382400,34,2677,4.816593886462882
1361844,5,B00004W48W,"There was a time in the west, still within memory, a time of cowboys and cops in old trucks. A time of hard men, and a hard job in a hot dusty place. This film is wonderfully evocative of old school border law enforcement, in a age that is sadly long past, run down police stations, old police cars, dirt, grit, smelly low life's and all. A time when Men were men, women hot and sizzling, and doing what was right was more important than following the bureaucratic rules of an uncaring machine. A time and place I remember... So while this is a move and over the top storytelling, I see many ghost of old lawmen and long dead crooks, that I knew when I was young and first wearing a badge.

This is one of the great `Action Movie' classics! The best thing Chunk Norris has ever done and his TV show ""Walker Texas Rangers"" is just a pale imitation of this wonderful movie. Norris is at his best in this film, but the supporting cast is just as wonderful. L.Q. Jones (Dakota), is priceless as the old Ranger, and the film is at it's best in the scenes that he is in. Barbara Carrera (Lola Richardson), is fantastic as a hot vixen in over her head.  David Carradine (Rawley Wilkes), is an argyle sweater wearing crime lord who kicks butt, somehow it works?  Jefe, Falcon, and Snow are just so perfect as criminal slime, most Lawmen will swear that they have run into them somewhere, I know I have!

The music for this picture is perfect, the open piece is so good it sets the mood for the whole movie, and I still hum the thing 30 years later!",1079395200,3,1540,4.263698630136986
1361845,3,B00004W48W,"Official Actual Rating: **1/2 (two stars and a half)
Steve Carter's (Big Bad Mama) 1983 extremely modest spaghetti western, martial arts, and low budget action hybrid, Lone Wolf McQuade, is by itself a rather remotely intriguing early eighties lackadaisical B-grade prime specimen of energetic action sleepwalking at it's most soothingly appealing and inversely blankly catatonic. Consider an imaginary high school athlete with the entire facility and anatomical ability to become an All-American yet with the small time desire to only be the school's custodian part time after-school and you generally get the bleak situation. In it's most coolly aloof, melodramatically sincere, and yet reclusive callow telling, the film represents nothing more than a passionate circular shift of narrative under-reaching for apathetic self-contentment that often seems to find narrative momentum however never fully follows it anywhere. The spaghetti western contexts of insurmountably acute mysticism (especially in the opening sequence) do raise Mc Quade (virtually superior to all of Norris's filmed efforts to date) above mere action exploitation that unfortunately never sufficiently pursue the true ambition of the material leaving McQuade rather land-logged residing firmly on the peak of B-film incomplete what-ifs that never quite completely come to fruition.
Many attest ,along with Norris himself, that his sizable popular internationally acclaimed CBS 1990's hit television series Walker, Texas Ranger was the natural substantive continuation of the themes, spiritual issues, and ideologies first addressed here. That being the case the network television remake astronomically refined, unquestionably advanced, and palpably addressed quintessentially all of McQuade's questionable issues of detail inconsistency, dramatic impotency, and chronic characterized one-dimensionality that intensely haltered this particular effort from being nothing more than routine 1980's actual fodder.
The story (what ultimately remains) revolves around the title character, renown Texas Ranger J.J. McQuade (Chuck Norris), who with typical Sergio Leone flourishes remains an all-encompassing renegade loner who's reputation retains all matter of reverence from the community, ecstatic masculine camaraderie with his former superior/best friend (L.Q. Jones, or could we say comedy relief perhaps), typically bureaucratic reservations from his new superiors, fear by his side saddled novice junior partner Kayo (Robert Beltran, of Star Trek Voyager fame) that complicates his solitary angst, and begrudging admiration from his partially aloof ex-spouse and his flourishingly attractive young daughter. As you can already speculate, McQuade is your typical Harry Callahan Alpha male on the loose for any rambling treachery or illegitimate legal disrespect that might nonchalantly mosey on down to his little hamlet of the world for some criminal jollies. The illegal gun smuggler mastermind of this piece is an egomaniac martial arts guru Rawley Wilkes who habitually taunts and impedes upon McQuade's private and professional lives at every conceivable turn that is of course until the predetermined showdown of a lyrically Fistful of Dollars reminiscent magnitude at the film's conclusion. In this case the numero uno (number one in other words) of disrespect is none other than ""Kung Fu"" television series martial arts cult celebrity (heavily misused significant talent) David Carradine (Kill Bill Vol. 1, Kill Bill Vol. 2) who makes the grandiose most of this typically campy action kitsch film by brandishing his pathologically deep eccentricities that incredibly grandly unveil misogynistic resplendent sour dimensions of sadistic grandeur to the remainder of these conventionally predictable Texan action mantra proceedings. Essentially at it's kick punctuated heroically laced center, this silver screen neighborhood of repetitious action compromises of nonexistent sweep over anecdotal embellishment summarily leave the viewer dramatically windswept towards the invariable possibilities that laid in waiting that couldn't quite trespass beyond convention onto the screen itself.
As for the DVD edition of Lone Wolf McQuade, the DVD edition contains a competently serviceable 1.85 to 1 wide-screen anamorphic presentation, a flawlessly dynamic Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono audio track, the theatrical trailer, and typically no other film related options to speak of.
P.S. When a group of Mexican police officers attempt to squelch a ragtag group of horse rustlers, always bring the precursory Chuck Norris along just in case.",1068940800,,4608,5.962235649546828

There's some martial arts in here but it's not really the centerpiece in the way that that's all there is to the movie (like other Chuck Norris films).  A perfect movie for what TBS used to call ""Movies for Guys Who Like Movies.""

1361849,4,B00004W48W,"This was, as a whole, a surprisingly good action movie starring one of my favorite martial arts/action stars.  The plot was a little...farfetched; I mean, stealing military supplies, and from convoys, no less, almost makes for a thrilling plot device.  For one who happens to be in the military, though, I just had to say ""Oh, come ON!""  Anyway, getting past that, this flick has every single thing a guy needs in an action film, and actually does a pretty fine job of it.  Let's see...we've got Chuck Norris; a saucy leading lady (Barbara Carrera); Chuck romping around with saucy leading lady; Chuck killing and/or beating up a thousand bad guys; lots of explosions, guns, and car crashes; beer, beer, and more beer; use of construction equipment for other than specified by the manual; a final, bare-knuckle, man-to-man showdown with the main villain (and, actually, David Carradine plays the role very well!); Chuck's patented ""thousand-yard stare""...oh, and more explosions and beer.  Who could ask for more?
This movie's biggest hook, of course, is Chuck Norris vs. David Carradine (Kung Fu), which to me is one of the better straight-up fight scenes in recent movie history.  Nothing terribly fancy, but the two sell some wicked-looking kicks and punches.
As far as action movies go, I wasn't disappointed in anything with ""Lone Wolf McQuade"" except maybe the plot, but hey, it's a MOVIE.  If you like action flicks as well, I'd recommend this one as part of your collection.

There was one scene where the camera aimed at the actors, you could look outside directly in the right middle of El Paso Street.  El Paso Street was well known for numerous gunfights during the Wild West.
The most famous gunfight in still wild El Paso was conducted on April 14, 1881 by a 6'4"" Marshal Dallas Stoudenmire who took  office on April 11, 1881.  Under his belt, he became the most feared and respected marshal who pulled his triggers that caused 4 men to fall dead in merely 5 seconds.  Thus forming the famed ""4 Dead in 5 Seconds"" gunfight on April 14, 1881.  Hard cored outlaws went into hiding or left town in fear of being shot by this wild, but law abiding marshal.
He was so dangerous that even the City Council was afraid to remove him because of his bruality under alcohol.  He also cussed string of profanities and threatened the City Council under the influence.  The Council couldn't make up their mind or agree with him which angers him even more.

Chuck Norris has always been criticized for his ""wooden"" acting performances in his movies, but 'Lone Wolf"" should stand as a testimonial to Chuck's acting ability. In his previous vehicles, Chuck always portrayed the clean cut all-around good guy who had to be pushed beyond his limits before he took action; not so with 'Lone Wolf McQuade'. Chuck acquired a beard for the role of Texas Ranger J.J. McQuade, is often times dirty and sweating, he ""cusses"" and even drinks beer ('Pearl' as his beer of choice).
