3883239,5,B002A5EBLW,"Being the Don Dada of the superhero set, de ol' webhead just can't stay squashed down. On March 8, 2008, SPECTACULAR SPIDER-MAN debuted on the Kid's WB, this being the wallcrawler's seventh animated TV show. And while there are some new twists, this new series remains true to the core of the Spidey mythos. This incarnation returns Peter Parker to basics and to nerdy teenhood. Pete is back in high school, and all the angst and acne and MySpace migraines that go with that. Classic themes resurface as Peter strives like mad to juggle crimefighting with school and with domestic life with his Aunt May. The Parker household suffers from financial woes. Peter is highly intelligent but unpopular at school. As Spidey, he applies science and mutated powers and an unending barrage of silly jokes to best his opponents. And, as ever, Peter clings to that hard-earned life lesson: ""With great power comes great responsibility."" Which means, Spidey is righteous, but broke.

What's new? Well, Gwen Stacy (who in the comics is Pete's other great love) becomes a regular for the first time in a Spidey animated series, and she's been revamped into this bookish, spectacles-sporting girl. She's still cute, though, and she's one of Peter's best friends (along with the ever hohum Harry Osbourne). Aunt May comes across as a bit younger and a lot hipper. Fans of Venom will recognize Eddie Brock's name, but, here, he's now a college freshman, instead of a disgraced newspaper journalist. And he's chums with Peter and Gwen. Meanwhile, Flash Thompson is still a first-class bully and jock. And if you're wondering about a certain redhead, well, she shows up later in the season, tiger.

In Spidey's personal timeline, it's only been less than a year since he'd gone public. He's still mostly thought of as an urban legend, but, geez, how badly does Daily Bugle publisher, J. Jonah Jameson, want a photo of him? Peter enters his high school junior year convinced that things for him have changed for the better since, you know, he's now got super powers (""Peter Parker is a wallcrawler, not a wallflower,"" he declares). Instants later, a popular cheerleader humiliates him in public when he asks her out on a date. Back, Peter Parker, back to dorkhood.

Spidey animated looks pretty dope and dynamic and wonderfully stylized, a bit reminiscent of how Mark Bagley drew him in the Ultimate Spidey comic book. The lean physique underscores the webhead's youth and agility, and there's even a more pronounced underdog feel as he faces off against more massively built foes. I've always found Spider-Man cartoons to be highly watchable stuff, and this one differs not, brother. Following Stan Lee's footprints, these stories combine elements of high school drama with that of gritty urban crimefighting. Season One treats us to new takes on Spidey's rogue gallery and to four interconnected main story arcs, centering, respectively, on the Lizard, the shadowy ""Big Man,"" the Green Goblin, and the infamous alien black suit. The overarching plot point, though, seems to concern the Big Man striking a deal with Osbourne in which Oscorp would develop superpowered villains to distract Spider-Man from stomping on the Big Man's criminal empire. On a personal scale Peter deals with young crush and tries to hold on to his friendships with Gwen, Harry, and Eddie. As usual, putting on the costume sabotages various relationships.

Adding to the cool factor, the show features the remarkable voices of Robert England (Vulture), Peter MacNicol (Doc Ock), and Steve Blum (Green Goblin). Bonus features include ""Spider-man: Re-Animated"" (a 14-minute behind-the-scenes look at how the show is put together) and ""Stylizing Spidey"" (8 minutes, the show creators talk about the animation process and updating Spidey to contemporary times while staying true to the Spidey mythos). The audio selection gives you the option of having the show be in English or, if you're really cool and happening, you can listen to the thing in French.

Spidey's my favorite. Grew up on him; loved the guy ever since. He boasts that combination of wicked super powers, vulnerability, and relatability. And he's an unrepenting jokester, which I dig (""My fans expect a certain amount of quippage in every battle.""). With the cancellations of LEGION OF SUPER-HEROES and THE BATMAN, it's left to gems like SPECTACULAR SPIDER-MAN, Batman's THE BRAVE AND THE BOLD, and the occasional Marvel or DC animated film release to hold it down for the fans.

Okay, Sony Pictures seems to have put a moratorium on shady shenanigans for now. This DVD, SPECTACULAR SPIDER-MAN: COMPLETE FIRST SEASON, actually features the entire 13 episode run of Season One, praise be. Must say, though, I thought it'd take longer for the complete first season to come out, so I'm a pretty ecstatic H. Bala. Meanwhile, I still have hopes for the last season of X-MEN: EVOLUTION, the 1990s SPIDER-MAN, and SPIDER-MAN AND HIS AMAZING FRIENDS to someday see the light of DVD. So here's me, waiting for that happy someday, exuding the serenity of a tai chi master, not at all about to friggin' lose it already...

Tiny plot SPOILER bugs will now infiltrate your cerebral cortex:

- Episode 1 - ""Survival of the Fittest"" - Oscorp has absconded with grizzled scientist Adrian Toomb's techflight invention. Toombs vows revenge and becomes the Vulture (or, as ol' Webhead dubs him, ""Beaky""). Meanwhile, the Enforcers have it in for Spidey.

- Episode 2 - ""Interactions"" - In an accident in Professor Connors' lab, Max Dillon meets the crap end of a bioelectrical experiment. Thus is Electro born (and dude's miffed at Prof. Connors). Also, Peter's science teacher assigns him to tutor Liz, a popular cheerleader.

- Episode 3 - ""Natural Selection"" - Injecting himself with an experimental serum in an attempt to regrow his missing limb, Doctor Connors metamorphoses into a reptilian monster.

- Episode 4 - ""Market Forces"" - Spidey versus the Shocker; Aunt May is eager for Peter to meet her friend's niece Mary Jane Watson, who has a ""wonderful personality""; Peter accordingly ducks out.

- Episode 5 - ""Competition"" - Petty crook Flint Marko, after getting nabbed by Spidey for the umpteenth time, finally gets an upgrade... and becomes the Sandman; Peter and Harry try out for their high school football team.

- Episode 6 - ""The Invisible Hand"" - Spidey makes the Rhino ask for his mama and finally learns of the Big Man's agenda against him; Peter persists in asking Daily Bugle staffer Betty Brant, who's four years older, out to his high school fall formal.

- Episode 7 - ""Catalysts"" - Peter goes to his high school formal with a stunning surprise date, but then has to skip out to take photos for J. Jonah Jameson - and also tussle with the Green Goblin (""Okay, if I were an evil pumpkin, where would I hide?"").

- Episode 8 - ""Reaction"" - Fun and crime fighting on Coney Island as Dr. Otto Octavius, never too stable a dude, finally gets his Dr. Octopus on. The Green Goblin serum begins to have a growing adverse effect on Harry. And, what? Is Mary Jane dating Flash?

- Episode 9 - ""The Uncertainty Principle"" - It's Halloween eve, and astronaut John Jameson's space shuttle flies into harm's way; Spidey tangles with the Green Goblin, the Chameleon, and an abducted Hammerhead.

- Episode 10 - ""Persona"" - Oh dear, here comes the alien black suit, looking like a hybrid of the versions in the comic book and in the SPIDER-MAN 3 movie; also, the Black Cat and the Chameleon.

- Episode 11 - ""Group Therapy"" - Doc Ock, Shocker, Electro, Rhino, Sandman, and the Vulture team up as the Sinister Six to beat the bejeesus out of de ol' wallcrawler (""Only six, huh?What happened? Lizard and Goblin have Knicks tickets?""). This may be my mostest favorite episode of the season, as a possessed Spidey puts a beat down on the Six.

- Episode 12 - ""Intervention"" - As the alien suit continues to darkly influence him, Peter flashes back to Spidey's origin story. And, finally, heeeeeeere's Venom!

- Episode 13 - ""Nature vs. Nurture"" - Peter and Eddie Brock's friendship is shattered beyond repair. Gee, you think that's connected to Venom's hate on for Pete?",1246665600,2,8175,4.918722786647315
3883240,4,B002A5EBLW,"Although I have stopped watching cartoons a while ago because every single cartoon pushed out today is beyond terrible and utterly atrocious, I found Spectacular Spider-Man to be actually worth watching and a great show. However I was not interested at first. But then I heard people who watched say it was a good show, just as good as the 90s Spider-Man(which I grew up with)or even better. I didn't watch Spectacular Spider-Man until it made its debut on Disney XD. And I must say that I loved it.

Spectacular Spider-Man is the latest in line of Spider-Man animated series. The first Spider-Man cartoon debuted in the late 60s with the 1967 Spider-man(another favorite), Spider-Man 1981(another favorite), Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends(a big time favorite), Spider-Man the Animated Series 1994-1998(another big time favorite), Spider-Man Unlimited(not very good) and the MTV Spider-Man(not so good). Spectacular Spider-Man has been added to my list of favorites along with the 60s Spider-Man, Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends and the 90s Spider-Man.

Spectacular Spider-Man is a show that's made in very good taste. Greg Weisman who created the popular Disney show Gargoyles writes some of the stories. Although I don't like the character designs or the voice acting, it has good action and follows the comics and Spider-Man himself has great fluid-like movements. It also features Peter Parker's family, Aunt May, his friends Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, J. Jonah Jameson, Dr. Curt Connors, Black Cat and Harry Osborn, and his most famous foes including the Green Goblin, Venom, Doctor Octopus, Sandman, Vulture, Rhino, Lizard and Electro.

Peter Parker himself is featured not as a bookworm that is an outcast in the whole school. No glasses, no bad clothing and no self-esteem issues like the original teenager of the comic book series. In fact, the spider he has been bit by is not radioactive but genetically altered. He of course struggles with every day life as both himself and as Spider-Man.

I,m pleased to finally see that they're releasing the entire first season. I thought it was silly to release a few episodes in individual DVDs and then later release the entire first season. I didn't even bother to buy the individual DVDs for I knew an entire season would be released someday.

Spectacular Spider-Man debuted on the CW Network and later moved to Disney XD. Although this is a children's show and is much better suited for younger audiences, teens and adults who are Spider-Man fans will love it. I myself am an adult who has been a Spider-Man fan since childhood and actually found this show to be fantastic in spite of being a kid's show. It has alot of action and exquisite fight scenes. If you love this show and waited long enough for an whole season release, then you will want to pick this up.",1245628800,3,2829,4.959915611814346
3883241,4,B002A5EBLW,"Spider-Man, one of Marvel's earliest comics characters, has been the backbone of Marvel's animated efforts almost since the beginning.  Though starting later than other 1960s animated series, the 60s Spider-Man is the only one of those shows that anyone really remembers (in great part because of the theme song).  A number of others followed, most notably ""Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends"" in the 1980s and the 1990s show (the one that I myself grew up with).  Following the latter show's end in 1998, Spidey animation went into a bit of a rut, with the outright bizarre ""Spider-Man Unlimited"" and the MTV ""Spider-Man"" faiing to capture the magic.  This is the first season (13 episodes) the latest very successful effort, overseen by Greg Weisman, the visionary creator of ""Gargoyles"", one of the classics of 1990s children's animation.  Spoilers follow.

In a departure from previous media adaptations that immediately gives the series something distinctive to operate with, Weisman chooses to set the series during Spider-Man's high school years.  The most notable previous versions were set during his young adulthood (in university, for example, in the 90s show).  For the main cast of students, Weisman draws on both the cast of the actual high school era in the comics (1962-65) (Liz Allan, Flash Thompson) and various characters from the subsequent John Romita era in college (Gwen Stacy, Harry Osborn, Mary Jane Watson); the adult cast is a kaleidoscope from every era in comics.  Minor characters abound, and, indeed, Weisman has boasted that every character is from the comics (though, in several cases, that just amounts to pasting a character name on top of an unrelated concept).  All the regulars are present, though not all of them from the start.

The season is structured quite elaborately (and masterfully), mixing the qualities of a standalone episode, a mini-arc, and a season-long arc.  Most episodes will introduce at least one new villain (most of them having appeared previously in their civilian guise).  Among those featured:  Doctor Octopus, the Vulture, the Rhino, the Shocker, and the Sandman.  Behind the scenes, major figures jostle for control of the New York underworld, originally controlled by the mysterious Big Man (who, thanks to ""Daredevil"" licensing, is not who long-time fans will expect him to be).

Our lead, Spider-Man, voiced by Josh Keaton, is rendered remarkably well.  Keaton is at least as good as Christopher Barnes on the 90s show, and he has more realistic dialogue (much less in the style of the suffocating narration of 1960s comics).  Peter is an extremely relatable character, something that is the goal of all versions of the character; he learns lessons (and, unlike in many cartoons, he doesn't forget them in time for the next episode), but not in a cloying way.  The supporting cast is generally excellent (Daran Norris is perhaps a bit too manic as JJJ; I prefer Ed Asner's 90s version; Alanna Ubach as the now-Puerto Rican Liz Allan takes some time to nail down exactly what sort of accent the character has), with standouts including Peter MacNicol as Doctor Octopus, Joshua LeBar as Flash, and Alan Rachins as Norman Osborn.

So, with all this said, why, you ask, is it only rated four of five?  The answer is three words:  Eddie Brock/Venom.  This is the only area in which the series falls flat on its face, disappointingly so given both its track record and the 90s Venom.  Eddie Brock is introduced in this version of the show as Peter's close friend, now working as a lab assistan to Dr. Curt Connors.  For much of the season, the show spends quite a bit of time giving Eddie legitimate misunderstandings about Peter's behaviour (generally caused by his activities as Spider-Man), things leading to a break with his former friend.  Then, in the final episodes, Eddie's personality changes completely, becoming a proto-supervillain before even getting the symbiote.  Eddie and the character of Venom just collapse under the weight of Eddie's nonsensical motivation.  Jarring, given how even the thugs like Rhino are handled better.  Disappointing, because Venom's actual fight scenes, like all such scenes on this show, are well-done, and the plot preceding it with Peter getting the symbiote and having his personality warped, are extremely well-done.  Had Eddie made more sense, this might have been the definitive version of the Venom story, but the 90s show's version (from which both this and ""Spider-Man 3"" draw much) still holds that title.  The problem, I guess, results from Weisman aiming to take Brock as a character to a more personal level, but falling short; the core of Brock's character, his refusal to take responsibility for the consequences of his own actions, is lost.

This is not, by any means, a deal-breaking flaw.  This remains the finest superhero animation in quite a while, one highly recommended (and the second season is even better).  I'm glad that Sony has given us proper DVD sets, though only after doing the expected ripoff releases with smaller DVDs.",1244937600,49,5060,5.071256038647343
3883242,5,B002A5EBLW,"First off this is hands down the greatest animated Spiderman cartoon ever made. I would even go so far as to put it right up there with the greatest animated superhero cartoon ever made! JL and JLU is the only other one that could even compete with this as far as I am concerned. If you are not watching this you have no idea what you are missing!
I have to admit that I have been watching cartoons probably FAR longer then a person should :) .. BUT I love animation and Spiderman has always been my favorite superhero.

As for this series .. What can I say. Spiderman of the 90's doesnt even hold a candle next to this. The animation is different then what most people are use to. Its computer generated and not the artist sketching. While it may originally seem ""awkward"" it makes for great action sequences. And trust me ... there is absolutely NO shortage of action!! But the best part of this cartoon is that its not just about the action. There happens to be great plots that are inspired by the early days of the Spiderman comics themselves and take a much more mature stance then earlier series. Words that will never be used to describe this series are Hokey or Childish. Many argue that High School Spiderman was the best era of this legacy and I am inclined to agree with it.

Dont worry tho cuz if you like Venom; its got it .. And boy does it! The fighting sequences are the absolute best I have ever seen in cartoons OR in movies. Dont believe me? Just watch Venom vs Spidey (Season 2 rematch is even BETTER). The way the brought Eddie Brock into Peters High School years and the connection between the two is absolutely brilliant. Im willing to even bet Marvel themselves wish they had made the Parker/Brock relationship like this. I just cant imagine this cartoon being any better; and thats the truth. In this series Spiderman isn't held back by Fox censorship so its punching and kicking away, and the fluidity of Spidermans movements are nothing short of spectacular!

Spider sense is there (and FULLY functional unlike the Amazing Spiderman series of the 90's) and the criminals are far less comical and pathetic.
In conclusion, I have already pre ordered this DVD and have even got 5 of my friends on board with this show. All I asked was for them to watch 3 episodes and if they didn't like it stop watching it. For the record they have now watched ALL the episodes on You Tube and admit this show is utterly FANTASTIC!",1243728000,2,2441,4.456375838926174
3883243,5,B002A5EBLW,I am so excited for this release.  I cannot believe that Sony released the dvds on four discs and now they are doing a collection.  I think that is foolish and illogical.  This is a great series and it is good to see it after the mediocre Spider Man 3 and MTV series.  I hope Sony does not do the same scheme with season 2.  The next one should be released as a collection as well.,1243468800,2,381,3.960526315789474
3883244,5,B002A5EBLW,"This release has taken way too long to come to market, but i'll gladly purchase.
It took me about half an episode to get used to this animated incarnation, but now i'd have to say it's the best show of its kind.

Remember how good Justice League was (before Bruce Timm turned later seasons into a vehicle of selfish expression)?  That's how good this show is... possibly better. Modern, but also a VERY respectful homage to classic high-school spidey. I promise if you give it a try, you'll get hooked.

A real shame the studios waited so long for the COMPLETE season release. Dvd sales can help increase awareness and offset borderline ratings, but collectors avoid ""volume"" sets like the plague. I've heard series production post season 2 has ceased, so here's hoping this set helps revive interest in a great show.",1243123200,5,817,4.73943661971831

3883255,5,B002A5EBLW,"Spider-man has always been my favorite superhero growing up, with his great powers and everyday troubles he experiences just like we do.  At first I didn't want to see this series (I have fond memories of the 90's series) after looking at its more cartoony look, but after watching some episodes, I was completely wrong.  The writing is very strong, capturing the essence of the comic's original storyline, and having a balance between pathos, humor, and action.  The actors are great; Josh Keaton makes a good Peter Parker reminiscent of Christopher Daniel Barnes from the 90's series and of Tobey Maguire's performances from the movies (the 2nd one is my favorite).  The real show stealers are the villains; Robert Englund (best remembered as Freddy Krueger) is a great Vulture, Peter MacNicol captures the sly wit and sinisterness of Doctor Octopus.  Finally the animation is actually well drawn and animated and gets you into the action.  I do have some parental warnings though; Some have said this is good for years 4 and up, but I say take the Y7 seriously.  The action can get a little brutal at times and two villains are frightening (Lizard and Venom).  Lizard's transformation is a bit disturbing, but thankfully it is brief.

3883296,4,B002A5EBLW,"Ill be completely up front going into this critique, Im one of these guys who would have told you straight up before having gone into this series that nothing coming out in 2008 could have rivaled the awesomeness that was the 1994 Animated Series.  Now that Ive completed this two-disc dvd set, I am pleased to have been wrong.  Of course the tragedy surrounding this show is that unlike the aforementioned Spider-Man: TAS, Spectacular only lived to see a pair of 13-episode seasons before its untimely demise despite original plans to have it match The Animated Series benchmark of 65.

If you're new to the Spectacular way of doing things, a few notes of interest are 1) Just like X-Men Evolution before it and Iron Man Armored Adventures after, Spectacular Spider-Man takes the long-standing characters and situations and turns them into a high-school angle. 2) The art style is deceptively bright and simplistic, especially when compared to animated incarnations of the franchise in the past.

However, I can state with confidence that neither of these facts should justify overlooking this gem (as I nearly did).  Perhaps because Peter Parkers geekiness outside of costume lends itself so perfectly to the nerdy guy at school and perhaps because overly detailed and rippling muscles have never been what this hero is about, Spectacular succeeds far better in its delivery and prose than it has any right to (and certainly succeeds over the other high-school aged Marvel franchises mentioned).

The events of the series are all based upon original comic book story threads but are presented in a manner where story-arcs are been condensed and reconfigured in order to include classic and important characters who originally appeared much later.  Another possible reason for the formulas success here is that characters like Mary Jane Watson, Gwen Stacy, and Harry Osborn are depicted not as direct equivalents to their older counterparts from the comics, but rather as characters who will in-time evolve into their respective roles.

In keeping with the theme of unprecedented attention to detail, the two seasons of the series are each set during a semester of Peter's high school year, with season one running from September to November and season two from December to March.

Now the problem with the fact that the show only went two seasons is twofold as well.  First, it becomes clear very early on that the shows creators were pacing themselves in terms of introducing larger running story arcs under the assumption that theyd have a lot more seasons to weave the larger prose together. (I for one found the Tombstone back story to be very intriguing).  Secondly, the releasing of the two seasons to the home market has been confusing and not entirely logical.

First they dropped DVD collections containing a few episodes each that formed smaller story arcs.  Then in July of 2009, the collection being reviewed here, The Complete First Season finally came out which had fans of the series hopeful a complete second season DVD release would follow shortly thereafter.  Unfortunately that never happened and in fact it was beginning to look like the second and final season was never going to get a home release at all.  Then in April of 2014 The Spectacular Spider-Man: The Complete Series was released on Blu-Ray only.  This set would contain all 26-episodes comprising both seasons once and for all.  While this is certainly great news for fans of the show, it puts those of us who purchased this DVD in a rough spot.  Our only option really is to purchase the new Blu-Ray and in essence buy the first season over again to get the second one.  Ive been burned by this technique countless times in the past.  My advice to those considering ordering the DVD being reviewed here, to avoid this mess, do yourself a favor and just pick up The Spectacular Spider-Man: The Complete Series on Blu from the get-go.

All in all though, its truly a shame that the show had never been given a chance to stretch its proverbial wings.  It manages to accomplish a lot of magnificent story telling in a surprisingly few amount of episodes.  In fact much of the backlash generated by Marvels more recent Ultimate Spider-Man series stems from the fact that it replaced Spectacular.  Perhaps IGN praised it best when it named The Spectacular Spider-Man the 30th in the Top 100 Best Animated TV Shows (even outranking the 1990s Spider-Man: TAS in the process) as well as having ranked it # 22 of the Greatest 25 Cartoons for Adults.",1403654400,,4525,4.908136482939632

3883300,5,B002A5EBLW,"Whether young or old, satisfaction is practically guaranteed with ""The Spectacular Spider-Man,"" by far the best interpretation the franchise has seen in any media outside of the original comics. Even many of those classic stories are given a run for their money with the concise, extensively plotted and realized characters and scenarios envisioned here by Gargoyles creator Greg Weisman and his team of writers. The slightly cartoonish look has unfortunately given many the impression that this series is exclusively for children, but that could not be further from the truth. Some scenes may be a bit scary for the youngest of children (which seems to be a big concern for many Amazon buyers), but like a Pxar movie the show has been painstakingly crafted in a layered fashion meant to appeal to the sensibilities of all ages. Children will enjoy the kinetic action and colourful characters, while adults will find extensive levels of depth even on multiple viewings. That said, the stylized character designs from Sean ""Cheeks"" Galloway allow for fluid and intense action scenes that no other version of Spider-Man, before or after, has managed to provide, and is a real treat to see in action.

If you are a hardcore fan, you will find almost nothing to your disliking. (And if there is something to your disliking, rest assured it is resolved in season two.) If you've never had any exposure to the character at all, you will walk away with a better understanding and appreciation for the character than many long-time fans do.",1393113600,,1532,4.984375

3883308,5,B002A5EBLW,"As you can tell by my rating and title for this review, I abjectly love this series. So to stem the tide of me gushing about it, I'm going to start with what criticisms I can manage. First, the art style isn't for everyone, and even though I do love it now, it took me an episode or two to get used to it. Second, as this is a new continuity for the character, separate from the comics or any previous show, we once again have Peter back in high school and we get the origins of his rogues gallery. Third, the opening theme WILL be stuck in your head for weeks after only 2 listens. Fourth, for comics purists, they do change some of the stories for some of the villains; but unless you cannot sleep at night unless Herman Schultz is the Shocker, I don't think it'll actually effect your enjoyment, at all.  Fifth, despite high fan approval and solid ratings, licensing and copyright issues caused the series to be discontinued after the second season, meaning the heavily foreshadowed season 3 was never made. And finally, tragically, season 2 has yet to be given the boxed set it so richly deserves! Seriously, not only was the second season arguably better than the first, but it even set up for Hydro-Man, Hobgoblin, and Carnage (see below for more details). And now that we have that out of the way, on to the positives:
-The animation is fluid and lends itself perfectly to how Spidey should move.
-The voice acting is excellent, with special mention going to Josh Keaton, who in my book now is THE definitive Spider-Man, as he absolutely owns this role.
-The writing is impeccable; the continuity is flawless, actions actually carry consequences, and many of Spidey's villains actually show up for a couple of episodes BEFORE they get superpowers and a costume, meaning that we know who they are and their becoming supervillains carries actual weight. As I mentioned before, season 2 continued this feature, and even set up for a handful of villains to debut in the third season which was unfortunately never made.
-The creator's knowledge of and love for the source material is on full display. Not only do the characters get the respect they deserve, but the sheer number of references to the characters in the comics is staggering. There are characters who are only named in passing, but those names WILL ring bells for long time Spidey fans. In fact, pretty much every name given is in some way significant to the Spidey-mythos.
-The black costume does more to Peter than turn him into a little emo. For those of us who hated the third live action movie, this is recommendation enough all on its own.

I think I've gushed enough, so let me just close out by using Peter's own words to sum up the series; it's ""the one and true Spectacular Spider-Man!""",1387152000,3,2762,4.600405679513185

Oddly, the only bad things I have to say about this show are concerning the animation. The best I can say about it is that it's serviceable. I'm not really down with the goofy top large out of proportion bodies. Nor am I down with Aunt May looking like she's 25 with white hair. Nor the lines across the arms making people look like dolls. Nor the vacant expressionless eyes. I really don't know what they were thinking to come up with any of this idiocy. Damn them! Okay, got that out of the way.

The voice acting is dead on amazing top-notch and many more positive adjectives. The dialogue is some of the best ever for any TV show. The quips and one-liners are hilarious and witty. WOW comes to mind. The character development of the villains is illuminating. I especially Dr. Octopus's story. The soundtrack is totally rockin' and adds that extra adrenaline push for the action sequences.

3883334,5,B002A5EBLW,"There is no doubt in my mind that this is the best animated Spiderman cartoon I have ever seen. While the animation may not be as exact as what was shown in the 1990s FOX cartoon show, and the background animation was not much to write about, the scripts, story-arcs and overall plots put this series up on another level. Everything was realistic concerning each character and villain (save For The Younger Looking Aunt May). The script had them all well placed within the Marvel Universe. Too, each had their own voice, thus creating an individuality that I have never seen before on an animated TV show. The actors obtained for the series were all top notch.

At first I thought that the show would be a let down. Up to that point I'd always considered the 1990s Fox TV series as the benchmark of Spiderman. No more. This series is now the Spiderman series to beat, and that will be a tough job for any future animator to surpass due to the precision of this series.

I loved how it incorporated every element of Spiderman even as it was situated with him being in high-school. The high-school Peter Parker as written in this series actually gave his character more depth, showcasing a precocious teenager while at the same time allowing his Spiderman persona to shine. The show introduced villains from the various story arcs of the comic book, thus allowing us not to get bogged down by too much continuity. This is where the show excelled in my opinion. By not allowing itself have to rigidly conform to what had come before it, the show actually reinvented itself from the FOX 1990s show as well as the NBC 1980s Spiderman & His Amazing Friends cartoon.

Yes, the 1990s FOX Spiderman cartoon has been supplanted, but it has not depreciated too much. It is now #2 on my list of animated Spiderman cartoons followed closely by the 2004 Spiderman: The New Animated Series, which was a retread of the movie trilogy, simply placing the characters between the second and third movies of the original Raimi trilogy. It was not bad, but its adult content (I'd No Problem With That At All) rubbed some women and children the wrong way. The 1982 Spiderman & His Amazing Friends show is now #4 followed by the granddaddy of them all, The 1967 Spiderman Collection (See My Amazon Review).

Buy any of these from Amazon and you will not be disappointed.

3883335,5,B002A5EBLW,"Let me just get this out of the way, I love Spider-Man. He is and always has been my favorite Marvel character. But until recently I haven't liked Spider-Man. Why is this? Well, I'm a huge comic reader and Spidey's books are bad right now. This show,on the other hand, has reconnected me with everyone's friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. The show mixes elements of the 60's (spidey signal, web armpits), ultimate comics(Eddie's his older friend, he got his powers at an osborn industries laboratory not a public radiology showing) ,as well as new ideas(Gwen's nerdy), to create what I now think of as the DEFINITIVE SPIDER-MAN. The show follows Pete as a junior in high school whose only been Spider-Man for a few months and hasn't really had any super villains yet. As the show progresses we get to see the villains introduced and plot lines created. The plot is very intriguing and mature, even for a kids show. My 11 and 8 year-old, as well as the rest of my family, were hooked. Some may not enjoy the animation style though as everyone is extremely stylized in a cartoony manner. The reason for this was that the team behind the show wanted to have the best action possible which meant a more cartoony look. Many of these looks differ from the comics and may have you thinking ewww! Or cool! But boy does the action deliver. This show has the BEST action I've ever seen in a cartoon, or on television in general. Every sequence is creative, intense, and possibly humorous (like the fight at the beginning of episode 3). Oh, and did I mention how awesome peter is in this show? This show really did a great job of capturing his genius,stress,quick thinking,and likability. Not to mention Peter's lines while fighting crime. If you listen to them carefully, you'll be laughing the entire time. I actually watched a lot of these scenes twice, once to appreciate the action, and once for the humor.  Sadly, though, this series was cancelled (what kind of world do we live in?) and we may not ever see a box set for the second (and last sniff sniff) season of this dare I say classic show. So you may want to just order the final season off of Netflix. Unless you want to spend around twenty dollars for thirteen episodes. Overall, The Spectacular Spider-Man is a must watch for any fans of tv or animation as well any fans of the comics, character, or  movies.

3883336,5,B002A5EBLW,"In the 1960's, Stan Lee and Steve Ditko created a masterpiece called Spider-man. Unlike Superman who was Jesus with a cape or Batman who was blueblood wealthy, Spider-man was an orphan who lived with his poor Aunt and Uncle in Queens. Spider-man aka Peter Parker, indeed, was that perpetual ""loser"" that Beck sang so much about. He was a social pariah in high school and was forever being exploited by his boss J. Jonah Jameson. Spider-man wasn't perfect like all the other superheroes that preceded him, he was human. All too human! His one selfish act inadvertently leads to the murder of his beloved Uncle Ben. Thus begins a guilt complex and a  personal mission to save the world. Though Sam Raimi captures the essence of Spider-man wonderfully in the movies, none of the cartoon series even came close until this one. The spectacular Spider-man DVD is worth the cost just on the quality of the last 2 episodes alone. There are quite a few changes to the mythos in this series, but this is SPIDEY! If you're a fan, you'll want this. This series isn't perfect, but its the best of the lot. Spectacular....",1338076800,,1108,4.682051282051282

Expecting to watch the first two or so episodes, I ended up completing half the series in one day.  Seriously, this is a Spider-Man adaptation you'll want to see!

Animation:  It took an episode to get used to, but you know what?  It grew on me really quickly.

Story:  Once I saw Greg Weisman's name (ie: creator of Gargoyles), I knew the story would be good.  I was blown away by how great it was, though!  The story arc's are mapped out perfectly and you really do get sucked in to the trials and tribulations that are Peter Parkers life.  Compared to the 90's version (which I liked), I would have to say that Weisman's Spectacular Spider-Man is better.

My understanding is the folks behind Gargoyles produced this cartoon.  Older animatoin fans recall that Gargoyles was the only show besides Batman The Animated series that tried to have a style. Spider-Man fan boys make take issue with the very slight influence on Anime on the character designs, but its modest and effective.

I guess if I had one bone to pick with this cartoon - as well as the films - it would be using Venom in the series.  Venom is one of the most over used and ill suited characters in the Spider-Man franchise.  A guy in a black Spidey suit with a big tongue hanging off his face -- its rediculous and tasteless (no pun intended).",1295481600,2,819,4.732394366197183

Fun, doesn't take itself too seriously and cool stories.

The action is true Spider Man style and the stories are very good and fun to watch for the whole family. I do not think there will be a 3rd season but after watching about 8 episodes I can easily say this a very good quality Spider Man series that any Spiderman fan would enjoy. Highly recommended!

There's talk the Spider-Man reboot will be slightly based off the premise of this show, which would be amazing.

The first season is under $20?  A steal, period.  This show was canceled after two seasons, which is absurd.

I loved how this show brought together all of the main poeple in Peter Parker's life for this show--Having Gwen, Eddie Brock, Osbourne and Mary Jane all in high school with Parker really added much depth to bring the viewer a great cast of characters.

3883356,4,B002A5EBLW,"It's kind of hard to believe, but Spider-Man has been around for nearly fifty years.  The character has been the subject of feature films, television, and several animated series.  This new take on the webslinger, features Spidey as a relative newcomer to the superhero scene, as a sixteen year old Peter Parker is living in Forrest Hills with his Aunt May.

The Spectacular Spider-Man is very modern, but reflects aspects from the character's early comic genesis, and has a more traditional flavor than Sam Raimi's films, or 2003's Spider-Man the New Animated Series.  Little touches like the Spidey signal, the split Parker/Spidey view, and the overshadowing web background across the sky, pay homage to traditions from the comics.  Peter pursuing Betty Brant, and Mary Jane Watson the neighbor with `personality', are also true to the comics, but Gwen Stacy and Harry Osborn are introduced early in the chronology, making them contemporaries with Flash Thompson and Liz Allan.  Incorporated into the stories are the Parker's financial woes, Aunt May's health, and Peter's troubles with girls and his peer group.  Peter's personality seems to be in line with the comics.  Because he is not accepted, and is the subject of ridicule from the in-crowd, like a dog that is kicked, Peter often reacts out of hurt or anger.  He is not a shy, uncoordinated, wimp.

The stories often feature the introduction of various classic villains, in their initial encounter with Spider-Man.  Here the episodes parts ways with the traditional Marvel Universe, as the cartoon incorporates arcs involving conspiracies, that result in the creation of The Sandman, The Rhino, and even Dr. Octopus.  The Enforcers, are the main muscle for the mysterious Big Man, a criminal mastermind, who also has an association with Tombstone, and Norman Osborn.  Osborn is very with many schemes, and also makes an appearance as the Green Goblin.  The Shocker is an impressive and skillful fighter, but Electro is given a major makeover, that is a disaster.  Doc Ock's somewhat passive personality, and poorly animated appearance, is another disappointment.  Peter Parker's involvement with Curt Connors, makes an appearance by The Lizard is almost obligatory.

Spider-Man quickly progresses from a wisecracking teenager, to an awesome fighting machine.  In `Group Therapy' he takes on a deadly version of The Sinister Six (Doc Ock, Sandman, Shocker, Rhino, Vulture, and Electro) and emerges victorious, after displaying mind-bending fighting skills.  Most of these villains are from the same era, the first sixty or so issues of The Amazing Spider-Man, published in the mid 1960's.  But in a bold step, the series jumps ahead almost twenty years, to also include the alien symbiote, Eddie Brock, and Venom.  This appearance so early in Peter Parker's life, crosses eras and requires some major massaging to bring Brock into an unfamiliar timeline, to introduce Venom.  It is a very unconventional, and perhaps controversial.  The emotional intensity increases, surreal elements are introduced, and some furious fighting takes place, leading to an exciting and dramatic conclusion, to what is a sensational first season.

The producers' lofty goal, is for The Spectacular Spider-Man to become a classic representation of the character.  Time will tell regarding that matter, but the series does show promise, and deserves credit for attempting to incorporate many elements from the original Marvel Universe.  The animation is high quality, hand drawn by artists in Korea.  It features cool settings, and does a very good job of capturing movements, particularly in some impressive fight scenes.  With stylized characters with anatomically exaggerated looks, soft facial features, and some with voices that sound childlike, the cartoon is aimed at a younger crowd.

The amount of violence is very high.  Harry Osborn's foray into substance abuse is somewhat premature, and is an element that is not suitable for young kids.  Overall, the writing is quite good, focusing on incorporating mostly traditional elements and characters.  Peter is finding his way in the romance department, and does not have a have a steady girlfriend, but most of the other significant relationships, like Peter and Flash, Norman and Harry Osborn, Peter and JJ, and Peter and Aunt May, seem to be on the right track.  Not everything the writers come up with works well, in battle, Spidey has always been something of a trash talker, but it is way overdone here.

In Nature vs. Nurture, the spirit of Uncle Ben appears, and amazingly Peter is able to discern the precise nature of the alien symbiote.  Peter often demonstrates incredible intelligence and wit, far beyond his sixteen years, but this is a bit much.  Brock's backstory of how his parents and Peter's parents both perished in the same accident, tarnishes the memory of Peter's parents, Richard and Mary Parker.  In The Amazing Spider-Man Annual #5, Peter learns that parents died in Algeria in 1949, suspected of being traitors to America, and Spider-Man investigates, battles Red Skull, and vindicates them.  With World War II over sixty years in the past, it's understandable, that the original story would not work, but was it necessary to use Peter's parents as so much plot fodder?

The two DVD set contains thirteen episodes, and two short bonus featurettes.  Although aimed at a younger demographic, this animated feature is definitely recommended to Spidey fans of all ages.",1267660800,4,5487,5.226285714285714

3883358,5,B002A5EBLW,"This show is just the greatest! Better than the previous animated shows and the film series; in fact this series makes those previous incarnations seem lame and dull in comparrison!!! I can't wait for the second season to come out, and I'm even more excited about season three!!!

The first season features Peter Parker beginning his junior year at Midtown Manhattan Magnet High School, having only acquired his powers and alias as Spider-Man in recent months. While harassed at school, primarily by Flash Thompson, he is close friends with classmates Gwen Stacy and Harry Osborn. In order to help support his Aunt May after the death of his Uncle Ben, Peter is able to get freelance work at the Daily Bugle, run by J. Jonah Jameson, by obtaining pictures of his alter-ego in action. He and Gwen are also given junior lab assistant positions under Dr. Curt Connors at Empire State University, where they join their friend and mentor Eddie Brock.

As Spider-Man uses his powers to fight against petty crime, he gains the attention of the Big Man, who orchestrates crime in New York City. With the help of Norman Osborn and Dr. Otto Octavius, the Big Man oversees development of a project to create ""supervillians"" designed to distract Spider-Man from other crimes and stop damaging his profits. However, these motives become greatly challenged as the mysterious Green Goblin enters the picture.

Throughout the first season, other opponents are introduced, including Vulture, Hammerhead, the Enforcers, Electro, Lizard, Sandman, Rhino, Tombstone, Doctor Octopus, Black Cat and Chameleon. Quentin Beck and Phineas Mason appear as Chameleon's associates. Spider-Man's symbiote black suit also makes an appearance, eventually leading to Eddie Brock's transformation into Venom.

CHARACTERS

Peter Parker/Spider-Man- Voiced By Josh Keaton: Bitten by a genetically altered spider while visiting Dr. Curt Connors' lab at Empire State University, Peter Parker donned a spider themed costume to fight crime after allowing a burglar to escape, who later killed his Uncle Ben.

Gwen Stacey- Voiced By Lacey Chabert: Gwendolyn Stacy is one of Peter Parker's best friends and an intellectual equal, not to mention harboring a crush on him. Her appearance and personality here is very different than past incarnations and appears to be partially influenced by Debra Whitman's character. She is the daughter of Police Captain George Stacy and also gained an internship with Dr. Connors at Empire State.

Harry Osborne/Green Goblin- Voiced By James Arnold Taylor: Harry is Peter's other best friend and son of ruthless industrialist Norman Osborn. He constantly lives in his father's shadow and considers Peter a good friend despite being much richer than him. Harry drops Peter as a friend after failing to tutor him twice, leading to his failure on the calculus test. However, when Norman gives Harry a lecture on self-responsibility, Harry reconsiders his decision.

L. Thompson Lincoln/Tombstone/Big Man- Voiced By Keith David (in episode 1) & Kevin Michael Richardson (in all the other episodes): As one of the main villains of the series, L. Thompson Lincoln is believed by Spider-Man to be the true identity of the ""Big Man,"" though he says he's gone by many names, his favorite being Tombstone. Tombstone is one of the few villains to best Spider-Man in a fight.

Hammerhead- Voiced By John DiMaggio: Hammerhead was originally Tombstone's second in command, and organized much of the mysterious Big Man's criminal empire, providing its face (and more frequently, muscle) in its various dealings. It was through Hammerhead that the Big Man made a deal with Norman Osborn to continue making supervillains so Spider-Man would be too distracted to stop the Big Man's operations.

Adrian Toomes/Vulture- Voiced By Robert Englund: Adrian Toomes is an elderly scientist tricked by Norman Osborn to reveal his plans for flying technology, not knowing that Osborn was planning on stealing his invention and blaming his friend Octavius until he learns the truth. After Osborn showed no remorse for his actions, Toomes donned his own flying suit and dubbed himself Vulture (based on an insult Norman had given him earlier in the day) in order to force Norman to apologize until Spider-Man stopped him.

Max Dillon/Electro- Voiced By Crispin Freeman: Maxwell Dillon was a young 20 year old electrician and a friend of Dr. Curt Connors until he suffered a terrible accident which transformed him into the supervillain Electro. Accidentally dropping his power drill on a faulty wire - sending an electrical shock through his body - he was thrown back against a tank of electric eels Dr. Connors was experimenting with. His body began to generate more electricity to the point that a protective suit was made to protect everyone around him.

Dr. Curt Connors/Lizard- Voiced By Dee Bradley Baker: Dr. Curt Connors is a respected scientist, interested in genetics. He runs a biology lab at Empire State University with his wife Martha. Although his primary interest was in lizard DNA, he also experimented on spiders, splicing together the best traits from multiple species into 'super-spiders'. It was due to his research, and in his very laboratory, that Peter Parker was bitten and transformed into Spider-Man. He employees Eddie Brock as a lab assistant and Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy as interns until Peter was fired due to 'trust issues' with his wife. Having lost his right arm in the first Gulf War, Connors had been secretly experimenting with Lizard DNA to regrow his arm. When one vial was hit by Electro's lightning bolt, it charged the DNA and slowly turned Connors into the Lizard after injecting himself with it. He eventually was cured by Spider-Man but it left him depressed about his irresponsibility from his research.

Flint Marko/Sandman- Voiced By John DiMaggio: Flint Marko is introduced as a petty crook, seen working alongside Alex O'Hirn under the Big Man. He had been captured by Spider-Man twice before the start of the series, and several times afterwards as well, usually with relative ease. Unlike his partner O'Hirn, Marko's motivation remained solely to seek out money despite Spider-Man's constant foilings, referring to his eventual goal as getting his ""big score."" Marko continued to work for Big Man as a hired hand until being selected as the first of many guinea pig-supervillains created under the deal between Big Man and Norman Osborn. He originally was to be bonded with a silicon armor, but instead he bonded with the sand particles on the floor, turning his body into a shapeshifting weapon. Now calling himself the Sandman, he creates chaos where ever he goes, robbing banks and ATMs and even an armored car. After attempting a few robberies, he faces Spider-Man in a construction site and, ultimately, Marko was defeated as Spider-Man used a tank of wet, quick-drying cement to encase him, stopping him in his tracks as a statue.

Alex O'Hirn/Rhino- Voiced By Clancy Brown: At first Alexander ""Alex"" O'Hirn is just a petty crook, seen working with Flint Marko under orders of the Big Man. He is captured by Spider-Man with ease times and time again, which increases his annoyance and hatred of Spider-Man. Unlike his partner, money is a secondary interest to him, his primary one being revenge. He later becomes one of OsCorp's guinea pig-supervillains and is bonded with a thick titanium resin armor, transforming him into a giant being who bears strong characteristics to a Rhinoceros, calling himself the Rhino. After a fierce battle, Spider-Man defeated Rhino by overheating him using the sewer's steam pipes, since the impenetrable armor makes it difficult for O'Hirn to sweat properly. Thereafter, the web-slinger asks him who the Big Man really is and learns from a mildly delusional Rhino that he is actually none other but the respected businessman L. Thompson Lincoln.

Montana/Shocker- Voiced By Jeff Bennett: Montana is the field leader of the Enforcers and is a trained mercenary. He then underwent a transformation into the villain Shocker under Hammerhead's orders. As the Shocker, he was able to defeat Spider-Man with relative ease. After realizing he didn't kill Spider-Man he fought him again at a condemned theater. Spider-Man was able to defeat him by literally bringing the house down on top of him. He was shown webbed up with his costume on the ground as the police arrived.

Dr. Otto Octavius/Doctor Octopus- Voiced By Peter MacNicol: Dr. Octavius is a research scientist working under Norman Osborn at OsCorp. He is very timid and willing to apologize for every little thing, a direct contrast to his boss, Norman. He is one of OsCorp's most intelligent scientists and the creator of a four armed harness that makes him able to do dangerous experiments, playing a part in the creation of Sandman and Rhino. Eventually, as the result of a devastating accident (orchestrated by the Green Goblin), his arms became permanently fused to his back and he was driven out of his mind, becoming the vengeful Dr. Octopus. He attacked his former employer, and then Spider-Man, blaming him for the accident which created him (believing Spider-Man to be acting out of his own desire to have revenge for Octavious' creation of the supervillains who attacked him). Spider-Man eventually defeated the menacing doctor at a Coney Island carnival.

Dmitri Smerdyakov/Chameleon- Voiced By Steve Blum: The Chameleon is an international spy-for-hire, master of disguise and a former FSB agent, the Chameleon and his partners Quentin Beck and Phineas Mason were hired by a mysterious 'General' to steal the alien symbiote from Dr. Connors' lab. After failing that mission, Chameleon began to frame Spider-Man for crimes until the combined forces of Spider-Man and Black Cat defeated them. Beck and Mason were arrested, but Chameleon disguised himself as the policeman Stan Carter and escaped.

Eddie Brock/Venom- Voiced By Benjamin Diskin: Edward Charles Brock Jr. has had a life-long connection to Peter Parker, with both of their parents having died together in a plane crash. But while Peter had May and Ben Parker to act as his legal guardians, Eddie did not have anyone to take him in. Because of this he has always carried an envious subconscious hatred towards Peter for being able to live an easier life. However, he has repressed this attitude over the years by acting as a friend and mentor to Peter, often calling him ""Bro"". When the series begins, Eddie is a freshman at Empire State University, working as a lab assistant under Dr. Curt Connors. There he is joined by Peter and Gwen Stacy, who earn similar positions through their high school science class. As the series progresses, Eddie develops animosity towards Peter due to a series of misunderstandings, often involving photographs Peter had taken while secretly disguised as Spider-Man. This ultimately damages their friendship. After Venom attempts to stalk and threaten him out of irrational vengeance, Spider-Man tricks the symbiote into leaving Eddie by pretending he wanted to rejoin with it. After successfully deflecting the Symbiote's attempt to regain control, Spider-Man captures it and dumps it in wet cement at a local construction site.

Felicia Hardy/Black Cat- Tricia Helfer: Briefly appears in the episode ""The Uncertainty Principle"", and full debut in the episode ""Persona"", the Black Cat is depicted as a simply being a thief, and her real identity has yet to seen. She possess a wit like Spider-Man does, and has even implied to have a romantic interest for him, having flirted with him every time they met.

Spidey takes the battle directly to the source of his troubles, the previously invisible hand, who has been secretly conducting his villain-of-the-week attacks. But the Big Man offers a surprising solution to Spidey's problems, a tempting offer he doesn't think our hero can afford to refuse. Will Spidey do the right thing?

Episode Seven- Catalysts: On the night of the Midtown High Fall Formal, Peter's date, Mary Jane Watson, threatens to invert Midtown's social structure. Elsewhere, the mysterious, murderous Green Goblin tries to force L. Thompson Lincoln (a.k.a. Tombstone) to step down as NYC's Big Man of crime. Will Spider-Man be able to take this new threat seriously enough - or will he be so cocky that he loses his big head?!

Episode Eight- Reaction: Peter Parker and Spider-Man learn that actions have consequences when nebbishy Dr. Otto Octavius becomes the megalomaniacal Doctor Octopus. The cause: Green Goblin; the effect: Mayhem!

Episode Nine- The Uncertainty Principle: While Colonel John Jameson struggles to land his damaged space shuttle, Spider-Man struggles to defeat the Green Goblin, who also threatens Hammerhead and Tombstone. But Peter Parker's biggest challenge will be facing the truth when he finally learns the Goblin's ""true"" identity, all on Halloween!

Episode Ten- Persona: Spider-Man gains a black costume, courtesy of the alien life form, during an encounter with the Black Cat. Meanwhile, a master of disguise, the Chameleon, starts framing Spidey for various robberies, using inventions and effects provided by Quentin Beck and Phineas Mason. Spider-Man is left with no option but to team up with Black Cat to stop his new enemy's crime spree.

Episode Eleven- Group Therapy: With Electro's help, Doctor Octopus breaks himself, Vulture, Sandman, Rhino and Shocker out of Ryker's Island prison to quench their mutual thirst for revenge. Even with his new black alien suit, Spider-Man finds his old enemies, now called the Sinister Six, are more than he can handle.

Episode Twelve- Intervention: With Aunt May in hospital and his friendship with Eddie Brock ruined, Peter finally gains enough self-awareness to realize the alien symbiote is starting to affect his personality. The struggle between Peter and the symbiote evolves into a war within Spidey's own mind, where Pete is aided by a familiar face.

Episode Thirteen- Nature vs. Nurture: Peter is in a celebratory mood as Aunt May is released from hospital, but Eddie Brock (transformed into the vicious Venom by the alien symbiote) has no intention of letting them have a happy reunion. Can Spider-Man defeat his new arch-nemesis?

My advice, buy this set. It's a great series filled with great storylines, characters, and solid action! It's worth $20, and let me tell ya, when Season Two comes out, I'll be getting it. So what are you waiting for? Buy now and enjoy this awesome series!",1263168000,5,15888,5.150116369278511

  After only a one-off appearance in the 90's series, Gwen Stacy finally gets a full role here.
  While things have been updated there are many major nods to Spidey's early days that will please long time fans. I liked it so much I actually bought the the Volume 5"" disk just so I wouldn't have to wait for the second season release to see more episodes.

3883361,5,B002A5EBLW,"I'm a huge fan of the original 90's Spider-Man cartoon and was skeptical (to say the least) when I first saw the unveiling of this new series. I'm not a fan of the artwork and I'm getting weary of the constant rehashing of Spider-Man's origins. However, after being convinced by some friends to check it out, I have to say I've been extremely pleased with this series.

First off, while it is yet another rehashing of Spider-Man's high school origins, the primary love interest for the show is Gwen Stacy and NOT Mary Jane Watson -- a refreshing return to old-school Spidey. Also, despite my personal dislike for the art-style, the animation is smooth and moves fluidly providing some astounding and often times brilliant fight sequences. They also do an excellent job of representing the characters while keeping them unique in personality and ability. The Rhino, Sandman, Venom and The Green Goblin were done exceedingly well in my opinion. The only bad thing I can think to say is that a lot of the teenage banter is very cheesy and sounds too much like an older writer trying to capture this generation's ""hip"" lingo. I can't help but cringe anytime Eddie Brock or Peter Parker call each other ""bro"".

So, quick list...

Pros:
 - Excellent fight sequences
 - Great storytelling (representing both the new and the classic)
 - Great character representation
Cons:
 - ""Hip""-lingo
 - Art-style (this one is personal, most people I talk to love the art)",1258416000,2,1452,4.826612903225806

There are some really nice spins on the regular bad guys (Electro is physically altered into electric energy instead some guy in a suit, and Rhino's suit is permanently bonded to him), as well as the overall continuing storyline of the NY underworld which is, at this point, run by the ""Big Man"" aka Tombstone.  Eddie Brock and Peter are friends whose parents died together in a plane crash, which is a departure from the original storyline, but the writers make it work.  Peter Parker doesn't always make the right decision but learns from his mistakes and does right in the end.  It is a true coming of age story that always sticks to the very phrase that Spider-man is known for...""with great power comes great responsibility.""  My son has been watching the second season on DisneyXD and the story is getting even better.

3883367,5,B002A5EBLW,"Out of all the animated shows that I've watched, few has started out of the gate with strong and compelling storylines that draw the viewer in as this show. Most get off to a slow start and build steam as seasons go on. Even all my favorite Batman animated shows started out that way, I'm afraid. Spectacular Spider-Man takes the character back to the era of Stan Lee, John Romita and Steve Ditko while giving things a fresh approach. Reimagining characters such as Electro, Doc Ock, Vulture, and others while keeping their attitude and spirit. What amazes me is how the people who make the show are able to juggle so many characters in the time allowed without losing focus of what the show is about. I'm really impressed. Some might be turned off by the graphical style of the show(as it looks geared toward younger viewers) but-believe me- it'll definitely appeal to adults as well. Extras include:Spider-Man Reanimated(which examines the show's development from plot to final animation) and Styling Spidey(which looks at how the show was updated for the 21st Century while retaining what Spider-Man is all about).

3883374,5,B002A5EBLW,"My husband, 7-year-old son, and I regularly watch this show (now in season 2) and it's one of our favorites. The writing and acting are far better than in any other animated version of Spider-Man, and the animation has its own, fluid look. Characters from different comic book eras are combined to create a multi-dimensional and multicultural cast.

Those who've complained in earlier reviews about Eddie Brock being totally different than the comics must not have read Ultimate Spider-Man, because this incarnation of Eddie Brock is obviously based on that version of the character: ESU student, lab assistant to Dr. Connors, childhood friend of Peter's, son of Pete's dad's partner, etc. Kong (an Ultimate Spider-Man character based on the series' writer, Brian Bendis) is there, too, but this series isn't any more an animated version of Ultimate Spider-Man than it is of classic Spider-Man. Situations and plotlines, while familiar to long-time Spidey fans, are altered enough to be entertaining and often twist in surprising directions.

One of the best things about this series is how likable Spidey is. He's his usual burdened, introspective, blabbermouth, wise-cracking self--but, unlike the other animated versions of Spider-Man, this time he's actually funny. No more corny, lame attempts at smart-mouthed humor; this Spider-Man actually makes me chuckle.",1249344000,,1365,5.433962264150943
3883375,5,B002A5EBLW,"As an avid fan of the comic, and the 90's series I approached this series with caution. I had heard the rave reviews saying this was the best superhero cartoon in years, and decided that I needed to give it a chance. After watching the entire season I can safely say this is the best interpretation of spider-man on any screen.
The art syle is simple, bright, and clean. The action segments flow beautifully, and are a treat to see. The villans have been reimagined without disrespecting the source material, though at times I do find some of the plot devices far to convinient.
 That however is a minor quibble in an otherwise spectacular box set, which priced at twenty dollars almost seems like a steal for the quality entertainment that you are getting. That goes for the show itself. As for this product as a whole, I found the DVD case to be rather cheaply made, and this set has no real extras to speak of, going as far as not inclusing things that were on the stand alone DVDs.
 That however does not change the fact that if you like spider-man, super heroes, cartoons, or just an entertaining, well done TV series you should buy this set.",1249344000,,1147,4.483253588516747

I'm reviewing the first two seasons here.  They appear to be digging in for the long haul on this show, but whether season three and beyond gets made depends on we the fans supporting this show.  Let's do that.

First box to be checked for a five star show: as always, characters.  Remember Flash Thompson, Liz Allan, and Peter Parker's original true love Gwen Stacy?  Front and center in this one.  Mary Jane gets to sit the early part of the show out and then plays only a supporting role.  Just as it should be.  While Marvel's attempt  to bring an adult unmasked Peter Parker back to his high school glory days of multiple romantic entanglements and identity-hiding hijinks on the printed page fell flat on it's face, ""Spectacular Spider-Man"" soars by starting over at the beginning and giving us new interpretations the characters we love that are very much true to the spirit of the classic Stan Lee stories.  For the first time in a long time, I'm actually interested in Spider-Man's love life.  He's beating charming ladies off with a stick in this one!  Geek culture has come a long way when the biggest nerd in school is choosing between the hottest girls around.  The classic villains are all here, and Eddie Brock is thrown into the mix as a friend of Peter's right from the start.  That's right, this show may be true to the spirit  of the original works, but this show will keep you surprised by adding it's own twists to the old adventures and keeping them fresh.  Many of the old villains have new origins and motivations, though none of them differs enough to cry foul aside from maybe Brock, if only because his decent into evil is so precipitous.  Otherwise, absolutely spot-on job done here.

Okay, the animation.  At first I was really turned off by the minimalist look of the art, but it really wound up growing on me.  In spite of the fact that all the characters' eyes are literally a circle with a smaller colored circle drawn inside, I am impressed at how well the character's feeling are conveyed in their facial expressions.  Aside from a very short and pudgy Doc Ock, I like all of the new character designs as well.  One thing about simplistic art: it animates really fluidly.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-The-Animated-Series/dp/B001CTXUTQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman - The Animated Series</a>&nbsp;wrote the book on that.  This one utilizes that principle effectively as well and provides the best action scenes you'll find on television right now.  He has a throw-down with Venom in season 2 that must take up literally half of the episode's screen time but is so visually dynamic that it never feels redundant.

The best aspect of a show like this one is the writing.  Spider-Man has his prodigious mouth back in this incarnation and will almost definitely make you laugh out loud as he continuously heckles the villains.  The shy and sweet characterization of Gwen Stacy, the doting of Aunt May, the arrogant manipulations of Norman Osborne, the kindness of Curt Connors, and the buffoonish bravado of Flash are all very well done.  The characters are all given a lot of life and personality, which is amazing considering how action-heavy this show becomes at times.

While the early 90's Spider-Man series is classic and did a great job of bringing watered-down versions of the comic's stories and tons of Marvel Universe guest stars, the animation has not aged well and the original comics are still better for the most part. Plus you can't even buy it on DVD. ""Spectacular Spider-Man"" gathers strength from it's original takes on the old stories and focus on the supporting cast.  The whipsmart writing doesn't hurt either.  Old-school Spidey fans will love this show. New webheads will find this is very palatable to the uninitiated and the next best thing to reading the original works.  As animated comic adaptations go, it seldom gets any better.  This is exactly how I like to see this most iconic of superheroes portrayed.",1249084800,5,5257,5.17396449704142
3883379,5,B002A5EBLW,"As a 30-something child at heart, I stil like my animated shows.  Shows like Star Wars: Clone Wars, The Batman, Justice League, Fantastic Four, Wolverine, and so forth.  So I'm always looking out for new shows that may grab my attention.  Of course, I will always give a comic superhero show a chance.  Well, back when this first season aired, it was exclusively on the CW channels here in America.  Well, none of those come in in HD on our satellite system, so I was stuck with SD picture in 4:3.  To be honest the show didn't look good.  For the low-res pic on an HD set and the fact that it was clearly rendered in 16:9 and all I was getting was a cropped 4:3 pic.  So anyway, I did DVR the episodes, but never really watched them.  I think I watched the Lizard episode, ""Natural Selection"", I think it was.  Well, I really couldn't get into the animation style and being SD didn't help matters.

So here we are just over a year after the first season finished airing and the Complete Season 1 set comes out.  I had pre-ordered it in the hopes of being pleasantly surprised.  Well, my hopes were realized and after watching it over the last few days, I have come to the conclusion that this show is REALLY well done.  Yes, the animation (or shall I say the character models) take some time getting used to, but once you do you kind of feel like they actually fit well with the surroundings.

The voice acting is great.  Got some top-notch voice-over talent there, from Clancy Brown and Lacy Chabert to Keith David.  That's one thing that has really helped post-1990 animated shows have staying power, if you will.

But I htink the most important part of all that makes this series different and unique is that the producers plan out each season as just one long continuous story.  Each episode pretty much starts off with where the previous one let off.  Which is nice, because it pretty much eliminates the proverbial ""reset button"" phenomemon that a lot of shows have.  I also like how they allude to the creation of super villains in previous episodes before they actually occur.  For example, with Dr. Curt Connors eventually becoming The Lizard by Ep. 2 and then Flint Marko being just a petty theif before he becomes Sandman in several episodes later, and of course how Eddie Brock eventally becomes Venom by the season finale while the seeds of his fate are laid in several prior episodes.

Of course, all that is due to the pre-planning of the entire season.  In the specal feature on Disc 2, you see how the writers laid out the season with a bunch of color-coded post-it notes, and how they'd move plot points around as to which episode to put them in and when.  Very clever on the part of the writers.  So then what you get is a very concise story line that carries on through 13 episodes, with very few, if any, plot-holes.

Another thing I liked about this series is the violence level.  For those who've seen The Batman series, and perhaps even the 2003 TMNT sereies, the violence level is right at that PG-13 level I'd say.  Of course it's just cartoons, but still, I don't recall any of those old classic superhero shows ever coming this close to knock-out, drag-down fights and whatnot.

As far as any flaws go, I'd say the only thing is...maybe, the chronology of some of the villian and character revealings when compared to the classic comics.  Oh, and that's another thing.  All of this stories are basically straight out of the old original comics.  But like I've said, the writers introduced a few characters before their time, only because of the time constraints with a 13-episode season.

Well, anyway, if you're in any way a Spidey fan and wonder whether or not this new incarnation of the classic figure is worthy of your time, I would have to say, definately yes.  Just hold your ears while the opening credit theme song plays as that's really the only corny part of this series, if you ask me.",1248998400,,3926,4.5127478753541075

3883381,5,B002A5EBLW,"As a kid in the 1970s, I read comics, and Spider-man was one of favorites.  But I put comics aside as a preteen and went onto other things. The 2002 live-action ""Spider-man"" flick got me interested in the Spider-man character all over again, and I picked up the first several volumes of Marvel's Essential Spider-man trade paperbacks, which encompass the beginning years of the character, from his appearance in 'Amazing Fantasy' #15 into 'The Amazing Spider-man' flagship.  Through that collection, I was able to read the old Stan Lee / Steve Ditko Spider-man for the first time, and that pretty much confirmed the fact that, though Spider-man has changed much over the years, the essential core of the character was firmly established in the Lee/Ditko/Romita years -- as were virtually all of the iconic supporting cast and villains.

Why mention any of this?  Because, put simply, ""Spectacular Spider-man"" respects the past.  It takes the character archetypes from the Lee/Ditko years (and borrows others from later years or iterations, notably 'Ultimate Spider-man') and turns them into characters believable in the 2000s.  There is plenty here for the aficionado of the Lee/Ditko/Romita Spider-man to love.  Not only the essential character archetypes, but also twists on familiar and beloved storylines from the 1960s and early 1970s, and even an occasional scene or shot that I am pretty sure was done in homage of a particularly iconic scene from the comic book past.

Yet, this animated series remains modern in the best sense of the word, and can be enjoyed by anyone who has no idea of the storylines of the Lee/Ditko/Romita years.  And for those who do know the Spider-man mythos, there are enough changes to make viewing a fresh experience.  Think you already know how a certain plotline or story arc will end?  You may be wrong, because the writers have taken liberties and even made some pretty significant changes.  I won't spoil the fun by suggesting exactly what, but suffice to say that this is hardly paint-by-numbers adoration of the past.

In this reviewer's opinion, this is all to the good.  Some may argue about the depiction of certain characters -- the Eddie Brock / Venom character seems to stand out in this regard -- but the real accomplishment here is how many of these characters feel both old-shoe-comfortable and freshly modern at the same time.  And with each passing show in the series, the character development increases, not only for Peter Parker and Spider-man but also for a number of the supporting cast, even if subtly.

""Spectacular Spider-man"" is absolutely worthwhile for anyone who has a love for Spider-man.  It respects the character, and has fun with him and his gang.  It has a good mix of superhero action and classic Peter Parker angst, romance and interaction with a core group of supporting characters -- 1960s vintage characters like Gwen Stacy (how can you go wrong?), Mary Jane Watson, Flash Thompson and Liz Allan, along with revamped characters from later years, such as Glory Grant and even Kenny ""King"" Kong, taken from the 2000s-era 'Ultimate Spider-man' comic.  ""Spectacular Spider-man"" respects its subject matter and deftly combines the iconic with the modern.  But most of all, it's great entertainment.",1248825600,2,3270,5.0427509293680295
3883382,5,B002A5EBLW,"I have been a life long Spider-man fan and have always indulged in the comics and the excellent series from the 90's. Over the last 10 years though, all forms of media have been terrible to my favorite wall crawler, until now! This series modernizes without talking down and trying to be too hip, and keeps the core things that we all love so much about the Spider-man mythos! I would recommend this to anyone who loves animation, Spider-man, or just good old fashioned fun!",1248307200,,474,4.588235294117647

Special Features said to be included in this set are so far two featurette's,
Spider-man: Reanimated
Stylizing Spidey

This is a very interesting and well done animated series take on Spider-man, my only personal issues with it were already mentioned by another reviewer who noted the mishandling of the character Eddie Brock. Previously he had been in competition with Peter Parker to get photo's of Spider-man which lead to his eventual hatred of the two when he continually failed. Here they try to make him a friend to Peter and rather than have them share the commonality of being young photographers they make him a lab assistant. In the end this first season works well overall though and should please any spidey fans.",1246838400,65,4125,5.036710719530102
