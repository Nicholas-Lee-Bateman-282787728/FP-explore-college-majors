630659,5,6303355102,"Unlike the standard Hollywood romance, this movie gives us a realistic view of people.  The characters  are quirky, neurotic, confused, and not really very glamorous.  They are also very likeable, as we can sympathize and identify with the dilemmas they create for themselves. Even as the movie pokes fun at them for their foibles, there is also a tenderness for them and the self-imposed suffering they must endure.
The plot revolves around a friendship between 2 men and a woman.  When one of the men (Eric Stoltz) marries the woman (Meg Tilly), the angst and complications begin.  Although the course of the story seems foreseeable (not a lot of surprises), the film escapes being predictable by having believable characters that are like people many of us know or could know from our own lives.
In addition, the structure is unusual....the different sections of this film were written by different writers, yet all parts do seem integrated with the whole.  Add to this the fact that the scenes are seemingly artlessly put together, so that often there is almost a documentary effect....what you end up with is an experiment in film making that doesn't require you to have a film degree to appreciate.",1025308800,20,1204,4.935643564356436
630660,4,6303355102,"This is a good movie, but the final 15 minutes are almost pure genius. the story comes to an emotional head, with some great dialogue, and superb acting, but Tarantino nearly steals the show with his cameo. Ever wondered why Top Gun is the greatest script in the history of Hollywood? If so watch this film!",1019088000,2,307,4.5

And it never disppoint me---I was always moved strongly even though I've seen it three times and now it's the fourth time. I never spent my life as this style of the people in this movie, but it's never a problem. I think Meg Tilly is a very good actor. About the great speech of a big star of director--I think it's ok or funny, just it's also abrupt putting this part in this movie.",997833600,,487,3.979591836734694
630662,5,6303355102,"I brought this film before I saw it.  I was nervous because I saw all the two and three star reviews, but now I'm wondering if they were talking about the same film!
This film is GREAT!!  Fine acting, great script, great everything!  I don't understand why this movie isn't more popular than it is!
I guess Hollywood has brainwashed people into believing romantic comedies have to be pure fluff (i.e Julia Roberts).
But for those of us who HATE the way Hollywood panders to the general public (especially where romantic comedies are concerned), check out this movie!!
Even if you're not an indie fan, if you hate saccrine sweet romantic comedies, you'll love this one!!
Its a romantic comedy with bite!",989280000,15,702,4.737704918032787
630663,4,6303355102,"This is a terrific little overlooked film,  worth watching with your mate especially if you're having problems!  Themes of jealousy and lust and friendship are mined by a top rate ensemble cast-  Tilly and Stolz  especially have a great believable chemistry-  and features standout cameos  by Parker Posey and Joey Lauren Adams. Obviously made on a shoestring  budget,  this film dares to go to those uncomfortable places in  relationships that we all experience,  but rarely see in films because of  the big budget studio whitewashing. Worth a look or two.",961286400,17,557,5.0777777777777775

7844370,4,6303355102,"When best friend Frank (Craig Sheffer) announces to Joseph (Eric Stoltz, Mask) and Sarah (Meg Tilly, The Big Chill) his married friends that he's in love with Sarah, why I don't know, I never got the appeal of meg Tilly but in this she is pretty good. This happens at a very inopportune moment for all involved, this is primarily an ensemble cast of friends with these 3 being the focus. The entire cast is very sweet and amiable and do have their quirks. Joseph and Sarah have a very strained marriage and Frank sees this so he admires her from afar until.....a party! With drinking, so bad! Anyway Frank is not all to blame, sarah has to take some of it too. Can Joseph be a toad sometimes, Sure but who isn't. We all have our warts. Anywho, 1994 brought us a terrific story with terrific actors, esp Craig and Eric.",1485993600,,818,4.3881578947368425

7844372,5,6303355102,I LOVE this film and was rapt to find it so cheap online. Only negative is the dvd doesn't have great bonus features - but it's a 90s film so I don't really expect it. The movie is very funny - a kind of alternative rom-com about a bunch of narcissistic gen Xers.,1333584000,,263,3.981132075471698
7844373,3,6303355102,"The best friends love the same female. She got married Joseph, a first who confessed and proposed leaving an open space for Frank.

The rest of a friends' circle exchange their spouses and partners either while not avoiding same gender quickies sometimes.

Well, this work leaves really a broad room for further explorations the characters might be enjoy in the future.",1318550400,2,369,5.032786885245901
7844374,1,6303355102,"This was a 70s ??? movie of very poor quality and lighting that stopped playing multiple times and had several partially skipped scenes.  Again, return postage and ""restocking fees would add up to more than the cost of the CD.",1310947200,2,226,4.65

7844376,3,6303355102,"I've been wanting to see this movie for years and just caught it on IFC. I don't remember any of the characters names, so forgive me in that area.

I want to start with a few things. There are four genuinely amusing moments in this movie; The first is in the opening sequence where one of the main characters Frank (Craig Sheffer) tells Eric Stoltz why his name is Frank (his mother had intercourse with Frank Sinatra), when one of the character's mother-in-law comes to visit and everyone finds her so boring they get stoned in the bathroom (not that, but the things they say to her is pretty amusing), Parker Posey's nude scene (nice!), and Quentin Tarantino's cameo as a partygoer named Sid who explains the homoerotic subtext of Top Gun. The movie's not a complete waste of time, but it's set up like this (forgive me, I don't remember two of the three main characters names). It opens in a car with Frank, Eric Stoltz, and Meg Tilly. Stoltz proposes to Tilly with a 10 cent ring, the movie flashes to the day before their wedding where Tilly shares a kiss with Frank. Frank is deeply, madly in love with Tilly who keeps insisting about how she's married. In many of the scenes, the characters are drunk or high; There are times where this movie is really boring, it's fueled completely by conversation (which isn't always a bad thing, but fails here);

Stoltz, Tilly, and Sheffer are good enough for their roles...But Tarantino steals the whole show in his scene. The thing that makes what he's saying better is that it makes perfect sense. The movie isn't a complete waste of time (Tarantino's rant is worth the $2 rental fee). But, another thing, for people looking for nudity or sex. There's only one scene of nudity (Posey) and it's nice, but brief.

GRADE: C+",1161648000,3,1769,4.591772151898734
7844377,2,6303355102,"""Sleep with Me"" would be completely worthless if not for a Quentin Tarantino cameo in which he riffs on the homoerotic undertones of ""Top Gun.""  That lasts about two minutes.  The remainder of the film is just dull relationship philosophy spouted by pretentious, ersatz neo-Bohemian characters. Except for Tarantino's ""Top Gun"" bit (and the twenty seconds or so when Parker Posey has her shirt off) there's nothing worthwhile here.",1138579200,2,431,5.231884057971015
7844378,4,6303355102,"This is no reflection on the quality of the film, but Sleep With Me loses its edge after ten years. It's full of witty, 90's style banter. This was a great film when romantic comedies were in. The actors were hilarious and I enjoyed Craig Sheffer for the first time ever. I don't watch a lot of his films but this one is entertaining. I saw it in 1994 and was hooked on it then. Since then my tastes have changed and I've gotten attached to other films.  This is the perfect date movie providing a realistic, comedic look at the differences between women and men and the problems that can surface within a circle of friends.",1078876800,,624,4.333333333333333
7844379,5,6303355102,"This is one of my favorite movie.  The interaction between the characters in conflict situations is so real.  I love the scene in the living room were Stoltz and Tilley start getting into it.  Its one of those scenes with dialogue flowing amongst a whole group of characters. The Umbrella scene seamlessly transitions from the realism of this movie into poetic romance that is absolute movie magic, with Tilley just lighting up the screen.  Far all the discussion about the sword fight scene, at the end of the day, the funniest part of this movie is the poker scenes with Parker and the actress from Chasing Amy.
I haven't seen the DVD yet.  Does it have any special features ?",1074902400,2,678,4.616666666666666
