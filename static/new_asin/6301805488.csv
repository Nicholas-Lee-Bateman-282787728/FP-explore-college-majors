7816058,5,6301805488,"A great family movie full of action and drama.  A superstation satelite operator high in the Alps taps into a secret transmission and the adventure begins.  This operator befriends a ten year old, Danny, who lives thousands of miles away on an island off the coast of Maine, called Vinalhaven where part of this movie was actually filmed. In the movie, Danny lives with his mother in the lighthouse, which can be visited today on Vinalhaven.  It's a really good exciting movie for the entire family and a high recommend.",1224547200,3,520,4.7555555555555555
