8703450,4,B00TZ6Q6YY,"I'd been curious about this DVD for some time, so I recently borrowed it from the library.  As a yoga teacher myself, I enjoy including balance work in my classes, and so I wanted to see what instructor Caley Alyssa had to offer here.

I'm not positive, but I believe that the three practice segments offered on this DVD were originally classes offered on the Udaya web site.  Alyssa says ""welcome to Udaya"" at the start of the main practice, and their logo remains on the screen throughout all three routines.  The Main Menu offers options for Balance Class - Bonus Quad Class - Bonus Core.  I have described each in detail below.

BALANCE CLASS (40:05 minutes)
In this main class, Alyssa is teaching live with one student.  She begins in boat pose, moving on to a challenging variation of alternate straight leg drops.  Coming to standing for chair pose, she alternately lifts one knee into the chest, spending quite a bit of time here.  Transitional postures include standing forward bend, plank, side plank, downward dog, and upward dog.  Alyssa performs several standing sequences, including warrior 2 with a heel raise/triangle with both arms extended/half moon; chair/warrior 3/standing splits/handstand prep; and eagle/extended hand-to-big toe/revolved half-moon.  The practice concludes with bridge and a reclined twist; there is no shavasana.

BONUS QUAD CLASS (20:55 minutes)
Here Alyssa performs specific quad stretches in a variety of different yoga positions with a class of five students.  She begins with hero's pose with a block.  Coming to hands and knees, she adds the first quad stretch (tiger pose), and then moving up to a lunge, she cues a lunge with a quad stretch.  Bow pose follows, and then the quad stretch is performed in downward dog.  The final postures are camel, half lord of the fishes, and quad stretch in side plank.

BONUS CORE (3:05 minutes)
Not really a class per se, this section offers what Alyssa calls a ""teaching tip.""  Using a student to model boat pose, she explains how good form in boat is important to standing balance.

The main practice on this DVD had a nice variety of poses.  Although Alyssa had an encouraging manner, she herself is clearly super-flexible, and she did not really provide much information for those who are balance-challenged.  Rather than a DVD to help with balance, Yoga for Balance mainly offers experienced yogis a practice to work on standing yoga balance poses, and I would recommend it for this purpose only.",1470528000,2,2486,4.956521739130435
8703451,5,B00TZ6Q6YY,"Cary's review is spot on. Just adding a different angle. After being in exceptional shape,  I broke my ankle 9 months ago and developed a sport's related hip injury on my right side. Since then, I've been falling and having great deal of balance problems. I found some Level 1 balance DVD's that left me unchallenged. Thank-you Caley Alyssa and Udaya for making a great, fun Level 2/ Intermediate DVD that works on balance.  The description says it's 3 practices of 20 minutes. Actually, it's a 40 minute practice with bonus sections. The practice flew by. I loved Caley so much that I joined the Udaya website, which is also fantastic.  I am certain this will help my injuries with continued practice and will be sure to update.

I see my mother having balance problems, and it hurts. It's an imperative part of fitness that sometimes is ignored. Until I broke my ankle, I had never given it much thought. My goals had been strength, flexibility and speed.  Now in my mid-40's, I'm discovering balance practice necessity. I'm going to buy the other DVD's in this series, since I so enjoyed this one.",1440115200,5,1100,4.678756476683938
