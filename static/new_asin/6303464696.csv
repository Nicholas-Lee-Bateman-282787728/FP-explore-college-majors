658916,3,6303464696,"Since the plot has been described in several other reviews, I'd like to concentrate on the sumptious behind the scene areas this film does so well in.  First, the coloring and use of it are marvelous; notice the brilliant red dress that sets the lovely Jennifer Daniels apart from the other party guests; the way Edward De Souza's hat matches his wife's riding outfit; the detail to the architecture in both the hotel and the chateau; the gorgeous and sinister music by James Bernard that director Don Sharp incorporates into the scene where Barry Warren plays its seduction to Daniels; and the effective use of wind and rain.  This movie, first released in 1963 as Kiss of Evil, is not one of Hammer's best productions, but it is a rich, diffuse entry into the vampire genre, and Clifford Evans (looking a little like a middle-aged Sean Connery) has a malignant ferocity in his Van Helsing-like role.
Not a classic, but definitely for fans of the Hammer days!",1082937600,6,960,4.74251497005988
658917,4,6303464696,"In Kiss of the Vampire, we have quite an interesting movie.  Released in the early 60's by Hammer Studios, it's a gothic vampire movie without Peter Cushing or Christopher Lee.
The movie, set around 1905, starts off with a funeral scene, and then progresses to a young couple traveling by car.  They run out of gas, and end up in a creepy little town staying in a creepy little hotel.  The feeling that something is seriously wrong permeates the scenes, but the young couple, who we find out are on their honeymoon, seem to take little notice, but I think that can be explained to them being newlyweds.
They soon make the acquaintance of the Ravna family, a very well to do and prominent family within the small town.  The Ravna chateau is full of opulence, almost to the point of decadence, in comparison to the surrounding environment.  The head of the family, Dr. Ravna, played by Noel Willman, puts forth a sinister aura, one that seems to be the source of most of the unease within the movie.  The secrets slowly begin to reveal themselves, and the audience, if patient, will find the rewards to be many within this film.
What I found most interesting in this movie was how vampirism was linked to not only venereal disease, but also the occult.  In the film, we find a small society of vampires, while most vampire movies would suggest these creatures of the night to be more solitary, more territorial.  Not so in this film.  He we see a group come together and a definite hierarchy in place.
The sets, costumes, scenery...it all comes together nicely.  The actors all play there parts very well, and the direction is excellent.  There is not a lot of blood in this movie, but there is just enough and in the right places coupled with a slow build of tension and suspense to make this a very effective film.  I felt throughout as I was watching a movie made by real craftsmen of their trade, an above average entry into the vampire film genre.  The scene with the costume ball was really enjoyable as the suspense underlying the entire film really started to surface here for me.  My only squabble was at the end.  I was hoping for something a bit more spectacular, as the build up lent me to believe, but it was at least satisfying, none the less.
Absolutely no extras here, not even a trailer, but there are atleast chapter stops, and the film looks excellent for its' age.  The audio, also showing the films' age, did suffer just a little from the `snap, crackle, pop' syndrome at some points, but was otherwise fine.  I am glad I picked this up when I did, as it seems to be going out of print.",1074902400,12,2605,4.485169491525424
658918,4,6303464696,"Unusual Hammer outing has a honeymooning couple staying at a quaint inn and invited as guests to a mysterious count's castle. What they don't know is the count and his family are vampires. The count has his eye on the pretty wife(Jennifer Daniel from ""The Reptile"") and hypnotizes her to come to him when he summons her. The count presides over a cult of vampires who meet at the castle at night. Adequate production values and haunting theme music make this odd vampire tale quite eerie. Interesting aspect of vampirism as a ""cult"" is a nice touch. Ending has often been cut for TV and some other prints as ""Kiss Of Evil"" but the tape and DVD are the original uncut British versions.
The reason being the cult are attacked by bats and it's quite effective. Highly watchable.",1035590400,12,775,4.6231884057971016
658919,4,6303464696,"""Kiss of the Vampire"" is another one of those Hammer films where a hapless couple becomes entangled with the blood-sucking undead.  This time around it is Harcourts, Gerald (Edward de Souza) and Marianne (Jennifer Daniel), an English couple on their honeymoon just traveling through Bavaria when they run out of gas.  The Harcourts are rescued by Dr. Ravna (Noel Willman), who sets them up in a local inn amongst the nervous natives and invites them for dinner at his chateau, where we meet his children Carl (Barry Warren) and Sabena (Jacquie Wallis).  Of course, all of the Ravnas are vampires, even though they apparently can run around during daylight hours and eat regular food.  When the Harcourts attend a masked ball at which all the other guests are members of Ravna's vampire cult, Gerald is drugged and Marianne spirited away.  Fortunately, Professor Zimmer (Clifford Evans) is on the scene to do battle with the vampires.  ""Kiss of the Vampire"" begins with its best scene, in which the Professor interrupts his own daughter's burial to ensure she does not rise again.  Unlike his colleague Van Helsing, Professor Zimmer is not above using black magic to give the vampires back a little of their own.
Certainly the script for ""Kiss of the Vampire"" is one of the most cliched produced by Hammer.  What hurts the film the most is that Noel Willman just underplays the role of the head vampire way too much.  In contrast, Isobel Black in the minor role of Tania, steals her brief scene.  Don Sharp, who directed this 1963 film, starts off the film with a great scene and wanted to end with something equally shocking, but rubber bats are never going to cut it, even with Hammer's reputation for low-budget effects.  ""Kiss of the Vampire"" is an above average vampire movie from Hammer despite the fact it offers neither Christopher Lee's Dracula of Peter Cushing's Van Helsing.",991440000,3,1884,4.85625
658920,5,6303464696,"Hammer's KISS OF THE VAMPIRE must rate as one of the best of the Hammer films. For sheer eerieness, it has to be in the Top 5.  The scene where Ravna's son plays the piano never fails to send shivers down my back, and  the vampire girl (the daughter of the owners of the inn) who was kidnapped  and made into a vampire by Ravna, is really evil looking. Does anyone know  who she is or anything about her background? The final scene where  thousands of bats attack the cult of the vampires in the Ravna chalet, is  truly gruesome. It is a wonderful period piece, very realistic and the  casting is brilliant. Five stars for this one....and don't forget to wear  your cruficix!",951436800,18,675,4.387096774193548
658921,5,6303464696,"I had heard of this film for quite some time before I actually saw it, and I would have to say that it was worth the wait. The film follows a young couple who get stranded in a mountain village where a cult of vampires rule and thrive. The female lead Jennifer Daniels catches the eye of the head vampire Noel Wilman, who launches a plan to pull her into his ""family"" and erase her past history. The film has beautiful sets and scenery and overall strong acting. The conclusion is not bad, but is a little rushed. This is one the best non-Dracula vampire films made and probably the best Hammer film without Cushing or Lee.
The above is when I reviewed the vhs version, I have since bought the dvd. The dvd is a beautiful print, it brings out all the colors of this classic. Unfortunately it has no extras, which is a shame because I think they easily couls have gotten a trailer and a still gallery together.",943833600,,909,4.321637426900585
658922,3,6303464696,"I was a little disappointed by this legendary Hammer Horror. It's one of the few so-called classics from the studio I wasn't familiar with beforehand, so naturally I was looking forward to finally seeing it. There  are some atmospheric scenes; the car sequence at the beginning in  particular, but it's actually a pretty dull movie. Nothing much happens for  almost an hour, but a lot of boring squabble. (-""The Reptile"",  also featuring the great Willman, is a masterpiece compared.) Director  Sharp gives the film a somewhat cheap, almost TV-like, look. The famous  bat-attack at the end is also a bit of a let-down, almost laughable. In  many ways it's strangely unlike a '63 production, looking more like one of  Hammer's early 70's quickies. A ""3 stars"" rating is probably a  little too nice.",942710400,,797,4.932330827067669

659055,3,6303464696,"Kiss of the Vampire is a reasonable Hammer film from 1963, that is hardly ever shown on TV these days (which you could say about many Hammer films), and its that fact that made me want to get the film on DVD.

A honeymoon couple are travelling through Europe in an early horseless carriage that runs out of petrol. Finding there way to a local village it turns out that the Ravna family whilst initially very friendly have exceptionally large teeth!

There are some really good moments during the lavish ball where the couple get separated. After the ball the Husband awakes back at the local Inn to find everybody denying he ever had a wife, which creates a great sense of paranoia. Quite why he wasn't just killed I'm not sure.... Whilst the sets are basically cheap, they do manage to maintain a sense of grandness. You could see what Hammer were trying to do but they just didn't have the budget.

On the acting front Clifford Evans is good as Professor Zimmer. He is reminisent of Andrew Keir (Dracula Price of Darkness, Quatermass and the Pit) in many ways, and his use of black magic is quite a radical shift away from the standard vampire hunter. Sadly Noel Willman as Dr Ravna (effectively Dracula) is not up to the same standard. Hammer have done their best to make him look like Christopher Lee but it doesn't work. He doesn't have the phsyical presence of Lee (who was 6' 5"" in the 60's) and frankly looks a bit impotent by comparision.

The ending of the film hints at more explicit things to come from Hammer, which would reach its peak in the early 70's with the Karnstein films. This is also available as part of an 8 film region 1 boxed set, which is much more worthy of purchase than this film is on its own.",1193443200,,1726,4.435331230283912
659056,1,6303464696,"When people think of Hammer Horror's vampires, they think of Christopher Lee being dispatched by Peter Cushing. Too bad that those wonderful actors weren't in ""Kiss of the Vampire,"" because they might have salvaged a tepid vampire flick that descends into silliness by the third act.

Honeymooners Gerald and Marianne (Edward de Souza and Jennifer Daniel) run out of gas near a rural inn. They end up staying for the week, and are invited to the chateau of Doctor Ravna (Noel Willman) for a masked ball. But when a drugged Gerald wakes up, he finds that everyone -- even the innkeepers -- deny that Marianne ever existed.

Desperate, he ends up going to the peculiar Professor Zimmer (Clifford Evans), who agrees to help him, since he has a personal vendetta against Ravna. But to get Marianne back, the two humans will have to tackle a whole castle full of evil vampires -- and somehow break Ravna's hypnotic hold on her.

The travellers-get-attacked-by-undead plot is pretty much a cliche by now, and it feels stale even in ""Kiss of the Vampire,"" with its paint-by-numbers plot and bland acting. It has most of the Hammer staples -- rich settings and evil vamp cults -- but the plot is both ridiculous and very, very slow.

At first it's easy to be swept away by the vague menace of the vampires, and the sumptuous castle they live in. Unfortunately by the third act, it's deteriorated into dozens of panicking vampires running around in nightgowns. It's as silly as it sounds. The climax goes even further with lots of thunder'n'lightning black magic, and about six hundred rubber bats.

And the cast cannot salvage the glacial plot,. Daniel and de Souza do what they can, but their characters are such blithering idiots that it's hard to care; Evans does a good job, but his character is too thin. Willman tries hard to be Christopher Lee's Dracula, but he can't manage the same feral, sultry quality. He just looks embarrassed.

""Kiss of the Vampire"" follows the formula of Lee-Cushing movies with none of the quality, eroticism or intelligence. One of Hammer's lesser vampire movies.",1149120000,2,2089,4.837535014005602
659057,5,6303464696,"Chris Lee and Peter Cushing's battles through several of Hammer's Dracula films really burned into people's thinking that Hammer Vamps meant these two in their clash of the Titans - Dracula and Van Helsing.  However, Hammer did a handful of vampire flicks with a more sensual quality, like Lust for a Vampire and this gem, The Kiss of the Vampire.  Because viewers  missed the formidable presence of Lee and Cushing having at it again, I think this film was rather dismissed.  It really needs a second -- and third -- look.

It's moody, atmospheric with a sensual quality stronger than the Lee-Cushing Drac flicks.  I think it's mostly undermined by Noel Willman as the head vampire.  Had they had someone of the raw sexuality of the commanding Lee, this likely would have been considered one of the best Hammer Vamps.  Willman just does not imbue the film with that pull -- the repulsion against the bloodsucking ways, but the power that draws against all.  He just doesn't put it over like Lee.  But then few men could!  Alas, where was Ian McShane when you needed him?

Willman is a nobleman - what else - over a tiny hamlet where he is actually doing rather better than Drac ever did.  His castle is richly appointed and full of fellow vamps.  Old Noel has his own Vamp Camp going.  Naturally, the villagers live in terror as not only do they have a master vamp in residents, they have to fear all his vamp friends, too.  Rather a large drain on the locals.

When a young honeymoon couple's car breaks down outside the castle, they come under the control of the evil vamp Count.  You have the counter balance of evil with Professor Zimmer played, again, with less flair than Cushing, by Clifford Evans.

Despite Zimmer's warnings the couple come under the control of the Vamp master and his cronies, who have decided the young bride would make a delectable feast and new member to Happy Vamp Camp.  Zimmer is fairly strong as his Van Helsing type role than Willman is as head vamp.  The plot while predictable is lavishly filmed, complete with costume ball.

Because the lack of the two Hammer legends and the ""we've been down this road before"" causes people to initially dismiss the beauty of this film.

Give it a chance.  Don't compare it, just judge it on it's own merits, and I think you will find it a richly done, impressive film that is very underrated.",1126656000,5,2365,4.6028708133971294

At night a coach arrives with a visitor, the couple is invited to dinner by Dr. Ravna. Mr. And Mrs. Harcourt meet his adult children. [The movie runs on slowly with predictable events.

A policeman hears his complaint. Theres no proof of his claims, no record in the hotel register. He goes to that doctor and hears about his family. Can he rescue his wife? Tanya offers help. Take me to her! But she takes him to the Ravna family instead. Marian no longer loves him. Tanya will initiate Mr. Harcourt; but something goes wrong. He runs away with Marian!

7848068,5,6303464696,"""Kiss of the Vampire"" is a 1963 British vampire movie made by Hammer Films. Though lacking in big name stars like Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing, the movie has plenty to offer the discerning viewer, especially in terms of aesthetic values.

The movie opens with a somber funeral scene which turns into a scene of horror when a drunk man, whom we later learn is a Professor Zimmer (Clifford Evans) does something shocking to the coffin containing the corpse. The focus then moves to a pair of newlyweds, Gerald Harcourt (Edward de Souza) and his lovely young wife, Marianne (Jennifer Daniel) who are motoring their way through Bavaria. Having run out of gas, they stop at an old hotel where they are eagerly welcomed by the proprietor. Later that evening, they receive a dinner invitation from a wealthy local, Dr. Ravna (Noel Willman) and make his acquaintance as well as his children, Carl (Barry Warren) and Sabena (Jacquie Wallis). The newlyweds are charmed by their hosts and consent to attending a masquerade ball where things go horribly awry and the young couple find themselves ensnared by a manipulative vampire and his cult of followers who aim to make Marianne one of their own.

What elevates this production from some of the other vampire flicks out there is the almost perfect blend of aesthetics and atmosphere in this film. Color plays an important role in this film - Marianne is beautiful but her costume choices are exquisite; she is offered one of Sabena's dresses for the ball and it is this stunning red piece that makes Marianne the focal point at the ball and one almost can't take one's eyes off her. Carl's adept piano-playing skills draws Marianne in the first night the couple visit Ravna and his kin. His playing seems to particularly affect Marianne who almost seems to go into a trance as if bewitched. Cues like these tell the viewer that Marianne has already been marked for special 'attention'. The sets are gorgeous and the over-the-top opulence isn't out of place when one considers the hedonistic and decadent lifestyle led by Ravna and his cult.

Ravna as played by Noel Willman is not your typical classic horror vampire with the cape, the red eyes, the furtive nightly assaults under cover of dark. Far from being the demonic-looking monster that skulks around in the night, preying on hapless females in the guise of mist and night creatures, this head vampire is cloaked in sophistication and gets what he wants in more subtle fashion. The actors portraying the newly-weds are not just nameless, one-dimensional victims but real characters that the viewer comes to care about. The drunk professor may be no Van Helsing but the fact that he had lost a loved one made him a sympathetic character and made his intense hatred of the cult all the more believable.

That is not to say the storyline is not without its flaws. The whole ""let's dupe Gerald into thinking we (the vampires) know nothing about Marianne"" seemed a tad incredulous (but hey, it is a vampire movie), and the dark ritual at the end seemed a bit cheesy, but the overall artistry of this production trumps everything else and makes this, in my humble opinion, one of the most beautiful vampire films ever made. And it gets better with each viewing :-)",1380844800,3,3261,4.797153024911032
7848069,5,6303464696,"Released in 1964 when Hammer was at the height of their creative powers, KISS OF THE VAMPIRE has never really received its due. This is primarily because the film doesn't feature Hammer regulars Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing. To make up for their not being in the movie, Australian director Don Sharp creates a highly original film full of artistic touches that make it stand out from other Hammer films of the period (he would later do the first 2 FU MANCHU films w/Christopher Lee). His use of foreground objects in several shots recalls the work of lengendary director Fritz Lang (M, METROPOLIS). The opening sequence of the village funeral creates a somber and appropriate mood before the arrival of the father of the dead girl. What he then does is quite startling especially if you've never seen the film. From then on the movie unfolds at its own pace more like an episode of MASTERPIECE THEATRE than a horror film. The early sequences in the chateau highlighted by the playing of the mysterious piano music are a textbook example of the use of background lighting and editing along with the use of sound. The masked party scene would influence Roman Polanski's set piece in THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS. As the familiar story progresses to a highly original ending you realize that you've seen something out of the ordinary as regards a Hammer film.

Many other reviewers find fault in Noel Willman's head vampire but I find him extremely effective especially as he's not trying to be Christopher Lee. While he doesn't have Lee's screen presence, he (and screenwriter Anthony Hinds aka John Elder) create a character who is more charming and subtle making his transformation all the more effective when it finally occurs. The basic storyline is lifted from Universal's THE BLACK CAT of 1934. Young couple on their honeymoon are stranded in Europe and wind up in the residence of a cordial yet malevolent host who is the head of a cult. The characters of the young couple (Edward de Souza & Jennifer Daniel) have more personality than usual so thet we care about what happens to them. Vampire hunter Clifford Evans is no Peter Cushing but he brings a focused intensity to his part much like Andrew Keir would later do in QUATERMASS & THE PIT. In fact there are other things in KISS OF THE VAMPIRE that look ahead to future Hammer productions. The ritual near the end of the film is like a trial run for the one in THE DEVIL RIDES OUT. The lack of regular members of the Hammer stock company anticipates HANDS OF THE RIPPER (another Hammer favorite of mine). KISS is an excellent example of how when Hammer chose to step outside the box, they could still be just as effective.",1380153600,3,2686,4.714893617021277
