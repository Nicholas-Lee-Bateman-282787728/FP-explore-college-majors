8289575,2,B001CU9DOG,"April 17, 1897, a silver-colored cigar-shaped object maneuvering at an estimated 100-300 mph crashed into a windmill in Aurora, Texas.  Fragments were thrown down a well, and a child-sized alien body buried in the town cemetery.  Numerous prior sighting had been reported in the days prior.  The Dallas newspaper article author had been known as a prankster.

UFO investigators went to the site in 1973 and found a fragment 95% aluminum and 5% iron - difficult to make.  Further research - digging up the grave-site (marker since removed) and looking down the since covered-up well was blocked by the town.

That's it - not much to go on.",1225843200,,638,4.861111111111111
