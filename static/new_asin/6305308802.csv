1007420,4,6305308802,"The Man With Two Brains is a comedy that should appeal to any fan of classic horror, Steve Martin or Carl Reiner.
Steve Martin plays the most brilliant brain surgeon in the world, Dr. Michael Hfuhruhurr, inventor of screw-top surgery. Written by Carl Reiner, Steve Martin and George Gipe, directed by Reiner, The Man With Two Brains delivers laughs a-plenty. Co-stars include Kathleen Turner as a deliciously evil siren and David Warner as a rival scientist with an enviable collection of brains in jars.
It's a five-star movie but a four-star DVD because of the lack of widescreen.",1007078400,5,582,4.948979591836735
1007421,5,6305308802,"Like some Shakespeare (Midsummer Night's Dream) and Caddyshack, this move exists in itself and there is nothing of any worth outside it, while you watch it. By far Steve Martin's best movie.",992131200,,190,4.96875
1007422,5,6305308802,"Hysterically goofy comedy.  Watch for the ""Pointy Birds"" poem, which still makes me crack up, and the Austrian drunk driving test.",986515200,,130,5.190476190476191
1007423,4,6305308802,"I hadnt seen The Man With Two Brains until having seen some of Martin's work that followed this movie such as Planes, Trains, and Automobiles, Parenthood, and Dirty Rotten Scoundrels. I had gotten used to Martin's comedic style being more oriented towards situations and not necessarily slapstick so I was pretty surprised when I watched this movie and saw that it was mostly joke and not situation oriented. This is a funny movie, not the funniest ever by Martin (Planes, Trains, and Automobiles is in my opinion), but is definitely good for some laughs. As might be expected by a movie named The Man With Two Brains it is VERY silly! If you're wanting easy going and carefree humor this is a good movie, but if you want something that isn't so silly I'd recommend watching something else.",979948800,,790,4.731884057971015
1007424,4,6305308802,"Both Steve Martin and Kathleen Turner are wonderful in this absolutely bizarre comedy.  Martin's early films are still his best.  He did some  great work with Carl Reiner.  This and ""Dead Men Don't Wear  Plaid"" are classics.",965347200,3,224,4.945945945945946
1007425,4,6305308802,"This movie is a little silly,but so many laughs. The DUI test is a classic,also Turner making Steve wait for sex,and were his hats at,then the  broken window,and Steve says,""Nice Breeze.""It just gets more  stupid as the movie goes on,but your still laughing. I saw this movie last  week in the hospital while recovering from Abdominal surgery,and some heart  problems during the operation. This film really helped while waiting for my  test results from my heart test. Thank you Steve and Carl for getting me to  laugh during my stay at the hospital,along with my Sister Janie,my best  friend Jay,Uncle Bobby,Aunt Ella,Dan,Sharon,and my favorite cousin Tim,you  are apart of my recovery also.",962755200,2,692,5.116071428571429
1007426,3,6305308802,"This is a nice Steve Martin movie, with some good laughs. It's enjoyable and funny. Not the funniest thing ever, but certainly not bad. I'd give it 4 stars.
The DVD is the simplest I've seen. The sound is in mono (! ),  there are no special features, no subtitles, nothing. There is a scene  selection menu, which is entirely textual. There's supposed to be close  captioning, but I have no idea how to get at that. I wish they had normal  subtitles.
In short, there's a reason that this DVD is inexpensive, but  this doesn't detract much from the enjoyable movie (except that I would  have liked subtitles, as English is not my native language, and having  things spelled out helps).",952041600,24,684,4.557377049180328

1007428,4,6305308802,"The first time I saw this film I couldn't stop laughing. It has taken me many years and a few TV viewings to finally get around to buying it. Thankfully it is still as good as ever. Who can forget the lake scene? Or  Steve Martin's character searching for a suitable body? I like the idea  that the film focuses on someone who falls in love, quiet literally, with a  woman's mind and not her body. It is a pity that all of Steve Martin's good  films were made during the 80s - I hope that he rediscovers fun for the OOs  (?)
This is a good transfer, the picture quality is excellent. My only  complaint would be the lack of features - trailers for other Steve Martin  films?",931046400,3,674,4.178294573643411
1007462,3,6305308802,"Warners have decided to reissue on blu-ray for first time ever THE MAN WITH TWO BRAINS
the only effort warners have given for this new blu-ray reissue
is new 1:85:1 HD transfer which actually does look amazing quality, No grain No Dirt much better quality than the old dvd version
and new 2.0 master stereo mix which beats the old Mono sound mix anyday
EXTRAS, well tragically no new extras
eg new interview with Steve martin, Kathleen turner or Director Carl reiner would've been Great atleast, but obviously warners didn't bother
the only extra is the original Trailer which is also in new HD quality
apart from that a new HD transfer & new HD Trailer is all warners Gave for this classic comedy
pretty pathetic effort, it's excellent that the film has been given new HD transfer but should've been given
new retrospective featurette aswell, amazon are selling this for $20 it's only worth $10 in my opinion
i give 2-3 stars for this new blu-ray based on lack of new extras but an excellent HD transfer",1504310400,3,1004,4.646067415730337

1007719,5,6305308802,"I got this DVD because I'd heard good things about ""My Blue Heaven,"" and because some of the scenes in ""The Man With Two Brains"" kept coming to mind at odd moments, making me laugh. Now that I've enjoyed watching both of these movies on this two-sided DVD (each movie occupying one side), I'm deeply grateful that I got this DVD, because ""My Blue Heaven"" is wonderful!

My Blue Heaven is the only movie I've seen Steve Martin doing an impression of a mafioso, and he pulls it off brilliantly. In fact, this deserves to be known as one of Steve Martin's best movies ever! The plot involves Steve Martin's character, Vincent Antonelli, a New York mobster, being relocated to the New Jersey suburbs as ""Todd Wilkenson"" as part of a witness protection program. Much of the ensuing humorous situations stem from the assorted problems his character gets into with the local police and local judge, and the way he is repeatedly excused from criminal activity by the man assigned to look after him by the FBI, played by Rick Moranis. This is a true romantic comedy, with the local DA (played by Joan Cusack) falling in love with the FBI protector, thanks to a good deal of assistance from Vinnie. Truly a classic!

The Man With Two Brains is campy, good-natured comedic fun. Steve Martin plays the role of a brain surgeon who's invented a novel way of ""unscrewing"" peoples' heads to more quickly access the brain. He falls in love with a beautiful woman he accidentally (and literally) runs into, who is actually not nearly as nice on the inside as she appears on the outside. Martin's character falls in love with a brain in a jar while traveling on business to Europe, and a great deal of comedic mix-ups and some intrigue follow in this very unusual love story.

The movie had a very ""cartoon"" type feel to it - with some scenarios being quite ridiculous (but still fun!)

It's not the greatest film I've ever seen.  The dialogue was weak and awkward in places and sometimes it was just a bit too strange for my tastes.  But it's a fun movie anyways.  One I'll keep, although not one I'll want to re-watch too regularly.",1364342400,,753,4.068027210884353

This film displays the considerable talents of the former as an experienced director and the latter as a still young comedian making a solid mark in film after success in Television. In addition to their major primary contributions, they made up 2/3 of the writing team. The plot is outlined in Amazon's lead review leaving me only to emphasize that Martin is given ample latitude for his still fresh physical comedy as well as his ability to get off the comic line. He is excellent. So, too, are the many sight-gags built into the scenic design in a Marxian (as in Marx Brothers) and (Buster) keatonesque fashion. As Martin's beautiful but vicious wife, Kathleen Turner does all that could be done with the role. Supporting cast does its thing commendably with Estelle Reiner (Mrs. R.) making a very brief appearance as a victim of the elevator killer (which allows a familiar face to be seen in a Hope-Crosby sort of cameo). For those concerned about such matters, there are several brief (and funny) bits of sexual innuendo but nothing at all raw in today's terms.

Each time you will find a new comic detail...including the name of the window cleaner used to kill people (""Pane in the Glass""). Steve Martin and Kathleen Turner are a comic pair made in heaven. Martin shines as Dr. Michael Hfuhruhurr, the surgeon who invented the Screw-Top Zip-Lock Brain Surgery Technique. His beloved first wife is already dead; with his car he accidentally hits the wickedly beautiful Delores Benedict (Turner) who has just tortured her rich husband into having a fatal heart attack. The Doctor saves her with his surgery technique and then marries her, under the delusion that she is a sweet woman. She tortures him by witholding sex, sleeping with the hired help, and showing no respect for all that he holds dear. While on a European honeymoon that will hopefully spark their first sexual encounter, the Doctor meets Dr. Alfred Necessiter, a scientist who can transfer the knowledge from a disembodied brain into another body. And where do these dead bodies come from? Why, the infamous European Elevator Killer, of course! The reveal of his identity at the end of the film is sheer comic genius. The Doctor discovers how evil Delores truly is, while at the same time, he finds that he has a telekinetic connection to one of Necessiter's brains in a jar. How it all comes together at the end is perfection. Martin's extremely dry delivery and love of physical comedy is matched by Turner, who doesn't mind getting down and dirty (literally...as she is pushed into the mud when it is learned that she is truly a scheming witch only after the Doctor's inheritance). It is difficult to do justice to this comic masterpiece with a summary, so all I can say is get it! However, this DVD edition has a few major strikes...there are NO extras...not even a friggin' theatrical trailer. The picture is also cropped to full-screen (modified from the original widescreen). On the plus side, the picture is excellent quality. Hopefully at some point Warners will do justice to this film and put out a special edition.",1202256000,3,2157,4.848238482384824

*When Steve Martin comes home and Turner tells him she fired their gardener Ramon, Martin asks why, and she says he came up behind her and grabbed her breasts.  ""He was measuring for a new hood ornament.""

*When Martin comes home and finds a man examining Turner's butt, he is furious and orders the man out of the house, who just happened to pay fifteen thousand dollars for the honor of adoring her fanny.  In a rage, she says ""You never wanted me to have a job of my own.  A career of my own.""

*When Martin and Turner engage in a fight, he kicks her in the groin area and she quips, ""Ow..right in the balls.""

There are more great lines, and Martin and Turner's delivery is sublime; I'm not sure they would have been as good if delivered by other actors.

1007935,5,6305308802,"Probably the wackiest comedic collaboration between Steve Martin and writer-director Carl Reiner (The Jerk, Roxeanne) where character is more important than looks after all.  Although presenting a witty analysis on relationships and what's most important in your significant other, this is probably the most tongue-in-cheek the pair would make; delving more into slapstick themes and plots than those of intellectual or situational comedy motifs.

Steve Martin is Dr. Michael Hfuhruhurr, a reputed brain surgeon who can actually transplant brains by using his innovative screw-top method.  The widowed doctor is lonely and eventually marries the gorgeous but heartless and money-hungry character of Kathleen Turner.  The doctor soon becomes disenchanted with his cold-hearted wife and falls in love with a detached brain (voice over by Sissy Spacek) he finds in a creepy Austrian scientist's dungeon/lab. What will he do to give this sensual brain a host?

Again, although the film is still very much a humorous psychological/sociological study typical of most of Steve Martin's comedies, this is probably the closest to slapstick one will find in his films.

Anyway, Steve Martin stars as Dr. Michael Hfuhruhurr, a world-renowned brain surgeon, who has developed a new method of brain surgery called the cranial screw top method.  It involves unscrewing the top of a person's skull for easy access and much faster recovery time.
Suffering the recent loss of his wife, he accidentally hits a woman named Dolores, played by Kathleen Turner, with his car.  She suffers a massive head injury, and Steve Martin is the only one who can save her.  She also bears a remarkable resemblance to his deceased wife.  He saves her, they fall in love, and get married.  Only problem is she is a conniving, cheating, lying, evil woman who's main interest is money and infuriating her husbands, making the veins stand out on their foreheads.
During their honeymoon trip to Europe, Dr. Hfuhruhurr meets a fellow scientist who has perfected a method of keeping brains alive in jars.  During a visit, one of these brains, that of a woman, begins to talk to him, through telepathy of some sort, and they develop a relationship.  Realizing his feelings are growing for this bodiless brain, he drifts away from his wife and even begins scheming to replace his wife's brain with that of Anne, the brain in the jar.
There's a lot more, but that's the gist.  This is a very funny sci-fi comedy movie, in the vein of a Young Frankenstein, but not as good.  This is what I call 'old style' Steve Martin, the more rowdy, raucous, animated Steve from the old days of SNL and The Jerk, before he became more refined and sophisticated.  I still think he's funny now, but I just never got into that whole Father of the Bride/LA Story comedy.  Lots of sight gags, some slapstick and profanity, and a little nudity, which give this movie an R rating.  No extras, no wide screen format, but still a lot of fun.  A good, stupid adult comedy with one of my favorite lines that I think only Steve Martin could have delivered as well as he did which is the quote I used in the title of this review.",1058832000,21,2351,4.509433962264151

1007996,5,6305308802,"""Into the mud, scum queen!""
I hadn't seen this film for about ten years, and yet that line had stuck with me forever.  This movie has SO many memorable moments, many of them gloriously ridiculous, many sublimely subtle. Martin, in his early films such as THE JERK, was all over the map, mining for humor.  Low humor, physical humor, verbal humor, satire, it didn't matter as long as it might be funny.
This is a low budget movie with some delightfully twisted moments.  Martin plays famed brained surgeon, Dr. Huffarahrr (or something like that) who marries one of his patients, the beautiful (but evil) Kathleen Turner, hot off her great role in BODY HEAT.  The movie's plot is hardly important though...it mostly revolves around brain surgery jokes and humor at Martin's expense because he is so desparate for intimate relations with his wife, who is mostly hoping he'll die so she can take his money.  When Martin falls in love with a disembodied brain (don't ask), things just get weirder.  (The brain is voiced by Sissy Spacek, by the way.)
That summary probably doesn't make much sense, but the main thing to remember is that the movie is funny.  It feels a bit like a TV movie in its production quality, and it's opening credit style and background music firmly date this movie to the early '80s.  And there's a HUGE Merv Griffin joke, so you'd better know who Merv Griffin is.  Much of the joke is ""low"" humor, but it's so well done, so over-the-top, that you can't help but smile.
Man With Two Brains is hardly a work of genius.  It isn't as solid as ALL OF ME or PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES, which are slicker films with true hearts...but it is good, dirty fun for 90 minutes.  Martin is very funny and we are reminded of his early ""glory days"" as the nation's hottest comic.  Kathleen Turner is a hoot, and it's fun to remember what a bombshell femme fatale she was.  The usually reserved and impeccable David Warner (Titanic, Time After Time) gets to get a little unhinged here, and that's fun too.  There's a guaranteed laugh about every 60 seconds, so that's a lot of laughs.  The movie is VERY inexpensive now, so I heartily recommend taking a look.
Word of warning...the DVD has NO extras.  Just the movie.  Also, it is ""R"" rated, and deservedly so...there are some funny but dirty bits here.",1055635200,5,2311,4.611246943765281
1007997,5,6305308802,"This is pure Steve Martin insane, silly fun. Directed by Carl Reiner (that's Mel Brooks partner and director Rob's pop).
We join Martin, as world famous neuro-surgeon Dr. Michael Hfuhruhurr (pronounced huff-ehrr, or something like that!), the inventor of the 'cranial screw-top' brain entry. He's recently lost his wife, who he idolizes, but soon enough he meets fortune hunter Dolores (Kathleen Turner), who's only after him for his money.
The story has us following Dr. Hufrfrfrrrrr (see, no one can pronounce it correctly!) through ridiculous situations, typical of Martin's comedy. From a strike of elevator operators in Austria, to a castle inside an apartment, to that damn cat! Lots and lots of hysterical moments arise. Martin is great as a dumb, gullable man, while Turner is at her bitchy best.
If you want to spend a couple of hours of brainless (regardless of the film's theme!) humor, then you won't miss with The man with two brains. Definetely Martin's best...",1052870400,,975,5.1

TMWTB comes at you like a runaway train, hitting you with an unrelenting series of ridiculous situations and gags. The first time through I had to actually stop the tape twice because I was laughing so much I was having difficulty breathing.
This is classic Martin and a landmark in modern comedy. Only Woody Allen can possibly rival Steve for sheer lunacy. In Two Brains he is also backed by a stellar supporting cast, including a stunning and vampish Kathleen Turner (looking for a new man to torture) and David Warner as Doctor Alfred Necessitor. Yep, pretty well all of the names are utterly ridiculous.
Everything from the dysfunctional hotel elevator, which stops four feet short of each floor, forcing Steve to crawl out, to the hooker with the mind-numbingly abrasive voice (Duke duke duke duke of oil, oil, oil...) just keep you reeling and seriously wondering if you will survive to the end.
This is nothing less than a work of art and one of the best comedies of any type in the history of the known universe. For people who have never seen it, I truly envy you. You are in for the treat of a lifetime. It still slays me after all these years, but the first time through is just devastating.

Dolores simply knows how to torture men in this movie. And, Steve Martin as the brain surgeon is her most evident and first hapless victim.
I'm still not even totally sure what my captivation is to this movie but the characters in it seem to have the ability to make you want to keep laughing at them over and over again. I thought the movie even reminded me a little bit of a D.H. Lawrence type situation. The film did smack of 'Lady Chatterley's Lover', but that was just my take on it.

1008004,5,6305308802,"Once upon a time, back in the 80's, there was a physical comedian of such brilliance, such intelligent silliness, who made movies like this. Alas, that silly guy has all but disappeared in the tamer '90's. Of course, I'm talking about that wild and crazy guy Steve Martin. This is, by far, Steve's funniest movie(besides The Jerk). He plays a prominent brain surgeon who falls for a gold digging hussy(played seductively wicked by Kathleen Turner). Once the new wife shows her true colors, our beloved doctor falls in love with a ""special"" brain he finds in the lab of a mad scientist(David Warner). Where else would he find it?. He can hear the brain's thoughts. The voice of the brain supplied by Sissy Spacek. It shows how much a man can fall for a woman's mind, rather than her body. Martin is a master genius. That much is true. He delivers one of his most memorable comedic performances. Kathleen Turner is wonderfully bitchy in the role. Who else is more suited?. The gags are silly and some are over the top. But, it works. Martin has a knack for making simple things laugh out loud funny. He also has a way of making silly things look downright intelligent. He can make walking down the street funny. That's the sign of a true comedian. Carl Reiner directed this comedy classic. Watch out for the 'Elevator Killer'. It's one of the better jokes.

Twice as boring

Dr. Michael Hfuhruhurr (Steve Martin) has a problem choosing between brain waves, Anne Uumellmahaye (Sissy Spacek), and ""Body Heat"", Dolores Benedict (Kathleen Turner). The whole premise is can love be found in a bottle.

I thought `The jerk' was bad until I saw this movie, both mysteriously directed by Carl Reiner. All he does is make faces with no real acting or thought behind them. A few faces are o.k. but over an over of watching grins and grimaces can get monotonous. I almost stopped watching Steve martin that is capable of making good movies like ""Housesitter"" (1992) with Goldie Hawn.

My Blue Heaven

""Take my keys, take my gun, take me""

I am not going to go in to details, of the movie ""My Blue Heaven""; however the story line is about Vinni, (Martin), as a New York City gangster enrolled in the witness protection program. He is sent to a seemingly innocent town, Fryberg. A FBI agent (Rick Moranis) is assigned to look after him. The agent is a recent ex-husband due to his overly systematic behavior.

While attempting to keep Vinni out of trouble the agent meets an interesting district attorney (Joan Cussak). She also is an ex with two kids. Vinni seizes the opportunity to help the agent and the attorney gets to know each other better and in the process helps Barney the agent loosen up a bit. On the side he seizes much more with the help of his (old) new friends. Will anything come of the agent/attorney relation ship? Will Vinni find a home or is he destined for incarceration?

See Steve Martin a little more down to earth as n architect in ""Housesitter"" (1992).
