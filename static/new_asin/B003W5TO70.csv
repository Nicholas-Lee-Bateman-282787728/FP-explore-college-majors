Geniuses?

Not compared to Brendan Small.

This show is utter and sustained brilliance. Be aware that you only get one disc with the blue ray and that it probably does not enhance the experience much over the DVD version because, well, it is a cartoon. But I like this show so much I paid for blu ray anyway. If you liked the first two seasons, you will enjoy this one too.",1290816000,6,423,4.5394736842105265
4213245,4,B003W5TO70,"If you are a fan of the show, odds are that you will like season three of Metalocalypse. There were  a lot of times that I really laughed hard and some of the funniest scenes of the series happens in this season. It definitely is a different spin to the series since it very rarely mentions the Illuminati, but they are still there. Instead, this season does focus on character developement and shows a lot about Pickles, Toki and Skwisgaar's childhood past. It's a great season, but the biggest downfall is that the band doesn't play on every episode like they did in the previous two season. So, you don't get an awesome Metal song every story. That's the reason I give this season a four.",1290470400,4,691,4.484126984126984
4213246,4,B003W5TO70,"I am absolutely addicted to this show, and still re-watch season one and two regularly, so I ordered this as soon as I could.

This season isn't as good as the first two, it's also pretty different, although it's still brilliant at points, especially the Hamburger Time episode. Season three seems to focus a lot more on character development, which I support and very much enjoyed. Each character has their own episode, with their own songs, even Dr. Rockzo. My favourite episode was Rehabklok and made me love Pickles even more.

The season finale was amazing, nice to see some actual plot, although the cliffhanger is going to make waiting for the next season a bitch.

The special features are also really good and fun to watch.

The uncensored swearing takes a while to get used to and in a way, I prefer the guitar riffs but eh, it's not bad, I'll probably get used to it.

One thing, my copy had a rather large rip in it. This could be because I imported it to the UK but I'm quite annoyed at that...",1290124800,12,1007,4.451086956521739

All it has become is vulgarity plus nudism. I thought the show was about the ""metal+Apocalypse"" not lets go MTV with this garbage. Way to get lazy Brendon. Don't waste your money on season 3. Seasons 1 and 2 kick ass, but season 3 is straight fail.",1289779200,15,401,4.506849315068493
4213248,5,B003W5TO70,"Metalocalypse is one of the funniest shows around. A smart and extremely funny satire of the music bussines. This season the episodes are longer (20 min) which makes them more interesting, and consequently even better. Toki, Nathan, Swisgaard and Pickles are great, but the show has only one real star. If there is any justice,  William Murderface will go down as one of this centuries'  greatest comic creations.",1289433600,23,413,5.0588235294117645

If you've ever trailed the fence of death metal, this show can actually make you a fan of that style music.
It's outrageous, and filled with situations that are out of this world insane, but all in all.... it could be a very good depiction of people who are so rich, they don't know what to do with all of their money.

Just buy it, and Watch it, and Love it!

That is all

I loved the ""conspiracy"" briefs we got with the general, holyman, etc. where are those?(about half way through s3 so far). They elevated the humor of this series a lot by portraying these idiot celebrities to the role of to be feared world leaders. This season just shows typical rock band stuff with no enemies on the scale of the conspiracy group. These are much less brutal as well. Where's the extremism that made this series so good?
Where are the awesomely over the top concert performances?

My only compliant about it is that there is about double the amount of swearing as in the previous seasons.

4213323,1,B003W5TO70,"It suffices to say that this season hasn't the slightest shred of the superior quality of the previous seasons. Simply put, it has become embarrassingly sloppy.

The background setting with the world leaders and the ""demon guy"" seems to have been put on the back-burner, just when it was getting interesting.

In the first two seasons, the members of Dethklok were distinct, quirky, and cleverly written. During those seasons, it was amusing to perceive the characters' simplistic ideas and the warped little reality they live in, particularly their obsession with (and perception of) ""brutality"".
Instead, in the third season, the writers are EXTREMELY lazy, just having the characters constantly blurting out F-bombs and such. Crude language and nudity don't really add anything to the quality or comedy of the show; I can imagine that this would amuse immature teens.

The hilarious and facetious use of violence is at a minimum in season 3.

One thing that made the show unique was the music. I enjoyed turning on the subtitles and reading the lyrics, which were amazingly hilarious. Without subtitles, the lyrics are unintelligible. For season 3, either the producers of the DVD/BD release felt it was okay to not add the lyrics in the subtitles, or (worse) all the vocals are wordless.

Being so sloppy, the episodes are rather boring. Even worse, they're twice as long.

4213331,2,B003W5TO70,"I love Dethklok. I watch the show on Adult Swim, I watch my dvds with my girlfriend and buds, and I listen to the Dethalbums in my car. However, season three has been a giant letdown.

The box ships with only ten episodes, compared to 20 and 19 for seasons one and two. While many say this is due to the extended length of the episodes, you are still missing out on over an hour of material comparatively. Not to mention to lack of variety in topics and setting.

I didn't find the episodes as funny or entertaining as the other seasons. Simply put, I was simply not amused most of the time. An important difference I noticed by the end of the series was the lack of good music as well. Many songs are performed only for a few seconds without any dialogue or with unintelligible lyrics (as shown by subtitles). Also, the plot fails to make a leap forward by the end. In fact, the main plot barely moves at all.

The hidden and special features are also a letdown compared to the other seasons. The very few ""hidden"" features are boring scenes of general crozier moving down a long hallway or a man vacuuming a room. Riveting! The special features are barely any better, most being extended scenes from the episodes involving mindless chatter or way overdone conversations that quickly become boring.

I fear that the creators of this show have run out of material and plot. Unless some vast improvements are made, this show is dead. I'll have to live with the fond memories of what was, and what won't be again.",1313884800,5,1511,4.463768115942029

4213333,2,B003W5TO70,"Season 3 had its moments but overall it is by far lame. The first and second season are hilarious and full of witty remarks and shows great character. It also helps in identifying what makes Dethklok; Dethklok. The third season just has a bunch of lude, crude and grotesque comments and the dialogue is supar at best. It also has an extreme amount of adult content. What made the other seasons so great was the blurs, the bleeps and the run around on what they were actually referring to. I absolutely love this show and have the first two season memorized by heart. I was thrilled for the third season and when I finally got to see it was throughly disappointed with it. I know these guys can do better.",1304380800,6,704,4.423076923076923
4213334,5,B003W5TO70,"A few individuals dislike season 3 as opposed to seasons 1 and 2. The story is only growing and there is more dialogue. I suppose the poor reviews come from the same element of people who prefer for shows to not develop and be repetitive. Thats the reason most shows don't even get a full season. Repetition.

If one can't let animated characters grow, how can anyone expect for them to allow anything evolve?",1302307200,2,409,4.527027027027027

4213336,3,B003W5TO70,"2010 was more about Brendan Small touring as Dethklok than focusing on the actual cartoon that brought the band to fruition.  The first 4 episodes aired followed by a 6- to 8-month hiatus before closing out the season. The show's principle arc, that of the secret government/illuminati conspiracy, all but disappeared. Season 3 also marked the move to a 22-minute per episode format after experimenting with the last two episodes of season 2. Sadly, none of the full episodes in season 3 matched those at the end of season 2. Each episode has its share of laughs and were enjoyable in their own way, but they just didn't live up to the first two seasons. Hopefully the popularity of Small's live band will wane so he can focus on what brought him success in the first place: the cartoon.",1298246400,4,787,4.661870503597123
4213337,5,B003W5TO70,"UNNGH. The art for this series has really skyrocketed as far as quality and style goes. The backgrounds, especially, are some of the most detailed pieces on television. But that's not why people love this show. The uncensored aspect didn't detract anything from the show whatsoever. I think that the lack of censors made it more realistic - less like watching a reality show. In reality people swear and get naked every day without sound effects or floating black boxes. We also got a lot more back story and character development. Both of these things together lead me to think that we're supposed to be looking at them more like actual people and less like obvious characters.

Of course they're just as hilariously stupid, messed-up and selfish as they've always been, and tons of fans are still brutally mashed into people-paste ...but that's why we watch this show, eh?

I don't even have to recommend this season. If you've watched and bought the first two, you're going to buy this one.",1298073600,,993,4.8011695906432745

Metalocalypse is my favorite t.v. show. It displays death metal at where it should be. I've always thought death metal needed to be more popular than it is. This season displays death metal at first class, not last class and hardly know to society, only if it was really like this in real life, it would be awesome to me. It would be fun to be in Metalocalypse land. The Dethalbums are great too. This is an awesome show, and I hope it's around just as long as The Simpsons have been.

4213342,5,B003W5TO70,"I'd read the reviews that people didn't like this season because the guitar riffs were taken out that were used to censor the f-word.  I'd read the reviews where they said it wasn't as good as the other two seasons because it was shallow or offensive or just plain stupid.

Am I one of the few that loves this season the most?

While I miss the guitar riffs that played during each use of profane language, I didn't really care either way that it wasn't included in the new season.  It's not essential to the plot or anything.  I did notice that certain male body parts weren't censored, which the first time watching the episode I gave an 'OMG!' gasp but it's not anything thats going to ruin the show.

I noticed that this season spent more time with character side stories.  The other two seasons focused on Dethklok as a group, but season three explained why Toki likes Dr. Rockso so much, or why Skwissgar whips out his guitar and fast plays when he's uncomfortable, why Pickles drinks so much, etc etc.  You really start to understand each of their little idiosyncrasies and love them just a little bit more.  I must admit I absolutely hated the Dr. Rockso episodes from seasons 1&2, but I find that I like him now, he seems a wee bit less annoying [or maybe he's still annoying but now he's funnier?].
You also find out the fate of Charles [the manager], and when you find out what happened to him, it really sets the plot for future seasons, and BOY I can't wait!!",1294704000,5,1472,4.4222222222222225
4213343,2,B003W5TO70,"I was really disappointed with this season. Not that I crave images of brutal violence and sometimes I was a little shocked but, I've come to expect it with this show. And they've seemed to have replaced the brutality scenes with more of Murder Face, Toki and Dr. Rockso screeching and whining! uhg, please give that crap a rest. Even Pickles was more whimpy and whiney this season. And, what happened to the conspiracy sub plot with the government/military/powerful mysterious dude? That was awesome and I hoped it would develop into something more intense and complex but instead it just fizzled. And there didn't seem to be much in the way of concerts, or at least big ones or mentions that they are the most powerful/richest organizations on the planet. It's as if Dethklok has gone the way of real world mega bands and stopped producing exciting original material and touring the biggest areanas and are just rehashing old material in local clubs on weeknights.

For reference two of my favorite episodes are the Season 1 finale and the Season 2 opener. Seems like they peaked at the end of season 1 and the beginning of season 2. Here's hoping they'll turn things around for season 4!!!!",1294444800,11,1193,4.763285024154589

4213347,3,B003W5TO70,"I agree with a couple of reviewers here - the series is funny as anything, I'm a huge fan, but Season 3 has taken a turn towards more profanity that can really curb your enjoyment of the DVD.

The unrated version doesn't cover them up with the pinch harmonic sound effect, so we are left to endure an endless barrage of swearing by the characters. It really gets very distracting and is totally over the top.

Still, it is very funny, the music will blow your mind, and the series finale is spectacular.",1293321600,5,503,4.397849462365591

The 1st and 2nd seasons contained relevant material that made ""Metalocalypse"" original- fresh ideas, direction, hilarity, and blood & guts.  As for the 3rd season, the more I watched, the more hugely disappointed I was.  NO laughs.  Just a whole lot of none-stop needless cussing, sex, and.....well, nothing else.  There is really nothing else that can be said about this season.  FAR from brilliant.  The show has now run its paint with the rest of the brainless crap on tv.
