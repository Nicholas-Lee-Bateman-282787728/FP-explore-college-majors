7893819,3,6305758743,"I purchased this video because they filmed some of it in my home town.  My brother and I worked on one of the sets and got to watch them filming.  We were just teenagers at the time so it was great fun.  About half the town appear in the film as extras, so it has some nostalgic value to anyone from or with family from Rio Vista, CA.

Of particular hilarity to me are a couple of bathroom scenes (don't worry, PG at worst) One of which I saw them film where an accidental movement by one of the actors caused the whole set to crack up.  The moment worked and they kept it in the film.  Look for the guy trying to gets his drawers up while being confronted by the bar owner.  Either Forest Tucker or Max Baer, Jr. got their hand stuck in them causing a laugh-out-loud moment as the poor fellow repeatedly tried to lift his pants.  Though his reaction is pure acting his attempts to lift his pants and failing repeatedly were real.  I don't believe you can actually see what's causing the problem in frame, but from my vantage point and from the discussions after the take I am aware that this occurred.  Don't know if that makes this moment any more entertaining to you, but thought I would share it.

The second scene, that is dear to me, is with my uncle Alphonse in, again, a bathroom scene.  Hired as an extra they allowed him this speaking role because his reaction on camera was entirely genuine.  He's at the urinal when someone busts through the door to announce yet another fight is in progress.  The fellow next to my uncle turns towards him and the result is predictable.  What you don't see is the stage hand pouring beer down the leg of my uncle and the camera catching his reaction.  He had no idea they were going to do this.  He was not an actor and his surprised expression is pure Alphonse.

The movie, on it's own merits, is not that good.  It seems like it's one fight scene after another.  Well, that's pretty much what it is.  Not a lot of plot, just plenty of low budget action.  If you want to see it you'll likely have to buy it or borrow a copy because I never seen it in a video store.",1324425600,,2112,4.214463840399002

This is one of the great epics of the 70's. With the score, the empire, the multitude of familiar character actors, and lots and lots of drinking and fighting and a taste of The Quiet Man, this is a film you just cannot ignore when tallying up the greats of the oddball 70's. OK, so its not in the same league as The Godfather but its still pretty damn good.

The colors on the DVD are amazing, this transfer is tight. And the musical score will astound you. This may be a one star flick in a lot of people's minds, but the score sounds like a Henry Mancini or a John Williams was in charge. You've got to check this movie out, it's crazy man.",1123372800,4,673,4.129770992366412
7893821,4,6305758743,"Jethro Bodine's literary talent, Corporal Agarn's running buddy from F-Troop, Robby, AND Uncle Charlie from My Three Sons, the midget from High Plains Drifter, Frank Nitti from St. Valentines Massacre, the Baker from the Godfather,Madame Queenie from Amos and Andy, the Indian's manager from Major League, and the Creature From the Black Lagoon's leading lady??? Trouble with a capital ""T"" that's what by doogies!
We begin this lovely trip through the last bastion of stereotypes that the mention of which still gets a laugh, instead of a cap being popped in your a$$....the white Southern male. We begin with Forrest Tucker, all hopped up on Old Forrester I suppose, beating the hell out of another 65 year old character actor that is enjoying getting beat up more than anyone I've ever seen. Actually it's the same guy that played the down and out boxer who was always getting whipped and losing his eyesight but ironically had no other means of paying his doctor bills so he had to keep fighting anyway. Makes sense to me. A few minutes later Forrest continues to make us all proud by dropping the top on his red convertible, and knocking down most of a pint of whiskey as he zips through a number of school zones on his way home to grab him a handful of the little lady, played juicily by a still gorgeous Julie Adams. Very nimbly, with yet another glass of whiskey in one hand, and Julie's rapidly unbuttoning blouse in the other hand he is informed that they are having ""green beans"" for dinner...all of a sudden his lust is diverted to pork chops and so he pats his wife on the ass as she dutifully, and mercifully trots off to rustle up some dinner. Scuse me, I mean supper--dinner is lunch down here. But before the supper bell rings, Forrest gets a call to advise him that one of the Rhodes Scholars that works for his trucking company had a head on collision as he crashed through a RR barrier, but he was relieved to hear he beat the train with some nifty driving, thus validating why they must have hired the guy in the first place. The driver survived though and one can only speculate that the brain damage he suffered could not have been such a terribly tragic thing. Hang on, that's just the first 5 minutes.
SPOILERS AHEAD. You had to expect that though, I have to share.
Jethro/Culver has a chip on his shoulder from his own personal stereotyping, and the fact that he had to wear a rope for a belt all those years. No vittles here, just the old man's daughter. Oooohhh, this is going to get ugly. And he displays none of the range we were so accustomed too on the Beverly Hillbillies. Takes this writer/director/star thing a little too seriously I think, that could be the reason old man McCulloch hates him so much. Or it could be that statutory rape thing with the 18 yr old daughter? You just know that the old man wants to punch our fledgling brain surgeon in his medula obadala but he is a very classy guy so he defers so he can go spar with his 16 yr old son. Plenty of drunken drag racing, drunken hay riding, and drunken strip poker, and more drunken ass whooping to go around. And if you're a fan of the ""beating up your kids is the only way to make them a man"" genre you will love this thing.
I won't reveal any of the good parts (giggle snort) but the highlight of the movie is a ""homeric"" showdown/street brawl, Culver vs. McCulloch and a major, big time ripoff of the Quiet Man complete with odds savvy old ladies, gambling/guzzling priests, and even an old man on his death bed who is miraculously resuscitated by the sound of whooping and hollering as one more right cross lands on it's target. Oh yeah, the contestants even stop to have a beer before resuming the slugfest. I'm not going to tell you who wins the fight but considering Ellie May used to tie Jethro up like a pretzel everytime he'd complain about her biscuits...well, it's the high spot of the (gulp) film so I'll keep that one secret. Clint Eastwood likewise rips off Jethro in Any Which Way You Can. I'm dangerously close to surpassing my vast film knowledge here so I better not draw any more parallels OK?
Believe it or not, the DVD transfer is fantastic and the soundtrack rivals movies like Giant and Hurry Sundown. It's very, very good Jethrine. I like this movie. Somebody slap me but I like this thing. It's really very funny. I've actually never been so hammered that I forgot the words to Old McDonald but in McCullochWorld your punishment is getting dumped out of the bed of a pickup to have your wife turn the sprinklers on you as you simulate a coma on the front lawn. 4 Stars, only cause they just don't make em' like this anymore.",1039219200,3,4647,4.474676089517079
