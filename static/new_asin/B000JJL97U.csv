8150915,4,B000JJL97U,We use Leslie Sanzone dvds as well.  This is good but changes directions rather quickly and is more difficult to follow than Leslie's.,1423094400,,134,4.826086956521739

8150917,5,B000JJL97U,"George Forman's funny quips and remarks makes exercising so much fun - and you really do work up a sweat. Before you know it - it is ""cool down"" time. I love all his DVD's!",1347753600,,172,3.942857142857143
8150918,3,B000JJL97U,"After using many Leslie Sansone walking DVD's I thought I would try a different instructor.  And while the instructor is very capable and encouraging it was disappointing to see that George Foreman was not the ""STAR"" of the DVD.  I was looking for more of the George Foreman personality to come shining through on this DVD.  :(
It's almost as though they put his name on the DVD cover just to try to sell more copies.

The exercises themselves are fine and it does show various levels of intensity.  Just too bland......NEEDS MORE GEORGE!  :)",1316649600,2,542,4.652631578947369
8150919,5,B000JJL97U,"I have all the ""Walk With George"" workouts, and I enjoy them all.  George is warmly encouraging (""if I can do this, anyone can!"") while Petra is motivating and friendly, and the interaction between the two of them is fun to watch.  The intensity of this non-intimidating, basic walking workout has been bumped up a bit with optional lunges for the lower body and arm movements for the upper body.  I also thought the music was very inspirational!  If you are a fan of walking and/or Leslie Sansone, you will like this one!",1239926400,10,522,4.580645161290323
8150920,5,B000JJL97U,"I am a huge fan of George Forman workout DVDs.  They are fun, challenging but I don't end up in pain the next day.  I have most of his DVDs, Petra is awesome.  I would recommend any of his exercise DVDs to anyone who wants a fun workout, which will make you sweat, and you won't be bored!!",1212883200,9,289,3.9482758620689653
