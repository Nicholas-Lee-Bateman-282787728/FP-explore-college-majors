8756502,5,B01DOCK44W,"Excellent instructional video on how to incorporate arms movements in belly dance. I have been buying Belly dance Dvds since 2004, had never found any worthwhile videos on how to use the arms. This one is a must have.",1518134400,,217,4.589743589743589
8756503,5,B01DOCK44W,"This DVD has been very helpful to me. I am a self taught belly dancer, and the thing I needed the most help with is my hand and arm positions. This DVD gives you a lot of useful information. The instructor is excellent, she moves so gracefully and effortlessly. She clearly demonstrates the importance of proper arm movements and positions that make all the difference between a professional dancer and an amateur. She is a pleasure to learn from, she's fun and upbeat and has a very pleasant demeanor. There are many different sections to this DVD. She explains the different muscle groups you use, proper posture, fluidity and there are lots of drills and even some routines to demonstrate the different types of arm movements. I think this DVD would be useful for any level of dancer. It is easy enough for beginners, but I think even advanced dancers could learn from this DVD.",1503619200,,881,4.690322580645161
8756504,5,B01DOCK44W,"Rosa is always such a delight! She's such a sweet person and patient instructor which is projected in the dvd.
The pacing in This dvd is excellent. You're Really able to take your time and internalize the movements. Rosa has a calming presence and nothing feels rushed. I especially enjoyed the use of epaulment as i feel that sometimes i become too rigid; it has definitely assisted me with flow!
As someone who has always been self conscious about my skinny arms I've really embraced them and now have such a fun time practicing the many snake arms and hand circles! It's definitely helped me to realize that the hands and arms can flow together gracefully.
I've been through the dvd all the way through about 5 times and I can now use some sections as warm up for arms, specifically stationary and traveling with arms as well as the hand circles and hand stretch sections.
This is a must-buy for anyone who wants graceful, flowing arms and hands!",1485043200,,949,4.621301775147929
8756505,4,B01DOCK44W,"I've been dancing for about a decade, and this DVD still had plenty to teach me. Rosa breaks every concept down cleanly before teaching, then drilling the moves. She then builds upon the drills by adding layers, then travelling steps. The sections on adding epaulement to one's moves were especially welcome, given how physically rigid some bellydance instruction can be. This also has some of the best instructional pacing I've seen on a bellydance DVD. Only once did I feel that I already knew a move well enough that I fast-forwarded through the instructional section, but in fairness, it's a move I'd had taught to me in multiple workshops. I'll be revisiting the instructional sections on this several more times, and foresee it being added to my rotation of drilling DVDs once I feel comfortable enough with the moves and concepts.",1465084800,4,837,4.943262411347518
8756506,5,B01DOCK44W,"I've been belly dancing for years, so I wasn't sure if this video would have anything to offer me. I'm happy to say that this video (along with Blanca's ""Sensual Bellydance"") is not just a must-have for beginning dancers who want to perform outside the home, but also a five-star video that will help intermediate dancers take their hands and arms to the next level as well. Rosa Noreen carefully breaks down various arm and hand movements, explaining which muscles do what and when, always with an emphasis on grace and elegance. She then provides drills to music after each breakdown. I especially appreciated how she layered different skills (epauelment with following arms and traveling choo choo shimmies, for example) in the drills. I have plenty to keep me occupied for a while in my upcoming workouts! Lilililililililiiiiii!",1463270400,4,832,5.036231884057971
