2423144,5,B000BKVKSA,"I echo the earlier entries, this was far too long in arriving; having said that this is the best season (just..) so I'm not complaining too loudly.",1129507200,3,147,4.481481481481482
2423145,5,B000BKVKSA,"More than 15 years after it's original airing, these episodes of Miami Vice comprise some of the best TV has to offer.  Season 1 and Season 2 of this police drama are both excellent.  Standout episodes of this season include:  ""Out Where the Buses Don't Run"" - Sonny and Rico cross paths with a potentially schizophrenic ex-cop with an obsession for the activities of drug lord that was thought long-dead; ""Bushido"" - Castillo and his crew find themselves tracking the activities of one of Castillo's former associates from the intelligence community.  We get to see some emoting from the emotionless Lieutenant; ""Yankee Dollar"" - Sonny investigates the death of a close friend; ""One Way Ticket"" - A lawyer that Sonny has crossed paths with has a crisis of conscience when his employer takes action against his friends;  and ""Payback"" - Sonny and Rico, having trouble gaining the confidence of a drug lord, enlist the aid of a DEA agent with a secret.  All these episodes are punctuated with the spot-on perfect music for each scene and have some great guest stars and performances.  Don't miss this season of Vice!",1129420800,12,1115,4.867724867724868
2423146,5,B000BKVKSA,"The second season of vice is arguably the best and here are some of the reasons why:  The Prodigal Son -- the premiere two hour episode may be the best vice, ironic that it takes place in New York, not Miami.  Features Penn Gillette and Jean Simmons.  Out Where the Buses Don't Run -- brought up by another reviewer and for good reason.  Great music and atmosphere featuring that guy from Animal House and The Insider.  Definately Miami-- featuring Ted Nugent as a psychopathic drug dealer and Arielle Dombasle as his psychopathic girlfriend that Crockett almost falls for.  Great music again and great ending featuring ""Cry"" by Cream.  Little Miss Dangerous -- great music and a great story about a homicidal hooker who Tubbs takes under his wing.  Trust Fund Pirates is also a great one -- rich, trust fund kids who take to being pirates and robbing drug smugglers on the open seas out of boredom features Rick Belzer and Noogie ""Nug man"" Lamonte.  Bushido some fans did not care for it but I loved it.  It was directed by Edward James Olmos and gives some background on Castillo's spook days as he goes after an old friend who has become a double agent.  Different music and a different feel.  A really great opening scene in this one as Crockett and Tubbs use night vision and Zito hides under the sand with a snorkel!  Sons and LOvers is an important episode in which Tubbs former lover, Angelica, comes back (remember from Return of Calderone) with some bad news for Tubbs. This was an important episode for the history of vice and the Calderone saga.  Unfortunatley, this season featured a couple of the lamer episodes such as: The Fix -- Bill Russell as a judge with a gambling habit forces his son to fix a basketball game (but does have a powerful ending) and French Twist -- where a french cop chases a french bad guy and Crockett falls (sort of) for the cop.  I did not care for these two episodes, although they weren't horrible and I'll enjoy watching them again.  But other than those two, this is probably the best season of vice by far!",1129420800,88,2053,4.553133514986376
2423147,5,B000BKVKSA,"The second season of Miami Vice was by far the best of all of them.  When it comes down to listing the best single episode of any show in TV history, this season has it in ""Out Where The Buses Don't Run"".  This episode alone makes this purchase worthwhile.  It has a great music run throughout (especially the haunting 'Brothers In Arms' by Dire Straits at the end of the episode along with a great Jan Hammer score) and the plot leaves you guessing until the very end.

2423171,5,B000BKVKSA,"This is arguably the best season of all of them. While Miami Vice was sometimes still finding its rhythm in season one, season two was when the producers took all the positive things from season one that just ""worked"" and had already earned the show a burgeoning fan following, and they dialed them up even more and just ran with it.

Miami Vice was in its absolute heyday, which is immediately obvious when you watch any of the episodes, even the slightly sillier ones like ""Tale of the Goat"" or ""Whatever Works"". The pastel color coding just pops right off the TV screen, with a perfection of matching linen suits, backdrops and props that is just a delight to witness. And even in the season 2 opener ""Prodigal Son"" which is largely set in New York City, a place where the dreaded earthtones naturally dominate much of the scenery, Michael Mann manages to squeeze in pastels by letting extras wear cream colored polo shirts and aqua and peach colored dresses, and by discreetly painting monolithic building facades pink.

The music is sharp and always fitting to a particular scene and runs the whole gamut of  mid-1980s rock and pop, from Billy Ocean to Kate Bush and Ted Nugent. Remixed in Dolby 5.1 using digital sources, it leaves simply nothing to desire.

The stories themselves and the acting were also gripping, well crafted and just compelling.  ""Prodigal Son"", like its three 90-minute predecessors from season one, really looks and feels more like a fully fledged action movie than an episode of a TV series. Among the regular 48-minute episodes, shining examples of Miami Vice's full throttle quality include ""Bushido"", ""Out Where The Buses Don't Run"", and the season finale ""Sons and Lovers"". Even the Phil Collins-centered episode ""Phil the Shill"", daft as most of it is, is done in such a way that it doesn't belie the degree of simply very good television programming that was the entire second season.

It's as if the makers of the show were intent on creating a time capsule of the mid-1980s, both made up of things that were universally en vogue back in the day and trends that the show uniquely created itself. All in all, it's just brimming with all the bells and whistles of what made that decade so colorful. This season box is a must-have for anybody who wants to either familiarize themselves with 80s pop culture or gain an understanding of what it's all about. But even if you could care less about all that, it still simply makes for thoroughly good entertainment.",1467417600,,2495,4.750577367205543

2423184,3,B000BKVKSA,"Anybody that thinks this was the best season of Vice is either mentally retarded or never saw any other seasons. The show slipped considerably in season 2, primarily as a result of the fame gained from season 1. This show looks phoned in on many episodes, with lousy stories, poor acting and way too many unwanted cameos. This season almost seemed like a Variety Show, with musical guest included. There are a few episodes that are decent so I will not go lower than three stars. However, this season pales in comparison to seasons 1, 3, and maybe 4. However, it is better than season 5, but then again, what wasn't.",1441411200,,616,4.558558558558558

The newer editions are in slimmer DVD boxes. Since I owned the other seasons in slim editions, I didn't want to get an older version of season 2 so I returned this. If you are price-conscious, you may be ok with purchasing this (it was around $11 in December 2014). Athough, I did a bit of research and read somewhere on the Internet that the thick box editions have episodes on both sides of the discs which cause playback issues on some DVD players.

2423254,4,B000BKVKSA,"If there was ever a ""Family Feud"" question that asked ""Name an Eighties TV show,"" one would think that ""Miami Vice"" would likely be at or near the top of the list of answers.  Millions in that decade were drawn to this crime drama with its Caribbean feel and its Eighties pastel colors and music-video like scenes.  This DVD set contains all 22 episodes of the show's second season that originally aired on NBC from September 1985 to May 1986.

""Miami Vice"" featured Don Johnson as Sonny Crockett, a detective who teams up with Rico Tubbs (Philip Michael Thomas) to catch drug dealers, murderers, KGB assassins, pirates, and other criminals in and around the Florida city.  The acerbic Sonny and more easygoing Rico serve under Martin Castillo, their laconic lieutenant who possesses a quiet authority.

People tuned into the show for more than the good storylines, the scenery, and the cool clothes.  Some of the music by artists like Glenn Frey, Billy Ocean, Phil Collins, The Who, and The Doors also attracted many viewers, as did guest stars such as Little Richard, Miles Davis, Ted Nugent, G. Gordon Liddy, Phil Collins, Bill Russell, and Tommy Chong.

Season Two represented the peak of popularity for ""Miami Vice""--the show lasted only three more seasons before being cancelled.  Still, the crime drama evokes an era like few shows in recent decades have done--and the show's theme song is one of the best in television history.",1357257600,,1435,4.900826446280992

2423263,5,B000BKVKSA,Very good TV series! The DVD has perfect Quality and I am very much enjoying it. I will purchase more! Thank You,1314403200,,112,4.136363636363637
2423264,5,B000BKVKSA,"In the second season of this show, it hits its stride with stories devoted not only to Sonny and Rico but sometimes  to their colleagues as well. And Noogie and Izzy and the nemesis that never ends....Calderone.

There are more shoot-outs, stakeouts, surprises, and conflicts this time around, with the action increasing along with the speed of Sonny's Ferrari.

This is also a good way to rediscover 80s music.  (Hey, this show and that music got me through college!)",1296432000,,468,4.886075949367089
2423265,5,B000BKVKSA,Great series,1291593600,,12,5.5
2423266,1,B000BKVKSA,"I bought this product as a gift to my brother. It said it was 97% and was only missing the outter cover but it was in good shape and played. I thought cool because I had a week to return it. I was embrassed when my brother tried to watch it all the disc's skip and the second disc was so badly scratched it didn't even register on the dvd player or x box. Of course the week had already passed so I'm stuck with this very badly damaged copy. Be ware of the company that sold this to me, make sure you check your product within the required time, or it might happen to you",1289952000,,571,3.9310344827586206
2423267,5,B000BKVKSA,"Miami Vice was awesome in the 80's, it's even awesomer now!! All the episodes from one of the best seasons of Vice ever! My personal favorites: ""Phil the Shill"", a more lighthearted episode with Phil Collins in a hilarious guest role; ""Out Where the Buses Don't Run"" another one with some humor and a very young David Strathairn in an intense guest spot; ""Little Miss Dangerous"" where some light is shed on Tubbs' character as he tries to help a young sex worker, and the search scene set to Howard Jones ""Assault and Battery"" is haunting; ""One Way Ticket"" with John Heard in a guest spot as a smarmy attorney trying to make good is another classic. It did my heart good to re-watch these episodes and remember the awesome music, both Hammer's score as well as the rest of the well-chosen rock and pop songs in the background, the Daytona Spyder, the pastel color palette, the palm trees and Don Johnson.... Ahhhhh...... 80's coolness doesn't get any cooler!!",1284681600,,959,4.680473372781065
2423278,5,B000BKVKSA,The season two Miami Vice set was in excellent condition and played without a hitch through all the episodes. I received Season Two quite some time ago but just now got around to watching the DVDs. The episodes are well organized on each DVD and really a joy to watch with no commercials.,1271203200,,288,4.452830188679245
2423279,5,B000BKVKSA,"Season 2 largely improved on the merits of the second season.  The style often associated with Miami Vice was upped a notch, as was the action.  The surprise is that the level of drama and darkness associated with being a police officer was moved up a few levels as well.  Prostitutes, drug addiction, murder, and of course drugs, were prevalent themes throughout the season, marked by some very sad and some very excellent episodes.  Its interesting that tv history often labels Miami Vice as a campy show, with cheesy 80s style.  While I was not a part of that time (well that I remember anyway), I will say I'm surprised how well the themes of the show has held up to the modern time.

Watching season 2 kind of reminds me of Peter Gabriel discussing Jimi Hendrix: when he listened to it, he hasn't seen any real innovation of Jimi's guitar work.  Sure there were modern versions, and more technically advanced guitarists, but overall, no one's done anything that great or special since then.  That's how I feel about Miami Vice.  Sure cop shows have come since, and maybe been more ""modern"" and realistic, but nothing since has been as great or as special as Miami Vice.  Give it a change and you may be surprised.",1254787200,,1218,4.597222222222222
2423280,5,B000BKVKSA,I am a true blue devoted Don Johnson and Miami Vice fan.  This is an excellent TV crime drama.  I wish it were still playing regularly.,1239840000,,135,4.153846153846154
2423281,3,B000BKVKSA,"In this 1985-86 Season, MIAMI VICE walks that fine line between hip and cool. Hip fades, but cool is timeless. Then, as now, it doesn't get much cooler than this groundbreaking and trendsetting series' promise of a ""life of adventure, exciting folks, and exotic locales,"" to quote one sardonic character. But the compelling stories, cinematic trappings, and lightning-in-a-bottle chemistry between co-stars Don Johnson(Crockett) and Philip Michael Thomas(Tubbs) elevate MIAMI VICE from time capsule status.

Likewise, the eclectic soundtrack, that would be painfully dated had it been stuck in the '80s, is a mind-blowing shuffle of genres and mainstream, alternative and world artists.
""Prodigal Son,"" the double-length episode that opens the season, features Glenn Frey, U2, the Neville Brothers, Debbie Harry, Brian Ferry, Lou Reed, Traffic, and Phil Collins. Collins himself portrays a con man in one of the season's most entertaining episodes, ""Phil the Shill.""

Not content to just be heard, other musicians who generally eschewed television, appeared on Miami Vice this season, adding to the series' considerable cachet. Among them: Kiss frontman Gene Simmons (""Prodigal Son""); Miles Davis (""Junk Love""); Leonard Cohen (""French Twist""); Ted Nugent (""Definitely Miami""); and Frank Zappa (""Payback"").

MIAMI VICE instantly established itself as an oasis for character actors, many at the beginning of their careers. The second season offers early glimpses of Nathan Lane (""Buddies""), Harvey Fierstein and a pre-Seinfeld Michael Richards as a menacing heavy (""The Fix""), David Strathairn (""Out Where the Buses Don't Run""), Bob Balaban (""Back in the World""), and John Leguizamo (""Sons and Lovers,"" which also features the unfortunate stunt-casting of Lee Iacocca as a gun-toting parks commissioner).

Most of MIAMI VICE's buzz-generating episodes were in season 1, but season 2 offers several series benchmarks. Two of Johnson's finest hours are ""Back in the World"" (which he directed) and ""Buddies,"" two episodes that explore Crockett's Vietnam War experience. Thomas got his chance to shine in ""Prodigal Son"" and ""Sons and Lovers,"" in which Tubbs becomes a target of the vengeful Ivan Calderon.

""Bushido"" is an always-welcome showcase for Emmy-winner Edward James Olmos as Castillo, who helps shield an associate's Soviet wife and son from the CIA and KGB. ""Out Where the Buses Don't Run"" boasts an Emmy-worthy performance by guest star Bruce McGill (D-Day in Animal House) as an unhinged former vice cop. Miami Vice stylishly subverted TV cop drama convention, but despite one too many downbeat endings that freeze on a devastated Crockett, it remains exhilarating to re-visit. There are no extras on this three disc-set, but the episodes are enough to make you want to party like it's 1985.

Additionally, this 1985-1986 Season of this police drama about these sockless detectives takes me all the way back to memory lane when Don Johnson was a sex symbol and when MIAMI VICE was on NBC every Friday night at 10PM right after KNIGHT RIDER at 9PM, especially since MIAMI VICE was in its 2nd Season while KNIGHT RIDER was in its 4th Season and when Don Johnson was a sex symbol along with the fact that Don Johnson(Sonny Crockett) and David Hasselhoff(Michael Knight) were the best looking men on Friday nights back then along with the fact that MIAMI VICE is the show that made Don Johnson a star, especially before his days on NASH BRIDGES along with the fact that this police drama was still in its honeymoon phase in this season to top that off.

As a matter of fact Don Johnson even auditioned for the part of Michael Knight on KNIGHT RIDER back in the Spring of 1982 along with the list of candidates being interviewed by creator(Glen Larson), but got rejected since Larson decided to give it to David Hasselhoff, which made Hasselhoff a star and a sex symbol before Johnson was.

Therefore Don Johnson didn't get to become a famous superstar until he auditioned for the role of Crockett on MIAMI VICE and got the part, but the more I think about it the more I cant help thinking that Don Johnson probably would have made an awesome Michael Knight, but probably not as great as David Hasselhoff did which is probably due to the fact that David Hasselhoff is better looking than Don Johnson is.

However Don Johnson, Tom Selleck, and Pierce Brosnan were the best looking actors of 1986, but I noticed that back then Don Johnson started stealing some of Tom Selleck's thunder since Johnson seemed to be outclassing Selleck as a sex symbol especially since MAGNUM seemed to start losing some viewers through MIAMI VICE, which was perhaps due to the fact that Don Johnson is a few years younger than Tom Selleck is along with the fact that the detective drama MAGNUM, PI was already in its 5th Season on CBS when MIAMI VICE was in its 1st Season on NBC when it made its debut in September of 1984.

Therefore MAGNUM was in its 6th Season on CBS when MIAMI VICE was in its 2nd Season on NBC which still made this show relatively new while MAGNUM, P.I. was already getting kind of old, but Tom Selleck still became a star before Don Johnson did.

This is also the season of MIAMI VICE when Crockett(Don Johnson) gets his white Ferrari Testarosa after his black Daytona Ferrari gets blown up, which was certainly a major upgrade for Crockett along with the fact that Crockett's Ferrari was even more upgraded than Robin Master's Ferrari GT on MAGNUM, P.I.

This is also the season when Don Johnson made his hit song ""Heartbeat"" on the radio in the Summer of 1986, just before this police drama hit it's 3rd Season on NBC.

Additionally, MIAMI VICE was also kind of like a night time soap opera in a way, just like ER, CHICAGO HOPE, NYPD BLUE, HILLS STREET BLUES, MELROSE PLACE, BEVERLY HILLS 90210, DAWSON'S CREEK, etc. all were, since they'd sometimes show signs, details, and hints of concluding the previous episodes, even though they wouldn't provide scenes from the previous episodes, unless of course the episode was a 2-part episode.

This season also takes me all the way back to memory lane when NBC's motto was ""NBC: Let's All Be There"".

It was also interesting being able to see these episodes of MIAMI VICE complete & uncut and commercial-free without deleted scenes like they were originally shown on NBC as opposed to how they were shown in reruns on USA, FX, TNN,,TV Land. and COZI-TV.

This DVD box set also provides the listing of each episodes original air-date with a brief summary.

For instance, each of these 1985-1986 Season episodes original air-dates on NBC are
9/27/85-THE PRODIGAL SON
10/4/85-WHATEVER WORKS
10/18/85-OUT WHERE THE BLUES DON'T RUN

It was also interesting seeing guest stars in this 1985-1986 Season like
*Eartha Kitt known for her role as Catwoman on BATMAN guest starring in the ""Whatever Works"" episode

*Singer Little Richard in the ""Out Where The Buses Don't Run"" episode

*Power Station making a cameo appearance in the ""Whatever Works"" episode

*Nathan Lane known for his co-starring role as Robin Williams gay partner in the movie THE BIRD CAGE guest starring in the ""Buddies"" episode

*John Heard known for his co-starring role in the movie CHUD and for his co-starring role as Irena's boyfriend(Oliver)in the movie CAT PEOPLE with Nastassja Kinski

*Phil Collins in the ""Phil The Shrill"" episode

*Jan Hammer making a cameo appearance in the ""One Way Ticket"" episode

*The Fat Boys doing a cameo appearance in the Florence Italy"" episode

*Michael Richards in ""The Fix"" episode before his co-starring days as Kramer on SEINFELD

The only problem I have with this 1985-86 Season DVD box set of MIAMI VICE is every disc seems to have a problem with freezing and skipping just like the problem I had with the KNIGHT RIDER-SEASON 2 DVD box set and THE A-TEAM-SEASON 2 DVD box set, which is probably due to all the episodes on this DVD being put on 2-sided discs which is perhaps what inclined Universal to make a complete series DVD box set of MIAMI VICE and KNIGHT RIDER by redoing each episode by putting them on single sided discs instead of double sided discs in order to make up for all the flaws and descrepancies that caused the disc freeze up and skip a lot on both the MIAMI VICE-SEASON 1 DVD box set, the MIAMI VICE-SEASON 2 DVD box set, and the KNIGHT RIDER-SEASON 2 DVD box set aside from the fact that it will be harder for Universal to get more sales on the MIAMI VICE-The Complete Series DVD box set and the KNIGHT RIDER-The Complete Series DVD box set with times being so tight right now in todays rough economy at least until this recession is over.",1218585600,2,9040,4.98936877076412
2423282,3,B000BKVKSA,"If you are a Miami Vice Fan you will love it. the thing I don't like is the Two(2) sided disc. The discs seem thiner then usual but the movie quality is good. Compared to other sets that I have purchased in the past which contained heavier one sided picture discs, the Miami Vice box sets (1 & 2 anyway) seem of cheaper quality. Because of this I question the price on these items. As I said before in other box sets I have purchased of better quality materials, The price is in the same ball park. Alas I shall buy them because I do like the series.",1209340800,2,550,4.101851851851852
2423283,5,B000BKVKSA,"Complete collection of the second season of Miami Vice (1985-1986), indexed on three DVDs.  Apparently, the musical rights to the many songs held up release of MV DVDs for a while, but they've all been cleared and the shows are fully intact.

The tone is similar to the first season, with its balance of light, sometimes humorous interaction among the cops and low-rent criminals, to dark and gritty, with the focus on corruption, greed, hypocrisy and general cynicism.  Indeed, many enduring clichs of these cynical times got their start on Vice.  We have Colombian drug dealers obsessed with revenge, we have evil yuppie pirates who rob and kill for the thrill (""trust fund babies want to have fun""), there's the ex-cop who went insane trying to capture a gangster, there's the father-son sports duo struggling with their relationship and a murder, we have Castillo's mysterious past as a 'company' (CIA) man, etc.  While MV's reputation is largely grounded in its style and flare, the overall tone of the show and the subject matter was an important factor and consistent with Mann's work involving cops and robbers.  After the first, this is definitely the next best season in terms of being fresh.

While Crockett and Tubbs are involved in more shootouts per season than probably the entire vice squad handled over a few years, and while it's hard to explain how there aren't 1,000 people who now know our heroes' undercover identities, and while Miami's crime rate is genuinely disturbing, the show is still eminently enjoyable as an 80s noir series with many of Michael Mann's signature touches.  Sinister occurrences are punctuated with a deep Jan Hammer synch cue, Crockett has a straight face wearing turquoise, pink, and white ensembles, and the criminals have perms.  You can buy this set or splurge on the entire five-season DVD box, which only appeared after the seasons were trickled out over two years.",1205884800,2,1918,4.987460815047022
2423284,4,B000BKVKSA,"Season 2 picks up from where season 1 left off - with continuation storylines as well. The excellent opener, ""The prodigal son"", for example requires you to have seen ""Rites of passage"" is order to know who Valerie is. Other episodes continue the war between Tubbs and the Calderone family and require you already have watched 4 episodes from season 1. The voodoo episodes like ""Tale of the goat"" and ""Whatever works"" are excellent and go places where season 1 didn't. The only episodes here that weren't so hot were ""Florence, Italy"" and ""Little Miss Dangerous"", which were back to back. As with season 4, these silly episodes mar what is otherwise an impeccable season.",1194393600,,671,4.843478260869565

2423289,5,B000BKVKSA,"He's in the top 2 or 3 directors of all time, and probably the best working today.  What can anyone say, Miami Vice changed television forever--as a producer Mann invested heavily in getting the best writing and achieved the kind of television repeated today in serial shows like 24, Sopranos, Oz, etc, but without it being in continuing series mode.  Some say when the black Daytona Ferrari got blown up, Vice went downhill...not so.

The DVD set is top notch, excellent quality.

2423298,5,B000BKVKSA,"The release of the series DVDs comes at the perfect time to answer the critics with poor memories who are now stupidly hailing the new ""Vice"" film as ""darkier and grittier"" than the TV series. They forget how dark and gritty---and how timely, potent and groundbreaking---the original series was. The art direction, music, colors, the ""cool"", were innovative, but mere superficialities. It was the political narrative that was the heart of this series. ""Miami Vice"" carved open the hypocrisy of America's ""war on drugs"" like nothing before, or since.

It was this hypocrisy, and series' meditations on the duplicity and corruption of the intelligence world, the multinational narco-economy, that made every double and triple cross so explosive and shocking, and this context that let us feel the angst of Crockett, Tubbs and the other characters. These were among the finest, boldest, most TIMELESS moments in TV history.

Season 2 found the series at its popular zenith, with the initial hip gradually giving way to even more powerful, even darker moments. The season was full of highlights.

""Prodigal Son"" was a stunning standalone two-episode movie with Crockett and Tubbs pursuing Colombian drug lords all the way to New York, and the center of world finance, and to America's own involvement in the drug economy. This unprecedented epic was possibly the series' zenith, and one of many episodes that puts the Colin Farrell-Jamie Foxx film to shame. ""Out Where Buses Don't Run"" was a poem on obession, bitterly poignant. ""Back in the World"" brought back the ghosts of the Vietnam War, and US covert operations. (The Ira Stone arc would return again in Season 3, in the most timely manner.)

I sincerely hope that the entire series, the final seasons (3-5), are made available on DVD. These underappreciated episodes were full of gems, such as ""Shadow in the Dark"" (a perfect serial killer procedural, the precursor to ""Manhunter""), a couple of fine examples of quirky Florida crime humor, a very scary episode with Crockett pursuing a maker of snuff films, and the powerful two-hour series finale ""Freefall"".",1154304000,12,2112,5.113043478260869
2423299,5,B000BKVKSA,"The picture and sound quality of Season Two is actually much better than that of Season One. The picture is much clearer and sharper, while the sound on the Season Two discs is crisper and in much better quality stereo.

There are some really great episodes in the Season Two boxed set. My favorite episode of this season is ""The Dutch Oven"", which focused on Trudy's inner-conflict and personal struggles following her fatal shooting of a drug dealer. It was nice to see Trudy, usually reduced to cameo appearances on the program, given a lead role. Another great episode involves a Santeria cult that is offing crooked Miami police officers.

And the main reason I usually buy DVDs because I love to listen to the commentaries... Any show I'm interested in keeping I already have recorded on videotape... and I always had top of the line equipment and made sure my cable company gave me clear pictures.  So hence, if all a company is going to do is give me clear copies of the episodes, I'm not usually interested.  So why then did I get this one and why will I get the rest of the series?  Because my copies are on Beta and everyone knows that Sony let down all its Beta consumers and you can't get the machines fixed any more.  So I bought the DVDs for seasons 1 and 2 here.  But had these episodes been on the VHS tapes I now record on... if all you are going to give me is the episodes, then thank you very much, I'll save my money.

2423303,5,B000BKVKSA,"I was never into this show in the 80's, I might have caught it a few times, but was never into it, but now I'm hooked! I have to say, the 2 hour (Season Premiere) episodes (Pilot-Season 1 & The Prodigal Son-Season 2) are the best episodes I've seen yet.

They're like a movie rather than an episode. I would like to say though, I am glad that this show was put onto dvd and that they are in 5.1 Dolby, but you can't tell me this is the best picture quality that they could do?! I mean the picture does look good, so I don't want to discourage anyone from buying it. But I just recently got Miami Vice Seasons 1-2, and the first 2 seasons of Macgyver, and by far Miami Vice is better, but only cuz it has a teeny bit better picture quality and it has 5.1 Dolby.

The picture on MV still looks grainy, and you see pops and crackles like when you're in the movie theatre, and to me at times it looks bad. I would probably be first in line to fork out another 50 bucks to get a remastered version of this, but I mean come on, why not just release it remastered and get it right the first time? why? MONEY! they'll release a half quality version to see if it sells, and if and when it does, they'll go back and say HEY! THIS STUFF IS SELLING! so then they'll try to get some extras like the original cast doing interviews etc, and remaster it. I mean they remastered the audio, so how hard is it to clean up the picture?

But as for Macgyver, at times the picture quality is horrible, with the graininess, and pops and crackles on the screen, it makes the show look 30 years old. I've seen movies from the 60's, remastered look newer. And also Macgyver is only in Stereo, no 5.1 Dolby which sucks!

But I am almost done watching Season 2, I'm on the final disc (Side 1), and i'm trying not to watch it too much because once i'm done, who knows when Season 3 will be released. It took long enough with this one. But I am eagerly awaiting Season 3. I am sadly disappointed though, cuz I heard that Crockett's car gets blown up in season 2, and gets the White Ferrari, but then found out by some other reviewer that it's not until season 3!, so now I'll probably have to wait another year to see that, which sucks, so HURRY UP AND RELEASE SEASON 3 UNIVERSAL!

Anyway, I suggest that if anyone is a fan of 80's tv, or just a fan of a good cop/action/drama show then check this show out, you won't be disappointed!

One question though...WHY THE HECK DOES TUBBS ALWAYS MIX BUSINESS WITH PLEASURE? (He's always hitting on the witnesses, and trying to get into their pants...I thought he was in love with Pam Grier's character in New York? what a moron! hehe)",1142812800,5,2647,4.180392156862745

2423306,5,B000BKVKSA,"I have been avid fan of Miami Vice since it first episode in 1984.  Season 2 is more a definitive Miami Vice Season, where all the other cast of the show like Olivia Brown, John Diehl, Edward James Olmos, Sandra Santiago, Micheal Talbot set out and shine in one of the Best Cops Drama's in Television history outside of Hawaii 5-0, Cagney and Lacey. & Mod Squad.  There just wasn't any crime show that compares to Miami Vice.  Don Johnson & Phillip Michael Thomas rise to occasion on the Second Season.

Some of my Favorite episodes on Season 2 (""Prodigal Son""); Miles Davis (""Junk Love""); Leonard Cohen (""French Twist""); Ted Nugent (""Definitely Miami""); Bushido, just to name of few.  All the episodes are very action packed, drama and suspense.  Also, the comedy moments and dialog between Johnson & Thomas are infamous.  This show was not only a show but a way of life and when a show changes the hearts, minds, clothes, conversation with the riveting episodes.  This show was clearly ahead of it time.  Thanks to the Cast, Crew, Michael Mann, Jan Hammer, Guest Stars and Universal Studios.  Miami Vice Season 2 is a must have for a Avid Fan or someone who want recapture just a few moments a time when things were Colorful, Enlightening, Entertaining, And Suspenseful.

I just received my DVD and I immediately had a Miami Vice Marathon and I don't regret it.  I can watch this series over & over again and still have wonderful and enjoy experience like the first time I watched the espisode back in 1984 & 1985.

Go Get Miami Vice Season 2 DVD _ It will be Twice As Nice!!!!!!!!",1139961600,3,1583,4.590747330960854
2423307,3,B000BKVKSA,"Season 2 of Vice is a perfect example of a show being the victim of its own success.  A stylistic and critical hit the first year, Season 2 features larger budgets, more ""flashy"" set-pieces, a wide array of guest rockers in cameos, yet the stories simply don't have the hungry edge or bite of year one.

The art-deco design, cool (as in medium) tone and guest stars ranging from Phil Collins to DeBarge to Ted Nugent are the delicious surface pleasures of the show, but the edgy noir-trappings are no longer so strongly in evidence. While Year 1 put the principals through many emotional wringers (and defined the moral universe of the show), Year 2 instead puts friends and acquaintances of the principals through many emotional and physical straits - and the principals must deal with their torn friends.  Year 1 really messed with our very conception of what was ""allowed"" in cop shows (""Golden Triangle"" in which Castillo turns into a killing machine, ""No Exit,"" and Bruce Willis's immoral guns runner).  In Y2, too many episodes start with a close friend getting killed, and a good half-dozen seem to have Crockett fall in love - with the ""wrong woman.""

The principals are no longer put in any real jeopardy (not that we would believe it anyway).  The tone of the series is shifting to more soap-opera-esque narrative strategies.

Sure, there are only so many stories under the sun, but the transgressive and amoral landscape, often involving Feds working against local law enforcement (even the good guys can't agree what's right) of Year 1 is deluded by a wash of on-the-run, threatened or wrongly murdered friends, ex-partners, or girlfriends that fill Year 2.

The show isn't taking the cop-show particulars so seriously either (in ""Phil the Shill"" Phil Collins and Johnson gloss through the ""wait, I'll make a deal"" conversation glibly).  It's getting a bigger kick out of sticking G. Gordon Liddy (who apparently can act) or Gene Simmons (who apparently can not) into cameo bits that smack of stunt-casting.

Highlights include most of ""Out Where The Buses Don't Run"" while Bruce McGill acts almost too crazy to be believed, ""Yankee Dollar,"" which is disarmingly straight-forward in its plotting, and I enjoyed ""Phil the Shill"" in spite of its overt daffiness.  (Nice bumpers with Switek and his Elvis obsession.)  More muddled episodes include ""Definitely Miami,"" in which two plots are intercut without much effect or benefit to either, and ""Tales of the Goat,"" a weird Haiti voodoo tale that may be there as a remnant of some Jim Jones ""Don't follow crazy leaders"" paranoia.

The show would be forced to go in different directions in subsequent years.  Here is its sophomore year, cleaner, brighter, and a little more ""normal"" than before.",1139097600,4,2754,4.945770065075922

When I picked the first season set up, I rushed home, unwrapped it and threw the first DVD in my player.  The picture quality was below average and the DVD freezed several times.

I later learned through an article in Video Business magazine that the reason for the glitches are the double sided discs using the DVD 18 format.  The plants producing these discs are running over capacity and it is a quality control issue.  Several studios are acknowledging the problem and switching from DVD 18 to DVD 9 on certain DVD TV titles.  These single sided discs have more durability.  Warner Brothers recently switched producing the West Wing and Dukes of Hazzard from DVD 18 to DVD 9.  Universal Studios had not commented.

2423319,5,B000BKVKSA,"This DVD of Miami Vice is the reason why the show was so popular.  You see the show hit it's stride in season 2.  The biggest reason to own this is to see the first episode of season 2 the Progigal Son.  Some might argue that this is not that important of an episode but the 90 minute episode pretty much defines Miami Vice and distills the look and the sound totally.  From Jan Hammer's instrumentals to the pastel colored suits and the whole look of the backgrounds and interiors this is the 1980's and this is Miami Vice.  Even though this episode is set in New York City at least two music videos were made from the footage of this episode.  (Note why weren't they included with the DVD's?)  To me just this episode is important because it defined for me the 1980's and the whole look of the show.  It's what I will show my 6 year old nieces and say this is the 1980's.  I know there are other episodes that are good on the DVD but Progigal Son to me is what Vice is all about.  To me it represents the best of that show and felt like a movie, and not just some episode that is a throw-away.  If nothing else check this episode out just for the music used in it.  That and Glen Frey's ""You Belong To The City"" is featured twice in the episode.  Getting just this episode finally on DVD was worth the price tag after all these years.",1135382400,3,1336,4.131782945736434
2423320,5,B000BKVKSA,"I just saw the trailer for the up coming movie of Miami Vice due this summer of 2006. Unless the trailer is extremely deceiving; Boy, us true fans of the show will be more disillusioned than the fans of the Dukes of Hazzard were with that new movie. The trailer is dark, to the point that it reminded me of a Robot Cop movie based in Detroit, more than anything having to do with Miami, truly. It seems Michael Mann staid with the desire of doing Collateral 2, but instead he is going to call it Miami Vice.

With this said, there is nothing that will surpass, take the place, or continue with what Miami Vice the show was. The show was the show and that is it, like so many things. It was the product of an era as well as the reflection of an era. This new installment will not have the impact of influence, identification, and originality the show had in the 1980s; it will blend as another annoying, run around explosions Hollywood movie. Or as I call them, ""The Same Crap Part 3"". The good thing about this movie is that Universal's interest in the movie and its success pushed for the interest on the DVD release of the show early this year. One thing will promote the other and mou money, mou money, mou money.

With this said, there is more reason to have Miami Vice season 2. In this season the good scripts continue and the show is slightly more adorned in terms of cinematography and settings, in the style we have come to know, a la Miami Vice. By this time the show is clearly a hit and had gotten more form. My only complain of this DVD set is that there are no extras, we saw Jan Hammer, and many other informative extras on season 1, but still I have not seen Don Johnson, Phillip Michael Thomas, or any of the cast anywhere commenting after 20 years. Nevertheless, just a great show that definitely deserved to be on DVD.

Miami Vice definitely took it to another level, but lets not forget about the pioneer of it all Hawaii Five-0. (I am still waiting) I suppose the DVDs of this also classic show will be released whenever the studios feel like making a movie about it.

2423322,5,B000BKVKSA,"I agree with the majority of the other reveiwers: Season Two of Miami Vice is astounding.

Even without special feature (why aren't there any?!?!), this DVD box set is darn near perfect. Unlike Season One, Season Two offers a very crisp sound, vibrant picture (not grainy or blemished by ""floaters"" on the screen) and powerful performances.

My wife and I have Miami Vice marathons every night, watching 2-3 episodes before bed. We love it. She, because she remembers the '80s with fondness and adores the gaudy outfits and ""big hair"" styles...and because Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas are cooler than cool. Me, because I love the music and the cinematography. Oh, and Crockett's Ferrari. Can't forget that.

Standout episodes are ""Out Where the Buses Don't Run"" (featuring one of the most powerful endings I've ever seen -- complimented by the already eerie Dire Straights song ""Brothers in Arms"")...""Bushido""...and ""Prodigal Son."" But we haven't found a bad episode yet.

We can't wait for the next seasons to come out on DVD!

The only question we have is this: Who taught Philip Michael Thomas how to run and shoot? He runs like a dancer, lithe and with short, tiny steps, holding his small, snub-nosed gun chest high with both hands like it's a song book in church. Anyone else doing this would be laughable. But PMT pulls it off seemingly without effort. The man is elegant, however. So even when doesn't seem cop-like, he's still a wonder to behold.

No matter. Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas created two of TV's most memorable characters -- and certainly two of its coolest.

For the sights and sounds -- as well as the powerful stories -- we wholeheartedly recommend Miami Vice Season Two. TV doesn't get much better than that.",1134950400,4,1751,4.875420875420875
2423323,4,B000BKVKSA,"The 1980s were a decade of gaudy use of pastel colors and digitalized music that became extremely popular.  It was also booming decade for the business community through the emergence of the yuppie.  The yuppies were now the new generation after the hippie, but instead of embracing love, they cherished the almighty dollar.  Through the quick expansion of the 1980's generation a new culture emerged that clinched on the old traditions of the previous generation - the drug use.  However, the drugs now became stronger and more ""chic"", as people began to powder their noses.

Through the increasing wealth and the growing demand of celebrity drugs such as cocaine, a rich and almost untouchable criminal culture began a symbiosis around those who could afford the coke.  This criminal culture brought New York detective Ricardo ""Rico"" Tubbs (Philip Michael Thomas) to Miami, as he sought vengeance in the pilot episode in 1984.  Fortunately, Rico bumped into the former college football star and Vietnam vet James ""Sonny"" Crockett (Don Johnson) who works for the Miami Vice, a covert part of the Miami Police Department that battles organized crime with strong drug affiliations.  Together they take on the American drug cartel and other hoodlums causing disturbing violence by pushing drugs in the southern Florida.

The second season opens with Tubbs and Sonny trying to stop Colombian drug dealers, as they are killing FBI agents in the episode The Prodigal Son.  It brings them to New York, which kicks off the second season with an intense hunt for the ruthless criminals.  Many of the 22 episodes are of the same caliber as The Prodigal Son, and maybe even better, but there are a few episodes that fall below the average on the measuring stick.  Luckily, there are episodes such as Bushido, which is one of the better parts where Sonny and Tubbs are up against both the CIA and the KGB, while trying to help a CIA operative.  Back in the World is also a great episode where Sonny faces his tormenting past from Vietnam War.  Ultimately, the second season wraps up with an exceptional part where Tubbs learns that his nemesis, the leader of the Calderon family, has a deep desire to see him dead.

The second season shows a strong progress in the making of the show, as the characters, the stories, and the overall feel displays significant maturation from the first season.  On example is the focus in the first season that was almost only on Sonny and Tubbs, however, in the second season the audience gets to know the other members of the Miami Vice on a more personal level.  This helps the audience to relate with the heroic duo in the TV series.  The visuals are also becoming more alive and not as rigid, as the show now feels more comfortable with its identity.

The first thing most people remember from viewing Miami Vice is the theme score by Jan Hammer, which accentuates the 1980s atmosphere with its highly digitalized music.  Another great thing with Miami Vice is its use of quality music from musicians such as The Doors, U2, Billy Ocean, Phil Collins, Chaka Khan, and Madonna. Naturally, several visual facets also play a significant part to the police drama's success such as the loosely hanging Armani suits with a T-shirt underneath and the luxurious sports cars in subtropical Miami.  The combination between the music and the visual generated a similar tone that one could experience from many of the music videos of the 1980s, as the show pleaded the viewers emotional side through highly thrilling action and the cool characters.

Personally, I watched this show several times during the 1980s, and I thought their outfits were the coolest thing on earth.  Believe it, or not, but I wore a white suit jacket with pastel colored T-shirts, I even had the pastel colored socks.  So I guess, I must say that I thought the show was great back in the 1980s and I still think the show has great viewing value, even though I no longer wear white suit jackets with pastel shirts.",1134691200,32,4002,4.808759124087591

I noticed that people mentioned the long delay between releases and I suspect that might have to do with having to get all the rights for the songs. I mean they used DOZENS of great songs and maybe that's why it took so long to get this out. I'm just grateful it was out in time for the holidays.

As many others have stated, these are the best episodes of Vice. ""Little Miss Dangerous"" being my all time favorite episode. Thematically, season two is the strongest. The season opener, I have seen so many times (on a vhs tape) that I have every line memorized and I can't wait to see it on DVD. And also can I just say that the use of Traffic's ""Glad"" during the scene with Penn is like one of my all time favorite uses of music in film. It's just wonderful. And Gene Simmons!!! Wow. This DVD collection is amazing.",1134432000,3,970,4.329670329670329
2423325,3,B000BKVKSA,I agree with most of the other reviewers that season two contained several of the best episodes of Vice ever.  I've been really anticipating this release. I just hope that the quality of the transfer is better this time and really does the content justice.  The quality of the season 1 discs was just awful - random pixellation and sound drop outs in many many scenes. Given the time between releases you can't say that they rushed this edition to market.,1134432000,2,455,4.604938271604938
2423326,5,B000BKVKSA,"The second season of Miami Vice is undoubtedly the better of the first two, and therefore the best one featuring the ""classic"" Vice look & style. There are those who actually prefer the darker look of season three or even people who hold seasons four or five in higher esteem (*shudder*), but if you love Vice for the pastels, the Daytona Spyder and the contrast between light glamour and dark cesspits of crime, this is definitely the best episode for you.

Episode breakdown:
Prodigal Son - 90 minute season opener. Crockett and Tubbs go to the Big Apple and take on a group of extremely ruthless and dangerous Colombians, who are actually backed by even more powerful forces. A great eipsode, even though it's not set in Miami. The sequence of Sonny walking the nightly New York streets while Glenn Frey's ""You Belong to the City"" is playing or the powerful showdown at the WTC come to mind.

Whatever Works - Dirty cops and the Santeria cult dominate this well done episode. Features an appearance by The Power Station performing their T.Rex cover ""Bang a Gong (Get it On)"". Again a nicely developing plot and great showdown here.

Out Where the Buses Don't Run - Crockett & Tubbs have to deal with a retired and kind of whacky vice cop who just might lead them to something big. Or not. Episode with a lot of funny moments but also a very strong ending featuring Dire Straits' ""Brothers in Arms"".

The Dutch Oven - one of the slightly weaker episodes, mainly featuring Trudy being torn between love and duty. Not bad but a bit lengthy. Good start though, when Trudy has to kill a suspect in the line of duty and has to deal with the ensuing investigation which puts heavy pressure on her.

Buddies - A young mother trying to make amends in Miami's night life and an old army buddy of Crockett's with ties to organized crime form the parallel plot lines of this episode. Good one, though not excellent.

Junk Love - very strong as well as very disturbing episode, involving a Napoleonic smuggler, his beautiful girlfriend and a very dark secret. Another good showdown.

Tale of the Goat - another cult plot, this time Voodoo. Plot is so-so, but well done and very enjoyable actually. Great acting on most parts. Towards the end Tubbs risks much and nearly pays a very high price.

Bushido - extremely strong episode, how anyone could feel otherwise is beyond me. Castillo gets cought up by his past and has to protect his former associate's wife and son from Russian agents. Features a great villain played by David Rasche (Sledge Hammer) and a memorable showdown in an old ruined villa on the Keys. Directed by Edward James Olmos.

Bought and Paid for - another episode featuring mainly supporting cast (namely Gina) but actually still a very good episode. Gina is out to nail the guy who raped her Haitian friend, but has a hard time doing so because of his father's wealth and connections. Great plot, great performance, rather weak showdown though. Also featuring a nice Lambo - Ferrari chase.

Back in the World - Johnson's first effort as director and not a bad one. Plot is about Crockett's army past reaching back to the last days of the Vietnam war and how characters from that time suddenly reappear in Miami's drug scene. Great plot, good performance, great showdown. Music is exclusively by The Doors throughout this episode.

Phil the Shill - the musical godfather of Vice finally making an appearance - and in a leading role, too. Phil Collins plays a shady game-show host and scammer who settles for a while in Miami and could lead the vice cops to a big time drug dealer. Very memorable episode. If it lacks anything then maybe some seriousness, it's one of the lighter episodes; but still: very much recommended.

Definitely Miami - this episode is so much Miami Vice, it borders on the verge of being cartoonesque. Seems to be THE best episode ever for most fans, though not for me. I find it to be horribly overdone. But whatever, since most people seem to agree on this one being absolutly great, let's say it's at least not bad. Crockett gets involved with an oh so helpless but great looking girl, which in turn is tied to a scamming and murdering drug dealer played by Ted Nugent. Plot and performance aside, the music is actually great once more, the episode features many visually appealing scenes with great camerawork and I have to agree on the ending being outstanding as well.

Yankee Dollar - good but not excellent episode. Nevertheless outstanding for a single scene... a single picture actually: close up of Crockett's face holding a suspect at gun point at his deceased girfliend's house. One of Johnson's finest moments. The overall plot is a bit standard and a bit unexciting, but still a really good episode, last but not least because of the good performances.

One Way Ticket - another very good one. French Canadians, a killed DA and a questionable defense attorney form a plot which doesn't win prizes for innovation but is enjoyable nonetheless. Very well done episode with a great ending.

Little Miss Dangerous - Tubbs tries to help a young [scarlet woman] who might or might not be involved in the killings of a psychopath. A strong plot and a great performance, don't miss out on this one. Once more a great showdown.

Florence Italy - if there are any really weak episodes in this season, THIS is undoubtedly one of them. Which is a pity, because choosing the Miami racing scene as a plot element sounds intrigiung at first. The realization sucks though. The plot is straight and forgettable, the acting sub par - an episode not worthy of this season.

French Twist - really great ep. Unusual plot involving Interpol agents and an international drug dealing assassin, well performed, well done.

The Fix - good episode about a gambling judge and his basketball playing son. A bit cheesy at times, a bit predictable, but overall not bad.

Payback - another outstanding episode. An imprisoned dealer gets his revenge on Crockett by making his supplier (played by Frank Zappa) think that Crockett has stolen $3 million dollars drug money from him. Great boat scenes.

Free Verse - ambivalent episode. Great plot, great performances and for many people probably a great ep. Me, I find the loud, hard partying, chairbound but lyrically ingenious and politically motivated exiled Cuban grandpa quite unnerving and clichd. But see for yourself - if you like his character, you'll love this episode.

Trust Fund Pirates - good episode. Trust fund babies playing murderous pirates and a trafficking pilot who could help Crockett & Tubbs in finding those brats. Really well done, another one worth seeing.

Sons and Lovers - an outstanding last episode for an outstanding season. Angelina Calderon is back and she didn't come alone: she brought her son and tries to protect his daddy - Tubbs - from being killed by her young, but ruthless, half-brother. It pretty much all ends in tears, but true Vice fans wouldn't want it any other way.

And just in case you missed my point so far: if there's any remote chance that you might ever get at least ONE season of Miami Vice on DVD - get THIS one.",1134432000,60,7135,4.717845659163987
2423327,4,B000BKVKSA,"I really liked the series when it was running on television. Some of the clothing and topics may be dated, but you have to realize that this was in the mid '80's, and was seriously cutting edge when broadcast.
  I was greatly happy when the first season was released on DVD, and relived some favorite memories. I was a little disapointed in the transfer to digital, as there was no cleaning up of the print which is most obvious in the opening credits, with grainy shots, and I swear I saw a piece of dust moving on the lense. Anywhay I hope the next release addresses that issue, but even if not, I'm going to buy the series as their released. Gotta love the '80's!",1133740800,2,666,4.32

I have waited for season 2 since season 1 was released. I wish they would push the seasons out faster. Why make us wait?!?!?!

I would buy them all at once if I could!

2423333,5,B000BKVKSA,"Wow, I am so happy to hear that I am not the only one who loves this show!  Miami Vice has such a special place in my heart; for me, it hits the nostalgic factor higher than any other thing from the 80's.  At this point, everything is so post-ironic, nothing is really funny.  But aside from cheap jokes on the pastel wardrobe, MV has withstood the test of time.  It has so many different elemets that totally sets it apart from all the others-- and its influence has spread into so many different aspects of television drama, and really helped define what so many people think of when they think of ""the 80's.""  Miami Vice was groundbreaking for its cinematic approach to TV programming, as well as the incorporation of incredible music (from both Jan Hammer-- hello, ""Crockett's Theme""-- and badass songs from might Phil, Glen Fry, and Tina Turner).

Anyways, I'm sure glad I can now put my feelings into words; in the 80's, I just ""liked it,"" without knowing why.  Now I do!  Rock over London, Rock over Miami.  Now I can watch these episodes over and over and over.",1132617600,7,1069,4.4974093264248705

WARNER BROTHERS IS THE SAME WITH GILLIGAN'S ISLAND AND WONDER WOMAN. SO FAR SONY DVD PLAYER WORKS GREAT WITH THESE.  NOW BACK TO THE MUSIC. UNIVERSAL SHOULD GET ALL THE RIGHTS TO ALL 5 SEASONS OF MUSIC BEFORE THEY RELEASE THE SHOW OR GET RIGHTS TO ADD A HIT SONG FROM OTHER ARTIST IF THEY CAN'T HAVE THE ORIGINAL.

the episode where Jeff Fahey is testing weapons and intentionally blows up Crockett's black car. Crockett's reaction is unforgettable! He soon drowns his sorrows on a new car-a white Testarossa!
