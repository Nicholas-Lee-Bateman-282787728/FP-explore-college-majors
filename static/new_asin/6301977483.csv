400229,3,6301977483,The movie reeks of a school-boyish fantasy for sex. There is plenty of auto-eroticism and a storyline hinges only by the barest of threads- and you guessed it:they are on Bo Derek.  The photography is good and it does give you a vision of the virgin landscape and you walk away with the subliminal message about the beauty of Africa.  END,879897600,3,338,4.524590163934426

400301,5,6301977483,"If you enjoy seeing Bo Derek wearing very little clothes, swinging on a vine in the jungle, I don't mind if the movie isn't really all that good, I think you'd like this. This film received extremely negative reviews, and in some circles has been considered to be one of the worst films ever made, even though it was a box-office success. The actor originally picked to play Tarzan quit soon after filming began, and then they brought in Miles O'Keefe to play the part.
I actually did enjoy seeing Bo Derek wearing very little clothes and swinging a vine in the jungle, so for me it wasn't that bad at all.",1500163200,,606,4.419642857142857

400344,5,6301977483,"Loved this movie. You obviously have to remember while watching that this film was released in 1981 and it's not going to be as fast-paced as movies today. Feels ridiculous even saying that, but with all the negative reviews about how slow this movie is, it feels like I have to say that. Anyways, I adore this movie. Bo Derek has the sweetest character (compared to some of her others). I don't think Miles O'Keeffe (Tarzan) said one thing throughout the entire movie. So this is a Tarzan that I consider one of the more realistic ones. If you like psychology, you'll enjoy watching this movie and analyzing the characters. Overall a good movie if you haven't seen it. It's one of those you can only watch every couple years but still enjoyable and interesting, but mostly, for people who have never seen it before. Worth the money and time, in my opinion.",1473638400,,857,4.607843137254902

I saw it when it 1st hit theaters and in spite of the fact that I was a young man of 20 years old and that Bo Derek was nude in most of the movie, the movies is practically unwatchable.  Naked girls can only get you so far after all!  :)  This is undoubtedly the most horrible abomination I've ever seen on the big screen and I have sat through ""The Beast of Yucca Flats"" 3 times.  I wanted so badly to get up and walk out of the theater but I refused to do so out of pure stubbornness to the fact that I'd just spent my money on the ticket expecting entertainment and I wasn't going to leave.  The slow motion snake fight scene is horrible beyond words.  Tarzan is hardly even in it and is a pitiful disappointment when he is because he's pushed so far into the background that he hardly even matters.

This drama flick takes me back to memory lane to when I was 8 going on 9 years old in the 3rd grade during its theatrical release in the Summer of 1981 when Ronald Reagan was the President and we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had back in 1981-1982.",1393372800,,602,4.522935779816514

400509,5,6301977483,"I watched this movie on Instant Video which was a bonus.  The adventure plot is simple to understand.  A woman took a sea journey to Africa looking for her father, a kind of hunter.  She found him with a living-in wife and his camera-man in a tribe.  The topless and
little clothing were appropriate in this tropical jungle.  There was an ongoing danger not to be ignored.  A flesh-eating group of natives.
She joined her father's exploration.  In her adventure, she experienced many unexpected events:  (1) A lion watching her playful and nude bathing on a beach.  Tarzan appeared and shouted the lion away.  Her father and aid came with rifles to help and that scared Tarzan away.  (2)  Tarzan spied on her journey.  He kidnapped her when she washed her face on a river bank.  His curiosity only.
(3)  One time she was tangled by a water snake.  Tarzan came to her rescue.  He was hurt and tired dropping her and himself by
a river.  Three monkeys and an  elephant came to serve their master.  Her first fear of Tarzan disappeared.  Her curiosity this time.
(4)  Her father and team searched for her.  Finding them together, they were ready to fire at Tarzan.  He got away in puzzle.
(5)  A little while, this whole team was caught by the dangerous group of natives.  Servants carrying tools and food were killed.
They brought the daughter, father and camera-man back to their home quarter.  Their leader was of extra large size.  He killed
the father with an elephant tooth.  This dead man's daughter was handy washed for a sacrifice.  The camera-man watched
the whole scene helplessly.  (6)  Tarzan together with several elephants came to help release them.  A heavy fight and wrestling
turned out that Tarzan was the winner.  At the death of leader, this tribe came to pieces.  The camera-man was happy to be alive
and he chose to terminate this exploration.  But the woman decided to remain living with Tarzan and his animals.
Well, erotic scenes were added hereby on  (1) and (6) addressing hot climate and passion.  Most importantly, the lighting and photography effects were outstanding beautiful.  Bo Derek was the pretty actress and successful director.  An enjoyable film.",1392422400,3,2184,4.781671159029649

400525,4,6301977483,"I appreciate John Derek's ""Tarzan the Ape Man"" (1981) because it's so unique and it does inspire the awe of nature, whether scenic, animal, human or romantic. The plot of the film focuses on Jane Parker (Bo Derek), who goes to remotest Africa in search of her explorer father, James Parker (Richard Harris). She joins his party (which includes John Phillip Law) and they climb to the top of a mysterious escarpment whereupon they discover a wild white man, Tarzan (Miles O'Keeffe). Meanwhile the aborigines don't take too kindly to their encroachment.

The opening MGM emblem tips off that the film shouldn't be taken too seriously: instead of the lion's roar we get Tarzan's famous jungle yell. The movie is generally serious, but in a comic-book sort of way. There's a nice sense of awe as the party traverses through the wilderness (it was shot in Sri Lanka and the island of Seychelles, 1500 miles SW of Sri Lanka), particularly when they discover the great escarpment and, then, the fictitious inland sea.

The animals are great as well, particularly the magnificent lion, the friendly elephant who scoops up Tarzan's body and the playful chimps & orangutan. By the way, the Asian elephant and orangutan present an obvious plot hole since they're not native to Africa. Not to mention James' native babe, Africa (Akushula Selayah), since she's clearly of East Indian stock (although he might've picked her up on a different expedition). Also, the muscular dude who plays the ""Ivory King"" (Steve Strong) is obviously a white dude painted black. Speaking of the Ivory King, Steve Strong really hams it up with bad acting befitting of a gym rat and why does it take so long to simply wake him up?

The second act is kind of boring. It consists mostly of Jane and Tarzan getting to know each other in the jungle. There's a beauty and innocence to the scenes, even a sense of awe, but they're probably too long for the average viewer. Still, the film celebrates this aspect of the human experience much as the Song of Songs in the Bible celebrates the consummation of a man & woman with overtly erotic language (read it and see for yourself).

""Tarzan the Ape Man"" is reminiscent of 1976's ""King Kong"" in tone. Remember the sense of awe of that film coupled with the comic booky material? Remember when Kong bathed Dwan via the waterfall and gazes on in wonder? Remember the stretched-out dramatics? This is what you get with ""Tarzan the Ape Man"". It's an adventure film with a lot of drama and little conventional action. When the action comes -- Tarzan vs. a huge snake and Tarzan vs. the Ivory King -- it's presented in slow-motion, which is strange and hardly thrilling. And, yet, it sets the film apart. ""Tarzan the Ape Man"" takes its time in telling its story; by contrast, 1998's ""Tarzan and the Lost City"" hurriedly jumps from one sequence to the next with hardly any room to breath. They're both Tarzan films but from two completely different approaches. I just viewed them both back-to-back and it's an interesting comparison.

Of course, ""Tarzan the Ape Man"" is a showcase for Bo Derek. She's a beautiful woman both inside and out, but she's not a perfect ""10"" in my opinion. Her physicality is indeed statuesque, but her butt is too flat and her thighs too skinny (sorry if that sounds crude; I'm just being honest).

Miles O'Keeffe LOOKS great as Tarzan, but that's it. He has zero dialog beyond Tarzan's patented yell and, worse, zero depth as a character, except that he's benign and heroic. This is disappointing because Burroughs' books presented him as highly intelligent and even a type of Yahweh (the LORD), as in ""the Lord of the jungle"". But the film focuses on Tarzan when he is first discovered by Europeans (when he knew how to read via kid's books, but not yet how to speak English), so this can be forgiven.

One aspect of the film is outstanding and that's Tarzan's kinship with the various animals. An excellent example is the innocent playfulness of Tarzan, Jane and the orangutan in the closing scene.

Also, Richard Harris is worthy of note because he gives the role all his heart and is convincing. Despite his constant (and loud) blathering he does have some interesting insights -- like the importance of living life to its fullest and the humility to turn to God when he's totally spent (and it works!). In other words, the film isn't just mindless adventure; it features some gems to chew on.

""Tarzan the Ape Man"" was a modest hit in 1981 but, surprisingly, there was no sequel. It would've been interesting to see O'Keeffe's Tarzan develop as a character and his relationship with Jane. But maybe John and Bo accomplished everything they intended to with this film and found the idea of a sequel superfluous.

BOTTOM LINE: ""Tarzan the Ape Man"" is a unique Tarzan film and worth it for the sense of awe -- the marvels of nature, the amazement of animals, the beauty of the (fit) human form and the wonder of (true) sexuality.

400561,5,6301977483,"The incomparable Bo Derek is the star of this remake of the Tarzan story that actually takes itself seriously.  John Derek, in true generosity, avails us of all of his preternaturally beautiful wife's charms.  The first hour of the movie, she is clothed, just teasing us, building up the sexual tension for the obvious eventual full nudity to come.  We get a delightful glimpse of her magnificent nude body early on when she decides to bathe naked in the rolling surf.  What a scene this is!

The plot continues, and takes a strange twist that is of course concocted as a thinly-veiled device to get this amazing creature in the nude again.  The scenes in which she is bathed and painted white by the odd native tribe are among the most innocently erotic in all of cinema.  Silly, for sure, but these are images that you will not soon forget.

The denouement of the ""film"" is the innocently depraved final scene, in which Jane finally gets to play (mostly nude, of course) with her ""Ape-man"" Tarzan.  What makes it even more fun is when one of Tarzan's apes playfully tastes one of her nipples.  The filmmakers hustle that primate out of the scene before he gets more aroused(as the audience surely is by now).  The overly frisky chimp is simply replaced by an equally playful orangutan.  Watching Tarzan, this ape, and Bo Derek frolic in the nude together is either erotic or perverse, depending on your point of view.  This last 5 minute scene, during which the credits roll, and the scene with the white paint, are the points that in the ""old days"" men and teen boys fast-forwarded to with their VCRs.  Today, you can do the same with your DVD, or better yet the digital version of this movie.

Either way, libidinous males (who have not become jaded with the overexposure of the free, explicit internet) will find this movie an absolute joy, with images that will be seared into their brains for years to come.",1358294400,7,1914,4.621301775147929

400607,1,6301977483,"There have been so-so Tarzans, then there have been dull Tarzans, and again, there were some very good ones, but this beats them all in being the worst transposition ever.

No wonder that the Rice Burroughs Foundations sued the Production.

Mind you, I always found that Tarzan was somewhat of a cartoon character out of a mediocre literature piece to start with, just like Superman and Batman of yesteryear.

There has only been one good movie about the subject and it was not a Hollywood production, but rather a French one by Francois Truffaut in ""The Wild Child"" (1970), which connects to Rudyard Kipling's ""The Jungle Book"" and as here, with the Tarzan saga (in some aspects).

The rest is the fruit of their times and the mentalities of people living in those days. As such, they are all dated and show their age.

The only interesting factor in such movies are the locations (although in many cases just stock footage), which document a world gone by, if not animals that are almost extinct by now.

In John Derek's attempt at making an erotic art movie, all you get to see is bad acting (even by seasoned actors such as Richard Harris who really seems bored with the entire subject), if not truly amateurish romancing by Bo Derek which seems more lost than present throughout the movie.

The beau, the mighty Tarzan himself, in the person of Miles O'Keeffe, is just a bad excuse of the male sex symbol and thus reduced to the animal he seems to be.

It is a simplistic and very primitive view of the world he lives in. It is escapism in the purest form. But this does not excuse the stupidity that pervades the entire movie.

If Caligula has been turned in a soft porn movie by Bob Guccione, disappointing all the cast members that were hired in it, this Tarzan is not even that. It is just a feeble attempt to show off John Derek's wife attributes.

Pure exhibitionism, nothing else.

If a lesson can be learned, it is how not to make movies like these, ever.

It seems that John Derek never learned anything from masters like John Ford, Cecil B. DeMille or Orson Welles. Nor did he even consider going to school with John Gullermin or other directors of the Tarzan Series. He would probably have benefited of their experiences and decided to actually do a good movie.

Vanity was all he was interested in. How empty, how sad and how desperate a man must be to come to such a conclusion.

In my opinion, this in one of the most forgettable movies ever made and even if its traces were lost, it wouldn't be a terrible loss for humanity. Actually, it would be nice if it would disappear completely...

We already have enough good movies to care about, and this is certainly not one of them.

What is there to say then about the DVD? In one word?

Conventional. Nothing special.

Thank Heavens, it was a gift (I would never have spent a dime on it and I begged the person who had the bad idea to offer it to me, to refrain to do so for other similar products. I understand that it was meant as a jest... Whatever this might mean...).

It actually landed in my trash bin, because I wouldn't dare to impose such a movie on any of my cinephile colleagues, who might have directed a better movie with their limited budgets at their disposal.

I cannot recommend it at all. I would be ashamed in doing so. Sorry, but there are movies that should better be forgotten than admired, and this one is of this sort.

Poorly written script highlighted by perhaps the most boring monologue ever given by a decent actor (Richard Harris).
Poorly choreographed fight scenes (Tarzan vs big snake, Tarzan vs native).
Poor cinematography & editing: e.g. An excruciatingly long shot up a cliff.  Bizarre and blurry camera work during a otherwise lame snake wrestling scene.

I agree with the poster who said that this film is probably worth seeing just because it is so laughably bad.",1207094400,2,532,5.0227272727272725
400613,3,6301977483,"John Derek's ""Tarzan the Ape Man"" is a strange movie. In Maltin's Movie Guide, Leonard Maltin says he almost felt he needed to devise a rating below ""BOMB"", his lowest rating, in order to rade ""Tarzan the Ape Man"".

So, is it really that bad? Not really. Is it good? Not really. Is it worth watching? Definitely.

First of all, the movie is not so much about Tarzan as about Jane, and her relationship with her estranged father, explorer James Parker. Great actor Richard Harris plays James Parker and Harris gives us some of the most hilarious overacting you'll likely to see in a long time. The drama part of the story, the relationship between Parker and Jane, is laughable, because the dialoge is so silly and because of Harris's absurd acting. Other examples of Harris's overacting is when, at night, they hear Tarzan yell in the distance, and Parker screams ""Oh, shut up, you bo-oring sonuvabitch!""

Jane joins her father's expedition and before long, Jane meets Tarzan, when he saves her from a lion while she's taking a bath (one of several bathing scenes whose main purpose is to show Bo Derek with no clothes.

After a while Jane meets Tarzan again, after he saves her from a snake. He fights the snake in what may be one of the worst ""action"" scenes ever filmed, in slow motion and double exposure, so we don't see what happened. Anyway, Tarzan gets injured and Jane tries to nurse him back to consciousness with the help from an elephant and some chimps, while saying things like, ""I've never touched a man before, but I like it. I like it very much"". Later, Tarzan wakes up and she continues talking to him, even though he obviously doesn't understand English. For some reason she says ""Do you know you're more beautiful than any girl I know?""

Later, when Jane is reunited with her father and his troupe, they're abducted by some strange natives who strip Jane naked and start painting her white. Jane asks her father to tell her a story so she can think of something else while this is going on and he starts spouting something like ""Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.... All the kings horses and all the kings men...."" It's extremely absurd and has to be seen to be believed.

So, the movie is fun, although it could have been slightly shorter for better pace, but it definitely deserves to be a cult turkey. And those who want to see Bo naked won't be disappointed. But whatever everyone else says, I do think she's also a quite decent actress. Miles O'Keeffe plays Tarzan, he doesn't have much to do, but he's sure nice to look at.

400614,2,6301977483,"One need only look at the cover of this DVD to see what the story is really about.  It's not Tarzan, but Jane.  Bo Derek is the #1 selling point of the film, and she is basically the only reason anyone should bother buying this DVD.  Bo Derek is certainly the sexiest Jane ever.  However, she is not the best Jane ever.  That distinction belongs to Andie McDowell in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Greystoke-The-Legend-of-Tarzan/dp/B0001NBLYK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Greystoke - The Legend of Tarzan</a>.  As such, the whole story is centered around her and her attempts to reconcile with her estranged father (Richard Harris).

There is possibly the least about Tarzan in this film of any Tarzan movie ever made.  He is simply a wild man in the jungle and nothing more.  He barely does anything other than wrestle a snake (for what seemed like 1/2 hour) and wrestle a macho native.  There is no characterization whatsoever;  nobody ever asks where he came from or what he's doing in Africa.  It seems that nobody even cares!  The Tarzan depicted in this film is a far cry from the Tarzan of the novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs.  In the novels Tarzan is highly intelligent and cunning, while in this flick he is basically an ignorant brute & nothing more.  I will say that one thing they DID get right was his physique.  A buffed-up Miles O'Keefe fills that aspect nicely.

If you are looking for a Tarzan movie that remotely resembles the vision of Edgar Rice Burroughs, this is not the avenue to go.  The late Richard Harris was a great actor, but even he is not enough to drag this film into the realm of respectability.  As is the case with most John Derek films, the movie plods along at a snail-like pace.  In the end (and this is an unfortunate thing to say about a Tarzan movie), the single biggest reason this flick is worth a look is to see Bo Derek au-natural in Africa.  Basically, the whole movie seems to be a side-trip to see Bo topless.  That's not an altogether bad thing, but.....",1186876800,,2044,4.796561604584527
400615,5,6301977483,"When Bo Derek emerged from Blake Edwards's hit 10 as a cornrow-sporting sex symbol, she and her Svengali-like mentor John Derek--who'd been, at one time, a wooden movie pinup himself--decided that together they'd ""create"" Bo's subsequent starring vehicles. This collaboration resulted in a trio of Bad Movies To Love, including the 1981 Tarzan, the Ape Man. ""Produced"" by Bo and ""directed and photographed"" by John, Tarzan reduced Edgar Rice Burrough's far-from-classic work to the level of a magazine spread on a Playboy bunny in the, er, bush.

Richard Harris, an explorer in deepest, darkest Africa, is expecting the next boat to deliver a cannon, but instead he receives bombshell Bo, playing his long-estranged daughter. Her thespian skills had not improved one whit since her first Bad Movie with Harris, Orca, but blank-eyed Bo clearly hadn't a clue. ""You first-class b--tard,"" she says to Harris, mistakenly believing that the dreamy, ""I've-just-had-the-most-fabulous-orgasm"" look on her face could possibly be interpreted as anger. Bo's utter ineptitude is made all the funnier by Harris's response, which is to ham it up to the skies--and beyond. When Bo leaves his welcoming party, Harris says to his mongrels, ""She didn't find me a pretty sight. Do you think I--overdressed?"" We fully expect one of the dogs to reply, ""No, you--overacted.""

Bo takes command of this soft-core extravaganza by doing what she's best at: stripping off her Banana Republic-style wardrobe to swim--well, perhaps ""bob"" is the more accurate term--in that ocean surf rarely seen in films set in the middle of the Dark Continent. Bo in the buff brings around Miles O'Keeffe, a very buffed Tarzan, and just when it seems that this comely pair might turn the movie into a hard-core porn flick--which would've been a big improvement--Harris literally runs into the frame, screaming at his safari aide (Bad Movie vet John Phillip Law), ""Make camp, make camp, make camp!"" It's hard to imagine how the flick could be any campier. One night, hearing Tarzan's patented yell, Harris bellows back, ""Shut up, you boring son of a ...!""--the very thing that the Dereks should have told Harris. Bo instead calls Harris a ""b--tard"" again, prompting this reply: ""I am. I wallow in me. I indulge myself 100 percent. Take my advice, dear, do the same thing."" As if the notoriously self-indulgent Dereks weren't already way, way past the 100 percent mark!

After O'Keeffe saves Bo from a riotous slow-mo encounter with a rubber snake, his unconscious body gets carried away on the tusks of an obliging elephant as Bo, panting with lust, follows along. Grimacing while picking at her teeth (apparently to suggest that she's thinking), Bo eyes O'Keeffe's physique and says, ""I've never touched a man before...""--a howler that's topped when these two go swimming. ""I feel like I'm reading this in a book,"" Bo exults, as if she could read. ""I don't know whether to laugh or cry or just turn to the next page!"" It all ends, as we'd hoped it would, with local savages forcing a nude Bo down on all fours. ""They're washing me,"" she cries, in one of our most favorite Bad Movie lines ever, ""just like a horse!"" O'Keeffe rescues her--but it was too late to save her career.",1185667200,32,3231,4.979629629629629
400652,2,6301977483,"I had never seen any of John Derek's movies before just recently and wasn't familiar with his work.  After seeing this, I understood what his movies were all about : putting his beautiful woman on a pedastal, make her an object of desire, and sort of indirectly taunt the audience saying ""This woman is with ME"".  He did that with Ursula Andress, Linda Evans, and finally Bo Derek.  Substancewise, this movie leaves much to be desired (and I'm not talking about THAT desire).

Bo plays Jane, who comes to Africa to visit her father on an anthropology trip.  Here she encounters Tarzan in the brush, they have a few meetings here and there which are building to the inevitable.  She is kidnapped by natives and rescued by Tarzan, then leaves civilization to be with the Ape Man in the jungle.

Hmmm ... I guess you just had to be there.  Personally I can't imagine someone going off into the jungle to live among the creatures no matter how hot the guy is (whose communication skills are just a bunch of grunts).  Then again, this is one of those fantasy situations.  For the men it's just about Bo.  For the women, it's about a handsome stranger who takes you off to live in his palace (or jungle) like a somewhat fractured fairy tale.  Fantasies, however, are just that.  Fantasies.

Jane has decided to go to Africa to search for her father who left her and her mother many years before.  On the way she must defend her virtue, kill the crew of the boat she hired, and pilot the boat to her father.  There she finds a man who seems to have had his brains baked in the sun a little too long.

Eventually they all go off to search an escarpment to find the elephant's graveyard.  Once on top they find the giant inland sea and a bizarre tribe living near the graveyard (we only see one dead elephant so at the time I did not know the ""graveyard"" had been found).  They also run into Tarzan who has the habit of not speaking and passing out whenever he exerts himself.

I really got the feeling that the only thing any of the film's creators knew about Tarzan was what they had learned from Johnny Weissmuller films.  The escarpment seems to be about half the continent.  It is nearly impossible to climb so I don't know how dying elephants manage to get up it.  Jane's experiences with the bizarre tribe (where she gets painted white) seem to have been lifted from Ursula Andress's film Slave Of The Cannibal God.

There is very little that is right with this film (other than that it does finally end).  Jane goes from super-able to a frightened schoolgirl but eventually falls for Tarzan and reconciles with her father.  But in the end it is not really worth watching.

The locations (Sri Lanka) are almost as gorgeous as Bo, and the photography (courtesy of John Derek) is equally breathtaking. I enjoyed this film, despite the campy script and preposterous story. It is a silly adventure that shows all the interactions between this sexy jungle duo that usually happened behind the palm trees. I liked the fact that Jane Parker was portrayed as a liberated and independent woman (even though it's supposed to be 1910). I think that Bo's performance (despite the critical backlash) was spirited and appealing. The late Richard Harris seems to overact a bit in his role as the demanding expedition leader, and his constant bellowing gets old after a while. Also, the incestuous overtones make some scenes uncomfortable to watch.  Miles O'Keefe is a wonderful Tarzan (how did that tiny loincloth stay on anyway?).

To this day I think that shot of Miles O'Keeffe (fooled you, huh?) as Tarzan, rising majestically from his crouch, is the single most impressive shot in a Trazan film in the history of the world. The problem, of course, is that despite the title this 1981 film from director John Derek is supposed to be showcasing his wife, Bo Derek, who plays Jane. You would think that have a great looking Tarzan in a Tarzan movie would be a good thing, but he ends up being only secondary eye candy in this film.

Granted, ""Tarzan the Ape Man"" is a legendary bad film, but it is the sort of bad film that you really have to see to believe. You can have a lot of fun laughing at a movie. In terms of Tarzan films this goes back to the Johnny Weismuller approach; actually, it goes beyond, because this Tarzan says absolutely nothing, which would be the Elmo Lincoln approach I guess. More importantly, he looks like if he had to go hand-to-hand with a great ape he would end up standing at the end (compare him to Christopher Lambert in ""Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan,"" which is still the film version that best embodies the original Edgar Rice Burroughs novel).

The big irony here is that if Bo Derek said nothing the film would be greatly improved; the problem with this film is not so much the visual images as the lousy dialogue (this is symbolized by the fact that the film begins with Tarzan's yell replacing the roar of the MGM lion in the opening credit). Bo shared the Razzie Award for Worst Actress with Faye Dunaway in ""Mommie Dearest""; this film might have been bad but it managed to avoid winning any other awards, leaving those honors (or lacks thereof) to the likes of ""Heaven's Gate"" and Klinton Spilsbury in ""The Legend of the Lone Ranger."" Richard Harris plays Jane's father and tries gamely to bring some dignity and intelligence to the film, but Bo's babe in the woods act keeps bringing the film crashing down (when she starts crying about getting painted white near the end of the film is when I lost it).

I had a friend who insisted that this was supposed to be a comedy, an outright spoof, and that nobody should be taken it literally. I have to disagree. They thought this was going to be a more sensual version of the Tarzan story, more like ""The Blue Lagoon"" for grown ups than anything else. However, the black & white films that Weismuller made with Maureen O'Sullivan in the early 1930s during the pre-Code era are still the sexiest Tarzan films ever made. As Bo Derek amply proves in this film, there is such a thing as showing too much skin. The rating for this film has to do with its unintended entertainment value and not its quality. Again, there are simply some films in the Bottom 100 of all time that you have to see to appreciate why they have found their appropriate place in cinematic history.",1095206400,,2966,4.448529411764706

I think Bo Derek is very beautiful as Jane and Miles O' Keeffe is one of the best looking Trazans I have ever seen. The movie is a bit erotic but it is all in good taste and fits in well with the story such as Jane taking a swim in the logan. Bo is a natural beauty and I don't find any smut in this film. It is told from Janes point of view, that makes it different. As amazing as Bo and Miles are to look at,the lacation in the jungle where they filmed has lots of beautiful fottage. It is slow moving at times and Trazan could have learned to talk  but remember he lived in the jungle his entire life, he's even afraid of Jane when they meet. Over all I think this is a great movie. I have no idea why its not more popular. I love it!!Bo is my Hero!!!",1060905600,9,849,3.769662921348315

400693,1,6301977483,"Bo Derek was the Edsel of film-making. While hubby/producer/Svengali, John Derek , was sure that the movie going public, and the world in general, was going to worship his latest puppet/goddess, the public decided otherwise. This movie is easily one of the worst ever filmed. There are bad movies that can still be unintentionally funny and entertaining, (See my review of ""Valley Of The Dolls""),  such as any campy ""B"" movie you might see on ""Mystery Science Theater"", but this filming of the Tarzan tale is just plainly, leadenly, drudgingly awful. Even if something is very beautiful, if you stare at it long enough, it becomes boring. In this flick, it only takes a few minutes to get past Bo Dereks catatonic beauty, until you're bored into a stupor. She may have improved her acting skills since the filming of this movie (she would have had to), and, in recent interviews, she seems to have matured into a nice, thoughtful lady. But back then, there was not a thespian bone in her lovely body, and though hubby John thought she could carry the film, it was not to be. The script is so awful, that there are a few unintentionally humorous lines. And, though there are times when covering ones teeth is appropriate, watching Bo trying to sensually eat a banana (one can almost see hubby-director John off to the side, getting all hot & bothered as he coaches her), it is only stupidly hysterical as she appears totally toothless during this scene. Luckily for the hunk who played the Ape Man himself, he has not a line of dialogue to distract from our Bo on screen, and apparently he had the sense to retreat into oblivion after this films release. Richard Harris probably just went for broke, and acts insane. Compared to this movie, watching any of the old Johnny Weissmueller versions is like watching Olivier. I guess this movie is worth a one time look, at the very least to film students, on how to avoid self-indulgence, cliches, and, boring an audience to death. Or, pop it in if you're having trouble sleeping...in minutes, you'll be snoring away!",1033516800,11,2061,4.725
400694,2,6301977483,"...The only reason I gave this version of a remake 2 stars was because this movie has some darn good location footage.  The guy they have for Tarzan had a good body, heck even a good, different style than usual loin cloth BUT his face was too prissy in my opinion.  If you just want to see Bo naked and never liked Tarzan movies or hate Tarzan anyway, see this ABSOLUTE WASTE OF FILM STOCK. The 1918 SILENT far surpasses this gobbler even in total silence,without ANY noises or music to watch it with!  Weissmuller's 1932 remake is superb.  Yeah, none of the movies are like the Tarzan novels mostly but if there's copies of a book of THIS Bo movie, I'm sure it could be best used for trash can basketball or even for fireplace kindling. This movie is so awful, when it was in theaters, you could hear the PROJECTOR and SCREEN moan in agony!!",1025049600,2,842,4.343949044585988
400695,1,6301977483,"I've been going to movies for more than 40 years now, and this one is surely the worst I ever paid to see. A friend who lusted seriously after Bo Derek dragged me to see Tarzan, the Ape Man, for which I have never forgiven him. Bo is certainly a stunning woman, and after I saw 10, I thought she might be a promising actress too. But then I saw Tarzan the Ape Man, and was disabused of that notion forever. This film lacks any redeeming value whatever, except unintentional laughs. As Tarzan, Miles O'Keeffe may be a hunk, but that begs the question, ""A hunk of what?"" (I vote for granite.) But the ineptitude of Derek & O'Keeffe pales against the ridiculous scenery-chewing of Richard Harris, giving what must be the worst performance ever by a big-name actor. Harris' big moment comes when he says to Derek, ""That...APE...that...BEAST...wants...YOOOUUUU!!!""  As for Derek and O'Keeffe, THEIR big moment comes when they stand up to their necks in the water of a lagoon. O'Keeffe, who never speaks during the entire film, stares at Derek with the glazed look of a stuffed gorilla. Derek, eating a banana (YIKES!), says in her kewpie-doll voice, ""I probably shouldn't tell you this (munch, munch), but I'm a virgin."" If this sounds like your kind of movie, be my guest.

If you are, then this is the movie for you. the scene is set up perfect, a strange native village the air has a smoky haze, the background music is erie sounding, and a lot of native women all painted like scary clowns, and pretty Bo as the center of attention. The native women gang up on Bo and bound her on her hands and knees then give her a hard washing. Afterwords, they paint her with a muddy white paint all over from head to toe even matting her hair with it, a great look for Bo.",970099200,2,640,3.9307692307692306

I have to say both Derek and O'Keeffe  looked just perfect together but that Tarzan in that tiny little loincloth  was almost too much to handle,the body,the face,the hair not to mention the  tan and the fact he does not utter one word throughout the entire film  makes it even hotter. True the film is a shocker in the storytelling  department but the fact is the two leads are just superb,the cinematography  is lush and the music dramatic so,in my mind these things more than  compensate for it so,in my book,as a gay man it rates right up there as a  real erotic film without the obvious cheers!",964915200,6,770,4.7293233082706765

This is a simple adaptation of the Tarzan story where Jane joins her father (Richard Harris) in an expedition. He tells her of the Tarzan legend. She wanders off. During her wet period Tarzan (Miles O'Keeffe) appears on the scene and plucks her. Bo sort of monkeys around. And Tarzan gets snaked. Daddy gets stuck and we all live happily ever after?
