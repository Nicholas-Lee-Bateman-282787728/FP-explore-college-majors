8285138,2,B001BXRRRY,I give the guys filming credit its interesting and I enjoyed seeing hunting in a different country but the film is not awesome.  and there is a lot of downtime.  Overall its worth watching but probably not worth paying full price for it.  I wish we could hunt like that in US.,1356652800,,276,4.269230769230769
