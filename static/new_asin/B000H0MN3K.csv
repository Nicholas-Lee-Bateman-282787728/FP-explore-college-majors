The problem is the odd musical numbers interspersed between the actual documentary.  Literally, you have a singer dressed up as an undertaker dancing and singing on stage with puppet rodents.  Why?  It takes you out of the documentary and is also rather boring.  Its not interesting or entertaining it takes away from the actual film.  The parts I enjoyed was the interviews with the museum owners, JD and Cathee, and the scenes of their strange museum and their even stranger house.  If this had been a straight documentary, with all the ""off broadway"" scenes cut out and the rest of the time used to do more in-depth interviews and scenes, I would have loved it.  I found myself fast-forwarding the get past all the goofy singing parts.  For those of you who get to see this DVD and are interested, go check out the Museum of Death in Hollywood, California.  Yeah, its still open and the owners occasionally hang out there.",1413676800,,1062,4.7228260869565215

I'm sure it may appeal to some Rocky Horror picture show fans, but that's about it.",1374364800,,139,4.0
8135618,3,B000H0MN3K,"This documentary was unusual and interesting, but I can't say that I loved it. The parts of the documentary that showed interviews with the two museum owners was the best part of the film, but it was shot very cheaply. The musical scenes with the weird singing undertaker were my least favorite part of the movie, although they were filmed in a higher quality way. I felt like the musical scenes took me out of the movie. I wish the songs had either not been included at all or had been used as bonus features. However, it was interesting to learn about the museum business from a primary source. The two owners also come off as very likeable people that you wouldn't mind being friends with in real life. If I ever saw their museum open for business, I think I might take a look around.",1371600000,,787,4.397260273972603
8135619,4,B000H0MN3K,"I had seen Dream on Silly Dreamer, another film that Dan Lund worked on, and when I read the description about this film, I was really interested in seeing singing funereal characters and things. Well, for the person who really likes documentaries, this film does present some interesting perspectives and modes of storytelling- while the musical aspect of the story didn't really relate directly to the story per se, the technique was entertaining at least. Don't be carried away, however, the heart of this is a really raw documentary about the history of the Museum of Death in California. While the video quality and raw storytelling of this film are not particularly amazing, you might enjoy this work just the same.",1204761600,,721,4.966942148760331
