Unlike the other wonderful BBC Dinosaur productions, all of which I own and enjoy, someone at the production company decided that sticking with a successful formula was not the way to proceed with this effort. (They should move on to a more productive line of work.)  For reasons known only to the producers of this pile of dung, they decided the best way to present the many wonders of aquatic prehistoric creatures was by way of a stupidly-contrived and executed plot line that gives us an eager time-traveler who gets on his time-traveling yacht, with his time-traveling crew of poor actors, and goes back in time to track, view, swim with, and otherwise harass the giant creatures featured in the CD. Not only does this plot device chew up more than half the viewing time of the miserable CD, it is just plain annoying as the erstwhile time-traveler swims unmolested with some of the most ferocious fish, mammals, reptiles and dinosaurs ever to live in the ocean.  We all would have been better off if the first creature that crossed his path dispatched him and his crew and left us to simply view the prehistoric creatures in their natural environment interacting with other creatures of that time. WHAT A CONCEPT!
The renderings of the sea creatures in this CD is, as always with the BBC productions, amazingly realistic. Of course, all that effort goes to waste on the viewer who is somehow put off by the moronic idea of a time-traveling yachtsman diving in amongst the beasts like a prehistoric Steve Irwin.",1433203200,10,1701,4.647840531561462
8704820,5,B00UA00EBK,"Waiting for Jurassic World New series, I bought this for my children to get to know more about Dinosaur. I bought this at Walmart, and one of my children picked it up and looked at the cover and said, ""Dad, it looks real."" I checked out what he said, and the cover is just amazing with its 3D look texture. I always look for BBC documentary because there is a valuable information that movie doesn't have, and it literally helped my kids to understand why and what. Thus, I think that it would help to enhance your knowledge as well as your kids, too. I think that anyone over 4-5 years can watch this and will grow their knowledge and experience about Dinosaur a lot.",1433116800,3,668,4.352
8704821,1,B00UA00EBK,"First and foremost this is only a re-release of the the past Nigel Marvin Diving with Dinosaurs series from 2003. Disappointing that it is not remarked as such on the case anywhere. Even has a 2015 release date printed.
The show itself is as excellent as all of the Walking With Dinosaur productions so if you didn't have it from its original release definitely get it.
If you have it don't buy this one.  Even as a re-release it could be forgiven if they had improved the resolution but the visuals are not cleaned up.",1432598400,11,519,4.463157894736842
