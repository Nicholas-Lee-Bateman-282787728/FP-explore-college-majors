Once again he displays a well honed and educated intuition in doing this.  One thing that really  came to the forefront for me in this video, is an issue that has disturbed  me through all of the previous videos.  Campbell seems to have a lot of  respect for the primitive cultures that he studies.  This probably helps to  drive his interest and thoroughness in studying these cultures, but at the  same time I think he lacks spiritual respect for modern culture.  This  becomes obvious to me at the beginning of this video when he talks about  how primitive cultures viewed the whole world as sacred, and that modern  civilization has reduced this sacredness to effectively almost nothing.
He especially brings this out in his concept of sacrifice.  In these  older societies, death seemed a much more present issue as people tended to  live short fast lives and cultures tended to endure relatively unchanged  from generation to generation.  We see somewhat of a reversal of this  situation today, where in the developed world, people live longer lives and  culture tends to change quickly within a single person's life.  The  question becomes much less an issue of ""what are you willing to die  for?"", and more a question of ""what are you willing to live for  and supplementary, without which you are unwilling to live?"" (much  thanks to Mark Lewis {one of my Amazon favorites} for this wording).  Bill  Moyers at one moment seems to point to a similar more contemporary sense of  sacrifice when he draws the illustration of the man who goes to work on a  daily basis for the good of his family and the ones he loves.  But as usual  Moyers seems a little too much in awe of Campbell to really press this good  point.
I also wonder at Campbell's thoughts on the distinctly  cannibalistic sense of sacrifice that he so aptly draws to our attention,  in metaphorical terms in regard to Christianity, and in more literal terms  in regard to the New Guinea tribes (that I assume still practiced this at  the time that Campbell described their activities, at least he seems to  imply that they did).  Did he really expect us to accept this picture of  sacrifice as one appropriate for modern society?  He doesn't make this  clear, and I would think that he would expect us to find mythology more  appropriate for our times and circumstances as he has admonished us earlier  in this series.  I don't know that Campbell himself has actually done this  for himself, however, as he seems to continually bemoan what he sees as our  current lack of spirituality and sacredness.
These criticisms aside,  however, Campbell's knowledge and intuition prove exceptionally instructive  in understanding these primitive and even not-so-primitive societies'  mythological understandings of sacrifice and bliss, life and death.  This  video proved a turning point for me in this series, where I finally felt  ready articulate my differences with Campbell, and at the same time and  therefore perhaps more effectively get a lot out of what he has to offer.  I find it particularly fortuitous that I happened to watch this particular  video right after watching a rather culturally intelligent gothic horror  movie about cannibalism (see my movie review for ""Ravenous"").  With the right frame of mind, I think you can get a lot out of this video,  though I don't know that Campbell does a lot for the viewer to develop this  frame of mind here.  But considering Campbell's willingness to so directly  address cultural issues that others might rather avoid or deny, I found  this a valuable learning experience.",959558400,7,3714,4.872990353697749
