8190273,5,B000PC3BEK,"This video is from the mid-90s and is an hour long talk by Pam Stenzel.  This video is her presentation to a Catholic high school and there are a few references to God when she is talking about sexual abstinence.

Stenzel has more recent videos that have slight changes, for example, this one talks extensively about STDs and Human papillomavirus (HPV) as a major STD and cause of infertility, cancer, and other problems.  Since there is now the Gardasil vaccine many people think there is no more problem with any permanent damage from STDs.  Stenzel's point is that sex does have a price tag and although young people think not being pregnant is the biggest concern there is so much more at stake.

This presentation was given at a high school, but since it was made there are now even more casual or lax attitudes about sex in our culture.  I think this would now be something parents of elementary and middle school parents should see and possibly show their children.

Stenzel is very direct and explains why she is so passionate speaking about sex, disease, rape, love, and how people view sex while dating and in marriage.  Excellent presentation and I highly recommend it even for people who do not believe in abstinence.",1367020800,,1229,4.710280373831775

8190275,5,B000PC3BEK,"I truly hope Amazon gets this back in stock soon so that it can be available to the masses.  This is the sex talk that every teen needs to hear.  Teens have a strong sex drive.  That's the fact whether it makes you comfortable to think about it or not.  I have a son in his early twenties, so I know what some parents go through.  But teens are dealing with this subject whether or not that have decided to be active or not.  And once those hormones start pumping, they need to know the real deal.  They need to be informed about EXACTLY what it is they might be getting themselves into.  It's good for those who are already active as well.  Teens sometimes think they know more than we parents do (and sometimes they do about certain subjects), but the information revealed and explained in this DVD -- is stuff they've have never heard.  And maybe didn't really want to, but need to.  It is the real deal, folks.  So you might want to watch it first and decide when you want your teen to watch it.  Everyone is ready at different ages.  You could also watch it to inform yourself and then give the info to your teen in your own way.  This DVD is guaranteed to reduce teen pregnancy and the rampant STDs out there.  Knowledge is power.",1252800000,4,1236,4.262931034482759
