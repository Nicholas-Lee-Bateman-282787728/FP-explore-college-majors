8187644,5,B000OYCMNK,"In the future a war is raging between inhabitants of alternate dimensions. Haruka and Yuu are middle school friends. The war spills over into their dimension. Soldiers tell Haruka that she has the power to end the war. The soldier that tells her this is the future version of Yuu. Dimensions are crossed and alternate versions of the characters are encountered. Can these children avoid their tragic future and change their destiny. Or will they be victims of a tragic fate.

My god this anime is good. The animation is great, the soundtrack is cool, and the characters are very compelling. Noein has a very complicated plot. Sometimes it's a little heavy, but it's great and brilliantly written. There may be a few plot holes, but it's kinda hard to pinpoint because of the story's complexity. This anime also has a lot of good drama in it. The drama keeps you interested and gives you a reprieve from the heavy and complex story.

Don't be intimidated by all the physics and theoretical supposition in this anime. Just enjoy the beautifully crafted love story. I definitely recommend Noein to any anime fan. It's amazing and a steal for the price.",1354752000,,1149,4.768844221105527
