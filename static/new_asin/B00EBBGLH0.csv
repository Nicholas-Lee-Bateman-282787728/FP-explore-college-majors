5901113,1,B00EBBGLH0,"Horrible production!  It was a cross between animation and real life, but it was not artistic, just really bad!  Kids hated it and requested to turn it off!",1386374400,7,156,4.535714285714286
5901114,1,B00EBBGLH0,"I was reading the reviews and I think some of the reviews are on the wrong ""Snow Queen"" movie they certainly didn't describe the movie I just watched, literally, not the same plot or story at all.
Anyway, aside from that, this is possibly one of the most terrible movies I have ever seen. I would have just turned it off but dang it I paid $2.99 and I hate wasting my money... which technically I had already done just by renting it in the first place.
I felt like the entire movie was done by a couple college kids for a project, it was terrible. I don't think I can even put into words how bad this was. The cool looking cover is not even remotely like the movie.
This movie was so terrible I would rather be tied to a chair and forced to watch the entire Twilight series while being force fed expired dairy products than have to watch this awful thing again.",1442016000,,861,4.192771084337349

5901118,3,B00EBBGLH0,it did and it didn't meet my expectations.  I guess I need to read the actual book to understand what the adaptation was suppose to mean.  The acting was good.,1431907200,,159,4.266666666666667
5901119,1,B00EBBGLH0,"The Snow Queen (Nadia Lanfranconi) is evil with magical powers and lives off of love. She has captured the soul of Kay (Robert Amstler) a soldier in love with Gerda (Iren Levy). The Snow Queen is protected by a snow zombie that can only walk on snow. We also knows that his blood smells bad and if your garment comes in contact with it, it must come off and be washed in the river, no matter how cold it is.

The film also flashes to the present where this area is being researched for its ""biophysical signature"" along with two soldiers hunting each other.

The film doesn't make any sense as does any Rene Perez film, the Ed Wood heir apparent. Some of the characteristics of his films is a flip flop from modern times to the past. He did this with ""Little Red Riding Hood"" as well as ""Alien Showdown..."" and most likely a few other films on my want list. The filming location is Napa Valley and he utilized the same set for ""Little Red Riding Hood"" and a lot of the same people. The funniest aspect in this feature is that the Snow Queen has antlers tied to her head, I mean we can see the leather strings. What was that about?

His actors can't act. He can't write a story that doesn't make sense sober. I watch his films because I can't turn away from a train wreak. The dragons, castle, and armies that appear on the Walmart Phase 4 DVD cover are not in the film.

For some people, might be ""so bad it is good."" A few levels below SyFy/Asylum.

Guide: Nudity (Iren Levy-got to get out the blood, Aurelia Scheppers- sleeps topless, Jenny Allford- needs to shower)

Congrats Rene on getting this into Walmart. $9.96 US

Note to self: When running away from a tracking zombie in the snow, don't hide as they can find you from your tracks",1430092800,9,1740,4.319018404907975
5901120,2,B00EBBGLH0,I think that the cover is misleading.  I was expecting a live person video rather than the semi animated version.  The version by Hallmark is far better.  Which is disappointing because I rely on the BBC for a great deal of my entertainment.,1423872000,2,241,4.558139534883721
5901121,4,B00EBBGLH0,"I was so dissuaded by the polarized reviews on this that I opted to buy the Hallmark Bridget Fonda Snow Queen instead -- which turned out to be an overly long and dated drama with a few good ideas and a script so terrible I had no idea if the actors could actually act. I borrowed this BBC one from a friend and will definitely be purchasing my own copy. The key to enjoying the BBC Snow Queen is to know what you're getting into. This link for the Special Edition has no description, but the other Amazon link for this same movie has a much more accurate description of what the film actually is--a fairytale told through music and a mix of live action and animation. It is highly stylized, to the point of distraction I admit, but if you think of it as a children's storybook with moving pictures, it's actually quite beautiful. If you freeze-frame in any scene, it looks like an illustration in a storybook. As a collector of fairytales and storybooks, once I saw the movie that way, i fell in love with it. Undoubtedly if you go into it expecting a normal live action or a normal animated film, you'll be bitterly disappointed, but with proper expectations and an open mind, it's a truly special bit of movie magic.",1419811200,4,1219,4.4222222222222225
5901122,5,B00EBBGLH0,Really good story--Animation was good and story was similar to book--,1408147200,,69,5.363636363636363
5901123,4,B00EBBGLH0,"I had read previous reviews and was a bit put off.... Almost didn't order it because of most of them. That's why I'm writing this review. Our 6 year old granddaughter loved it, and so did we. Well done. A little like The Snowman in its production. An absolute must have for holiday viewing as well as year round! 4*.",1389225600,8,316,4.283333333333333

8603486,5,B00EBBGLH0,"A beautiful, atmospheric fairy tale. The only thing was it would have been nice to have more of the Snow Queen herself. You don't see her much, and her motivation is never explained. But it's a lovely film for those who appreciate the truly magical. There's a kind of story book feeling to it that is unusual, and the film utilizes some kind of drawings come to life (though not like traditional animation) that makes watching this like dreaming a beautiful dream. A hidden gem.",1452643200,,478,4.635294117647059
