2654634,5,B000ICLR98,"It is the classic tale of the changing of the guard as the seasoned veteran is taken down by the upstart heir apparent to the throne. Sampras owned Wimbledon since '93 and his only loss was to Krajicek in '96, but Federer at the 2001 Wimbledon showed the great potential that he has, but still wouldn't be fully realized until a year later when he won the 2002 Tennis Masters Championship and the rest is history. He has dominated tennis since like no player before him, including Sampras. Nadal has been the only player able to show that Federer is beatable, even if it's only on clay. Sampras was on his way out and would retire the next year at the U.S. Open and Federer was just getting going. Both were at the top of their games on that day during the 4th round of Wimbledon. It was a great match with the classic Sampras serve and volley with Federer showing great poise under pressure which has become his trademark. When you watch Federer or Sampras, you can't tell if they are down or up in the match, they just play with the killer blank face. Sampras has a record 14 Grand Slams with seven of those at Wimbledon and was ranked #1 6 straight years. Federer has 9 slams at 25, 4 straight Wimbledon titles and is the first man in the Open era to win at least 10 titles three straight years in a row. Get the DVD to see history as they will both go down at #1 and #2 in the history of men's tennis. Which order they go is up to you, but there is no debating they are the two greatest ever. Sorry Laver. Sorry Borg. If Agassi didn't lose so many finals to Sampras, he would have went down as #2 behind Federer.",1162339200,27,1616,4.216129032258064
2654655,4,B000ICLR98,"A good match, but the 2007 and 2008 nadal federer finals had better quality tennis in them. Dont get me wrong, sampras was a great player but the tennis in here doesnt really show it. The majority of the points are quick and nothing too exciting. This match is just a symbol, the changing of the guard, thats all. If you are looking for good quality tennis, the nadal federer finals are the ones to watch",1224547200,,404,4.328947368421052
2654656,5,B000ICLR98,"** This match has NO Commercials and the coverage continues during the changeovers. Kinda cool to watch what they are doing when the camera on TV normally cut away.

** I watched this DVD on my iMAC - the quality of the video was excellent

** The DVD is divided up (logically) by set. Each set was around 40-50 minutes  - the whole match was too long for me to watch at once but I just watched a set each night. Since I was playing tennis some days in between, it was cool to be inspired by the match

who are the announcers anyway??  One is American by the way - Pat McEnroe??  I saw John McEnroe and Ted Robinson in the background doing the commentary and kinda wished they were announcing here....but the two we heard we very good.

Definitely worth it.",1208822400,7,757,4.251748251748252
2654657,5,B000ICLR98,"I believe that any tennis fan that has not seen this 5-set nailbiter will very much enjoy watching the 'moment' when Sampras handed the keys to the castle to a young, immensely talented Roger Federer. Watching the 19 year old cry at the realization of his victory is worth the price alone.",1208044800,,289,4.576923076923077
2654658,5,B000ICLR98,"This is truly a must have for tennis lovers since it is the only Federer-Sampras match. The tennis is not as good as I hoped. I say this not because of the few rallies (Sampras and Federer were both serving extremely well), but because Sampras was tired and late by half a step everywhere and Federer had not yet decided to stick to the baseline. (He played serve and volley and was not too good at it.) Sampras's serves and Federer's passing shots were breathtaking. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed this excellent DVD with outstanding tennis, good photography and the subdued and knowledgeable British comentators who are a welcome relief from their cacophonous American counterparts.",1201564800,2,684,5.008771929824562
2654659,5,B000ICLR98,"It was the first game Federer played in Wimbledon Central Court and What Debut!!! For Federe to win his idol, Sampras (our - at that momment 7 times Wimblendon winner) in 5 really well played 5 sets, the really prize was happy tears at the end. Unfortunatelly a real revenge - with both playing a first class tennis - have never ocurred.
If you are having problem to find time to stay 3:40 hours go directly to the last game of the last set. Federer's service returns to win the game showed what this teenager would be able to do in the future and I guarantee that you will find the time.",1197590400,,588,4.258928571428571

It is shown in real time. It includes all the pauses between games and sets. This allows you to feel all the drama.

It is a classic in every sense--the ultimate in professional sports full of breathtaking moments when the match could go to either deserving player.

2654662,5,B000ICLR98,"Since this is the only time that Pete Sampras and Roger Federer ever laced up their shoes and battled in a truly competitive setting, this is a historic match. The play is outstanding; Sampras's serve is so fluid and Federer's nerves are truly of steel. Sampras's resolve wavers slightly and it is all over. This match truly lives up to the idea that the tight matches hinge on just a few points. Get this match now!!",1188691200,3,417,4.5
2654663,2,B000ICLR98,What a fantastic match.  It show an emerging Roger Federer and even though Pete is 29 - you can see why he has so great at Wimbledon.  These are both players I truly admire and this match show cases both their talents.,1186444800,,218,4.166666666666667

8144866,5,B000ICLR98,"The ritual of passage for Federer. Stopping in the quarterfinals after beating Sampras to comeback and win the tournament next year.

This is one of the few high level games between two great players that knew how to play old style grass server and volley. Because of that the game can be a little boring for non tennis players that can't appreciate the beauty of this ultra aggressive strategy so I took one star off, but then again if you can appreciate that consider it 5 starts.",1452729600,,482,4.540229885057471

8144871,3,B000ICLR98,"The only reason to rate this match a ""Five Star"" is because of idealism and pity for what would have been a great rivalry. Reality is, in this match: Federer played well -but not great-, and Sampras did not play good -but not bad-.

Back in 2001, the name of Roger Federer was already among those called to be the next generation of Champions, along with some that lived up to their expectations like Andy Roddick, Juan Carlos Ferrero, Marat Safin and some other guys who didn't get to shine as expected, such as Andreas Vinciguerra and Tommy Haas. There were already comparisons of Federer and Sampras, stating how the Swiss had a great serve and a huge forehand, with an ""ok"" backhand. Sampras on the other hand was -for lack of a better way to put it-, on his way out. People seem to forget that Sampras struggled for 5 sets in the second round to beat a guy ranked in the #100s-#200s called Barry Cowan -who by the way, nobody ever heard of ever again-. Prior the Federer match, Sampras also had a weird straight-sets victory against Sarjis Sargassian (spelling?), where he kept falling in the court and miss hitting shots everywhere. To me back then, it was clear that the 2001 Wimbledon Champion wasn't going to be Pete Sampras. To get an even better picture: after this loss, Pete also lost in five sets on grass... to Alex Corretja, in a Davis Cup tie. The tennis world had to realize that Pete's dominance at Wimbledon ended in 2000.

Had Sampras won this match against Federer, he probably would have been outsted by Tim Henman in the next round, who was playing great that year. Had he won that match, it would have been Goran Ivanisevic waiting for him in the semis, and had he made it to the finals, it would have been Pat Rafter his executioner. I know this is all speculation and that we will never know, but I'm quite sure any of Tim, Goran or Pat would have defeated Pete at the 2001 Wimbledon.

The first set of the match is kind of a ""study my rival"" set. At first Sampras plays just like any other day against any other unknown/unheralded rival, but somewhere around the 3-3 score where he saves a triple break point, he realizes that this kid is playing with nothing to lose and this confuses Pete. It seems that from that moment and on, Sampras doesn't know what to do to deal with Roger. Let me put it this way: if Sampras was a 6-speed engine, it looks like Pete is happy playing at 4th gear, meaning that he does the bare minimum to hold serve, but he doesn't do any effort to get a break or put Federer out of his ""nothing to lose"" mindset. So Sampras appeals to the strategy that had been so successful for him in the past: get to the tie-break, where the rival will likely choke. However Federer doesn't choke at all, as he goes toe to toe with Pete. The tie-break shows proof of the tension and nerves between both players: only 2 passing Winners by Sampras, against 1 by Federer; it also shows Pete arguing a call about a long serve. Overall, the tie-break is well played by both players and after a good display of his future trademark shots, Federer emerges as winner of the first set, when Sampras misses a down the line backhand passing shot. You can see Pete almost getting ready to toss his racket onto the ground, but he manages to contain himself, keeping the posture, elegance and quality of a gentlemen that characterized him. You can't defeat Roger Federer winning 6 out of 18 points at the net... even if he's 19 years old.

From that moment, the fall of Pete Sampras at Wimbledon begins.

Like I said before, he never shifts to 5th gear and is satisfied playing a passive/percentage game, which somehow allows him to win two sets and take the match to a decisive fifth. All through the rest of the match, Federer never gives up, eases down or shows any sign of having a breakdown... at ALL. That's truly remarkable, considering how unexperienced he was back then, the stage where he was and who he was up against. After each loss of a set, Roger regroups himself and starts all over again, as if the match was starting from scratch. The only chance Pete had to win the match came on the fifth set, when on a crucial break point that if converted would have let him serving for the match, he unexplainably backhand-sliced an easy Federer serve (prolly around the 80 mph mark). The ball floated very slowly and fell short right into Federer's forehand, who cold-blooded whipped the crap out of the ball to save the quasi-match point that would have sent him home back to Switzerland.

The quality of the match is mediocre at best. Forget about seeing displays of the 1999 Pete or the 2007 Federer. There are no fantastic or spectacular points through the match. Not one -at least in my opinion-. There are some ""yay"" or ""ooooh"" points, but nothing else. You can see some glances of what would come to be Federer's whipping forehand and some flashbacks of Pete's magic shots, but that's about it. At one point the commentator states ""Pete must be thinking: I can do this for five sets, let's see if he can"". That sentence summarizes the entire match. Pete placed a bet and he lost.

The real sad aspect about the whole thing is that just like my review title says, this was the only match we got to see between Roger and Pete. Honestly, I would have preferred them not meeting at all in their entire careers. This match doesn't do any justice to either of them. It shows an aging Sampras against an underdeveloped Federer.",1341792000,,5462,4.472417251755266
8144872,5,B000ICLR98,"This is required viewing for any die-hard tennis fan. You have the unique pleasure of witnessing here a cross-generational battle of sorts between the top-two grand slam champions. Naturally, the Nadal/Federer encounters, fought out largely from the baseline, contrast markedly to this affair, which is one of the last fine examples of serve/volley tennis. I have only become a tennis addict in the past three or four years, and I can say that watching Sampras (albeit slightly past his prime here) was a real treat. The video is worth the money alone for those who would admire Sampras' consummate serve. And yet Federer excels in this and in so many other categories, and the match is fought out with great intensity. I should add that the commentary is informative and entertaining, and it is remarkable how BBC commentator Peter Fleming mentions at one point that Federer will certainly win ""multiple Grand Slam titles"" even though he had not yet won any in 2001.  Prophetic words indeed!",1308441600,,992,4.975903614457831
8144873,4,B000ICLR98,"A classic match, in terms not just of its historical interest but also of the standard of play.

8144874,5,B000ICLR98,"The tennis here speaks for itself - two exquisite talents going for their shots - absolutely mind-blowing stuff.  And it's just a plain old lot of fun to watch this match from a historical perspective.  The commentators refer to Sampras as ""The Great Man"" and take the measure of the then-unproven Federer as the match goes on.  My favorite quote goes something like this: ""There aren't too many people who don't pick this man to win several Grand Slams in his career.""  Hee hee.  Federer acts out his frustration a couple of times and you have to remember this is not too long after he got himself under control.  And of course he's so young here, with his ponytail, acne, and shadowy pre-Gillette face.

I'd never bought a match on DVD before and wondered if I'd watch this once and then let it gather dust, but I'm watching for the second time as I type this review.  Oh the chip returns!  The extreme angled volleys, the running passes!  The one and only drawback to this match is you will positively cry for the return of serve-and-volley tennis.",1251158400,,1051,4.572192513368984
