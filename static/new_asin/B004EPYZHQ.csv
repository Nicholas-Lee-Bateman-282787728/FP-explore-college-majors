4338126,5,B004EPYZHQ,"Hilarious, laugh out loud funny!",1478044800,,32,5.6
4338127,5,B004EPYZHQ,"Karl Pilkington is Britain's working-class ""Everyman"" and unintentional comedic genius who was ""discovered"" shortly after becoming Ricky Gervais' XFM Radio producer in the late 90s.  Nearly every word out of his unfiltered mouth is hilarious.  His observational humor-- which, again, is innate, non-scripted, and entirely unintentional--  puts Jerry Seinfeld to shame (sorry, Jerry!), and his perfect comedic timing is the sort which professional comics work their entire lives to perfect.  In ""An Idiot Abroad,"" a program Gervais refers to as ""the most expensive practical joke"" he's ever played, we find ""homebody"" Karl forced out of his ""comfy Hobbit hole"" and pushed to his absolute limits in exotic locales where Ricky and writing/producing partner Steve Merchant set him on all sorts of-- ahem-- ""adventures"" (misadventures would be more apt) in an attempt to wind him up... and Karl is INDEED wound up as an often-exasperated and, to use one of his common phrases, ""fed-up"" fish out of water in the various fleabag motels and shady areas of popular tourist destinations his two ""bully"" friends send him to ""explore.""  Poor Karl constantly finds himself in situations where he doesn't know a WORD of the language, is TOTALLY unfamiliar (and hilariously uncomfortable) with the local customs, and is forced to eat ""food"" that most westerners generally think of as bait.  The results of Ricky ""poking a stick"" at ""cornered"" Karl are nothing short of brilliant, with Karl never failing to react in his inimitable disgruntled-but-lovable manner.  It doesn't take long before one feels Karl is an old friend, a friend whose unassuming, down-to-earth authenticity is a warm, comforting blanket and whose whacky perspective on life reflects a truly bizarre but strangely-insightful mind.  ""An Idiot Abroad"" is a highly-addicting MUST see... over and over and over again!!!",1474329600,4,1871,5.361774744027303

Sometimes close captioning is necessary to get through the thick accent, but when you get it, it's just laugh out loud hilarious.

4338206,5,B004EPYZHQ,"If you are looking for a hilarious comedy from the genius who brought you the office, look no further.  Karl Pilkington is hilarious as himself, the reluctant traveler with Ricky and Stephen getting him to do awkward things on his travels.  Obviously there is some humor that is specific to the UK culture, but it's still funny in America.",1441152000,,339,4.728813559322034

4338208,5,B004EPYZHQ,"I have just ""binge watched"" the entire series and am so tired from laughing I now feel like Karl. Karl is a gem of a find for Ricky and Steve's boisterous and hilarious genius. I loved this show and feel so guilty about laughing uncontrollably that I know I just watched genius television. Karl is a dear and essentially kind and daft host to the travel show of the Seven Wonders of the World. I now actually want to see ""the wonders."" No puff pastry here.
Ricky and Steve are brilliant, as usual, and know the limits of how to produce a show that could end up on the wrong side of funny. That's an element that I found surprising in a comedy. The tension and anticipation of what could go wrong was a driving force in watching it to the end. But all is well and I adore Karl and his personality throughout. He is so honest it hurts to laugh.
I absolutely loved it and would atch it all over again",1439164800,3,897,4.190751445086705

4338210,5,B004EPYZHQ,"This is truly a laugh out loud experience. Carl thinks he's on a vacation, but nothing could be further from the truth. This combines a comedy with a travel log. When a program leaves you wanting more, that's a success.... Thankfully, there's season 2.",1438732800,,252,4.75
4338211,5,B004EPYZHQ,My daughter loves this.,1438387200,,23,5.0
4338228,3,B004EPYZHQ,"The premise is promising: Gervais and Merchant will send Karl Pilkington abroad and record his reactions to the wonders of the world and the locales in which they are located.  This in itself would be enough for a successful show, since Karls views are, by turns, quirky, offbeat, zany, philosophic, insightful, and hilarious.  He virtually never smiles.  He is the perfect, deadpan straight man; to put him in unlikely locales is to insure an entertaining result.

Unfortunately, Gervais believes that the maximum hilarity will result when Karl is put in the most unpleasant circumstances.  Thus, some of the finest scenes are juxtaposed with scenes that simply make the audience (at best) queasy, at worst, disgusted.

Great scene: Karl at the Great Wall of China, realizing that the tourist section has been rebuilt within the last several decades.  He opines that it is merely the all right wall of China.  When he later stands alone, in ruined, unmaintained sections of the Wall, we are entertained by his comments but also instructed by the reality of the situation.  This is one of the superb side results of the travel/comedy/documentary: we see what tourists are not supposed to seethe cattle chutes that you need to negotiate to get to the Great Wall or soiled diapers swirling in the air around the pyramids.  Thus, parts of the episodes are sweet and clever, some so funny as to induce coughing jags, some very instructive and informative.

On the other hand, Gervais desire to put Karl in a corner and poke him with a stick verges on the sadistic, not just in what Karl is forced to endure, but because of the fact that Karl is our speaking voice, our most familiar presence who is by turns amusing and correct.  The situations are funny and endearing in many cases because he represents our point of view, our likely response to events.  When he sees roaches for sale in a Chinese food market he comments that if you saw one of those in a restaurant in England the place would be closed by the health authorities.  When he encounters Chinese toiletsholes in the floor over which you are to squatthat have no doors, he is nonplussed.  He wonders why everything in our culture is made in China but none of the things made in China are available in China to the Chinese.  This is wonderful comic material, but when Karl is housed in a pathetic Cairo hotel with constant, all-night horn honking on the street below, we do not find it funny.  Under different circumstances some would describe this degree of sleep deprivation as torture.

Along with the queasy, however, we do get some knowledge.  For example, when Karl is forced to stay in an utterly squalid dormitory/bar facility in Rio we see the lengths to which the Brazilians will go to save money, drink all night and participate in the Carnival.  Later, Karl is required to stay in the roach-infested apartment of his guide, a female impersonator.  Karl also finds himself on a nude beach with beaucoup full frontal male nudity.  The adolescent sex humor continues in Cairo when Karl is fed a meal consisting of male appendages.  Im not sure which is worsethis entr&eacute;e or the sheeps heads served in a Bedouin tent.

There are also some fascinating, unexpected events.  At Petra, for example, Karl sleeps in a cave occupied by some friendly locals and has one of the most pleasant experiences in the series.  He wonders, there, which is preferableto live in a palace and look out over poverty or to live in poverty but have, as your view, a palace.

Thus, I give the series 3 stars, 5 for riveting, clever, instructive, hilarious television, 1 for painful, unwatchable, sadistic television.",1437350400,2,3664,4.8022328548644335

4338308,2,B004EPYZHQ,"After watching  a couple episodes of ""An Idiot Abroad,"" I had trouble sleeping because of the suffering of this man.  The look on his face as he looked up at his would be captors showed a level of fear, confusion and pain which I found to be unbearable to see.  Having watched ""Extras,"" it seemed impossible to believe that Ricky Gervais would deliberately cause a person to be sick, hungry, sleepless and afraid.
  At the beginning of the episode where Karl is in China, Karl says ""is he havin a laugh? and I thought that perhaps Gervais, Merchant and Pilkington are `avin a laugh"" on us and that this was a deliberate reference to ""Extras."".  I hope that is the case.  This would mean that the viewers are shown to be the sadists that those who made the show suspected they would be.  I also began to doubt that Karl is the childlike person he is portrayed as being because although childlike people say funny things at times, they tend not so say funny things continuously. Also, Karl Pilkington makes no funny comments about a man whose face is deformed.  Perhaps Karl Pilkington is a very clever man who is good at keeping a straight face.",1422921600,,1144,4.514563106796117

If you like TV Sitcoms with fake laughs tracks and staged stupidity, you may not like this show.  Humor may go way over some people's heads.

Maybe it doesn't speak well for me, but Karl is kind of my hero at the moment! Here is a basic shlub, admittedly not interested in travel or learning about new cultures, yet he goes on these treks plotted by Gervais and his equally-evil pal Merchant. And through all the expected misadventures, Karl ends up with some insightful-in-a-twisted-way observations, delivers some hilarious analysis, and manages to carry on, regardless of how much he whines while doing it (example: ""I don't really like 'fun'. ..when someone asks if I'd like to have some fun, I tell them 'no, I'd rather not'"") This series is so good that it stands up to multiple viewings.",1372896000,3,795,4.810218978102189

4338950,5,B004EPYZHQ,"I laughed out loud throughout this series because this ""idiot"", a stick-in-the-mud from Manchester, England, our hero Karl Pilkington, is the me I feel I'm rapidly becoming.  Yes, in my 20's I loved world travel and adventures, but now that I've done them, backpack and thumb out on the road and all that, I'm very, very, very happy and content to watch films like this that show the confusion, depression, discomfort and loneliness of foreign travel.  Miserable hotel rooms, disgusting toilets, food one can't eat, strange harassing foreigners, weird blank faces (the Chinese), bad smells and air pollution and heat and dust:  yes, this is real travel.  Get to know the Egyptians, get up and dance with that bellydancer on the Nile Cruise by night - so that the Egyptians can have a laugh at the goofball white guy trying to boogie!  Listen to cars honking all night, ride a camel through the slums, do it all so that you can have something to think about for years to come - not to mention, laugh about, write about and tell about to those willing to listen.

Karl Pilkington is married, has a wife and home, seems content in a fuddy-duddy, nonambitious, toodle-around-the-toolshed way.  He seems to be the perfect husband, who will never roam, always be handy (mending a fuse!), happy to have his dinner (chicken and chips), a beer, and not even have too much of a social life with excess drinking.  Reliable, dull, unobtrusive, inconsequential - a typical old-fashioned English working man of the most sought-after sort by women of sense:  yes, this is the man least likely to give a hoot about the Seven Wonders of the World, and for this reason he is the one sent to go looking at them, followed by a film crew and occasional translator.  He gets a paycheck out of it, and we get a great laugh.

Don't forget, if you watch this series, you can avoid wasting your own time and money and aggravation on your own trip, simply by seeing the scenery, the natives, the food and the transport, and then skipping the real thing.  I have to admit that it's ""real travel"" films like this that provide my pea-sized brain with fake adventures and, at the same time, true images of life abroad.  Then, when I do meet natives of those countries, which I have to do daily as a tourguide in San Francisco, I can make up all kinds of nonsense and actually fool the denizens of India into thinking that I have seen their country and that I LIKED their country.

Of course, I have never been there, but that's okay, with films like these as aids!  And will I see the tourists again? No!  But they're happy and so am I!  WE have a wonderful time!  Who doesn't love Indian food, served clean and hot in USA?

Sometimes it doesn't work - I can lie and say I've been to Saudi Arabia, but certainly I can fudge that I have friends who've worked there and they LOVED it.

Yes, all of us should watch these short films for laughs, but also for information, and for a general sense of these foreign countries.  If you have done the backpack student travel when younger, you'll enjoy seeing it all again; if you have never done so, it will be a fair substitute and certainly far safer and cheaper and MORE FUN!!!  It will not be YOU who is suffering indignities, bad weather & discomfort!",1365206400,2,3266,4.5281090289608175

Ricky Gervais and Steven Merchant think of evil tortures for this poor guy.  They book horrible hotels for him, introduce him to strange people and set him up with crazy adventures, e.g. 8 hour camel rides across the desert.  It was just great fun.

We hoped they would re-air the episodes from Season 1. My Mom was born and raised in Britain, so we told her about the show and would watch episodes with her when we visited.  She fell in love with Karl and the whole show.  She really enjoyed listening to the accents from home too.  She's 75 and finds it so amusing, along with us, and absolutely loves it.  She's housebound most of the time, so after we'd watched season 2 several times over, I decided to buy season 1 for her (well for all of us really) and had it sent to her from Amazon as a surprise.

4339435,5,B004EPYZHQ,"Poor Karl, sent out by his ""friends"",  Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant,to tour the Seven Wonders of the World. Karl believes that it is a show with a title like Karl Pilkington visits the Seven Wonders of the World, or some such title, however what he really becomes a part of is ""An Idiot Abroad"".  Sounds grand doesn't it?  Travel to fantastic sights across the globe....well, not quite, as you see Ricky and Stephen plan excursions for him like bull riding, wrestling, camel riding and anti terrorist training.... They are intent on making his experience as far out of his comfort zone as humanly possible.  How about a lovely 8 hour camel ride across the desert?  Or maybe a lovely dinner of toad or bull testicles and other parts for dinner?  Karl does not have top notch fancy quarters, and he has a face that truly expresses every thought he is thinking....much of which is the ""wtf""? look.....

In every stop he is forced to get out of his comfort zone and learn about his surroundings.  He is a good sport, dressing in local dress, taking on local customs and trying some of the new foods that come his way, but honestly, in the China episode, having a bag of chips would have probably been where I would have started too.

The photography of the series is wonderful and Karl is a bit naive and wide-eyed, so it is priceless watching him make his way through the adventures and then the calls from the office checking to see how he is doing, while they send him on yet another crackpot adventure before he actually goes to see the next wonder.

Laugh out loud funny!  I would definitely recommend to those who enjoy travel, those who never want to travel and those who just need a good laugh.  Highly recommended!",1330214400,5,1725,4.546925566343042

You don't necessarily to be well prepared or even know anything about a particular place to have a good time. That's the message I enjoy most about this show. I find that it encourages me to want to travel to certain locations that I may have been wary about before because Karl is just a regular guy like me and he got along just fine. This show takes the ""scariness"" out of certain exotic locations and portrays them in a very human, non-biased way.

The show itself is hilarious, and the interactions of Karl and the native peoples are priceless. I enjoyed this show very much.

Karl is game for virtually anything, and while Ricky & Stephen frequently set him up to fail, he generally perserves with aplomb and spirit. Yes, he misses his home & his friends, but he does as he is asked with gusto, generally speaking, and his personal growth as a result is evident.

I watched this on Science Channel when it aired the first time. I don't think that I have laughed that much in my entire life. This is probably the most hysterical thing I have ever watched.  Karl is just fantastic; hilarious, honest, blunt - EVERYTHING. He thinks about things in a way I can understand. I just get Karl. All that aside, Ricky and Stephen really throw him into situations that are way beyond Karl's comfort zone.  That, in turns, makes this entire series hilarious.

At the beginning you are literally like ""What is with this guy?"" But by the end you love Karl and have the achiest sides ever because you have laughed so hard. I tivo'd the entire series and have watched it several times because it is simply too hilarious.  WATCH IT. YOU'LL LOVE IT.

4339542,5,B004EPYZHQ,"AN IDIOT ABROAD is a travelogue like none you have ever seen before.

Created by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, this hilarious television series from BBC Video centers on their friend, Karl Pilkington, a rather laid-back guy who does not enjoy venturing out of his own limited comfort zone.

Ricky and Stephen send Karl on a journey to visit the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, but what they don't tell him is that, as he visits countries like China, India, Jordan, Brazil, Mexico, Egypt and Peru, they will also be sending him on some side trips that the average tourist would never even consider taking.

In China, for example, this poor guy from Wales is assigned to walk the entire Great Wall, while in South America, he treks into the jungle where he meets a native tribe that could, possibly, be cannibals.  Karl's imagination does run overtime.

Yet, none of this is really as bad as some of the things he is forced to eat during his travels, everything from bugs to toads to testicles.

Gervais says that, with this series, he has played ""the most expensive practical joke"" in his life.  Certainly Pilkington's reactions to the often less than civilized worlds that he encounters are laugh-out-loud funny.

For the most part, Gervais and Merchant just appear in the opening segment of each of the eight one-hour episodes (on 2-discs), leaving Pilkington to garner the vast majority of the guffaws.  And, there are plenty of those.

4339544,3,B004EPYZHQ,"I love the podcast and Karl, its just that I feel they really abandoned what makes the podcast great: their interaction.

Some of the best moments in the podcast come when Ricky just totally loses it because Karl is going off on some odd tangent. Ricky and Stephen have made an art form of cornering Karl and forcing some brilliant, idiotic, or both statements out of him.

Karl by himself is funny but not fascinating.  Also they put him in some fairly uncomfortable situations- Ricky and Stephen would never stay in a $10-a-night hostel for example.  They use discomfort to force the funny out of Karl, which is the wrong way to go about it.

I think a better format would have been for each episode to have the three of them watch selected footage together, with Ricky and Stephen sort of showing Karl (and the audience) samples as a set up to a more podcast-like conversation.",1325635200,3,880,4.579617834394904

My only problem with this show is the fact that they sent Karl to see The Great Pyramids in Egypt but not to The Colosseum in Rome, Italy. It may be because Karl has already been to Rome (as mentioned on the XFM radio show). However, The Great Pyramids are NOT one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World, but The Colosseum is. The Great Pyramids were given a special honorary status as the 8th Wonder when the new wonders were being decided on because it is the only ancient wonder still in existence. I have no problem with Karl visiting The Great Pyramids, but they shouldn't leave out the fact that The Colosseum IS one of the modern wonders, and he should have visited it. By leaving it out, the show provides misinformation about the Seven Modern Wonders of the World. It's misleading, and I know Ricky and Steve are better than that.

They also should have done more promotion when airing it on The Science Channel.

To the food, Karl was exposed to different foods (watch China, Jordan & Egypt), which NEVER went well. And bathrooms always seemed to be an issue for poor Karl, so much so that by the last country, Peru, Karl made his own ""toilet"" out of a folding arm chair!! Also by Peru I truly believed Karl was going to lose it on camera. The really gem (an obliviously the purpose) of this show was hearing Karl's observations/opinions on the different cultures and the Seven Wonders!

Without trying, completely spontaneous and genuinely insightful - our man Karl Pilkington is hands down the funniest guy living on Planet Earth today.

Certainly there have been moments - in my own life and those that come from the entertainment field - that have had me in tears, crying so hard from laughing. The first time I saw the late&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sam-Kinison/dp/B00005NOO7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sam Kinison</a>, the moment when a friend ate his entire meal then discovered a fat cockroach at the bottom of his bowl, the combat/spear and hippo birth scenes in 'Ace Ventura, When Nature Calls'. Moments that I'll carry with me the rest of my life.

But this guy Karl - this guy is beyond humorous. He's like the Dalai Lama of comedy, delivering the rawest, most truthful, insanely funny things ever uttered by man.

He's added to my moments of hilarity by a hundred fold.

And to be fair, everyone who 'gets' this show, owes a debt to Ricky Gervais. Despite the fact that he's a self-absorbed, cruel, arrogant smartass, the bottom line is: Without his efforts there would be no one outside of England who would understand, could possibly understand, the phenomenon of Karl Pilkington.

There is NO WAY any single post or review can adequately capture the essence of Karl - the purest laughs he creates. No way.

So I'll say this: Watch, listen and be in awe.

I only wish there were a 17-star rating on Amazon.

UPDATE 6.1.11: Fans may or may not have heard that, despite years of protests and absolute refusals (remember his famous ""nip it in the bud"" scene in Peru), Karl has agreed to a second season of 'An Idiot'. Tentatively called ""The Bucket List"", it's filming as I write this. And if you want to get an INSANELY HILARIOUS preview - check out the podcast found via several different download services. There's no video, but Ricky plays a recorded phone message of our guy stuck in Alaska! I won't say anymore. Check it out and I promise - you'll end up crying it's so funny.
