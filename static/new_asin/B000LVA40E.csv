8164360,5,B000LVA40E,"I gave a copy to the Pastor of a church years ago, who presented the video to the congregation. He told me, that when it concluded, you could have heard a pin drop. Extremely moving to anyone who loves rap, and has an open heart to their previously unknown knowledge of the heart of God. A lot of great work and thought went into this astounding production, which is acutely detailed, accurately using God's Word to explain. If you are questioning if rap music is a problem for your spiritual walk, this is the video for You! Well worth the small expense.",1373155200,,555,4.450980392156863
