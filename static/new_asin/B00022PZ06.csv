8020748,4,B00022PZ06,"Last night's bargain-rack movie was ""The Discoverers,"" an IMAX film adapted to DVD. I've watched a number of these adaptations and I would put this as the weakest of the lot. It's not that it's bad, not at all. I think the problem is that it's spread too thin over too many topics. In a very short film, it discovers (touches upon) eight different topics. The photography is spectacular, of course. What did you expect? But just when you're getting overwhelmed by something like the filming of the Aurora Borealis (absolutely astonishing), you're abruptly whisked off to the next subject. It just doesn't work well. Actually, this film might work much better if it was the introduction to IMAX films to gradually introduce a viewer, and then it would be on to the real subjects.

Well, if you watch ""The Discoverers,"" be sure to watch ""The Making of The Discoverers"" which follows. It covers much of the same territory, but from the point of view of how it was done. Both are very interesting. I just think that of the IMAX films I've watched, this is the lesser.

It is a classic film, and hopefully this will be available in BD format.  All IMAX films distributed on BD format will be the closest thing in your home theater to the REAL IMAX experiance in the IMAX theater.  For more info visit [...] Until then Future Thrill Seekers...

8020750,5,B00022PZ06,"I was suprised at the negative reviews... more like I was SHOCKED! I don't get it, why are people saying it was ""disjointed?"" It flowed together like visual, symbolic, intellectual poetry! It was simply beautiful. If you are not that erudite, it might not make sense to you. This was high art. the imagery of the cave paintings found by a curious child meshed like the painting of a great master with the dolphins learning and perceiving symbolic imagery on a television screen under water. The sheer genius of that alone had me on the verge of tears... A beautiful message of the soul is how I would describe this film in one sentence. The part about Isaac Newton shows his unique eclectic reason and insatiable logic and curiousity better than 1000 words ever could! They did not call him ""the Lion"" for nothing!

An amazing film. Absolutely loved it. The connections between the stories are supposed to be made in YOU. which, again is a reflection of the basic thesis of the film. A beautiful echo. Very poetic.",1207267200,,1014,4.664804469273743
8020751,2,B00022PZ06,"As many have said, this was not the best IMAX movie ever made.

I wanted a copy for myself because I have a 10 second cameo in this movie (am I vain?).  I worked on the Magellan Venus Radar Mapper project at JPL, and helped generate the images that went into the simulated flight over the surface of Venus.  This was probably the only part of the whole movie worth seeing.  My coworkers and I were invited to see this movie at its first public showing at the IMAX theater in LA.  I was blown away by the simulated flight segment, even though I had seen it many times before in our labs.  Even so, I found it difficult to spend money on this weak piece of work.

With my apologies to Greg MacGillivray.",1196035200,,701,4.186567164179104

8020753,3,B00022PZ06,"I have pretty much all of the WMVHD disks (including the more obscure ones like Muffin Man and Step Into Liquid).  The film transfer of this title isn't as crisp as the other IMAX titles, and in general, the cinematography is not as stunning.  Still nice, but it just doesn't compare to the others.  The story line is a little campy, but they do a good job of covering a lot of ground, from 1600's to the future, showing how explorers risk everything to break new ground.",1102982400,15,471,4.390804597701149

An even worse book of the same ilk is Connections by James Burke.",1090195200,3,105,4.833333333333333
8020755,1,B00022PZ06,"I purchased this DVD as a teaching aid. It is worthless from a pedagogical point of view. It is nothing more than a pastiche of disconnected topics. It displays none of the intelligence nor logic of Boorstein's book. It's not even very entertaining-- a colossal waste of time, money, and film.",1005091200,,293,4.764705882352941
8020756,5,B00022PZ06,"When I first got into DVD, I was pleasantly surprised that it seemed to be an excellent documentary. This is probably the most impressive IMAX I have  ever seen before.  A complete and enthralling.. I have this DVD and I'd  highly recommend it. This is a DVD that anyone can enjoy, it is really  educational, you can actually stay home and watch this DVD with your whole  family.",968803200,9,379,4.514705882352941
8020757,5,B00022PZ06,"I purchased the discoverers for myself and subsequently had it shown for the whole family.  It is VERY high quality production and if you have full  Dolby 5.1 you will be rewarded with rich and wonderful sound  effects.
This DVD has 8 'topics' all professionally mastered.  The whole  family was stimulated by this educational tool.  I wish it was a year long  series that went deeper into each topic.
Only negative - Although it is  listed as 72 minutes, that includes all the behind the scenes pieces.  The  real event lasts only about 40 minutes.
Have fun learning!",968544000,17,568,4.704081632653061
