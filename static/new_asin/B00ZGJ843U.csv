7282006,5,B00ZGJ843U,I love movies that pay tribute to real people in one's life.  This is a great story that took place in the mid-1960's (not '90s as advertised) that was written by one of the real characters that lovingly honors his friend.  It also sheds great light on how little or miserably our educational institutions treat children with ADHD.,1446249600,,331,4.689655172413793
7282007,5,B00ZGJ843U,Movie was made and written in my hometown. True story about Faith and best friends.  I would highly recommend for ANY AGE!,1445126400,3,122,4.545454545454546

7282010,4,B00ZGJ843U,"I really liked the real perspective it gave on a kids life and friendships. I didn't like the ultimatum the principal gave Lyle's parents about changing schools or giving him some drug/medication to help with his ""condition"".",1512864000,,225,5.108108108108108
7282011,5,B00ZGJ843U,"This movie portrayed the beautiful side of boys will be boys, friends to the end, helping each other all the way. Clean, funny, heart wrenching, and real life. No hollywood junk needed, just real adventures in life.  Reminded me of my youth and riding grocery charts down hills near the store.  Not me, I wasn't big or brave enough. The Mom said it perfectly, she loved it when her son came home with grass in his hair, he had a chance to live his life like other boys and not just sit in front of a window all day. Children with too much energy ? Channel it and put it to use. Bravo, well done !",1505433600,7,596,4.129310344827586

7282015,5,B00ZGJ843U,"Bought this for my 89.5 year old Dad.  He loved it and really enjoyed the 2 boys.  This is not one of the ""happily ever after"" stories that I normally try to pick out for him, but he still gave it a thumbs up.",1501286400,,209,3.727272727272727

7282031,5,B00ZGJ843U,"Deeply moving, this unique film sparks important family discussion. Be sure to read the ""thanks to"" at the end of the credits, where the real-life families are honored for their contributions. A question your family might ponder: Why do you think the principal simultaneously sobs and laughs hysterically in the ladies' room?",1473206400,2,325,5.269230769230769
7282032,5,B00ZGJ843U,"This movie is very inspiring and based on a true story. After reading the book, I couldn't wait to see the movie. I wasn't disappointed. It stayed very true to the book. Great movie for the entire family!",1470009600,,204,4.394736842105263

7282034,4,B00ZGJ843U,Was a good movie with a unique friendship between two boys with their own unique life challenges. It brought me back to when I was growing up in school with my own challenges with my disability it would've been great to have a friendship like that.,1468800000,2,248,4.413043478260869
7282035,1,B00ZGJ843U,"After wasting my money on this movie, I am certain that the five star reviews must have all been written by people who live in the town where it was filmed.  The acting is bad, and the storyline is uninteresting.  Really, there is almost no plot to speak of.  Also, the writing, lighting, music, any effects are all so poorly done that the movie seems like it was made for TV, which of course it couldn't have been because it really isn't even good enough for TV.  Did I mention that this movie was a complete waste of time?  Well, it bears repeating since it was just so awful.",1465689600,4,578,4.26605504587156

7282049,5,B00ZGJ843U,"Loved it. Clean, positive, healthy film.

I found the portions regarding the ""attention-deficit-medication"" benficially-alarming. I believe that what the film portrayed regarding the so-called ""medication"" has actually happened to real people in real life, and, likely, continues to happen to this day. I think that idea is worth being exposed to.",1454976000,3,347,5.803921568627451

7282052,5,B00ZGJ843U,We enjoyed watching Different Drummers. The movie was filmed in our town of Spokane Washington. The Donut scene was filmed at the Donut Parade on Hamilton Street in Spokane ( a really good place to eat donuts I must add). We even know the person who served the donut from behind the counter. A she's a good reason to go there. But the movie itself was a tear jerker. It has some of the same story as the movie Letters from God. Nice one to view over and over.,1454198400,,459,4.168539325842697
7282053,5,B00ZGJ843U,Excellent excellent material the kid with ADD or ADHD awesome actor unless he really had it  I most certainly would watch that again,1453852800,,132,4.739130434782608

8720150,4,B00ZGJ843U,"I originally bought this for my grandchildren but decided to watch it first, thankfully. I loved the story line and there were some great values and messages woven throughout the movie.  It provided some laugh-out-loud humorous moments too.  Different Drummers is free from bad language and other objectionable content so prevalent in movies these days.  The story does not have a happy ending however, which some people (particularly sensitive children) may struggle with. Life itself does not always have a happy ending, but there can still be beauty along the way -- things we can glean that make us a better person.  That's how I see this movie.

My two hesitations with this movie are:
1) Because it is so sad, I may not give it to my grandchildren.
2)  As a Christian I had a number of ""theological"" concerns about some things in the movie.",1520899200,,846,4.760273972602739
8720151,1,B00ZGJ843U,"Seriously?I have a kid with ADHD and thought that this might be an uplifting movie for him. Nope! The lesson is ""Don't take meds because they will turn you into a zombie. Instead, you should believe in God and pray."" Yay! That will solve everything! Happy, happy, joy, joy in Christian heaven! I wish I were kidding. The ridiculously tragic ending only underscores how emotionally manipulative this simplistic film is. Some will say, ""No, it isn't a sad ending. The boys are running together in magical heaven!"" Please. This movie might have a little bit of slick marketing and a good cover, but you should definitely skip it, especially if your kid has ADHD and you're looking for a positive message. Blah! I want my two hours back!",1519516800,,733,4.734375
