8072144,5,B000A1IUYM,"This is truly a movie masterpiece.  My brother and I were entranced by this mini-series when we were little and after years of searching I was finally able to find it again.  The first three installments are better than the final two, as they cover the early childhood years and the American Revolution. The whole series is of excellent quality and very historically accurate. The primary historical source for the series is the biography on George Washington by James Thomas Flexner, which is very thorough and the most noted in the field.  I actually wish there were a soundtrack available as the music is very fine as well.  The series appeals to both the young and old, oddly enough, the under ten crowd is as entranced by this historical series as anyone can be.  It is truly magnificent.",1183334400,2,793,4.717391304347826
