6260481,5,B00IE6T1F2,"A strange subject for such an entertaining movie. A documentary about a sane and loving man who has created a Penis Museum. He needs a human specimin to complete his collection. No spring chicken, the pressure is on for him to complete his mission. Sounds loony? The movie both hilarious and touching. A potential donor impressed with his size and stamina is obsessed with having his junk donated to the museum upon his death. He even goes so far as to have it tatooed with the stars and stripes. A great deal of the humor derives from his disappointment at discovering he has competition. The sinserity and humanity of the collector move the viewer in surprising and rewarding ways. Do yourself a favor and rent this one.",1406505600,3,722,4.692913385826771

6260483,5,B00IE6T1F2,"this film is far better then the trailer.  It starts out seeming like it is a mockumentary because the people and the story seem unbelievable and as the film progresses you realize that these people are real and sincere.

Some the scenes in Iceland are beautiful and the film is a fascinating study of unique and interesting people.  This is a well done film.",1402444800,3,359,4.578125
6260484,4,B00IE6T1F2,... but it falls short in the last 15 minutes by opting for a pathetic final member specimen ;-).  Also would have been good to include some interesting scientific details about this most important organ.,1401235200,,204,4.828571428571428

8641477,4,B00IE6T1F2,"This museum is real and is in Iceland. And its amazing how many people want to go see this museum, just to look at the collection of animal penises and when the person dies, a human penis for all to see.",1480723200,,203,3.975609756097561
8641478,5,B00IE6T1F2,"This is an absolutely amazing documentary. One of my favorites, oddly enough. Neither the preview nor the description does justice for this highly entertaining documentary. It is the characters, the cinematic effect and the quirkiness all tied together through a wacky but interesting narrative that will draw you in and keep you emotionally tied throughout the entire film. I cannot wait for this filmmaker's next project. A true story-telling genius. Bravo!",1479340800,,459,5.47887323943662
8641479,5,B00IE6T1F2,"I love this movie. I originally saw it at Austin's Fantastic Fest several years ago, though I understand it is now available on Netflix. Such a great documentary.... about mortality and pride and so many other things. Not a mockumentary about penises, as you would expect. Surprisingly wonderful!! I bought a DVD and have loaned it out to many documentary-loving friends. Very bittersweet. :)",1440460800,,392,5.140625
8641480,5,B00IE6T1F2,The best part about this movie is the number of times you change your mind about whether or not this is real or fake.  And the diorama scene.  The diorama scene wins all.,1417219200,,170,4.121212121212121

8641482,5,B00IE6T1F2,"Some girlfriends and I saw this movie a couple of years ago at a film festival and expected to get some cheap laughs. We got so much more. The people who are the subjects of this film really draw you in, and you almost can't help but take this quest as seriously as the curator does. I imagine this movie had some trouble marketing itself due to the subject matter, but it is a worthwhile experience for anyone who enjoys a solid documentary. I couldn't tell you about many of the other films we saw that week at the festival, but this one has stayed in our minds because it was so unexpectedly great.",1413417600,2,601,4.280701754385965
