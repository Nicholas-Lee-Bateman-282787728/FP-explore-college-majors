6097484,1,B00GOYHS5Q,"Movies like these should be banned it was so lame and boring!!! Not to mention that you could tell the effects were fake. Can't believe I lost 10 minutes of my life watching this!!!! Brave Heart outshines this by far and even the dragon in ""Shrek"" is more believable, just saying.",1393632000,,280,4.509803921568627
6097495,4,B00GOYHS5Q,Definitely what I expected from cheesie B-movie.,1408579200,,48,6.0
6097496,1,B00GOYHS5Q,"Off-putting to use the Lewis Carroll poem in a film about a dragon that grows to full size a few moments after hatching, doesn't even breathe fire, and terrorizes a little medieval village where everyone talks as if they are modern Americans. Terrible acting, bad script, awful cgi. Total joke. False representation of movie image on dvd cover. I guess it's cheaper than a sleeping pill. Snails move quicker than the pace of this dopey, abject bore of a tale. I have to give it a star to post this but it does not deserve even one.",1401494400,5,531,4.484536082474227
6097497,4,B00GOYHS5Q,"This made for tv movie was originally named Jabberwock.
If you like B movies, you'll find this movie entertaining.
I loved the storyline, inexpensive special effects, and the actors.

The picture on the box does not match this movie.",1401148800,2,233,4.9743589743589745
6097498,3,B00GOYHS5Q,this movie was okay i would watch it again.it has some good action and suspence .it keeps you intrested enough,1400803200,,110,4.55
6097499,1,B00GOYHS5Q,Movie should be on the sci-fi channel... pretty bad cgi and story line. Hard to watch. Was hoping for much better.,1400803200,,114,4.476190476190476
6097500,2,B00GOYHS5Q,"Sometimes you get lucky at redbox with a straight to video movie but usually you don't. This one is the rule rather than the exception. Two stars because the music score was actually not bad, and for the guy who played Duncan in the Last of The Mohicans. (What's he doing in this one?) One star for production value, cinematography, and plot line. Most of the actors (but not all) did pretty well with what they were given, but not enough to overcome the obviously skeleton budget with which the movie was made.",1399593600,,511,4.505376344086022
6097501,5,B00GOYHS5Q,"Amazing movie! On par with Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, and other fantasy epics. The CGI is incredibly realistic, and the cast of unknown actors will all soon be red carpet regulars. I loved the reference to Lewis Carroll's poem ""Jabberwocky."" Definitely check it out :)",1398211200,3,277,4.791666666666667
6097502,2,B00GOYHS5Q,"It was hilarious to find such a bad movie, it really has been quite the while.
The cover matches the movie -100% .
There wasn't even really a dragon, they called it the jabberwocky through tout the entire movie.
The fight scenes were the worst I've ever seen in my life.
This movie could've been a trillion times better.",1396656000,,320,4.440677966101695
6097503,2,B00GOYHS5Q,"Even for the kind of movie it is, this is pretty weak on plot and acting and substance in general.  Wasted my money.",1395705600,,116,4.043478260869565
6097504,1,B00GOYHS5Q,"i cant believe my boyfriend is making me watch this. bad graphics, bad acting, bad plot. i cant believe this was in redbox. don't waste your time!  seriously!",1393632000,8,158,4.642857142857143
8625795,1,B00GOYHS5Q,"This was supposed to be a new DVD but the case had a bad dent in it, this could be why it wouldn't play all the way through,",1527811200,,124,3.4642857142857144

8625797,4,B00GOYHS5Q,A pretty decent dragon movie. Actors fairly good and good story. Script a bit boring at times.,1499990400,,94,4.588235294117647

8625800,3,B00GOYHS5Q,"I watched this a bit ago, I personally thought the use of the Jabberwocky and the Lewis Carroll poem were by far the most interesting and redeeming aspects of the film. I though the acting was adequate, the casting was...adequate, the costuming was...adequate...basically it was an OK film, with bad imaging and a clever use of a 17th? century poem.",1442188800,,349,4.833333333333333

8625804,1,B00GOYHS5Q,This one of the worst movies I've suffered through in a long time. Laughable acting and CGI with a horrible script. Straight to DVD for sure! The only redeeming feature in the film is the beautiful Kacey Barnfield who made the movie somewhat sufferable. REAL DUD HERE!,1411084800,,268,4.723404255319149
