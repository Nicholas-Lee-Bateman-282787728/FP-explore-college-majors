8309370,4,B001HQ6ZJQ,"This two-season series just got to me, somehow.  Perhaps a little corny, but with strong values and a good story.  Great ensemble cast which really hung together and made it work.",1349049600,3,179,4.741935483870968
8309371,5,B001HQ6ZJQ,"I wish they had more than just two seasons!! Awesome DVD, came in perfect packaging. This show beat out almost every other cop show from that time. Great mix of straight edge cop and marital arts bad ass.",1338768000,2,204,4.394736842105263
8309372,5,B001HQ6ZJQ,I used to watch this show as a kid by staying up late and hiding the TV under the covers to watch.  Now that it is on DVD I don't have to hide under the covers.  I can just enjoy the good guys getting a win.  The action of martial arts and shoot outs is fun to watch.,1238716800,3,267,3.5689655172413794
