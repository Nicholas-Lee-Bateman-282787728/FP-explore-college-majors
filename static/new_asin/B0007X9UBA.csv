8053271,5,B0007X9UBA,Easier to buy these then collect off cable. Getting them in order helps the series make more sense. Looking forward to getting the rest,1355788800,,135,4.666666666666667

This series is really fun. There are lots of cool characters, action, drama, comedy, and a pretty engrossing plot. I'd say that this series borders on addicting. When it was on TV at 5:30 in the morning all those years ago, I actually woke up, watched it, and went back to sleep before going to high school at 8am. It takes a hell of a good show to get me up that early in the morning. The only complaint I have is the price. I started collecting Zoids when it was first coming out. It seems like the DVD's were around $10 or $15 new back then. I've seen the prices of them now, and I think it's ridiculous. They are out of print, and there are more and more people that will hold on to them once they get them. If you find a decent deal on them, I'd jump on it. It looks like the whole series will run about $700. I would like to see them released again since they are rare. Anyway, this series is a lot of fun, and I highly recommend it to anime fans of all ages.",1354924800,,1181,4.004237288135593

8053274,3,B0007X9UBA,"First off this is a review of Zoids Choatic Century series as a whole. Second I would have given this a 3.5 if I could.

ZCC is by far the best zoids series in the franchise. That still isn't saying much, this is just your average big robo anime. The voice acting is okay, the graphics again okay, the plot is slightly above average. This is a long series that has a lot twists but its just not the amazing legendary anime everyones making it out to be. Make no mistake this is nowhere near the league of say gundam or EVA. This is your anime you pop in if you have kids or just want something to do du to. Normally I would say save your money but the series cost 12.99 each brand new so try it out if you like then go on if you don't then you only wasted 12 dollors not a terrible waste.",1167523200,,788,3.9559748427672954
8053275,5,B0007X9UBA,"this picks up where irvine has just used his lighning saix for the first time. anyway it follows the same rutine as the others previews and all. for zoids fans as always, and for newbies aswell.",1120953600,,194,4.416666666666667
