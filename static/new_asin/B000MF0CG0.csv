8608860,5,B000MF0CG0,"Many years ago as a late teen I stayed up late and caught this movie on pay Tv. Since I was 100 miles away and this was over air scrambled I could really just get the basics.  Fast forward years later when family owned Video stores in my area started closing
  I came across it. What a treat to finally see my first mildly adult film from years ago finally clear and with sound. Is the movie great probably not maybe truly closer to 4 stars but I am giving it an extra star for finally finding it and the fact fan favorite Candy Samples is in it (listed as Mary Gavin). Done more as a comedy then a drama filled with lots of pretty ladies.",1404604800,,639,4.055555555555555
