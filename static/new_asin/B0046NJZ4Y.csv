I bought this dvd with high expectations, but was a bit let down by the recording of the Blu-ray as i compared the sound quality of this to other DVD's i have purchased.  However, I defense of the recording, the contents are beautiful, but too short at just over an hour.  When I first loaded this to my Blu-ray player, I had to turn the volume up by almost 10 to get the same sound volume and quality.  The sound quality could have been clearer - maybe i'm used to hearing recordings done in large concert halls (this was recorded in a small club of maybe less than 50 people).  Once I turned the volume up, I was then able to get some of the affect I was looking for.  i especially liked ""Over easy"" - it's just a snappy, catchy tune that stays with me.  The four piece ensemble was certainly unique with the added percussionist - the more I listened to him, the more credit I give him (he was very good), the Bassist ""Scot"" was the backbone of this group (very good indeed), as Pintchik is outfront, but in a soft and mellow way (not prominent).  The drummer is also good, they really are all very good in their individual ways.  The Concert is just too short for my taste, however, myself humming the tune for days after.  There is also a CD version that comes with the DVD that makes for great commuting music.  Overall, I give it 7 out of 10.",1386720000,,1368,4.223076923076923
