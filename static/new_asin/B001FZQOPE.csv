8303197,3,B001FZQOPE,"This video takes you from location to location in England while tracing the life of the heroic Horatio, Lord Nelson. These locations figured prominently in Nelson's life, from his Norfolk boyhood home and school, to the deck of HMS Victory herself, now in permanent drydock at Portsmouth. Part of Nelson's early career was as a captain in the British West Indies, which is where he met his wife Fanny. While this is mentioned, apparently the budget didn't allow for actual travel to Nevis or Antigua. Another interesting location in Nelson's life is Naples, Italy, but again, no travel there either. I found the video very interesting, intelligently constructed and factual. Sadly, the only home that his lordship ever owned, Merton Place, is now the site of a parking lot. So much for saving historically important structures. Oh well, can't save all of them. I would recommend this video to all those interested in Nelson and for the nominal cost, it's worthwhile purchasing.",1399248000,,977,5.037037037037037
8303198,5,B001FZQOPE,"Very interesting and informative.
In the times we are living in, we need some heroes.
High quality film making.  Superlative.",1374278400,,125,5.25
8303199,5,B001FZQOPE,"If you want a good but not indepth look at one of Englands Great Fighting Admirals. Then you should consider looking at this film. As Nelson rightfully should be considered a great case study in Effective Leadership. I was hoping that this film would go more into detail about the Nelson ""touch"" but I was disappointed as this film did an almost there. Hopefully, something better will come down the road for his Lordship.",1277942400,4,422,4.716216216216216
8303200,4,B001FZQOPE,This series is scattered with golden nuggets of information - whether it's the number of oaks it would have taken to build an 18th century Royal Navy warship or a childhood experience which gives us insight into what made Nelson the man.  What I particularly like is that it's not just about Victory and Trafalgar.  We get a rare look at some of the lesser well-known places associated with the admiral - the Norfolk church where his father was minister; Chatham Docks where he first set sail as a boy; the site of Merton Place where he lived with Emma Hamilton.,1245801600,7,562,4.554455445544554
