8714367,5,B00WUKI0BE,"The singers here are really in their primes.  Eva Marton sings with great power and emotion, her laser like soprano having no trouble with the demands of this role.  Carreras also sings magnificently.  And Ricciarelli as Liu, sings with wonderful pianissimos.  The staging is very colorful, dazzling costumes.  Another reviewer did not like the video transfer, I found it fine.  It's 4:3 aspect ratio, and of course it's in standard definition, even the blu-ray, because it was shot on video, and that can't be changed to high def.  But I found it very watchable, close ups are fairly clear, long shots are soft, but really not bad at all.  And of course the singing is the main thing, and that is wonderful.  But the most impressive part of all is the conducting of Loren Maazel.  He takes various parts at a surprisingly slow tempo (even the first few notes of the opera), much slower than I'm used to, and it works!  The climaxes are stupendous, earth-shattering.  I'm really glad they reissued this at such a bargain price.",1462665600,,1027,4.740112994350283

8714369,3,B00WUKI0BE,"The performances are as superb as when they were originally captured. Unfortunately, the video transfer is deplorable; thus, I surmise, the low price of these ""blu ray"" editions. Some of the wide angle scenes are unwatchable. Sorry, this will disappoint most of you.",1438819200,6,266,5.209302325581396
