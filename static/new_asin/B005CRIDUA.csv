4653952,5,B005CRIDUA,"I saw an advance copy of this movie and it is one of the best horror flicks I have seen.  Truly creepy, mysterious, and suspenseful while staying true to the original stories.  Poe would have loved this take on his classics",1330992000,4,223,4.414634146341464
8465828,1,B005CRIDUA,aweful none of the stories other than their titles were written by poe. don't do like i did and buy this.,1410393600,,105,4.0476190476190474
8465829,1,B005CRIDUA,"The negative reviews here pretty much sum it up accurately. I recently watched this at a friends house, and was extremely disappointed. The Black Cat was my favorite part, and the other stories didn't really do any justice to Poe's genius. In fact, I thought they were a slap in the face. The Fall of the house of Usher was OK, but the Tell Tale Heart, & Murders in the Rue Morgue were just not well done at all. The Pit and the Pendulum was almost interesting, but still didn't impress me. I can't call this collection amateurish, simply because that would degrade amateurs everywhere. This was extremely disappointing to say the least. The only saving grace for this dvd is the fact that once it was finished, It gave me a serious desire to read the original stories again to cleanse my mind, which was fine with me!",1383609600,,818,4.496644295302014
8465830,1,B005CRIDUA,"This is mediocre at best. The Black Cat, is the only short that is worth mentioning, and though The Fall of the House of Usher was sub-par, these two are the only real highlights in my opinion. The other 3 shorts took the premise of the original stories, and ran. Sadly, they ran straight off a cliff. Being a fan of EAP for many years, I bought this with high hopes. Maybe that was the problem. I did force myself to finish watching, hoping that something would pop and overshadow the mediocrity, but it never happened. My first thought was that these stories were written by a high school English class, and acted by the Drama department, but, I continued to watch, hoping it would get better. The Tell Tale Heart was just horrible, and The Murders in the Rue Morgue, laughable. The Pit and The Pendulum had that dark feel to it, but again, fell short. I guess the upside is that I found a used copy for $0.01, so with shipping, I basically rented this for $4. I say this is the upside, because a local pawn shop gave me $3 for it, so basically, it was equivalent to a red box rental. My opinion may be a bit harsh, but when you see the work of someone like Poe treated in such a well, pathetic fashion, it tends to deserve an honest review. It almost makes one wonder if the good reviews posted are by true fans of this collection, or those involved in it, hoping to sell more copies.",1383264000,,1387,4.277566539923955
8465831,1,B005CRIDUA,"I am an English teacher and a Poe lover. I was hoping that something on here would be decent enough to show my kids. No such luck, the TT Heart had to be the worst; followed by The Fall of the House of Usher. I felt like I was watching home movies. The Pit, well hmm what to say. It had an apocalyptic feel to it; they tried to give a bit of what the character might have felt in the pit. It was over the top though. I have not viewed The Murders at RM yet; I was so disgusted at the 1st three to move on. The Black Cat has potential though.",1380672000,3,541,3.754385964912281
8465832,4,B005CRIDUA,"I have two songs in the ""Tell Tale Heart"" segment, so I'm biased.  It's a cool movie to break out at parties.",1358208000,,109,3.9545454545454546
8465833,3,B005CRIDUA,"This anthology offers two strong tales and three mediocre ones. Tom Savini's students did these projects.
Any horror or literature enthusiast should view the entries for ""The Black Cat"" and ""The Pit and the Pendulum."" ""The Black Cat"" chapter reaches similar quality to Stuart Gordon's ""The Black Cat"" from Master of Horror. Requiem for the Damned's adaptation is that good. And like Gordon's excellent work, the adaptation not only remains close and respectful to Poe's tale, but it also adds original artistry--in this case puppetry. ""The Pit and the Pendulum"" inspires this disk's so-named chapter; however, the chapter is far from a straight interpretation. Rather, Requiem's ""Pit"" captures the original's spirit very well, and I am glad for experiencing this thoughtful short film.
Other than the strong entries, EAP's Requiem for the Damned offers tales titled ""The Fall of the House of Usher,"" ""The Tell-Tale Heart,"" and ""Murders in the Rue Morgue."" They are inspired by these three classics. They do not re-tell these short stories. In my opinion, they do not do justice to these Poe tales. The respective filmmakers just borrow a premise from Poe; then, they do their own thing with it. And, each result is mediocre. But hey, Poe is so noted and influential that one supposes he needs re-invention for new audiences.
So, anyone reading this review should consider purchasing this DVD. The person should at least see ""The Black Cat"" adaptation sometime; s/he will like it.",1335139200,5,1479,5.115702479338843
8465834,5,B005CRIDUA,"This is a great little independent film.  Shown at Sundance.  The stories are each directed by a different director and crew.  You can easily see the individual vision each segment has.  My personal favorite was The Pit and the Pendulem  Apocaliptic and truly set a mood.  Remmington Brimmer was the makeup man on this one. Great job!  He also played a part.  You've got to love The Black Cat.  Campy, impressionistic sets and effects.  The cat was a personality!  Remmington Brimmer was a puppeteer in this segment.  What a talented group.  Looking forward to seeing more from them.",1331942400,3,583,4.826530612244898
8465835,5,B005CRIDUA,"You could tell that this movie was made by passionate young filmmakers. 5 very different and enjoyable films. the best was The Pit and the Pendulum and The Black Cat, the Pit and the Pendulum has a new twist, set in a Terrifying post apocalyptic world with a artistic and dark feel. The Black Cat has a sort of Tim Berton feel to the cat, and the film has almost a cartoon feel. some of the Special effects make-up was skillfully done by Remington Brimmer now with Maker studio in LA. I enjoyed this Movie and recommend it for the fun time it provides.",1331424000,,552,4.3173076923076925
8465836,5,B005CRIDUA,"This film has a very watchable quality, Even if you don't like all 5 works it will still never bores you. I enjoyed the ""The Black Cat"" and ""The Pit and the Pendulum"" the most. I saw that Remington Brimmer had done the special effects make-up and some acting in this film and I love him.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Edgar-Allan-Poe-s-Requiem-for-the-Damned/dp/B005CRIDUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Edgar Allan Poe's Requiem for the Damned</a>&nbsp;He is an up and coming effects artiest, I've seen and enjoyed his work on Youtube.
