There are several problems with the film.  First, the makers have very little footage of free-swimming tiger sharks.  Viewers are shown the same small segments of wild tiger sharks numerous times.  Second, a huge portion of the film (almost 50%) is devoted to following the activities of a professional shark catcher who catches and delivers live sharks to aquariums.  The shark catcher is interesting and it is neat to see how he collects and cares for his sharks.  However, tiger sharks are rarely mentioned during this large segment (most of it deals with sandbar sharks) and most of the segment documents him trying to send a shipment of sharks to France.  Again it is somewhat interesting, but it really drags on.

Overall, the film starts with a short interview with a tiger shark attack victim in Hawaii.  It then describes a spell of Hawaiian shark attacks from the early 1990s and the local governments reaction to them.  Next it follows the activities of a Hawaiian shark researcher.  Finally it gets into the never-ending story of the shark catcher.

Tales of the Tiger Shark is not so much a bad movie as it is a dull movie.  With a name like Operation Shark Attack one pictures lots of action.  Little happens during the film and what does happen tends to drag.  People who must see every shark film should see it, though I'm sure they won't watch it twice.  Others should look for better titles.  Air Jaws is great (despite the silly sounding name); it has lots of action and the science is well described.",1126656000,,1675,4.6552901023890785
