8339515,5,B001S86JI0,"I bought this series for a gift for my sister who has always wanted to go to Italy. I'm sure she will love it and she can now visit Italy any time she wants. Rick Steves is the best guide, he is humorous, gives us just enough information about the area he is visiting and has a genuine flair about him that makes you very comfortable.  I would highly recommend any of Rick Steves travel videos.",1304553600,,394,4.184210526315789
