8496370,1,B006C6LLEU,Really not that much info and kinda jumped all over the place. Don't buy you be better off getting a book with a little more detail,1487894400,,131,4.076923076923077
8496371,1,B006C6LLEU,Don't waste your money. Any good trout fisherman knows all the content. It's a joke. I was fooled because it was made by In Fisherman,1450051200,,133,4.36
8496372,3,B006C6LLEU,"This video focuses on a variety of scenarios for stocked trout fishing.  Trolling plugs in early spring, fishing for tailwater trout, fishing the White River, and some winter steelhead ""finesse"" fishing.  The trolling information is great if you are fishing from a boat and the White River techniques can be adapted to other rivers, but the average bank fisherman won't benefit as much from these techniques.  There isn't much information applicable to fishing western streams for stocked trout, either.  Overall, I would say this video was more of a collection of somewhat random fishing situations encountered by the producers rather than a systematic explanation of trout behavior and the principles of catching stocked trout.  Also, the video only about an hour.  But if you fish from a boat or are planning a trip to the White River or tailwater fisheries, the techniques in this video will be helpful.",1379462400,2,907,5.094594594594595
