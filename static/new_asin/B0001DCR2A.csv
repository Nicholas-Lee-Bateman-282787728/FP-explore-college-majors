8010316,4,B0001DCR2A,"Done as the second Slayers OVA, Slayers Excellent is a 3-episode series takes Lina Inverse back to her earliest chapter to when she first meets up with Naga the Serpent(her eternal rival). So, this takes place in the same set of stories as the Slayers Special titles like the first four Slayers movies, intended as a prequel taking place before all the other Slayers material, or a ""prequel of prequels"" as it were.

 Lina originally encounters Naga who torches an entire inn just to declare her superiority over Lina. Naga continues to stalk Lina, which leads the two thought of being in cahoots by some villagers after Naga destroys a pub Lina was eating in. The unlikely dup of sorceresses are sentenced by the village to look for some missing citizens in an abandoned ruins, which turns out to be ruled by a vampire lord that Lina and Naga were intended to be sacrifices for. Of course the Dracula-wannabe is defeated by Lina, but not without Naga causing the entire roof to fall in on them. The next chapter has Lina being a bodyguard for a spoiled rich girl on a trip to her summer home, but sells her out to bandits after having enough of her ego. Naga interferes, and causes the debutante brat and her kidnappers to start a new fashion trend. This leads into the last episode where Lina is hired by a fashion designer that is at war with ""trendy"" designer that has adopted Naga's flashy philosophy, which escalates into the two sides having a giant robot battle with mechanized golems!

 The OVA series is collected into a single DVD through ADV Films, although no re-release has been issued since the company restructured into separate branches. The dub is pretty fair, although it is different from the one performed in the TV series and features a totally different cast. The quality of animation is just as good as the other theatrical releases and OVAs, although it looks like they didn't give as much effort to that what was done in prior productions.",1463011200,,1965,4.670520231213873
8010317,4,B0001DCR2A,"I like getting to see more of Naga and Lina interact together, but overall these OVAs were a little weaker than the series itself. As someone else mentioned in a review of the OVAs before, it gets tiring seeing the same sort of ending over and over. However, the animation itself is gorgeous, and way better than the series. Still kind of amusing, at least.

I would recommend this to any diehard Slayers fan that wanted more Lina and Naga.",1368230400,,440,4.5
8010318,3,B0001DCR2A,"I this OVA Lina meets her rival Naga. Lina torches a cavern full of thieves. Unfortunately they were keeping a dragon as a pet. The dragon goes nuts and comes to destroy the town. Lina and Naga also have a fashion show.

As far as the Slayers OVA's are concerned this one is one of the better ones. The animation and voice acting are pretty bad though. The voice of Lina is not the same as in the TV series. If you're a Slayers fan this one may disappoint you. It's definitely not high quality at all, but it's better than most of the OVA's out there.",1351036800,,551,4.149532710280374
8010319,4,B0001DCR2A,"This slayers is pretty funny at some points.  First episode is all about the two sorceresses meeting each other and getting tricked into going into some ruins.  Second is about Lina being the bodyguard of a crazy rich girl(who drives Lina crazy).  Last is two seamstresses fighting each other over the clothing the people of the town should wear.  Personally I love gaury and he's not in this OVA, but the craziness between the two girls is very funny.",1273881600,,452,4.6835443037974684
8010320,2,B0001DCR2A,"The problem with Slayers, and Excellent proves the point magnificently, is that the series creators have run out of ideas for the adventures. In the first episode, when Lina and Naga first meet, the episode starts off very funny, but then degenerates into a standard Slayers adventure that we've seen a thousand times before. The second episode, in which Lina agrees to watch over an annoying, arrogant princess but complications ensue when she hires a fake band of troublemakers to teach the princess a lesson. The complications coming in the form of Naga defeating the fake cons and real cons abducting the princess. The problem is this episode is too close to Jeffery's Knighthood from the Book of Spells and isn't nearly as funny. Finally, we have an episode in which Lina and Naga come to a town with waring fashionistas and while the conservative fashionista picks Linna as her model, the liberal fashionista picks Naga. If this sounds like the plot from ""Slayers: Great"" it is almost an exact carbon copy with a touch of Slayers: Gorgeous thrown in, but it never comes close to the level of hilarity it thinks it has obtained.

Overall, watching Excellent, you get the definite feeling that the series has run its course. The jokes, animation, and voice acting are all pretty much the same as previous installments, but it's gotten to the point where nothing in Slayers is really all that different from what we've seen before.",1154736000,,1434,4.853061224489796
8010321,5,B0001DCR2A,"After three feature-length movies, we get back to short, half-hour O.A.V. episodes.
Finally, at long last, we get to see how Lina Inverse and Nahga The White Serpant first met. (In SLAYERS: THE MOTION PICTURE, where Nahga made her first appearence, Lina and Nahga already knew each other from sometime back, and we were never told how they first came to meet.) We begin in the present, when Nahga destroys the inn Lina's staying at, and destroys the meal she was about to eat as well. This triggers a flashback to when Lina first met Nahga, who was determined to get a reputation as the world most powerful sorceress by defeating Lina. Later the two of them are hired by some village people to kill a vampire. (Yes, this is the only time in all of the Slayers anime where a vampire makes an appearence.)
Next, Lina is hired by a rich man to escort his teenage daughter Serena (spoken for by veteran actor Tiffany Grant) to their vacation villa. The problem is that Serena has a personality and laugh quite simular to Nahga, she splurges like crazy (she even refuses to wear the same set of clothing more than once and buys lots of suveners which she then expects Lina to carry,) and she slows them down greatly. Finally Lina gets sick of it so she actually hires some guys to kidnap Serena. But then Serena gets kidnapped by some different bandits, so Lina must save her with the help of Nahga.
Finally we get to see Lina's last adventure with Nahga ever. Lina comes to town and finds Nahga has a new cult of teenage girl followers (led by preppy valley girl-type Marti) who think her taste in clothing is really cool, and Lina is horrified by the idea of a future world where everyone dresses and acts like Nahga, so she joins up with a seemstress sorceress and her followers who want everyone to stick to formal attire to stop Nahga and Marti and the others.
The shows are funny, the animation is...well, excellent, and the voice actors are superb-particularly Kelly Manison, (who was born to play Nahga,) Cynthia Martinez, who had really grown into the role of Lina Inverse by the time she returned to play her in SLAYERS RETURN, and Tiffany Grant as Serena. Finally, there are the interviews mentioned in the other reviews with Miss Martinez and Miss Manison. They are almost as much fun to watch as the episodes themselves, since it's neat to see what the voice actors look like and see them speak as themselves and hear what they think of the shows and the characters. A great DVD to own.",1087776000,,2494,4.544444444444444
8010322,2,B0001DCR2A,"There are 3 episodes on this DVD.  Only the first episode is passable.  The other two were just terrible.  The deterioration of the quality of these episodes reminds me of similar degradation of quality of the Ranma episodes as the seasons marched on.  It seems that the people involved were not even trying anymore.  The earlier Slayers movies while not the greatest animes made had at least some funny moments and the animation was at least done well.  The episodes on this disk is neither funny nor well animated.  The animation quaility is on par with TV episodes quality.
The first episode showed the first and a subsequent meeting of Naga and Lina.  Of the three episodes this is the strongest.  Naga is slightly out of character as she was clumsy and accident prone.
The second episode showed Lina being employed as a bodyguard for a girl who had similar personality as Naga.  The gag in this episode was that she was into SM.  No, I don't mean Sailor Moon.
The third episode showed dueling seamtresses.  Yes, you have the usual wackiness and absurdity you come to expect from Slayers.  Unfortunately, it was not funny.
One saving grace for this DVD is the extras.  There were two interviews showing the NA VAs for Lina and Naga.  We finally get to see what Cynthia Martinez and Kelly Manison look like.
Unless you are a diehard fan of Slayers, I suggest that you skip this disk.",1081814400,,1386,4.622950819672131
8010323,5,B0001DCR2A,"The name says it all on this one.  This is probably the best non-TV-series Slayers release to come out so far.  It's at least on par with the best of them: ""Slayers the Motion Picture"", ""Book of Spells"", and ""Slayers Great"" and a great introduction to those who haven't yet experienced the insanity and fun of this incredible anime series.  This DVD compiles three separate episodes of Lina and Naga adventures, including the first meeting of the two in the first story, ""Labyrinth"".  This is the strongest of the three and is worth the price of the whole DVD by itself.  This one pits Lina and Naga first against each other, and then against a vampire.  Lina's rant about the pretentious-sounding speech of vampires is an absolute riot.  Second, we have ""A Frightening Future"" in which Lina is hired as a bodyguard for a spoiled (and well-endowed) rich girl whose laugh is just a little bit too much like Naga's for Lina to stand.  Naga shows up (of course) to drive Lina even further to the brink of insanity and some brilliant S&M humor ensues.  Lastly, there is the weakest and most over-the-top of the three stories, ""Lina-Chan's Lovely Makeover Operation"" which pits Lina and an extremely over-zealous formal wear fanatic against Naga and a snotty punk girl who designs unorthodox clothing.  This one had a lot of potential, but fails to live up to it.  Still, this is one Slayers DVD you must have.  The only thing missing is a Dragon-Slave.  Some may argue that a Slayers episode without a Dragon-Slave is like a day without sunshine, but I think we've all seen our fair share by now, haven't we?  Anyhow, we also get a couple of tasty extras in this edition in the form of two interviews: one with the adorable Cynthia Martinez (who gives her best performance ever as Lina Inverse on this DVD), and another with Kelly Manison, Naga's english voice.  All in all, a great collection for both the Slayers newcomer and the veteran otaku.",1081728000,,1942,4.670588235294118
