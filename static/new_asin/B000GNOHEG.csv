8133434,1,B000GNOHEG,"I thought this DVD was a waste of time. The filming is very poorly done. It looks like it is the work of an amateur. There are a lot of instances where you are watching the floor (i.e. the hardwood floor of the Hostel Gat Xino) or a drink bottle (Maxalot). The background music is annoying, not to mention the countless menus that you need to navigate through.

I was very excited to watch this DVD since I will be spending some time in Barcelona soon. I have heard quite a lot about the beauty of the city. Unfortunately, this DVD only showed some back streets, supposedly 'hip' stores and very little of the landmarks. It succeeded in bringing down my enthusiasm.

I will need to find another DVD that will do justice to the city.",1296864000,,732,4.375
8133435,2,B000GNOHEG,"I got this hoping it would have the big picture of the layout of the city and the must see information as well as the off the beaten track info.  The video is lots of 3 minute snapshots of cool ""unusual"" things to do in Barcelona.  As the other reviewer points out, the lack of ""play all"" is a drag. You have to navigate through the menus way too much.

If you already know about Barcelona and want insights about where to go outside of the typical tourist areas then grab this video.  If you want an overview of the city and its highlights look elsewhere.",1264204800,,556,4.216981132075472
8133436,3,B000GNOHEG,"This is for us the first DVD we bought from the ""In the City"" series.
Yes it's loaded with information, but requires a lot of selecting.
There are 3 main categories on the DVD which you have to enter one at a time.
Once entered there are once again a bunch of categories to be entered on at a time.
Once you do that you can select ""play all"" categories of that specific topic.
Still it would be nicer if you could select ""play all"" (play entire DVD) right at the beginning.
Great informative DVD but, due to the large amount of selections you have to make, this will be the only DVD from this series we will have.
Next time we'll buy a DVD where we can sit back and watch while sipping our coffee (or play when we have guests).
A real shame, as it could have been so much better with a ""play all"" for the entire DVD option.",1208044800,3,823,4.08641975308642
