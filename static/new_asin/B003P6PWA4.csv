I haven't yet been able to watch the extras from the DVD.
Overall the movie was cute and had some funny moments.  I thought the funniest moment was when the two guys make a bet/game that they can meet women of ethnic backgrounds and the one guy does actually meets a woman who is Samoan or American Indian.  The acting was good and the plot moved along at a good pace. I agree with the other poster that the humor is in the same vein as American Pie or any movie aimed more at men versus women.  I think most women would find the male characters real jerks.  I must say I am glad I'm older and not in the dating scene any longer.",1283385600,,766,4.046357615894039
8562341,4,B003P6PWA4,"I had the fortune of being an extra for this movie (you can see me in a couple shots sitting at a table outside) and after waiting quite a while for the title to be release on DVD, am very happy to see how it came out. I hate it when a title like this with so many great players gets shelved for so long after making the festival rounds.

The eclectic mix of actors did a great job with the script which was very well-written and stands as one of the so many underrated indie scripts out there. It very much has a American Pie meets Sex Drive appeal to it. There are many moments I'm glad I wasn't eating popcorn in the theatre because it would have been spit directly into the hair of whomever was sitting in front of me.

I greatly enjoyed the special features, especially the outtakes, however I was greatly disappointed that the pieces from the unused story arc were not included. Many great actors were involved in those scenes including Erin Marie Hogan (Paranormal Entity), Joe Hammerstone (The Year After Infection), and Jason Gulati (The Figure of Authority). I realize the filmmakers wanted to keep that arc completely separate from the new path they took to make the turn from ""Cantina Bar Tales"" to ""Say Goodnight"" but that's what DVD special features are for!

Overall, it is a swift, comedic movie with lots of debauchery and wild antics that would be great to watch during a party on Saturday night.",1281744000,,1414,4.494163424124514
