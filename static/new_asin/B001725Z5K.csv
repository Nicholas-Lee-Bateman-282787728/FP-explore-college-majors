A young girl returns to school after her mother has died in an apparent suicide only to find her boyfriend who didn't show up much during her grieving has moved on to another girlfriend.  Her former friend, who is enjoying rubbing it in on her.  The story is played out as she is answering questions to a police detective (Melanie Brown).  The detective is investigating the death of a young college boy who while the girl insists she has never met, the evidence keeps mounting against her.  She tells of meeting a young American girl Eve who has led her into all this.  Nobody else has ever seen Eve.  Is there an Eve?  Is she mentally ill and actually killing people without realizing it?  Good mystery that moves right along as things start coming together.  Not a great flick, but an intriguing and interesting watch.",1420329600,,962,4.502890173410405
