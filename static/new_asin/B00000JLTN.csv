7912718,4,B00000JLTN,"Antoine and Colette is the second film in the French director Truffaut's series of five films about the character Antoine over about 20 years starting as a teen.  The first film in the series, 400 Blows, was a cinematic milestone, and I found the whole series to be interesting.  It's not worthwhile to see the minor film Antoine and Colette except as part of the series.  Les Mistons is an early, short student film-like movie with Bernadette Lafont.",1522108800,,451,4.756410256410256

7912720,5,B00000JLTN,"A boy bends down to smell the bicycle seat of a beautiful girl. A young woman laughs and giggles her way through a game of tennis with her lover. An elderly man sprays water at a young rascal. Forgettable yet utterly unforgettable moments are captured on film in Truffaut's enchanting short film LES MISTONS.

LES MISTONS is a beautifully conceived story that seizes the attention from start to finish. Truffaut brings together the artistic endeavour and human spontaneity that characterized the best of the French Nouvelle Vague in the '50s and '60s. It is a real pleasure to watch a simple tale told so engagingly, so cinematically, a tale in which the the smallness of everyday life intersects with the vastness of human existence and emotion.",1092614400,3,746,4.920634920634921
7912721,1,B00000JLTN,"I am reviewing the dvd itself, not the 2 short films by Truffaut, which are great.  You cannot watch the entire film of Antoine & Colette, because the picture freezes at 23 mins. into a 30 min. film.  This is a manufacturing defect of which I informed Fox-Lorber well over a year ago.  I must have purchased over ten copies from different sources at that time.  All were the same on every dvd player I tried.  Apparently Fox-Lorber doesn't care, because they keep re-issuing the dvd without fixing the problem.  They have the same problem with their dvd release of Mrs. Dalloway.  BE WARNED!!!",1019347200,21,593,4.644230769230769
7912722,4,B00000JLTN,"Francois Truffaut's first three features are, for me, the most precious things in the universe, and if I am only allowed to take one thing to heaven it will be one of these.  The rest of Truffaut's oeuvre, for some bizarre reason, is rather forgettable, ranging from the slight but entertaining ('Stolen Kisses') through the dense and stodgy ('The Green Room') to the plain embarrassing ('Such a Gorgeous Kid like me').
These two shorts go some way to providing an answer for this fall.  'Les Mistons' is a short made two years before Truffaut's first feature, when he was still best known as a polemical critic.  It is a very sad tale about young lovers spied on by a group of brats, and has the casual tragic force of Renoir's 'A Day in the country' or Demy's later 'The Umbrellas of Cherbourg'; and yet is most memorable for its sheer schoolboy-like joy in location shooting, trickery and allusion, affirming cinema's power over life's transience.
'Antoine and Colette', the second film in the Antoine 'The 400 Blows' Doinel series, was originally an episode in a portmanteau film 'Love at Twenty' (also featuring Marcel Ophuls and Andrej Wajda).  It is a slick piece of entertainment about the romantic difficulties of a now very together young man.  All the trauma and life of the first film is neatly ironed out.",993686400,4,1318,4.788546255506608
7912723,4,B00000JLTN,"Two years before LES 400 COUPS, french director Franois Truffaut shot LES MISTONS (1957), a short movie dealing with children and a young couple. G&eacute;rard Blain and Bernadette Lafont impersonate the lovers followed by the  bunch of "" mistons "". Both actors will become, with Jean-Claude  Brialy who appears briefly as a character of the movie chosen by G&eacute;rard and  Bernadette, THE actors of the french "" Nouvelle Vague ""  (1958-1965).
It's quite strange to find in LES MISTONS a lot of themes  Truffaut will treat in his next movies, for instance the tragic love affair  (DEUX ANGLAISES ET LE CONTINENT, L'HISTOIRE D'ADELE H, etc...), the  children (LES 400 COUPS, L'ARGENT DE POCHE).
ANTOINE ET COLETTE has been  shot in 1962 for L'AMOUR A 20 ANS, a movie composed of four different films  about the same theme. It's a movie absolutely necessary for those of you  interested in the saga of Antoine Doinel, the cinematographic double of  Franois Truffaut and young hero of THE 400 COUPS.
Since a dozen movies  of Franois Truffaut are now available in the DVD standard zone 1, this DVD  could be a valuable addition to your library.
Good image and sound  transfer.
A DVD for the curious ones.",956275200,9,1203,4.862068965517241
