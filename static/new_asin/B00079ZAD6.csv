Is Audie Murphy a spy or an idealist ? Michael Redgrave doesn't hesitate much when the American starts to court his Vietnamese mistress. This excellent adaptation will leave you a bitter aftertaste in the mouth thanks to Michael Redgrave's superior performance as the cur Thomas Fowler. highly recommended.",1200182400,4,649,7.666666666666667
2206697,5,B00079ZAD6,I purchased this as a gift for my father-in-law for Father's Day and he loved it and is sharing it with others.  There is no age bracket for a movie of this caliber.,1152489600,5,165,4.0
2206698,3,B00079ZAD6,"The first two-thirds of this film is excellent. Then, Hollywood has to simplify and dummy down the end. Rent the 1950's version of this, and also read the book. Here's what made those two infinitely more fascinating...

1. Ambiguity! You are never sure if the American was working with the enemy (or who the enemy is, for that matter), or if our main British character wanted to believe he was, was duped like a pawn into believing he was, to get the American killed out of a sense of revenge. This new version destroys that!

2. Our burned-out British journalist DOES NOT get the girl in the end. Hollywood sucks!

Again, the first two-thirds are really good. You just need to tack on the ending of the 1950's version. Not that the 1950's version wasn't without its flaws (the female lead was as far from Vietnamese looking as you can get... try a European with black hair). Combine those two movies, you really would have a movie that's faithful to a phenomenal book.",1134604800,9,969,4.589595375722543
2206699,5,B00079ZAD6,"Yes, the ending was made corny in this version, but the on location scenes at Cao Dai Temple and Continental Palace are wonderful! I was in Viet Nam in the 60s, long before home video, and so seeing this, filmed in some on my favorite places, is worth the cooked up non GG patter near he end.

I just saw this on French TV and loved it.  Will get the DVD now.",1129507200,5,359,3.9722222222222223
2206700,2,B00079ZAD6,"This 1958 film of Graham Greene's novel is interesting today mostly as an historical artifact. It is not a particularly outstanding example of the art of cinema, just a dated melodrama in which the location exteriors in Saigon lead to interior dialogue scenes that are stagy and leaden and obviously take place on unconvincing studio sets. It is admittedly fascinating to see some of the exact same Saigon locations that were used in the 2002 film, and Michael Redgrave does bring a weight and soul to the role of Fowler.

Sadly, however, the film brutalizes his character. Where Greene's novel was about a world-weary Brit, confronted with a blindly idealistic American willing to sacrifice innocent lives in the name of his goals, the film inverts everything. Pyle is a virtual saint and Fowler merely the gullible old man who plays a part in Pyle's downfall not out of a desire to protect the innocent, but simply to rid himself of a romantic rival. It is not difficult to see why Graham Greene was incensed by the film and disowned it.

Fascinatingly, director/screenwriter Joe Mankiewicz manages to make this total change largely by the addition of one scene at the end. His film basically follows Greene's novel, up until [SPOILER WARNING!] an atrocious final scene in which we learn that Fowler has been hoodwinked all along by the Communists, and has destroyed a noble American who was genuinely bringing freedom and hope to Indochina. A prescient warning about America's doomed involvement in Vietnam becomes a piece of jingoistic propaganda to support the war.

The 2002 film, in comparison, is amazingly faithful to the novel. I don't always hold that as the measure of a film's success, but with a master storyteller like Greene, why mess with perfection. Do not choose this film if you want accomplished filmmaking, or an accurate interpretation of Graham Greene's intentions, for that pick up Phillip Noyce's 2002 film. Watch this only afterwards, to see how a few small changes can undermine an entire narrative.",1114300800,69,2027,4.991124260355029

2206709,5,B00079ZAD6,"I enjoyed this black and white movie if for  no other reason it is to my knowledge the only one made (parts of it) in South Vietnam before the war escalated.  I was there for one year in Danang 1968-69 and went to Saigon on four short visits.  I had not seen this movie in many years, perhaps as a young fellow back about the time of its release in 1958  but remembered the attack on the guard tower,  Will watch it again.",1372723200,,422,4.036144578313253
2206710,1,B00079ZAD6,"I was enjoying this movie until the final scene with the Inspector, even though there were a few odd touches that baffled me.  For example, no mention of opium until an allusion right at the end.  No ambiguity in the American's protestations of innocence.

Then came the ending, and as the French Police Inspector made his pitch I realised that the most important part of the novel by Graham Greene had been turned about-face in order to show the American in a good light - ostensibly helping Vietnam.

We know today, and many knew then, that Graham Greene had been prescient in his warning of the consequences of supposedly altruistic American help to Vietnam.  This is literature turned into propaganda - the hypocrisy of pretending this is a film of what Graham Greene wrote is appalling.

No matter how sickening the ending was, the final words of the film made it clear that this was not a genuine attempt to make a movie of a book, but was blatantly dictated by American foreign policy.
The final words on the screen were -

""To The People of the Republic of Vietnam - to their chosen President and Administrators - our appreciation for their help and kindness.""

What an incredible lie.  The people of Vietnam did NOT chose Ngo Dinh Diem, the Americans did.  Misinformation and propaganda right to the last.

PS However, I did enjoy the scenes of Saigon.",1367020800,9,1361,4.676470588235294
2206711,5,B00079ZAD6,"Does the director strictly follow the book or not?  That is an endless question...but it does not address the movie on its own terms. I imagine precious few films actually follow every aspect of a novel, yet they can be quite successful.

As my title suggests, the closest parallel to this movie are the film versions of ""Crime and Punishment.""  In Dostoevsky's book, Raskolnikov deceives his own conscience by murdering a mean-spirited moneylender. It sounds so reasonable on the surface. Alas, the evil inevitably follows him like a shadow.  Essential to the book and the films are the cat and mouse interrogations by the Police Inspector Porfiry of Raskolnikov where the officer hints why so many criminals ultimately confess - to calm their own soul.

Now to ""The Quiet American.""  Because other reviews discuss the plot, I include some spoilers...so if this disturbs you, stop HERE. In his sexual rivalry with a young idealist American who falls in love with his beautiful Vietnamese mistress, Thomas Fowler let's himself be manipulated to let others murder the American for political reasons. Fowler himself has just selfish not political reasons to set his rival up.

Possibly the best section of the movie is the ending - the clever, piercing interrogations by Police Inspector Vigot of Thomas Fowler about the crime. Fowler believes his intelligence as well as his non-participation in the actual physical parts of the crime can save him from conviction.

Does Fowler have a way out...I don't mean a way to deflect blame to others... but a way out for his own soul?  A way out to explain his conduct to others, including his lover, or himself?  A way out to God?  This movie answers that question in a devastating way.  I can't say enough good things about Michael Redgrave's performance as  Thomas Fowler, a world-weary, intellectual reporter unable to comprehend or control his dark, powerful passions. [I can't think of another performance by this British actor that is more perfect than the one he offers in this movie].

As regards comparison to the newer version of the movie, made in 2002, no doubt about it...that later film is extremely well made. Nevertheless, this 1958 picture touched my sentiments in a deeper place.  Subjectively, then, I prefer this version.",1362009600,10,2282,5.0

2206713,4,B00079ZAD6,"Audie Murphy is a top Actor in my book & we have most of his movies.  The Quiet American only in my view's a four star, only because of the plot. Audie Murphy did an outstanding job of acting in this movie but I feel Hollywood deals Audie Murphy bad with what they let him act in.  Audie Murphy was a GREAT actor & did an outstanding job in anything he acted in including The Quiet American.",1344124800,4,391,4.064935064935065
2206714,3,B00079ZAD6,"An odd movie-watching experience.  For the first hour and a half it seems to be following the book pretty faithfully.  True, there is no opium and Redgrave's Fowler is way too stuffy.  The American journalists are not portrayed as drunken boors.  There is a brave attempt at emulating the Third Man by shooting on location (in Saigon), but the Italian studio scenes dominate.  The dialogue is wordy and unhelpful - you still need to have read the book to know what's going on.  It sounds like a stage play from the 50s - worthy but stilted...  But you put all this down to the times.  Ms. Moll is primly pneumatic as Phuong.  You put that down to the times, too.

So, despite a few qualms, the film seems to be progressing nicely.  Then you start thinking.  The doubts creep in.  For the literary 1950s cinema goer the realization dawns just as you are reaching for your coat and wondering if you'll be in time for the last bus:  in a tacked-on ending, the original plot is completely subverted and it is Fowler who is made to look the naive fool, while Pyle is the hero, not responsible for the deadly car bomb.

Having said all that, this DVD was a pleasant way to while away a Saturday afternoon.  Fun to see old Audie doing something different from shooting Injuns.  I nearly gave it just two stars, but the quality of the camera work, not to mention Ms. Moll's very un-Vietnamese, upturned ...er... nose, brightened my day.",1334361600,3,1428,4.515625

2206716,1,B00079ZAD6,"This propaganda film was a deliberate rewriting of Greene's great novel.  It was designed to build support for more active U.S. involvement of the Ngo Dinh Diem dictatorship.  Colonel Edward Lansdale of the C.I.A. had an active engagement in changing the plot from that of the novel, making Fowler into the villain of the story.

2206720,4,B00079ZAD6,"The debate over whether this or the more recent Michael Caine version of ""The Quiet American"" is better tends to revolve around the ending. The 1958 version is certainly less faithful to the ambiguous Greene novel - nevertheless, the ending the director, Mankiewicz, wrote is perfectly consonant with the rest of the film and has a dramatic truth of its own. The politics of the subject matter should not be allowed to obscure this. Rather than being dismissed as dated and politically incorrect, what recommends the earlier version are its strong cinematic elements - filmed on location in Saigon - and a strong cast, particularly Michael Redgrave's performance. Some viewers may question the acting abilities of Audie Murphy, but his is a rather clever piece of casting. The script is rather too wordy, though rarely dull, and the improbability of a reporter who never reports and carries a camera but never uses it also weakens the story - but the look and mood of this production merit high marks.",1269907200,33,1001,4.928994082840236

8046400,5,B00079ZAD6,"Many of the bad reviews for this movie are critical because ""it doesn't follow the book"". How many movies follow a book word per word? Very few and very few have a major plot change which actually improves the book, The director, Joe Mankiewicz actually wrote a twist that Graham Greene would have never written--and it improves a bitter, cynical book and story. This movie was filmed in Vietnam, the actual Vietnam before our war and you get to see the country we fought with before the evil Communist's invasion. It's nothing like you were taught in school. Michael Redgrave is the perfect slime ball and Audie Murphy--who has been blasted long enough as untalented--gives a fine understated performance. Murphy actually carried the larger Redgrave through a rice paddy  while suffering a fever and a few days later he had his appendix removed. All in all, not loyal to the book--but a movie well worth seeing. Graham Greene always carped about his books being made into movies, but on this one he was mad because it was improved.",1469577600,3,1032,4.797752808988764

8046406,2,B00079ZAD6,"although both movies were based on Greene's book of the same name, the 2002 version starring Michael Caine stayed faithful to Greene's original book whereas this 1958 version dramatically altered Greene's story to deliver political propaganda per CIA.
i soon read on Wikipedia that Graham Greene was furious after he saw the 1958 movie and vehemently disavowed this film.

politics aside, this movie was very weak
1. casting. whereas Audie Murphy was a known celebrity fit to play the ""american hero"" in 1958, movie audience today would judge him solely on his acting. It is in the acting department that i find Murphy lacking. his portrayal of the ""Quiet American"" is amateurish compared to Brandon Fraser's. Fraser made Pyle to be naive but good nature and even likable whereas Murphy's rendition was superficial and perfunctory. the worst casting error was Giorgi Moll, an italian model turned actress,  was cast to play the vietnamese girl Phong.  unless one lives in a white centric world, it is difficult to capture make believe to see a white girl trying to look asian. This is like casting Chow Yun Fat to play James Bond 007.

2. 1958 was an era of ""red scare"", ""black list"". movie makers had to comply with US govt edicts including collaborating with CIA to censor and adjust the script. this movie was shot in Vietnam, yet majority of the imagery was chinese thus implicating the china fear in US. the home of Phong was of chinese ambiance, from the stove god to the chinese new year banners. The night club where Fowler found his taxi dancers were chinese, the ma ma san spoke cantonese not vietnamese. Most significantly, the intermediary who ""tricked"" Fowler to murder was chinese.  In fact, i am hard pressed to find anything indigenous to vietnam, as everything was chinese. i bet CIA/State Dept collaborated on the script? vietnam was made to be ""mini china"" and war with vietnam was really to repel china. which was the US govt narrative throughout the entire vietnam war. Greene was far ahead of the american govt as after 58,000 american lives lost, we now know it had nothing to do with the china. The vietnamese just wanted to have their own country back, not under french colonialists, not under russian comitern, not under chinas Mao and definitely not under americans so called democracy.

the 2002 movie starring Michael Caine as Fowler, Brandon Fraser as Pyle stays close to Greene's original novel, the vietnamese girl happily returned to Fowler's arms to be his mistress after Pyles assassination and Fowler was a happy man, continuing reporting from Vietnam how US lost the war.

If you only have 2 hours, go watch the 2002 movie.  However, if you are a history buff, definitely see BOTH films for comparison and appreciate how US govt propaganda works its magic.",1433808000,4,2793,4.865263157894737
8046407,4,B00079ZAD6,"The Quiet American, 1958 film

This film was based on the novel of Graham Greene set in 1953 French Indo-China (now Vietnam). It starts on Tet, the Chinese New Year and shows the traditional celebration. Then we see a dead body by the bank of the river. The people flee before the police arrive! The police bring in the English journalist for questioning; he is the prime suspect. The answers start to paint the picture of this quiet American. He represented the ""Friends of Free Asia"", a charity that tried to do good in French Vietnam. Fowler (symbolic name), the jaded cynical reporter, contrasts to the young fresh Pyle. Phuong represents the Vietnamese people, wise in years but seemingly young. Pyle acts surprised by the life of the dancing escorts, as if there were nothing like this in Texas or New York, or the college towns of America.

The American reporter Granger criticizes the French military, directed from Paris and based on 19th century plans. (How will this change in the 1960s?) Pyle travels to see Fowler, to bring him a message. Fowler acts cranky and bitchy, suggesting some personal problem which can't be mentioned. The romantic triangle symbolizes the Old World - New World conflict over the colony of Vietnam. Who is to become the colonial power? James Michener's ""Sayonara"" tells of American policy regarding marriage. Could Pyle get permission to marry someone with the background of Phuong? Or could this be a ruse to recruit Phuong and build a network of informers? Pyle is importing plastics to create a new industry in Vietnam. Where would the dollars come from, the import regulations, the machinery, etc.?

Action begins on the trip back from the Cao Dai festival. Pyle's car is sabotaged, Fowler's car runs out of gas. They take refuge in a fort, and begin a philosophical discussion on global politics. They escape before the fort is destroyed. Pyle saves Fowler's life when hiding in the swamp (symbolizing American savoir-faire and the involvement in WW II). Fowler's wife will not grant a divorce, but Fowler lies about this! Dominguez brings a secret story to Fowler, about containers of ""Diolactin"", that connect back to General The and Pyle. Hints are given to Fowler to allow him to connect the dots. But the truth is found out about the letter, and Fowler is rebuked by Pyle. Fowler sees the bicycle bombs go off, and Heng provides more facts. (Can't Fowler do any investigating on his own?) After the bombing at the Continental Hotel, Fowler spouts the words that were programmed into him. Fowler's jealousy blinds him to his being manipulated, and he invites Pyle to his apartment. Pyle tells how a Vietnamese in America will become the next Vietnamese leader! When Fowler learns that Pyle will take Phuong away, he signals the Communists. Pyle will not see another dawn. Symbolically, Fowler reads a passage on jealousy.

Inspector Vigot catches Fowler in a lie about when he last saw Pyle, a sign of his guilty knowledge. Fowler is left alone as Phuong leaves him. A gossip columnist will use this in a story! Fowler loses all at the end, its too late for him, The film doesn't explain the reason for the death of Pyle. To cause an American protest? Does the Vietnamese Manufacturing Association want to eliminate foreign competition? The ending is very talkative, but never explains why Pyle was made a target for assassination. If Phuong keeps drinking those milk shakes, she will have to get new clothes. Read the novel for the true ending.

[Why is a ""quiet American"" remarkable? The free speaking without oppression is due to the First and Second Amendment to the Bill of Rights. Are they still operational?]",1426550400,,3663,4.873194221508828
