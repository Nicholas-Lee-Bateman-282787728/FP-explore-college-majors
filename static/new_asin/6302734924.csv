506993,5,6302734924,"""The Honeymooners"" series was perhaps second most important comedy series in the fifties behind ""I Love Lucy."" Jackie Gleason would prove himself as Ralph Kramden is a New York City bus driver who lived in a tenement apartment in Brooklyn, New York with his long suffering wife, Alice (Audrey Meadows). His best friend and upstairs neighbor was Ed Norton (Art Carrney) and his wife, Trixie (Joyce Randolph). Tricia and Alice are best friends as well.

The series only lasted 39 episodes but it could have gone on much longer. Every episode is perfectly written and acted. Gleason wouldn't rehearse until they were ready to film it. Jackie was a perfectionist and naturally played Ralph complexly. Ralph had a big mouth and his best moments were squaring off with his wife, Alice.  Audrey Meadows was stellar and a equal as Alice to Gleason's Ralph. I only known Audrey Meadows and Joyce Randolph as Alice and Trixie, best friends and long suffering wives. Art Carney's Ed Norton was a perfect friend to Jackie Gleason's Ralph Kramden. Norton and Kramden were the male rival to Lucy and Ethel.

The DVD comes with five DVDs with all 39 episodes and a special feature. The series became popular in syndication in the eighties where the quartet were still alive. Jackie Gleason left us too soon. He was brilliant actor and comedian and the Miami Beach Performing Arts Center was renamed in his honor. Audrey Meadows and Art Carney have also passed away too. Joyce Randolph is the last survivor in the series. The series only lasted a season with 39 episodes but they were magnificently shot at the Adelphi Theatre (long defunct) in Manhattan, New York.

There were more episodes but they are probably considered the lost episodes that resurfaced after decades unseen on to HBO in the 1980s. The series is still a timeless classic and aired in marathon on WPIX every New Year's Day.",1515110400,,1878,4.841121495327103

507044,5,6302734924,"I had not seen these episodes in years, and for that reason, many are almost like ""new"" shows for me, and they are actually better than I remembered them being. Definitely a different style of entertainment than what passes for ""comedy"" in today's world, and as other of the classic comedy programs demonstrate; if the actors/actresses and writers have talent---it's not necessary to be rude, crude or vulgar to get laughs.  Worth the price. My only regret is that there weren't more than 39 episodes produced.",1510531200,,510,4.930232558139535

507158,5,6302734924,Hey what can I say I'm 60 years old and grew up with the honeymooners. Lived in a flat in Jersey City just like Ralph did in New York with an over weight cab driver  (my dad). I loved that show back then and still love it today even though I seen the episodes a thousand times. The DVD's are in their own mini cases packed inside main box excellent packaging for those who care to know. The fun never ends watching these it brings many memories back to mind especially the New Years Eve marathons they have on TV in my area I'm sure there are many out there who know what I mean.

507222,3,6302734924,I got this for my Mom.  She loved it.  For me the show holds up well Jackie Gleason was an excellent physical comedian.  And I was impressed with Audrey Meadows.  Who I was able to find an autographed copy of her book Dear Alice soon after this.  Art Carney reminds me kind of like Don Knotts in The Andy Griffith Show.  He kind of comes off as the star.  And Joyce Randolph seems to be very under rated.  This is a deserved classic.,1494460800,,433,4.132530120481928

507228,5,6302734924,I would say the picture quality is good - better than the DVD for sure.  However I've seen better transfers of older shows made on film - The Twilight Zone for example.  Still very happy with the purchase.  About 10 of the episodes have a version that include the original opening sponsor segment.  Buick!  If you don't like that (I do) they do include both versions of the episode.,1491523200,,382,4.478260869565218

Sound seems a little better but picture quality is so much crisper, clearer and more vibrant - OK vibrant for a B/W may seem odd, but it is that much better.

The Honeymooner shows, others have said enough and obviously if you are looking here, you know about the shows and what to expect.  The shows are funny, well made and the stars are awesome.  This Blu Ray set will Take You To The Moon in comparison to DVD set.",1488326400,2,590,4.140350877192983

507495,1,6302734924,"Sorry, but the Honeymooners blu-ray set of the Classic 39 episodes is not better than the DVDs-- AT ALL-- and I viewed both on the same 60"" Samsung hi-def TV and using the same Sony blu-ray player.  The blu-rays are NOT more focused/sharper in the slightest, the difference is almost non-existent except for additional grain on the blu-rays and more black-white contrast-- neither being desirable, in my view.  I PREFER THE DVDS!

The opening music piece looks a bit cleaned up of artifacts on the blu-ray, but on the other hand, a white edge now runs all along the left side of the picture during this part.  They didn't even clean up dirt and artifacts after this point-- during the episodes-- on the blu-rays.

One blu-ray reviewer here said that he saw the beads of sweat on Ralph's face and on the other actors; well, I saw that on the DVDs already.  Didn't see it any better on the BR.

MAYBE I see no difference in picture quality because I have a Sony blu-ray player, which (along with the European Oppo brand) definitely sharpens up DVDs viewed on a high-definition TV better than any other brands; better even than my beloved Panasonic.  (I found this out through much online research a couple of years ago and then by trying different units.)  So, maybe if I were using a Panasonic or other non-Sony/non-Oppo brand of blu-ray player, the DVDs would look worse on my HD TV set-- then making the blu-rays seem sharper in comparison.

The English subtitles (my mother uses them due to hearing impairment) are actually more visible on the DVDs.  Neither the blu-rays nor the DVDs has a ""Play All Episodes"" function . . . why not??

This blu-ray set was a total waste of money.  Buy whichever is cheaper, the DVDs or the blu-rays, but don't think that anything at all is better on the blu-rays.

The blu-ray review websites say the blu-rays look better; sorry, I don't see it.  And I am one who happily double-dips and purchases blu-rays to replace DVDs, for reasons of improved picture quality.  Got nothing better with this.",1474761600,8,2032,4.649859943977591

507569,5,6302734924,"There isn't much more I could add to any review already written about this set of, ""The Honeymooner's Classic 39 Episodes"" on Blu-Ray. Other than to say these gems of Jackie Gleason's genius and talented humor is timeless to this day! I have been a fan of these episodes since I was able to understand the humor. As well as being old enough to stay awake until 11PM when the local network that ran these shows every weekday/night. In fact, this same network continues to keep ""The Honeymooner's"" running at the same timeslot. Owning these episodes on Blu-Ray offers much more than the obvious ability to watch at anytime. The extras are fantastic! Those commercials with Jackie pitching products that ranged from home goods to those beastly automobiles are not only dated, but extremely insightful. To know that Jackie pitched these products to support his own investment in this comedy, was an interesting tidbit into how televised productions were maintained. At that early period of television history, even notable actors did their parts wherever necessary, to keep any given show moving forward. With Jackie at the helm of, Jackie Gleason Productions, it was his baby.

In any case, to not own these ""Classis 39 Episodes"" on Blu-Ray is a missed opportunity to enjoy the comedic genius in crystal clarity! The extras alone are reason enough to make these episodes a part of any collection for anyone who enjoys watching a ""live broadcast"" comedy sketch in front of a live audience with genuine laughter. The Honeymooner's is laugh-out-loud funny, back then, today and always will be. Yet there is only one downside to a Blu-Ray edition. (By no means a deal breaker.) Along with the crystal clarity that standard nightly rebroadcast episodes doesn't show, is the sweating from the cast members. Mainly Jackie. In most of his comedic rants around the stage, on Blu-Ray, you can see how profusely he is sweating. I have no doubt that it was hot under the stage lights, but it appears that all the other cast members weren't suffering the same level of profuse sweating.

There are so many more ""Honeymooner linked"" DVD's and Blu-Ray's being found and sold. ""Lost Episodes"", other ""Specials"" and the like. Personally, I am satisfied with this set. I have shown my kids the comedy that made me laugh-out-loud for decades, and passed it to their generation. They laugh with me. An absolute ""Regular Riot"" that will remain timeless!

507766,4,6302734924,"Like others, this is strictly a review of the technical aspects of the Blu-ray disk and not of the Honeymooners Classic 39. Alright, its the best Ive ever seen of the Honeymooners, but its not the best Ive seen of remastered material. And to a degree this must be related to the source, but Im ignorant as to why, and if someone knows please add a comment.

It seems inferior in quality to the some _standard_ DVD issues Ive seen. The first season of I love Lucy or the 1963 Black and White DVD version of My favorite Martian both seem to be quite superior quality. It is also inferior to the Blu ray version of the Wizard of Oz.

By inferior I mean that there isn't as much detail, the blacks aren't as black etc. Regrettably I don't have the standard DVD version of the Honeymooners so an honest A/B comparison cant be doneand Im not going to buy one just to find out, but againits the best Ive seen of Classic 39.

Was the film itself of an inherently poorer quality than I Love Lucy or My Favorite Martian, in such a way that detail after remastering was minimized? And if so, would the 720p of standard DVD been sufficient to reproduce the remastered information as opposed to the 1080 of Blu-ray? These are lingering questions that I have.",1452470400,2,1245,4.380952380952381

507887,5,6302734924,"What a beautiful set! I bought this for my Dad because he's a huge fan of The Honeymooners, but I also personally wanted to see the new Blu-Ray restoration. What a fantastic job the team did with this one! The clarity of the new transfer from the original 35mm film elements is beautiful, and feels like watching a black & white movie rather than a TV show. Little did they know that by filming the show on film rather than kinescope, they were effectively future-proofing the program to look amazing on technology 50+ years later.

The high-definition does reveal some of the ""flaws"" that were expected to be hidden by television broadcast onto a 13"" screen, such as the scene outside of Ralph and Alice's window is clearly a painting, and the sweat on the actors' foreheads from the hot studio lights is plain as day but that sort-of adds to the charm and ""live""-ness of the program.

You won't be disappointed, if you're a hardcore fan like my dad or if you're just curious how good a 50+ year old show can look on Blu-Ray, this is a good start before you jump into the more expensive sets like ""The Twilight Zone"" and ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" (both of which are absolutely stunning).",1442880000,13,1187,4.5162790697674415

In a world of so much narcissism,  dishonoring of women, and  abuse, this series I believe would be very  offensive to victims of abusers,  but it also is revealing.  Alice's lines and behavior reveal the stupidity of male chauvinism, but at the same time, there are some facets of her own co-dependency.  Yet that was consistent with that era.  .  I hated this series as a kid....because I hated the male chauvinism I observed.  Now I can see through it better and find it quite hilarious and revealing of the ills of human nature",1436486400,,1023,4.732954545454546

 Well, well, yes well worth the $40, outstanding picture and sound and tons of extras. A nice package well done that holds the discs perfect too. A booklet would have been a nice addition however. Too bad they did not put something together.

 I've a much stronger appreciation for this now than ever before.

 I've most likely seen all classic 39 more than a few times somewhere along the line as a kid and later, but running through them all in several days made a stronger impression on me than ever before.

 Considering the scant apartment room scenes usually used and the basic theme, they really pulled off a fantastic job with this show.

 I not only laughed a hell of a lot watching this, but I shed a few tears more than once also. And it take a lot to move me.

 Kudos to Jackie and the crew.

 I'm going to let this stew in my mind for a while and run through it all again. I've already got my money's worth regardless.

These episodes are truly timeless as any adult age can enjoy them, the packaging was great with the attention for detail per episode information, and when I bought it the price of $14.87 for 39 classic episodes was a phenomenal deal!  The primary trio of Ralph, Alice, and Norton were three actors of impeccable talent.  And I loved how Audrey Meadow's Alice character could not only belt hard with fantastic deadpan retorts, but at times they also had a feminist vibe of frustration at her place in life.

And for those who grew up with watching this show on television, The episodes are presented in their original 4:3 broadcast ratio and are offered in 1080p using the AVC codec. In general, the images are sharp and clear with above average grayscale boasting fine black levels and clean whites. But there are some scratches to be seen occasionally and dust specks on a fair number of episodes. Of course, some of the sponsor materials have been taken from much lower level quality elements occasionally even approaching kinescope level quality. Each episode has been divided into 5 chapters. The classic thirty-nine episodes of The Honeymooners have never looked or sounded as good as they do in this new Blu-ray set.",1415750400,12,846,5.00709219858156

508364,4,6302734924,"Well, it took awhile but I finally watched all 39 Episodes of ""The Honeymooners"" including the special features which was finally(after at least three delays) released on Blu-ray May 6th. It was great to watch Ralph, Alice, Ed and Trixie again after all these years in one of the classic television series of the 50's(along with ""I Love Lucy"" and ""The Twilight Zone""). I'm not going to spend time discussing the series because almost everyone who's watched any television over the last sixty years has probably seen at least one or more of the episodes. That being said, this review will cover the video and audio qualities of the new Blu-ray from CBS. As far as the video quality, ""The Honeymooners"" looks pretty good on Blu-ray. Those expecting a pristine Blu-ray picture like Image Entertainment's recent Blu-ray of the  ""The Twilight Zone"" series might be disappointed especially when viewing the first few episodes on Disc One. To be fair, the picture quality improves dramatically once you get to Discs Two through Five, but there are still some problems scattered here and there. Some scenes appear out of focus while others are fuzzy. Most of the episodes however are crystal clear. For instance, check out the episode called ""The Worry Wart""(on Disc Four) when Ralph and Ed are sitting at the kitchen table discussing the letter Ralph received from the IRS. You can clearly see a drop of sweat at the end of Art Carney's nose that's how clear the picture is(probably from the hot studio lights above). The opening credits still have some damage but this may be due to how the series was filmed and preserved more than anything else. Unlike ""I Love Lucy"" which was filmed using 35 mm cameras, ""The Honeymooners"" was filmed using three ""Electronicams"" which were developed by the DuMont Television Network for it's shows in the 50's(one of which was ""Capt. Video and his Video Rangers"" for you trivia fans). According to Wikipedia(thank you) the Electronicams had two cameras attached to it: a 35 mm camera on the right side and a video camera tube on the left side(for live broadcasts). Per Wikipedia: ""Without Electronicams, the half-hour 'The Honeymooners' episodes in the 1955-1956 season may have been broadcast live and would only exist as poor quality kinescopes"". Based on that, I can only assume that the 39 Classic episodes for the standard DVD and this new Blu-ray were from the 35 mm camera negatives. If that's the case, then anyone purchasing this new set will be pleased especially since all the episodes are in the 1.33 Aspect Ratio(There will be black bars on both sides of your screen) and this allows for a tighter picture. You can readily read the headlines of the newspapers, magazines  and other props that the actors use as well as the names of some of the food products displayed. Another improvement is the Audio which is very clear and free of any noise related artifacts. Later episodes were filmed before a live audience and you can sometimes hear some of kids in that audience talking during the performance that's how clear the sound is. Breaking down the episodes for each disc: There are eight episodes each on Discs 1 through 3; nine episodes on Disc 4 and six episodes on Disc 5 for a total running time of 16 hours and 57 minutes. All episodes are in B&W. Subtitles are in English SDH and Spanish. Audio is English Mono only. Viewers also have the option of watching twelve of the episodes with the Original Sponsor Materials(usually for the Buick automobile). There are a lot of Special Features including Two Promos(Disc 1), ""Best Buick Yet"" Dealer Presentation(21 minutes-Disc 2), the '60 Minutes' Jackie Gleason Profile(Disc 3) and both the 35th & 50th Anniversary Specials and a 'Person to Person"" segment featuring Jackie Gleason in which he interviews a real Brooklyn bus driver(Disc 5). This new Blu-ray set comes in a standard Blu-ray case that holds each of the five discs separately inside. The Blu-ray case itself is housed in a slipcase for added protection.  ""The Honeymooners"" was one of the best comedies on television and  this new Blu-ray presentation from CBS only enhances it's appeal after all these years. It should be a welcome addition to any film and television home entertainment library and comes highly recommended.",1400457600,49,4285,4.889958734525447
508365,5,6302734924,"The classic show ""The Honeymooners"" has influenced TV series from ""The Flintstones,"" to ""The King Of Queens.""  Jackie Gleason's larger-than-life size, larger-than-life personality, and loud expressions (""Bang! Zoom!""), carried the show, as lead character Ralph Kramden.  Given the nickname ""The Great One"" by none other than Orson Welles, Jackie certainly deserved that title.  His best friend Ed Norton, played by Art Carney, was the perfect best friend to suffer Ralph's temper tantrums, and come back for more.  Speaking of suffering, his long-suffering wife Alice was played to perfection by Audrey Meadows.  Nicely rounding out the quartet was Trixie Norton, Ed's understanding wife, played by Joyce Randolph.  One of my favorite episodes was ""Better Living Through TV,"" originally broadcast on November 12, 1955.  Ralph buys a big supply of an all-purpose kitchen gadget, and plans to make a big profit.  Ralph: ""Two thousand dollars, Alice!  That's big, big, big!  This is probably the biggest thing I ever got into.""  Alice: ""The biggest thing you ever got into was your pants!""  Ralph does a live commercial as the Chef of the Future, with Ed as the Chef of the Past.  Ralph is so nervous, he can barely speak his lines, then falls over, wrecking the set!  Another favorite episode is ""Alice and the Blonde,"" which was originally broadcast on June 2, 1956.  Alice and Trixie get jealous when they watch Ralph and Ed being overly attentive to the sexy blonde wife of Ralph's boss.  The next day, Ralph comes home from work to find no dinner on the table, and Alice all dolled up.  Alice: ""I'll go fix my lipstick.  I won't be gone long, Killer.  I call you Killer, 'cause you slay me.""  Ralph: ""And I'm calling Bellevue, 'cause you're nuts!""  The timeless humor of all the episodes remain as fresh today, as when they were originally broadcast.",1400457600,,1852,4.96742671009772

508369,5,6302734924,"I've only watched 3 episodes so far and simply don't want to stop. The Honeymooners classic 39 blu-ray looks nearly as good as Image Entertainment's Twilight Zone Blu-Ray's and that my good friends is a compliment of the very highest order.

It's not often that Blu-Ray Movie or TV efforts look as good as the medium is capable, lucky for us this is one of those times.

From Michale Zupan on dvdtalk.com and I agree with every word:
""The amount of detail [on the Honeymooners Blu-Ray set] on display is astonishing. I've seen pristine black and white presentations before - most notable of which being The Twilight Zone and The Dick Van Dyke Show - but The Honeymooners can almost go toe-to-toe with them. The fine grain from the 35mm film source has been left intact, meaning all the fine details you'd expect from a high-def disc is present. You'll see individual strands of hair, threads in clothing, Gleason's sweat caused by the studio lights (okay, so there are some downsides to HD)... everything. Because the contrast and black levels are so immaculate, you can even see fine details in Gleason's jet black hair. And speaking of contrast, the whites never bloom and blacks are never crushed. Honestly, I felt like I was watching 35mm film as opposed to... well, whatever we've been treated to over the years. It was like watching The Honeymooners for the very first time.""

Good friends this blu-ray set is a bit pricey but if you are a fan of the show it is worth every cent. While these 58 year old episodes from TV's golden age are not pristine, nor can they ever be, the only way you can have nicer looking version of the Honeymooners classic 39 would be to own the original 35mm film reels!",1399507200,10,1704,4.617161716171617

508417,5,6302734924,"Performed live on stage and filmed for the fledgeling Dumont Television Network, the Honeymooners was an experimental ""spinoff"" from Jackie Gleason's regular TV variety series in 1955. It was based on the old Cavalcade skits of a ""blowhard"" bus driver Ralph Kramden, his pal Ed Norton, and their misadventures and ""get rich quick"" schemes.

This was the birth of Television and experimental comedy at its best with a good dose of pathos. The Honeymooners only ran one season, but by episode 39 you come to love the characters with all their qualities and failings. It is probably one of the most important collection of work from 1950s Television, and is eclipsed only by the longer running I Love Lucy series from the same period. Both shows are timeless and I strongly recommend both!

The Honeymooners DVD album is nicely laid out and the menus are simple to navigate. The episodes have been beautifully, digitally remastered from the old Dumont Electronicam masters owned by the late Jackie Gleason himself. The B&W is crisp and the audio just as perfect. No flaws in the discs either.

No videophile's DVD collection is complete without Jackie Gleason's groundbreaking Honeymooners. Simply a wonderful, funny and timeless classic from television history.",1394064000,,1259,5.131707317073171

I am amazed that the show had 4 stars and was basically set in one apartment yet it, still today, stands as one of the best tv shows. Just goes to show that it really is the writing and acting that make the show, not the money or varied locations. In my opinion it is a timeless classic. Even though my children and grandchildren are use to color tv and, of course, political correctness, they love this show as much as I do. I found it interesting that one child said, "" even though you aren't suppose to say fat they did. It's okay because everybody knows they love him, fat or not."" Hmm. Apparently children are able to distinguish love and friendship even though the words are not politically correct.

508521,3,6302734924,"The show itself gets five stars. But this is a review of the DVD set.

The packaging is excellent. You get a box that stores five slim dvd cases. The cases slide right out of the box with ease. And the disks are easy to take out of the cases without a struggle, or fear of cracking them. The cases are clear, and have beautiful artwork on them. The back of the cases have the episode title, and a still from that episode. And on the inside, there's a brief synopsis for each episode. Which is very helpful.

However my major complaint is that there's no 'play all' feature. So you are forced to manually select each episode to watch it. This is quite an inconvenience for anybody who enjoys marathon watching. The 'play all' feature is commonplace among TV DVDs, so there is no excuse as to why it isn't included. My other complaint is the sound on select episodes. It's very low, and hard to hear. And my last complaint is that when you put the DVD in, you can't skip straight to the main menu, and you are forced to sit through all that mumbo-jumbo.

I wish I could give this set five stars. But I don't understand why the 'play all' was feature omitted from this set. How could they possibly disregard that classic staple among TV DVDs?",1388534400,4,1239,4.331896551724138

508525,5,6302734924,"When I was young (I'm now 53), I would stay up late to watch reruns of the Honeymooners which had already been around for several years (all black and white too) and would thoroughly enjoy them. As soon as VHS tapes became affordable, I bought the classic 39 in that format and then later in the DVD version.

This is where the sitcom had it's beginnings and is still some of the best and funniest after all these years. If you're familiar with the Hanna Barbera cartoon ""The Flintstones"" (and who isn't if you grew up in America in the 60's), then you know ""The Honeymooners"" as this is what the cartoon is based on.

Ralph (Jackie Gleason) and Alice (Audrey Meadows) Kramden and Ed (Art Carney) and Trixie (Joyce Randolph) Norton played out most of their episodes with the Kramden's sparce dining area/kitchen as their backdrop and with story lines that were simple, clean, very funny and heart warming. Ralph and Ed were blue collar workers (Ralph as a bus driver and Ed as a sewer worker in NY) who were always scheming on how to do things (mostly how to make quick money). In the end, no matter how badly Ralph screwed up and lost everything, Alice would always forgive him.

Yeah, I know. People say retaining black and white format keeps it real. But look; life is in color. When Oscar Schindler saved all of those Jews, they saw each other in color, as did Ralph and Alice & co. March of the Wooden Soldiers became a feast for the eyes when it was colorized.

508555,5,6302734924,"I became dissatisfied with TV fifteen or twenty years ago when prime-time viewing began featuring unfunny sitcoms, unreal reality shows and melodramatic dramas. At about that time they started producing DVDs of old shows, so I decided to collect the best of them.
 Jackie Gleasons The Honeymooners not only was one of the best TV shows of all-time: It was the first truly great show. In my opinion, it was the best live sitcom ever.
 Make no mistake about it, live can mean problems. There was one scene in which Audrey Meadows (Alice Kramden) was unavoidably detained offstage and made a very late entrance, while husband Ralph Kramden (Gleason) and his buddy, Ed Norton (Art Carney), produced one clever ad lib after another to fill the empty air space.
 Gleason, Carney and Meadows were brilliant in their respective roles, and Joyce Randolph, playing Nortons wife, was competent.
 Some of the episodes were absolute classics. My favorite was the one in which Kramden panicked while trying to sell handy-dandy housewife helpers during a live TV ad.
It has been about five decades since The Honeymooners, and in all that time the only sitcom Ive seen as good was Wings.
Here are the ten shows I watch most often in a delightful fare of prime-time DVD viewing: 1. Little House on the Prairie; 2. Touched by an Angel; 3. The Closer; 4. Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman; 5. Bonanza; 6. Hawaii Five-0 (the original show with Jack Lord); 7. The Dick Van Dyke Show; 8. Highway to Heaven; 9. Wings; 10.

Unfortunately, before I knew about ear protection at concerts, I saw dozens of Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, John Lee Hooker, and Eric Clapton shows, to name but a few. At only 55, I'm paying for it now. May I digress?

What memories though! Special thanks to the great, great Charlie Watts, who gave me his personal backstage invitation, and every Stones' autograph, during the '99 Stones tour stop in Kansas City. Thanks also to Eric Clapton for the autograph and guitar picks.

Most especially, my thanks and love to blues giant John Lee Hooker, (1917[?]-2001). You were my ""adopted Black grandfather"" for the final twenty years of your life. I truly love and miss your kind, gentle wisdom and raucous sense of humor. You never learned to read, John Lee, but with that photographic memory, you were the smartest guy I ever knew.

508623,5,6302734924,"As anyone reading this must agree we're die hard Honeymooner's fans.

I've been addicted to the Honeymooners for 45 years and I can tell you, I still laugh at my favorite episodes as hard and as deeply as when I saw them for the first time as a child.

As for Jackie Gleason, the other reviews here to more than fair justice to the Great One. A master of comedy, a brilliant performer, one of the few true examples of a real photographic memory, exceptional dancer and coordination as well as a musical Prodigy.

It was Gleason who composed the theme song for the Honeymooners.

The chemistry between the cast, the witting, the simple elegance and magic between Gleason and Art Carney stands alone as one of the greatest comedy teams of all time. If you're a fan or know someone who is this is set is marvelous in every single way.

I've never found the Lost Episodes to be as sharp and funny as the classic episodes. Historically they're important of course and I'm happy to own them. However it's here, within the classic episodes that each character is at the very top of their game.

To me, this set would be worth it at three times the cost - but at this reduced price and free two day shipping for Prime members it's a steal.

The outer box is well designed and sturdy. Each DVD is housed in it's own case and the production value is superb.

Simply a must have for any Honeymooners fan

508724,5,6302734924,"And away we go!

Here we have 39 of the best Honeymooner episodes hand picked by the greatest fat man of our time. Governor Christie? No. HELL, no. I'm talking about the one and only Jackie Gleason. In a rare tv interview shortly before his death he christened these episodes as the ones he likes best, for one simple reason. ""They're funny,"" he said. It's an interesting interview if you get a chance to see it. In the same interview he also reveals he was very upset not being offered the part of Archie Bunker.

These DVD episodes are of considerable quality; clear, crisp, black and white film. My wife says I watch them a little too often. I get to behaving like Ralph. (It's contagious!)

Casting of these productions was artistry at its zenith. Even the bit parts were perfectly cast. However, it all came tumbling down when Audrey Meadows quit the show. She got married in real life and kissed her show biz days ""goodbye,"" a stunning blow to Jackie in the prime of his career. And so he tried, and tried again, but couldn't find another Audrey. ""Baby, you're the greatest,"" but you're gone, gone, gone. Alas, the show foundered. It was never the same again.

And pardon ME, but did I say ""show?"" You know, ""The Honeymooners"" was never a show of its own until it went into reruns way back when. (Way back before Alf Landon became presidential timber). It was merely a SKIT in the hour long Jackie Gleason Show which aired on CBS in the 1950's. ""The Honeymooners"" was not actually included every week. Jack played other characters in other skits: Reginald Van Gleason III, the Poor Soul, Joe the Bartender, Rudy the Repairman.... However, it was The Honeymooners that was destined to become the lasting favorite. The announcer at the time was Jack Lescoulie.

If you like The Honeymooners these DVD's are a must have.

The Honeymooners are and continue to be a television legend of comedy;  they are timeless, brilliant w / o equal and, perhaps, represent elements of daily living which have been shared by most families in one form or another over many decades.

Norton proceeds to address the ball, by saying Hello Ball. It doesn't get any funnier than this. Another one that I found hilarious is when Ralph throws Alice's mother out of their apartment. Alice goes to live with her. Norton comes up with the idea to record an apology to Alice. Ralph starts out nicely, telling Alice how terribly sorry he is for always saying that she has a big mouth. A few seconds into the recording, Ralph goes ballistic and does nothing but talk badly about his mother-in-law. Norton pulls out another record, and this time Ralph makes a sincere apology.

Art Carney's Ed Norton is one of the single greatest comedic characters ever created.  If America has a single clown, it's Ed Norton.  (If it has more, then the others are Tony Randall's neurotic Felix Ungar, Steve Carrel's sincere dufus Michael Scott, Martin Short's outrageous Jimmeny Glick, Leslie Nielsen's asinine Lt. Frank Drebin... if you can think of others, add them to this list as a comment.)

The writing for the show was some of the best, creating ludicrous situations and drawing everything out of the characters.

There simply aren't more than a handful of comedies that remain this potent for this long a period of time.  And that's because it's great art.",1320883200,2,831,4.892857142857143

508913,5,6302734924,"A classic TV series. Being from the NY area these episodes ran nightly at 11PM and always were the best way to end an evening. I think I know these shows word for word from watching them so often. Jackie Gleason shows great chemistry as the know it all, heavyset bus driver Ralph Kramden, always coming up with new get rich quick schemes, or getting himself into hot water. His goofy sidekick Ed Norton (Art Carney) always gets roped into Ralphs' crazy ideas, but the two manage to work out the issues, and come out smelling like roses. Audrey Meadows stars as Alice, Ralphs' wise cracking wife, and the interactions between her and Gleason are some of the funniest moments ever seen on TV. If you've ever seen the Flintstones cartoon you'll notice the similarities right away as the Flintstones incorporated a lot of this series into their episodes. Not the best video or audio qualities, but it's a flashback to a simpler time of live TV and no reruns.

1. One of TV's first spin-offs, it was a skit on the hour long JACKIE GLEASON SHOW.

2. Was broadcast at 8:30--mistake-didn't break the top ten, by the time they put it at 8:00, it was too late.

3. Video quality--has a ""live"" feel to it, like it was taped.  There was no tape back then. so how did they do it? The ELECTONICAM TV FILM SYSTEM, from Viacom, also used for SGT. BILKO, was state-of-the-art.

Gleason inexplicably pulled out after #39, stating ""the excellent of the material can't be maintained""....??? consider

508972,5,6302734924,"You see, to me, Jackie Gleason and Lucille Ball were the best comedy personalities to ever grace this earth, and this series just brings me back to my childhood, and is hardly shown on TV anymore, so being able to have it all here is pure bliss for me, this is classic tv comedy from the golden age of television, and with what sitcoms are today, it is so nice knowing I can just go to my shelf, grab a DVD, pop it in, and watch good clean comedy is a great feeling, and this is a very nice box set.

It's a 5 disc set with 5 slim cases inside a nice box, each disc has 8 episodes, except for disc 5, which has 6 I believe, and the extras which is a 20 minute documentary, and original openings and closes from Buick, now I have seen some people complain about the low audio on the first episode, and while that is true, I find it to be minor, just turn your system up a bit more, also, no, these are not remastered, but I think they look just fine, although on the episode 'The Sleepwalker' the last portion of the show does look quite different than the rest, I'm guessing this is the best print they had of it, but most of them look fine, now don't get me wrong, they deserve remastering, but they do look very good, people have to realize, this stuff is over 50 years old, and without remastering like they did with 'I Love Lucy' you're bound to have to tears and dirt at times, maybe someday they will be remastered, but for now, I can FOR SURE live with this!

So, bottom line, this is a great set for any fan of The Honeymooners, and this is the only release available at the present time, so you'll have to get it, it is worth my $35.00, I think CBS/Paramount did a fine job considering they aren't remastered, and for people who've never seen this classic series, if you're a fan of good clean classic comedy from the golden age, I would highly suggest picking up this set, like I said, Jackie Gleason and Lucille Ball are my favorites of all time, and now I can enjoy both whenever I want!",1292889600,,1999,4.149484536082475

508975,5,6302734924,"This review applies to the classic 39 episodes that made up the stand-alone series that originally aired in the late 1950's.  This does not apply to the ""lost episodes"" retrieved from the earlier ""Jackie Gleason Show"" nor does it apply to the contrived ""musicals"" from the later ""Jackie Gleason Show"" from Miami Beach. Both of these are diluted examples of a classic idea that inspired and influenced countless TV shows that followed in its wake.

All of us that have seen the ""Classic 39"" no doubt have fond recollections of the scheming Ralph Kramden, his dimwitted buddy Ed Norton, and their long suffering wives Alice and Trixie.  We remember Ralph raising the window in his modest two room apartment and hollering up to his buddy and neighbor Ed.  And how about Ralph standing behind Alice who is sitting at the dining room table as he motions silently tring to figure out how to apologize. Or the lodge meetings... or the social disasters involving Ralph's Boss.  You might remember Ralph teaching Ed to play Golf and telling him he must first address the ball (""Helllooo BALL!"").

Customer Ratings

Customer Ratings allow you to share information on the product attributes you consider important and rate those attributes on a 5-star scale. For example, in addition to providing an overall star rating for a product, you can rate and comment on individual features of that product--such as ""battery life"" on an iPod Nano. You can also create new attributes to rate. - end of excerpt

Please take notice of ""you can rate and comment on individual features of that product""

----------------------------------
I include this excerpt to make it clear that any problems with the audio levels of this product would fall under the umbrella of a customer rating. Keep in mind that in the spirit of Amazon's intent, this is not intended to be a rating of the Honeymooners program, but rather a rating of this specific product.

The Honeymooners is one of my all-time favorites. The one and major problem with this product is that the audio is too low. I can't hear what they're saying, and I don't like blasting my speakers and hearing background hissing.

I love the Honeymooners, but because of the sound issue, I don't recommend this product. Going through some of the other negative reviews, I see that this was not an isolated incident, hence there's no excuse for this. It is not often that I give a poor review, but in this case, I simply cannot enjoy the product because of the sound, or lack thereof. Considering all of the 5 star votes this product has received, it is clear to me that there must be many that were produced with good audio. Amazon is great with handling returns, so you might want to order this and check out the audio. If it is low on yours too, you can always return it. I unfortunately did not have a chance to check this dvd out until a good while after I purchased it; that is why I am stuck with a dud.

I'll give this 2 stars out of respect for the Honeymooners, but this product deserves 1 star because of the poor transfer to DVD. (see Leonard A. Schmidt Jr. ""50s Bunky""'s 3 star review and Richard J. Goldschmidt ""Rick Goldschmidt""'s 1 star review for more on this audio issue)

***UPDATE***
After having this stashed away for years, I played one of the other DVD's and everything looks and sounds great.. so it looks like there's just an issue with some of the episodes. Because of this, I'm going to raise my rating of the product to three.",1288396800,6,2526,4.686230248306997

I would laugh so hard and end up going right to sleep from exaustion right after. It was such a good feeling. I always wanted to meet the cast of the honeymooners just to say thank you for giving me so much joy. It really is one of the few shows that I hold dear. I know anyone who watches this will get that same feeling as me. This was one show that was very simple and pure.

Most of the episodes have a similar plot - Ralph overreacts or misunderstands or somehow gets himself into trouble along with Norton and then Alice has to fix the situation or suffer the consequences.  Then Ralph sheepishly apologizes and asks forgiveness and Alice forgives and we're all back to happily-ever-after normality!  But the comedy is true and the situations, however far-fetched, all have a believeablity factor and it always makes you laugh.  The main four characters are all endearing in their simplicity and in the particular quirks and characteristics they bring to the table.

When analyzing television shows that were written and produced in the 50's and 60's, the dynamic that existed between men and women back then seems to be from more than just a different decade or different era.  From an alternate universe is more like it!  Young adults now must watch these shows in disbelief and wonder if that's really how it was or if the writers are just making it up for a laugh.  In an era where Ricky actually spanked Lucy with his hand on a regular basis - or where Samantha has to ask permission from Darrin for her mother to spend the night - or where Ralph berates Alice with enough screaming and screeching to have neighbors calling 911 - we still find humor in these stories of a bygone era where men are dominant and obnoxious and women obey until the husband leaves long enough for them to clean up the mess and restore order!  As much as people today probably would not really be happy going back to ""the good old days"" - for they were only good old days if you were white, male, heterosexual with a subservient wife, obedient children and a good job -  we do enjoy the laughs written into these old shows.  We can laugh along with the jokes and smile at a simple time in American society when lines weren't fuzzy yet and the worries around us didn't seem so global.  But when looking at what all would have to be sacrificed in order to have that simple time again, most of us are happy to stay where we are!",1276992000,,2086,4.592991913746631

and i forgot how art carney could be so funny .incredible actor .the duet gleason-carney almost better than laurel and hardy or abbot and costello .
it was a pleasure and bought me back a few decades ago .and i had forgotten that most of the episodes were played in front of a live audience .

Picture this, Ralph opens his mouth to say, ""Humma, humma, humma"" and not even one humma comes out. When you finally get the episode working again you are past the line, but grateful the disc is working again.

One of the discs would not play at all and two had places where the program stopped and it would take five minutes to start it up again.

The Honeymooners was a wonderful program and we have spent many evenings watching the classic episodes, sometimes laughing ourselves silly. We just wish we could have seen them all.

It stays very low, and often is hard to hear. Also, there seems to be something that doesn't tell my dvd player to bring up the screensaver. This is the only discs I have that will just sit there and burn into the screen, all others obviously trigger a screensaver after so many minutes, these do not.

When Jackie Gleason (the original ""great one"" before Wayne Gretzky) started a sketch/variety/music show in the early 50's on CBS, one of his recurring comedy sketches was of ""The Honeymooners,"" which told the simple tales of an overweight, common man, Brooklyn bus driver Ralph, with big dreams and disappointments, his long-suffering but loving (and lovely) wife Alice, and their neighbor pals, crazy Ed Norton, a sewer worker, and his wife Trixie.  The orginal brief sketch segments would prove to be so popular that Gleason later just turned to these characters in a sort of spinoff, but in a full, filmed half-hour length series of its own.  Later, Gleason turned back to sketch and variety, but as before, ""The Honeymooners"" remained in more shorter episodes, and later and hour long color versions were to come because of simple fan demand, and so much more.

The generally shorter and only slightly less memorable ""lost episodes"" of ""The Honeymooners"" were never filmed, but saved to primitive video captures, and are available for purchase elsewhere on Amazon, but in my opinion, they fall short of this DVD set, which contains the high quality and original ""classic 39"" when this was a weekly series all of its own.  For those with the bread, and for any true Honeymooners fan, the ""lost episodes"" are also worth scrimping and saving for (as I think they are rather overpriced), but any basic Honeymooners fan will want to get this first collection, and proceed on from there.  Jackie Gleason's ""Honeymooners"" would later be reincarnated in a 1960's hour long, color version, albeit with different actresses playing Alice and Trixie, but from memory alone (as I have not seen the hour color episodes in many moons), even those are or should be a must buy for true Honeymooners super-fans.

What makes the original 39 ""classic"" episodes such an eternal joy, is really quite simple, especially compared with nearly every other ""situation comedy"" that came before or after it.  This show was and remains simply ""funny.""  And that came from the writing, the execution, the cast, the characters, and the ""situations"" which developed in each and every story.  There has never been such comic (and at other times seriously touching) genius on television, period, before this show, and since to this very day.

While so much has already been written about, and probably said better than I could about this TV icon/legend of a show, while one could break it all down with greater depth and meaning, the plain fact is that this was and remains television's highest achievement as far as just plain ""funny"" goes.  Every single one of these 39 episodes is a treasure, full of unforgettable moments and cast/character interactions, scripted lines and situations, unscripted and ad-libbed ones (as this was filmed before a live audience, something almost unheard of at the time), and every single episode is a comedy-candy treat to watch and re-watch over and over again.  For the latter reason alone, this is truly a must-buy for any and all DVD collectors of ""comedy.""

Watching this series, which featured the most plain ""set"" in TV comedy history, a true fan cannot help to be amazed at the ""replay"" value here.  No other comic television series or collection has ever come close to this, and I doubt any ever will.  But while earlier and later, other TV series would present so many more episodes in number, this, a scant 39 episodes worth, will forever remain that which all other TV comedy series are judged against.  This is, again, just simply funny, down-to-earth, comic/pathos genius, and even replaying certain segments and lines and moments from memory alone, can still provide infinite private and shared laughs.

That really is the hallmark of any great work of art/comedy, the ability of simple memories alone to make one giggle or laugh, even in the middle of the night or day, and even during tough times when life beats us down into sadness and depression.  The ""populist"" and ""common-man"" nature of this collection and series, has the ability to touch the best in even the least of us all, and whatever one's position in life, almost everyone will find a lot to simply love about this great work of art/comedy.  And reason to go on, and hope for the best, from this crazy thing we call existence.  For if laughter is truly a medicine, this is the best prescription ever created.

While Honeymooner fans and fanatics will always find endless enjoyment from the ""classic 39"" for various reasons, the fact is, I have always identified with this whole general idea on my own personal levels.  One being an appreciation for the simple art of something being just pure ""funny,"" two, being as how I grew up in just such a lower-lower middle class upbringing myself but one, bottom line, filled with love, and three, my father (sans the weight), who died young but was a great fan and introduced me and my brother to this long ago, and who strangely enough, looked almost exactly like Jackie Gleason.

To this day, for personal and objective reasons alike, this collection, which I bought for myself as well as for my brother as a gift, represents the height of TV situation comedy, and TV comedy in general.  Each and every episode included here, is ""classic,"" and for good reason.  A true Honeymooners fan will never get tired of these.  Unlike most other DVD's and DVD collections, this is one you will watch again and again.  Nicely packaged, produced, presented, and excellently priced as I write this, this is worth its weight in gold, every penny.  Every single episode is a total winner.  And every episode itself, is pure gold, period.

For any true-blue Honeymooners fan with the means, you just, MUST buy this.  You'll never regret the purchase.  In fact, I'm sure it will be eventually be seen by you as the best money you ever spent, on just about anything...",1198540800,3,6660,4.888888888888889

509208,5,6302734924,"There is absolutely nothing negative I can say about this DVD set.

The Honeymooners has always been my favorite TV series of any type, hands down.  Even though I can recite the dialogue word for word, it never gets ""old"".  The Honeymooners succeeds on so many levels because most of the audience can relate to Ralph Kramden with his struggles, dreams and the love that exists between him and Alice.  Alice herself is long-suffering, puts up with her husband's foibles, can stand face to face with him and end it all with a gigantic hug.

Then there's Ed Norton--funny, irritating at times, but just like Alice's love, his loyalty to his friend is an inspiration.  Trixie is a softer, gentler version of Alice, and this is fine as most of the problems seem to emanate from Ralph and his various schemes and dreams.

I love the fact that the plots are much simpler then the sitcoms of today, and sex is not used in order to get laughs from the audience.  We could use more of this type of comedy in this day and age when it seems that toilet humor and sexual antics are basic requirements for a show to be a hit.

We owned these episodes on VHS but there is a definite improvement with them transferred to DVD.  There has been some criticism of the quality, but personally I'm not aware of anything that distracts from these wonderful shows.

The Honeymooners is one of those gems of our society that should be passed down to each generation.  Nothing is lost through the decades that have past, and in fact I find a nostalgic comfort in viewing something that has stood the test of so many years and has for all time given us the ""bus driver with a heart of gold"".

509209,5,6302734924,"It doesn't come any more spartan than this! 80% of The Honeymooners took place in the same set, often with no additional cast; just knockout performances, great scripts and brilliant characterisation, which have been endlessly stolen in other sitcoms.

This box set is exactly what you're looking for. It's the 39 great eps of the Honeymooners sitcom (not the sketches that appeared on the Jackie Gleason Show and others). There seems to be a bit of confusion about the quality of the transfers in this box set. There shouldn't be. They are as good as it gets. Remember that you are looking at a 1950's television show and there is a limit, but I've never seen the show look better. The sound also is the best I've heard for the show.

It's not stuffed full of speacial features, in fact there is only a Honeymooners special from the 80's (and a shortened version at that), but once you have this box, you won't need another. It's all here to enjoy in the best possible quality and it's well priced.

509295,5,6302734924,"""They called him ""The Great One"" and for many, the name didn't begin to do him justice. He was a man of large appetites and even larger talents. He was a multiple pack-a-day chain smoker and enjoyed an adult beverage or two. He refused to fly and traveled everywhere by private train car. At the height of his popularity, he was the highest paid television star in the history of the medium and millions watched his variety show every week. While he was a god of the small screen and the nightclub stage, big screen mega-stardom eluded him. From critical acclaim (he was Minnesota Fats alongside Paul Newman in The Hustler) to saccharine cult clamor (he's one of the few good things about the deaf mute mush of Gigot) his Tinseltown appearances further proved that only the glass teat was able to properly channel his larger than life persona into a true mirror of his humor and heart. Sadly, for most in our new power generation, he is the foul-mouthed sheriff from Smokey and the Bandit or the ludicrous big wig who buys his son a black man as a gift in The Toy. But Jackie Gleason was so much more than a curse word filled hick or a rich racist. He was a superstar before there really was such a nomenclature. He was a Renaissance man in a world filled with teeming mediocrity. His creative legacy begins and extends infinitely with the formation of what, for many, is the foundation for all situation comedies: The Honeymooners. Now thanks to Paramount, we get the classic ""39"" episodes from the one and only season of this comedic zenith to have and to cherish. It is television history in a digital format. It is Jackie Gleason's undeniable gift preserved in everlasting posterity.

The Honeymooners got its start as a sketch as part of The Cavalcade of Stars in 1950. Over the course of the next five years, the segments grew in popularity. Hoping to capitalize on their success, Gleason crafted a standalone half-hour sitcom around the adventures of the Kramdens and the Nortons. Debuting in 1955 and only lasting one 39-episode season, The Honeymooners was never a huge ratings triumph and Gleason returned to the variety show format. But something odd happened. Over the course of the decades in reruns and reverie, The Honeymooners' cult developed into a universal legion of devoted followers. Even with the release of ""The Lost Episodes"" in the mid-'80s (from Gleason's own private collection), fans and scholars still returned to the Classic 39 to experience comedic perfection at its most sublime.

The setup of the show is simplicity itself. Ralph Kramden is an overweight, loudmouthed, hard-working bus driver for the Gotham line in New York City. He lives in a small apartment in Brooklyn with his kind-hearted, put-upon wife Alice. They've been married for 15 years and it seems like every day of their time together has been a struggle. Money is tight, Ralph is full of get rich quick schemes that always seem to fail, and though he protests about being the boss of his home, it is Alice who saves the situation and the day most of the time. Ralph's best friend is Ed Norton, a ditzy soul who works in the New York sewers. His wife is the ex-burlesque dancer Trixie. The Nortons live on credit and cockeyed optimism, playing happy-go-lucky larks to the Kramdens dark depressives. Ed and Ralph love to bowl, shoot pool, and attend The Loyal Order of Raccoons Lodge where they are both very active members. Alice and Trixie are also gal pals, both in their domestic drudgery and husband-hampered existence. But these married couples sincerely love each other and express their emotions freely and openly.

There is no need to discuss underlying themes or the social significance of the Kramdens and the Nortons. All one has to understand is that, 50 years since it first hit CBS airwaves and traveled into the homes of America, The Honeymooners is still hysterical, laugh out loud funny in a way that most modern sitcoms wish they could to tap into. Sure, there is chauvinism and politically incorrect values in abundance running throughout The Honeymooners. But just like Archie Bunker's bigoted beliefs or Al Bundy's off-color remarks, this is a show that actually attempts to illustrate a certain class of human being (in this case, the low end, near poverty blue collar worker) and celebrate their strengths while laughing at their larger than life faults. Ralph Kramden is basically a good hearted humungous who just can't control himself. His rants are not based in anger but anguish and he truly adores his wife and friends. In this lowly bus driver from Brooklyn, Jackie Gleason managed to create the archetype for sitcom husbands for years to come. There is a little Kramden in every Fred Flintstone, Dan Conner, and Homer J. Simpson who bully and bombast their way through life. It's not difficult to see from where their humor arises. Gleason proved that size didn't matter (it didn't hurt the physical comedy, though): it was the performance and the person that counted.

While it would be foolish to try to review each of the episodes in the Classic 39 separately, a quick overview of some of the shows many highlights goes a long way to explaining the lasting appeal of this series. It's interesting to note that of the 39 episodes offered, almost 1/3 are certified classics with the other 2/3s being merely great. There is not a flat or false show in the bunch, and the titles listed below are just a sampling of the specialness to be found on the DVD set.

""TV or Not TV"": Since The Honeymooners were already a part of several previous Gleason television shows, they arrived fully formed and honed to perfection when this, the premier episode of the standalone series, made its debut. Indeed, some jokes were so ""inside"" (the whole ""to the moon, Alice"" bit) that it took the audience a while to warm up to them. Still, the sight of Norton donning his Captain Video space helmet and cheering along with his TV idol makes this episode a must see, as does Ralph preparing his ""snacks"" for an evening viewing, laying them out in true ""Homer Simpson"" style.

""The Golfer"": Art Carney's necessity and superiority as a sidekick was never underestimated by the creators of The Honeymooners, and they jumped at the chance to showcase this versatile actor. Here, Carney's golf lesson to Ralph is pure comic genius, a well-timed combination of physical humor with hilariously corny old jokes. Gleason gets a good couple of belly rolls in, but it's Norton's waggle and ""addressing"" of the ball that people remember most. Ralph's final declaration of his ""big mouth"" is also classic. Gleason could really bellow such lines.

""Better Living Through Television"": Exploring the still virginal medium was always a safe bet for the scriptwriters of early TV, and nothing sparked their satire more than commercials. Like Lucy's drunken drone through an advert for Vitameatavegamin, Ralph and Ed's handy dandy kitchen helper spot is another clear example of expert actors essaying characters under extreme circumstances. Ralph's trademark ""homina-homina-homina"" stammer is in full effect here, and Gleason's deer in the headlights looks and uncomfortable body language are just fantastic.

""Brother Ralph"": Gleason has often been called the king of the slow burn, the incremental building up of rage until his entire rotund body explodes in anger. And no episode highlights this well paced volcano better than ""Brother Ralph."" From the moment Alice's bachelor boss steps into the Kramden home and asks her ""brother"" Ralph for a date with ""the dish,"" Gleason is on maximum simmer. When he does finally explode, it is funny and touching at the same time. Like many of Ralph's outbursts, this one is wholly based on his undying love for his wife.

""The Man from Space"": Because of his size, Jackie Gleason was the ultimate sight gag. With a simple pratfall or an undulation of his ample hips, he had audiences rolling in the aisles, so adding a crazy costumed element to his human humoresque seems only natural. The best part about this showcase for Gleason's goofiness is how Norton is also ridiculed. His fancy French nobleman outfit underlines his hysterical lowbrow nature in a wonderful way, and it makes Ralph's homemade fiasco that much more comically crude.

""The $99,000 Answer"": Oddly, this is not an episode filled with huge laughs or complicated jokes. As with many of the best Honeymooner episodes, it centers on Ralph's inflated sense of self and eventual humiliation at the hands of his own ego. When people look for reasons why, overall, this show is a much-heralded classic, they tend to overlook episodes like this in favor of the gut busters filled with mega-moments of mirth. But in this, a more character driven show, we learn a great deal about the Kramdens and the Nortons, and the insights help turn them even more lovable and familiar.

""Young At Heart"": Gleason's gift for broad physical comedy, combined with the show's wistful theme of recapturing one's youth, makes this another prime example of why The Honeymooners was so successful. Even with the awkwardly unrealistic ""hep cat"" teens at the beginning, the pure comic genius in the ""Hucklebuck"" dance sequence and Gleason's mastery of roller-skating shakiness more than make up for it. And with the final speech at the end, a beautifully written paean to the melancholy march of time, we have the touching topping to this tasty treat.

""Mama Loves Mambo"": For some reason, Gleason and the gang always worked smarter with an unintentional foil for their foolishness. In this case, the bachelor/dancer next door instigates a string of stupendously funny outbursts from Ralph, each gag building on top of the other until, in a very simple speech, the stranger provides a wonderful comeuppance. But the added twist of having the boys act refined and gentlemanly leads Trixie and Alice to the realization that they like their men blue collar. It's sweet vindication for two guys who never seem to catch a break, not even in their own house.

""Young Man with a Horn"": Like ""The $99,000 Answer,"" this is a small, subtle script about people and their dreams. Ralph is not trying to ""get rich quick"" or ""pull one over on Alice."" Indeed, there is a great deal of heartfelt self-reflection in this show. All the meanness and stubborn qualities that Ralph exemplifies are washed away as a desire to better himself takes front and center. Audrey Meadows' vital contribution to the show's balance is highlighted here, as she turns Ralph's defeat into a very sweet moment of compassion and support. Her undying love keeps a maudlin show from turning defeatist.

""The Worry Wart"": If Gleason was indeed the king of the slow burn, he was also the crown prince of the irrational, anxiety filled obsession. There are more moments of table slamming, unreasonable eruptions, and frightened fat man stammering than in any four or five episodes of the series, but Gleason never overdoes it. Indeed, he uses the growing fear to even more fully flesh out his character. We learn that Ralph is basically an honest man who loves his country and wants to make sure he hasn't cheated it. Such a noble, patriotic sentiment is typical of The Honeymooners.

""Trapped"": In one of the few instances where the real world of life in New York City meshes with the fantasy land of Kramdenville, crime invades the little apartment in Brooklyn. True, the counterfeiter episode ""Funny Money"" had a couple of toughs threatening Ralph, but the main focus of that show was the spending of the cash. Here, the threat is the main theme and it's both creepy and comic. Thankfully, this is also one of the few episodes where Ralph's cowardly cringe is tossed aside and he stands up for himself. His confidence (and fighting skills) helps cut the dire tone of the circumstances.

""Unconventional Behavior"": Setting the standard for over-the-top comic set pieces, Gleason and Carney's work here as handcuffed train travelers represents the duo's camaraderie and acting command in all its glory. One view of this episode and the reasons why Kramden and Norton are considered a classic comedy pairing become crystal clear. Each works off the other perfectly and are individually given solo moments to shine. Though it seems like every sitcom before or since has done a trapped with a partner routine, somehow this talented twosome makes the old standard work.

There are many lasting legacies to be found in The Honeymooners. One can't help but look at any stocky television sitcom lead and not instantly think of Ralph Kramden and his appetite challenged physique. Whenever the wacky neighbor wanders over from next door to illuminate the proceedings with his or her own particular brand of outrageousness, Ed Norton and his cashmere vest over white T-shirt stylings can't be far behind. There is a little of Alice Kramden's temperance in every comedy mom and Trixie's perky persona can usually be located somewhere amongst the colleagues and associates. But beyond the small screen, Jackie Gleason's little show that could continues to resonate with a society brimming with unfulfilled husbands, put-upon wives and outdated social stigmas. If The Honeymooners teaches us anything, it's that beyond all the stereotyping and unfashionable fist waving, love is the true tie that binds...love and laughter. Anyone who is a fan of television comedy will be shortchanging their education if they don't immediately make this Gospel according to Ralph one of their must own DVD treasures. It's not everyday that a show like The Honeymooners comes along. As a matter of fact, it's as rare as Ralph skipping a meal, or Norton refusing one. Comedy doesn't get much better than this. How sweet it is, indeed.""

""I don't care if you burn,"" everybody's favorite fat man replies. The Honeymooners, as much a blueprint and building block for so much filmed culture to follow as W.C. Fields' ""It's a Gift"" was all those years ago, couldn't be more timeless in its essential nature. Young folk today might not be able to relate to, say, an episode about getting a new telephone, or how major a decision it was to bring a TV into the home, but if they think a little and apply it to their own modern devices (Xbox or something like that) and how their parents feel about it, they will get these stories. That the Classic 39 were recorded live shows just how far we have fallen as a culture, unable to work in so many instances without the safety net. I, like so many others, particularly in the New York area, grew up with these, even though they were made way after we were born. I remember watching Jackie Gleason say week after week on his later show, ""Miami Beach is the greatest city in the whole world!"" Then I got older and went backwards and stayed up late night after night for The Honeymooners reruns. What a world they gave us to inhabit. What characters they gave us to love. Television, even film, was a young medium (and in some ways still is, even though its acting old) and we are lucky all of this is preserved. It is that good. It is art for the common man. My only negative comment would be that there's something antiseptic about putting on a DVD, something too controlled and contrived, something too easy, as compared with making a faithful point of meeting these friends at the predetermined time each night, knowing there are people all over the place curled up on their couches laughing along at the exact same time you are. TV hurt community, as it turned out, but DVDs have hurt even the community fostered by television. That's outside a review of The Honeymooners, but that's a fact.

509311,5,6302734924,"This video set will take you ""to the moon"".  Pay no attention to the negative reviews of this Classic 39 Episodes set.  The video is perfectly acceptable for digital, and the sound is not ""inferior"".  OK, so you have to turn the sound up on the first episode ""a little""...  it's not THAT bad.  OK, so there are some white vertical stripes in the first episode... it's not THAT bad and I'm not sure I would've even noticed, nor paid attention had I not been looking for these flaws as a result of reading these reviews.  Over-all, the video is wonderful in all areas, brightness, contrast, sharpness and the audio is noise-free, no hum, wow, flutter... just clean sound.  Even in action scenes there are no noticeable ""pixel artifacts"" (those little trails folloing a moving object trying to play ""catch-up"").  Quit picking the quality to pieces.  It's unwarranted.  As of this writing the Amazon price (which includes free shipping) comes to $37.49.  This comes out to less than a buck an episode of the Classice 39.  Open the box, insert a disc and you're instantly transported back to 1955 to one of the greatest TV comedies ever to grace the airwaves.  It's amazing how side-splitting the comedy and laughter can be without the use the four letter words, nor three letter (s-e-x) situations.  Today's sitcoms could learn a thing or two from this timeless series.  Don't hesitate to pick up the Classic 39 Episodes despite the flaws mentioned in some of these reviews.  Remember, it's part of the ambience to watch The Honeymooners in all its black & white 1955-era video quality.  Someone mentioned that the ""laughter"" of the live audience was ""annoying"".  Nothing could be further from the truth.  It lends to the over-all experience.  Have you ever gone to an empty theater and watched a movie, versus a theater full of people reacting to various themes with laughter?  As I keep saying ""it lends to the ambience!""

509312,5,6302734924,"The DVD package I received from Amazon was absolutely perfect! As others have noted, the 5 DVDs are individually packaged with a photo and a brief plot outline for each episode. The photo is of an actual scene from the specific episode and always one which is central to the plot. In addition, each episode is titled (""The Sleepwalker"", ""The Golfer"", etc.)

Personally, I liked the fact that, after you have viewed an episode, the DVD brings you back to the Menu rather than beginning a new episode automatically. I think that I would have a tendency to just continue watching episode after episode and probably overdose.

My DVD package has the 39 episodes in chronological order(from 1-39) with episodes 1-8 on DVD #1, 9-16 on DVD #2, etc. The 5th DVD has episodes 33-39 and also has Special Features. The Special Features(which I have not viewed yet) consists of two items: 1) The Honeymooners Anniversary Special, and 2) Original series opening and closings not seen since 1956. As I have stated, I have not seen the Special Features yet, so I do not know what #2 is but just in case you're wondering: each one of the 39 episodes on this DVD set DOES begin with the little musical intro and the announcer's voice that fans are so used to hearing before the start of the show.

In all honesty, I don't think I would change anything at all about this DVD set. For me, it is perfect! As I have said to my wife and 6 yr. old daughter, I don't think I would want Ralph Kramden as a neighbor what with all the yelling he does, but it sure does amuse me watching it on a TV show!

509314,5,6302734924,"That's what they called Jackie, and that's what we could call this show.

I'm a big fan of many of the old sitcoms, from I Love Lucy and Dick Van Dyke through Mary Tyler Moore, Taxi and others. But this one is the big daddy of them all. And with a collection like this, not only can you see any or all of the shows, you can do all kinds of fun stuff. Like, you can go through the episodes and see how many times you can find those two guys who usually play the bit roles, Frank Marth (the bigger guy) and George Petrie (the smaller guy). (It would have been kind of neat if they had been the two guys in the pool hall, Harvey and George, but what the hey, the two guys that they got were perfect, weren't they?) Or,  with the help of one of those Honeymooners books or just some online searching, you can look for the ""goofs,"" some of which got turned into really funny moments  --  which to me is one of the most impressive marks of the greatness of Jackie Gleason and the others.

Regarding the wonderment about why the available versions of the older (""lost"") episodes are technically poorer,  my impression is they don't exist any better  --  we've never seen any better versions on TV, have we? Anyway, while those ""lost"" episodes are wonderful treasures (fortunately no longer ""buried"" treasures), they are somewhat disappointing; compared to these great ""39,"" they're sort of just a bunch of people yelling at each other.

An aspect of the Honeymooners that was extra special to me was that it was one of the best things that my dad and I shared. And I wouldn't be surprised if it's been like that for many other people too, because this was a show that cut across generations in a way that few other things do.",1102291200,6,1718,4.34375

The sign of enduring quality is whether one can watch a given episode more than once and not tire of it. I can easily handle seeing each episode every few weeks. Jackie Gleason was the king of comedy. We never cease to marvel at the myriad of facial expressions of which he was capable. The viewer is able to anticipate Ralph's every mood before he utters a word -- the hallmark of a great actor.",1101254400,9,663,4.1875

509317,4,6302734924,"Others have said the same thing, so this review will be short. Of course, the shows are great. Nuf sed about them.

The packaging is very nice also. I like the design, and I like the slim-line DVD holders better than the usuall ""fat"" ones you get. They're all you need and take up less space.

My main beef about the execution is that you can only watch one episode at a time! Unless I'm doing something wrong, there is no ""Play All"" on the menu. You watch one episode and when it ends, it goes back to the menu, not to the next episode. This sounds like a minor inconvenience, but the whole point of the DVD format is to avoid these minor inconveniences.

I don't notice the poor video quality some others have commented on, except in the very first episode (""TV or Not TV"", which happens to be one of the two best episodes in the whole set) where the last 5-10 minutes looks like a lousy kinescope. I don't know if it's because that's the quality of the source material and it's the best that exists, but I don't think that can be so because I've seen that episode a hundred (or thousand) times over the years and never noticed this before. It seems they must have just used a poorer quality print of that show to make this DVD, and they should have been able to do better.

By all means buy the set if you're a Honeymooners fan, but be aware that it could have been done better.",1094428800,20,1381,4.21969696969697

Great quality-- some reviewers complained a bit about the audio on the first episode, which I agree is a little bit weak, but I consider the problem relatively minor. Otherwise the transfers are crisp, menus are nice, packaging is compact-- I just wish the ""lost episodes"" sets were given this kind of treatment.

 Now, when are they going to start releasing the entirety of the Jackie Gleason Show? Anxiously awaiting that one-- Poor Soul, Reginald Van Gleason, Joe the Bartender, etc... And Away We Go....

I've avoided buying the overpriced ""Lost"" episodes for years because of the horrible asthetics and little thought given to the presentation and packaging,..not to mention the bloated price point.

Excellent presentation, packaging, and artwork (although I would have preferred something a bit more innovative in the box itself, I can't argue with the outstanding price).

There are some wonderful extras such as a ""35th Anniversary Special"" hosted by the lovely Audrey Meadows - shot on a replica of the set - with interviews including Joyce Randolph and Art Carney.  This is a bit shorter than I expected but still wonderful.
You'll also get to hear the original opening and closing credits with a much different voice than you're used to.  There is also a car commercial done by none other than Jackie Gleason himself.
The episodes are crisp and clear and best of all...there are no commercials!  The episode order is not the same as their original air dates.  Instead they have grouped them according to Ralph's ""Schemes"" but this hardly matters.  It's still an absolute MUST HAVE for anyone who loves this show.
There are no behind the scenes or directors cut or extra's like on most DVD's but here, it's not necessary.  These true comedy gems still stand alone after almost 50 years since their debut.  To quote Jackie when he was asked to explain the success of ""The Honeymooners"":  ""They're Funny!""

509332,5,6302734924,"Reams have been written about The Honeymooners, and unlike many ""classics"" that lose their luster with time, The Honeymooners is as good in 2004 as it was 50 years ago. This is the program that set the formula for scores of sitcoms to come, but despite years they had to improve on the groundwork laid here, few shows have done better.
Somehow, without implied profanity, sexual innuendo, or toeing the line of good taste, Jackie Gleason and the gang still manage to offer more laugh out loud moments than anything on TV today. Has there ever been a television show with so many wonderful catchphrases? So many memorable moments? When this show is firing on all cylinders, few sitcoms can even approach it.
But saying this is preaching to the choir, because if you're browsing for this item you're probably already a fan. So how is the set? Well, it's difficult to argue with just over $1 an episode for all 39 of the core Honeymooners episodes. Hours upon hours of hilarity for this price is a bargain by any measure. That alone should be enough to sell most potential buyers.
The set itself is packaged nice, with each disc in its own case, all set in a cardboard slipcase. Each disc's episodes are clearly marked with a brief summary and a key still from the show, so searching for that favorite moment should be easy. The quality of the discs are good enough, with a fairly crisp picture (given the age of the original source), sound that's solid (though mixed a bit low in some cases), and some of the cleanest menus you'll ever see. Nothing fancy, just pure Honeymooners laughs.
No commentaries and only one extra of note would be a flaw for some sets, but television DVD sets rarely have noteworthy extras, and once again the idea that you can snare these 39 episodes for just $45 or so is remarkable, so the absence of extensive extras is not glaring.
There is no question at all: This is a MUST BUY for Honeymooners fans, and an affordable way to see some of the best moments in television history for TV buffs.",1073779200,2,2020,4.552197802197802
509333,5,6302734924,"It's about time we got a DVD set of the Classic 39 episodes of the Honeymooners -- 39 of the funniest half-hours in television history. By now everybody knows the formula -- Ralph Kramden is the bumbling bus driver whose get-rick-quick schemes never pan out, Alice, his wife, is one sharp cookie and really too good for him, Ed Norton is his good-hearted but dimwitted pal and Trixie is Ed's doting bride. After almost half a century, though, these episodes still ring true, still tug at your heart. You know that for all his bluster and bravado, Ralph is a sweet man inside. You know that every foolish thing he ever does is because he honestly loves Alice and wants to give her a better life, and you know that Alice puts up with the big lug because she knows that too. The Honeymooners is a love story at its heart, and it's one of the greatest ever to make it on television.
This set contains the 39 ""Classic"" episodes (the standalone half-hours that stood out from the literally hundreds of ""Honeymooners"" sketches done as part of ""The Jackie Gleason Show""). The shows are as clean as they ever were, and contain many of the greatest moments: Norton ""addressing"" his golf ball, Ralph's appearance on ""The $99,000 Answer"", the night out at the roller rink -- hysterical stuff. There are touching moments too, though: Alice comforting Ralph when he fails to win the Raccoon of the Year award, virtually every time he's forced to apologize to her for some boneheaded scheme... It's all golden material.
This DVD also contains the original opening and closings of the show (the opening is virtually identical, but both opening and closing had Buick commercials added) and a nice (if short) ""Honeymooners 35th Anniversary Special"" hosted by Audrey Meadows and featuring interviews with all four of the main cast members.

Some bad reviews complained about the series not being remastered, but I think they look great. In response to the first episode having bad quality, it really isn't that bad--and believe me, I am a tough critic. The series looks the best it ever has and they sounds great; you never saw the Honeymooners like this!
I love the slim casings for each DVD and inside the cover sleeves is the name of each episode on the the disc, the original airdate, and a brief description of the episodes. And yes...the episodes are in chronilogical order based on the airdate.
There are so many TV series box sets that don't put special features that you auctually want to see; instead, most of them include garbage such as photos and script material. This box set includes the Honeymooners Anniversary special hosted by Audrey Meadows (Alice) and it warm, funny, and entertaining--just like the series was and still is.
My only complaint is that there is no ""Play All"" feature, but this is not a major issue for me. Most box sets don't have this feature (except for the I Love Lucy DVDs) anyway.

Now I will add my name to the long list of opinions.
First, most of the reviews differed on quality. Many claimed to be disappointed with the sound and picture quality of the various episodes. My thought here is that the DVD's are consistent with the quality of the TV version. Granted, no remastered or enhanced version here, but still every bit as funny to watch and more so to own.
Secondly, I felt compelled to write this review as I almost passed on purchasing them for my fathers Birthday due to the amount of negative quality reviews. I'm so glad I didn't allow these reveiws to influence me. I am also thankful for the few who brought out the obvious and that being ""these episodes were shot in the 50's. End result, I've purchased two more sets for family members for X-mas. My father and I laughed so hard that my side began to hurt and he can't stop watching them.
Bottom line: The content is what you're purchasing. You are getting a moment in time that was captured with the best that technology had to offer in the 50's. As for quality, it's the same as what you've watch on cable, TV, etc. No more and certainly, no less. You can still hear people coughing and laughing in the audience as the episodes were all shot live - like a play. This made them even more fun to watch. At times, the audience members couldn't stop laughing which made me laugh even more.

However, I can comment on its packaging and set up.  All 39 black and white episodes are included in this box set.  It incorporates five discs in excellently designed slim plastic covered sleeves so storage will not be a problem.  The only thing that is missing is the ability to play all episodes on one disc consistently.  Each time an episode ends the DVD reverts back to the main menu screen.

And crystal clear!
Hey, I just had to go to my favorites first! Need I even mention ""The Golfer"" or the immortal ""Chef of the Future"" ....to wit, ""Can it core 'a' apple?"" and of course, ""THAT was Swanee River...? ""
Anyway, you just can't beat the exceptional price for 39 episodes of the so-termed classics and classics are what they are! Nostalgia a la mode since I can recall seeing the originals, so to speak, when they first appeared on TV back in the 50's! But then, I also recall that marvelous effect of the first 'color' television sets! Ouch! On the other hand, I have no bones about the classic [read: old] B&W shows and surely ""The Honeymooners"" speaks for itself as to great humor and just the right mix of pathos when old Ralph had his down moments and typically followed by the old hand gesture(s) and attempted explanations to Alice while Alice sat in the chair and waited for yet another 'explanation' of Ralph's misadventures. What, you don't recall when Ralph finally decided to pay the 15% rent increase and says to Alice, ""You know .. that I know .. that you know...how easily you get virus!"" What's that? Right! Pins and needles...needles and pins... .""
Grab it! A truly exceptional value for a DVD set and 39 episodes of great TV nostalgia.

That said, Paramount/CBS could have done better. What other reviewers have pointed out about the pilot episode, ""TV or Not TV,"" is true: the audio quality is poor (it sounds like you're listening to the episode underwater) and the picture is scratchy. The other episodes in the collection--at least those I've viewed thus far--are much better, with sound clear enough to hear audience members shift in their seats (when they're not doubled over laughing, of course) and the creaking of the stage floorboards as a actor walks into scene, and crisp black and white film quality. It would have been nice if they'd cleaned up the pilot digitally, but I guess we should be happy that any of these episodes still exist at all, given how many programs from that era are lost forever.
The lack of extras is also noticable. I'm unclear as to why the Anniversary Special has been edited down by more than half--while what's left is still interesting, why not just include the whole special? And the original opening and closing are nice to see, but...that's all you get. No commentary. No freshly produced documentary. No inclusion of other ""Honeymooners"" material (the reunion special from the '70s, maybe?). Nada.

509363,4,6302734924,"Since Amazon ties together formats for shows and movie reviews, I can't do a separate review for the new blu ray set. My review for the DVD set WAAAAY back in 2003 was like this:

""The Honeymooners is as great as ever but Paramount is starting to look like a moxe.

It have been obvious to them when they did the authoring that the compression to get 8 of these shows on a dual layer DVD was too much.

Many DVD sets have 8-25 minute shows per dual layer disc and sometimes it works (if the show mainly consists of scenes of people talking with little to no camera movement, like M*A*S*H).

With, ""The Honeymooners"" you have Jackie Gleason constantly gesticulating and the camera is usually following him around. Nothing settles down for long in those classic 39 episodes.

Add to that that this is a black and white show. In black and white shows, your eyes are drawn to texture and detail that color sometimes hide.

What it all adds up to is that because the overall memory of the DVD is spread too thin to deal with all the movement. So, what happens is that there are frequent ""compression artifacts"".

This shows up on TV as little glitches like wall texture that doesn't quite keep pace with the rest of the picture. Clothing textures that shift and/or disappear when a character moves. It doesn't happen all the time, but it happens enough to be distracting and to cut into the quality of the presentation.

These are, in fact, new digital transfers, recently done. When there is little movement in the scene, you can see the crispness and the sharpness ones expects from a modern transfer.

But when there is movement going on, the picture frequently loses detail due to lower than needed bit rate.
These problems are especially visible on higher end set ups. My system is far from ""state of the art"" but does utilize a better than average TV with a high end component connection which gives better detail.

On my other 2 older TV's with older style composite (RCA) connection that I use in other areas the DVD's look much better (due to the setup showing less of the DVD's detail). But even if you have the type of setup that will not expose these flaws, someday you probably will and Paramount should've been a little more mindful about preserving these shows on this format for posterity.

The answer, of course, was to make spread the 39 episodes out on six or seven discs instead of five but that would bump up production and final retail cost (but I would've paid it).

The recent release of the first 2 seasons of The Dick Van Dyke show usually have 6 (occasionally 7) episodes per dual layer disc. For the most part, the shows look stellar.

If only the same consideration was given The Honeymooners.

This set is recommended because of the sheer quality of the shows and the talent of Gleason and Carney (may they both rest in peace, Art died yesterday) but if you have a high end set up to watch these on, you will be disappointed in the quality because of too much compression.""

Since then, of course we adopted HDTV and blu ray players. Probably due to the fact that the DVD player I once had was a really early one many of the texture shifting anomalies I noticed way back when on the DVDs are less noticeable now on modern players with better image and compression processing. There is still the smoothness and detail loss that came from the use of DNR but the DVD's fare much better than I remember initially. Something left unmentioned is the somewhat muffled nature of the audio of ""TV Or Not TV"" though.

But enough about the DVD, let's talk blu ray which blows the DVD's to the moon.

We have consistently excellent high definition transfers which show enough natural film grain to let you know you are looking at film. There are a few specks here and there but nothing distracting. And the detail is fabulous!

The new details is so good you can notice how much they used ""painted flats"" for the sets. You can see the brick walls of outdoor scenes are painted flats. The basement with the pipes that Ralph gets caught in in Dial J For Janitor have painted flat brick walls and the pipes are smooth with joint details painted on the bends. Even on DVD this sort of thing was not as noticeable, at least to me.

Some would suggest that these shows were not meant to be seen in such high detail and they would be right. Still, I think the extra detail does improve the experience.

Audio is perfectly fine, with the muffled audio on ""TV Or Not TV"" is a thing of the past, left to the DVD's.

Many of the extras from the DVD set are carried over to the blu ray. There are more sponsor openings and closings and you can actually choose to watch them in the episodes themselves instead of it being ""on the side"" on DVD. On the first disc, there are two promos. I think they are 70's era syndication promos and are similar to the couple of syndication promos shown on the Twilight Zone blu ray set. Disc 2 has a ""Best Buick Yet"" presentation which is The Honeymooners' cast pitch to Buick Automobiles (the show's sponsor). It is audio with stills. There is the 60 Minutes show that profiles Jackie Gleason on disc 3, plus even outtakes from that show! Disc 5 has the most extras, beginning with a rare piece for Honeymooners fans. The 1966 musical ""Adoption"" Honeymooners on Jackie Gleason's American Scene Magazine. It is on videotape and looks nice and clear (even if it is not HD)and is a welcome addition. Also there is the 35'th and 50'th anniversary shows, both are fine. And a ""Person to Person"" segment featuring Jackie Gleason.

Yes, an overall wonderful package where the shows have never looked better. The cover art is kind of stilted and uninspired but that does not detract from the package.

So why 4 stars instead of 5?

Well, just like the DVD set of over 10 years ago, the blu ray set lacks a ""play all"" feature for the episodes. It was sort of understandable on the DVD set when the paradigm of DVD on TV sets were not as figured out. But now, with DVD and blu ray sets almost always having a ""play all"" function, it is mystifying why this one does not.

And this is one of those shows I'd love to have on while I do work. But not if I have to manually switch over to the next episode every half hour. Yes, the of a ""play all"" feature is a distinct omission and disappointment.",1068508800,5,6319,4.440795159896283

This show came out way before the Flintstones and King of Queens. Yes TV used to be black and white and not everyone in America had one. To colorize would take away from what the show was.

509401,5,6302734924,"The reason for owning The Honeymooners: Ralph and Norton handcuffed together because of a failed magic trick of Norton's(""boomf!""). The two are on a train heading in opposite direction of the train their wives are on - they think the wives are on the wrong train. The boys try to settle in for the night - handcuffed. Norton takes out a cigarette:
  Norton: Ralph, mind if I smoke?
  Ralph: I don't care if you burn.
I must have seen this particular ep a million times since I was a kid and it has NEVER failed to make laugh till I cried.
So run, don't walk and order your copy of the the greatest show on earth. It will keep you laughing for years to come. I'm hysterical now remembering this show.",1067644800,,699,4.312977099236641
509402,5,6302734924,"Having been born 24 years after the initial showing of the Honeymooners, I might not be the target audience that came to mind when this DVD collection was assembled. Funny is funny, however, and these ""Classic 39"" episodes of the Honeymooners are the funniest half hours ever shown on television and the greatest situation comedy of all time.
You just don't see shows like this now. Nothing is this well acted or this well written. And nothing is just this funny. This is a husband and wife struggling to get by and they look like it, too. This ""Friends"" where the cast lives like millionaires. This isn't ""Fraiser"" where they work in some high-profile industry. Ralph drives a bus and Norton works in the sewer (an ""underground engineer."") The Kramdens and Norton are real people and real neighbors.
What made the show work so well was the actors. Jackie Gleason owns the material. He doesn't even have to say a word to provide a hilarious moment. Just watch him stew, his face contort while listening to his mother-in-law just prior to his famous blabbermouth rant.
Audrey Meadows is perfect. When Gleason sets 'em up, Meadows' Alice knocks 'em down like no one else. Ralph: ""The bills will get bigger & bigger, and I'll get less to eat. Then you know what I'll look like?"" Alice: ""Yeah, a human being."" Episode after episode, she deadpans cut down and cut down with deadly accuracy.
Art Carney's Norton should have his own statue in Washington DC. A terrific actor playing the part perfectly. Like Meadows, Carney has an uncanny chemistry with Gleason. You really can feel the history between the two characters, as if they've been best friends for long enough to be close friends and long enough to get on each others nerves all the time.
Likewise, you get the same feeling between Ralph and Alice as well as Norton and Trixie, who -- played by Joyce Randolph -- is the perfect match for screwball Norton.
And of course, there is every else that made the show so great. Bert Weedemeyer, Mr. Marshall, the Friendly Raccoons and Haaaaaarrrrrvy.
Every episode has one belly laugh moment and at least a half dozen great lines. I'm buying two sets. One for myself and one for my - Brooklyn born and raised - dad for Christmas.",1061942400,117,2225,4.69309462915601
509416,5,6302734924,"Millions may love Lucy - buy for me, nothing compares to the Honeymooners' classic 39 episodes.
Although firmly set in the 50's it is truly timeless, and younger people who refuse to watch anything in black and white are losing the most side-splitting tv comedy ever filmed.  Witness Ralph doing a slow burn and threatening Alice to send her ""to the moon!"" or calling his mother-in-law a ""blabbermouth"" - incidentally one of the few times he's right about anything.  Prepare for Alice's arched eyebrows and folded arms as she waits out Ralph's tirades.  Above all, perhaps, marvel at Art Carney's sleepwalk prone, Captain Video loving Norton - TV's greatest best friend in more than one sense - as he teaches Ralph the Hucklebuck and ""addresses"" a golfball.
Tying it all together is the fact that, although they have feet of clay and yell at eachother as loved ones sometimes do, they all really love and need eachother at the end of the day.  There is perhaps no summary better than Ralph's famous complement to Alice - ""Baby, you're the greatest!""",1020297600,4,1049,4.811111111111111

This collection of the ""Classic 39"" Honeymooners is something every Gleason/Meadows/Carney fan should own. All the shows you remember and love, with no commercials, to boot.

Gleason's Kramden is as hilaious as ever, as is  Carney's Norton.  Audrey Meadows as Alice and Joyce Randolph as Trixie are,  in my opinion, the best two actresses ever to play the part.  They both  exhibit GREAT talent and hilarity!  You can watch this timeless classic  with catchphrases like ""Bang!  Zoom!"", ""One of these days,  Alice..."" and ""Do you wanna go to the moon!
