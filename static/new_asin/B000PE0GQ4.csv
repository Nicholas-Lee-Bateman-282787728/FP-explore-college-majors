2816284,1,B000PE0GQ4,"I completely agree with the other reviewer. DON'T BUY THIS!!!!. They have completely butchered these shows. They've resold this material, more than once, and in many different forms. Just the songs, just the comedy etc. It's about time they release these shows in a way that the fans are not getting cheated.  When will they ever do it right and put out ALL the shows UNCUT?
This is beyond greed. This is a complete ripoff.",1185667200,20,423,4.64
2816285,1,B000PE0GQ4,"Sorry folks, but they did it again.  They placed the title of the DVD collection at the not-low-enough right of the frame, where it stays constantly visible throughout the programs; AND they cut out every single one of the Dean Martin songs as well as other parts of the show, INCLUDING some of the Martin & Lewis scenes!! For instance, on CD4, Show #1, the ""Chapters"" listing has a routine called ""Jerry's Everywhere!"", but this skit is nowhere to be found anywhere in the collection, and so you miss one of the funniest bits they ever did.

Don't buy this set.

Hey producers, you out there?  Anybody listening?  Give us the uncut versions with the option to skip the main titles and the commercials.  No, I don't want to watch every show all the way through, but let ME CHOOSE what I want to watch or not watch.",1185580800,27,814,4.466216216216216

Classic Jerry though!!!!",1411948800,,125,6.0
8190656,5,B000PE0GQ4,"I am a fan of comedy. I love to laugh. I think it is very special to be able to go back in time and see what is now considered classic comedy come alive. I wish we could go back further, to Vaudeville, or earlier, and witness what went down.
Some sketches run long, you can always fast foreword. They cut  Dean's solo songs out but there is plenty of his singing
while Jerry drives him crazy! If you are a fan of comedy I think this would be a fine addition to add to your collection.

8190657,4,B000PE0GQ4,"I read the previous reviews and went ahead and bought this anyway. What a GREAT buy. Yes, they did cut out all of Dean's solos..SOLOs ONLY. Songs sung w Jerry was kept in. I think this is due to whomever holds the copyright to his songs. This should NOT deter you from buying this set. It was hours of some of the funniest skits they ever did. PLUS...the bonus. The funniest oldie commercials...all kept in.

Yes, the logo is there...lower right...but on my set it was just a light shadow...I didn't even notice it till one reviewer pointed that out. And yes, the quality is not  the finest...but geez guys..these shows are over 60 years old, made for black and white tv...on film....converted to vhs then to dvd. Give me a break. It is no worse than watching the reruns on ME TV or Retro TV! A lot of these can be seen free on Prime, which I have, but I wanted to dvds and I am not sorry. I did get a set used...so even saved a few more dollars.

If your a fan, this is the best set around!",1393804800,,991,4.178010471204188
8190658,4,B000PE0GQ4,I almost didn't buy this set from all the griping about the logo left on screen...I thought it blocked viewing but was plesantly suprised it isn't even noticeable.  I loved the fact that this set was complete and in chronological order.  The only thing I didn't care for was they cut most of the musical numbers out but left the commercials in...I don't really care about Dean's songs but most people really do and I REALLY don't care to watch 60 yr old commercials in place of his songs.  That being said I think it is a wonderful set to have and am very happy I bought it,1332979200,,573,4.287037037037037
8190659,4,B000PE0GQ4,"I've read the other reviews about this 10 DVD set of The Best of The Colgate Comedy Hour with Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis from Passport Video. Most of the criticisms are valid, but several reviewers have missed the main point: Yes, this set could have been produced better, but even with its flaws it is one of the best comedy box sets on the market. This set is incredibly entertaining, and will give you 20 hours of the wackiest and most inventive comedy ever performed -- 10 discs worth at a very reasonable price.

First I'll address the flaws. The worst of them is that Dean's solo song numbers were cut out, as were many guest spots and dance routines. I can't figure out why for the life of me. I don't think it would have taken many more discs to cover the complete shows. Covering the complete shows should have only added a small amount to the price, and the higher price would have been well worth it. This is a tragic missed opportunity to give us a complete record of comedy history. The only other flaw worth mentioning is the logo that appears in the lower right hand corner.  But this was shaded so lightly that it was hardly noticeable unless the scene background was dark. In fact, I only realized it was there on the last few discs. This flaw is so minor that it should not deter anyone from making a purchase.

Now for the good qualities of the set: This is a nicely packaged set. It comes in an overall slip case that holds the 5 slim line plastic DVD cases, each DVD case holding 2 DVDs. Given the age of these recordings, the print and sound quality are surprisingly good. This is not one of those sets that contain prints that are in such bad condition, a la Alpha Video, that they are barely watchable, and you can hardly enjoy them. This is a set of mostly very good quality prints. Another nice feature is that the shows are presented in chronological order. All commercials are included, and many of these early TV commercials are so unique and different from today's ads that they are almost as entertaining as the shows. I'm glad that Passport at least had the good judgment not to cut them out. Finally, the special features on the last disc are a welcome addition. They include a documentary on the comedy duo, a documentary on Dean Martin, and a composite of movie trailers from the duo's movies and all of Jerry Lewis's solo movies.

In watching this set you will learn that the Colgate Comedy Hour was hosted by some wonderful entertainers besides Martin and Lewis. They include Abbott and Costello, Jimmy Durante, Bob Hope, Eddie Cantor and Donald O'Connor.  This is a largely un-mined treasure trove!  I wish someone would release all of these shows in their entirety and in complete sets.  But for now, this Martin and Lewis set has to be about the best available from that era. It is worth much more than some of the bargain prices I've seen it selling for. If you buy it you will be in for a treat. You'll be able to watch 20 hours of classic comedy at an amazing level of quality and genius that is totally missing from today's so-called comedians.",1278028800,6,3089,4.456637168141593
8190660,3,B000PE0GQ4,"Martin & Lewis in every endeavor, but most importantly in their Colgate shows, were the epitome of ""The Golden Age of Television."" Never will you see two men equally do all they can to make their audience laugh without completely humiliating themselves. Their movies would never completely show case the comedic talents of Dean Martin, but the show always would! Which leads me to the only flaw I found with this DVD set; you can see the two men in all their comedic glory, but you can barely hear Dean sing anything. Yes, all of Dean Martin's solo spots behind the microphone doing what he does best is extracted from every episode. So, laugh your bum off, but for newcomers you will only bare witness to half of the history.",1213574400,2,726,4.592307692307692
8190661,1,B000PE0GQ4,"All you have to do is divide the stated 999 minutes in to the 28 shows that the description states, and you have 28 36 minute shows.  The original shows were 60 minutes long, including commercials.  BACK THEN THERE WERE NO MORE THAT 5-6 MINUTES OF COMMERCIALS IN EACH SHOW, OFTEN INCORPORATED IN TO THE SHOW.  THESE ARE CUT UP SHOWS.",1212019200,,333,4.426229508196721
