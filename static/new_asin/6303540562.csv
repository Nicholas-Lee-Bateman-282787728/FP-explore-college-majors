7850046,4,6303540562,"""Eye of the Beholder"" is the sixth and (so far) final story in the direct-to-video Stranger series.  It features Colin Baker, from the television series Doctor Who, as Soloman, with David Troughton and John Wadmore reprising their roles as Egan and Saul, and featuring Geoffrey Beevers as research scientist Hunter.
Soloman, Egan, and Saul are Preceptors, creatures from the Dimensional Web who have taken physical form to carry out acts of indiscriminate terrorism in this Universe. Soloman has seen the error of his ways. Egan, however, believes Soloman has reformed only as a result of indoctrination by their enemies, the Protectorate.
At the end of the previous Stranger story, Breach of the Peace, Egan and Saul forced Soloman to give up his peaceful life on Earth and re-enter the Dimensional Web. But no sooner have they left than they find themselves back on Earth. They have been wrenched out of the Web by an unknown force which has set in motion a catastrophic chain of events...
If you enjoy low-budget British television SF, there's a lot to recommend in this well-written adventure.  This is my favorite in the Stranger series, with the possible exception of ""The Terror Game"".  Doctor Who fans expecting a program suitable for children should be aware that this video contains violence and profanity (but no more than you might find on a typical BBC series).  Also, you'll need to have ""Eye of the Beholder"" volume 2 handy (sold separately) after viewing this tape, volume 1 does not stand on its own at all.
After the story reaches its cliffhanger (at about 45 minutes), stay tuned for a short feature called ""Stranger Than Fiction"", a behind-the-scenes look at the making of these videos.",1054166400,,1706,4.954545454545454
