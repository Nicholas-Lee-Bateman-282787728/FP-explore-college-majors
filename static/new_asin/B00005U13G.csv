7954087,4,B00005U13G,I was looking for kickboxer starring Van Damme when I found this one. Van Damme doesnt star in this film. This is a much older movie with different actors and the plot of this film pretty much involves two rival gangs who go at it the majority of the film but there are some fight scenes which are good. When purchasing this film the image shown is the movie so if you are looking for the kickboxer starring van damme this isn't it. Look at image and actors before purchasing.,1357689600,,476,4.3
7954088,2,B00005U13G,Everything was fine with the order. The seller was prompt and the DVD was in perfect condition. I was looking for Kickboxer with JCVD and was in too much of a hurry to look past the glared picture to see that it was not in fact the movie I wanted. This movie looks like Eric Stoltz in a martial arts flick! I'll be sure to get good and drunk with a bunch of friends before we watch it so it'll be as awesome as I wish it were.,1342656000,,426,3.852272727272727
7954089,1,B00005U13G,when i ordered this movie i thought it was the movie with jean claude van damme but instead the seller sent me a movie called kick boxer with actors that are unknowned to me.....very disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1266451200,,212,5.085714285714285
7954090,5,B00005U13G,THIS IS NOT A VAN DAMME MOVIE! CHECK ASIN OR UPC.This movie is a martial art film about the world of Illegal KickBoxing. EDEN Entertainment. Each fighter is a lethal weapon.,1104451200,,173,4.612903225806452
