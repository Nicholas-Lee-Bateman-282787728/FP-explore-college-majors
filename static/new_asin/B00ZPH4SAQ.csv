7284629,5,B00ZPH4SAQ,"Wonderful - with the exception of Colton and his buddies, so many heartfelt issues that were dealt with in such a seamless way.  The movie focused on the present rather than getting into so many of the characters' pasts - which is a lesson in itself - highlighted in the end by something the pastor stated.

The abuse of drinking was tough to watch, but the scenes concerning the daughter and her boyfriend were not family friendly, but of course you probably already started watching this with your kids before you noticed this.  David DeSanctis was awesome, and was so believable as the motivating force for good!  Unlike the regular Christian movie that the Babylon Bee writes about, this was a gem.  You'll love it.

7284653,3,B00ZPH4SAQ,"(I am writing as a Christian for those looking for a Christian movie). This movie does great character building work, but fluffs the ending. A compelling storyline with good acting is built throughout the movie, but then an opportunity for a true Gospel finish is completely missed. Instead it dissolves into feel-good, sub-Christian banalities that squander that powerful emotional connection built up throughout the movie. I was stunned at how poor the ending was - a waste of a very good movie up until that point.",1503705600,,517,5.023255813953488

7284666,5,B00ZPH4SAQ,"This is a heart-warming family movie that highlights a Downs Syndrome protagonist.  This sensitive portrayal of a grocery stocker with an observable, permanent health-related issue should cause anyone who sees the movie to look inside and question how he/she treats those who appear different from oneself.  The movie is quite good, I have already watched it twice, and I'm confident that I will watch it many more times because it elucidates the strength of the human spirit and the highlights the respect everyone should receive despite his or her differences from others.",1501459200,,574,5.228260869565218

7284671,5,B00ZPH4SAQ,"We followed this movie through the very end. Yes, it is not a children's movie, but it Is a movie regarding family and fellowship...not all Christian movies should be squeaky clean, and yes, perhaps Alert should have been mentioned re the more adult topics. However, the problems were real problems that many real church-going/ Christian families have had to deal with, which makes us human and seeking guidance. This movie should inspire all of us dealing with, or knowing folks who are striving with the help of our Lord.",1500681600,,523,4.887640449438202

7284680,4,B00ZPH4SAQ,"There aren't a lot of faith-based films that don't wind up preaching. The only preaching in this film is against the R word, which is relevant and appreciated. In addition to dealing with the outdated prejudices against those with developmental disabilities, it reveals the wreckage that alcoholism causes as well as shining a light on the hope of recovery. It also raises the question of what love really is, whether in family, dating relationships, or friendships. The only reason I can't give this movie 5 stars is the overuse of calling Produce ""Kid"". He's an adult and just like getting rid of more derogatory words, this one also should be used with caution. Overall, a great film about things that actually matter.",1498953600,,721,4.918032786885246

I love this movie!!! Not only does it give me hope but I hope it gives the love of my life back the hope he needs to point him in the right direction to give back to others and to change his life. Sometimes, all we need is a little inspiration, a nudge in the right direction; I have suggested that he rent this movie and I hope he can pull strength from it to be the man I've always known he could be.",1497830400,,561,3.9298245614035086

7284689,5,B00ZPH4SAQ,"One of the good ones, as far as family and faith films.  Nothing messed up about the name ""Produce"", I think he took his job seriously. I love it when people call me ""Scribe"".  Did a great job with dialogue and keeping the plot in motion even when it was difficult at times, due to the large job of laying the ground work.  Great character work, beautiful story of redemption.  Skirted the difficult question of prayer and ""Why?""  Played it a little safe, but admitted, ""IDK"".  I give ""Two Thumbs Up"" and thank you for following your dream so we could share the vision with you.",1497571200,,578,4.40566037735849

A heartwarming story about a former pro baseball player who had lost his faith and was beginning to lose himself when he begins to interact with Produce, a man who works at his local grocery store. Produce, in my opinion, is the star of this movie. Breaking stereotypes that people with disabilities are not as smart or able to live life like quote unquote normal people.  Produce proved he was smart, athletic, loving, compassionate, level-headed and had a heart of gold. I found myself laughing, crying and a renewed sense of faith after watching this film. I highly recommend it!",1496620800,,658,4.814159292035399
7284696,5,B00ZPH4SAQ,I really love this movie about a alcoholic man who befriends a very sweet Down's Syndrome boy who works in a supermarket. It's a great Christian story.,1496534400,,151,4.62962962962963
7284697,5,B00ZPH4SAQ,"As we all know most films are meant as entertainment, but this one is the total opposite. It's meant as a life lesson to all of us that everyone and everything in the world equally matters. This is something that deeply resonates with me as a Millennial whose core values include: authenticity, respect, responsibility, harmony, and courage. I know you might be hesitant about watching this because it has zero action sequences and or suspenseful intrigue, but this isn't that type of movie and you'll be a lot wiser after contemplating on your place/purpose in life after viewing it. Hopefully you'll agree with me about this film after you watch it!",1496361600,,651,4.873873873873874

7284700,1,B00ZPH4SAQ,This is not a Christian movie that you would want to watch with your kids.  Definitely got sucked in by the reviews and the trailer.

7284711,5,B00ZPH4SAQ,"This is a story of true character development, unexpected events, joy, laughter, and some sadness. The Down Syndrome character , Produce, is authentic and doesn't appear to be acting at all. I had to check several times to see if this was based upon true events which included him. This is his first movie and he just happened to be in the town the movie was filming. The counter main character is outstanding as a former pro-baseball player living off his past successes and failures. His alcoholism and dysfunctional relationships are impacted and impact his life and the life of Produce. To the very end one can not predict how it will end. Enjoy the characters and don't miss the credits which are as much fun as the movie.",1494288000,,727,4.6434108527131785

7284715,1,B00ZPH4SAQ,"We really hated this movie.  It is billed as a ""Christian"" movie, but the message of salvation is muted and terribly obfuscated by the movie's attempt to appeal to a worldly audience.  There was gratuitous profanity and violence in it, which for a work of Christian fiction should not be necessary.  We also felt that the treatment of the character ""Produce"" objectified people with disabilities; case in point being that he is only ever referred to in the movie by a nickname rather than his real name.  When we got to the end of the movie, we couldn't believe that the creator of the movie wasted a perfectly good chance to share the hope of Christ's love offered in the Bible, and we couldn't believe that we wasted our time watching the whole movie. The message of this movie is that one should lead a sober and moral life, but it failed to address mankind's helplessness to do so apart from the supernatural help of a loving God.  Lame. Lame. Lame.",1493769600,2,953,4.549707602339181

There were a couple times I was fumbling for the remote to maybe fast forward it a couple times.  There's nothing overtly bad about it, just a little rough for the young'ins.

7284719,2,B00ZPH4SAQ,"I really wanted to like this show, but the characters were very stereotypical and uni-dimensional, and it was hard to really like any of them enough to care that much.  I am usually super easy to please when it comes to Amazon movies.  But this one ugh!  The editing was choppy, and it went from one misadventure to the next, with kind of an eye rolling pacing, and none of the scenes felt really authentic.  It could have been good, and I wanted it to be, but too much going on, and too little depth or exploration of any character.  Not only was it hard to watch the whole thing through, I just wanted it to be over sooner rather than later.  Normally I really enjoy heartfelt God and hope inspired shows, but this was produced like a bad after-school special, and none of the acting plot, or script writing helped.",1493251200,,817,4.377483443708609

The charachter who portrayed Produce was truly a great actor in this film that it got to me emotionally and will make a lasting difference to the way I view those who are different from me.

I loved (and hated) the ending. Husband and I were crying buckets of tears. Someone dies and it rips your heart out. But hey, this is realistic. In real life people don't always pull through.

It started off slow, and I found myself with a growing dislike for the main character.  Yet as he crashed and burned emotionally, other characters and elements of the story began to weave a picture of character and of hope and beauty, and the end result was a believable story that sends a message that all can benefit from by experiencing in this form.

We watched this with the family, and although I believe it was intended for the family, we sent my 11 year old daughter out of the room a couple times due the the mature content and insinuations of certain scenes.

He has been out of baseball for 15 years and has a high school age daughter to raise and yet he is still floundering. From what the movie shows from the  start  is that his daughter loves him and wants to have a relationship with him. He keeps pushing her away to go out and act like he's an 18-year-old  with his buddies.  And then for some strange reason he connects with a down syndrome man at the grocery store and develops a relationship with him.  Instead of building a relationship with his daughter he chooses a total stranger.  He spends more time with this man than he does with his daughter.  Then he  can't figure out why he's losing his daughter and she's disgusted with him.  They try to wrap it all up in the end and bring them all together but I just found the movie lacking in every way.,1486771200,4,904,4.179190751445087

7284777,3,B00ZPH4SAQ,"The movie is missing a lot of minor scenes that would have explained a lot of actions. It's like saying the alphabet and leaving a few letters out. It just doesn't flow. The ending was also somewhat disappointing considering its supposed to be a ""feel-good"" movie. At the end, Milt (the main character, Calvin's, best friend) and Produce (the boy with down syndrome) are both in the hospital because Milt accidentally hit Produce while drunk driving resulting in both being in critical condition (Produce in a more serious condition). Calvin leaves Milt's bedside to tend to Produce then Produce is sent into surgery while Calvin is waiting in the hospital lobby. Next is a scene of Produce's surgery where you then hear the heartbeat machine go flat and  all of a sudden, we are at a funeral where produce is nowhere to be found. Calvin then gets a job as manager of a minor league baseball team and ready to throw the first pitch. He then says he dedicates the first pitch to a guy who left them too early, Produce....""could you get me a ball? This one's for you Milt"" then end of the movie. I understand that Milt was the one who was drunk driving and hurt himself and Produce, but Milt was Calvin's best friend and it was sad either way. Not only that, we do not know what happens to Milt's family considering what caused Milt to drink and drive was because he caught his wife kissing a friend (Frank) who he allowed to stay at his place until Frank got off his feet. The story left so many questions and the entire movie was very unclear with their scenes. It's an okay movie and I'd recommend watching the movie only if you can put the pieces of the story together.",1486684800,2,1671,4.478688524590164

What initially seems an odd mismatch becomes a friendship that changes both their lives. As a person who has a family member with Down Syndrome, I have often wished others could experience the love, humor, and caring that I have found in my friendship with a person who has Down Syndrome.

You have to decide if your dreams are bigger then your memories, or will you stay stuck in the past. Life is meant to be lived, and lived abundantly. You look around a cemetery and you will see there are two dates on every tombstone. There is a birthdate and a date of death. Every human being is guaranteed those two dates. But that little dash that lies in between those two numbers, that is what defines our life, so make your dash count. Live... Really Live""",1483056000,,619,4.254237288135593

Definitely a great movie for a family date night, though the kids would probably have to be at least 12 to really get some of the life struggles it presents.

7285594,5,B00ZPH4SAQ,"I had seen the trailer for this movie in theaters but it never came to Phoenix. I guess if a movie is deemed, ""faith based"" studios figure it to be box office poison. Well don't judge a book by its cover let alone a movie by its title. This is simply a story about redemption and inspiration. There's no heavy preaching but an examination of human relationships. I found myself cheering for Produce, and liked the way the movie dealt with down syndrome. Anyone who's ever had a relative or friend with down syndrome can see a little of themselves in the main character. There's patience and understanding but ultimately realizing everyone has the same needs in life of love, companionship, and just wanting to be wanted. All in all, this is one of the better movies to come out in years. You will even recognize a few actors and actresses us 80s and 90s kids grew up with.",1475452800,,872,4.490566037735849

7285693,4,B00ZPH4SAQ,"This is the touching story of
(a) the decision by one man to change his life;
(b) the positive effects it had on his daughter, friends, and acquaintances; and ...
(c) the primary part a challenged teen had in this story.
This was generally a 'family' movie (yet still had two instances of non-child language [profanity]).  Overall, this was an enjoyable movie.  Its purpose was not to win an award, but, rather, to get the viewer to contemplate human nature - both the bad and the good.

[NOTE: I have no idea why Danica McKellar's name is listed above. She played only a minor role in the last ten minutes of this movie.  The other cast members were either lesser known or even 'unknown' ... yet their performances were every bit as good - or, perhaps, better!]",1473465600,,762,4.54014598540146

Young people - especially teenagers - need the love and approval of their dads, or they seek love somewhere else.  People who we often discount because of their appearance or some physical challenge that makes them different are real people and have great value, too.  Often they express their love more freely than we 'normal' people because we are too occupied with ourselves trying to appear 'normal.'  Vote Trump.",1473033600,,518,4.976744186046512

7285739,5,B00ZPH4SAQ,"We loved this movie. The boy with Downs Syndrome is adorable and has the ""funniest"" personality and outlook on life. It deals with prejudice, alcohol abuse, and home lives that are less than ideal without being ""preachy"", overbearing, sappy, or melodramatic. The twist at the end was totally unexpected and well done.  I was ok with what I THOUGHT was going to happen, but delighted with the ""real"" ending. It's a great family movie and has lots of teaching opportunities for teens, but parents may want to preview for young children who may not understand some scenes and situations. There are references to teen sex with some mild making out, a little bad language where it would make sense in the story, some scenes of mild violence and bullying, a car accident with serious injuries. As I said, these are all great teaching opportunities and offer many chances for good discussions and demonstrating the choices we all have. They were all handled with sensitivity and diplomacy, and we found it to be a very engaging and enjoyable drama.",1472774400,,1041,4.848314606741573

7285816,5,B00ZPH4SAQ,"Wow, wasn't expecting Where Hope Grows to be so good!  It's about an ex-baseball player (played by Kristoffer Polaha) who didn't like the way his career ended (he froze at home plate in a big moment with 40,000 fans watching- ouch!  Carlos Beltran of the '06 Mets can relate) and several years later he never recovered from that embarrassing moment and turned into a deadbeat dad I guess you could say.

His daughter, played by McKaley Miller, initially comes off like a VERY disrespectful teenage girl until we find out why- Kristoffer has a drinking problem.  He can't kick the habit no matter how many times his daughter argues with him.  He doesn't see how much he's changing his daughter and making her negative and rebellious.  Wow someone takes baseball failures personally!  He and his daughter constantly get into fights, and while I understand McKaley's point of view (years and years of frustration dealing with a dad who won't change) I think there's times when she's *too* hard on the guy.  The scene where she has to pick him up from the police station after a night of heavy drinking is when she declares she's officially giving up on him.  Perhaps this is what her father needed to straighten him out, but it seems like McKaley *really* hits hard with her speech at the police station!  You've gone too far little lady!

Anyway, what it takes for a change in Kristoffer's life is a miraculous turn of events... and this turn occurs when Kristoffer meets a young man with Down Syndrome (played by David Desanctis) whose named is Produce.  Produce works at a grocery store.  The two start off with normal conversations but because of Produce's likeable personality the two get to know each other better.  I think it's pretty awesome to see an ex-baseball player, handsome cool guy  hanging out with a man with Down Syndrome.  You wouldn't think the two would hit off a friendship and yet they do.

Turns out Produce has some amazing gifts.  In addition to his personality, he can immediately recite any code on the back of any fruit or veggie in the store.  Also when Kristoffer teaches him baseball behind the grocery store (using a stick and oranges as balls) Produce's character is able to learn from Kristoffer's knowledge rather fast!  Produce's splattering oranges left and right.  Unfortunately while Produce is happy, Kristoffer continues to struggle with his hidden alcohol problem.

Eventually he and Produce get into fights because of the drinking, and Produce -knowing alcohol is bad and even mentions it while at the store (something like ""My momma always said drinking that stuff is bad"" and Kristoffer even agreeing with it) learns the hard way that dealing with an alcoholic isn't easy.  This major problem of Kristoffer's, along with memories of his baseball failures, means he doesn't want to accept a job at a Louisville sluggers association by a man who recognizes him as a former baseball player, nor does he like it when his friend (William Zabka) gives him a hard time and chews him apart calling him a loser, etc.  Of course the two get into a fight afterwards.  You'd *think* Kristoffer would learn how much his alcohol problem is affecting his daughter.  That should have been the first clue!

There's another element to this story.  McKaley's boyfriend (Kerr Smith) is a no good punk.  He steals alcohol at the grocery store and threaten Produce to keep quiet about it or else.  Produce knows right from wrong so he eventually spills the truth.  This doesn't make Kerr happy.  Kerr continues to cause trouble by forcing himself onto McKaley, roughing up Produce, and being an all around nuisance.  Produce gets the last laugh though!  Sorry probably shouldn't laugh at what Produce does.  I think Kerr was the wrong choice for bad guy.  He doesn't have the size or intimidation that a bully usually has, and I'm surprised Kristoffer didn't end up getting into a fight with this kid.  Really surprised.

Oh and what the!  When Kristoffer attends an Alcoholics Anonymous and meets up with Brooke Burns character, I thought she was Molly Potter of Parenthood fame!  A striking resemblance there.  I was even about to say the movie has a Parenthood vibe running through it too (and it still does- just without Molly, haha).

Anyway there's a lot to like about this movie.  It's moving, sad, inspiring, happy and more.  Hard to believe but William plays a big role in the final 20 minutes.  I won't spoil it, but let's just say he found his wife cheating on him by making out with another guy.. and this results in something horrible happening to not only him but another key character in the movie.  Otherwise I highly recommend this movie.  I honestly can't think of any faults with this movie.  It's just too bad Produce didn't get the employee of the month award.  He certainly deserved it, however... yeah, perhaps he gets something even better later on.  If I could complain about one thing, perhaps the second part of the movie drags a little compared to the stuff between Kristoffer and Produce in the first half.  But it makes up for dragging during the final 20 minutes.

And there might be a storyline error.  Kristoffer mentions he froze at homeplate when recalling his failures and the reason he began drinking.  He played for the Tigers.  When he (SPOILERS) comes back to play baseball again he's pitching.  The Tigers are an American league team which means pitchers don't bat.  So it appears his return to baseball was to become a pitcher instead of a batter, because he couldn't have been batting during his first stab at baseball.  I think it's a storyline error myself.",1471305600,,5624,4.786902286902287

7285900,4,B00ZPH4SAQ,"It was a really good movie. Definitely worth a watch. It's an old story but, still likable. It gets to laid back in the story line and acting if you ask me though. It's to mmmm, what's the word... like, going through the motions, instead of pouring it all out. Still made for a great movie. The characters/actors were all really good. I think maybe they tried to make a point rather than let the story make it's point. Anyway... yeh, it almost felt like the director and/or writers were like, no, let's do it this way instead... and they had to hurry up and do it that way. It felt sort of rushed to get to the point or finish. Like I said though, still made for a great story and movie,... and the actors did do really well.",1470614400,,725,4.185714285714286
7285901,5,B00ZPH4SAQ,"This is a rare film. A film that deals with so many issues, yet weaves them all together in one cohesive story. It's a feel good movie. Yet, hard to watch. Inspiring. Funny. Sad. Shocking. Just watch it. Whoever wrote and directed this film, needs to think of other movies to make, because these people are genius. Rare gems in a sea of mindless, mediocre movie mush. So tired of boring, idiotic movies that show us nothing but violence, murder, rage, loveless sex and hopelessness. This is a movie where someone actually used critical thinking skills to weave together many issues into an intense, realistic looking, touching film. Rare. Rare. Rare these days. We actually see issues in this film that we can all relate to. Real. Raw. Love it. Again, I am so done with the ridiculously low level thinking junk that is out there everyday. Please, for the love of God, will more directors make movies like this. I don't even mind intense or raw themes, just so long as there is tangible HOPE at the end. Redemption. That is what makes a movie. Hope.",1470528000,31,1048,4.609625668449198
7285902,5,B00ZPH4SAQ,"This is an Excellent movie. Two unlikely men become fast friends and the bond between them is wonderful to watch.  It is heartwarming and a beautiful story of a former major league baseball player who was fired and his life in in a downward spiral until he meets ""Produce"" in the grocery store and life changes for him.  The movie shows how people with Downs Syndrome are not people to be avoided or feared and teaches what huge hearts and genuine happiness they have about life.

Some of the aspects of this movie that I liked was that it had great acting, and a great concept that in the end made you feel good. It has its moments, and there is a twist at the end, but overall it was an okay movie. A few qualms I have about the movie are that it felt extremely rushed, such as the relationship between Produce and Calvin, and that there wasn't much detail to backup the relations between the other characters. There is some character development, but on a very basic level. A great start, but I wouldn't watch it again.",1469923200,,606,4.278260869565218

7286069,4,B00ZPH4SAQ,"Calvin Campbell could have made it big in baseball. Operative word - could have. After freezing up during an important game and being fired, he drinks to try to drown his despair. His daughter Katie despises his drinking and, in protest, dates a guy her father disapproves of. Colt isn't that bad, is he? But then things start going even farther down, with a friend constantly reminding Calvin of his failure and Colt pressuring Katie to have sex. How long will it be before one or both of them crack?

""Where Hope Grows"" is a movie full of both despair and hope, with hope coming triumphant in the end. Produce, a Christian man with Down Syndrome helps both Calvin and Katie realize that the way they're heading has nothing good in store. Though tragic, the ending brings father and daughter to new paths. The movie is not as Christian as some, but it does show the role the church has in transforming peoples' lives.",1468972800,,918,4.597560975609756

This film is. I don't know any of the actors, but they were great. This is not a sappy story -- there's an edge to it, and you may not want your youngest children to see it.

A close family member has Down syndrome. I could not be happier with the way the film explores our society's typical response to a person with Down's. It does not back away from words or actions that we normally encounter. When it shows a character correcting the outdated thinking of another character, it's done in a natural, non-preachy way.

7286618,2,B00ZPH4SAQ,"As a Christian I really Enjoy Faith based movies. This film had a lot of potential but unfortunately fails to delivers in many areas. I think what was most disappointing was the way the writers chose to end the film. I found it laughable in a bad way the trick they pull on the audience. In my opinion it COMPLETELY discredits what they were accomplishing. (Spoiler) ""It's like yea... this pitch is dedicated to my friend... hand me the ball produce whoa plot twist we thought produce was dead but he wasn't his other friend was dead instead..."" Are you kidding me? Just because he doesn't have downs doesn't make it any less sad, not to mention they did nothing to resolve the serious marital issues between the two.

PROS: Good Christian message, Good concept and plot

CONS: VERY underdeveloped characters and screen writing. There is so much left unexplained: i.e. Mother of Katie what happened? What ever happened to the relationship of the guy who died at the end did they reconcile? Actors were well cast, the writers need to be fired. It is good to know the same actor who played music is a lead role in the movie ""The Song,"" which was a million times better than this one.",1467504000,4,1181,4.566037735849057

7286913,5,B00ZPH4SAQ,"This movie touched me in so many ways.
I would recommend this movie for everyone.
I love the title, which really fits the movie and how I felt at the end.

I have read other reviews, which I usually don't do.
A few reviewers were angry that the character of ""Produce"" was never asked his real name by any of the other characters.
I noticed this also, because I was curious what his real name was, but it didn't bother me.
Obviously, he got the nickname of Produce somehow because he worked in the produce section of the supermarket, or maybe he even started calling himself that because he was very proud of his job.
He wore a nametag pin that said Produce, so if the name bothered him, then he would not wear that.
His baseball shirt had the name Produce printed on the back, so if the nickname bothered him, he could have asked for a different name to be printed on the shirt.
If it bothered him to be called Produce, then he could have just asked people not to call him that, or he could have introduced himself to people with his real name..... This character obviously was not shy, so if something bothered him, I am sure that he would speak up.
I don't understand why reviewers assumed that it was an insult for the character to go by this name.
Maybe he hated his real name....Many people do not like their names, so they use their middle name as their first name, or they use nicknames.
I think that the reviewers were angry about this just because the character had Down's Syndrome.... If the character did not have this condition, then I don't think that anyone would be angry.",1466640000,,1587,4.379661016949153

I'm glad I watched before sitting down with my kids to see  I thought it had a few too many plot lines going on...Just the story with Calvin/Produce & Katie/Colt was enough to make a movie, without bringing in the troubled marriage of his friend Milton.  There was a lot of adult situations, so I would just say as a parent to watch before showing it to your kids.

7287156,4,B00ZPH4SAQ,"This is a good movie.  I really enjoyed the stories that it told.

It is PG-13 for a few intense scenes and some mild language.  Be aware of that.
Some peope will find the attempted rape scene disturbing.  No rape is mild but what is portrayed on screen is mild.  No nudity or anything remotely like that. Its About 3/4 into the movie, if you want to preview before movie night begins.

The bad language was mild and (I would like to say) unnecessary.

I truly loved all the characters and enjoyed Produce.  I love his nickname and did not see it as belittling.  I had a silly name when I was in the Army and I don't have ds.  It was fun and I enjoyed it.  Produce is an innocent friendly name with no harm intended.

Awesome story.

The rest of the movie was upsetting.  There is a rape by a main character that is violent and horrifying.  I love many other Christian and Family Friendly movies, but this is a poor excuse of a film that is not Christian at all.  I recommend NOT seeing it and look for another movie.

In life you alone make choices for you, only those that believe they have no other options are the ones who are demonstrating their immaturity. I am suggesting by watching what happens in the end of this movie that it's an immaturity issue, and if that is dealt with when life's disappointments hits you, (and it will) you don't have to slowly die or kill anyone.

Everyone seems to have too many problems so it's just crosses the line between being ""realistic"" and just losing credibility. I know movies are not always realistic and this is fine, but you have to be careful not to overload or the movie just becomes ridiculous.
overall an OK movie but could have been much better. I thought the actors were doing a good job and the overall ""production"" is ok, but for some reason it just doesn't go the extra mile to be a good movie.",1465257600,,528,4.3979591836734695

We love all of God's children and this is a wonderful, feel-good story that involves a young man ""special needs.""  The ironic thing is...the main character (ex-baseball player) has more ""special needs"" that a young man helps with than the other way around.  We were amazed at what a good actor he is.  We have a hard time memorizing lines and know how hard it can be!

8720544,5,B00ZPH4SAQ,"A very endearing, lovely story about an amazing young man with Downs Syndrome and the preciousness of life.  Also, it is a story about true friendship.  Calvin and Produce--unlikely friends, to be be sure--nevertheless, redeem each other.  I'm keeping this in my permanent collection. I'll try to remember to watch it again if I get bogged down with petty concerns.  This story should cure that.",1534636800,,395,5.030769230769231
