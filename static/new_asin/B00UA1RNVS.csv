7031502,5,B00UA1RNVS,"Being new to Korean drama, I picked several series and movies to watch based on my favorite actor, Lee Min Ho.  This series is the best one I've seen so far.  There is just the right balance between the action and romance to keep me entertained for the entire show, which runs for 20 episodes.  The story is based on a man who is raised as a weapon of revenge, but who finds love and friendships he needs to protect from his path of vengeance.

Let me give one note of caution for American viewers though.  Korean shows and movies will not follow the American version of ""happily ever after""!  You will need to set aside your ideas about how quickly good wins over evil, and how romance is all hearts and flowers.  There is quite a bit of ambiguity in most of the Korean dramas I've seen thus far, especially in the endings, which can be frustrating.",1442188800,5,850,4.341772151898734

7031504,5,B00UA1RNVS,"Nice digipak version!  Produced by PMP.  I always look for the PMP and Poh Kim versions for my Korean dramas, so I could guarantee that the English subtitles are excellent and picture quality is what I expected for a TV drama.  I don't trust versions that are produced by other companies. Much worse, versions that don't even have the production company listed but are listed here on Amazon and usually have a cover with a black bar at the bottom of the product image.",1430784000,13,468,4.5476190476190474

8704873,4,B00UA1RNVS,could be a little better clarity on the recordings but otherwise great. Loved the series when it was on Netflix have watched it several times. We ordered this copy for my daughter for her birthday. She is a big Kdrama fan. We have started watching with her.
