8509229,5,B0073HPJPE,"Its a great drama,and comes in 3 really nice boxes. Its totally worth it, I love to re-watch the drama. Its as enjoyable as the Princess Returning Pearl 1998, but personally I enjoy this one much more. The quality and subtitles are of great quality too.",1381104000,2,253,4.521739130434782
8509230,5,B0073HPJPE,"The original version already stole so many people heart in the late 90s all the way until now. Many people say that the remake is incomparable but I think they both have their own good and bad. In the beginning I thought the same thing as everyone but I was quite excited because I was also hoping there'll be a remake of this series. Dream came true and they did. Anyways, the DVD came in great quality, the cover was beautiful, subtitle was well done. I couldn't be more happy with it. I'm so happy to have this to add to my hzgg collection.",1361836800,3,543,4.230769230769231
8509231,5,B0073HPJPE,"I knew already what I wanted when I purchased this item. But looking now at the new cover, I would have waited because the cover of the item I purchased, only four of the main characters are showing but with the one I am looking at now and being advertised all of the main characters are on the cover of the DVD.  If I only waited I could have had this cover instead of what I have now. I would really have preferred the new cover than what I have now. The movie itself is really wonderful, the audio and subtitles are perfectly done and so understandable.  I don't regret buying it for my own pleasure and watching it again and again.",1332720000,5,635,4.19672131147541
