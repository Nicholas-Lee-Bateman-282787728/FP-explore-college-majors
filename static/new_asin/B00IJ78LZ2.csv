6265630,1,B00IJ78LZ2,"If Darth Vader, Kevin Bacon, Johnny Depp, Gambit (XMen) and the famous babysitter from Florida Casey Anthony were somehow able to have a child together, you would have Space Pirate Captain Harlock. Basically, when you do see him , he flips his cape about and sulks behind his emo hair.
The only thing I really enjoyed about the movie was the dark matter powered phallical space ship he drove around coming right at it you in about every other scene. Beyond that, I just had a difficult time staying interested.
Sure, the animation was gorgeous, but I got the impression that the story was cobbled together by what ""writer"" they could afford after blowing their budget on the art department.
Oh, and that tantalizing space ship. It crashes on the dying/ recovering (depends on how you look at it) earth at the end and the rarely seen drama queen of a Captain gives up his eye patch to the obvious successor. However, in another round of homoerotism, the ship takes off for another adventure.",1400976000,6,990,4.695402298850575

6265633,4,B00IJ78LZ2,"At some time in out future, or perhaps past, Earth has colonized the galaxy with 500 billion people or so. As it turns out , it is not like Star Trek and inhabitable planets are inhospitable and there is only one other intelligent species out they are down to their last one. So even though we made it to 500 billion in space, we couldn't sustain it and everyone is told to come back home, apparently not a well thought out plan as the Earth couldn't hold everyone, ergo ""The Homecoming Wars."" A truce was made and a Gaia Coalition was formed telling everyone to stay away from earth, i.e. go back and die or something.

After creating plot holes big enough to drive a dark mattered powered starship through, enters Harlock a space pirate who is stealing detonators from dead planets. Logan signs on as a crew member although he is really an operative for the Coalition who want to prevent Harlock from returning to earth, which becomes clear later on. It is confusing as to who are the good guys and who are the bad guys. The plot twists at 30 minutes, then twists again at an hour, and then again. The pirate soldiers wore outfits that looked like there came out of ""The Fifth Element"" while the Coalition opted for classic Starwars storm trooper outfits.

The entire film is CG. There is a cute blonde, but I am an old fashion guy. Tifa is my first and only love. About an hour into the film it attempts to build character through some flashbacks, but it really sucked at it.

The film is about two hours long and my interested started to wane at about the third plot twist, which seemed more like a sign of bad writing than good. I enjoyed the graphics and an introduction to the Harlock character, another in an infinite series of Japanese animated characters I never knew about. The plot could have been tighter.

I watched the film in English without the subtitles.

I think that they would sell like hotcakes It's such a great movie. I just hope that they don't throw making it in 3-D out the window it would be a big loss because of how great the movie is. 3-D would enhance an already great movie even more.,1427932800,,405,4.2727272727272725

6265638,5,B00IJ78LZ2,"While the space opera story line isn't new, It definitely has enough twists to be interesting. There is enough believability that it could easily be a a series, here in the US.
That isn't the only reason. The animation was superb. Why, because the the animation is so life like that it is gorgeous and believably real. Gone is the square, chunky looking characters and choppy actions,. The picture depth is extraordinary. It is so beautiful you would swear tha again it was real. It is one of the few films involving animation and story line that I found it refreshing and worth buying. It is getting harder and harder to find in the US or zone A
So did I? Exactly, I have both the DVD and the Blu Ray of this film. The difference is only slight between the two. It is mainly in the volume and the sound.
Personally, I would recommend this film become part of one's library.",1426809600,2,874,4.401234567901234

6265640,5,B00IJ78LZ2,"Excellent CGI film.  Amazing CGI, great action, storyline and pacing.  While it is a sci-fi movie, the film does have a heart and soul and the characters feel real.  I do wish they would have developed some of the other pirates though.  Perhaps in a future film, whether a sequel or a prequel.  Talking of the CGI, I was watching the Yullian character (Harlock's chubby second in command) and was thinking, ""hmm, this actor must be wearing padding to make himself look fat"".  Duh, it's not an actor, it computer-generated! Bop myself on the head. That's how good the quality is.  Of course there are other great CGI films out there like Tin Tin, Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, Oblivion Island: Haruka and the Magic Mirror etc.  Harlock definitely ranks up there with the best of `em.  Would also like to see an extended version of these film if extra scenes exist",1425081600,,867,4.651315789473684

Story was great. It had decent substance  Even some character development...Even my lady liked it and she isn't in to animated movies (except ones like Disneys TANGLED and FROZEN).  Animation was superb.  3D very good...Lots of really incredible depth but not much out of the screen pop-out.  It didn't need pop-outs.  The movie stands on its own in 2D but the 3D really enhanced the experience.  It was interesting to hear it in the original Japanese, but the subtitles are mandatory, unless you understand Japanese or Chinese (It's dubbed in Chinese).  The surround sound was all over the viewing area...Very good audio.

It also came in good time and good condition.  There was only one left, but if more become available and you like animated Sci-Fi that isn't drivel buy it.",1410652800,6,943,4.568862275449102

6265653,1,B00IJ78LZ2,"HARLOCK NO MORE...

Over the past 20 or so years, Captain Harlock creator Leiji Matsumoto has tried various ways to reboot his franchises - from Galaxy Express to Yamato...and yet, with both story and stylistic re-designs...he hasn't been successful. Instead of continuing to draw and create in his old style, he's tried to resonate with a younger audience by enlarging those Matsumoto-eyes (super long lashes and all), and turning to stories that totally miss out on his old space opera genre focusing instead on themes that are contrived and contemporary...and so those franchises have failed...

In fact, Matsumoto's stories have gotten too young, too juvenile...

Others like Rin Taro, have tried to recapture the look/feel of Matsumoto's old work quite perfectly with Captain Herlock, but have aimed to turn ""Harlock/Herlock"" into a dark, mentally unstable nihilist monster...which this film is the ultimate confirmation of.

What happened to the stoic, honorable, rugged individualist that we all loved? Matsumoto's genius was to integrate a Samurai meets Ninkyo Eiga meets Spaghetti Western meets Fritz Lang / Wagner with a Franco-Nihonjin sensibility...aimed at children and adults...with incredible visions for what the future could mean to all of us...his aliens weren't monsters...they were beautiful vegetable women (delicious!)...

Like many others, I grew up with anime thanks to Matsumoto himself. I owe the man so much. But I am not ashamed to be critical of what he's let his characters become.

This movie looks cool. Very cool. But this is NOT Harlock. And neither is Matsumoto's past few incarnations of him...

This Harlock is nasty, evil...not just an anti-hero but a monster of a man...like a puppet whose strings are pulled by some Japanese Trash-Metal Punk band's vision of what being a hero is - rebelling for the sake of rebelling. And I am sad to say, but this is the state of Japanese pop culture today with few exceptions. They are a civilization in decline. And if you compare their art from 30-40 years ago to today - such as this series - it's totally clear.

The only Harlock I have seen in years makes a brief appearance in Galaxy Railways under another name, as the Father of one of the main protagonist (although that show has a few good moments, it never reaches classic Matsumoto).

I suggest that anyone with an interest in Harlock stick to the two original series and film - Waga Seishun No Arcadia.

That's where things begin and stop. Along with the original manga.

Incidentally, this film was a massive loss and failure for Toei and it's producers. 30 million down the drain. And they have no idea why...or do they...",1409529600,3,2662,5.01360544217687

6265655,3,B00IJ78LZ2,"I watched this on the italian release in italian dub and as a big fan growing up with those characters I was a bit disappointed with the plot and drama, the tv series had more charm and made more sense, I feel they tried to pack a lot in but is a good start. The visuals are great. I feel sorry for the american release denies its audience to watch this dubbed and only forces you to read inaccurate subtitles. People should be allowed to choose, the english dub does exist why not include it. Mean. I guess hollywood does not want american audiences to start watching something not made by them. Control freaks! Captain Harlock is well worth watching but I recommend you shop around for a release that allows you to choose how you want to watch it rather than give you no choice in favour of a industry led decision.",1408752000,,817,4.34640522875817

6265658,3,B00IJ78LZ2,"Well - it has Captain Harlock and the Arcadia.  They are in space and they do perform piracy.  AND.. that pretty much sums up how much Harlock story line is preserved from the original.
The CGI was very nice, and the effects glorious.  I am just getting tired of rebooted material.
To my limited language skills the English subs were off from the spoken words.  Also, why do people feel the need to change names?  Sheffield in place of Tochiro being the big one here.
All in all, the movie was visually beautiful and empty of the epicness of the original story.",1407196800,6,561,4.46078431372549
6265659,4,B00IJ78LZ2,"It's a great CG Movie but it really only borrows the hero, his crew and the 'sets' from the Anime. Most elements of the Anime are changed in some way from the universe that Harlock existed in.
I can't complain so much because apparently Leiji Matsumoto is in charge of this, but if you are well versed in the Matsumoto works this might put you off some.
I like it, it's just quite a bit different from what I know as the Harlock universe.",1406937600,5,438,4.226190476190476

6265661,5,B00IJ78LZ2,Excellent movie!  3D is outstanding!,1406419200,4,36,6.2
6265662,5,B00IJ78LZ2,"This a beautiful movie as noted in several reviews.  Its almost worth watching with the sound off so you can concentrate on the pictures.

I watched the version with the English dub.  I was a bit confused by some dialogue that didn't make sense, and then I discovered that the Collectors Edition has the Japanese version with English subtitles and is 5 minutes longer.  So naturally I had to buy that one as well.  I don't know why the editors had to cut so much out  the story with subtitles makes much more sense, and the bits cut out that involve Nami and Ezra and Logan make a nicer story that gives much deeper, sadder meaning to their actions all through the movie.  The English dubbed version makes some characters much more antagonistic.  There are a few pieces of English dialogue that would be great added to the subtitled version, but if you see both it adds up to an even better story.  I also saw this in 3D blue-ray at a friends place  the effects were excellent and worth catching if possible.

The Arcadia is a lovely steampunk dream of a ship.  Even the pirates armour is gorgeous and they fight with giant axes.  In spite of the enormously high body count its a surprisingly bloodless movie.  Something to watch for: When the Jovian Blaster takes a shot at the Arcadia watch those prongs on top of the Arcadia turn into DNA helixes.  Its quick and you might miss it.  Consider - the ship is self-repairing and has the computer has Toshiros consciousness.  Raises some interesting issues Id love to see in a sequel.

Like many stories there are some gaping plot holes, but this is fiction, Science-Fiction, for goodness sake.  One review I read elsewhere complained about the Arcadia being powered by Dark Matter. Seriously?  Who says its the same as what we call dark matter? No-one ever questions how or why space ships have gravity that can be turned on and off at will.  No one ever asks if they stop off at some planet to shop at the swishy cape boutique.  Is it a special order, or just off the rack?  I especially love it that the pirate ship has a floor polisher  but did they steal it or buy it somewhere?  These are far more important questions.  Actually on the dark matter question the website scifijapan.com has Harlock production notes and other interesting info that fills in lots of the gaps.  If you want total spoilers read the Wikipedia entry on the movie - It explains most things.  I like the compliment paid by film makers that I don't actually need to have everything spelled out for me, but the spoilers did help.

Another curious thing: Harlock is 6ft6 tall.  Logan is just under 6ft tall. By the end of the movie they are almost the same height.  (Height chart is on Youtube  search for Captain Harlock  Behind the Scene and look at No 4  Characters.  Its in Japanese but is only a minute and a half.  They are all worth a look, just to appreciate the animation process.)  The parallels between Harlock and Logan battling their guilt and seeking atonement and redemption give a lovely symmetry.  Its hard to believe this is CGI.  I think the best face/amination is actually Yulian.  (How in earth does he fit in the armour?) The women all look a bit plastic, but very pretty. The Gaia Council have expressive faces too.  The voice actors in both versions are very well chosen and do a great job.

I was interested to find out that Captain Harlock has been around in Manga and Anime since the early 70s.  So much adventure to catch up on!  Compared with the anime this Harlock is dark and brooding.  The movie is cleverly edited, never showing Harlock for very long.  Just a lesson in how to make one eye sexy, in 10 second glimpses.  By the way, if you ever find yourself in the future, or the far distant past, make sure you get the franchise on rib-knitted turtle neck jumpers.  With zips.  Just about everyone has one.  One of the pirates even has a knitted onesie.  And ankle knobs.  I suppose you can guess that I have watched this more than once, but I find there is so much in it to enjoy.  I hope you do too.",1405814400,23,4059,4.451700680272109

It took less than five minutes to get me stuck in the story, although my wifi connection made the graphics degrade. So imagine my excitement when I found it on blu ray!
Where to start? First of all, the original voice acting is wonderful if you don't mind subtitles, and the space battles were an epic example of good CGI, as were the characters. For samurai fans, there's an excellent--if short--hand to hand combat scene. Really the only problem I had with it was that they didn't show enough of harlock, and that may be a breaking point for fans of the old shows. However the length is great for my fellow movie geeks who hate it when a good movie is too short.
