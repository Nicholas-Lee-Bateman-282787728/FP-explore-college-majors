67256,4,0783245130,"In a decade where bad sci-fi and monster films outweighed the good about three to one, from a company who had not made a good original shocker in over ten years came this true underwater gem.  A group of scientists go on  an expedition after finding a fossil, but what they run into is an  intelligent gill man who does his best to counter their every move and  suddenly the hunters become the hunted. The photography is great, fairly  strong cast with very natural performances and a classic soundtrck make  this a fine film. There are a few slow moments, but overall this is one of  the finest monster flicks of the 50's and Universal deserves a lot of  credit for taking there time and making a quality monster film instead of  making a cookie cutter piece of garbage like the ones that dominated the  decade.  This one is worth having in your collection.",944784000,2,858,4.5064935064935066

The first sequel went nowhere slowly, but the third one alone is worth the price of the set, because it goes back to the original premise and is a rollicking bad creature feature. Highly recommend this set.",1494288000,,454,4.481927710843373

67372,3,0783245130,"This is a great sci-fi horror flick, make no mistake. And having it in 3D must make a lot of 3D enthusiasts very excited. My problem with this Blu-ray is that they've made this 4:3 film 16:9 by zooming in, thereby cutting off information from the top and the bottom of the picture. For about 70% of the movie, it seems correct, but the underwater scenes were definitely framed for 4:3 viewing - many times swimmers have their heads cut off or you can't see what they're doing on the bottom of the picture. Also, since all crossfades and fade outs involved second-generation print material, those scene look REALLY soft when enlarged for widescreen. On a large monitor (60"" in my case), it's really annoying. The picture keeps going from pristine sharp to DVD-quality fuzzy from one shot to the next. I could accurately predict when a fade was coming by the quality of the picture.

Maybe they needed the 16:9 ratio to make the 3D work correctly (I don't have a 3D TV, so I profess ignorance of the technology), but they lost a lot of quality in doing so. So is this the definitive version of the film? No way. The definitive version has not been released yet.",1462320000,,1159,4.519047619047619
67373,4,0783245130,"I would have given the 3D version of ""Creature"" 5 stars, however, Universal elected to release a re-converged version that was aimed at a now defunct SKY-TV 3D
channel requirement that not only lessened depth on the underwater scenes,
brought floating underwater debris
too close for viewing comfort & on
many above water scenes appears to
 have lessened geometry on actors faces, etc. All of this lessens the 3D
viewing experience
The film transfers for each eye are fine....and there is an easy way  to
compensate for Universal's mistake. Simply re-adjust the convergence on
your 3D blu ray player for more
depth. About 6 pixels in should work
on most players. This will allow for a closer proximation of the way the
film is supposed to look, although
not necessarily as 3D accurate as it
should be. It really does make a big
difference, and one of the very few
times that that ""depth charge""
control should ever be used.
It is also annoying that you have to go through a 2nd 3D prompt to get it to play in 3D, and that 2nd prompt is worded to almost recommending the viewer to opt out of the 3D version.
All said, once I re-converged this, the film was a lot more fun, more like the classic I remember & in many ways, totally amazing. Get it, but be aware of how to do your own 3D fux.",1461456000,,1288,4.430379746835443

Sure the graphics are better but it would be a big challenge to beat the graphics in this classic.  Swimming in the Amazon, the boat, the people - it's all great!

67438,5,0783245130,"CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON (1954) is one of the best monster movies of the 1950's, mostly due to the outstanding creature costume, and Jack Arnold's direction. A scientific expedition travels through the title lagoon, in search of the prehistoric gill-man. Many deaths ensue, when said creature spots the lovely Kay Lawrence (Julie Adams), and decides that he can't live without her. This is understandable, especially when we get to see Kay's leisurely swim sequence! The lovesick lug will do anything to make her his catch-of-the-day! Meanwhile, Dr. David Reed (Richard Carlson-  IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE, THE MAZE) and Mark Williams (Richard Denning- CREATURE WITH THE ATOM BRAIN, THE BLACK SCORPION) battle over just about everything!

67516,5,0783245130,"Love it.  Those of you who remember watching the creature movies back in the days of Creature Features will love this collection.  All three movies are in one convenient package.  There's lots of commentary by film historians and cast members.  Julie Adams (the creature's love interest) tells how scifi movies were considered almost second class or B movies then and how she wasn't thrilled to be assigned to this movie but once shooting started she really got into it and had a good time.  I always like to hear the cast member's thoughts and rememberances of the movie shoots.  The first creature movie was definately the best one and the reason I wouldn't swim in a lake until I was thirty (scared the SHIZZLE outta me when I was a kid) but if you're going to take a trip down memory lane why not take a few extra steps and view all three.  The picture quality and sound is good the only thing missing is color.  A lot of the old schoolers would say black and white is the only way a classic horror movie should be shot, I disagree.  After seeing Julie Adams in shorts and then a bathing suit when the crew is riding on the Rita to the black lagoon, it's no wonder why the creature went gaga for her!  The creature is definately the best of the Universal monsters.  If you're a fan of the old Universal monsters and like to listen to commentary by the remaining stars and historians this set won't let you down.  If you're a newby to the genre, want to see what life was like before jason and freddy then I encourage you to view this.  Sit back, butter the popcorn, dim the lights and step back into some of the best monster movies to come out of hollywood in the fifties...",1425081600,,1678,4.356913183279743
67537,5,0783245130,"I recently purchased a few of the newer 2014 rereleases of the Universal Monster movies. The quality of the discs themselves were fine but I felt the packaging and the effort into the overall product left a little to be desired. In my personal opinion these Legacy Edition releases are hard to beat. From the slipcover packaging to the quality of the film transfers these versions are the most respectful to historical nature of the original releases.

Although my personal favorite is Karloff's Frankenstein and the Mummy I have a fondness for the Creature From The Black Lagoon that exceeds even Dracula and the Wolfman. I've been waiting for the price on this collection to finally drop some and Amazon didn't let me down. The final piece for my collection and overall the hardest it seems to find especially in unopened original form... I honestly couldn't be more satisfied.

I was very impressed with this 3D from the 50,s. It is much better than some of todays 3D movies. I notice flaws in all movies that I watch, but this one stands alone and I could not find any whatsoever. I won't go into the storyline because we all know it. I highly recommend this for all 3D film buffs and you won't be disappointed.

Highly recommended. Additionally, I have the same reaction to the 3d release of the Vincent Price ""House of Wax"".  If anything, the 3d effects in it are even better than in ""Creature From the Black Lagoon"", likely due to the superior 3d process in which ""House"" was originally filmed.",1416355200,,446,4.414634146341464
67601,4,0783245130,"At Wal-Mart, I picked this up on a lark, after having not seen it for over forty years (at least).  There it was, in Blu-ray, and in 3D, no less.  I had never seen the 3D version, since I was only about a year old when it was originally released to theaters, so I bought it for both nostalgia's sake and mild curiosity over this visual effect.  The incorrect impression I had was that the 3D was the anaglyph style, requiring the red-blue glasses.  It was not.  It was instead the type of 3D using the polarized glasses, and that's how it was originally filmed.  For years, I had believed that that the use of polarized lenses was a later development.

Anyway, the 3D was excellent.  Also, that creature costume was very detailed, and quite expensive for its time.  Universal was rightfully proud of it, and as a selling point, Universal made the most of it, showing it a lot.  However, despite the excellent 3D and the awesome creature suit, the movie itself was a bit clunky in style.  The plot was forced for the most part.  The creature's rationale for coming out of the water and attacking the research assistants was just a ham-fisted means of getting the thrills started, but made no sense when you thought about it.  An annoying feature was that, every time the creature -- the ""gill man"" -- appeared, or even just his claw, it was accompanied by shrill and blaring music, the exact same refrain.  And this claw would come out of the water, just to scratch lines in the sand on the bank of the lagoon; or would come reaching into a porthole; then slowly withdraw, all the while accompanied by those strident horns.  The appearance of the claw itself was supposed to be enough for chills, and I suppose to a child, it might have been pretty exciting.  But to this adult, it looked pretty schlocky.

Also, the creature's interactions with his human co-stars were lumbering, again to the redundant shrill orchestral strains, with his claws extended in that corny horror-movie style of menace.  At the site of him, the beautiful Julie Adams would put the back of her hand to her mouth and let out a blood-curdling scream.  The screams, however, were not loud enough to drown out the obnoxious musical cues.

Still, it was fun, and I watched it a couple of times, and I even listened to the commentary.  The picture quality was awesomely clear, and there are some very interesting extra features, too, that make it worth the purchase.  From the documentary, we learn that the movie was a huge hit, and Universal had approached the ending of the film with some forethought.  They had wisely concluded the film in a way that would leave open the possibility of a sequel.  There were two sequels, actually.  I had never even heard of the third installment, one in which the creature was saved from a severe burn through extensive surgery, which led to his having his gills removed.  This meant he was condemned to a lonely existence on land.  That movie seemed like it had a lot of heart in it, leaving me with a desire to see it.

Overall, a fun disc to have.  I suppose I'll whip it out every Halloween, like I do some of my Christmas videos for the Yuletide season.

67622,4,0783245130,"While not as intelligent, thought-provoking and well made as Andersons brilliant Incredible Shrinking Man, this is still smarter and more complex than your average monster movie, especially of its era.  Interestingly, this creature is neither tragic hero, nor unstoppable villain.  Hes just a living being, a prehistoric half-man, half fish, behaving as his evolution has conditioned him, attacking invaders to his Amazonian paradise, attracted to the female human.

The film is has it's share of mind numbing exposition, mediocre acting, low production values and heavy handed staking out of its ethical positions; the humanistic scientist that wants to study and understand the creature versus the base desires of the expeditions financier who wants to kill the thing and bring it back to the world as a trophy.  But there are also sequence of power and even poetry, as the creature swims silently beneath the team's female scientist (and the film's somewhat forced eye candy).  There are moments her that Spielberg would echo in Jaws years later, but here the threat is more eerie than terrifying.  And watching the creature pathetically gasp for breath like a fish is a sad and strong image (actually, a lot of the creatures movements, especially under water, are surprisingly convincing as something other than a man in a latex suit).",1413072000,,1339,5.2046511627906975

It's a tradition at my home to watch this every year around Halloween.  It brings me back to much simpler times of my childhood of watching Creature Feature on rainy Saturday afternoons in the basement TV room.  Soon, my family will pick a Saturday afternoon in October to watch this again.  The story is good and well acted by actors who go on to pretty decent careers. Nestor Paiva (Lucas, the boat captain) pretty much steals the movie.  Ironically, probably the least good acting is a short appearance by a young unknown Clint Eastwood.  The conflict between the free-thinking-open-minded hero and The Establishment is a bit hackneyed, but doesn't get in the way of the movie.  The jiggle interest is hot.

67677,5,0783245130,"This is a hugely underestimated classic, both adventure flick and a period piece of 1950s Americana.
I have a fond spot for it because it was shot in then-unspoiled Florida, and because in 1954 Scuba diving was in its infancy-- diving was exotic and strange, only a few brave souls did it, and all the gear was WW2 surplus 'frogman' rubber suits.

Julie Adams is a knockout here -- I won't say 'in her day' because film confers immortality-- and the classic 1950s American stunner of the Smart, Adventurous Brunette. Richard Carlson is a totally stand-up guy, and treats the dangerous unknown of the lethal Creature with as much compassion and humanity as possible (given that the Creature is killing off your shipmates at an accelerating pace). None of the human characters are secretly villains, which is refreshing from a modern plot perspective.

The underwater Scuba photography is still amazing today, and was technically innovative and unprecedented at the time--the trailer's hyperbole is not all hype. This really was cutting-edge underwater photography.
The memorable water shot from below of the gorgeous Julie Adams swimming would be reproduced later by Spielberg in 'Jaws' and every other watery suspense flick since.
I always thought Russell Johnson (who also did some SF movies) modeled his 'Professor' character on 'Gilligan's Island' on Carlson's scientist character in 'Creature'-- a smart, resourceful guy doing his best in unusual circumstances.

There's everything to love about this unpretentious classic. Plus, it was the inspiration for both the overall mood and several specific individual episodes of the 1960s animated Jonny Quest series. Worth seeing for that alone.

On this DVD, there's a really excellent, enjoyable 40-minute bonus with the original cast discussing the film and the making-of. It's well worthwhile.

Love this film. And unlike most franchises, its sequels are also better than most.

Screen play by Harry Essex, Dr. Carl Maia (Antonio Moreno) finds what appears to be a fossil of an undiscovered creature in the Amazon. Soon we will realize that the creature may not be as extinct as the doctor assumed. On a return expedition we find one of the scientists is a beautiful girl Kay Lawrence (Julia Adam), ""You guessed it"" she is in a white bathing suit. The creature never stood a chance.

In the movie ""The Seven Year Itch"" (1955) Marilyn Monroe feels sorry for the creature ""He just craved a little affection""

You cannot go wrong with a Jack Arnold directed film. And Richard Carlson ""It Came From Outer Space"" (1953), is a good good-guy.

I was rooting for the Creature all the way.

I could go on, but basically, these films are an insult to intelligence and have been hyped up by teen pranksters who saw them at the theater in the 50's/60's and have been following every Creature feature convention for the last 45 years.

67944,5,0783245130,"The Creature From the Black Lagoon: The Legacy Collection is four hours and thirty - seven minutes and was released on DVD on October 19, 2004. If you are going to count all three commentaries then add another three hours and fifty - eight minutes. Film Historian Tom Weaver does a good, but not great job on all three movies. His commentary on the Creature from the Black Lagoon is the best of the three. With that one we get a more detailed perspective on what went on behind the movie. In Revenge of the Creature it is more of an interview with Lori Nelson and her life story then a commentary on the movie and Bob Burns hardly makes any comment at all. In the Creature Walks Among Us Tom Weaver and Bob Burns try to redeem themselves but for the first fifteen minutes of the movie they talk about the Creature From the Black Lagoon before the say anything about the Creature Walks Among Us. Back to the Black Lagoon was nothing more then a brief history of all three film in a nutshell. The Creature From the Black Lagoon: The Legacy Collection is a decent collection of all three Creature films but the extras do not make the cut most of the time. The Creature From the Black Lagoon: The Legacy Collection gets an A-.

DISC 1

The Creature from the Black Lagoon is one hour and nineteen minutes long and was released on March 5, 1954. The movie starts out with the creation of Earth and then goes right into the story. When scientist Dr. Carl Maia, discovers a skeletal hand with webbed fingers, he goes back to tell his friend Dr. David Reed and tells his co-scientists and a trip is launch to find more of this hand. Once in the Black Lagoon, they discover a creature living there. The crew discovers gill-man creature living in the lagoon. The crew does capture the creature, but it escapes later that night and injures Dr. Edwin Thompson who was guarding the creature at the time. Dr. David Reed decides that it is best to leave the lagoon and return when they are better equipped. Mark Williams who is the leader of the group disagrees and is out voted. The boat begins to leave the lagoon but is blocked by a giant branch put there by the Creature. While trying to get free, Mark is killed while trying to kill the Creature. Later that evening Kay is capture by the Creature and is taken to his cavern lair. The underwater shots are breath taking. I love it when Kay Lawrence is swimming in the lagoon and the Creature is trying to make a pass at her. The Creature from the Black is a great movie to own. The Creature from the Black Lagoon gets an AAAAA+++++.

DISC 2

Revenge of the Creature is one hour and twenty - one minutes long and was released in theaters on May 11, 1955. This is the second installment of the three Creature films. Basically an expedition is sent to the Black Lagoon to find and capture the creature. Lucas, the boat captain from the fist movie, returns again and the boat captain.  The crew of the Rita 2 captures the creature and brings it back to Ocean Harbor Oceanarium in Florida. The Creature is chained, prodded with electricity if it does not to what it is told, and becomes a test subject. The Creature becomes angry, escapes, goes on a rampage and captures the leading female in the picture. If you watch the first movie then you know the ending of the movie. It is just as good as the first one. Two of the actors who appeared in the first one, return again as well as the director. Nestor Paiva; Lucas the Boat Captain, Ricou Browning; underwater Gillman, and Jack Arnold; Director are the three returning people. When the movie begins, some of the scenes were taken from Creature 1. Like the first one, is has great underwater scenery that is spectacular to watch. This is one of a few great monster sequels. Look for an unaccredited Clint Eastwood as a Lab Technician. So add it to your collection. Revenge of the Creature gets an AAA+++.

The Creature Walks Among Us is one hour and eighteen minutes and released on April 26, 1956. Ricou Browning, who played the Creature in the water, is the only one to be in all three Creature movies. Another piece of trivia is Rex Reason and Jeff Morrow who stars in this movie would later be in the movie This Island Earth. The first two Creature movies were great to watch. As for this one, let just say they did not listen to some true advice: if it is not broke, don't fix it. The story is lame and gone is the great underwater scenes. Also they made the Creature a land animal and made him put on weight. The Creature Walks Among Us get a D+ for a very bad script.

67945,4,0783245130,It's just not the same as when I was a teenager.  Then I thought it was all very exciting as I had never been out of Sylvania Ohio so I didn't know there was a world outside northern Ohio and southern Michigan. Now I have worked for many years in the Amazon river area (in infectious diseases) and I loved going to the fish market and studying the various species. So when I saw the nice underwater photography and the fishes (very well done for the time) in this film. I was dismayed. I now live in Florida and could name all those fish and they weren't Amazon species. My boyhood dream collapsed. But this movie did inspire other scientists. Paleontologists recently discovered an animal from the early Carboniferous about 330 million years ago that is important in the early evolution of amphibians from fish ancestors. It is small and elicited much debate as to where it fit with other animals (it's from East Kirkton in Scotland). They finally named it: Eucritta melanolimnetes.

The real monster in the story was the Richard Denning character who was driven by blind ambition. Though Denning's character had many redeeming qualities such as physical courage, and wisdom to acquiese when he is out voted on an issue.

These three monochrome movies were produced in the mid-1950s, a time when people feared an atomic war that could destroy most of humanity. Atomic bomb testing was believed to have caused changes in the weather. One horror movie suggested this radiation could cause mutations in creatures, such as ants. When they became gigantic they would prey on mankind, coming from the Mojave Desert to then smog-free Los Angeles. Other films were variations on the horror movies from the 1930s, such as the scientific stories about invaders from outer space. These lower budget movies accompanied the Eisenhower recessions in the 1950s. There was a fad for three-dimensional films, but they required exact synchronization to prevent a blurry movie. There were a few vampire and werewolf films too. Note the changes in the actors. Were they unhappy to appear in these works of art?

""Creature From The Black Lagoon"" (1954) presented a threat from inner space, the land beneath the water. You can compare it to the classic horror story from the dark ages ""Beowulf"" which also has a monster from the lake.

""Revenge of the Creature"" (1955) continues the story. The ""gill-man"" is caught and put on display at an aquarium. But he escapes to go wandering. Finally he is found on the beach. The police shoot at him until her returns to the safety of the sea.

""The Creature Walks Among Us"" (1956) was the last of this series. The creature adapts to living on the land after capture, becomes a witness to personal conflicts, then returns to the sea. Was this as good as the other movies?

The mummy films had an unusual creature that came to life to threaten the living. These seemed better than a humanoid sea creature. Did copyright laws or a lack of an audience limit the mummy films? Vampires and werewolves existed for centuries in the legends of many countries. The formula for the horror movies is to have a strange creature come upon the people to kill and terrorize them. Then a hero is found who can kill the monster and bring peace to the people. This goes back to when Theseus slew the Minotaur, or Saint George slew a dragon, to halt human sacrifices. Do people today still believe in sacrificing humans (unemployment) to appease Moloch (the economy)?",1351814400,,2300,4.8274111675126905
67997,5,0783245130,"This is my all-time favorite horror movie and I normally watch it on Halloween Night (occassionally, Halloween Weekend); I met Julie Adams at Horrorhound Weekend in Columbus, Ohio earlier this year and thanked her for being a part of an awesome creature feature (hee-hee, shameful plug); I now have an autograph print of Kay being menaced by my fav gillman.

This was one of the earlier horror movies I saw as a kid (yet to see it in 3D; ya listenin' Universal?) and it burrowed its way deep into my dark little heart (and psyche) only to gurgle up to the surface once a year. I have old Universal glow-in-the-dark action figures of Gilly and the Mummy (I have all six of the original action figures), the Burger King run of action figures, a copy of the 1970's novelization of the movie, a Gilly bobblehead, a stuffed Universal Monsters collection, a Gilly and Kay action figure set, a couple of Gilly models, the Dark Horse trade paperback from the 1990's, a T-shirt with Gilly, a huge black+white wall print of Gilly and Kay and, of course, this precious collection of all three of Gilly's appearances. Don't tell anyone, but I'm a huge fan of the Creature from the Black Lagoon. And pretty much drained Amazon of its offerings as well. Thanks, Amazon!

Now, the awesome box set: the stark black+white looks great and the audio plays nicely in my region-free DVD, DVD-R, the CDROM on my computer and on my little portable DVD player that I bought ten years ago from Sears (I should probably review the company that made the little fella because it has held up marvelously, even after being dropped on its edge).

Other reviewers have gone into wonderful detail on Gilly's coming-out party here but I will say that The Creature from the Black Lagoon earns 5 stars all on its own; Revenge of the Creature is a nice companion piece, even though we're minus Julie Adams (WAH!), and yes, that's Clint Eastwood long before The Man With No Name and Dirty Harry and his almost-role as Two-Face on TV's Batman in the not-to-be 4th season (thanks, NBC, another game lost to narrow-minded executives); anyhoo, The Creature Walks Among Us suffers from...well...lack of Creature and too much influence by Invasion of the Body Snatchers; great for a third Creature flick, bad for a Creature fan.

In the final result, though, I watched all three in one sitting. I also paid about $18 at Best Buy for it (as well as all the other Universal Legacy box sets, Frankenstein, Dracula, The Mummy, The Wolf Man, The Invisible Man and Creature from the Black Lagoon, 3 released at a time; the Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff Collections followed)...the current prices are shameful and indicative of the unrealistic economic desires of American sellers.

As long as I live the Creature from the Black Lagoon (know how you feel about that babe that doesn't return your interest, buddy, hah!) will play every Halloween.

Great box set Universal (all of them, actully). Now, please, an official 3D edition of Creature from the Black Lagoon!",1351296000,2,3014,4.753346080305928
67998,4,0783245130,"In comparison to the 1931 version of Dracula, this movie is significantly better - amazing how much more developed movies were in 1954...did bigger reels have anything to do with it? The acting is far more credible although I see that both movies end abruptly as soon as the fiend is dead...what gives?! I can see why the creature keeps chasing after Julie Adams...not a bad decision on his part - she must have been at the apex of her career :)",1350777600,,445,4.439024390243903
68019,4,0783245130,"One of few truly great ""creature"" films, 1954's THE CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON is a surprisingly effective horror film concerning a scientific expedition up the Amazon to investigate an unusual fossil find--but instead of fossils the crew members encounter an underwater creature of considerable intelligence that is bent on their destruction.

The story is a bit dated by modern standards, but the cast (particularly Richard Carlson, Julie Adams, and Richard Denning) is effective, and the creature is easily one of Universal Studio's most memorable creations. Seen today in standard black and white, the film is quite enjoyable. But it doesn't hold a candle to the original 3-D format, which I was fortunate to see not once but twice during the 1970s and 1980s. Simply stated, BLACK LAGOON's cinematography was probably the best of all 3-D movies to date. As with most 3-D films, there is plenty of ""coming at you"" cinematography, and many viewers will be able to pick out such moments when seeing the film in standard black and white--but in addition to these, the film used 3-D in a remarkably subtle way; virtually every scene in the film is designed for 3-D, and the effect is exceptionally memorable in the underwater sequences.

Unfortunately, the two sequels to THE CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON are increasingly ho-hum.  1955's REVENGE OF THE CREATURE concerns the capture of the creature, who is transported to a Florida ""sea-world"" style venue where it can be both studied and shown to the public.  The script is unimpressive and the cast (including John Agar and Lori Nelson) is not as strong.  This film was also shot, but rarely shown, in 3-D.  The final film in the series, 1956's THE CREATURE WALKS AMONG US is little more than tiresome, with a cast so unimpressive that it need not be mentioned at all.

THE LEGACY COLLECTION presents all three of the films.  CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON includes an audio commentary and making of documentary, both very entertaining and informative.  The other two films include audio commentaries which are about as interesting as the films themselves.  Recommended for classic horror fans, but frankly you'd do better to buy the original film on its own and skip the sequels.

68021,5,0783245130,"This is the first of the Legacy series I've seen. In the 60's, I remember seeing Famous Monster calendars and the like featuring the great monsters including the Creature. I'm glad I watched this series.

Some of the reviewers bemoan this was 2-D instead of the original 3-D. For me, these movies came out before I was born, so I don't remember the 3-D features. They were very interesting even as 2-D.

One highlight, besides the commentary, is the preview footage. There are several versions of the original as well as the previews of the sequels.

My opinion is the first was by far the best. Some of the negative reviews bemoan the acting. I disagree. The cast was a well-defined contrasting types of characters, and the ship captain especially were entertaining. I consider it one of the best horror movies I've seen.

""The Revenge of the Creature"" is a step down quality-wise. The captain returns. But to me, there is a lot of filler. Scenes of interesting animals such as a chimp and rats in the lab or dolphins in the aquarium. A love triangle. The hero making a speech to the police officers. The high points were great but even for one hour twenty minutes it seemed overlong. The final one, ""The Creature Walks Among Us,"" is proof why there wasn't a fourth movie -- they took the idea as far as they could.

One reason I'm giving the collection five stars is that there is a message to this series, which I would call more science horror than straight horror -- like the Alien series, this is a science fiction story. The humans in the first movie were fairly likeable, for the most part. However, in the second even the hero and heroine contributed to the mistreatment of the creature. The final movie was more direct in its theme that ""civilized man"" is not much more humane than savage beasts, or maybe even less.

One strength is that the Creature is clearly not evil. You can feel sympathy for him. This is true in the first movie where there wasn't really the message the latter movies had.",1334448000,,2006,4.558333333333334

68023,4,0783245130,"""Creature from the Black Lagoon: The Legacy Collection"" brings together the original 1954 movie with its 1955 and 1956 sequels, ""Revenge of the Creature"" and ""The Creature Walks Among Us."" The collection includes a fascinating documentary, commentary, and three theatrical trailers.

The first movie introduced an iconic movie monster, the Creature. A scientific expedition, deep in the Amazon River backwaters, seeks a fossil linking humans and fish. At the remote and mysterious Black Lagoon, they stumble on the Creature, a hybrid gill-man at home in the water. The scientists attempt to capture the Creature, only to discover they have become the prey of an angry monster. The creature will target the beautiful Kay (Julie Adams), fiancee of leading scientist and hero David (Richard Carlson). The movie featured an exciting story, including suggestive interaction between the Creature and Kay, along with ground-breaking underwater photography and the unique costume of the Creature itself.

The two sequels narrate the unhappy adventures of the Creature after he is captured and placed in a marine wildlife park, and then after he is modified by surgery to live among humans on land. The two movies have their moments, although they never quite achieve the high standards of the original; they are likely to be of most interest to horror movie die-hards. The excellent documentary ""Back to the Black Lagoon"" features commentary by actress Julie Adams, the two original Creature actors, and film historians about how the movie was made. ""The Legacy Collection"" is highly recommended to horror movie fans.",1331510400,,1609,5.355731225296442

68026,5,0783245130,"Fifty three years ago I watched the Creature From The Black Lagoon for the first time on my 5th birthday. As a birthday present my dad would drag out his Bell and Howell projector and put in the reel of The Creature From The Black Lagoon film. Every birthday as my first present the family watched the picture. I watched it each birthday from age 5 to 17. Age 18 I went to college. The movie was great I enjoyed every minute of it. Sad to say I never watched it in 3D. Other reviewers have said the 3D version was great.

Two years ago I found the old projector in my parent's house after my parents had passed away but could not find the reel of The Creature From The Black Lagoon. I'm so glad that the old original TCFTBL was put on this Legacy collection DVD. It brings back so many happy memories of my family and I celebrating my birthdays with the Creature.

The Legacy DVD collection was great. This B/W DVD had great both visual and audio. I can't complain about anything! The acting, plot and directing were superb but the best INMO was the Creature. The full body rubber suit of the Creature was fantastic and super state of the art for early 1950s. Look at those horrible eyes, gills and clawed webbed hands and big feet! The Creature is seen effortlessly back swimming underwater looking up intently at the beautiful woman swimmer on the surface. You can see it is just iching to reach up and grab her. I pity the man inside the hot rubber suit on land in a hot/humid Florida day. The set was in Fl in the springs about 40 miles from where my family and I live today.

As a youngster I was always for the Creature and cheered when it got away out of the net and escaped in the Black Lagoon in the Amazon. Years later I realised this film was similar to King Kong as ""beauty killed the beast"". Both creatures were attracted to a beautiful woman and this led to their downfall. Like I said I have never seen TCFTBL in 3D. I can imagine the spear gun shots underwater at the Creature must have been great as well as the creature walking with his arms out right into the camera. Must have terrorized the little kids in the 50s (in a nice way).

Just shows everyone a great monster/horror movie can be made with NO 4 letter words, sex and nudity, disgusting graphic scenes like peoples heads getting sawed off like in some of today's horror movies. These graphic kinds of PG13 or worse ...horror/monster maybe OK for the older crowed ( I have no interest watching some cruelty like someones head getting cut off by a chainsaw or worse) but INMO NOT for a 5 year old. TCFTBL was the kind of movie you could let your 5 year old enjoy and the rest of the family would enjoy it too. The violence is directed to an inhuman horrible monster and visa versa...not human to human. I LOVED this movie on my birthdays age 5 -17. I weeped every time the creature got spear gunned and shot. I bawled my eyes out when the Creatures lifeless form drifts over the edge of the underwater cliff into deeper water.

Maybe someone can please verify this for me. The scene where the creature is holding the unconscious woman in  its arms in the cavern passageway... was she truely unconscious? I heard from numerous people the actor playing the Creature bopped the woman's head accidentally on the side of the rocks and the director liked the authentic unconsciousness so much he kept the cameras rolling. True or false?...or is this just a myth.

I have never seen the Creature's Revenge or The Creature Walks Among Us. This DVD was great with these 2 bonus DVDs. Each was in B/W . The visual and audio were great. Great plots, acting and again the Creature stole the show. 3 cheers for the Creature. Again the Creature is attracted to good looking women and tries to capture them. I was so mad at the scientists trying to make the creature more human by making him use his lungs instead of his gills so they can have something to study for humankind going into outer space..Now it can't breath underwater and escapes and kills the mental wacko doctor that imprisons him. Again the Creature is attracted to a good looking woman. They even cloth the creature. I felt bad when the Creature kills the graduate student woman's German Shepard dog. The dog was only trying to protect the woman. Bad,bad Creature. All 3 movies as a collection INMO are in the top 5 monster/horror movies of all time and each movie is a 5 star movie!

There are bonus trailers of the movies as well as commentary and an original documentary Back to the Black Lagoon. This is a superb Legacy collection to pass down to your kids and their kids. Rated 5 stars plus.",1325808000,13,4625,4.401169590643275

68135,5,0783245130,"This release from Universal's ""Legacy Collection"" is the only one I own from the series, yet if the other entries are as good as this, this is a collection well worth seeking out.

Before ordering this set, my only recollection of the ""Creature"" was a 3-D television broadcast of one of one of these movies from many, many years ago (when I was too young to recollect anything other than the cool monster with the gills).  When I ordered this set, I was afraid that as formerly 3-D movies, a 2-D presentation would be filled to the gills (sorry) with distracting ""coming at ya"" effects.  Rest assured, these movies work equally well in a mere two dimensional format.

I enjoyed the movies very much, despite a title monster that isn't really all that powerful (okay, he flips a car over in one scene, but for the most part he seems most threatening when tickling the feet of unaware swinmming women).  Nevertheless, the atmosphere works well, especially in the first movie's slow exploration of the Amazon (river, not the online retailer).

As a side note, I braced for the worst after reading a few reviews for the second movie in the series -- ""Revenge of the Creature"".  It was actually a briskly paced adventure that was pretty entertaining.  Watch it, if for no other reason then to play ""spot Clint Eastwood's bit part"".",1212019200,,1326,4.685344827586207
68136,5,0783245130,"This review is actually a series of posts I made on a bulletin board...

Normally when you watch one of these movies as a kid you want the monster to live, but the Creature was so disturbing I was torn as a child. A part of me felt bad for him, but another part just wanted him to die.

Watching him eat the fish out of the trap freaked me out as a kid, because he was so relaxed in that scene you really thought he lived in that lagoon.

I'm stunned by how well this film was made. First off, they got most of the science right, which may not sound like a big deal, but 99% of the time Hollywood just makes up stuff that sounds believable and lets remember this was made in the 1950's! There were a few things they got wrong, such as saying the lagoon had been the same way for millions of years, which goes against basic geology, but I think science had different theories back then as well.

The story is thought out; the dialogue is well written, and as hideous as the creature might be he's still a sympathetic character. I am incredibly impressed. I have heard the original two Frankenstein movies received similar reviews and will now want to see those next.

It's interesting watching these films again as an adult. Since they're genuinely well made you grow to have a different sort of appreciation for them that goes beyond, but includes, the monsters.

I just finished watching the third in the trilogy, THE CREATURE WALKS AMONG US.

All I have to say is... OH MY GOD!!! These were a great set of films. I'm stunned.. Having not seen any of these films since about the age of 10 I found myself experiencing several flashbacks. While watching the second film, THE CREATURE'S REVENGE, I was brought back to my 9 year old self sitting alone in the living room horrified as the scientist walked around the pool of water trying to revive the creature. I remember thinking, ""Oh my God, he's touching it. How can he do that??? Why isn't he scared?  It's disgusting and when it wakes up he won't have time to get out of the way and it's going to kill him!!!

At least that's what I remember thinking.

THE CREATURE WALKS AMONG US is the last film. It always bothered the living hell out of me when they tried to make him human and now even as an adult I find myself really disliking the scientist who thought it would be scientific research to cut up the Creature, making him not the Creature any more.

The best part of the movie: Any time the Creature is swimming. It's still creepy as all hell, and the underwater scenes are beautifully shot. This really is amazing for 1954-1956

The Worst part: Any time they suddenly show the creature and that same set of trumpets blow the exact same pattern in an effort to startle everyone.

I really enjoyed BACK TO THE BLACK LAGOON. The documentary was a nice addition tot he set. Go order this set. It is well worth the price of admission.",1210032000,5,2887,4.3638059701492535
68137,3,0783245130,"When I first saw this film as an eight year old at my brother's urging one dark night in 1954 I had no idea what I was going to see.  For me it was a grand five star experience as I had never witnessed a 3D movie before.  Technically, the 3D presentation was excellent as the LUXOR theater of the old Bronx had a very competent projectionist who must have taken great pains and some pride in his work. There were none of the usual 3D flaws or headaches, no parallax problems, and no blurring resulting in excellent alignment of the two images to form one 3D effect for the viewer.  As much of the film was shot beneath the water these 3D images were all the more effective.

However, when I watch it now the only thing I can honestly say is that the Creature full body garment is the only thing that continues to fascinate me.  Lost in the sands of time are the effective 3D presentation and of course the novelty and magic of that first time ever event.

The story is simple, and somewhat limited, but serves as a perfectly adequate background for this rare treat from Universal Studios. I can only rate the story 3 and 1/2 or perhaps 4 stars, but as an 8 year old would have rated it a 5 star film.  If they could one day release it on some future HDTV format which includes the full 3D impact of my original screening I would love to own it at any price.

68166,4,0783245130,"I bought this DVD set primarily for the original Creature From the Black Lagoon (not its sequels which are less impressive) and for the documentary on its making.  And it is worth purchasing on those terms alone.  The sequels have their moments...but nothing as cool as that moment in the original with Julie Adams swimming in the Amazon while the creature approaches from below the surface.
  Creature is often lumped in with Dracula and Frankenstein as a Universal Horror film, but this was made a couple decades after them.  And to be honest I'm not a fan of the 30s films.  With their crude audio and fake rubber bats I just cannot suspend my disbelief for them.
  But wait.  Isn't the Creature just a guy in an amphibian suit?
  Well yeah, but there's just something about the Creature.  He was a pretty extravagant looking creature for a 3-D B-movie.
  The movie has a few shortcomings but is still rightfully recognized as a monster movie classic.  The documentary owns up to the fact that the creature theme was pretty repetitive in early parts of the film where that scaly hand reaches out of the water. (Da-Da-DUM).
  But for my money, Creature is actually a better written and acted (if not directed) film than the Howard Hawks version of The Thing.
  Richard Carlson is a sympathetic scientist and Julie Adams, his love interest and collegue, brings much more appeal than the lead couple in The Thing.  There.  I said it.
  This movie is still pretty enjoyable after all these years.  It delivers a good old horror movie fix and I recommend it to all old school horror fans (and who isn't).",1184025600,2,1602,4.659498207885305

All of the ""living"" characters including the creature actors are interviewed. Great job Universal! The overall quality to the actual transfer for the first disc is superb. The print used was in good condition for a movie that old. The Creature walks among us was also tranferred with very good quality but the ""Revenge of the Creature"" sucks! The compression is very noticable. Shame on Universal for not placing this great movie on a third disc in this otherwise great collection. Instead they tried to fit both movies on the second disc. Naturally there are few bonus features which is understandable. But why sacrifice the quality??? Guys some of us don't want to be reminded about quality throughout the length of a movie. The culprit is the clown that walked into the executives offices and said hey I can fit 2 movies on one disc. Using what is referred to as ""VBR"" (variable bit rate) will only compress areas that are redundant in the picture and professes to be un-noticable to the viewer...BULL!!! judge for selves.

The Creature has a simple plan. Kill the men and keep the woman. To their credit, when the crew figures this out, they try to get away as quickly as possible.

68224,4,0783245130,"In a way, I'm quite glad that every attempt to remake this movie has failed to materialize; were Universal to remake it now, it would be a neo-slasher crap fest laced with nothing but screaming teenagers and a totally unsympathetic gore factory of a monster.  And while there are purists out there who may claim that the Gill Man doesn't really belong in the company of the other clssic Universal Monsters, the truth is that ""The Creature From The Black Lagoon"" IS the last great Universal monster movie.  What's more, its sequels actually aren't as bad as others may want you to believe, particularly since they do accomplish the rare task of telling a different story in each entry - more than the ""Jaws"" sequels could manage - and as the central sympathetic character of each piece, the Creature himself does show significant character development over the course of three movies without degenerating into the high-camp approach that has since destroyed the likes of Jason Vorhees and Freddy Krueger.

DISC ONE:

CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON

Where better to start than the beginning?  You probably know the drill: a group of scientists - one of whom happens to look particularly gorgeous in a white bathing suit - putters down the Amazon in search of the fossils of a 'missing link' between man and fish, only to find the living truth hiding out in a forgotten tributary.  And it becomes clear that the Gill Man wants only two things: female companionship and solitude from everybody else.  The plot pretty standard sci-fi fare for the 1950s (and earlier when you consider the first two movies are naught but a submerged remake of 'King Kong', but more on that later), but it's the execution of it that sets CFTBL above all other contenders of the era.

Under the expert direction of Jack Arnold, the cast is up to their task - as Kay Lawrence, Julia (Julie) Adams does sufficient acting to convince us she could have some scientific prowess despite her excellent screaming ability and great legs; Richard Carlson does another capable job of playing a scientist-hero type - something he was known for in '50s sci-fi - as Kay's fiance David Reed; Richard Denning makes a great antagonistic figure in the form of David and Kay's boss Mark Williams; and Nestor Paiva provides comic relief as Lucas, the eccentric captain of the RITA.  Then, of course, there's the 'star', or rather both of him: Ben Chapman is the man inside the monster suit - with the slickest and most iconic monster design of the '50s - while topside, with Ricou Browning playing the Gill Man beneath the waves, a role he would reprise for the two sequels.

Filled with equal measures of emotional resonance, textbook dialogue and good old-fashioned shivers - accompanied by one of the most surprisingly functional 'patchwork' music scores ever produced - CFTBL is unquestionably the best monster movie of the '50s, and one of the best sci-fi movies of that time.

BONUS FEATURES

Considering how few who were involved in making this movies are still around today, Universal does an impressive job assembling its resources for the bonus features:

* The documentary ""Back To The Black Lagoon"", by film historian and Universal monster aficionado David Skal, provides some intriguing insights into the making of the Gill Man trilogy, including such revelations as:

- The studio's original vision for the look of the Gill Man, and what they intended to do with that look after it was scrapped.

- The real makers of the Gill Man - including concept artist Milicent Patrick and sculptors Chris Mueller and Jack Keban.

- Comical anecdotes of on-set mishaps involving an eyebrow-raising trade-paper photo and a man-eating sea turtle.

- The principle behind the 3-D in which the first two movies were filmed, and the truth behind why the fad faded so quickly.

- Discussion about subtexts and implications in the films, and the progression of the Gill Man as a character.

* Audio commentary by film historian Tom Weaver, whose laborious dialogue drowns out the rest of the movie yet still provides ever more tantalizing details into the making of the films - as he himself admits early on, he does have much more to say and short running times to do it in. Through these commentaries you learn such interesting little tidbits as what role Orson Welles played in the genesis of the Gill Man, and how the first two Gill Man movies resemble a certain classic movie about a giant ape.

* Theatrical trailers for the first film, which when watched back-to-back, as they're presented, can get a little tiresome since most of the trailers contain the same rehashed footage and voiceover.

DISC TWO:

REVENGE OF THE CREATURE

A year has passed, and some more pretty confident scientists decide to capture the Gill Man and bring him back to civilization and put him on display in a marine life park, where he's observed by a beautiful blond icthyologist. I don't think I need to explain the rest.

Needless to say, with a plot like that, you can safely assume none of the characters from the original film are going to make any return appearances, except for, of course, the comic relief, Nestor Paiva, and then for a cameo.  Still, John Agar as professor Clete Ferguson and Lori Nelson as icthyologist Helen Dobson do make a cute scientist couple, with John Bromfield playing the obligatory macho shark-wrangler type/monster fodder Joseph Hayes.  And there are two other very notable cameos - one a topside appearance by Ricou Browning as a lab tech, the other a comical appearance by a young Clint Eastwood.  Tom Hennessey is the topside Gill Man this outing, with Browning back in the suit for underwater shots.

Like most sequels, ROTC has its flaws, to be sure - one scene involves some visibly-imperfect wire work for one of the Gill Man's victims, and for some reason the sculptors gave the classic Gill Man design a pair of ping-pong-ball monster eyes, possibly for visibility purposes for the actors.  But given the act it had to follow, ROTC is actually pretty worthwhile...especially when you consider that this DID get remade by Universal, sort of, as ""Jaws 3"".  You figure out which one you'd rather watch.

THE CREATURE WALKS AMONG US

Fitting that for the last Gill Man movie, the Gill Man be forcibly removed from the undersea environment he's at home in - this time by being doused in kerosene and flames by the dunderheaded assistant of obsessive scientist William Barton (Jeff Morrow), who's determined to reshape the Gill Man into a land-lubber - we never do find out why - just as much as he's determined to make a complete subordinate out of his disillusioned child-bride wife Marcia (Leigh Snowden).  Once again, a nobler scientific mind enters the equation, Tom Morgan (Rex Reason), and his rescue of the Gill Man from certain death, combined with the Gill Man's affinity for the opposite sex regardless of species, prove advantageous for Tom and Marcia when Dr. Barton begins eyeing those eyeing his wife with murder on his mind.

A lot of 'fans' don't like this movie, but I do.  It solidifies the two overall themes of the Gill Man movies - that humankind is its own worst enemy, and that the Gill Man must deal with a world in which he doesn't belong.  The chemistry between the human characters closely resembles that of the first film - one scientific philosophy that suggests we could benefit spiritually from what we learn, whereas another takes the path of benefitting materially from knowledge - and surprisingly, this time out the beast doesn't make a beeline for the beauty, although he does acknowledge her - maybe the Gill Man is just tired of having his heart broken.  The land-locked Gill Man is played by Don Megowan, with the character's look radically altered as the result of being burned (a plot device re-used by Universal in ""Jaws 2"" to cheesier effect) - heck, they even put him in clothes! And Ricou Browning does make one final appearance as the submerged Gill Man, with the aid of stock footage from the first two films.

All in all, TCWAU does tie up the story pretty effectively, if not necessarily happily - the last scene of the picture is pretty sad - and with any luck Universal won't besmirch what is a good trilogy of films with a crappy trend-driven remake.

BONUS FEATURES

* More audio commentary by Tom Weaver, joined by Bob Burns for ROTC and TCWAU, and Lori Nelson on ROTC.  It's fun to hear shared stories among the group, particularly Ms. Nelson talking about her film career and Burns sharing stories from members of the production team, so these commentaries are a lot less tight than that of the first film.

* More theatrical trailers, which are always a hoot, particularly the trailer for ROTC.

The bottom line: if you like your monster-movie series waterlogged, don't waste your time with the ""Jaws"" sequels.  Universal got it right back in the '50s, and this is the proof.  Buy this set, by cracky!",1148083200,127,8934,4.794654498044329

In the original ""Creature"" we were treated with the illusion of the ""Amazon"" even though most of the footage was filmed in Silver Springs, FL.

The Revenge of the Creature is by far my favorite.  I am fortunate to have been a volunteer for Marineland of Florida and to have dived in the very tank that restrained The Gill man himself.  If you watch closely, they missed covering one of the signs on the oceanarium during the first portion after he was delivered there!  It now lays in wait for destruction, destitute of the water and abundant marine life that is showcased in this film.  But through this film, I can always keep my memories fresh.  The Revenge also shows many prominent Florida landmarks that made the ""Florida experience"" for vacationers of the 50's memorable.

The Creature Walks Among Us signifies the decline of the Gill man era.  They tried to make him look more human than he should have been by changing the eyes.

The behind the scenes commentary by original actors leads great insight to what it was like to be a B movie film star of the 50's and how these movies became legendary.

68243,5,0783245130,"For the past two years, the Universal Legacy Collection has put out some of the greatest movies on DVD. Among the valued treasures are those that belong in the genre of classic horror. Please, if you want to enjoy a small, though significant, part of the Legacy, then purchase and watch the Creature from the Black Lagoon trilogy. You will be entertained from a variety of perspectives.

For instance, one can easily derive campy humor from one scene to the next, especially with the sometimes cheesy special effects that accompany the recurring asinine dialogue throughout. As a case in point, there is a moment in Revenge of the Creature, where after a young college student is grabbed by the Creature and is thrown in midair, the student's body dips about six inches before briefly defying gravity only to rise and suddenly crash into a tree headfirst and die. Though I, myself, cannot recall seeing this kind of flaw in any other movie, there are other scenes prevalent that would give a whole new meaning to the somewhat nowadays obsolete term, trick photography.

Along with the humor and the sometimes hilarious visual phenomena, the attempt at a science fiction storyline is also a delight, though laughable from the standpoint of a marine or evolutionary biologist. However, the mere idea of creating a missing link between fish and man did, after all, spawn at least these three motion pictures. The Creature was, in sum, one of the very few onscreen entities that could either permanently live on land or underwater (at least in the first two motion pictures, where it still had both lungs and gills).

All in all, one will not have to look hard to understand or enjoy the plots or sequences to fully enjoy this DVD collection. Though none of the motion pictures is an outright masterpiece or fully epitomizes the presentation of what is suited for a thinking person, the Creature from the Black Lagoon Legacy Collection is, nevertheless, an altogether fun kind of packaging that one will repeatedly watch, especially when it is time to entertain kids who want to see monster movies during Halloween.",1134345600,,2111,4.891061452513966
68244,4,0783245130,"As one of the six ""Legacy"" collections featuring the popular Universal monsters, the Creature set has some distinctly unique features.  In one way, it's the sparsest collection, with only three movies, but it also is the only one with commentaries on all the films.  Perhaps more importantly is the nature of the Creature himself.  While the other monsters are either purely supernatural (Dracula, the Wolf Man), purely man-made (Frankenstein's monster, the Invisible Man) or a combination of the two (the Mummy), only the Creature is a natural creature.

What also stands out in the Creature movies is that humanity in general comes off as the bad guys and the Creature is the most sympathetic figure.  Acting in a generally defensive manner, the Creature is subjected to greater and greater torments.  He actually is similar in this fashion to King Kong (which is not surprising, since the first two movies, when combined, are essentially remakes of that giant ape classic).

As is typically the case, the first movie - The Creature from the Black Lagoon - is the best in the bunch.  Several scientists - as well as the essential female love interest - go to South America in search of the bones of a legendary fish-man, only to find a living one instead.  The Creature develops an interest in the woman even as it wages war with the intruders in its Black Lagoon, leading to several deaths before the final confrontation.

In Revenge of the Creature, the Creature is captured and brought to a marine amusement park, where it is chained up, studied and displayed for the masses.  (In both this movie and the third one, there is a lot of confusion between salt-water and fresh water life, with the Creature forced to alternate between the two.)  A la King Kong, eventually, he breaks free and goes on a rampage.  While this film is most noted for the screen debut of Clint Eastwood, this is actually only of minor significance:  Eastwood is in the movie for only a minute, playing a very atypical role as an inept lab assistant.

In the third movie - The Creature Walks Among Us - the Creature is captured again but seriously burned in the process.  The process to save him forces him to be a land creature, and this once mighty creature of the Amazon is forced to live in the San Francisco Bay area, unable to be master of the water anymore.

The 1950s were not great years in science fiction/horror film making, but the Creature movies, despite their flaws, are some of the best of the era, with a decent costume for the monster and reasonably good effects.  Just as it was influenced by King Kong, you can see the clear influence these movies had on others, in particular, Jaws.  For Universal, this would be the last of their iconic monsters, and unlike the others, it has not been subject to any remakes.

This very fine 1950s horror flick offers believable characters, heart-pounding excitement and some excellent (UN-ENHANCED) underwater cinematography.  For me, the gem of this film is Julie Adams, the curvaceous brunette who stirs the creature's loins.  Ahem.

The still photo gallery of production and publicity shots is not to be missed.

The two sequels are convincing enough--and the second movie's female lead is just as desirable as the first's--and although they lack the shock value of the original (we've already seen the creature and what it's capable of), they nonetheless convey the timeless conflict of man versus nature.

Lastly--and very unexpectedly--all three movies adroitly refer to the dawning Space Age as the primary motivation for the scientists' obsession with the creature.

68267,5,0783245130,"The 'Black Lagoon Set', like the rest of the Creature Feature Legacy Collections released by Universal, is an excellent value. The quality of the re-master and subsequent transfer to DVD is stellar. The audio tracks (originally mono-stereo wasn't invented until 1956) have been mixed into two-channel stereo, and they shine. Anyone able to do so should run the sound through audio equipment rather than the (normally poor) speakers on their television. If the set-up is done properly the sound image that forms around a TV is flawless. The quality of these tracks (as is the case with a huge number of older films) will be a revelation.

This set contains the usual array of special features. All of the theatrical trailers are included. Because the original feature was shot in 3-D there are a variety of trailers for it. The trailers (which haven't been re-mastered) are in good condition (likely because these films were made more recently than those in the other sets). Ricou Browning, Ben Chapman, Julie Adams and Lori Nelson lent their memories and insights to an interesting feature about the history and the making of the series. The stories they tell are a joy to listen to. There's an array of photos from the original productions on the first DVD and audio commentaries that have been added as a second soundtrack to each of the films. Those are interesting but will be for purists only.

The Creature from the Black Lagoon ****

The first of the series is a classic, and rightly so; it holds up well, even after more than fifty years. The story is a good one. The scenes are edited together well and the film almost never bogs down. The acting is above average by the standards normal for the genre at that time. The look of the creature was (and still is) excellent. The underwater sequences were staged and shot brilliantly. They still hold up well. The film's hierarchy of characters and the way it's set up for the story is particularly striking. There really isn't an individual who is clearly evil. Even the creature is just depicted as defending his home. In this case it's man that's shown as the interloper, a stance that was rarely taken back then.

The film has some limitations though, most of which are to do with the period in which it was shot. Some of the props look like props. Wires that shouldn't show sometimes do. The pecking order as to which characters will be creature-fodder painfully obvious. The scenes that were set against filmed backdrops are easily spotted. Julia Adams screams well (and looks great) but if it weren't for being the object of fascination for the Gill-man her role would just be window dressing. Her wardrobe is also far too stylish for the setting of the film (though thankfully the producers stopped short of having her wear high-heeled shoes).

These points don't prevent the picture from being enjoyed. The best moments in the film are still capable of suspending belief and the Gill-Man is still an intriguing character. This is a movie that should be accepted and enjoyed on its own terms.

Revenge of the Creature **

If the plot of the first film was 'scientists trip over creature and terror ensues' then the sequel is 'scientists capture creature and terror ensues'. The wrath of the beast is fearsome and (except for one glaring flub) the action scenes are done well but that's where the good things end. The acting is either over the top or uninspired and much of the dialogue is terrible. It's just a rehash of the original release; easily the weakest of the three pictures.

But watch for the first ever screen appearance by Clint Eastwood.

The type of silliness that led to Ashlee Simpson's recent song-without-lip-movement incident has been inherent in the industry for a long time and is displayed boldly here. In a pair of scenes where she she's clad in dark clothing Lori Nelson appears to be wearing either a corset or some kind of torso encasing girdle. In one of them she's cinched up so tight she looks uncomfortable just trying to walk. If this was the case the idea was a stupid one. Nelson had a lovely (and trim) figure. She didn't need it placed in a restraining harness.

Dumb, dumb, dumb ...

The Creature Walks Among Us ***

The development of the character of the Gill-Man takes some huge steps in this film. The performance given by Don Megowan is a thoughtful one and he creates a character that's both sympathetic but still intimidating. The capture, scientific alteration and subsequent subjugation is approached in a thoughtful manner as well. The film blurs lines and directly questions which side is bad, good, and even right or wrong.

It's hampered by some bad acting, and, also by its own good intentions. The subplot that's used to blur the lines is a decent one but the execution is awful. Dialogue ranges between stiff and trite and the acting could have come from out-takes of failed auditions. Jeff Morrow and Leigh Snowden give the best performances of the group but their limitations show quickly. Rex Reason and Gregg Palmer are just plain bad. Ultimately, these segments read like a daytime soap (and a bad one at that). As well, the climatic moment of the film is hampered by some poorly executed special effects. The wires aren't supposed to show. Sheesh!

It's too bad. This could have been the best film of the series.",1107734400,8,5333,4.751351351351351

However, they are all classics, indicative of a time when the imagination (and not the senses, i.e., visual) fed one's fears.  Of course, this isn't to say that the special effects weren't outstanding for the day, something that the special features of this set take great pains to point out.  And, the wonderful innocence of early horror films set aside, the special features are part of what make this set so spectacular.  Despite the fact that the 3-D versions are not preserved, after hearing about 3-D in the special features, one doesn't feel the loss.

Fortunately I have a widescreen television and can ""matt"" the picture for aspect ratio proper, but anamorphic enhancement would've been better. Reviewers have stated you can see telephone wires in ""Creature"" and a changing clock time in the nightclub climax in ""Revenge"" as ""bloopers"", but when matted, they disappear - director Jack Arnold knew what he was doing. One improvement in the ""Creature"" costume in the first sequel is you can see his eyes underwater, one of the few flaws in the first one (and as seen on this DVD's cover). Menu design is low-key and menacing, we hear gurgling and muffled roars in the background of atmospheric still images of the three films. As a kid, it was always a tossup whether I liked the first or second film better, as they followed the same plot structure, with the third a distant disappointment. Now, I appreciate ""Creature Walks"" way better, the best underwater photography, a compelling adult film noir that ranks better than the second and as good (or better) than the first!",1105920000,2,1309,4.874439461883408

Sadly, unlike the other Legacy sets that have at least more than three movies on them, this collection has fewer films (three of them). But I guess you can do more with Dracula, Frankenstein, etc. than you can with a Gill Man eh? Anyways, my point is you are paying the same amount of money for this set as you are the other sets; and this one has the fewest films out of the entire collection. And really, that's my only gripe with this collection. Otherwise, we get plenty of extras on here including commentaries and a very neat history on the Creature movies and what impact they had on moviegoers in the 50s. Definitely a set worth buying for ANY monster fan!

The Creature from the Black Lagoon: An all-time classic no doubt! Although there are goofy scenes, the film does succeed on many levels including acting. One of the more intriguing Universal monster films and the best of the Creature series. 5/5

Revenge of the Creature: As much as I enjoy this film, it is pretty dull when compared to the first. But one, unless you are a person who loves to compare things, will most likely not think too much about the first film when viewing this; making it more enjoyable. The romance in here is not very interesting to say the least and, quite frankly, I found it to be stealing time away from the Gill Man. Overall, not as good as the first but still entertaining. 3.5/5

The Creature Walks Among Us: Definitely the oddest one of the three. Though don't let that deter you from it. I, personally, found the story better than the second film and possibly a strong contender against the first one. Not to mention the science in the film, I think, is very interesting. The problem I have with is that the Creature looks like a fish version of Frankenstein's monster with bland clothing and a big burly body. Sadly, the Gill Man probably shows up the least in this film when compared to the other two. But the story will keep you entertained and interested.

However, I'm willing to make allowances based on the fact that there's really not a whole lot of 3-D product out there. No, my complaint is based on Universal's having released the set in the wrong aspect ratio; the releases are presented full-frame, despite the theatrical releases' having been shot (and exhibited) widescreen (naysayers can confirm by checking out DVD Savant's review). Would it have been so much trouble to have released nice, correctly cropped, anamorphic prints, especially since they would have cost no more to produce than pan-and-scan?

68293,5,0783245130,"""The Creature from the Black Lagoon"" is certainly a B-movie, but that does not stop it from being a great 1950s monster movie.  At the core of this film is one of the coolest ""rubber suit"" monsters of all time.  The creature was the last of the Universal monsters and whereas the rest of the pantheon was getting recycled in monster mashes like ""The Ghost of Frankenstein,"" here was something refreshingly different in several key regards.  ""The Creature from the Black Lagoon"" was set in an entirely different locale.  Instead of dealing with castles and haunted houses in Europe we are looking at a boat sailing up the Amazon River.  Instead of the monster appearing out of the mist, this one suddenly appears out of the murky water.  Think about it: instead of things happening horizontally they are now happening vertically.  In the jungle the danger usually comes from above, but this time it appears from below.  Because it is a hot day in the steamy Amazonian jungle instead of a cold European night, the damsel in distress gets to wear a simple but compelling white bathing suit.

But even dressed in such attire she is not as compelling as the creature, whose costume was designed by Milicent Patrick.  Jack Pierce's legendary makeup for Boris Karloff's monster in ""Frankenstein"" is still the high water mark for such things and the makeup and costume for ""The Mummy"" was awesome, but neither of those was a rubber suit like what we have here.  This is just a great design of a humanoid creature with major fish-like elements.  Ben Chapman was the Gill-Man, as the creature was called, when he was out of water and Ricou Browning for the underwater sequences.  Director Jack Arnold took things so seriously that Browning had to hold his breath for up to four minutes during those underwater shots because any bubbles he emitted would not go out through the gills like they would on a real Gill-Man.  Plus, cinematographer William E. Snyder gives us excellent shots both above and below the water: this movie knows they have a great suit and they show it off for all it is worth.  I mean, come on, Gort is kewl, but that costume is as simplistic as the creature's is complex and it ain't made of rubber, so there.

The story of this 1954 film, which I first saw in a theater decades later in the 3-D format, begins when Dr. Carl Maia (Antonio Moreno) discovers a fossilized hand with webbing between its fingers.  While he returns to civilization to announce his discovery and put together another expedition with American scientists the creature destroys the camp and kills the natives.  Returning back up the river are David Reed (Richard Carlson), Dr. Mark Williams (Richard Denning), Dr. Thompson (Whit Bissell), and the lovely Kay (Julia Adam), who things she is just a scientist who looks good in a bathing suit but who is really just monster bait.  Unable to find any more remains at the original location, the group decides that the rest of the fossil must have washed downstream and become convinced that it will conveniently end up in the mysterious Black Lagoon.  The native say that no one ever returns from that place, which only has one entrance (someone must have returned if they know that much, but I quibble).

Reed and Williams think they are involved in a love triangle with Kay, but Williams does not have a chance and the creature is Reed's real competition (and the creature is more animated than Reed).  The scientists want to get the creature and bring it back alive, but the creature has other ideas and in the grand tradition of pretty much most Universal monster movies the men have to rescue the pretty woman from the poor, misunderstood monster.  I know on some level this is just rehashing ""King Kong,"" with several elements presaging ""Jaws,"" but I have no problem taking this story on its own delightful terms.

If you pay attention you can tell what were supposed to be the neat 3-D effects in ""The Creature from the Black Lagoon,"" but what you will really be impressed by is the underwater photography, which is actually where this film was rather cutting edge for its day.  After the surprising success of the original (it made over $1 million in its original release), a pair of less than stellar sequels were produced, ""Revenge of the Creature"" in 1955 and ""The Creature Walks Among Us"" in 1956.  But that is true of every Universal movie monster except for the Frankenstein series, where ""The Bride of Frankenstein"" is actually superior to the original.  So just check out this classic black & white monster movie and leave the sequels to gather dust.",1098662400,3,4597,4.728070175438597
68294,4,0783245130,"It may take a bit of getting used to if (like me) you really aren't used to watching old movies. The performances at first seem a bit hammy but having both Outer Limit boxsets and all 5 Twilight Zone sets I am slowly warming up to this genre of film. To start with the packaging is great. Really great. Durable, fitting/beautiful artwork, plus extras! I am considering buying the Dracula set next from the quality shown here with this Creature set, I do have to wonder, why not go the whole 9 and give us 5.1 Digital Dolby? You could still have the original mono as an option for purists. But to hear the menu screens in 5.1 and then the movie begins... in a very small 2.0 mono it's like... ugh. The transfers seem great and I can only imagine how 49 year old masters have aged! (Note: On 2nd disc the 2nd and 3rd movies are put in the wrong order from left to right, a fairly big deal since I watched them in the wrong order not knowing Revenge is Part II and Walk is III.)

The Creature From The Black Lagoon 4/5 - I suppose it's pretty obvious this is the one with the biggest budget and seems like the one with the best cast, but on some levels I'm not so sure. Julie Adams is of course a true beauty but seems to not serve much purpose beyond making the creature 'want her' which in and of itself makes little sense. Why would a gill man be attracted to a busty babe? Opposites attract? I know for script purposes it's to have tension, but beyond that it makes little sense. The ships captain bothers me a lot in this movie and plays the part a bit overaught. Still, my critiques aside, this movie of the three seems to have the highest sense of wonderment and adventure.

Revenge of the Creature 2/5 - By far my least fave of the three. The characters 'Cleat' and 'Helen' do very little for me. Their forced romance and strained love on screen just lacks chemistry. Hard to believe this is the same director as Part One. This comes off as a sort of very early forerunner to Jurassic Parks 'The Lost World' which is just a very forgettable sequel and seems more like a 'sequel' for money instead of viewing purpose. The only truly redeeming quality I can find in this is the sympathetic parts where you see the gill man looking out of the tank. Sadly, I can't think of much beyond this. I likely would have walked out of this... if I were alive in '55:)

The Creature Walks Among Us 3.75/5 - Hmmm, judging by many reviews here, you would think this movie is a complete throw-away, plus being the thrid it's almost a guarantee. Well, it is and it isn't. Oddly, the Creature is the least interesting part of this movie. I like the relationship between Leigh Snowden and a few of the men over the gill man, and she really seems to have a purpose in this. Leigh is sort of the focal point for the fairly ingenius 'parallel' dialogue about trust and fidelity (ie; man VS beast, jungle VS stars). Putting the Creature 'in clothes' is an obvious Star Trek-esque ploy of saving the budget through cheap costumes but it really takes away greatly from any impact the Creature has and makes it look rather silly. This movies strong point is definately the dialogue which out does the first movie but comes up short on effects.

Still, with running commentaries (but they talk WAY TOO FAST!! And the movie dialgue bleeds through too much making it feel like listening to 2 radio stations at once) and three classic movies in this set, whose complaining? I must not forget to mention the actual score of the movie (the soundtrack)... excellant... just excellant!!

((Slight Edit:)) I have to ask Universal... why put the option on each disc to play movies not even on it? For instance, on disc One, all three movies appear on the menu. When select either of the two sequels, it lets you know to put in the other disc that these movies aren't even on this disc. Are we really this dense? After all, we were smart enough to buy this:)",1098662400,11,3925,4.3712328767123285
68295,5,0783245130,"Don't get me wrong, the first wave of Monster Legacy Collections--Dracula, Frankenstein, Wolf Man--were great, but the Creature from the Black Lagoon set is so far superior to them.

The Movies:

At first glance, this would seem like the lowest value of the Legacy Collections, as it only has 3 movies, whereas all of the others contain 4-5 movies.  Of course, these 3 movies happen to better than most of the movies in the other sets.  While all of them have one good feature, followed by several lesser sequels, the Creature from the Black Lagoon stands out because it is a trilogy.  Although movies in a trilogy can also contain lesser sequels (as some fans would argue of The Creature Walks Among Us, just like they would complain about Return of the Jedi), none of the other Universal monsters were fortunate enough to have such a coherent storyline packaged as a structured unit.  Dracula, Frankenstein, and the Wolf Man ended up having inexplicable plot holes through each successive sequel, ending up in endless cross-overs with each other.  Then, all of the Universal monster franchises--Dracula, Frankenstein, Wolf Man, Invisible Man, and the Mummy--ultimately came to a close after a confrontation with Abbott and Costello.  The fact that the Creature never resorted to that self-parody demonstrates its rank above the other monsters.

Commentaries:

Since there are fewer movies per disc in this set, Universal was generous enough to include a commentary for each film.  Again, unlike the substandard sequels of the other sets, each of the films in this set is actually deserving of a full audio commentary (really, would anybody listen to a commentary of the Mummy's Tomb?).

I prefer a commentary by a film historian on an older movie, so i'm pleased with Universal's choice to provide a commentary by only Tom Weaver for the first movie.  Although some of the information seems superfluous due to the ""Back to the Black Lagoon"" documentary, it's still an exhaustive commentary that we've come to expect from Universal.

Although my least favorite form of commentary is a group of cast members, producers, or directors (especially on older movies, this sort of commentary usually deteriorates to whining about how certain special effects would have been done with computers, rather than ellaborating on the remarkable special effects), but Lori Nelson did an exceptional job with Tom Weaver and Bob Burns on Revenge of the Creature, who also do an excellent job on The Creature Walks Among Us.

Documentary:

Universal's special features have definitely improved this time around also.  The one complaint about the last wave was that some of the features were too much of an advertisement for Stephen Sommer's Van Helsing.  This time, none of these classic movies are diminished as vehicles for a modern movie; the documentary's focus solely on the classics, their sequels, and their impact.  In fact, ""Back to the Black Lagoon"" is so informative and well-done that this set would be worth it for just the first disc.

Although Dracula and Frankenstein are more universally recognized, the greatest Universal monster is without question the Creature from the Black Lagoon.  From the eerie settings in the lagoon and the cave, to the characteristic score, the Creature was the epic that monster movies were destined to evolve into.  The Creature also represents a missing link in film history as they were some of the last movies filmed in 3-D.  But don't think these were the result of a 50's gimmick, these movies have a depth and pathos that one wouldn't normally expect from a monster movie, and as a complete set, they comprise a full storyline that draws from the best of King Kong and the Lost World.  The only thing that could possibly complete this set is if the Creature from the Black Lagoon and Revenge of the Creature could be seen in their original 3-D.",1098489600,15,3880,4.97984496124031

The Creature from the Black Lagoon 4/5

The costume is terrific and the characters are pretty good, as is the story.  Some people say the characters are 2-D in this movie, but I don't beleive they are, and I've seen alot of movies.  The cast members die convincingly for.  Sets and props are creative.  The ending isn't much though.

Revenge of the Creature 3/5

The ending of the first film made it seem like the Creature was gone for good, but some more scientists have returned to the amazon properly equiped with explosives to knock out the Gill-Man.  They suceede and take him back to a Florida Sea World type of place for display.  Naturaly he rebels and goes for the pretty girl.  This film is directed by the same director, but is much larger scale taking place in the city.  There's only one scene where he terrorizes a crowd like the publicity implies.  The ending is exactly the same, with the same footage of the Creature sinking down in the water from the first film.

The Creature Walks Among Us 3/5

I almost gave this a 2/5 for the extremely abrupt ending, but than I realized that it was probably the best ending of all the films in the trilogy.  I think it's cool that they further explored the Creature's emotions, but they spent most of the movie focusing on unecessary character development.  There's a period of time before we even see the Creature that lasts way too long.  The transformed creature looked good.  He looked like a big thug, but you could see that on the inside he wasn't a vicious beast like he was made out to be in films 1 and 2.  I just hate it that they didn't get him into the city or anything and that he's probably not even in that much of the movie.

The extras are pretty cool.  I'm not sure I like the production photos because you can't navigate through them yourself.  Music plays while they automaticaly cycle.  I haven't gotten around to the commentaries, but I'm impressed that there is one for each movie.  I really like how these movies are all uniform.  By that I mean they use pretty much the same soundtracks, and their opening credits are the same, sort of like the Matrix Trilogy.  This collection is well worth the purchase.

Still, you can't blame the studio too much, as recreating the polarized, dual projector 3-D experience at home is no easy feat. No, these films were NOT shown in the inferior red/blue anaglyph format back in the 50s, though they have been shown that way on TV and in some revivals. Those versions look awful, and are an insult to the original 3-D versions. I'm glad they chose not to include downconverted anaglyph prints on the DVD, and the ColorCode format is even worse. The only choice for good 3-D at home is field sequential, but the glasses are $30 a pair and can't be included in the box. The studio COULD have included a FS 3-D version of the first and second films along with the modified flat print along with instructions on how to purchase the glasses if people were interested. However, even FS 3-D isn't perfect so at this time we will have to live with flat versions on this set. I've seen the original 3-D versions of these movies in all their polarized, clear glasses glory and for sure, people seeing these movies flat are missing out.

The final film, CREATURE WALKS AMONG US, was an ordinary flat film.

The extras on the set are worth the price alone, all films have audio commentaries, and REVENGE and WALKS AMONG US have cast member participation!

If this volume to The Legacy Collection is not offered in this manner, it will be a very huge flaw to an otherwise perfect collection (the Abbott and Costello films don't belong here because they are untrue to the intent and spirit of these characters).  I am asking that everyone interested in The Creature From the Black Lagoon and/or The Legacy Collection in general go to the web site [...] and e-mail the company and demand, as I have done, that they offer The Creature in a dual 3-D/regular black and white option format.  As I had stated to Universal, I am willing to bet that the large majority of fans would be willing to pay a little extra for this option.

And if you can't remember that cos you weren't there, TOO BAD, haha.  Cool to watch vet silent film star Antonio Moreno steal every scene he's in, including the one where he's just staring at Julie Adams as she's speaking; not to mention the other character actor who plays the owner of the ship, Nestor Paiva.  The young ones have great bodies of course and the creature is magnificent if a little cheesy.

68350,5,0783245130,"Though made in the [cheesy] monster period of the 50s, this movie is excellent, simply because it was made by Universal. The Creature ranks with the Wolf Man, Dracula, and Frankenstein. The plot is well done and suspensful. An expedition travels to the forbidden Black Lagoon of the Amazon in search of the remnants of a fossil, which may prove to be the missing link! Little do they know that one such creature still exsists, and it's determined to destroy all trespassers in its domain. This has always been one of my favorites because it's well done, and makes sense (like it could be true). Very highly recommended!",1026172800,2,619,4.7407407407407405
68351,5,0783245130,"When a grizzled scientist unearths a prehistoric claw beyond current classification, a team of researchers treks to the Amazon to uncover the truth.  There they stumble into the legendary Black Lagoon, described by their boat's captain as a paradise...from which no one ever returns.  And the ultimate truth is the Gill Man (Ben Chapman) himself, a scaly, half-human amphibian who falls in love with the group's lovely female assistant, Kay (Julia Adams).  When one of the scientists (Richard Denning) decides to make a trophy of the monster, the Gill Man strikes back.  The men need only fear a grisly death--but for Kay the Gill Man plans a fate far worse...
A classic of the horror/sci-fi genre, Creature From the Black Lagoon was the last great monster from Universal Studios.  Reminiscent of the Deep Ones from the tales of horror scribe H.P. Lovecraft, FX man Bud Westmore's Gill Man suit turned actor Chapman into a truly scary presence.  The rest of the cast handles each of their respective roles impressively, and the script not only makes the most of the archtypical plot (isolated researchers menaced by prehistoric beast), but tightens the suspense by building conflict between Denning's obsessive character and leading man Richard Carlson.  The two's rivalry for both Kay (Carlson loves her; Denning needs her) and the creature (Carlson wants to study it; Denning wants to kill it) adds a realistic human element to the fantastic story.  The film's setting, deep in the Amazon jungle, is eerie and evocative--anything could be lurking out there.  Likewise, the movie's score is legendary among classic monster fans, the perfect complement to the mysterious locale.
Creature From the Black Lagoon is my favorite of all the classic Universal monster movies.  From the opening ""creation prologue"" to the Creature's first merciless attack, to the hypnotic dual water ballet as the delectable Kay strokes back and forth through the Lagoon's black waters, oblivious to the monster floating along with her, to the climax deep in the Gill Man's underground home, Creature From the Black Lagoon is a flawless masterpiece from sci-fi's golden age.",1023062400,3,2151,5.172910662824208
68352,3,0783245130,"This famous Universal picture features the giant gill man, who has risen in infamy to take his place right up there with the Wolf Man, Dracula, and Frankenstein's monster.
On a dig in the Amazon, Antonio Moreno discovers the fossilized skeletal remains of a hand that has webbed fingers. He takes it back to a biological institute, where hunky guys Richard Carlson and Richard Denning await. Carlson is the good guy, Denning runs the institute and is just out for fame and fortune, Mother Earth be darned. Accompanied by Carlson's girlfriend, Julie Adams, the group return to the site in a rust bucket of a boat. Someone (or something) has killed the natives left to guard the site.
The group puts a strange theory together that the rest of the fossil must have been washed down to a local lagoon, called the Black Lagoon. Adams thinks it should be called ""the Beautiful Lagoon"" when they arrive there (thanks, Julie, go lie down). As Carlson and Denning put on aqua lungs and bicker, we see a strange creature in the water, a half man and half fish.
The creature from the black lagoon starts offing some of the boat's native crew, and is captured. Then it escapes, only this time hurts a white scientist guy. NOW we are mad. A couple of natives is one thing, but when you hurt anglos, you are in for it. The film then falls into an unfortunate routine: the burly men come up with a plan, gill man outsmarts them and kills or maims somebody, burly men come up with new plan. Toss in Carlson and Denning fighting worse than George Jefferson and Flo, and you have a cult horror sci-fi flick.
Some of the stuff here is silly. Adams' only role seems to be to look cute in a one piece and scream every time the stealth like gill man gets on the boat, which is often. Denning and Carlson's arguing grates. At one point, to flush out the gill man, they poison the entire lagoon with a drug that renders aquatic life paralyzed for an hour or two! The gill man is shot twice with a harpoon yet still manages to live through it all.
On the positive, the gill man's makeup is awesome. The suit is totally believable, and the effect is creepy. The suit seems pliable enough that the actor encased inside can still move around, and he gets involved in the action. James C. Havens directed the underwater sequences and did a great job. The shots are crystal clear, and even a silt filled fight between the creature and Denning comes off well. Director Arnold does well on dry land, turning the lagoon into a claustrophobic trap when the creature blocks the exit with a dead tree. Arnold seamlessly blends studio shots with location filming.
All things considered, this is not a bad film. It is scarier and more entertaining than ninety percent of the horror and science fiction films that have come out since the mid 1950's. For nostalgia, you cannot beat it. I do recommend it.
This is unrated, and contains physical violence, mild gun violence, and mild gore.",1022889600,3,2947,4.551789077212806
68353,4,0783245130,"One of few truly great ""creature"" films, THE CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON is a surprisingly effective horror film concerning a scientific expedition up the Amazon to investigate an unusual fossil find--but instead of fossils the crew members encounter an underwater creature of considerable intelligence that is bent on their destruction.
The script is a bit dated by modern standards, but the cast (particularly Julie Adams) is effective, and the creature is easily one of Universal Studio's most memorable creations.  And seen today in standard black and white, the film is quite enjoyable.  But it doesn't hold a candle to the original 3-D format, which I was fortunate to see not once but twice during the 1970s and 1980s.  Simply stated, BLACK LAGOON's cinematography was probably the best of all 3-D movies to date.  As with most 3-D films, there is plenty of ""coming at you"" cinematography, and many viewers will be able to pick out such moments when seeing the film in standard black and white--but in addition to these, the film used 3-D in a remarkably subtle way; virtually every scene in the film is designed for 3-D, and the effect is exceptionally memorable in the underwater sequences.
I remain disappointed that the 3-D version of BLACK LAGOON--not to mention such other 3-D films as HOUSE OF WAX, IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE, and DIAL ""M"" FOR MURDER--has never been released in 3-D format on video or disk; instead, we must make do with such bottom-budget 3-D ficks as THE MASK, CAT WOMEN ON THE MOON, and the like.  Admittedly, the impact of the format is lessened by the small screen and demands some careful color adjusting, and the effect requires the use of 3-D glasses--but it is a shame that we must settle for ghosts of the originals when we could easily have the originals instead.  In 3-D format, BLACK LAGOON would easily be a five-star film.",1020729600,,1869,4.825
68354,5,0783245130,"As many times as this movie has been copied, filmmakers still can't seem to get it right. Considering that this film is considered a trend-setter, it's amazing how many rules this film BREAKS by today's standards. It breaks the notion that full shots of the creature and lots of blood and violence are needed to create a scare. In this film, all you need is a shot of the creature's hand and that piercing three-note musical motive played by brass instruments, and let the imagination fill in the blanks. It shatters the notion that monsters MUST be computer-generated--a guy in a suit CAN be scary. And it proves that black-and-white photography can be just as rich as color photography. The underwater sequences especially are both beautiful (almost surreal) and eerie at the same time.
And then there is the Gill Man himself. It's as if the writers took the best qualities of his predecessors and combined them into the last and best (IMHO) of the Universal monsters. Like The Mummy, he has lived long after he technically should have died; like Frankenstein's monster, he appears to be savage, yet shows intelligence and appreciates beauty; like Dracula, he is seductive. Just check out the scene where he swims with Julia Adams (unbeknownst to her, of course). I believe this is why he has achieved the status of a genuine icon, and deservedly so. Here's hoping he swims the waters for a long time.",987724800,6,1403,4.801652892561983
68355,5,0783245130,"No matter how many times you see this movie it always seems fresh and original.  Probably because when it was released it was!  The Creature is one of the top 10 Movie monsters of all time.  The scientific approach of this movie is today, laughable, but in its day it was a bold move to make evolutionary biology integral to a film's plot.  The early glimpses of the Creature allow for a  buildup of suspense.  Throughout the enitre film you feel that the Creature is the victim, even after its killed and mutilated.  Equally important is Julia Adams whose white bathing suit must have been quite scandalous in 1954!  And I wouldn't be giving her her due if I didn't say that in her day she was a knockout!
The exploratory scene invovling the Creature and Julia Adams where the Creature tries to figure out what Adams is by first swimming stroke for stroke underneath her and then touching her feet is CLASSIC!
The Creature is great, the violence done artfully, drawing on the imagination's idea of what happened, a quick glimpse of a clenched hand in rigor mortis, a fishing net torn to pieces as the ship is rocked back and forth from below...

Basically this is an extremely well done  drive in movie,  helmed by the superior direction of Jack Arnold, who gets  good performances out of a cast that contains several familiar faces to  fans of '50s Sci-Fi/Horror (Richard Carlson, Richard Denning, Whit Bissell,  Nestor Paiva) and also gets the most out of the mysterious, potentially  dangerous Amazon jungle setting.  There is a good feeling of paranoia in  the last half of the film, when the Black Lagoon and the boat both get a  little claustrophobic for our heroes as they realize the Creature is more  intelligent than they thought and is playing cat-and-mouse with them.  The  music score is an unforgettable, classic '50s horror movie score.  And of  course, there is the classic 'underwater ballet' scene with the monster  swimming underwater stalking lovely Julia Adams in a graceful, haunting  mirror image (Ms. Adams swimsuit is a close second place to the Creature  himself as the real star of the film!). Too fast paced, exciting, and all  around well done to be considered  run-of-the-mill schlocky 50s 'Man in a  Rubber Suit Monster' drive-in fare.
