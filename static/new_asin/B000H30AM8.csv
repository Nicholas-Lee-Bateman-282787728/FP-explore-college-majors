8136123,5,B000H30AM8,"Kohei comes from a family of gifted psychics, however, he has been told that he has no power. He meets Hazuki, a young vamipe girl. She bites him, but he does not become his slave. Perplexed by this Hazuki comes to live with him. Her father sends a bunch of vampires out to retrieve her. Hazuki and Kohei go to great lengths to get stronger and protect the happy life they have together.

This anime was a lot fun to watch. There are a lot of great gags and fun comedy. The silliness isn't too much, too mask the seriousness of the strong feelings they share. The animation is good and the voice acting is too. One of the unique things about this anime is the soundtrack. It has a lighthearted and playful vibe that suits the show perfectly. All in all this is a series I strongly recommend it to any anime fan.",1354752000,,811,4.266233766233766
8136124,5,B000H30AM8,"What a fun mix of suspense, drama, and all around cuteness! This is a story about a vampire girl who loves to dress and act like an adorable kitty! There is more to the story but I just love it. Great buy, my friends keep borrowing it from me.",1279238400,,243,3.979591836734694

This anime was definitely interesting because it starts off all dramatic and eerie, then it goes to being funny and crazy.  I want to get the other volumes because of the subplots that were introduced throughout the first volume.  If you are into vampires, then this is a good anime to buy.",1236038400,,445,6.4
8136126,5,B000H30AM8,"Super cute anime! At first I was wondering where the story was going. The series ended up being one of my favorites.  The characters are likeable, the story is great, and the grapics are stunning. Truly a great anime! You won't be dissapionted.",1173916800,,244,4.674418604651163
8136127,4,B000H30AM8,"I went into this series not expecting very much at all and I was plesantly surprised to find a series with some very likable characters, an interesting story, and one of the most bizarre opening songs I've ever seen in anime, probably the most bizarre. Anyway as has been stated it's basically about the cute little vampire girl, Hazuki, who has been isolated from society most of her life and is finally released by a young paranormal photographer named Kouhei.  They end up living together with his family and the story goes on dealing with just everyday life as a vampire and battles with other vampires who want to bring Hazuki back.

It's well done and has elements of comedy, action, and drama, so it has a little something for everyone.

On the DVD itself, the packaging and insert are very nice.  Each DVD also comes with 4 postcards with artwork on them from different artist which is definitely nice.",1172102400,,910,4.66875
8136128,5,B000H30AM8,"I picked up this DVD on a whim, thinking my girlfriend would like it.  I'm so glad I did.  This series is surprisingly witty, funny, and dramatic.  The English dubbing is not bad at all...and I love the theme song (it's very different).

You'll fall in love with Hazuki, the chaacter the story centers around, right away.  She is the perfect mix of sass, smugness, arrogance, childlike innocence and cuteness.  All of the characters are well developed and believable.

I haven't read any of the manga, so I can't compare the it to the DVDs. I can say that I found the story to be very entertaining and enjoyable and, having seen these episodes, I'll be looking into the manga soon.

I highly suggest looking into this series.",1167868800,6,725,4.609375
8136129,4,B000H30AM8,"Kouhei would like to be a professional photographer someday but no mainstream magazine will take his work because he has the unusual ability to capture ghostly apparitions on film. So no matter what or who he takes a picture of, there's always this spooky shape hovering around them! The only time this comes in handy is when he does freelance work for the editor of Occult Magazine, Hiromi. In their latest collaboration they have travelled to Germany with Kouhei's cousin, Seiji, who also happens to be a powerful psychic. They have come to do a story on the legendary Schwartz Quelle Castle, a gigantic edifice that comes with a ton of local legends about its past and tales of things that go bump in the night inhabiting its walls. Kouhei's other talent is that curses and assaults by supernatural beings have no effect on him, which makes him the best guinea pig to see what will happen when a human enters the castle. Little does he know that inside is a young vampire girl named Hazuki who has been held against her will for years, waiting for someone to rescue her. In addition to her rescue, she also wishes to make this knight in shining armor her submissive slave with a bite of her fangs!

Even though the show starts off with a lot of horror elements, its prime directive is cuteness. And the cuteness contained on this first disk will make your teeth rot out, but who cares about cavities, right? Hazuki makes Sugar, the little snow fairy look like Dirty Harry by comparison! The horror takes a big right turn to comedy as Hazuki comes to live with Kouhei, Seiji, and their antique dealer grandfather who can't resist requesting Hazuki to wear cat ears all the time. I really liked the interactions between Kouhei and Hazuki, who make a great comedy team. Looks like this is going to be a really good show.",1162252800,6,1820,4.6
