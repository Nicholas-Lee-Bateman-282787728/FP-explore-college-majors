2725544,5,B000M5AM1U,"This movie reiterated some things I've learned about kabbalah and alchemy over the years and illuminated alot of facts I did not.  This is a must have video introduction into the doctrine of Gnosticism as taught by SAW.  A great gift for anyone looking to share with a friend or find basic information about the faith themselves.  Most importantly the science of alchemy as kundalini yoga, such an eye-opener!

Thank you so much!",1169424000,12,429,4.835616438356165

Therefore, I was very pleased to see that this film is a powerful contribution to mankind's education about the sacred potential of intimate relationships. It's also a gorgeous tapestry of thousands of years of symbolism from esoteric traditions all over the globe. I'm especially impressed that the filmakers managed to portray the essence of Samael Aun Weor's teachings without his fiery language. Bravo!",1169337600,30,701,5.381818181818182

2725547,4,B000M5AM1U,"I thought the DVD was informative and did a good job at relaying many of the basic principles inherent in your Gnostic tradition.

The thing that I find appealing with your Gnostic group is your attempt at synthesis of many of the main religious/spiritual traditions. And in our modern world such a cosmopolitan approach is refreshingly needed.

That said, even though your Gnostic tradition is rich in ""knowledge"" it is important for people to realize that no amount of outward-knowledge will reveal the inner-knowing and union one can attain with the Absolute or God (""union"" being correlated with the term ""SEX""). Such outward ""knowledge"" is merely a tool that if used with persistence, discipline, purity of intention and most importantly meditation, can awaken the inner-faculties needed for The Ultimate Achievement of any mortal...which is God-Union.",1168387200,11,857,5.340740740740741
2725548,4,B000M5AM1U,"The DVD is one of the most awesome projects that I've seeen in a long time.  Well done.  This should be out in the public domain; so many people are trying to figure out why their beliefs are failing them and how to make sense of all the different teachings.

2725549,5,B000M5AM1U,"Even though the word ""Sex"" is central to this DVD, it contains no lascivious or malicious images or language. The subject is of upmost importance for those seeking true self-realization. If you are tired of feeling empty after mechanical, repetitive and fruitless worship. This DVD will not let you down and will open your eyes. I cannot thank the authors enough as it did change my life and those around me. There is a lot of information to be experienced in order to achieve our place back in Eden and this is a great tool in order to get you in that path.

2725551,5,B000M5AM1U,"Throughout the ages, these Mysteries have always been kept secret to the common public.  Only a select few were able to receive these teachings on the hidden nature of Sex.

Many Religious and Philosophical texts from around the World make special references to Sex.  But there have been people who have distorted its true meaning and still keep the subject open to mis-interpretation.  Great Sages have also veiled Sex, some even say that humanity is not ready to regenerate and elevate itself through this knowledge....

Thanks to the Gnostic Anthropologist Samael Aun Weor (1917-1977) have the Mysteries of Man and Woman been able to be communicated openly to the public.  It is due to him that this revolutionary educational video was able to be made.

He wrote his first of 70 books on a comparative study of Sex throughout world Mythology, Religion and Esoteric tradition.  ""The Perfect Matrimony"" synthesized the Spirituality of the East and the Spirituality of the West with Sacred Sexuality (non-orgasm/non-ejaculation sex) as the basic foundation.

Against a lavish and beautiful backdrop of symbols, history and mythology throughout the world's religions and ancient cultures, the DVD discusses and gives special light on the meaning of Sin and the origin of Suffering, as well as offers people a new hope...a new way of making love.

Of course there will arise complainers, lukewarm people, and protectors of perversity criticizing the content of this DVD, but truly what is needed are intelligent and courageous people who are able to see and understand this new point of view.  We as a society cannot remain asleep on this topic anymore.

I MUST ADD:  This DVD documentary is not intended to provide complete details and explanations on the science of Sacred Sex.  For that they have left the door to research open to the viewer.  Samael Aun Weor's main writings on the subject would be an obvious first place to start; ""THE MYSTERY OF THE GOLDEN BLOSSOM""(1972) and ""THE PERFECT MATRIMONY""(1950/61).

(There has also been a recently published book by Marnia Robinson called ""PEACE BETWEEN THE SHEETS - Healing with Sexual Relationships"". She explores in detail the topic of intimate spiritual/sexual union and the question of ""Why relationships fail?"" and ""Why couples separate?"".  She agrees with many ancient sources and gives modern explanations to why the spasm and ejaculation causes many unknown spiritual, psychological and even physical problems.  Her book is completely compatible with the Gnostic Teachings and is a perfect and wonderful accompaniment to ""SEX- The Secret Gate to Eden"" DVD!)",1168128000,4,2615,5.200477326968974
2725562,5,B000M5AM1U,"This movie is the real scoop on a very misunderstood topic. Unfortunately many people cannot grasp the significance of the movie while others find it to be like remembering the Truth that one has forgotten.
Only scratching the surface of a very vast subject that takes eons to master this movie is a great starting point for every student of every path.

Note:
Some may think that this is saying that we must get married and only have sex for children..
Not what it is saying.

It is saying that having multiple partners causes magnetic and electric embalances and short circuits in our energy body.
Same Sex partners also creates magnetic imbalances, increases lust and adds desire, which in turn creates more suffering.
So a couple should be Spiritually married together and committed to The Self Realization of the Being as one.  No one cares about a marriage document especially not God. Although I like the process of marriage myself.

It is amazing how we are so addicted to the orgasm and to our lust that we do not see that we are slaves to the sexual energy. Whether it be taking the form of Sex, Lust, over eating, laziness, depression, anger, alcoholism, disguised as Loving, hating, over activism, under activism, lying, stealing,  etc.... It is true what Freud said- ""The Human problem is a sexual one.""
Everything that we are is different forms of the sexual energy, mutated in some way or another.. Everything!
If we can only stop spending the energy out in wasteful ways we will see our true colors. No matter how advanced we think we are on any path.
This is why all ancient religions at their roots teach some form of chastity and that has been mistaken as strict celibacy over the centuries. This doesn't just mean No  orgasm but it means transmutation of the energy into spiritual energy through extensive spiritual practices, like devotional pranayama, mantrayana, tantrayana, etc..

The highest path is Sex with a spouse of the opposite sex.
Tantra without Lust and Without orgasm, ever, under any circumstances.
Period.

If we are interested in liberation from Samsara we should study Gnosis, Study the Dalai Lama, Study the ancient religions and say no to New Age deceptions.

I suggest study of the 14th (Current) Dalai Lama's teachings on the Kalachakra Tantra at the Berzin Archives website.

""Although I am using this ordinary term, sexual climax, it does not imply the ordinary sexual act. The reference here is to the experience of entering into union with a consort of the opposite sex, by means of which the elements at the crown are melted, and through the power of Meditation the process is also reversed. A prerequisite of such a practice is that you should be able to protect yourself from the fault of seminal emission. According to the explanation of the Kalachakra Tantra in particular, such emission is said to be very damaging to your practice. Therefore, because you should not experience emission even in dreams, the tantras describe different techniques for overcoming this fault.""

....[]  ""Therefore, to constitute a root downfall, one needs the mind of wishing liberation from the bliss of orgasmic release.""

- The 14th Dalai Lama",1264550400,8,3178,4.895716945996275
2725563,5,B000M5AM1U,"It seems obvious that this video will get some bad reviews, because it pertains to a subject that is so controversial and misunderstood.  I was happily surprised by its simplicity and straightforwardness in dealing with such a thorny issue.  The gentleness and grace of the delivery is especially appealing due to the strength and edge of the matter, since many people can get easily offended or critical when it touches their sexual lives.

This video offers, through a simple yet thorough presentation, the unanimity of religious scriptures on the subject of sexuality.  Rather than being a dogmatic and Puritanical explication on how sex is bad, it explains how sexuality, in its proper usage, is a wonderful medium for the divine.  It emphasizes that sex without the orgasm was the primeval method for procreation and spiritual development.  Rather than expending millions of sperm for the conception of a single child, the video explains how children were conceived through sexual union without orgasm.  This is what religious scriptures assert to be ""immaculate conception,"" meaning: ""without fault or impurity.""

While the video stresses the purity and sanctity of sex, it also explains that it's opposite, fornication (sex with lust and the orgasm) is detrimental to the soul.  The video makes the point that Eden (Hebrew for ""Pleasure"") is a natural state of human consciousness, born from the chaste usage of the sexual energy.  Fornication, on the other hand, is a source of psychological and spiritual suffering, since it involves a large expenditure of energy that could be used instead to give life to the soul.

The video also clarifies that chastity, rather than meaning sexual abstention, instead means ""without blemish,"" or without orgasm, rather than ""without sex.""  This relates to the meaning of the word Tantra, ""the Continuum,"" since by refraining from the orgasm, the sexual energy is contained and harnessed without being lost.

It's ironic that there are people who defend Tantra with the orgasm when the very act contradicts its etymology.  With the orgasm there is no continuum or cycle of energy, since it is being wasted.  This video does an excellent job of explaining these types of discrepancies and confusions from a scriptural standpoint.

I also think it's interesting to note that many argue in favor for the orgasm, that it is healthy and so on, even when there is no scientific evidence for this.  In fact, there is more evidence to the contrary.  The producers of this video have a website called ""Sacred-sex.org"" which has some scientific articles about the physiological and psychological detriments of the orgasm.  There is also a website dedicated to this subject called ""Reuniting"" which, while having nothing to do with the teachings of Samael Aun Weor, also presents sexuality in a different perspective than what is commonly taught today.  For those looking to find more information in relation to this video, these sources are an excellent compliment.

My only complaint with the video is that it is not long enough.  More could have been explained and elaborated upon; however, this can also be said to be beneficial for those who are newer to these teachings, which I would believe, from having studied this work, was the intended audience.  Overall, I was very impressed with the level of detail and care given to the video, in terms of imagery and presentation.  I look forward to Glorian Publishing's upcoming production, which I believe will involve live-action filming.",1243728000,10,3525,5.133099824868651
2725564,5,B000M5AM1U,"`Sex, The Secret Gate to Eden - Alchemy, Tantra, and Kabbalah' has managed to present a profound and foundational concept in an exquisitely simple format that makes sense to both novice and adept spiritual seeker.

2725565,2,B000M5AM1U,"I enjoyed most of what was said, until it reached a climax (pardon the pun) concerning the forbidden nature of sexuality.

I did not resonate with the religious dogma concerning the ""forbidden nature"" of sexuality for anything other than procreation, implying the age-old lie of puritan Christian dogma which denies ""recreational"" sexuality, as if to engage in any form of sexuality outside the confines implicitly for producing a child is ""sinful."" This is wrong and dangerous teaching. Sexuality is a gift and not just for procreation, but also for recreation. Though granted, I would disagree if my words are misconstrued to imply it can be used to harm another, such as in rape or child abuse.

This dogmatic approach to sexuality is the very fundamental foundation for some to hold fast to their prejudices against extra or pre-marital sex, as well as homosexuality, and thus justify their antagonist attitudes, even criminalization and punitive actions toward those who practice such.",1187481600,7,990,5.220125786163522

I really liked how it combined truths from all religions into one universal truth, that is backed up by facts if one wants to research like I have. Also, how the symbolism of the Bible was explained was amazing to me. I always knew there was more to those stories. Overall, a great peice of work, but DON'T STOP HERE! This is only the beginning. There is still much more to learn! I suggest studying tantric yoga, kundalini yoga, buddhism in general, the Gospel of Thomas, writings by Glenn Morris (Path Notes, Shadow Strategies), if you want to have fun read up on astral traveling (Astral Dynamics by Robert Bruce is amazing) and don't forget to work your body too! chi gung, tai chi, basically all chinese arts are amazing for that.

A few technical qualms aside, I found that this documentary was extremely well done.  The topic was treated with the utmost respect, the narration was accessible and tantalizing, and the logical use of so many excerpts, citations, and beautiful works of art from across the globe made every moment a pleasurable and highly informative learning experience.  In fact, by the end of the film, I felt as though I had emerged from a prolonged state of prayer and introspection, which is about the best thing I can say about any work of art.

I would like to thank Thelema Press for this exceptionally rare, meticulously researched and thorough fresh look at the topic of sexuality.

To everybody with an intuitive interest in the subject matter, I safely give this DVD my highest recommendation.",1173830400,18,1059,4.893854748603352

This was the biggest AH-HA moment that I have ever experienced in my life! I was watching this and was blown away when they started correlating the two traditions. It was like I've known it all my life, but this video just kinda smacked me in the forehead with it. When you watch this movie, you will know what I am talking about. It is knowledge that you have known through the eternities, it will awaken in you a deep memory that has been locked and stored away for lifetimes. When you read the Bible literally like most of us Christians growing up do, it never really made sense. This video explains beautifully the Bible's allegorical meanings. Examples from numerous spiritual traditions are given to help connect the dots to this sacred knowledge. It helped me to reflect on my past actions and how I have caused myself and others so much harm and suffering by abuse of sex. The abuse of sex destroys lives, I know from my own personal experience, and this video shows how and why. I love how it was done in a documentary style with enjoyable and professional narration, very well done. The narration is done over beautiful visuals of esoteric paintings and scripture. This video is deep and can be a bit overwhelming at first, but says everything that is needed. Something that you might have to watch at least twice just to scratch the surface.

There is very loose interpertation of bible versus, that is certainly from a biased perspective. I can't put my finger on it, this movie seems to exude authority but I feel so uncomfortable after watching this.

There is an agenda at work here; subtle at the beginning, and openly preachy by the end:  The film advocates strict chastity, says that only (male/female) married couples can hope to re-unite with God, and states that sexual orgasm is the root of all of humanity's problems and should be steadfastly avoided.
