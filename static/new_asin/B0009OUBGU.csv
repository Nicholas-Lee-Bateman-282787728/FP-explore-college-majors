2308777,5,B0009OUBGU,This workout is a little different than others that I have tried.  The music is fun and the workout is great.,1170806400,,109,4.190476190476191
2308778,3,B0009OUBGU,"3 stars only because I expected more traditional Afrikan movements. The music for all 3 portions sounds the same: steel drums and the whole carribean vibe.  She has great energy and charisma. I like the pace, I just thought at least one section would be more Afrikan drum based. If you want to keep it moving, this is for you. If you're looking for something to mirror the Afrikan dance class you're taking, then look elsewhere.",1155600000,10,428,4.631578947368421
2308779,5,B0009OUBGU,"This DVD is fabulous. I hate to exercise, but this is more like going to a club in New York City. The instructor is so funny, I had a blast doing this workout and now my favorite jeans fit once again.

In my collection of workout programs, this one won't sit around collecting dust. Little pain, lots of gain.

Join the party.",1148169600,13,326,4.241935483870968
2308780,3,B0009OUBGU,"I like this DVD because this type of dance offers a freedom of movement that is rare in other dance forms such as ballet.  However, I am looking for a cardio workout and while it does somewhat get your heartrate up, Kukuwa, the dance instructor, stops every five minutes to slap hands with the background dancers or the logo for the company comes on the screen. I usually march through these distracting intervals, but these interruptions do not allow for constant cardio.

It is sometimes discouraging that the instructor does not give any direction. By the time she tells you to do something she is already doing it. However, this was not enough to deter me from doing the workouts.

This is an excellent value because three different workouts are included, one is 30 min, 45 min and 60 min.  This offers great variety. The set is poolside, and there are men of women of different ages and races helping the instructor do the workout.

The moves include a lot of jumping, so be warned if you don't like doing high impact exercises or have bad knees or ankles. It also requires some space, more than I have in my dorm room, because of all the travelling moves. Occassionally, one of the women on the left shows a modified, lower-impact version of the exercises, but this is rare. Kukuwa constantly encourages you to shake your bunkie (your bum) and to just have fun. I don't think I could ever do this workout if people were watching me.

If you stick with, and aren't afraid to try something new you will enjoy this workout. You will definitely sweat with this one.",1142380800,80,1567,4.578571428571428
2308781,4,B0009OUBGU,"What I like most about this workout is that there is the option to try a 30, 45, or 60 minute routine. The 30 minute segment is too easy for a non-beginner, but the 45 and 60 minute routine gets your heart rate up.  At times, the moves are a little repetitive, but what's great is that if you are a fast learner, Kukawa ""keeps it moving..."" she doesn't slow down to over-explain the moves.  I like that because a lot of DVDs take too much time showing how to perform relatively simple moves. Also, I like how the performers were not ""Hollywood Hotties,"" but just regular looking people.  The last thing I want to look at when I'm working out are several pairs of silicone implants! The music would've been better if it were live, and I would've liked to hear a little ""cultural"" explanation of where some of the moves derived from. Overall-- a great DVD to add to your repertoire.",1140912000,17,880,4.386503067484663
2308782,4,B0009OUBGU,"If you like workouts where they don't stop, this is for you. There are three workouts, the first is 30 min, the second is 45 min & the third is 60 min.  It's the woman in the picture with 3 girls & 2 guys (all athletic) behind her on what looks like a mansion's backyard w/a pool & palm trees behind. The music is semi decent for a workout video, no lyrics, just music w/a good fast beat that has a Caribbean feel.
She doesn't give that many dance instruction, out of the entire DVD, she only 1-2x ever slows down or counts. One or more dancers will show the modified/slower version of the moves, sometimes out of tiredness themselves, they start dropping, though I can't blame them, LOL.
All the moves are relatively simple, mostly cha-chas, merenges & simple African moves, steps, mambos, jumps, etc. If there's anything she thinks is a little harder, she breaks it down, but she is always moving.
The first workout was very simple & though fast, the moves were uninspiring, more aerobics then dance & I didn't like it.
The second & third had better moves that you've seen around at gyms or clubs, etc. more sexy & cool then the 1st, but nothing that hip.
I was sweating & could not keep up at all for the life of me. If you want to sweat & pass out, here you go!
Take off 2 stars if you expect complicated or stylish moves, non-repetition or great music.

2308783,5,B0009OUBGU,"I just got this DVD yesterday (I know it is not yet released... I guess I'm lucky!) and I LOVEEEE IT! I started by doing the 30 minutes workout and even though sometimes it's a bit hard to follow, you get used to it very quickly, and I'm officially not a dance pro!

It's fun and not boring like most exercise DVDs.

It gets you moving a lot, very good for the cardio.

You have the choice between 3 workouts, one is 30 minutes, the other one is 45 and the last one is 60. So even if you don't have a lot of time, you can do it!

I recommended it to all my friends, amazing! =)",1125619200,16,577,3.864406779661017
2308794,5,B0009OUBGU,"I love this high energy, fun workout!  Three workouts included; 30 min, 45 min and 60 min so you can always find the time to do one.  Kakuwa's attitude is infectious; she is sunny, encouraging and supportive.  The workouts are a combination of african, latin and caribbean dance.  Loads of fun and the time flies by. My new favorite workout DVD.",1280793600,,345,4.60655737704918
2308795,5,B0009OUBGU,"I always preview workout dvds and after watching the 45 min. segment, I thought it would be a while until I would be ready to do it.......but!  after doing the 1st one (the 1/2 hr one) several times I was ready for the next one.  wait ! I'm getting ahead of myself! I've been doing dance workouts for about 4,5 months now and have a background in ballet, but I've never moved like I do in Kukuwa's dvd, my lungs were burning and I felt muscles being used that I didn't remember having!  lol  It felt so good; in a hard, gasping for air, sort-a way.....anyways, after doing the 45 min one, I realized that getting caught up in not being qued like I've been used to and worrying about the movement was ""my bad"" ....when I found myself laughing along with the dancers in the workout I was able to ""let go"" and the moves were SOOOOO much easier to do!  I had a blast and am looking forward to when I can move up to her 60 min. workout.  Until then the other 2 are a great addition to my other dance workouts. Doing a different form of dance (almost everyday) helps mix it up for my brain, which gets bored quickly...Kukuwa is awesome!!!!  Now go have some fun while blasting off all the jigglies!  ;)",1262995200,,1196,4.214912280701754
2308796,4,B0009OUBGU,"Wow! I have yet to master this DVD. You get 3 versions and i must say as much as i love it, i have not been able to run though the 45min and the 60min versions without taking breaks here and there. I like the mixture of African dances with Latin moves.",1261958400,2,252,3.8653846153846154
2308797,5,B0009OUBGU,This is a just plain fun. I'm ordering my second copy of this workout because my old one is worn out.,1232409600,,101,3.857142857142857
2308798,5,B0009OUBGU,"I really enjoy this dvd.  The music encourages you to keeping moving.  The dances are pretty easy to catch on and I'm not a great dancer.  The first time I used the dvd, I was sweating in the inside of my elbows! And it was just the warmup. Worth the investment!",1232409600,,262,4.098039215686274
2308799,5,B0009OUBGU,"The Kukuwa Dance Workout is very exciting to me.  It keeps you moving and I learned some pretty cool dances at the same time.  I don't usually break a sweat, but this Dance Workout changed all of that.  I am so glad my friend introduced me to this so a quickly made this puchase.  It is worth it.  It is something quick and anyone can keep up with it.  Trust me, if I can keep up so can you lol.",1203206400,2,395,3.875
2308800,5,B0009OUBGU,"I disagree with the reviewer who said the instructor slowed down too much, doing high fives and the frequent interruptions.  Everybody knows if you don't want to stop moving, you run in place or jump rope. Or get water or wipe the sweat off your face. Not hard to figure out.

In terms of the workout, cueing could be better, however, it is a DVD and rewind is always an option. It is presupposed with ownership of the DVD that you will do this more than once and, therefore, you will pick up the moves.

This DVD dovetails nicely with other types of dance instruction, including W. African and Latin/Caribbean.  I like the music.  It is really one heck of a workout....sweat, sweat, sweat, and the movement IS constant.  She does a good job of addressing the core with fun moves that don't really feel like hard work until you wake up the next day.

I have an excellent W. dance background (ballet mostly) and find this to be a very challenging routine, have done it more than half a dozen times and am still mastering the moves for segment one.  This is exactly what I need to keep it fun and challenging.  However, I also take W. African dance twice a week in my local community, as well as samba, so maybe this tape will not resonate with folks who aren't 'into' the moves or music of Africa.

An excellent purchase, IMHO.  FANTASTIC instructor!!!!!!!",1189209600,17,1355,4.489795918367347
2308801,5,B0009OUBGU,"Kukuwa's workout incorporates Latin and African moves in a fast paced full body exercise. You will be ready to dance!

After her basic Kirango workout I go to my desk job feeling pumped and like I have just had a lower back massage.  She really gets you moving and feeling good about yourself!",1183075200,6,293,4.509433962264151

2308803,4,B0009OUBGU,I'm not exactly a beginner and the 30 minute segment got me sweating. It has fun combination of simple dance movements. For those who don't dance -me included- the steps are easy to learn after a few times.  Remember this is not a dance video. It's a dance workout video. Kukuwa also is very energetic and her personality makes this an enjoyable workout.,1178496000,3,354,4.619047619047619
8064678,3,B0009OUBGU,"Looks fun but they don't spend enough time teaching you the moves at all...Hard to get a good workout when your trying to figure out how to do a move. Good if you are a fast learner, are okay with continuously pausing and rewinding to figure things out, or if you are already familiar with the dances.",1456358400,,301,4.298245614035087
8064679,5,B0009OUBGU,"LOVE this workout DVD! I hate workout DVDs in general and I've tried everything. My knees are shot and it's very difficult to find workouts that do not require awkward repetitive moves that put loads of stress on the knees (cough....beachbody...cough) AND are not boring and uninspiring.

Kukuwa Africa Dance provides a FULL body workout and really makes you sweat! Best of all is that the dance moves are not painful on the joints and as long as you are moving you are getting a full body workout. The time flies by! The film work could be better, as some of the angles make it difficult to follow the moves, but again, they are not too difficult to follow and you feel like you are really dancing, as opposed to doing choreographed workouts. The DVD is simple, which I appreciate. There is no huge learning curve with these dances. Just pop it in and get moving!",1453939200,2,864,4.538461538461538
8064680,5,B0009OUBGU,Great investment really tone and enjoyable workout. Thank you for the next skills.,1446595200,,82,5.384615384615385

8064682,4,B0009OUBGU,"I love this DVD. It is a fast work out and each separate workout is different.
My only issue is sometimes the leader changes workouts with out alerting the user, but i guess that is what rewind is for! Great DVD to use in the winter when you don't feel like going to the gym. That's how I use it, living in the Midwest, you have to be able to work out even during the crazy snow storms!!",1357603200,,387,3.9743589743589745
8064683,5,B0009OUBGU,"This is so much fun that I really can't say enough about it!!! The instructor is so energetic and seems like such a real and encouraging person! I find her absolutely charming and lovable. The moves are sexy, fast, and really get those muscles in shape and that heart rate up!! I foolishly tried to jump to the 60 minute version the very first time I did it...I think I forgot about my extra 40+ lbs I need to lose and the fact that I am 47!! LOL...I suggest start at the 30-minute routine first and then build up!!! I love this DVD and do it several times a week!! It is definitely worth getting for anyone who wants to have a great time while getting in great shape! A lot of the moves are just plain sexy and I really love that!!!",1346716800,,733,4.1328671328671325
8064684,5,B0009OUBGU,This is a great video and a great way to break up the normal workout routine and still get the cardio workout you expect.  You can tell it's not rehearsed.  Seemed very real. I like it.,1309305600,,185,4.111111111111111
8064685,4,B0009OUBGU,"Make sure you clear the way before you start doing this workout. There is lot's of jumping and traveling moves. I do like it, I just wish that there was more African style dancing than anything else.",1293840000,,199,4.405405405405405
8064686,2,B0009OUBGU,This had dance moves but I just did not get the feeling of dancing. It really felt like a regular aerobics class. I have taken and was looking for more dance. and maby more authentic music to go with the dance.,1290816000,,210,4.146341463414634
8064687,5,B0009OUBGU,"I haven't done the 30 minutes dance workout yet, but I have done the 45 minutes and 60 minutes workouts and I have to say these are fun workout. Kukuwa doesn't cue that much, but in my opinion, if you watch the exercises more than once, before trying it or even doing them, even if you mess up a couple of times, you will eventually get them down. I know that although, I am a fast learner. I have messed up on a few steps, but I will not give up. I will master those steps.

Kukuwa and her crew gives you a front view, back view and side view of the exercises. Since your back is towards the TV, you might find the back view to be a little complicated at first, but if you memorize what you have done in the front view, the back view will get easier for you to do. You will not have to turn your head back to see what they are doing.

I recommend this dance workout dvd to anyone that likes to do African and Latin dance or just either of the two. It's a fun workout. Kukuwa has a lively spirit.",1284249600,,996,3.9502487562189055
