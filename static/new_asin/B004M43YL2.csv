The intro is the season 3 version of the 80's cartoon and the original title sequence INCLUDING the first song is sloppily cut out. I Loved this series ever since I was a kid so you can imagine how my sank when I noticed. No TV series movie or cartoon should be subjected to this kind of editing. It's useless and annoying. Please stop.

I ordered the original series volume 1 from the UK in hopes that the full version is in there. I'll edit this review when I get it.

[UPDATE]
I got the ""Care Bears: Volume 1"" DVD from the UK and it includes the unedited version!",1449446400,,684,4.464

8435492,5,B004M43YL2,"At first I wasn't sure weather or not I want to get this, cause I'm thinking it may be a botleg copy. I keep go in and out. So I went on and purchase this. It really is a real DVD copy but it doesn't have a DVD menu, but that's OK that doesn't matter. As long as I have my copy, it's all good. It came in from mail, I check the disc and it's in excellent condition. This special is my favorite out of the 2.",1343174400,,407,3.6363636363636362
