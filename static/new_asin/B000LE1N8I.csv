8161718,5,B000LE1N8I,Great Workout,1452297600,,13,6.0
8161719,4,B000LE1N8I,"Not my favorite, but still right up there with the rest of her stuff - 3 segments to choose from 20, 40 and 60 minutes; each builds on the prior...very good.",1365206400,,157,4.096774193548387
8161720,5,B000LE1N8I,I caught a view of Adrienne Reed's yoga workouts on tv.  I like her style and decided to go ahead and purchase a workout.  I love the workout!  There are a lot of moves that I will never be able to do but love attempting them.  I like that there are 3 different workouts on the dvd.  My hips feel so good after doing the workout.,1302652800,,329,3.9242424242424243
8161721,4,B000LE1N8I,"I am a pretty flexible person, but there has to be some knowledge of yoga positions before attempting this video - otherwise a lot of time is spent on positioning.  Also, there is no ""adapted"" yoga positions for any of it, so I sometimes felt that I was really stretching the wrong things, possibly doing something wrong since I couldn't put my feet in the right place.  With practice, this will probably be a good video, but is is def. frustrating at first.",1270080000,,458,4.506024096385542
8161722,2,B000LE1N8I,"The instructor leads you through a couple of sun salutations, not nearly enough to warm you up sufficiently, and then immediately puts you into pigeon pose for several minutes.",1269734400,,176,5.103448275862069
8161723,4,B000LE1N8I,"A great DVD to open your body.  Wonderful hip openning exercizes.  Not too sure if I like the format of the instruction, but the savasana is very relaxing!",1236297600,,155,4.5
8161724,4,B000LE1N8I,"This is a great stretching workout. Yes...I said workout. If you're looking to ""deepen your practice"" and find spiritual meaning that most of us get from church (not from pompous yoga gurus) then no, you probably won't like it. I won't give it 5 stars because the segments don't have a proper warmup. I solve that problem by using the segments as add-ons to other workouts, but not everyone will want to do that.",1174867200,5,412,4.581081081081081
