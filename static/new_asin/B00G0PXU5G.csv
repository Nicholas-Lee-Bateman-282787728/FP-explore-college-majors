I have to admit, I didn't make it to the end so maybe there is a surprise ending or something that would improve my rating.  I just couldn't get past the point of the main guy being faced over and over with death but being a smart-a__ and cracking unfunny jokes. It was just awful!!",1391904000,3,396,4.12987012987013

6042829,1,B00G0PXU5G,"(A few spoilers...)

The problems with this movie are too numerous to list individually, but let's just start with a script that painted itself into a corner (or a freezer) in the first opening scenes.  I think the goal was to create a claustrophobic atmosphere, but the problem with that is that unless the script is top-notch thriller material, the viewer gets bored looking at one unchanging set for the entire length of the movie.  Add to that the fact that the character played by Dylan McDermott is glib and smart-alecky in a situation where glib sarcasm could easily get him killed, and the whole film turns into a bad parody of itself and only gets worse from there.  The very fact that the McDermott character IS sarcastic and disrespectful of his captors was a strong clue as to his involvement from the start, and as such, again I felt the script was just hastily thrown together with little thought going into how people might act if this were REALLY happening to REAL people.

The other major issue I have with this movie is that the set depicts a large building where the character can run around, jog, climb up to another level to tinker with the electronics... but when you find out what the freezer REALLY is, any credibility goes flying right out the window and leaves the viewer rolling her eyes - IF she's still awake.

I normally don't review products I don't like, but this one was such a stinker that I had to make an exception.  If you want to rent a movie this weekend, avoid this one like the plague.  I should add that I can't really blame the actors - McDermott did the best he could with what he had, as did the rest of the cast.  Unfortunately... the script should have been thrown in the freezer and left for dead.",1390521600,5,1745,4.479495268138801
6042830,3,B00G0PXU5G,"""This is the rat. I'd bet my life on it."" Robert (McDermott) wakes up in a freezer with his wrists and ankles cuffed together and no idea why. When a gang of Russians come in they tell him he owes them 8 million dollars and won't let him go until they are repaid. When he realizes he isn't alone he is forced to make life and death decisions with every move he makes. This is a movie that although the idea has been done over and over still had potential. What it turned out to be was basically a version of the original Saw (without the gruesome chopping people up aspect). Man wakes up alone with no idea how he got there and must figure out who put him there and why. He sees someone else with him and must decide what to do next. The main difference is that this one has people coming in and out and more things happen but that is still the best way to describe it. The twist is both unexpected and predictable, when you watch it you will see what I mean. Overall, nothing amazing but not horrible either. A less horrific Saw type movie. I give it a C+.",1389916800,6,1057,4.111111111111111
6042831,5,B00G0PXU5G,This movie keeps you hooked from the start! Stepan (Milan Malisic) the main Russian mobster keeps scared for Roberts (Dylan McDermott) life. You never know what's going to happen next! Dylan and Milan keep you on your feet through out the whole movie and give you an amazing surprise ending!,1389830400,8,291,4.84
6042832,5,B00G0PXU5G,"The movie looks very good visually. Even better is the plot with the surprising end that I did not expect in a million years.
You have to watch the movie. I recommend to anyone who likes thrillers.",1389830400,5,197,4.351351351351352
6042833,3,B00G0PXU5G,"Robert (Dylan McDermott) wakes up in a freezer in the very first scene. The Russian mafia has him held there and they want their money. Robert claims he is a mechanic and offers his wallet, which is missing, and to take them to an ATM. The Russians are not amused. He has their money, the Russians don't make mistakes.

Robert is very chipper for a guy facing death. He is beat up and cold tortured, but nothing overly severe. You can figure out the first twist, and there are more to follow, none were really unexpected. Just as the film slows up, it introduces another character or twist keeping you engaged, but not overly entertained.

It isn't bad for a movie where 99% is filmed in one room as one might expect. The action/thriller aspect is more old school action/drama/thriller. Normally this is something I would love, except the characters didn't give me a convincing performance, nor was Robert a decent protagonist whose character we got to know late...i.e. it failed to hook me.

Makes for a rental.

6042834,5,B00G0PXU5G,This was a very good movie considering the fact that the entire movie was filmed inside of a freezer the whole time.,1398038400,,116,4.318181818181818
6042835,2,B00G0PXU5G,"I rented this at Redbox, and suggest you do the same instead of buying it. After watching the whole thing and finally understanding it, I have to say the plot was pretty good.  But watching it was a different matter - I'm not sure if I can explain this but I will try.  The primary character seems too unfazed at being stuck in the freezer, and his reactions to the Russian mobsters seem a bit off throughout the whole movie. I mean, if you were truly mistaken for someone else, and grabbed and stuck in a Freezer, I don't think you would be so fast to quip one-liners at the mobsters holding you. I got the feeling that they should have chosen a different actor, or the director should have pushed the actor some more.

After watching the whole thing, it is quite possible that my viewpoint is wrong, and that this sort of John McClane (Bruce Willis - Die Hard) character is doing so on purpose. Directors take heed: as a member of the viewing audience, I was put off the film and found it hard to believe until the very end - this is NOT a good place to stick your audience mentally. Instead of watching the movie, I found myself doing other tasks and just half-watching and listening to the movie in the background.

Anyhow, I think this COULD have been a great film if the main character had more ""genuine"" reactions; as it was, the poor acting or (to give the director benefit of the doubt) strange reactions are off-putting and distracting.",1395878400,,1446,4.424812030075188
6042836,4,B00G0PXU5G,This moves had so many twists and turns that you could not guess what was coming next. The acting was very good and the movie had a surprise ending that you will never guess is coming.,1395619200,,184,4.138888888888889
6042837,2,B00G0PXU5G,"This movie is ""on the Border"" of 2 and 3 stars. I don't think it made enough sense to be credible and thus enjoyable from a rational perspective. The progress of the plot seems to have been constructed on a dart board, throwing a dart to see what happens next. The characters are stereotypes. The conclusion makes the viewer scratch his head. Why then 3 stars? Well I watched it all, somewhat in the hope that it would make sense and be reasonably satisfying in some artistic sensibility. Dylan McDermott's character, the main one, is simply unbelievable in his attitude and actions. Actually, the more I think about this, the movie is a 2.",1395446400,,640,4.62280701754386
6042838,4,B00G0PXU5G,"The  suspense  was good, but the whole movie was in a freezer, storyline was  simple  writing. Dylan Mc. made it not bad with has acting talent, so i'll keep it and watch it again. It is now a part of my  movie collection, and I don't keep boring, weak movies. It is borderline as for as thumbs up or down, but trust me, Dylan McDermont is fantastic and gives energy to make it worth buying. You  need to see  him in the drama from TV episode series ""Dark Blue"" The best drama I've ever seen!! Soon I will buy all seasons.  (Jeff--)",1394841600,,532,4.147058823529412
6042839,1,B00G0PXU5G,Wow forget this movie !! It is so impractical it's not funny . Never finished it because it just never got my attention,1394064000,,119,4.217391304347826
6042840,3,B00G0PXU5G,"With the terrible temperatures we've been having this winter of 2014 my guess is most people would be hard pressed to rent or purchase a movie with a title like FREEZER. I'm hoping that isn't the case because this movie deserves to be seen. It's a tense thriller that keeps you guessing until the very end.

Dylan McDermott is Robert, a young man who wakes to find himself in a walk in freezer with his wrists and ankles strapped and no idea what is going on. Eventually two Russian mobsters come in and start asking him questions. Unhappy with his replies Robert turns into a punching bag for a while. It boils down to something they want, $8 million that they say he has and that they want back. Telling them he has no idea what they're talking about, that he was at a restaurant and went to use the bathroom only to wake here they leave him to consider what they want with the promise that they'll be back.

Robert frees himself from his bonds and begins to try and find a way out. The door is locked and the vent in the ceiling too small for him to fit through. The mobsters go back and forth, trying to convince him to give them the money. The second time they enter they bring along Alisa (Yuliya Snigir) and threaten her as well. Without the information or money they seek, Robert still can't help them.

The mobsters leave once more and Robert is soon startled to find someone else with him in the freezer, Sam Gurov (Peter Facinelli), the man the mobsters were looking for. It seems that Sam is an undercover policeman who infiltrated the Russian mob. Shot in a gun battle with the mobsters, he's severely wounded and in need of attention. He lets Robert know that the woman isn't another hostage but the girlfriend of the head mobster's son. The next time they mobsters return they soon discover Sam and deal with him.

With each visit the mobsters turn down the temperature in the freezer. With seemingly no way out it is up to Robert to use his brains to find any chance at all to survive. Having nothing to offer them he must take his chances with each visit. It's a struggle to survive not just the psychological and physical damage that they do to him each visit but to also survive the freezing temperatures as well. With the recent cold spell here in the Midwest sympathizing with his character became quite easy.

The movie may seem fairly straight forward but to say that all is not as it seems would be oversimplifying things. The best thing is that the twists and turns the movie takes come from out of left field so far that my guess is you won't see them coming. I know I didn't. For me that makes a more enjoyable film, one not so predictable that it becomes boring. Not only that but to tell this story in such a singular place as a freezer makes it even more of a treat since the film relies more on story telling and great performances to hold your interests. It does that from start to finish. This is a movie not to be missed and one that I think I'll hold on to. Who knows, maybe some sweltering day in the summer it will be one to bring out and remind me why it was I didn't enjoy winter.",1393372800,2,3119,4.3247863247863245

6042842,4,B00G0PXU5G,"I found this movie to be a very nice surprise. I took a risk on it because,  the previews looked good and, I do love a good mob thriller. The premise is that a seemingly innocent man (Dylan McDermott) who is beaten, kidnapped and wakes up in an industrial freezer. He was kidnapped by the Russian mob who think he knows where 8 million dollars is. Throw in one dirty cop, one half dead under cover cop, a Russian mob boss and one truly fantastic twist, it makes for a great movie.",1393113600,,480,4.217391304347826
6042843,4,B00G0PXU5G,"Being locked in a freezer is life-threatening enough without the added complications of communications barriers and the threat of bodily harm.  Bad guys willing to torture,  along with inceasing environmental perils, keep the tension high, while plot twists keep the story interesting and evolving as the audience seeks to discern the truth.  Not 5 stars because:  1) the ending seems hurried after the long build up, 2) dropping temperatures produced ice-coatings but never any visible breath, and 3) an obvious, plentiful supply of insulating cardboard resources that ought to have supplemented clothing goes unused.  These detractions, however, were not enough to take away from the enjoyment of a different kind of suspense thrill ride that takes place almost entirely in a walk-in freezer.",1393027200,,794,5.4227642276422765

8619946,4,B00G0PXU5G,This movie has you believing everything that is happening. You feel sympathy for Dylan's character as he seems to be truly suffering in the cold. The Freezer has a few plot twists throughout the movie to keep you guessing. It is a real thriller because the end turns out completely differently than you imagined and leaves you pondering and questioning everything in the movie. You almost have to watch it again to catch what you missed the first time.,1448755200,,452,4.734177215189874
8619947,3,B00G0PXU5G,"This is becoming a trend, first they film a movie that almost never leaves the phone booth, then Man on a Ledge and now Freezer. Yes you figured it out, this entire movie was filmed inside a freezer. Very limited action, some suspense and one or two twist at the end that may surprise you. A large portion of this film is in spoken Russian but the subtitles are easy to follow along and several parts do get translated. The acting is pretty good and the characters are all believable. The storyline is nothing spectacular but the film does hold your attention. I do not use spoiler alerts in my reviews but the entire cast of this film is less than 10 people.
