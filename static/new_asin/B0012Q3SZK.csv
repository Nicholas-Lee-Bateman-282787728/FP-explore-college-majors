8247175,1,B0012Q3SZK,Lame plot. Dragging storyline. OK acting. Not so sexualized as shown on cover. Michael par acts very well for a B movie!,1476230400,,120,4.5
8247176,3,B0012Q3SZK,"I enjoyed it, not a perfect film but a fun easy watch. Special fx were lacking but acting is pretty good, plot had some interesting elements to it. I wanted something other than ""kids to into the woods"" so this was refreshing",1384387200,,225,4.380952380952381
8247177,4,B0012Q3SZK,"Michael Pare was good, as usual.  This must have been one of Charles Dunning's last films.  He was always a good actor in eveything he did.",1365724800,,139,4.3076923076923075

Not experts in the Holy Texts might simply enjoy love-making if not the awful pimps on one's back, of which explicity did not reach a porno rating.",1333929600,2,239,5.128205128205129
8247179,1,B0012Q3SZK,"HELP....why am I addicted to bad movies? I know there are better ways to use my time.  I could be helping the poor, saving the sea lions, or just doing the dishes...but instead I'm watching KINKY KILLERS.  What can be said about this pile of puss that the other reviewers haven't already said?  This reminds me of the slop I used to sit through at the triple feature drive-in when I was a teenager.  I used to eat that stuff up because it seemed a bit un-wholesome, naughty and subversive.  Actually it was really just crap but, being young, I didn't know the difference.  Now I know the difference and I'm still subjecting myself to this kind of torture.  Anyway, this turkey makes no sense whatsoever.  The acting is pathetic, the continuity doesn't exist, and you will hate everyone in it.  The ""rock star"" was a dufuss, the cops were unlikeable, and the women weren't naked enough to keep me interested.  Charles Durning is funny only because he looks like he's already dead and is spouting off some of the most inane dialogue this side of Ed Wood.  Unfortunately, he's only in it for a few seconds.  Michael Pare should know better, but when has he ever had a good role.  The satanic plot line unfolds so badly that you don't really care.  Even the ""kinky"" is a falsehood.  What was so kinky about it?  It says this is from the best-selling author Kenneth Del Vecchio.  I guess I can cross him off my book list, but then again, I've never heard of him anyway.  Besides that, he can't act (yes, he even has a part in this bomb).  I can't say that I was bored, just dumbfounded.  If that was the intended purpose then they succeeded beyond their wildest dreams.  Hmmmm....I wonder if there is a re-hab group just for bad movie addicts.  My life is spiraling down to the darkest pits of hell and I don't know how to get out.  I always feel like I just need one more!  Help me please!!!",1292025600,3,1887,4.402898550724638

The Kinky Killer is a B rated drive in affair to watch on a marathon of Stinking Bad horror films. B rated scream queen  Shannon Tweed (who thanksfully is not in this movie!) has done better toles playing a shrink than the women who play the shrinks in this film. This film is so misdirected and mis-scripted that you will be bored before you ever get any idea of a plot. The cops seem like bad cops from Law and Order SCN (Stupid Crazy Nutjobs)

Who is wasted in this film is the acting talents of Charles Durning and Micheal Pare. Both deserve better films than this one...they both must have needed the money!  What annoys me  more is both actors are on screen so short a time. About three scenes apiece!

The public can't makes head or tails of this horror whodunit.

I would rate it less than one star, but they won't take that rating at Amazon. So miss this film...YOU HAVE BE WARNED!

ALSO BEWARE of friends loaning movies that they say you will enjoy!

8247181,1,B0012Q3SZK,"Kinky killers is so boring.  The script is poorly written and all the characters protrayed in this film is flat.  The main reason for me to buy this DVD is because of Michael Pare.  however, I am so disappointed that he is not the male lead in the film (or may be there isn't any lead actor/actress in the film, now you can imagine how bad this film is).
Michael's talent is totally wasted.

Yes, there are many killing shot and sex scene.  But all are badly done.
It doesn't not reach the ""unrated"" standard. The most is ""NC17"".

Michael had one full nude shot when he had sex in doggie style, you could hear him moaned but the scene was shot in wide shot and it only lasted for few seconds.

It's not worth buying it, if you are Michael's fan, just rent it. But
don't expect too much.",1210982400,8,786,4.2
