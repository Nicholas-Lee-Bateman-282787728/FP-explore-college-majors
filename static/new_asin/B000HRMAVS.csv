2640110,1,B000HRMAVS,"Edward Burns may be talented actor, but as a writer/director he seems to specialize in myopic boorish ""male chick flicks"" (McFlicks?).
Halfway through this film I thought ,""hey,noone's going to give me back those 45 minutes"" and put the DVD back in the box.
You've seen it all before,and if you care about these shallow cliched
characters,perhaps you'll have a good time (watching the film was like being with relatives you don't care for). Me,I'll look for him in ""Private Ryan"" and kick myself for opening the DVD before selling it as used on Amazon!!",1163116800,,553,4.831578947368421
2640111,4,B000HRMAVS,"I Just reviewed LOOKING FOR KITTY, Ed Burns' other neglected 2006 release.  This is the finer film (That one is OK, too), a very plausible slice-of-life looking at a group of mid-thirties guys looking at their lives when one, Burns, is getting married (to Brittany Murphy, who has prominence on the cover, and is important, but secondary to the male leads).  It's well-tread territory, but Burns has an excellent supporting cast (John Leguiziamo, Jay Mohr, Donnell Logue and Matthew Lillard, who gives his best performance to date) and doesn't force things; there are several well-played scenes where the actors get to do their thing.

The state of theatrical film release in 06 is such that this crowd-pleaser barely got out of New York and L.A., which is a shame; in a summer of overheated overpriced Hollywood flicks it was a nice change of pace.  Of course, the dvd box has that ""REAL GENIUS/ MODERN LOVE what where they thinking?"" photoshop quality -- Burns is never seen wearing that ridiculous shirt at any time in the movie (it looks like its 1985 and he's going to the Flock of Seagulls concert or something), nor does he ever carry her on his shoulders like that.  The theatrical poster showed the five guys in a bar having a drink, and that should've stayed the cover, as it didn't mislead the viewer.  The film is a comedy, but it's not a WEDDING CRASHERS comedy, definitely more of a meeting of BIG CHILL or RETURN OF THE SECAUCUS SEVEN with THE BREAKFAST CLUB.  Take a look.",1161561600,15,1488,4.67816091954023
2640112,1,B000HRMAVS,"On the front of the box it says ""Till death do we party"". The back mentions ""a week long raucous bachelor party filled with laughs at every turn"". The back of the backs even uses the phrase ""in this comedy"". IT IS NOT A COMEDY! They frigging lied! It is a seriously depressing movie with few laughs at all!",1264464000,,306,4.203389830508475
2640113,4,B000HRMAVS,"Burns' writing really bottomed out with ""Ash Wednesday"" and to an extent he had really been declining since ""She's the One"". One of the chief frustrations in watching his films is the casting implausibilities and unrealistic situations he puts his characters through. This film thankfully did not have those problems and it really was entertaining to watch through.

Minor points but they somewhat bothered me............#1 if the characters are all 33-35 and Jay Mohr has a 2006 inspection sticker in his window, these characters were between ages 6-8 when Loverboy's ""Turn me Loose"", Eddie Money's ""Shakin'"" and Marshall Crenshaw's ""Someday, Someway"" were playing on the radio, which means 1980-1982. I didn't get the connection as to why this particular music meant anything to these characters who were 6-8 at the time.

#2..........if you tell me in the script that the Brittany Murphy character is pregnant and this is the reason for the impending wedding, does she need to hold her stomach in every single ensuing scene to reminds us she is pregnant? Watch for this and it will drive you crazy as you watch her scenes. I just didn't understand the need for her to be holding her belly in every single scene she was in this movie.
We get it, she's pregnant.

But again, I think Edward Burns refound his way here and this was an enjoyable movie to watch. The characters were likeable and the viewer was interested in them and seeing them solve their problems.",1208908800,2,1464,4.895161290322581
2640114,3,B000HRMAVS,"It seems like all these Burns films have similar stories and similar characters.  When you've seen one, you've seen them all.  This one is mildly entertaining, but it really drags.  Here we've got guys in their 30's going through a mid-life crisis.  I guess Burns will just keep doing these as he gets older and next we'll have guys in their 40's going through a mid-life crisis, then guys in their 50's, etc. etc.",1200009600,2,414,4.554054054054054
2640115,5,B000HRMAVS,"Edward Burns has filmed a great hit with ""The Groomsmen"".  The casting was fantastic, and the story line felt personal.  The film is as much about his friends as it is himself and that draws you in and you make an emotional tie with just about all of the characters.  If you haven't seen this movie, you should!  **Matthew Lillard - my hats off to you and you awesome job acting in this role.",1191283200,3,392,4.256756756756757
2640116,3,B000HRMAVS,"Brothers McMullen and She's The One are 2 of my favourite comedies so I will always check Burns's films.  This is probably his fourth best after Sidewalks of New York, which means it's a good film.  Because the other 3 are brilliant.  Great cast of funny characters with the typical Burns' scribed relationship problems.  See it.",1168300800,2,329,4.821428571428571
2640117,5,B000HRMAVS,"""The Groomsmen"" is a heartwarming drama/comedy about a group of friends in their thirties as Paulie, played by Ed Burns, prepares for his wedding.

Burns' fans will be treated to the same elements that worked so well in his other films, including an ensemble cast.  The interaction between the friends was truly enjoyable.  We all know and can relate to people just like this.  But this film goes even deeper, delving into adult themes like infertility and a gay character's struggle to come out to friends and family.

Matthew Lillard was terrific as Dez, who with humor and heart, articulated how parenthood enriches your life in ways previously unimaginable. We will definitely be seeing more of Lillard in the future.

Jay Mohr as Mike was a hilarious surprise. His Cousin Mike was outrageous and funny, but we do see glimpses of his sensitive side when he tries to reconcile with his old girlfriend.

John Leguziamo plays TC, who has been out of town, and has to face issues with friends and reconcile with family.

I saw this film at a New York screening when it first opened in July, where Mr. Burns was present to answer questions and share personal behind-the-scenes stories.  He clearly loves what he does.

It is odd that other reviewers are comparing this film to the comedy, ""The Wedding Crashers""; there is no resemblance whatsoever.  It is also unfortunate that Burn's performance is criticized; as the writer/director, he could have easily made his character steal the show in each scene. I see his character as the low key, mostly sensible one, to contrast with the issues of the other characters.

After seeing ""The Groomsmen,"" I watched ""Diner,"" which I had not seen in years. The films both revolve around friends before a wedding, with ""Diner"" featuring actors in their 20s, and ""The Groomsmen"" actors in their 30s. They both deal with universal themes of friendship, disagreement, life choices, and all the emotion that entails.

If you're in the mood for a realistic slice-of-life drama/comedy that doesn't include any car chases, explosions, or aliens, give this film a try.",1165017600,2,2098,4.926136363636363
2640118,3,B000HRMAVS,"The Groomsmen is a movie about growing up and dealing with the facts of life as one approaches the thirty- something years. This movie features Edward Burns who stars, directs, and wrote this movie. He plays Paulie, a man who is more stable than the guys he has chosen for his wedding party but who starts to fall apart as his wedding day draws nearer. He is starting to wonder whether or not he should really get married and talking to his brother and friends only complicates matters. He is starting to doubt how he feels even though, deep down inside, his feelings are true. It appears to be an instance of cold feet but it is up to Paulie to figure this out and he has only seven days to come to his senses.

Each of the five friends/family in this movie has some sort of personal problem/issue and this forms the basis of the film. The guys are a little juvenile at times and a little abrasive at others. They are outspoken and yet they have a difficult time expressing certain personal concerns. This basically sums up what the movie is all about. It isn't a goofy slapstick comedy about a guy and his wedding party. In fact, there are no actual wedding scenes relating to the movie until the end when the credits roll. This is actually a movie about family matters, friendship, confession, reconciliation, and acceptance.

This movie is part comedy and part drama with the bulk of the time spent on serious moments and emotional trauma. I watched this film hoping for some comedy but I wasn't disappointed with what I got. The Groomsmen is generally a serious movie and I admit I wasn't impressed when I started to view it. At first, it appeared to be an annoying waste of time with a bunch of guys drinking away their problems, allowing their tempers to flare at each other, and trying to reconnect with their younger days. The film slowly takes shape near the end when the pieces start to fall into place.

Performances in this film are nice and those who view will likely find someone they can relate to. Emotions run high in this movie, whether it's an adrenaline- fueled outburst or a personal moment between one of the guys and his wife. And the guys and girls in this movie are effective in conveying these emotions. Ironically, Edward Burns himself might be the least acceptable of the cast. His Paulie character is a little stiff and Burns performance is nothing exceptional. But he is still adequate and the support he gets from those around him easily compensate for his own blandness.

The Groomsmen isn't a film that will appeal to everyone. The primary audience for this movie is thirty something males and the women who live with them. The movie seems a little shallow at first and I know that some viewers will be turned off by the constant cussing and the physical fighting. But I must give Edward Burns credit for taking what looked to be a hodgepodge of a film and turning it into a worthwhile piece of entertainment with a messages that ring clear: Communicate, be honest, and let others know how you feel. Don't wait until tomorrow to get something off your chest. Be true to yourself and let your feelings be known. Too much waiting and you could miss out on some of the best years of your life.",1164585600,4,3224,4.534364261168385
2640119,3,B000HRMAVS,"It looks like a fun movie, but it's not really funny.  It's kind of sad and annoyingly tiring as you watch grown men hmmm and hawww as they decide whether to do the various right things or not.

Of course they all do, mostly, in the end, albeit still with a sort of adolescent crescendo of silliness and overstated comaradarie that also gets kind of old.

What this is, actually, is something of a male drama about five ""30 something"" friends going through various stages of life, trying to be supportive and helpful to each other as they prepare for one of their ""own's"" weddings.  It's okay, it's fairly well edited, it's sometimes interesting, and it's full of talented actors and actresses, but it's still not outstanding entertainment.

This could be a decent rental on a rainy day but never quite crosses the threshold into solid entertainment.  Some good moments and commentary on married and single life, parents and friends.  Not highly recommended, but not too bad, either.",1164326400,10,983,4.815476190476191
2640120,5,B000HRMAVS,"I liked this movie I should have done 4/5, but because of the harshness of the others i bumped it up. I felt this was a solid fun movie. Certainly not a classic, but highly enjoyable. Anybody comparing it to Wedding Crashers is missing the point. It is not a straight comedy. I'm not a reviewer, but the attacks on this movie forced me to write one.",1164326400,4,349,4.223880597014926
2640121,1,B000HRMAVS,"I thought this looked funny.  It was compared to Wedding Crashers.  I never laughed.  I kept watching this and when it ended I felt like I had wasted about 1 1/2 hours.  I wanted to throw the movie away, but then was thankful that I rented it, not paid for it.  Save your money.  ""Friends with Money"" offered more laughs that this movie.",1164153600,,337,4.26984126984127

8140817,4,B000HRMAVS,"I actually wanted to give the Groomsmen a rating of 3 out of 5 stars but then I realized (like an hour into it) that I wasn't ignoring the majority of the pointless arguments taking place between all the characters as much as I initially thought.

The storyline is honestly just a bunch of 30-something year old immature guys preparing for a wedding.  Among the group are two brothers, and two friends.

Throughout the film we find out about each of the guys, how they grew up, their many secrets, and how they are preparing for the upcoming wedding.  The most obvious problem is that, as I mention above- there's nothing but one argument after another taking place between the friends, so while watching the movie you might feel like you're slowly becoming immature yourself!

Interesting approach not focusing on the actual wedding though.  I also wish Brittany Murphy would have received a bigger role.  She was basically pushed in the background so the guys could be the main center of attention.

There's also a LOT of swearing taking place- be prepared for that.  Swearing, immature characters, and a storyline that's basically nothing but a big party scene involving numerous drunk arguments and a weak attempt to form a rock band and perform music together.  That about sums it up... and I liked it, haha.  I'd definitely understand if someone really despised a film like this, though.  Honestly a good portion of the storytelling is nonexistent, but there you have it.",1294185600,,1477,4.840637450199203

8140819,1,B000HRMAVS,"This movie was one of the worse movies I have ever seen. Way too dragged out. The fact that it was closed caption (word for word on bottom of TV screen) made this movie even more worse then it was. The writting on the bottom of the TV screen was so distracting, I couldn't wait for it to be over. Missed the last 10 minutes had to shut it off. The story was so boring and just not interesting. My husband absolutely hated the movie and left the room after 15 minutes into it. I love Edward Burns, but this movie was a bomb.",1265500800,,523,4.038461538461538
