5978425,2,B00FDZ7W2G,"When the first movie of a collection defies your willing suspension of disbelief, it's hard to press on. Examples abound: Patrick Swayze enters a building whose sole elevator is one of those two person vertical lift coffins, which is out of service, so he has to walk up seven flights - to a dance studio which is a large suite of rooms, filled with scores of people, and the largest room looks is the size of a grand ballroom! Or a construction site, with an inexplicably massive A-frame steel structure laying out in the street, a worker directing traffic where no direction is necessary, and a street musician standing on the A-frame playing a solo violin, which carries over the traffic noise to the other side of the street with perfect power and clarity! This movie is stupider than the average comic book, and insulting to the viewer's intelligence. Movie making this stupid could only be redeemed by sequences of exploding dictators' heads.

5978426,5,B00FDZ7W2G,I bought this 'cause the Care Center seemed to love musicals & they loved these shows.  When it was over the Aide got yelled at 'cause the one guy said he was watching that (84 yrs old) but they were over & she had to replay it!  lol,1414627200,6,233,3.8333333333333335
5978427,5,B00FDZ7W2G,"I have only watched one of the 50 Song and Dance Classics.  It was ""Royal Wedding"" with Fred Astaire.  I have a 102"" front projector screen and surround sound.  Every two weeks a group of seniors come over and we watch old movies.  They especially like musicals with happy ending. They are in the 60's, 70's and 80's.  This was a great movie and they enjoyed it.  Even if we only watch a few of these movies it is worth the price. The quality of the movies is good, not excellent,but most of us can't tell much of a different, since they are old movies, and that''t the way we first saw them.",1409097600,29,592,4.1946902654867255
