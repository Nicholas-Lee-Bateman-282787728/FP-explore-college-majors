8292335,5,B001D8I94C,Great video on the turtle.  I picked this up to learn how to defend this position.  Instead Telles turns it into an attacking game.,1481500800,,131,4.416666666666667
8292336,5,B001D8I94C,Easy to understand.... great for those of us who find ourselves stuck in turtle and what to do next,1474329600,,99,4.2631578947368425
8292337,3,B001D8I94C,"Not great for No Gi, but there are plenty techniques that transition. A lot of this seems to be focused around countering the clock choke, but it's a great eye opener for the position. There are a few techniques that I've picked up that work great. Definitely worth a watch.",1466640000,,274,4.5

8292341,5,B001D8I94C,"You should check this out. In my own experience i prefer to turtle rather then except the pass and be in side control and as a white belt found my self in turtle a lot I've had this for years was my second instructional I bought and still review it quarterly the turtle stuff is so good it made it  five star material

There is a down side the octopus guard is incomplete and likely not for everyone but cool have in your toolbox",1386374400,,429,4.095238095238095
8292342,5,B001D8I94C,"I wish to thank Eduardo Telles for his cool sharing of the turtle game and the octopus game, which is from my opinion the essence of BJJ. As a struggling white belt, Eduardo and his excellent mate Elan on these DVD's have opened my eyes on a new way of considering myself into space when sparring, not as the simple dual scenario of a top player and under player, but as a combination of rolls  using the concept of a shell both defending and attacking, without ending. It changes my journey and I keep on watching Eduardo give us the key points from DVD one. I appreciate the cool and peaceful personnality of this amazing and efficient BJJ black belt as a real model. Thanks again for the nice work!",1296086400,3,701,4.392307692307693
