3589314,5,B001FVK5WQ,My younger children like watching the animals and my older son can learn.  There is always a narrative of facts about the animals being shown.,1367712000,,142,4.68
3589315,5,B001FVK5WQ,"Very interesting video for yang biologists! Interesting animals, facts from their lives... Interactive, informative and memorable information. Whole family can enjoy to watch it together.",1367452800,,187,6.52
3589316,2,B001FVK5WQ,I bought this DVD and a few more of the Animal Atlas- I was extremely disappointed the there is so much evolution teaching! These are videos for little kids to learn about animals not evolution!!!!!!! I agree with the other parent- it was disappointing all these videos are filmed at a zoo or animal park. Also the same video of the lion of Animal Passport is the same footage from the other Animal Atlas videos!,1333584000,10,412,4.506666666666667
3589317,5,B001FVK5WQ,My son recieved this DVD as a gift and can't get enough of it.  The footage is absoulutely stunning and the animal facts are fun and friendly.  I have already pre-ordered the next one.  Highly Reccomend,1233705600,3,202,4.555555555555555
3589318,3,B001FVK5WQ,"My 5 year old animal-loving son seemed to like this DVD well enough when we watched it for the first time, but I was annoyed to see that all the animals were filmed in zoos or wild animal parks with fences and cement barriers clearly visible in the shots.  In an apparent attempt to minimize this, most of the shots were framed very tightly - head and shoulders, mostly.

 The narrative contains a solid stream of facts and isn't cloying as it can be in some videos marketed to younger kids, but telling us that the lion roams the grasslands in search of prey, while we see a lion lying down in a dusty enclosure with a fence behind him was less than impressive.",1233273600,32,662,4.32258064516129
3589319,5,B001FVK5WQ,"This DVD is great.  The footage is really high-quality, PLUS it's totally kid-friendly.  Nothing violent, but still realistic.  I got this for my niece and nephew who are 5 & 9, and they both love it.  If you have a kid in your life who loves animals- this is for them!",1229299200,4,269,4.215686274509804
8302768,5,B001FVK5WQ,"Animal Atlas is the way to go if you desire the ""lighter side"" of the Animal Kingdom....all of these DVDs are ""wonderfully amazing"" with great narration from Eric Schwartz....this guy has the ""perfect"" voice!!  FUN with GOOD HUMOR....highly recommended for ""all animal lovers"" of  ""any age"" who desire the ""lighter side"".... :)",1501286400,,327,5.269230769230769
8302769,5,B001FVK5WQ,"Our 3-year-old is absolutely obsessed with this DVD...He loves going to the zoo, and animals in general. This DVD is actually quite good, and my wife and I have enjoyed watching it as well (at least the first 100 times). We picked it up after seeing the advertisements for it on our son's Dino Dan DVDs. It is well made and offers a ton of fantastic information on the various animals. I have read a few complaints about the footage being of animals in captivity rather than in the wild. This is a nonissue for me. It does not matter, and the footage is great. There are tons of close up segments with animals that kids love, and the information given about each one is really interesting. There is no graphic content like zebras meeting their demise at the jaws of a lion. It's good, clean, informative fun. I highly recommend this DVD to all the parents of little animals lovers out there.",1465603200,,891,4.47239263803681
8302770,5,B001FVK5WQ,My son has a few of these movies and really likes them. I would recommend any of them.,1439683200,,86,3.8333333333333335

8302773,5,B001FVK5WQ,"I bought this for my grandsons, ages 3 and 5 1/2, who are lovers of ""all things animal"", including sea creatures and dinosaurs! It is one of their all time favorite videos to watch. I am planning on purchasing a few more in this series, so they won't get tired of watching the same one, and have different ones to watch.",1414713600,,320,4.262295081967213

8302777,5,B001FVK5WQ,I bought this DVD for my son and it has paid off several times over!! My son absolutely loves it! Not only does he love it he learns from it. During a trip to my mom's we stopped by her local zoo. Jacob was able to name animals(some I had not heard of until Animal Atlas) w/o looking at the signs and tell several facts about them! I highly recommend!,1368748800,,351,4.0285714285714285
