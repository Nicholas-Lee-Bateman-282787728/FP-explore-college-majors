8222746,2,B000WCVIF2,"Not much information to be had here.  I guess someone thought putting girls into a video about video games would sell more.  That would be great if these people knew how to interview or ask a basic question.  You're better off hunting down a ""found"" copy of 'Chasing Ghosts'.  It's more personal and actually finds a way to deliver information wrapped in personality.  This is garbage.",1406851200,,385,4.7727272727272725
8222747,5,B000WCVIF2,Rob is the greatest. The DVD is so informative and entertaining. This is definitely the best of the podcast! and Volume 2 is even better!,1238544000,,137,4.52
8222748,1,B000WCVIF2,"At first I thought this would be a great companion piece for ""The King of Kong"".  However, halfway through the show, the DVD sputtered and skipped.

Defective.

Caveat Emptor or buyer beware!",1227657600,3,191,4.90625
8222749,5,B000WCVIF2,"As a diehard classic coin op game collector, this compilation of reviews of games and interviews, including Walter Day, is excellent. There are many games covered and well-known collectors interviewed. This is a great video for anyone that enjoys classic coin op games!",1213488000,,269,5.27906976744186
8222750,5,B000WCVIF2,"This DVD is a real treat for a classic gamer like me.  There are lots of interesting interviews with people across the spectrum of the hobby-- collectors, players, world-record champions, artists, and even industry insiders.  It plays out like a real cable TV show, not just some amateur blogger's shaky web cam.  It's also a good companion piece to the film ""King of Kong"".  If you liked that movie, you will also enjoy this, as a lot of the principal people in that story are seen here as well, expanding even further on the classic gaming scene.  Especially cool was an in-depth segment on the classic Laser-Disc arcade games like Dragon's Lair, Cliffhanger and Cobra Command.  I'm looking forward to vol. 2!",1210032000,,711,4.786885245901639
8222751,5,B000WCVIF2,"I am super stoked with my DVD...it's informative and fun, and watching it helped me re-live my experiences with some of the best old-school games of the 80s! I highly recommend it to anyone no matter where you fall on the gaming spectrum!!",1209513600,,239,4.5813953488372094
8222752,5,B000WCVIF2,"I bought this DVD several months ago after having it recommended to me on a gaming forum, and was a very worthy purchase.
The disc is of excellent quality audibly and visually, and has a great variety of interviews and topics on it which will be of interest to anyone who loves the classic arcade games of the '80s. The 'episodes' themselves are several minutes long each, which makes for an easy to watch and constantly interesting disc you can watch in bursts or in one go.
If you love classic games you probably already know you'll love this, buy and enjoy!",1207008000,,560,4.5
8222753,5,B000WCVIF2,"I don't buy many DVD's any more, but I happened across this in my search for King of Kong information.  Went ahead and purchased it and found it to be quite an extensive collection of interviews of the gaming industry in general and old school games in particular.  If you're a KoK fan, you'll find interviews with just about all the big names from the film. Can't recommend this disc more!

If you're thinking about buying it, just do it!  Hot babes and video games...what more could you ask?!",1206403200,,494,4.51685393258427
8222754,5,B000WCVIF2,This is a great collection of podcasts from Coin-Op TV with information and interviews ranging from new technologies and current gaming to retro gaming and pop culture. I was a gaming VJ for MTVu and found this to be a fun and entertaining way to get some great info. Good stuff.,1206316800,,279,4.490196078431373
8222755,5,B000WCVIF2,"Whether you're male or female, addicted to Pac-man or spend hours playing Halo, Coin-Op TV is fun for all gamers- young and old. Really informative and some great interviews!",1206230400,,174,5.0344827586206895
