8590053,4,B00D6I7FGK,"A fun collection of grooves to get under the fingers and advance your playing.  There are 50 here and I would say 10 to 15 can be enjoyed by new players ( less than 6 months).  About 20 expect you to have about six months to a year experience.  Not bad really.  I would say there are about 10 dud grooves but that could be my taste or that I already learned similar grooves elsewhere.  There are additional pdfs you can download off a website but you don't really need them since the video is pretty clear and the verbal description is well done.  I recommend this to improve fretboard skills, timing and learning new grooves.",1452124800,2,626,4.353448275862069
8590054,1,B00D6I7FGK,"This might be a great product, I'll never know. I opened it only to discover that in order to get the tabs and ""learning kit"" you have to sign up at truefire.com, pay them AGAIN, as well as be subject to their hyper-agressive email marketing. Been thru' that once with Truefire, never again. THIS IS A SCAM, so buyer beware!",1444521600,6,324,4.416666666666667

8590058,5,B00D6I7FGK,SWEET!  It was more advanced than I was ready for but the DLC helped tons. The oppurtunity to slow it down and get the grooves in my hands has already improved my playing in a month.,1412985600,2,182,4.055555555555555
8590059,5,B00D6I7FGK,"FYI - Be very careful about which DVD player you use because I initially thought I was getting 50, one-minute demos. But that was because of my DVD players not the DVD!

 Once I put this in a DVD player that was functioning properly I found the instruction to be to the point, engaging and worth the money. Santos is a great instructor. Very easy to understand and keep up with and to me the material is still challenging because I'm a beginner but I am certain that the material could be useful at any level.",1409097600,3,509,4.291666666666667
8590060,4,B00D6I7FGK,David plays great and shows you the grooves. His explanations are clear and easy to understand. Would have given highest rating if tabs were streamed along with each segment.,1377129600,3,174,5.0344827586206895
