I have been playing over 30 years and still sit in front of the TV with the DVD and my practice pad and go though the information over and over again.  I will never be able to play as well as any of the top drummers out there, but if I can get to a level that I enjoy playing at and can play live with out feeling that there are 20 drummers in the audience picking me apart and giving me the big thumbs down and knowing I am doing the best I can do.  I am OK with it.",1212278400,7,567,3.677685950413223
8006620,3,B00015G8JQ,"it won't teach you how to play like Dave Weckl.  Features several live performances of Dave with his bands, and if you didn't think Dave was The Man before, you will when you see this.  Camera work and production is top notch.  I find it very frustrating that Dave  really only gives a few lessons, and they are extremely basic.  He doesn't break apart what he's playing in the songs.  The DVD is probably worth having just for the performances, but as far as learning to play like Dave... his ideas go by VERY fast.",1131494400,18,516,4.378947368421053
