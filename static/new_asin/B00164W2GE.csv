8260859,1,B00164W2GE,"The front of this DVD shows 4 raw food dishes and the back shows 9 dishes.  I assumed all 13 dishes would be prepared, but only 3 are...and they're not the ones from the photos.

The 3 dishes Bryan Au did prepare looked tasty, however, he prepared them so fast, I won't be able to make them.  He also doesn't describe any techniques he's using, or name ingredients or give exact measurements.  Instead, he says if you want those details, buy the book.  There's no booklet with these details either.

There's no mention of benefits of the raw food diet or why he chose it for himself.  Instead, he just repeats that his dishes are eco-friendly and require no blender...however, 2 of his dishes do require blended ingredients.

I found him difficult to listen to as well.  He talks with a surfer dude accent and giggles practically after each sentence.  He would also start a sentence with, ""So..."" and then his voice would trail off without finishing his thought.  He came across as someone who didn't know what he was talking about.

After the recipe demonstrations, he gives a tour (if you want to call it that) of an eco-house.  However, the tour is just as rushed as the recipe demonstration...which is a shame because the house was beautiful.  He also doesn't provide any info on who the architect is, what inspired him/her to build it, or what eco materials were used.

Instead, a wobbly camera follows him as he makes one sentence statements like, ""Wow, this is really nice,"" and then moves onto the next room.  Or he'd hesitate and say, ""I think this is the (fill in the blank) room.""  You'd think if he wanted to include a home tour in this video, he would've done some research first.

When the tour ends, it ends abruptly.  No goodbye, no thank you for watching my DVD, not even, surprisingly, another plug to buy his book.  It just ends.  Overall, I didn't learn anything from this DVD and consider it a waste of money.",1232928000,4,1930,4.5523255813953485
8260860,1,B00164W2GE,"The video did not provide any useful information or tips on preparing raw food, selecting the ingredients, what to look for, or even mention any benefits or nutritional information of raw foods.  The product description was misleading as it claimed to have ""up to the minute information about nutrition, delicious recipes, snacks, desserts and more!""  All it did was show the author hurriedly going through three recipes (which were so hurried that they didn't even include all the usual ingredients). It just seemed like the dvd was made to use as a plug to buy the book.  He mentioned multiple times that you should buy the book to get the actual ingredients for the recipes.  In addition, they made a poor attempt at doing a tour of the eco house where the dvd was filmed.  While I'm sure it was well intentioned, it was out of place.  [...]. All in all, the recipes looked delicious, but I was very disappointed and would not recommend getting the dvd.",1229990400,16,956,4.6946107784431135

I have both the book and the video... haven't watched the video yet, but I can tell you that Byran's stuff is  fast, easy and  delicious!  so creative!!  Thanks, Bryan!",1215993600,3,315,4.5636363636363635
