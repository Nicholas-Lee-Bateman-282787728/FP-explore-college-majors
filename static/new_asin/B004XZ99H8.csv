He shares possible conspiracy theories about how Andy could have possibly faked his death as he had talked about the idea of faking his death. he was a performance artist and his audiences wanted him to continue to surprise them. Almost JFK/Elvis in its desire to somehow make it possible that Andy may possibly be alive, somewhere. He even talks to his brother.

8447704,2,B004XZ99H8,"You can't get a much better subject for a documentary than Andy Kaufman, entertainer par excellence' & fascinating enigma who so perplexed the world that even to this day his closest friends still aren't sure that he's actually dead.

Andy Kaufman is my favorite comedian of all time even though he was loathe to consider himself a comedian,(it was too limiting for his tastes I imagine)& he had the mark of TRUE genius namely that not only has his legacy survived the years since his exit from the public scene (Either through death or a death hoax) but his body of work continues to be imitated in various forms throughout pop culture. Many focus on Sacha Baron Cohen as ""Andy lite"" not to mention Joaquin Phoenix's recent foray into Kaufmanland but consider for a moment that some 20 years before the ""Masked Magician"" revealed the secrets of magic on FOX that Andy & best friend/comedy writer/fellow Tony Clifton Bob Zmuda were doing that exact same thing in a bit, masked magician spilling the secrets & all. This is but one example of the countless efforts from Kaufman & Zmuda that were so far ahead of their time that it's only recently that pop culture is finally catching up to them.

In ""The Death of Andy Kaufman"" writer/director Christopher Maloney offers an incredibly subdued look at & ode to the genius at the center of this documentary. It is, while respectful, I daresay BORING which is something that Andy only ever was to those NOT catching on to what he was doing. Here that isn't the case as it's clear that writer/director Maloney is engaged in hero worship & as such spends only a perfunctory amount of time on what was to most people looking up the documentary (Myself included) the major draw of it in the first place, namely the search for the answer to the question ""Did Andy Kaufman fake his death?"".{SPOILER ALERT} Maloney dismisses the individual who not only runs AndyKaufmanlives.com as a fake without explaining who he is if he ISN'T Andy Kaufman (The fact that Kaufman's family has never interfered or placed any legal injunctions against this individual or the website has always been of utmost interest to me) but actively claims to BE Andy Kaufman (I've talked with him myself online under several guises or ""characters"". He's VERY Andy like & if it isn't Andy himself then he's got Andy down in a way that Jim Carrey WISHES that he could have done in ""Man on the Moon"").) in what can only be considered a half hearted search for the truth which was probably the result of that individual refusing to be interviewed by him & the conviction with which Andy's brother Michael convinced Maloney in their interview that his brother was in fact deceased. Not to be unkind but if Andy did fake his death & wanted to remain in seclusion for whatever reason then wouldn't it be contingent upon anyone close enough to him to know that he faked it to convince others that he was dead? I'm not saying to strap a lie detector up to Michael Kaufman or anything but let's not be so credulous with someone who has donned the Tony Clifton garb himself (For years Andy claimed that he wasn't Tony & that Tony Clifton was a separate person. Now we know that sometimes it was Andy in the TC makeup, sometimes it Bob Zmuda, & every now & then it was Michael Kaufman.). A TRUE search for the truth about Andy Kaufman's ""death"" (Perhaps an ""In Search Of.."" style?) would make for a much better documentary than this lazily paced art house exhibit that would have been better titled ""The Life of Andy Kaufman"".(Though it wouldn't have been an accurate representation of that either.)This is a mixed bag at best.",1412985600,,3626,4.646417445482866

8447706,4,B004XZ99H8,"Andy Kaufman was many things. A comedian, actor, son, brother and friend. Andy could also drive you to insane anger or laughter... sometimes in the same moment. He was a strange, intensely private person. No one knew the real Andy. Maybe not even his family. So when he died in 1984 at the age of 35 from lung cancer, people thought he would be back. Not from the dead, but from hiding. Many people thought (and still think) that Andy Kaufman faked his own death, and that's what this documentary focuses on.

There are many reasons made known in this film about why Andy Kaufman would fake his own death. Some of them given are the fact that he had just gone through a lot of professional hardships. Losing his Saturday Night Live gig, having his show Taxi cancelled, and being thrown out of his spiritual meditation group. He told several people that he would fake his death to help cope with these losses. That he would hide away until the time was right to make his reappearance, thus staging the biggest hoax in the entertainment industry. He even created an alter ego (Tony Clifton) that he, or someone else (it was hard to tell who) would perform under the guise of.

This documentary delves quite deep into different theories of how Andy might have successfully pulled off this stunt of faking his own death. We get to go to a town where he has supposedly been seen over the years. We see letters from people having seen him in places all over the world. We are told about how Andy could have switched identities with someone in the hospital where he died, thus being free to do as he pleased while someone else was buried in his place. There are numerous websites that have members who either believe Andy is alive, or try to pass themselves off as Andy Kaufman himself.

In the latter part of the documentary, we spend time with Andy's brother, who brings a wealth of knowledge to the proceedings, and who also played the part of Tony Clifton on stage at least once. He admits to helping keep the image of Andy's death hoax alive, but doesn't go into detail how he does so. He also talks about Andy's last days alive, and his funeral.

This documentary sums up at its conclusion that Andy is in fact dead, (Which I believe as well) and that the hoax, even though it might have been in the planning stages, never came to fruition. Andy was a strange man and performer, so nothing he may have tried to do would seem shocking, as he did so many things outside the box to begin with.

Personally, while I found the subject of this documentary interesting, it was the great amount of Andy Kaufman footage that I had never seen before that grabbed my interest the most. I always felt that Andy died in 1984, and this did nothing to change my mind, or even consider any alternative. It is though, a well made and very interesting documentary about a comedian we do not have enough material on. This should be a welcome addition to the collection of someone who is curious about Andy's death, and people who find an interest in his comedy career. 7/10.",1372032000,4,3054,4.485611510791367
8447707,3,B004XZ99H8,I was expecting more interviews with his family but it doesn't really tell you anything that you don't already know. I really liked man on the moon Kaufman is played by Jim Carey couldn't have done any better with that one in my opion.,1340841600,2,235,4.363636363636363
8447708,5,B004XZ99H8,"The late comedian Andy Kaufman (1949-1984) is one of these legendary figures that certainly left a strong footprint in entertainment, not precisely because of his talents, but rather because of his premature death at 35. So, it can be said, that in that sense he belongs to the same privileged group of early celebrity departures, which includes Jim Morrison, Marilyn Monroe, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, John Belushi etc., etc.--- and maybe the recently deceased Amy Winehouse. These artists will haunt us for eternity and have created a cult following. ""The Death of Andy Kaufman"" takes a comprehensive and intriguing look at the myth created by his mysterious demise.

Directed by Christopher Maloney, who is fascinated by Kaufman, the documentary opens at Beth David cemetery, where the star is buried, and we get to see his grave. From there, we watch some of his early stand-up routines, and we are told that Kaufman was an early admirer of transcendental meditation. We are also told that once the comedian was informed that he had only about three months to live due to a lung cancer, nobody wanted to believe him. They thought it was a hoax, because he apparently told many people that he was going to fake his own death. Well, the man died, and, indeed, rumors began spreading that Kaufman faked his own dead. Some people were pushing the thesis that he was replaced by a Nathan McCoy, who died in the same hospital in which Andy was interned. Director Maloney interviews some people close to Kaufman, in order that he could find the truth. Perhaps the most credible interviewee was Andy's brother, who gave a candid testimony. In the end, you'll be the judge.

""The Death of Andy Kaufman"" also features some of the actor's most memorable gigs, including the famous Latka Gravas, from the TV series ""Taxi,"" and his recurrent roles on Saturday Night Live, such as the annoying Tony Clifton. Of course, his wrestling women phase is also mentioned. This documentary, plus the film ""Man on the Moon,"" in which Jim Carrey portrays the late comic, may go hand in hand to understand the mind of Andy Kaufman. The DVD also includes an extended interview with the director, and a trailer. (USA, 2011, color, 120 min plus additional materials). Exclusively reviewed on August 23, 2011 by Eric Gonzalez.
