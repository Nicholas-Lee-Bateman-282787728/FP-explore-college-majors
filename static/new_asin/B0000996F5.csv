7990157,5,B0000996F5,"I use to have this movie when it first came out. I fell in love with the adventure these two guys have. If your looking for hot chicks and bikinis then this is the movie for you. I am sad to say that while being in the Military during all of my moves i misplaced the Movie with regret. When ever i was down and out or had a hard day at work this was the movie to cheer me up. Who""s to say it wouldnt it is every young boys dream to take a buddy down to  FT.LD. and have nothing but fun in the sun not to mention being a sort of misfits they were and with a little help from a friend look like two pimps ready to rock and rock they did what a fun time and some hilarious dialogue to boot. So do yourself a favor and if you can find this gem i would recommend watching it with a close friend so you can both enjoy it at the same time.",1419465600,,832,3.7005649717514126

7990159,5,B0000996F5,"The above review is entirely correct.  I had this movie on VHS, recorded from Cinemax back in the mid-90's, and loved it!!  Lisa, the first girl the guys meet, is the sweet, tantalizingly sensuous girl, while Jessie, her best friend, is the bad-*** girl who loves night-club dancing!  I had Super Bowl XXXVIII on the same tape, & was sad that I gave it away.  Fantastic knowing I can have it again, 'cause no cable/satellite movie channel has shown it since the 90's, unless under ""Can It Be Love.""  I prefer the original title--but that's just me--""Spring Break Sorority Babes.""  If you are a fan of the early & mid 90's late night flicks--as I am--you will @ least like, if not love, this movie!!",1241740800,3,698,4.544
