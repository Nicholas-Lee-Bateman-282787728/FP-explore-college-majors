8187731,5,B000FR23FS,"Gotta get this! If you don't know about Reefer Madness it is a great Cult Classic - and this is the only version I know of with Hemp for Victory, which is a pretty odd flick on it's own. The government showing Farmers how to grow and harvest weed!  I got it coupled with Stoner Shorts Vol. 1, which is even better! The interface is as trippy as the rest of it. You can play all (straight thru) or play the ""scrambled mix"" - (just like your brain) I think this'll be great for my next party - even on in the background with the sound off, it's great the Betty Boop stuff coupled with the Vincent Collins short, really all of it is perfect - great price for what you get, especially with the extra free stuff, it's almost four times the Reefer Madness or Cocaine Fiends Length when added together. I would review each short, but there is so much to go over, their website does a decent job of explaining the parts if you're still wondering whether you should buy - plus there are some clips edited together there that you can download to your Ipod.",1148256000,,1046,4.256281407035176
8187732,5,B000FR23FS,"I got the twofer from Promodvds (""Reefer Madness with Hemp for Victory"" AND ""Stoner Shorts vol. 1"") and was floored! If you have any interest in social history, or just want to laugh until you puke, you have to get this. The main features are 2 anti - drug films and 2 ""social films"". These were actually made to be played for kids in school! The ""Social"" films seem to be made for the purpose of discussion in maybe a high school social studies class or something. Get some friends together to watch these because I guarantee you'll wanna discuss this stuff MST3000 style! Oh, and the Betty Boop cartoons - I had NO idea she was so naughty, or controversial. I had looked this DVD up at stonershortsdvd [dot] com - there's more info than their amazon store, and there is a reel in quicktime of clips from the DVD- -I had to get this after seeing the reel and am so glad I did.",1148256000,,877,4.289156626506024
