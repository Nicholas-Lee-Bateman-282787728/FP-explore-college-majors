8558075,4,B00AVLNKN2,"I love the movie. It's my favorite, but honestly the 3D doesn't add that much. Still if you are a fan of the film, it's interesting to see it this way.",1496016000,,151,3.903225806451613
8558076,2,B00AVLNKN2,I'm dissapointed. The product details are false. The details show that it has Spanish and English subtitles but only has Deutsch subtitles. That is misleading information.,1485388800,,171,5.615384615384615
8558077,5,B00AVLNKN2,"I give this 5 stars because I love this movie. The transfer is basically a scan of each frame. The dark scenes have a lot of flicker of dust, but the 3D version is awesome. I love this movie. Great for a fan. But again, if you want an updated version and one that is more cleaned up, I would say get the new Enchanted Edition.",1437696000,,326,3.9545454545454546
8558078,5,B00AVLNKN2,"I rarely will review products I buy on Amazon, but this one I felt I must.

First, let me say that it took over a month to get here, but I believe this was due to customs.  That being said, it was well worth the wait.

With this 3D Blu-Ray, it was like watching The Last Unicorn for the first time, only many times better.  I have only watched the German release in the 3D version so far, so I can't comment on the non-3D version on the same disc, but have watched the previous non-3D versions many times.  It is beautiful.  It fills an entire 1080 HD screen and doesn't appear to have been stretched.  Either it was filmed very well to begin with, or they did a very nice job converting it to high definition (or both).

The 3D doesn't come popping out of the screen, but it is 3D and gives it a lot more depth which takes you into the world (more than the non-3D version in my opinion).  The audio was perfect as well.  I have a region-free Panasonic 3D Blu-Ray player and had no issues with playback.  The only thing I even had to adjust was the soundtrack to set it to English.

It's almost too bad this exact version wasn't released in the States because I feel it would do well and probably not too many know it exists.  Also, there has been no editing/censoring done (""damn you"" being one of them), which definitely it is a plus.  I first watched this when I was younger than 5 and I see no reason why parents wouldn't let their kids, but then to each his/her own.

So, if you love this show, I highly recommend purchasing.  It is worth every cent.",1431734400,,1555,4.185185185185185
8558079,5,B00AVLNKN2,"The quality of this print and the 5.1 track (yes, there is an English track, and yes it is 5.1) are absolutely spellbinding.  I can't speak for the 3D version as when I try to load it, my Pioneer Elite BDP-62FD locks hard when it attempts to play.  Hopefully it's just a firmware issue and can be repaired.  Nevertheless, of the many copies of The Last Unicorn I've owned over the years, this is by far the most accurate reproduction.",1367798400,2,434,4.4
8558080,5,B00AVLNKN2,"First off, this movie is a gorgeous animated classic with a haunting and memorable soundtrack.
The 2D High Def version makes this film look better than I have ever seen it.  The 3D version gives it a look like the old Viewmaster slides.  Crisp picture with fantastic colors and 3D that looks like paper cut outs in a diorama.  It fits the look of the film very well.",1364256000,,366,4.352941176470588
