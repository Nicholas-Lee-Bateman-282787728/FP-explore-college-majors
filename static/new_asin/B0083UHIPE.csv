5126790,5,B0083UHIPE,"This was everything I have come to expect from SOA and more!! Every time I think Sutter can't possibly top what's already happened, he does! What a remarkable season opener!! Unbelievable twists and turns, awesome acting, shocking surprises...everything I have come to expect from the best show on TV right now....possibly ever!!!!",1347408000,,331,5.384615384615385
5126791,5,B0083UHIPE,OMG!! This was an awesome start to Season 5!!!! A superb job by Kurt Sutter as always and I can't wait to see what the remainder of the season has in store. All the actors made their characters come to life in this episode and Tig explodes on the screen.,1347408000,8,254,4.1
5126792,5,B0083UHIPE,"Season 5 has started out with a bang, and I loved the writing and how everyone is really bringing these characters to life. I know most people who have never watched the show think its all about an Outlaw club, but honestly that's just one piece of it. The show is about people, and how they interact and react to the situations they are put into. Last nights episode was another great one with amazing performances, Kim Coates (Tig) in particular has a great scene in this episode. I would highly recommend buying the episodes on amazon, and then when the dvd comes out next year, buy that too for all of the extras. If you have never watched an episode of Sons, find a friend who has seasons 1-4 and watch them. Also I would recommend watching Kurt Sutter's youtube videos for behind the scenes stuff. It is a great way for fans to connect with the cast and creator. This is the only show that I know of that actually keeps in touch with the fans inbetween seasons.

Anyway I will not put any spoilers in this review, and will just recommend you watch this show because it is really a great show. But this show is not for children, so if you have little ones, don't let them watch the show with you. There is a reason why the show comes on as late as it does. Thank you for reading my review and I hope this helped you a little in deciding whether to buy these episodes or not.",1347408000,141,1379,4.243346007604563
5126793,5,B0083UHIPE,"Hands down this season started with the BEST and most insane season premiere not just out of Sons of Anarchy, but any show as far as I'm concerned. Sutter is known for pushing the limit of the violently and sexually graphic scenes, and this episode outdoes itself. I had to watch the episode twice because I was in so much shock the first time around that I had to watch it again.

Out of all the season premieres, including the rather graphic rape scene in Season 2, the premiere episode takes it to another level. Any fan of the show will be enthralled and shocked and excited as Sutter throws unexpected twists and turns into the already heavy and complicated plot.

I recommend not eating as you watch this too, it might get too uncomfortable.",1347408000,3,747,4.525925925925926
5126794,5,B0083UHIPE,"the twists and turns in this first episode are terrific. Sutter shows you the pot of water and turns on the heat, making the water boil and boil until it explodes. This season looks like a ticking time bomb just waiting to detonate. Cant wait for Episode 2!",1347408000,12,257,4.375

It's the kind of thing that happens everyday where I live, and all the bike clubs around here are just like this.  I love the way these guys can just shoot anybody they want, or beat up everybody they want to and the cops can't do anything.

  Everybody knows that biker clubs are just totally dedicated to the welfare of the towns where they live in their nice middle class houses.  So real and accurate that you'll just love it.  I know I do.",1501632000,,600,4.303571428571429

The show is amazingly written, the characters are complex and humorous, the story lines are multi-dimensional filled with twists, turns, deals, betrayals, loyalty, hate, love and family.  Each episode is jam packed with a lot of content which makes you have to watch without distractions. I highly recommend this entire series.

5127142,4,B0083UHIPE,Season 5 wasn't as good as season 4 but stars like Jimmy Smits bought some heft to the series.  Outside of that the plot lines of more murder and mayhem was expected.  I watch this series just because i have already watched the series that I was interested in.  This is a filler program and nothing more.,1478649600,,304,4.298245614035087

5127198,3,B0083UHIPE,"Watched the whole series back to back. It's like a train wreck. Awful but you can't look away! The violence is unparalleled to Anything I've ever seen, but in a way it's almost funny. No one can kill that many people and not get caught. Everyone is crooked, and it's always everyone else's fault. But I stuck it out to the bitter end, and actually felt bad for the bad guys. Probably won't rewatch it, but glad it did. It is, to coin a phrase, ""A piece of work!""",1478044800,,462,4.202247191011236

5127390,4,B0083UHIPE,"Not realistic about what really goes on in the hood, but it's very entertaining and worth the time.  Supposedly based on HAMLET, the fact that Tara (Ophelia) has to die ruins any of the romance that exists in the series.  The other romances weren't as potent.  Gemma is made too indomitable.  It's like watching Livia in ICLAUDIUS.  The gang warfare is dramatic, and the characters interesting if you don't need too much depth.  Strategies and plots of the club are interesting.",1473465600,,478,4.839506172839506

Half of the members have s**** going on behind the others backs. And there's no way a punk kid like Jax Teller would have been the VP just because his stepfather was the Prez so it goes without saying that he wouldn't be the Prez either. Chibs and Bobby are the two that would in reality be at the head of the club. There are far too many other things wrong with the show that are just Hollywood Political statements, such as the Transvestite s***. Sorry, but that s**** would never fly around REAL BIKERS. Wanted to give only 2 and a half stars. LOVE the BIKES but those are unrealistic also. Not all bikers ride brand new bikes.",1472774400,,784,4.340136054421769

5127570,4,B0083UHIPE,"This series is about a vulgar, extremely violent, criminal biker gang called SAMCRO.  They had been running guns from the IRA to the Russians in northern California, but recently are talking about a new source from Gaza for heavy military type weapons which are to go to a Mexican Cartel south of the border.  A new twist in Season 5 is a clandestine government organization that is well aware of the criminal activity of SAMCRO and are using SAMCRO to move heavy weapons to a certain Mexican Cartel. In exchange for the weapons, SAMCRO ""mules"" cocaine to a criminal boss in Oakland and gets paid. The members of SAMCRO keep talking about getting out of the gunrunning business, but now they are into drug running, which is contrary to their charter.  They keep saying it is temporary, but every move they make seem to lead further down a ruthless criminal path.  They have even started justifying the killing of innocent civilian by calling it ""collateral damage"".  I think we all know how this story has to end - death or life in prison.

Law enforcement is ineffective because most of them are either corrupt or wind up owing the gang for one thing or another.

If you have nothing else going in your life and love vulgar language and violence, you'll love this series.  It is addictive, so you will not want to stop once you start watching.",1469318400,,1344,4.617647058823529

5127651,5,B0083UHIPE,"This season is black as tar. I ended it feeling nothing but resentment for almost all of the characters. The only person I could even begin to sympathize with is Wendy. It's easy to resent her, too, for her role in affecting Abel's health; but if we recall, she had been abandoned by her husband/baby's daddy so he might as well have put the needle in her arm for her - and he actually did, in the end. And when we consider the danger that Jax, Gemma, and the rest of the club are constantly putting Abel in, is Wendy's transgression really the worst?

The themes this season explores and the questions it begs are profound.

For one, the way the relationship evolves and matures between Jax and Tara is one I've personally experienced. When you're in love, it's easy to accept things you normally wouldn't. You will endure trauma that you could have never thought possible. You start making changes in yourself to be the person you think your partner needs, when if you had known before the relationship that you'd WANT to become this person, you wouldn't believe it.

The things you think you can handle when you're in love and the things you come to regret further along in a relationship are sometimes one and the same. We begin to see the limits of Jax's promises and ability to protect, and we also begin to see how Tara is beginning to awaken to the brevity of the reality she's occupying. The spell is breaking. We begin to wonder how much of what Jax and Gemma do is actually for the good of the family, and how much of it is for their egotistical needs to control everything around them. We see how much they have to dehumanize others in order to justify their choices. Jax appears to transform from a troubled hero to a bloodthirsty fascist - but in fact, he's always been that way. We just never saw it because he had been presented as someone who was making hard but necessary choices. He has always been murderous, violent and domineering.

The characters in this show are dysfunctional and despicable with a twisted sense of justice, which is complicated by the fact that everyone lies and manipulates to ensure their own version of Good prevails. Anyone who violates their not-so-obvious code of ethics is liable to be murdered, or worse.

I love this show for the moral dilemmas it puts its characters and audience in, and the lines we're forced to consider and redraw to accept the behavior of our favorite characters. What would we do in these situations? If this were our lives? Maybe we want to forgive the characters for what they do, but should we?",1466899200,,2571,4.5562770562770565

5127852,5,B0083UHIPE,"Only spoiler I'll warn of: Pack your hankie when you watch Episode 3. If it makes Chib's cry, then you know it's heartbreaking.

The opening of the season was great. Them on the road hauling and the way it was setup, I may have looped it a few time to watch it.

Some of the storylines got muddled but they got unscrambled in the end. Some of the best scenes come in Orca Shrugged with the whale and Venus. I had to pause it at one point. You see Jax quickly employ Clay's tactics but not his emotional detachment.

Overall, the final arc that plays out over the final two episodes is great. Certain characters get what they deserve while another is merely caught in the crossfire. Much like the last season, Clay gets what his ass deserves. Chibs, Bobby, all the SAMCRO boys get some story time. We see a few come and go, playing into the story REALLY importantly.

They bring the Grim Bastards in at a time or two. I really love their interaction. Same with the Mayans. (Alvarez is my kind of character. Smart, practical but ruthless when it's time to be.) The One Niners story line is getting tedious but it gets better.

Keep an eye on Juice. His story I think is going reach an interesting arc soon.(Edit: They take him down a road there's no coming back from)

Nero is a new Character but breathes in great new life. I still see President Santos from The West Wing and when he schools his old gang, he sealed my vote.

Let's talk about Opie.
I honestly struggled to like him. It took until the end of Season 3 for me to actually like him. He became a hero for his actions at the end of Season 4. Episode 3 of this season... the only character death that has upset me as much has been Half Sack. He proves he's a hero.

Enjoy the Season. From here out, it starts to get messy.",1458000000,,1781,4.2485207100591715
5127853,4,B0083UHIPE,it was a good series and season.  Full of action for the most part.  However some scenes seemed to be deleted in certain sequences and it was obvious.  I don't know if it was an Amazon thing or they were cut by the Sons of Anarchy creators for placement in the bluray director's cut edition.,1458000000,,291,4.254545454545455

I figured I'd watch the first few episodes since they were on Amazon prime. I absolutely loved it. The storylines were great despite the violence and kept me binge watching for 2weeks after work and on weekends. I got invested in the characters and couldn't wait for SAMCRO to get revenge over the ""bad guys"" and when I got to the final episode I got teary at the ending scene. If you like to see movies that have a deep statement, then this is for you. The fight between good and bad tormenting Jax was awesomely portrayed by the actor. I give this series 5 stars for its entertainment value, it's portrayal of a good man doing bad things, and it being filmed very well and believability.",1456531200,,804,4.366666666666666

I was somewhat disturbed because I kept catching myself rooting for the thugs and seeing them as regular people with problems like everyone else.  Of course we normal people don't just shoot or stab everyone we have a disagreement with. However, the law enforcement people is this program were mostly a little shady.  It appears that general knowledge of biker gangs, the author's story seemed authentic and made the show really interesting.  The acting was sensational and most of the actors were not known by me prior to watching the show.  As I said in another review earlier in the season, the show would be more accurately titled if it had been named, ""SONS OF DUPLICITY.""",1454457600,,825,4.857142857142857

5128040,5,B0083UHIPE,"I had purposely not watched Thai series before now as I figured it was another one of ""those"" movies. I am thrilled to say it was AWESOME. I became totally hooked/ obsessed at about the 3rd episode in season one.
Somehow I immediately felt connected to so many people in the show. I was amazed by some of the actors actresses (especially Katey Sagal!) everyone did a fabraric job! Great story...pretty realistic (minus a few smaller details.)
Hard to say which one of the men of SAMCROW that I was dreaming about.
I loved it. I am actually starting to watch the entire series again... To catch things I may have missed.
I will also say it is amazing how much the characters ""grew"" into the roles. This growth is something you might have missed if you watched one episode a week.
Most of all it was awesome due to being on Amazon Prime. It was great to watch it show after show!
( Yikes! Where did that week and a half go!?)

I am not even a ""TV"" kind of person and it usually takes A LOT, for me to enjoy any movie or show. SoA won my heart!
Really hoping the rumors of season 8 are true.

Hope you enjoy it too!",1449187200,,1112,4.191588785046729

But this is addictive, fun, engrossing entertainment.  In Season Five Jax Teller is in full control of SAMCRO as he seeks to change its direction and move it towards at least quasi-legitimacy, i.e. out of gunrunning.  Easier said than done, and it makes for some very interesting episode storylines.  Several of the characters unfold in complexity such as Juice, Bobby, and others.  Overall this is first-rate entertainment.",1441843200,,600,5.197916666666667

This entire series is about life spiralling out of control and getting caught up in stuff till you become the thing you hated most and it is also about finding redemption. I lived this series.

5128450,5,B0083UHIPE,"One of better-written, well-acted and well-produced tv series. Extremely well-crafted.  Not as good as Breaking Bad and nothing close to the quality of The Wire, but a decent distant third runner-up in the cops vs. drug/gun-runners genre.  Inventive and at times brilliant plotting, highly entertaining and informative about the portrayed criminal underworld comprised of m.c. (Sons), hispanic m.c. (Mayans), Chinese gang, black street-dealing gang (Niners), sophisticated black Mafia, the imprisoned elements of all the preceding, IRA gun source, rabid-unscrupulous ATF officer,and all the interpersonal relationships between the Sons, their families, and outsiders.  It's the interpersonal story between Jacks and Tara that hooks the viewer throughout this season--as well as the revelation of the m.c.'s roots in Belfast and ties to the IRA. The 3-season-long slow deterioration and ultimat demise of one gang member's wife plays out like an inexorable Greek tragedy.  Smart and fascinating portrayal of small-town politics, uneasy alliance between local cops and the m.c.gang,  and the struggle by high school sweethearts to survive inside Murder, Inc.  Action-filled entertainment via a cluster-bomb of gangland amorality tales.",1434412800,2,1233,5.937853107344632

5128472,3,B0083UHIPE,"I have enjoyed the SOA as a binge watcher, since I did not catch it during the original run.  I just finished season five and am not sure I will finish the last two seasons.  The acting remains strong but I have felt that the story line has been going stale -- some one inside betrays the MC, an external threat from other outlaws appears, law enforcement antagonists or activities arrive on the scene and get dealt with; Clay lies to Jax and Gemma,  Gemma lies to Jax, Tara waivers in her decision to leave, etc etc.  And now that I already have some awareness of the upcoming events in the next two seasons, my interest has waned.  At the end, most good TV series seem to overstay their original appeal.",1433894400,,705,4.351145038167939

5128483,1,B0083UHIPE,"I watched the first 5 seasons of SOA and really enjoyed them, sadly the 6th season was a disappointment.  The shows got longer and longer with a lot of dialogue that did not move the show along.  Although there were plenty of deaths in this season the one character that I was hoping would die, Gemma, is alive and well at the end of the season, could be because Katy Sagal's husband is the shows writer and ep, her acting is awful and her character has no redeemable qualities.

Parents beware,this is not a show for kidseven  14 and older for it glorifies extreme cruelty and extreme violence.

Great writing, great acting, and a storyline that grabs you and pull you along with all the action.  The Sopranos have nothing on these guys when it comes to whacking people.  I can't even count how many bit the dust during the 6 seasons so far.  The Irish actors and their heavy accents are nearly impossible to understand at times (at least for me), but the HD content is excellent and worth your time to binge watch.  The season 6 ending was intense and I can't wait to see the final season.  Amazon, when are you going to give us season 7?",1425945600,,631,4.2521008403361344

Is there nothing they can't do?  Well they can't keep secrets.  And they have trouble hitting their targets in their daily shoot ups.  So if you want a (unintentional) giggle watch SOA.

5129271,5,B0083UHIPE,"The entire series is extremely well written and offers a great balance of drama, action, and insight into the fictitious club's motivations. The fifth season takes the viewer deeper into the club's business and personal lives of each character. It transitions seamlessly from the fourth season to continue the saga. I give the fifth season five stars and highly recommend the entire series.",1413849600,,390,5.2063492063492065

8524777,5,B0083UHIPE,"Great writing from the first season on, great acting and direction.  Up to this season the Commentaries have not given away future plot points and surprises.  However, with this season, the last Commentary on the second to last episode does give away some of the last episode, so should only be listened to after first completing the season, to let the drama flow. Luckily, I did that and did not have the last episode spoiled. For those watching a show for the first time on DVD, like me, it is extremely annoying for Commentaries to spoil the rest of the season a la The Shield and a few others I can think of.  I am not a big fan of biker movies (because they usually feature bullies and thugs picking on ordinary people), so I was surprised at how much I liked this show, really more of a crime family show than a typical biker show.  I am not sure why Kurt Sutter did not give himself an acting credit, but he is excellent as Otto Delaney, throughout.  Looking forward to finishing up Season Six and Seven.",1527206400,,1011,4.385026737967914
