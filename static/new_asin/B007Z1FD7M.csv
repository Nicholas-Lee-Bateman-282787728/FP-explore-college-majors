8523226,3,B007Z1FD7M,I decided to watch this today. Even though I had since 2012. I wish I just left it where it was. One the small stage situation seems awkward Fripp doesn't that chair swivel ?  I think this is the first show with this formation of Crimson. The playing is a bit of a mess. And the camera work is just awful. Live in Japan 1995 is the other document of this band and the definitive DVD filmed archive of this era.  I recommend that.,1464393600,,429,4.095238095238095

8523230,5,B007Z1FD7M,"Always is good find some rare or hidden footage of your favorite bands and better when the line-up is your favorite. On that way this material is spectacular. The double trio in Argentina. I think why I didn't was there. I find this double DVD as an important document for the fans of Robert Fripp and his gang. Sadly video quality is really poor, but in case of KC, audio is what really matters!.",1380067200,3,397,4.378378378378378
8523231,2,B007Z1FD7M,"Image quality: Main reason for low rating is that about half of the footage is out of focus.  I can tell that most of the cameras were unattended and set to ""auto-focus"", but like any dimly lit environment, the cameras didn't have anything to focus on and you just see foggy silouhettes half of the time.  I don't normally care about quality of footage, but this one was particularly bad. I'll chalk it up to cheap cameras from a long long time ago, compounded by having some or most of them unmanned.

Sound quality: Acceptable

Artistic value: Very good, I enjoy seeing any show from this period, THRAK is an album I really admire and enjoy.  Very similar to Discipline in overall appeal to me.",1363910400,6,696,4.536
8523232,4,B007Z1FD7M,"While this concert was very good, it did not include their hit, In the Court of King Crimson, which I suspect may be due to the fact that there are different members in this band.  However, the dvd is still worthwhile.",1352764800,,218,4.317073170731708
8523233,4,B007Z1FD7M,"After seven years of inactivity, Robert Fripp had the sudden idea of putting King Crimson back in action in a form of a double trio. This idea materialized by the recording of the mini-album ""Vroom"" in 1994. After some rehearsals, the newly incarnation of King Crimson arrived in Argentina for a series of concerts that are available here for the first time on DVD. They took the video from the archives and added the sound from the digital multitracks. They had to do some editing on the video and a lot more work with the audio.

There is two shows from the same day. It is shot by TV and don't have the same quality as a professional DVD. In fact, it's pretty evident in the out of focus shots that we have from a camera. They have tried to resolve this issue by incorporating some clear shots in those unclear shots. For the audio, we have a 4 channel DTS sound that i would have appreciated more if my home system didn't have distortion noise on one back speaker. I had the same problem with a Pain of Salvation's DVD that has a 4 channel surround.

The performance and the set list are excellent on both shows, with some old classics like ""Red"" and ""Larks' Tongues in Aspic"", that are still enjoyable to listen after many years. This is a band that have made some very original and challenging music over the years, that made them a band ahead of his time. That's why their music is interesting no matter what period we are looking at.

This is not the best way to be introduced to the band, previous DVD are more appropriate, but for The King Crimson fan, this is a nice addition to his collection.",1343952000,8,1605,4.379194630872483
8523234,4,B007Z1FD7M,"Mine just came in the mail from the UK this morning. Where it is great to have two full shows from this line up there is much to forgive in this release. First yes this is a DVD-A but you have to watch it in DTS to get the Video. Both DVD-A and DTS are 48/24 so there is not a huge difference anyway. The shows themselves are good but taken right from the start of the tour. The DVD from this tour might have the band playing a little tighter but there is a certain rawness to this that I find refreshing. It's not that the band is not tight because they are (they're King Crimson for God Sakes) but maybe it was the way it was recorded I don't know. I have a live double CD that came out from these shows and a few others of this run. But that CD says it was taken from a DAT so I am not sure how these shows fit into that senario.
 The DVD-A is basically band in front audience noise in back. A little of the band audio mixed into the back speakers to give you that live feel. I am not saying this is a bad product. Just don't expect those Beautiful mixes you are use to from the studio DVD-A's that Steve Wilson mixed. If you loved this period of Crimson I am sure you will be glad you picked them up. But you will also understand why it was released under the collectors club banner.",1340064000,21,1287,3.95
