The costumes and acting in this movie is so hokey and the (so called) story is so bad that I wish that there were some way I could get my money back.
  Advice to author of this movie! Get a grip and learn from those before you. Or at least watch some movies from that era. Better yet, make some trailers so people can see how stupid this movie is.",1416182400,,496,4.051020408163265
