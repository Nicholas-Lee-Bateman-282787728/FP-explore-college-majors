2739441,5,B000MR9D5E,"This series is amazing. I have the region 2 dvd and watching it was like one of the best 11 hours of my life. The picture, the sound and most importantly the animals, places, and everything else it shows is fantastic. If you are a fan of wildlife documentaries you must own the dvd set, or if you prefer the blu ray or the hd dvd version; only that those two don't have special features, but still the series is great. And of course the final touch that also makes this series as great as it is, a narration by David Attenborough. You really need to watch this!!!",1173225600,12,563,4.222222222222222
2739442,5,B000MR9D5E,"I've only seen 6 of the 11 episodes of this series but so far it is amazing. I normally think that nature documentaries are boring but this one is awe-inspiring, mesmerizing, and brilliant. Everything looks to real and comes right out of the screen. The regular DVD is around $60 and for an extra $10 you can get it in Blu-Ray.
Highly Recommended for anyone who owns a Blu-Ray DVD player.",1172707200,8,388,4.47887323943662
2739443,5,B000MR9D5E,"Having seen this series on the BBC HD Channel Here in the UK I would recommend this series to anyone that has a Interest in Documentarys and has a HD DVD player, and can safely say you haven't seen anything like this before, the amount of detail the HD Cameras add to this is out of this world and the high production values make this a must have for anyone with a slight interest in the world that surronds us. Buy this and I guarentee you won't be disappointed! Its the ideal thing to show off your new HD TV and HD DVD player!

For people in the U.K as HD is region free this will play on your HD DVD player too even though this says region 1, beaware though you can only import goods upto 18 so you might have to pay duty and a Royal Mail admin charge!",1172188800,101,756,4.006622516556291
2739444,5,B000MR9D5E,"It is just amazing how BBC manages to produce wildlife documentaries of this calibre time and again.

First of all, you will be amazed to know that there is so much of untouched wilderness still out there. But you will also be saddened to know that there is actually nothing that is truly untouched!

The program is divided geographically and shows you some pretty spectacular shots. The aerial shots, in particular, are absolutely amazing. The limit to which the camera men have gone needs to be seen to be believed.

The image of the snow leopard hunting in thick snow is something that makes me feel privileged! And if you thought you have seen all there is to see about lions, wait till you see this one!

The photography is unbelievable, the sound is awesome, a must watch with the entire family. Certainly a collectors edition.",1171843200,26,833,4.684931506849315

2739446,5,B000MR9D5E,"This is a great documenttary. I just got it on region 2 DVD's. I'm a huge fan of David Attenborough and his series of DVD's, but this one is different in the sense that he is not on set, just pure narration. His voice sounds older, and possibly this is the reason he chose not to be on location while this series was being filmed. This dies detract from it IMHO.

The 5 DVD's are outstanding though, and the DVD's itself are extremely high quality, worth a watch just for this. It goes into detail about every climate on earth. David's narration is splendid but lacking some of the wit in past series, perhaps because he is not location? I gave it 5 stars because it is great, just not off the scale great, as some of his past DVD's are. Enjoy it! I did.",1170806400,25,754,4.2

My disappointment is at a higher level.  Very often I felt that I was missing the forest and only seeing the trees.  At a minimum, there should be a big picture map(s) showing the location(s) of interest, especially when the migratory paths span thousands of miles.  Without a big picture perspective, the images are only interesting minutia.",1522627200,,500,4.904761904761905

2739505,5,B000MR9D5E,"Many programs use HD as a gimmick to try to improve mediocre films. The first films produced in HD were also more of the IMAX (all pictures and no substance.)

This series is a great exception. This is a well made documentary of Planet Earth and the HD (high speed to over 1000 frames a second) part adds the more than real feel to everything from birds to mountains. Once in a while they show people so you can put this large scope in scale. They minimize the animals eating animals and in many cases by leaving out the background music give you a mystic feel for the planet.

This series is worth the purchase as every time you watch you can catch something new. At this time there is a war of formats so I am holding off purchasing. However I have seen this severs several times on 46"" 1080p. So far my favorite part is the silent vision of the Peruvian mountains.",1507852800,11,867,4.280487804878049

Why is this show so amazing? Well first of all, its informative and the cinematography is awe inspiring. The soft and direct voice of ol' Dave will keep you enthralled until the credits. Also the show is separated into the different biomes (kinda) and that's always convenient.

Basically what I'm trying to say: If you have a Blu-Ray player, you are doing yourself a disservice if you don't have this piece of art in your library.",1505088000,4,656,4.754385964912281

The parts of nature BBC captured in this collection is unmatched and brings.  It brings the farthest corners of the planet to the comfort of your living room (or wherever it is you might be watching).

2739729,4,B000MR9D5E,"Pretty darn good, but as much is to be expected from Sir David Attenborough and the production team (of the BBC, I am quite certain) who attended to the technical aspects in such an undertaking. This feature is chock full of interesting information, rich visuals and sounds which include so many animals inaccessible to the average person -- especially in said animal's natural habitat, as well as breathtaking aerial shots and time-lapse clips of the sun's movement over gorgeous geographic locale or other.

If I had one criticism, it would be the episode's seeming tendency to jump around in a manner that seems at times just a bit disjointed. However, this is by no means a deal-breaker. After all, Sir David has set one heck of a high standard in his career, so one must bear in mind that the viewing public has likely been spoilt by the excellence of his corpus of work.",1472601600,5,876,4.688311688311688

2739752,5,B000MR9D5E,"I absolutely love this collection. The cinematography and narration are outstanding! I cannot imagine how much time, energy, efforts, and resources were put into production. I bought two sets, one for myself to keep, and one as a birthday present for my little nephew. The series is educational and reaches to a wide range of audience. There are some scenes that capture the cruel (honest but not gruesome) side of the animal kingdom, such as hunting and struggling polar bears, so some parents might not want to show to very young children. However, at the same time, those could also be the moments for parents to teach/explain animal behaviors and the impacts of global warming. I look forward to watching this with our son when he's old enough to understand.",1470355200,,762,4.869230769230769

2739780,3,B000MR9D5E,"This documentary was ground breaking at the time I bought it, especially in blu ray.  But now nat geo, I believe is catching up and surpassing this series.  They use more computer graphics to illustrate scientific findings.  I would still buy this as a collector's item, but it gets rather long and drawn out as a random overview of the species in certain habitats.  I find the other animal documentary producers will spend 1 hour on a specific species in  HD, and I learn a lot more by focusing on 1 animal than just an overview.

When this series first aired on television several years ago, I knew I would have to own it. Paying more for the Bluray version is absolutely worth it. Each episode is exquisitely shot, bringing detail to the small elements of the world that are so easy to overlook. More than a nature documentary, it is really a time capsule of the world at its prime. The earth is changing, and future generations may not get to experience the natural world as we know it today, and this series really showcases the true beauty of planet earth.

2739885,5,B000MR9D5E,"I really love the ""earth"" in this documentary, from the high mountain, to forest, to the deep ocean, even in the dark cave, there are special creatures dwelling in. And in each kind of environment, creatures gets best capability to survive, both for preys and predators. This evolution may takes thousands of generations. For example, in darkest cave, some predators ""evolve"" to lose eyes, but they have extremely well-developed sensors on skin to detect preys. Indeed, probably sightless is a luxurious sensor in this environment. And one see that the life on the earth starts from a cell dating back to million of years, but now it has such diversity of creatures on this blue planet. I can only say ""amazing"" to express my feeling to it. And I also love the scene when the documentary is at the end, it views above the earth and witness the sun slowly drops down from the horizon, and the glow turns down: Our planet is to dorm. Such a lovely planet, it's our home.",1462320000,,968,4.633720930232558

2740048,5,B000MR9D5E,I love the Planet Earth Series.  You can see the time put in to making this.,1451692800,,76,3.75
2740059,5,B000MR9D5E,Planet Earth is an incredible BBC documentary which covers nearly every place and major ecosystem on Earth. I watch time and again. With great film footage and narration this program really captures the beauty and marvels of the planet we live on. Highly recommended.,1451692800,,267,5.090909090909091
2740060,5,B000MR9D5E,"I love all things narrated by David Attenborough, he's just a great narrator.  Period.

Narrator aside, planet earth is just simply a documentary that I cannot take my eyes off of.  The cinematography is (in my opinion) completely unrivaled by any other nature series / shows I've seen.  It puts to shame most of the work by Nat Geo, and animal planet, discovery channel, etc.  It's just a visually breathtaking show to watch.  Make sure and get this in 1080P and watch it on a very good TV.  They did a fantastic job at really making the cinematography as perfect as it can be - do yourself a favor and watch it as it should be (in full 1080p, and in its full visual glory)!

I cannot say that I've been interested at all in watching any nature documentaries more than one time.  This is the only one that I find to be so involving to watch, that I can watch it many times, and still feel a sense of awe at what the planet and mother nature does.  While the structure some may not like (it's fairly whimsical), I like it.  It switches from complex to simple, and turns things around, it keeps my attention.

As for the educational value, you get a bit of all kinds of ecosystems, from the deep seas, great plains, to the jungles, caves, etc.  It's not a super deep look at everything, but the material is all quite interesting.  They are separated by episode, see the list below:

- From Pole to Pole ( a bit of everything )
- Mountains
- Freshwater
- Caves
- Deserts
- Ice Worlds
- Great Plains
- Jungles
- Shallow Seas
- Seasonal Forests
- Ocean Deep

This is in my opinion - the best nature series there is.  It's a treat to watch.  Do yourself a favor and watch it without any distractions.",1451347200,29,1695,4.276729559748428

We love the narration by David Attenborough because his voice is soothing and very articulate and allows you to enjoy the episodes without taking anything away from the experience. This series is packed full of episodes ranging from Mountains to Deserts to Shallow Seas to Ocean Deep, with so much more! It's easy enough to watch one episode at a time and come back to the DVD without missing anything or feeling like you have forgotten what happened in the last episode because they are all separate subjects. I think this series is great for all ages and even our 2 1/2 year old twins enjoy watching this! We have learned so much from these and it's an excellent value.

2740429,5,B000MR9D5E,"This is a visually spectacular and startling series that sets the standard for all nature documentaries. Filmed at enormous cost, over several years, with high definition cameras (making it ideal for blu-ray), Plant Earth allows you to see and appreciate our planet as no one has ever done before. Some of these scenes are breathtaking and amazing. And, unfortunately, some are disturbing. There is a lot of attacking and killing of animals here (including baby animals), so this may not be for the very young or squeamish. I found these parts traumatizing. It made me wonder if this is all nature is: fang, claw, and teeth killing to survive as long as possible until it's your turn to fall. If you can get past these parts, this is an amazing experience.",1433289600,13,756,4.778625954198473

The natural habitats showcased are intriguing and beautiful, it's as if the viewer is taken to a different world in each episode, all connected together by the miracle of life and the majesty of nature. Some of the natural wildlife in some of these habitats are very unique. This series takes the viewer from ice worlds (the pole, etc) to waters (shallow, fresh, and deep oceans), to lands (plains, jungles, caves, forests, etc), basically from pole to pole - which is the title of the first episode. There are some scenes that are so beautiful that it brings a tear to my eye (the beauty of nature and the miracle of life), and then there are scenes that are suspenseful (when an animal is preying on another). However the very good thing about this series is that it doesn't get gory, so while it might show a wolf hunting or a shark hunting, once they've caught their prey the camera doesn't linger but moves on to a new scene. This series has 11 episodes in all, and each episode is around 55 minutes long.

Overall this series is great, and I have yet to find a natural documentary as beautifully shot, as touching, and as entertaining as this one.",1428969600,,1222,4.529411764705882

2740577,5,B000MR9D5E,"This is a wonderful series. Make sure to get the David Attenborough version, and make sure to get the version that has the Diaries at the end of each DVD. They give a behind-the-scenes look at some of the most interesting and challenging animals or places to film. And they are funny! Some of the cheaper editions you can find for sale omit these Diaries, and it's really, really worth getting the full version that contains them.

We watch one episode at a time during Documentary Dinners with our kids, ages 7, 6, and 4. Even young kids can get a lot out of this series. It really broadens their understanding of the world and its amazing natural diversity. The dialogue is not aimed at kids (which we like), but we pause a lot and discuss what is happening, and give the kids extra background information when we can (we are both biologists, and we homeschool... you can see why we love this series!).

David Attenborough' s narration is a personal favorite of mine to listen to, and this series provided no exception. His melody voice often harmonized well with the beautiful music, which always seems to match perfectly with the energy of the current environment.

The cinematography is just breathtakingly gorgeous, always a sight to behold. I always find myself wishing I could see it with my own eyes. The facts are also interesting. Not too pushy, but not fluffy either.

2740834,5,B000MR9D5E,"This set can only be described as ""visually stunning."" The BBC spent some 25 millions dollars on it's production a few years back, and it was one of the very first shows ever natively recorded in high definition. It was hideously expensive when it first came out, and the lower-resolution DVD versions were what many of us purchased (and it was still excellent). But  seeing this in high-def is what it is all about. It is mesmerizing, hauntingly beautiful, intriguing. It is also superbly narrated. It stands up to repeated viewings. And it is unique, even among nature shows. At today's price, it is a steal, and I can't recommend it more highly. I'd be surprised if you did not see all kinds of things in the presentation that you might not have seen before (I know I did). The show covers a wide variety of geographical regions, including the oceans, and was filmed in many fantastic locations that you will rarely have the chance to see. When we hear about financial issues in today's BBC that may eventual threaten its very existence, I think back to shows like this and hope they have the sense to keep the organization going.

WE WERE STUNNED AND ASKED THAT THEY SEND THEM BACK TO US IN MARYLAND; WE TRIED ON OUR OWN UNIT AND, OF COURSE,THEY WERE NOT COMPATABILE EITHER.

It's about the variety of stunning places and forms of life that exist on this miraculous planet. You can't help but feel a little heartsick at what's happening to it though.

Where this wins is in the sheer wonder this inspires. After years and years of watching nature documentaries, you'd think the world has little to surprise you with, but this will constantly make your jaw drop.

Of course, one cannot praise enough the narration by Sir David Attenborough, with his voice that has defined nature documentaries for many decades, and at times his commentary is almost poetic.

And finally, I got to see various locations I've seen with my own two eyes from vastly different viewpoints, which never fails to send a shiver down my spine!

Watching this in Blu-Ray on my new HDTV is wonderful.

That is very unfortunate seeing that this is what makes this ""limited edition"" so unique and personal. I contacted amazon and they said they could either replace it or give me a 30% refund.

We highly recommend it.  You will see things here that you would not even know otherwise, much less see.  The only thing that might be considered a drawback is that there is a little conservation propaganda in it.  If you are in to conservation efforts you will appreciate it more.

2741484,4,B000MR9D5E,"WHAT WILDEBEEST ARE REALLY UP TO WHEN WE AREN'T AROUND...
The camera work was totally amazing.
Mind and heart blowing stuff indeed!
The evolution sermon from Davey was the usual sermon; all about misapplying human thoughts and behaviours onto the animals. (At one point David tells us that a male Bird of Paradise is actually ""feeling dejected"" because he has been rejected by a female he was hoping to woo - I mean really? If that bird could talk to us would he ask us for directions to the nearest psychologist's office so as he could rest his weary wee wings, lie down on a leather sofa and chirp on and on about how hard it was cracking his way out of the egg because that must surely be the beginning of his low-wing-self-esteem).
Davey boy does that a lot throughout all his sermons, applies human thought and behaviour reasoning onto animals.
The other thing slightly annoying about Davey boy is he seems always to be telling us that this is what these creatures do whenever they are alone and once again ignores his contamination of the experiment created by the presence of humans and machines onto or into the environment being examined.
For all we know, herds of wildebeests are sitting about with their hooves up, reading the New York Post, drinking cappuccinos with lookouts up on every hill until suddenly one of the lookouts yells, ""Quick! It's Davey"" as the leader hides his newspaper, skulls his coffee and orders the herd, ""Alright now 90% of you chaps onto all fours and moo a lot; 5% of you have a quick fight and scratch your arses on a tree or something and the rest of you start humping"" And when Davey's crew are gone, they're are all back to boiling eggs, straining noodles and playing back-gammon, smoking freshly packed pipes and swirling their martinis with an antler.
My point is we don't know what animals do when we are not around because they do it when we are not around; we do, however have a little bit of a clue as to what some animals do when we are around huffing and puffing our way through the dense underbrush, lugging cameras and microphones and tents and whatnot, or hovering overhead in some noisy, pollution spewing helicopter - these creatures have rather good senses after all, and if I can hear a helicopter 5000 feet up in the sky, guess what!
The sermon based on the religion known as Evolution loses this program one star.
Personally I find it amazing that anyone could witness what we are witnessing on these Blu rays and not believe in the One who created all things seen and unseen; for me, it is yet another reason to be filled with awe at what God can do; the heavens themselves declare His Glory, as the Bible would rightfully tell us.
The four stars are for the sheer beauty of the camera work.
Jaw dropping!!!
Absolutely...
Hang on! One of the lookouts just yelled that Davey-boy is coming back.
""Moo...""

However there is no warning or information on the content being culled! It's called 'the omplete series' with at least 100 minutes of content less than the DVD version, That is certainly a disappointment for someone who bought the blu-ray to enhance the viewing experience.",1391212800,3,522,4.876404494382022

2741506,5,B000MR9D5E,"I over all liked this. Spectacular filming and great narrator to narrate the program. I especially like how they added at the end of the show a diary of how things went for these producers in the making of that particular show. It was interesting to know what it took for these camera men to film these animals and for some, how long they had to take in patience to get the right moment of filming. I know my granddaughter will love watching this. A good program for anybody who likes to watch these nature films and learn more about the animals and its habitat.",1390953600,,562,4.3619047619047615

For the company's sake I hope that's true, but I can not recommend this product.",1390348800,,386,4.450704225352113

I enjoyed BBC productions, and purchased Planet Earth and Blue Planet.  David Attenborough does a much better job of narrating than the others.  My disappointment was seeing the same footage at times with a slight twist on the narration.  I was not expecting Disney to have the same footage, and simply felt cheated.  Will the Life series be a repeat as well and waste of money?  Other than that, these documentaries are visually stunning and enjoyed with my kids.",1390262400,,638,4.807339449541284

2741518,4,B000MR9D5E,"There are certain features one has to put up with when viewing these 6 DVDs, but on balance the viewer will be impressed, and even amazed, by what he sees.

There are about four hours of viewing per disk. Disk 5 has commentaries about the future of species on our planet which are on the whole boring, but the other five disks offer fantastic filming of wildlife and areas of our planet one could never have imagined.

The music is at times loud, and it can drown the commentator's remarks, delivered in British English with varying voice inflections and strange names of exotic animals or places which the listener can't figure out by sound alone. Thus the smart thing to do, at the start of every viewing session, is to go to the Menu, click on Subtitles, and then move the cursor to English and click that so that English subtitles will be turned on. Then you'll be able to figure out what the commentator is trying to say and your experience will be much more pleasant.

There are FBI warnings and repetitious material to be put up with on each disk, but a viewer skilled in the use of his remote control can get out of that quickly and get on with the main material.

These seems to be a good 20 hours of fantastically good material in this DVD set, with each separate segment lasting about an hour, and the reader will be in awe of what the producers and cameramen have been able to come up with. Your conception of planet Earth (and of your place in it) will never be the same after you've seen this. You'll be amply educated, entertained, and even inspired from viewing this material.",1390089600,,1592,4.441780821917808

The only issue I had is some difficulty understanding the narrator at times.  He has a strong British accent.  I have a strong Midwestern accent so he may have the same problem understanding me.

I find it hard to get a movie that is good for both kids (interesting enough for 7 year old, not too scary for 4 year old - what is up with all the scary G movies??), and this one is perfect. I think there are still some of these we haven't seen because the kids demand to watch the single show about Caves over and over! We've had this for 2-3 years and still loving it.",1386806400,,509,3.857142857142857

His historical/biological background bring you right into focus with the plants, animals, and insects of our world. Must see. Must have. So detailed it bears watching many times. The behind the scenes at the end of each episodes give one an appreciation of the cameramen and camerawomen as well as the teams of people who helped this spectacle come to life.",1386201600,,511,5.011764705882353

2741579,2,B000MR9D5E,The whole series is destroyed by the strange and incomprehensible accent of the narrator.  I'm really shocked that BBC chose such a narrator.  I bet most speakers of standard British English and standard American English don't understand his English well enough.  BBC has gone too far in its affirmative action.,1385769600,,311,5.18

2741593,5,B000MR9D5E,"This is a beautifully created wildlife series. The only thing that bugs us a little bit is that it jumps from continent to continent with barely a mention of where you are viewing. For instance, you might be watching mountain lions in the US Rockies, and then without much notice they jump to similar cats in the mountains of Asia, and then off to New Zealand or somewhere. It's all very pretty, but I wish there was a little globe graphic down in the corner of the screen that reminded us of where we are visiting. I get my mind set on this scenery being in Asia, and then forget that we have jumped halfway around the world in the blink of an eye. Kind of wish they would study one continent or region at a time instead of globetrotting so much. Otherwise, this series is gorgeous, informative, and fascinating for all ages!",1384300800,2,826,4.405228758169935

The camera angles and shots are simply breathtaking and leave you asking, ""How did they get that shot?"", and the small glimpse that the series provides into the lives of the animals and environments that we share our world with will leave you without words.  With a 5 year production time and a $25 million dollar budget, Planet Earth is one of the most ambitious endeavors ever embarked on to document the world around us, and that it does.

Planet Earth is full of beautiful HD visuals and great educational content, but it is also something that you can shut your eyes and just listen to and let it lull you to sleep.  So I not only have enjoyed watching it in full, but I also take it with me on the road on my Kindle Fire HD and use it as ""white noise"" to help me sleep when I travel.

You'll need to lay aside the nonsense about global warming - remember that much of this series was developed when our politicians and media were on this bandwagon prior to the time that it was proven to be bunk.",1383436800,,731,4.055555555555555

From what I remember - this series is the original out of all the ""Planet Earth"" series videos. If you have other versions of these ""Planet Earth"" compilations (Discovery Channel, Disney, etc), they share a lot of the same scenes.

If you want a great collection of elegant and powerful animals filmed in their natural habitat - do not miss out on a great Blu-ray to add to your library.",1383091200,,641,4.423728813559322

Two aspects pervade the entire production: First, the irrelevance of human beings in matters planetary and second, the predominance of the struggle for survival among the planet's organisms.  Both aspects are important, given the hysteria about human beings causing global environmental change.  The show demonstrates that planet earth is in constant flux, as is the entire universe.  Man is merely a tiny and inconsequential blip on the galactic radar screen.

However, a caution:

If you have a PS3, you will experience lock-ups on the disc, and you will find little solutions and support online.

If you haven't formatted it in a while, many programs, save files, and such can affect certain Blu-ray playing. Clearing caches, and individual files may or may not work, but a full format WILL.

Please consider the trouble and willingness to do so, if you have a PS3 and such problems. There are dozens on 'non-formatting' solutions, and most will not work in your case.

So, be prepared. Save your files, prepare for the good possibility of having to re-format.

Is it worth it?

Yes. it absolutely is.",1377388800,,873,4.703947368421052

Very interesting and educations with eye- and brain-candy galore. Really enjoyed the footage and commentary! Some footage was shared with 'NG's Untamed Americas' and was a smidgeon of a let-down, otherwise fabulous!

Pros: Seemed short because it was so interesting and engaging!

Cons: There were not enough hours (see Pros). There is one more CON that might be considered a spoiler so stop reading if you don't want to be spoiled. Yes, 5-stars is still my rating, the series is totally worth the cost...and the last disc is bitter-sweet...

SEMI-SPOILER ALERT!
;
;

The final disc, while very interesting, was quite depressing. I can really appreciate the producers divulging into the background stories of the episodes, and getting a bit of semi-formal review on the state of the planet. However, they camera-operators, producers, and everyone else that was on-site for each of the filming sessions had some bad news regarding the environment: Pollution, missing species, some lonely suffering... If you have a soft heart, avoid the final disc, or schedule something very fun and engaging to do after watching to take you mind off of it...or go volunteer for an organization that can help do something for the state of the planet. My point is, after so much GOOD feeling during the other disc viewings, the final disc left me feeling sad, and mournful of the state that our planet is in. The footage and commentary was again fabulous throughout the final disc, and was still very interesting and fully worth the cost.",1376524800,,1681,4.829861111111111

We were watching it with our kids and our 8 year old was initially very disturbed by the killing of animals by other animals.  In the first episode, a wolf kills a baby caribou who was separated from his mother.  That was pretty upsetting to him.  But once he knew what to expect he was less upset by it.  Last night we watched the episode where a crocodile ate a wildebeest by grabbing its leg.  It took an hour for it to drown it and my son was sad that it suffered for an hour, but got over it.  Anyway, if you have sensitive children, be prepared that this series shows nature as it is, which at times is quite brutal.",1372550400,,873,4.339506172839506

I was VERY disappointed that the seller AND Amazon were not upfront about this BEFORE I ordered it. Now I have no idea if I can even return it, if I can I'm sure I'll have to pay return shipping, etc. Not to mention my parents are out their presents for awhile.

I felt like the producers did not structure the series on the basis of, ""What would be important to know about Planet Earth?""  Instead they asked, ""What cool footage do we have?  In particular, what cool footage do we have that no one has gotten before?""

One result of this: Though the series is about life on Planet Earth, there is little about the 90% of life that is made up of plants.  Plants mostly don't move and don't make for cool footage.

There is almost no coverage of the great number of species that cover the ocean floor(sea cucumbers, sponages, etc.) and the great number of insects that cover most land surfaces.

2741721,1,B000MR9D5E,"I purchased this series with very high hopes based on the reviews I read. I purchased is as ""used"" but, reportedly, in excellent condition.  It appeared to be in ""like new condition"" when I received the series. However, I found they would not play on either of my Samsung Blu Ray players even though they were properly rated for my geographical location. I followed Amazon's troubleshooting guidelines without any success. I then contacted Samsung for the ""Blu-Ray Update Discs"" they provide (free of charge).  When the discs arrived, I inserted them to update my players. I was informed that NO UPDATE NECESSARY on either of my Blu-Ray players. All of these troubleshooting actions took time to complete.  By the time I had accomplished all that I was supposed to do, according to Amazon's recommendations, the return time window had expired!

I called and spoke with Amazon about all of this but really got no satisfaction. I ended up returning the OBVIOUSLY DEFECTIVE DVD SERIES with a letter fully explaining everything enclosed. I asked Amazon to check the DVDs themselves to confirm what I was saying. I also asked them to replace the series or send me something comparable by this same presenter.  That was several, several weeks ago. They have my purchase price, AND they have their product back.  I have nothing as I have yet to get a response from Amazon regarding this issue.

It is unfortunate that Amazon has refused to respond to my concerns regarding this matter. I am a long standing customer with Amazon, and I have acted in good faith with them. I'm very disappointed that they have not responded to this issue.",1368576000,4,1629,4.838129496402877
2741722,1,B000MR9D5E,"To be honest, when I saw the complete series on the shelf for only $20 I was so excited to grab it. I instantly nabbed it up and bought it. I remember the days when it used to be $60! So I got it and went home, pressed play, and what was supposed to take 50 minutes for each episode became 20.

I mean Jesus Christ people, is this really what we have come to? Why not show the mating rituals of animals? Or the certain way they socialize. No. Time after time it's a baby bird dropping into a crocodile's jaws, a lion killing an antelope, or a snake eating something. Even something as majestic as a dolphin is just half about eating fish. Really people? This is your ""beautiful"" footage? It's pathetic and crass and shows what dullness is spat out by people that think they are so high and mighty that they find beauty in death. I find it quite interesting that a country that shows death and dying on a show about the beauty of Earth is the same country that has banned knives and guns because a few hundred people died every year as a result of them.

Easily a 1/5 and I'll be looking to get rid of this DVD set as soon as I can.",1368316800,5,1131,4.09009009009009

2741745,5,B000MR9D5E,"(thanks to the BBC for providing me with a review copy!)

The Planet Earth series has set a new gold standard for what nature programs should be. It features wonderful information, great music, excellent narration and, oh, my goodness...the sights. The sights! If you haven't got an HDTV, this title alone is valid reason to get one. It's just flat-out beautiful to look at, and the best way to look at it is through blu ray.

And I'm not kidding. On my TV (1080p, 42 inches), it looks just stunning. I really could go on for days about how perfect the picture is. The series never looked this good when shown on TV, and it doesn't even look as good streaming (I own the whole set on Amazon Instant Video). It's truly a wonder to behold.

Planet Earth, the Six Disc Special Edition contains not only all eleven episodes of the ground-breaking series, but you also get a whole raft of special bonus features, including a special about the snow leopard, one about the Mayan underworld, another focusing on elephants trying to survive in the Namibian desert (better them than me!), as well as commentaries, production diaries, ""Planet Earth: The Future"", a sneak peek at Frozen Planet and, fascinatingly, a music-only option. Yes, you can sit down and simply listen to the music as you watch the incredible beauty unfold on your screen.

Better still, for those of us in the USA, you get David Attenborough's original narration. Don't get me wrong; Sigourney Weaver did just fine. But, well, Attenborough. The guy's just flat-out incredible, and really knows his stuff. He makes for a much better VO choice than Weaver did.

This really is the best nature documentary series ever made. Blu ray really is the best way to see it. If you want a great way to celebrate Earth Day, or really just want to have a great time watching some TV, this is a perfect choice. I cannot recommend it highly enough.",1366416000,,1894,4.658682634730539
2741746,5,B000MR9D5E,"For anyone who likes documentaries, this is one of the best!  The product is native HD from start to finish, so this is great for HD widescreen TVs.  And the footage in the series is excellent as well.  I highly recommend this.",1366329600,,227,4.357142857142857

Also contains videos on how the film crew went about filming...those are just as fascinating as the actual DVDs.,1365120000,,256,5.071428571428571
2741761,2,B000MR9D5E,"I purchased this for my wife and I to enjoy and perhaps share with our children and grandchildren. We soon discovered that every episode has at least one or two 10-15 minutes  sequences where a predator chases, catches, kills and eats its prey in 1080p bloody high definition. I was conned into buying this thinking that it was only about the beauty of our planet. We watched about 4 episodes and that was enough blood and gore for us. There is no way that this is suitable for children. The nature scenes are breathtaking, but the gore spoils what should have been a celebration of the beauty of our planet.",1364601600,,608,4.527272727272727

I'll just say I highly recommend getting the David Attenborough BBC version instead of the Americanized version. Also, it would be a shame to get these in blu-ray instead of DVD if you have the option, the high-def is really worth the extra few dollars.",1364428800,,363,4.432835820895522

Take a look and stand in awe of the creation and the Creator.  Just a remarkable video series.  I have the greatest respect for the film crew on these adventures.  They are truly amazing.  Good work.

I can't agree with the evolutionary perspective on this one but for the most part I loved every minute of this series.  Just stating the above in case you are a bible-believing Christian so that you are aware of the perspective before you buy.  This won't bother everyone but if you have a biblical worldview (one that is solely according to scripture) then you will want to watch this with your children so that you can re-explain some of the content.

I purchased the online streaming and we have loved watching it on our ipad.  We are studying geography right now in Classical Conversations and this has been a good supplement to some of the science work that we are studying.",1362096000,,1099,4.579487179487179

The hunt for the Kimono Dragon being a standout. And now here he is 86 years young and conducting this amazing tour around our globe. Beautifully packaged 5-Disc set. Alas in shipping the plastic housing got a bit messed up. But luckily the discs were unhurt. I definately recommend this seller (this was a ""used"" purchase) so perhaps a cardboard insert in the packing might have been advisable to preserve the package.

I highly recommend sticking with the BBC original with David Attenborough.  I never thought narration could really make or break something as dramatically as I now feel it can.  I can't say I didn't like the US version but there is just a quality his Mr Attenborough's narration that makes the most mundane nature shots interesting.",1361404800,,506,4.588888888888889

2741836,4,B000MR9D5E,"This series is absolutely astonishing.  You will be mesmerized by every moment of it.  Unlike Attenborough's earlier ""Life of Birds"" and ""Life on Earth"" he does not venture with us on camera, but narrates the series which is mostly void of humans onscreen.

The first disc has an audio problem.  Attenborough's voice gets louder and quieter at irregular points making it necessary to turn the volume up louder than you may wish just to be able to hear him clearly during the points where is voice drops off.",1360368000,,507,4.7272727272727275

2741838,5,B000MR9D5E,"This is an awesome product. I was having a hard time figuring out what to buy my dad for Christmas and I decided to go with this. I'm so happy I did because he loved it! Since it is limited edition, it has a small plaque on the inside that tells you which number you have out of the 5000 that exist. The globe to hold all the DVDs makes this product even more unique from all the other packaging. It stands on it's own and can be even used as a center piece.

However the best part about this product is the DVDs' content of course. Not only is it interesting, but it is also a learning experience! Not to mention the cinematography is awesome and they have done such a beautiful job of capturing nature.

I highly recommend this product, it's definitely worth every penny!",1360281600,,773,4.2517006802721085

2741841,5,B000MR9D5E,"I have always loved nature programs and grew up watching Nature, Nova and the such on PBS as a kid. My brother owned a VHS set of another nature series narrated and presented by David Attenborough back in the 1990s so I already knew David does a wonderful job of narration. When I came across this limited edition I knew I just had to have it. My boyfriend bought it as a Christmas gift for me soon thereafter.

As appearances go, this globe is a great conversation piece all in itself. It comes in a clear plastic box. Upon removal from the packaging, opening the globe you see all of the discs partially raised up in their individual sleeves placed in their own slots. Even while opened it has a visual appeal to it that one can appreciate. The inside of the globe top has a scenic view of the sky, peering up through the trees. The detail of this globe is something I am proud to own, as a dvd collector.

As for the dvd's themselves, the footage speaks for itself. Absolutely spectacular! I played these dvd's on my surround sound system and was completely blown away. The crashing waves, the wind, the sounds of nature and all of it's fascinatingly diverse creatures left me not only in awe but it gave me a more profound respect for the natural world that is all around us.

The vibrant colors, the sound quality, the care for detail not only from the dvd's but the globe display itself all come together as a wonderful package that I would absolutely recommend to anyone who appreciates nature and appreciates quality decor items that add to a room's ""personality"", so to speak.

And nothing beats the narration of David Attenborough!

I highly recommend this limited edition.",1360108800,2,1683,4.559602649006623

2741854,5,B000MR9D5E,"As I am not a cable or satellite TV subscriber, I get only OTA broadcasts and was unable to watch this show when it was broadcast on Discovery. I watched this for the first time a couple of weeks ago, and the footage is gorgeous. This show remains mostly unbiased although it contains some pro conservation messages, it is nearly impossible not to in a nature documentary. This is a show that is educational and extraordinarily pretty. If you are interested in learning about some more interesting ecological parts of the planet this series is for you, If you just want to look at beautifully filmed images, it fills that as well, but most people, I expect, are like me and will be drawn to the whole experience this show creates. The video quality on the blu ray could be better, these are single layer disks containing 25 GB, so it isn't as good as it could be. That being said the whole thing is so immersive I scarcely noticed that the images were imperfect, then again I am not a videophile.",1359417600,,996,4.478021978021978

2741859,3,B000MR9D5E,First off this Is a landmark television series. This is one of my favorite television series of all time. I would highly recommend this to anybody was not seen it before. However I was hoping to get an enhanced edition in the sense that I would be receiving a 1080p copy instead of a 1080i. It defeats the point of having a Blu-ray if it is going to have the same resolution as the television format. Save yourself some money and buy the DVD set,1359331200,,445,4.247058823529412

2741863,5,B000MR9D5E,"The Blu-ray edition of this series is still the standard for high-definition home theaters.  The quality of the video is simply profound.

The content is amazing, of course.  Many have heralded it as the greatest documentary series of all time.  I don't feel qualified enough to make that determination, but the breadth of information contained on these discs brought the natural world more to life than the entirety of my education ever did.

I prefer the Richard Attenborough edition, since his voice is appropriately professorial and filled with gravitas.  By all accounts, the Sigourney Weaver edition is quite good, as well.

Anyway, you should have a copy of either.",1359158400,,672,5.110091743119266

2741867,1,B000MR9D5E,"But the entire pack of discs was unplayable because of damage. Purchased from the Amazon marketplace, however amazon customer service took great care of me. I have become hesitant about purchasing optical media from Amazon lately, if the customer service weren't so good I would never again purchase a disc of any kind from the site. In the span of a month 5 different discs arrived loose and scratched badly. The situation has always been resolved quickly and to my satisfaction though so I can't fault Amazon for that. The few minutes of footage that worked looked amazing and sounded quite good on my 5.1 system. I can't comment on the actual product much further than that...the packaging was attractive I guess.",1359072000,,716,4.877049180327869

Even if you are unimpressed by the mind-blowing photography and never-seen-before footage, there is no way you can ignore the effort that went into the production. Most of the time-lapse shots are mesmerizing. It made me re-evaluate my position on conserving natural resources and wildlife to say the least.

If nothing, it is completely worth watching just for the segment on Caves (the Lechuguilla), the vampire squid from hell, and also for the spectacular and admittedly a tad scary underwater scene in the Yucatan cenotes. I was positively moved by the footage of the Panda bear and its cub trying to survive in the wild.",1358985600,,665,4.9375

I am disappointed to find out that the Bluray version does not include the same bonus features as the DVD set does - namely, it doesn't include Disc 5, which holds Planet Earth - The Future.  *sigh*  Also the cardboard cover arrived scratched up.  Kinda wishing I hadn't spent the money upgrading to Bluray as the DVD series includes more footage.  Too bad.  The cinematography is still phenomenal though, so it's worth buying as long as you don't care about lack of the extra 150 minutes of bonus footage.",1358640000,,595,4.566037735849057

2 things:

These are the ones narrated by Richard Attenborough, not the ones narrated by Sigourney Weaver. Not a big deal, but if you don't like or have a hard time deciphering English accents, be aware.

Also, the voice seems a little buried in the audio track. To get the volume of the voice to be able to hear what hes saying, it makes all the other sounds quite loud.",1358121600,,544,4.262135922330097

The camera work is beyond fantastic and every scene is carefully captured. Specially some of the time lapse scenes, which left me in awe. Sir David Attenborough's soulful commentary adds life to these stunning visuals. Most people never get a chance to explore these places in person, so documentaries like Planet Earth act as a window to experience natural beauty in its purest and richest form.

The series is well segregated into 5 DVDs, each having around ten 50-minute episodes. Each episode ends with a 10 minute ""making of this episode"" video. The whole series has been painstakingly created (my gratitude to the crew), and is a gift for generations to come. With each episode, you really can't help marvel the variety and beauty of nature in it's various forms! My biggest takeaway was the nature of life, and how climate change has been impacting our planet.",1356652800,,578,4.908163265306122

2741958,4,B000MR9D5E,"My four-star rating is for the series itself, not how it looks on my method of viewing (Amazon Instant on the PS3).  The series is great.  It's a little heavy on the dramatization of predator/prey interactions for my taste, but other than that it's phenomenal.

Just a warning, though, don't watch this on Amazon Instant in HD if you expect those stunning visuals everybody talks about.  Close shots and slow shots will indeed be amazing.  Panoramic shots often have visible compression artifacts and anything with many animals or birds has TERRIBLE compression artifacts (squares, blocks, blurring, ""mosquito noise"" - basically like a really bad Youtube video).

It's not our connection.  The PS3 has priority and I've watched to make sure nothing was interfering - Amazon was delivering video at less than the max rate we could do at the time of day (which is normal).  But the ""HD"" stream simply cannot handle a fair number of scenes in this program and it's fairly disappointing.

One other nitpick, too - the audio mix is really weird on these episodes.  Voiceovers can be hard to hear and the whole soundtrack has an odd quality to it.

We haven't had these issues with Amazon Instant Video on other movies/TV we've watched.  I did send feedback to Amazon.",1356134400,,1262,4.845794392523365

The presentation, the case where the dvds are placed, are quite nice, everything in very good taste and quality. Something to remark especially is the definition of the images and the quality of the sound. Narrated by David Attemborough, it is always a pleasure to listen to,the same as the excellent music by George Fenton. And what you see and the way they worked to film the scenes is something certainly outstanding. Anything I can tell you will always be surpassed by having the experience of watching it. And you will want to watch it over and over again and through the years.

2742014,5,B000MR9D5E,"My entire family - husband, seven-year-old daughter, and I love BBC's Planet Earth series. It captures the wonders and mysteries of our great, wonderful planet in a production that is spectacular for its beauty and insights. What better way to introduce the younger generation (and reacquaint the older) with the natural wonders of planet Earth? This Blu-Ray set is not only beautiful in its presentation, it is also one of the best in terms of clarity of images and audio quality.

Much has been said about this show in previous reviews, so I will just recap the essentials. The production is narrated by Sir David Attenborough (I could just listen to this man all day with his evocative voice and unique narrative style). There are eleven episodes altogether running approximately 50 mins in length. The eleven episodes are found on four of the Blu-Ray discs, and the other two DVDs contain extras. All the DVDs are encased in paper jackets which can then be inserted into the spaces for each within the globe. For convenience sake, the globe sits flat.

It appears that this limited edition set numbers 50,000 sets. In addition, as if these features were not enough, there are four art cards that come with the set. I liked the cards since they are beautiful but it's not something I would have missed having in this set. Nevertheless, it is certainly a nice touch.

As I mentioned earlier, the picture quality is amazing, with clear, crisp images in 1080i. The audio quality is also excellent in DTS-HD 5.1. Customers might also be interested to know that in addition to the English track, there are subtitle options in English, Spanish, and French.

As for the extras contained on two of the DVDs, there are over seven hours of special features, including:
Producer commentary on select episodes
Four additional episodes, i.e. Great Planet Earth Moments, Snow Leopard: Beyond the Myth; Elephant Nomads of the Namib Desert, and Secrets of the Maya Underworld.
A thirteen minute sneak preview for a new BBC production, Frozen Planet
Music only viewing option
Diaries

In case anyone was wondering, the eleven episode titles are:
From Pole to Pole
Mountains
Fresh Water
Caves
Deserts
Ice Worlds
Great Plains
Jungles
Shallow Seas
Seasonal Forests
Ocean Deep

There's so much to appreciate and enjoy in this glorious Blu-Ray commemorative set of BBC's Planet Earth. Children and adults alike will be captivated by this engrossing production that informs, enlightens, and serves as a reminder of what is truly precious and deserves to be protected. Highly recommended!",1347840000,,2567,5.0
2742015,5,B000MR9D5E,"Absolutely extraordinary compilation of BBC productions on planet earth.
The Video: Some scenes or relatively long sequences do not have the absolute high definition 1080p, maybe the resolution is 1080i or 720, but the experience is absolutely brilliant, there are incredible shots made with cinema technology.
The sound: is the best part. I have a home theater with 3D sound and the experience is amazing, the sequences in the sea, forests, rivers, etc. like we're in the middle of the shot, with the animals.
I absolutely recommend this collection to appreciate what little we have left the planet.",1347580800,,600,5.13265306122449

The back of it where the description is says 1080p Blu-ray. When I opened the globe to check out the disks I was surprised to see the DVD logo. Every sleeve and disk was for the DVD version but was in the Blu-ray packaging. I'm sure this is just a mix up but upsets me all the same. I was very excited to get this and now will have to wait until Amazon sends a replacement. I'm sure the actual Blu-ray version is 5 stars but I felt that I should warn people to double check this just in case they are giving it for a gift. This is the only mix up I have had with Amazon in several years. I hope this is only a one time thing.

I have watched each segment of the series multiple times as my wife was fascinated by it. We actually learned about the series from the Oprah Winfrey Show and my wife had gotten the disks.

This set came so beautifully packaged that I had to make a video of it to show you how it came to me. This is a stunning globe having a built in stand with the disks inside and it makes a nice collector's piece or gift to a friend. If you have a family member or a friend who is a nature lover then I cannot think of a more beautiful gift to give them than this collector's set. It is one that they will enjoy for many years. It is like a living encyclopedia of our planet and its life! This is a mind numbing series that shows the beauty of nature and life on our planet! The packaging reflects the quality of the series and adds to the enjoyment of owning it. The gift sets come numbered and they produced 50,000 sets for sale.

My box set also included a set of four collector's cards featuring Polar Bears, Gemsbok Herd, Snow Leopard and the Chimpanzee. They are high resolution photographs with details about the animals range of habitat and their lifestyle.

If I could rate this as a 10 star product I would do so. It is so impressive to watch and enjoy that it will give you a new perspective of our planet. The beauty of Mother Nature and of the animals that we share this world with is spectacular! I highly recommend this to you!

This set of disks features the best cinematography of any nature series I have ever seen. They cover all aspects of the Earth and they are:
1. From Pole to Pole
2. Mountains
3. Fresh Water
4. Caves
5. Deserts
6. Ice Worlds

2742023,5,B000MR9D5E,"I have not yet watched all of the discs but have been blown away by the quality of the video and awesome sound of this blu ray. This is one of my prize blu ray's and a must for any collection. It looks so crystal clear and overwhelming on my 106 inch screen. The sound was also top notch with some nice deep rumbling from the sub woofer. Surprisingly it was my first nature disc but I don't know what took me so long. Definitely go with the six disc special edition version and steer clear of the Weaver commentary. I got this for around $25 used but all of the discs are in mint condition! There is some graininess present in the darker camera shots but this is expected. Also plan on eventually getting Blue Planet (when the blu ray comes out) and possibly Life as they both get stellar reviews. Others may want to check out the Extreme Ice video (still waiting for the blu-ray) as I was highly impressed when I watched it on Netflix.

UPDATE: I wanted to give an update because after a thorough investigation and reading hundereds of customer reviews and also professional reviews there are differences that need to be pointed out with all of the versions.

Six disc special edition: This is only 1080i- I have watched the entire episodes but not all of the special features. I found the picture to be stunning in most parts but there are some cases of noise espically in the darker shots. The sound is excellent and a solid upgrade from the last 2007 version. I did not like the special features as they did not look good on my set up or seem that interesting to me. When your eyes grow accustomed to watching HD videos standard def footage simply doesn't cut it.

Planet Earth BBC 2007- 4 disc version- I received this the other day and did a quick test run on a few parts of the first disc. I wasn't more impressed with the picture even though it is in 1080p. To be clear, this IS IN 1080P, it is NOT 1080i like some other reviews had posted (the Discovery version is 1080i from what I understand although I have not seen it). Overall is looked good but I did not like the sound as much. I also noticed some picture problems that I did not see in the Special edition version. On the freshwater disc during the Angel Falls sequence there is a slight stutter effect right before going over the falls.

Overall, i will have to recommend the six disc special edition because of the better sound and smoother overall picture. I will however update my review after watching more of the 2007 version. If you're only buying it for the special features I would hold off as I found them disappointing.",1346284800,,2597,4.381742738589212

I don't want to go into detail so you won't miss out on the 'wow' factor when it comes as a complete surprise; and it will.

A huge hats off to the cameramen who managed to capture shots that almost seem impossible and to the BBC for having the vision to budget so much money to do this right.

My preferred version is the one narrated by David Attenborough, his voice is almost hypnotic.  I have to give credit to Sigourney Weaver for the version she narrated as well, though I very much prefer Attenboroughs' version I think she did a pretty exceptional job herself.  So whichever one you get for narration you are in for a real treat.

My only issue with it is the disproportionate amount of time spent on cataloging predatory kills. Yes, I'm well aware that predation is not only part of nature but is essential to it, both in enabling magnificent creatures like lions and orcas to form part of our natural world, but also in maintaining the balance between herbivores and the producers (green plants) on which they feed. Take away the predators and in a short time the earth would be stripped of vegetation and everything would die. However, understanding why predation exists and watching it for entertainment are two different things. Without being too indelicate, evacuation of waste matter is one of the essential functions of all life forms, but I would find a production which devoted a considerable amount of time to showing it in graphic detail somewhat repulsive. The problem with predatory kills is that there are two parties involved, the predators (who can be amazing in their power and grace) and the prey animals, who are not having such a good time. Suffering, even by animals in the natural order of things and as a necessary part of life, is not pleasant to watch, to me at any rate.

If you feel the same, you might want to watch this for the wonders of nature, but (as I do) have your remote ready to fast forward when the killing crops up.",1342828800,4,1598,4.828467153284672
2742037,4,B000MR9D5E,Planet earth is a wonderful series to watch. Crystal clear on blu ray. Now i said it's fun to watch but the music and narrator can get quite monotonous.

When I saw the first episode I was like, this is a complete ripoff!! It doesn't explain different phenomenon around the earth or covers different things that happen. They just talk 10 minutes of nature and 40 minutes about animals.  The just go on and on about rare species like snow leopard, they show like 30 seconds of the rare species Lynx, that one can live in the forest and never see one. When The episode of the mountains came, I was so excited, because I love the stars and all of that stuff. It talked about penguins, and they showed like 5 seconds of the Southern Lights, and then they kept on talking about penguins. They also showed the midnight sun, but didn't explain  why it happened. Another thing that I really dislike, is the voice of David Attenborough. His voice is really annoying after seeing a couple of episodes.

It should be called Nature Animals, as you've never seen them before!  I would like the company to refund me all the money that I spent on this series, thank you!",1341014400,5,1173,4.391705069124424

But for those who are interested in exploring this planet from their homes (maybe because you are just too busy right now) it's really amazing and is the next best thing to actually being there! Although there is a scene involving the worlds largest pile of dung! so I guess maybe in some respects, it's actually more pleasant to watch from the comfort of your own home!",1331596800,,650,4.516949152542373

This series displays both the fragility and the resilience of creation and the interdependence of lifeforms.

2742129,4,B000MR9D5E,"I believe that David Attenbourough was born into this world as an old man. He has the most perfect old-man informative voice in the world, and while I listen to him narrate Planet Earth I feel as if a little girl again, sitting on my grandfather's lap and loving every second of his story.

Getting this in blu-ray was possibly one of the best decisions of my life. If you are wondering as to the differences between DVD and blu-ray, blu-ray is about 100000000x more awesome. If you have a tv that can accommodate 1080p, I must warn you that you may want to play this show on loop for the rest of your life. Every animal, every petal, every leaf is as if it is right in front of you. This show is beautiful, and there is not another like it. I bought this for my boyfriend as a present for Valentines day and he loves it.

GIFT WRAPPING BUYERS BEWARE: Amazon gift wrap this in a beautiful bag.... but contained in the bag was the ugly cardboard box that actually contained the Planet Earth item. Why would you ever pay 5 dollars extra for someone to place your cardboard package in a bag, in a package? Ridiculous. I would have otherwise given it 5 stars.",1330300800,3,1155,4.317972350230415

I previously bought Planet earth set on DVD, unfortunately when I upgraded to a proper full HD TV the quality was not satisfying so I decided to get the Blu-Ray one and all I can say is ""WOW"" it is indeed a hell of an experience, a must watch for everyone.

Needless to say that the content of ""Planet earth"" is amazing, you know.. BBC + David Attenborough, Should we really expect less? :), it's a great source of information suitable almost for all the family, except for some 'nature cruelty' that may not be suitable for everyone.",1329696000,2,568,4.504854368932039
2742132,4,B000MR9D5E,"This six blu-ray disc set is quite incredible in it's entirety. Picture quality is often spectacular in spite of the fact that it's 1080i and not 1080p HD. The narration is excellent and the content is highly informative, incredible and these discs can make you feel like a kid again. What I mean by the last part of that last sentence is that while watching some of the episodes on these discs, you (or at least I) get that same sense of wonderment, near disbelief and true amazement that only seems to exist when you're a kid seeing things for the first time. The one flaw with this set and the reason I only gave it four stars instead of five is that the DTS-HD HI RES audio track on each of the discs has an audible hiccup throughout the entire program. Every few minutes or so, between five and ten give or take, the audio will cut out for a split second then go back to normal. It occurs on each of the six discs to some degree or another and can be a little distracting. I know it's a flaw on the Planet Earth discs in particular because no other blu-ray discs that I have played before or since has behave that way. But for that one downside this is a great blu-ray/HD set and well worth the asking price in my opinion.",1329523200,,1227,4.225531914893617

2742136,5,B000MR9D5E,"I saw a couple episodes on commercial TV.  So, of course it was interrupted by commercials.  However the photography is so fantastic I decided to buy the DVD's to be able to watch it commercial free.  Best entertainment I have ever purchased and at a very reasonable price.  I find it totally absorbing, entertaining, and educational.  I imagine I will watch it repeatedly over the years.

The only quibble I have is that it takes a little bit of time to get into it.  The first disc has two commercials in the beginning.  One is for another set of DVD's called Blue Planet.  The other commercial is for BBC.  So far I've only watched two other discs and neither had those two commercials. Also I would prefer to have have it start up displaying a simple list of contents, you select one and get going.  These are a little more complicated than that.  Non-the-less the wait is soon forgotten once the episode starts. It will completely grab your attention - at least it did that for me.  If I could I would give it 6 stars.",1329004800,,1023,4.435483870967742

It's easy to see in scenes like the large numbers of birds in flight where there's more compression artifacts than birds visible.  I notice it all over the rest of the content as well.  It's very discouraging and has taken a lot away from what this title could have been.  If they reduced the number of episodes per disc and turned up the bit-rate we'd have an amazing Blu-ray.  The wonderful camerawork, footage and narration make this title interesting.  Unfortunately the technical aspects of the Blu-ray transfer are a mess.",1328918400,4,613,4.682242990654205

It covers everything from water marshes deep waters wildlife polar life in seperate discs narrated by David Attenborough who is equally fascinated by nature unlike the US version of narration which is more like bedtime story for kids. Again this is my perception.. Individual preferences may change.
This disc set is imported from UK and is region free. So u need not worry of regions when u travel around.it works on any blu ray player around the world.

This new Special Edition is even more spectacular than I expected and the incredible price from Amazon just sweetened the deal even more.

The PQ is amazing considering this was recorded in 2007. AQ is also outstanding. I've learned so much from this show, and the wonder it inspires is totally worth it. David Attenborough is one of my favorite narrators.

My only knock is that I would have preferred a plastic blu-ray cover instead of cardboard. Plastic stands the test of time better, but it's nothing too major. The discs are the reason I bought this, so I think it still deserves five stars.

2742194,4,B000MR9D5E,"This review is for the Six Disc, Special Edition Blu Ray set of Planet Earth.

Excellent product, and this package includes not only the 'on location' behind the scenes videos, but also several bonus videos. Anyone considering buying this is most likely already familiar with the incredible episodes themselves. I have only a couple of gripes with the set.

First, the menu navigation has not improved. It's not intuitive to watch just one episode. You can play all the episodes on the disc, but in order to play a single episode, you effectively have to go into the scene selection for that episode, then navigate to Chapter 1, and play from there. Also, on the DVD set, I'm pretty sure it would auto play the behind the scenes video for each episode after the credits rolled. On this set, you again need to navigate through the bonus features menu screens to find the on location short for the episode you just watched. Now, with a normal movie, this is fine, because most people will rarely watch these features. But since Planet Earth is episodic, and documentary style, it makes much more sense to pair each episode's companion mini-documentary together and auto play them instead of separating them by many menus.

Second is the packaging. I am never a fan of the clever cardboard 'slide-in' cases. As dust and other foreign particles get in the cardboard slots, sliding the discs in and out of the tight space will likely begin to scratch the surface of the discs. Only thing to do is try to be careful.

Aside from these two issues, the actual content is excellent, high-quality, and everything I was hoping for.",1325635200,6,1620,4.73404255319149

Being a Sigourney Weaver fan, I thought at first I would feel disappointed by her absence from the film.  Boy was I wrong!

All I can say is he loves dinosaurs and he was going to be learning about other animals in school.  We decided to get this set to show him about different species.  He sits down and watches them all the time, over and over again, and he can tell you about any animal on there.  I did watch one of them and its not normally my thing, but I was so hooked!

2742220,2,B000MR9D5E,"Do you like death? Well, if so you're in for a treat in this video series. Along with some of the most jaw-dropping, awe-inspiring shots ever put on film, you'll get a heavy barrage of animals hunting and eating each other. Understand, my wife and I are not vegetarians nor are we easily made squeemish. Our complaint about this series is the mind-numbing repetitiveness. Unbelievable overhead shots of are only part of this series. The rest is one animal after another stalking, killing and eating another. And it goes on like this over and over again every episode: stalk, kill, eat, stalk, kill, eat, etc. etc. As soon as you see some cute fuzzy thing on this show, you can rest assured it will be eaten alive in the next few minutes. In the episode on the Great Pains, we counted (yes, it was so repetitive we starting counting the kills) more than 10 kills in the one, 50-minute episode. That's one kill every 5 minutes.

Listen, we all know that hunting prey is a large part of life in the wild - it's feeding time 24/7 out there - but surely there are other aspects of life on earth. Couldn't the filmmakers could have shown us as those as well? What about nesting behaviour or mating rituals or raising the young? What about environmental science? There are so many things the filmmakers could have taught us about our planet. Yet everything is ignored for the sake of showing us one more kill. Such a shame, and a complete waste of spectacular cinemaphotography.",1323820800,8,1471,4.593155893536122

Then I saw the specifications and sadly is 1080i NOT p!!!!. I upgraded to bluray for image quality and got very disappointed. Be aware of this.",1320883200,8,456,4.193181818181818

2742243,5,B000MR9D5E,"If you haven't yet experienced Planet Earth, take this opportunity to ""see your world as never before"".  Incredible photography is the bedrock of this far reaching documentary series which spans the globe from mountains to deserts, caves to oceans finding every possible form of life be it large or small, predator or prey.  Equally enjoyable are the short snippets which close each segment detailing how some of the more stunning images were captured (wait until you see the shark explode out of the water to nab a meal) and you can't go wrong with Sigourney Weaver describing the action from start to finish.  You truly won't believe your eyes, especially if you have HD.",1320278400,,673,4.885964912280702
2742244,3,B000MR9D5E,"There are really few words that can readily add justification on just how beautiful and awe inspiring this groundbreaking series truly is. As wildlife documentaries go, PLANET EARTH sets a standard that most other film production companies can only dream about. It's with this re-release on Blu-Ray that they take it to even a more heightened level by adding extras that will round out the series in a way that a true fan of the program will drool over. My only complaint is that this release quite clearly indicates in it's selling copy above, and on the product's packaging, as well, that this new SPECIAL EDITION features a ""Music Only"" viewing option, when it does, in fact, also include SFX over ever music track when in this selected mode. This was a BIG let down for me, I was especially looking forward to experiencing the series again, sans dialogue and SFX. Had this detail been more clearly stated in the sales section on amazon's page, I'd likely have passed on it and have just kept to my original Blu-Ray release. A bit frustrating, but I think that those collectors who would seek out this product thinking that they were going to get something that seemed pretty clear that it would be ""music Only,"" and it turned out otherwise, would be more that a bit disappointed. Other than this, it's a great release. My rating only reflects that false advertising. :)",1320192000,6,1373,4.725

2742257,4,B000MR9D5E,"Taken purely as a documentary, the footage is spectacular.  The scope that is covered is simply phenomenal.  There is so much to the world that most people will never see or learn about, all packed into one Bluray (4 discs).  You will have to forego any creationist viewpoint (not a suprise, I'm sure) as it takes an old earth approach.  For me, it's not a problem - I can filter.  For my kids, a little narration and correction from Dad solves that problem.  If that point of contention does not matter to you or you are an evolutionist, you will be just fine.

I have deducted 1 star for the 1080i resolution.  It is noticeable as graininess, especially in large areas of similar color.  I had thought my receiver's video processing may have been introducing the noise, but after running a direct HDMI connection to my TV, the graininess was still there.

While I agree the globe and color cards are a bit on the elaborate side, it could be argued that fancy packaging is only a waste if it's meant to be discarded. In this case, it's obviously meant to be kept and displayed. It does look less user-friendly to me than standard disc cases though. Regardless, the series itself is stellar.

* 6 Blu-ray discs, with the 11 regular episodes plus 6.5 hours of bonus content
* 110 minutes of the behind-the-scenes video diaries (10 minutes per episode)
* ""Planet Earth - The Future"" three-part series
* Another behind-the-scenes extra with greatest moments from the series
* Three bonus episodes: ""Snow Leopard,"" ""Secrets of the Maya Underworld,"" and ""Elephant Nomads of the Namib Desert""
* Commentary on select episodes
* Option to turn off narration

It was explained to me that there was a format battle akin to the VHS-BETA battle of the 70's and Blu-Ray won out. So unless one has a machine for this particular format it is unplayable.

The Special Edition will be 6 discs, and will include everything the 2007 Blu-ray release was missing, and then some. There will be the video diaries, ""The Future"" three-part series, as well as additional bonus episodes including ""Snow Leopard,"" ""Maya Underworld,"" and ""Elephant Nomads."" Plus some other stuff. And of course it will have the Attenborough narration. You can read all about it on the BBC America Shop site. I'm sure it will pop up on Amazon soon enough.

I agree with many others that the original Blu-rays should have had at least some of these extras, but better late than never I suppose.

Sunday nights became the night when I knew I would have my mind blown away by some of the incredibly imagery from this series: a great white shark hunting seals, a pride of lions attacking an elephant at night, the funny mating dance of the birds of paradise.  Although this box set has the David Attenborough narration, I think I'm one of the few people that enjoyed Sigourney Weaver's American narration more.  It may be because it's what I heard first when watching the series, but I also think her female voice was a plus, like Mother Earth was explaining to me what I was seeing (I think it was much better than Oprah Winfrey's narration on Life).  I loved how this series didn't get preachy with the effects of humans on animal habitats, but instead just showed the wonders of these creatures in their natural state.

2742305,5,B000MR9D5E,"I bought ""Planet Earth: The Complete BBC Series"" and the ""Life"" series both narrated by David Attenborough on blu-ray.

The pictures are just stunning in quality.  Watching these in HD is the only way to go, and I highly recommend them both.

However, one thing I noticed after watching both sets of discs, is that there are a few bits of footage that are reused multiple times.  Its not a big deal, and even though I was close to dinging the product by 1-star for it, but if you go for a marathon viewing session, you will have very distinct moments of deja vu.

Even so, I still recommend both series.  These videos take you to places that are hard to imagine actually exist here on Earth - places where most people would not normally have an opportunity to visit.  Well worth the money, even if you have to sit through the Antarctica penguin scenes three or four times.

BTW, I noticed a few negative reviews regarding freezing or unplayable discs. I am using a (relatively new) PS3 in the US, and playback has been 100% flawless...",1308528000,,1035,4.497326203208556

2742320,5,B000MR9D5E,"I have been a fan of The Discovery Channel and NatGeo Channel for years.

The film/photography is literally stunning.  Even episodes that I expected to be boring (I prefer the animals, obviously) kept me engrossed because it was just so beautiful.

This is a phenomenal program for the entire family to enjoy.  I was lucky to snag this for $30 during the lightning deals at Christmas, but I would not hesitate to pay full price.  It is that good and the running time more than makes the cost reasonable.  This program is worth watching again and again to catch all the nuances missed on a first viewing.

2742326,5,B000MR9D5E,"Planet Earth was an extraordinary natural history documentary, reviewing life on earth in 13  x 50 minute episodes. This BBC (2007) series is a superb complement to the international 2010 Biodiversity Goals and the Millenium Ecosystem Assessment project, providing a much needed global perspective on biodiversity and its value to us, particularly in its appeal to our sense of wonder. Planet Earth was produced by Alastair Fothergill with much narration by David Attenborough, and additional narrators giving voice-overs to the audience. The quality of footage was exceptionally lush, with the aim of the production team being to use ""the power of the scenery"" (Fothergill) to showcase the immense beauty of natural and wild earth. The series focussed on the behaviour and interactions of charismatic species in wilderness landscapes. Biodiversity is visualized at a profound level - we see life in ten terrestrial, subterranean, freshwater and marine biomes around the world, in ways that we have not seen before. Planet Earth combines population, species and ecosystem perspectives on diversity, explores ecological interactions and the processes of change in species and ecosystems.

The series was ground breaking in several ways. Firstly, innovative new technology, such as the heligimble, allowed stable filming from helicopters, hot-air balloons and ultralight aircraft, with cameras that could film wide-angle landscapes and zoom from kilometers away to high resolution close-ups, without disturbing the animals. With this and other technologies the series gave a novel perspective on wild landscapes and was able to capture behaviour, such as a African wild-dog pack hunt, that can only be understood from the air. Secondly, a sense of purpose combined with a lavish budget led to filming in numerous locations, some of these in very remote places with extreme climates, such as winter in Antarctica. The  highly motivated film crews combined with a willingness to invest sufficient time and patience to film rarely seen iconic species throughout the earth - snow leopards, six-wired birds of paradise and oceanic white-tipped sharks are but a few memorable examples. The final footage was of unstinting quality. Scenes that we have seen previously were done better, with a focus on interactions and behaviour rather than simply recording the species. In addition there are even more scenes that we have never seen before; bouncing frogs on Mt Roraima in the Venezuelan tepuis, massed hordes of sea-snakes hunting with predatory fish on remote Indonesian reefs, and an immense mound of cockroaches in a Bornean cave. A third innovation is that the film crew emerges from behind the camera to become the human focus of the series - acknowledging that they themselves are also a driving force for conservation. At the end of each episode there is a 10 min documentary about the experiences of filming in one location, with scientific consultants and local residents just part of that crew rather than the focus. The series goes out of its way to approach the issue of conservation from the perspective of a wild earth. There are rarely shots of developed or degraded landscapes and the narration is focussed on wild nature, avoiding negative hectoring about environmental destruction.

Nevertheless, Planet Earth does have a message: there is a biodiversity crisis, we have a lot to lose and we can do something to prevent this. While the first ten episodes convince us through their beauty, the last three episodes of Planet Earth comprise lucid and insightful discussions, interspersed with footage from earlier episodes, giving the sometimes conflicting wisdoms of conservation leaders, senior public servants, philosophers and scientists about the environmental challenges facing humanity.",1305849600,,3801,5.426395939086294

2742329,5,B000MR9D5E,"There seemed to be some confusion to which version this is. I bought it from Amazon and not a third-party, I recieved the 4 Disc BBC version for distribution in the US. Some people believe the video is 1080i (interlaced) and not 1080p. They would think this because the box says 1080i, HOWEVER, I've looked at the mt2s files contained on the Bluray disc through a codec analyzer and it contained no information about it being interlaced. Also With interlaced video there is the obvious ""mouse teeth"" or jaggedness seen most noticable durring fast motion and when you pause. I've look through many frames, paused, started, and took a hard look at the video. There is no interlacing. Its definatly 1080p like the other BBC released versions, likely just a missprint on the box.

Other than disputes of the video type the series is perfect. I was amazed. I didn't look to see if there were extras or not, I don't really care about extras. I just wanted to main series.",1305244800,,965,4.643274853801169

2742336,5,B000MR9D5E,"What can one say about such a masterpiece? Alastair Fothergill and BBC have definitely made a revolution in the natural history documentaries. The subtitle of the series is perhaps the best description that can be given: ""as you've never seen it before.""

Not only is ""Planet Earth"" the first such documentary to be shot in high definition, but it is also the first one to exploit air views and time lapse photography to an unprecedented degree. Watching savana dogs hunting antelopes or wolves hunting caribou from the air as well as autumn changing of the leaves or ice invasion in a few seconds is a relly breathtaking experience. It is something that simply cannot be described. It must be seen.

The best thing about the series, however, is that all 11 episodes are not mere feast for the eyes. Every episode is dedicated to certain wilderness - jungle, seasonal forests, deserts, caves, rivers, seas of grass, shallow seas, deep oceans, poles, mountains, or all of them together - and in less than an hour gives the most comprehensive view possible in so short a time. The accompanying narration - with the wonderful voice of David Attenborough - is always to the point, clarifying every detail of the picture and is with so fine a diction that even people for whom English is not native language can easily understand every single word. Moreover, the narration gives additional and often essential details that complement the visual aspect in an astonishing way. Indeed, the very presence of Sir David - although in voice only, he does not appear otherwise - is the best possible recommendation for the series, even though in this case he is not the author but only a narrator.

There is one more thing that need be mentioned. Some faint-hearted people might well find the series too brutal and offensive for their taste. To my mind, that's pretty silly but I daresay it is not altogether unnatural for silly race like mankind. The fact is that a great part of the series, although by no means all the time, is occupied with the everlasting ritual between the hunters and the hunted, the predators and the prey. There are some scenes of animals killing other animals that are quite brutal even if they are done in the finest possible taste. Wolves chasing and killing calves seen from the air, crocodiles dragging antelopes in the river, a fox killing several little chicks in seconds, a crocodile snatching bird fallen from a tree, seals pouncing on penguins, a tiger surprising a monkey from behind, a huge pride of thirty lions or so chasing and killing an elephant, great white shark coming out of the water and catching a seal at the same time, and so on so forth. All these scenes are not too graphic, they are invariably shot as to minimize the gruesome details but they do often have a certain brutality that can cause some mental disturbance of people with especially wrecked nerves. There are also some very moving and deeply saddening scenes, like an elephant lost in the sand storm following his fellow's trace but in the wrong direction to the desert or a white bear - the biggest carnivore on Earth - exhausted from days swimming and ferocious fights with huge walruses laying down and waiting for the death to come.

I have mixed feelings myself watching such scenes. On the one hand, at the first moment, I am terrified and shocked, but immediately afterwards I am overwhelmed with awe and admiration for the predator and pity for the prey. I remember that that is the way the things really are in the wild and that's the way they should be. I am much more astonished at the fine balance between hunters and hunted that has allowed them to live together for tens of thousands of years than disgusted by the apparent brutality of the killing or broken by the heart-rending stories of some animals. Men are by far more brutal creatures than any animal after all, and I am much more horrified by men killing lots of animals just for pleasure than by any natural killing of the hunted by the hunters. Nevertheless, I think I should warn the more sensitive (or shallow, depends on the point of view) people who are going to watch the series that their sensitivity might be offended and they may be revolted before watched half of the series. I also think that anybody who is really interested in the nature and the wild life will have no such problems.

After all, the main goal of the series was to show some of the last wildernesses that existed on Earth and how their animals, plants and rocks really look like. And Alastair Fothergill and company, working at the cutting edge of the modern entertainment, have done a superb job of it. The facts that ""Planet Earth"" is not only a stunning and brilliantly realised visual conception, but actually far more serious and thought-provoking than mere entertainment can hardly be denied.",1303689600,,4851,4.7225501770956315

2742377,5,B000MR9D5E,This is an amazing series about our incredible planet. The series uses new and revolutionary filming techniques which are often explored in the Planet earth diaries at the end of each episode. You know you're on safe ground as soon as you hear Attenborough's voice narrating and it lends the series some serious credibility. The themes this series covers truly makes you appreciate the diversity of our planet and I agree with other reviewers that this should be shown to kids at school. It would really foster a delight and respect for our planet that is desperately needed right now. I defy you to watch this series and not be left breathless by some of the things they show you.

2742379,4,B000MR9D5E,I purchased this Planet Earth Blu-ray without seeing it prior to purchase.  I had heard such amazing comments from my friends that had watched it that I had to have it.  Once I started watching it I was a bit disappointed since it's a compilation of the best Nature snippets from BBC.  I'd already watched the majority of the 4 Blu-ray set and actually had another Nature BBC Blu-ray that had some of the exact same footage.  I still highly recommend this documentary because it's beautiful and touching.  The picture is so crisp and clear.  If you are an avid Nature watcher then be prepared to have watched the majority of this program.  The narration by David Attenborough is amazing and truly draws you into the magnitude and beauty of the Earth.,1299024000,,750,4.636363636363637
2742380,4,B000MR9D5E,I have to go along with all the other reviews noted here. One thing I will point out is that when I originally saw this series on TV Sigourney Weaver did the narration. I much preferred hers to David Attenbourghs. Other than that the magnificent cinemaphotography shows through on this Blu-Ray edition. Without a doubt the best documentary of it's kind. Some of the images are simply stunning. Especially liked 'Deep Ocean' where some of the lifeforms are right out of some science fiction writers imagination. My wife is a teacher's assistant and I let her borrow this film to show to her students. She tells me the kids were totally absorbed and facinated by this film. Kudos BBC,1298937600,,681,4.73109243697479

I decided to see what the highdef version looked like.  The quality is just AMAZING!!.  If you really want to show off your TV and feel like you are actually on the site, this is one of the must have items (along with Life).  This is the origianl with the Richard Attenborough narration - accept nothing else.",1298851200,,419,4.473684210526316

I'm a huge fan of History/Discovery/BBC productions and this is why. This Series proves that when the BBC takes it's time and puts forth the effort, they truely have the best production in the world. The production levels are right up there with the Walking with... series.

If you know someone who is just refusing to make the jump to HD or Blu-Ray, show them this. After seeing this, they will want one. This shows what HDTV & Blu -Ray is all about. I highly recommend this series even if you don't like this type of programming. If for nothing else to show off you HD equipment. It's that amazing!",1298505600,,715,4.5
2742383,5,B000MR9D5E,"This is one of the most absorbing videos I have ever watched. I highly recommend this version -- the BBC production narrated by David Attenborough. There is a Discovery Channel edition narrated by Sigourney Weaver. I am sure Ms. Weaver did just as commendable a narration, but the BBC's edition includes a behind-the-scenes/how-it-was-done video following each chapter. Those vignettes are fascinating.",1298419200,,402,5.60655737704918
2742384,3,B000MR9D5E,"After reading all the great reviews, I expected something a little more exciting.  Yes, the shots were great, especially of rare birds and animals, but I found the narration to be boring.  I watched it with my mom and even she commented that David Attenborough was putting her to sleep.  Also, the music in the video was much louder than his voice, so you really had to strain to hear what he is saying.  We still enjoyed it - something relaxing yet intellectually stimulating to watch at the end of the day.",1298332800,,508,4.489130434782608

2742407,1,B000MR9D5E,"If you enjoy watching helpless life getting butchered in high def video while dramatic music fills your ears, you might like this. I had very high hopes for this series given the production effort and reviews. I watched a bit, but stopped due to the enormous amounts of negative energy it generates, by the aforementioned ""hunt"" scenes that are a central ingredient to the series. This could have been called ""Faces of Death, Animal Edition"".

In my opinion, to say that ""the series proceeds to accentuate the positive"" as the ""Editorial Review"" does, is simply comical, as well, the review is quite misleading by underplaying the vast degree of brutality. Yes, the killing exists on our planet but that's hardly a reason to pollute your mind with it in graphic detail, much less that of your children. There is so much more beauty to Earth that could have been covered, which was what the marketing lead me to think I was getting, even the back cover of the disc box proclaims one will be ""overwhelmed by the beauty and majesty"". What a farce.

Please, do the Earth a favor, and don't watch this. Hopefully someone will someday produce something that will inspire the old and young to be better stewards of this planet, which we certainly do need. While the video is loaded with breathtaking cinematography, this just isn't it.

Some notes: I have a seven foot wide movie projection screen which brilliantly magnifies the good and bad of the imagery. You might not get the same perspective on a small TV in low def. ...  As an unsheltered, vegetarian who has spent months in the remote wild, I understand the nature of the food chain, the issue is with the psychology of watching killings and seeing terrified animals running for their life, as depicted. Yes, the food chain should be taught, and understood, but too much negative sensory input can have unintended side effects... or should 10 year olds watch ""Faces of Death"" at school? Everything in fine balance. If nothing else, this is an epic fail in marketing.",1296432000,16,2018,4.757142857142857
2742408,5,B000MR9D5E,"I'll make this brief and to the point.  We had just purchased a new large flat screen LCD television with a Blu-Ray DVD player.  I had seen the Planet Earth series before on other TV sets, and as a science series, it is very good.  So we bought David Attenborough's Planet Earth.  In a sentence, this Blu-Ray DVD should be in everyone's library, because it shows just how absolutely excellent the new LCD sets are when projecting great quality images in 1080 definition.  The detail is gorgeous and amazing.  Technically, this series from the BBC is of the highest quality in terms of content.  There are different versions with different moderators, but I like Sir David's version best.  I've seen the non Blu-Ray regular DVD version of this, and it is nowhere near as sharp in its detail.  Blu-Ray DVDs have over five times the capacity per disk compared with a standard DVD, so there is more room on it to put a video image with less compression, resulting in a much higher quality result.  I liked Blu-Ray Planet Earth so much that I later purchased the Blu-Ray Life series, also by Attenborough.  If you want to amaze visitors with the quality of your new large flat screen TV, get Planet Earth.  It is great.",1295654400,,1214,4.595348837209302

2742431,3,B000MR9D5E,"The content of the Planet Earth series is excellent as already covered by many reviewers. However, I would like to clarify for prospective buyers that the video format of the blu ray disc sold on Amazon is 1080i (this is stated at the back of the box and has been confirmed by BBC and Warner Brothers; see: http://www.amazon.com/Planet-Earth-bluray-video-format/forum/FxHGEFTIWGVM3N/Tx2W7NAFMO0DY24/1?_encoding=UTF8&asin=B000MR9D5E). As a videophile, I was looking forward to enjoying the excellent quality of the video in addition to appreciating the content. However, I was somewhat disappointed with the video quality which often gets grainy and fuzzy (relatively to high end 1080p content), particularly when the camera pans. I saw a number of reviewers raving about the 1080p quality and HD transfers which was a factor in my buying decision. Over 200 reviewers have tagged this as 1080p (although some earlier BDs were mislabeled as 1080p but that has since been fixed). Had I known that the quality of the video is not stellar, I may have not bought it but since the content is good and I already bought it, I will keep it. I got it on Amazon for $36, which is not a bad price even for 1080i.

If you are buying this for content and expect average HD picture quality, you won't be disappointed. If you are a videophile expecting top quality 1080p video, be careful!",1294444800,9,1372,5.044052863436123

This was a series put together by Discovery, BBC and NHK, a Japanese film company; taking 3 major film companies to put together such a amazing documentary.

The product they sell on Amazon is listed as 1080p, but the Blu-ray I received was only 1080i.  Big difference for a videophile.

Because I have not been able to find it anywhere in 1080p I believe this is the only way it is produced, but if so Amazon should have it listed correctly.",1294099200,5,480,4.184782608695652

Oh my word that National Geographic had this technology when they did the Namib desert, or ""The Incredible (Human?) Machine"", ""The Hidden World of Insects"", ""Reptiles and Amphibians"" etc. etc....  and if Marlin Perkins and the old ""Wild Kingdom"" bunch had this stuff the BBC would (probably) not have had the nerve to air this indifferent program.  Oh that the BBC had included that kind of depth and diversity into their special, or at least stuck to one area of the globe at a time.  This really wasn't as good as the Blue Planet - Seas of Life program.  Sure, if you like nature stuff you'll more than enjoy this, but it looks like this was a ""...hey, this is what our camera crews got, make something out of it"" type of deal.  Spread much too thin and the premise of 10 different habitats really doesn't work.  And most of the above ground stuff is shot from the air; although much of the content is enhanced by giving you this view it relies too much on the technique.  However, the fault in programming is strictly the BBC's and, though this is only slightly more than mediocre nature documentary fare because of the up-to-date equipment available to up-to-date production crews, for the price Amazon has on the blu-ray it is absolutely worth it because, although quite limited in scope despite the claim of PLANET Earth (a lot of shots from orbit and quite a bit left out), it is still beautiful.",1293321600,2,1703,4.634551495016611

But when I see now, there another set says, 'complete series with 5 Discs, am disappointed.

Just an amazing work, presenting the vast spectrum of life we share this planet with. Truth is stranger than fiction, and you may not believe some of the things you will witness in this series - creatures that live on Earth are more fascinating than anything Hollywood ever thought up.

No complaints here about David Attenborough's narration, the music, or the sound quality overall.

2742489,5,B000MR9D5E,"It goes without saying, by now, that this series is excellent.  Well worth owning.

That's the content, let's get to the Blu-ray quality!

The quality of the Blu-ray playback is very good, but not always perfect.  At least on my player, which is a Sony Blu-ray player known for good quality playback, I can see some strange artifacts - but there are not that many of them.  In one of the episodes, there are eagles and other birds flying, and you can see flashes of their wings drawn at the wrong place and time.

But those problems are few and far between.  This series looks amazing on blu-ray!!!  I love watching the massive waterfall scenes - definitely like being in a theatre when you're watching it on a 55"" screen!

I found that setting my TV to the clearest (Samsung calls it ""smooth"") setting, Planet Earth looks great.  This means that scenes with motion are as clear as they can be.

Seriously or not, the above statement captures the amazingness that is Planet Earth.  I don't see how anyone can't watch this series and not be blown away... moved... mesmerized by how astounding this world truly is.  There's so much we don't see living in our giant concrete and glass monkey hives.  This DVD set lets us glimpse the beauty of areas where people haven't done damage yet.  It makes you want to be an environmentalist, if just to keep these regions pristine.  The footage of animals and how they live is... words really don't describe it.

Mr. Attenborough is the man.  His narrative of this series is perfect and appropriate.  His voice brings the sense of father time taking you through the awesomeness of our world.  Can't think of anyone better.

Pick up this series immediately.  Make your kids watch it; make your relatives watch it; leave it on for your pets.  Then buy Blue Planet and start all over again.",1289779200,4,1116,4.598984771573604

2742520,5,B000MR9D5E,"I do not intend on promoting capitalism when suggesting people should purchase this blu-ray but they should. BBC have created a marvellous 11 50 minute episodes of sheer splendour and entetainment. Each episode is constanlty fascinating and intensely interesting to watch and learn about this real world we live in but most of us do not see. In some cases in caves stretching miles beneath the earth and cavities stretched within the deepest most uninhibitable places on earth not many people in the hstory of the world have seen until the BBC got there. My favourite episodes would have to be the first episode, the one about underwater caves, ice worlds and shallow seas but really they all deserve about 4-5 stars each. I believe this would be an excellent documentary to show to all children as it is very educational. In pristine, breathtaking 1080i Full High Defintion this is a great show case which could easily spark children's interest in science and geography.

 I hope no one is fooled because this is a documentary, because I have seen many documentaries like this and March of the Penguins which are as entertaining as 5 star movies like North by Northwest.
 I definetly recommend this blu-ray wholeheartedly.
Thank you BBC,
Thank you David Attenborough
Thank you amazon.com for the exceptionally fast shipping and bargain prices

note: Also I heard there was a new blu-ray vesion of Planet Earth available that has a special features, so you might want to consider that.

While not always presented in Hi-definition, this is akin to limits in technology due to some of the extreme environments they shot in, and consists of maybe 10 percent of the footage. The rest is richly detailed, and at times, jaw-dropping.
Aided much by David Attenburrough's wonderful narration, this unforgettable series highlights the inherent mystery, beauty, tragedy, and peril of this unique world of ours. My top episode picks would have to be ""Tropical Rainforests"" and ""Shallow Seas"".",1285286400,,794,5.162790697674419

Anyway, I also own the HD DVD version (but am in the process of switching it to a Blu Ray through [...]), but have also seen the Blu Ray version. Basically, anything David Attenborough narrates is gold (at least from what I have seen).

That aside, this series is spectacular. The narration is top-notch, but even better is the crystal clear HD. It is among the best I have ever seen and is worth every penny. On top of that, the series is very entertaining and informative. My personal favorite is ""Deep Ocean"" (I love stuff about the abyss... way below where humans are capable of going.).

2742560,3,B000MR9D5E,"I live in U.S. but I bought this Blu-ray set from Amazon.co.uk and paid less than $30 including shipping. So it was a better deal. From what I read in the reviews, there are two BBC Blu-ray versions, both were narrated by David Attenborough. One version contains four discs. The other contains five discs. The version I bought from Amazon.co.uk contains five discs. The last disc includes two topics: Desert Lion and Snow Leopard. Each is about 40 minutes or so.  However, both BBC Blu-ray versions are missing the behind scene/special features included in the DVD version. This is a big disappointment.  What's more, this series was shot with a lower grade HD specification - 1080i (also known as 720p) instead of 1080p.  1080p was mistakenly printed on the covers of earlier boxes but this error was later fixed. All the boxes now have the correct format (1080i) listed. Whoever said that 1080i (720p) is visually undetectable compared to 1080p either has eye problem or is using a small TV.  On a 40"" or larger TV, 720i is noticeably grainier than 1080p.  Compare ""Planet Earth"" with the new BBC series ""Life"" which was shot in 1080p, the difference is quite obvious.

Overall, this BBC production is fantastic, like many of the other series they did. If I am rating the DVD version (which I also own), I will give it five stars.

2742566,3,B000MR9D5E,"The photography in this series is, as everyone on earth has noted, spectacular, and many scenes capture things not seen before or rarely depicted. But the glory of the images only shows by contrast how weak the script is. In fact, calling it ""weak"" is being too kind. It's moronic. Each episode takes on some huge topic, thereby ensuring that only the most broad statements can be applied. We learn, for example, that rivers flow into lakes or the ocean--something that my daughters knew when they were four years old. Except for very rare instances, there are very few sections that are focused or detailed enough to provide any substantial information. Worse still, such information as there is is riddled with errors. In just one episode--on fresh water--the film claims that the Grand Canyon has been formed by the carving action of the Colorado River, when in fact much of the canyon's formation was from other rivers, rain, and wind. In the same episode, it claims that the fresh water seals of Lake Baikal are the only ones in the world, when in fact there are several others, including one species in Canada. And then there's the more indirect issue of how predators are presented: always as evil, frightening creatures, rather than seeing them as a necessary and natural part of the larger system. It's a shame, really, because photography this ravishing deserves a script and narration of equal quality.

This series also shows you locations at different times of the year, and explains how different seasons force wildlife to adapt. Overall, this series really holds your attention and makes you see the diverse planet we live on in a new light. This isn't your high school nature documentary, you'll be wide awake for this.

First of all, the seller, Source Media Group, was great. The item was fulfilled by Amazon, so my Prime benefits applied and the product was like new, just as it was listed.  I'm very happy with the transaction and the seller.

The DVD content is just outstanding, which is to be expected from such a much-lauded television show.  Some of the footage is simply unbelievable and I find myself being awed and amazed every time I watch.  Some of this is information you know and some of it is brand new; part of the appeal of this set is the learning opportunity it creates for adults and kids alike.

I have watched this set with people ranging in age from 9 to 50 and everyone enjoys it.  It's also a go-to; when there's nothing new out on disc and nothing good on television, I know I'll find this entertaining and engaging.

Yes, it's long, but it's a big world, right?  I can't imagine anyone regretting the purchase of Planet Earth and I really think every home and classroom (at least, every science classroom) should have this set.  Of particular interest: the caribou migration on disc one and all of the undersea stuff.

This set has Richard Attenborough as the narrator, but I liked Weaver better.

I will likely never get to almost any of the places shown so I now will be able to 'go' again, and learn more, any time I want.

I gave 5 stars because of the content and the extras.  There was additional content that the Discovery version didn't have.

Attenborough does a great job of narrating, and more people may enjoy his narration, but my personal preference was Weaver and she doesn't narrate this extended version.",1277337600,,621,4.660550458715596

2742625,5,B000MR9D5E,"It is hard to find a starting point in reviewing a film series that has set such a high standard of achievement. I frequently found myself pausing, rewinding and replaying multiple segments of each eposide, fascinated with the extent to which these expert filmmakers went to capture such amazing footage. What sets this ""nature documentary"" apart from all that have come before it is the expert utilization of a multitude of filmmaking tools reserved for big budget TV commercials, music videos and feature films. Examples can be seen right from the first episode, where the use of a motion control rig and time lapse photography shows the full, month long transition between seasons on the arctic tundra, and long distance, high speed lenses capture the frolicking of a polar bear and her cubs. The African wild dog hunt segment made use of a high-tech helicopter HD camera mount, formerly used exclusively by the military. Even small clips that take you into the next act are amazing, unparalleled photographic achievements.

Photographic and technical wizardry aside, the mandate of this series was to show the planet and it's non-human inhabitants as they've never been seen before. In this respect, the producer, Alistair Fothergill, and his team of hundreds have far exceeded their goal. This did not come about without putting in a mammoth amount of sweat equity. In watching the 10 minute diary segements after each episode, one sees the drive and determination of the crew, sometimes up to three years of hiking and filming, to capture a few minutes of rare footage. A previous reviewer has referenced the snow leopard and shark footage, I would like to add the pirhana feeding frenzy and stork migration over Mount Everest as truly awestriking segments as well.

The narration by David Attenbourough adds a gentle backstory and a few exclamation points to footage that could stand alone without it. A 5.1 soundtrack, and BBC Orchestra score give a compelling reason to turn up the volume, sit back and enjoy the glory of this absolutely flawless presentation. This is a must see series for children and adults alike... awesome... awesome... awesome!

PS: Stick with the standard def as opposed to the blu-ray - no extras on the blu-ray!",1276128000,,2246,5.016085790884718
2742626,4,B000MR9D5E,"The standard footage (that ran in the original television series) is incredibly beautiful.  The series take full advantage of my blu-ray set-up as well or better than any Hollywood film that I own.  David Attenborough is the best there is at the documentary narrative.  The finished product is amazing.

So why only 4 stars?

For some unimaginable reason, the BBC decided not to include the hundreds of hours of bonus footage they shot.  A lot of it is available in other formats (or even on the Discovery Blu-Ray release...though then you have to listen to Sigourney Weaver).  Not a deal-breaker, but it would be nice to have.",1276128000,,627,4.803738317757009

2742628,5,B000MR9D5E,"After doing a lot of research, I decided to buy this on Amazon.co.uk . I looked into it after reading some of the comments here from people who did the same, however they didn't give all the information I was looking for. So here is my comment:

Amazon.co.uk has this exact series for 17.93 Pounds but when I checked out they charged 15.26 Pounds. To add it all up, with price of item, shipping charges (to NJ), currency conversion, my Amazon Visa charging me 3% for currency exchange fee, I paid a total of $28.27 in US dollars for this DVD BluRay series. The only difference is that their version has 5 discs. The item arrived in one week via Royal Mail. I don't know if the UK version has more footage on the 5 discs but it says runtime of 550 min.

If you decide to buy it from the UK, make sure you buy the ""All Regions"" format. They sell both PAL version (which only plays in Europe and will not play in your BluRay)and they also sell All Regions version. You can find this info on the Product Details section (scroll down) on the page for the item. In the UK as well as some US reviews it also stated that it's in 1080p which is NOT true. The series is in 1080i. It says it on the back of the box. In any case, the picture is beautiful and you will not be disappointed. It plays on my cheap Blu-ray player that has no special features and I view it on my 46"" 1080p LED TV. You can read the other reviews about the picture quality and the footage. They're all true so I won't go into details about it.

Note: Before you buy from the UK, call your credit card and find out what percentage they charge for currency exchange fees so you won't be surprised later. Like I said, Amazon Visa charged me 3% (at least that's what they told me but when I got my bill there wasn't any extra charges. Maybe Amazon includes it with the purchase total), and my AmEx wanted to charge me 2.7%.

I'm a little disappointed in amazon.com (US) for charging $50 when you can buy it from the UK for just about half the price. Sometimes you have to do some extra research. I hope this review helped.",1275091200,8,2082,4.184538653366584

I specially like the fact that the related subjects are grouped together into a single Blu-ray. This is a worthy series educationally and technologically.

I did that in April 2010, and since then, the UK version has been cheaper than the US version, even after factoring in the lack of free shipping.  In my case, after subtracting VAT (the built-in tax that you don't have to pay if the destination is outside of the EU), adding international shipping, and converting from British pounds to US dollars, I paid about US$28.  That was nearly half the price offered by amazon.com at the time.  Amazon UK will offer you the chance to either pay in pounds or dollars; I paid in pounds, which after conversion to dollars by my credit card issuer was a bit cheaper than the US dollar price offered me by Amazon UK.

Be assured that the UK version is region-free and 1080p, contrary to statements I've read in some other reviews.

Note that the UK version comes with a fifth disc that contains two episodes of another BBC nature documentary, called ""Natural World""; I viewed a couple of chapters of the episode on lion re-introduction and while it was introduced with a Planet Earth title card and is narrated by Mr. Attenborough, it's as much about the man involved in the re-introduction project as it was about the lions themselves.",1274918400,3,1331,4.919642857142857

If you have recently upgraded your TV or your DVD player to blue-ray - This is the DVD set you want to fully appreciate your new purchase. And be sure to watch the ""diaries"" after you watch the movie; This is where you can see the lengths the photographers went to in order to obtain the footage they created. And I had thought it would be a fantastic job to be an nature photographer! Root canals would be preferable to what some of them went through.  There are a few scenes that are hard to watch-a lion pride taking down an elephant was particularly brutal. I'm not sure I'd want a young child watching it. But Nature being what it is; this was no fault of the BBC. They just happened to have the cameras there.
If you are reading this-I can assume you watch the Discovery channel, and National Geographic, and nature shows on PBS. In my opinion this is better than any program I've seen before.
I have two very inexpensive DVD players-standard and Blue-Ray. I also have both versions of Planet Earth, so i sycn'd them up and watched both using the HDMI on the remote and WOW!

You may not turn into an environmentalist after watching Planet Earth, but you cannot help but walk away with a greater respect and appreciation for the diversity that exists beyond the confines of our cities and suburbs.  Attenborough, as usual, adds a gravitas that is captivating without being stuffy.  The man could, and does, make watching grass grow exciting.

So that covers why *everyone* should see it.

Now if you have BluRay and an HDTV, it is truly required material. For all of the CGI, for all of the football and hockey I've seen... THIS is the material that shows off why BluRay and HDTV exist.

Watching the discs in my blu-ray player, the cinematography was still very good, and I remain uncertain if it is actually 1080i or p. However, researching the issue, I've read (on the internet...therefore it MUST be true) that all the boxes on the BBC Blu-Ray series from the UK are stamped 1080i but actually contain 1080p footage of the main program segments.  I've read the reason for the 1080i stamp is that there is some bonus footage that was recorded in 1080i and because this bonus footage is contained within the series, it was not 100% 1080p.  So the BBC opted to place 1080i on the outside of the box.

2742712,5,B000MR9D5E,"Taking a complicated order for a simple burger involves smorgasbord of holding this or extras on that when it comes to every tailored garnish? Well, here's the scoop on this 6-disc Special Edition blu-ray set, as the problem with distributors setting the final cut allows no a la carte freedom to pick and chose extras. After all, this IS another chance for distributors to double dip, like in any industry, music, movies, etc. a genealogy of remakes, re-mix edits, extended edition, director's cut, previously unreleased bonuses tracks, re-master, new cover art, all in the name of gouging consumers. Especially with blockbusters, and Planet Earth (PE) is no exception. Yes folks, as long as you buy into it, you've suckered up into their marketing ploy. It was all in their strategies from the very start. After all, companies hire a panel full time solely dedicated to all the nitty-gritty tactical ways in capitalizing the bottom line of $, every chance they get, AKA milking the system. What can you do? Really nothing. You are at their helm when the goods are dangled to you in tantalization, and your pavlovian response is beyond your control. But I'm sure as you're reading this, you're wondering if this set is worth it. So without further a due, let's see what you get, and whether or not you can beat the system to your advantage.

So here's the 411 scoop of accompaniments NEW to this 6-disc 2012 BD set that's NOT on the 2007 4-disc BD set, listed in the order of importance:

1) Diaries (bonus in disc 1-4), the 10-min making of clip following each of the 11 main features. Total of ~107 min in SD. Worthy to note, unlike the DVD version and other BBC nature diaries, which auto-plays the diaries immediately following the credits, here you do need to navigate back to the main menu to select these bonuses.

2) 3 new bonus documentaries (disc 6), total 150 min's:
a) Snow Leopards: Beyond the Myth 50 min in HD
b) Secrets of Maya Underworld 50 min in SD
c) Elephant Nomads of the Namib Desert 50 min in SD
-Note: the UK version contains Natural World - Desert Lions 50 min. Not sure why US version left this out. But lucky for US version, UK left out Maya Underworld and Elephants Nomads.

3) The Future (disc 5), 3 episodes in SD; total 3 hours:
a) Saving Species 60 min
b) Into the Wilderness 60 min
c) Living Together 60 min

4) Great PE moments (disc 4) 46 min in SD, narrated by Sir David the Great Attenborough himself.

5) Audio commentaries by producers, but only for 5 of the 11 main episodes: Pole to Pole, Mountains, Caves, Great Plains, Shallow Seas.

6) Music only viewing audio. This feature is a bust. Why in the world would you ever watch a documentary without a narrator? BTW, it's not really music only. The sound effects (water falling, animal sounds, etc.) are still tracked in. I guess they couldn't get rid of that. In my opinion any upgrade to the audio portion should have been to include the Sigourney Weaver (Discovery version) narration.

7) Sneak Peak at Frozen Planet (disc 6) 13 min's in HD. Oh great, more advertising :(. But this IS BBC's next big release following the Life and Human Planet series.

Technical issue: the transfer is 1080i. From my research regarding the ad nauseam debate of PE being i or p, the original cameras used to film this series were no better than 1080i, so that's the limiting step. Though some earlier 2007 BD packages states 1080p, and the signal to your TV indicates p, later releases of the 2007 version corrected this to say 1080i on the package. Considering this series was filmed over the course of the early 2000's, you really can't notch about this (it was the best they had then). The main feature is still reference quality by 2012 standards.  However, regarding the extras, for the most part, ALL the bonus features (with the exception of Snow Leopard and the Sneak Peak Frozen Planet which are clearly HD) are all in SD, and at best, an upscaled 720 clearly not full HD from my sharp 20/20 on my 65"" panny.

So back to the title of my review, can you beat the system to your advantage? Well, I'll tell you what I did. Ordered used (much cheaper, note: got mine for $22), tossed out the scarfed package (it's cheap cardboard anyways).  Bought a 6 disc blu-ray case (brand viva elite) for $2.50 from casetopia dot com, which BTW is the exact same size as the 4 disc case (15 mm thickness). Fit's perfectly into your old slip case. Successful upgrade. Donated the old version to a friend. Done.

Ultimately it's up to you, the well informed consumer to flip the switch or say screw you Mr. distributor leech. Everyone's economics and shelf space run the gamut to savvy your rations, like those must have fan boys. Still not sure?, here a logical final decision making:

-If you have both the dvd and original 2007 BD versions, no real need to upgrade unless you really need the bonus of Elephant Nomads.
-If you only have the Discovery US version of Sigourney Weaver narrating and want the original David Attenborough, then go for it.
-If you don't have the dvd version but only have original 2007 BD version, your upgrade will be solely for all those bonus extras, but keep in mind those extras are in standard def.
-If you don't have any copies of PE, this is a must own in every household for all ages. Starting with this Special Edition 6-disc version, you'd be skipping all other previous wasted versions.
-When it comes to double dipping, price of course is always an issue. Currently as of this writing, the price on Amazon is as follows: Amaz $35; MarketPlace $33; used $26.

To top it off, a globe limited edition (gift version) is also available. Contains the same materials, just the hardware/ packaging is different,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-Earth-Limited-Edition-Blu-ray/dp/B005C9YZKU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet Earth: Limited Edition [Blu-ray</a>]

Also, ordering it from here is quite a bit cheaper than picking up this exact same set from a retail store. My problem with it is that this particular version is one disc short of the full set available in the UK, and costs considerably more. In hindsight, I wish I had read more of the reviews, as I now feel a little ripped off, considering that I paid more for a truncated version of this fabulous series.

2742719,4,B000MR9D5E,"This disk is the 1080i version.

Amazon's product description doesn't say what resolution it is, Discovery Channel's site doesn't either, and no help from BBC's site (even after I emailed them).  If there's a 1080p version out there, I don't know about it.  I've watched more than half of it and (as far as I can tell) there are no behind-the-scenes footage.

You've probably heard raving reviews about Planet Earth already; it doesn't disappoint.  There are several scenes where the film is grainy and the resolution's not up to par for a 1080p screen but I understand that HD cameras weren't available everywhere.  The HD shots are incredible, almost surreal.  If you have surround sound or high quality headphones, some of the scenes have quite an impact.  This series is both beautiful and tough but I like that (candy-coating and censorship suck).  I've seen some of the Discovery Channel episodes but it was a while ago and I can't really say that David Attenborough is 'n' times better than Sigourney Weaver; however I don't have any trouble understanding him and his narration is good.  There's something nice about the BBC version, it's like I'm keepin' it real.

Conclusion: get it, you won't be disappointed except for the fact that you won't be able to see any 'making of' shots.  Really though, it's still great.",1269993600,2,1325,4.866071428571429

Really amazing stuff, a lot of footage that was captured I thought it didn't exist in wild life.  One of the best was the feeding frenzy in Alasakan summer of marine animals and also a Himalayan Cat chasing a pray around on steep mountain. And of course who could forget the slow motion footage of Great White attacking a seal.  I could go on and on about this beautifully captured documentary.  I was never a nature show kind of guy before this and I have to say this is a better reality show than American Idol.  Really got to give kudos to BBC and Discovery for producing such an gigantic production documentary.  This is an unbelievable achievement and camera work. Just jaw dropping stuff.

2742746,5,B000MR9D5E,"This BBC series on Planet Earth absolutely took my breath away!  A measly five stars don't do justice to this amazing series!  Narrated by David Attenborough, the naturalist (not to be confused with his older brother, Richard Attenborough of the Jurassic Park fame), every episode is educational, entertaining, and enlightening.  There are five discs in the box, each disc containing three 1-hour documentaries (except for disc 4, which contained only two.)  How the BBC photographers captured those incredible images are shown in the last 10 minutes of each segment.  It made me very glad that I wasn't the photographer walking around with my knees deep in the bat poop, or the photographer waiting patiently for 120 hours for ONE Bird of Paradise to dance, or any other amazing shots in this series!  If you haven't seen this series already, prepared to be dazzled.  This is our HOME planet!

So i was confused when i noticed the judder(a shaky, not-so-smooth look) on some scenes.  Now, for the 24p mode to work on my television, the film must be 1080p.  So i looked at the box and this product is 1080i, not 1080p.  I went to the store and found the same blu-ray for a lot more money than it's sold here on amazon, but it's 1080p at the stores!  So it looks like BBC makes this video in both 1080i and 1080p.  The one sold here is 1080i.

Reading some of the other reviews I realize that I don't have the special features footage, but I'm still rating this set as 5 stars, simply because it IS amazing, fantastic and wonderful, and I don't have to see the special features footage to recognize the talent that went into this production (although it would be nice!).

Also, I love the narrator's voice, the way he seems to be as awed and excited about the subject matter as I am. I do not have any problems hearing him or understanding what he's saying; everything is crisp, clear, and intelligible.

2742767,5,B000MR9D5E,Very good quality. I was a little disappointed because I seem to like the Discovery Channels remake of the information. They were very good programs and I guess I should have read a little more to see this was made by BBC instead of Discovery.

2742788,4,B000MR9D5E,"I saw this series when it first aired in the U.S. on A&E.  It was an amazing experience in HD, even with the relatively restricted bandwidth and high compression of HD cable.  On Blu Ray it is a revelation.  I enjoyed Sigourney Weaver's narration on the U.S. cut, but also liked Attenborough's original track here, while not having a strong preference for either.  I did like the additional footage seen in the BBC edit, which was lost to commericals when the show aired in the U.S.  This was one of my first Blu Ray purchases after I bought my Blu Ray player this past Thanksgiving and I've already watched it through a couple of times.  (It is a great set to share with others, not to mention showing off my system.)",1266796800,,718,4.442748091603053

2742791,3,B000MR9D5E,"I think my expectations were way too high. I expected some perfect picture quality and, at least, a normal regular sound quality.  Unfortunately, there are some issues with the Planet Earth.

The sound mix quality is the biggest problem and my family and I frequently had difficulties hearing the narrations behind the background sounds of animals, waterfalls, etc.

Also, the picture quality - at times - was low and full of visual artifacts.  I wasn't expecting this at all.

The movie isn't bad and will be of interest for many, but please be aware of the above limitations.",1266537600,,577,4.846938775510204
2742792,5,B000MR9D5E,"This was a gamble purchase of mine.  I purchased it on a whim. Mainly I based my purchase on what I read on the box. What a great gamble. The footage is titillating to the eyes and mind. Scenes like a shot of forty birds and the camera zooms out to four million birds.

I ended up watching this entire series in a weekend. Time well spent. It's great for children and students of all ages. Most of the time I watched it with my Step-daughter and we both enjoyed it. She's loves animals, so that worked out just perfect.

The series touches on just a few things things that our wildlife has to offer.  But the subjects are quite informative and visually stunning.  The first episode, ""Pole to Pole"", gives a slight preview on what's to come. Starting from the Artics to the tropics. Documenting some of the most intriguing animals and places our planet has to offer. It gives you a real appreciation for our planet's wildlife.

A must watch/purchase for any wildlife lovers. I'm currently on my fourth time watching it through.  Just can't get enoough of it. You remember or learn something new everytime.",1266537600,,1104,4.545454545454546
2742793,5,B000MR9D5E,"I've been watching Planet Earth on the Discovery HD Channel every time it's on, but Sigourney Weaver's dry narration put me off more and more each time.  So I finally broke down and bought this incredible documentary in the BBC High Definition set, and I'm sooooooo glad I did!  What a difference narration makes!  Sir David Attenborough breathes life into scenes that fizzle out with Sigourney Weaver; his empathy adds depth where her lack of the same distracts.  Suddenly I seem to be watching a whole new documentary, and what a treasure it is.

Okay, granted, I am a huge fan of Sir David Attenborough.  I have all his books, just about all his documentaries, and I can't wait for the blu-ray versions of ""Life of Mammals"" and ""Life of Birds"".  I'm terribly disappointed that ""The Private Life of Plants"" isn't available at all as of this writing, and I hope the BBC wakes up and remasters all Attenborough treasures in blu-ray to give them the treatment they deserve.

Reading other reviews and some of the comments, I have to add that I bought a blu-ray player just so I could get ""Planet Earth"", and I am now busily scouring Amazon.com for other top notch nature documentaries to add to this very special library.

I also have the regular DVD set, and I will keep it for its extras.

Sir David Attenborough, may you live another 100 years, since there is nobody else quite like you.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!",1266451200,8,1423,4.607142857142857

The photography is peerless, taking away the viewers' breath as it mounts the highest peaks, details the deepest oceans, lovingly records scenes from the planet we call home.

The discs will long be an integral part of your DVD discothque, brought out to renew your spirits, not just used to teach children, enthrall them with the bounty of their home planet, show them what television is capable of.

This is the true reality series, not those sad hours of watching pseudo-humans. It is worth waiting for your Blu-Ray player and big-screen HDTV to be installed - absolutely spellbinding.",1265932800,,780,5.038759689922481

Although, I became accustomed to and enjoyed Sigourney Weaver's narration I ended up buying the BBC Series version because the blu-ray is of superior quality. I researched this far and wide before I made my final purchase because I really wanted the Sigourney Weaver narration. However, I'm happy that I ended up buying the bbc series version because the picture quality is impeccable and the narrator (David Attenborough) is not half bad either. If you're trying to decide which version to buy, I'd recommend this one because picture quality is the entire reason you'd want Planet Earth on Blu-Ray in the first place.",1265846400,,780,4.916666666666667

You will not be disappointed. Give it to a young person who is interested in science or animals or to anyone who would like to to be blown away by some of the most beautiful and technically advance cinematography to date. The behind-the-scene featurettes at the end of each episode I found especially interesting.,1265760000,,463,4.658536585365853

2742837,5,B000MR9D5E,The footage is topnotch especially on an HD 1080p TV. David Attenborough pronounces things differently so you might get confused on what he's talking about. He also mentions some unrealistic numbers for time and animals.,1265587200,,220,5.314285714285714

Some mind-boggling scenes are in this series and I keep asking myself, ""where was the photographer"" when this was filmed, especially during some of the animal scenes.  How they filmed some of this still amazes me.  There are some slow-motions scenes that let you see how some things really happened when it happened so fast.
Our grown children and grandchildren have also enjoyed watching some of this with us.  If you like National Geographic or some of the Discovery nature programs, you will probably love this!  It's a LOT of great filming of a beautiful and fascinating world!",1265587200,,759,4.763358778625954

There are also other kinds of quality out there of the actual blu-ray.  From the reviews that I read, this was the best one.  I am happy with Planet Earth, and I gave it to my father for Christmas this year.  I would warn though, that this one is a four disc set.  My roommate has the normal DVD version (not blu-ray) and it has five discs in it.  The fifth disc is titled ""The Future"", and this version does not have that disc.  However, the run time of the dvd is the same as well, so ""The Future"" may have just been a bonus at the time for the normal DVD version.  I'm very happy with this purchas",1264982400,,756,4.08843537414966
2742877,5,B000MR9D5E,"I prefer not to do a review on the technicalities of this product, believing that trying to appreciate everything through technology and numbers is a degeneration, equivalent to evaluating a woman by her measurements or a man by his wealth. However, I am driven to do one because of the overwhelming misinformation found here. I do a thorough research before ordering anything. Please do your own at Highdefdigest and [...] instead of relying on information on the box. This series is in 1080p. Find the ""display"" button on your TV remote and press it to find out about the video output. Mine says 1080p. The 5-disc set is the UK version. To straighten things up, there are at least three blu-ray versions for Planet Earth:

1. The BBC UK version. Five discs and in 1080p. Contains all the episodes from Planet Earth with none of the extras found on the DVD. The fifth disc contains two episodes from ""Natural World"" series: i. Desert Lions; ii. Snow Leopard. These two episodes are in 1080i. Narrator: David Attenborough. This version is available on Amazon UK ([...]).

2. The BBC US version. Four discs and in 1080p. Contains all the episodes from Planet Earth with none of the extras found on the DVD. Narrator: David Attenborough. This version is available here.

3. The Discovery version. Four discs and in 1080i. Contains all the episodes from Planet Earth with none of the extras found on the DVD. Narrator: Sigourney Weaver. This version is available on the Discovery website.

I got the BBC UK version from Amazon UK. With the dwindling pound (one of the few currencies that is doing worse than the dollar), price plus shipping is actually cheaper than if you had got it here. Ebay has it but at a higher price. My experience is always do a price research before getting anything there. There is no reason for anyone to get the Discovery version unless they absolutely must have Sigourney Weaver as the narrator. 1080p, 1080i, is there a great difference? No, but there is a noticeable difference. My wife and I noted a venetian blind effect [look up ""interlaced"" at Wikipedia] when viewing fast action on interlaced video. If you have good eyes, woe to you, you're stuck with progressive or learn to appreciate the beauty of the picture instead of its quality.

Finally, the series itself. The picture quality isn't the best I have seen on blu-ray but it is easily the most beautiful picture I have ever seen on a TV. The story, mind you there is one here, is more moving and philosophical than any crafted by human. I am an atheist but there is a moral behind the story that is hard to put your fingers on. There are numerous killing and preying in this documentary but they are all part of a larger picture. The moral is that the world we live in is benevolent, generous, and life-giving. For every animal killed, more thrives and prospers. Every death sustains the continuity of life and cannot be viewed as a tragedy. We all die one day to become part of the great cycle. The series also make me feel guilty as a human being for being over obsessed with my material needs. If you find the killing for the purpose of feeding in Planet Earth cruel, how much crueler are people who indulge in wasteful consumerism? We kill millions of animals each day by destroying their habitat to feed ourselves fatter, to get a second TV a second car, to upgrade our computer, to dress ourselves prettier, to buy ourselves into deeper debt.

before they take any critical desicion about our earth and climate change,they must see what consequence a wrong desicion to ignore pollution will bring on the white bear in the north arctic that cant swim and find food cause the summer becomes longer and the ice melts sooner.
the consequence on the special cat on the himmalayas who cant find food and will extinct.
and all those magical jungles and forest that brings alot of oxygen to the atmosphere and BEAUTYNESS to our planet.

rather then only buying this amazing series,we also MUST elect the right leaders who will watch this series,take earth close to their HEART and think TWICE about doing what's right for our earth and not care only about their CHAIRS in the parliament and government in their countries!

My bottom line is-this series is a MUST BUYING for all viewers out there on earth and THE LEADERS of all the G8 countries and all other countries,rich or poor. leaders must see this series OVER AND OVER again like a BRAIN WASH in every climate summit.

From the strange to the beautiful, Planet Earth can teach you about our natural world very effectively.
Perhaps more important is the video. This is THE definitive Blu-Ray work in my collection. In fact, if I want to show off what HD can accomplish to non-believers, I bring out Planet Earth. It will wow you just as much as the exotic locations do. I do not know how they mastered it so well, but it is completely worth the extra money for BluRay.

2742933,5,B000MR9D5E,"If anyone in your house loves nature, wildlife or the outdoors you simply MUST get this series.  It is beyond astonishing.

I grew up watching Disney documentaries like ""The Vanishing Prairie"" which included amazing footage of prairie dogs and buffaloes and sidewinders.  A few years ago my attention was captured by ""March of the Penguins"".  I was amazed not only by the year-long story of the Emperor Penguins living their life-cycle in the most harsh climate on earth, but also by the film crews who braved the same climate to shoot the footage.

Now we have this series and it is huge.  ""Planet Earth"" is to ""March of the Penguins"" what the Space Shuttle is to a paper airplane.  Okay - I'm exaggerating... but only a little.

A host of intrepid, experienced and well-financed film crews were dispatched over a five year period to collect this footage.  We see Emperor Penguins huddling over their eggs in Antarctica, Cranes in their life or death struggling migratory flight over Mount Everest, huge herds of migrating caribou and elephants, mating dances of exotic birds, and endless varieties of predator and prey.  Speaking of - thought should be given to the context of viewing for the young and tender-hearted.  For those who might cry when Bambi's mother is shot - off-screen - it may be quite traumatic to see wolves and cheetah and hyena successfully corralling deer, or little seal fins protruding from the gaping maws of breeching great white sharks.  It may be the perfect introduction of the budding naturalist to the ""circle of life"" or food chain or however you wish to introduce these scenes.

But the footage - oh my - absolutely takes your BREATH away.  The flora and fauna of the earth are filmed in breathtaking natural surroundings.  Helicopter borne cameras zoom across waterfalls and savannahs.  Intimate moments with some of the rarest creatures on earth are mesmerizing: birds of paradise perform their cirque du soleil mating dances and the nearly extinct snow leopard is caught high above the tree line in titanic Asian mountain ranges.

Disney edited this series into their recent ""Earth"", but the truth is that all 11 episodes are astonishing, and for less than twice the cost, you get more than 5 times more of this amazing series.

The scope of the project is titanic: I don't expect another nature documentary this expansive and well-produced for decades.  Come one - come all.  You will see things that you never thought you'd see, may never see again, and will never forget.",1264291200,,2512,4.879716981132075

2742945,1,B000MR9D5E,"Just in case, my 2 star rate is exclusively for the Blu-Ray product.

The Blu-Ray boxset comes with 4 discs that contains the 11 episodes that encompasses the complete series of planet earth.
If i had to rate the visual content of this series is 5 stars all the way, hands down.

As many other reviews, my discontent is the omission of special features.

I had a friend that lend me his planet earth DVD boxset and I just finished watching the bonus feature The Future which has 3 episodes: Saving Species, Into the Wilderness and Living Together each almost an hour length.  In a nutshell, this amazing documentary is very informative and brings powerful ecological issues from very well educated people. Many of the concerns are going to be dealt directly by you and me, we need this education...why did they not include such an important documentary in the Blu Ray version!!

In a way I know the answer, I've seen how it works.  I've been collecting movies since late 90's: I've bought DVD's that I had VHS versions before, I experienced the WB larger DVD's cases that were later changed for the standard size cases, or the ""flip side"" movies (first version of Goodfellas, Sleepers, A Time to Kill), the Special Editions, Limited Editions, Ultimate Editions, etc etc...believe me, I've done my share.  Now seeing the same pattern in the Blu Rays discs (where ""lack of space"" is not an excuse) is really irritating.

It is a shame that this highly praised series (with their sophisticated message and the contribution to the appreciation/ preservation to the environment) fell in the industry abusive discipline in continuing exploiting the customers pockets...for me is somewhat contradictory to the essence of the series.

Don't be surprise when people decide to copy a special feature disc like this one, or should they sit and wait for the super mega edition boxset! Instead of spending millions in marketing for anti-piracy campaigns, concentrate in your loyal customers by making the most complete and comprehensive possible product in the original date of release.

Thanks for reading this.

UPDATE (January 27th): now that I saw the 10 minute behind the scenes on EACH episode on the DVD boxset I'm really pissed...this is amazing footage that was completely cut out from the Blu-Ray as well. Get this: these behind the scenes are an extra chapter (last chapter) within each episode which means they deliberately took them out for the blu-ray edition (as well as taking out the 5th disc - special feature the future)...que cojones man!!!

The material was interesting, exciting and beautifully filmed. It was hard to pace ourselves and not finish the boxset within just a few days, although we will definitely be watching the series again and again.

This documentary is moving and makes you look at our amazing planet in a new and different way. You will see animals, many of them rare, doing things never caught on film before. Sometimes this took the film crew several weeks or more to capture. They were very passionate and dedicated to the series and it was fun to watch them at work in the ""Dairies"" section after each episode. I now want to share this with the rest of my family because I know they will enjoy it too. For those who have children, it would be an excellent way to educate while entertaining.

We have a horribly outdated television set, but the picture was still amazing. My only gripe was in the first episode, I had a hard time hearing David Attenborough's narration over the loud music and had to turn on the subtitles. I do not think this is any fault in the program, it's probably just the pathetic speakers on our hand-me-down TV.

2742981,4,B000MR9D5E,"This has to be among the best nature documentaries ever filmed.  The multi-part series takes you around the globe to places you likely will never visit and animals you otherwise would never see outside of a zoo.  The footage the videographers captured is simply awe-inspiring.

Originally, I purchased the DVD version.  I enjoyed it very much, but the video quality was somewhat subpar when upscaled on my HDTV.  Eventually, I picked up the blu-ray version with the intent of selling my DVD set.  The blu-ray looks magnificent; one of the greatest transfers I've seen.  This is clearly the way the filmmakers intended the series to be watched, as they used HD cameras to capture most, if not all, of the footage.

However, I now find that I cannot sell my DVD set because all the wonderful extras on the DVD, including an extra disc with a bonus three-part documentary is missing from the blu-ray version.  The blu-ray contains no special features.  Zip.  On the DVD, at the end of each segment, the filmmakers included a 10 minute ""how they filmed a scene"" piece, which I found fascinating to watch, as it showed the difficulties they encountered in capturing some of the most amazing footage.  This is noticeably absent from the blu-ray set and really shouldn't have been, even if they just included the special features in standard definition.  I've subtracted a star for this.

If you already have the DVD and have a decent sized HDTV, I think the upgrade in visual quality is worth the price, but hold on to your old set for the extras.  If you have neither version, I would recommend the blu-ray set over the DVD because, although it lacks the special features, the video quality has to be seen to be believed.

The series is great for any adult, and most kids above, say, age 7.  True to nature, there is some violence and death.

One caveat.  If you believe the Amazon product page and photos, you might be expecting a 5-disk set, presented in 1080p.  What you get is a 4-disk set in 1080i.  It may prove a bit disappointing for you too.",1262995200,,571,4.127272727272727

Regarding the video format, on the cover of the BBC version it says 1080i. But when I started playing my HDTV recognized the video as 1080p.

2743044,5,B000MR9D5E,I had just purchase a blu ray dvd player and a hi def TV. Upon doing so I was told to get the DVD planet earth and it will show off my new equipment. I am impressed with my new purchases and also the DVD Planet Earth. It is remarkable. I don't know how they filmed it. I could watch it over and over. It is just like being there.,1261958400,,329,3.7142857142857144
2743045,1,B000MR9D5E,"So after reading these reviews I now know i'm not the only one with some of the problems.  The biggest problem with this BluRay set is the sound quality.  The volume range on my TV goes from 1-100.  I watch tv at around a 20-25.  These disks require 50-60 on the volume scale and I still have trouble understanding this british guy.  I really don't know if it's his voice, the way he emphasizes different syllabels b/c of his accent, or if his voice just isn't loud enough over the background sound... but something about it is very frustrating.  I find my eyes are completely loving the graphics, while my ears are straining to hear his voice and understand the commentary.  I really did like the woman and the US version more.  By reading these reviews you will soon see you are not alone.

The other HUGE downside of this series is you don't get the extra material explaining the filming of the scenes.  30% of this series to me was hearing about these crazy cameramen that went in hot air balloons, sat in -100 degree weather for weeks, sat in huts for months not seeing anything, etc...  It was truly amazing to hear about how they got all this footage.  It was years of work, that this series just decided all that didn't make the cut?  Well, I'm dissapointed.  In my oppinion it really must have come down to $$$$ b/c this was a great part of the series

Also, lets put the whole debate of 1080i vs 1080p to bed.  The difference her would be minimal at best for viewing quality.  The series was shot in 1080i, and could not be produced (even on blu-ray) in 1080p.  The confusion hear was created by a misprint on some of these DVD sets where on the pack it said 1080p.  This was a mistake, and has been corrected on all new packaged copies.  (This explanation comes directly from BBC)  The resolution is still STUNNING, with the shots from space being absolutely fantastic.  If you are new to blu-ray and need a one to show off, I still believe this is the DVD set for you.  The shots are stunning, and truly show the capability of bluray.  (AMAZON: just take the 1080p out of the description, tags on reviews, and in the tag suggestions.  It is misleading and could be considered false advertising to people that make their purchase decission based on this stated fact.)  Consider getting the US version though if you liked the extra footage along with the womans voice and commentating sound quality.  If i had the choice to do it again, I would definitely get the US version even if it's a little more expensive.

There is ONE advantage to this Blu-Ray set, and that is if you are used to watching the US version there is small amounts of extra footage embeded in every episode.  This is bc the BBC version has each episode being longer, and this required more footage.  It definitely doesn't make up for the lack of bonus footage, but is a tiny morsel of something good that came out of the BBC Blu-Ray series.  Happy viewings!",1261958400,42,2938,4.4456928838951315

2743069,3,B000MR9D5E,"[I added updates and further details to the bottom half of this review due to requests that I offer proof to my claims.]

If I offered a rating after one viewing, I would have said 5 stars without hesitation. However, after a careful second viewing, I have become disenchanted.

The video of the snow leopards was one of the most remarkable components of the entire series. However, BBC added fake snow to this video, presumably to make the final snow leopard scenes more dramatic. For those of you who have the series, please verify the fake snow for yourself***. To my knowledge, no one else has noted this fabrication... either in Amazon reviews or anywhere online. It is sad that BBC fabricated a part of this video. This series is about nature, not Hollywood special effects. This prompts two questions:

(1) What other special effects have been added by BBC that we have yet to notice?

(2) Are the story lines real? That is, did BBC simply take a lot of video footage and then make up the animal story lines for each part like many other nature videos?

My comments regard the authenticity and honesty of the construction of Planet Earth. My enthusiasm for the series has been tempered and I now watch it with a vigilant and skeptical eye. While I still enjoy the series greatly (plenty of other reviews explain why), it has lost much of the magic that made it so unique.

*** View Disc 1, Episode 2 (Mountains), starting at time 31:26. The snow in the first part of the snow leopard part appears to be real. However, the last couple minutes with the snow leopard part has fake snow added after-the-fact. [Update with more detailed evidence below.]

- - -

12/30/09 Update: Reply to ""... Please get some proof or solid evidence..."" in comments. (For those curious, current review rating: 1 of 7.)

The proof I provide is the video: it is self-evident that it is fake.

Detailed evidence:
(1) The snow is thick and heavy in the ""fake snow"" scene.
(2) The light snow in previous scenes built up in a layer on the ground and animals.
(3) There is no snow accumulation on the ground or animals in the heavier snow, i.e. where the snow was added as a special effect.
(4) Near the end of the scene I describe, the snow is so heavy it becomes difficult to see the animals, yet there is still ZERO accumulation on the animals or ground.
(5) The special effect snow is added in three ""layers"". Often times at least two layers fall at the same speed, which cannot occur naturally (since they would be presumably at different distances from the camera).

For those of you who do view this part of the video with a critical eye and disagree, I welcome any criticisms of the points above.",1261353600,,2682,4.532091097308489

2743089,5,B000MR9D5E,"Planet Earth is an amazing ten part documentary about the wondrous pristine natural world, some of which focus on creatures and places that had never been captured on camera before. I loved all ten parts, each on a distict type of environment of the planet. Surprisingly my favorite of them was the one on deserts (not an area I had been particularly interested in in the past), with its jumping lizards and head-butting antelopes and the swarm of locusts which looks likes a massive ring of smoke from afar but comes off terrifying clos up. Some of my favorites items from other parts include the amazing slow motion shots of Great White Sharks hunting seals on the part on shallow seas, and the rare Snow Leopard chasing its prey down steep dangerous rocky slopes on the Mountains episode. There's too much great, fascinating and exciting stuff for me to describe, and since I purchased the set I've watched each part at least twice. Also on the DVD version are three additional documentaries on the future of this planet, and they in my opinion aren't near as fascinating as the main stuff but are still well worth watching.

I bought the DVD version, and while it doesn't take full effect of the special HD cameras used, it looks as detailed and crisp as any DVD I have ever seen.

NO...it is MUCH sharper! I can see little, if any, difference between these BBC blu ray productions and a true 1080p blu ray disc. I don't know if it is the ""enhancement"" process or whatever. I am not an technical engineer for this science. All I do know is that the picture is MUCH sharper than anything you will see over the Discovery channel on your HDTV. All these productions are wonderful! Yet my wife (and kids) totally disagree with me: even though my wife is a true animal lover, she cannot watch these DVDs...she cannot watch the essential need to eat: the need for one animal to kill and eat another animal. These productions are chock full of this natural process of survival. However, if this is a problem for you to watch, here is something you might want to know: Ganges, the series about India, has absolutely NO animals killing other animals for survival.

The footage they got! The charming, cute, and spooky animals! Even the ""topic areas"" that I thought would be of less interest to me, say, the fresh water one made me retrospectively feel silly for even trying to choose an area I thought would be the coolest. The BBC team really captured some unique moments and I love the combination of aerial, underwater, and ground level shots. The variety of animals they managed to film is truly incredible. I agree with the reviewers who say that this is the kind of treasure that children should all get to watch- it really inspires a sense of wonder about the world that I'd love to share with someone younger than me. That said, I've watched it with family of all ages on my brother-in-law's amazingly large TV and it was, dare I say, better than being in an iMax theater. On my own more modest HDTV I am still enchanted and could watch this repeatedly- hence buying a copy. I think the most enchanted of all of us was the oldest- my father in law, who marveled over what technology can do now.

The current price makes it a great Christmas present buy, and I'm recommending it as such to everyone I know with a Blu-Ray player (I can't imagine it being as cool in just DVD, though I am tempted to snag a copy for my father and find out.)

Some highlights- the astounding waterfalls, the white birds against the blue and green earth as seen from the sky, bears swimming underwater, a panda munching bamboo, the tropical birds dancing, huddling penguins, baby polar bear cubs etc etc.
Can't say enough good things, really. They spared no expense and gave me an experience of the world that is utterly different from what I know. I'm so glad that someone captured this world, as I fear it is vanishing rapidly, and at the least it's always changing.",1260057600,2,1947,4.56

My friend who has the DVD set kept telling me about the cool behind the scenes where they show how they got the footage, so I was expecting that when I got the Blu-Ray set.  Boy was I surprised!  Why wouldn't you include it BBC?  It was a big disappointment.  I could have just downloaded the HD versions from the internet and, not including the Blu-Ray menus, it would have been pretty much the same.  The extras are what make buying the actual set worth it (apart from a clear conscience).

This is region free so I opted to buy it at Amazon.

Anyway this product came nicely packed and it has one blue ray box that contains 4 Blue ray disks. My wife fell in love with the box itself..

Outer box was made of recycled material which is a very good sign.

I wanted these disks purely as a collectors item.

The Box says 1080i NOT 1080p - I wish it were 1080p but anyways... till they give that out.. I am fine with this.

I was going mainly from the huge number of positive reviews that had been registered. Incredible! I sat down with the intention of just watching a short portion until I had more time. I was immediately transported into a very unexpected escape... completely drawn into the screen. I watched the whole series that same day. I have since watched it again with friends.

2743184,4,B000MR9D5E,"Most people break their reviews of this product down in 2 parts, picture and content.  I think this dvd has been praised very highly due to both but even more so concerning picture quality.  It is extremely popular for ""Jaw-dropping"" detail, visually.

The content is great and yes, the narration is superb.  Sounds like he should be narrating Lord of the Rings or something.  Very, very interesting so far.  I have viewed a disc and a half so far.  I will update when I finish watching.  The exploration is fantastic (most shots are by helicopter it seems)and the history is splendid.  I am learning so much.  It is very much about the history and learning about the world.  I love the strange and bizarre creatures that I never knew existed.  So far, the animal ""hunts"" are very tastefully done.  I am not a fan of seeing animals suffer (even though it is nature).  Just the knowledge and experience alone is well worth this package.

The picture I found to be slightly disappointing.  It is recorded in 1080I.  Being a Blu-Ray, I expected 1080p. Expect the detail to be exactly like watching this on Hi-def tv broadcasting (on Discovery channel or something).  There is some grain here and there, and from what I have been experiencing lately with a lot of Blu-Ray's, is that the detail is subject to light.  In dark scenes the picture will look average with some grain and blurriness, meanwhile with scenes of natural sunlight the detail will be incredible.  Every now and then there are scenes with great lighting and detail that make me go ""Wow"".  But it is not uniformly throughout the entire dvd.  Your not going to be sitting down the whole time with your mouth open.  More of like an open-closing sort of thing.

Another thing I noticed was the contrast flickering.  In some episodes the contrast seems to go in and out like a pulsing set to every second.  I noticed this in dark scenes and found it to be VERY distracting.  I haven't checked other reviews for this, but I find this extremely unacceptable.

For what it is worth, it is a good buy.

2743204,5,B000MR9D5E,"We saw one episode of this BBC produced series on the Discovery channel several months ago and we were sold. This series is a beautifully depicted narration on the wonderful planet we call home. The documentary is filmed almost exclusively in High Definition and the cinematography is simply stunning in Blu-ray.
We are using a 1080p 120Hz Toshiba Regza as our reference and the picture quality is at times breathtaking. The producers went to great lengths to capture amazing images of the entire planet and just watching the scenery alone is worth the price of this set. There is one shot taken as they flew over Victoria falls that almost makes you feel like you are soaring over the falls on your own personal set of wings.
While the Discovery Channel series is narrated by Sigourney Weaver and the Disney edited version is done by James Earl Jones; this original series is narrated by David Attenborough with the BBC and he is by far the best of the three. The only issues I had with the physical Blu-ray discs is that Mr. Attenborough's voice is slightly hard to hear over the higher volume musical scores and scenery sounds.
This set comes in a nice box for display and has 4 discs inside. The length is approximately 550 minutes and is divided into 50 minute themed segments.
I should also note that there are a few references (maybe 4 or 5) to evolution and global warming for those of you who may have issues with these types of views. However, the focus is not on politics or religion, rather the main focus is on our amazing planet and I do not believe the commentaries would be offensive to anyone who is solid in their own beliefs. In my opinion the stunning imagery reinforces the ideas of creation by design and the entire series would be an excellent educational resource for any type of school or home.
The wonder and awesomeness of this planet really shines in this series and I highly recommend it.",1255996800,5,1917,4.608187134502924

It is incredible how vast, beautiful, intricate and varied the creatures and landscapes of our planet are. The thing that disturbed me about the video series is its unscientific talk of millions of years and the possible origin of places and species without any conclusive scientific evidence. The vastness, beauty, intricate and varied nature of this world's creatures and habitat are a powerful witness to an Awesome Creator God. I missed the praise of the Creator of the Universe in this series. For God alone is worthy to receive all honour and praise.

Most of the images are of places or things i had never seen before, the episode that I was most amazed is Caves. Such a bizarre an alien world, in our planet.
It is a fresh new view of all the things that are around us and we must take care of.
The only thing I was not so happy with, is a couple of images that were misplaced. In the chapter of the Himalayas there is a night video of Torres del Paine National Park in Chile, that is halfway around the world. And in the part that Torres del Paine is shown, two scenes are flipped horizontally, so I start to doubt a little bit about every other place in the planet, if it's shown as it is, or this new ""poin of view"".

My kids, then in middle school, loved every minute. My husband and I were also surprised at how much we enjoyed each episode. I had thought I would knit while watching, but my knitting needles sat idle through the first episode and I never bothered taking them out for rest of the series.

The footage is stunning and David Attenborough's narration is superb. Not only did we all enjoy watching the DVDs, but they prompted lively discussion afterward.

The pacing is great. It doesn't get bogged down with any of its subjects, and moves satisfyingly to follow the theme of the episode (eg. ""fresh water,"" ""mountains,"" ""desert,"" etc.).

The content is surprisingly original. You would think you've seen every nature show there is to see... But they manage to find new, unique creatures (often never-before-photographed).

Overall, it is enthralling, breathtaking, and deeply stirring.

How they made it (and how they're recooping the costs of making it) is beyond me. In fact my only complaint is that it could use another disk with more making-of features. Get a good price for it, and you won't regret it.",1254700800,,939,5.281879194630872
2743248,4,B000MR9D5E,"Planet Earth is a mammoth undertaking of a series and the end product is one of the most fitting contributions to the High Def format in home viewing.

The BBC documentary stretches some 10 hours of perfectly captured life on this planet.  Every one of the stunning visuals has nuance and interest.  There are almost no stupid quick cuts found in 99% of all tv or movies these days.  This is 10 hours you can really soak in.  David Attenborough has a soft guiding voice through the depths and heights of our journey and the audio too fares well on my surround sound.

While the Blu-Ray is curiously missing the extras found on the DVD set, the only real criticism you can levy at Planet Earth is the lack of a larger narrative scope belying the overall epic vision.  Instead of participants in the world we are presented, the viewer is left as a bit of a tourist.

But in the end the series is what it is and how much can you really criticize 10 hours of continuous beauty?  This is a must own.",1254700800,,994,4.3297297297297295

I can only imagine what this series would look like on a Blu-ray DVD player and a much larger 1080i TV.  Having stated this, however, the video quality of this DVD set is just fabulous!  The details of the images of nature documented are stunning.  (So I suppose that ""awesome"" isn't the only adjective one could use!)  This documentary took five years and 40 cameramen to produce.  It was shot on 200 locations, from the highest mountaintops, to the deepest oceans, and everywhere in between.  It documents creatures and places the likes of which few, if any, have seen before.  This documentary is Evolutionary-based.  However, if one doesn't believe in this theory, as is the case with myself, just take some of what you hear with a grain of salt, sit back, and just enjoy the scenery! It's worth having to hear the Evolutionary ideas, if only to see the stunning visuals!  And the Theory of Evolution is by no means ""pushed"" in this documentary.

David Attenborough is the perfect narrator (much better than Sigourney Weaver on the Discovery edition), and I honestly think there should be a law requiring all nature documentaries to be narrated by him. Earth: The Biography is also a wonderful series, though arguably not as good as Planet Earth.

I watched in on HD Cable when it first came out, and every time I pull out my Blue Ray DVDs and watch an episode, my breath still catches in my throat.  It is simply magnificent footage.  And you do not need to be a nature video lover to appreciate it.  I normally have absolutely no use for nature shows, but the time and care and effort that went into this project was so incredibly painstaking, they have created a masterpiece to be enjoyed for generations to come.  They have captured quiet, private moments of peace, joy and sorrow as well as heart-racing moments of predatorial instinct and struggle that define the  massive span of wildlife on our seven continents. Many of these moments were never captured on video until now. The thoughtful editing and interesting behind the scenes footage round out this beautiful series. I have the version that is narrated by Sigourney Weaver that I purchased directly from the Discovery website, and I purchased the version narrated by Sir David Attenborough for my Dad though Amazon.

I just didn't enjoy that material and I would not permit my grandchild to watch it. Then, once the killing sprees were over I found myself literally watching the grass (lands) growing in time lapse photography.

This film contained scene after scene of animal violence (edited, granted) and then placid scenes of watching the grass grow. I don't think this movie is what everyone cracks it up to be and I think they are being overly impressed by the ultra-clear picture, not the content. Anyhow, that's my opinion.

Yes, the full, sharp HD we expect is not always there simply due to fact that some of it was shot in low-light conditions and in many cases with telephoto lenses but those moments are few. The only, and I mean the ONLY complaint I have about the Blu-ray version of Planet Earth is that it lacks the bonus programs that the DVD version has; namely, on the DVD release, each episode is accompanied by its own behind-the-scenes short called ""Planet Earth Diaries."" Those shorts have not been included in either the HD-DVD or the Blu-ray releases (probably because they were all shot in standard definition). The DVD release also includes the 3-part series ""Planet Earth: The Future"" which is not present in either HD version.

I actually bought the DVD version first so I have the extra content, but since I now have a 47-inch 1080p unit I have bought it again in HD. And it is too much hassle to swap out the Blu-ray for the DVD when a given episode is over just to watch a 10-minute behind-the-scenes short.

GALAPAGOS = 4-Star Blu-Ray Video / 2-Star Nature Doc

The video is good, but not great like a pristine movie transfer like Sin City or Kung-Fu Panda. I found this nature doc particularly boring. It has a few nice bits, but there's lots of repetition of shots, and wildlife just isn't as interesting as the other docs. I would only reccomend this if you're super super super interesting in learning about Galapagos.

GANGES = 4-Star Blu-ray Video / 3-Star Nature Doc

Video quality is about the same as Galapagos, good, but there's a lot better. This nature doc is a lot more interesting than Galapagos, more magic shots, better tid bits, a more emotional experience. This is worth checking out for the content.

PLANET EARTH = 4.5-Star Blu-ray Video / 4-Star Nature Doc

This is a fantastic video transfer, better than Galapagos and Ganges. By better, I mean, richer blacks, deeper colors, sharper detail. All around, a step up. This is a four disc experience. I think they put all their best content on the first disc. Seriously, the first disc was thrilling, the others were a huge step down, in terms of locations and wildlife. Maybe it's a weird personal preference thing, but I watched the first disc three times, but could barely get through the others. I would say disc one is a must see.

BARAKA = 5-Star Blu-ray Video / 5-Star Nature Doc

This wins the Super Shiny Titanium Standard Award for best video and best nature doc. It was shot on 70mm and transfered to, like, quad-HD digital. This is one of the very best blu-rays ever made. It holds up against all new releases, because the source was 70mm. And this nature doc seemed the most magical. If you want to get a good demo disc, to show to any audience, this is the one. And the Baraka experience sticks with you. I can see myself watching this quite a few times in the years ahead, just for the experience.",1250208000,,2098,4.576
2743368,4,B000MR9D5E,"I loved the series when it first came out on TV in the US on the Discovery Channel. AMAZING! It's hands down the best nature show ever. EVER! And that was in standard definition. On Blu-ray, it's so much better!

Anyway, I would have given it 5 stars, but this version available on Amazon.com is the original BBC version narrated by David Attenborough. I prefer the Discovery Channel version narrated by Sigourney Weaver. The main feature of each version is identical, except for the narration. If you watched this on the Discovery Channel in the US and liked Sigourney Weaver's narration, you should consider passing on this one and getting the Discovery Channel version instead. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, Amazon.com doesn't carry the Discovery Channel version. Amazon.com should carry both versions on Blu-ray. Or better yet, the makers should take advantage of existing DVD technology and have both versions on the same DVD, with the viewer able to change the narrator via the DVD's audio preferences menu.

BTW, the Discovery Channel/Sigourney Weaver version on Blu-ray includes behind the scenes footage (which the original BBC/David Attenborough version on Blu-ray on Amazon.com apparently doesn't have). I don't know if it's all the extra content that the standard DVDs have, but it has the following:

2743386,5,B000MR9D5E,"One great aspect of the beauty of nature is at least, in viewing.  The better the quality the greater the experience.

I own the DVD version and just bought the BD version.  I have seen in true life, a modicum of some of the items shown on this show:  I've dove with whale and other pelagic sharks in pristine waters, been in underwater caves, been in planes high enough to see great swats of the  south American continent, the pacific and a few others.  What you see on these BD disks is closer to real life than the DVD.  A problem at times is footage itself, some are highly telescopic, some were not the best conditions for photography or possibly the camera itself ... such as the ultra fast slow motion shots of the great white shark.  Many shots rival IMAX quality.  As a nature buff, these videos bring me back to places I love, and have put on my list to visit.  If you can't be there, BD is a good home substitute, no expedition to the Yucatan or the deep oceans will cost you $50, and few can have an IMAX screen in their living rooms.

I do agree with many reviewer comments than these disks contain less critical material than the DVD version, but its clear to me the BD version is far better than an  upconverted DVD version.  I compared them side by side, switch between playing DVD disks in my BD player or my DVD player; in resolution only IMAX or true life seems better than the BD.",1248393600,,1400,4.277566539923955

There were a couple that were a little slow for me; the Plains and the Forests weren't as interesting as the Deep Sea and Poles were, but all were worth watching. Some of the shots are incredibly memorable even months later - the great white whale jumping out of the sea, the pod of whales creating a circular bubble, the snow leopard hunting, the pack of tigers taking down an elephant, the hibernating polar bears waking up in the spring, the amazing Bird of Paradise, and many many more.

The Blu-Ray release is a bit disappointing as it doesn't include the behind the scenes footage and it also only includes the original narration by David Attenborough. With the space available on Blu-Ray I find this unacceptable!

Considering that Blu-Ray is pushing to be top dog in the video market, you would think they would want to include some enticing features and they have dropped the ball here somewhat. This release should have included the behind the scenes footage and both versions of the narrative. .....why not?

On the plus side picture and sound are breathtaking and it's a shame that I have to choose between a better looking set and a set with better features! I have recently bought a Blu-Ray player, but I'm not finding many stellar releases to purchase.

The photography is very sweeping and it's a relief to realize that 'such places still exist' on the Earth. David Attenborough's style of narration is very easy on the ears and he brings the series alive. It's good to watch this on the largest screen possible.

The ""Diaries"" which come after each episode are a delight (these are missing in the HD/Bluray versions is what some reviewers have mentioned, that's a shame)

I have a feeling money-grubbing BBC executives are to blame because the last disk is only half full and plenty of room to include this footage (if added cost for an extra disk was an issue).

However, I was very disappointed to find out that this particular product does not have ANY behind the scenes footage or special features. The behind the scenes footage is important to me because it brings the whole series to life.

2743459,4,B000MR9D5E,"There's not much more I can say - this is a beautiful documentary. Each episode follows a different ecosystem (forests, oceans, etc.). The producers have taken care to find interesting and new wildlife in each, not simply filming the familiar suspects from wildlife documentaries in blu-ray quality. There are some extraordinary memorable moments, such as a bunch of baby ducklings jumping out of a tree and bouncing in leaves.

My only complaint with the series is that each episode follows ecosystems rather than continents. This means the same episode (""Grasslands"") covers wildebeest in East Africa, antelope in Central Asia, yak in the Himalayas, and caribou in North America. This means each episode jumps around the world and tends not to spend much time in any particular place. This can also become confusing if you don't pay attention to where the scene is at a particular moment. I personally prefer viewing an episode about a particular region and learning more about it.

The new movie ""Earth,"" which uses much of the same video, does a much better job of creating a compelling story that captivates the audience. The BBC series ""Planet Earth"" feels too much like a documentary. It would be a great reference collection for school-age kids, but it won't captivate them like ""Earth"" will.",1241136000,,466,5.144736842105263

I tried to play it on my Portable DVD player just to see if there may be something else going on with the player in my entertainment unit. I tested a couple of other DVDs that I had in my collection thinking maybe it was the DVDs after all and not my player.  Everything else I put in had worked just fine.

2743655,5,B000MR9D5E,"I'm not exaggerate when I say that the mere existence of this program should be considered reason enough to buy a Blu-ray player and a TV that will showcase every last pixel.  From incredible vistas to the small, private moments of the tiniest creatures, the colors and sights never fall short of amazing.  Its imagery is so astonishing even those who shy away from Animal Planet and PBS will be totally riveted.  The Episodes ""Caves"" and ""Deep Sea"" are personal favorites.

This version has David Attenborough's original British narration, which I prefer to the American TV version with Sigourney Weaver, but I suppose it is a matter of personal preference.

I previously owned the DVD set of Planet Earth, and, as others have mentioned, the Blu-ray is missing an interesting series of making-of featurettes about the crew who filmed this remarkable program, as well as Planet Earth: The Future, a bonus episode.

2743693,5,B000MR9D5E,Planet Earth is a very amazing documentary. I learned a lot of new things about the natural world that I would have never imagined. If I had not seen this series I would have never known of the Amurian Leopard which is almost extinct. It also made me think about how threatened the natural world is. I would add a lot more but since all previous reviews already stated the many good things about these series I can just recommend it to everyone.,1239235200,,445,4.373493975903615

2743735,5,B000MR9D5E,"The Planet Earth series is a must for everyone. The blue ray version is more jaw dropping than anyone can imagine.  So many rare things that were never filmed before come alive. From the driest deserts to the highest mountains and the oceans as well, Planet Earth shows off plant and animal life like never before. How certain areas are transformed from winter to summer is truly amazing.",1239148800,,388,4.705882352941177

Planet Earth is simply amazing... stunning images and talk about being in the right place at the right time (or waiting for the right time)!  To imagine all of what they caught on film is merely a glimpse of the amazing phenomenon that is life on our planet!  What will they come up with next...?  And as a side note, I prefer David Attenborough's naration to Sigourney Weaver's; his voice adds to the excitement of what you're seeing.",1239148800,,501,4.472527472527473

This series does evolve in some ways from those predecessors.  The footage is very clear, whethr on DVD or espescially Blu-ray.  They cover animals not covered in the previous series, but they also cover what I refer to as ""Life of Earth"" - the various biomes and features are startlingly captured.  David Attenborgough narrates again, but you never see him.  What you see is quite amazing.",1239062400,,555,4.680412371134021

I never saw them before and watched them with him and I was shocked how good they were. We watch alot of the discovery channel and informative programs so this was perfect for us.  It was entertaining and informative.  It had beautiful shots of places that are some of the most interesting places on earth.  I was amazed that I got this entire set for as cheap as it was offered on Amazon and I would recomend this to anyone that enjoys informational programing.,1238889600,,581,4.392523364485982

The award winning series immediately draws the viewer in with awe-inspiring scenes and moving commentary by David Attenborough.  The only thing that is wrong with the BBC Blu-ray edition is that there are no extra features.

For one thing, I have the DVD set as well. It's cheaper, it's lesser quality, but it has an extra 15 minutes of ""Diaries"" that the HD version does not carry (though the extras were reportedly filmed in HD) and also two extra episodes, also not included in the HD version.

For the second star down: The case itself came broken. I have asked Amazon for a replacement blu-ray case which they claim will be sent to me, but here three weeks or more on I've no sign of the replacement case, and no idea if the ""double dvd case"" the said would be sent will actually turn out to be a blu-ray case that will both hold the discs, and successfully fit in the outer box.

The animals and locations are just breath taking in 1080. Feels like you're there. My wife also enjoys it to. We just finished disk two, and can't wait to see what's on the next two disks.

However, I was unhappy with Amazon itself. There was some type of error or mix up with my account and my sister's.  I purchased this dvd under my email account and my credit card, but some how my sister was charged for it as well (as was I).  We do not share any information, not even a home address. When I called Amazon they said I couldn't do anything because there wasn't any mix-up with my order.  When my sister called, they told her to just return the item to the seller.  They didn't even apologize or try to figure out what the problem was.

However, I have not found this to be the true theme in each movie. There are a few mating animals and strange mating dances and fighting, but they are spread out across the discs. My 4 year old son loves to watch these and learn the names of all the animals, finding out what they eat and where they live. David Attenborough is hardly narrating to his age group, yet he can't get enough of these. Very entertaining for our whole family. Highly recommended!",1237161600,,598,4.495412844036697

I was so depressed I couldn't believe that somebody actually liked it. This video must be sold in a horror department or at least some warning should be put on the box. I don't care how important killing is in animals' life, but I believe this is one of those disturbing moments that must be avoided in the videos aimed at general audience. There are other more artistic ways to convey to the audience the importance of ""food chain"" in wild nature than just show acts of eating of life preys in slow motion. I think that the authors were after cheap ""shock and awe"" effect more than anything else. If that's what you are looking for, it is a great work and you will get a lot of excitement.

It's truly amazing, but isn't the whole point of a multi-layered, high-density, media like blu-ray to pack as much stuff on a disc as possible? If you already had the ""Planet Earth: Diaries"" ready to go, why on Earth would you leave them off? Having seen the ""Diaries"" on Netflix DVDs, I have to say, this series is incomplete without them. I'm so disappointed in the BBC for leaving them off.

2743896,5,B000MR9D5E,"I really enjoy nature but I find most documentaries about nature to be very boring because they tend to overdo the same subject to death. Planet Earth is nice because it covers many areas of interest in a compelling way that flows from one thing to another very nicely. Each ""episode"" has a theme but that theme is usually pretty broad and covers many interesting aspects of wildlife and the terrain.

Additionally, this movie is quite beautiful in high-def. HD-DVD and Blu-Ray owners would do well to have this in their collection if only to show off the capabilities of their sets. It is something that must be seen to believe. We borrowed the normal DVD release from a friend and it looked good, but the beauty of the places this documentary covers can really only be taken in on HD. Its absolutely amazing some of the things they managed to catch on video, and the angles are absolutely amazing.

I highly recommend this to anyone who wants the definitive nature documentary. If you own only one ""educational"" box set, make it this one.",1235088000,,1040,4.646739130434782

I have a lot to say about how fantastic this series is, but that won't be necessary seeing as how the 1,982 (and counting) reviews have already sufficiently covered that.

However, I have not seen the content of this box-set covered in depth, so I'll do so here...

PLANET EARTH

DISC 1

FROM POLE TO POLE: The introduction to the series looks at our planet as a whole and considers the key factors that have shaped its natural history. Without fresh water there is no life on land, while the sun dominates the lives of all animals and plants on Earth and defines their habitats.

MOUNTAINS: This tour of our mightiest mountain ranges, starting with the birth of a mountain at one of the lowest places on Earth and ending at the summit of Everest, takes in some of the most reclusive creatures on the planet and reveals the secrets of their survival.

FRESH WATER: This episode follows the descent of rivers from their mountain sources to the sea and showcases the unique and dramatic wildlife found within Earth's unexplored waters. Together the waterfalls, canyons, frozen lakes, wetlands, and great rivers form a world of mystery, excitement and awe-inspiring sights.

DISC 2

CAVES: Deep in an undiscovered world, including both poisonous and flooded caves, we find astonishing crystals; cave anglerfish; the five million bats of Deer Cave in Borneo; and troglodytes - weird creatures, like the Texas cave salamander, that never see daylight nor set foot on the surface.

DESERTS: Deserts, which make up a staggering 30% of the land's surface, seem empty and lifeless, yet they are the most varied of our planet's ecosystems. With remarkable footage Planet Earth unravels the secrets behind desert survival and for the first time on such a scale, reveals the ephemeral nature of the desert environment.

ICE WORLDS: The advance and retreat of polar ice is the real challenge to life. As the sea freezes in Antarctica all animals flee, except for the Emperor Penguin. Meanwhile, in the Arctic, the polar bear is forced to swim vast distances and take on one of the deadliest adversaries on the planet.

DISC 3

GREAT PLAINS: On these immense wildernesses, from the baking savannahs of Africa to the frozen tundra of the Arctic, we find the greatest gatherings of wildlife on Earth; but close on the heels of gazelles, caribou or wildebeest comes an array of plains predators... eagles, wolves and lions.

JUNGLES: With little seasonality and a longer growing period, jungles are the most productive places on Earth, but surviving in the jungle is far from easy. Using state-of-the-art tracking shots and stunning aerials, Planet Earth moves along the dark forest floor, up through the layers of vegetation and across the canopy.

SHALLOW SEAS: Planet Earth follows a humpback whale mother and calf on an epic journey through the shallow seas of our planet. From tropical coral paradises, where the new-born calf takes his first faltering breaths, to the storm-ravaged icy polar seas, the whales' great feeding grounds, we reveal seas of great contrast and surprise.

DISC 4

SEASONAL FORESTS: From the evergreen forests of the frozen North to the deciduous dry forests of the tropics, these woodlands illustrate the intense seasonality of the Earth. The tallest, largest and oldest organisms on the planet, they are home to a fascinating range of wildlife.

OCEAN DEEP: Feast or famine - it's the governing principle of ocean life. From the sailfish, three-meter-long, rapier-billed predators, and the exquisitely shelled Nautilus to the threatened blue whale, this journey into the most unexplored part of the planet reveals the extraordinary survivors of this immense and barren realm.

PLANET EARTH - THE FUTURE

DISC 5

SAVING SPECIES: Many of the animals featured in Planet Earth are endangered so do we face an extinction crisis? Saving Species asks the experts if there really is a problem, looks at the reasons behind the declining numbers of particular animals and questions how we choose which species we want to conserve.

INTO THE WILDERNESS: Pollution, climate change and a growing human population are all putting pressure on earth's wildernesses including the Bialowieza forest, the Gobi desert & the Arctic tundra. So how much of the planet is still wilderness? And why should we care? Into the Wilderness explores why these uninhabited expanses are important for our survival as well as that of all creatures on the planet.

LIVING TOGETHER: The history of conservation throws up some interesting ideas as we look to the future of an ever more populated planet. How can conservation fit into this new world driven by economics and development? Living Together looks at the challenges facing conservation in the 21st Century and looks at the role of religion in promoting a moral and ethical approach to the world we live in.

BONUS FEATURES (only available on the standard edition)

OVER AN HOUR AND A HALF OF BEHIND-THE-SCENES FOOTAGE - One 10-minute featurette for each episode.

PLANET EARTH - THE FUTURE - This 150 minute companion series looks at what the future may hold for endangered animals, habitats and - ultimately - ourselves.

Well, I hope that was helpful to anyone who hasn't yet picked up this title (although I doubt there are many left) and wants to know more about it.

However, I decided to wait until the High Definition ""war"" ended and then bought a BluRay Player.  I then began checking for the best price on a BluRay DVD and found Amazon had the BBC release on for a great price.  I can only say that this set of DVDs is far and away my favorite collection.

My favorite episodes are the ocean episodes and it feels like you are looking into an aquarium.  I highly recommend this to anyone who has a blue ray player.",1234742400,,460,4.032967032967033

Then I got a plasma TV and decided to purchase the whole series, knowing it would be even better on a big flat screen and having heard that the David Attenborough version was even better. It's all true. I could watch each episode over and over again, just amazed by the scenes that the photographers managed to capture, with the informative (but not sciencey) narration. You see things that you couldn't ever imagine had existed, in the depths of the oceans, on the highest mountains, hidden in caves.

Combine the spectacular footage, the perfect HD/Blu-Ray picture, and the master of nature narration, David Attenborough, and you have one of the best nature series ever created.  Some of the scenes in this series beg to be watched over and over!  Even if you're not a nature buff, you should watch this because if nothing else it is a great way to view the awesomeness of high-def videography.  If you ARE a nature buff, then there is one negative comment that you might want to be aware of : a lot of the coverage of the individual creatures is very brief since it covers the entire planet.  This can leave you wanting to know more about each of the creatures.  That being said, this is a must-own!!",1232841600,,724,4.488549618320611

It's incredibly phenomenal in every aspect, I only regret that they didn't put out more in the series. My grandparents don't watch TV or movies, but they love nature. This was perfect for them. It's one that can be loved across the board in all ages because who doesn't like nature. The cinematography is amazing, and the detail put into this is breath-taking. The only thing I would suggest is you buy the version with Richard Attenborough commentating, for some reason the Sigourney Weaver version isn't as great.

2744065,5,B000MR9D5E,"Updated review:  Still amazing, but.....Blu-ray version does not contain all of the special features that the DVD version has.  I was disappointed to find that it did not have the behind the scenes or making of sequences found on the DVD version.  This is a shame because through out the movie you keep wondering ""how did they get that shot"".  Don't get me wrong...this is an excellent series and the HD is amazing, I just wish it had all of the same features as the regular DVD.

I bought a Blu-Ray player just so that I could watch this series in Blu-Ray.  Every episode captivates my attention and leaves me wanting more.  I am blown away with the breathtaking views and beautiful landscapes.  The colors are rich and vivid and the attention to detail is wonderful.  This is cinema at its best.  The camera work is really the center piece of the show and from time to time, i am awe struck at the camera crew's patience and perseverance to get that ""one special shot"" that might have only lasted 1 second but made you go WOW.

Con:  There are some scenes that are not shot in HD and can be a bit disappointed when contrasted with a vivid HD image 1-second before.  Usually, though, these non HD images occur when we are taken to some remote location where the rarity of the image far out weighs the fact that its not in HD.

In summary,  I love watching this series both alone and with my kids.  I know that this is something we will watch over and over, unlike many other DVDs that I own.",1232409600,,1492,4.351449275362318

There is no such thing as man-made global warming! The earth experiences natural cycles of warming and cooling all the time. The sun is by far the largest contributer to weather patterns and not how much I drive my car around town or if the industry down the street is operating or not. There are much more important concerns for humanity to be concerned with such as the over 50 million babies that have been murdered in the United States alone since Roe Vs. Wade.

No.  That would be like me buying diesel for my non diesel car, or even buying ANY optical disc and trying to play it on a vinyl turntable...not good, seriously people.  (Such travesties of reviews should really be noticed by the Amazon staff and never allowed to be posted).  HDdvd is HDdvd, not ""hi def"" Bluray or vice versa.

That said, Sir David Attenborough delivers onto us his knowledge and passion of nature in one of it's best forms, in High Definition.  If you've ever seen it in HD via satellite (may be the same via cable) you may have witnessed it's pixels galore with the high compression schemes employed.  Not so with disc media.  On that note, this is narrated by Attenborough and not Weaver, just to reiterate.

This depicts life in all it's glory and tribulations.  To witness how difficult and challenging it is for our little planetary brethren is to understand how truly challenging life can be and that we should not take for granted how easy it is we actually have it.  The best parent around is the Emperor Penguin father, and we can only hope to strive for such devotion.  Nature is wonderful.

Attenborough's solo work, especially his 'bird series' is far superior, he can capture an audience with his voice alone, Weaver never found the right voice for these ""all too in love with themselves"" images.  I don't care how long it took to get the penguin or snow leopard sequences...a major disappointment on all levels.

The flaw that keeps this series from receiving a 5 star is that, in spite of the fantastic picture quality, there is a lot of posterization or some type of transfer issues.

But there are two problems with this monumental work. First, the authors push way too much animal sex. I'm always puzzled why pretty much all the creators of documentaries about wildlife think that it is extremely important for every viewer to observe how all the animals, birds and insects mate. Why not just let them do it alone? I and my family can live without it.

Second, we did not enjoy frequent, extremely graphic shots of carnivors chasing and killing, then tearing apart and eating their prey.

However, the mechanical design of the disk holders is terrible.  I almost break the disk each time I remove a disk from its holder.  The center catch is just too stiff and no matter how hard I push on it the disk doesn't release.

2744163,5,B000MR9D5E,"Despite finishing this 11-part series on Blu-Ray a few weeks ago, I still shake my head in amazement at the things I saw on these discs.

Obviously, the incredible photography and sharpness/color (please see this on high-def, if you can) is the first thing that captures the viewer's eye, but as the series went on I appreciated the objectivity in here. The writers and narrator David Attenborough just present the world as it is, with no preaching. The beauty of this earth says it all, and the writers were smart enough to figure that out during this series.

After viewing 11 discs, you come to the obvious conclusions that in the Earth's world of animals, birds and fish come only a few objectives: where to find food, water, a mate, and escape being devoured by a predator. That's it, except for pets or zoo animals. On land or in water, it's simply a matter of survival, as this BBC series shows us.

What makes this so special is that, thanks to incredible work by cameramen, we are privy to many extraordinary sights we would never see, if left on our own, and never imagined existed on this planet. Much of this series is simply mind-boggling to view, especially all the overhead shots, which were stunning, especially in high-definition.",1231286400,,1247,4.7110091743119265

2744178,4,B000MR9D5E,"This is arguably the most ambitious and sumptuous documentary of all time, a magnificent achievement from certainly the foremost natural history film-makers of the world. Often visually breathtaking and encompassing the world's major geographical regions and a fair representaion of the fauna and flora found therein.

The script/narration is a little melodramatic at times. As a naturalist in southern Africa, with over 45 years experience of its wildlife, I was a little perturbed about the chapter on the ""plight"" of elephants in the dry season in the Kalahari region where they trudge many days, or even weeks, through the waterless wastes until, almost miraculously, they arrive at the life saving waters of the Okavango Delta. (Elephants need to drink almost daily, though can go three days without drinking.) So if this story is hyped up and rendered over-poignant, perhaps others are, too....

But there is no denying the generally stunning photography and visual feast of this BBC production.",1231286400,,1001,5.329113924050633

2744203,4,B000MR9D5E,"This review is meant to be short and sweet! Planet Earth is a great series that scans the globe in search for the most exotic locations and animals ever filmed, in full HD none the less!!!

When I first watched this I was in HD owe! Granted most people who rated this below a 4 are the ones that are very hard on the critiquing. When the cameras pan out for a whole screen shot its hard to say that the picture is stunning, don't get me wrong its still very very good,(the only real reason why i gave it a 4 out of 5) its just the real jaw dropping moments happen when they zoom in on specific things, animals, objects etc.. than you see the magic of HD come alive and you won't be disappointed especially with the colors wow!!

By far shallow seas is one of the better discs in the set. It explores the reefs and watching it with someone who thinks a projection TV looks good is alot of fun, (they couldn't stop saying, omg look at the colors, this is incredible!!).

Overall I am very satisfied with this set. Although the price is somewhat hearty most stores offer it at ($99+tax) unless you can find it online for a deal which would probably be your best bet, this is still a great picture quality show off blu ray that you can enjoy for hours.

**Don't forget that each disc has up to 3 separate areas filmed on it (look at the chapters) That got me nervous the fist time i watched disc 1 it ended at 55mins or so with great plains (kinda boring) and i couldn't find the rest of the disc contents (even though it says it on the disc itself) because when you hit play all it didn't seem to go to the next country/scenes about jungles so i thought it was over. Maybe i should retitle this part Planet Earth for dummies, anyway enjoy!! =)",1231113600,,1740,4.1850746268656716

Let's face it, you only go through this life once, and it's impossible to see all of the beauty this planet has to offer; mostly due to the fact that it is so unaccessable to the novice. But the crew of ""Blue Planet"" takes you to the roof top of the world and then plunges you back into it's oceans. It was like taking a vacation around the world while sitting in my living room. But,do be prepared for natures harsher side. You will see some scenes that are not for the faint of heart, but i think the editing was just right...they cut away from the scenes before it becomes too repugnant.

The show itself is exactly the same, BUT it has a different narrator. This one is narrated by David Attenborough, the one shown on Discover is narrated by Sigourney Weaver. I got this as a Christmas present and when I played it an old decrepid voice came across the screen, needless to say I was kind of dissapointed that a fairly more attractive voice was nowhere to be found. So just be sure you know which one you are buying.

The series itself is absolutely breathtaking. I've never seen anything like this before and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys watching anything on TV.

The caves episode has a scene with a giant pile of bat guano and upon the pile of guano lives a large colony of cockroaches....just a bit over the top for me and this scene was a long and detailed one.

2744236,5,B000MR9D5E,"Planet Earth is quite simply the greatest nature and wildlife series ever produced. This astonishing 11-part BBC series is brilliantly narrated by Sir David Attenborough which covers a specific geographical region and wildlife habitat each episode until the entire planet has been magnificently represented by the most astonishing sights and sounds you'll ever experience. The series delivers a seemingly endless variety of natural wonders, from the spectacular mating displays of New Guinea's various birds of paradise to a rare encounter with Siberia's nearly-extinct Amur Leopards, of which only 30 remain in the wild. To the wilderness of many countries of mountains, lakes, caves, open plains and oceans.

Accompanied by majestic orchestral scores by George Fenton, every episode is packed with images so beautiful or so forcefully impressive (and so perfectly photographed by the BBC's tenacious high-definition camera crews) that you'll be rendered speechless by the splendor of it all. Masterfully filmed from every conceivable angle, with frequent use of super-slow-motion and amazing motion-controlled time-lapse cinematography, and narrated by Attenborough with his trademark combination of observational wit and informative authority.

2744262,3,B000MR9D5E,"This is a big production with some incredible cinematography that is truly second to none. However, as an avid collector of nature films, I somehow was a bit disappointed by the lack of totally new material that I have never seen before.

One scene demonstrated the emergence of periodical cicadas in the southeastern United States, and the ensuing feast enjoyed by all the predatory birds, reptiles, etc. This was very spectacular, but I was troubled by the narrator's assertion that this event occurs only once every 17 years. While the cicada actually does live for 17 years as an underground nymph before emerging for its brief adult life, I am quite sure that there are multiple broods of different ages occurring in a given area which allow for a new emergence every few years. Why was this point not researched a little more thoroughly?

In summary, I was very impressed by the quality of this production but slightly disappointed by the lack of new content not already explored by other, similar documentaries.",1228953600,,1018,4.912790697674419
2744263,3,B000MR9D5E,"When reading over all the fine reviews of this series, I am kind of struck by the fact that nearly all of them speak of the DVD format rather than the subject itself.  Yes, this is a beautifully photographed series and yes, it will look great on your wide screen TV (or your Dentists).

But after watching over half of the episodes, I am still wondering what it has to say, or to add to all of the other nature documentaries I have seen in my life.  Frankly, I was rather disappointed by the content. I'm not certain that there was any 'vision' from the producers, other than to make a visually stunning film - which I acknowledge, they did very well.

But really, I had hoped for more that just another film with Gazelles and Apakas. You would think that most life on Planet Earth were mammals from watching.  So little of the birds, nearly nothing about insects or reptiles, etc.  So many interesting stories to tell, so why settle for such standard fare?  And whatever happened to the Australian continent?

I would not necessarily recommend you avoid purchasing, but just keep in mind that these stories, while BEAUTIFULLY photographed in widescreen and with a non-stop music score and narration, are kind of the tip of the iceberg so to speak.  They could have done so much better I think.

Very nice to look at for an hour or so, but ultimately a little boring.",1228867200,2,1367,4.520325203252033

2744288,5,B000MR9D5E,"This BBC 5-disc, 14-episode series blew me away!

OK, what makes this series any different than the myriad of other nature shows out there?

1) Planet Earth filming crews made it a point to visit remote places that are seldom visited
2) They made it a point to locate and film many endangered species that have seldom if ever been filmed in the wild
3) The film crews were not satisfied to only film these animals, they succeeded in filming many seldom-observed behaviors of those endangered species
4) The film crews included not only footage of the animals they sought, but incredible footage showing the habitats those species rely on for survival.
5) The ""how-they-did-it"" video short features accompanying the episodes were fantastic.

From all indications the BBC did not cut any corners or leave any filming techniques unexplored in order to compile video footage and then produce this masterpiece.

When our copy of ""Planet Earth"" arrived we decided as a family to watch one episode a week.  After only the first episode the entire crew wanted to watch more, but we decided to stick with our original plan.  We set aside a designated time each week to watch an episode and no one missed any of those showings.  That's incredible considering the fact that we have a HS senior, a HS junior, a HS freshman, and a 4th grader.

The episodes satisfied and intrigued children, teens, and adults alike.  We were sad when we reached the final episode, but we all agree that it was a highly enriching experience.

If you are looking for intelligent, meaningful, and well-done programming to add to your personal video collection, look no further.  Planet Earth is a MUST HAVE item.

Nature video experiences just don't get any better than this!  And, I should know - I've been teaching biology, zoology, and environmental science at the college/university level for over 15 years.

The narration by Sir David Attenborough is excellent, very informative, and pleasant to listen to. The scenery of this set offers views of our planet that is absolutely astounding, shot from land, sea, under water, air and space. The episodes were so enjoyable that when one would end we wanted to watch another, and another, and another.

No doubt that in my home, this series will be watched many times for years to come. I was concerned about the price at first, but the set has proven itself to be well worth the cost! In fact I'm planning to send this set to family members as a gift.

2744292,3,B000MR9D5E,"This film is crucial if we want to understand the present debate on climate change. The climate is changing as it has always done. But it seems to be changing more dramatically and warming up slightly though it is still a long way cooler than it was at the time of the dinosaurs. The position defended here by Attenborough is moralistic more than anything else. We are supposed to feel compassion for polar bears and to be afraid of the future. Such a fascination for apocalyptic predictions is quite typical of the Jewish or Christian tradition, with some roots in older Indo-European religious mythologies. This apocalyptic literature is often, and by far, the best and most inspiring inspiration in these traditions. But does it have any real foundation? According to Attenborough it is the truth, full stop, period, dead end, let's get ready for it. He follows the model of the now famous carbon dioxide and green house gases and global warming up theory. And exclusively this one. Then he considers the main cause is the production - or liberation - of carbon dioxide by human activities, particularly the use of fossil fuels. In other words he uses his pointer a little bit too much and of course ends up pointing at the Chinese and their becoming the first polluter in the world, ahead of the US, but he forgets to say they are at least four times more numerous for a level of development that is evaluated by the CIA to be around 80% of the US. When he is not pointing at people he is pointing at the only things we can do to reduce our production of carbon dioxide. And he does not see this totally negative approach cannot really work because people do not want to be made to feel guilty all the time, and then, in this perspective, we will have to set regulations and a cop behind every human activity. He forgets the basic human principle, and even vital principle for all that is alive at least on this planet, that has been totally negated by western development, by this short-sighted development at all costs, the fact that humanity has managed to emerge by using the basic living principle that all activities must produce more energy or value than it consumes and that the consumption of energy has to be as low as possible for the profit margin to be as high as possible. To be soundly economic life has to be economical. And our free and extremely wasteful consumption of energy - and everything else, including human life - is anti-economic because it is un-economical. That is the very first principle we must refer to: we must not use one gram of energy more than what we need. The second principle is also basic to all forms of life: a living being uses his environment to live - and/or survive - but it does not pollute it. And strangely enough humans seem to have been only interested in visible pollution. All that is not visible does not seem to bother them. That's the only positive aspect of the film: it reveals one invisible pollution, carbon dioxide. It also reveals that what is not immediately catchable by human senses does not seem to exist for human beings. I personally think here that it is better to mobilize the sense of cleanliness human life has always demonstrated - even if that sense has been increasing across centuries and will go on increasing - rather than the guilt we are supposed to feel when thinking of our grandchildren. This argument about our descendents is the reversal of another human principle. In all civilizations including ours till recently, the younger generation was there to take care of the older one when needed and not the reverse. The argument used by Attenborough means that we consider the younger generation is unable to assume their responsibilities. We are making them childish and dependent. We should expect them to be more reasonable than us and not the reverse, which does not excuse our own foolishness which is foolishness in itself and not as for the consequences on our descendents. This leads me to a final remark. Has the West been developing along a line that negates all human traditions and logic? I have like the impression that yes it has. We must then reverse that mistake but not with cops and regulations or guilt complexes but with economic  and economical arguments. And that should not prevent us from studying other climatic models particularly the one based on water vapor, which Attenborough does not do at all. Note, as a final kick at the sandbag of blind if not biased ideology, that Attenborough does not even take into account that if we learned new cooking method based on microwave oven we could cut by half our consumption n of energy for all forms of cooking, and frying being a bad dietary habit, the light browning we can get with microwaves has to be healthier than all that carbonizing we produce in a frying pan.

There are Blu-Ray movies were the format adds nothing and then there are things like this were the format shows what can be done.

The photography is unmatched. The educational value is high and the narriation is just right. This series will convince any skeptics out there of the value of the Blu-Ray HD format.

2744339,5,B000MR9D5E,"First of all, David Attenborough is a terrific narrator. Had he not narrated this, I doubt I would have purchased it. He compliments documentary films THAT well, and enhances the overall enjoyment and fulfillment of viewing such works.

Now about the DVD. Wow. I give this documentary and the DVD's 5 stars easy, but there were some extremely MINOR things that I thought could have been better.

The film has coverage from quite a large amount of the Earth. From the Amazon, to the Rocky Mountains, to the artic tundra and everywhere possible in between. This film brought me videos of truly bizarre animals I'd never imagined existed. It showed a more up-close and intimate view in the life of many animals that I was already aware of. There was a point in the video that brought me down a bit, and that was the footage and story of the snow leopards of of northern Siberia whose numbers are dwindling horribly low. You get a personal look at so many different terrains, species, and ecosystems.

Footage was taken from some amazing areas of the planet that made you wonder at times how anyone even got to these places safely. The camera crew clearly goes above and beyond in order to bring us spectacles that most of us will never see in person. At the end of each episode, there is a behind the scenes look at what it took to film in certain places. You really get a better appreciation for the amount of time, work, and personal risk that each member of the film crew had put on the line. It was this portion of the DVD's alone that made me feel better about how much I had paid for them.

Picture and Sound Quality = 10/10
Even without blueray, the picture here is so amazing that it was almost as if you were there personally. Sounds were sharp and crystal clear and the images precise and spectacular. I was very impressed.

Coverage = 9/10
There were times when I wanted to see more footage of rare places that I thought they could have probably added in. Then at other times I felt they spent a little too much time on certain places or animals. Also, footage from the behind the scenes shots really only focused on one shooting session from each episode. Overall I was still impressed with the coverage of the film.

Narration = 10/10
David Attenborough, like I said before, is just terrific to listen to. The script and insight given by him to the viewer was perfect. He never overwhelms you with too much information about a particular species or scene, offering just enough dialogue to peak your curiosity and inform you, and also offering just enough quiet time for you to take it all in. Attenborough is the best.

My complaints:
Really I had only a few, and will just discuss two rather than go on and on nit-picking the every point of the film. First, there were scenes which the action happened so fast that they had to slow it down many many times in order for you to be able to clearly see what happened. This was really awesome to view. However, there were times they did this and then never actually show you the full real life speed in which it happened. A very minor complaint that really doesn't take away from the quality of the film.
My only other complaint is that if you're a hardcore outdoors/nature enthusiast, it might leave you happy, but not feeling satisfied. At the end of each episode, I was disappointed that it was over. I personally wanted more.

Conclusion:
Planet Earth is a fantastic collective look at our planet. It is a little pricey, but definitely worth it if you want to see some very impressive stuff. BBC has once again provided its audience with a superior product that easily beats out other nature documentaries. Also if you haven't checked it out yet, be sure to pick up The Blue Planet, also by BBC and narrated by David Attenborough.",1223164800,,3790,4.522627737226277

2744343,5,B000MR9D5E,"My general rule about Blu-ray is that I will not replace a DVD I already own with a Blu-ray DVD. Like every good rule, it should have a few exceptions and Planet Earth is one of them.

This series was made for Blu-ray. The photography, stunning even on standard definition, is astonishing in 1080p. As the camera moves from helicopter sweeps of vast herds of yaks on the high plains of Mongolia, to elephants emerging ghostlike from high grasses in India to vibrant underwater vistas of barrier reefs teeming with tropical life, we get a sense of our own relative place on our blue ball.

David Attenborough's career has been devoted to the interface between the communication arts and the natural sciences. He is the perfect narrator for such an ambitious series, bringing scientific credibility together with a classic BBC voice. Attenborough is no mere narrator however. He is the principal writer of this award winning series.

Once you have committed to HDTV and Blu-ray this should be an essential part of your collection, even if you already own the standard definition DVD.",1222732800,2,1081,4.896174863387978

2744345,4,B000MR9D5E,"So many times on Amazon I look for a review of the PRODUCT, and end up getting a review of the movie/documentary/story etc.  So I will attempt to review the PRODUCT (blu-ray vs standard) rather than Planet Earth itself.

I bought the standard DVD format after seeing a few episodes on Discovery, and before I managed to get my blu-ray setup.  I was thoroughly engrossed, the visuals, the quality, the information, and the narration by David Attenborough on this standard DVD were superb.  Absolutely no complaints on this format.

Got my blu-ray setup, and this was the first product on my list (I actually bought the entire BBC collection which included Galapagos, Wild China, Ganges).  Quality was as I expected of blu-ray, really brought out the images as 1080p would.

Major flaw on the blu-ray version however - the last disc of the standard DVD is not included, exactly why, I have been unable to find a reason.  This disc contained some valuable extras, including a great segment on the state of the planet right now, and some compelling examples and visuals of our human impact on many locations around the globe.

My feelings towards this product are consequently mixed.  There is no arguing the superiority of blu-ray vs regular DVD.  However, Planet Earth was so spectacularly done, that looking at the images on the standard DVD format are still fantastic.

If this blu-ray version had all the discs included, I would recommend it hands-down ahead of the regular.  If you are willing to surcumb to the marketing strategies (or whatever was the reason) of BBC and pay for both versions (as I ended up doing), then you're set.  However, if you are looking to buy just 1 version, I personally think that the extra disc, partnered with the already magnificent quality of the standard DVD, puts it ahead of the blu-ray package offered.",1222128000,22,1842,4.82484076433121

All I can say is that the first disc has been stunning.  Just an amazing picture (52"" 1080p LCD TV doesn't hurt) and I have been finding it very educational for both myself and my daughter.  The aerial footage of a giant herd of caribou or wild dogs conducting a well-organized hunt, or the detailed close-ups showing every little hair blowing in the breeze, is simply amazing.  Of course I am coming straight from standard definition TV, so part of my awe is probably due to experiencing high definition in the first place.

2744363,4,B000MR9D5E,"I purchased this collection on DVD a while ago and after upgrading my equipment to 1080p LCD/PS3 and 7.1 audio I had to have this on Blu-Ray more than ANYTHING in my blu ray/dvd collection. I had been hooked on this series since the very first time I saw it. David Attenborough is an amazing narrator and a perfect match for this series. The footage is incredible and captures the essence of nature unlike any other wildlife series I have ever seen.

I do have one complaint about the Blu Ray release of this series (Why I only gave it 4 stars) in that it has a great deal of problems with 1080p playback in certain scenes. The flickering of dark backgrounds on light foregrounds such as during the angel falls scene during ""freshwater"" is unacceptable especially for videophiles. It is not as great as I would have wished for because the flicker takes away from what would be one of the most remarkable scenes ever captured in video history. I have a top of the line home theater system with a samsung 46"" LCD running the 1080p content from a PS3 40GB with monster cable connecting it all. I contacted BBC america because I thought I had a defective disc set, which amazon happily replaced for me. It turns out that BBC released an official statement that because of filming coniditions, High Definition video capture was hindered, or not even used at all. It is understandable, but disheartening nonetheless for us looking for the ultimate viewing experience with this collection, hence the reason for buying another copy on Blu ray.

Anyways, if you don't mind visual artifacts from time to time or it just doesn't bother you regardless, this collection is abolsutely a must for any blu ray collection. Some claim that they do not experience this problem, but I am hard pressed to believe it because BBC admitted that the artifacts exist regardless of the equipment you are going to try to view it with.

Overall, Hats-off to BBC for making this series. It will cease to amaze you every time you watch it! and for the price on amazon, it can not be turned down!",1220832000,,2064,4.603260869565218

2744371,5,B000MR9D5E,"A series produced by the BBC and narrated by Dr David Attenborough; it turns out to be an electrifying  testament to Planet Earth. Technically, the 5 DVD's are excellent; great video and superb audio.

This is a series that basically spans the globe bringing us stunning visual accounts of the wildlife on our world; in the air, on land and under the oceans, from pole to pole, from desert to tropical forests. There are moments ranging from motherly tenderness to stunning hunts of predators and prey; some will leave you breathless.

Each DVD tends to deal with a particular area or topic. One doesn't have to delve far into the first disc to realize that someone, somewhere has spent countless hours (mostly just waiting for the right moment) to obtain these unique and unbelievable shots/films.

My highlight of the entire series was from disc one; an immense great white shark (previously hidden beneath the surface of the ocean), leaps completely out of the water to devour a poor unsuspecting seal. This spectacle is presented to you, the viewer, in slow motion; the actual event is stunningly quick, violent and takes place within less then two seconds. Talk about being at the right spot at the right time (unless your the seal, of course), to actually film this incredible footage. .

Conclusion:
A 5 DVD collection; professionally filmed, edited and narrated. It will make you aware of the beauty, yet savage potential that encompasses some of the less traversed areas of our home planet.  5 Stars...more if I could.

There is no bonus footage like the DVD set but I have seen it, and it honestly pales in comparison to the actual show.

The photography is absolutely stunning, and the moments the Planet Earth team were able to capture are simply unbelievable.
Beyond being a great nature series, what I love about owning this boxed set, is it's something I will keep with me for a LONG time and be able to re-watch time and again. Not only is it something that I will be able to enjoy, but it's something that I can show to my kids someday that will be better than all the brain-sucking cartoons that are out these days.

I have had friends and family watch this and they all get amazed on how good the quality looks but also how good of a movie this is.

The visuals are spectacular, audio is superb and narration by David Attenborough is as flawless and compelling as ever. I have been a huge fan of other BBC/David Attenborough documentaries such as Life of Mammals, Life in the Undergrowth etc and Planet Earth seems to be the pinnacle of the work.

Produced over a period of 5 years, you can just imagine the monumental effort and hardship that went into this product.  Shot in some of the most remote and harshest environments just to get that perfect shot after months of patience; if there's one documentary that's deserving of your money and time - it's this one.",1216166400,,712,4.733870967741935

I found Planet Earth on Amazon for about $20 less than what it was selling for at Target, so I snatched it up.  We watched the first episode immediately, and it took my breath away.

I've since viewed other Blu-ray movies and TV series on my new system and though the clarity is impressive, nothing holds a candle to Planet Earth.  This was a great purchase, and I know I'll watch this series again in years to come.  I highly recommend this series to all Blu-ray owners.",1215993600,,635,4.294117647058823

There is absolutely nothing else like this. It is some of the most amazing film you will ever watch. I don't think there is any way to overstate the magnificence of this production. A lot of the areas covered have never been filmed before or certainly not in the way filmed in this series. One of the best parts is the filmed diary at the end of each segment that shows the behind the scenes work that went into filming that particular show. Watching the incredible episodes along with the outstanding music score, you don't think about what it took to get that footage. Seeing them getting their camera gear into the deepest caves on earth, sitting in a claustrophobic shelter for weeks to get a few minutes footage of the snow leopard or loading up two months supplies of food, water, gas and supplies to film camels in the Gobi Desert make you appreciate the unbelievable effort that went into producing this series.

The way the filmmakers made it in separate parts of the globe, covering the landscape, seascape, and the animals within it made it more enjoyable to watch. The aerial shots are spectacular. Always gorgeous no matter where each part was filmed, the different parts of the world, the climates the world's creatures endure to survive and thrive in is both fascinating, breathtaking, and tragic. Nature can be beautiful, but also cruel, and the filming of this magnificent achievement shows it better than any nature film I've ever seen.

What I did not like in the whole 4 disc coverage is the lack of depth of subject. You can say it has breadth, but no dept. In most cases, it gives a glimpse of some exciting natural beutym but you would long to see more. The authour/narrator seemed to have too many things, but very less time to put everything together.

I hope this helps your decision to buy this. In spite of the limitation as mentioned, I would still say it is a must have.

My jaw dropped and if it weren't a documentary, I'd think it was special affects when they captured the scene of seals swimming in the ocean (I don't to spoil it so i'll leave it at that). The makers claimed it took them 10 years in the making, and I believe them.

The only bad part is every episode ends with a little lecture on Global Warming, which is a bit annoying. Can't a person just enjoy a film without it getting political?""",1213660800,,831,4.42483660130719

""A hundred years ago, there were one and a half billion people on Earth.  Now, over six billion crowd our fragile planet.  But even so, there are still places barely touched by humanity.  This series will take you to the last wilderness and show you the planet and its wildlife as you have never seen them before.""

The above was said at the beginning of this series by the narrator, natural history icon (Sir) David Attenborough.  He's not kidding!!  You'll see things that you've never seen before including rare animal species and rare animal behaviours.  Not only do you see but you hear things as well and you can even imagine smells.

This series was five years in the making, with over two hundred days in the field, using forty cameraman filming in over two hundred locations throughout the world.  The result: an unforgettable portrait of our entire planet.

Here are the titles of each episode or chapter (about 50 minutes per episode):

(1) From pole to pole (2) Mountains (3) Fresh water (4) Caves (5) Deserts (6) Ice worlds (7) Great plains (8) Jungles (9) Shallow seas (10) Ocean deep (11) Seasonal forests

After each episode is an approximate ten minute extra called ""Planet Earth: Diaries.""  These give behind-the-scenes footage for each episode and shows how each episode in this series was a challenge to make.

Finally, there is also a three-part bonus documentary (on a separate disc) called ""Planet Earth: The Future.""  These episodes (of one hour each) look at the possible fate of endangered animals, habitats, and humanity.

In conclusion, be prepared to see our living Earth as you've never seen it before.  This series is truly the ultimate portrait of the planet.

(2006; 11 hrs {includes 10 min. extras} + 3 hr. bonus material;  made for BBC TV;  5 discs;  wide screen)

1. Content.  The images presented here are exceptional, this presents nature in all its glory.  It gives you rare images of many animals in their natural surroundings, and also shows lots of shots of truly beautiful natural landscapes.  A great show to watch with the whole family (although beware if you have really small children, some of the chase scenes involving wolves and such might be scary to a young child).

2. Quality.  You can tell this was filmed in high definition.  This showcases your tv like no other disc.  If your tv can handle full 1080P, the quality of these discs is incredible.

In Summary: You'll put this on for people to watch the awesome quality of the scenes, but they'll end up staying because of the incredible content of the documentary.  Highly Recommended!",1210377600,,821,4.75886524822695

CONS: Unfortunate that the Blu-Ray version contains nary a whiff of extra material that are jam-packed on the standard DVD version. It would have been nice to get some behind-the-scenes docs (in HD) plus insights by the  people behind the lens and Mr. Attenborough himself.

And trust me, people, ""perfect"" is a word I typically only associate with God.  And it's so apropos in this instance. My exclamations have incessantly been ""Oh my God!!!""  Do yourselves a favor, folks, and get this for your family and friends.  I want to share it with everyone.  Thanks Mr. Attenborough.",1208995200,,930,4.488095238095238

- very good picture quality, but it is normal given the technology (Blu-Ray)
- the topics are very interesting with many sites or animals never seen before,
- the cinematography is also wonderful with shots that I still wonder how they did them or how long time did they spent for a few seconds in the movie.
For the moment, it is my only Blu-ray disc but this really worth buying a Blu-ray drive to watch it.
I am waiting for a sequel of the same quality and produced by the BBC.

1. The image quality of the introduction to every disc (the herds moving through the grass), is actually quite bad, it's very grainy.
2. I found some areas of the film had a white flicker effect, something I would expect from a VHS tape.
3. The case for the DVD's, built like it was meant to never have the discs removed.  The circular tab that holds the discs, holds the disc too tight, you actually have to bend the discs to remove them.",1208822400,2,556,4.3173076923076925

It is apparent the BBC crew had gone to great length and risk to film all the never before seen places on earth.  Had the document been produced in the 1080p format, the sceneries would be even more awe-inspiring.

I wanted this in high definition, but did not feel like shelling out the hundreds a Blu-Ray player costs. It was well worth it at the end of the day. This looks crystal clear in high-def at 1280x1024 widescreen on my 22"" monitor. Discovery channel also had their own version, but this is the better one. No one beats David Attenborough in narration.

In all it's 11 episodes, about an hour each. The first a brief overview of the entire globe, the following 10 going in depth on particular climates/areas of the globe. It is disappointing HD-DVD died so suddenly. But if you have no immediate plans for Blu-Ray. Planet Earth is well worth keeping the player around.

2744641,5,B000MR9D5E,"I teach biology and earth science to 9th and 10th grade kids who are ""at risk"" for a lot of things, perhaps the least of which is never graduating from high school.

I brought Planet Earth into my classroom at the beginning of this school year.  Every other Tuesday, my classes and I have watched 45 minutes of this incredible journey.  We began with Disc 1 and progressed through all of them.  We never got to finish any of them in one sitting but it didn't matter.  We just picked up where we left off the next time we Movie Tuesday came around.

Perhaps not so surprisingly, I had no absences on Movie Tuesday after the first few showings--well, until recently when we ran out of Planet Earth discs.  Every single more-hardcase-than-thou student was present on the days we turned off the lights, turned on the TV and got incredibly detailed knowledge into the animals, biomes, plants and intricate biological interrelationships shown so clearly in these remarkable DVD's.

It's been a great teaching tool for me.  The discussions the individual movies have spawned in my classroom have been of great worth.  These are kids who, mostly, haven't ever even been to a real zoo.  Now a few of them have dreams of becoming wildlife photographers or videographers, occupations they didn't know existed before watching this series.

The cost of this movie to me was worth it ten times over, and not only because it motivated a few of my bada*s students (so they think) into dreaming about and beginning to plan for a life outside and away from the guns, drugs and violence they go home to everyday.",1208217600,3,1593,4.690647482014389

2744645,5,B000MR9D5E,"I have always been a nature lover and lover of nature programmes, especially those of the great David Attenborough. When ""Planet Earth"" came out I knew what to expect because it was the same team that did ""Blue Planet"", and yet, it still managed to take my breath away.

The imagery alone is mind-bogglingly magnificent and worth five times the prive of the DVDs. As a photographer myself, I often found myself truly and utterly amazed at the skill and dedication of the cameramen involved in this series. Those pictures alone are enough to make one feel the small, insignificant, tiny speck of dust on the face of our great and wonderful planet that one really is. On top of this the sound is world class and really helps to support the majestic feel of our nature, that the imagery so perfectly displays. The narration by Attenborough is the clincher. The familiar sound of, perhaps THE nature documentarist, is icing on the cake. Wonderful icing though.

To make an already lenghty review slightly less long than it could be, I'll say this: ""Planet Earth"" inspires, captivates, spellbinds, strikes you with awe (not the sadly overused teenager 'awesome', but the proper God fearing kind of awe), and makes you fall absolutely and utterly in love with the earth on which we are so fortunate to live our lives.

I watch a lot of nature and wildlife shows on public television, and because of that, ""Planet Earth"" simply does not provide a ""WOW"" factor for me.  There were also several ""repeat"" scenes about polar bears and penguins that I felt contributed to a waste of ""space"" where ""new"" scenes could have been provided.

It played beautifully on my HD player, all four discs. It seemed to cover about all the major categories of earth and was presented with good picture quality. Actually to me, it was probably more educational than entertaining. I saw many things that I did not know existed. I was impressed with the work of the cameramen.

It was a no brainer that we would get this as a family gift as soon as it became available. The DVD set comes with all the amazing episodes, and includes film diaries of the people who spent 5 years shooting. You start to appreciate the effort and danger these people gave and faced, after viewing what they had to do in order to get those perfect shots. Also, you get an additional disc with 3 extras: Saving Species, Into the Wilderness, and Living Together. All of these extras emphasize the entire point of creating the series. They go into detail about endangered species, the effects the changing planet can have on life and the environment (mainly caused by humans), and the challenges of conservation for our planet's future.

My setup is a 40"" Sony KDL-40v2500 1080p LCD HDTV with a PS3 for my Blu-Ray capabilities, and a Sony sourround system.

I wish it would allow me to give a seperate rating for packaging, my ""blu-ray case"" didn't survive very well in shipping.  The tabs on the inside that hold the disc in place have broken, and the other tabs that hold the ""page turning disc holder"" were broken upon removing the plastic wrap.

2744706,5,B000MR9D5E,"The BBC hit one out of the ballpark with ""Planet Earth"" on HD DVD!

From the very first scene, you will know that this is no ordinary nature documentary. The production value and quality of the content and narration is very high, which makes it a good documentary on any video format, but the spectacular video quality and cinematography make for a fantastic combination that has no current equal!

Most nature documentary footage intended to show off HD is limited in its appeal because it usually consists of slow pans across vivid flowers, landscapes, or other such material. While pretty to look at, there is nothing more. Here, you get live action photography that seems to take advantage of all the great features of HDTV, and a compelling documentary to back it up.

If you plan on keeping your HD DVD player, you should purchase this box set. It alone justifies the presence of an HD player of any format in your system. I would expect the Blu-ray version to be equal in quality, so if you already have a Blu-ray player or are planning to get one, that's the version to get.

If you are capable of appreciating great visuals and an interesting story across a wide array of topics relating to nature, the environment, and the organisms and landscapes that make up the world we live in, this is an excellent buy!",1206748800,,1318,4.619658119658119

2744718,2,B000MR9D5E,"It goes without saying that the BBC series Planet Earth has been one of the most highly praised nature programs in years.  And, in a number of ways, the excellent reviews were well earned.  Having said that, I can't recommend Planet Earth.

My main problem with Planet Earth is that invariably mixed in with the wonderful footage was one scene after the next of animals tearing each other to pieces.  Admittedly this kind of carnage is an integral part of nature and a necessary factor in ""the great circle of life.""  But I took offense to the overwrought dramatization of these segments.  Narrator David Attenborough would inevitably switch to sinister tones and deliver lines such as ""But little did these creatures know that a hungry predator was close by.""  Then the music would change to minor chords to increase the tension and the viewer is then subjected to graphic shots of an animal being ripped apart.  In one of the early episodes there were five separate scenes of animals slaughtering each other within the first 25 minutes.  Yes, such events are commonplace on the planet Earth, but this series would have you believe that there is *nothing* else happening in nature except one bloodbath after the next.

I thought that I'd be given a reprieve in one of the most highly praised episodes ""Caves.""  How bad could it be seeing a bat gulp down a moth?  Instead we see a bat accidentally trapped in a pile of guano--its very human-like hand back-lit and reaching up during the animal's death throes while being consumed by cockroaches and centipedes.  Disturbing and overly graphic.

It was a huge disappointment for me that this series, with so much footage that could truthfully be called ""miraculous"", would instead choose to liberally pepper this potentially wonderful program with limbs being torn off, bloody feathers flying through the air and music that wouldn't have been out of place in John Williams' Jaws soundtrack.  Planet Earth had wonderful potential, but for me in the end it was mainly just a gore fest.",1206316800,15,2031,4.863372093023256

the product itself: what are you getting?

there are 11, 50 minute episodes contained on 4 discs.  this series was shot on HD video, which is much easier to lug around than traditional film based cameras.  unfortunately that difference often shows, particularly in darker portions of an image or at long distances.  the result is a great deal of grain or static, artifacts that just look horrible compared to everything else you'll be seeing.  i mention this because it is very noticeable without trying to be picky, and since all the other images look so beautiful.

also worth note is that not everything was shot on HD, contrary to a lot of the publicity material you've likely been reading.  night vision scenes, as well as some other seemingly random scenes have been shot on traditional video.  it still looks good, but not great.

considering that this has been billed as THE HD nature documentary, it loses one star for spotty image problems.  part of this problem is the limitation of HD video, part if is likely due to poor authoring.",1206144000,2,1420,4.770491803278689

2744726,3,B000MR9D5E,"Every two minutes my jaw is dropping at the amazing hi-def images the cinematographers were able to capture for this documentary. The narrator is top notch and the BBC orchestra simply outdid itself this time.

There aren't too many collections I can honestly recommend to anyone - but Planet Earth can easily capture the imagination of young through old and across all types of people.

My big complaint - and this goes towards my values on ... well ... value, is the exclusion of the 110 minutes of diary footage at the end of each segment. My parents have the DVD version of this and they rave about how great that footage is and to be honest, I feel like I'm missing out on half of the experience, even though it is only a 110 minutes combined.

I also am upset I've been charged almost double for the Blu Ray version then the standard def version and the extra disc about ""looking forward"" is excluded as well! I bought this when it first came out and I wasn't aware the extra footage wasn't included. If I had known I probably would have just rented it from the video store or borrowed it.

Yes the images are truly amazing and the best I've seen on my 52-inch television, but owning this isn't as great without the extra footage. I bought it because it's the type of thing (the actual docs and the extra footage) I could see myself showing to friends and family over and over again, but not as much w/o that footage.

Documentary:Planet Earth - The Future: This 3-part, 2 1/2 hour series looks at what the future may hold for endangered animals, habitats and -- ultimately -- ourselves. Following the environmental issues raised by Planet Earth, it asks why so many species are threatened and how they can be protected in future. (SD release only)""

My friend bought the DVD set as a gift, and we started to watch this extraordinarily exceptional documentary series. Among all other things, the part that we most liked was those ""behind the scene footages"" because there are some utterly and literally unbelievable scenes captured that make you wonder how they were captured, and after each episode these footages tell you about the techniques used for videotaping. As a frequent documentary watcher, I was really puzzled with how these series were videotaped, and the footages shed light to many things.

Since I liked this series very much, I went to BestBuy and quarelled with a sales associate for the exhange of this DVD set with the Blu-ray one. Eventually I win, but when I came to my apartment, ultimately she won, because the footages were missing in the Blu-ray edition!!!

BBC, first and foremost, what made you think that Blu-ray player owners do not require or less require the bonus feautres??

Second, if you ever had to consider whether DVD player owners or Blu-ray player owners less need the bonus feautres, then how come you voted against the latter?? After all the bonus feautres constantly praise how you videotaped in HD!!

As to the narrators, I have not watched the series on TV, nevertheless I share the same opinion with others, as a non-American.

Why are you compelling these guys to watch the series in British English. I could respec`t your decision if you had sticked to British English for the TV broadcasting. But broadcasting with a U.S. narrator and then releasing the DVD with a Brit narrator is simply deceiving people.

Anyhow, for the prospective buyers I will, irrespective of the HD quality, recommend the DVD set instead of Blu-ray. Believe me, the DVD series was also very nice. Not to mention that another reviewer comments that the visual quality on this Blu-ray is far worse than the then TV broadcasting. He relies his facts on the encoding.

And if you own a Blue Ray Disc Player, this is one film (there are four discs) that is simply a must for your collection.

I watched this expecting cool videos of Africa and South America, but I was surpirsed to see captivating views of redwood forests and mamouth caves.  In addition to this, take a tour of the ocean deep, the frosted top of the word, the peaks of the Andes and Himilayas and the deserts which turn into grasslands for three months a year.  I almost feel that if you don't watch this on Blu-ray on an HDTV, you are cheating yourself.  Finally, the info provided is not in any way ""preachy"" about a greener lifestyle.  The narrator allows us to do it all on our own.  So sit back, relax, and explore this beautiful planet we call home.",1204848000,,978,4.418994413407821

I would like to state that the HD versions released and sold only at the Discovery HD store do not have these flickering problems.  But you get to listen to another person narrating instead.  There's some slightly different footage also.

Also it appears that the BBC HD versions do not contain any special features at all.  Regular DVD version has a good number of features and an extra disk containing a future earth episode.  The HD versions from Discovery HD do contain some special features, the 'creating of' scenes.  Not as much as the regular DVD, but more than the BBC HD.

2744868,5,B000MR9D5E,"First and foremost, Planet Earth is absolutely remarkable. The technology and methods used to produce this series is unprecedented. I would find this series enjoyable in SD, but HD takes this to a whole new level. My experience with this series has been nothing short of outstanding.

I have just finished reading reviews by those who gave it low scores and I am not amazed by the stupidity inherent in common humans.

Most of the negativity reflected by those who actually were able to view the series is based upon the concept of ""predator and prey,"" which they view as ""cruel and disgusting.""

In response to these comments, let me first ask you this: when conservation is discussed, how do you not focus on predator and prey? As they both rely on each other for survival and sustainability, it seems obvious that any documentary would dedicate significants amount of time and effort into this apsect of life. What happens when the prey disappears? The predator also disappears, as it has no food. What happens when the predator disappears? The prey becomes over abundant and exhausts the resources necessary for its' survival, resulting in a significant decline in its' population.

To drive my point home, consider sharks. Sharks, as an apex predator, control the seas by regulating the abundance of its' prey. This system works itself all the way down to the bottom of the food chain, keeping all other subsequent ""predators and prey"" in check. This balance-and-check system has allowed life to remain sustainable since its' beginning. If the ""balance-and-check"" system is disturbed in a significant way, then massive extinction events result, especially when an apex predator is removed from the picture. Over time, the system recovers, but under a new apex predator that relies on new prey. Depending on who you talk to, sharks may be the reason why we even exist today. Because sharks as a whole are on the brink of extinction, we shall soon find out how important predation really is, especially considering that the amount of food we rely on for our survival come fromes the oceans they control.

So if predation is so ""cruel and disgusting"" why has it flurished for millions of years. When you find yourself so dissatisfied with this aspect of life, what were you planning on eating for dinner. And yes, plantlife is every bit alive as any other living organism, so saying you don't eat meat doesn't resolve the fact that you are disgusted with predation.

I think the thing you should be more disgusted with is humans. We are the smartest virus the world has ever seen...a cancer on a monumental scale. We grow, replicate, consume and destroy without consequence. All for selfish reasons. Families have 3,4,5 and 6 children, all because they ""want to."" All because its the right thing to do, right? Well, unfortunately, at some point in their life, you will have to tell them that its their responsibility to fix everything that mankind has done to destroy the world we live in. This task is so unfair, that they will pass it off onto the next generation, and so on, until it's too late for anything to be done.

We all want to live longer and healthier lives. We want to cure disease and not have to worry about dying from infections such as HIV, or bodily mishaps such as cancer. But when you think about why these things are so difficult to prevent and treat you must also ask yourself if we are even supposed to cure them. How do we know that they didn't develop for a reason. Maybe Earth, herself, brought this all about to cure her disease. Maybe she made them in a way as to prevent them from being cured. From her point of view, we are the disease, we are the HIV and we are the cancer. Maybe HIV, cancer, etc... is Earth's cure for mankind. The last time I checked, there was only one living organism that could go extinct and not have a negative impact on Earth. That organism is MANKIND!

And in the end, when its' all said and done, there is one thing to remember...there can be no life without death.",1203033600,,4026,4.684582743988685

For the most part the images are breathtaking.  How they captured some of the scenes I will never know, there are times (such as in Caves) the camera seems to float over areas that you know they couldn't do a fly over.

However, with those who have sensitive children (by that, I mean children who don't like to see other animals killed), I don't think this is the family-oriented show as some have said.  Every 10 minutes, there is one animal chasing another, either biting it to the point where you know what comes next, or being carried off to be eaten.  Although I agree this is a part of nature, judging from how my 9-year old sister seems to be acting after watching 2 episodes, I don't think this series is for them.

But 2 disks have some defects. The data must be currupted or some physical damage to disk. I saw lot of grainy screens every second (""off-and-on"" flicker) in some episodes. I double checked my BD Player (Sony) and TV (Sony 52W3000) are working fine. Especially Angel's water fall scene is completely distorted. I returned this product and waiting to see if somebody else has experienced this kind of problems. When I saw it at a local warehouse store, I did not see any problems and suspecting that this release must be having some manufacturing defects.

I am tired and this time, I will try to buy at a local warehouse or bestbuy even if I have to pay few bucks and taxes more.

2744959,3,B000MR9D5E,"With considerable anticipation, my wife and I bought the Plant Earth series and looked forward to increasing our knowledge. We both came away a bit disappointed as we felt the coverage was extensive, but shallow on details in many parts.

We were confused about where specifically the segment being viewed was located on the planet. In several instances the location was identified with local names that only a serious student of geography would recognize.

The weakest part of the series, in our opinions, was the lack of depth in the subject matter. We were left with the feeling that we saw only enough to illustrate the skill of the videographer and the triumph of catching very rare animals on disk. While this is admirable, it only touches a specific group of animals rather than the bulk of the population in a given area.

We also bought the Blue Planet series and were much more satisfied with that publication.

We have to admit, however, that Planet Earth was well done technically with some truly spectacular images, but little depth that left us hanging at times.

Now yes, I would have liked some extra bonus footage, but do you really want to take back the BlueRay HD for the regular DVD for that reason only? If you do you're crazy because the pictures in HD are 100 times better than you will see on standard DVD.

2744997,5,B000MR9D5E,"I bought this set for my dad as gift and we watched the first DVD (of 5 in the set) together.  I'm not necessarily a fan of wildlife documentaries but I was immediately hooked.  The camera work is incredible - they get impossibly close to the animals and show areas of the planet that few people will ever see (like massive underground caves!).  I found it very humbling to see how incredibly violent the animal kingdom is and how much man (the top of the food chain) takes for granted. There are many scenes of animals being killed by other animals but that's the brutal reality of our world. Despite these sad scenes, I believe that this would be an ideal series for schools to show in Science or Social Studies class.

Dumb as this sounds, watching these programs has left me in a bit of existential turmoil.  My measly 80-year life span is nothing in the greater scheme of things and all the problems I experience through my life are mostly self-made or imagined. It's a daily race against the grim reaper in the wild; always looking over your shoulder for predators and spending much of your day seeking your next meal or drink of water.  Most of us who live in the developed world can't imagine this life.  We're damn lucky and this series really brings that home.  We take so much for granted.

That being said the Blu-ray version of this series has its ups and downs.  Overall it is a fantastic experience with some truly breathtaking visuals that when seen in HD (especially full 1080p) are simply gorgeous.  What sound there is is done well enough, but let's face it, it's really all about the visuals, and while there an instances where it is incredible, there are also places on these discs where it is downright ugly.  Some of these scenes just have not made the jump to HD very well, coming out very grainy and with plenty of artifacting.  It's really very unfortunate since often these scenes are followed up directly by a scene shot in stunning detail that makes your jaw drop, which is why i can forgive it for the most part, because when taken as a whole, this series is simply amazing.",1201305600,,1002,4.50828729281768

The biggest difference that I noticed was that it doesn't have ""The Future"" episodes on the discs, like the Discovery versions do. It also only has narration by David Attenborough, and often times gives units of measure that I am not familiar with such as a hectare, sorry for being ignorant, but I don't have any idea what that is.

As many reviewers say, this documentary is very gorgeous(for the most part). One that you could use to show off your new HDTV. Its scope is very extensive and some of the wildlife footages have never been seen before.

The biggest gripe that i have about this transfer is that not all footage was shot in HD(As stated in the box). Also, some footages have a blinking sort of video noise(an example would be the footage of Angel falls on the first disc, 3rd episode). I've only seen the first disc but hopefully thats the only episode that has those imperfections.

Another reason why i gave it 4 stars is the lack of features. For a Blu Ray version, which boasts dual layer 50GB discs and a handful of ways to present special features, i was surprised to not find any. I heard Behind the scenes footage and another documentary was on the standard definition version.

 First of all, I am not one for watching nature documentaries, (can't stand all that blood and gore when a prey is caught and torn to bits) but I caught a glimpse of this series, when previewed on Oprah, and thought my hubby would like it, and got it for him. All I can say is that I was the one who devoured every minute of it. There was no gut-churning bloody imagery, so it was right up my alley and I was riveted.

 Every episode is packed with images so beautiful and breathtaking that it will leave you speechless by the splendor of it all. All I can say, if you're like me, give this a chance and watch it.

Whether Weaver or Attenborough, this is a spectacular series filled with stunning images from space, helicopters, airballons, and on ground and sea, using state-of-the-art cameras including some 1000 frames per second scenes and motion control systems.

Apart from the visuals the documentary is structured to explain some of the most interesting characteristics of some of earth's eco-systems with sumptuous detail and elegant and clear narration.

Not only is the picture quality amazing, it is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. An absolute must-see for anyone even remotely interested in our planet.

I watched the broadcast version in SD when it was being aired and obviously it is a completely different experience.

Absolutely unbelievable. So what are you waiting for!

BUY IT!",1199664000,,680,4.633333333333334
2745275,5,B000MR9D5E,This is an amazing series filled with an unbelievable and beautiful glimpse into mother nature.  Filmakers used state of the art technology to capture rare and never before seen footage.,1199664000,,186,5.2
2745276,4,B000MR9D5E,"In this film, one can see snap shots of a number of rare and near extinct animals.  BBC has utilized this opportunity to emphasize how human activities has endangered all sort of living organisms on earth.  This message is loud and clear.  It is a fabolous film to show during family gathering or to be used as educational tool for kids.

Different chapters are organized by habitates: deserts, rainforest, tundra, poles, caves...etc.  This organization allows the DVD to merge the knowledge of animals together with knowledge of geograhy into one relatively coherent film.  It might be a bit hard for kids to follow and to absorb 100% of material though.

I appreciate and the seperate part of documentation that details the challenges the crew faced.  The script in this part is a bit too hard sell for my taste, hence one less star.

Haven't view the discovery channel or national geography films that are similar, so no comment about which one is better.  However, with this one alone, I highly recommend this, especially if you have a high definition TV.",1199664000,,1059,4.833333333333333

The set was shrink-wrapped and looked new when I got it, so this could be a manufacturing error.  So make sure you check all of your discs for the Blu-Ray logo!

On the plus side, I did get to see some of the content that the high def. versions are missing because of this slip-up (I can't understand why this extra content was removed from the HD-DVD / Blu-Ray versions)...

From the songful sounds to the vibrant colors of the many areas on this planet, this series gives a different perspective of what is out there to enjoy. I would suggest this to anyone who would enjoy the many spendors of life and nature within this planet of ours.

As for the choice of HD or standard editions - I suggest buying the HD edition as there is a major difference in sound and picture. HD makes you feel as if you're watching this on the big screen and that you are surrounded by nature itself.",1199664000,,629,4.3760683760683765

I ended up missing some and this created the perfect opportunity to watch the ones I missed. This mini series is one of the best. The amount of time and energy the BBC put into this show is mind boggling. Some of the best parts of the show is the 10 minute behind the scenes after each show. I know discovery trimmed that down to like 1 minute, but here you have 10 full minutes. They take one particular shot that was hard to shoot and tell you all the hard work that went into getting that shot. This series is a must for any nature fan.",1199664000,,640,4.087301587301587

The photography is amazing, as is the color and the content!  My wish to the world is to make seeing the world  in a different way a requirement.  Schools could use the videos to promote ecology and awareness of the world around us.  Strangely, our dog plopped himself on the sofa and didn't take his eyes off the screen for an hour!

The photography is awesome and the detail in each of the subjects is amazing.  One scene on a mountain took over four years for a rare animal to show up...talk about dedication!

The PBS series featured Sigourney Weaver doing the narration here in the USA...the narration on the original BBC series is done by a British actor and is just as impressive.

I bought this video for my grandchildren.  They range in age from almost 4 to 14 and they are all riveted to the television when we show it to them.  I would highly recommend it for all ages!",1199664000,,650,4.420168067226891

I know some people prefer the Sigourny Weaver (sic) version over David Attenborough's because ... I'm not sure why? I've never felt like I was watching a stodgy science class documentary; the footage is so crisp, so amazing, so unreal that you can't be bored. Seriously.
Amazon was great on shipping two copies of these before Christmas Eve and I  haven't had any problems with the discs.

I like the BBC narrator a little better than the American gal, but be aware that all of the measurements are metric (ie. these grow to over 3 meters long. etc.) Also, as great as the shots are, they don't jump off of the screen like an HD-DVD would, but I think it would help if we hooked up the DVD player with an HDMI cable.

He loves it too. I was furious, however, to find out that this version is not narrated by Sigourney Weaver, whom I loved in the Discovery Channel version that they show in the States. If you want that version, go to Discovery Channel to buy it, Amazon doesn't seem to offer it. But the narrator for this BBC version is wonderful as well.",1199577600,,686,4.196969696969697

It is an amazing series, beautifully shot, commentary by a master in this field, David Attenbough, and the music from the BBC orchestra suits the films perfectly. Everyone I gave them too seemed genuninely over the moon to receive as a present. I bought one for myself too and watch it often.

Many of the images were highlighted with the fact that it was on HD.  I would highly recommend it to non-National Geographic buffs as well.

The producers did all they could to abstain from mentioning America, as if there's nothing really interesting going on in the USA. Filmed well but became preachy at the end (disc 5).  Also, the series often repeats itself throughout.  For example, the same talking heads appeared on every disk, reminding us how valuable resources were and how terrible the Americans were for not doing more.  OK, that was my opinion.  Bonus material at the end of each disk on how they captured the shots was spectacular. Worth it if you buy it half-price and skip the last disk.",1199491200,,656,4.678260869565217

He is older and garbles his words as if he has food in his mouth, and with the British accent on top of that he is much more difficult for my children to understand. That is the only reason I don't give this one 4 stars. If you can get the Weaver version, I recommend doing that. Otherwise this is a WONDERFUL documentary that my whole family LOVES. So well put-together and such amazing cinematography. Just disappointed not to hear Sigourney's voice -- nothing against Attenborough, who is a pioneer of nature documentaries, he just doesn't have the voice anymore. :)",1199404800,2,804,4.629370629370629

This HD DVD set is WELL worth the money and the camera follows the beautiful, fearful, bright, and dark ecosystems from pole to pole...continent to continent.

One thing i can't believe is all the small things i missed in the backgrounds and in the shadows. Blu-ray picks up the smallest things, and this set is just brought to life. There are some parts where i have actually had to pause it for a minute as i felt a little motion sick. You get this feeling of moving when they do sweeping shots, like the way imax makes you feel (just a little smaller). This series is one of the most amazing things to be filmed you can see why it took 5 years to film. A definate buy for all blu-ray owners.",1199145600,,847,3.9302325581395348

2745382,5,B000MR9D5E,"""Planet Earth"" offers spectacular, high resolution video of our planet's natural environments- ranging from the deepest oceans to the highest mountains, with everything in-between. If you watch Discovery Channel regularly, you will not believe how much better everything looks in near-panoramic HD quality.  With full surround sound, you get the impression of being right there in the action. I recommend this video even for those who do not regularly watch nature type programming, as the amazing HD quality makes you feel like you are on a real life adventure, and not just in a classroom learning about nature. This is truly what HD was made for, and if you already have HD, I highly recommend this video for your collection.",1199145600,2,728,5.066666666666666

2745476,4,B000MR9D5E,"If I could give this 4.5 stars, I would.  Everyone should, of course, buy this series and watch it over and over again.  But it is not the best nature documentary ever.  Just the best one now on Blu-Ray.

To be clear, I am a huge fan of David Attenborough's nature documentaries.  I have watched, multiple times, his Living Planet, Life of Birds, Life of Mammals, Life in the Undergrowth, Life in the Freezer, and Blue Planet series.  I probably have logged hundreds of hours watching them.  To my mind, there is no one alive--apart, perhaps, from E.O Wilson--who communicates enthusiasm for the natural world as effectively as Sir David.  I also have a long-standing interest, albeit an amateur one, in biology and evolutionary theory.  So in light of the abundance of 5-stars reviews, I expected to be blown away.  I was impressed, but not blown away.

In terms of eye-candy, Planet Earth is one of the best nature documentaries ever.  The footage of great white sharks is just jaw-dropping.  As is the footage of the fungus-infected ants, the birds-of-paradise, the bactrian camels, etc., etc.  They are things that only top-notch nature photographers, using top-notch equipment--and waiting days, weeks, or months for the perfect shot--could capture.  And in Blu-Ray, it is spectacular.

That said, there is some truth to other reviewer's complaints about video quality. The footage obviously was taken with different equipment, under different lighting conditions, using different technology, etc.  There are passages--especially low-light scenes--where there is visible noise.  And there are scenes where the producers obviously have used old footage that lacks the clarity of modern high-definition digital equipment.  To be fair, these scenes look bad only because the rest of the series looks so good.  Still, I'm not sure that I would choose Planet Earth to showcase the capabilities of Blu-Ray technology.  A recently produced studio movie--which has the luxury of being lit with artificial light--probably would show better detail.  As would a recent Pixar movie, like Cars or Ratatouille, that was originally rendered in 1080p or better.

The reason why I don't give Planet Earth five stars, though, is not because of its photography, which is first rate.  It is because the narrative lacks the depth and brio of other Attenborough series.  Much of this is because Sir David's role is limited to providing voice-over.  In prior series like ""Life of Birds,"" Attenborough appears on-camera, on-location, and provides lucid and personable explanations of interesting natural phenomena--with the animals he is discussing always close at hand.  Sir David is the perfect instructor.  He is urbane and literate, not afraid of getting dirty or putting himself in hazardous situations, and so infectiously enthusiastic about the subject matter that you just cannot stop watching.  Although Attenborough does the voice-over narrative in Planet Earth--at least in this version--he does not appear onscreen and, thus, most of his personal charisma is missing.  He just becomes another nature documentary narrator with a British accent.

It may seem an odd objection to a nature documentary that it lacks a human on-screen presence, but I think it is a valid one.  Having a human--whether Attenborough or someone else--physically present in the environment being discussed provides a sense of connection to an otherwise alien world.  It also provides useful perspective.  Being told the Saraha is 125 degrees in the shade is one thing.  Seeing a person panting and sweating in the heat is another.

In addition, the narrative in the ""Life of . . ."" series had much more depth than ""Planet Earth.""  While still being accessible to laypersons, the ""Life of . . . "" series spent more time on the fascinating biological details.  There, it seemed like the ""story""--i.e., the biological phenomena--was driving the enterprise.  Planet Earth, by contrast, seems much more driven by the images, and less interested in communicating anything of real scientific substance.  It reminded me a lot of ""Blue Planet.""  Gorgeous photography, but relatively little meat to it.

One final quibble: the orchestration in Planet Earth is too lavish and melodramatic for my tastes.  There are times when I just want to tell the BBC orchestra to ratchet it down a notch or two.  This is a nature documentary, for Christ's sake, not War of the Worlds.

In short, Planet Earth is a beautiful series and looks fantastic on Blu-Ray.  If you haven't done so already, you should hit the ""buy"" button.  But Planet Earth is not the be-all and end-all of nature documentaries.  Although they are not quite as visually arresting, the ""Life of . . ."" series are, overall, far superior documentaries.  Planet Earth is a gem, but a flawed one.",1198368000,10,4807,5.148578811369509

The shots of the animals is what amazed me. Both my son,(he's married to a vet and was once a elephant handler) and my daughter also a animal lover will surely enjoy this video.

He was watching it on TV and dragged her in to see it because he was so fascinated.  When his cousin saw that I bought it for him she was quite excited and I asked if she also enjoyed it.  She responded that she hasn't seen it either but when she gave her cousin a ride home for the holidays he raved about it for half the ride (an eight hour drive) so she was very interested in seeing it.

They covered a wide range of animals and typologies in the give time and space to do so.  I was not so sure on the chronological order of some of the scenes relative to one another, but that is minor.  What I did enjoy is the angle of the cameras and scenes, which is a little fresh to the genre, but not too much.  What I am disappointed is the HD presentation.  I don't think they used the latest and greatest HD cameras out there.  The scenes of some of shots varied greatly.  Some shots looked as great as all 1080 dpi, while other looked like DVD and even tape qualities at times.

I watched the whole series on DHD when it was broadcast and pre-ordered the hd-dvd version within 20 minutes of watching the first episode on tv.  It is just flat out, jaw dropping, awesome.  This is my reference DVD for my HD setup here at home.  Anyone that comes by and wants to see 'something good', I show them this.  The reaction is always the same.  The jaw drops and they sit there in amazement.  I suppose if you hate nature / animal type programs, this is not for you.  Otherwise, well worth the price.  Amazon is normally the cheapest place I have seen this set.  I've seen the same sets (bd and hd dvd) ranging from 79 to 99 bucks in the store, and they are worth it at that price.

Each episode of this series will bring you the most jaw-droppingly beautiful images, and you will often wonder how the cinematographer managed to capture unbelievably difficult shots with such superb quality. If you have a really large high-def screen, you are *guaranteed* to be blown away by this visual spectacle.

However, if you want more than just images, well, maybe this is not the series for you. If you can put up with David Attenborough's highly affected, pompous narration, you may be surprised by how inaccurate some of the information is. And if you know some of the information to be incorrect, you will be asking yourself how much of the rest of the information that was previously unknown to you is also inaccurate.

Here's an example from episode 3, ""Fresh Water"", approximately 35 minutes and 30 seconds into the video:

""Even for giant rivers like the Amazon, the journey to the sea is not always smooth or uninterrupted. Iguau Falls, on the border of Brazil and Argentina, is one of the widest waterfalls in the world, one and a half miles across.""

If you think that the capital of Brazil is Buenos Aires, go ahead and buy the video. But if you're not a geography ignoramus, you will know that the Amazon river crosses Brazil from west to east, far to the north, while Iguau Falls are located in the far south of the country and have nothing to do whatsoever with the Amazon region or river. Imagine listening to David Attenborough say that the Colorado River, after crossing the Grand Canyon, creates Niagara Falls...",1197590400,5,1599,4.76173285198556

I was totally blown away, not just by its unparalleled beauty, but by the fact that I couldn't watch more than 5 minutes without being astounded by something I'd never known anything about.

Their new technology allowed them to glimpse scenes of nature that would never have allowed a camera to come within range, like the family life of the rare, cliff-dwelling snow leopards, or the elusive camels of the Gobi dessert (who eat snow in a land of zero rainfall), or so many other forms of life I'd never known.

And it opened my eyes to forms of animal behavior I'd never imagined, like the intricate attack patterns packs of wild dogs whose movements are as well coordinated as if they all had walkie talkies, polar bears who try desperately to adapt to loss of ice in ways we never knew they could, or birds of paradise who transform themselves in unbelievable ways for their mating rituals.

I have to agree with some of the reviewers - the series is narrowly focused on the merciles brutality of the food cycle - fish eats fish in order to be eaten by a bigger fish.  I am not offended by the sight of carnivores feasting on their prey, but in the ovewhelming context the segment on the vegetarian panda was a refreshing break (I never liked the pandas before).  Yes, the piranhas can clean a fish in minutes, and therefore ...???

But I think this series does a great job of not anthropomorphizing the animals, not focusing on the cute and the cuddly and basically giving them names and inviting you to emotionally invest with them, right before having them die at the end!

We bought the DVD set and gave it to our son in honor of his eighth birthday. His birthday party was a few hours ago. Toys all forgotten, the family is still gathered around the television, exclaiming over the swift and deadly beauty of a great white shark attack, mourning for the baby elephant lost in a dust storm in an African desert, and getting a sense of the fundamental interconnectedness of all things as David Attenborough describes how the sun heats the sea and forms clouds that sweep inland and bring fresh water and therefore life to the whole earth.

It is a nature documentary, so be prepared for some scenes of live or recently live things being eaten, and also for a little eco-preaching, but the focus of the film is really the wonder of it all. Watching these programs is truly mind expanding. I am deeply grateful to the filmmakers who shared with the world these amazing things that otherwise we would never see.

2745630,1,B000MR9D5E,"Panoramic scenes of breathtaking beauty form the background of this remarkably dull yet amazingly cruel Series.

A true remake of Mondo Cane (1962), in this series, poor David Attenborough has the sad task of narrating the 'story' of each episode: inevitably about predators hunting other animals, eating them, killing weaklings and young.

The series is uninterested about the Planet Earth - you want to see more of it, but unfailingly the producers want to show you animals being eaten by predators, for they went to great trouble to film it and want you to see it.

Not how animals or birds live - but how they die.

Each kill is shown in sadistic detail, so that you can see the poor victim's last moments of pain and terror. You will soon see they or their chicks or cubs in their predators jaws still alive and then being dragged and killed - the camera will still linger long enough for you to see them eating their prey.

When you see an animal, any animal or bird - you already know that in a few moments time you will see their predators, time over time again this will be repeated.

In this series Animals are shown only this context: of killing and dying, for that is what interest the makers of this series , the killing of weak and young animals.

Nature is shown in short quick takes - monotonous text is reread by David Attenborough , for every episode is just a re-run of the previous one. They follow the same format. You saw one, you saw them all.

You wonder how the Producer of Blue Planet managed to create such a series.

Anything is better than this series.

2745652,2,B000MR9D5E,"WARNING SIGN: ""Spoilers"" abound. If you wish to preserve ""shark and awe,"" please read no further. This beautifully shot series captures images never seen and ones that will be lost forever. So much for virtues:

Planet Earth unrealistically emphasizes the dramatic, big, bloody, cutesy, sad, and cuddly. The eco-message doesn't make up for the superficiality.  For the most part Planet Earth, like Wild Kingdom,  seems most concerned with generating emotional responses in humans.

Most of the animals are depicted in a way that appeals to a hardwired emotion ""big,"" ""cute,"" ""cunning,"" fierce.""  As for how creatures evolved to be what they are and what makes them tick, we learn little or nothing. We learn a lot about animals killing and get killed.  Like ""When Animals Attack,"" Planet Earth shows us only the real world. This is the here and now, and these are the things that are happening, on the surface.  However, nature is infinitely more subtle and varied than the biggest flocks of birds, the scariest looking cephalopod, the biggest herds of grazers, the big cats bringing down an elephant, the big fish eating the seals, and the sad or cute little dramas that serve as appetizers or desserts to the real action.

The helicopter just happens to be hovering overhead at the right moments for encounters between sharks and seals. Of course that's  representative - sharks eat seals. For example, if one dropped a seal into the water from a helicopter I have no doubt that a shark evolved to eat seals would indeed eat it. We are equally interested to witness the random encounter between komodo dragon and anaconda but of course that would be non-credible. Charlton Heston fought the army ants. Charlton Heston fought the talking apes. These are fascinating encounters, but did either happen exactly that way? I have no information about the Planet of the Apes. However, army ants ARE found in South America, so what's the harm of showing what would happen if they attacked a ranch and Charlton Heston had to defend it. And the pathos. The mother defends her eggs, baby etc. but predator gets the eggs, baby, etc. In a tear-jerker ""Dumbo"" the baby becomes separated from Mommy elephant. Poor baby follows her tracks - the wrong way. Planet Earth is on the spot to film yet another dramatic incident. Perhaps inspired by Star Fleet's Prime Directive they keep hands off as the sad drama unfolds. Or do they? I was surprised not to see the brutal conclusion.

In almost all other instances ones two minute attention span is amply rewarded. An antelope escapes Cape Hunting dogs, causing an uneasy moment as it swims in a lake ( during which time we are reassured that sooner or later it must emerge. Tick-tock, more footage of antelope swimming). Not to worry! Within a minute, and against production deadlines as we are told in the Commentary, a dead antelope mysteriously turns up. Against all odds the footage of the dogs ripping it apart is captured. We are told the Cape Hunting dogs have to kill once a day to survive. Well, maybe that's just untrue but the point is that nature is ""kill or be killed."" As Dan Ackroyd said in ""Trading Places."" But not really.

In the Simpson's, the Troy McClure-narrated video explains the ""Food Chain."" The ape reaching for a banana is itself snatched by a shark. My children understood immediately that they were watching a parody of the natural world, in this case as brought to them by the Meat Council.",1194566400,22,3454,4.8175675675675675

David Attenborough has a soft voice, much like a story telling passing along history. Thats all well and good however i don't think it fits the series. This is a modern film not a documentary, designed to inspire people and open eyes, while Sigourney Weaver may not have been the best choice, she is better as her voice is more bold and dramatic where as David Attenborough sounds like he is gasping for air. His voice lacks authority.

2745709,3,B000MR9D5E,"First, when this DVD looks good, it looks better than almost anything I've ever seen. The first episode is jaw-droppingly spectacular and the shots from space are unbelievable.  The whole concept, narration, music, direction, etc., is really staggering.  BUT starting with the Angel falls scene on the second disc there seems to be a serious technical problem.

If you cruise through the multitude of rave reviews on this site, you'll notice several that talk about recurring problems with noticeable graininess, flickering snow, and/or pixel breakup in scenes with low light or shadowed landscapes.  All of those people - including me - seem to have high end, 1080p flat-screens, players and cables.  Several reviewers single out the same scenes, for instance, the shadowed parts of the mountain around Angel Falls in the second episode, so we're not making this up.

Several readers have responded with ""explanations.""  One guy said that he read on a Blu-Ray blog that it was some kind of camera interference encountered while filming the series.  It wasn't noticed until after the crew returned to the studio, and they cleaned it up as best they could.  Another said to try new cables.  Another DID try new cables and it didn't help.  Another said to REDUCE the resolution (isn't high definition the reason that we HAVE these things in the first place?).  But I don't think any of these explanations take into consideration why so few people are noticing the problem.

I can only think of two options here:  1) Either there is a transfer/coding/compression problem with every single copy of the series that is only visible to detail-oriented watchers with really high-end equipment; or 2) There is a bad batch of DVDs out there, and some of us were unlucky enough to buy one.  (Note:  I tried two copies of Planet Earth (from the same retailer) and had to return both of them because of this weird, but consistent, technical problem.)

Several reviewers state that the Discovery Channel Blu-Ray version of Planet Earth, with Sigourney Weaver narrating, doesn't have this problem, BUT the resolution is 1080i, not 1080p.

I find this particularly frustrating because of the high-level production values and the truly amazing images that were captured for this ground-breaking series.  Hopefully, they'll get the bugs ironed out eventually.",1193184000,9,2341,5.097112860892389

It's the first DVD I've seen that actually made me want to buy an HD-DVD player and HD-TV. The visuals are so crisp and full of color that I don't think it is as fully experienced on a regular DVD as it could be in high def.

That said, this looks amazing and (once again) the BBC have filmed locales and animals for the first time. Rarely will you see something you know through and through . . . unless you live, literally, in the desert or in a caves. Even then, the cameramen (and women) find ways to get to places rarely seen by the human eye.

As usual, David Attenborough and the BBC have put together a package that is not only visually stunning, but fosters a new look on the lives we live and our place in this beautiful chaos. This is something that documentaries rarely do and I put most of Attenborough's work on the level of Carl Sagan's ""Cosmos"" and Planet Earth is not an exception.

I miss seeing him poking around in the woods, whispering to us about the habits of the creature he is showing us.  I miss his love of nature. This seems to be aimed at those with a short attention span. Its flits from a satellite image to shots from a helicopter, to a creature and then is gone onto something else. I am left with more questions than I find answers. For example, in the Desert episode, we see really amazing images from the Sonoran Desert, then we skip to a satellite image of Utah where there is a quip about there not being much life there and then we are off to see some Nubian Ibex. We don't even get to find out where the ibex are. On the one hand, every image we are presented with is exquisite but on the other, I feel short changed on the intellectual side.

Definitely worth the money in terms of being able to see the earth as you probably never would otherwise.  The only downside I see is that the series is really geared more towards showing the whole earth and therefore does not go very deep into any one subject/area.  Just as you are getting into a particular environment, the scene changes to a completely different area and it leaves you feeling a little short changed.  Perhaps I am too used to watching 1 hour nature specials that delve much deeper into one subject, but I just feel that this series fails to really connect with the viewer in a certain way.  Overall though, I still think it is an incredible series that has done a great job in displaying the absolute beauty of nature.",1191024000,,861,4.6381578947368425

But there's a lesson or two to be learned. First, patience and fortitude pay off - it took thousands of hours of initial research, and then searching and finding the perfect images (e.g. 55 days in a hide waiting for a male bird of paradise to dance for his mate).

The first two episodes contained quite a few predator scenes that may not be suitable for young children.  In fact, I was quite surprised at how many hunting scenes were shown, although it is nature, and that's the way things are in the wild.

I preferred the scenic episodes.  The shots of the mountains, deserts, valleys and glaciers were spectacular.  A few times per episode, less than high definition footage was added to fill in some gaps, and it's very obvious when viewed from a large, 1080P plasma like mine.  Most of the audio was amazing.  There were a few dubbed-in sounds (to complement footage filmed by helicopter) that were unnecessary.  All in all, a very good documentary.  Four stars.",1190419200,2,859,4.736486486486487

2745878,5,B000MR9D5E,"To their credit, the producers of Planet Earth give viewers the opportunity to get a glimpse of the stunning beauty of (what is left of) the natural world that is inaccessible to most humans.  Planet Earth producers explore the different natural habitats such as the seas, caves, great plains, and forests in the first four discs.  Thanks to the BBC, the producers have been able to mobilize top-notch talent and state-of-the-art equipment to accomplish this tour de force.

Like other media productions made about the natural world over the last 30 years, Planet Earth helps raise awareness about nature's beauty and diversity as well as the human footprint on nature.  One of the greatest merits of the series is to market the huge economic value of the environmental services that nature renders scot-free to humanity, e.g., pollinating, cleaning water, cleansing the atmosphere, and restoring soil.

But there is a downside to Planet Earth's accomplishment.  Jonathon Porritt, Chair, U.K. Sustainable Development Commission, rightly states in disc five that natural history programming has turned most viewers into passive voyeurs of nature rather than engaged co-habitants with nature.  That type of programming can give people the false impression that because nature is captured on film, it is all okay out there.

To their chagrin, Planet Earth producers knew that what they were capturing on film was often disappearing under their eyes. Russell Mittermeier, President, Conservation International, reminds his audience that Antarctica aside, only a quarter of the Earth's land surface is still wilderness.  For example, James Leape, Director General, WWF International, point outs that about half of the world's forests have already been lost.  Another example is that more and more species such as the Amur leopard, Walia Ibex, Saiga antelope, and Bactrian camels are on the edge of extinction because of their human predators.

However, not everything has yet been lost.  As Jeffrey McNeely, Chief Scientist, World Conservation Union, observes, about 12% of the land cover is protected area.  To compound the challenge of environmental protection, M.A. Sanjayan, Lead Scientist, The Nature Conservancy, adds that 80% of the world's biodiversity does not exist in national parks.

To their credit, the producers of Planet Earth raise one controversial issue after another about nature conservation in disc five which is by far the most important of all five discs.  Here follow a few examples for illustration purposes only:

1) Narrator Simon Poland provocatively asks the question:  Is conservation only a wealthy Western concern, a luxury, a fantasy?  Mittermeier acknowledges that wilderness protection, which was born in the West, has not necessarily spread worldwide.  As Doctor Craig Packer, Ecologist, bluntly puts it, people who have high environmental ethics will have to put their money where their mouth is.  Packer correctly points out that they will have a hard time convincing local people who have to feed themselves and their family that they can eat ethics.  In Costa Rica, there are companies that are charging their customers an extra fee for the water bill they pay in order to compensate the farmers for the 300,000 hectares that they convert back to forest beyond the 500,000 hectares of national parks.  Forests are water factories.

2) Poland also asks the non-PC question: Is population the greatest threat to wilderness?  It is no coincidence that the natural world shrinks as human population grows.  Ignoring population strikes Porritt as the biggest own goal that the environment movement has ever scored.  There are currently over six billion people on this planet; the number is expected to grow to nine billion by the middle of this century.  These people need to be fed.  In order to feed those people, humans need to convert some nature to agriculture, preferably where they destroy the least biodiversity as Jan Kees, Director of Sustainable Agriculture, Unilever, observes with much wisdom.  Porritt correctly notes that good family planning is all about empowering women and girls with literacy and better healthcare to bring birth rates down.  Porritt controversially adds to his comment that the world's main religions have been pathetically disengaged in the area of nature preservation.  World's main religions have to figure out how to reconcile the primacy of life with the preservation of (God's) creation.

3) Poland raises another heretical issue: How to reconcile a conservation vision with a world based on Western lifestyles?  Doctor Robert Watson, Chief Scientist World Bank, thinks that the bigger threat to the environment is not population increase, but the growth in human economy and the way humanity uses its wealth.  Peyton Knight, National Center for Public Policy Research, argues that sustainable development is environmentalists' very clever term to mean no development.  Sanjayan acknowledges that Western environmentalists cannot go to developing countries and tell them that they cannot get what rich countries already have in terms of development.  These are real human aspirations for Western lifestyles that cannot be stopped, but at best redirected in a less destructive way.

Perhaps, the only major critique that could be leveled against Planet Earth is the dearth of emphasis on individual accountability.  Corporations, in which many viewers own shares, have as primary mission to turn a profit and pay shareholders for the risks taken.  Companies cannot be expected to bear alone the brunt of the costs of fixing environmental ills.  Too often, there is a gap between what consumers say about their willingness to pay more for greener products and services and how they really behave in the marketplace.

To summarize, Planet Earth gives viewers a holistic view of nature conservation that figures among the best out there.",1188864000,14,5907,5.3495670995671

They were able to make this so profound that when the narrators voice says at one point, ""this is the first time this has ever been recorded"" you cant help but get chills.
  One of my favorite things about this series is that its not afraid to show you sad things as well but present them in a meaningful way (dont tell me the sight of the mortally wounded polar bear didn't bring a tear to your eye.)

2745898,4,B000MR9D5E,"The BBC's Planet Earth is a treat for the senses and a television milestone. The series was five years in the making with forty camaramen filming in two hundred locations. This is an exquisite view of our planet and its creatures.

The eleven episode series starts with From Pole To Pole. This episode acts as both introduction  to the series and as a sort of greatest hits disc as it follows the seasons and their effects around the globe. The ten episodes that follow take on the various habitats of the planet and their creatures: the mountains, fresh water, caves, deserts, ice worlds, great plains, jungles, the shallow sea, the seasonal forests and finally the deepest oceans.

Not only is the high definition picture spectacular so is the audio. The score by George Fenton is easily worth the price of the discs. If there is a downside to this set its that the Blu-ray discs do not include the supplemental material that is included in the lower priced standard definition edition. All in all about 250 minutes of footage has been excluded. It is hoped that this problem will be corrected in later editions.

As noted above the picture quality is spectacular and the series is well worth watching. I've noticed some reviews complaining of the David Attenborough narration but I feel that this original voiceover is the way to go. For years Attenborough has been the voice of the BBC's Natural History Unit and his voice adds much to the presentation.

The Blu-Ray set worked fine on my Sony Player. I did not encounter any of the problems faced by some who have purchased the HD version of the series. One would hope that this problem will soon be corrected as well. It should be noted that the menu selections are a little quirky but nothing that can't be dealt with.

Well worth the investment. Kudos to the BBC for bringing such a great series to its viewers. One can only ask where do they go from here?

Brilliantly explained and explores areas of the world unfamiliar to the majority of viewers. Unfortunately, as is the trend with most of Sir Attenborough's productions, there has to be a scene in every episode where one poor animal meets a violent or heart-wrenching death, complete with dramatic background track.

2745920,5,B000MR9D5E,"I've got a HD DVD player but there has only been one album that I've bought for my collection (Batman Begins).  Everything else has been rental through Netflix and the local Blockbuster.

Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series has become the second HD DVD to be added.  And despite its $100 retail price, it is worth every single penny.

I did originally rent this from Netflix and had read all the reviews on this product and was anxious for it to arrive.  Unfortunately I ran into two problems.

The first was that there is a patch that is required in order to make this run on my HD DVD player that is attached to my XBox 360.  There were some user comments on this web site on how to patch the XBox 360 if you don't have XBox Live so if you are having the same problem, check out the comments.  The patch fixed things right away.  (Thanks, Amazon!).

The second problem was that my family wasn't interested in watching it with me.  ""We don't want to watch some nature program,"" they said.  Well, I basically forced them to watch it with me anyways.  After the first episode was finished my family was in love with it as much as me.  In fact, my son said, ""We should watch an episode every night until we finish it.  Maybe even two episodes.""

Not only have we enjoyed watching this movie almost every night but we have shown it to several of our neighbors and watched a few episodes with many of the kids in our neighborhood.  I've yet to run into somebody who loves this series.

There are so many good things about this album I'm not sure where to begin.  Probably just how beautiful it this video is, especially since everything is in crystal clear high definition.  After all, the planet earth is not too exciting in regular television so in high definition it makes you feel like you are there.  High definition is also very bright and colorful which makes everybody sit there oo-ing and awe-ing the entire time.

Also, it is very interesting and fascinating.  This isn't your standard nature show, you actually get to see things that you've never heard of or seen before.  Monkey's who swim for food, bears who live high in the mountaintops searching under rocks for moths to eat, and a bird who actually cleans up his area and does the wildest and funny dance for his potential mates (that was our favorite part).

This covers everything from pole to pole, to the highest mountains to the lowest valleys and caves in the earth.  You'll laugh, you'll probably even cry when you see some animals fall victim to their predators, you'll be amazed as what is out there on our planet, and you'll want to watch each episode over and over again.

Most of my reviews end with who would like a certain product and possibly who wouldn't like the product.  This is a rare one... I recommend this to EVERYBODY and can't think of anybody who would not find this a fun and wonderful video.  David Attenborough is a wonderful guide as you experience planet earth in a way you never have before.",1188000000,19,2989,4.46309963099631

2745922,5,B000MR9D5E,"As a documentary, Planet Earth may not be perfect but it comes close. As a spectacle, its simply spectacular. More importantly, you don't mind its sleight-of-hand and occasional vagueness in the commentary because you are almost constantly overwhelmed with the quality of the image, the novelty of the presentation and the technical wizardry associated with various time-lapse sequences, for example.

And even if the commentary sometimes has the weakness of most nature documentaries (serious but long discussions essentially setting the stage for the money shot, typically a top predator making minced meat out of fluffy), it still manages to interest consistently, not just with sights of almost extinct animals but also with rarely seen, beautiful footage (swimming monkeys, blooming baobabs at night, water returning to the parched savanna...).

So what if you hear one time more than necessary about the greatest migration ever (fill in appropriate species), the percentage of the earth covered by the geographic topic-du-jour or the fact that the animal on screen is invariably a (fill in appropriate moniker)-specialist ?

You will see a lot that is not banal, not seen before, and certainly not like this.

In addition, this Blu-Ray transfer honors the new high definition format. When you purchase a Blu-Ray drive -and I imagine an HD-DVD too- it does not take long to realize that many commercial discs have a quality barely better, if at all, than regular DVD. In particular, if you own a now relatively standard DVD with up-conversion, your standard DVD discs will look very good. In many cases, a good standard DVD, upconverted, will look as good or better than a so-so BD.

Not so with Planet Earth on Blu-Ray. To put it simply, if you are new to high-definition, you have never seen this before. This is not a feeling you will automatically have with all BD releases. And once the technical magic has sunk in, you are still left with a lot of new images, and food for your thought.",1188000000,2,1997,5.003012048192771

Watching this is not a passive experience, as you are drawn into, and fascinated by what you see.  In addition some of the technology used  is new.  High definition cameras, underwater cameras close up cameras filming a single ant being attacked by a parasite.  Aerial cameras making it possible to film huge migrations, and even see the strategy and teamwork of the rare African hunting dog.  Perhaps the greatest is the ultra slow motion cameras used to show the great white shark,

Highlights for me:

 A pride of lions hunting down an elephant in the dark.  This can only be shown on infrared cameras.

A great white shark catching a seal in ultra slow motion, at 1/40th of actual speed.  An awesome sight to behold.

African hunting dogs in action. These guys execute their mission with military efficiency.

A pack of chimpanzees ambush a rival band.  A shocking attack perfectly narrated.  I forgot they were animals for a minute. Civil war is not just a human concept.

Very rare footage of a snow leopard hunting.

Wolves chasing caribou filmed from the air.

A polar bear takes on a band of walruses with surprising results.  I had to look at this several times.

People parachuting into a gaping black hole 400 meters deep.

Penguins socializing and walking along like people chatting.

Courtship displays of the birds of  paradise.

Planet diaries featuring the challenges of the film makers enhances this set, and you appreciate the patience and dedication of the filmmakers, risking their sanity, and sometimes their lives filming some of these dangerous creatures.  The Planet Diaries segment about dangerous and hungry polar was eerily reminiscent of Timothy Treadwell in Grizzly Man.

I don't understand how people who purchased this set rated it low because they had compatibility issues (ie. not knowing you need a HD-DVD player to view HD-DVDs).

The animal footage is superb and the variety of environments explored was expertly filmed using appropriate techniques, yielding a clean picture.  One cautionary note is that the stories in each episode portray the circle of life and the foodchain, sometimes quite violently.  For people who can handle the reality of nature, this is a fascinating glimpse into these intricate systems.  One criticism is that the commentary is occasionally cheesy and repetitive.  However, there are jokes embedded and David Attenborough delivers the text well.  The diaries sections are particularly interesting since they highlight the difficulties of filming in different areas and place the environments in a greater context.  Overall, the viewer can expect to finish the series with a greater understanding and appreciation of the shifting global environment and awe of the complexities of nature.",1187395200,,950,5.510344827586207

The best parts are mesmerizing photography and never-before seen images of animals and/or behavior.  The worst parts are gross overuse of superlatives in the narration and a few contradictory statements that lead to confusion.  The image resolution on a 17-inch high-end notebook screen is below par compared to other commercially-produced DVDs regardless of software.

We put it on at dinner time but forgot to eat as scene after scene stunned us. Throughout the first two segments of the first disk as each new scene came onto the screen you could hear, ""wow"", and ""Oh"", and ""amazing"" spoken out loud in the living room. The new world is very very good. I highly recommend this disk set. It is educational, vivid, stunning, and wonderful. They must have spent weeks to capture the Great White coming out of the water with a seal in its mouth, coming clean out of the water in the process.

So I had to buy one (amazon has a great one) THEN my 2 year old Sony High Def TV doesn't have a HDMI hook up which is ALSO important for direct streaming....SO before you buy the HD version, do your homework or the frustration will be overwhelming, due to the wait. When I FINALLY was able to hook up, turn it on, and play...I had a defective set. Amazon was FAST to replace it, no questions. The series is awesome and worth the price.

2745978,5,B000MR9D5E,"This is an awesomely spectacular portrait of our planet. The cinematography will leave you breathless.  You will view incredible landscapes and fascinating wildlife that will leave you mesmerized. And that's not an exaggeration!

The latest technology in filming was used to make this documentary. Special cameras mounted on airplanes or helicopters can film animals kilometers away in amazing detail and resolution, thus never interfering with their natural behavior. In fact, the wild life would not even know of the presence of the film crew. Cameras were also placed on gliders, balloons, special winches...in order to bring to us the spectacular imagery. The series were filmed in high definition, so if you have the right equipment at home, I highly recommend you purchase the HD version. You'll be blown away!

Some places on our planet are so remote that they are unchartered and untouched by humanity. There thrive animals and plants so diverse, astonishing, and beautiful that we get a first hand sense of the miracle of life. Many of the species and their behavior were never filmed before. Sadly, though, these places together with their wildlife are disappearing at an alarming rate due to the damage we are doing to our world. Many of the species encountered in this series might very well be seen for the last time. Snow leopards, living at the foothills of the Himalayas, are so rare now that only 40 are assumed to be living today. They are such beautiful cats, and very rarely seen. In fact, the crew of Planet Earth had to spend a few months searching for them in order to film them.

There are 5 DVDs in all, with each one containing three episodes. The theme song is beautiful, and appropriate to the grandiose imagery in this documentary.

You will travel to the North Pole and visit, among other species, the white polar bear. You will witness a polar bear emerging from hibernation with its two cubs. What a beautiful shot that was. Together with their mom, the cubs slide down, for the very first time, a steep snow slope and make their way to the sea in search of food. Not all cubs survive their journey to the sea. With food scarce, polar bears are displaying unusual behavior. Being excellent swimmers, they now have to venture far in deep sea in order to find food. With the icecaps melting, there is no resting place for the polar bears out in the open sea, and many end up drowning. As a result, polar bears are becoming extinct.

In Antarctica, you will visit the penguins, and spend a full season with them while they care for their eggs. Penguins have a peculiar habit.  The female penguins lay their eggs, and then hand them over to the male to keep them in a pouch close to their feet. The female Penguins then travel out to sea to gather food for their soon to be babies, while the male penguins keep the eggs warm throughout the season until the eggs hatch. To keep warm, the penguins change positions, with those in the outer layer of the group slowly making their way inwards to the warmer areas in the center of the group, only to slowly make their way out again to make room for other penguins. In this way, all get the chance to warm themselves up. This behavior is quite fascinating to watch. The Planet Earth crew actually lived the whole season with the penguins in order to film that footage.

Watching the penguin eggs hatch was worth every penny of this series. Soon thereafter the female penguins return, their stomachs full of fish for their newborn. At this time, the male penguins reluctantly hand over the newborn to their mothers. The male penguins carried the eggs and cared for them for a whole season, and it is not easy for them to give them up to their mothers. These scenes show the love animals have towards each other. Many argue that killing animals is justified since animals are not intelligent beings. But how about love? Can we indiscriminately kill animals that display love? In animals, is intelligence more important than love for vice versa?

Mountainous areas are fascinating, with fascinating and unique wildlife. Some animals are better mountain climbers than the best of us, climbing and living on steep slopes that only a few climbers, with special equipment, can reach. Yet such animals are also becoming extinct as their habitat is slowly being destroyed by us.

There is some amazing footage of great white sharks leaping out of the water at great speeds (breach) to catch seals. Seals are however very agile, and many escape. It is just amazing watching the great white shark trying to catch a seal. Those scenes are unique and will leave you truly mesmerized at the wonder of the planet's wildlife.

Forests are another wonder of our planet, with millions of life forms dwelling in them. With the destruction of these forests, the life they contain is also being destroyed. Many such life forms are still unknown to scientists, and will probably never be known. Many of these species carry cures to existing and yet unknown diseases. Trees also produce oxygen, lots of oxygen, without which, needless to say, we would reach the next life sooner than expected, and probably be very unwelcomed.

Caves also offer us a glimpse at some amazing creatures. It is likely that life on other planets exist, for on our planet, organisms survive in extreme areas such as in very hot temperatures underground near lavas or extremely cold environments like in ice caps or deep under the sea. Many of these places you will probably only see on your TV screen, for they are pretty harsh environments to visit. Being a couch traveler is sometimes necessary, and fun.

The episode on shallow seas was also spectacular, but that habitat too is being destroyed by overfishing and by tourists. When you visit your friend's house, do you throw garbage on the floor? Do you break his furniture, plates, and glasses? We should show the same courtesy and care while visiting the wild habitats of our fellow life forms. We are as much dependent on them as they are on us.

At the end of each episode is the Planet Earth Diary, showing how the episode was filmed. It is really an adventure to film these episodes, and the diaries are just as fascinating as the series. A lot of patience, I mean really lots of patience was needed to film some of the shots in the series. Staying three months outdoors just to film a certain species was not unusual. This patience also demonstrates how rare some of the species have become. Lucky are the ones who can actually see them.

The DVDs also contain three episodes on the future of our planet. There are some really interesting ideas on how to save the species on our planet form extinction. One such idea seems too science fiction: sending lions to the moon! Scientists are now collecting genetic material from different species in order to preserve them for a future time when it will be possible to clone them. However, by that time, their habitat would have been destroyed in order to sustain the ever increasing human population. Some scientists believe that it will be possible in the future to send the cloned animals to other planets to live in remote and unchartered wilderness like their ancestors! What a fascinating concept!

Some scientists though believe in a more realistic solution. One solution is to bring down the human population to a more sustainable half a billion to a billion people. Presently our population is 7 billion, and increasing. If the standard of living of the entire population of the planet were to be raised in order to equal that of the United States, three planets would be necessary in order to sustain us!

One solution to reducing our population is by limiting the number of children families can have and by the use of birth control and sex education. Interestingly, the largest families are in the poorest regions of the world!

Presently, 80% of the world population lives at under $2 a day. How can you ask these poor people to preserve their environment when they have barely enough to feed themselves? Will you destroy a forest in order to gather wood and clear land for animal domestication in order to feed your children, or will you preserve the forest and its wildlife but have your children starve to death?

If we do succeed in ending world poverty by 2050 as Muhammad Yunus, the 2006 Nobel Laureate, hopes to do (read Banker to the Poor), what will this mean to our environment? If we succeed in that target, we will have 80% of our population consuming at twice or more the present rate.

In Collapse, Jared Diamond believes societies collapse due to the destruction of their immediate environment. He cites several examples of societies in the past that collapsed due to the destruction of its environment. One such case is the Easter Island society. Its population destroyed all its forest in order to build huge monuments. As a result, the wild life that came with the forest also disappeared, leaving the population starving to death! The Mayan civilization was another example of a society collapsing due to damage to its environment.

Will such a fate befall our next generation? How can we make the poor richer but somehow ask them to consume less while we consume more? The series will leave you with many unanswered questions. Our planet is spectacularly beautiful, but can we save it, and thus save ourselves?

What makes these series unique is that many of the unchartered places and wildlife you will see will not exist for our next generation. Our generation will probably be the most vilified of all generations for having destroyed our beautiful and diverse planet!",1186704000,6,9636,4.760934691431995

The visuals all seem identical to the American Discovery Channel version, but I think David Attenborough definitely trumps Sigourney. Not only is his voice better, but it feels like he's a bit more verbose (although I haven't gone back to compare) - it sounds like he's giving more information.

The quality of the HD-DVD is great too, far better than the Discovery HD ones that aired on cable. I especially notice better quality in the fast moving scenes that got blocky on digital cable, but there is generally more detail in all the shots.

1.  The balance between D.A.'s voiceover and the music was WAY off.  Granted, my DVD player isn't the greatest, but it plays movies just fine.  On this DVD, especially on the first disc, you really couldn't understand most of what Attenborough was saying.  Unless, you turned the volume up so far the music blew you out of the room.  For some reason, this was not as bad on subsequent discs.

2.  The box says ""5 disc set"" or some such.  The 5th DVD was a propaganda piece on ""Global Warming"" -- not information, just opinion.  So what you really get is a 4 disc set plus some BS.",1186444800,4,626,4.273504273504273
2746002,5,B000MR9D5E,"The photography and narration are among the best I have seen for this type of film, and I watch a lot of them. My only complaint, and its a small one, is in the extras portion. Where they show you the inner work required to get particularly hard shot (shown at the end of each episode). Some of the stuff they say seems a bit sensationalist ""Hollywood"". The team's commitment to get tough shots certainly comes through, but really, can we be honest about how difficult the shots actually were to get?

I'm not saying I don't enjoy a little follow up story and learning more about how you managed to get such amazing shots. However, are we really supposed to believe you are the first ever to capture a live perona feeding frenzy on tape? So your team had a tough time finding perona's to tape. People in that region find them quite regularly. So I find the claim that you had a crazy struggle strange and a distant possibly. Not to mention that I have seen no less that 3 other live perona attacks on film. Most of which seemed more authentic, one of which captured the last few minutes a some slow large animal who picked the wrong spot to cool off at. However, you appear to have thrown a dead fish in for them to eat, but I could be wrong.

Regardless, I enjoyed these DVD's so much that I more than willing to mark that up to a little sensationalism. Its just that Planet Earth can stand on its own without bogus jibber jabber.",1186358400,2,1431,4.315985130111524

Not bad really, but not what I was expecting, his accent is thick and the dialog for him was different. The scenes were the same but he would describe them differently and coldly.  Where he was very scientific and stand-off-ish, Sigourney was straight forward and sounded like she was speaking relaxingly to you, not a preaching scientist.

My wife and kids are equally enthralled; when teenagers request that we watch a nature documentary, you know it has to be really, really good.  My personal opinion is that this series shouldn't even be shown in standard-definition; many of the scenes (particularly the wide-angle aerial shots) require the fine detail of HD DVD to be of value.

It's nice to see the special effects of the usual guns'n'bombs'n'cars movies in 1080p, but this series takes full advantage of the medium and uses it for something worth seeing more than once.

[A note to potential purchasers: if you're not certain whether or not you have a HD DVD player, you probably don't.  This HD DVD series requires a true HD DVD player, not an upconverting DVD player.  They are not the same thing; HD DVD is far more advanced, but many of the HD DVD discs will not play in the 'old-style' DVD players.]",1186185600,,949,4.686746987951807

2746020,5,B000MR9D5E,"When Discovery HD Theater broadcast the Planet Earth series over the course of 5 weeks, my wife and I tuned in religiously every Sunday night to soak in the brilliance of the show.  Much has been said about this show's quality, so I won't go much further.

The Complete Series on HD-DVD gives you all 11 episodes completely uncut.  When rewatching the series, I was amazed at how much Discovery had to cut out of the original program due to time constraints.  It was like watching a completely new episode every time.  And this show is what High-Def is all about.  The HD-DVD completely blows away any overly compressed and lossy broadcast signal could provide.  Being able to soak in the amazing images in full High-Def is incredible.

The only knock is that BBC inextricably decided to deprive the HD versions  of this set of any special features.  You would think that for a series that was touted as pioneering High-Definition filmmaking, they would've given the HD version the special treatment.  But for some reason the extras are exclusive to the DVD version.  This is a pretty big letdown, but I still have to rate the set highly due to the quality of the program itself.",1186099200,3,1179,4.669902912621359

The actual content of the disc is amazing, you will see stuff in this program that you have never ever seen in your entire life.  Amazing pictures and direction. The content is a A+

On to the bad stuff.  There must be a lot of people watching this on 720p and 1080i displays, because if you have a HDTV like this there isn't much a problem.  However if you have a sweet 1080p TV, like my 46 inch Samsung watch out!  For some reason when playing in 1080p you get this snowy effect on some dark areas like caves and shadows of mountains.  This is directly from a bad transfer of the disc.  If you watch in a lower resolution, turn off your DNIe setting or watch it in movie setting you don't have this problem however its because you are not getting it in as good as detail as you should.  And when you watch it on such a large display in high resolution, the snowy flashing REALLY stands out in the scenes were the conversion got messed up.  The reason why this is probably only 66 dollars is because they know of the flaw.  Ive heard the American Discovery HD version will fix this.  Probably best to save your money and buy the 100 dollar version when it comes out later this year, but be sure to look for a review to see if they fixed the 1080p fiasco.",1186099200,,1454,4.179856115107913

I absolutey fell in love with the series on Discovery HD Channel through Comcast and wanted to see the highest resolution images of this series possible on our new 1080P LCD.  However, I am very disapointed in the grainy/snowy picture, which displays on my brand new Sony 40"" 1080P TV via HDMI cables.  I have to crank down the TV sharpness to 2/3rds to obscure the grain.  Picture was actually worse than the Discovery Channel HD recording, which is compressed, in 1080i and using the same HDMI cables to the TV.  I initially played it on the Sony PS3, which has some limitations, but it was also grainy on a dedicated Sony Blu-Ray player.  I even tried several expensive HDMI cables, without luck.  Then I purchased the Discovery HD Blu-Ray version (with Sigourney Weaver) for almost twice the price and it also has a much sharper picture than the BBC Blu-Ray version.

While not as in-depth as the first two series, ""Planet Earth"" more than makes up for this in terms of sheer imagery. The visions of natural beauty and wonder this series offers is literally a breath of fresh air from most current fare laced with the artificiality of CGI.

Aside from the hefty use of time-lapsed video and super slow motion, none of the shots taken in these series were altered in any way. This is our planet caught in her most rawest and grandest, defying anyone not to be awed by her majesty and power.

While no one single program could ever document everything that our planet has to offer, ""Planet Earth"" is an incredible achievement in nature filmatography. And unless you have the deep pockets of a business tycoon or the unlimited funding of a first world country, you will never, EVER get to personally experience all the sights caught here in your lifetime.

For anyone interested in nature or nature photography, this is the DVD you must own.  There has never been anything like it it in the past, and there likely won't be anything like it in the future.  Some of the scenes are breathtaking, and others are even better.  The disclaimer on the HD-DVD points out that a few scenes aren't in HD, and they are clearly visible, but they don't greatly distract from this HD-DVD.

As for negatives, I know of two.  First, this version is narrated by the British David Attenborough instead of Sigourney Weaver.  Neither, in my opinion is great, but of the two, I prefer Sigourney, but this is a personal choice.  (I concede that Sigourney can put me to sleep.)

The second negative was that NOTHING was included with the HD-DVD, not even a two page booklet with an index, nothing.  At the price of this HD-DVD set, I think getting some booklet with a paragraph description of each episode.  And this HD-DVD set includes ONLY the episodes shown on TV, not one extra feature or a minute of extra footage.  Again, they could have done a bit more in this respect.

I've seen most discovery channel documentaries about Africa but this still added more information.  It was also amazing that the crew was able to capture lions hunting a full grown elephant.  It took the large pride's 30 or so members to bring it down.  I thought that prides will usually break up once their numbers be come large, but this one is the largest I've heard of.

If you are interested in nature, beauty, evolution or the earth, then the decision is clear: buy this series. I've watched every episode multiple times.

A more specific note to those already in the know or who have only seen a few episodes: Caves is by far the coolest episode because it shows you things that are very strange and sometimes only exist in 1 or two places in the entire world.

The only odd thing about it is if you watch several of them in a row - every episode there are one or two things that are spoken of as the Biggest, the Largest, the Farthest, the Longest, the Deepest, etc.  I don't doubt that each of these are true, but when you start hearing that five times in two hours you start thinking, ""Wait a minute.

If you're a human and living on this planet earth, you will greatly enjoy this series.  Period.

The Blu-Ray outputed at 1080p is super!  Extremely clear and beautiful.  There are only 4 DVD's in this series.  As other people complaining about this for lacking of the fifth DVD (summary of the making).  My take is that if you enjoy the top-notch video image quality on 1080p, buy this series with 4 DVD.  You won't lose much for not having the fifth one.

2746103,3,B000MR9D5E,"You may be wondering why I didn't give this beautiful work 5 stars. This is because I'm objectively reviewing its educational value. As a life-long avid fan of the BBC nature documentaries and all things Sir David Attenborough, I will be reviewing Planet Earth in a more historical context, comparing it to previous releases:

Overview: Planet Earth attempts to cover the rich natural variety of the planet by focusing on one type of habitat/region per episode and displaying both the landscape and wildlife that occupy it. The venerable David Attenborough narrates (but is only partially involved in the writing this time) with his incomparable and dependable blend of warmth and objectivity. The BBC crew, as always, take their technical know-how to new heights, filming in high definition with all the advancing technology at their disposal to create another beautiful series.

This conceptual approach is not new for the BBC and has been covered already by The Living Planet (TLP) and will therefore be compared to it. Also, the heavy emphasis on spectacular hunts has been covered in Predators, as have the specific topics of penguins (Life in the Freezer), oceans (Blue Planet), birds (The Life of Birds) etc. and in much more depth.

Scope: The habitats covered overlap the ones in TLP but also cover new 'exciting' areas such as caves and mountains, skipping some of the more mundane but basic territories of grass-lands and coast-lines covered in TLP. Therefore this release is somewhat complementary to TLP in this regard.

Focus: Planet Earth is somewhat weak here, seemingly unable to drop beautiful images and stop exploring specific animals that it finds, all to the detriment of the theme of the episode. TLP managed to show only what is necessary for the topic, quickly skimming over many examples and varieties, and yet also provided more depth and information.

Structure: Very weak, even pathetic. TLP progressed logically from small to big, from simple to complex, and followed the timeline and progression of the features/animals it  explored comprehensively. Planet Earth, however, feels almost random, in love with its beautiful images, slow-motions, and whimsically exploring very specific animals for many minutes at a time.

Educational value: Due to all of the above and its lack of depth, Planet Earth obviously suffers in comparison when it comes to making you feel educated. It focuses more on exotics, sensationalism, exciting hunts and kills, rare animals, wonders of the world, grand vistas, big dangers and huge numbers rather than bombarding us with information on the relevant facts and necessary details as in TLP.

Presentation: Obviously, Planet Earth is miles above TLP in terms of image quality, the rarity of things they managed to capture on film, and its style. But is that all we need?

David Attenborough: I miss the more intimate era of TLP where he used the planet as his classroom.

Summary: This is a sensationalist companion piece to The Living Planet. It gives a good feel of the riches of the planet, both overlaps and complements TLP in its scope, but is much less educational and well-structured. If you want screen-saver images, amazing footage and beauty, grab it. If you emphasize educational value, I suggest starting elsewhere first.

Side-Note: This release makes me think...what's next? I mean, Blue Planet and Life in the Undergrowth covered the last two obvious gaps in the BBC nature documentary repertoire. Planet Earth is their first 'remake'. Are we to expect more of the same? Will they start scraping the bottom of the barrel from now on? Will there be only more beautiful but mindless repetition? Or perhaps they will just keep seaching for new exotic things we haven't seen yet? Obviously there is always more to learn and see with nature but it feels like they covered everything systematically and the era of the fascinating introductory overview series is over. Perhaps more in-depth documentaries is the way to go but given the trends and where the money is, i doubt they'll do that. I'm apprehensive - is this the beginning of the end?",1185235200,111,4112,5.077037037037037
2746104,5,B000MR9D5E,"My wife and I just finished putting in a new home theater and were looking for movies/videos that would maximize its' capabilities.  We found it in this magnificent BBC Series.

We had some friends over to watch portions of it, and there was a lot ( I mean, a LOT) of oohing and aahing over the sheer beauty of the world and the spectacular way that it is presented.  We also have a teenager who was unimpressed with the idea of watching a nature video instead of something like, ""Batman Begins HD-DVD"".  After watching some of Planet Earth for 15 minutes or so, he suggested that we schedule family nights where we can watch the entire series together.

Believe me, as virtually everyone else here (who owns the necessary HD-DVD player and not a regular DVD player) has noted, this is an absolutely, positively, wonderful video to see and own.",1185235200,,844,4.6

2746106,5,B000MR9D5E,"I have always been very interested in Nature and wildlife, so naturally I was interested when I kept seeing previews for Planet Earth by the BBC in movie theaters. I watched the Discovery Channel as a kid every night for years, and even now at 21 I watch nature shows on PBS whenever I can, but Planet Earth trumps every nature show I have ever watched. To me, Planet Earth is the culmination of everything that I have ever thought or felt about Nature.

Planet Earth is just so great that I don't know where to begin describing it. Perhaps its most fulfilling quality is that some of the animal behavior that was filmed on Planet Earth had not ever been filmed before, and probably will never be filmed again, due to the nearly unbearable weather and demography of the locations involved. From the extremely rare snow leopard chasing a goat down the side of the Himalayas to a pride of lions bringing down and eating a huge elephant, Planet Earth truly does live up to its claim of showing ""planet Earth as you've never seen it before. Several new species were filmed for the first time in the wild as well, like New Guniea's amazing birds of paradise.

As if all of the adventurous and breathtaking filming wasn't enough by itself, the whole series is filmed in HDTV, and is the first wildlife documentary to do so. Many of the views are so clear and fresh that at times you feel as if you are actually there. Also, the Planet Earth film crew used some pioneering filming methods, like filming the majority of the series in a helicopter instead of on the ground, flying in a hot air balloon over forests in Madagascar, and using satellite imaging to show certain areas and demographic features not visible or not nearly as detailed when seen with the naked eye. The film crew of Planet Earth really put their lives on hold to make this documentary the best wildlife documentary ever, and it shows. Another feature of this series that I love is that there is a 10 minute video at the end of each episode which gives you an inside look at the daunting, dangerous, and nearly insurmountable tasks the production and film crews had to face in each unique environment.

The scale of Planet Earth could also be said to be its defining quality, as it is the largest wildlife documentary in several ways. BBC literally spanned the globe in the filming of Planet Earth, visiting 62 different countries and 204 different locations. It took over five years for the series to be completed, and the BBCs production budget of $25 million U.S. dollars was the biggest ever for any wildlife documentary.

In the end, you should buy Planet Earth for the same reason  that the series was created - to become aware of the inherent beauty and value of Nature, and to see firsthand humanity's mostly negative impact on our Planet's wildlife. Planet Earth's main premise is that the more we see and learn about our amazing planet and its wildlife, the more we will want to protect and conserve it from global warming and other man-made problems that threaten or destroy wildlife and its habitats. Planet Earth shows us a planet that is fragile yet strong, beautiful yet harsh, explored yet unknown. Above all, Planet Earth shows us a planet worth cherishing and conserving.",1185148800,3,3253,4.640625

I would first like to apologize for this not having anything to do with the actual content of the DVD, but for anyone with any amount of sense, this will help you make an informed decision on your purchase. ANYWAY...

Other people have complained that this isn't the ""American version"" and is narrated by some British guy. First of all, the American version was made ""American"" simply by putting an American's voice over top of a British video. Wow, big change; that hardly constitutes as a different version.

Secondly, the item page contains phrases such as ""Actors: David Attenborough,"" and ""narrated by Sir David Attenborough,"" and ""Note: this edition features the original narration by David Attenborough."" Such phrases typically would clue a person in as to the fact that it is narrated by David Attenborough. Similarly, I would have a hard time forcing myself to believe that Sigourney Weaver narrated this version after reading those statements. Maybe these people thought it was odd that Sigourney was spelled D-a-v-i-d on the page, or maybe they just didn't take the extra 2 seconds to make sure what they were buying was Americanized to their liking.

Finally, if you knew anything about Sir Attenborough, you would know that he has spent his entire life traveling the world learning about, and teaching us about the world of plants and animals. It almost makes sense for someone with immense knowledge about the subject of a film to narrate it; maybe I'm wrong.

I would just like to say to anybody considering purchasing this item who is not sure that they want the original version: you will not be disappointed. If you are interested in seeing wonderful footage and learning something, the narrator shouldn't matter to you anyway. BUT, at least you will be listening to somebody who is passionate about the content of which he speaks instead of somebody reading a piece of paper.",1184976000,13,2018,4.840579710144928

I'm very excited about holding onto this series for my children; I know they'll love it.

For those in the U.S., many reviewers have pointed out that the narration is different than that which was broadcasted on TV.  I can't really attest to which is better because I first watched this series on DVD.  However, I feel that Attenborough does a great job of conveying his high level of interest in his subjects and really makes you wonder at what you're seeing.

I'd also like to comment on the environmentalism of the series.  Environmentalism is a hot issue these days, and while I'm not a big environmentalist in the way that most people use that term, I am concerned about the environment generally.  I think this series strikes a good balance by bringing to mind the relevant issues without driving the point home to an offensive extent.

We can watch a 15-minute segment while waiting for dinner or as a ""treat"" before going to bed.  We never tire of watching it over and over.  The penguins, of course, are very cute, but the deep ocean scenes are unbelievable.

2746152,5,B000MR9D5E,"This mini-series is, to put it simply, the most amazing visual experience.  I recorded every show in HD on my DVR, and have watched every episode repeatedly.  I was thrilled to discover that the Planet Earth series was available on DVD, and promptly purchased the set.

I was disappointed to find that the DVD video quality is less than impressive when viewed on an HD monitor.  This is understandable, given that a standard resolution DVD (480 lines) has considerably fewer lines of resolution than your typical HD television (1080 lines).  But what bothered me was the number of scenes that contain digital artifacts - an indication that the video was over-compressed.  Artifacts (where video looks ""blocky"" or prismatic) were especially noticeable during scenes containing lots of trees, or flocks of birds, running water, or aerial shots of roaming herds.  The video quality could have been better, even for a standard definition DVD.

My 5 star rating is for the content of the Planet Earth series. (If I could rate separately the quality of the video on the DVD, I would only give it 3 stars.) If you have a standard definition TV, the video quality of the DVD will probably be acceptable.  Videophiles should opt for either the HD-DVD or Blu-Ray version of this show, as I plan to do very soon.",1184803200,,1301,4.824324324324325

The transformation from winter to summer is outstanding. For the sacrifice that all the crew did I am very grateful.

If you've seen this in High Definition, which I had, and get this set thinking it will be as vivid as HD, it won't be.  It is still worth the investment to have until HD DVD becomes more prevalent.  But the sad thing about this series for me is that it shows us how truly violent the planet upon which we roam is.  If you can ignore the intermittent episodes of preditor kills, you will be overcome by the vastly breath-taking beauty of this planet we call Earth.",1184544000,,543,4.294117647058823

If you missed it on television -- or even if you didn't -- this set will expand your knowledge about those beings with whom we share this planet.  The series is divided by habitat, and while there are some discussions of weather and flora, it really concentrates on things that have eyes (well, except for the episode entitled ""Caves"", where some of the creatures that live in total darkness are eyeless).  The photography is breathtaking, and the 10-minute piece at the end of each episode that tells about how it was photographed makes it even more impressive.  This series is an astounding achievement.",1184544000,,653,4.8558558558558556

I am deeply grateful to the BBC for funding this - finally there's tax payers' money put to a good use! - and hope that many, many people will change their attitude towards nature conservancy after seeing this series. We only have this one planet, and Planet Earth shows it in its most stunning beauty, grandeur - and fragility. To my mind the best DVD of this set is the last, which contains three features on suggestions by various scientists and organizations like WWF about how to save this fragile beauty. There are still several ways to do it, and although the disagreement among the experts interviewed on this disc shows how complex a challenge this is, it also offers hope. Just listen to Nobel Peace Prize winner Wangari Maathai, founder of the Green Belt Movement, talk about the value of clean air and water versus ""things"" that we in the West treasure as luxury items, and then consider what each and every one of us can do to help. It's not that difficult.

I especially enjoy the ""Planet Earth diaries"" at the end of each video.  The diaries help the viewer understand the logistics and painstaking effort involved in filming these scenes.  Each disk is made up of 4-5 videos, each about 1 hour long, so you can choose to watch one topic or more as your time permits.  The topics are broken down into areas such as:  caves, mountians, deep seas, shallow seas, ice world, jungles, etc.",1184457600,,598,4.861386138613861

I plan to get personal copies for each of our four adult children, and their children.

I thank the David Attenborough and the BBC, and every person involved in the project for this amazing work.  I believe what they have accomplished is a necessary ingredient that all people on this earth can use to promote love,respect,sharing and care for our beautiful home.  Thank you, thank you.

I think this is important for our children to view.  I was on a plane that showed the ""Pole to Pole"" segment.  There was a young man seated in front of me.

Honestly you don't know how beautiful this planet is until you watch this documentary

Just the slow motion shot of the shark jumping out of the water to attack is worth $10.

Also this is the best blu-ray disc to showcase the power of your PS3 or justify the price of your bluray player. Its best when you have the broadcast version of one episode recorded on your DVR so you can demonstrate the difference to family members, friends, neighbors, or any skeptical person on the street by playing a clip simultaneously.

I guarantee they will be blown away. My uncle after just watching for 30 minutes went straight to Target and bought a PS3.",1184112000,,1138,4.541463414634146

This was a gift but as soon as the other is out, I will get it!!!",1183852800,2,259,4.16
2746239,5,B000MR9D5E,"I've only seen the standard-definition BBC version of this, so I can't compare it with Sigourney Weaver's narration, but I'll say this much: The money and time they spent on this documentary is right there on the screen.  It's simply the most captivating nature series I've seen.  I particularly liked the introductory episode, ""From Pole to Pole,"" as well as ""Mountains,"" ""Shallow Seas,"" and ""Ice Worlds."" The episode ""Great Plains"" was also very educational about the importance of grass in our world.  I plan on seeing this series in high definition, for sure.  David Attenborough's commentary is very good, although the repeated use of superlatives to announce a particular sequence gets a bit tiresome periodically. (How many ""greatest spectacles"" can one planet have?)  They're even occasionally contradictory: Both freshwater rivers and glaciers are touted as the ""most erosive force on the planet.""  This isn't really a gripe, however, just an observation.  I spent many happy hours in rapt attention watching this series and expect I will rewatch it many times.  I particularly liked the understated subtlety about the importance of conservation and respect for wilderness.  Only two or three times in the course of nearly 10 hours of programming was a comment fairly blunt about global warming or destruction of habitat.  Sometimes you really don't need a sledgehammer to make a point, and ""Planet Earth"" achieves this brilliantly.

As I've only seen the standard DVD release, I'm shocked that the high-definition version doesn't include the ""Planet Earth: Diaries"" segments included at the end of each episode of the standard version.  The behind-the-scenes looks at the filming challenges, detailing what these filmmakers had to endure (solitude, endless boredom waiting for an animal, travels to incredibly remote places, polar bear attacks, grappling with emotion at seeing the wrath of nature firsthand, etc.) were so enjoyable... I was very much surprised to learn they weren't part of the HD version.  The ""Planet Earth: The Future"" disc five in the standard release is something I could take or leave.  It was a nice addition, but not integral to the series.  In my opinion, the ""diaries"" were, and it's a shame they were omitted.

Some day in the future, there will doubtlessly be an even more encompassing nature documentary series.  Technology will continue to evolve and the HD of today will look like a stepping stone.  Until then, though, this is the standard.  Whatever comes along to eclipse this series will have to be stunning in the extreme.  ""Planet Earth"" has set the bar very high indeed.

Add my voice to those who are annoyed that people order the wrong version of this series, then give the program itself a poor rating because THEY made a mistake.  I can honestly understand some people being confused at DVD vs. HD-DVD (many people are just not technically minded, and I've talked with people who incorrectly think that DVD is a high-definition format by its very nature), but in my mind, the rating system is for the content itself, not for exacting revenge due to one's technical ineptitude or a poor experience ordering from Amazon.",1183852800,7,3172,5.094777562862669

2746248,5,B000MR9D5E,"I saw both the HD-Discovery's Planet Earth and just purchased Planet Earth on Blu-Ray from Amazon (Attenborough's narration).  AWESOME, truly awesome. I am glad I cannot wear them out playing them over and over again for myself and family.
Sigourney Weaver does a good job as narrator of the U.S. version played on HD-Discovery and this version can be purchased from discovery.com. She has become an activist and honorary chair of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International and fights for animal rights. She has earned the right but;
David Attenborough's voice is so fitting to this type of documentary. (Even if he is so old that some of his pronunciations sounds like it is from an old Bob Dylan song, mumble mumble), the eye candy is mesmerizing and his voice projects the scene where Sigourney just does a good job at narration (sometimes I waited for the ding for her to turn the page)
I agree with some of the ""setup"" they had to compromise in filming this documentary. The Great White shark scenes grabbing the seals looked familiar, from an older PBS special. I thought the seals looked familiar flying through the air. Ahhh, the same underfed seals. On Blu-Ray, it is easier to see the 50 lb fishing line that is actually pulling what appears to be a cut up neoprene wetsuit, cut to look like a seal. You can clearly see the fishing line in the lower right corner of the 2 jumping shark scenes, ripping through the water, as they trolled the ""lure"" through the water. Hmmm, gotta love the clarity of the Blu-Ray, huh. Oh well, to get the footage, I guess they could have ""fished"" with a real seal and just waited but I much preferred their approach. Totally mind bending to know that this is the way these sharks really feed, on a real seal. POWERFUL BEASTS!! The whole series is worth purchasing in HD (Blu-Ray or HD, but I read the Blu-Ray was clearest). Eye Candy,Eye Candy,Eye Candy, and more Eye Candy. This is the way I envisioned my HD TV.

the discover channel misses a lot of the behind the scenes which is very impressive. i love to see the how they made it kind of documentation. the imagery is beautiful, the narration is spectacular and th accuracy is amazing. the photo director should win an oscar (or emmy). it is very similar to the ""blue planet"" which was also well worth the money. i can watch it over and over again. i would highly recommend this series for anyone over the age of 10. it odes get quite graphic when it comes to the animals feeding. bravo BBC another great!",1183766400,,821,4.366013071895424

And just as with the scores of other shows that David has done, this one is sure to please. The footage is phenomenal. Not only are the images immaculate in their quality and composition (every single frame in this 5 disc set would make an incredible poster), but you are constantly sitting there asking ""How in the #$*@ did they get THAT shot? The disc contains behind the scenes footage that shows what the camerapeople went through and some of the incredible equipment that they used. They also go into all of the efforts required (some locations took over 3 years for the crew to obtain permission to film) and this set is well worth the time and labor.

The other thing that is amazing is that growing up with PBS and having the Discovery Channel and TLC and all of the other outlets for nature documentaries that you figure that we would have seen it all by now. But Planet Earth proves that there is still a whole lot that we don't know about this spinning orb of ours. You see creatures and environments that you never imagined existed. The BBC managed to find creatures and places on Earth that still had not been photographed and they are amazing.

2746256,5,B000MR9D5E,"This documentary deserves more than 5 stars along with The Living Planet.  The video quality and the cinematography are fascinating. The musical arrangements also deserve a special commendation. However, I experienced that the sound quality of Mr. Attenborough's narration was poor. Quite often it sounded like vibrating or having an echo. This flaw should be improved in future editions. I felt the need to really turn up the volume and modify the equalizer to be able to understand his words. Had it not been for the subtitles, I would have been dissapointed. Otherwise, this is an incredible production!.  Close-ups are incredible and time-lap photography is, for the lack of better words, breathtaking!  A must have for all nature lovers or ""biophiles"".  Disc number 5 explores the dangers many creatures are facing despite corageous and passionate efforts from conservationists in order to save them.  The threat of extinction is overwhelming, it really brings tears to your eyes...... We take everything for granted, and meanwhile entire species are wasting away under our noses. Why can't we appreciate what nature offers without destroying it?  Why do we have to wait until all those wonderful creatures and forests are wiped out of the planet before getting the message? And after most forests are gone, water sources are polluted, the air is toxic and the animals are extinct, what will the future be like for humans.............???

2746264,5,B000MR9D5E,"When I first heard about this documentary, I just heard about some of the more sensational items (lions teaming up to kill an elephant, baboons practing cannibalism against competing tribe), and thought this was one of that new generation of animal ""snuff"" films. However, taken in context of 10.5 hours of the whole series, it doesn't seem out of place or sensationalistic at all.

My parents bought this for me and my family to watch when they came to visit us in Germany, as they know our 2 children (6 and 9), love animals. However, it was great for the whole family. It is a visual treat, and some of the scenes displayed are amazing, both for the impressive cinematography as well as the rareness of the event being captured. My daughters laughed hysterically at the bizarre mating dances of various birds of paradise.

There are 11 different episodes, which cover every aspect of the Earth, from the arctic Poles to the deep ocean. There are of course favorites like the Great Plains and Jungles, but what's amazing is how interesting even segments like the Desert or Caves can be when treated so skillfully. My only minor complaint is that Sigourney Weaver's narration seemed a little flat, and got old to me after a while. This is undoubtedly a subjective thing.

This was probably the most amazing nature documentary I have ever seen, and I came away with much more of an appreciation of the abundant varieties of life we have on this planet. I would think almost everyone would enjoy this.",1183593600,,1500,4.717557251908397

The breadth of the series is the planet. The pace is measured in the torrential downfall of rushing waters or beats of a hummingbird's wings or in the patient stillness of a snow leopard stalking her prey. The depths lie far beneath the surface in hidden crystal caves of Mexico. The heights are from outer space - we see our earth, as well as ourselves, in ways we have never dreamed possible.

Nothing short of fantastic, all of the images are beautifully crafted and set. You can most assuredly tell that many, many years-worth of time were put into the making of this production. Even if you've never seen a documentary before, this set will keep you mesmerized. For those who are more seasoned, this is your paradise. It is nothing short of incredible. While it is obvious that a few shots were not done in 1080p, most of the footage has incredible detail and color. Your search for the most fantastic documentary of recent time is over.",1183507200,3,714,4.674603174603175

2746290,3,B000MR9D5E,"I fell in love with this series when I saw it on Discovery HD this year. It is visually spectacular. I thought Discovery simply re-aired this BBC version, but there are 2 major differences between these versions.

1. The narrator on this blu-ray is David Attenborough, not Sigourney Weaver. I've read many reviews of people preferring Attenborough, but I must say I find Sigourney much easier on the ears, and I found this version disappointing.

2. The video quality on this blu-ray pales in comparison to what Discovery HD aired. Discovery's version is noticeably sharper and pops out of the screen (better color/contrast etc). It's clear that Discovery did a lot of re-mastering before they aired it. While the content is mostly the same, this video does not pack the same ""punch"" that the Discovery HD version did. It's soft and washed out by comparison.

I also noticed some other differences, like different music and some editing changes. These are less important but worth noting.

In summary, if you fell in love with the Discovery HD version, then wait until they release it on blu-ray.",1183507200,2,1096,4.908108108108108

First of all, you will be amazed to know that there is so much of untouched wilderness still out there. But you will also be saddened to know that there is actually nothing that is truly untouched!
The program is divided geographically and shows you some pretty spectacular shots. The aerial shots, in particular, are absolutely amazing. The limit to which the camera men have gone needs to be seen to be believed.
The image of the snow leopard hunting in thick snow is something that makes me feel privileged! And if you thought you have seen all there is to see about lions, wait till you see this one!

That said, most of the footage in this series is simply spectacular.  I give the film 5 stars not only for the HD video content, but for the narration and most importantly, the content of the documentary.  I have never seen such a well filmed and edited piece of work.  You must own this even if you have to buy the SD version, but, since Blu-Ray and HD-DVD players are really coming down in price, and if you have a HD display, you MUST BUY THIS SERIES.

Hot air balloons, cranes, and ladders were employed to bring out perspectives we usually are not accustomed to in nature films.  Series producer Fothergill ""the power of the scenery is one of the things that has driven what we've done"".  And early on in viewing this film you realize that it's mostly about the images.  And it's the imagry which drives the narritive.  True scientific substance is lacking.  The narrator mostly describes what you are seeing.  Sure there are nature trivia facts interspersed within the narration.  But the scientifica is shallow.  Sigourney Weaver narrates the Nature Channel televised edition in the USA.  She brings a sultry professional quality to the project.  But its David Attenborough who brings unabashed passion to the 5 disc DVD set.  For pure beauty sake this is a grand achievement.

That's why we were so glad to find the BBC version which used a narrator with many years experience.  His narration fit seamlessly into the film.  His perfect timing enhanced the action, rather than being a distraction.  It is understandable why the Discovery version chose to use an American voice-over and why they felt were doing the very best thing when they obtained the talent of one of America's finest actresses.  However, narrating documentaries requires different skills than interpreting lines and coordinating them with one's own actions.  Just as in reading for audio books the text needs to flow and sound natural and not sound as if it is being read in increments from a teleprompter.

I was disappointed, however, with the absence of sources and/or commentary from bonafide scientists. Many segments also left me remarkably concerned that intrusive photographic techniques had actually caused the death of some of the animals being observed -- particularly a polar bear and a baby elephant. The entire series left me wondering about how invasive photographers were willing to become in order to get the ""perfect"" shot then not ""clean up after themselves"" by feeding an animal, turning it around, or repairing any damage that may have been done to the ecosystem involved in the process.

Thanks to PE, I respect nature even more and on a side note - plan to renew my subscription to Natural Geographic. The DVD itself is well produced and some of the shots from the sky looking down on a herd is simply breathtaking. All I can say is wow. If you plan to upgrade to HD DVD, PE is a great 1st addition.

When you see a program series of this quality you wonder why television cannot do it ""right"" more often. This is spectacular stuff and we will watch it off and on for years to come.

The animal chase scenes are well liked in particular and the time-sped footage of foliage, trees and even fungus makes the saying ""like watching grass grow"" be an interesting and awe-inspiring experience, especially now that it's in high definition.  The narration is good, I found myself watching the first time without subtitles to take in all the visuals and audio, and will be watching it again with subtitles on to gain added insight into what exactly I am watching.

There is footage in this series which has never been shot before, but is able to be shot due to special technology used by BBC. This technology allowed the camera crew to film wildlife up to a mile away from a helocopter, while being zoomed in feet from the animal, and still retaining high definition filming. This provides a revolutionary look at animals in their natural, undisturbed habitats. It's as if you were right along side the animals.

The main aspect of this series is its remarkable camera access and stunning cinematography. The viewer is immersed in worlds that have rarely been seen by human eyes (and not in a cliche kind of way). Planet Earth also delivers a deeply emotional component that allows viewers to connect with the animals and their circumstances in a fashion similar to human dramas. It also shows the preciousness of our environment and how our actions affect beings we rarely see or even know exist. Is it much better seeing Planet Earth in high definition?

But, there are differences. The BBC series presents the series as a nice show to watch, nice music, nice narrator with a nice British accent. It's nice. The Discovery series presents it with drama... dramatic opening sequence, serious music, tough ""Aliens"" lady narrator. It's dramatic, it's no-nonsense. Watch this or die.

I have both sets. I bought the Discovery series at a local Discovery Store.

I do like the ""Diary"" featurette at the end of each show for the BBC series. Gets into the nitty-gritty of how the scenes were filmed. The Discovery series breaks it apart in a separate disc menu selection. The BBC series' menu is odd in that to start a show, you select the first chapter.

If you want to see what your HD-TV can do, this DVD is a great way to demonstrate its abilities.

I don't know why there was a different narrator on the Discovery Channel presentation of the series (Sigourney Weaver?), but I prefer David Attenborough's narration on this HD-DVD.  It occasionally gets cute and preachy, but overall it is a truly enjoyable listening and viewing experience.  I think it should be required viewing in school for several reasons:  its high production values offer a good academic benchmark for budding documentarists and cinematographers; it provides exposure to parts of our Earth most of us have never seen (and probably never will); and the simple education and lessons about ourselves and our orb are hard to beat.

A: So good that I paid $60 to own it now, and will gladly pay another $60 for the HD DVD version the very instant I can afford an HDTV and an HD DVD Player.  And then, when super space-aged 3D HD DVD comes out, I'll pay another $60 for that version!  And so on, ad infinitum.

Q: Can you compare David Attenborough's narration to the narration provided by Sigourney Weaver for the American Discovery Channel production?

A: Can you compare filet mignon with a big steamy plate of turd stroganoff?  Ms. Weaver is an excellent actor and, by all accounts, a fine woman. However, when it comes to narration of wildlife documentaries, there is only one David Attenborough.  Documenting nature is his life's work and I strongly suggest making an effort to appreciate his efforts while you can. Don't you wish that you had shown your gratitude to Orville Redenbacher while you had the chance?

Q: Have you seen the HD version?

A: I have seen bits and pieces, and I would describe its cinematic spectacle as borderline erotic. Not the animals, mind you. We're talking straight production value here.

Q: Would you recommend this program for children?

A: I would unequivocally recommend this program for persons of all ages.  Young children will be mesmerized by the awe-inspiring views of our planet and some of its more curious inhabitants.  With respect to ""predator v. prey"" scenes, there are several points worth noting. First, Planet Earth does a very nice job of minimizing carnage.  Children may not even recognize the brutal implications of many such scenes.  Second, Planet Earth can be used by parents as a tool to help breach important life lessons, such as the inescapable nature of death. Better they should learn it here than from the next instantiation of Grand Theft Auto.  Lastly, as the children age and experiment with recreational drugs, they will find that Planet Earth is a far better A/V supplement than The Wizard of Oz played in sync with ""Dark Side of the Moon.""",1181692800,13,2018,4.755747126436781

This release changed my mind. I decided to enter into the fray but on the HD dvd side as HD dvd has more functions and features available than Blu-ray. This is not evident in this release but for other HD dvd releases.

The vistas in this documentary are simply amazing. This is now my default demo disc for hd dvd (for picture and sound quality) and I have managed to persuade others to go the hd dvd route with this release. Documentaries like these are made to be seen in high definition. Standard Definition Dvds just don't do justice to the majestic and awe-inspiring vistas. No, not even upscaled Standard Definition Dvds.

2746454,5,B000MR9D5E,"Planet Earth is simply stunning.  If you enjoy nature documentaries this is a must see.  What makes the cinematography so unique is that they used big budget Hollywood film/camera techniques that haven't yet been applied to documentary film making (explained in the ""making of"" segments that follow each film).  Planet Earth includes innovative and beautiful footage such as a great white shark, in super slow motion, breached entirely out of the water to catch a sea lion in its mouth.  To capture the breaching shark they used the extreme slow motion photography used to film crash test dummies.  The use of satellite images is integral to creating a global perspective that runs through the series.  Seeing swashes of the planet turn green or the ridge line of the Himalayas from space hammers home the message about how unique, and diverse, life on this planet really is.  Attenborough is, as always, the best documentary narrator ever, and I can't even fathom why the U.S. broadcast of the series replaced his narration.  It is worth buying the DVD to be able to watch the series with the original narration.  Some other highlights include the aerial view of a painted dog hunt, a snow leopard hunt, a mother amur leopard with her cub, and a pride of lions taking down and feasting on a young elephant.  Some segments are more interesting than others (caves was disappointing), but I'm partial to animals over scenery.  The scenery however, especially of various mountain ranges, is breathtaking.  Several segments use time lapse videography in creative ways.  For example, slowing time to show an underwater starfish fight.  In line with other BBC productions the narration is thought provoking and intelligent.  Do not miss Planet Earth, which features some of the best nature documentary filmmaking ever produced.",1181606400,4,1821,5.063758389261745

I had heard much about this before I purchased it (actually I purchased two - one for my parents and one for my husband) and everyone said that the series was excellent.  Watching these DVDs is like traveling to the far reaches of the earth with the most wonderful tour guides on earth.  The colors are so vibrant, the scenery amazing; the whole thing is breathtaking.

2746458,4,B000MR9D5E,"Ok... So far I've only watched the first 4 chapters, so let me comment about them:

Chapter 1 was kinda boring. Let's face it, we've all seen so many extraordinary movies lately that it's difficult to impress us. It's more like a general introduction of what you're gong to see in the whole series, so this lack of coherency made me... go asleep a couple of times.

From chapters 2-4 seem the series seems to get better and better with each coming chapter. At first, you might think: ""I see nothing extraordinary in these shots... They have shots like these all the time in everyday cable TV""... But when you watch the mini ""making of"" at the end of each chapter, you come to really appreciate the effort put to make even a shot a few seconds long. And when you turn on your cable box again you realize that the shots in everyday cable aren't really that great. Ad you come to realize that this series has some places and animals you hadn't even heard about.

Now, if I think the series is so good (after a Zzzzzz first chapter) Why did I gave it just 4 stars? Because of the way the DVDs were made.

My first gripe: The BBC makes you sit and watch through tons of ads of their other programs, and there are a few logos, too. In total, you have to skip to ""next"" 5 TIMES to finally get to the menu every single time you put the DVD in your player.

2nd gripe: The boxing (at least the regular DVD edition one) is made of cardboard, and quite flimsy. Yes, it might look cool with the transparent plastic holding each DVD and everything, but I really feel that I must get these five discs out of this box NOW if this box is to survive another month. I hope they make an edition with regular DVD boxes in the future. I'll post a pic of the box soon...

3rd gripe: There's this company called ""2 entertain""... well, thanks to these guys every single disc in the collection has a giant 2 on it, which is quite confusing. The real disc number is harder to find in the darkness of a home theater...

Now, I expect to be attacked by an angry mob. Leave your comments!",1181520000,11,2059,4.237244897959184

BUT, my one gripe with the HD versions is that I was quite disappointed in the quality on my tv. I was hoping for better than the broadcast quality from my Comcast connection but it was actually worse! Quite grainy in some scenes where there was no graininess  in the broadcast. I know because I recorded the broadcast on my HD DVR and compared the 2.

They average about 6 wow's an episode.  Some have more, some less, but that's what it works out too, and even after watching a couple several times over I still sit wide-eyed as it is some of the most amazing footage ever shot.

We purchased the discs, sight unseen, and find them to be quite remarkable with regards to the scope and content, as everyone has already pointed out before. There is some repetitive footage spanning the 5 discs, but it's not too annoying.

The reason I am giving this disc 4 stars instead of 5 is primarily due to the audio. The narration, by Ben Kingsley, is so low in the mix that it is nearly impossible to hear what he is saying when accompanied by the orchestral soundtrack. My wife and I have to watch this with subtitles on. Only after major adjustments on my surround sound set-up, I was able to bring in the vocals to normal levels.

Citizens who volunteer to check out are given something akin to Jonestown Kool-Aid for a night cap and then while they slip gently into the Big Sleep, they are treated to a montage of achingly beautiful scenes of nature and wildlife, reminiscent of Earth as it was before it succumbed to the ravages of pollution and overpopulation.  These sweeping panoramas play out on a floor-to-ceiling wraparound screen in the sayonara suite accompanied by the symphonic strains of Beethoven; the Pastoral, I believe.  Anyway, the the whole experience is so rapturous to behold for these departing souls -- especially compared to the wretched reality of the world they are exiting -- that it's easy to believe that, for them, it is an experience worth dying for.

Well, the hours upon hours of ravishing footage in Planet Earth is even better than what was featured in Soylent Green's death theater.  And best of all, you won't have to die to see it.

Only niggles are that some rare parts of video are not HD, that they could have fitted the whole series on 2 Double Layer BluRay discs instead of 4 Single Layer discs (I guess we owe this partly to HD DVD's lesser capacity, on which this was released slightly earlier).

Planet Earth image focus is clearly fuzzy at 1080I; not what I expected from a HD-quality film. I don't expect true HD-quality, but a higher sharpness than regular DVD, at the least.

2746546,5,B000MR9D5E,"This was already a fantastic series but I had only seen it in standard deinition.  The change to HD is incredible. This won't be the first review where you see this so I don't think I need to hype this any further. One thing I've seen in some review are complaints about the video quality in some scenes. I agree with this with the box does state ""Due to the difficulty in filming in some habitats, a small percentage of the footage has not been shot in full HD."" This doesn't detract and is only slightly noticeable.  My TV is 32"" at 720p so those with larger sets running at 1080p will probably notice this more than I did.  Then again, running on a much larger screen at 1080p you will really be in for an experiance for most of the time.

That being said, the documentary is excellent and the high quality of picture makes the things described much clearer.  But it is the documentary that is the stand-out aspect. On the four discs you will see some incredible sights : sandstorms rolling across the desert, great white sharks leaping out of the water to catch seals, Death Valley in bloom, time lapse through a day at a pole where the sun doesn't set, the lechuguilla cave, Venezuela's Tepui. The vast majority you will never see in person so getting this in HD you are seeing it in the closest picture quality we have right now. If you're a sensitive soul some things may upset you but this is what appens in the wild, and it doesn't dwell on it, it simply shows you what happens.

I would have liked to have the option of Sigourney Weaver's commentary.  No special reason, just curious to hear it having only seen this in the UK. No idea if it is scripted differently so I am curious on this.

The extra ""Planet Earth Diaries"" from the standard definition DVD are not included which is borderline criminal.  When you watch this series you will wonder ""How did they do that?"", without this you will have to buy the standard definition DVD, buy the book or search the web for answers.  We also miss out on Planet Earth:The Future which is on the standard definition release.

A full 5.1 sound release and maybe an option to watch with just the musical score.

Amazon have a warning that this will not work on normal DVD players so if people can just exercise a little more care when buying they will see this and stop posting bad reviews of an excellent product.

2746550,3,B000MR9D5E,"I know that I will be in the extreme minority here based on what I'm about to say but here it goes.

I watched this series on Discovery HD and purchased the HD-DVD set shortly after it was released.  I read many reviews and forum posts about this set especially on Sigorny Weaver's narration.  (Most couldn't stand her narration and were applauding the Attenborough narration on the new sets).

While I don't dislike David Attenborough's narration, I really prefer Weaver's.  (I can't believe I said that!)  Attenborough does sound older, (naturally) and I have to turn the volume up to hear him as well, I just feel Weaver's narration is more ""effortless"" to listen to and understand.  This is not because of Attenborough's accent.

My remaining gripes about this set are in the Audio/Video quality, lack of features and the addition of the Weaver narration track if possible.  Although someone in the forum did give good reasons as to why that probably did not happen due to the editing for American TV.

I know everyone loves the quality of the picture on this set and it is HD, but I have had HD for a few years, and am used to looking at it.  I am very critical of picture quality and am disappointed...  There is a lot of noise in many of the scenes for HD quality.  I have 2 HD Televisions and basically the top of the line 1080p HD player as of this writing. (Toshiba XA-2)

I have hooked it up on HDMI and component, 1080p and 1080i, and the noise is there in many of the scenes.  Some scenes are jaw dropping with almost no noise whatsoever, 3D-ish with incredible ""POP"" and many are just downright disappointing and I'm not only talking about dark scenes which digital cameras will naturally show noise.  I feel that although this set was filmed mostly in HD, I'm sure they could have spent more time in the editing room cleaning up the picture in many scenes.  I am going to say that this version at 1080p didn't really look better than the broadcast in HD.  Although the broadcast is at lower resolution, 720p or 1080i, it did not look as noisy as the HD-DVD set.  This may be because at higher resolution, imperfections are amplified and easier to see.  Sitting 10-15+ feet away, many people will not even notice.

The audio quality of this set is not very good for an HD production.  It could have been much better and would have added even more to the viewing experience of the series.

I know many will disagree with my opinion here, but they could have spent more time and care on this HD set.  Just putting it on Blu-Ray or HD-DVD is not enough.  They spent an ungodly amount making this thing over 5 years, spend and extra 2-3 months cleaning it up and make it look even better before you release it.  I'm sure they were rushing to get this set commercial as soon as the initial airing was completed on Discovery Channel.  It is possible to realease a 1080p disc with poor video quality.  While I won't say the video quality is poor, I was expecting better and more consistant video quality.

I have come across other posts and reviews complaining of noise and grain in the picture.  I am hoping to find someone I know with the Blu-Ray version to see if it's exactly like this one.

I doubt my review will deter anyone from purchasing this set.  (It's not intended too.)  It's more of a heads up and know what to expect.  Don't pay the $99.99 retail like many stores have it for.",1180742400,158,3399,4.455429497568882

But as good as the picture is, it's the quality of the documentary that is the best part of this Box-set. Narration is very interesting and you end up seing the world in a very different way, you will realise that humans are not that smart after all.

As for the compatibility issues that some poeple reffer to, you need to update the firmware of ANY hd-dvd player to see this movie, it use newer encoding, wich is more efficient than the oldest one, and it will become the new standard, so you'll have to do it some day anyway.

2746584,5,B000MR9D5E,"Everyone has raved about the high quality and production values of this set, so I'll try to adhere to more personal elements in my review.

Watching this in high definition recreated the feelings of awe I remembered when I first saw a high-def program in a store display many years ago.  The crisp details and sounds are riveting, and playback was flawless on our Xbox HD-DVD player.  In my opinion this is the best program available to showcase a high-def home theater system, based not just on my own responses but those of our family and friends who don't have HD at home and have watched this with us.

Not only is is a stunning technological achievment, but it is also an achievment in the art of documentary film making.  The cinematography is exquisite, the compositions and editing are breathtaking, and the science is fascinating.  As a fan of nature documentaries, I can't recall any series in the last decade that so frequently left me saying, ""I have never seen anything like that before"" or ""I didn't know an animal like that existed.""  We enjoyed Sigourney Weaver's narration in the version aired in the US, but there is no comparison to Sir Attenborough.

Though this set would be a value even at the retail price, once you factor in Amazon's pricing, it's almost a must-have for HD-DVD owners.  This HD-DVD set is easily our most favorite media purchase of the HD era.",1180483200,3,1384,4.68595041322314

The sound is wonderful. Dolby Digital Surround.

How that works out I don't know, I was under the impression that it would be Dolby 2.0.  But it's not.

I do wonder why the none of the high def editions of Planet Earth got the same special features the regular DVD set got?

2746597,5,B000MR9D5E,"The BBC put a lot of time and money into making this documentary. It was a HUGE gamble, because documentaries, particularly of this nature, rarely sell well. Well, it paid off.

This is the documentary that has set the bar! It is named Planet Earth, no less!

If you have a HDTV set-up, you are really in for a treat with the Blu-Ray Edition Planet Earth. When I want to show off my nice 50"" Plasma TV, I always insert one of these four DVDs! The picture is beautiful and crisp in either 720p or 1080i! (My plasma doesn't do 1080p, unfortunately, but there's not a significant difference.) Every single scene in on each disk could easily be used as a desktop wallpaper image!

There are 11 episodes over the four discs. My biggest complaint is the lack of extra content. Unfortunately, there is no extra content on the BD or HD-DVD editions! There is some really nice content on the regular edition, such as the nearly 3 hour complimentary feature Planet Earth: The Future. It angers me that they did not include this on the HD editions, because there is room...

My other complaint has to do with the narration. Don't get me wrong, David Attenborough does a wonderful job of narrating all 11 episodes. Mr. Attenborough was the narrator on the original release of the BBC Planet Earth. When the Discovery Channel picked the episodes up, they made the decision to re-narrate in an American voice, I assume, choosing Sigourney Weaver. Having watched some of the episodes on the Discovery Channel, I was familiar with the brilliantly smooth narration of Mrs. Weaver. It would have been nice if they had included the extra audio tracks to choose Sigourney, if you so desired.

All in all, this is definitely worth the money. I have even bought two more sets for friends! This documentary is a wild, secretly educational ride - one that will make you more aware and protective of our beautiful planet.

My son (nearly 5) is rather keen on understanding the Earth better and this video has been an unbelievable education - for all of us. I still recall ""Life on Earth"", which Attenborough narrated when I was a child, so it has come full circle.

We're only 2 discs in so far, and it is absolutely amazing. I cannot pick a favourite part, rather there are no bad ones! I cannot even begin to cite what I've learned, nevermind what my son has taken from it, the insight is nearly as rich as the cinematography. I especially like the diary feature, which keeps the main story whole, and also allows for deeper appreciation of what the trackers, film crews et al went through to make this documentary.

If given the choice, go with this version of the set narrated by David Attenborough and not the Sigourney Weaver narration.

I was pleasantly relieved that the visuals were the same.

Mr. Attenborough has a wonderful voice and did a supurb job with the narration.  It will be a treasured part of my DVD library for years to come.

Whether you believe in evolution or ""intelligent"" design, I have come to the conclusion that the earth would be better if man had never evolved.  Think about it, a beautiful place with no air pollution, no war, no politicians.

I truly believe that at some point man will become extinct, due to something developed in a test tube, or more likely an all out nuclear war.

The only gripe I have is the fact that the regular DVD version comes with bonus features and end credit footages. And it wouldn't have mattered if you went for the Blu-Ray version or the HD-DVD version; both are lacking the bonus features that the regular DVD version has. Why BBC felt to remove these highly sought add-ons is a great mystery. Still, repeated viewings just for the sheer landscapes and vistas is worth it. A bit confusing is the 1st episode which acts as a summary for the rest of it, because it culls footage from all the others.

Harsh notes masquerading as ""music"" was dubbed in to hype the film, which often drowned out the commentary.  Ads every few minutes further degraded the show.

Owning a shiny new HD TV (Sony Bravia) and a tenured DVD player I opted to purchase the HD version of the Planet Earth series.  Here is where I made my mistake (and Amazon too!)

I did not understand that only HD DVD players can play a HD DVD.  Your ordinary DVD player simply can't read the new technology on the HD DVD.  Period.

OK, it does say so, in the very fine print on the back of the DVD case.  Why with 10X reading glasses I might have even noticed.  But no where on the ordering process on teh Amazon web site is this requirement brought to my attention.

Sure, snicker, you video-philes who are early adopters and know this implicitly.  But trust me, I have talked to at least a dozen people who like me didn't have a clue.  And not one person I have discussed this with was aware of the DVD shortcoming with HD DVD format.

So, just hop out and buy an HD DVD player you say.  They don't cost that much.  Wrong, the lowest price I found using on-line vednors IE.g., Amazon, Costco) was $430 then jumping to $700 for the second lowest priced option.  Not your ordinary DVD player price is it?

So go slow, if you have the TV but not the player.  My advice: Wait til Christmas, the prices always come down a notch.",1179878400,8,1419,4.188888888888889

Some of the other disks use a lot more general film stock, cropped heavily to show close-ups of animals, but it's still very good.  You can tell when the footage is cropped stuff.  The best footage in it is the stuff shot on HD Video, by far.

The series is stunning with some breathtaking aerial shots and inaccessible places which you will never visit in your life-time. Truly a magnum opus from stables of BBC. I purchased one with the legendary David Attenborough narrated set. Though his way of presentation is good he seems to swallow some of the narrations, perhaps he has become too old. I thought the narrations of Alastair Fothergill was far more clearer based on the trailers that i saw. Nevertheless we are treated to a series, for which a lot of hardwork has gone from the cameramen & the crew who have brought this biggest and the majestic sights of our Mother Earth in supreme clarity.

The effort put forth by the BBC's Planet Earth team of producers, directors, photographers, etc. is remarkable in and of itself.  Their final product is a work of art worth archiving and revisiting from time-to-time.  This documentary has raised the bar for future such projects.

2746730,2,B000MR9D5E,"Yes, there are some very good things about this series. The camera work amazing. Many stunning examples of life on planet Earth were captured...BUT I was largely disappointed by this series because of the many things it left out, and its highly repetitive, cursory treatment of those few topics it did cover.

As a microbiologist I know that there are some fabulous images and videos of microscope life out there for the taking. Most of our planet is unseen by the naked eye. There isn't even an episode devoted to this most important aspect of Earth.

The life forms that are included could have been fitted into two or three episodes. Watching all the episodes you get a sense of deja vu and annoyance as you realize you've already seen these shots of the shark in slow motion five times before with much of the same dialogue. You've already seen the polar regions...why are you back there again! Rather than sticking with one creature's story, the editing skips around within episodes and between them, as if designed for people with attention spans of a two year-old.",1179446400,9,1071,4.752688172043011

Be warned - Disk 5 is mostly a reality check that discusses our impact to the planet and the creatures we share it with.  A bit depressing to see how much we know but don't have the political will to do anything about.  I found it very interesting to hear about the situation from the prospective of the photographers and producers who are out there making a living filming without intruding.  I also found a bit of the absurd -- at least to me -- a zoologist working on Jurassic Planet.  She thinks we should collect DNA from all the species so we can populate a new planet some day.  Sounds great - the whole universe at our disposal.  We can suck the planet dry and go find a new one.  When we trash that one, we can take the DNA out of the freezer and find another planet.

The viewer is shown footage while learning from narration through the legendary David Attenborough (the voice you think of when someone suggests making a wildlife documentary) about life existing in the most remote or harshest environments on earth.  Note a shortened version of this series was shown on the Discovery Channel with actress Sigourney Weaver replacing Attenborough reading the rewritten script (probably to cater to US audiences although if you read the other reviews on this site you'll see most of them prefer Attenborough too) but this DVD package is the original BBC version hour plus long chapters, with lifelong wildlife commentator David Attenborough.

In some cases years of planning were needed to get permission to film in some areas and with the case of some of the footage in the chapter Caves, no more footage will ever be allowed to be filmed due to the fragile nature of the ecosystem within.

As well as the general wildlife and plant information the best parts of the DVDs are the ten minute ""making of"" documentaries at the end of each chapter where you get to see the whole wider picture of the animal in relation to man today other than just the edited part which was in the documentary pretending no cameras were there.

This beautiful survey of the world's ecosystems leaves me with mixed feelings. While I am awed by the tenacity and diversity of the life portrayed, my sense of what we are losing, destroying, for the sake of our lifestyle, blooms and spreads. The narration rarely makes reference to issues of sustainability or the tenuous hold some species and systems have on survival. My title for this review was drawn from the Deep Oceans segment, late in the series. For the most part, the series leaves informed viewers to come to our own sense of what we value, what is at stake, and what we are prepared to do about it all. The series may either damn us, proving that we knew the beauty of what we were destroying, or inspire us to do something about reversing the destruction before our own reputation as a wastrel species is sealed.

David Attenborough and the BBC team use state of the art technology to take us through the various eco systems of our planet - polar ice caps, mountains, plains, rivers, caves and deserts.

You get to see the regions from the space, from the sky, from a tree top, on land and on occasions from down under. Rare events (births, first moments, hunts, survivals) have been captured with great alacrity and patience and presented in one continuous seamless flow.

Ever seen Niagara falls from various observation points? Right atop the horse shoe falls? On a ""maid of the mist"" boat tour taking you as close to the falls as possible? On the ""hurricane thunder"" platform where the secondary spray itself is powerful to knock you off and the huge mass of flowing water above your head ""scares"" you? On a ""journey behind the falls (on the Canadian side)? On a balloon overlooking the falls?

Ever seen the Grand Canyon from Hopi point with the Colorado appearing as a nice serene silver ribbon barely visible in the total landscape? Ever ""trekked"" down Hermit's rest to realize how rugged the terrain is? Ever took a ""white water rapids"" ride to experience the thunderous flow that the silver ribbon has become? Ever took a copter ride over the canyon to see Peak Brahma and Peak Vishnu in their inspiring splendour lording over the canyon?

Ever snorkelled in the Great barrier reefs in Australia? Ever did an underwater glass boat ride over the reefs (and get teased for it because your kids got to do a 50 m scuba dive around the same time)?

Ever spent a day to reach Jungfraujoch (through the Eiger tunnel) to see the picturesque view atop the Sphinx observatory deck? Ever saw the same stuff atop a chartered flight over the Swiss alps?

Ever stood on an Alpine farm land with a parasail (and a tandem pilot) attached to you and run at breakneck speed toward the edge of a cliff? Ever experienced the magic moment when your feet are off the ground and you are flying/floating/sailing/gliding with nothing between your feet and the lake town 2,000 m below? Ever moved from the embarrassing moment when you have self doubts (while your little girls and wife have taken off smoothly) to the moment when you are in air catching a thermal and getting a big uplift?

Every time you have an awesome moment like this in your life your respect for Planet Earth goes up. So does your fun in living with this postal address.

This exceptionally entertaining DVD series brings those magic moments of joy you experienced and those you have not right into your living room.

I was kind of disappointed that it was narrated by Sigourney Weaver rather than Richard Attenborough, but when I got the HD-DVD discs, I was pleased to find that Sir Richard is the narrator. I have nothing against Sigourney's voice and she does a respectable job, but this type of content seems a perfect match for Richard Attenborough's narration. The image is great on my 720p Panasonic front projector displaying on a 96"" diagonal widescreen. I'm using a Toshiba A2 HD-DVD player and as such, do not have the audio capabilities to take advantage of the Dolby Digital Plus output, since my receiver does not have HMDI inputs. I have an older Denon receiver and the audio is downconverted to DTS, but it sounds much better than standard DTS or DD. The sound is much fuller and richer with more dynamic range and visceral impact.

Thus, when the series was released in a Blu_ray edition I ordered it AND a Blu-ray DVD player. I am not disappointed in the least. What an introduction to full digital viewing!

I contacted NetFlix and was told that, if I registered as having Blu-ray, they would automatically ship me Blu-ray disks when they become available.",1178928000,3,436,4.506329113924051
2746774,5,B000MR9D5E,"One of the reasons why I purchased an HDTV so early was because of Discovery HD.  This series years in the making is a must have for any nature/earth enthusiast.  I know the BBC began filming 5 years ago when 1080p wasn't available yet so it was probably filmed in 720p and mastered in 1080p.

Anyway, this series is fantastic and a must have in either HD-DVD or Blu-Ray.  Sir David Attenborough is a seasoned professional, but I kind of missed the comforting sound of Sigourney Weaver.  After watching both, I must say there's a reason why Attenborough has been doing this for decades.  He's fantastic at what he does.

I tried playing the shows simultaneously while the Discovery Channel played.  It's interesting that Discovery edits bits and parts of the episode to make it somewhat shorter.  Have a map and a metric converter ready because the BBC references Europe frequently and obviously the metric system when making a comparison to the Amazon as an example. :)  The dialog is also different.  The BBC (Attenborough) focuses on the raw review of the footage whereas Discovery (Weaver) constantly mentions how this footage was brought to you never before seen with modern technology. It gets a little old, but I appreciated both perspectives.

With that said, here are my list of very minor issues:

- It would be nice to have the option of choosing narrators.

- At the end of each Discover episode, there are behind the scenes commentary.  No such commentary on the HD-DVD series.

I'll just want to quickly mention the technology difference when watching this series on Cable or Satellite as opposed to HD-DVD or Blu-Ray.  You get the most from the latter simply because Cable/Satellite providers have limited amount of bandwidth to show all their channels.  Thus, they must make compromises and compress material before showing it to you.  This means the video quality degrades once viewed.  Of course there is compression with HD-DVD/Blu-Ray, but it's not nearly as much.  Yet another reason why this series is a must have!",1178928000,4,2036,4.877551020408164

Several hundred dollars later, all I can say it, it was worth it!!  The cinematography is absolutely stunning as the magnificent handiwork of our Creator God is displayed over and over again.

It's the most beautiful visuals and amazing stories nature has put on earth for humans to behold. We all need to value it like we value insignificant things like (gold, diamond and yes the almighty dollar). Shame on us....we are so stupid to be so remiss in taking care of the only place in the universe we can truly call home. I hope this incredible documentary is a wake up call for the world. I recommend the BBC David Attenborough version over Sigorney Weaver- his voice suits this film much better.",1178496000,3,677,4.512195121951219
2746793,5,B000MR9D5E,"I came accross Planet Earth a little late, after most of the episodes were broadcast on the Discovery Channel.  I loved the episodes, but was annoyed by the narration.  It wasn't Sigorney Weaver's voice or anything, but I soon grew tired of how many time she said that the footage was the first time this behavior was ever filmed, or the first time ...... It seemed too puffed up.  I didn't want to hear about how awesome they thought they were because of this footage.  But I loved the series overall, so when I saw it at my local Costco (for a similar price as on Amazon), I went for it.  I much prefer David Attenborough's narration.  The show is pretty much apolitical - you're not going to have to listen to a bunch of 'mankind is horrible' talk.  I think this makes it much more effective in getting the point accross to protect the environment as it doesn't offend conservatives like me.

I think my favorite parts are the diaries.  It's amazing what the photographers and everyone else had to deal with to film all these scenes.  The funniest moment of the whole set is the guy who filmed the bird of paradise footage.

Great set that I think everybody should get.",1178496000,3,1172,4.455399061032864
2746794,5,B000MR9D5E,"The filming of this series is simply stunning throughout the entire 11 part series.  It is like no other footage of nature and the planet earth ever captured before and the 5 years it took to film definately paid off.  Each of the 11 parts ends with a 10 minute section on how they filmed parts of the episode and shows some of the extremes the crew went to to capture this one of a kind footage.  Much of the footage has never been captured before and many of the animals never filmed in such a way previously.  This is more than just a another nature program, much more, it is the best insight I have ever seen or probably ever will see compiled into the life on planet Earth.

The series is not intended to boost the level of knowledge of NASA scientists in earth science or nature matters as the naration is not too deep however, for us regular folks this series should be watched for the revolutionary photography and filming alone which speaks volumes for itself without complex narration.

This is a set every house should own and every child (and adult) should see at some point.  It illustrates how amazing nature and the earth still are despite the damage and destruction inflicted by humans.  It gives us a visual reasoning as to why we need to protect what we have left.

The DVD set is narrated by David Attenborough rather than Sigourny Weaver who did the version shown on American TV.  I wanted this set because a series of this calibre without the voice of David Attenborough would be unimaginable.  I also read that they had 'dumbed' down the American version on TV and this set with all of the extras such as 3 additional hours of the future of Planet Earth would ensure I didn't miss anything.",1178496000,3,1712,4.455128205128205

I thought they had the same script, but despite that the quality is excellent, even better than the HD version on Discovery.

The one drawback?  I wish they DID replace David Attenborough's voice with Sigourney Weaver's voice. I heard Sigourney Weaver's version on cable and then heard the Attenborough version and her voice is just so much more pleasant and crisp to hear and understand. I know many people love David's voice...but quite honestly...he really sounds like he is spitting all over the microphone and it's quite distracting to me (if not disgusting) when I hear his gurgling and sputtering.  Sorry...but that ruined it for me.  But anyways...I just ignored it and tried to love the great scenes!,1178409600,3,746,4.928

We bought the DVD set narrated by David Attenborough and were highly disappointed. Mr. Attenborough's voice is not the problem; the problem lies with the balance between the volume of his voice and that of the music. The volume has to be turned up to hear his voice, in which case the music volume becomes intolerable. We found ourselves straining to hear what he was saying and playing it back to listen to what we missed.  It is such beautiful photography, it is a shame that it is so poorly produced.

This is what Blu-ray is all about, if you have a next-gen player, and you are interested in this genre, you should definitely add this title to your library.

As far as the sound goes, if you have a surround sound system, you will feel like you're in the great outdoors with the animals. The sounds are fantastic.

2746801,5,B000MR9D5E,"Planet Earth is quite simply the most jaw dropping natural history series I have ever seen. Now I do not fancy myself a lover of nature documentaries but I have seen one or two in my time and this one takes the cake. This isn't simply educational. It's cinematic. The one thing that seperates this from others is that you become entranced and emotionally involved in the happenings before you.

Shot in High Defination (with the exception of a small percentage of scenes) the image quality is breathtaking. Never before have I seen anything look this good on my TV. I'm using a 30"" High Def with 720p and it still looks crystal clear. I can only imagine what it would look like on a bigger TV in 1080p.

Sound wise it does the job well but it isn't an immersive cinematic experience. But for a program like this you really shouldn't expect that. The narration is up front and the rears are used when needed. One minor quibble is that sometimes the score seems to almost drown out the narration.

no extras on the HD DVD but the image quality makes up for it.

All in all Planet Earth is a must have if you are equipped with HD-DVD. It's subject matter and stunning image will leave you speechless.",1178323200,8,1197,4.427272727272728

People set up cameras in the most remote and unique locations for days if not months on end, waiting to catch a part of nature hardly ever seen.  Then, with a camera designed to slow down what was filmed, we see in amazing speed (or lack thereof), some of the most fascinating footage ever.

I love the beautiful polar bears coming out of hibernation and losing their footing and sliding a little.  They are so cute.

This is the most superb documentary I've seen, and I highly, highly, highly recommend it to EVERYONE.  I think this is something that every human should watch.

- MUST (would pay more money for it!): Add another audiotrack with Sigourney Weaver narration from Planet Earth broadcast on USA Discovery channel. David Attenborough's voice sounds too old for my ears. Some people want David's narration badly, but why not have both if technology allows?

- Use dramatic Discovery's theatrical trailer in the beginning of every disk - not a sunrise from space.

- Add more chapter markers - currently only 5 per episode.

- Increase volume on the center channel - I had to turn on dialog enhancement feature on my player just to hear narrator's voice (or may be this is just my setup, although center channel sound on other HD DVDs plays fine).",1177977600,4,813,4.869565217391305

The team that made this series went to every height necessary to make it, and their efforts paid off in dividends. ""Planet Earth"" is the most beautiful and educational series I've ever seen. It was made with everything from small handheld cammeras to satiliets orbiting the earth and everything inbetween. The series is broken up into many little segments. One segment follows African elephants as they travel across the African desert in search of water. One shows the bizarre mating customs of antarctic penguins,while another shows the stages of a hurricane. Everyone of these segments is filmed in beautiful first hand style. Part documentary, part biology class, part high class movie, ""Planet Earth"" is a film phenomena like nothing I've ever seen. The most enjoyable thing I took form ""Planet Earth"" is that it reminded me that even though I forget, there are still wild and beautiful places in this world and they bigger and more important that my first world problems. In the wake of the ""Global Warming"" scare, ""Planet Earth"" is a firm reminder of what could be lost because of our arrogance. The special features are also a treat.

Planet Earth has taken on the challenge to awaken our senses, treat our eyes and ears and, explode our personal myths of the dominance of ""man"". The production and photography are amongest the best! Stunning, magnificent and breathtaking don't do the film justice. We have been glued to our seats as we've been introduced to animals and plants we've never seen and the familiar are even more amazing thanks to the tireless and often risky business of photography in the wilds. This production will become a classic because every aspect of the film has been carefully thought out - serendipity, not withstanding. You may not need to own this but you must see it.

The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because the producers just had to gratuitously throw in the most over done wildlife episodes seen on almost every wildlife program - the wildebeast crossing with the crocodiles, the wolf hunt, dog hunt, lion hunt, the shark ""attack"", etc., etc.  These could have been left out as everyone with access to a Tv has probably seen these ad nauseum.",1177977600,,1254,4.6441441441441444

It's simply the best way to show off your new HD TV and HD-DVD or Blu-Ray system. The picture is excellent, the sound is great, and the documentary itself will likely go down as the greatest nature documentary of all time.

It should be noted that this set is the BBC version of the series, and is narrated by David Attenborough. In the U.S., where I watched the show on the Discovery channel, it was narrated by Sigourney Weaver. Weaver's narration is certainly adequate, accurate, and perfectly serviceable. She only occasionally mispronounced a few words that most people wouldn't recognize anyway. However, I find that I generally prefer Attenborough's version. It's also worth noting that these boxed versions come with slightly differently edited versions of the shows from their televised versions (i.e., extended, with significantly more material per episode).

From a scientific perspective, for the most part the series sticks to facts rather than making moral judgements or stating personal opinion. Thankfully, the editors and producers usually let nature speak for itself, which is powerful enough on its own.

The series contains a lot of eye candy, but there is a significant proportion of it that contains never-before-seen behavior and it's all captured in high definition.

2746813,5,B000MR9D5E,"I think some of the reviewers are being overly picky about the picture quality of the this series when you consider it was not shot in a studio but rather in some of the most extreme environments on the plant where there were no second chances to shoot a scene.

I would agree there are some grainy scenes and I did notice some banding a couple of times, but for the most part this series is pure eye candy.  There is no excuse for the banding, but I'm not sure how a lot of these darker scenes could have been shot without grain given the necessity of having to use fast film.  It's also worth noting that many of the scenes had to have been shot with extreme telephoto lens which only makes getting perfection more difficult, there are times when you can clearly see the image distort due to fluctuations in air temperatures over the long distances.  There is a small amount of SD content within the series, but the majority is HD and mostly breathtaking.  So while there are a few minutes of less than stellar scenes (picture quality wise), there are hours and hours of pristine video and I commend the guys for their excellent work on capturing this footage under these challenging conditions.

The series itself is amazing.  The narration, photography, and storyline are all top notch.  If this series doesn't make you view the plant in a different way, nothing will.  This is a must own IMO.",1177977600,4,1397,4.511904761904762

I was even amazed wathing the avalance on the mountain episode.  I could see fine details in the rampaging snow.  And when they had it coming down the valley towards and envoping the cammera it was startling at the detail.  One of those moments you stop and say WOW.  As far as captuing animal behavior in their natural surroundings they do an exellent job.  I tried recording some of the episodes I missed on my DVR in standard definition and could not watch them after seeing how good it looked in HD.  It was like watching a color program in B & W.  So I erased them from my DVR and immediately preordered this set.  In my opinion I really like the case.  Relieved not to have a huge box set to have to make room for on my shelf.

Second, it would be nice to have the option of selecting alternate narrations... the Attenborough narration is a little monotone and he sounds out of breath most of the time... apologies to any Attenborough fans.

Missing special features on Blu-Ray compared to DVD... come-on... what kind of half-baked nonsense is this? You're supposed to sell us on the Blu-Ray capabilities not give us LESS (I know we get more pixels... I'm not talking pixels... I'm talking minutes of video content).

I was expecting the quality to be superior to all other BBC documentaries that I own. I was disappointed miserably, to the point that I feel compelled to write my first online review.

Equipment: Sony PS3 feeding a 46 inch Sony Bravia 1080P, through premium HDMI cable.

The good: Colors are stunning, and some shots, specially the ones from space, are absolutely breathtaking.

The bad: Many grainy scenes. Quality varies. Some shots are as good as my DVD edition of Blue Planet. Some are better, and some are worse. A lot worse. In fact, in some scenes grain is so bad that if it were a movie, I would have thought it is done on purpose for the artistic effect. Somehow I had the impression that the master for this series was high def digitial, but it sure seems that quite a bit of it was film.

The terrible: Here is something I had not seen before. Flicker. Huh?? On flyover scenes of waterfalls, screen starts flickering with a rising tempo. As we pass over the falls and look back at the falling water, flicker turns into a 'snow' screen that flashes at about 1 sec intervals. This is so bad that I am hoping I have a faulty component somewhere. :-(

In summary: If you are thinking about buying the blu-ray edition for video quality, it might be better to rent it first to see if you have the issues that I did.

----------------------

Follow up: Based on suggestions of others, I played with connection, TV adjustements, noise reduction setting, and resolution settings. This is definitely a 1080P issue. At 720p, the problem is not present at all. At 1080i, the problem is present but almost unnoticeable. At 1080p problem is very obvious. The most annoying scene is disk 1, episode 3, as we fly over Angel Falls and look back. I can pause the picture and single frame advance to a frame that the 'snow' is very prominent. While picture is paused here, I can change resolutions, and see the noise only in 1080p. Since I do not have another blu-ray player, nor another TV, I cannot conclusively blame the disk.

To date, David has produced more than half a dozen of serialized documentaries on wildlife of the world and all of them are highly educational and bear a powerful  message - Nature Conservation of our land, animals and plant life in all their beauty...before they become extinct.

The current documentary is David's latest on PLANET EARTH which comprises of 5 DVD discs on almost 9 solid hours of viewing and  what has  happened on our Blue Planet.

Ironically and in view of the global warming and the dire warnings, these documentries could perhaps be the last visual recording that  we would see nature before it is gone forever.

At this affordable price, the set of documentaries would be just  a bargain. So go for it while they last.

David's present documentary could  be the last salute to Planet Earth and our next generation and generations  to come might not see and enjoy what we do now, friends.

Please don't let me alarm you, but at the rate our Planet Earth is being abused, I wouldn't be surprised that  it could not  hold out much longer...the point of no return has been reached!!!

2746823,4,B000MR9D5E,"When I think of the nature shows I used to watch there were many short clips of things like a leopard running behind a gazelle. One of the best things about this series is their use of modern helicopter-mounted camera systems allowing them to film very long action sequences the likes of which I haven't seen before. The show's large budget and the filmmaker's patience and determination also allowed them to get some impressive footage from remote places.

David Attenborough's voice is pleasing, but I think the actual content of his narration could have been better. Watch out as some US versions feature Sigourney Weaver as a narrator, which may or may not be your cup of tea.

This series is one of those rare items that I think justifies High Definition, so you might want to wait until the HD DVD vs. Blu-Ray war is settled before buying a HD version.

Lastly, I have to mention I couldn't help feeling a bit sad while watching the series because at the rate our planet is going down the drain many of these natural wonders will be gone soon. The HD version might be something to keep for your grandchildren so you can show them what your generation wiped out for ever. Perhaps some viewers today will feel compelled to become ""greener"" after watching this? I hope so...

P.S.: It's unfortunate that the ""making of"" documentary is missing from the HD versions. You might want to rent that disc because it's revealing to see how the series was made.",1177804800,,1455,4.627906976744186

I picked up the only version that is currently available around here, and that's the BBC version.  The narrator is different than Sigourney Weaver and I've really like Weaver.  I listened to part of the series with the British narrator and I'm still on the fence as to whether I like this as much or not and whether I'll keep it.  Sigourney's voice is very calming and clear while the British narrators voice is a bit 'lispy' and distracting, at least for me.

The photography is great and the quality of the DVD seems good.  I'm watching it on an HDTV but with a standard DVD player with upconversion. I'm not willing to buy one of the new HD formats until the format war ends and one becomes a winner.

Indeed if you have seen them all or own them all (as i do) little here will be new to you.  This was somewhat shocking to me as so many reviews talk of seeing all these new behaviors that have never been filmed before.  Having seen every minute of this dvd i can say that if you own the lot there is little new here.  Even the scene praised before were the ducklings jump from the tree for dear life and than race for water was already seen in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Life-of-Birds/dp/B000069HXL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Life of Birds</a>&nbsp;and there the little baby birds did it at night without their parents presence using only the sound of their voice to guide them to water.

So is this worth owning if you own the lot, yes and no.  If you own all the others released in the states this is still worth owning, if you have the money and if you are ok with getting a visual update but accept that little here is ""new"" in the way that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blue-Planet-Seas-of-Life-Collector-s-Set-Parts-1-4/dp/B000069HXC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blue Planet - Seas of Life Collector's Set (Parts 1-4)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Life-in-the-Undergrowth/dp/B000EBD9W6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Life in the Undergrowth</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Life-of-Mammals/dp/B00008OM6K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Life of Mammals</a>&nbsp;and The Life of Birds were new.  Without a doubt this is worth seeing for any veteran of all the others.

If you do not own the others I would STRONGLY recommend you seeing all the ones mentioned here in and THEN deciding which or all you would like to own.

For me, I own the lot and have seen them each maybe 10-20 times.  This was a gift and a great one, I am very happy to own it. It is simply beautiful and the dvd transfer here is really good (Compare with Birds where the DVD transfer was horrible).  Sir David is thrilling as always.  However, like the 1st reviewer mentioned because he is not on-location most of his trademark on-location wit is missing.  One can easily see the Directorial style of blue planet here.  By and large i think it works here.  However there are times when one wishes they would borrow from the team that did Undergrowth as the treatment of tight spaces leaves much to be desired.

This nitpicking that am doing is not to discorage people from seeing Planet Earth, but rather to encougare them to see the full BBC version with sir david before deciding to buy *IF* money is an issue.  If money is no object than there is no reason not to add to this to your collection of the other ""Life of.."" and ""Planet"" DVDs.",1177718400,24,4182,6.825187969924812

Planet Earth is at the top of its class. I can't really say much that hasn't been said about this before, but it's simply magnificent. I enjoyed every second of this series.

The narrative is striking, the footage is unprecedented, the score is rousing, and these are THE discs to pop in when someone asks you ""What's better about HD?"".

If you're a fan of nature documentaries, HD in general, or just quality filmmaking, there should be little debate about purchasing this. Get it.

First off, I watch on an Xbox 360 HD DVD and a 720P HDTV. The photography looks amazing. I can only imagine how much beter it would look on 1080P big screen.

Second, they advertise that you will see our planet as you have never seen it before. This is absolutely true. The places and things they show you make you realize how vast our planet is and how much of it really goes unseen.

I ordered the blu-ray set and have been watching the hd broadcasts on Discovery HD.  And I've also tried to watch non-HD broadcasts on the science channel and discovery channel when I missed the HD broadcasts.  I understand that standard cable output is lower resolution than dvd, but I have also compared movies that I have in both regular dvd and blu-ray 1080p.

While the blu-ray and hd-dvd sets are missing a few hours of footage that are included in the standard dvd set, by not seeing this amazing series in full 1080p, you are missing out on so much more.  The value of HD cannot be measured simply by hours of content.  You are getting four times as much visual information per frame.  Even that is a flawed measure.  It is like relating vhs to dvd simply by numbers.  And the cost of a blu-ray disc is much higher than a standard dvd to begin with.  Not all circular pieces of plastic are created equal.  You are not paying more for less.

It would have been better if the bonus episode and the making-of features were included, but even without this is a much better presentation than the standard dvd set.  They do not compare.

In fact, I like Sigourney Weaver, but I did watch one episode of that version on the Discovery Channel, and it sounded as though she was reading an 8 th grade science report aloud after just having awoken, and without benefit of having actually viewed the show - and certainly not as she narrated, judging by the total absence of intonation relevant to the startling imagery on screen.  Probably not her fault, but I resolved to await the upcoming DVD release, and experience Planet Earth as originally intended (but only, apparently, for those smarty-pants Brits).

I just made it through the first of five discs last night, and I already feel like I need to re-watch it just to catch a few more details. This is a series that will only improve with time, and each time you watch it, it will continue to get better and better.

You can literally pause any single frame of the film, hang your TV on the wall and display it as a piece of fine art. With the picture-perfect high definition filming of this movie, I'm actually surprised the production budget was only $25 million.

Conservation is not an easy topic to persuade the public on, but this is the type of platform that will make waves. Throughout the movie, the undertone for the need to protect and preserve our landscape is ever-present, without being over-ambitious or over-simulated.

I set my tivo, checked it twice and patiently awaited that glorious day. The night came and like a kid watching his favorite Saturday morning cartoon, I was glued to the tv. I was immediately captivated by the unbelievable images in the opening segment...then as my brain prepared for the always entertaining,no one can do it like he does narration of the GREAT David Attenborough...I sat back in my chair in complete disbelief. WHO was this? Weaver? The actress? WHY?WHY?WHY? I quickly resigned myself to this new bit of info and decided to give her a chance (namely because the images were so incredible). As this first episode ticked by, I found myself getting madder and madder. Weaver's narration is nothing short of horrible. Her energy is non existant, she sounds like she's reading word for word and let's not even talk about how many times she mentions technology and the great risks taken to capture the images...THAT did nothing but piss me off even more! I AM interested in all the behind the scenes, but save it for the extras...PLEASE......waeving it into the narration like she does (sorry I couldn't resist) does nothing but distract and actually takes you out of the moment! Now don't get me wrong, I think she's a really good actress, but whomever decided to not have Attenborough (the GREATEST NATURE PRODUCER/NARRATOR OF OUR TIME) narrate this thing (dubbed the GREATEST NATURE PROGRAM TO DATE) should be drawn and quartered.
Well.... I tried, as the series went on, to ignore all these things but I finally turned it off half way through the 3rd night...I couldn't take it. For whatever reason, I went to the computer to see if I others felt the same as I, and sure enough, I wasn't alone. I got directed to Amazon where to my absolute disbelief, found what I'd been looking for! Turns out Attenborough DID narrate Planet Earth... for the BBC version! Needless to say, I ordered a copy right away and it arrived last night. It's EVERYTHING the Weaver version isn't. It's informative, entertaining, witty, and full of Attenborough charm....PLUS, there's NO mention of technology or risks or HD cameras or anything...just the show as it should be...all that stuff IS there (they segmented it in a seperate extra after each episode...BRILLIANT!)

My only complaint is that there is a great deal of focus on hunting by big animals - Discovery Channel style.  Sure, these are interesting and easy to film, but I find the beautiful and artful capture of the lesser known aspects of planet earth to be much, much, much more interesting and provacative.  How many more wildebeasts do we need to see get nabbed by crocs???  I'd rather see amazing new footage of the insects crawling on the riverbanks beside this sort of touristy and over-filmed action.  It would also be nice if more factual information were given in the voiceover, rather than mildly annoying and personification-type narrative.

I've been watching the series on Discovery HD and was anxiously awaiting the release of the original BBC series and was not happy with the video quality.  I bought the regular DVD series, but the edges of everything were blurred together.  I watch regular DVDs and get better quality than this.  Perhaps it was a bad run of the DVD set as they might have been rushing to put it out?  I am using a progressive scan with HDMI upconversion and have a 52"" 1080p LCD set.

The music is similarly first rate - a magnificent, subtle score that does full justice to some of the most fantastic shots this planet can provide without being overly distracting. The sequence over the Angel Falls (Fresh Water) was worth the entire set.

The best part is, you can see each and every bit of this quality when you watch it. They don't waste a single second of footage or a single inch of screen-space. It's the most comprehensive, enjoyable, and breathtaking documentary that I have ever seen of any type, much less among those that focus on nature. It completely changes what one expects from a nature documentary. I can honestly say I've never felt more connected to this tiny but impressive rock that we call home. It really opens your eyes and moves you somewhere deep down in your soul.

The fantastic shots from space. The high-speed camera (slow motion, with amazing clarity and detail) shots of dozens of interesting scenes of all types. Wide-angle shots of hundreds of thousands of birds and insects leaping into the air at the same time. Close-in shots of the smallest of animals in the forests of South America. When you watch, for the first time ever filmed or even seen by man, a snow leopard bounding down the side of mountain chasing a goat in HD, you'll know why the cameraman who captured it had tears in his eyes.

If you have ever had a moment watching a nature documentary (or really any documentary) where you thought, ""whoa, that was kinda cool,"" get this series. It doesn't matter which of the two HD formats you have or which of the two you want (if you have the equipment to display HD material). Get Planet Earth. Sit down. Press Play. And have your world changed forever.

2746863,5,B000MR9D5E,"When I first seen the preview of Planet Earth coming to Discovery Channel in Mid March 2007, I thought it would almost be the same type of documentary like all other programming like Blue Seas, etc. But I was wrong, I've seen most of the series, and it literally takes your breath away. Every second of the program is so amazing, that its so astonishing and so beautiful to see what God has created here on earth. Every single detail of a creature or living plant, reminds me of God, it is God Who is the All Mighty, the most Merciful, the most Peaceful, the most Powerful, the most Gracious, and the most Beautiful over all the universe. Planet Earth was such a great beautiful program to watch, it really shows us (humans) that we are not roaming this planet a lone, that there are millions of other species living amongst us. The film crew did a magnificent job filming this documentary in 5 years. I've never ever in my life seen images and beauty of Planet Earth before. Planet Earth literally blows your mind away, its so realistic, that you just feel like crying and getting so emotional, because its so beautiful to see these beautiful creatures that we've never seen before live so graciously amongst us. It is God's beautiful creatures. I loved this program so much, that I had ordered it on April 8, 2007. Its seriously worth it to buy the entire series for like $60.00, because they are never going to film something like this again, probably not in our lifetime, maybe in the next generation. Purchase this series, and enjoy the show, its a mind bottling experience, it touches the most sensitive part of your heart and soul.

There is footage of endangered wildlife so rare and near extinction in this series that they might quite possibly be extinct before they could be filmed again.

Like one reviewer already mentioned, Sigourney's narration was clear, calming, articulate and naturalist or not, you can tell she has reverence for the subjects she talks about.

2746867,5,B000MR9D5E,"Never have I been so moved by a series to exclaim in wonder and actually shed tears of joy at the beauty that surrounds us on this wonderful planet.

I have been watching it on Discovery HD Theater when it premiered in March. The first episode ""Pole to Pole"" set the tone by showing the range of life and species that exist on this planet. The subsequent episodes delve into the habitats one by one. Mountains, Fresh Water, Caves, Deserts, Ice Worlds, Great Plains, Jungles, Shallow Seas, Seasonal Forests and Deep Ocean are the subsequent episodes. This is one series that has to be seen to be believed of what the intrepid cameramen of BBC/Discovery Channel have been able to capture through their sheer perseverance in remote locations. The HD technology has captured some scenes and images never seen before and some seen before but never with this clarity and beauty. 5 years, 62 countries and 204 locations is what it took to make this series, and the result is a lifetime TV series.

This is one series that fascinated my kid as much as it amazed me. She wanted to watch her cartoons but the moment the episode began she was captivated. Both of us  shared together the wonder that is our Planet and it was she who brought up the subject of what we might be doing to it by our actions. We cried when we saw how polar bears have begun to drown as ice melts faster every year. The image of one lone bear trying to walk on ice but falling into the slushy waters, and having to swim longer distances to capture food and finally dying with exhaustion was heart breaking. The series makes no references to the present conditions, just in passing as with the polar bear. I think the directors and producers of the series just wanted to show us the beauty of the natural world, the fight for survival of several animals even when there is no climactic change. And as we keep watching and are filled with awe and wonderment that we're lucky enough to live on this planet, we begin to appreciate quietly in our hearts how we need to change today to ensure that we save our planet.

That is what my daughter felt on her own, she asked me why we were not doing more to save our natural world and I did not have any good answers. The last 3 episodes, Planet Earth: The Future delve deeper into these issues, which I haven't had a chance to see yet.

I watched a clip of David Attenborough's version video on the web before I started watching the series with Sigourney Weaver's narration, and I was disappointed by her blandness and lack of depth. I bought this set like many others to listen to Sir David's narration. I was torn between the regular DVD set and the HD DVD though. This series is good enough to make me buy an HD DVD player just to be able to watch it in its true form! However, the regular set has the Future series and the Planet Earth diaries which the HD set does not have. I loved the Planet Earth Diaries (or behind the scenes) with cameramen, it made a fascinating documentary on it's own, and wished some were longer. If they had the extra material in the HD DVD set, it would have been my first choice.

I had saved the Discovery HD Theatre epidodes on my HD Cable box and I was able to compare their image quality with this Standard DVD version playing on an upconverting DVD player. The Discovery Theater images were crystal clear, and you could literally see each grain of sand on the sea bed or each crevice on a rock face. The Standard DVD looked pretty good when upconverted to 720p and if I had not seen the HD version I would have been quite amazed with the image quality. Right now I've been spoilt by the Discovery Theater version. If you're considering the HD version  it's a great choice if you have an HD DVD/BluRay player. You'll probably not see a better HD disc. This series was shot completely in HD format. From my experience in the media industry I can tell you that this is a very, very expensive format to shoot in especially given the 5 years that it took to make this series. Most television is shot in a regular digital format and then upconverted to the HD format later. That gives great images but they cannot compare to something shot totally in HD. That is the reason the image quality of this series is spectacular. In HD they were able to capture the action which when replayed in slow-motion also stays crystal clear. Therefore you have breathtaking images of a shark capturing its prey (and many others) in slo-mo.

This really is the set to buy. It's like a living documentation of the beauty of our earth, some of which was starting to disappear right as the cameras were rolling. Perhaps, that is why BBC and Discovery spared no cost to produce this series and it is a masterpiece.",1177113600,884,4733,4.425947187141217

2746876,5,B000MR9D5E,"With series like the blue planet and life on earth David Attenborough and the BBC were always pushing boundaries and striving to capture the attention of the audience. The problem is that many of the new adience now watching T.V are used to the 'blink and you'll miss it' fast editing style of both television and film today. With this in mind 'Planet Earth' moves at a far quicker pace than any comparable documentary before it. First impressions are that the BBC have 'dumbed down' but at closer inspection this series has as much to offer as any before it with a wealth of fascinating information. But lets be honest, we want some stunning pictures to watch and thats where this series scores again and again. dolphins 'surfing' a beach for lunch, a sandstorm of biblical proportions sweeping across a desert, caves of stunning beauty and size along with the odd little creatures that live within them and a thousand other amazing creatures and places that we are shown, have explained and then are whisked off to the next location/ creature to marvel at. In truth it's something of a visual theme park ride but thats no bad thing because at no point is the quality diminished, its just that no section is allowed to outstay its welcome.

For me though the crowning glory is that the BBC have at last caught up with technology and produced this in hi-def. Now I know thats old hat for you lot but over here we have not long caught on to Hi-def, and how the picture here shines, if you have the telly for it then this will blow your socks off as the picture is outstanding.

Sound is respectable but a little subdued on the whole. The extras vary according to which version you buy but are really one or two extra documentaries,( I guess bloopers and gag reels aren't appropriate here!),.

This is a major leap forward for what could easily become a bit of a stale genre. If you have already seen it then you have probably  pre-ordered your copy,(if only to hear it without Ms. Weaver reading from a script!), but if you have not seen this then believe me you will love it.

The episode ""Ice Worlds"" is my favorite to date. The plight of the male Emperor penguins taking care of their eggs is especially heart-wrenching. It seems like a truly horrible exsistence for such a majestic animal.  Their waddle is funny too.",1176508800,28,635,4.448275862068965

I was relieved to learn this version has a different narrator than S. Weaver.  The footage in this series is simply remarkable and from my very first viewing of it on the Discovery Channel I've been baffled as to why they chose her to narrate.  She is so dry and scripted.  I'm anxious to hear this original narration.  I'm pretty confident that it will undoubtedly be better.

Bottom line, I think this is a must have.  And don't be fooled by the other HD DVD and Blu-Ray versions unless you own that new technology.  And be happy that it's narrated by someone other that Sigourney Weaver.  That's my two cents worth!",1176249600,35,851,4.532894736842105

Mark Twain would have been flaborgasted and speachless!  It is the reason to own a HDTV.  I have a 70 inch HDTV that made this production all the more enjoyable.  I do not yet own a HD Disc player as I have been appalled by the HD format struggle.  I give the HD DVD format a big thumbs for lowering their player prices much quicker that the Blue-Ray format and will purchase their version of this BBC Series - as soon as a dual-format player is competitively priced.

I guess they needed to go patriotic with an American.  She's a great actress, but unfortunately, she isn't a narrator.  Her voice really doesn't belong.  In fact, when she speaks, your mind expects Aliens 3 to begin.

Regardless of my opinion of the narrator, this documentary is the best ever produced.  My wife and I have been watching it on Discovery HD Theater and I feel sorry for those without HD.  If you don't have HD, get it.  YOU ARE MISSING OUT!  I tried watching a SD broadcast and I couldn't.  It was like playing Circus Maximus on Atari 2600 with a joystick.  I can't wait for HD-DVD or BR-DVD to become standard.  I will definitely get this series on either format then and hold out on buying the SD-DVD version... I doubt even 480p (progressive scan) will do this justice.  Luckily, I have HD PVR from Time Warner and will likely hold onto these for a very long time.

So far, the best two series is the Deep Oceans and Ice Worlds episodes.  My wife was crying watching the emperor penguins struggle to keep their chick alive.",1176076800,17,1167,4.543269230769231

I am a Discovery, Science Channel, National Geographic, etc fan and watch more TV than I probably should.  Of all the nature series that I can remember, this is easily the one I like the best.  Its content is divided into types of environments (mountains, deserts, caves, etc.) therefore, you travel around the world in each episode.  They include spectacular imagery from space.  The explanations are not too detailed, they point out the biggest facts and the unique details about each scene; informational enough to enjoy but not so much that you feel like taking notes.

This is a great series for anyone who even enjoys nature and it for those who have not gotten into it, it provides a great primer.  Image quality and great cinematography make everything look more interesting and spectacular.  Unlike many documentaries where you feel as an outsider looking at the subjects/situations, many of the scenes have managed to make me feel as if I were part of the action.

...if you own an HD system I cannot think of a better use for it.

So, guess what, I'm buying this version for a permanent keepsake & to enjoy D. Attenborough's mellifluous voice over and over.  Love ya Sigourney, but come one, who wrote your dialogue???  ...once again proving how we can thoroughly muck things up here in the new world.  What, do we think people won't understand someone speaking with an British accent, and have to be reminded every other sentence about the never before seen (outside of cinematic production) the quality of the filming? har har.

2746887,5,B000MR9D5E,"having grown up with Sir David Attenborough's natural history programmes I was surprised to see that Planet Earth slipped under my radar. So I ordered the set From Amazon in the UK in January knowing that it will work on my DVD player as it's region free. The set arrived but I didn't have time to watch it so it sat on a shelf until I found out the the Discovery Channel was going to air the series. I suddenly remembered I had the set and decided to watch a bit of the set with my wife before the documentary aired later that night.

As we watched we both gasped with wonder at some of the shots of the wildlife and the filming off the various locations. We both watched the first episode on the DVD and then eagerly awaited watching the others on the Discover Channel later that night.

We settled down to watch the documentary and we both were in shock as the original narration by Sir David Attenborough had been replaced by Sigourney Weaver. In fact my wife couldn't watch the documentary as the narration was so bad - and she's American! So we went back to the DVDs.

We cannot understand why the Discovery Channel decided to replace Sir David Attenborough's narration with Sigourney Weaver but we both agree it was a very bad decision. We both like Sigourney, however she lacks any passion or warmth and appears to be speaking in a monotone voice. In particular there's a spot where in the first episode a bird clears a spot on a branch with a piece of debris from it's area so it can attract a female and Sigourney says  ""missed a bit"" here she could show emotion she is just so lifeless. Sir David's narration is different here and you can hear the passion in his voice.

Speaking for myself, if I muted the sound so I couldn't hear the narration I could instantly tell the this was a BBC production and Sir David Attenborough would be the narrator. So I'm disappointed that the Discovery Channel felt the need to use change the narration. I'm just glad that I have Sir David Attenborough's narration on the DVD as I believe that this was the way the documentary was supposed to sound.",1175558400,87,2095,4.417098445595855

2746890,4,B000MR9D5E,"First off, let me say Thank you to Amazon for clarifying that the great David Attenborough is the narrator for this series. No Attenborough would have meant no purchase on my part. Simply put the most amazing documentary on life and animals and the world around us that I have ever seen. The clarity is simply breathtaking(and that was on my tv brodcast which was in 720P...the HD transfers are in 1080p!!!!).A huge tahnak you to the creators and producers for doing this for people like myself and many others who care deeply about the world around us.

  My one minor complaint has to do with the fact that on the HD transfers, there is absent the supplemental material that is present on the standard defintion release. There is no 110 minutes of behind the scenes footage of what took place on these excavations to these wonderous places or interviews with the people, Attenborough or anyone for that matter. The other special feature not found on either the Blu-Ray or HD-DVD transfer is Planet Earth: The Future, which is a 150 minute documentary(Shot entirely in high defintion mind you) which chronicles how the whole series was created, and how  we can continue to preserve our earth so that we may continue to have wonderous documentaries like this for our children's children. Finally, amazingly there are charging the HD customers around $25 MORE for a product that has LESS content than on the standard defintion release.

Some footage took them years to film such as Snow Leapord on the hunt. And when I, saw the Sharks as they perform incedible acrobatic feats , I thought to myself how truly unfair hollywood has treated these beautiful creatures as mindless killing machines.

Panda Bears doing amazing maternal instincts and sacrifice , to emperor penguins surviving in terrible freezing temperatures and much much more.

This is an epic journey for the hole family and after you watch it, tell your kids that soon they will soon have the job of taking care of this beautiful planet of ours.

2746897,5,B000MR9D5E,"I begged a couple of guys across the hall in my apartment complex to let me watch this mammoth production with them this evening (since I don't get the Discovery Channel on my Limited Basic Cable package).  The two men were agreeable, provided neither college nor professional basketball was on during the 8pm to 11pm time slot.  They ended up loving it as much as I did, and all three of us marvelled at the wonder of nature.

They were far more enthusiastic about the brutal, action-packed hunting scenes than I was, but they tolerated my squealing about how cute the baby animals were (the red panda in particular). All of us had a good laugh over the male Bird of Paradise and his failed attempt to attract a mate---this puts a new spin on the phrase ""trying too hard.""

The ocean life was awesome--but if you've seen The Blue Planet, you'll already be familiar with most of the material covered. We were all disappointed that the creepy-looking Angler fish was not featured--this creature is long overdue for some serious orthodontics--talk about an overbite, or is that an underbite?--It can't even close its own mouth! After the ocean episode, we see from ""behind-the-scenes"" where one of the camera men was all but provoking a hungry shark in order to get a close-up, wearing no more protection than his wet suit and diving gear.

What a project, and what a great dividend we ""shareholders"" in Planet Earth get to behold!  New high-speed camera technology allowed never-before footage of otherwise reclusive and elusive animals (and this nature documentary borrowed tricks from Hollywood to get the best shots, including low-hanging helicopters that kept up with the chase).  If this project doesn't get the ball rolling for some serious conservancy, I don't know what will.

I enjoyed Sigorney Weaver's well-articulated narration and pleasant-sounding voice, but I think she could have put more emotion into narrating the more intense scenes of Planet Earth, especially considering what a fine actress she is.

2746898,5,B000MR9D5E,"Having already watched David Attenborough's entire BBC series Planet Earth last year on the BBC, I was somewhat looking forward to seeing this series broadcast on high definition here on the Discovery Channel today. To my horror, instead of hearing the familiar voice of Attenborough, I hear some female voice reading through the narration. After a brief search on the internet I have found out that Discovery Channel execs decided that they would change the narration for this program to Sigorney Weaver (yes, the actress who hasn't worked since the last Aliens sequel) specifically for American audiences.

Blech!!!! WHY??? I'm sorry I set my TiVo to record anything with David Attenborough as a narrator. You can hear in his voice that he KNOWS what he is talking about. He is PASSIONATE about the subject. Sigourney Weaver is simply awful. Every line is given with the same over-dramatic, lilting, ""I'm reading this from a script"" voice.

Do the execs at Discovery Channel think that Americans are so stupid that they would be confused by Attenborough's pronunciation of the word ""zebra""? Or that he would say ""from a to zed"" instead of  ""a to zee"" or that he would *gasp* use the word ""nil"" instead of ""zero""? David Attenborough practically invented the nature documentary and has been making them since the 1970s. Replacing him with a Hollywood actress is like having Michael J Fox stand in for Howard Cosell to announce boxing.

Shame on you Discovery for cheapening this otherwise extraordinary program because you think that Americans won't understand proper English. Thankfully I have my copies of this program from last year's BBC broadcast.",1174780800,200,1652,5.0625
