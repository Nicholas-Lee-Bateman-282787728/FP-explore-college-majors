7935160,5,B00005AAEG,"This is quite an impressive presentation regarding the details inside British and American Intelligence prior to Dec 7, 1941. The evidence compiled shows in no uncertain terms that FDR suppressed vital info from Admiral Kimmel and to the many thousands of Americans the suffered from Pearl Harbor.

What Bush Jr did regarding 911 is similar to FDR's actions in allowing Pearl Harbor's attack to enter an unpopular war in Europe. When Cheney was the Puppet Master vs when Bush Jr was the idiot without strings is perhaps a matter of conjecture.

The Warren Commission on Kennedy's assassination and the manner the 911 Commission was constructed by Bush Jr to withhold and disregard vital information demonstrate our ""blind"" willingness to live in an Oligarchy instead of a Democracy. What will it take for the voting masses in the US to thirst for the truth rather than the rubbish spewing from TV commentators who are paid enough to hear their own words and not listen.

Books I recommend include ""The Passionate Attachment"" by George Ball, ""It takes a Pillage"" by Naomi Prins, ""Blowback"" by Chalmers Johnson, ""Palestine: Peace or Apartheid"" by Jimmy Carter, ""Predator Nation"" by Charles Ferguson and ""Mounting Evidence"" by Paul Rea. These books look behind the curtain, to the wizards of devastation and suffering. Naomi Prins provides details which of our Congressman we should praise and which more deserving of a tar n' feathering.

7935161,3,B00005AAEG,"I wonder what the historians' take on this issue is nowadays?  The BBC program was made late 80s I think. Surely a lot of water under the bridge since then. I mentioned the thesis, that FDR knew ahead of time that Pearl would be attacked, to a friend of mine, and she said, ""of course, they start all the big wars that way. But I would have done it too."" Well, geez, I don't know--what with the corporatization of warfare, etc,etc. But it always grieves me to think again that all my childhood ideology was built on agitprop history . . .",1269734400,3,538,4.2745098039215685

driving us into WWII to help save the
