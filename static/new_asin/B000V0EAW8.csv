8216090,5,B000V0EAW8,"My sisters and I have occasionally talked about this amazing video which we saw in school as young children.  I recently decided to hunt for it and, to my delight, found it on Amazon!  It is every bit what I remember and still just as incredible.  It should still be shown in every elementary school, both as a fantastic lesson about the life of Abraham Lincoln and as an incredible view of the teacher sculpting in clay a look at what Lincoln looked like through the years.  I heartily recommend this for everyone.  Buy it for you children and be as amazed as them as you watch!!",1387238400,,580,4.383177570093458
8216091,4,B000V0EAW8,"Two things amazed me while watching this 1954 video.  First, the fact that the sculptor performs an oral history of Lincoln while producing an amazing bust of Abe.

Of course it's not up to 2009 video standards, but that is a minor distraction.

Overall it would be a great video for anyone learing the art of clay sculpture.",1259020800,3,325,4.568965517241379
