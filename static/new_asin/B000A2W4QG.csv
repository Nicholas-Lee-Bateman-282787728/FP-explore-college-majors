2354385,5,B000A2W4QG,"Stallone is an ICON in the movie industry.  He is an actor who has developed his career in the Action and Action Drama venues.  A common thread that exists between each of the movies in this three pack is that Stallone allows for his Co-Stars to be developed as characters within the movies.  Stallone figured out (thirty years ago) what Marvel and DC Animated adventures (yes, I am daring to make this comparison) that a Hero must accept himself for who he is as well as encounter an adversary who is mightier and greater than himself.  In essence, the hero conquers himself.  This is why Stallone is ""The Man"" who has longevity in Hollywood and in my movie collection.",1412294400,3,670,4.5966386554621845

2354388,5,B000A2W4QG,"Everyone has probably seen each of these movies.  Assassins with a great cast is my favorite of them.  Cobra I loved when it came out because I was a cop and that famous line Stallone uses in the grocery store I think is every ones favorite scene of the film.  It was nice seeing him doing another movie with his wife at the time.  The Specialist is a fair movie that you either like or you don't.  Sharon Stone was at her sexiest in it and James Woods going crazy in the Police Station was a very funny scene.  I do remember Stallone being interviewed a couple of years after this film and he said the reason it was not as popular as it should be was because ""People rather see me on fire than in a love scene"" as he was with Sharon Stone.",1378944000,2,740,4.068965517241379

If you like action then The Specialist,Assasins and Stallone's Cobra must be added to your Blu ray collection. Also you can't go wrong with the price . Make your purchase you will not be disapointed !",1353456000,5,234,4.7317073170731705
2354391,3,B000A2W4QG,"Although being a Stallone fan, I had never seen any of these movies before taking a chance on this 3-Blu Ray set - for $15 - how could I go wrong? ((These are 3 separate discs in one standard size blu-ray case with the discs affixed to a hinged holder, works well enough.))

Assassins -
Starts better than it ends. Despite an overzealous Banderas I'd say this movie is decent, but the pay-off isn't really worth the snails pace it takes to get where it ends up..I must admit Moore-Stallone play off each other better than you'd think, and Sly is very convincing as a struggling to retire hitman. The funny part of this ''action'' movie is the fact all the weapons are ""silenced"" so all you hear as a viewer is ""pfft pfft pfft"" kind of takes a certain amount of the oomph out of the shootouts! ** Movie - 3 stars out of 5 -- Blu-Ray Transfer - 4 out of 5 ** Budget - 50 million - Box Office - 30 million, pfft!**
---
Cobra -
In one way this is the best movie in the set. Why? Because it's memorable. It is so amazingly terrible you will never forget it. I have to ponder IF this movie was made intentionally bad or if they KNEW it was bad while filming? About 10 minutes in, I told myself I would at least give it 30 minutes, I gave it 27..could not go farther. I'm pretty sure I gave up on this movie right around the ""robot fashion shoot."" I only wish I were kidding. It was nominated for six Razzie Awards including Worst Picture, Worst Actor (Sylvester Stallone), Worst Actress (Brigitte Nielsen), Worst Supporting Actor and Worst New Star (both for Brian Thompson) and Worst Screenplay. ** Movie - 0 stars out of 5 -- Blu-Ray Transfer - 3 out of 5 **
---
The Specialist -
Just like Assassins this is in no way a bad movie, in fact James Woods is almost hypnotic.. but it's just way too slow and peppered with too many unlikeable side characters (Did Rod Steiger think he was doing Macbeth?). I'm not even a Sharon Stone fan but I think she did a decent job here but there is something completely ordinary about this movie like a big ole scoop of vanilla ice cream. I won't comment on the oddly non-erotic sex scene between Stone and Stallone but there's a much better movie here that a better director could have had a field day with. ** Movie - 3 stars out of 5 -- Blu-Ray Transfer - 4 out of 5 **

If, like me, you've never seen these movies, are a Stallone fan and love a good bargain I still say pass on this. Mine's up on eBay now, there is just too little I'd ever want to revisit in any of these flicks, and I should spend my time on much better movies anyway.",1338681600,6,2574,4.17907444668008

2354395,1,B000A2W4QG,"This might be a great deal in terms of the 3-for-$10 price, but these 3 films are among Sly's worst. I like Stallone--he's unreliably a deft storyteller and instinctive actor and I've met the guy and he's nice, to boot. But when he's off, he's off by a mile, like in ""Cobra,"" a bath in action cliches, screamingly bad dialogue, and juvenile nonsense that doesn't even provide anything cathartically peurile. The other two offer more languor in the pace and possibly even less believable scenarios for Sly to chew on.
YOU DON'T NEED THIS!
Go watch the first/last ""Rocky"" or ""Rambo"" movies, ""Copland,"" or ""Creed"" to see Stallone hit his mark. Even his paintings are emotive and full, just throw this triple in with your ""Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot"" burn pile.",1473379200,,757,4.6992481203007515

2354402,3,B000A2W4QG,"there's absolutely nothing different about this 3 Disc blu-ray set except for the packaging
instead of buying all 3 films individually on blu-ray which would cost about $8-$9 each on amazon.com
you can save money by buying all 3 discs in 1 case which costs only $13.90 on amazon which is about $4 somethin' each blu-ray Disc
which is a bargain actually
warner bros are just doing blu-ray recycling that's all i guess to help the customer save money
as for the extras, there are no new extras, just the same extras if any from the Individual releases
ASSASSINS of course has no extras except for the original trailer
COBRA has the same extras carried over from the DVD release which is Directors commentary & behind the scenes footage
THE SPECIALIST has theatrical trailer only
regarding the sound quality for each film i believe all 3 films have  5.1 master audio mixes
it's obvious WB didn't make any effort with improving the sound quality
so you get ASSASSINS Disc, COBRA Disc, THE SPECIALIST Disc on Disc trays in 1 case
nothing different at all except for the packaging
so your better off buying the blu-ray triple set to save money instead of buying the Individual releases
about 2-3 stars for this triple set cause it's just a recycle, there's no new extras added",1436227200,6,1270,4.695067264573991

2354417,5,B000A2W4QG,"If you grew up in the '70s like me, you could not have missed ""Rocky"" or the subsequent sequels. Then, came the 1980s. He was huge then and still is a big name star and actor (The Expendables 1,2,3). I loved all these movies in this set and actually went and saw each of them in the theater. It's entertainment and Stallone is one of my favorite actors. I own several of his movies with ""Escape"" and ""Expendables 3"" being the last ones.
Here, you have 3 of his earlier appearances ~
ASSASSINS, COBRA, THE SPECIALIST. All good in their own way with some decent actors and actresses. If you love Sly Stallone in his movies like I do, then I am sure you will love these for what they are, pure entertainment.
The actor who plays the Detective bugging Cobra all the time is the same actor who portrayed the killer in ""Dirty Harry"" with Clint Eastwood.
Brigette Nielson, you all know played in the ""Beverly Hills Cop"" movies and ""Red Sonja"" with a Conan style Arnold S.
Who can forget Sharon Stone in the 1990s? No one if you grew up and watched ""Total Recall"" and ""Basic Instinct"" in the early part of that decade!
I believe I first saw Sharon with Steven Segal in ""Above The Law"" around 1986.
Antonio Banderas, (Zorro movies) does a good job countering Stallone in ""Assassins"" and Julianne Moore is great also in one of her early roles.
All movies look good and sound good for their age and distributed by Warner Brothers, who may I add, could be better in their home movie market.

All in all, if you love Stallone like me, then you are going to love this set for a reasonable price.",1425168000,,1581,4.377551020408164

2354420,5,B000A2W4QG,"I got this set for under $10, a sweet deal for three fairly decent action films featuring Sylvester Stallone, with the Blurays for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cobra/dp/B004XQO8JG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cobra</a>&nbsp;(1986),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Specialist/dp/B004XQO8FA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Specialist</a>&nbsp;(1994), and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Assassins/dp/B004XQO8OQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Assassins</a>&nbsp;(1995), conveniently packaged in a standard sized Bluray case.

Cobra (2.5 stars)
Stallone wrote the screenplay for this highly violent and somewhat controversial crime thriller that originally received an X rating.  He plays LA cop Marion Cobretti, who is determined to protect model Ingrid Knudsen (Brigitte Nielsen) from a murderous gang, led by the Night Slasher (Brian Thompson).

The Specialist (3.5 stars)
Set in Miami, this over the top popcorn flick teams Stallone with the sultry and sexy Sharon Stone (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Basic-Instinct/dp/B000O5B4C4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Basic Instinct</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casino/dp/B001EIOOV8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casino</a>).  The story is a little cookie cutter, but the onscreen chemistry between the two stars is quite dynamic, highlighted by a steamy shower sex scene.  Stallone plays Ray Quick, an ex-military officer, who operates from a hidden base as a hitman.  Quick becomes involved with May Munro (Stone), who seeks revenge on underworld kingpin Joe Leon (Eric Roberts), who killed her parents.  Quick's ex-commanding officer and now enemy Ned Trent (James Woods), is employed by Leon.  While not great, The Specialist delivers an abundance of action, with Woods and Roberts making some despicable villains.

Assassins (2.5 stars)
Sly stars as Robert Rath, a hit man who wants to leave the business.  When Rath is hired to eliminate a computer hacker (Julianne Moore,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chloe/dp/B0037QGS0K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chloe</a>), he discovers that Bain (Antonio Banderas,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mask-of-Zorro/dp/B002PQKNR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mask of Zorro</a>), another contract killer, also has the same target.  Directed by Richard Donner, what was a pretty fast paced thriller, grinds to crawl, when the setting shifts to Mexico, and Rath's past is revisited.

While these films may not be among Stallone's most highly regarded efforts, if you can get this collection at a good price like I did, you can save quite a bit over buying the Blurays separately.  The Specialist is rather ""special"", as the interaction of Stone and Stallone, is exciting and fun to watch.",1413676800,,2970,7.573913043478261
