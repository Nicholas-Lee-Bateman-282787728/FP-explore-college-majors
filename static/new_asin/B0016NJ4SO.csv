8263492,1,B0016NJ4SO,Crap made on a home video camera. The girls are awful and not even pleasant to look at. The rest is about as interesting as an enema.,1390262400,,133,3.962962962962963
8263493,4,B0016NJ4SO,"Greetings;

Some of the other reviewers have taken to ripping on this or hyping it a bit. I bought this movie never expecting it to be very good as it is more or less a very low budget production, some say indie, I personally think of it more as a fan of anime and perhaps cosplay production piece. Maybe a bit of an experiment of sorts on behalf of the actors and producers involved. I would like to think that they could only get better but so far I havn't seen anything else by them elsewhere, so perhaps not. In any case, I wouldn't say that is was so bad that it was good, because, well, it wasn't. I bought it originally because I thought that the evil rabbit cat thing was supposed to be a spoof on ryo-ohki from the Tenchi franchise, and perhaps it was to some degree, but then again, perhaps not. I mean, you cram a cat and a rabbit together, you can only really get so many different combinations, its like how some people felt that most everyone who designed a robot at all similar to the one in Short Circuit was ripping it off, but no, there are just so many combinations available when one takes practicality into consideration.
Would I say that there were too many parodies? Well, no, not especially. When one looks at films like 'scary movie' which is nothing but, then this isn't really carrying on with too much. It just has a lower budget and therefore is only able to pull them off so far so well. Often not very well, as some have said, the light saber fights looked like they were done cheaply and they were. I don't even know if I would say that it had that many parodies, it almost exclusively borrowed from the resident evil series-to say which, the games, not really the movies actually. Some of it was the matrix, some star wars. Possibly tenchi muyo and maybe a touch of the evil dead series. But even then, that isn't what a lot of the problem was, the main problem I saw was that the movie was largely a string of puns, not always good ones either. Sitting down to a meal and having it turn out to be saucers of milk is one thing, but the scene where you are made to think that one cat girl is being orally pleasuered by another, only to find that the other is painting her toe nails while smacking loudly on gum after stating that 'before we die, there is something I have always wanted to do, I want you to be my first...' first being apparently first toes painted I guess? That is just a bad pun. While not always sexual there were an awful lot of those and it did sort of get a bit old before too long.
My only other beef with the movie, more or less that is, is that if this was supposed to be a cosplay themed movie, which it did sort of make itself out to be, an inventory screen shot where their cat ears had a RPG themed character boost stat score or reference to live action adult themed cosplay movies here and there, then why wern't they in costume? I mean, if it were supposed to be more of a cosplay themed movie which might make it appeal to a larger crowd, then the girls should have at least had some sort of theme to their attire, something outlandish to make their fight scenes stand out a bit more perhaps? A maid, a china-style dress, an alice in wonderland inspired costume or even a bunny girl outfit would have been good-the evil zombie cat-girl was supposed to be dressed like a nurse though I think it looked more like a labcoat myself. Hell, they could have at least had tails, might have meant more work for the puppet master perhaps, but I am sure it would have been something they could have pulled off easily enough.
But still, the movie wasn't totally terrible, if you just don't expect too much out of it in the first place that is. I certainly didn't. It just wasn't that good either. As far as the price goes, it is a movie that amazon has to print off when it is ordered, so it will be new, though frankly I would have just tried to have found a used copy myself if that had been an option, but still, it isn't so bad either. Just order something else for super saver shipping and then suddently it isn't that bad.

Thank you and take care...",1295913600,2,4108,4.231847133757962
8263494,1,B0016NJ4SO,"A five star review for this mindless drivel? Really? I noted that this item was $14.95 and I will state that the price is TOO DAMN HIGH! The acting is below mediocre and reminds me of a five year old in a school play. Only these girls are old enough to be out of high school. This was probably filmed on a low quality camera that would be $500 at BestBuy, the graphics were probably done on iMovie, and so many blatantly obvious rip offs from multiple media outlets. The so called PARODIES aren't even that good and there are too many, the writer needs to learn not to cram so much crap parodying in one movie. By the way the cat girl thing was STUPID. Now it would be one thing if these chicks were hot, but nope their not. Therefore there is no appeal to the whole cat girl thing. I don't know why the other reviewers have given it a good score but I know that if I could have I would have given it negative 10 stars. This might be a good movie if it was free and you had nothing better to do but I doubt it.",1295481600,,1010,4.0049504950495045
8263495,4,B0016NJ4SO,"So this movie reminds me of the ones I used to make on Super 8mm film back when I was a kid.  They really put a lot of effort into making this, but obviously you're going to be giggling at the production values here and there.

While many horror B flicks have nudity, don't be expecting any in this movie. All the kittys are just adorable to watch though.

Many many wacky off beat pop culture references through the whole movie will keep you on your toes!  A fun time.",1240358400,,469,4.177777777777778
8263496,4,B0016NJ4SO,good to see that bad/good live action anime is good for those who want a good movie to release tension.  Saw this movie after a hard day at work and laughed hard enough to release the stress....,1212364800,2,194,4.243243243243243
8263497,5,B0016NJ4SO,"This is Indie flmmaking in its true form.  Nowadays, everyone sees films at Cannes and Sundance and believes that ""Hey, Independent Film is just like Hollywood...""  In reality, Independent film is about doing things that aren't being done in the Mainstream.

This film is a great example of having an idea, shaping that idea, watching it grow and change and ultimately become something truly unique and original.  It doesn't take Million-dollar budgets to produce great entertainment. (I'm looking at you, Old-school BBC productions like Dr. Who and Red Dwarf...)

Yes, the film is campy; It's supposed to be... but it's also very fun.

In the spirit of Anime, video gaming, and even good old Horror films, (Come back to your roots, Sam Raimi...) this film plays with all these themes and has a great time with it.",1207785600,,814,4.905109489051095
