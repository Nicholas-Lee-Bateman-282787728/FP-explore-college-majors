My French is limited to much slower dialogue, but the speaking in this movie went too fast and I lost too much in translation.  I am sure it was advertised as having English subtitles.  I know this movie has been released with English subtitles from other sources.

Actually, the movie itself is very good with many subtle statements a native speaker would pick up on, but I have to rate it unacceptable due to the mix-up concerning subtitles being only in French and Italian.",1370476800,,616,4.719626168224299
