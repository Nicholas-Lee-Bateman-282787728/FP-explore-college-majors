RASEN is the original sequel to RINGU, reviled by fans, but loved by me for its sci-fi / horror take on the ghoulish goings-on. It makes a nice alternative to RINGU 2, which is, of course, the sequel that seems more connected to the original.

2334011,5,B0009X765K,"Sometimes explaining that something is unexplainable can explain a lot, let me explain.

BASIC PLOT:
Director Hideo Nakata's Ringu follows a beautiful reporter Reiko Asakawa as she investigates a videotape that kills you a week after you watch it, after her niece Tomoko's death is linked to the tape.  After tracking down the tape at a cabin her niece and some friends stayed at, all of which have since died, she brings it to her ex husband Ryuji played by Hiroyuki Sanada (The Last Samurai, Sunshine) to help her explain things.  As the story unfolds we learn that Reiko, Ryuji, and their son Yoichi all have the power to see things, powers not as strong or evil as the mother and daughter on that tape however.

ROUND 1.  The Explanation - RINGU
What I meant by my first line was that in Ringu they mention the strange girl on the tape not being from this world and they do not go into great detail of why she does the evil she does or how.  The girl on the video is left more of a mystery to us which I found more effective.

ROUND 2  The Tape- RINGU
There is also no attempt in Ringu to go into some weird explanation of how the tape came to be.  In Ringu it's just there it's evil and some evil can't be explained.  Also in Ringu the tape is kept simpler aka less confusing, there is no ladder or dead horses or this big long back story attempting to explain every frame which adds about 30mins to The Ring which both confuses and takes away from the mystery.

ROUND 3  The Scary Kid- RINGU
The reporter's child in Ringu is just a kid, he has the power to see things like his parents but he is less gimmicky and doesn't attempt to get laughs.

ROUND 4 The Scares- RINGU
The scares in the Ring were geared to make you jump, some of them with cheap loudness or scary faces, which Ringu does as well but in a more subtle way.  The Ring starts strong and probably has more attempts at ""scary parts"" as far as quantity but Ringu's are more effective and build up to the climax.  Ringu's scares are geared to stick with you, I can imagine seeing this if you are young and how many sleepless nights it would give you.  We can basically all relate to growing up and hearing urban legends.  Ghosts, curses, the paranormal and certainly the unexplained are all real.  Using videotape, telephones, and televisions to scare us in the places we live really hits home and is relatable.  Keeping the little girl a mystery makes her all the more scary at the end.

ROUND 5  The Climax -RINGU
Overall I thought The Ring started strong and then got weaker as the film progressed.  Ringu on the other hand started solid, rested for a moment, and then got stronger to the end climax.  As for the ending climax and the television, in The Ring the girl is all digitized and snowy, not very effective.  In Ringu the girl is a girl, very creepy, crawling out of the tv set without fake looking special effects, and the glimpse you get at her disfigured face that you never fully see is terrifying.  The ending of The Ring came off corny where The ending of Ringu cements it as a great horror film.

KO! Ringu Wins!

Even though I gave high praise to RINGU in comparison I still feel The Ring has solid scares and started strong as they were following the original movie closely but then it just got confusing attempting to explain everything.  All and all not bad but Ringu is great.

RINGU
RAISEN - Sequel to the Ring
RINGU 2- Back cover says it reveals more truths to the haunted girl on the deadly tape and she attempts to possess a young boy, and begin a new cycle of terror.

2334018,5,B0009X765K,"For years I've watched American horror movies.  From a teen to an adult, I've probably seen it all...from stalker to slasher, from aliens in outer space to boogeymen in closets.  So. With that in mind.  I've become tiresome with American horror films.  It seems the new wave in horror films are nothing more than fake snuff films, i.e., Hostel, Saw 1 and 2, Wolf Creek. As someone who has a undergrad degree in world history, I've read enough about torture from Romans to the Nazis.  I really don't want to sit in a theater or watch at home for 90 some minutes film that has no real plot, just victims to torture (basically American films today are upping the anti on the age old Jasonish vs. teens films).  I realize the films are not real, but, torture like that does happen in the world, and I don't want to watch torture just for torture sake.  I want a bit of mystery, a bit of horror, a bit of dreamlike phantasmagoria.  That is why I have fallen in love with Asian horror movies like the Ringu series.  The Ringu series, along with other Asian horror films like Audition (which yes has torture in it, but it is woven into the greater plot, not the full focus of the plot like Hostel), are captivating in how well the stories are constructed.  You aren't sure what is going on, but slowly, surely, you find yourself drowning in the murky uncertainty of the lines between reality and dreams, as with the haunting and stalking of Sadako.  These films are intelligent, they are scary, and they have a great deal of imagination involved in full focus.  I highly suggest these films if you are tired of the remakes, the torture, the painfully dullminded American horror movies that are being pumped out in theaters today.",1136505600,14,1722,4.5372168284789645
2334019,4,B0009X765K,"Ringu Anthology of Terror consists of the four Asmik ACE Entertainment produced Japanese theatrical films (Ringu, Rasen, Ring 2 and Ring 0), transferred to DVD and distributed by DreamWorks Studios in their original aspect ratio and Japanese Dolby Digital 5.1 surround soundtrack with popular language subtitling, including English.

This review considers general plot themes and summaries. Every intention is made to minimize spoilers that might compromise viewers' enjoyment.

Ringu and Rasen, the first two films in DreamWorks's DVD collection, imaginatively synthesize characters and story lines from author, Koji Suzuki's first two novels in his popular Ring trilogy. (Suzuki's third novel, Loop, has not been filmed, but production discussions are underway.)

In Ringu, after learning that their niece, Tomoko, was one of four teens who died one week after viewing a mysterious videotape, Reiko Asakawa, a Tokyo news reporter, and ex-husband, Ryuji Takayama, begin an investigation. Having viewed the videotape themselves, along with their young son, Yoichi, they realize their own fates may be imperiled. They must race against the clock and take a literal leap in faith in an effort to solve the terrifying riddle of the videotape.

In Rasen, Andou Mitsuo's forensic examination of a former medical school classmate reveals a clue that links his friend's death to the demise of the videotape's viewers. In his investigation, Andou discovers a deadly mutant virus that forces him to make a personal decision about the videotape that also may affect humanity.

Ringu 2 reunites original Ringu director, Nakata Hideo (also director of the U.S. sequel, The Ring Two) with the cast and crew of Ringu. We find Reiko, Ryuji, and Yoichi catapulted into an alternate cycle of mystery, terror, and possession, leading to different fates. An investigation into the disappearance of Reiko and Yoichi by Mai Takano, Ryuji's talented student, reveals startling new facts about the videotape and its source.

Ring 0 details decisive events that take place some 30 years before the mysterious videotape appears in Ringu. A young actress, Sadako Yamamura, joins a Tokyo-based theatre company and, after witnessing the terrifying deaths of several cohorts, becomes the centerpiece of an investigation by journalist, Miyaji Akiko, who believes the troupe's deaths are connected to the suicide of Sadako's mother, Shizuko, and the deaths of those who publicly-derided her at a scientific demonstration of her psychic abilities several years earlier. So, how does all of this connect with the mysterious videotape and its viewers' demise? That's for you to find-out!

The DVD collection cleverly combines critical elements of terror, mysticism, science fiction, and horror--just like the novels! I found DreamWorks' collection entirely enjoyable. The films certainly are not without its critics and criticisms, particularly over complex storylines, plot deviations, and unanswered questions. Perhaps what is required of viewers is a little gestalt-work to connect the pieces of the four films to find greater meaning! Notwithstanding, the films generate abundant food for thought. Clearly, Suzuki invested considerable care into crafting his novels as did the films' writers, directors, cast and crew who adapted the story into their cinematic incarnations. Video and audio transfers on the DVD set engage the viewer on standard televisions and home theater systems.",1127952000,3,3453,5.565714285714286
2334020,3,B0009X765K,"This is far too late... and far too expensive for being so late. If you are a true lover or collector of these films you probably already have them from international sources.  Why is the price high?  For people who are obsessed with the american films to buy and make american companies more money.

In spite... no one should buy this set.  It's absolutely stupid that they treat the consumers as such morons.  It's obvious the films are much cheaper in Asia where they orginate and while they complain about bootlegs they purposely hold these releases until they make money on their crap.

The films are terrific.  Honestly you have to enjoy them compared to the low quality American remakes. Although the ring got me going, Ring 2 seemed to be a waste and the originals are terrific compared to them.  The linage is confusing but if you read on line reviews of all film, you can understand the outsider... that was supposed to be Ringu2 but is titled differen't and understand JAPAN knew RINGU2 would make more money, like america knows this set will cost you double the cost of importing them from Orginal offical releases.

They ought to release them beforehand.  Maybe people like to compare on contrast.  Although anyone with a brain knows that the american versions are the equal to a pile of bear turds.

I can only say The grudge and Darkwater USA version was good the rest were garbage so why hold out on your buyers... The films abroad are better.  They're more risky and unique.  I'm frankly insulted by the price.  The films are terrific.  However like other budget sets, this should not be sold for over $29.99 or less.",1127001600,6,1634,4.641114982578397

Because American distributors DRAGGED THEIR HEELS in bringing us the ENTIRE Japanese ""Ring"" series, I GAVE UP MY VAIN SEARCH and bought the German 5-disk ""Ring Universum"" five months ago!

Why such hesitance???  Believe it or not, there's a real, thriving market for East Asian films here in America, and they don't have to be ""artsy"" like ""Hero"" or doctored-up to surgically remove all traces of Eastern culture (ala the US cover art of the Japanese ""Shall We Dance"" or MTV's butchering of ""Volcano High"").",1124841600,,626,5.282828282828283
2334022,4,B0009X765K,"A minor movie trend is remaking Japanese horror movies, especially ones that originated from horror writer Koji Suzuki. The first of those films was ""The Ring,"" the terrifying Naomi Watts remake, but the original films are an even more fulfilling experience, since they show the whole story.

""The Ringu Anthology of Terror,"" despite that really cheesy name, includes the four Japanese films that concern the malevolent Sadako and the haunted videotape. Expect a lot of bizarre twists and turns, truly horrific experiences, and two sequels to the same movie.

In ""Ringu,"" Reiko Asakawa (Nanako Matsushima) has just found out that her young niece has mysteriously died in terror... and so have three of her friends, at the same time. The only link is a videotape, which urban legend says will kill you seven days after you watch it. And Reiko has seen it. Now she and her ex-husband Ryuji (Hiroyuki Sanada) must unravel the mystery of the videotape -- and the malignant ghost who haunts it.

""Rasen"" is a nearly-faithful follow-up, based on Suzuki's novel ""Spiral."" Doctor Mitsuo is mourning the loss of his only child, and things don't get better when his old pal Ryuji (Hiroyuki Sanada) turns up dead, a victim of Sadako's videotape. But the strange virus in the tape has taken an unexpected turn -- and soon Mitsuo discovers that Sadako is determined to be reborn...

Audiences weren't too thrilled with the scientific slant of ""Rasen,"" which sort of depleted the horror. And so the film company had ""Ringu 2"" made, which completely ignored ""Rasen"" altogether, and is based solely on the ""Ringu"" film. Confused yet? It's not as good as the original, but is better than average as a sequel.

In ""Ringu 2,"" Mai Takano (Miki Nakatani) wants to know what happened to her boyfriend Ryuji (Hiroyuki Sanada yet again), and the doctors are baffled by the strange facts -- it turns out that somehow Sadako stayed ""alive"" for thirty years in the well. Elsewhere, Reiko (Nanako Matsushima) has escaped death, but now fears that her son is beginning to show signs of Sadako's power.

""Ring O"" offers a look at the backstory of the malignant Sadako Yamamura. Once this young girl (Yukie Nakama) was a shy, sweet-natured young actress, haunted by frightening visions. But then other actors start dying. The secrets of Sadako's past, and the ""dark"" alter ego who has been kept locked away, combine into a frightening ghoul...

There has probably never been a horror series quite like the ""Ringu"" movies -- two disconnected sequels, one prequel, one original movie. What's more, it's a slow-burning kind of horror, which is based more on visceral human fears than on cheap jumps. If you thought Watts' ""The Ring"" was good, just wait until you see the whole story.

""Ringu"" and ""Ring O"" are probably the best and most horrifying of the series. ""Rasen"" suffers from too many explanations of the ring virus and Sadako's presence, while ""Ringu 2"" just suffers from a mild case of sequelitis. However, all of these films are worth seeing; even at their worst, they are still creepy and wonderfully strange.

Most of the acting is quite good; Sanada and Matsushima both do excellent jobs, though Nakatani seems completely baffled and wooden in ""Rasen."" She's better in ""Ringu 2."" But the biggest props have to go to Nakama, who gives a magnificent performance as Sadako, both as a shy, misunderstood young girl, and a malevolent ghoul on a killing spree.

Anyone who saw and loved ""The Ring"" will probably be hiding under their beds with the ""Ringu"" series, with its spine-chilling mixture of science, horror and Japanese supernatural beliefs. Well worth getting.",1123200000,50,3643,4.937908496732026

The sequels (Rasen and Ringu 2) though left me with a bad taste.  They took the mystique out from the first one and tried to go at another level but simply failed and felt like they were written by a student that wanted to push his direction to it instead of following the story of the first one. Rasen is truly more guilty of this.

Ringu 0 was also a let down.  More of a rehashed retelling of the legend/origin of the first one, which added all sort of stuff that just were make up so to make a new movie.
