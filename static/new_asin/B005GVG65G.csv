An evil starfish alien (who also conducts Strauss) infects half of Japan, turning the inhabitants into antler-wearing zombies with exploding heads, and mommie dearest stars as the principle antagonist.

4694326,4,B005GVG65G,"Helldriver is one of the most ridiculously over-the-top films, ever.  This Japanese zombie movie is huge dollops of gratuitous, graphic violence stacked on top of outrageous, super-cheesy gore effects slathered over a large heaping pile of plain insanity.  It's like a Saturday morning live-action cartoon where the characters are hyper-violent bags of highly-pressurized blood and the story was written by a drunk, sleep-deprived lunatic.
In other words: The movie is bad -- no, I take that back, it's seriously, outrageously bad -- but you just can't stop watching just to see what the heck they might show next on screen.
Between the nonsense storyline, massive plot and logic holes, and the tanker truckloads of fake blood being sprayed all over the place, I found myself laughing more than I have in a good long while.
Helldriver is not for the squeamish, despite how ludicrously unrealistic the violence is; but for those open-minded individuals brave enough to give this movie a shot -- it's a real laugh riot.",1417219200,2,1017,5.083832335329341
4694327,5,B005GVG65G,"Absolute insanity. And that's a good thing. If Helldriver was the product of any other culture it would be far too absurd to watch. But somehow being Japanese, not only is it not absurd (at least not in a bad way), it pulls you in and carries you away on one amazing ride.
Highlights include a car made entirely of zombie parts, a sadomasochist zombie that takes a little too much pleasure in having a chainsaw-sword stuck in its rectum and a Godzilla-sized zombie made up of thousands of regular sized zombies.
Some final thoughts:
* No expense was spared on the gore effects.
* The physical laws of the universe simply do not apply in Japanese horror/sci-fi.
* Yumiko Hara (Kika) is incredibly easy on the eyes.",1412812800,9,713,4.578125

4694332,1,B005GVG65G,"First off, there are a lot of quirky, creative films that have come out of Japan (Big Man Japan, I'm looking at you), and a lot of truly awesome horror flicks made by Japanese directors.  But not this one.  While conceptually interesting, Helldriver is let down by consistently poor production values and bad acting.  I'm convinced the director's liberal use of blood fountain imagery - while stylistic at the outset - ends up being used more often than not to hide poor camera work. I'm a bit puzzled by the gushing reviews, and can understand why some of the *concepts* might be appealing, but the execution leaves so much to be desired.  Of course, some may care more about the concept than the execution, and that's fair, but looking at the promotional image for the film, one is led to believe that the quality of the movie is much higher than it actually is.",1367539200,3,864,4.590909090909091

4694334,4,B005GVG65G,"[NOTE: IN JAPAN AND CHINA, SURNAMES ARE FIRST!] I own three films that star pretty Shiina Eihi, who is unusual in writing her name entirely in Hiragana (this one, ""Audition"" and ""Tokyo Gore Police""), and I've seen ads for others that I may buy later. She is rather tall among Japanese ladies at 1.70 meters and stately. In this film, she and her brother are ghouls who eat her husband's legs near the opening of the film. His daughter Kika played by sexy Hara Yumiko has her heart removed to replace Eihi's that a meteor knocked out. Yumiko gets a mechanical heart and hunts zombies with a chain saw katana (42"" samurai sword). She looks sexy in a tight black bodysuit and does some pole dancing. The zombies have Y-shaped antlers on their foreheads. I like some gory movies but not all certainly. My brother likes them all. He loved ""Hallowe'en"", but I hated it. I do like Shiina Eihi's movies, especially this one, and I want to see much more of Hara Yumiko who is on the box of this DVD.",1362528000,2,990,4.445054945054945
4694335,3,B005GVG65G,"Japanese Splatterhouse director Yoshihiro Nishimura defies you to find a plot in his newest gross-out, HELLDRIVER. An asteroid comes barreling to Earth and crash-lands into Kika's abusive mother, unleashing a deadly virus that turns half of Japan into zombies and sends Kika spiraling into a coma. When she awakens, she has been fitted with cybergenic enhancements and a chainsword which she must use to destroy the growing legions of the undead before they overrun the living! Though not without its share of unbelievable, jaw-dropping moments of zombie gore, HELLDRIVER quickly proves to be another painfully stupid example of the modern J-Horror trend, where quantity always precedes quality when it comes to exploitation. Looking for nothing more than to sicken and offend, Nishimura often exceeds his goals once again, packing everything from Zombie Hitler to zombie babies into the film's exhausting runtime. The comic gore just has so little impact when it is taken to such extreme lengths, but then, Nishimura plays to a very specific audience. In spite of all the random on-screen insanity, we do find a glimmer of hope. HELLDRIVER addresses population concerns, disease control, human rights, and the growing drug problem in digestible terms through this undead allegory. HELLDRIVER will certainly find its place amongst fans of TOKYO GORE POLICE, ROBOGEISHA, and the like, though mainstream audiences should tread lightly.

I will admit Helldriver had a few scenes that were cool, namely the epic katana/m16 scene (no intention of spoiling) but overall, I don't think it was put together too well and although in awe at it's level of absurdity, I never felt twas too special a film.  Something to go alongside the collection of Machine Girl and others, I suppose.

Vampire Girl Vs Frankenstein Girl surpasses this by far, as does the triple director threat: Mutant Girls Squad.",1355529600,2,660,5.092592592592593
4694338,5,B005GVG65G,"this is yoshohiro nishimura's best film so far. it is an ultra-violent, super-gore comedy horror done like no american film maker could ever pull-off. sushi typhoon is might just be the new tokyo shock, hopefully without the double and triple dvd dipping(well, they better not!). what i am still hungry for is the sequal to tokyo gore police(yoshihiro nishimura? we are waiting, what is taking you so long? it has been four years, get to work on it!).

my favorite in this film is the ever talented EIHI SHIINA(tokyo gore police, audition). i love these kinds of horror films with the english subtitles turned on.

all the one star reviews for this film are those whom don't understand japanese shock horror and should just stick with the crappy american stuff broadcasted on the syfy channel, or you all need to grow a SET.

most modern american horror does nothing for me, unless it is indie-horror like hatchet, laid to rest/chromeskull, after party massacre (a death metal horror film) or the ever crazy canadian ryan nicholson. mostly all of americas horror legends like wes craven, sean s. cunningham, john carpenter, tobe hooper, and shockingly peter jackson(bad taste, braindead=aka lgf's dead/alive have either sold out to the mainstream, have retired or moved to europe to be able to get what they want done their way. even i have since become skeptical of most ntsc region 1 dvds due to censorship. most pal region 2 dvds are often more uncensored then their ntsc region 1 versions. glad i own an all region dvd player or i would be going out of my mind, without having a choice of olaf ittenback,etc.

4694341,5,B005GVG65G,"If you enjoy the occasional film featuring vehicles constructed from body parts and 8-limbed zombie sword fights, then this is probably right up your alley.  For a Tokyo Gore Shock subgenre I give this an ""A.""

This typical/low-budget Tokyo Shocker begins with an odd man chumming a pack of some manner of zombie-demons with severed human body parts.  As they feed on the anthro-carrion our chummer ""fishes"" for deadite heads using a sharp hook at the end of a rope.  Then he removes something that could only be described as an evil wishbone growing out of their foreheads.  We later learn that these ""horns"" are sued as street drugs, unstable explosives and are the source of undeadity in these zombies. When things get out of hand a random chick (our hero, Kika) with chainsaw-swords and some mean stripper pole skills comes to the rescue...what ensues is just plain silly...a truck flies through the air and Jenga's a 50' tower of zombie-demons, one of which a spine with a head at the end of it growing out of his head.

This entrail-rich gem is typical of the genre.  There are lots of arterial sprays unleashing floods of blood beyond reasonable human body's capacity, detonating body parts, dismemberment galore and, of course, Kika's backstory.  As a young girl Kika came home to find her crazy evil mother (Eihi Shiina) and her Japanese punk-redneck uncle in the middle of making sushi out of her father's legs--in front of him with his legs flesh-picked knee down.  Out of nowhere a meteor strikes her bloodlusted mother ""through"" her chest.  So naturally, she rips out Kika's heart and uses it as her own.  Then she turns into some space-zombiism typhoid Mary and plagues Japan faster than in 28 Days Later.  She is then entombed in some hardened mucus cocoon, from which she emerges as the hive-mother space zombie queen.  Meanwhile, a public figure from a secret government agency stitched up Kika and outfitted her like a samurai-ninjette with a lawnmower engine in her chest so that she could control infected populations.

Unlike the devastatingly slow back-story-telling in Machine Girl (2008), Helldriver (2010) is much more effective and stylistic in explaining the origin of this space-zombie outbreak complete with news updates and slapstick government public health infomercials warning about the effects of using ground-up zombie wishbones like it was cocaine.  There are even farcical advocates in support of the not-so-deceaseds' civil rights.

Director Yoshihiro Nishimua (Vampire Girl vs Frankenstien Girl (2009); Mutant Girl Squad (2010)) learned a lot from writing/directing Tokyo Gore Police (2008).  For example, everyone loves Eihi Shiina (Vampire Girl vs Frankenstien Girl (2009); Tokyo Gore Police (2008); Audition (1999)) and chainsaw fights are cool!  Other nifty additions to this gore flick include an assaulting hail of zombie heads, a zombie miscarriage, a zombie dance party, a zombie head crotch bite, a chainsaw-sword up the tush, a car made out of body parts, and a 50' tall zombie made out of other zombies that then turns into a giant zombie 747.  The fights are most interesting mid-movie.  The zombie baby, attached by the umbilical cord to zomb-mom, is used as a whip-dagger-harpoon.  There's a zombie with katanas ""growing"" out of it that has a sword fight with a bladed car.  And there's an eight-limbed, sword-spider-zombie nude acrobat chick with baby arm-tusks and a crotch hand.  Say what?  She's probably my favorite.

For fans of the subgenre this is just plain, exploitative, super-gory fun.  By the way, watch to the end of the credits.  There's a cute ending.",1332374400,12,3620,5.070945945945946
4694342,4,B005GVG65G,"Another Sushi Typhoon production, fun with over the top (and freakin crazy)special effects! I waited for this one to come out and wasn't disappointed, this film has so much craziness I couln't begin to scratch the surface! Zombies with antlers & people get high off of the antlers!!!who could even think this stuff up? All in all a fun film, up there with Meatball Machine & Samurai Princess as far as the special effects go.

While I found both the female antagonist and protagonist to be sensuous and drop-dead gorgeous, that wasn't enough to keep me from putting this movie on my ""to trade in"" pile... YET... I don't know...

I've been waiting so long for the next break-through zombie movie that I'm tempted to write it myself. ""Helldriver,"" I had assumed by looking at the packaging, was not it. Therefore, I assumed that the director was going for good ol' cheesy, campy fun. It was, but some of the special effects were so bad they were distracting. The zombie make-up was awful, and the hands were mere rubber gloves. And the head ""antenna"" paid homage (directly or indirectly) to Lovecraft's ""From Beyond."" And the female spider zombie with swords - and then later - M16s for legs? ""Planet Terror""! And I didn't know what the blank to make of the priest!

Well, definitely not the worst movie I ever saw... but pretty dang close to it.",1326844800,4,1016,4.546448087431694
4694344,5,B005GVG65G,"This movie was just what I expected it would be, given the product description and other information I've read.  The two female leads (Yumiko Hara and Eihi Shiina) are terrific and I hope to see each of them starring in more movies.",1326844800,2,232,4.523809523809524
4694345,5,B005GVG65G,"As a fan of Yoshihiro Nishimura films in specific and weird Japanese films in general, I have taken to collecting such gems as Machine Girl, Tokoyo Gore Police, Alien vs. Ninja, Meatball Machine, Samurai Princess, Versus, Tokoyo Zombie, Hard Revenge Milly, and Oldboy and a bunch of other Takashi Miiki works. When I found out about the release of Helldriver, purchasing it was an easy decision to make. Truthfully, I am more than a little surprised that it didn't get more positive reviews by those who have watched it and posted here on Amazon. I mean, it's totall original, with plenty of weirdness, comedy, splatter, horror, and an absolutely absorbing rollercoaster storyline.

Kika (Yumiko Hara) is the heroine of the story - a young woman tormented by an awful sociopath of a mother (Eihi Shiina of Audition and Tokoyo Gore Police) and an equally deranged uncle - who wakes from a coma a year after an alien dust storm blankets Japan, turning its inhabitants into flesh-craving zombies. When she wakes, however, she is different. Someone has surgically fit her with a chainsaw samurai sword rig, the motor of which is attached to her chest. One finds out later that a secret branch of the government, unbeknownst to the Prime Minister, has altered Kika this way in an underground medical compound, all for the purpose of decreasing the number of infected citizens. And the proceeds to kick a lot of zombie ass, from enormous monster abominations to chainsaw-wielding undead to horrible patchworks of limbs and heads!

These aren't your average zombies, though. They have blood-red eyes, skin liked cracked plaster, a T-shaped (almost Y-shaped, actually) protrusion coming out of their foreheads, and sometimes some pretty disturbing body alterations. Now, the T-shaped protrusion, referred to in the film as the undeads' ""horns,"" are the source of their continued living dead state, and removing them kills the zombies permanently. The T-shaped protrusion, tumor, or ""horns"" are also harvested by criminals to sell on the black market as a street drug, somewhat akin to cocaine it seems. What's more, the protrusion is also volatile and can explode if not handled properly by the smugglers.

Because of the zombie menace, Japan's government has a huge wall built to split the island nation in half, separating the uninfected citizens from the zombie-infested wasteland. Both the public and the government are torn between considering the zombies ""deceased"" and having them exterminated and declaring them ""human"" and preserving their human rights. Apparently it's a big issue.

Without spoiling the film's conclusion, the government eventually sends Kika and a small group of misfits into the zombie wasteland to eliminate the ""zombie queen,"" who just so happens to be Kika's terrible mother turned even more evil and strange. The battles that ensue are visually stunning, creative as it gets, and more bizarre than one could possibly imagine without having seen the film. Believe me, you haven't ever had a film experience quite like this one!

From what I've learned recently, Sushi Typhoon/Nikkatsu and Well Go USA will be releasing some more films in the very near future - ""Yakuza Weapon"" and ""Dead Ball."" Personally, I can't wait to check 'em out!

So...there's my review for a movie that, in my opinion, hasn't received far enough praise.",1324771200,7,3352,5.1300366300366305

The zombies grow horns that are like explosive crack and are hunted by a drug syndacate. The zombies are able to meld together after being hacked apart.
