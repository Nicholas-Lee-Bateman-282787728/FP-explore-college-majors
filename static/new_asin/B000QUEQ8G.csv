2841074,4,B000QUEQ8G,"When it comes to cartoons these days, the classics seem to be often overlooked, but for Nicekeloden, they've really brought out the best in animation from shows like Jimmy Neutron, The Fairly Odd Parents, and especially Spongebob Squarepants. Nevertheless, the cartoons keep showing just how much fun the show has maintained its joy for so many viewers young and old alike. The past several seasons have brought out some great moments for our favorite freinds from Bikini Bottom, and with its latest round of shows finally on DVD, it is sure to please even more joy for Spongebob fans.

Spongebob Squarepants Season 5, Volume 1 is the first half of Spongebob and his friends Patrick, Squidward through some of the most interesting cartoons ever. The DVD has been remastered well, and includes some of the latest chapters in Spongebob's life including Slimy dancing, where Spongebob, and Squidward enter a dance competition with Squidward placing himself inside of Spongebob, and tries to dance to win the trophy, after being originally rejected for the contest. Another great episode, Friend Or Foe?, looks back at the origin of why Plankton and Mr. Krabs originally became rivals, after being rejected for food at a local take out joint, and try to develop what becomes the krabby patty. Although the episodes miss out at times with what Spongebob had sucessfully made then, considering there are more cartoons at a shorter time, they are still a lot of fun to watch.

All in all, I loved watching a lot of the new shows Spongebob Squarepants have aired, and they are just a true delight. But, some newcomers might be a bit dissapointed, hoping for more shows like the previous complete 1st, 2nd and 3rd seasons brought out on DVD. Still, if you haven't seen Spongebob yet on Nickelodeon, you may want to watch these and enjoy the laughter.

2841075,2,B000QUEQ8G,"I remember Spongebob seasons 1, 2 and 3.

Spongebob was loveably naive, Patrick was cute and naturally dim witted and Squidward was quiet, kept to himself unless he was annoyed.  The world was ideal, and the episodes were clever enough to appeal to children to adults.

Now the episodes are rushed and are quite insulting to one's intellect.  The worst part though is the magnification of each characters qualities.

Spongebob, rather than being the loveable naive character, has been written to be as obnoxious and loud as possible. Both voice and action.  I can hardly stand to listen to his voice anymore because of the over exaggeration of his annoying voice which used to be subtle.
Patrick is written to be as stupid as he can possibly be, and Squidward is utterly piss*d off all the time.  In addition, every other character has been destroyed as well.

Avoid this DVD set, get the classic set of Spongebob seasons.",1188777600,24,922,4.791139240506329
2841076,3,B000QUEQ8G,"I loved the earlier seasons, and I'm ok with this new one, but the new episodes are not as clever as the first episodes in the first seasons. The new ones arn't as funny, the story lines arn't as good, and they have gotten WAY more childish, sadly. Also, my problem is that the new episodes have these stupid sing along songs much to frequently. SB used to be like a child/immature adult show. Now it's faded into one of those new Nick show types for babies. It's better than any other cartoon on Nick, but season 5, or maybe 6, will probably be the ending for the SB franchise.

When I buy the seasons, one by one, I will make sure to get this season because I love the show as a whole. But this season is definetly not as superior as seasons 1, 2, or 3.",1186617600,18,755,4.101351351351352

2841152,1,B000QUEQ8G,"Excuse me but am I seeing a trend here?

Exibit A:
After creating a FAMOUSLY outrageous and innovative animation series called ""Ren & Stimpy"" our hero-genius John K. (Kricfalusi) starts to hear the irritating sound of accountant's calculators and the intolerable ""contractual obligations"" of totalitarian Nickelodeon management. After reaching the end of his rope with the project the artistic master and creative guru heads for the door. Ren & Stimpy then head for the floor.

With infantile grotesqueness and little complex/surreal humour left, the series heads for ""lowest common denominator"" viewership, comedy, falling ratings and finally a dismal end. Sadness and ancillary merchandise swept up by a needy audience is all that remains. Nickelodeon makes money but not friends.

Exhibit B:
Invader Zim starts to pick up higher ratings for its innovative and fascinating characters/plotlines. Subsequently wins award for best cartoon introduction and begins to get noticed for its fantastic artwork, storyline and comedy. Creator Jhonen Vasquez (comicbook creator, self-taught artist and writing genius) declares he will no longer work for Nickelodeon and Invader Zim crashes to the ground in the style of ""Ren & Stimpy."" It has been mentioned (see: hearsay) that Mr. Vasquez was SO UPSET with the contractual terms of his employment at Nick that he vows to never work in animation again. A great loss to us all but I personal love his comic artwork/stories and, after collecting as much as I can find I await any more that Jhonen Vasquez will impart to us. Once again, sadness and ancillary merchandise swept up by a needy audience is all that remains. Nickelodeon continues to make money but not friends.

On a personal note: Zim, Dib, GIR, Gaz, Tac where are thou? I miss you deeply!!! Johnny the Homicidal Maniac rocks! (nuff said)

Exhibit C:
Spongebob Squarepants- the apparent centerpiece of Nickelodeon popularity begins to fall out of favor in seasons 4 and 5. We find that Stephen Hillenburg, marine biologist, artist, animator and creator of Spongebob is no longer with the star-studded voiceover cast (e.g. Tom Kenny, Bill Fagerbakke, Roger Bumpass, Carolyn Lawrence, Clancy Brown, Mr. Lawrence, Mary Jo Catlett, Lori Alan, et al.) Although no conclusive evidence is yet seen [by me anyways- ;P] we wonder why his genius and this animation masterpiece is on the decline and near or perhaps at its demise. As its ""rudderless"" stories seemed contrived and uninspired without the Mr. Hillenburg ""at the helm"". Spongebob's sexual orientation and/or interest is still in dispute. ;)

Sadness and ancillary merchandise is, once again, all that remains- and LOTS of it (especially the merchandise.) Nickelodeon again makes money but not friends.

Is this simply the nature of any series masterpiece designed by the innovative genius of animation masters as the aforementioned Kricfalusi, Vasquez and Hillenburg (Outside of the Nickelodeon focus could I be allowed to mention Ralph Bakshi somewhere in here?); or are we seeing the absolutism of an unbending corporate structure within Nickelodeon (et al.)?

Is this about morality/censorship? Is this about corporate domination of copyright holdings? Is this about the American penchant to keep animation focused myopically on children's interest alone (ask Todd McFarlane)? Am I far too interested in this subject than I should be (now that's a good question indeed)?

So many unanswered but important questions lurk out there in the foggy silence.

Would they rather keep a chokehold on their contracted employees/creators and make SOME money on remaining merchandise/dvds and potential lifelong ""enemies""? Or would they rather release their grip, allow the exciting innovations to continue, profits to increase, characters/stories to attain a ""beloved"" status (see WB & Chuck Jones)?

The jury is still out...

The names have not been changed to protect anyone as I suspect that few are totally innocent. I am merely an observer (a messenger if you will). LOL

I love so many of the programs like the aforementioned and my wife and I are lifelong animation fans. These characters, casts, creators, etc. will be forever remembered and appreciated by my wife and I (we have no children.) and our friends with similar interests. And to Nick there is thanks for providing the huge amounts of laughter and affection for the characters and the great artwork. Will we have more? Will it be grand in scope and fascinatingly complex/artistic? Will we have it ""freely given"" from the creators?

Once again the jury is still out...

I am aware of how long this is. My apologies but if I'm going to go on a gripe I might at well seek ""closure through release"". :)

Ahhhh! That's better.

We now return you to your regularly scheduled mediocrity. LOL!",1208044800,13,4799,5.19559585492228
2841153,3,B000QUEQ8G,"I rarely watch SpongeBob Squarepants on TV, so usually the first time I see the episodes is when they're released on DVD.  I read some of the poor reviews of this set and thought the show would probably be better than they suggested.  I thought wrong.  There really is some magic lost in this season.  There are some flashes of the usual brilliance here and there but, mostly, these episodes are forgettable.  They sometimes take an idea and push it to the absurdly extreme (""Night Light,"" ""Rise and Shine,"" ""Spy Buddies"").  Also, some seem a lot shorter than the others.  A good sign for the next volume is that Disc 2 is much better than Disc 1, which indicates improvement during the season.  I'll definitely be checking out Volume 2.

Disc 1 (2 stars):
""Friend or Foe"" (2-parter)--Mr. Krabs tells a tale of when he and Plankton were adolescent chums picked on by their classmates and how they came up with the idea to start a hamburger joint.  Cute but that stupid Patchy the Pirate keeps showing up.
""The Original Fry Cook""--SpongeBob meets Mr. Krabs's first fry cook, Jim, who makes patties so good they take SB on a spiritual journey (what was in those patties, anyway?  The flashbacks do look like they were set in the '60s...hmmmm).  Feeling inferior, SB resigns, but Jim explains why SB is actually the best fry cook for Mr. Krabs.  This episode is unrealistic.  How can anyone be a better fry cook than SB?  Just watch ""SB v. the Patty Gadget.""
""Night Light""--After reading a scary story, SB becomes afraid of the dark and uses so many night lights he summons Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy and a fiendish moth.  This episode is very annoying.
""Rise and Shine""--Observe a typical Patrick morning.  This episode is totally lame!  We all know Patrick is a moron but come on!  His stupidity here is bordering on the ridiculous!  It also seems very short but, for this episode, that's probably a good thing.
""Waiting""--After sending in 99 Kelpo box tops for a prize, SB becomes obsessed with waiting for his free toy to arrive in the morning.  Not very good, except for the Patrick/gift/cake/fork bit.
""Fungus Among Us""--SB gets the ick and infects the entire Krusty Krab. Gross.

""Spy Buddies""--Mr. Krabs hires Patrick and SB as spies to watch Plankton's inevitable next scheme.  The ending of this one is a little much.
""Boat Smarts""--An instructional film from Mrs. Puff showing a driver with boat smarts (Squidward) and a driver without boat smarts (SpongeBob).  For once, SW is the positive example; however, in this film, I think it would be better to be the driver without the boat smarts as the one with them keeps getting into accidents.
""Good Ol' Whatshisname""--Mr. Krabs creates a contest to see which employee can learn the names of all the Krusty Krab customers.  The prize being  a cruise, Squidward, for once, is a willing participant.  SB, of course, already knows all the customers' names; SW has to resort to more unorthodox measures.  One of the better episodes, but I'm a little puzzled by the ending.  How did Patrick end up behind bars?
""New Digs""--Was something cut from this ep?  SB trips because he put his eye blinders on before racing to bed and, in the next scene, he shoots into bed with no comment.  Anyway, SB oversleeps and clocks into work late.  SB, of course, is devastated and decides to live at the Krusty Krab: a dream come true for SW but not for Krabs or his customers.
""Krabs A La Mode""--Mr. Krabs won't let anyone turn up his thermostat, so Plankton creates a freeze at the Krusty Krab, but they use the icey conditions to make money another way.

Disc 2 (4 stars):
""Roller Cowards""--SB and Patrick are afraid to ride Glove World's new sensation: the Fiery Fist O Pain, but both are ashamed to admit it.  The mascot of Glove World is called ""Glovey Glove""--I think the writers are starting to lose some of their creativity.  Good episode, though.
""Bucket Sweet Bucket""--Plankton gets SB, Patrick and even Squidward to renovate the Chum Bucket while Plankton goes after what he really wants.  I like how Squidward painted the restaurant.
""Breath of Fresh Squidward""--SW gets so mad at his neighbors he installs an electric fence around his house.  He, of course, gets shocked and turns into a friendly, work-loving chum who makes SB jealous.
""To Love a Patty""--SB makes the perfect Krabby Patty, falls in love, and spends all his time with ""her"" even as ""she"" rots.  A shower cap on a Krabby Patty???  You've got to be kidding!
""SpongeBob Versus the Patty Gadget""--Patchy the Pirate (actually tolerable here) tells a story--in Dr. Seuss-like style--about SB competing against a patty-making machine built by Squidward.  I like the line ""The crowd was impressed, they cheered full of glee.  All except Patrick who had to go pee.""  This episode, while short, is pretty funny.
""Money Talks""--Mr. Krabs's wish comes true: he can talk to money.  Be careful what you wish for!
""Slimy Dancing""--Squidward thinks he's a shoe-in to win a dance competition.  When he doesn't make the cut, he takes over SpongeBob's body (SB is a sponge, afterall).
""The Krusty Sponge""--Food critic Gene Scallop--who looks suspiciously like Today show's film/book critic Gene Shalit--reports on the Krusty Krab and praises SpongeBob.  Mr. Krabs decides to market SB by using his image on everything (hmmmm, sounds familiar).
""Sing a Song of Patrick""--Patrick writes a song and SB helps him get it on the radio.  Actually, this episode does not work on my disc.  Did anyone else have that problem?",1200700800,24,5514,4.804670912951168
2841154,4,B000QUEQ8G,"...at least 3 times a week, no joke!!

They live for Spongebob, Patrick, Squidward, Mr. Krabs, Gary, Sandy, and Mrs. Puff.

But I don't and can't blame them really; Spongebob is a catch and from time to time, the show itself is actually quite funny. It all takes place at Bikini Bottom, a town underwater, away from most sharks and beneath all the humans who dwell on earth. From time to time, Spongebob and Patrick make it a rare habit to come up out of the water, and take a looksee around. Immediately, they puff up like Mrs. Puff, Spongebob's driving teacher. He never learns how to drive successfully either. He's no good in that department, and should stick to the Krabby Patties!

Anyway, I'm gonna describe and then rate all of the characters and then rate a few aspects of the actual film:

Spongebob Squarepants: Very silly, upbeat and so nice to everyone that is nice to him. Even if you're mean, he tries to see the good in everyone. My second favorite character. A

Patrick Star: Super goofy and kinda spaced out, he's basically Spongebob's right-hand man. His personality, while goofy, consists of being nice to Spongebob but he tends to have an anger spout here and there. An OK character. B-

Squidward Tentacles: Another keeper, character-wise. He's the moody, selfish and very negative critic of the series. Many enjoy his company, especially Spongebob, but funnily, Squidward doesn't feel half the happiness when around the yellow sponge. He'd rather have his hands around his neck, doing the unthinkable. B+

Mr. Krabs: Very work-oriented, and a decent man who tries to instill the work ethic into Spongebob and Squidward also. Spongebob follows, and Squidward carries on, as if Mr. Krabs said NOTHING. Not one of my favorite characters. C-

Gary: My absolute favorite! I can't really pinpoint a true-blue personality to him, but he makes cat sounds, is usually quiet, which leads me to believe that he's an introvert as opposed to an extrovert, and loves Spongebob till the ends of the sandy ends of Bikini Bottom. A+

Pearl Krabs: The whiny, big-headed whale-daughter of Mr. Krabs. She's so ridiculously spoiled that I would slap her if I was an imaginary fish, residing in Bikini Bottom. She's not a bad character, and is usually super-dramatic. B+

Sandy: Level-headed and sweet, Sandy is nearly as friendly as Spongebob. Get on her bad side though, and she's unafraid to show you a piece of her mind! B

Mrs. Puff: She holds one of the absolute worst jobs in Bikini Bottom; trying to teach the unteachable Spongebob to drive! She goes crazy every time she spends 5 minutes with him, and for very, very good reason. A-
