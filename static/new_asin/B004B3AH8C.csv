8421406,4,B004B3AH8C,"""Peter and Pompey"" was made in 1988 by the Australian Children's
Television Foundation which was a non-profit organization
established to ensure that children have access to high quality
media created especially for them. There were a number of
television productions made under this banner and this feature
is one of them.

Although it is good, clean, wholesome entertainment aimed
specifically at children and the fact that children have important
roles to play in the features, they still provide reasonably good
entertainment for adults should they care to watch them.

The story which is set in present day Australia is based on
mythology. In other words there is no factual evidence to support
it, so you can believe it if you want to.

Three children including Peter discover an ancient Roman boat in a
cave near their coastal town in Queensland. The cave also contains
the manuscript of young Pompey who with his father and others were
cast adrift in the ocean to avoid political persecution at the hands
of the Romans. After a long voyage at sea, they arrived off the
coast of Queensland. Dying of thirst and starvation, Pompey's father
(the leader of the expedition) made a pact with the Gods whereby he
pledged to burn the boat if the Gods intervened and saved them.
This the Gods did but due to unforeseen circumstances he was not
able to burn the boat and until it is destroyed it will continue to
curse all who come into contact with it.

The story tells how the curse adversely influences the lives of the
children and the small town in which they live. The children must
decide whether to save the boat or destroy it and save their little
town.

A good, interesting story well played out. It is harmless fun and
worth the time to sit and watch it.

There are a few quotes in the dialogue which are strictly Australian
but that should not bother anyone.",1302134400,7,1868,4.714723926380368
