8173524,2,B00007BHO8,The band is great of course but the video quality on HD is not great. A bit blurry and some defects that I would not expect. But I gotta have Steele pulse in any case and am happy I got the video.,1464825600,,196,3.6904761904761907

8173526,3,B00007BHO8,"I bought this at a bargain bin for some change I had in my pockets and glad I did, for two reasons. a)it's good b) the quality leaves a lot to be desired.

The show : it's from back in 1990 and I liked it despite the odd selection of songs other reviewer pointed out as coming from failed records. Well, musicians will try to push those songs if they like them, so hats off to them for not playing just the old proven and relialable hits alone. There are 10 songs energetically played along 57' and I liked all of them. The UK audience is on fire and carrying soccer whistles and will  deafen you in between songs. Great singing but the two guitarrists are low in the mix so they're inaudible at times. The sound is mostly keyboard-oriented and the the 3-piece guest wind section is loud and strident. If that kind of sound is intentional or a result of a flawed mix I don't know. Seven cameras were used but the sluggish editing makes them appear as just 3 most of the time.

the picture : picture a direct transfer from a scraggy, battered vhs tape that has been buried for 2 decades and you're halfway there. The pic, despite a generous bitrate, is scraggy, washed out, lacks any kind of sharpness and worst of it all, looks kinda slightly out of focus and is plagued by every king of analog AND digital artifacting known to man.

the audio : maybe the best part of this release. Drums and bass are totally spot on; not only every can is loud and audible but the low end pumelled which such authority through my front towers I had to turn my sub OFF !! The upper end is a tad exaggerated so the cymbals sound a little harsh but no big deal there.

Conclusion : it's OK although there are several Steel Pulse dvd releases that are way better but to the best of my recollection none from this period so you might want to add it to your collection if you are a completist and/or you can get it for little money.",1414713600,,1911,4.239010989010989
8173527,2,B00007BHO8,"The two biggest groups to dominate the 80's Reggae scene were Steel Pulse' and Third World' and although I loved them both on Vinyl when it came to live performances there was NO comparison! Steel Pulse was notorious at the time for giving as one reviewer wrote ""LUKE WARM"" performances and when I saw them it was just that. And hey I shouldn't be complaining because I got into that show for free.. by the bands drummer! However if your a true fan of Reggae and you want to get blown away be patient and wait for the release of THIRD WORLD's LIVE DVD coming out next month.. I'm sure it won't dissapoint! Cheers",1136160000,,612,4.37719298245614
8173528,4,B00007BHO8,"This dvd is good, but I would have preferred a few more songs. The performance of the band is good, but the audience was too small , and did not seem to be exceptionallly energetic.

To the reviewers in Barbados, this is not Jazz, so don't expect to hear trumpets like those from heaven. This is reggae, so the horn men will only come on periodically. Thats enough.

Any true steel pulse fan should have this dvd. It should be more energetic, but it has good clean audio, and video. Good reggae music from a legendary band. They don't make them any more, so get this dvd.",1091577600,2,571,4.327102803738318
8173529,1,B00007BHO8,"I purchased this dvd ( paid $35) only to get a defective disc that couldn't play in any machine. I had it exchanged only to get another defective disc that showed partly. The little bit that I viewed before getting a full refund was nothing more than a badly produced vcd. This is not very good for the reputation of this band... hmm,very disappointed.",1063411200,,352,4.515625
