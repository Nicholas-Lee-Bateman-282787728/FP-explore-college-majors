4481486,5,B004V2S4SS,"I too anxiously await the release of Medium's sadly, last season. And I echo kudos to everyone involved in getting and keeping it on the air: producers, directors, actors, production crews, etc. So, what's next? Our expectations are high...blow us away, soon! Also, it seems that either film or T.V. should nab this for ongoing future movies. Because this season proves how much more deeply the stories can go. The world is filled with more real-life Allison's to inspire!",1301270400,5,472,4.987341772151899
4481487,5,B004V2S4SS,"Like so many others, I have watched Medium since day one and never missed a single episode.  It really was one of the best series ever to air on TV. I loved it. The cast was superb, the acting excellent and one of the most believable families ever portrayed.  You actually felt as though you were watching and getting to know a real family. I do miss them all. I experienced some of the most unexpectedly moving moments of all my many years of television watching during the run of this show.
For me there will not be another like it.  It's hard to find just the right combination of attraction and talent to relate to very often.  It's just too bad the average TV audience cannot appreciate something so wonderful.  I look forward to purchasing the final season.",1300665600,2,763,4.460431654676259
4481488,5,B004V2S4SS,"This is a very good season and I think the show ended on a high note. This show allows you to know your charaters and they never switch actors, with the exception of Lucky (but I think we all liked the change. Although the orginal Lucky was very good.) I enjoy having the DVDs because I can watch them over and over again. I you want something that will never leave with the regret of buying it, this is the series. I may step away for a month or so but I always come back. This show is full of morals and takes many twists and turns never leaving you suprised.",1297036800,4,561,4.063063063063063
4481489,5,B004V2S4SS,"Few ""law and order""-type shows leave one with a profound sense of knowing the characters' family lives like the back of their hand anymore. (This isn't the days of ""Cagney & Lacey""-type programs, after all.) Few make the heartstrings pull when it's time to go off the air for good, but this one did. I have watched the show since the beginning of it's run, not always faithfully (especially when their time & day kept changing) but I have seen the last two seasons without missing an episode. It was an exceptionally well-crafted show, especially when one considers the premise- focusing on a psychic who works for the D.A.'s office, has a husband, three kids & lives in Phoenix, AZ. Not exactly thrilling, based on that bare description. But the combination of polished, powerful, talented & yet understated acting combined with more surprises in the plots than curves in a West Virginia back road kept this going for seven seasons.

I am single & child-free, but the family element of ""Medium"" is what made it most memorable for me. The seventh season left Joe & Allison at odds more often than before as career, age & family changes caused them to look at life anew. We saw Ariel head off to college (and her real-life portrayer head off the show, too). Joe's mother also left the canvas. Both actresses departed in ways that played out beautifully, but nonetheless sadly, for the viewer. Allison, Manuel Devalos & Joe Scanlon faced great challenges both in their work environment & in their personal relationships, and the tests thrown at them created much of the show's tension. Det. Scanlon became even more of a well-rounded character to me this year, as his weaknesses somehow also became his strengths. Devalos, who was sympathetic even when in the wrong, provided the program with a strong career anchor for Allison while also keeping her impulsiveness in check. Not a children's show in terms of graphic viewing, there were some moments that are cringe-worthy even to a horror-film-lover's mind, mostly when someone innocent was the victim of a crime.

But while this season had it's share of violence & scares, I am ultimately left remembering the warmth that permeated this creation from start-to-finish. It always left me guessing at who was the true villian each week, more often than not was thoroughly entertaining, and it certainly left me caring about the main characters within it. I will miss this gem of a program. It had that magical combination of heart, beauty, love, tragedy, horror & yet also the charm that only the rarest television show possesses. Those who worked on it these several years should be commended- your fans will miss your great work, but look forward to what you will accomplish in the future.",1295654400,63,2738,4.860813704496788
4481490,5,B004V2S4SS,"WOW!! That's what I have to say about this amazing series! I had no clue it would run 7 seasons due to being slapped around by NBC for its first 5 years. It premiered back in January 2005 as a mid-season replacement and its first 16 episodes were simply astonishing! Patricia Arquette played Allison DuBois excellent. It was almost if the dead were omnipotent! Every where she looked she saw a dead person good or bad, lost or confused and tried to at first block them out by drinking! After NBC canceled the show in May 2009 (although it was outperforming their other shows) CBS picked it up for its remaining two seasons.

Back to season 7 (the final season), was just simply amazing!! The writers, actors, directors and producers all worked hard as hell to produce one of the finest prime time shows of the 00's and 10's. Season 7 began right where Season 6 ended as Allison continued to recover from her brain tumor. Her eldest daughter Ariel went off to college this season and we got to see more acting from the middle daughter Bridgett. The first episode ""Bring your daughter to work day"" was a take on the film ""Freaky Friday"", that being said, Bridgett and Mom switched places and it was nice to have a comical relief after all the sad ordeal that ended with season 6.

The series continued to get better with each episode. We got to see more details about Detective Lee Scanlon's life and how he and his deceased brother were treated as children, and his precious daughter Lee by Lynn whom he married. Another great episode was ""The Match Game"", in this episode we see Allison seeing hearts on people's foreheads and thinking they are matched and fate is working, but does it work for the greater good?!?

Personally, one of my favourite episodes is ""Talk To the Hand"" when Allison gets a skin graft and her hand goes wild. The coffin scene is absolutely funny even though this is a crime show, a bit of humour now and again always helps. ""Where were you when...?"" was an episode that left a chill in almost all who like Medium. It brought back memories of catastrophic events and after Allison thinks a mega quake is coming she later learns a bomb is in a parking garage.

As the season progresses, we learn Joe's mother is dying and this little detail goes back to Season 4 episode ""Burn, Baby Burn"" in that when Allison told Joe's mother that she would be alright after she confided in Allison that she had to stop by the Mayo Clinic on the way back to Michigan. I think that episode ""Blood on the Tracks"" was one of the saddest in the season. Laura San Giacomo made an appearance in ""The People in your Neighbourhood"". Laura is remembered for ""Just Shoot Me"" a 90s sitcom. This episode wrongfully accuses a convicted sex-offender of molesting her daughter. But, the question is who really hurt her daughter??

As the 2011 episodes approached after a long break viewers realized the show was coming to an end. We got to see Allison's brother back, but this time it was her real life brother David Arquette, the great actor from Scream! I think they should have cast him as her brother originally, but that's just my opinion. Allison and Joe had some troubles too in the remaining episodes over Allison going back to get her law degree and Joe getting his masters. I think we can all agree on the last episode unless you haven't seen it, which I won't say much, but it is very bittersweet! I hope the DVD has an extended version of Episode 13 like they did with Season 1 episode 1. I really think a Series Finale should be 2 hours not one! Remember that Kelsey Grammar just kidding, but seriously it should have been two hours to get everything in.

The good thing about Season 7 and the whole series was watching the whole family change. They were a true life family, faced hardships like everyday people do. They lived in a modest house, struggled with jobs and had plenty of ups and downs along the way. The daughters grew which was wild seeing Ariel go to college when you sit down and watch Season 1 as compared to season 7. She really grew up! Bridgett became more funny. I think Maria Lark has a comedic career ahead because of her whit and she just cracks me up. The littlest girl Marie grew up to become a good actress too. She didn't really have many roles, but in Season 6 we got to see her act in the episode ""Sal"" where she fell in love with the Alarm system the DuBois family installed.

Overall, I give the whole series 5/5 because for everyday people it dealt with everyday issues from the economy, the wars, crime, struggling to find jobs, money, and dealing with teenage children and young children. Jake Weber and Patricia Arquette had a great chemistry together and I would recommend that you order this today or go out and buy it June 21, 2011! Season 7 comes full circle and I for one am glad the show got a proper finale instead of just canceling it! It brought closure to the show and didn't leave us wanting more like some series that just end! I believe if CBS hadn't moved it to 8 pm on Friday nights and left Ghost Whisperer run for a 6th Season, then Medium would have got its full 22 episodes. Now that the Supernatural shows are practically gone, my question is what kind of shows will be next? As reality shows are starting to wane, it makes me wonder what the 2010's will have for us in the coming years! So get ready and get Medium the 7th and Final Season this year!! Au Revoir Medium!! Maybe Ariel's character will do a spin-off? We will see!

P.S. I forgot to mention Season 7 will be in Blu-Ray too!! I hope they release the other 6 on Blu-Ray as Well!! And for Patricia and Jake, I wish you two long and happy careers!! You both did amazing jobs making this series! Thank You both!",1295568000,3,5732,4.43168880455408

I was shocked to hear ,now that they are more forth coming about Allison's true gift,  that my favorite show is being cancelled.

4481504,3,B004V2S4SS,"Despite being (at best) a skeptic of the paranormal, I found most episodes of Medium enjoyable. They offer interesting, if sometimes macabre, detective work coupled with realistic, warm personal and professional interactions of likeable main characters. Beginning with season six, however, plots are often flawed by extensive, surreal dream sequences offering false clues and disjointed time lines.

The 13th (last) episode of season seven has been widely panned, but it was on a par with several others in the last two seasons. After reading several negative reviews, I conclude that serious weaknesses in the final episode arise from writers' awkwardly collapsing story lines from what would have been other episodes had budgeting supported their production.",1494806400,,760,5.608695652173913

The last episode was terrible though.
If it wasn't for that last episode I would urge EVERYONE to watch this show.
But alas, every time I think of this show, I cant help but think of that last awful episode.

4481623,3,B004V2S4SS,"The first few seasons are good, but at a certain point (which I will let viewers figure out) Allison becomes extremely annoying. It's a pretty defined point in the series when this happens, too. Plus, there are monumental inconsistencies that start occurring at that same point in time, inconsistencies that defy any person's sane reasoning. For instance, the writers made certain to let viewers know that Allison's dreams aren't reliable when it comes to those close to her, words often spoken by Allison and just as frequently by Joe. But whenever she has dreams that affect her family, she freaks out, annoyingly so, conveniently forgetting the unreliability of them. Even the final episode contradicts the rules set the entire series. Through the entire series, people appear as they did at the moment of death, yet Joe doesn't appear like he was in a plane crash and Allison, who died at approximately age 80, is suddenly as young as Joe when he died.

Allison is also very selfish. There's a point in the series you really want Joe to walk out on her because everything is always about her. I like Patricia Arquette, but she doesn't do well with crying or rage. Her crying seems fake and her screaming and yelling is nothing short of obnoxious. (Even on her current series CSI: Cyber, it hasn't improved.)

I wish I knew about all of these things before I started watching because I would have never started. If you plan to watch the series, do so in small doses because Allison is annoying. People probably didn't notice these things when it was on the air because there was a week between episodes.",1456099200,3,1606,4.752688172043011

Some liberties the writers took with clairvoyance were somewhat annoying; but I imagine that, looking at it from the outside, they thought game show buzzers and hovering numbered blurbs were as good mechanism as any to inform the audience of her experiences.  Nonetheless, most shows were quite good, and many were as awesome as  an X-Files show re a serial killer, a tarot reader, a doll collecter, service staff, and Mulder and Scully.  That episode set the bar high, but Medium doesn't dissapoint.",1456099200,,555,5.065934065934066

Viewers either love or hate this episode. It's a shamelessly manipulative tearjerker, it speaks a harsh truth, it employs a silly and overused plot device, and ultimately it ends as it has to, because at its heart Medium is the love story of Allison and Joe.

Let's start with the silly and overused plot device, the all-powerful charismatic drug lord who heads a giant Fortune 500-sized drug cartel. Is there anything more lame, dumb, dopey, and cliched? If your only knowledge of American society was TV dramas you'd be scared to go outside, for all the all-powerful charismatic drug lords behind every tree and lamppost. What is the purpose of this drug lord? At the beginning of the episode Joe is on a plane returning from a business trip in Hawaii, and talking to Allison on the phone. The plane goes down during their conversation, and no one survives. That's right, they kill Joe. It's sudden and shocking, but that's life. There are no guarantees; anything can happen to any of us at anytime. No bodies are recovered, so Joe's funeral lays to rest an empty casket.

But is he really dead? Seven years later, as Allison is working as an assistant district attorney and prosecuting the all-powerful charismatic drug lord she has a dream that Joe is alive, has amnesia, and has been working as a drug mule all these years for the man she is prosecuting. Like woa, what are the odds? So Allison makes a deal with the drug lord and torpedoes the case in order to be reunited with Joe. As ridiculous as this storyline is, it gives Allison a chance to do what she does best, which is being the ferocious mama bear who will face any peril and do anything to protect her loved ones. My favorite moments in Medium are when Allison does this, throwing caution to the winds and facing down enemies, friends, and anyone who gets in the way of taking care of the people closest to her.

So Allison and Marie, who is a teenager, travel to Mexico to find Joe. And they do, and Allison and Joe have an emotional reunion. Ah, but as is so often the case, it's all a dream, and Real Ghost Joe interrupts it and tells Allison to wake up. In reality it is just a few days after his death, and he sends Allison this dream to show her how she and the girls could carry on and have good lives. But Allison takes over the dream and turned it into her wish-fulfillment. So Real Ghost Joe has to come back to tell her that he really is dead. Allison, of course, is devastated, but she has to unequivocally accept that he is dead and gone.

We have a lot of conflicting ideas about what happens after death. Death is the end; it's final, it's unforgiving, and once you're dead that's it. Or, death is a transition to another plane of existence, so we don't really die but rather move on. On Medium the dead hang around and get in the way and make trouble. Allison talks to dead people; why can't Joe hang around and keep her company like his dad does? In several episodes the show hints that the dead are supposed to move on and not hang around bugging the living, and in any case Joe's ghost hanging around with the family would not be healthy, as they would not be able to move on and live their lives. (The idea of what it would be like for the dead to remain active in family life was addressed in detail in the excellent episode ""It's a Wonderful Death"".)

But, as this is a love story, Joe and Allison must eventually come back together, which they do when Allison finally passes away after a long and good life. I'm willing to forgive the preposterous drug lord device because the rest of the episode is true to the internal logic of the series, and so their eventual reunion makes sense. It's a bittersweet end to a wonderful series.

What makes this series so wonderful is its realism; yes, I said realism. In 99% of hero dramas the hero is a man, and he does all kinds of crazy and awful things, and if he has a family they're just props because Hollywood has no idea what to do with the wives and children of crime-fighting heroes, except shove them out of the way as much as possible. He does whatever he wants, comes and goes as he pleases, gets in gun battles, car chases, and fist fights, and the only consequences are when the writers insert a whiny wife so he has an excuse to go lone wolf because by gosh, a man has to do what a man has to do. It's all about him.

In Medium we get a real family with fully-realized characters, and when Allison goes off to fight crime there are logistical problems to deal with like feeding the children and getting them to school, disrupting Joe's job, money problems, and all the daily hassles and rewards of having a family. Joe is the all-time great TV father and husband; he does something virtually no other TV dad has ever done, and that is take his wife and children seriously,  truly care about the things they care about, and support them unquestioningly. Joe is fully involved with his family. This is the show's great strength, a believable and lovable family that changes and grows over the years, and every family member is consequential. I'm sorry to see it end.",1442102400,,5127,4.423728813559322

The final scene is fine, especially for all of us who grew to love Allison and Joe throughout the series run. There's a different feeling to season 7 than the previous ones. I couldn't put my finger on it at first. Truncated of course. From what should have been 20+ episodes to just 13. Then it was obvious the series was abruptly canceled. The writing fell a little flat in the final season and the way that last episode was written, it's as if the writers were taking out their frustration on the Network and the characters they created so well. I felt cheated honestly. I know if the final season was given a proper 20-23 episode arc, it would have been very different and the last episode would have been stellar with the happy ending the characters and the fans deserved. However, for anyone who hasn't seen this amazing show, please do. Seasons 1-6 will leave you on the edge of your seat wanting more.

One of my favorite episodes is ""Blood on the Tracks"" with Allison's dreams giving her increasingly specific tips about a homeless man who is a killer.  The episode also has the outworking of Joe's mother's story and a fine performance by Kathy Baker as guest star in that role.  ""Talk to the Hand"" was almost humorous at times with Allison's hand taking control of its own actions, much to Allison's dismay and those around her.  ""Native Tongue"" was also amazingly unique where Allison loses the ability to understand English and can only communicate verbally in a Native American language.  The very final frames of the last episode were as sweet as they were bittersweet.  This is the one show where each season had incredible stories and performances.

And Allison herself -- not too bright. First, fails to realize even after 7 years that the
first dream never has enough info to act on, and second never learns that simply staying
asleep is the best way to get more.
I commend Patricia on how many ways she can wake up suddenly for the commercial cut.
But really, after all that experience, wouldn't she learn to just stay asleep?

4481762,4,B004V2S4SS,"Spoiler free review.

I have been a fan of Medium since the first season. I've always been intrigued by the supernatural, and the show had interesting cases, great acting and the kind of ""family dynamic"" that I have not seen in any other show (thanks mainly to Jake Weber and Patricia Arquette). And perhaps with the exception of the fourth season that may have suffered from the writer's strike, Medium has been an amazing ride.

So with season seven, you get more of the same - in a gratifying way - a collection of rather creative dreams and events that are thankfully not followed by an obvious solution. The first episode of the season has all of it, and sets the tone for what's to follow. There are, of course, some similarities to the previous seasons, like the usual arguments between Allison and Joe as well as kind of a temporary falling-out between some characters. As the creators knew that this was going to be the last season, they aim to wrap things up with the other family members, like Allison's brother and Joe's mom. It is kind of a nice touch.

What almost crashed the rating to three stars was the finale. Bluntly put, it breaks every convention and continuity set previously by the series, and is poorly written in general. I can see what they tried to do with it, but it just fails on so many levels. They clearly crammed too much material into one episode, and there was no build-up to the events whatsoever. And yes, I am intentionally not giving any hints. But it's bad.

Should you get the seventh season? For sure! It's worth the ride even if the last bit is disappointing.",1313366400,4,1603,4.536332179930795
4481763,5,B004V2S4SS,"I was always a huge fan of ""Medium"". For some reason, Patricia Arquette -regardless of the fact that she worked with great directors such as David Lynch- was underestimated in Hollywood. Maybe because she did not act, dress, and did whatever she needed to do the ""right"" way, in order to be a Hollywood star...to look astonishing on the red carpet. I liked ""Medium"" when it was produced by NBC because it was more suspenseful...CBS had a different approach. They kind of said...""We will 'save' this show, and even make people see what a nice family the Dubois family is"". Good approach (even though one of the seasons was not engaging at all). Well, 'good' CBS did not turn to be so good after all...in the middle of the last season they decided to kill all the characters. Why do they do that all the time? Really? Just because they decide to cancel a show it does not mean that they have to kill the protagonists...the good producers from CBS who cared about family values. At least the people from NBC left Allison on a comma, with a chance for recovery. Hopefully it is true that ""Medium"" is more appealing to Canadian and European audiences, and that a Canadian production company is thinking of producing the show. After all, Joe and Allison's death could have been the dream of a dream of a dream...just not true. It is not fair that, after following such an excellent show for years -and I rarely watch TV- not just me, but all the show followers,  have to be left with this bad taste in their mouths. Killing Allison and Joe in the end because CBS made no profit from the show is...what can I say...? Congrats, CBS, for showing us what family values are all about... (and thanks for the 'bitter end'...)... ;)",1311552000,4,1718,4.541935483870968

4481765,2,B004V2S4SS,"I'm not sure what happened here, I can't quite believe it and it saddens me to break it to those viewers who have loyally followed and derived enjoyment from this series as I have during its run, but the final seventh outing of this superb show ends on a deeply disappointing and deflating note.

To preface, I learned that season seven would be the final season after I finished viewing season six and was surprised to say the least, especially so since in my opinion there had been no decline in either the consistency or inventiveness displayed by the writers (notably Glenn Gordon Caron) throughout the previous six seasons. The idea that the network executives/producers of the show had decided to end the series on a high-note seemed premature, but perhaps laudable (considering how many television series out-stay their welcome to some degree). This is in spite of the fact that I personally hadn't observed any signs that this brilliant show was growing stale. But whether that decision was correct remains debatable, all I do know is that the final seventh season does little justice to the quality of the series as a whole.

Firstly, there will be disappointment for many with the thirteen-episode format (the fewest number since season four's sixteen). But as an avid viewer of `Medium' from the very beginning I clung to the hope that the potential for this (admittedly truncated) season given the wealth of material developed in the lives of the Dubois family in previous seasons would be fulfilled. There was so much possibility to pick up old story-threads and re-visit memorable characters from previous seasons, but the only storyline that's continued here in the final season is that of Joe's mother.

The majority of the seventh season is comprised of those episodes with the familiar formula that `Medium' has always executed so well, which is the contained, stand-alone murder investigations that often result in the capture/untimely death of the obligatory male offender with a unique motive and/or peculiar fetish. I suppose I can't complain that so many of these episodes in the final season take advantage of that formula which has proved so successful for the series in the past, I only wish that more episodes had centered on/explored the family lives of the members of the Dubois household.

...Mild Spoilers...

In the episode previously mentioned involving Joe's mother, entitled `Blood On The Tracks' (episode 10) there is an allusion by one of the characters that there are dark days ahead for Alison, as a result of which I expected a satisfying build-up to a gripping climax. Instead there is an episode involving Alison's brother, played by David Arquette- who please correct me if I'm wrong has never appeared in the series before- which consequently seemed to lack continuity, followed by a stand-alone murder investigation episode and ending with a time-travel episode that simply left me cold...

Episode 13- `Me Without You', the final episode of this series beloved by some many for its warmth and intrigue for six years is badly and unsatisfyingly constructed. It makes a mockery of all those storylines from previous seasons in which Alison travelled back and forth through time, learning new truths about herself and her loved ones as she made her journey. The best way for me to articulate my dissatisfaction with this episode is that I imagine the creator and writers began with the germ of an idea as to the note upon which they wanted this series to end, but the way in which they went about it tramples uncaringly on the lives of the main characters. The final scene is exactly how (knowing the characters of Alison and Joe as we all imagine we do) you would want this show to end, but it leaves a very bitter taste knowing how they and their loved ones arrived at that point.

Alison and Joe deserved a true happy ending. Perhaps it depends on your perspective whether they got one, but their daughters certainly didn't and therefore, for me, the ending just didn't ring true.",1309651200,38,4026,4.911764705882353

4481768,4,B004V2S4SS,"I love this show. My husband and daughters, and sometimes my son, and I watched it faithfully the whole seven years. The concept of a woman and her daughters all being psychics who can see ghosts and have dreams that tell the future--I really liked all of that. The mystery every week was fun to try and guess whodunnit. It was a game my husband and kids and I played to see who made the best guess.

But above all else we loved the family. My two favorite characters were the middle daughter, Bridget, and the husband, Joe. Oh, Joe! The perfect husband. A great dad. A loving, supportive husband who also stood up to his wife when she was behaving badly. He had it all.

SPOILER ALERT!!!

I will never forgive the writers and producers of this show for what they did to Joe. It was just a horrible, horrible thing to do to loyal fans. They had to know how much we loved Joe.

As you might know in Ep. 22 of season 6 Allison visions her own death and her funeral in action - this personally should have been the last scene for the show and would have made more logical sense , instead we get 13 more episodes which frankly were unneeded and tarnish a great show.

Given that i watched seasons 1&2 after season 4 i feel i have all the experience needed to write a general analysis on the show and it's seven season life.

What i will say is that Medium had very good luck. It was axed , re-commisioned by CBS and 35 more episodes were made as a result.

There is not a show currently on CBS/Fox/ABC/NBC that is similar and 7 seasons is about the best that any tv series can do before cast start getting itchy - and either leave or get a pay bump.

Perhaps in the future we'll hear more about the show and it's Final Season - i'm sure that the writers simply could not create a decent final run and went for a poor 11 episodes , CBS were annoyed and gave them 126 minutes to wrap things up instead of over another 9 episodes.",1307404800,6,1242,4.158333333333333

I hope to be able to have a copy of the whole series too.

4481771,5,B004V2S4SS,"WOW!! That's what I have to say about this amazing series! I had no clue it would run 7 seasons due to being slapped around by NBC for its first 5 years.  It premiered back in January 2005 as a mid-season replacement and its first 16 episodes were simply astonishing!  Patricia Arquette played Allison DuBois excellent.  It was almost if the dead were omnipotent!  Every where she looked she saw a dead person good or bad, lost or confused and tried to at first block them out by drinking!  After NBC canceled the show in May 2009 (although it was outperforming their other shows) CBS picked it up for its remaining two seasons.

Back to season 7 (the final season), was just simply amazing!! The writers, actors, directors and producers all worked hard as hell to produce one of the finest prime time shows of the 00's and 10's. Season 7 began right where Season 6 ended as Allison continued to recover from her brain tumor.  Her eldest daughter Ariel went off to college this season and we got to see more acting from the middle daughter Bridgett. The first episode ""Bring your daughter to work day"" was a take on the film ""Freaky Friday"", that being said, Bridgett and Mom switched places and it was nice to have a comical relief after all the sad ordeal that ended with season 6.

The series continued to get better with each episode.  We got to see more details about Detective Lee Scanlon's life and how he and his deceased brother were treated as children, and his precious daughter Lee by Lynn whom he married.  Another great episode was ""The Match Game"", in this episode we see Allison seeing hearts on people's foreheads and thinking they are matched and fate is working, but does it work for the greater good?!?

Personally, one of my favourite episodes is ""Talk To the Hand"" when Allison gets a skin graft and her hand goes wild.  The coffin scene is absolutely funny even though this is a crime show, a bit of humour now and again always helps.  ""Where were you when...?"" was an episode that left a chill in almost all who like Medium.  It brought back memories of catastrophic events and after Allison thinks a mega quake is coming she later learns a bomb is in a parking garage.

As the season progresses, we learn Joe's mother is dying and this little detail goes back to Season 4 episode ""Burn, Baby Burn"" in that when Allison told Joe's mother that she would be alright after she confided in Allison that she had to stop by the Mayo Clinic on the way back to Michigan.  I think that episode ""Blood on the Tracks"" was one of the saddest in the season.  Laura San Giacomo  made an appearance in ""The People in your Neighbourhood"".  Laura is remembered for ""Just Shoot Me"" a 90s sitcom.  This episode wrongfully accuses a convicted sex-offender of molesting her daughter. But, the question is who really hurt her daughter??

As the 2011 episodes approached after a long break viewers realized the show was coming to an end.  We got to see Allison's brother back, but this time it was her real life brother David Arquette, the great actor from Scream!  I think they should have cast him as her brother originally, but that's just my opinion.  Allison and Joe had some troubles too in the remaining episodes over Allison going back to get her law degree and Joe getting his masters.  I think we can all agree on the last episode unless you haven't seen it, which I won't say much, but it is very bittersweet!  I hope the DVD has an extended version of Episode 13 like they did with Season 1 episode 1.  I really think a Series Finale should be 2 hours not one! Remember that Kelsey Grammar just kidding, but seriously it should have been two hours to get everything in.

The good thing about Season 7 and the whole series was watching the whole family change.  They were a true life family, faced hardships like everyday people do.  They lived in a modest house, struggled with jobs and had plenty of ups and downs along the way.  The daughters grew which was wild seeing Ariel go to college when you sit down and watch Season 1 as compared to season 7.  She really grew up! Bridgett became more funny. I think Maria Lark has a comedic career ahead because of her whit and she just cracks me up.  The littlest girl Marie grew up to become a good actress too.  She didn't really have many roles, but in Season 6 we got to see her act in the episode ""Sal"" where she fell in love with the Alarm system the DuBois family installed.

Overall, I give the whole series 5/5 because for everyday people it dealt with everyday issues from the economy, the wars, crime, struggling to find jobs, money, and dealing with teenage children and young children.  Jake Weber and Patricia Arquette had a great chemistry together and I would recommend that you order this today or go out and buy it June 21, 2011! Season 7 comes full circle and I for one am glad the show got a proper finale instead of just canceling it!  It brought closure to the show and didn't leave us wanting more like some series that just end!  I believe if CBS hadn't moved it to 8 pm on Friday nights and left Ghost Whisperer run for a 6th Season, then Medium would have got its full 22 episodes.  Now that the Supernatural shows are practically gone, my question is what kind of shows will be next? As reality shows are starting to wane, it makes me wonder what the 2010's will have for us in the coming years! So get ready and get Medium the 7th and Final Season this year!! Au Revoir Medium!!  Maybe Ariel's character will do a spin-off? We will see!

P.S. I forgot to mention Season 7 will be in Blu-Ray too!! I hope they release the other 6 on Blu-Ray as Well!! And for Patricia and Jake, I wish you two long and happy careers!! You both did amazing jobs making this series! Thank You both!",1302566400,34,5765,4.43168880455408

8442833,4,B004V2S4SS,"I love this show, but its flawed. The number of dangerous criminals who get conveniently killed to save the main characters from difficult decisionsthis strikes me as bad writing. Having watched all 7 seasons, Ill take a couple paragraphs to explain how this show never quite makes it to excellent, but remains.. well, medium. But first, spoiler warning:

The remainder of this review contains mild spoilers.

Im not a person who sits here looking for goofs but this show is pretty sloppy about technical facts, math, and medicine. Off the top of my head, I don't think theres enough municipal $ to pull out a forensics team on every investigation. Sadly, Phoenix probably doesnt even process half of its rape kits. And Im not sure some of these cases would go to the DA? Also, how many of the cases that are processed by the DAs office are overseen by the DA him/herself (rather than ADAs, who have only been mentioned at the very end of the series). But one of the writers figured out that involving the city police more often kind of fixes some implausibility, so most of the issues are minor in later seasons. Examples: I recently watched an episode where someone wanted govt funding and said it would come to 2 cents per person, then the resolution of the show was for govt to grant 60 mil in funding. US pop is not 3 billion, lol. Or the show where they talked about the drug wet, saying it was a powerful hallucinogen but the ingredients are, according to Medium: cigarette, formaldehyde, and alcohols. Pretty sure the hallucinogenic properties come from, idk, a hallucinogen? Again, I don't sit here looking for errors; Im just trying to enjoy the show. But sometimes its like what did they just say???

My main issue with the show is how nice everyone is. Devalos, especially, is completely lovable and completely unrealistic as a character.  I don't think such a good person has ever made it to public office. (OTOH, Keener was great! Though shes probably a good soul, shes in it for $$ and revenge, which doesnt annoy me so much. Devalos could be the second coming lbh.) Worse yet, everyone is so nice that the show writers are forced to make cringey dei-ex-machina choices; for instance, the ghost of a dead girl uses Bridgette to send an e-mail which gets a potential criminal killed before the main cast is forced to make a decision wherein there is no good choice, but the right choice (which theyd be compelled to make) is patently illogical. Another episode which disappointed me was the one where the Kevorkian-esque doctor, who seems ideologically high-minded and possibly very advanced, suddenly turns out to be this majorly sleazy criminal. How convenient. It would have been interesting if the show which is all about morality actually tackled a moral issue instead of circumnavigating.  The niceness of the show knocks off a full star from my rating, but it also adds half a star, because I guess wholesome TV is harmless? and the staunch idealism of this show is, well, nice. In a way. Still, I almost resent Allisons ability to deal with real-world horror and always rise above? I guess she is blessed, with her family, as the show successfully establishes.  My feeling of frustration with Allisons niceness evaporated after the AU episode where her entire family gets killed: she goes so hard and calculating, its magnificent, and I finally realized that she isn't this sweet, nice person: in a way thats a public face she always wears For Her Kids. That gave me a little shiver, and thenceforth I have been 100% team Allison-is-cool.

Some of the seasons were significantly better than others. I cant distinguish the first three v well because I watched them slowly over months, whereas I chain-watched seasons 4-7 during holidays. Seasons 1 and 2 are okay, though very predictable. Season 3 is probably the worst, and I stopped watching the show for a few months because those episodes were written in somebodys sleep. Season 4, I think, is when the Dubois family starts having some real issues, and it picks up a little. Joes character becomes a lot more plausible after hes held hostage. Then theres Keener, and the plots in the final seasons start to finally acquire some real nuance. Still, these gem episodes are tempered with the same kind of paint-by-numbers episodes that seem like they are supposed to surprise the viewer, but fail. And the only nuance we see in the season arcs has to do with the relative merits of Allison and Joes various employers. Seasons 5 and 6 are the best; Im not a fan of S7 but unlike most reviewers I didn't mind the final episode.

As Ive already mentioned, I don't think the writing of this show rises above mediocrity for more than a few episodes. I don't know much about acting, but Arquettes acting can sometimes fall a little short of convincing me, lol. (Though I am quite fond of watching her try.) Huston is a different storyincredible talent, and Vassilieva and Cubitt (the actors who played Scanlon and Ariel) I also found tremendously convincing as the series went on. I was pleasantly surprised at how much the show improved between seasons 3 and 5. Scanlon and DiNovis relationship, for me, was a real high point. Overall I found Medium frustrating, but it was endearing enough for me to watch 7 seasons: 3.5 stars, which rounds up :)",1515024000,,5314,4.7435064935064934
8442834,4,B004V2S4SS,"Like many others, I loved the series even though I grew to dislike the main character Allison as the seasons progressed. She is too emotional, too emotionally dependent on her spouse, Joe. Maybe being ""sensitive"" is simply a part of who she is and maybe I personalized the story too much but I think I would have found it draining to be married to someone like Allison. She may have had foresight, but for some reason, it bothered me that she lacked prudence and wisdom. Maybe that makes her a flawed human being like the rest of us but to me, it was so frustrating that she did not seem to learn from past mistakes and was so quick to jump to conclusions as soon as she had a dream. Moreover, I think Allison's ""me-me-me"" attitude contributed to the rough patch Joe and Allison's marriage seems to have hit by season 7. I would have liked to see them work through it (as the love seems to be there between them) instead of the god-awful ending that we were given by the writers. I also disliked it that David Arquette appeared out of nowhere to play her brother (albeit only for one episode); I think the actor who played the original Michael was much better suited. In any event, even though I just finished watching all 7 season, I would gladly watch it all over again.",1514851200,,1272,4.3940677966101696
