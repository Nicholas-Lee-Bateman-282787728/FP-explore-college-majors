8607002,5,B00ENLT6YS,"Received this DVD-R as a gift from a friend who knew I had been hunting for a better copy of the public-domain Bobby Breen feature. Indeed, after watching it, and despite the fact it is sourced from a 16mm print that is in none-too-fresh condition, it IS better print.  It also contains the ENTIRE feature unlike other public domain copies I have purchased that are missing pieces here and there.

With Bobby's passing this past September, it's a shame that better quality prints haven't shown up on the market place before now.  Surely the Warner Archives have better prints of his RKO features -- or someone does at any rate. Maybe the Sol Lesser estate.  Bobby deserves to be seen and heard again!

But until that time comes, this DVD serves to present Bobby Breen in a clearer, more audibly palatable version than available before.",1484265600,,835,4.731034482758621
8607003,5,B00ENLT6YS,"This is such a great film, to bad only used 16mm prints are available for transfer. However, Grapevine's version is without a doubt the best out there. Yes, it's a used 16mm TV print, but they do not ""touch up"" the image. They make a direct 16mm transfer to DVD. the print looks good, and the image is clear. Outside of a slight ""hiss"" in parts of the soundtrack, and a splice here and there it's overall a good clean transfer.",1389225600,3,427,4.283950617283951
