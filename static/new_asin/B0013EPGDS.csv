3105307,5,B0013EPGDS,"This is the second video we have watched by Lisa and Linda...and it is great! My 2 1/2 year old and 9 month old love them....This video is a safari adventure that the whole family will enjoy. The songs, again are very catchy, and there are memorable characters. We love the iguana song! Thanks again for a great video...and keep them coming.",1204588800,2,341,4.516129032258065
3105308,5,B0013EPGDS,"What a great DVD and CD!  My children have had so much fun watching the DVD--they especially love seeing real animals (the elephant and the puppy were my daughter's personal favs.)  The songs are so well written that we all have fun singing and laughing along. Some of our favorite songs are Lion In The Sun, Orangutana Boogie, If Ya Wanna Be an Iguana and my favorite-Let Your Music Shine.  This is a terrific DVD, you won't be disappointed!",1203897600,,442,4.569620253164557
3105309,5,B0013EPGDS,"My three-year-old daughter loves ""Splish Splash,"" but ""Singin' Safari"" is her new favorite! She got right into being an iguana and boogied to ""Orangutan Boogie,"" which is a very catchy song I find myself humming while I'm driving. I love how ""Singin' Safari"" introduces really young audiences to cool musical instruments-- how they look and sound-- and the songs are so listenable that I actually enjoy hearing them over and over again. There just isn't another series quite like this and I think this one is the best yet.",1203811200,2,522,4.876404494382022

8250481,5,B0013EPGDS,"I have a five year old who reaches for this DVD over Disney! I thought nothing would tear her away from Beauty and the Beast, but this is fast becoming her favorite. She loves to watch Singin' Safari in the car and sing along on the way to school. At home she listens and sings along with the CD...I admit I do too. Her seven year old friend asked me if she could have it!
In the age of annoying cartoons and other DVD's, this is refreshing for the moms and dads!",1216771200,,463,4.043478260869565
8250482,5,B0013EPGDS,"My 5 year-old loves it! She sings, dances and enjoys the animals. Then she insists that her mom and I join in! The creators of this have done such a wonderful job of relating to children. But even more, my daughter is so thrilled when watching this DVD, that she wants others to join her. THANK YOU. Lisa and Linda!!!",1208563200,,317,4.3
8250483,5,B0013EPGDS,"my 2 1/2 & 4 1/2 yr old LOVE this DVD, they have the whole thing memorized.  We were driving in the car the other day listening to the bonus CD & guess who else has it memorized? (Yep, that's right, Daddy!)  They love each & every song!  I also highly recommend Linda & Lisa's previous DVD, 'Let's Have a Playdate w/ Brahms,' another favorite in our household.",1207699200,,360,4.264705882352941
8250484,5,B0013EPGDS,"When my 8 yrs old grand daughter puts it on in my house the atmosphere fills with upbeat energy and as she starts to sing, jump and move along who can resist joining her.  My soul sings with joy watching and listening to this incredibly creative, talented and professionally made program and one day I might just put it on without her here just to get the kid inside of me to play.  It is going to UK, Sweden and Canada to other grand children and their children.  Thanks Linda and Lisa for the visual and musical joy you are sharing with the world and what a wonderful gift to give those who have a room filled with stuffed animals and who don't read yet.",1207526400,,656,4.232
8250485,5,B0013EPGDS,"My 10 month old son loves Singin' Safari, and so do I.  This is the first DVD he has watched that isn't exclusively classical music and I wasn't sure if it would hold his attention...but it does. The lyrics and melodies are lovely - you can't help but sing-a-long, long after the video is over (in a non-annoying way).  'If Ya Wanna be an Iguana....' will become an all time classic, and it always makes both of us smile.  But so does 'Orangutana Boogie'. As does 'Lion in the Sun'.  My little guy roars with the lion! As a new parent, I have no hesitation recommending this to any parent on either side of the pond, and look forward to new releases in future.",1207094400,,660,4.298387096774194
8250486,5,B0013EPGDS,"Singin Safari is an absolute hit in my household!!  We wake up every morning with an instant request from my 4 year old daugher and soon there after I look at my 2 month old son and he is bopin and movin doing the ""Orangutan Boogie"". We can't wait for the next DVD in the series!!",1207008000,,280,4.0
8250487,5,B0013EPGDS,"I initially purchased this for my (just turned 4) pre-schooler who loves Lisa and Linda and loves singing and dancing along with Singin' Safari. I noticed that my one year old is riveted when it's on. It's hard to find something to please different age groups, but this is a hit in my household and it's not annoying for parents. It's a must have for your kid's dvd library.",1206576000,,374,4.434782608695652
8250488,5,B0013EPGDS,"Unlike other DVD's, this does not need to be watched more than once to be an instant favorite. My boys (3 and 4 1/2) watched it 3 times the first time I put it on!  And were so excited to recognize Lisa and Linda from their first DVD ""Lets have a Playdate"".  The DVD comes with a CD of all the songs which is such an added bonus. My son even asked me to put them on his IPOD!!!!",1206057600,,378,3.7721518987341773
8250489,5,B0013EPGDS,"This is the 2nd Lisa & Linda DVD we have watched, and both my children thoroughly enjoy it.  It's the only video that both my 4 year old daughter and 2 year old son will watch at the same time.  They love the music, the animals, the instuments and especially love Lisa and Linda!!!  We're looking forward to the next one!!",1205280000,,322,4.245901639344262
8250490,5,B0013EPGDS,"Another amazing DVD from Lisa and Linda!
Our 1 1/2 year old stands up and dances to all the songs, especially ""Orangatana Boogie"" and ""Singin' Safari"".  Our 4 1/2 year old loves the music too, but is also fascinated by all of the unusual instruments that are used.  The ""Guess the Instruments"" segment in the special features is a favorite.
We can't wait for the next one!",1204934400,2,372,4.537313432835821
