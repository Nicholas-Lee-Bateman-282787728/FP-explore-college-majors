8590121,5,B00D6VOV9G,Very entertaining light comedy; I am surprised it is not better known.,1518134400,,70,4.916666666666667
8590122,5,B00D6VOV9G,"If you like June Allyson, like we do, and Dick Powell, then you're in for treat with this traditional and fun romantic comedy.

Dick Powell plays a deceptive politician declaring himself a reformer running for mayor; June Allyson(his real life wife) plays a fiery redhead daughter of a zoo keeper and animal lover.  Both have an issue with the local political boss.  She believes his hype about being a reformer looking to stand up for the underdog and righteous causes.  A quirky but funny romance develops between the two, and he starts to believe his own hype- up to a point.

Heads are sure to roll and fireworks galore with some terrific animal shots with her pet Lion, Herman.  Our kids loved this movie, and they usually can't stand contemporary Hallmark romantic comedies which many we like.  Great chemistry between the stars and super co-stars like droll David Wayne.  After this one watch Good News with June Allyson and Peter Lawford in a collegiate musical comedy.",1515974400,,977,4.843373493975903

8590124,5,B00D6VOV9G,"Surprisingly ahead of its time with corrupt politicians caring only to be re-elected, big boss party criminals, and a family that hunts big game in Africa.  Ironic that I just watched this movie again in the same week that Trump's boys are in The News about big game hunting in Africa.  Of course, not knowing or remembering the plot, I just wanted to see June Allyson again.  Killing lions and elephants, yuck.  Well, back then, the idea of placing stuffed heads on the walls of...the San Diego Zoo Main Office.... OMG.  Animal lovers will be shocked but eventually pleased with the Message.  And my shrink wants to find out why I appreciate June Allyson's gravelly voice.  If only Dick Powell had got to sing?",1439683200,2,711,4.685483870967742

8590128,5,B00D6VOV9G,"June Allyson is a peach!  Dick Powell is great!  Together, they make a wonderful comedic team.  The redhead, (June) is a fiery seeker of justice and right.  Dick Powell is a typical politician, willing to take money and support from whoever will offer it...until he meets his conscience; the red head.  She shows him what it means to have the support of the ""little guy"" and that integrity matters.  Everyone who runs for public office should watch this movie and learn some important lessons.",1401667200,3,493,4.809523809523809
8590129,5,B00D6VOV9G,"Totally agree with the first reviewer. Heartwarming story and lovable characters (including the furbearing ones). Wholesome, lots of fun, and a good message.",1386720000,,157,5.869565217391305
8590130,5,B00D6VOV9G,"This delightful gem of a picture provided more than a few good chuckles over politicians and their shenanigans plus gives some great action with real lions and monkeys and llamas.

June Allyson plays a feisty and fisticuffs woman of 22 living with her father on a ranch. He is the zoo superintendent so lions roam freely as pets as do avaricious little monkeys. After a real knockdown fight in public she is arrested and needs a lawyer.  She decides a local candidate for mayor, Andrew Hale, looks like an honest man on his poster so goes to him to be her lawyer. So begins romance and mayhem as ms. McGuire gets involved in the campaign.

The characters are all good old fashioned types and nicely dressed in suits and dresses.  Dick Powell plays the lawyer candidate but the funny lines are all delivered by his cohort and campaign manager while the wannabe lawyer, playing the underpaid and dour secretary, makes remarks of pique and weariness.  These two latter consider him a fool to fall for the hotheaded redhead and to risk the mAyor's seat by playing the honest candidate.

All works out in the end but the great interaction with a real free roam lion makes you laugh.

Light and well done.  Someone wrote a good script and got good actors for it.  Enjoy.",1383955200,2,1264,4.607142857142857
