8600701,5,B00E3PQ566,"I first encountered Andy Samberg when I watched a preview for Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping. While it was funny, this older work of Samberg is even better. Some people have compared Hot Rod to Napoleon Dynamite, which is not unfair. But I enjoyed Hot Rod more. If you like this movie, and Samberg's acting style, be sure to check out Brooklyn 99.",1497484800,,351,4.587301587301587
