8543103,3,B009NLR17M,"This 1962  b&w version of ""Pandora's Box"" did not reach my hometown when first released, though ""Rosemary"", Nadja Tiller 's international hit from 1958 had. Distributors were a funny lot.

The film is also known as ""No Orchids For Lulu."" It is a lot shorter than the Pabst silent version and not as rivetting. As a matter of fact, it is quite talky with scenes that go on for far too long. Nevertheless, it must have been quite daring in its era. The print by Video Dimensions is sharp and presented in a 1:75:1 aspect ratio though it is not anamorphic (a sin in today's market of hi-def widescreen) You can, however,  Zoom In the picture, and you will not lose the subtitles since they are placed within the image.. The 96 minute DVD is in German with English subtitles that give you a wonderful option of switching them on in white or in yellow.

If you've never seen or have given up in ever seing ""Rosemary"" released on DVD for Region 1, you might want to acquaint yourself with the gorgeous creature that was Nadja Tiller. There's also in the cast O. E. Hasse (the killer from Hitchcock's ""I Confess""), Mario Adorf and the haunting Hildegarde Knef. And watching these screen legends from the German cinema is the best reason to get this one, dreary as it is. If you've never seen the Pabst film, this version might do, but beware that there are gaps in the story. For instance, they leave out the whole courtroom sequence which dissipates the story's impact and continuity.

Only a 3 star (""it's okay"") rating mainly because of the DVD's non-anamorphic presentation. Inexcusable.",1393891200,,1584,4.642857142857143
