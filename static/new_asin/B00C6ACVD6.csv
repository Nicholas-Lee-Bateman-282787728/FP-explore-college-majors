5691240,3,B00C6ACVD6,"As of this writing, the complete 7th series is going for 80. This includes Both part 1 and 2 of series 7 plus the 2011 and 2012 Christmas specials.

If you were to buy them separately, the costs break down as follows
Christmas 2011  15.84
Season Seven Part 1  17.99
Christmas 2012  13.86
Season Seven Part 2  24.99

Total:  72.68

It seems a little silly to make the box set, containing all of these items, cost more than buying them individually.",1369008000,51,447,4.432098765432099
5691241,3,B00C6ACVD6,"If you buy just the series in the two parts, it totals only $40 for them both. So why is it that the full set is nearly TWICE that? As much as I love this show, and the ability to get it here, I will have to look elsewhere for the full set, as $72 is too damn steep for something that can be had for 32 dollars less. Lower the price to about $45 to $50 and I would be more than happy to get it.",1368316800,83,394,3.5402298850574714
5691242,5,B00C6ACVD6,"Doctor Who series 7 starts off with the Ponds final adventures with the Doctor. Amy Pond is my favorite companion since the new series began in 2005 with Rose Tyler being my 2nd favorite. This series completes Amy and Rory's adventures with the Doctor and completed their story lines from the little Amelia Pond who waited to being Amy Pond to finally becoming Amelia Williams.

With their last 5 adventures, as well as the 2011 Christmas special:
The Doctor, The Widow and the Wardrobe
Asylum of the Daleks
Dinosaurs on a Spaceship
A Town Called Mercy
The Power of Three
The Angels Take Manhattan

Angles Take Manhattan to me was my favorite and where it was showed that while her and the Doctor are best friends, Rory is what mattered most to her and where she showed that she was incapable of being without Rory. As she put it ""that's what marriage is about."" While it was the end of the Ponds on the Tardis, it wasn't the end of Amy and Rory.

We move forward to the impossible girl Clara Oswald. Who questions the Doctor and doesn't get along with the Tardis. This is now the third incarnation the Doctor meets and the one he will be traveling with on the Tardis. We also get a new opening title sequence and a brand new Tardis to fall in love with and find out hopefully this series what the Great Intelligece has in store for the Doctor.

Their 9 adventures include:
The Snowmen (with a past version of Clara)
The Bells of St. John
The Rings of Akhaten
Cold War
Hide
Journey to the Centre of the Tardis (my favorite thus of the ones that have aired so far)
Crimson Horror (this one aires next week and is the 100th episode to aire since the new series of Doctor Who began in 2005)
Nightmare in Silver
AND...
The Name of the Doctor (which I hope will not be revealed. I am thinking it might mean why he choose the name Doctor, rather than telling us his actual name)

Theories for Clara:
1 I think their are a few possiblities that come to my mind for Clara. The first being that the Great Intelligence created Clara or
2 The Doctor created Clara sometime in his future and doesn't realize it because he hasn't done it yet and she's there to help the Doctor stop something the Great Intelligence is trying to do
3 That she is the Tenth Doctor's (the cloned Doctor with one heart) and Rose Tyler's daughter.
4 Or maybe she was originally created by the Great Intelligence but the Doctor altered her in the future to stop what they were doing to her but hasn't realized he's done that
5 That none of my theories are correct and Steven Moffat as always has some crazy idea we can't figure out until it has happened as always by which time we will look at the clues and wonder how Moffet fooled us again!

15 great adventures all incapped in one off episodes.

Then it will be on to the 50th anniversary with Matt Smith as The Eleventh Doctor, Jenna-Louise Coleman as Clara, David Tennant as The Tenth Doctor and Billie Piper as Rose Tyler! on November 23rd 2013.

Fun Facts:

Clara is born on November 23rd the same day the very first episode of Doctor Who the classic series aired.
Clara is 26 years old the exact number of years Doctor Who the classic series was on for.
Matt Smith is the youngest actor to ever have played the role of the Doctor.
Have you noticed all of the references throughout series 7 to Rose?
1 The future Clara from AOTD has a red rose in her hair
2 Past Clara worked at the Rose and Thorn and on her gravestone their are roses engraved on it.
3 In the new opening titles of Doctor Who their is a wolf image a few seconds into the theme on the right side
In the episode Journey to the Centre of the Tardis:
1 Did you see the crib that The Doctor used for himself, as well as for Amy's baby Melody Pond
2 He had the miniature Tardis that was Amy's there as well in the same room
3 Did you hear the voices when one of the Van Baalan Bros was in the Tardis console room? You should of heard Amy's voice saying ""We're in space!"" From The Beast Below episode and you would of also heard the Ninth Doctor's voice as well as well as some classic Doctor Who voices!
4 Did you see the swimming pool (although it is no longer located in the library)
5 The telescope from Tooth and Claw
6 The Library and in the library The Great Time War book, where Clara finds the Doctor's real name!",1367107200,17,4304,4.277641277641278
5691243,5,B00C6ACVD6,luv the series......this is a buy for all fans of the series. hope Doctor Who lives on forever...can't wait for next series..,1367107200,,125,4.7272727272727275
5691244,4,B00C6ACVD6,"But these blu rays are getting a bit on the expensive side. I don't remember series 5 or 6 being this costly.
Ill be biting the bullet anyway though :)
Only giving it a 4 because I haven't seen all episodes yet.",1366588800,8,211,4.0476190476190474
5691245,5,B00C6ACVD6,"I don't know why people are not liking the 2 half of Series 7 I think it's Awesome!!
Now I miss Amy Pond lots but I'm liking Clara.
Now it's not as good as the Series 5 & 6 but I'll be buying it & counting the days till I get it!!!",1366070400,2,231,3.4615384615384617
5691246,5,B00C6ACVD6,"This Blu-ray set will be available September the 24th, and this set features all 13 episodes of Series 7 as well as two Christmas Specials:

*2011 Christmas Special: The Doctor, The Widow and The Wardrobe

*Asylum of the Daleks
*Dinosaurs On A Spaceship
*A Town Called Mercy
*The Power of Three
*The Angels Take Manhattan

*2012 Christmas Special: The Snowmen

*The Bells of Saint John
*The Rings of Akhaten
*Cold War
*Hide
*Journey To The Center of The TARDIS
*The Crimson Horror
*Nightmare in Silver (The Last Cyberman)
*The Name of The Doctor

This set also has the following special features:

*Audio Commentaries
*Behind the scenes featurettes
*Episode Prequels
*Doctor Who on the Nerdist
*Doctor Who in the U.S.
*Last Days of the Ponds
*Pond Life
*The science of Doctor Who
*The Companions
*Doctor Who at Comic Con

*NOTE* This set is more slim than the previously released series 5 and 6. Aside from being slimmer, the slip case fits very tightly around the trifold that houses the discs. I have to leave my set protruding slightly from the slip case or it would take few minutes before I could shake it free. Not a big issue, but not the same exact design used in the series 5 and 6 releases. The special features are set up the same way as the last two series, a few bits of supplemental material per disc. There is an insert pamphlet with Doctor Who merchandise. The first trifold houses the episode listing and supplemental material breakdown just as the complete sets for series 5 and 6 have. So this set aesthetically looks in line with the series 5 and 6 sets, just fits tighter due to being slimmer. Overall I am happy with this set and its design.

I know some people have complained about the beginning of this series, my only complaint was with ""The Angels Take Manhattan"" episode, and in large part because it reminded me of Ghostbusters 2 (The worst sequel in the history of film sequels) because of the Statue Of Liberty Angel. A small complaint and not really a valid complaint at that, I actually liked this episode quite a bit. I think this is the best series to date (I realize a lot of fans will disagree and I perfectly understand). I think Clara ""Oswin"" Oswald is a much better companion to the Doctor than Amy Pond was. That being said, I am extremely happy with the direction of the character arc for Amy and Rory. A couple as the Companion to the Doctor and their struggle to maintain a life of normalcy when apart from the Doctor I thought was a really cool concept, and very well executed. Steven Moffat is a brilliant writer, and I loved spending the first part of this series wrapping up Amy and Rory's story and the second part of this series with my new favorite Companion, Clara. I personally liked the second half of series 7 even more so than the first half. My favorite episodes were ""Asylum of the Daleks"" and ""Cold War"". I also liked the Christmas special ""The Snowmen"" mainly because I watched it Christmas day and I think it's the best one they've done so far, plus I like Strax a lot. This is the last series with Matt Smith as the Doctor (aside from the upcoming 50th anniversary special and the 2013 Christmas special) and I will miss him.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1364947200,233,3208,4.555555555555555

I have no issue with Matt Smith, he's a great Doctor and I would even go so far as to say he's my second favorite Doctor after David Tennant, But Steven Moffat as the show runner for Series 5+ is no Russell T. Davies.  There was an epic space opera vibe present in the Davies series which is not present in Moffat's Doctor which opts more for weirdness and mystery.  Some people (i.e. Sherlock fans) may like that but I'm not a fan.  On the plus side, Clara so is a much more interesting companion than Amy and Rory who's story here unfortunately ends with a thud.",1466294400,,681,4.296875

5691285,5,B00C6ACVD6,"I was so heartbroken to see Amelia Pond leave the Doctor's side midway thru this Series.  However, Clara Oswald was a good replacement.  Her story arc of saving The Doctor by the Series Finale was excellent, BUT, in my opinion, too short-lived.  Instead, this Story Arc should have been stretched into the end of the next series.  This would have made Clara's Story Arc of Saving The Doctor more EPIC.  Right now, this Story Arc does not feel epic.

I got hooked the first time I saw Doctor Who on TV (the one where Christopher Eccleston plays as The Doctor). So much so, that I have bought almost every single Doctor Who seasons/series on dvd (i.e. the ones where Christopher Eccleston, David Tennant and Matt Smith play as The Doctor). I still cannot accept or watch Peter Capaldi as The Doctor, because (1) his heavy Scottish accent is hard to understand, and (2) he played Caecilius in the ""Fires of Pompeii"" episode of Doctor Who (I just keep seeing Caecilius whenever I see Capaldi play as The Doctor).

The writing/scripts are excellent. Everything starts with the writing/story, then everything else builds from there. The acting is great, the music is great, the visual effects are great, etc.

In this Series and the previous, Steven Moffat (Head Writer & one of the Exec Producers) has placed too much emphasis on the mystery of the Doctor's name.  Too much so.  So, given that River Song's Number 1 Rule is ""The Doctor Lies"", and other evidence (such as his devious & manipulative manner) from the this and previous series, my conclusion is that the Doctor's name is Beelzebub Jr., or Beelzebub III / IV / etc.  In other words, The Doctor's father, grandfather or great-grandfather was Beelzebub (The Lord of Lies).  Given the evil reputation of Beelzebub, The Doctor is, thus, trying to runaway from his Legacy.

I have watched the Christopher Eccleston, David Tennant and Matt Smith Doctor Who series FIVE times, and will probably rewatch them again! That is how good everything is in these series.

Funny thing is, after watching them five times, I am finally seeing scientific improbabilities/mistakes and some plot holes. This series must be great, since I did not notice these mistakes during my first three viewings.",1458604800,,2235,4.847368421052631

What I will do is list all of the episodes in this set because when I was looking to purchase ALL of the episodes including the specials, I had trouble finding out exactly what was in each set. Not knowing that, I had to order them and compare the episodes against the actual master list from the BBC. Season seven is NOT complete, there two AWESOME specials not to be missed (see end of this review). The following are included in ""The Complete Seventh Series"".

 ""The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe""
1 ""Asylum of the Daleks""
2 ""Dinosaurs on a Spaceship""
3 ""A Town Called Mercy""
4 ""The Power of Three""
5 ""The Angels Take Manhattan""

This is a 5 disc set with David Tennant (the 10th Doctor on the cover). They aired before Season 5.

5691322,4,B00C6ACVD6,"This season is Matt Smith's last season playing the Doctor. This is also the season where we see Amy and Rory leave (touched by an angel), and where we are introduced to Clara . In this story arc, we see how the Impossible Girl plays a part in the life of the Doctor. In the first four episodes, we see Amy and Rory reunited with the doctor on a trip across all of space and time (again), and then we see them parted from each other by the touch of an angel, never to see each other again.

So we are introduced to Clara (you can find my review for her second episode under ""The Snowmen"") and she is killed again. Then we find the original Clara in present day London with ""The Great Intelligence"". After that the Doctor and Clara go on an adventure across space and time, eventually leading them to Trenzalore, where resides the Doctor's grave, and Clara shows the Doctor why she is the impossible girl. While she is in the Doctor's time stream, she encounters all of the doctor's incarnations, except for one - the War Doctor. Thus it sets the stage for The Day of the Doctor...

In five compact discs, this is the explosive final season of Doctor Who with Matt Smith as the eleventh doctor.

The only reason this is getting 4 stars (3.5 actually) is because of Clara and the Vastra/Jenny relationship , which is a pity because I really like those characters.",1420934400,,1361,4.392857142857143

I almost didn't watch season 8 because Clara was going to be in it.  Still, it's the Doctor, and Matt Smith is absolutely brilliant in the role, and it's worth watching because of all those wonderful Matt Smith moments.

But, Matt turned out to be a darn good doctor.  More importantly this season is his best.  I won't go episode by episode, but I will tell you that there is one stand out episode where Matt rides a dinosaur and we not only meet Rory's father, he rides in the Tardis.

5691369,3,B00C6ACVD6,"DVD review:

ONE STAR deducted for the TERRIBLE COMPRESSION on DVD. This is by far one of the *worst* examples of DVD picture quality I have seen. It looks like a small YouTube video that has been enlarged and slapped on a disc. Very bad pixelation often bordering on ""block-ation"". Even the sound at times seemed overly compressed. I have read other posts about the series 7 DVD data rates compared to other TV series on DVD and it appears the BBC just phoned this one in.

Series 7 review:

(Warning. Some mild spoilers.) I love the post-2000s Doctor Who, and really enjoy Matt Smith, et al. But series 7 leaves a bit to be desired. Some episodes were up to the usual fun and thought-provoking stories we have come to expect. Unfortunately, some of series 7 really seemed... well, off. The first episode was a strong concept and story, introducing the talented Jenna-Louise Coleman. The final Pond family saga has a few bumps but manages to finish with a powerful goodbye. In the second half of series 7, the Tardis is yet again revamped and we bring in a new companion, bringing Coleman back as a regular cast member. Sadly, we felt her character was ""undecided"" by the producers and writers, leaving the actress in an unfortunate position. Even the exuberant, frenetic Matt Smith was a bit off in the latter part of this series. It was like the primary on screen characters were somewhat lost and devoid of much chemistry. However, BIG highlight of the series were the occasional re-appearances of Madame Vastra, Jenny and Strax (previously seen in series 6, ""A Good Man Goes to War""). This trio stole the show as far as we were concerned, injecting a welcome dose of levity and joy each time they were present. Their chemistry and energy could easily carry a string of mini-episodes or even a spin-off series.

ONE STAR deducted, unfortunately, due to the overall series story quality. This may have been partly due to the long delays and shuffling cast, but taken as a whole, this is one of the weaker series. We expect a little better from Moffat and co. Is not change also opportunity? Here's hoping series 8 with Peter Capaldi assuming the title role will revitalize the show. Perhaps Jenna-Louise Coleman will be given more to do and allowed to spark as she was in her first appearance of series 7.",1408233600,,2308,4.663390663390663
5691370,5,B00C6ACVD6,"What's to say - Matt Smith, Karen Gillan and Arthur Darvill all are great as well as newcomer Jenna Coleman.

Despite some poor work by (over-rated) Steven Moffat the rest of the gang manages to make up for it and produces an enjoyable 7th season.

5691371,5,B00C6ACVD6,"Love, Love, Love this series!! Doctor Who just keeps getting better. Matt Smith has grown so much into the Doctor's role that it's hard to imagine Doctor Who without him! The bond between him and 'The Ponds' is stronger than ever which makes the heart-ache that much more excruciating when they are forced to leave. Jenna Louise-Coleman takes on the new hat of new companion in their place and, though she cannot fill the shoes of The Ponds, your heart just makes more room for her. She's sassy, flirty and just plain fun with a big mystery surrounding her that is intriguing to watch the Doctor try and puzzle out. In my opinion, Steven Moffat's writing is sharper and more edgy. Matt Smith is never better and I really like the chemistry between him and Clara. Seriously one of my favorite seasons of Doctor Who and I cannot recommend it enough!!

5691402,3,B00C6ACVD6,When I opened it look kind of used and it has scratches. The DVD's also had scratches and smudges. When I was watching an episode it totally skip to another part by itself. The DVD's looked like they were in bad quality. As in video watching they were great but sometimes it would just skip parts. Other than that its alright.,1399939200,2,326,4.360655737704918

I love the writing, the acting, and Matt Smith is incredible to watch!  He really is a talented actor, and Jenna (I believe that's the actress's name who plays Clara) is very good as well, as so is the actors who play the Ponds, and the supporting cast.  overall, its a great show, but season 7 is incredible.  it was a spot on season and was perfect all around.",1399248000,,494,4.223404255319149

5691408,5,B00C6ACVD6,"Series 7 has some of the highest production values yet. Everything looks wonderful. Stories can seem rushed and underdeveloped, but I think it hearkens back to the old days when the arcs were not so prominent and the Doctor and company just went out for an adventure.

Due to silly packaging issues, I've taken the liberty of printing my own DVD labels and putting each disc in its own box. Half the time something is wrong with BBC packaging.",1398211200,,443,4.6075949367088604

5691411,3,B00C6ACVD6,"This was a gift for a friend who loves Dr. Who and is a completist video snob. When Dr. Who came back in 2005 I was thrilled, but now I'm kind of meh. Maybe because I loved it back in the day and now it's popular with a bunch of girls who only seem to like it because they think The Doctor is attractive and want to run away with him and make kissy face in time and space. Are ladies ruining fandom? I'm a lady so I guess I can't say that, but I definitely have an issue with folks who like a show, not because it's a good show but because they think the main actor's handsome and wouldn't watch the show otherwise.",1397779200,,615,3.928
5691412,1,B00C6ACVD6,"Series 7 of Doctor Who is probably my third favorite series since the show returned in 2005. I'd give it a five out of five star rating easily, but this review is for the DVD set, not the episodes themselves.

To put it plainly: the transfer on this set is garbage. I don't know what happened when the episodes were being transferred for release on this set, but the bitrate is in the toilet. I had another DVD set handy at the time -- Smallville: The Complete First Season, which was released at least 10 years ago -- and I did some number crunching. I used ""A Town Called Mercy"" from the Doctor Who set and ""Rogue"" from the Smallville set. Here's what I discovered:

The video bitrate for ""A Town Called Mercy"" averaged around 2.8Mbps, it never got above 3.5Mbps, and would sometimes drop as low as 1.6Mbps per second.

The video bitrate for ""Rogue"" averaged around 6Mbps, sometimes spiking as high as 7Mbps, never dropping lower than 3Mbps.

Even without watching the data display, the difference in picture quality was immediately apparent: Smallville looked like a regular old SD DVD, while Doctor Who looked like a poorly converted AVI file. The final season of LOST had this same issue when released on DVD a few years ago, and it was just as disappointing there as it is here. I'll include a picture showing the data header on each episode of the show, in which Doctor Who has tanked down to 1.8Mbps and Smallville is up at 7.6Mbps, a high to which Doctor Who never even comes close.

What's especially strange is the episodes-to-disc ratio. Smallville has four to five episodes per disc, whereas Doctor Who only has three episodes per disc. Yet Doctor Who is significantly more compressed and riddled with artifacts. Even allowing for the fact that Smallville had 192kbps stereo and Doctor Who has a 448kbps 5.1 soundtrack, there should have been plenty of room on the discs to increase the encode quality.

If you're a fan of the show, by all means pick up this season. It's a really strong offering. But stay away from the region 1 DVD, the encoding has been horribly butchered. Get the blu-ray instead.",1397692800,38,2114,4.63903743315508
5691413,5,B00C6ACVD6,"Matt Smith's final season, such great storytelling from Steven Moffatt.

interesting way to make a Dalek. I liked Dinosaurs on a spaceship. A great and fun story. The Power of Three shows us just how
bored a Timelord can get. Amy and Rory's departure from the series in The Angel's Take Manhattan really saddened me. This
brings me to the second half to this series with the introduction of the feisty Clara Oswald. From the Snowmen to The Name of
the Doctor this character brings new life to the series. Who say change isn't any good. Overall I liked this series too and hope to
enjoy more of this great show when the next season come around.",1394582400,,692,4.25

5691427,4,B00C6ACVD6,"Season 7 episodes are great! (nothing more to say about the show...... ) :)

Only 2 comments about the disc set:
1.  This new compact packaging is terrible.  Opened it up and the plastic flip pages that hold the discs are either not glued correctly or the plastic has broken away from portions of the binding.  Extremely poorly engineered - for the price of the BBC America disc sets, you'd think they'd put a little more into the physical aspect of these releases!

2.  The Amazon description says format ""Widescreen"", the packaging saya 16:9 Anamorphic.  If I put the TV screen to ""normal"", I get a standard ""box"" image (no letterboxing).
Not sure that the format description on the box means that it is truly widescreen, when I can play the same episodes downloaded from ITunes and the image is obviously letterboxed.

But again - I repeat - The show, and entire season were fantastic episodes, and a wonderful buildup to the 50th anniversary episode.",1393545600,2,954,4.739393939393939

5691429,5,B00C6ACVD6,"I gotta say, this was probably my favorite departure with the compainions.  It fit them so well, and I will miss the Ponds very much.  Now we get the Impossible Girl.  I really liked Clara (or Oswin) when we first meet her, but it seems as though I liked her less and less the more a saw her.  Maybe she will grow on me.",1393459200,,320,3.953125
5691430,4,B00C6ACVD6,"But I felt the ending was slightly weak.  Maybe because it wasn't a true ending but a cliffhanger for the special?  Anyway, I truly hated to see the Ponds leave the series.  And I have to be honest, I was never a fan of Amy Pond, she always seem to rub me the wrong way. But The Angels Take Manhattan was a very powerfully emotional and amazingly interesting episode.
Clara was a interesting mystery which lost some of her charm by the last episode The Name of the Doctor.  They kind of solved the mystery there in a way which I felt was a tad underwhelming.
Still, I enjoyed seeing the Daleks back in Asylum, the Cybermen back in Nightmare in Silver, even if both of this enemies acted a tad off.  I would think the Daleks would see the Doctor as a greater threat than some music being played on a planet by an unknown human.  But that's just me.
The Snowmen was interesting in how it brought back a old enemy for those of us who watched the original series and Cold War was wonderful for one who grew up in the Cold War and also liked the Ice Warriors.
A Town Called Mercy I enjoyed very much.  It had a few plot twists, was set in an old Western town (which in fact is one in Spain where many of the great Westerns have been filmed), and starred Ben Browder as Isaac.  He happens to be one of my favorite stars from Farscape (and later Star Gate), so I was very happy to see him.
overall I would say a Doctor Who fan would enjoy this season and should watch it to the end for to be prepared for the 50th anniversary special.",1393286400,4,1527,4.135135135135135

5691436,5,B00C6ACVD6,"This is ""season 7"" of the NEW Doctor Who series.  The old series of Doctor Who began in 1964 with William Hartnell playing the lead role.  That series ended in 1989 with Sylvester McCoy as the Doctor.  Then there was an American-made movie starring Paul McGann in 1996, as an attempt to regain public interest in the show.  After the movie, the Doctor Who franchise was effectively done.  The Doctor, at the end of the film, got called off to fight in the biggest war ever so that was that.  The new season picks up AFTER the war, and season 1 was aired in 2005.  Now in the seventh season of the new series, Matt Smith plays the 12th incarnation of the Doctor, as we discover here in Season 7 that there was another one who fought in the war who the audience has not yet met.  So previously it was just assumed that Matt Smith is the 11th but really he is the 12th, and at the very end of Season 7 we get a brief introduction to John Hurt as ""The War Doctor.""  You can step into this new series without watching the old series or the movie.  However, I strongly suggest that you start the new series with season 1 or season 5 and don't just jump straight into 7.  The first four seasons follow a series of related plot events and characters.  Then there is something of a break between seasons 4 and 5 where new viewers can start without too much trouble understanding how the show progresses.

Anyway, this set contains all episodes from Season 7, starting with the Christmas 2012 special ""The Doctor, the Widow, and the Wardrobe"" and then moving into the official season with ""Asylum of the Daleks.""  Including the Christmas episode, there are 15 episodes plus 2 mini-episodes in this set.  It ends with the final official Season 7 episode ""The Name of the Doctor.""  In addition to the regular episodes, it also has the mini-episodes from the middle of the series and a few extra ""prequel"" scenes available as special features.  It also has a bunch of other special features for those who are interested in behind the scenes, comic-con footage, etc.

This set DOES NOT include the 50th Anniversary Special episodes that were aired near Thanksgiving 2013, nor the Christmas special episode from 2013.  Those episodes (""Night of the Doctor"", ""Last Day,"" ""Day of the Doctor,"" and ""Time of the Doctor"") have to be purchased separately.  ""Night of the Doctor"" and ""Last Day"" are mini-episodes that come bundled with ""Day of the Doctor.""  I have not yet seen ""Time of the Doctor"" but the other ones really are a must-watch if you want to get some real closure to Series 7 so I recommend buying Series 7 and ""Day of the Doctor"" together.  In fact, you can think of ""The Name of the Doctor"" at the end of this series as sort of a to-be-continued episode, with ""Day of the Doctor"" being its conclusion.  Matt Smith is still piloting the TARDIS at the end of ""Day of the Doctor"" but the ""Time of the Doctor"" Christmas episode, which will not be available on DVD until Spring 2014, has him regenerate into the next Doctor.",1391990400,3,3014,4.489908256880734
5691437,5,B00C6ACVD6,I bought this for my daughter since she totally enjoys watching the show on TV.  She keeps on watching it.  She told me if your into Doctor Who this is one to get,1391472000,,162,3.878787878787879
5691438,5,B00C6ACVD6,"Some have not liked Steven Moffat's time (thus far) as the showrunner for Doctor Who.  I am not one of those people.  While I enjoyed Russell Davies' run and enjoyed both Eccleston and Tennant's Doctors, Matt Smith and Moffat (coupled with Karen Gillian, Arthur Darvill, and Jenna Coleman) have taken the show to heights previously unseen.  With how great Doctor Who has been, that is quite a statement.

Series 7 is a bit of an odd duck in a few ways.  It was split in two when it first aired, as Series 6 was.  The two halves are very much like two separate series.  The second half of Series 7 has a story arc that leads into The Name Of The Doctor, the finale, and also in the specials, Day Of the Doctor and The Time of the Doctor (not included in this set).

Unique here, however, is the fact that there are no two part episodes.  This is the first series in the revived series (and likely the first in the history of the show) where an entire series is all a set of one off episodes.  There are larger stories here.  The primary motif of the first half is the renewal and growth of Amy and Rory's relationship, leading to The Angels Take Manhattan.  We are introduced (kind of) to the big story arc from the second half of the series in the first episode, but that doesn't get revisited until The Snowmen (the Christmas Special in the middle of the series).  From there, we hop around a lot and end up just having fun to go along with some character development, leading to a huge event in the middle of the series.

The second half of the series kicks things into uber high gear with a set of one off episodes that all lead to a heck of a finale AND cliffhanger.  The first half is necessary to set up the Doctor for what is to come in the second half.

Overall, another incredible series for the Doctor.  A lot of emotion, mystery, action, adventure, and humor.  Doctor Who continues to be a show that can do everything and anything.  The most versatile format of any show out there.  Series 7 continues the greatness and, in many ways, accelerates it.",1391212800,2,2061,4.331592689295039

Not a huge deal, but inconveient due to the plastic sleves that hold the indivigual disks fall out every time I open it.

5691442,5,B00C6ACVD6,"Only minutes ago I finished watching the ominously titled final episode for the seventh season, The Name of the Doctor. I was thrilled by the season, thrilled by where they went in the end and thrilled by the expansion of some of the more colorful characters. That being said, there is nothing else I can talk about without giving away some spoilers, so for those still catching up in the Doctor Who universe, stop here. Your short, short, short version of the review is this: Its very good. Watch it.

*SPOILERS BELOW  LAST WARNING*

Now that the disclaimers are out of the way, HOLY CLARA, BATMAN! They really go for it this season with the creation of Clara Oswold, the impossible girl. In keeping with the tradition of finding companions for the Doctor who are increasingly adorable, Jenna-Louise Coleman steals the show with her playful, flirtatious and adventurous interpretation of Clara. The interaction between her and Matt Smith obviously was the cornerstone of the season and it worked like a magical charm. The youthful vitality of Coleman perfectly intertwined with the childish antics of Smiths Doctor.

The folks behind the scenes also went for broke by bringing the season all the way to the literal edge of the Doctors story, his own grave. Not just the place where the Smith version of him would be, but all versions. Waiting for him there is Richard E. Grant back in the role of the Great Intelligence, who is hell-bent on destroying every little shiny bit of the Doctors happiness, starting from the very day he was born until the end. Its a climax and intensity worthy of a season ender and the cliffhanger that follows is fantastically dramatic in the old style of Sci-Fi reveals.

Outside of the Doctor and Clara, this season also had amazing amounts of fun with Strax, Jenny and Madame Vastra on the good side of the coin. On the bad side, among many nasty villains, we get another terrifying episode with the Weeping Angels, who bring about the end to our favorite couple, the Ponds. Amy and Rory say their goodbyes in a tragic, but beautiful way, only made more touching by watching the behind the scenes footage of the two actors working on their last days on set. As a fan you can get so wrapped up in the universe of the fictional characters that you forget these are real people who spend inordinate amounts of time playing them, living them, breathing life into them and eventually having to walk away from them. Often times it is not an easy step to take, but I believe fans always appreciate seeing actors and writers who are willing to kill their darlings when they know it is time to move on.

Every disc in the box set has extras pertaining to the episodes included and helps give the fans all those extra bits of juicy info and trivia they love. There are a handful of bonus prequel scenes as well, created just to give you that little extra story, the other angle of a scene or character you didn't know was there.

Coming into the last three seasons and the run of Matt Smith I had a lot of grumblings and detractors who weren't pleased with his performance, so I began with a great sense of doubt. Yet as he readies himself to hang up the time lords bow tie for the last time I find myself extremely pleased with the ride Smith led us on. Each Doctor in the series since the beginning of the reboot has brought something new and I think in hindsight we have seen the regression, the de-aging of the Doctor from the angry,sarcastic adult of Eccleston to the adventurous teen spirit of Tennant to the youthful and rambunctious Smith. By keeping up on the news in the Whoverse, we now know the new Doctor will be played by Peter Capaldi, a much older actor, so I expect the tone to change as well, but instead of resenting it, I am excited by it.

The Complete Seventh Season box set offers fans a glorious way to enjoy the final season of Smith, while filling our tanks with anticipation of the adventures to come.",1390521600,,3952,4.556338028169014

The second half is filled with the Doctor (and the viewers) asking 'Who is Clara and what is she to the Doctor?' the answer is given in the season finale.",1388361600,,398,4.619718309859155

It can be argued that it was during Matt Smith's tenure as the Doctor that the show really took off, and became a mega hit in America, after so much time.  Although all the episodes are great, ""Asylum of the Daleks"" and ""The Angels Take Manhattan"" are probably the best of the first half.  ""The Snowmen,"" ""Bells of St. John,"" and ""The Name of the Doctor"" are the best from the second half, since they, along with ""Asylum,"" deal with the story of Clara, a woman the Doctor meets in three separate time periods.  The end of ""The Name of the Doctor"" leads into the 50th anniversary... and I'll just stop there.",1388361600,,874,4.4375
5691457,4,B00C6ACVD6,"I love Doctor Who, I enjoyed series 7 but it left me feeling a bit conflicted. This set has my a few of least favorite episodes so far. The Rings Of Alakazam (or whatever it was called) bored me to the point of frustration. That one episode felt longer than the three part finale in series 3 (which I thoroughly enjoyed). A Town Called Mercy feels like it was from another show altogether and they attempted a Doctor Who crossover. The Crimson Horror was an abysmal episode that felt like an attempted jump off point for a spinoff starring Vastra, Jenny, and Strax. Who would want a show about them? Their presence us always so forced and unnecessary.
Then there are episodes that aren't bad but I found them underwhelming, The Power of Three, and Hide come to mind. These episodes have some great moments but they aren't as enjoyable as stand-alone episodes from previous seasons.
Losing companions half-way through also felt a little weird but this is forgivable. The Christmas specials are wonderful. Asylum of The Daleks, The Angels Take Manhattan, and Nightmare In Silver are the best episodes from this season (just my opinion). There are plenty of extras included on this set. I'm not sure if I like this better then series 6, it's a bit of a tie. I give ot 4 stars simply because it didn't tick me iff as much as season 6 and we finally get a new companion.
This is Matt Smith's final season as The Doctor. He has done a wonderful job but deserved better writing.

5691461,4,B00C6ACVD6,"When I heard that Steven Moffat of JEKYLL and SHERLOCK was going to be taking over as the showrunner for DOCTOR WHO, I was more excited about this show than I had been at any point in my life because I was never a fan of The Doctor. But after seeing 50th Anniversary special ""The Day of The Doctor"", my whole outlook on The Doctor changed. I loved that special so much that I had to find out more about him, so thanks to Netflix, I have binge-watched the series for the last month beginning with the Ninth Doctor and have now made it all the way through this season (and this season thanks to a friend that owned this, since Netflix streaming ends with the sixth season), and can say that this is both the some of the best and some of the least of the seasons I've seen. It's still eminently watchable, but there are problems.

It took me a while to get with Matt Smith after how brilliant David Tennant was, but not being a longtime fan, I knew it probably would take me longer considering I watched about fifty-odd hours of this show since November. But once I was with Smith, I was WITH him. And if nothing else, this season has some of the best episodes I've seen. The significant high points of this season were ""Asylum of the Daleks"", ""Dinosaurs on a Spaceship"", ""Cold War"" (mostly because I kind of love Liam Cunningham), ""Nightmare in Silver"", ""The Name of The Doctor"", and of course, the emotionally devastating ""The Angels Take Manhattan"". I'm about to enter into some SPOILERISH territory, so if you don't want more information than what's already at hand, skip to the next paragraph. I so loved The Ponds. Karen Gillan and Arthur Darvill played Amelia and Rory so ridiculously well that they became my favorite companions, and to see them go in the way that they did was perfectly bittersweet. But then I had to get all set for Jenna-Louise Coleman. Especially after ""Asylum of the Daleks"" AND ""The Snowmen"", I didn't quite know how they were going to work her in, and I also didn't know if I was really going to get along with her after The Ponds. More importantly, I didn't know how The Doctor was going to get along with her, other than the sheer mystery of her being The Impossible Girl.

Coleman as Clara Oswald is totally irrepressable and incredibly adorable, but I feel strongly that as an audience, we haven't seen enough of who she is to justify some of the drastic and extremely loyal actions she takes in this series. And it's also when Clara becomes his new companion that the season starts to shift in mostly a lesser direction. I always enjoy the ideas that Moffat and his writers put forth, but they don't always tend to work. Episodes like ""The Crimson Horror"", ""Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS"" and ""The Rings of Akhaten"" are interesting enough in their ideas, but the core of these episodes doesn't quite work as well as it should. However, when the episodes really come together, they are remarkable. While the emotional gutpunch of ""The Angels Take Manhattan"" is hard to overcome (as well as the wicked genius of having the Statue of Liberty becoming a 'Weeping Angel'), the strongest episode of the season is arguably ""Nightmare in Silver"", written by the legendary Neil Gaiman, who also wrote the perhaps equally brilliant ""The Doctor's Bride"" from Season Six, and it really showcases Matt Smith's versatility to play a lighter and darker character all in one person.

So, from a newer semi-Whovian (I don't know if I'll be able to get with the pre-Modern Era Doctors), while there are some low-lights in this season , the highlights heavily outshine them. And we shall say goodbye in less than 24 hours of me writing this review to the Raggedy Man, and hello to Peter Capaldi as The Twelfth Doctor (it's Christmas Eve of 2013), but Matt Smith will certainly leave a legacy behind him surely as one of the most beloved Doctors and this season did solidify that.",1387843200,2,3900,4.57653791130186

The writing was marginally better this season than is has been in the past two years making this the best Matt Smith season of the three, (but that's not saying much).  I thought the ""good-bye"" to Amy and Rory was done well and the TARDIS is aesthetically looking so much better now than the past two years.

However, the writing is still weak at best.  And how I still pine for the Eccleston and Tennant years when the Doctor wasn't a bow tie-wearing bunny, hopped up on crack, and waving around the sonic screwdriver like it was a magic wand.  Turning what used to be a ""door-unlocker"" into a magic wand is an emblematic crutch for poor writing.  Regeneration can't come soon enough for this Doctor and the series.  There is real hope on the horizon with the choice of Peter Capaldi as number 12.  He could bring so much maturity to this character if he only gets some decent writing.

5691481,5,B00C6ACVD6,"I am not a Doctor Who fan, in general.  I have been aware of the series for years, and have a great deal of respect for it as the longest running series ever.  That is also why I tend not to like it, overall.  When you develop a mechanic that allows you to replace the cast every few years or so, yes the series lives on, but you have new people.  What if the new people don't click?  What if the newest doctor doesn't grab your attention?  New companions' dynamic are not believable?

That has been my trouble for the longest time.  I knew of the series, had a grasp of the various races and plots, but... I never clicked with actors.  So, I couldn't get into it.  And then, they stumbled upon Matt Smith and I finally found a doctor I could grasp, one that actually grabbed my attention.  More than that, his companions didn't bother me.  The Ponds worked, River Song made sense, even the cameo companions (like Roy's Dad) played out well.

When they change up the cast, I catch a few episodes (recently through means like Netflix), to give it a chance.  If they cannot grab me in 3 episodes, they never will.  Matt Smith and his gang hit the mark and, after the 3rd episode, I instantly ordered all the series that portrayed him as the Doctor (as well as ordered the ""day of the doctor"" special out in Dec).  They did THAT well.  Never owned any Doctor Who before, but it landed so well, I went all out.

That is what I recommend to people that do not know, or are curious about, Doctor Who.  Find a few episodes, on Youtube, Netflix, or whatever.  Each new Doctor is a different taste.  See if any of the land with you.  There are 11 (soon to be 12) different doctors and all are a hit or miss, if you ask me.

You might find one you enjoy, or love them all.  But, give it a shot.  The show has been around since the 60's.  It must be doing something right, maybe even something you can get into... if even just for as long as the span of one Doctor.",1383696000,6,1954,4.171581769436997

The set contains a few extras that have not been released before, but if you want to save some money, you might simply buy Part 1, Part 2, and The Snowmen separately, since you will acquire nearly all of the extras.  One thing I did find puzzling, and I'm not sure if it is my equipment or the set itself, is the 5.1 Dolby audio feature found in the ""Set Up"" menu.  On my equipment, I could not access this feature on the discs that featured the Ponds, but it was fully accessible for those that involved Clara Oswald.  As of this writing, I still have not figured out why this is.  The plastic backing for Disc 1 also was cracked in shipment, though I did not think this serious enough to detract from the set.  All the episodes play as they should (apart from the sound issue I mention above), and there are a few more special features on the American version than on the UK version to be released soon.  Overall, the set is long overdue.  It is a shame that it does not include the still-yet-to-be-released 50th anniversary episode or the 2013 Christmas special.

5691491,3,B00C6ACVD6,"Season seven of the latest revival of Doctor Who was previously released in two divided packages, but now the complete season is available in this set along with two Christmas specials. Fans must have patience with their Doctor Who purchases, but those who did not rush out and by the episodes in the separate box sets now has the option of getting them all together, with new commentary tracks and other special features.

  This four disc set begins with ""The Doctor, The Widow and the Wardrobe,"" which is the Christmas special that was widely loathed by fans. The special is actually about Christmas themes, rather than just being set during the holidays. Comparisons can be made to the previous year's adaptation of ""A Christmas Carol"" in the Doctor Who world. If you disliked that one, Season Seven's Christmas special will likely leave a bad taste in your mouth. They do their best to make up for it with the opening episode, ""Asylum of the Daleks,"" giving a plethora of the fan-favorite monsters.

  This series has always been on the sillier side, though the humor and camp seems even more amplified in the new series. Matt Smith is the fifth doctor in this revival referred to as ""NuWho"" by the franchise's dedicated fan base. Season seven has fifteen total episodes, fit onto four discs with a number of special features. There are only a handful of commentaries, which may disappoint some fans, but there are also plenty of featurettes with behind-the-scene footage.

But, the hype aside, and some time between first viewing and now, the season is satisfying. There are just a few things:

1. The stand-alone episodes in the first half of the season, for me at least, are less satisfying than those in the second half that are crossed by a story arc. While many people criticized the timey wimey story arcs in Season 6, I loved them. So, the stand-alones were lesser episodes for me. That doesn't mean they weren't good or that I didn't like them. They are just not my favorites of Season 7.

2. There are lots of extras on this DVD set. I've seem almost all of them, but it's great to have them in the set for repeat viewing. Unlike the Doctor, I don't ""hate repeats""! At least, not where Doctor Who is concerned.

3. One VERY BIG disappointment for me is the fact that the Doctor Who BBC Proms concert from July 2013 was not included in the set. It really should have and could have been included. I was very happy to be able to watch the 2010 BBC Doctor Who Proms concert on a set from an earlier season and fail to see why BBC held back this time. This is the reason I gave the set 4-stars instead of 5-stars. Yeah, the concert was that good!",1379808000,24,1689,4.222910216718266
5691496,5,B00C6ACVD6,"I have been so excited about getting the new season of Doctor Who.  Usually they bring out the box set a few months after the finale, but they decided to make us wait it out this time without even telling us a set date for the release (which is a cruel tease). It has taken all of my willpower just to keep myself from caving and buying everything separately (An extremely hard task to do when the brand has become so huge that even stores like Wal-Mart and Target sell them).  I pre-ordered the dvd box set as soon as Amazon finally put a release date (which was September 24th).  When I was on here two days ago, it still said that date, yet today I come on and it's October 22th..... WHY, WHY, WHY! This is changing from teasing into straight out bullying!!! All those months ago, I had figured that they were adding extra things to the box set since it's the 50th Anniversary, but now I just don't know what to think anymore.  If you are going to make me wait until the END of October to finally get the season, why not just wait until after the 50th Anniversary Special in November and put it all together for some spectacular box set.  Why do this?",1379635200,2,1154,4.251141552511416
5691497,2,B00C6ACVD6,"I bought all the different elements separately and for cheaper and I'm glad I did.  They've only got 4 commentaries out of 15 shows?  That's lame. And you'll be lucky to get a decent line up doing the commentaries. Amazon and the BBC have really screwed up the set this time.  amazon prices have varied wildly on this set and the BBC certainly wasn't making the purchase easier by not giving proper information on what would be included. AND the BBC stretching one season out over such a long period of time, it gets very confusing including material that stretches from 2011 through 2013.  Bad form. I've gotten the complete series sets in the past but in this particular interest, everyone dropped the ball.  I expect better by now. We also probably won't get decent information on the 50th and Christmas special this year and whther they'll be included with series 8 or not. Who knows?

If the BBC does happen to see this, I'd say bundle the 50th anniversary special, the Gatiss produced An Adventure in Time and Space and the 2013 Smith Christmas finale special all together as one set so we don't have to wait until *2015* to see what will be included with series 8.

For a synopsis of each episode and special, as well as the bonus features that have already been issued on DVD/Blu-Ray, check out reviews of the previous DVD/BluRay issues.

I can't believe it! For series 7, I caved in and bought Parts 1 & 2 and the Christmas Special separately, because it hadn't made a difference for series 6. And now look what they've done. The Complete Seventh Series will have commentary on four shows. I love the commentaries on the Classic Dr. Who series.

5691499,5,B00C6ACVD6,"According to doctorwhonews.net, Doctor Who: The Complete Seventh Series ""does not include the 2011 Christmas Special, The Doctor, The Widow and the Wardrobe.""  Yet, the review here says it does.

Which one is right - or is it only the Region 1 version that contains the 2011 Christmas Special, The Doctor, The Widow and the Wardrobe?  Thanks!

UPDATE:  Apparently, it is part of the Region 1 version, and had been left out of the UK version.  But even there, the BBC has conceded:

""BBC Worldwide has bowed to fan pressure and agreed to include the 2011 Christmas special, The Doctor, The Widow and the Wardrobe on the UK version of the Complete Series Seven DVD Boxed Set.""",1375142400,18,674,4.7094017094017095

Now I find I could have the ENTIRE seventh season along with additional interviews, etc.  I feel this is a rip off of those who have followed this series for so long.  I also feel that Amazon should have given some information about this new release when I was ordering these 3 DVDs.  It leaves a bad taste in my mouth.",1374969600,8,417,4.098765432098766
5691501,3,B00C6ACVD6,"This is very over priced, but will hopefully come down.

I liked the Ponds final story arc and was fine with their conclusion. I did not care for the second half of the series. The new companion Clara, is basically a Mary Sue 10x. Hoping she is more interesting with the 12th Doctor.

Matt was great, as were Karen, Alex and Arthur. Jenna Loiuse Coleman is a good actress, personally the character is contrived, but she is good.

Die are fans may buy right away, but for me, I will wait till price drops. I bought series 6 ASAP, but 7 can wait.

This is the first series run of new Who I have been disappointed with, storyline wise. I am hoping re watching, it will be better",1374969600,8,675,4.25
5691502,5,B00C6ACVD6,"Okay first off I love the series and season 7. So I rated it based on that I like the show-- not about this item.

I just don't understand why this is being released when myself, and probably everyone else, own Part One and Part Two along with the separate specials. Why release this when you have all the other DVDs out there, or why release all of the separate ones when the company intended to release this one? This goes with all other shows that consistently do this-- it's a waste of DVDs and a waste of people's money when they believe that a full season collection won't be released.",1374537600,3,591,4.324324324324325
5691503,2,B00C6ACVD6,"At the time i write this you can pre-order this for about $70. However, consider the following:

The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe - $9.99
Series 7 part 1 - $14.99
The Snowmen - $9.99
Series 7 part 2 - $14.99

Total: About $50.00

'The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe' doesn't is just the Doctor helping a family, so you don't really need it. That would make about $40. So i reccomend buying them seperate.

If you can't release the whole season why bother. I hate to wait to see if the whole series is going to come out. What's the reason for all this for to just have people buy the series in parts  rather have the whole series in the first place.

Fifty years. I haven't been alive quite that long, but the scope of this brilliant show still strikes ""wow!"" on me. In a great way!

8577605,4,B00C6ACVD6,"I'm a big fan of Dr Who, having been watching it, on and off, since Tom Baker was the Doctor. I really liked the 7th series. It was sad to see Amy go and Clara was actually much better than I thought she might be. Almost all of the episodes were good and some were excellent, plus we even got a new episode written by Neil Gaiman.

However, as much as I liked the series, I'm very disappointed in one aspect of the series, hence the loss of one star. This has nothing to do with the episodes themselves, but with what they chose to leave out of the series packaging. I can see, sort of, leaving out the special The Day of the Doctor. After all it had both Matt Smith and David Tennant as doctors 10 and 11, as well as John Hurt as the War Doctor, plus even a cameo by Tom Baker, though, maybe, not as the 4th Doctor. And it was billed as a 50th Anniversary Special, so even though it was part of the Matt Smith series 7, I can see it existing outside of the normal run of episodes.

What I can't see is leaving out the episode The Time of the Doctor from the 7th series collection. It was not a special in the normal sense of the word. It was a normal length episode that concluded Matt Smith's run as the Doctor and had his regeneration into the 12th Doctor, portrayed by Peter Capaldi. This is a crucial episode that rightly is the last episode of series 7. To leave it out and sell it as a separate special is totally inconsistent with the practices of all the past collections. It means that, when you buy the 7th series, you never see the actual end of the 11th Doctor. It also means when you buy the 8th series, it just starts right up with Peter Capaldi already the 12th Doctor and no indication of how he became the Doctor. Of course, if you watched the show on BBCA, you already know what happened, but if you only see the show on the DVDs, it leaves a crucial gap.

There is no reason for leaving out The Time of the Doctor from the collection, except maybe just greed to make you spend $10 or $12 on the stand alone one hour DVD or Blu-ray, respectively. I, myself, have no intention of buying the stand alone episode. I saw it on BBCA and don't see is as being worth the money for just a one hour show. However, it does make me feel like my collection is incomplete missing that one crucial episode, and for that, the series 7 collection loses one star.",1498867200,8,2365,4.136956521739131
