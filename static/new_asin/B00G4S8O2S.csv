6058859,2,B00G4S8O2S,"This concert was a very watered down production of her normal show.  I saw her in my home town and she was much better.  I recognize that in Vegas you must put on a different kind of show, but she should not have put this out on DVD.  She should have taped in one of her normal cities for her fans.  Still if you are a Beyonce fan like I am, you have to have it.",1260576000,3,362,3.723684210526316

6058910,5,B00G4S8O2S,"I have been trying to order this dvd every since I saw the concert on cable.
It was a great performance, great audience and Beyonc was professional as usual.  She really take one to different dimensions in life.
She and Usher are my favorite artist, so young but so wise for their years.",1397779200,,287,4.415094339622642
6058911,5,B00G4S8O2S,"To all those who gave this DVD a poor rating because it was supposedly boring, I beg of you: what did you expect? After all, it is called ""an intimate performance at the encore theater"". For those of you who are unfamiliar with the encore theater at the Wynn, it is a small venue that has a maximum capacity of 200 or so. So don't expect this to be a big budget production like the rest of the shows on her I am...world tour. I personally loved this show. It gave her an opportunity to really connect with her fans and perform songs that she's never done live before like resentment, that's why you're beautiful, and satellites. So yes, the set list is ballad heavy but that doesn't mean it's boring and if you think so, you're missing the whole point. It is these more mellow numbers on I am...that are often overlooked that she wanted to spotlight with this intimate showcase.",1387497600,3,878,4.425925925925926
6058912,5,B00G4S8O2S,"The Destiny's Child medley was so incredible, that I would recommend this Blu Ray simply for that.

It's beautifully shot, and you can't go wrong with Blu Ray. Looks fantastic.",1387238400,,176,4.866666666666666
6058913,5,B00G4S8O2S,"This is a truly superb performance from one of the world's greatest entertainers. The quality is top-notch and Beyonce's voice comes through loud and clear on the blu-ray. There are some really great arrangements, including a slow version of 'Sweet Dreams.' Beyonce shines in Vegas!",1373328000,,282,5.288888888888889
6058914,5,B00G4S8O2S,"I was a little unsure if I would like this when I first purchased it, but after I watched it I was extremely satisfied with it. Sometimes you buy an intimate performance for an artist and they don't entertain you as much or you hate the way they do their songs in the performance. I was very pleased that this was not an issue with this dvd. It was a very special performance that actually goes through her career and she gives you some very intimate details on what people have told her about her albums and why she strives so hard to entertain everybody. I also found it very awesome that she could have a performance in this style because their are not very many artists that could pull off a performance like this. Some people will sugar-coat performances just because of who is performing, but I've never found it honest to do that. I am not sugar-coating this concert at all. It takes a lot of talent to actually pull off this kind of performance and Beyonce did it as if it took nothing for her to do. I find it a very satisfying dvd and I would recommend this dvd to everyone who enjoys Beyonce and wants to see how an artist can truly up the stakes in the way of intimate performances.",1359504000,2,1194,4.287610619469026
6058915,5,B00G4S8O2S,"Excellent performance! Beyonce at her best. Video and audio quality superb. Filmed in wide aspect ratio ( 2.35 to 1 ) which was perfect for wide stage. Also might note that stage lighting was excellent.... and the dancers.. well that's another story. Might I say... extremely talented and sexy? And for the girls out there, the guys looked great too.",1350432000,,350,4.85
6058916,5,B00G4S8O2S,I've watched it several times and never gets tired of watching it.  :)  this is better than the World Tour DVD,1337299200,,110,4.190476190476191
6058917,5,B00G4S8O2S,"Beyonce out does herself on this one!  The small intimate setting compliments her raw talent perfectly. Her voice is just beatiful. She gives 110% the entire show. The setting doesnt allow for all the theatrics the larger stage does, but you would never know it from Beyonce.  Well worth the money!!!!!!!!!!!!",1325203200,,309,5.03921568627451
6058918,5,B00G4S8O2S,This is one of her best. Once again she delivers live. The audio of this show is fantastic. I really love the way she kept the show intimate with all of the acoustics and live instruments of the show.,1316304000,,200,4.153846153846154
6058919,5,B00G4S8O2S,I really like many of Beyonce's performances; she is truly the artistic entertainer she has set out to be! :`) TS,1311897600,,113,4.428571428571429
6058940,5,B00G4S8O2S,"This is a fine introduction to Beyonce.  As a singer, she doesn't have the range or purity of, say, Celine Dion, but who does?  She is, however, an Entertainer, and this blu-ray disc is a worthy substitute for actually paying hundreds of dollars for a front row seat at a Las Vegas show.  In fact, on a decent surround system with a decent Hi-Def large screen, this disc is BETTER than a front row seat -- no worrying about people talking near you or coughing or otherwise breaking your concentration.  Beyonce is deservedly in the top rank of performers, and her onstage presence is at the top of that top rank.",1297728000,3,612,4.486486486486487
6058941,5,B00G4S8O2S,I fell in love with Beyonce the first time I say her but this one top them all. 5 STARS,1293926400,,87,3.4
6058942,2,B00G4S8O2S,"One of her more boring DVDs. I would buy a different one if I had to repurchase a Beyonce concert on DVD. Plus, her outfit is weird.",1288051200,,132,3.925925925925926
6058943,2,B00G4S8O2S,"This is her worst concert to date. Her outfits were beautiful as usual, but the there were barely any lights and the atmosphere was dark. I enjoyed the other DVD's more with the bright lights and dance moves!",1286841600,,208,4.5
6058944,5,B00G4S8O2S,"After watching&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Beyonce-Experience-Live-Blu-ray/dp/B0011V9XT6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Beyonce Experience Live [Blu-ray</a>] a couple of months ago, I became a huge fan of Beyonce, in fact so much so that I was afraid to watch this DVD, for fear that it would be a disappointing anti-climax.  I'm relieved and delighted to report that my fears were unfounded, and Beyonce has delivered yet again!

I'm now thoroughly convinced that Beyonce is a complete performing artist: a natural beauty (luck of the genes, plus great styling doesn't hurt), a vocalist as good as anyone out there, a dancer strong enough to keep up with her professional dancers, an innovative songwriter with a surprisingly diverse range, an effective team builder and leader, and a visionary with the imagination and creativity needed to put all of the pieces together in a way that results in harmonious synergy.

Focusing on this performance in particular, the first half consists mostly of vulnerable ballads which really showcase Beyonce's sublime vocal ability.  In the second half, she gives us a chronological medley of many of her up-tempo hits, accompanied by comments about the genesis of the songs, so that we effectively get a capsule autobiography.  All of this contributes to successfully delivering the intimate performance Beyonce was aiming for.

And please don't forget to watch the DVD bonus material which describes the concept beyond this performance and the preparation that went into it.  It confirms what you may have already inferred:  Beyonce knows in detail what she wants to achieve artistically, she works extremely hard to achieve it, and she expects her team to commit to a similar level of effort.

If you want to experience one of the great performing artists of our time, don't miss this DVD.  What a privelege it would be to see Beyonce perform live or, better yet, to meet her in person!",1283644800,2,1978,5.413680781758957
6058945,2,B00G4S8O2S,"OK i love Beyonce. I think she's a talented artist and a very entertaining performer. She usually gives it her ALL. I went to the ""I am Yours"" concert in Anaheim in 2009 and she blew my mind. It was amazing! That being said, i was disappointed with her intimate performance at the Wynn. It was a snoozefest. I slept about 3 times through the dvd. She sang songs i didn't know like satellite & some others. Why couldn't she perform more hits like baby boy, upgrade you?! Bottom line: Don't waste your money buying this dvd unless you're looking for something to help with your insomnia! Check out ""The Beyonce Experience"" dvd instead.",1281398400,2,633,4.56140350877193
6058946,5,B00G4S8O2S,"This is one of the best shows of Beyonce, and Amazon was fantastic with your care, solving the posting problem immediately. I recommend the show and Amazon.",1273622400,,156,4.814814814814815
6058947,5,B00G4S8O2S,"As a former professional trumpet player, I was impressed with the all-female band.  What a great idea by Beyonce to defeat the stereotypes that certain 'masculine' instruments (e.g. trumpet, drums) can't be played by females at the highest levels.  I was also amazed at the high endurance that Beyonce displayed despite the exhausting rehearsal and preparation schedule that was included on the DVD as an added documentary.",1272240000,,423,5.298507462686567
6058948,5,B00G4S8O2S,"Beyonce's Wynn performance blu-ray dvd is superb - just watched it for the first time last night.  After showcasing her beautiful voice with ballad-type vocals in the first part of the show, she kicks it up into high-energy during the last half of the show with a sizzling-hot set.  I really enjoyed her tribute to Ella and scats, very well done b-bop tune in the mix. Great guest taps too.  Eclectic, stylish and compelling event.

Highlights included most of her classics plus new tunes, done in a creative storytelling type format, as she delivers a more personal concert (still with hundreds of excited fans) at the Encore at Wynn.  A very personal, well-delivered, high energy winner - this is another great concert dvd well worth getting.  The 'making of' video is super, too - shows how much work she (and her crew) put into thoughtfully getting the song list, the theme and delivery put together.

Agree too w/other reviewer about how good it is to see an all-lady band, that's a great role model for women everywhere, about a ""yes I can do it"" attitude.  So much hard work and dedication, thanks for bringing out your best for everyone.  It shows, and you shine.  Thanks for being an inspiration to all of us, for all your hard work and dedication to the craft, and for being world-class.

6058949,5,B00G4S8O2S,"I bought the copy of this about two days ago, I watched it yesterday. I just can't believe that I already owned this DVD concert. This is her greatest concert ever, maybe because she was the one who conceptualize everything, she is really into it. She didn't mind being closer to her audience as she wants to extends the intimacy as what the title of the show is. I will be forever fan of her. she is a great singer, dancer and actress rolled into one that is why she is greatest performer I know. Furthermore, she is beautiful, she does her own make, I guess. I like the hair, the lip tint and the costumes were so Fabulous and looks like comfortable to her. Her sexiness and bounciness were shown.

I have all of Beyonce's and Destiny's Child's concert DVDs and this one surpasses them all for showcasing Beyonce's talent as a singer, songwriter, and performer. The smaller, less showy setting works perfect for the intimate storytelling theme she was going for. There isn't a moment in the show where Beyonce isn't giving 100%. Even when she's not singing or dancing, she's working it for her audience by her posture, energy, and facial expressions. From song #1 to song #20 her passion and energy remains high for the entire show. A fantastic DVD, highly entertaining, and well worth the money!",1262649600,12,642,4.845454545454546
