8276313,5,B0001MMGNG,"It's simply a DVD version of all the pregame, game, and postgame festivities of that night from the ABC broadcast, without any commercials or halftime show.

I think it's a very good addition to any Nole fan's collection, although I think you should add ""Wire-To-Wire"" the video of the entire 1999 season to add to the experience. Wire-To-Wire has the highlights of this game in it, too, but not the whole game, obviously.",1394064000,,422,4.780821917808219
8276314,1,B0001MMGNG,"I ordered the DVD of the 1994 FEDEX Orange Bowl and was sent the 2000 Sugar Bowl DVD.  I did receive a return tag to send it back, but no way to talk to anyone.  Great price, but was probably not worth saving a few bucks when you have to go through all the hassle just to get the correct product you ordered.",1142208000,,308,3.873015873015873
