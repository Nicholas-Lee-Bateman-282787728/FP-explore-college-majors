7950897,5,B00005QTA0,"New World Disorder 2 has a good soundtrack, and has obviously evolved a lot from New world disorder 1. It has a lot of crazy stunts, and features bender's Crazy Drops, and has kris holm's crazy Unicycling. Also, If you buy the DVD (which I reccomend) it has great extras like the making of hell Track California, and unizaba. Unizaba is a film about 10 min. long featuring Kris holm and another unicycler doing crazy things. Overall I'd rate this a 5- Since it's a greatmovie, barely lacking any thing. the one thing I didn't like about it is it's length. about 45 min. I'd reccomend this and the whole New world disorder collection to get, but if your only gonna get one. Get New World Disorder 2, then Plan on getting New world Disorder 3 later. I highly reccomend these Free-ride based films",1041379200,,794,4.520833333333333

The footage is awesome, even better then NWD Part I (hard to imagine). Forget Kranked - this is the real thing! And by the way: you can never have to much travel! Let's go for a ride!",1029196800,3,330,4.092307692307692
