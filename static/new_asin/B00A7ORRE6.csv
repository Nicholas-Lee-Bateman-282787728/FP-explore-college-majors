8547982,4,B00A7ORRE6,"The store of outspoken atheist Kanji Lalji Mehta (Paresh Rawal) is destroyed in an earthquake.  The insurance declares it an ""Act of God"" and refuses to pay.  Kanji decides to sue God, through His earthly spokespersons, to get the money owed.  Surprisingly, Lord Krishna (Akshay Kumar) takes human form, and comes Kanji's aid.

This somewhat controversial comedy-drama provides thought-provoking points about religion.  The final two-fold message is positive, though. Firstly, that God is everywhere, and temples and idols are not necessary.  Secondly, people should not fear God, but love Him as a friend.

Rawal is fantastic in his role, both humorous and serious.  Kumar's small but important part is played with gentleness and even godliness.  Mithun Chakraborty played a minor character with perfection. The music is mainly incidental and background (with the exception of one item number) and some of it is quite beautiful.  Overall, if one is willing to have religion examined in skeptical ways, this is a fine movie.",1522195200,,1024,5.304347826086956
