171949,5,0892216972,"In the briefest layman's terms I found this DVD enlightening. Without this video I would have never come to know the extent to which National Geographic (as well as scientists who feel threatened)push FALSE scientific finds as ""missing links""! It is sad to see scientists (as well as museums) who tout theory as fact when it just simply isn't. I commend all fellow scientists who stand up to and or against this blatant propaganda and continue to scientifically test theory in search of the truth.

171950,5,0892216972,"I heard about this documentary in a free newspaper and since I'm interested in evolution and personally see many problems with the widely accepted theory, I went on the internet and streamed it. Unfortunately, I only got to see the last 15mins as I had to go out but from what I'd seen, it was a well-made and well-researched film.

I bought the DVD, expecting much of it to be your average ignorant creationist film, made by people that clearly don't understand the theory of evolution. I was pleasantly surprised the film is made by well-informed people and interviews scientists who believe in evolution and some that don't. It points out real problems for evolution and allows the viewer to make up their own mind. It looks at the science behind evolution, rather than merely quoting bible passages, which makes it ideal for anyone, no matter what religion they subscribe to.

I found it extremely credible because no creationist scientists were interviewed (Dr. Gish is a footnote), and therefore the potential accusation of biased interpretations are avoided. All the scientists/ paleontologists/ professors interviewed accept evolution, yet their evidence and interpretations refute the theory. I've taken my children to many Natural History museums, and without this book/DVD we would have never seen the fossil evidence that shows modern reptiles, fish, amphibians, birds (I thought birds were supposed to have evolved from dinosaurs?) and mammals are found buried with dinosaurs. I highly recommend getting the DVD/book as a set, as well as the second DVD/book episode which proves some paleontologists are engaged in fraud (I don't understand how the fellow at National Geographic kept his job!) The pictures of bird and smaller mammal fossils are excellent, but I would have liked to see more pictures of larger mammals with the dinosaur fossils (or at least an explanation for there smaller numbers when compared to the other fossils.).

171964,5,0892216972,"How many times over the years, nay, decades, have we heard evolutionists say that they have been quoted out of context.  But it doesn't take much to give the lie to this oft-repeated dodge.  Take for example the portion of this presentation that deals with whale evolution in which evolutionists are given considerable freedom to express their frank opinions:

Kevin Padian a very prominent paleontologist at Berkley says on camera that one would have to be blind or three-days dead not to see the evidence for whale evolution as he has seen at the University of Michigan.

Two other experts, one from San Diego State University, the other from Howard University,  talked about Rodhocetus, a whale intermediate having had a fluke just like a modern whale.  One of these experts said that very few modifications were needed to make Rodhocetus into a whale.

However, Dr. Gingerich of the University of Michigan who discovered and described Rodhocetus said he had not found the fossil evidence for the fluke and that he merely speculated on the animal having one.  He also said on camera that the fossil evidence he subsequently found for the forelimbs did not accord with its having flippers or a fluke.  It is interesting that the other experts are not aware of the actual state of affairs with Rodhocetus.

My biology textbook that I use with my students also shows Rhodocetus with a very large fluke and with flippers.

It's standard practice for those who have given quotes to backtrack and say that they were misquoted, such is the pressure from fellow evolutionists for having given ammunition to ""those creationists""(Please see Ben Stein's movie Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed which reveals the  severe persecution of scientists who dare to question Darwinism).  Anyone watching the above segment, however,  can see very plainly that the speakers were allowed to speak their opinions very freely.  There is no other conclusion than that there really is no whale evolution (especially when it is considered, as the film shows us, that ambulocetus, another fossil whale intermediate, has been sidelined, and that at least 3 different ancestors of the whale have been proposed, the hyena, a cat-like animal, and the hippopotamus; Darwin had proposed the bear).

The segment with Dr. Timothy Rowe from the University of Texas is very interesting because he was interviewed at length.  He was interviewed regarding purported feathered dinosaurs from the Liaoning Province in China.  Dr. Rowe ran the cat- scan technology at the university and the movie producers tell us up front that he supports evolution.  Here are some of his findings:

- one fossil which to the naked eye looked to him authentic, under the cat-scan revealed three layers.  The outer two layers were natural.  The middle layer had bits of metal and grouting.  He concluded that the fossil had been tampered with by humans.
- the second one, Archaeoraptor, was a mosaic of several different rock fragments and five different animals, one of which was a dinosaur and another a bird.

Regarding Archaeoraptor, Dr. Rowe told National Geographic scientists who had retained him to scan the fossil, what his findings were.  Still the scientists of Geographic held a news conference the next day declaring it to be a genuine feathered dinosaur and three months later published an article in their magazine heralding it as a major find.

The reason, I think that creationists, tend to not reveal their identity to those who they are interviewing is so that they can get a frank opinion.  What the viewing public gets in this presentation Evolution: The Grand Experiment is the true state of evolutionary theory complete with its endless speculations and serious lack of evidence.

Anyone who has seriously critiqued evolution over the years will have to agree with Dr. M. Giertych, population geneticist of the Polish Academy of Sciences, that evolution is a philosophy, not a science.

There is much more in this DVD presentation and apparently much more material in the book that goes along with it.  I am looking forward to the book.",1320537600,5,4103,5.035555555555556

In 1938 the discovery of a large, unusual fish turned the scientific community on end. Dubbed a living fossil, the discovery of a coelacanth in South Africa shocked scientists around the world who thought this type of fish had died out millions of years prior during the process of evolution. Living fossils are organisms found preserved in the fossil record, which still exist in similar form today. If the core concepts of the theory of evolution presuppose change over time, then how can these living fossils exist for millions of years remaining virtually unchanged?

Dr. Werner takes you around the world on a unique scientific expedition from remote dig sites and museums to the Australian Rainforest and more. Filmed in seven countries on three continents, and at dig sites, museums, and universities, this challenging resource critically examines the fossil evidence of Darwin's theory. Designed to accompany Dr. Carl Werner's text of the same name, the DVD is divided into short sections corresponding to most chapters in the book. Includes an interview with Dr. Werner. DVD features English, Spanish and German subtitles. Approx. 58 minutes.

About the Author
Dr. Carl Werner received his undergraduate degree in biology, with distinction, at the University of Missouri, graduating summa cum laude. He received his doctoral degree in medicine at the age of 23. He was the recipient of the Normal D. Jones Science Award and is the executive producer of Evolution: The Grand Experiment video series.

171967,1,0892216972,"This series is a very high quality production.  So high quality that it is bound to provoke belief in those who are not cautious enough to question it - especially those who've struggled with reconciling their religious teachings with the theory of evolution.  It gives them a way to still believe, and they will be relieved.  But if you value truth more than your personal comfort, then before watching this series, please do yourself a favor: Watch the NOVA documentary called ""Judgment Day: Intelligent Design on Trial.""  It is about the court case involving a school in Dover, PA in which the school board forced the science faculty to read a statement claiming intelligent design is a valid althernative scientific theory to Darwin's theory of evolution.  Even if you know a lot about the theory of evolution (or think you do), you will probably learn something about it and the reasons it endures as prevailing scientific theory.  The documentary also shows the lengths to which some school board members went to in order to push the theory of intelligent design in the school - and the reaction from the community and faculty.  More importantly, it exposes the real motivation behind the theory of intelligent design - by the actions of the very people who put forth the theory and devised the educational material and their failure to cover their own tracks when changing its name from ""creationism"" to ""intelligent design.""

171971,2,0892216972,"I'm giving this movie two stars (as one star is essentially no stars) because it's a glossy, well-produced production that reflects a lot of work, and does interview actual scientists (however they are represented --- strange that those ""paleontologists who don't support evolution"" who are frequently mentioned aren't actually interviewed here).

One critique I've seen here of negative reviews is that they don't cite specific examples of supposed fraud (or at least misrepresentation), so I shall provide a specific example here. This means ignoring many of the other aspects of the movie that could be criticized, such as the absurd notion that the reason why people think that apes and humans are closely related is because they share the same number of bones in the arms and legs (on this basis one could propose that humans came from lizards). No scientist has ever even suggested the number of arm/leg bones as an important feature linking apes and humans. But I digress.

  So, as my particular example I shall take the way that the movie dealt with bird evolution. (Every other segment could be deconstructed in a similar fashion, but time and space are limited ---- although see my comments on whale evolution on the review by ""Creationmom"".)

  This starts off as presenting the fossil Archaeopteryx as the supposed ""missing link"" between birds and dinosaurs.

(Voice off scene): But opponents say that it is `simply a bird'.

Cut to German paleontologist Peter Wellenhofer, implying that he is one of these ""opponents"" (which he is not). Wellenhofer spends several minutes discussing whether the reconstructions of Archaeopteryx should show scales on its head (as often portrayed) or feathers. The lead in here makes it seem like Wellenhofer is disputing the supposed ""reptilian"" nature of Archaeopteryx, but in fact we don't know what question he was actually asked to provoke this commentary (he could just have been about how to present a museum display). Wellenhofer says that he thinks it was more likely feathers than scales (although he notes that this can't be determined for certain), which seems to provide evidence for the ""simply a bird"" notion (as presented in this context). But this issue of head scales is irrelevant (living birds have scales on their legs, after all). Yes, reconstructing Archaeopteryx with a scaly head does make it appear more ""reptile like""; but this is an artistic representation, reflecting the fact that much of its skeleton is indeed reptile-like (specifically dinosaur-like, see comments below), which can't be seen in the reconstruction, nor easily appreciated by non-specialists (but which I shall explain below). Nobody thinks that Archaeopteryx was some transitional form because it supposedly had scales on its head: ----- nobody.

  Cut to stuff about claws on the wings, which I won't deal with here (for saving time/space, but can do so if challenged).

  Then cut to other supposed ""dinosaur-like"" features of Archaeopteryx, such as the teeth and the long tail. The voice over solemnly tells us that these aren't uniquely dinosaur features but are also found in many other vertebrates. Well, yes --- but these aren't the features that specifically link birds to dinosaurs (those reside in details of the skull, wrist, and legs). However, it remains true that no other birds possess both teeth and a long tail, features that characterize less specialized vertebrates (i.e., in the bird direction of specialization). Some Cretaceous birds retain teeth, but all other birds have/had the short tail (pygostyle), and all post Cretaceous (and modern) birds have a beak without teeth. So, if Archaeopteryx is ""just a specialized bird"" its certainly unique in its combination of (""reptilian"") features that are seen in no other known bird ---- but this is just what you'd expect of a proto-bird that didn't yet have all the features of later birds. Not to mention that it's found earlier in the fossil record than other birds, as you'd expect for a transitional form (not mentioned in the movie).

  Finally, the voice over says that, arranged in a bird-like pose, the skeleton of Archaeopteryx looks like that of a modern bird. This is simply untrue. Here are some major differences: The skull retains the two holes behind the orbit that are lost (actually, merged with the larger orbit) in other birds; the neck is shorter than in other birds, and the neck vertebrae retain ribs; the arms, while bearing flight feathers, are like those of a dinosaur, not fused up into the stiff structures (i.e., the carpometacarpus) of later birds; the ribs are simple (not interlocking), and the trunk long, unlike later birds (i.e., it lacks the stiff, boxy body of most birds); the pelvis is like a dinosaur, not all fused up (into a ""synsacrum"") and fused to the vertebral column, as in almost all other birds (a couple of Cretaceous forms being the exception here); the fifth toe is not projected backwards (the ""reversed hallux"") as in all other birds. And these are just the obvious differences (that represent the lack of the unique features that characterize birds, but are not seen in other animals) that I know as a general paleontologist (in this context) rather than as a dinosaur/bird specialist. No wonder that one of the known specimens of Archaeopteryx was classified as a dinosaur for many years until John Ostrom spotted the faint imprint of feathers in the surrounding rock --- without the feathers this animal looks just like a little dinosaur.

  ""Simply a bird""? Misunderstanding or fraud on the part of the producers of this movie? Hey, as they say in the movie, ""You decide"".",1291852800,16,5643,5.0592672413793105
171972,5,0892216972,"EVOLUTION: A GRAND documentary:
Review by Danzil Monk

Produced by Dr. Carl Werner and Debbie Werner, Written by Carla Azzara and Carl Werner and narrated by Andres Williams, as an examination of the popular ideas about evolution. The filming took place over a period of twelve years and the quality of this first in a series of documentaries was well worth the wait. Professionally and intelligently put together this documentary is another embarrassment to evolutionist and their reaction speaks volumes.

The Documentary begins by giving a brief but revealing history of ""majority view science"" that was proven to be wrong. It points out that the law of ""Spontaneous Generation"", the ""Acquired Characteristics law"", the ""law of Use"" and the ""Law of Disuse"" (which Darwin believed and which was falsified by August Weismann), were all proven to be incorrect.

Spontaneous Generation while held by the vast majority of scientist was proven false by Francesco Redi and Louis Pasteur. The narrator pointed out that we could learn from the failures of the past.... And that all scientific theories and laws should be open to scrutiny, even evolution"", and he is right.
Early on in the program two evolutionist scientist are shown acknowledging that scientist (including evolutionist scientist) are prone to bias and holding on to old idea.

Dr. Monroe Strickberger states ""Scientist are just as much prone to holding on the old ideas as anyone else."" Dr. Kevin Padian says, ""It comes down to what you bring to the questions to begin with. If you don't want to see things, you're not going to see them, and we're all guilty of not wanting to see certain things"".
The narrator quite correctly pointed out that even though the laws of use and disuse were proven wrong, they are still being incorporated into evolutionary explanations today. Darwin's view of ""Adaptation"" is way over extended as a viable proof of evolution. Lizards can't grow fur when they are placed in a cold environment for many generations. Thus direct adaptation is an out dated view that many are trying to distance themselves from. Yet in the program an evolutionist professor is shown attempting to explain how some form of direct adaptation can occur as a result of DNA getting signals from outside and those signals are being translated through stress in the body.

FISH
While fish fossils are by far the most abundant among the many forms of available fossils there are no transitional forms to be found among them. Dr. John Long of the Museum Victoria of Australia acknowledges that the abundance of fish fossils has not given us any answers as to where the first jawed fish came from. He acknowledges that there is still much debate among paleontologist over the origin and interrelationships of the major groups of fishes. They don't know where the bone fish came from.
The Narrator points out that every fish family appears in the fossil record suddenly.

BATS
Dr. Gunter Viohl, Curator of the Jura Museum in Germany, Dr. Nicholas Czeplewski of the Oklahoma Museum of Science and Natural History, Dr. Joerg Habersetzer of the Senckenberg Museum of Natural History in Germany and Dr. Gary Morgan of the Museum of Natural History of New Mexico (all evolutionist) are seen admitting that evolutionist have no evidence to support bat evolution.
The documentary addressed Darwin's view of Natural Selection and also Neo-Darwinism and why they cannot be used as proof of evolution. And also addressed is Darwin's dependence on fossils for his theory of evolution while at the same time acknowledging that the available fossils of his day were not sufficient to prove evolution because there was not enough verity of fossils available back then. Yet today with the abundant fossil record that we have (over 200 million worldwide), there is still no evidence supporting evolution.

It addresses the ""Similarities theory"" and easily showed why similarity does not prove evolution.
Dr. Annalisa Berta of the University of San Diego and Dr. Irina Koretsky, of Howard University acknowledge that Seals and Sea Lions while looking very similar are from different families of mammals and have no know transitional forms identifying their ancestors.

The Australian Mole and the African Mole are considered by evolutionist to be unrelated even though they are strikingly similar.  Sharks and Dolphins while similar in appearance are not from the same family; one is a mammal and the other a fish. The Australian Marsupial Mouse and the North American Mouse look the same and yet are considered unrelated by evolutionist.

DINOSAURS
Dr. Paul Sereno, Paleontologist at the University of Chicago, Dr. Angela Milner, London NH Museum and Dr. David Weishampel, Paleontologist at Johns Hopkins University are all shown giving statements that dinosaur transitional forms are admittedly missing. The narrator also notes that many museums like the Chicago Field Museum even mislead visitors by showing charts with various dinosaurs linked together as if they had proof of common ancestry when in fact there is no fossil evidence.

WHALES
The Whale evolution that is often touted by evolutionist as the best evidence for evolution is intelligently refuted in the documentary by showing the lack of unity in the various evolutionist views concerning whale evolution and by pointing out the weak arguments for so called transitional forms that they so heavily rely on.
Dr. Annalisa Berta, San Diego State University for instance is shown claiming that there are fossil whale specimens that show us intermediates in the evolution of whales and that they actually had feet and walked on land. Dr. Kevin Padian touted the whale transitional display at the University of Michigan's Natural History Museum and where such supposed transitional fossils as Ambulocetus is displayed with a list of other supposed transitional form as evidence of the whale evolution. But they are not hard physical fossils but rather an artist's rendition of what they think they would look like. It also show evolutionist like Dr. Phil Gingerich admitting that Ambolocetus may not belong in the main line of the whale family.
Rodhocetus is claimed to be a great example of a whale transitional fossil by Dr. Annalisa Berta and Dr. Taseer Hussain. But the discrepancy between the Museum drawings of Rodhocetus and the actual fossils is carefully pointed out by the film which even shows Dr. Phil Gingerich who was responsible for the discovery and reconstruction of Rodhocetus, being questioned about his choice to add a fluke when there was no hint of on the actual fossil. In the footage Dr. Gingerich admits that he ""speculated it might have had a fluke."" He is also show acknowledging that since then they have found the forelimbs, the hands, and the front arms and shows convincingly that Rodhocetus did not have a fluked tail. Yet you can still find Rodhocetus in museums with the fluke on it. The film explains that the only real evidence for the whale transitions seems to be the artist drawings but the actual fossil record does not support any transitional evidence.

BIRDS
Since there is no transitional evidence available that explains how dinosaurs got here, evolutionist have been forced to find an explanation for their existence and their ""disappearance"". The documentary explains how evolutionists have turned to the bird family for help to unravel the dinosaur mystery. According to the evolutionist, birds are the descendents of dinosaurs. In the documentary, Dr. Gunter Viohl is shown haling Archaeopteryx as evidence of dinosaur to bird evolution. Yet Dr. Peter Wellnhofer, Bavarian State Collection of Paleontology, Munich, points out that the museum models that include dinosaur scales on the head are hypothetical and speculative. He also expressed his doubt that scales were present on Archaeopteryx. Other evidence was presented to refute the dinosaur connection to Archaeopteryx. Additionally, the false and misleading tendencies of museums to present a dinosaur connection to birds by using misleading tactics such as adding feathers to dinosaur sculptures is strongly objected to by evolutionist Dr. Storrs Olson of the Smithsonian Institute in an open letter to Dr. Peter Raven, Secretary of National Geographic Society Washington DC, calling it, propaganda, hype, wishful thinking, Melodramatic, nonsense, spurious, fantasia and a hoax.
He further states:
""The idea of feathered dinosaurs and the theropod origin of birds is being actively promulgated by a cadre of zealous scientists acting in concert with certain editors at Nature and National Geographic who themselves have become outspoken and highly biased proselytizers of the faith. Truth and careful scientific weighing of evidence have been among the first casualties in their program, which is now fast becoming one of the grander scientific hoaxes of our age.""

A Liaoning Fossils of China (Confuciusornis) was examined by Dr. Timothy Rowe, an evolutionist Paleontologist at the University of Texas (CAT scan laboratory). Dr. Rowe states that he thought that the way he received the specimen was how it came out of the ground, but after scanning it he realized that it had been doctored. Another such fossil (Archaeoraptor), was brought to Dr. Rowe by a scientist from the National Geographic Magazine. But when scanned it was discovered that it too was a fake made up of some 26 fossil bones from five animals including Dinosaurs and birds. In spite of Dr. Rowe's informing the National Geographic Magazine about the forgery they still soon after held a press conference in which they announced the discovery of Archaeoraptor with no reference to the discovered fraud. Three months after Dr. Rowes exposure of the fraud to NGM they still published its story on Archaeoraptor claiming that it was a ""flying dinosaur"" a ""missing link"" and the best evidence that birds evolved from dinosaurs.

In addition to the professionalism and intelligence that the documentary displays, the embarrassing comments and underhanded attempts at deception on the part of some of the evolutionist scientist or science institutions is no doubt what has the evolutionist community up in arms about this film. It should be noted that it was an evolutionist who exposed the National Geographic fossil hoax in the documentary. It was also an evolutionist who wrote the open letter addressing the dishonesty of Nature and National Geographic. And finally, while viewing the film, there is no apparent indication that any of the featured scientists were being forced or tricked into making their comments. What is apparent is that they assumed that their comments would be accepted without scrutiny or exposure to a counter opinion. It seems that when the playing field has been leveled for both perspectives to be honestly presented, many evolutionist become extremely agitated and hostile. Since the facts do speak for themselves when they are truthfully presented, evolutionist should be concerned when a documentary such as this is made available to the public. I highly recommend this excellent film.",1291420800,12,11097,5.199105145413871
171973,5,0892216972,"Dr. Carl Werner has done an amazing job of presenting the opportunity to sift through evidence in a matter calculated to help the viewer think.  A geologist himself, he examines the fossil record for evidences of transitional forms.  He then interviews scientists who are know for their expertise in their particular fields.  I've heard that these scientists are now upset---but does that change the fact that each of them indicated that, despite the wealth of fossils uncovered in the past 150 years, the transitional forms are either ""shrouded in mystery"" or""not yet discovered?""  The only thing unbalanced in his presentation is that there is only one well known creationist scientist cited, compared to the plethora of scientists who support evolution.

Dr Werner then applies the science of probability to just a few changes that would have to take place for a hyena to turn into a whale (really? that is one of 3 proposed evolutionary pathways???), just to make the proteins that would need to be involved in the changes  (1/1,149 followed by 1,577 zeroes).

The truth is that no human was there for the origin of matter, so noone can actually say with certainty what happened as in scientific experiments, because  the original state of nothingness cannot be replicated.  But, I consider Dr. Werner's book and dvd to be much more unbiased than the textbooks, such as Prentice-Hall Science Explorer, which, when it discusses the formation of the first amino acids in the primordial soup, just presents it, without discussing the problems of the amino acids couldn't form out of the water with oxygen (oxidation), without oxygen (no ozone layer, destroyed immediately), can't form in water because of hydrolysis,plus all of the amino acids must be left handed, and in a solution left unattended the solution goes to equilibrium of left and right handed amino acids, which does not produce life.

171978,5,0892216972,"This DVD is beautifully made and professionally produced; rivaling anything you might see on NOVA or PBS.  Without referring at all to religion or special creation, it gives a totally unbiased review of fossils and contains interviews with several proponents of evolution and only one scientist who says he ""just doesn't see it.""  If the DVD is weighted at all, it gives evolutionists the most opportunity to speak their case.  Nevertheless, they end up discrediting their own science and fossils.

I just viewed the video again, transcribing some of the interviews.  The questions are straightforward and the answers are not edited to twist the words of the scientists.  Besides, these are brilliant men and women who are too wise for all of them to allow themselves to be duped into discrediting their own science.

Let me give you just one example, of many, that you can view on the DVD:

The video was filmed on location at the University of Michigan.  The diagram and fossils shown are in their museum and the scientists are shown with these displays.  You can tell from what Dr. Berta says that she has not discussed Dr. Gingerich's findings with him.  She says, ""Just in the last five or ten years, we've had some remarkable discoveries...There have been discoveries that have indicated that fossil whales had feet and actually walked on the land.""  Later on in the video, she describes Rodhocetus, ""This animal had large tail vertebrae and there was lots of room for muscle attachment.""  The narrator says, ""Dr. Phil Gingerich, the scientist responsible for the discovery and reconstruction of Rodhocetus, was questioned how he knew there was a whale fluke on Rodhocetus, since that part of the fossil was missing.""  Dr. Gingerich answers, ""Well, I told you we don't have the tail in Rodhocetus. So, we don't know for sure whether it had a ball vertebrae indicating a fluke or not.  So, I speculated it might have had a fluke.""  Dr. Gingerich also acknowledged that the flippers were drawn on the diagram without these fossils.  Now, he does not believe that this animal had flippers.

Speaking about when the diagram was drawn for the museum, indicating a fluke and flippers, Dr. Gingerich says, ""Since then, we've found the forelimbs....the arms, in other words, of Rodhocetus, and we understand that it doesn't have the kind of arms that can be spread out like flippers are on a whale....If you don't have flippers, I don't think you can have a fluked tail and really powered swimming.  So, I now doubt that Rodhocetus would have had a fluked tail.""

With Rodhocetus being the evolutionists' best hope for a transition of land mammals to aquatic mammal, and now having its own discoverer discrediting its fluke and flippers, and taking it off of the main line of whales, the entire line of whale evolution falls apart.  But, in spite of the lack of evidence for that evolution, UofM still has the diagram showing Rodhocetus with its fluke and flippers, on display in its museum.

BUY THE DVD.  It's a good use of your money to see for yourself the complete lack of evidence there is for biological evolution....it's proponents say so!!  I highly recommend it.",1291075200,24,3170,4.860335195530726
171979,5,0892216972,"Our family watched the DVD ""Evolution:The Grand Experiment"" together. The narration and content of the DVD were good.

Examples of the fossil records are discussed in ways that are informative,showing how evolutionary charts can be misleading. In many evolutionary charts, there is  conjecture about the gaps in the fossil record,showing a lack of evidence for many of them.

171981,5,0892216972,"If one subscribes to the Big Bang Theory, one must explain how the matter, which participated in the Big Bang, originated. That is, if matter was pulled together, by gravity, from the far reaches of space, then formed a mass which became unstable and then the ""Big Bang"" occurred, how did the matter form in the first place?

Dr. Werner explains that three components are required for life - protein, DNA and cell walls with gates. Scientists today cannot create any one of these three from chemicals? How were all three of them simultaneously created in an instant way back when the first form of life spontaneously formed? Further, if this ""miracle"" did occur, in a very hostile environment including methane gas (which may cause the extinction of all forms of life in the future when the Methane Hydrate in the sea enters the atmosphere) how did the single cell, which spontaneously formed, evolve into the numerous cells types which exist in the human body today? Who or what was the grand architect that directed the evolution of the single cell into multiple different cells?

I hold a Doctor of Philosophy degree in Physics. I am a registered professional engineer in electrical engineering and control systems. Each day, I examine the evidence (mostly the lack thereof) presented by mostly uneducated people for the cause of evolution. There is none - only supposition. Each day I also re-examine the evidence for a Divine God, the God of the Bible.

Instead of believing in a myth, I challenge all who believe in evolution to read the Bible. Read and understand the Ten Commandments. I appreciate that if everyone obeyed the Ten Commandments, there would be no man made violence in this world. The Hippies of my generation preached LOVE 40 years ago. The bible preached LOVE starting 2,000 years ago. What a shame people of this world cannot love each other, in the way described in the Bible - a true love that asks nothing in return.

You ask do I practice what I preach? Yes, my love for mankind asks nothing in return. I have helped (and continue to help) over 50,000 African-American children receive a good, college preparatory education, through sacrifice of my time and my finances (no I am not a teacher). Those of you who believe in evolution, match my education; match my open mindedness; match my love for my fellow man; show an open mindedness as Dr. Werner had when he set out to prove evolution; study the Bible with the intent to tear it apart; you like so many before you will realize the true source of life; the true source of love in the Universe.

Anyone out there who believes in evolution up to the challenge? I thought not - it would require you to have an open mind and use your brain. It would require you to love unconditionally by helping many others without receiving anything in return.",1291075200,19,2825,4.7105263157894735

Even when he saw serious flaws in the theory, he did not lie about his intentions to anyone he interviewed. His stance was assumed to be pro-evolution.

What this program does so elegantly without any reference to creationism, or biblical ideas is highlight from many respected evolutionary scientists the ""missing Links"" in the evolutionary hypotheses. No doubt charges of selective editing and deception will pour forth from those who will not engage with the actual scientific issues the program raises.

One recognisable creationist is interviewed during the program (Dr. Duane Gish) amongst a disproportionately large number of evolutionary scientists. What make this production invaluable then, is recording the candid responses from those within the scientific community, who probably would not have been as forth-coming had they realised their comments would have created such a stir, but this is good for science.

Errors must be exposed to forward our scientific understanding and the implications wherever they may lead should be embraced. The logical implications it would appear are the biggest source of contention, not the actual data.

We now have vast collections of fossils, but the transitional forms are still absent. It looks at fish, bats, seals and pterosaurs which are all fully formed in the fossil record, there are no transitional forms. The program discusses archaeopteryx, which may be a transitional form. Then it looks at the so called evolution of the whale, which included one example of extrapolation of data (the Rhodocetus fraud).

I thought the book to be a good resource and coffee table item.  The author puts things in simple terms and boils some complex arguments down to their more simplistic cores in order to make them readable to the average person.  However this does not mean that the book lacks a scientific foundation.  Far from it.  Carl Werner has done an admirable job in trying to tackle a touchy subject with delicacy.  Some of the information found in this book is astounding in its importance, and incriminating to some well-known magazines (like National Geographic).

Well worth getting and browsing through.

7793346,5,0892216972,"Darwin saw through a closed mind a way to get as far from God as he could. Where he saw variation in species, he said :""oh boy"" and with the help of another devout closed mind perpetrated a lie that there is no God, that all things happen naturally. Variations in birds, for instance, are adaptations (they are still birds (OT kinds). The supposed Trees are just stumps with imaginary blips (from ""hopeful monster"" minds. And something from nothing? Even my 16 year old granddaughter can see through that one.",1525305600,,509,4.666666666666667

7793348,2,0892216972,"Meh.  Better to invest in The Intelligent Design Collection plus Icons of Evolution by Illustra Media.  My frustrations with this include basing a large portion of their ""evidence"" on the lack of pre-existing ancestors for various animals i.e. argument from silence which is a good observation but not in anyway a ""contradiction"" (a term they use wrongly most of the time), saying that evolutionists believe humans evolved from apes (not true, they believe in common descent i.e. sharing a common ancestor), saying that adapted traits cannot be passed on because the law of use/disuse is fallacious (while this is true in a Lamarckian sense adaptive traits can be linked to genetics, e.g. they omit any mention of Mexican cave fish, something the average person mildly interested in science would be sure to ask about).  On the positive side they rightly highlight the need to be skeptical about museum graphics and their many distortions especially here is a nice discussion about whale evolution which was good (though that clip can be found on youtube searching ""Whale Evolution vs. The Actual Fossil Evidence,"" so no need to buy the DVD just for that).  Aesthetic issues are also present from the fuzzy font to the awkward looking people interviewed, to sound and lighting issues at various points.  So, meh, not anything I would want to show to my church or teen group when there are so many other resources with higher production value and more solid content.",1519257600,,1465,4.987704918032787

7793354,5,0892216972,"Dr. Werner uses plain logic to ask very straightforward questions throughout these films.  His goal doesn't seem to be to supplant evolution with another formalized theory on the origin of life, he simply wants to know if it's actually true that living creatures transformed fantastically over time as the theory of evolution proposes.

I personally related to this because I'm not a strong supporter of any particular belief regarding what physically happened millions of years before I was alive.  If possible I'd just like to know the truth, and I hope you do too.  The filmmakers are to be commended for making such a solid contribution to this discussion.",1459814400,2,660,5.027522935779817
