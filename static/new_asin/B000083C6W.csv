Watching this show is like watching The Simpsons but with everything but the humor changed: characters, settings, jokes, etc.  I love it!  The first episode I saw didn't really impress me but the 2nd through whatevereth episodes I saw were more than enough for me to love it.
I've got the first two seasons of The Simpsons on DVD, and I'm still eagerly awaiting the first season of The Family Guy on dvd in Region 1.",1040342400,2,515,4.23469387755102

There is no Play All function and it does not even guide you to the next episode. Every single episode has it's OWN menu and you have to hunt through that to get each to play. A minimum of 5 clicks and 3 screens to get to your next episode. Unwatchable in this format. It seems Volume 2 also suffers this fault. Volume 3 does have Play All and you can just enjoy from 3 after I think. Also these are NOT Seasons 1-5, they are Volumes. Not sure what that means but for sure, Volume 5 is all episodes from season 7 and after. Very confusing presentation all in all.

1824400,5,B000083C6W,"5 stars for content, 0 stars for the packaging. I ordered volumes 1-4 and feel it was a sound purchase, but be prepared to buy extra cases to hold your discs. The packaging these came in is very poor and will best serve as something colorful for your shelf. I wouldn't trust keeping the discs in the sleeves provided for very long, and plan to look into bulk dvd cases to keep them in.

As for the show itself, if you're familiar with the series you can't really go wrong here. It's been a blast seeing all these episodes again, and I highly recommend it for fans. Check out volume 1-4 (they're complete seasons and some of the most classic moments from the series)",1446595200,2,665,4.362903225806452
1824401,5,B000083C6W,Love Futurama. they arrived in good condition. What's not to love??,1438732800,,67,5.181818181818182
1824402,5,B000083C6W,"The first season of Futurama is brilliant. The stories are funny, the writing sharp, the situations surreal, and the satire very edgy. While the series is new, the mannerisms are coming together quickly (except maybe for Bender's voice, which sounds a bit more flemmy than it does later on - but that's not a big deal). Groening and team have done this once before, with the Simpsons, so things move quicker and fuller. We hear the evolution of Farnsworth's ""good news, everyone"" catchphrase, and catch glimpses of our future (like the time a supervillain was voted into the US presidency, some time in the 27th century) as Leela and the gang explain their world to Fry; similarly, Fry explains his world to the people of the future in wry and ironic ways. Nice.

The first episode is probably the best, as it shows Fry's fall into the cryogenic freezing unit, and an amazing 1:42 sequence shows a ""time lapse"" of what goes on over 1,000 years (including a possible reference to the Tripods world). There's Fry's first meeting with Leela, Bender (in a queue for the Suicide Booth - brilliant idea from day one), and their meeting with Farnsworth. There's a bit of stuff about can't-change-your-destiny career chips for centrally-planned fate allocation, which is sort of phased out of the series eventually - but hey, what's a future without a bit of The Giver-like dystopian fascism? We get our first ""head"" in the form of Leonard Nimoy (an obvious choice, of course - RIP), closely followed by Matt Groening's own, and the first of thousands of random heads (Barbra Streisand, Dennis Rodman, David Duchovny...), Leela's foray with Zapp in the amazing fourth episode (introducing Zapp and Kiff, Nibbler, dark matter engines, and Vergon 6); there's a bit of banking in episode 6, when Fry discovers that interest gained on his puny bank account over 1,000 years has made him a billionaire; Bender's descent into sobriety, his encounter with his old buddy Fender (a roadie/stage amp-bot, of course) and some bad addiction, born-again robotology, the planet of the Nibblers, the planet of the Killbots, Blernsball, Benderific good times, the introduction of Mom (meh!), odd moments with Scruffy the janitor, the Beastie Boys (heads, rolled onstage by Scruffy), the smell-o-scope and the garbage asteroid (with its pile of Bart ""eat my shorts"" Simpson dolls - ""okay, I will! Mmmmm... shorts.""). The introduction of Nerdstrom, the reverse scuba suit (for fish to walk on land), Bender's first encounter with the Robot Devil (Beelzebot?) and the gold fiddle stuff, the voyage of the New Titanic (with a nice use for Leonardo Dicaprio's head) and a strange scenario when both Leela and Amy are using Fry as their beard, a weird Animal House take-off with Gnther the monkey, attack of the Omichronians, the real secret behind Slurm (in the form of a Charlie And The Chocolate Factory ripoff), and much, much more!

Happily, this disc is probably filled with more bonus features than any of the others. There's the animatic from ""Space Pilot 3000"", the script with notes from David X Cohen, from 5/31/1998 on 98 slides!! There's also bonus stuff amounting to 338 panels of 3-column notes - good luck getting through it all, meatbags!! Then there's some ""Space Pilot 3000"" storyboards and the pilot episode commentary, where they explain that they changed the play a lot from early scripts, as they had two hours of material for the pilot! Fox was alarmed by the show. JFK Jr died around this time, so they had to change one of their jokes. One Simpsons reference - Blinky the three-eyed fish. Hard to audition a robot in Hollywood - considered David Duchovney (I think they were joking, though). ""Favorite suicide booth since 2008."" Robosexuals. Sadly, there's no interesting commentary on the idea for the heads in jars. When it gets to Nixon's head, Groening notes that ""I was so mad at Nixon as a kid growing up, he was just such a jerk. To be able to - if I could have known back then that in 1999 I could still get to make fun of him - AH!! It would have cheered me up."" ""Aw c'mon, he's just a poor kid from the stupid ages!"" The best comic/animated characters are identifiable in silhouette, notes Groening. Fry has same costume as James Dean in Rebel Without A Cause. They had more funny stuff on Dick Clark for his voice acting segment, including the heads of Sha-Na-Na - he didn't know what he was reading it for, but he was a good sport about it. The Planet Express ship itself has an overbite. David and Matt paid for the 30th-Century Fox logo out of their own pocket but Fox was embarrassed by this and covered it in the end. The killimajig. Probulator. Beelzebot. Fleshwad, meatbag, skinsack. ""The story of the grasshopper and the octopus..."". To solve the situation of everyone always making the same bad joke, Uranus was renamed Urectum!!

""The Series Has Landed"" deleted scenes (1:19) with a gopher scene, and the closing scene. ""I, Roomate"" deleted scene (0:55). ""Fry, of all my friends, you're the first."" ""Love's Labour Lost In Space"" deleted scenes (0:37), Corpsatron ""Love is all around."" There's a deleted scene from ""My Three Suns""  (0:52), ""Hell is other robots"" deleted scene (0:44) is a new, slightly better final scene. Sincerity simulator featurette (4:53). ""Strange twists that you'd reverse in the Simpsons. Aliens, bizarre creatures. Can be a year between ideas and final product, table reading with 100 people, 3-D models. ""When Aliens Attack"" deleted scene (0:31) The image gallery of 65 images is just full of amazing early concept sketches by Matt Groening and others of the main characters ()and some unused characters) taking shape. Lovely!!",1437177600,,5670,4.878630705394191

WHILE ADD/ADHD WERE CURED QUITE EFFECTIVELY 50 YEARS AGO VIA PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION, IT'S PAINFULLY OBVIOUS NOT EVERYONE GOT IN ON THE CURE. TO ME, THERE IS GREAT JOY IN POPPING A SEASON 3 OR LATER DISC, WATCHING EVERY EPISODE WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH THE TEDIOUS TASK OF MANIPULATING A DVD REMOTE CONTROL EVERY 22-23 MINUTES. FOR ME, THE SOLUTION WAS BUYING THE FIRST TWO SEASONS ON AMAZON PRIME, SINCE I'VE HAD A LAPTOP CONNECTED TO MY 52 WIDESCREEN FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW; HOWEVER, NOT EVERYONE CAN AFFORD THE COST OF AMAZON PRIME.

1824423,1,B000083C6W,"Futurama itself was a decent animated show in the first couple of seasons and then like Simpsons just became unfunny. Anyways I bought this DVD because I was interested in behind the scenes featurette but it turned out to be a 4 minute quick look at how they drew the characters. Really not much there at all, and nothing about the voice cast. One deleted scene is included on Disc 3. I'm really disappointed at the lack of bonus content.

What's more, the discs are packaged in such a way that the media side got dirty after they packaged it, so two of my discs were unplayable and the last one I think is damaged. I'll need to ask for an exchange. I'm really annoyed.",1420761600,,669,4.352

1824434,5,B000083C6W,"Futurama is an animated comedy from Matt Groening, the creator of 'The Simpsons'.  The Simpsons often cracked us up with social satire, but Futurama turned the Simpsons' reality-based sandbox into a completely free and open playground of the future for the writers' minds to run free.

Set in the year 3000, the main character Fry is a dimwit with heart.  He is from our time, and when an accident gets him cryogenically frozen for 1,000 years, we get to see Groening's bizarre future through his eyes.  He voices our 20th-century opinions, and he sets up some of the best jokes in the series.  Fry meets a lot of unusual people, and the core stable of characters that are introduced to us will have you and your friends regularly debating the merits of your favorites.

When Futurama first aired on Fox, it got a weird mix of 'show it to everybody' airings of each week's episode across multiple time slots...and also got Fox's 'try to kill it' treatment of randomly moving the new episodes.  Somehow, it managed to survive, and if you watch this first season, you can see why Futurama wasn't just ""Simpsons in Space"", but was instead a huge green field for these clever writers to play upon.  Drawing on the entire history of science fiction, Futurama satirizes our modern-day society with ease.  We have an opening episode featuring suicide booths, an alcoholic robot with a criminal mind, an everyday New New York City (yes, I typed that correctly) whose definition of 'normal' boggles the 20th-century mind, and hilarious series of laugh after laugh.

I own this particular box set, and I really enjoy the fact that I get director's commentary--but if you're contemplating buying the entire series, you might want to look into the collected versions:  they don't appear to leave anything out and they might have even a bit more to offer than this collection.  Either way, Futurama is one of my favorite shows of all time.",1404950400,,1926,4.803030303030303
1824435,5,B000083C6W,"Futurama is one of my all time favorites, it's always a good laugh. So unless you have no sense of humor you'll enjoy this. I'm not typically an adult who likes cartoons like this or South Park etc. but this show is great. My only complaint about this actual DVD set is the shows don't play in a row, one show plays then it goes back to the main menu and you have to scroll down and restart the next show.

The tv's drawn are still the tvs that 99% of america had then, tube tv's, other faucets to of the show reflect the era. The show is really for the time is was made anyway, which is why heads of 'hanson' singing in a park would be quite in sync with that year. Of course , not so much for the year 3,000 but who cares? The show is really finding it's way during this season, it introduces most the characters and basic ideas that they will later really turn into cartoon gold. But in this season , some of the voices sound a little different than they would later, the professor and bender have yet to be as fully formed vocally yet. But then you had one guy doing both voices I believe and he like the show grew quickly.  What's good about the rebirth of this show later is that already the first four seasons are by now quite a few years in the past! The animation is good of course and it only got better as the people drawing it got used the characters. The show is a good one to own or just watch, and sure the later episodes get better , but this is the start of a cool comedy cartoon.

1824508,5,B000083C6W,"I remember in December of 1999 when everyone was excited and scared for the new millennium and y2k and all that jazz, I was watching fox and they said a new cartoon show called Futurama was premiering, I love cartoons so I decided to watch it.  It begins in December 31st 1999 in New York with a guy named Fry who is pretty much a loser, no friends, a lame job, no car, and his girlfriend just left him for someone else.  He is sent to deliver a pizza to a cryogenic lab, but after discovering that it was just a prank, he sits down at a desk to eat the pizza and drink a soda right at midnight when the countdown is starting, as he leans back in the chair he accidentally falls back into a time machine that freezes him for 1000 years.  When he awakes in the year 3000 he realizes he is in another world and that everyone he knows is gone, but it doesn't bother him at all, in fact it excites him.  He meets some interesting people in the year 3000, such as leela, the sexy cyclops alien that tries to force him to implant a chip in his hand, Bender, a alcoholic suicidal kleptomaniac robot who he takes as a friend, and his great great great etc nephew, Professor Farnsworth, whom Fry, Bender, and Leela end up working for as a delivery crew for his business The Planet Express.  Here's an episode list:

1. Space Pilot 3000:  As explained above.

2.  The Series has Landed:  Fry meets some of the other people at Planet Express, such as Dr. Zoidberg, a crazy lobster-like alien who knows absolutely nothing about human anatomy.  Fry gets a chance to deliver a package to the moon, which excites him.  But when he gets there he realizes it has become a giant theme park.  Uninterested in the the theme park, Fry convinces Leela to go out exploring the moon looking for the original moon landing.

3.  I, Roomate:  Fry is forced to find somewhere to live, and decides to move in with his robot friend, Bender.  But he realizes that a robot's apartment is only 3 cubic meters.  Unable to live there, Fry finds them a very nice spacious apartment, which they destroy to make it look like a bachelor pad.  But Bender is forced to leave because his antenna interferes with the TV reception.  Fry chooses to stay which hurts Bender's feelings.  Bender decides to cut off his antenna which at first doesn't bother Fry but later her has a change of heart.  They move back to Bender's apartment and Bender tells him to put something in the closet, when Fry opens the closet door he realizes that the closet is huge enough for Fry to live in, though he is scoffed by Bender for wanted to live in a closet.

4.  Love Labors Lost in Space: Probably my favorite episode of the season, as we are introduced to the Captain Kirk-like Commander, Zapp Branigan, and Nibbler the cute little creature with an insatiable appetite and who excretes dark matter.

5.  Fear of A Bot Planet:  Bender is sick of robots being treated like slaves or second class citizens, so when the crew has to make a delivery to a planet controlled by Robots who kill humans on site, he goes in and doesn't come back and is treated like a king.  But when Fry and Leela come to rescue him, he has to decide to save his friends and return to Earth, or kill them and stay the celebrity that he is.

6.  A Fishful of Dollars:  Fry checks his bank account to see how much money he has, he is informed that it was only 98 cents but after 1000 years interest he now has 4 billion dollars!  Fry, now a rich man, starts spending his money extravagantly buying whatever he wants.  But there is one thing he wants more than anything, anchovies, which are now extinct.  At an auction he sees one container of anchovies for sale, which he has to battle over with Mom, the sweet-seeming(secretly evil) owner of all the robots who wants the anchovies for an evil plot.  Fry wins the anchovies but Mom sends her goons after him to steal all his money, so by the end of the episode he is where he started.

7.  My Three Suns:  The crew travel to a scorching heat desert-like planet where Fry is to deliver a letter, but once he gets to the palace where he was supposed to give the letter, he sees a refreshing bottle of water and decides to drink it.  He then realizes that he drank the emperor and now Fry is the new emperor.

8.  A Big Piece of Garbage: this one is the weakest of the rest in my opinion, not a bad episode, but not as captivating as the rest.  A huge 1000 year old clump of trash is heading towards Earth to destroy it and the Planet Express crew try to stop it.

9.  Hell Is Other Robots:  Another one of my favorites, Bender, while at a concert is peer pressured by a group of other robots into ""jacking on"" or surging electricity into his body, which I guess is a robot's form of getting high.  Bender becomes addicted and starts spending his life jacking on.  A preacher robot tries to teach him the robot gospel but Bender ends up sent to Robot Hell where he meets the Robot Devil, and it's up to Fry and Leela to save him.

This is one of the funniest series out today, and in my opinion much better than the Simpsons, and for those who don't know.  The voice of Fry is none other than Billy West.  Billy also does, Professor Farnsworth, Zoidberg, Zapp Brannigan, among others.  But those who don't know Billy West probably know his voice.  He is also the voice of Stimpy, Doug, Bugs Bunny, and other famous cartoon characters from my childhood, my hat goes off to that man, and to this show.  This show can make you laugh, make you think, and even make you cry.  All the seasons were amazing and I will be reviewing them as well but this season takes the cake.",1308009600,,5629,4.300380228136882

Now, Futurama is not simply another version of The Simpsons -- it is its own thing and carries itself well. A recurring theme is that the more things change, the more they stay the same. It may be a thousand years in the future, with aliens and robots and humand living side by side, but the situations are all too familiar.

1824514,5,B000083C6W,"I remember when Futurama first came on TV. I was about 10 years old, and I didn't really think it looked good. Seemed unappealing compared to The Simpsons, don't quite know why, but I hardly bothered to try watching it at all. I dismissed it as ""bland-looking Simpsons spin-off"" without even watching it and went on my merry way.

Fast forward to about 6 years farther down my merry way, I rediscovered Futurama on Cartoon Network's [adult swim] programming block. I figured I'd give it a try, seeing it on again so much later. It was then I realized that Futurama's an absolutely classic show. Futurama is one of those shows that don't quite attract mainstream appeal like The Simpsons does, but rather find a strong niche audience instead from people who appreciate the beauty in being different.

Futurama is a nail that got hammered because it stuck out. It was different, and FOX didn't like that. Thankfully for us all, [adult swim]'s revitalization of the series was a true rebirth for Futurama, giving it unprecedented fandom; like the legendary phoenix, Futurama shined brightest only until after it was silenced. Futurama is a show that that grows on you if you only give it a chance, much like King of the Hill, which coincidentally is also a cancelled FOX show and is now on [adult swim]'s timeslot that used to belong to Futurama.

Perhaps like a case of beneficial worms that improves your quality of life that you picked up from eating a moldy gas station sandwich, Futurama indeed grows on you, and by the time it's done growing, you'll notice its pillar now towers over those of most, if not all, other shows. Among all entertainment tributes, Futurama is a brilliant flower, and all it needed was a little extra sunlight to bloom into its brilliance.",1232582400,,1768,4.752442996742671
1824515,5,B000083C6W,I bought Futurama vol. 1 for my daughter and she loves this cartoon. Its fun for the kids and adults to watch. This was a great buy and I love shopping at Amazon.,1231372800,,162,3.9393939393939394
1824526,5,B000083C6W,"""Futurama"" was created by Simpsons' guru Matt Groening and writer James X. Cohen; their experience writing for and producing that brilliant animated series obviously came in handy here.  Indeed, ""Futurama"" is one of those rare shows that debuted pretty much fully formed and at peak quality.  In contrast, ""The Simpsons"" evolved quite a bit during its initial seasons, and Season 1 today looks rather antiquated - not so for ""Futurama.""  The 13 episodes that comprise the first season are outstanding.

The show's premise concerns Fry, an aimless pizza delivery man, who is accidentally frozen cryogenically in 1999 and awakens in the year 3000.  He seeks out his only living relative, Professor Farnsworth, an inventor and owner of an interstellar delivery service.  Farnsworth hires Fry to be part of the crew, along with Fry's new friend, the foul-mouthed robot, Bender.  Fry and Bender are well matched and make life difficult for everyone around them, especially the one-eyed captain, Leela.

Episodes during season 1 usually involve the crew making deliveries to various bizarre planets.  The animation even in the first episode is spectacular; it must have been a huge challenge constantly creating new worlds and alien life forms.  Many of the long-time supporting cast members are introduced almost immediately, including Amy Wong, ship's physician Dr. Zoidberg, Hermes, Zapp Brannigan and his side-kick Kif, Nibbler, and Mom.  Highlight episodes include ""Fear of a Bot Planet"" (the crew deliver a package to an all-robot planet), ""A Flight to Remember"" (a clever take-off of Titanic), and ""Love's Labours Lost in Space"" (the crew meet Zapp Brannigan while saving a collapsing planet).

Unlike ""The Simpsons,"" ""Futurama"" seems better suited for an adult audience, which is probably why it was such a smash in reruns on Cartoon Network's nightly Adult Swim block.  I should note that my five-year-old nephew loves the show, especially Leela.  When he visited me, he watched the show and then spent the next several days imitating Leela's karate kicks.  However, I don't think he really understood the plots or the humor of the series.

As with the DVDs for ""The Simpsons,"" all episodes of ""Futurama"" feature a commentary track with various producers, directors, writers, and stars.  Unfortunately, I simply don't enjoy the commentaries here that much.  In particular, I dislike any of the tracks with John DiMaggio, who voices Bender; he can be extremely annoying by interrupting the flow of the conversation and laughing too loudly.  Overall, though, this package is really excellent.",1231200000,,2593,5.280487804878049
1824527,4,B000083C6W,"The DVDs are of pretty good quality and have a reasonable amount of the standard extras, the best of which is the commentary which always feel like the folks behind the show just hanging out.

1824530,5,B000083C6W,"Futurama is awesome! I love the way the writers think in terms of plot. The episodes are good on humor and twisting things and the series itself is actually an EXCELLENT commentary on history and the American society. The only thing I don't like about this series is that after awhile, the constant approach to humor that goes, ""I'm saying one thing, then arbitrarily doing the exact opposite just for the hell of it!"" gets a little old. There are plenty of times where it's quite effective, don't get me wrong, but when it's the main source of humor I get the feeling that they're dealing with writer's block. But, that's a minor point. If you like the Simpsons, if you don't like the Simpsons, who cares--this series is NOTHING like the Simpsons (even though the creator is the same as the one of the Simpsons).

From 'I, Roommate' (featuring the true odd couple) to 'Fry and the Slurm Factory', the comedic genius of the creators is all too evident.  In these few episodes, we meet the major characters (Fry, Bender, Leela, etc) as well as some of the rather unique supporting case (Mom, Zap and ... Wornstrom!).

To a certain set, myself included, the show is even funny than Matt Groening's 'other' show.  Part of the attraction stems from the sci-fi storylines; however, this is amplified by the show's commentary - on our society, pop culture, our very life and times.  In 'A Big Piece of Garbage', a large ball of garbage (created by 20th Century New York) threatens 31st Century New New York.  The final dialogue, with Fry stating that a 2nd ball of garbage wouldn't return for hundreds of years; the Professor's response, that it's ""none of our concern""; and Fry's final statement, ""That's the 20th Century attitude"" may all be somewhat predictable.  Nonetheless, those lines, and the episode in general, are solid gold.  While not my favorite episodes of the entire series, they are nothing short of hilarious.

The packaging is somewhat cheap. I had a little piece of plastic stuck between the outer plastic of the DVD case and the paper. It was probably some leftover from manufacturing, because the case was fine and not broken in any way. Regardless, it permanently blemished the look of the casing, causing little ""pinches"" in the lower paper/plastic of the case, which is a shame considering I had just bought it.

As far as the video goes, I get an odd quirk when I play this on my Mac. I'm not sure if this goes for all DVD players, but the video seems to distort a bit in fast moving scenes, particularly when characters move their mouths to talk. It's odd, because I've never had any problems with any DVDs on my Mac.

That said, it's great to see all of (the current episodes of) Futurama on DVD and it's nice to see they went as far as to include audio in Spanish and other languages (though, of course they're not as good as the original English) as well as subtitles in English, Spanish and other languages, too.

1824569,5,B000083C6W,"When Futurama premiered in 1999, I wasn't very fond of it at first.  Creator Matt Groening, better known as the creator of the Simpsons, had fallen out of favor with me as I noticed the decline in quality of his more popular show season after season.  It's safe to say that I had pre-maturely judged Futurama, which ended up being one of the smartest and funniest animated comedies in recent memory.  Taking place on New Years Eve 1999, pizza delivery boy Philip Fry (voiced by Billy West) finds himself accidently frozen in suspended animation, and thawed out 1,000 years in the future.  After meeting his somewhat brilliant distant grand nephew Professor Farnsworth; Fry gets a job as an interstellar delivery boy, while meeting cohorts like the one-eyed Leela (voiced by Peggy herself, Married...With Children's Katey Sagal) and the Homer-like robot Bender, who is an alcoholic and a cleptomaniac to boot.  Featuring many hilarious sci-fi and fantasy in jokes and pop culture references, Futurama featured intelligent humor devices and a superb voice cast while never taking itself too seriously.  Like the Simpsons, there are plenty of visual gags and opening credits gags as well, making every episode a new experience.  The show would go on for a time longer than many expected on Fox, before meeting it's demise and finding new life as re-runs on Cartoon Network's latenight Adult Swim lineup.  And like Family Guy, Futurama is being reborn thanks to Adult Swim ratings and DVD sales, which means that soon enough folks, Fry and co. will be flying high once again.",1174262400,,1571,4.992337164750958
1824570,5,B000083C6W,"The first season of Futurama is great.  It sets the stage for an infinite number of shows.  It's truly a shame that Fox felt this show had no future.  The number of possibile stories for this show are limitless.  The first season barely touches on this as only the core characters are used in this season, but it is obvious from the very first episode that Matt Groening and company had stumbled upon a gold-mine of story potential.

The first season, which is only half a season, is filled with gem episodes that develop the characters.

Space Pilot 3000 - The pilot episode brilliantly develops the premise of the show: Philip Fry gets frozen for 1000 years and finds himself in the year 3000.  This episodes introduces many of the main characters.

Episode Two: The Series has landed - A good follow-up episode to the pilot.  This episode introduces the remaining main characters that weren't introduced in the first episode.

I, Roommate - One of the best episodes of the premier season.  This episode shows how Fry came to live with Bender.  A brilliantly written episode that reveals the true potential for the show.

Love's Labors Lost in Space - A solid episode that introduces a few of the more popular characters in Zapp Brannigan, Kif, and Nibbler.  This episode begins the Leela/Zapp love quarrel.

Fear of a Bot Planet - A very funny episode that is the first to truly show the struggle between robots and humans.  Bender shows his true colors in this episode and the Robot Elders are absolutely hilarious.

A Fishful of Dollars - Another great episode.  While Fry's lack of intelligence has been shown before, this episode puts him in a category of his own.  This episode has a great premise: Fry's bank account from 2000 accumilating interest over 1000 years.

My Three Suns - In my opinion, the weakest episode of this season, but still funny.  Fry finds himself the ruler of a race of liquid people (after he drinks from the sacred bottle).

A Big Piece of Garbage - This episode introduces Professor Farnsworth's smellascope, which will be seen in later episodes.  This episode is funny and truly a stab at people who blow-off the environment.  Very well written and funny.

Hell is other Robots - Now this is how to finish a season.  This episode is my favorite of the first season.  Bender finds addiction, finds religion, finds himself, then finds himself in Robot Hell.  This episode introduces the Robot Devil (Voiced by Dan Castellaneta), one of the more popular side characters of the series.  This episode is worth the price of the whole season.

This season is a great introduction for what is yet to come.  Even after watching the later seasons, it is very easy to come back to this season and get a chuckle again and again.",1171324800,,2752,4.694560669456067

1824574,5,B000083C6W,"and that's not hyperbole.

I think that many casual viewers do not understand how DELIBERATE this series is. For instance, you know how if you take Homer Simpson from Season One of The Simpsons and compare him to the current season, you will note a radical change? There are T-shirts which mark this ""evolution"" of Homer (maybe even with Groening's approval). Many animated series suffer this inconsistency . . . and improvements arrive with better budgets. BUT, you do not see this in Futurama . . . the production is thoroughly consistent! When you listen to the director commentary on Episode One: Space Pilot 3000, you will understand that this show had a great budget and extraordinary planning. Much like the new NBC smash-hit Heroes, Futurama had years of script already written before the show even aired. You realize the implications of this when you see Nibbler silhouetted in THE FIRST EPISODE as Fry's chair tips into the Cryogenic chamber! (And, if you have seen the whole series, you know why!)

The popular culture allusions, the literary allusions, the political allusions: all are a treat for the sophisticated of mind. Nonetheless, it must be noted that this is one of the few series where the audience genuinely relates to the main character. For instance, Homer Simpson is certainly likable, but his ignorance distances the audience. This is even more extreme with McFarlane's Peter Griffin. The audience enjoys him, but we certainly do not relate. Fry, well Fry is like our very best friend in the world. His pursuit of Leela is painful and endearing (how often do we see that in an animated show?!) Fry's charm is undeniable.

In this Season, ""A Fishful of Dollars"" and ""My Three Suns"" are my favorite. In both, Fry's fallibility surfaces . . . he becomes slightly more complex. In ""Fishful"" we are gifted a great guest-star: Pam Anderson. Her self-deprecation is both funny and welcomed. And in this episode we also learn about Fry's fixation with ""stuffy old songs about the buttocks"";) In ""Suns"" we see Fry cheat his way to becoming Emperor and how the devotion of his friends save him from a painful demise in the Juice-o-Matic 4000. ""In your face, Gorgack!!""

If you are a fan, you MUST listen to the director commentary! You will not believe the respect you gain for this creative team!! And you might discover some phenomenal gem that slipped by you!!

Technical note: yes, this collection does not have a ""Play All"" . . . and that really detracts. BUT, there is no way I would ever discourage anyone from buying this box set. Each disc is in a separate case. Each case lists the episodes and provides a synopsis. In the physical presentation, nothing was spared to create a lovely aesthetic. In sum, it is a MUST HAVE for any lover of animation.

1824579,5,B000083C6W,"Out of all the animated television shows that followed The Simpsons (King of the Hill, South Park, Family Guy), Futurama is the best.  The show centers on a pizza delivery boy named Fry (imagine a 20-something Bart Simpson) who gets frozen in a cryogenic center on Dec 31, 1999 and is then thawed out in the year 3000.  Fry then becomes part of an intergalatical UPS-like delivery team--also comprised of an one-eye alien, a rude, thieving robot, and Fry's senile great-great-great-etc. nephew, who happens to be a brilliant though eccentric scientist.

The show is exceptionally funny--especially when imagining what the future may be like.  The dialogue is incredible as well.  Here's a sample exchange.

Fry (trying to purchase clothing in the year 3000):  ""Here's my Visa Card.""

Clerk:  ""Visa hasn't existed in over 400 years.""

Fry:  ""Well, how about my MasterCard?""

Clerk:  ""MasterCard hasn't existed in over 500 years.""

Fry:  ""I have my Discover card.""

Clerk: (Pause)  ""Ooh, I'm sorry, we don't take Discover.""

The show has an exceptional ensemble of characters.  They are not on the level of The Simpsons characters, but they are pretty good.  The two characters that really stick out are the eccentric scientist Professor Farnsworth and the Captain Kirk-like Zapp Brannigan.  The voice work here is pretty good--though not on the level of The Simpsons.

The 1st season includes 13 episodes.  The best are the original pilot, Love's Labours Lost in Space, A Fishful of Dollars, A Big Piece of Garbage, and When Aliens Attack.

1824584,5,B000083C6W,"Matt Groening's creativity cast a wide net even before the Simpsons appeared as minute-long blurbs on the Tracy Ullman Show. He already had a line of retro 'fifties art campy greeting cards and his Life in Hell comic with Binky, the one-eared rabbit, Akbar and Jeff ran in numerous ""underground"" papers. After the Simpsons, he produced imaginative specials (""Olive, the Other Reindeer"") as well as this ground-breaking show for Fox.

Like The Simpsons, Futurama was/ is an equal opportunity offender, which makes its incisive social commentary and friendly barbed humor easy to take. But Futurama, which takes its title from the 'thirties worlds fairs' visions of tomorrow, could not only seed its animated vision by parodying the petty concerns of today, but also by sprinkling in the optimistic promises of tomorrow. At a glance, Futurama would appear as a send-up of the too-virtous space operas of yesteryear. But on closer inspection, it's a parody of everything else.

It's easy to forget the sad state of TV animation before Who Framed Roger Rabbit sent a signal to studio execs that people like cartoons (which everyone else already knew), and began an animation renaissance. The sheer abundance of rich animation available in the late 'nineties alone explains how a show like Futurama could be virtually lost on Fox. As with so many other shows, it found new life and an animation-hungry audience on Cartoon Network, the magnet station for cartoon lovers everywhere. Nothing I can say can add to the achievement that is Futurama, not only the high point of animated shows, but of all late-'nineties TV. Great writing, outstanding character design, wonderful voice actors, animation as fluid as any Disney film: in this show it all came together.

First, like the early episodes of any series, these are often not quite as clever or well-produced as later episodes. ""Fear of a Bot Planet,"" in particular, has a crude, sketchy quality.

And second, as noted by several other reviewers, the menu is awkward. At the end of each episode you get about a minute of black screen, and then you are back at the menu for that episode rather than the main menu for the disc.

It also raised the question: why did FOX cancel this show after only a handful of seasons? And why did they cancel ""Family Guy""? Then the stupid number of reality shows began to emerge and FOX's so-called ""reason"" for cancelling this show and ""Family Guy"" began to surface. The reason for cancelling the shows in favor for reality shows (American Idol and all that other crap) was that FOX felt behind the times and decided to with the ""reality"" trend. BAD MOVE!!! Now that the show ""Family Guy"" has had such a cult following in DVD sales, FOX has ""miraculously"" revived the show. But, chances are ""Futurama"" is not returning to FOX anytime soon, which pisses me off so bad because it was on for such a short while. Anyway here's the story about the show and characters. Spoiler warning: Plot and/or ending details follow.

The series begins with Philip J. Fry, a New York City slacker who is cryogenically frozen by accident on New Year's Eve, 1999. He is defrosted one thousand years later on December 31, 2999 and finds himself in New New York City. Fry's attempt to escape from his now-mandatory job assignment as a delivery boy ends when he is hired on at Planet Express, a small intergalactic package delivery company run by his distantly descended nephew. The series covers the adventures of Fry and his colleagues as they travel around the universe making deliveries on behalf of Planet Express.

The futuristic time frame allowed the show's writers to be creative with their humour by introducing ideas and events from pulp science fiction of the mid 20th century into the series. As such, the show is as much a testament to the creativity of the writers as it is a story of Fry and his colleagues.

Characters
Philip J. Fry (""Fry"") (Voiced by Billy West) - was ""accidentally"" cryogenically frozen just after New Year, 2000, and thawed out in time to usher in the year 3000. Something of a misfit in the 20th century, he adapted to 31st century life with ease after finding employment outside the field of pizza delivery and taking up residence in Bender's closet at the Robot Arms apartment building. He generally has a lower intelligence than the rest but occasionally has moments of genius. Through a time travel accident, he is his own grandfather.

Turanga Leela (""Leela"") (Katey Sagal) - The ship's captain, and usually the most disciplined member of the Planet Express crew. For most of the series she believed she was an orphaned alien (mainly because she is almost completely human-looking, except for the fact that she only has one eye), and desired to learn of her origins. It was later revealed - in Season 4 - that she is a sewer mutant instead of an alien as previously believed.

Professor Hubert Farnsworth (Billy West) - Fry's great-great-...-great grand-nephew who runs Planet Express. In his 160s, he peers through cokebottle glasses, has bad posture and frequently forgets who or what he was talking about. Farnsworth is a mad scientist whose inventions are of variable usefulness. Has a long-standing rivalry with former student Professor Wernstrom. His catchphrases are ""Good news, everyone!"", and ""Oh, my no.""

Bender Bending Rodriguez (""Bender"") (John DiMaggio) - a foul-mouthed, hard drinking, misanthropic robot (catchphrase: ""Bite my shiny metal ass!"") built in America's heartland - Mexico. He frequently violates the Three Laws of Robotics. The only thing he fears is an industrial-size electric can opener. He also is known to uncontrollably sing folk music when exposed to a magnetic field.

Hermes Conrad (Phil LaMarr) - a Jamaican Bureaucrat with a flair for filing. He is also an Olympic Limbo-er. He manages Planet Express delivery business, and his responsibilities include paying bills, giving out legal waivers, and notifying next of kin. In direct contrast to most stereotypes of Jamaicans, he is an uptight workaholic, a stickler for doing everything according to regulations, and frequently admonishes the staff for not working hard enough. He frequently makes bizarre exclamations, such as ""Sweet manatee of Galilee!"", ""Sweet lion of Zion!"" or ""Sweet gorilla of Manilla!"" The character was originally named ""Dexter"" who did not sport a Jamaican accent; this was changed after the first few episodes were recorded.

Dr. John Zoidberg (Billy West) - a lobster-like alien from planet Decapod 10 who (as a self-proclaimed expert on humans) provides incompetent medical care for the crew. He is strongly disliked by Hermes Conrad and lives below the poverty line. Zoidberg combines features of several sea creatures, scuttling sideways like a crab, producing ink like an octopus or squid, and creating pearls in his digestive tract like oysters. He is often treated as the outcast in the group. Zoidberg is curiously a joke on a few levels. A famous New England sauce is named Lobster Newburg, while Zoidberg himself also exhibits many of the stereotypes of Jewish doctors, including his grammar, his accent, and his sandals.

Amy Wong (Lauren Tom) - an intern at Planet Express (kept around because she shares the professor's blood type) and heir to half of Mars. Her parents, who constantly pester her about the lack of grandchildren, came to own half the planet through a legitimate deal that parodied colonial exploitation of gullible natives. On the show, Amy is known for being somewhat shallow and ditzy, and for her overuse of futuristic 31st century slang. She also tends to dress provocatively, frequently being the person on screen wearing the least clothing. When aggravated, she occasionally starts cursing in Cantonese.

1824624,5,B000083C6W,"""Futurama"" Season 1. I love Futurama. Absolutely love it. There's a lot of hand-wringing about what's better, Futurama, Simpsons, etc., and I will say this - Futurama is far better than the Simpsons have been since Season 7. It's very much a mixed blessing that we'll never get to see Futurama go down the tubes with ridiculous, unfunny plot lines like The Simpsons did.

This might anger a lot of people, but Futurama is actually better than even Family Guy. Family Guy may have brilliant moments, but Futurama has a heart and a soul - Family Guy has cutaways and flashbacks but there's no warmth. Futurama expertly balances genuine emotion with sidesplitting comedy. Futurama is probably my second favorite show of all time, hands down. I love it. It's like somebody with my exact sense of humor wrote this show. ""Let's try and get out through this steam pipe. No good, it's full of steam!"" Oh man.

Anyway, enough of that. This is the first season of Futurama on DVD. First of all, let me say that, unlike Family Guy, I really ejoy the fact that they have commentaries on all of the episodes (take that FG and your 2 commentaries per disc). The commentaries make watching the episodes over and over again a must. In a way, they almost double the number of episodes in the series - the antics of John DiMaggio, Billy West, David X. Cohen, and Maurice LaMarche in particular (Morbo, Horrible Gelatinous Blob, and Lrrr sounds nothing alike) are at times almost as howlingly funny as their onscreen counterparts. By all means, watch *all* the commentaries.

With that said, let's not gloss completely over the negative. Why Futurama is an amazing show, Season 1 is the worst season of Futurama. They haven't quite found the groove yet, in the commentaries or the episodes. The voices aren't as good or as funny as they would come to be. Hermes, Zoidberg, and The Professor are too subdued. Bender's voice is more gravelly and less madcap craziness. The plots aren't as sharp and developed, and the jokes are less sure of themselves. But cheer up! They only pale in comparison to the following seasons of Futurama, which are among the best TV episodes I've ever seen broadcasted on television. No joke.

Without further delay, I'll briefly rate and review the episodes of the first season. If they seem harsh, keep in mind this was the first season, a time of growing pains, the show was still opening into what would become a beautiful crysalis. Anyway:

#1- Space Pilot 3000 - 6/10. Good but not great. A nice way to open the show, but doesn't blow you away. On another note, I never get tired of seeing the construction worker from the ""You gotta do what you gotta do"" poster show up on weird posters through the series.

#2- The Series Has Landed - 5/10. Simply average. This episode doesn't really do anything for me, the show is still laying a lot of groundwork at this point. My favorite line: ""Jackie Gleason wasn't an astronaut. He was using space travel as a metaphor for beating his wife.""

#3- I, Roommate - 6/10 - This episode is a little better than the first. Fry gets kicked out of the Planet Express building and moves in with Bender. Wackiness ensues as they search for an ideal place to live (not in New Jersey). You feel the show take a big step towards what it would become.

#4- Love's Labours Lost In Space - 9/10 - Now you're talking! Introduces characters like the hilarious Zapp Brannigan and Kif Kroker. These two are great. ""And what's the name of the law, Kif?"" ""*Sigh. Brannigan's Law."" This is one of my favorite episodes of Season 1. The commentary is good too.

#5- Fear of A Bot Planet - 4/10 - And back down we go. This episode has an interesting premise, but Bender being nastier than usual, and not in a funny way, kind of hurts it a little, besides the fact that the jokes are somewhat weak.

#6- A Fishful Of Dollars - 6/10 - Fry's bank account has drawn a lot of interest in a thousand years, so with his newfound riches, he wants to buy anchovies. Okay, I didn't describe it in the most glowing terms, a number of people really like this episode, I'm not one of them.

#7- My Three Suns - 7/10 - Fry becomes emperor of a desert planet. It's funny, but it could have been a lot funnier.

#8- A Big Piece of Garbage - 2/10 - Probably in my bottom 5 of Futurama episodes. There is very little to like about this episode at all. The title fits.

#9 - Hell Is Other Robots - 7/10 - This episode has been called one of the best by some people, I like it as well, but not as much as others, again. Bender undergoes a voyage of self-discovery that takes him from seedy dens of electrical vice (jacking on), through religious renewal, and finally to the depths of hell itself. Luckily he has good friends to help him out.
#10- A Flight To Remember - 9/10 - Equally touching drama, epic space-fantasty, and hilarious parody, Futurama does a great job with its send-up of Titanic, and as always, it's great to have the Zapper and Kif back. While it has some dynamite lines (Brannigan's ""learning disability"") it also has some touching moments - Fry and Leela, standing together, lonely yet not alone, admiring a far-off nebula as untouchable as Leela must seem to Fry, and Bender's love for a robot above his own station in life. This is a great episode that has a little bit of everything.

#11- Mars University - 7/10 - A number of threads revolving around the title university take center stage in Futurama's sendup of the classic movie ""Animal House."" The talking monkey, Guenter, is endearing and comical, and as always there are plenty of laughs (Fry's spit-take from a glass of punch that appears out of nowhere) but after the near-perfection of A Flight To Remember, this one falls a little short.

#12- When Aliens Attack - 7/10 - The beginning is a little slow, but it really picks up when the Planet Express crew is forced to act out the last episode of a cancelled FOX television show from the 1990s - or else face total annihilation.

#13- Fry And The Slurm Factory - 8/10 - Nearly a 9, in my book. Hilarity ensues when Fry wins a tour of the secretive factory of Slurm, a repulsive but popular 31st century drink. What's the secret ingredient? You may not want to know. Fry's addiction to Slurm (""damn arms!"") and his and Bender's adventures with the Z-Ray in the beginning are definite highlights of this fine episode.

Keep in mind, if you think I've been harsh on these episodes, starting with season 2 when I get around to finally reviewing them (I've seen them all when they were originally aired and have watched all of them a number of times since) you'll be seeing a lot more 9s and 10s. These early episodes are only appetizers to what will be a very pleasing main course. The season gets a little weak in the middle but it finishes strong.",1125100800,12,6791,4.517100977198697

I like that Futurama shows more then only humor, there is emotional, fascinating stuff in it.

The only thing i find misplaced in a sci-fi cartoon or movie would be the sometimes medeivil stuff. But only sometimes, for the rest it's alot futuristic. Example Scruffy the janitor pulling on a rope to get the elevator up, this stuff should be replaced by some cool Sci-Fi style elevator.

All in all, these series r so great.

1824648,5,B000083C6W,"Most TV shows start off their first season ""finding their legs"", but the first season of ""Futurama"" starts off strong.  In fact, it's better than a few of the later seasons.  And while ""The Simpsons"" changed a lot as it developed (check out the characters as they looked in the first season), Futurama didn't change much at all in its 4-season run.

Is it as good as The Simpsons?  Well, it's DIFFERENT than The Simpsons -- it's hard to compare the two.  On it's own merits, it is a very funny show, though you may find it more entertaining if you're a science fiction fan.  The premise is that a pizza delivery boy from the 20th century gets frozen, then thawed out in the 30th century.  He is befriended by a kleptomaniac robot named Bender, and a cyclops named Leela.  After finding his great, great, great (etc.) nephew, Professor Hubert Farnsworth, he accepts a job working for the Professor as -- you guessed it -- a delivery boy.

The writing in this season is great, and the characters and voice acting are both well done.  If you liked The Simpsons, give this a shot -- it's not for everyone, but you may like it.",1120780800,,1122,4.455882352941177

You should buy futurama instead of the simpsons. with that you should buy futurama anyways. I give the whole series 5 STARS!!

1824671,5,B000083C6W,"Many of my favorite shows always tend to have a rough season because they have to establish their characters and all the relationships. Futurama, most likely due to the seasoned veterans who worked on Simpsons and this at the same time or did this after leaving Simpsons, ended up making a great show without the kind of mishaps first seasons tend to have.

The series starts off with the pilot Space Pilot 3000 when 24 year old Fry is working a dead end job and has a cheating girlfriend. While on a prank pizza delivery to a cryogenics factory, he accidentally gets frozen 1000 years, waking up on New Years Eve 2999. From there he meets strange aquatic semi-doctor Dr. Zoidberg, his great great great.... nephew Professor Farnsworth and his crush, one-eyed Leela. The Professor runs a delivery service through space to help fund his research projects so Leela, Fry and amoral bending robot Bender become his crew.

One thing you should know is that the series had many scheduling problems or pre-empts(thanks to Fox and their stupid football games), many episodes didn't even air during their original air-date or were only half-aired. So if you look at many first season guides, the 9th episode ""Hell is Other Robots"" is often regarded as the ""finale"" since it aired in May while next episode ""Flight to Remember"" was in November however on here the 13th episode ""Fry and the Slurm Factory"" is the finale.

This first season had many memorable moments including the secret of Slurm, the crew's trip to a big garbage ball with some familiar cameos, Fry and Bender as roommates or the introduction of the most self-absorbed captain, Zapp Brannigan and his sidekick, alien Kif Kroker.

Also, nicely done is the fact that all episodes have commentary with usually a big number of guests with series creator Matt Groening(also created Simpsons) and exec. producer David Cohen with a rotating staff of writers, directors and voice talent. None of that Family Guy 2 commmentaries-a-disc crap.

There's highlight episodes and is a great place to start for what was a very hilarious series(stupid Fox and their cancelling).",1115251200,,2118,4.921568627450981
1824672,5,B000083C6W,"A brainchild of Simpsons creator Matt Groening, Futurama launched itself into homes across the galaxy in Spring 1999. Employing the same quick wit and visual humor that has made The Simpsons one of the most successful shows in television history, Futurama (despite its early cancellation in August 2003) maintains its own loyal cult following...

Set one thousand years in the future, Futurama follows the life of a modern day American pizza delivery boy named Fry who finds himself reanimated 1,000 years after being accidentally cryogenically frozen. Brought back to life, Fry hunts down his great, great, great nephew - a tinkering scientist named Professor Farnsworth - and spends his days working for his distant relative's intergalactic delivery service alongside good friends, Leela (a female Cyclops) and Bender (a morally-challenged robot). As the characters (usually Fry and Bender) engage in various schemes throughout the universe, Professor Farnsworth and his crew meet up with a number of interesting characters and civilizations...

The Futurama (Season 1) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere in which Fry awakens following his 1,000 year cryogenic freeze. When a Cyclops named Leela tries to insert a career chip in him which will make him a delivery boy for life, Fry escapes, meets a robot named Bender, and the two eventually join Leela when she removes her own career chip. Together, they hunt down Fry's closest relative (Professor Farnsworth) and become the crew of his space delivery service... Other notable episodes include ""The Series Has Landed"" in which Fry and the crew deliver their first package, and ""My Three Suns"" in which Fry becomes leader of a race of liquid aliens... Season 1 also features its own distinct alien language found on signs littered throughout the various episodes...

But remember how awkward they were in their first year or two?  FUTURAMA actually never really went through such a time. It had its identity pretty firm right off the bat.

The characters were never meant to really touch us. The show is fast paced, deliberately cynical and more directly satirical.  Hence, it doesn't warm the cockles of your heart like the SIMPSONS can.

But it sure was FUNNY!  And some of the characters are up to snuff with the greatest of all time.  Zach Brannigan, the clueless captain, is a joy whenever he made his cameo appearances.

And Bender is one of the funniest ever.  His voice is hysterical, and certainly his attitude is priceless.  His line about ""gaydar"" became an instant classic.

If you've never discovered FUTURAMA, but you like THE SIMPSONS or KING OF THE HILL, then you owe it to yourself to try these guys out.  And if you remember the show with fondness, a revisit through these well-done DVDs is worthwhile.",1109203200,,1229,4.568807339449541

What Matt does do well, as any creator/writer is invent unforgettable and lovable characters like :

Fry - Immature young man who suddenly finds himself awake in the year 3000 after accidentally falling into a cryogenic Tube. Spends most of an episode trying to hit on a one-eyed sexy alien chick.

Leela - One-eyed sexy alien chick. Would do better things with her life if she weren't surrounded by idiots.

Bender - A Bending robot who is an Alcoholic, Callow and a Cleptomanic. Has more of a love life than his peers.

Amy - Token asian chick who coincidentally resembles an asian chick in the year 2000.

Dr Zoidberg - A crustacean who is coincidentally a doctor. Unlucky in love, life and money.

The Professor - a really old guy who looks like he's born in the year 2000. related to Fry in some menial way.

Captain Zapp Brannigan sets a course for adventure when he decides to steer the Titanic through a swarm of comets, or as calls them, ""the icebergs of the sky.""

11. Mars University
  When Fry returns to college to prove he can be just as good of a dropout as he was in the Twentieth Century, Professor Farnsworth surprises him with a dorm roommate, a super-intelligent monkey. Meanwhile Bender, a legend of the robot fraternity ""ERR"" leads a revenge of the robot nerds.

12. When Aliens Attack
  The Omicrons threaten to destroy the earth if they can't see the last episode of the lost 20th Century TV series ""Single Female Lawyer"" starring an unmarried human female, who wears very short miniskirts, struggling to succed in human man's world. Because the last episode was destroyed by someone spilling beer on the transmitter (Fry), the crew from Planet Express must deliver their version of single Female Lawyer.

13. Fry & The Slurm Factory
  Fry opens a ""Slurm"" beverage container bearing the golden bottle cap and wins a tour of the ""Slurm"" Factory (a la ""Willy Wonka"") to see how the world's most deliciously addictive soft drink is made. Wandering off from the tour, Fry is horrified when he accidently discovers the top-secret ingredient that makes ""Slurm"" so impossible to resist.",1099353600,17,5248,4.6302702702702705
1824691,5,B000083C6W,"Futurama is an intelligent show that can be enjoyed by just about anyone, but it is also incredibly nerdy (the robot apartment numbers are all in 1's and 0's to go with their binary coding). I mean that in a good way of course! Nerds need their own show too! This, of course, means that there are jokes in this set that many people will never understand. That's fine, because this set is so jam-packed with jokes, you may not even realize you've missed some.

Futurama, in case someone actually doesn't know, is from Matt Groening, the man who brought us ""Life In Hell"" and much more importantly, ""The Simpsons."" And I think it's fair to say if you like ""The Simpsons"" you'll probably like ""Futurama"" too.  Like the Simpsons, it has a large cast of characters with the Matt Groening trademark yellow skin and four fingers. The show's humor is also similar to the Simpsons in many ways, although obviously the Simpsons never did so many science fiction jokes.

In the first episode, we meet lowly pizza delivery boy Phillip J. Fry (usually simply referred to as Fry) working on the 31st of December, 1999. Long story short, Fry ends up getting frozen in a tube and wakes up to find himself in the year 3000. There he meets the beautiful cyclops Turanga Leela, and the thieving cigar smoking robot Bender. The three of them end up working at an intergalactic package delivery company for Fry's great, great (let's skip a few great's here) nephew Hubert Farnsworth. Other notable members of the Futurama cast you'll meet in Season One include: Amy Wong (a clutz from Mars), Dr. Zoidberg (a lobster alien who smells like he eats garbage and does), Hermes Conrad (a Jamaican accountant), Zapp Branigan (a bumbling idiot of a space captain who seems to have a thing for William Shatner), and Kif Kroker (Zapp's lackey).

From the quirky notion of celeb heads living in jars (""I don't do that anymore"" is Leonard Nimoy's response when asked do his infamous hand signal from ""Star Trek"") to brilliant spoofs of movies ranging from ""Animal House"" to ""Titanic,"" there is truly something for everyone in Futurama's first season, and unlike ""The Simpsons"" first season, Futurama got it right from day one.

Featuring the voice talents of Billy West (""Ren & Stimpy""), Katey Sagal (Peg from ""Married With Children""), John Dimaggio and more truly top-notch voice artists.

Every episode in this set includes commentary, which is often funny and informative. Don't miss out.",1097625600,6,2458,4.812796208530806
1824692,5,B000083C6W,"Campy and hilarious cartoon by Matt Groening, creator of The Simpsons.  Futurama makes fun of politics, other movies, people, TV, advertising, social concerns, environmental issues, religion, se$x, and everything both touchable and untouchable.

The combination of in-your-face one-liners and tongue-in-cheek humor is as good as it gets for an evening of enjoyable escapism.  The entire premise of the show is that Philip J. Fry, a pizza delivery boy, was accidentally frozen back in 1999 and reawakened in the year 3000.  He goes to work for his great nephew, Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth, who's 150 years old and senile.

Katey Sagal was the perfect choice for the voice of Leela, a feisty spaceship captain with one eye and a purple ponytail.  Wherever she goes, Leela really kicks hinder.  Bender is a foul-mouthed girder-bending robot who becomes Fry's friend, and who must drink alcohol to charge his batteries.  There Hermes the Jamaican accountant, Amy the intern, and Dr. Zoidberg, the giant lobster physician. (he also eats everything in sight)

Because it's a space cartoon, the creators are not bound to any kind of realism, which is good.  Some of the creatures and situations in the series really showcase the sick and twisted minds behind the show, freeing Groening from the restrictions of The Simpsons and allowing his darker side to soar.  Nothing is too sacred to take advantage of in this comical and entertaining series.  Also, watch for the quips at the bottom of the screen during the opening credits, very similar to Bart writing on the chalkboard during the opening theme of The Simpsons.

Volume One is the first season of this show, and although still hilarious, you can see the growing pains as episode by episode the characters develop more fleshy personalities and the show settles into its campy niche.  What I didn't like about the DVD set (other than being only three discs) was the fact that there was no ""Play All"" option available.  You have to start each episode individually.  On the plus side, each episode has an audio commentary available, subtitles, and a few other extras like deleted scenes and gallery options.

Here is a quick rundown of what's in Volume One:

Disc One:

Space Pilot 3000:  Pilot for the show.  Notice the first thing Bender ever says is ""Bite my shiny metal a$$"", a line that became a constant in his vocabulary.  Special guest, Leonard Nimoy.  Introduces Leela and Prof. Farnsworth.

The Series Has Landed:  Introduces Hermes, Amy, and Dr. Zoidberg.  The crew visits an amusement park on the moon.

I, Roommate:  Fry needs to find a place to stay other than the lab, so he and Bender decide to be roommates.  They need to find a place that they can both be comfortable.  Bender refers to his antenna as ""little Bender"".

Love's Labors Lost In Space:  Introduces Captain Zap Brannigan and his sidekick Kif.  Absolutely hilarious character whose Captain's tunic is way, way, waaaaaay too short and who is a pompous idiot.  After accidentally sleeping with Zap, Leela goes down to a disintegrating planet and finds her new pet Nibbler.

Disc Two:

Fear Of A Bot Planet:  Don't even ask about Bender's butter dispenser at the ballgame.  Fry and Leela have to go down to a Robot Planet to bring Bender back, but the robots kill humans.

A Fishful of Dollars:  Fry discovers he's rich on 1000 years of interest from his 93 cent bank balance, and buys the last can of anchovies.  This episode introduces Mom, the world's most huggable industrialist.  When Mom steps out of her ""fat suit"", she's a bony old woman in a tight purple bodysuit who chainsmokes.

My Three Suns:  Bender becomes a chef, the crew visits a planet where you can buy anything (note the Crack Dispenser Machine), and Fry delivers a package to a desert planet and then drinks their water-being emperor.

A Big Piece Of Garbage:  Prof Farnsworth invents the smell-o-scope and detects a pile of garbage heading for earth.  This episode takes huge potshots at the movies Armageddon and Deep Impact.

Hell Is Other Robots:  Hysterical episode, Bender calls Fry and Leela ""organ sacks"" and goes out to ""Drink until he reboots"".  He then starts ""jacking on"" by plugging into electricity, turns to religion to cure him, and winds out in Robot Hell where he and the crew perform a lively musical. Beastie Boys do a guest spot.

Disc Three:

A Flight To Remember:  Makes fun of Titanic, and brings back Zap Brannigan as the Captain of the luxury ship.  Zap decides to ""take a route with chest air"" and wrecks the ship.

Mars University:  Takes a heavy dig at Animal House.  Fry goes back to college and Bender shows his old frat house how to party.

When Aliens Attack:  Zap Brannigan again!  This time he has everyone dressing up in his short-short uniform.  Aliens come to Earth in order to view the last episode of a long lost sitcom.  At the beginning, when they are relaxing at the beach, Dr. Zoidberg ""goes for a scuttle"".  I don't know why, but that just cracks me up.

Fry And The Slurm Factory:  Digs at Willy Wonka and Spuds MacKenzie.  Fry wins a trip to the factory that makes his favorite soft drink, Slurm, where the crew discover the disgusting source of Slurm.  Fry still can't stop drinking it though.

Futurama is a warped cartoon for people with a warped sense of humor.  It's silly comedy with a naughty edge to it, so if that is your cup of tea you will probably like it as much as I do.  Enjoy!",1095379200,44,5437,4.753483386923901
1824693,5,B000083C6W,"From the creative mind of Matt Groening, comes one of the best cartoon series of the 30th century! This is really a great series and it was a shame that it was canceled so early. Thankfully, FOX was kind enough to release it on DVD. The show revolves around Fry, your typical, average, 20th century slacker, who accidentally cryogenically freezes himself and wakes up in the year 3000. While there, he soon befriends many new and strange people. Like Bender, an alcoholic, foul-mouthed robot. Leela, the only one-eyed alien on the planet Earth. And Professor Farnsworth, Fry's great (x50)-nephew. If you are a fan of sci-fi movies, than this is really the series for you, because it has plenty of sci-fi parodies and jokes. For everyone else, it is mostly the characters' charm that will have you laughing throughout. The show works well, and sometimes even better than the Simpsons, because the characters are all interesting and the situations they get themselves into are all very funny.

The best episodes on this set include:
Love's Labors Lost In Space - The crew must save animals on a collapsing planet, but meets a ladies-man imbecile along the way.
A Fishful of Dollars - Fry becomes a billionaire and buys the last existing can of anchovies.
Hell Is Other Robots - Bender discovers religion after he stops abusing electricity.
Fry & The Slurm Factory - Fry and the gang win a trip to a soda factory and discover a shocking secret!

Extra features include Audio Commentary on all the episodes. The audio commentaries are the best extras on the disc, and all of them have very interesting facts about how each show was made, and they are all very funny. The 4th disc also has a featurette about the show.

All in all, if you have seen the show on Adult Swim, you probably have already bought this set, or you have it on your wish list. For those of you who haven't seen it, watch an episode or two on Cartoon Network's late-night line-up, Adult Swim. You'll fall in love with this show before the first 5-minutes, I guarantee it!",1093737600,,2038,4.671309192200557
1824694,5,B000083C6W,"Ah, Futurama...how you are missed. Futurama is by far not only the greatest cartoon ever, but the greatest television program ever. Of course, many of you are disagreeing with at least half of that statement, but I stand by it. Unless Matt Groening pulls another brilliant cartoon out his ass, Futurama will never be topped. I, like millions of others hate Fox for canceling it. You know you got a problem when that many people are mad at you for canceling one show, not even counting the anger aimed towards you for canceling others great shows like Andy Richter Controls the Universe, Family Guy (I know it's coming back, but they still cancelled it once!) and Titus (it and Andy Richter should at least get DVDs!).

Futurama starts with a delivery boy named Phillip J. Fry making a delivery to I. C. Wiener (a crank call) and the address given leads Fry to a cryogenic freezing facility (little does he know). Upon realizing the order was fake, fry leans back in a chair, opens a beer, and counts down the seconds remaining to the new millennium. Once the countdown reaches 1, Fry's chair tips over, sending him into a cryogenic freezer, in which he is frozen for 1000 years.

Cut to one thousand years later, Fry wakes up and realizes he is in the future, never able to see his family and coworkers again (a fact by which Fry is oddly overjoyed). Soon Fry finds out that he must get a career chip installed into his hand matching him with the job he is most suited for, which of course, is delivery boy. Unwilling to become a delivery boy in his new life, he runs away from Leela, a one-eyed alien (well, at least until she finds out otherwise in season 4) whose job is to give people who are awakening from their slumber at the cryogenic freezing facility their career chip (which is pierced into their hand). Along the way, he ventures into what he mistakes for a phone booth (actually a suicide booth) where he intends to call his great, great, great... nephew Professor Hubert Farnsworth. He ends up meeting and befriending a robot named Bender Bending Rodriguez, a robot designed for bending who wishes to commit suicide because he found out the rods he was bending were being used for suicide booths. After talking with Bender, Fry is soon found by Leela, so he and Bender run away. During the chase, Leela realizes how much she hates the job she was assigned to and wishes for a new life, so she teams up with Fry and Bender, who also don't want the jobs assigned to them. Soon they meet Fry's nephew, who assigns them as his new crew (his old crew met a horrible end, dying at the hands of giant wasps). Fortunately, he still has his old crew's career chips (in a folder titled Contents of Wasps Stomach). Leela is enlisted the captain (as she's the only one who can pilot the ship) and Fry and Bender her crewmates, as they work for Professor Farnsworth's...delivery service.

In the second episode of this delightfully brilliant series, we meet the Jamaican bureaucrat, Hermes; the ship's doctor, Doctor Zoidberg, a giant lobster who seems oddly unaquainted with the human body; and Amy, the Planet Express (the company's name) intern, who is the sexy daughter of rich parents.

From Fry becoming Bender's roommate (containing one of my favorite lines from the whole show, ""Fry, of all the friends I've had you're the first""); delivering a package to a planet full of human-hating robots; Bender joining the Temple of Robotology which lands him face to face with the robot devil; and the classic Willy Wonka spoof, Fry and the Slurm Factory, this 3 disc boxed set gives us the making of one of the greatest shows of all time. Throughout the first season, thought not quite up to par with the later seasons, these 13 episodes set the bar for excellence, and add up to undeniably one of the greatest first seasons ever, including one of the greatest pilots ever.

People hope for Futurama to be picked back up, as do I, but virtually nothing can change Fox's mind. They hated the show from the beginning. You'd think it would be like stealing candy from a baby for Matt Groening to get another show. I mean, he created the Simpsons! But Fox hated it so much he had to struggle. Once it was picked up, it was placed in one of the worst prime time slots you can get (Sundays at 7:00 on Fox). Matt Groening tried to get it moved to another time, another day, and eventually even another network, but Fox denied him of all of it, practically wanting this show to fail. Well Fox, you got your wish, and in the process angered millions of fans around the globe. Happy? I sure wouldn't be.",1093392000,,4594,4.556900726392252
1824695,5,B000083C6W,"Matt Groening does it again. Futurama is as funny as The Simpsons. This DVD is the seasons first with 13 episodes, lots of extras and eggs. Futurama is one of the best shows ever and Fox should be ashamed for cancelleing it. The selection screens are done very well. I recommend this DVD for fans, and for people who never saw it should because they don't know what they're missing. Go buy it now!",1093305600,,397,4.378378378378378
1824696,5,B000083C6W,"When this show was cancelled in 2002, it began a long winded series of FOX cancelling well needed shows on its schedule. Next came ""Family Guy,"" ""John Doe,"" (and the less important to me) ""Firefly,"" etc etc. However this DVD is something to shout about (see ""Mars University"", has the song) The DVDs are amazing in picture and cartoon quality and the one-second Groening gags are hilarious.

 We begin at ""Space Pilot 3000."" We travel through 1000 years of New York, careers in space, humongous garbage loads, people living in so many different ways it is unthinkable that 2000 even existed. The characters are amazing: dumbed-down but still caring Fry, alcoholic robot Bender (whose many functions are hysterical) one-eyed and independent Leela, maniacal 150-year old Professor Farnsworth, straight from Jamaica Hermes, the lobster that is Dr. Zoidberg, and cute, shallow Amy.

 You can't go wrong with classics like ""I, Roomate"" and others, but also the underrated opening theme and gags. Following in the steps of the Simpsons, oddly enough a disclaimer presents odd facts on FUTURAMA which can be hysterical or just plain simple (e.g. ""PRESENTED IN DOUBLEVISION - WHERE DRUNK"").

 However this is a great set to buy. If many more people watch this, a renewal may be on the way!",1091664000,2,1281,5.018867924528302
1824717,4,B000083C6W,"The other volumes are better.  In spite of this, it still remains a smart buy.  The Good News: There are four hilarious episodes: ""Love Labours Lost in Space,"" (featuring the best Zapp Brannigan dialogue of all time) ""I, Roomate,"" (with some very funny apartment gags) ""A Big Piece of Garbage"" (A parody on overdramatic disaster films like Armageddon), and ""Fry and the Slurm Factory,"" (which just feels like a classic).  The Bad News: The show starts off a little shakily, many of the secondary characters are underdeveloped, the voices sound different, there are occassional long and awkward sections without humor or wit, and finally, there are only 13 episodes.  For me, its easy to see why Futurama did not catch on with popular audiences: the sci-fi theme can be off-putting, and the humor is sometimes over the heads of many people.  However, another element that hurt Futurama was that its much anticipated first season was the weakest.  The Simpsons also had a weak first season, but there was no crazy anticipation, and it had time to grow and mature without intensive scrutiny.  Futurama had too much hype in the beginning to deal with an on and off season, and unfortunately that's just what happened.  But don't let that deter you; knowing what you already now (that Futurama becomes a great show), you can cut Volume One little slack, and enjoy everything almost as much as the other volumes.  Plus, there are those great episodes that I already mentioned, my favorite of which is ""Love Labours,"" strictly for Brannigan's before/after seduction talk.  Overall, not as good as the rest, but still recommended for the fans.  Newcomers should start with Volumes Two or Three to see Futurama in full swing.",1088380800,4,1716,4.923611111111111
1824718,5,B000083C6W,"That title may be biased since I'm a science fiction fan.  The Simpsons is great.  But Futurama tickles a funny bone in me that only a crazy, fantasy-based, anything-goes series can.  Futurama takes a hilarious spin on the extreme evolution of modern society.  The result is a show whose content and events seem unlikely yet convincingly plausible.  It's all held together by interesting stories and competent visuals.  There's very little to find fault here.  Most important, the show is funny!  Perhaps there's a generous portion of lowbrow humor that prevails through the series but I can forgive that.  Futurama's overall quality more than makes up for it.
The use of subtle computer animation in many scenes is a surprising but welcome treat.  It cleverly reflects the show's futuristic theme.  If any cartoon should pioneer such an animation style it's this one.
My favorite episode in volume one: Fear Of A Bot Planet.",1084147200,,925,5.019736842105263

I've watched the first 6 episodes so far, and the final two episodes multiple times because I love ""When Aliens Attack"" and ""Fry and the Slurm Factory"" that much.
It's not ""The Simpsons"".
The humor is a bit more intelligent.
The humor is a bit more eccentric because of its sci-fi setting.  That's okay, I love eccentricity.
They can get away with a lot of otherwise PG- or R-rated material because of its sci-fi setting.  (the sci-fi setting actually makes the humor FUNNY, rather than vulgar.  So it's a plus, in many ways.)
This is not to say the entire series is entirely based on eccentricity or 'hidden vulgarity'.
FOX also knows the value of its customers, or at least the value of DVD.  The video/image quality of these episodes is as perfect as they can get.  It's virtually identical, if not better, than that of broadcast quality.  Colors are vibrant, pictures are crisp... yum!
The only minor down side is the lack of Dolby 5.1 treatment for the sound.  However, in Dolby 2.0, it still rocks.  No demerits.
The only major downside is a goofy, inconsistent menu system.  This gets rectified in Volume 3.  But it's still obvious and easy to navigate between episodes.  No demerits here.
If you're a fan of Futurama, this set is a MUST BUY.  Heck, it's so good, I recommend you get it for full MSRP!  But I have yet to argue with amazon.com's prices...",1079395200,,1479,4.591603053435114

I only gave this show a few comments here to warn people about how terrible it is. It's no wonder that they had to settle on Billy West and Peggy Bundy as the main voice 'talent.'I think Matt Groening jinxed himself with the few seasons he made of this show before it was cancelled, because it seems that lately The Simpsons is headed down the same path. I couldn't care less about who disagrees with me on this, or who doesn't want to take my word for it, It doesn't matter, I know what is funny and what is not.

1824723,4,B000083C6W,"Right from the Pilot, the characters are basically fully formed. The producers of the Simpsons bring us plenty of satire of the science fiction/fantasy genre, making fun of Star Trek, Star Wars, and many other popular fiction works. The first season is 13 episodes of high quality television animation--at least as good as the later Simpson episodes. The voice acting of Billy West (Fry, the Professor) and John Dimaggio (Bender) is amazing. Katey Sagal (Married... with Children, Eight Simple Rules) provides the voice of the cyclops Leela. Many other extremely talented voice actors round out the cast, including Tres MacNeil, who does all of the rougher sounding female voices, among others. The show manages to make social commentary as it goes, but never at the expense of foregoing a laugh, so you can safely ignore any messages that may be blended with the hilarity. Unfortunately, this show was pulled by Fox after only a handful of seasons, but enjoys a fierce cult following. Of all the animated half hour shows to walk the in the footsteps of the Simpsons, this one stands very tall.

1824735,5,B000083C6W,"Yes, Futurama was anticipated with a lot of excitement by me, my brother, and a number of our friends (likely all of them, but I can't honestly remember).  I recall watching the first show and enjoying it, back when it premeired in 1999 (along with Farscape!), though I must confess that I wasn't the most diligent viewer.  I believe that the heads at Fox, in their infinite wisdom, yanked Futurama from its comfortable time slot on Sunday nights (which it shared with ""The Simpsons"", which I watched and continue to watch religiously to this day), and when it was no longer on on Sunday nights I was just too lazy to find out when it was and therefore missed a number of them.  My brother and I received this first volume of Futurama (containing the first 13 episodes broadcast, thus spanning the very short first season and the first four shows of the second) approxamately a year ago, and though I remembered several, half the number of shows included here were new to me.  All were enjoyed immensely by the both of us, and just over this past weekend I reviewed every single one of them (brought them along with me when I took off again for college.  Who has time for studying?).
Highlights here include the original pilot, which does a nice job building up the ""brave new world"" this series is set in, wonderfully introducing our characters and making us eager for more by the time it's finished.  Great appearance by the disembodied head of Leonard Nimoy (feeding time).  My next true favorite show is disc two's ""Fishful of Dollars"", where Fry discovers how wealthy he is in the future and sqanders his fortune on a can of soon-to-be-extinct anchovies, followed shortly after by ""My Three Suns"", set on a desert planet inhabited by a race of liquid... people... .  (watch for a subtle ""Man Who Would Be King"" reference toward the end).  ""Hell Is Other Robots"" sports a great musical number, and finally, on disc three, we get my all-time favorite episode of Futurama, the hilarious ""Fry and the Slurm Factory"", which speaks especially to the former Mountain Dew-junkie who continues to live inside me, even after three years of abstaining (for the most part) from the highly caffinated-sugar-loaded Beverage of Kings.  The only thing that keeps ""FATSF"" from being perfect is the fact that a large chunk of its humor comes from the classic movie/book it parodies/steals from, ""Willie Wonka/Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"".  But aside from that, it's loaded with great moments, situations, and lines.  A classic half-hour of quality television.  ""Tell them [the Grunka Lunkas] I hate them!""

I love the characters which is WHY I bought this. The packaging is striking. The extras are commendable. But outside of the Professor, Fry, Bender, and Leela, there just isn't much that is 'funny'. I listen to the commentaries and Matt and the gang are laughing wildly, and I'm just thinking to myself: Why is that so funny to them? I do give this Volume 1 a 3.5 stars, but the show seems simplistic and just a futuristic variation on Simpsons humor. Which isn't a bad thing really, just seems second hand. I do like the show, but unlike others here, shows I 'like' do not get automatic 5 star ratings, those are reserved for classics.
This show needed a major retooling. There are just too many characters that aren't worth air time. Zoidberg comes to mind as does the Jamaican. Even characters like Zap Brannigan should be funnier than they are, I just can't quite put my finger on the problem.

Not only is the humor goofy, intelligent, scathingly satirical, and genius, but the voice acting is top notch, the animation and computer generated images are revolutionary, the orchestral music accompaniments are amazing, and the writing is one that even quantum physicists have to appreciate.
If you don't believe me, listen to the commentary. Listen to the thought that the writers put into each episode, how they have former physicists on their staff. How they'll argue for days about whether or not it's realistic for Fry and his buddies to survive in each of the environments they are put in....
But this series truly shines in the subtlety of the joke. Rather than bashing your head in with the humor, like the Family Guy, or leaving you chagrined with a touch of sentimental warmth like the Simpsons, Futurama shamelessly puts its protagonist idiot, Fry, and the rest of the crew in jokes where the punchline isn't even uttered sometimes. It's up to the audience to get the other half of the joke, and it's the biggest reason why Futurama didn't last on TV. Groening went in a different direction than the Simpsons, because he couldn't cop out with childish goofy humor, being that all his characters were adults, and intelligent ones at that (other than Fry). He left it up to the viewer to ""get it"", and for those of us who do, the results are hilarious beyond belief.",1074038400,,1540,4.793233082706767

1) You might have to put up with confused stares from your older relatives (like your mother or father) who don't understand why you're laughing so hard.

""Futurama"" quickly became the highpoint of weeknights on Cartoon Network, with us both laughing our butts off.

As a poor college student, this meant not eating for the next couple weeks.

1824776,5,B000083C6W,"Hmm...Where to start my love for this series. Some of the best jokes ever produced my Matt Groeing apperead on this series. For the untrained, Futurama was a series about a pizza delivery kid who accidently falls into a cyrogenic freezer where he lay dormant for a 1000 years and reawoken in the year 3000. This series has been known for it's great jokes such as an alcholic, kleptomatic robot known as Bender who bends things. The special features aren't very well except for the feature commentary provided by Matt Groeing, Joe DiMaggio, Billy West, Chris X. Cohen, etc. The commentary is cheerful and brightful plus quite witty. The animation perfectly blends 3-D and 2-D animation beautifully. The series has a dark tone on some of the episodes but always lightens the mode later on different episodes. My favorite so far would have to be ""Hell is for other robots"", which Bender jacks on with electricity and than joins Robology to clean his sins. But Bender goes back to his sinful ways and goes to Robot Hell where Hank Azaria voices the devil. For the extreme Simpsons fans, Hank is the voice of Homer and others. Hank actually sings a song about Robot Hell in this episode which to be is amazing because ,techinically, Homer is singing. My final grade: A+!",1064188800,,1265,4.728506787330317

While Futurama doesn't come close to matching the all-American wit of the Simpsons, he's not aiming for it: Instead, viewers are asked to see what the future holds, and laugh at the results. Sure, there's plenty of ""only in the realm of Ray Bradbury"" to go around, but what keeps Futurama from being dull is the genuine characters, who get a chance to fully develop in this, the inaugeral season of the show.
The DVD collection of all thirteen episodes makes for a great addition to any Futurama fan, and anyone familiar with the often hilarious commentaries Groening and company provided to the first and second season collections of the Simpsons will not be disappointed. Quite simply, there isn't a stinker in this set, and the proper season closer (Fry and the Slurm Factory) has to be one of the classics in this all-too-short series' run.

However, Futurama is extremely funny in its own way. It is much darker than the Simpsons, and the humor is geared towards adults, not a total audience like many of the Simpsons episodes are. The writing is also geared towards a more cerebral audience, and is less accessible to a general viewership.
Personally, it took me a while to warm to the series, and now cannot imagine how the network could cancel it. Futurama offers a lot to the viewer who enjoys a variety of comedy and observation, and it subtlety and nuance should make this a great DVD for someone who needs a little more depth than mainstream TV has to offer.",1059696000,,825,4.657534246575342
1824812,4,B000083C6W,"With the decline of The Simpsons well underway (I lost interest a long time ago), Futurama is now filling the void. Most of my friends don't like this series, but I have always enjoyed it. It is not quite the cultural revolution that The Simpsons was, but it is a great series in it's own right.
Futurama Season 1 is a 3 DVD set with the, naturally, the entire first season (13 episodes in total). Unlike most shows that get interesting around season 2 or 3, the first episodes are the best in my opinion. My favorites are ""My Three Suns""(where Fry becomes the emporer of a aqua-people planet), ""I, Roomate"" (where Fry and Bender become roommates), and the stomach-turning ""Fry & The Slurm Factory"" (where Fry wins a trip to his favorite soft drink factory). All episodes are amusing in their own way, but some are definitely funnier than others. Since the story is non-linear, the episodes can be watched in any order.
Unlike a lot of bare-bones series DVDs, Futurama hosts a healthy selection of extras for the fans. The commentaries I do not have much interest in. I prefer to have the commentary over a favorite movie, rather than a cartoon series. But the deleted scenes are a riot. The commentary is for all epidoses, but the deleted scenes are only for selected ones. The real prize is the conceptual art gallery, since I love the animation style and the character designs. The Behind-The-Scenes featurette is nothing special, but it covers some interesting points.
While not as raunchy as The Family Guy or pop culture savy as The Simpsons, Futurama is still a quality series that is entertaining on it's own level. Apparently, the show was cancelled recently. That's too bad, but at least we have DVDs to remember this sadly underrated series.",1059264000,12,1752,4.728758169934641

This is far from the truth.  While the Simpsons has earned a place in Americana, it is no where near as witty, funny, or as quality-made as Futurama.
The first thing you will notice about this show is that the animation is clean and crisp with vibrant colors.  Amazing 3D imagery is blended seamlessly to 2D cell art.  Voice acting is high-quality, and Billy West (Fry, Zoidberg, Dr. Farnsworth) flaunts his versatility with about half the total voices on the show.  Kate Segal returns to Fox as the voice of Leela.
The DVD set is just so incredible.  The transfer is flawless and looks better than the broadcast version.  Sounds are crisper and cleaner and excellent in the Dolby Digital version.  But the best thing (besides the series) is the commentary.  Groening, D.X. Cohen, Billy West, Dimaggio, and others talk about the little ""in"" jokes, how Ph. D's figured out how fast a shadow would move on the moon, how the alien-ese signs read ""Fried Humans,"" why the robot planet is named Chapek 9, what some of the pre-production titles for the show were (Aloha Mars!).  I've watched every episode three times so far, twice with the commentary on!  This is the BEST commentary since Raimi and Cambell did Army of Darkness together!

1824829,5,B000083C6W,"This DVD set is, hands-down, the best treatment of a show's first season I've ever seen. If you're a fan, or even just sorta liked the show, you should check this out. First, some thoughts on the show itself:
I never warmed up to ""Futurama"" while it was on, really. The Fox Network's dubious handling made it difficult for me to see unless it was a rerun out of its usual timeslot. And ""The Simpsons"" set the bar almost unrealistically high. Also, ""Futurama"" sports a cast of ruthlessly flawed characters, with Fry's laziness and Bender's anti-social tendencies almost constantly at the fore. While heroic and competent, Leela is also meddlesome and petulant with some obviously serious self-esteem issues. Even Kif, long-suffering aide to the incredibly obnoxious Zapp Brannigan, turns out to be more than a little annoying when away from his oppressive master.
Cartoon Network's recent airings of the first four seasons and this DVD set, however, have given me a chance to appreciate the quality that reeks from this show, however. The animation is top-notch, the jokes are densely packed and originally presented, the voice acting is peerless, and the characters =do= grow on you after a while. It never reaches the sublime insanity of the best ""Simpsons"" episodes but, as you learn in this DVD set, that was a conscious choice. (Because of the futuristic setting, the producers wanted more coherent storylines. In retrospect, that may have been a mistake.)
This DVD has commentary for each of the 13 episodes (unlike, e.g., the one commentary on ""The Simpsons"" first season set) and, for the most part, the commentary is really good. There are occasions of silence when the commentators have obviously gotten engrossed in some part of the show, especially later on in the set. But for the most part, you learn a lot about what people were thinking, ideas that didn't make it, problems with getting certain things across, and so on. And it's fun to listen to. Piled on top of this is concept art, rough-draft versions, and deleted scenes, making this a collection worth having.
It's also a serious nerdfest. Hoo-boy. From the alien codes (the first one cracked within hours of the pilot's airing, the second, more complex code cracked after several months), to the constant Star Trek (and more esoteric sci-fi) references, to the planting of binary jokes (Bender's apartment is code for a ""$"") and even the attention to atrophysics (Leela and Fry race against the setting sun on the moon), this is a show rich in references both scientific and sci-fi. Probably moreso, and more unapologetically, than any other show in American TV history. And, to be fair, this may have been a barrier to its success.
Nonetheless, this is (was) a good show, and the first season, while not the best, holds up remarkably well, and nary an episode passes without some really memorable moments. It's definitely worth a look.",1056499200,14,2908,4.936734693877551
1824830,5,B000083C6W,It must be said: 'Futurama' urinates from a great height over pretty much everything else there is. Brilliant stuff.,1055894400,2,116,5.157894736842105
1824831,5,B000083C6W,"I wasn't exactly fond of Futurama when the first couple of episodes came out, but with time, this show delightfully grew on me.  Because it was the creation of Matt Groening, Futurama attracted a fair amount of hype, but it wound up attracting mixed reviews.  Aside from the fact it lived in the shadows of its more prosperous and household-named sibling, The Simpsons, a rather big chunk of Futurama's audience, most of them, Simpsons fans, unfairly compared Futurama to the long-running 14-year legendary sitcom.  Futurama was never meant to outdo or even compare to The Simpsons in any way, shape or form, but as a refreshing, futuristic comedy.  It is not as satirical as The Simpsons, not as brash as the axed Family Guy, and certainly not as foul and potty-humored as South Park, but Futurama guarantees a nice, healthy laugh.
If you're relatively fresh to the world of Futurama, it revolves around a New York pizza delivery boy named Fry, who finds himself cryogenically frozen from New Year's Eve 1999, only to emerge in the year 3000.  Refusing to resume his pizza delivery boy services 1000 years later, Fry finds employment at his 30xgreat nephew, Professor Farnsworth's intergalactic delivery service, the Planet Express.  Fry befriends among others, Leila, the purple-haired, one-eyed tough vixen, and Bender, a bending robot.  Steadily, the show developed into in its own with unique storylines and characters and became a nice accompaniment to the big-named sitcoms (i.e. The Simpsons, King of the Hill, Malcolm in the Middle) on Fox's comedy lineup.  Here is the summary for each episode of Season 1:
1. Space Pilot 3000 - Fry is cryogenically frozen by accident in 1999 and wakes up in the year 3000. He befriends the lovely cycloptic Leela and the grouchy, alcoholic robot, Bender and all three wind up employed at Professor Farnsworth's Planet Express delivery service.
2. The Series Has Landed - Fry is excited about visiting the Moon on his first delivery. When he arrives, he finds that the main attraction is a giant amusement park built there. Fry yearns to get Leela to appreciate the beauty of the celestial body.
3. I, Roommate - Fry is kicked out of the Planet Express offices and Bender lets him move in with him. When Fry finds a robot's living arrangements unadaptable, he suggests he and Bender look for a new apartment.
4. Love's Labors Lost in Space - Leela tries to find a decent man. Her search may be over when she crosses paths with Zapp Brannigan, a commended starship captain, but she finds that idiocy may be hiding behind even the largest badge.
5. Fear of a Bot Planet - The crew are slated to deliver a package to Chapek 9, where humans are killed on sight, so Bender must actually deliver it. When he's captured after the robots find he works for humans, Fry and Leela must don robot costumes to go rescue him.
6. A Fistful of Dollars - Due to the interest added on Fry's miniscule 20th century account, Fry is now a billionaire and gets swept up with his fortune, one of which spending fifty million dollars on one can of now extinct anchovies. But what he doesn't know is that Mom, head of a mega-conglomerate company, will do anything to get them.
7. My Three Suns - Delivering a package to a planet inhabited by liquid aliens, Fry, after walking to the palace in the scorching heat, finds a bottle of liquid and drinks it. It is revealed that that was actually the emperor, and Fry now takes that role. But when his life is in danger, he must turn to his friends for help.
8. A Big Piece of Garbage - In an Armageddon spoof, the Professor creates the Smell-O-Scope, which can smell any object in the known universe. When they discover something exaggeratingly foul, the Professor investigates and finds that it's a giant ball of old New York's garbage, which was hurtled into space at the end of the 20th century. Now it's up to the Planet Express crew to blow it up before it hits Earth.
9. Hell Is Other Robots - Bender goes on a bender and gets high on electrical jolts. When his obsession nearly kills the crew, he decides to turn to the Temple of Robology and finds religion. When Bender's new lifestyle drives on the crew's nerves, they reacquaint Bender with his old life. Immediately after, he is banished to Robot Hell, where he faces the devil and endures tortures unimaginable to man.
10. A Flight to Remember - The Professor books the crew on a cruise for their vacation: The Titanic. There, love is aboard where Bender falls for a wealthy Countess robot and Fry charades for both Leela and Amy's boyfriend. But they must make a dash for their lives when the ship approaches a black hole.

11. Mars University - Fry, when finding out by futuristic standards he's only a high school drop-out, enlists at Mars University to drop-out all over again. There, his patience is tested by his roommate, the Professor's experimental super-intelligence monkey, Guenter. Meanwhile, Bender returns to his old robot fraternity, Epsilon Rho Rho, to help the nerds there to be cool.
12. When Aliens Attack - An alien race known as the Omicronians invade Earth, threatening to destroy it unless they see the season finale of the 20th century show ""Single Female Lawyer,"" which was just getting aired there. Fry, who spilled beer on the station console, causing the reception abruption, suggests the crew reenact that episode.

13. Fry and the Slurm Factory - Fry finds the winning bottle cap in a can of Slurm and the crew goes to the planet Wormulon for a VIP tour of the Slurm Factory. Fry, Leela and Bender wander off tour and unexpectedly find out the disgusting secret on why Slurm is so irresistible.
All in all, an excellent DVD set, with hilarious episodes, especially ""A Big Piece of Garbage"" and ""Fry and the Slurm Factory"" being the creme de la creme.",1055462400,2,5806,4.716962524654832

This DVD is amazing. Sometimes as I'm watching it, I prefer to watch it with the audio commentary because, well, you just have to listen for yourself. You'll realize what the artists thought were really really funny and other hidden stuff that you don't know about!
Great easter eggs too!",1053820800,2,333,4.661016949152542
1824844,4,B000083C6W,"If you're looking at the Futurama DVD collection, chances are that you already know that Futurama is a hilarious cartoon. Futurama, from the cracked minds behind the Simpsons, is a world set in the early 31st century (3000s). It follows the crazed antics of the staff of Planet Express, a delivery company founded by a mad scientist to help fund his mad science. Though the series is overshadowed by its half-sibling ""the Simpsons"", it has earned many devoted fans and is in my opinion funnier than the Simpsons. Now, there is one glitch in all this joyous Futurama fun, the DVD menu system. There isn't a play-all function that I could find on the disk. This means that you have to back out to the main menu to play each episode individually. I know this seems like nit picking, but the lack of this feature makes watching the DVDs (three in this pack) less enjoyable than it should be. Perhaps they will fix this problem in the future, maybe not, either way the show is still fantastic and the DVDs are still worth every penny. So, if you like Futurama, or just want something funny and entertaining buy now, otherwise buy something else and leave more copies available for fanatics like me. Just a word of warning, this cartoon, contrary to popular myth, is intended for (semi-)mature audiences. The humor in this series can be dark and/or vulgar, and really isn't for little kids. I'd say nobody under 10 even though the producers didn't get it rated.",1053475200,3,1455,4.665369649805448

In this boxed set, the first 13 episodes are presented. The show was not gut-bustingly funny at first, but it's a visual feast and the stories are great little outer-space adventures with a fun cast. It's a joy to see them without commercial interruptions and especially fun to be able to slow down scenes to catch all the in-jokes that are being thrown around. This boxed set is definitely worth watching and enjoying many times.
 And as for me...one of my favorite characters is Professor Farnsworth... watch for his immortal line, ""Tell them I hate them!"" in the Slurm episode.",1052092800,,906,4.75796178343949

Swim,and not only laughed out loud,but was also hooked into the story line. What would happend to Fry,Bender(my favorite!) and the rest of the crew?IMHO,Futurama is ALOT better than the Simpsons and it's a shame it did not catch on. Probabally because of too many people like me who just thought,""eh"" in the begining.

1824864,5,B000083C6W,"Matt Groening's 'Futurama' is a beast of its own making. Following the overall worldwide and continuing success of 'The Simpsons', a show that changed the face of modern television Groening wanted to attempt another idea he was working with at the same time as 'The Simpsons'. 'Futurama' shares no resemblance with 'The Simpsons' other than character design and a few jokes.
The first season of 'Futurama' was met with a lot of unfair criticism. It was not another Simpson-esque program using many of the same jokes. If it had been, we would have only been able to enjoy 'Futurama' for a few episodes and never heard of it again. If you haven't experienced 'Futurama' the concept is quite simple. Fry, a disgruntled pizza delivery boy from the year 2000 became caught in a cryogenic freezer on New Years Eve only to wake up 1000 years later. Hating the idea of being a delivery boy in the future he ran from the government and found refuge at 'Planet Express' his great, great, great, great, great grand-nephews company, and became an intergalactic delivery boy. Of course there is far more to the series, but I have surmised it for those who know the series.
Most of the humor generated in 'Futurama' is based on the changes the world has gone through in the thousand years Fry had been frozen. This is coupled with the same celebrity voices seen on 'The Simpsons' although every star is a head with no body. When examining the humor of 'Futurama' it can be seen to resemble 'The Simpsons' with far more surrealist humor. Becoming a cross between the before mentioned and an intergalactic 'Monty Python' sketch.
As with 'The Simpsons', 'Futurama' was finding its legs in the show's first season. Characters were being introduced. We slowly learnt about their traits and exploits and most plot lines revolved around the future. In latter seasons as the audience becomes used to the setting the comedy becomes far baser and revolves primarily around the Earth, rather than exploration. This first season contains some fabulous moments; the introduction of Zap Brannagan, the first Futurama song 'Hell is other Robots'. As the examination of a television show's progression this is a must as watching later episodes does not out mode season one, but merely color the series as a whole.
A fabulous DVD backs up the hours of season one. The same brilliant commentary as seen on 'The Simpsons' DVD's, scripts, international clips, story boards etc. This is a must for the DVD collector or and fan of good animation. A crystal clear transfer enables the rich art of 'Futurama' to be enjoyed in the medium is was supposed to; digital animation on a digital medium.
If you enjoy 'Futurama' this is a must have DVD, if you are a fan of 'The Simpsons' but never watched 'Futurama' this is still a good buy, but be warned this is not a program to be looked at like 'The Simpsons' in space, it is it's own entity; the humor is slightly more sophisticated in parts and far more crass in others. Now that 'Futurama' is getting the acclaim it deserves and is not being looked at like another Simpson spin off people are starting to pay attention to what a great series this is. A worthwhile buy!",1050364800,3,3180,4.731531531531531
1824865,5,B000083C6W,"I cannot begin to convey how great this show is.  It is one of only two shows I am aware of that consistently outperform (wit and sarcasm wise) the Simpsons.

This show (along with the also now defunct ""The Family Guy"") packs more laughs, more quick remarks, and more rapid fire writing than any 5 episodes of the Simpsons.  Don't get me wrong, I love the Simpsons.  That being said, Futurama easily takes the animated sitcom into a brave new territory filled with sharp writing, and top-notch comedic animation.  If you haven't seen the show...and judging from the recently announced cancellation, most of you haven't...do your self a favor and grab this DVD.  Then, once you've been hooked, write FOX a very angry and nasty letter telling them you don't think you can take another show like ""The Pitts"" or ""that 80's Show"" while truly great programming like Futurama and The Family Guy die unceremoniously.

1824866,5,B000083C6W,"At last:  my favorite show on DVD!!! It couldn't be better:  the thirteen episodes on this disc set are some of the best ones of the whole series! They're all hilarious, but their story lines are not completely drowned out by the wierdness or ridiculous nature of it's humor, as the case is sometimes with the Simpsons.  The show's characters share some similarities to the Simpsons, but are different in their own ways.
The whole series is a big spoof of outer space and the sci-fi genre, but at the same time, it tells of the journey of a pizza boy from the 20th century, a drunken robot, an orphaned one-eyed girl, and a bunch of other people as they go on various adventures.
The show also employs a lot of more modernized animation techniques, resulting in high-quality video.
As I said, this disc set includes some of the best episodes, including the pilot, the episode where they go on the moon, the one when aliens attack, the slurm factory one, just to name a few.
This show is funny, witty, enjoyable, and is sure to put a smile on your face.  I recommend it to anybody, especially if you've enjoyed the Simpsons!",1049760000,3,1123,4.517241379310345

For humor, Matt Groening can't be beat and for a measly thirty bucks you can laugh ...for hours! This show has it all and pokes fun at every part of life.
For those of us younger folk with a cynical chip on our shoulders, Bender becomes a hero with his sharp wit and put downs.

1824868,4,B000083C6W,"As much as I love ""The Simpsons,"" in recent years, ""Futurama"" has been a much better show. Matt Groening's second TV creation is a wonderful blend of science fiction, comedy and lots of satire, and it also has something that Homer and Bart have been missing for a while -- a lot of heart.
Phillip Fry is a delivery boy who is accidentally frozen for 1,000 years, only to reawaken in a world that has changed more than he ever could have imagined. Neither the hopeless dystopia of most science fiction nor the antiseptic future of Star Trek, ""Futurama"" is actually a future we can believe in, with both its good and bad points. We'll be lucky if the real future is this much fun.
The set, I'm sorry to say, is a little sparse. Besides the 13 first-season episodes you get a few deleted scenes and a short featurette that could have been more.
The best feature on this set, as with the ""Simpsons"" DVDs, are the commentary tracks on every episode by Groening and assorted crew members. Unlike the ""Simpsons,"" the ""Futurama"" commentaries include some of the actors as well. These commentary tracks are almost as much fun as the cartoons themselves.
There's also a cute feature in the image gallery on disc three -- as you're scrolling through various production sketches, you are occasionally given the chance to watch a short clip of Matt Groening discussing the evolution of the characters.
I'm still mad at Fox for not picking up this show after this season. How did they expect to let it pick up ratings if they kept changing its time-slot, eventually settling for a period where it had a 99 percent chance of getting preempted for football games on any given week? But at least I'll always have DVD.",1049673600,2,1700,4.6138613861386135
1824869,5,B000083C6W,"Reviewing the movie: Futurama is the second (and passed away) son of Matt Groening (along with ""The Simpsons""), this show began in 1999 and was a very fresh idea (unfortunatelly, Fox never give the promotion that it deserves and the show was cancelled because the poor ratings), even was fresher than the Simpsons of that same year (the Simpsons began it's falling after the 7th season, and every year is worst that the previous).
Fry is a young that is trapped in a chryogenic case in the New Years eve of the new millenium, and is awaken in the year 3000; he must know new people (because all his family and friends passed away many centuries before) and look for a new job (in the 20th century he was a delivery boy, and in the 30th century he is... yes, a delivery boy).
This show (along with all the animated shows that are broadcast at FOX) is not for kids, it has adult humor with adult situations, so, parents, be aware!
Reviewing the DVD: The package have 3 disc (with all the first season episodes); the video and sound are very good (presented in Full frame, but keep in mind that it's a TV show), the protective case is very cool and original; the extras are good (some deleted scenes, some storyboards and animatics; also, every single episode has an audio commentary from Groening and Co.); the foreign language support is very, very good (not excelent, because the audio comentaries don't have subtitles, or the extras), with audio tracks in english, french and spanish, and subtitles in the same languages, so, if you love the ""Mexican version"" of futurama, you will not get disapointed (maybe the (region 1) Simpsons collection could have this support)
The flaws are minor: The horribly menu (like the Simpsons) and the lack of ""PLAY ALL"" option (like the simpsons)
If you're a fan of this series, you'll not get disapointed

1824880,5,B000083C6W,"I bought Futurama a week ago and I still have not stopped laughing.  I was kind of skeptical to buy it, but Im so glad I did.  I don't know what I'd do without it now.
1. The first episode is the space pilot.  Fry is a delivery boy who delivers a pizza to a cryogenic lab.  He accidently gets frozen.  What I like about this episode is they explain how all the main characters end up together.  Hillarious.
2. Episode two:  Fry and Leela go to the moon to deliver  package.  Bender gets caught up with farmers robot daughters.  Make sure you see the deleted scene for this episode.  I cried laughing so hard.
3.  Episode three is easily one of my favorites.  Fry starts making a mess living in the office and the crew forces him to move. Fry then moves out with Bender. This episode is too funny to explain.
4. Episode four is also another one of my favorites.  The crew gets in trouble doing a tax deductable mission on a collapsing planet.  Leela sleeps with Zap Branigan and you get introduced to nibbler.  Another shining moment for Bender and Fry.
5.episode five starts out the crew is at a Blernsball game.  Bender has to deliver a package to a bot planet where humans are killed.  When bender doesnt come back fry and leela dress up like robots to go and save him.
6. Episode five starts out that in 2000 fry had 93 cents in his bank account and all the interest Fry finds out he is a billionare.  Fry buys anchovies for a riduculous amount of money.(they have been exctinct since 2200).  I love the very beginning of this episode. This episode is absolutley funny.
7. Episode 7 starts out with Bender becomes the ships cook.  Then on a delivery for a planet with 3 suns Fry drinks the planets leader and becomes the leader of the planets only to discover the leader is still alive in his stomache.  Also another hilarious deleted scene.
8. Episode eight New New york discover that a giant ball of garbage is going to destroy the entire city.  The city then goes on a littering frenzy and attempt to rid the ball of garbage with another ball of garbage.  Hillarious.
9.  Bender gets hooked on electricity and then discovers religion.  Bender goes back into his old ways while under his new religion being sent to robot hell.
10. The crew goes on a space cruise called the titanic.  Bender falls in love with a robot while Fry pretends to be in love with Amy and Leela.  My favorite episode.
11. Mars University.  Fry wants to prove he could be a good dropout and is outsmarted by prof. Farnsworths monkey.  Bender helps the robots to his old fraternity become cool again.
12.  Fry destroys the broadcast of a popular TV series in the 20th century.  Aliens invade earth and [plan]to detroy it if they cant see the season finale.  This episode is so funny epecially Benders 3rd camera.
13. Fry finds the instant win bottle cap in his can of Slurm and goes on the tour of the Slurm factory only to discover the disgusting ingredient of slurm.  This one is great!
Overall I have to say this is the best purchase I have made on amazon.com without a doubt.  There is no doubt that I will buy the second season when it comes out on DVD. Do yourself a favor and buy this.",1049500800,4,3170,4.36068376068376

Other than that there are a few (very few) deleted scenes and an alternate audio commentary on every episode.  In the later episodes they seem to run out of things to talk about or comment on.  Wish I could have been there to prod a few questions for them.

1824883,4,B000083C6W,"...but this is the best thing to come since, well, the Simpsons, though it doesn't seem that anybody realizes it.  It was a refreshing change of pace around that time, as though Simpsons was still great it was becoming a bit stale and hackneyed in plots.  Much of Futurama isn't only funny, but thought-provoking and sometimes even a bit dark and disturbing.  The first season has more than its share of these moments, which make it strikingly difficult from the Homer-has-some-crazy-scheme formula the Simpsons has fallen into lately.
It's also probably the most finely animated thing ever to be on television, utilizing 3D effects in the animation ahead of its time.  The amount of detail in every scene is astounding, and like with classic Simpsons episodes there are sight gags you won't catch unless you look very carefully.
Despite being a great show and wonderful that it's finally shown up on DVD (might get the exposure it deserves now), there's some caveats with the overall package that make me kick the rating down a notch.  Knowing the show's penchant for 3D animations, some lavish 3D menus in the beginning would've been very nice (Fox and Matt Groeining's studios definitely have the capacity for this).  Instead, there's still backgrounds just like the Simpsons Season 1 and 2 DVD's.  They do include some nice extras, like commentary on all 13 episodes and a behind-the-scene feature, but it would've been nice to see so much more, like more cast interviews maybe, or a longer behind-the-scenes (the one included is woefully short).  Some DVD-ROM extras like games, even, would've been nice.  For such a stellar show it shouldn't have gotten anything less than star treatment.  As is, however, it's definitely worth picking up, but will leave you wondering what it could've been.
In any case, it's a shame this never got the support it truly deserved, as with Family Guy it really presented something unique, creative, and slightly twisted all at the same time.  Hopefully it'll have its chance now.  It was something that, when compared to the mass amounts of garbage churned out, was really intelligent, whimsical, and new.  If you're a fan of The Simpsons, have seen this show a couple of times and are wanting more, or are a fan of great animation, you owe it to yourself to buy this.",1049328000,3,2306,4.8820512820512825
1824884,5,B000083C6W,"The first season of Futurama is an absolute classic, and it gets a great DVD treatment.  First off, the sound and video are wonderfully clear and vivid.  This is a show with bright, often garish colors and sound effects, and typical TV broadcast quality just doesn't give it the justice it gets here.  I never realized just how cool the opening theme is until I heard it, bass line and all, through decent speakers.  Obviously, Groening and crew put alot of thought and energy into the sound design, and it takes on a whole new depth here, even though it's only mastered for Dolby 2.0.
The picture is crisp and clear, which is to be expected, since the show is largely digitally produced.  The 3D animation is particularly rich--the space battle in ""When Aliens Attack"" comes off just as exhilirating as anything Lucas has done lately, and it's amazing how the hand-drawn and computer elements fit together so seamlessly.
Each episode has commentary with Matt Groening, as well as artists and directors for the episode.  This has to be the best feature of the set.  Since this is so much more recent than the first Simpsons season, the details are fresh in everybody's minds, and their comments are often insightful.  They often go into great detail about not only the technical aspects of each episode, but all the cult references and hidden in-jokes as well.  Early on, Groening says that this is the show he's always wanted to do, and it's obvious that he's not only pulled it off, but he's glad to share every minute piece of trivia he can about the process.
It also bears mentioning that this set includes the 13 original first-season *production* episodes, as opposed to just the nine that were aired during the first season (and described in a review above).  The four additional episodes were produced in the first season but not shown until the second because of Fox's abysmal treatment of the show.
The episodes are:
""A Flight to Remember"":  A hilarious send-up of Titanic.
""Mars University"":  Fry enrolls in college to prove he's smarter than Farnsworth's experimental monkey, and Bender returns to his old fraternity to wreak mischief.
""When Aliens Attack"":  Lrrr of Omicron Persei 8 threatens to destroy the earth unless ""Single Female Lawyer,"" a 20th-century TV show he loves, is returned to the air.  This one's a classic, boasting references to everything from Star Wars to Independence Day to War of the Worlds.  (Oh, and Ally McBeal)  This, along with ""Fear of a Bot Planet,"" is an absolute geek's dream.
""Fry and the Slurm Factory"":  A great parody of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.

1824887,5,B000083C6W,"I was very excited in 1999 when Futurama premiered, a far-out, unofficial spin-off of The Simpsons. Created by Simpsons' brainiac Matt Groening and former Simpsons producer David Cohen, Futurama is a hilarious glimpse into the future of Earth in the Year 3000.
The core characters of hapless hero Fry, sexy one-eyed alien (mutant) Leela, and degenerate robot Bender make the foundation for a great ensemble rivaled only, perhaps, by The Simpsons themselves.
The series, though winding down on Fox, is finding new life on cable and through the DVD set. I'm anxiously awaiting Season 2.
It's not just a great cartoon: It's terrific TV. And the DVD, chock full of extras (including delicious commentary from Groening, Cohen and others) is a terrific buy.",1048982400,,751,5.1138211382113825
1824888,5,B000083C6W,"Your sure to love every episode of Matt Groening's greatest series, of course next to many of the Simpson episodes.
One thing that this series of cartoons had going for it, was that it hit the trail running with loads of laughs right from episode one.  Not like many other series on TV, which can take a season or two (sometimes 3 or 4) to really start to pick up a fan base and have good stories to really keep you coming back for more.
The disappointing fact about the series right now was all the confusing speculation of it getting canceled.  We only have the Fox executive idiots to blame for that.  I guess it was too good for them to try and keep it going much.  And don't let them tell you that ratings never really took off for it.  They were the problem, what with them moving it around and it constantly getting pre-empted by stupid sports and other programs.  Those of us fans who wanted to make sure we could watch every episode every time, were always waiting with baited breath to see if it was actually gonna show up each week.  Basically it was put into an odd cycle of maybe on for a week or two, then off for 3 or 4 weeks, then maybe one episode again and off for another 2 or 3, and so on and so on and so on.  You couldn't really tell.  And moving it to different days now and then didn't help either.  They never really gave it much chance.  Despite the fact it still has such a fan base all over the place.  So feel free to make your major complaints to the Fox ding bats about their abilities to organize and stick with a schedule for once.
The only thing not good about this DVD set is it only has 13 episodes.  Really guys, you could have included more, but I guess maybe they wanted to just test the water and see if the DVD would fly.  But also having released a general date for the 2nd season already, gives you an indication they want to maybe try and crank them out to try and shovel in the money.  Finally they want to try and release there products out to the general market on a more faster basis and not make us just sit on our hands.  Like the Simpson's episodes.  They hardly let anything out on VHS for years and years, and a few years back they started releasing a few favorite compilations, which didn't take off too well.  We were waiting for whole season sets.  And finally they got into DVD for one season, and then finally last year they got around to the second season.  But of course I don't really see them flying off the shelves, being it's just that, the first 2 seasons.  They were fine and dandy at the time, but seem more dry and stale compared to the newer episodes now a days.  Which brings me back to the point of Futurama having such great laughs from episode one and haven't stopped.  Who knows what goes through the brains of Fox Executives (other than a brick that is, LOL).
Enjoy all the Laughs!  And be sure to let everyone at Cartoon Network know how much you love Futurama, to keep them going on that network for years to come.  Who know's, maybe we could encourage them to pick it up and produce it themselves in some licensing deal, and we could get loads of more laughs.  Wishful thinking, I know, but you never know.
BENDER TO RULE THE WORLD!!!",1048982400,,3212,4.216039279869067
1824889,5,B000083C6W,"Back when Futurama debuted it was looking like the perfect successor to the Simpsons, which by 1999 was running out of steam after many stupendous years. As a longtime Matt Groening fanatic I would have been happy to watch the Simpsons come to a dignified end while it was still at the height of its powers, so Futurama could carry the torch for the next decade or so. Alas, no props are deserved by the Fox network for allowing the awesome Futurama to die a lonely death in ratings hell. But this great DVD set for the first season broadcasts loud and clear what could have been. Utilizing the standard sci-fi method of using a futuristic society to comment on our current state (or more often to poke fun at it), the series features eye-catching computerized 3-D animation and incredibly well written and subversive storylines. And just like all Groening creations the characters are robust and fully realized. In addition to the stars, such as Bender who is probably the most hysterical character ever created, we also get great and under-appreciated supporting characters like Zap Branigan, Kif, and Dr. Zoidberg.
Unlike the Simpsons which needed a first developmental season to really get its groove going, Futurama started full blast right from the first episode, in which the 20th century dork Fry wakes up in the year 3000 and tries not to be a loser in another millennium. While I never much liked the talking 20th century heads in jars (indicators of a certain lack of hardcore creativity, in my opinion), the 30th century society of Futurama has much to teach us in these early episodes. Corporate power and corruption are lampooned twice this season in ""A Fishful of Dollars"" and the brilliant ""Fry and the Slurm Factory,"" fad religions are tackled in ""Hell Is Other Robots,"" and there's even a condemnation of our current environmental attitudes in ""A Big Piece of Garbage."" The DVD extras aren't too much to get excited about, although the audio commentary accompanying each episode (by Groening and the show's other creators) is a real treat if you're looking for collector's trivia and the inspiration behind the characters and storylines. I will enjoy this DVD set for the next thousand years and hope Fox can get the remaining seasons out quickly. It's the least they could do, after letting this work of genius go to waste.",1048982400,5,2342,4.8575
1824900,4,B000083C6W,"I wanted to give five stars, really I did, but I have to reveiw this as a whole:

The packaging rocks! A slide down cover with windows over a case printed with an incredible New New York panorama that holds three slim cases for the dvds. The slim cases are just such a great idea, why do they use the standard size cases in boxed sets? The art work is superb on the cases, inside and out, and on the disks themselves.

The show is one of my favorites. The mix of reverence and irrevernce for all science fiction that has come before it makes ""Futurama"" one of the most interesting, and funiest shows on tv. Fry a 20th century pizza delivery boy accidently getting frozen in 1999 and waking up in 2999 (""A million years!"" Fry's math skills at work), and becoming of all things a delivery boy. With nothing considered sacred, or taken too seriously (how can seriously can you take talking heads in jars) the jokes are fast and furious. Inevitable comparisons to ""The Simpsons"" will be made (Matt Groening being creator of both,) but the characters and situations are so different and diverse that ""Futurama"" stands very well on its own, thank you.

Okay, why only four stars: Nothing to do with the show itself, definatly five stars all around there. The missing star is due to technical/content ommisions.

First: There's no 'Play All' function on the disks. I'm sorry, but they've dropped this ball on both ""The Simpsons"" releases, and now ""Futurama"". I don't know about you, but I seldom sit down to watch one episode of a show, and to have to exit out of one set of episode menus, and enter into another, every time I want to watch another show, well its annoying.

Second: The commentaries. pretty good and informitive for the frist few shows, but they must've taped them all in a day, because the pauses get longer, and the commentary duller as the shows go on. It seems to be a cross between the people watching shows they haven't seen for awhile, and getting wrapped up in them, and these same people searching their brains for some relevent anicdote for the episode they're watching.

Third: (This one is iffy) Mention is made of Phil Hartman actually auditioning for 'Zap Branigan'. If a tape of this exisists, why isn't it on the disks? If it doesn't then my appologies.

To sum up, I bought this set, I will by future sets, I just wish they had a 'Play All' funtion, so I could let loose with the five stars.",1048982400,2,2418,4.506849315068493

1824906,5,B000083C6W,"""Futurama,"" the genius creation of Matt Groening has finally come to DVD after a lengthy wait.  As many may know, Groening is the man behind the legacy of ""The Simpsons.""  To me though, ""Futurama"" is an amazing cartoon and I think it is one of the must-have boxed sets of 2003.  The show itself is stacked with many pop-culture references, gags, jokes, good humour, great animation, wonderful story-lines and just a great premise.  The basic premise of the show is that Fry, a 20th century delivery boy down on his luck winds up in the 30th century due to a New Year's Eve prank.  His arrival and place in history, or in our case the future are laid out in the first episode ""Space Pilot 3000.""  In the first episode the primary characters are introduced in turn from Bender to Hermes through to Dr. Zoidberg and Prof. Farnsworth (owner of Planet Express and a nephew of Fry's).  Over the remaining episodes of the season (there are 13 in total) Fry and the other members of the Planet Express team find themselves traveling throughout the universe having many wonderfully-zany adventures.  For example in Episode 2: ""The Series Had Landed"" Fry gets to travel to the moon only to discover that it has been transformed into an amusement park.  Despite the glitz and glamour of it all, he is keen on seeing the moon he grew up loving.  Epsiode 3: ""I, Roommate"" has Fry and Bender move in together.  Will the friendship be able to over-come a few differences?  Episode 6: ""A Fishfull of Dollars"" has Fry discover that he has become a billionaire as a result of a thousand years of compounding interest.  Does the money last or will Fry go broke again?  Episode 10: ""A Flight to Remember"" features a Titanic-esque type of plot with Bender as the lowly peasant falling in love with the Countess.  Will this Titanic suffer the same fate as the original?  Episode 11: ""Mars University"" sees Fry enroll in university to show he is able to drop-out with the best of them.  At the same time Bender assits his old fraternity in typical university warfare.  Episode 12: ""When Aliens Attack"" has the Omicrons threatening to destroy Earth unless they see the final episode of a show that Fry used to watch back in the 20th Century.  Will the Omicrons get their wish or is Earth doomed?  Episode 13: ""Fry and the Slurm Factory"" features a contest that has Fry and his companions win to have a tour of the Slurm Factory.  What we get is a wonderful Willy Wonka type of parody and who can forget the Grunga-Lungas?  :-)  The remaining episodes in the season are just as wonderful and the pop-culture references are just as superb. Even the celebrity cameos (as heads in jars) are a sight to behold.  The special features on the discs are also quite superior.  Commentary is available on each of the episodes and is wonderful, the deleted scenes provide for many a laugh, the animatics are interesting to see and even the concept art gallery is quite insightful.  Matt Groening has done it again, but it's just unfortunate that Fox didn't give the show the respect it deserved.  Season 1 is a real treat to behold.  Any fan of ""The Simpsons"" or ""Family Guy"" should acquire this set.  Additionally if you love pop-culture references and just enjoy a good laugh, Futurama is just what the doctor, and I don't mean Zoidberg.  :-)  Futurama is one of the classic shows of our times and should not be missed.

1824907,5,B000083C6W,"Now, before you start thinking odd things about me for enjoying animation while I am slowly whittling through the latter part of my third decade, and before you get outraged that a priest would be watching such a, uh, cutting-edge program. . .
Futurama is by far the smartest animated program I have ever watched.  Now don't get me wrong, you're still not going to use all that knowledge from high school Trig class (you know, the class that the teacher said would help you make it big) and the scientific method certainly does not apply to Futurama, but this program is quite wide in scope and find a way to poke serious fun at the past 100 years of film. . . especially sci-fi.
When virtually the entire cast of Star Trek, a sitting Vice President, other famous celebrities, and Blinky the Three-Eyed Fish show up on your television program, it's probably a really good program.
Futurama is, however, adult entertainment (no, not THAT kind of adult entertainment. . . but there is a lot of great music!).  Don't let your kids near it until they are, oh, married and have two children - or at least until they are sixteen (your choice).
Trust me, while Futurama is from time to time rather racy and the humor often appeals to baser instincts, the program is wonderful.  And if you don't like what I've had to say, ""You can bite my shiny metal"". . . oh wait, I'm not Bender.

But even in that,there's not a lot of seperation between left and right,and a lot of times,the music is coming out of the center speaker! C'mon! Even The Simpsons Season 1 had a better sound mix than this!
 Like I said,it's just a minor complaint,which hopefully will be rectified by season 2. Fellow tone freaks will understand.

1824909,5,B000083C6W,"I picked up the Futurama DVD today, and was glad to see that the set contains the entire first season which was PRODUCED, not broadcast. So in addition to the nine episodes that aired in ""season one"" (spring of 1999) on Fox, the first four episodes that aired in season two are included as well: A Flight to Remember, Mars University, When Aliens Attack, and Fry and the Slurm Factory. While the show has aired--sporadically--since spring of 1999, only four seasons (72 episodes) were produced. You can check out more specific information about what episodes should have ""really"" been in seasons 2, 3, and 4 on epguides.com/futurama
As far as the show itself, if you've watched Futurama, you probably already know if you want the collection. While I haven't had time to go through all of the discs yet, the extras do seem a bit sparse. There are a few deleted scenes, a brief (5-minute) promo video found on disc 3, and a relatively skimpy design gallery (also on disc 3). It is interesting to see the progression of sketches for characters, and also to learn that Hermes was originally named Dexter (?!?). There is (according to the box; I haven't had time to check them all out yet) full commentary on each and every episode, which should make up for any shortcomings in other bonus materials.
Picture quality is nice and clear, as well as sound (although it's only Dolby surround). One of the greatest advantages to having the series on DVD is to get a good, clear freeze-frame to take in every detail and hidden joke. In summary, if you like Futurama, you know you want it, so get the DVD. If not, you can bite Bender's shiny metal . . . well, you know.",1048550400,6,1657,4.582491582491582

However, I can thoroughly recommend this DVD; the picture quality is great (although not widscreen unfortunately) and the 5.1 sound is very clear.
I actually much prefer Futurama to The Simpsons (although the early episodes of the Simpsons are great); it's far wittier and the humour is much more grown-up which, come to think of it, is probably why it bombed.
So if you already like the Simpsons, but are not too keen on the later 'dumbed down' episodes (series 3 and beyond, then) and you're also into a bit of Sci-Fi (or if you think Sci-Fi is really stupid) then this is definitely for you!",1047513600,6,752,4.371428571428571

All because Rupert Murdock thought I'd rather watch FOX Sports. Jerk.
Having seen most of them now, I can only say my esteem for Matt Groening has increased threefold; once for having created something consistently funny like 'The Simpsons', twice for the more disturbing but funnier 'Life in Hell' strips (yes I read these first, but few probably know what these are), and thirdly for 'Futurama'.
Every in-joke, every snide remark, every question you might have had about how the future might turn out if you were convinced it would be just as screwed-up as today...it's all here.
Favorite character: latecomer Scruffy the Janitor.
Favorite Episode: When Leela finds another Cyclops who turns out to be an imposter. Plus 'Married With Children' reference. Bonus!

1824923,5,B000083C6W,"This is one of the greatest series ever on television, unfortunately it had too much going against it:
1.  It was expected to be a huge hit.  It took ""The Simpsons"" a couple of years to catch their stride and come up with consistently funny episodes.  ""Futurama"" had to be either a tremendous hit or it would die...
2.  Which leads to the second point - why oh why did Fox put it on Sundays at 7:00 PM and have delayed and postponed by NFL Football?  For some reason in their programming, they always scheduled the games to end at 7:00 but very rarely did.  This made seeing Futurama in the fall a tough proposition at best, making it impossible to get into the ""habit"".
3.  Quite honestly, the show was just written for a select audience.  This is not a show for everybody - if you didn't grow up in the '60s and '70s then many of the jokes and concepts will probably fall flat.
Despite these hinderances, Futurama is a terrific show with some very unexpectedly funny things going on as well as some surprisingly sensitive shows.  I would have liked more than three seasons, but what we got was pretty good.

1824924,5,B000083C6W,"How did this show survive for five seasons? Fox criminally mistreated it, giving it the often pre-empted post-football time spot and rarely providing  the promotion it deserved. Yet, somehow, someway, it found an audience...just not enough of one to prevent its cancellation. Alas, after 2003, ""Futurama"" is no more...but fans like myself can now enjoy it over and over again thanks to the magic of DVD. This has been available in Europe for some time, where it has sold well...another sign of its potential popularity. The ultimate question remains, ""Was the cancellation merited? Is this show just a ""Simpsons"" wannabe?""
Absolutely not!
""Futurama"" may have come from the mind of ""Simpsons"" creator Matt Groening, but that's where the similarities end. The humor here is more idiosyncratic, part character-based, part social commentary, largely adult and mature, but able to stoop to the occasional gross-out gag (sonic diarrhea, anyone?) or sexual reference without losing perspective. Ultimately, it is a commentary on our times using the future as a touchpoint--or more accurately, a comedic year-2000-or-so concept of the future that also borrows from previous visions of the far future: the optimism of the space age era and the pessimism of 80s cyberpunk, the former embodied in the wacky retro-animation design of flying cars, buildings with rings, and easy space travel, the latter personified in the cheerful nihilism of suicide booths and dominating, ruthless multinational (and multiplanetary) corporations (I.e., MomCorp). Relevance is maintained through clever use of guest stars (still alive in Y3K as heads in jars) and frequent digs at 20th and 21st century culture. Another asset: The innovative use of computer-assisted animation (mostly on the Planet Express ship) gives the animation a smooth and even feel.
Season One features some of the best episodes of the show's run: Fry becomes emperor of a planet of water people in ""My Three Suns,"" and when his stupidity and stubbornness gets him into trouble, his friends find a unique...and appropriate...solution. In ""Love's Labors Lost in Space,"" Leela has the misfortune of meeting Zapp Brannigan (think Kirk, Riker, and Dr. Smith all rolled into one), and the greater misfortune of sleeping with him. The second episode, ""The Series Has Landed"" features a trip to the moon, something Fry has always wanted...and something the others have done so often, they take it for granted. We see the original moon lander (replaced by nit-pickers, a sign says) and Bender falls prey to the charms of a moon farmer's daughter (a huge robot called ""the Crushinator""...ah, l'amour). Here we also learn of Bender's little secret: magnetic fields screw up his inhibition unit and reveal his secret desire to be a folk singer (later realized in Season Three with ""Bendin' in the Wind"").""Fear of a Bot Planet"" (a reference to a Public Enemy CD) finds Fry and Leela disagreeing with Bender on how humans treat robots, only to find themselves on a planet where robots rule, and humans are killed on sight. (Clever references in this episode: The robot planet is called Capek, which is a reference to playwright Karel Capek, who wrote an extraordinary play about robots (""R.U.R"".), and two robots on the planet sound an alert using voices from the old video game ""Berzerk.""). And Bender finds religion in ""Hell is Other Robots,"" featuring Dan Castellaneta, the Beastie Boys, and a very funny musical number (plus a great reference to an old Charlie Daniels song).
Ultimately, what this DVD set will prove is that Futurama had limitless potential for a long and fruitful run, had it only been treated with some measure of respect. I suspect, though, that this DVD (and future DVDs), coupled with reruns on cable, will allow people to see how funny and innovative this series really was. Now, if only the powers that be could have seen it that way...
(One question, though: If aliens destroyed all the buildings in Old New York (as seen through the window during the time progression in the first episode), why was the cryogenics building not destroyed?

1824925,5,B000083C6W,I love this show it just recently started coming on cartoon networks adult swim. anyone who like the simpsons will love futurama. Matt Groening is a genius. youll love this show,1043884800,,177,4.741935483870968
1824926,5,B000083C6W,"I like this show a lot and am really going to miss it when it's gone, which, I fear, is soon.  And do you know what else?  I am very annoyed that it is going.  One cannot blame Fox for giving up on the ratings starved show, can it?  Well I can.  I blame Fox for stranding the show at 7:00 on Sunday evening.  Few shows can survive against the ratings juggernaut 60 Minutes, even shows that do not seem to attract the same audience.  Plus, there was never anything of interest between in the half hour between Futurama and creator Matt Groening's other show, The Simpsons.  Viewers were expected to tune in with no lead-in and nothing afterward.  And 8:30, directly after The Simpsons would have been the perfect slot.  It would be a great counterpart to the latter program.  But what was there instead?  King of the Hill.  I used to hate King, but it has recently grown on me.  But that is not the point.  The point is that King has long ago built up enough of an audience that it did not need the cushy post-Simpsons slot.  Futurama did and does.  But no, Fox strands the show in no-man's-land and then acts surprised and cancels it when nobody watches.  Gee.
But maybe I'm being too hard on the network.  Let's look at the show.  Granted, it's not a family-based show like The Simpsons.  The family show is a TV staple for good reason.  People like it.  But there is a familial element to the program.  While only two of the characters are actually biologically related, there is a bond among the cast that is undeniable.  And there is a definite drama to the program.  In fact, I believe there are more touching, heart-tugging moments in Futurama than in The Simpsons (in percentage, not in quantity.  With nine seasons fewer than the latter program, a higher amount of said moments would be quite a feat).  I was touched in ""Luck of the Fryish"" when Fry finds out the truth about his brother.  I welled up in the closing montage of ""Leela's Homeworld"" when Leela's parents' love is displayed.  And I welled up again in the closing montage of ""Jurassic Bark"", but for different, more bittersweet reasons, when Fry's dog's obedience and patience are tried.  But don't think it's all tears.  Futurama's humor is similar to that of The Simpsons from its broad handed silliness to its subtle jabs.  It also boasts the satire and parody of Groening's other show.  Futurama is an extremely intelligent program.
I am grateful for the many laughs I have (and with 72 episodes existing, when all is said and done, there are a lot) and all the great quotes I will undoubtedly add to my vernacular.  There are numerous shows that are cut down without given enough of a chance.  With the short patience of networks these days, there will be many more (if you doubt that networks are less likely to keep shows around than they used to, I advise you to check out Seinfeld Season 1.  Do you really think NBC would continue airing the show after that train wreck?  But aren't you glad they did?).  But of all the shows to go out at or before their prime, I think I will miss Futurama the most.  Cue touching musical montage.",1043884800,19,3111,4.475935828877005

Futurama premiered during the 1998-1999 season, touted as a show ""from the creators of The Simpsons."" ""Futurama,"" (a title I can only imagine as a throwback to antiquated formations of different words to be hip i.e. ""Skateorama,"" or ""Surforama"") began slowly, offering a slightly askew style that Simpsons fans and regular audiences had to take notice of, regardless of whether they liked it or not. The character design seemed comfortable and familiar, but most Simpsons fans were asking, ""Why do they have flesh-colored skin?"" The Simpsons characters are, of course, different shades of yellow. And it was a sight to see a cartoon spaceship fly and spin around with the obvious but very slick help of computer animation. In every episode, audiences were given visual treats with the use of computer 3D applied to the hand-drawn look. Newer technology was being applied to a show that had a familiar feel to it, demonstrating that the future DOES look different and things WORK differently in the future, but people remain the same. Earth is not a happy paradise in the future like some would imagine. It is still a world where the rich get richer, blue-collar workers still fuel business, and there just seems to be strange characters everywhere! Modern American audiences can still relate to the main characters, making the stories of ""Futurama"" simply timeless.
It was a show that was doing more in the area of design and complexity. The ""universe"" was established within a few episodes, showing that 20th century celebrities still exist in the year 3000, though only as heads in a jar (allowing for guest appearances of famous people as Themselves), aliens and robots and humans live and work on Earth, and intergalactic travel was common, among many others.
The show had one other thing that was slowly being phased out of ""The Simpsons:"" stories with substance. The characters Fry, Leela, Bender, the Professor and the rest were, of course, brand new, so seeing them develop as the season continued was a lot of fun. The character relationships were unique. Fry befriended a smart and bitter bending robot (Bender), developed a crush for a one-eyed alien (Leela), and looked for guidance from his great-great-great-great-great grand-nephew who was over 100 years old (Prof. Farnsworth). And Fry himself was not too bright, but he stood behind his convictions. The characters all teetered on the absurd, while demonstrating recognizable and enduring human qualities. There is a character for every fan to relate to, whether they personified a character, or knew someone just like a character. Getting fresh characters with dynamic personalities, combined with thoughtful and innovative stories was a welcome change to the gags and jokes ""The Simpsons"" was beginning to employ. The humor reflected that of ""The Simpson's'"" heyday (seasons 3-8), using satire and deliciously clever timing to get a laugh. An example from another season featured an evil commander who was mass-producing Lucy Liu clones who found his plans being threatened. In a typical Hollywood fashion, the commander stands in front of a control panel and says dramatically, ""I will give them all the Lucy Liu's they want!"" Instead of hitting the big red button that everyone expects, he hits ""Control"" and then ""K"" on a keyboard. Hilarious!
What is interesting is that satire reflects attitudes and ideals of the day; with the intelligent writing, ""Futurama"" used satire time and again, but set it in the year 3000! That was the genius of it!
Each episode and character will grow on you and by the end you will be glad to have this DVD set in your collection. The show always struggled to find its audience, especially on the East Coast when FOX had football on Sundays. Why FOX never programmed both shows back-to-back is a complete mystery, but the series will have withstood five years before it will finally expire in May of 2003. Five years, struggling to find and hold an audience, is very impressive. The show could have had the longevity of ""The Simpsons,"" but FOX seemed happy with Groening's first series and never pushed ""Futurama"" as hard. Now, as ""The Simpsons"" becomes a product of silly gags, ludicrous one-liners, and ridiculous adventure-type stories, all lacking the attitude and satire and substance, fans can look to ""Futurama"" to satisfy their need for intelligent and side-splitting stories. One day, fans will have 70-some episodes of ""Futurama,"" hopefully all reaching DVD by 2005. As they come out, pick up ""The Simpsons"" DVDs from Amazon.com, and you will see the similarities. Stories with substance. Intelligent humor. Fun characters. This is what ""The Simpsons"" had up until season 9, and it is what ""Futurama"" had during its entire run.
If you are a fan of ""The Simpsons,"" or once was, ""Futurama"" season 1 is a must-have!",1042675200,29,4940,5.040342298288508
1824928,5,B000083C6W,"The futurama season 1 and 2 box sets are both available on Amazon.co.uk, and I have them both. They are both fantastic and the extra features are magnificent. Including directors commentary with the director and most of the cast memebers for every episode! They both come in an acetate box set, and the second season comes with 4 dvd's in the set. I recommended them, you won't be disappointed.",1041552000,10,394,4.72463768115942
1824929,5,B000083C6W,"I just love Futurama - I already own Series one and two on DVD (on region 2) and I can just say they are amazing ... I can watch them again and again ... Personally Futurama is my favorite TV-show and I can never get tired of them. The quality of each episode is to die for (or at least I think) ... considering the limited quality you get on VHS.
So I highly recommend this product ... for your inner child that's growing up
sincerely,

7978676,5,B000083C6W,"It's Futurama. Not only does the first season's episodes stand well on their own, but they set up gags and plotlines that continue through years (they planned this stuff out!). Better yet, the DVD volume has plenty of features- deleted scenes, etc, including interesting commentary about the production on each episode. Note- the accessibility of this content is a bit hidden, for some reason. Rather than looking for it under ""Special Features"" or the episode menu, you have to play the episode and then change audio tracks (hopefully you have that option) past English, French, and Spanish until you get to another English option where you'll start hearing the commentary.",1516579200,2,674,5.136363636363637
