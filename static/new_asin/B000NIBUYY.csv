2768976,3,B000NIBUYY,"Anytime a Lee Van Cleef Euro-Western makes it to video, it's an occasion.  When it makes it in perfect, pristine condition, it's a special occasion.  This Amazon.com exclusive was duplicated by MGM/UA, so the picture quality is excellent.  Many of Van Cleef's Italian westerns are duplicated from bad 16mm prints, not so here.  This is third in the Sabata series.  Van Cleef appeared in the original United Artists feature Sabata, which was followed by Addios, Sabata with Yul Brenner (his only Italian western).  The plot about Sabata, gunslinger turned sideshow performer after $5,000 owed to him, is so-so.  It's a two star film at best, but the quality of the video brings it up to three stars.  NOTE TO AMAZON.COM:  let's get more of these films available to us through your arrangement with MGM/UA.",1005696000,12,804,4.940298507462686

8177857,4,B000NIBUYY,"The 1971 Return of Sabata is the third in the Sabata series and arguably the least enjoyable, although still worthwhile watching. Viewers like me, who enjoy spaghetti westerns, beginning with Lee Van Cleff, followed by Yul Brynner in 1970, followed by Cleff again in this film, and then by Clint Eastwood, will enjoy this one; that is, as long as they want to see much non-stop action, and are not bothered by a lot of stuff that is unrealistic because it is fun. The reason I gave the film only four stars is that I felt there was too-much laughter in the film. The attempt to add humor was overdone. In this film, two men are taking advantage of a town to take as much money from its citizens as possible. Amazon does a very good job of describing the film and I will say no more, except Cleff ties to take the money from the two and their gang, while giving the city back most of what he gets.
What is a spaghetti western what we can expect to see in this film beside action, most of which is unusual and (to me) humorous?
A spaghetti western is a western unlike those made in the US. There is the iconic music, the long stares by the actors, long pauses between speeches, the lips of the Italian actors moving not in sync with what they are saying, strange cloths, the same actors appearing in each although in different roles, the wearing of a blanket over clothes (but not in this film) that resembles but is not the same as US western clothes, one man speaking as if he has a bundle of gravel in his throat (very deep), strange characters, strang guns, and double crosses.
I like all three actors who play the main character, and Eastwood above all.",1471132800,2,1656,4.3624595469255665

8177863,1,B000NIBUYY,"Lee Van Cleef displays his usual stylish and commanding presence. One can easily infer that Angel Eyes,(from The Good, The Bad & The Ugly) could have evolved into Sabata had he lived. His performance is a joy for his fans.

The entire Sabata Trilogy, however, rarely approaches coherency. Conversations consist of random cliches that bear no relation to the storyline. Scenes and character affect are illogicaly strung together as if the director went on many vacations and forgot where he left off. (One minute Sabata is 40' from a posse, the next he's miles away.) The musical ""score"" blares at dramatic cactii. Characters frequently share a laugh at jokes they never bothered to share with the audience.
'
""Return of Sabata"" is noteworthy, however, for having the worst theme song ever written. It's hard to say if this was deliberate, but if it was, they succeeded admirably.",1327708800,,879,4.979591836734694
8177864,2,B000NIBUYY,"The third in the series cannot hold a candle to the original Sabata. And is obviously shot on a much smaller budget and scale then the flawed Adios Sabata.

In 'Return of Sabata' Van Cleef and most of the original cast from Sabata are back but have the thankless task of trying to keep a somewhat dull and confusing film on track. They almost manage it. The opening theme song is typical of the problems with the film. Like the film - you don't know how to take the song. Is it unintentionally inept and silly or purposely tongue in cheek, campy or meant as joke? There are too many paterns and ideas started and then dropped - it seems the film makers were trying to be too much for too many.  The plot is for the most part incomprehensible.  All this said - there are still some clever twists, gimmicks and enough color and humor to keep you entertained. The entire cast is very good.  Its also one of the last Van Cleef films of some quality.  Stylistically there appears to be some Mario Bava influence - especially on the way the action is filmed and colorful lighting used in a very clever opening scene. Too bad the film makers did not chose to keep this up for the rest of the film.

It is ludicrous that Harry & Michael Medved chose Return of Sabata to be one of their ""The Fifty Worst Films of All Time."" Did Van Cleef snub them?...hmmmm -

The film stock - crispness, contrast, and color - is excellent. The sound quality - although mono is top grade and full bodied and almost devoid of hiss. There are no extras.",1186876800,4,1525,4.311188811188811
