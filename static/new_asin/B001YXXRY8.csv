Plus mod band Secret Affair I think. And an excellent Pretenders rehearsal. What saves it for me is the 'women in rock' part that has classic Siouxsie and the Banshees footage with John McGeoch on guitar which is priceless! Overall I'd recommend the Punk in London documentary over this.",1394496000,,451,4.65
8348212,5,B001YXXRY8,"I had seen this documentary on VHS about ten years ago.  It is a great snapshot of the British punk/new wave scene around 1979, or 1980, I beleive.  It features good footage of the Clash and the Jam, very cool footage of the Pretenders rehearsing (you can instantly see how tight they were), and an extensive look at the ska revival, featuring great footage of the Selector, the Specials and Madness.  Oh to have been a youth in Britain during the 2nd half of the 70's.  Huff.

Also, there is a fantastic extra on the dvd focusing on some of the female (or female led) bands of the time.  There is terrific footage of Siouxsie and the Banshees, the Slits and some other rocker type girl band whom I did not recognized and which would now be refered to as ""riot girls"".

Overall, this is simply a very cool video and a must have for anyone interested in the 70's British punk/new wave movement.",1375315200,,893,4.408536585365853
