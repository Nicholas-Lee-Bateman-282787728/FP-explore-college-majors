2293253,3,B0009IWGFU,"""Robinson Crusoe Of Clipper Island"" stars Ray Mala....a famous actor/ cameraman half Eskimo (his mom) and half Jewish (his Dad).

Ray Mala's birth name was ""Ray Wise,"" and his father was a Jewish man who moved to Alaska in pre-WWI years and married an Eskimo (Innuit, native American) lady.  ""Ray Wise"" was their handsome son who worked as a movie actor and a cameraman until his early death in the 1950's.  An interesting Wikipedia biography profile about him is worth reading.

His very best movie was ""Eskimo"" (1933) directed by the legendary W. S. Van Dyck (who directed the most famous ""Tarzan"" movie of the 1930's, probably the most famous of all Tarzan movies).

One must see the ""Eskimo"" (1933) movie to see Ray Mala at his best, but sadly it is not available widely or easily. I was lucky to get a copy from a film collector friend, and describe it here.....

ESKIMO (1933 MGM) is one of Hollywood's great lost movies, and a tribute to the incredible movie director work of W. S. Van Dyke.

Last night I screened a movie ESKIMO (1933 MGM) starring Ray Mala and Lotus Long, directed by W. S. Van Dyke, a remarkable classic movie often rightly compared with the famous NANOOK OF THE NORTH (1923) documentary by Robert Flaherty.

ESKIMO (1933 MGM) was actually shot in Alaska, and is a fiction story set in the frozen waste areas of the Canadian Arctic area (though the movie was actually shot in Alaska, it is reported).

ESKIMO (1933 MGM) is one of the most remarkable and interesting, compelling movies I have ever seen, and movie history is one of my major avocations....I have seen many classic movies over the decades and have an enormous personal collection of movies on video.

Even so, ESKIMO (1933) ranks for me among the best of the best, an important (Academy Award Winning...Best Edited Movie...first to get that award ever) movie by any measure.

I'm a movie actor, currently, (SAG-AFTRA member) and recently acted in the GAME CHANGE (2012 HBO) movie in scenes which depicted Alaska's current political celebrity of fame, Sarah Palin (I was in scenes where movie star actress Julianne Moore portrayed Mrs. Palin).

ESKIMO (1933 MGM) is one of Hollywood's great lost movies, and a tribute to the incredible movie director work of W. S. Van Dyke.

CRUSOE trivia:

Of the many hundreds of sound serials produced, this is the only one that's 14 episodes in length. It's also the first-ever serial to feature re-cap chapters, which consist of film clips from previous episodes.

The story involves a dirigible that exploded. Ironically, six months after CRUSOE was released, the lighter-than-air ship Hindenburg would do exactly that: explode and crash while docking at Lakehurst, N.J.

Was one of George Lucas's inspirations for STAR WARS.

Was edited down into a TV movie in 1966.

Professional wrestler  Theodore 'Tiny' Roebuck was a Cherokee Indian. He appeared in only three movies besides CRUSOE. Here Tiny portrayed (what else?) a wrestler.

8061469,3,B0009IWGFU,"Republic's 1936 serial ""Robinson Crusoe of Clipper Island,"" directed by Mack V. Wright and Ray Taylor, may not be regarded as one of the studio's best efforts, but it deserves better treatment than it has had on DVD.  It has a few too many reminders of the earlier Mascot serials, but production values were higher, with fine models by the Lydecker brothers and some good stunt work.  Ray Mala's acting abilites seem to be controversial, but he makes an interesting, non-traditional serial movie hero.  And while it has nothing to do with the Defoe classic, the story is treated more seriously than those in the other 1936 Republic serials.

Sabotage is keeping Pacific Dirigible Airlines from using Clipper Island as a base, with the dirty work by ""international spies"" made to look like it was done by hostile natives.  A Polynesian, Mala (Ray Mala), agent of the ""United States Intelligence Department"" investigates.  On his way to the island, fellow passenger Anthony Tupper (John Ward), an Englishman who claims to be writing a book, seems to take an unusual interest in Mala's assignment, comparing his situation with that of Robinson Crusoe.  Mala gets involved in tribal politics, where the High Priest, Porotu (John Piccori) is trying to dethrone Princess Melani (Mamo Clark) with help from the spy ring, who have found a way to control the eruption of a ""sacred"" volcano.  With the radio usually out of commission there is little contact with the worried executives of the Dirigible company (John Dilson, Selmer Jackson and Herbert Rawlinson), but Mala and his associate Hank McGlaurie (William Newell), with four-footed assistance from Buck the Dog and Rex the Wonder Horse try to discover the identity of the spies' mysterious leader, known only as ""H. K.""

In addition to quite a bit of ""flashback"" material, two ""economy"" chapters were added to bring in more money from exhibitors when the serial ran over budget.  We get the usual ""retrospective"" type where a new character has to be brought up to date on the action, but the other one is (fortunately) unique in Republic's serials, consisting of a ""new"" story made almost entirely of clips from a previous chapter.  The serial would be a crashing bore to watch all at once, though it plays fairly well with a day or so between chapters.  Republic Home Video issued the 256-minute serial on VHS, but the length was a problem for the Laserdisc version in 1990.  To fit it on four sides it was time-compressed by about 9%, an understandable decision given the cost of an extra disc.  While technology has moved on, one would never guess this from the DVD editions.

It isn't surprising that copies of Republic's Laserdisc are common, but in 2002 there was an ""official"" release, still available from some dealers, by Image/Hal Roach Studios, # HRS 9468 (ASIN: B0000E69IS) and while then a new transfer it was ALSO time-compressed by about 9%.  As with the Laserdisc the sound remains at proper pitch, but the action has a slight ""undercranked"" look.  It's a shame since 256 minutes would fit, with only minor digital compression, on a double-layer DVD, but instead they filled the space with six trailers for Republic serials.  The picture is fine, with black level and gray scale slightly better than the Laserdisc.  The sound is mostly clear, though in several places there is some ""crackle"" and a couple minor dropouts, maybe a bad connection during the dubbing process.  It could have been a great edition, but with the time compression the Hal Roach DVD has only a small advantage over a good ""bootleg"" copy of the Laserdisc.

Laserdisc copies are fairly easy to spot from the 234 minute running time, though some releases make this difficult by including other material with the serial.  There's even a four-disc ""made on demand"" DVD-R set, but the total length shows it is just another Laserdisc copy, only more expensive than most.  I looked at the two ""mainstream"" budget DVDs, so low in cost they are both listed as ""add-on"" items.

Echo Bridge 30839 (ASIN: B0009IWGFU) is a fairly good copy of the Laserdisc, and while the original side-break in Chapter Three is a little rough, this happened at a reel-change in the film.  While not as good as the Image/Hal Roach DVD, the picture is still fairly sharp, the gray scale adequate, and the sound not much worse than what was on the original Laserdisc.  One odd item is that the notes on the package ""forgot"" to mention that the story involves Dirigibles, and the cover illustration shows a much more-modern airplane.  Maybe this helps sell it when found in bargain bins?

I wouldn't want to bet that worse copies aren't available, but of those in this review Alpha's (ASIN: B0002W4U6Q) gets the booby prize.  Not only does it run 234 minutes, it looks like it was copied from a ""bootleg"" VHS tape of the Laserdisc, with a head-switch glitch near the bottom of the screen.  Picture and sound are decidedly worse than the Echo Bridge DVD, and the break in Chapter 3, at the original Laserdisc side change is considerably less-smooth as well.

Republic Home Video's VHS edition (ASIN: 6301750683) was transferred at the correct speed, the image was respectable, and as this is being written some copies are still available.  Hopefully a new correct-speed transfer will appear, now that Republic serials are beginning to be issued from the source materials owned by Paramount.  Until that happens, those not wanting to deal with VHS should find the Echo Bridge DVD both adequate and cheap.",1499644800,,5507,4.880773361976369
