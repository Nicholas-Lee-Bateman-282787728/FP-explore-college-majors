893857,5,6304480261,"This is one of the top five quotable ""cult"" comedies I've ever seen, along with ""J-Men Forever"", the ""Naked Gun"" series, ""Blazing Saddles"" and ""Spinal Tap""--if you are enough of a Britophile to understand the basic premise (veddy British adventurer thwarts Nazis, based on Bulldog Drummond, a period pulp hero in England), this movie is extremely enjoyable and I would compare the title character, clueless but capable, with Frank Drebbin and Inspector Cleauseau--I cannot wait for this to be released on DVD as the VHS is hard to find--also, if I'm not mistaken, this was a Handmade Films picture, which was financed and produced by the late George Harrison who also was behind some of the Monty Python flicks, together and separate--if you like my comparison examples, buy this DVD and get ready to larf your bollocks off!",1062460800,6,824,4.978260869565218
893858,5,6304480261,"A *very* British version of a (Pink Panther)/(Peter Sellers) type movie. Very entertaining, very funny. One of my all time favorate movies.",950227200,3,139,5.363636363636363
893963,5,6304480261,Just a classic British 'send up' film that always makes me laugh.  All the character are wonderful.  A must for any film collection.,1309478400,,132,4.695652173913044
893964,1,6304480261,"Don't get me wrong - the film itself is a gem.

This transcription, however, is really bad. The original is 16:9, and the transcription is 4:3. There's none of that pan/scan stuff, which would be bad enough in itself - they just cropped the edge of the screen. To call it 'amateur' would be an insult to amateurs. Think 'bootleg copy'.

This is the second example of crappy transfers from European productions that I've come across in the last couple of weeks. Both involved British productions currently unavailable in the US. I assume the business model is to provide USA-compatible copies of difficult to obtain European productions (c/f A Month in the Country), hoping that the target audience will accept anything.

We don't. Anyone feel like producing something worth buying?

And just to repeat - the rating is for the transfer: the film is at the very least ten stars.",1303171200,12,876,4.82
893965,5,6304480261,"I saw this movie in 1978 when it was originally premiered in California, and met the cast.
Hands down, it is one of the funniest movies - possibly THE funniest movie - I have ever seen.
It's a spoof of English spy thrillers from the 1930's, with the humor very much akin to Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein or Blazing Saddles, the BBC Jeeves series with Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry, or the Blackadder series by Rowan Atkinson. If you have an appreciation for that kind of off the wall, but very cerebral humor, this is your picture. By the way - eating popcorn while you watch this picture is hazardous.",1296432000,2,601,4.472727272727273
893966,5,6304480261,"Captain Hugh Bullshot Crummond is a legendary character.  This is a very physical part with lots of comedic changes.  Love the part where he is in the hotel, shooting the tarantula.  ""How did he manage to save the world and still win the London to Brighton""  classic lines.  Silly sight gags, good clean fun.  Billy connelly is also funny. Ok for the kids.  *****",1294963200,2,363,4.578125
893967,3,6304480261,"...""Footlight Frenzy""? it's a videotaping of a live stage performance by this same comedy group and it is a masterpiece of verbal, physical, situational and slapstick comedy. It only played briefly on HBO way back in 1980 and had a small release on VHS (RKO Video). If you like ""Bullshot"", your jaw will bounce off the floor for ""Footlight"".

One joke example: (I won't go into the set up except to say a guy is on a stage in a play and has to drink a martini. He doesn't know that the water isn't working in the theatre so the stage manager just scooped some water out of the toilet for the prop. You can see that realization hit the actor when he pours it into his mouth. That's the set up.) He slowly turns until the hand holding the now empty martini glass is upstage, out of sight of the audience, holding it down at his hidden side. Slowly he leans over and lets the fluid dribble out of the corner of his mouth back into the glass down by his leg, not spilling a drop.) Brilliant. The whole thing is like that.

Hopefully, someday, the Loan Moan Spectacular (the name of this comedy troup) will license the rights and it will become available again. The world will laugh.

Bullshot has a few of those moments of brilliance, but not nearly enough to satisfy. Also, because it's a film and therefore able to move around it loses a lot of focus and seems fumbling from time to time. Pleasant but not amazing.",1241654400,,1412,4.361216730038023
893968,5,6304480261,"It's not a take-off of the Pink Panther, it's a take-off of Bulldog Drummond who was one of the original 1920s action heroes. Bulldog was a WWI veteran action hero characterised by slightly unlikely explanations of how he got out of situations. Bullshot is characterised by ludicrously funny explanations of how he got out of situations. Each time he gives his explanation (such as ""I talk squid"" IIRC) it is greeted by his devoted girlfriend with the loving phrase ""Oh Bullshot!"". Do I need to change the letter for you?

I'd call this a farce (definition: A light dramatic work in which highly improbable plot situations, exaggerated characters, and often slapstick elements are used for humorous effect.), I can only assume that one star guy doesn't understand farce, satire, irony and other indirect humor.

This is one of the very few films I have been waiting years to acquire on DVD. I won't waste my money on tapes.",1144627200,7,923,4.8354430379746836
893969,5,6304480261,"British humour is so far out there, Americans will never understand.  From Red Dwarf, Black Adder and other British comedies, only a pure bred Brit can find the humour in this entertaining...

893970,5,6304480261,"This underrated classic is an example of english humour at it's very best. It contains quotes as ""I'm a collector of rare insects"", ""Don't bother to salute"", ""three on a match"" and ""I propose mass global war!"".  If you see the film you'll understand them. Or maybe not.
Anyways it's a film I've seen many times over and over, and it's sad that it didn't launch a career like Monty Python's for these guys. (Monty Python is said to have put some money into this project (Handmade Films).) I know this cast have done two more films ""Papa Pepe's Show"" and ""Tarnished Silver"". I don't know where to get them.
And where can I get a hold of Bullshot on DVD for europe?",1066694400,9,662,4.382113821138211

7873367,3,6304480261,"I was one ov thousands who saw the production ov Bullshot Crummond in San Phrancisco back in 1978 at the now extinct Hippodrome.  And I anxiously awaited the philm version, and even more so because it was being produced by George Harrison's Handmade Philm company.  A bit dissapointed, I must say.  The play was screamingly phunny, the movie was not.  About the only thing that peaked my interest was Ray Cooper and Larry Legs Smith, both ov whom are connected with Harrison, and Connolly, who I think is one ov comedy's genius's.  And the inclusion ov the Henley Armada.  Otherwise, because the movie strayed so phar away phrom the play, and the phact that the movie was written by the same people, makes one ponder why.",1322179200,,721,4.682539682539683
