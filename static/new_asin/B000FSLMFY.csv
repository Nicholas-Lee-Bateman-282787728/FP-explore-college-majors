8126226,5,B000FSLMFY,"I wish to say thanks for Amazon to supply me with the historical film of the 2nd world war and also for the producer Michael kloft and those involved for publishing a very interesting and informative view of one of the most destructive war, man ever made. The film was very clear and clearly explained. I wish to ask for some help, regarding some photos of German soldiers, who where captured , and wish to know their name and their regiment. If possible, either from the producer, or from other sources, please send me some information, on how to make contact. I greatly appreciate. THANKS..",1422835200,,592,4.647619047619048
8126227,4,B000FSLMFY,"This fascinating documentary, put together by German Spiegel TV, shows on-the-ground footage of U.S. combat units moving across Nazi Germany in the final months of World War II.  Cameramen accompanied frontline troops and captured compelling footage of GIs fighting depleted-yet-still-lethal German troops in cities and towns, being greeted by puzzled-but-seemingly-happy German townspeople, and, grimly, liberating Nazi concentration and/or slave labor camps.

If your father or grandfather fought in Germany (one might add, on both sides, actually), this was surely the war he saw.  Embedded '45 is a riveting, unvarnished look at a particularly nasty piece of not-so-distant history.",1394496000,,686,5.979591836734694
8126228,5,B000FSLMFY,"I liked this DVD because it showed footage that I had not seen in other WW2 documentaries. But I hesitated purchasing it because of reviewer Justin Bittick's comment that ""This film is more concerned with the combat cameraman than battles."" I wonder which DVD he was watching, because scenes of combat cameramen take up at most about 30 seconds of this ""Embedded '45"" DVD. And the narration did not focus on the cameramen either, as it is straight-ahead, here's the date, here's the location, here's what happened. In fact, one of the strengths of the film is that it is very specific as to dates and locations.

So if you want to see some different WW2 film, ignore Bittick's comment and buy this DVD.",1376265600,6,702,4.661290322580645
8126229,3,B000FSLMFY,"This is an interesting film, although those expecting a lot of combat will be disappointed. This film is more concerned with the combat cameramen than battles. There are very few scenes of actual combat, although they include the famous scene of the Panther knocked out in Cologne by a Pershing. While the narration has a taint of bias and can get repetitious on some themes (i.e. cameramen were ordered not to film dead Americans) it is generally well done. They are also fairly good at pointing out when a scene was staged for the camera. There are a few shots of the rarely pictured Pershing heavy tank rumbling down streets or roads. All-in-all, worth a look.",1232150400,5,663,4.724137931034483
8126230,4,B000FSLMFY,"This DVD is based on multiple reels of film shot by US Army Signal Corps camermen in 1945 during the drive into Germany.  The material is all black and white, well exposed and well reproduced.  The story starts with the crossing of the Roer River and moves through the end of the war.  For the mlitary equipment buff there are many scenes of tanks in action, of artillery, and a lot of footage of the infantryman in combat.  There are many scenes of the German death camps and of the suffering and destruction that the Nazis brought to Germany, but the real value to many of us are the scenes of the American GI in action.  No glory, just a dirty, nasty job that was done by a generation now in their eighties.  It is fascinating to look back at the young men, the average infantry, carrying heavy loads, always in danger, but working towards the victory.",1168819200,18,855,4.414012738853503
