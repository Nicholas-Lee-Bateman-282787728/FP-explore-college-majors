8259891,1,B0015U0QV2,"But not from Moe.  From the studio, St Clair Entertainmemt and Amazon.com.

I should have been tipped off by the lack of a product description for this
dvd, as it it is unusual for Amazon not to have them on their web pages.
In spite of this red flag, I was enticed by the thought of receiving 40
Three Stooges shorts at this price.  There was no customer reviews at that
time that I could rely on either, and that is why I am writing this review
so that you will know what you are getting (and not getting).

There are five shorts, but they are in the Public Domain which means they
can easily be viewed or downloaded off the Internet.  Included is a full
length film, ""Swing Parade of 1946"" starring Gale Storm.  This is an interesting
musical from that era, but the Stooges have minor roles and are not at their
comedic best.  The bulk of this dvd (34 out of the 40 advertized features;
3 hrs 26 min) are episodes from ""The New Three Stooges,"" a tv series from
1965.  It has Joe DeRita as Curly Joe and Stooge cartoons interspersed
with not-so-funny skits.

Larry:  Oww.  Ow[...]  What did you do that for?
Moe:  Pay attention, Knucklehead.",1269388800,3,1143,4.360189573459715
