8481933,4,B005OTGRXQ,Steve Guttenberg makes this worth watching. The personality (and poor writing) of the female character prevented me from giving it more stars.,1429747200,2,142,5.5
8481934,4,B005OTGRXQ,"Cute, funny, a little awkward dialog in a few places but a good movie overall.",1413849600,,78,4.266666666666667

8481936,1,B005OTGRXQ,............. ...............  and at 75 I'm still not old enough to watch this kind of garbage and I do not think anyone else I know is,1381622400,,136,4.230769230769231
8481937,1,B005OTGRXQ,Not worth the dollar to rent it.  A totally predictable story line that lacks any real comedy.  Very disappointed in this one.,1357171200,2,126,4.681818181818182
8481938,1,B005OTGRXQ,"This movie is not romantic at all! you think if the movie has romance in the title, that it would be romantic!! Well, it's not. The ending sucks! Most of the movie is LAME! They were all good actors, but if it had been a better script to begin with, it would have been a better movie. I could write a better movie than this! The ending is just so lazy and typical of shows these days! It's like the script writer said ""Oh, well, I'm tired of making this movie, let's just end it now!"" Stupid! at least write two or three more sentences for the movie to have a better ending!  For heaven's sakes, at least end the movie with them kissing. it's not like there's going to be a sequel. like he couldn't be in a better movie? just go watch one of his old good movies and don't your waste your time on this.",1337644800,2,801,4.069620253164557
8481939,1,B005OTGRXQ,"This is really not a criticism of the movie but one about the horrible music score. I would feel pity for anybody hearing this awful music in a movie theater. It seems like the ""composer"" had made a CD years ago and decided to just pop it into the film. It's terrible and adds nothing good to the movie.",1332288000,,303,4.1525423728813555
8481940,5,B005OTGRXQ,"A Novel Romance aired in our local theater which has become Digiplex, so all movies shown here are Digital. The look of the movie is superb with New York City as background.

There was an overflow crowd; many people were so pleased to see Steve Guttenberg back in a starring role and he delivered 'in spades'. The Director cleverly left the audience hanging in suspense right up to the last minute. The ending of the movie still leaves the viewer unsure of the future for the lead characters.

The cast included some really fine familiar character actors. The ""Slosh Ball"" scene itself makes the movie worth seeing.",1320105600,3,615,4.738317757009346
