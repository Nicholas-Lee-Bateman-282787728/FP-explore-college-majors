8354003,5,B002753XJ6,a great example of what can be accomplished on low budget with careful planing and artful direction....great acting too...I suspect we will hear more from these film makers!,1370563200,,173,5.214285714285714
8354004,4,B002753XJ6,"Although the basis of the plot line has been used before this movie had its own originality and was action packed. Great acting and character development. Loved this movie, and you will too. Check it out",1262649600,,203,4.666666666666667
8354005,1,B002753XJ6,"The plots been done to death, The main actor was lethargic. I had to fast fwd many of the slow moving dialog scenes. A big bore.",1250985600,,128,3.9615384615384617
8354006,5,B002753XJ6,"This is a great action movie for an indie budget and it has a plot line.  The locations look amazing and the actors are outstanding.  Edwin Garcia II's protrayal of Enrique, a low level gangster who's family loyalty outweighs all, shows Edwin's range from comedic to dramatic.  Linda Rodriguez as Isabella and Mark Joy as Vincent also have very powerful performances.  I highly recommend this film to anyone who is looking for a good film that doesn't need all of the Hollywood glam.  And please do not confuse this for JLo's horrible ""Bordertown""; Chris Allen William's BORDER TOWN (two words) is definitely worth a watch, you won't be disappointed.",1246924800,7,650,4.926605504587156
