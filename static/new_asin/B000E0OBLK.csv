The frst two tv movies on disc two are above average, but the best thing about this set for me were the classic mystery movie trilers at the end of disc one.  For the prioce, I shouldn't complain.  And some of these movies are hard to find on DVD.  Recommended with reservations.",1369180800,,420,4.698630136986301
8103317,4,B000E0OBLK,"The television shows of today are soooo trite and uninteresting it's easier to rent or buy new/used tapes for our watching pleasure.  This excellent priced set of dvds is a great value.  The price is low and the movies are fairly good---good enough to rate 4 stars out of five.  They are not Academy or Emmy award films, but are better than whatever is on tonight in primetime.

For 10 bucks?  You easily spend that at McDonalds for lunch.",1281916800,,439,4.506329113924051
8103318,5,B000E0OBLK,"Invitation to Murder is a collection of 10 murder mystery  movies that have only one thing in common: they are all public domain and as such it is possible for them to be presented in highly affordable collections. I paid $9.98 for my set and that comes down to about one dollar per movie. The way that movie tickets cost nowadays, you really cannot complain about this collection.

An added bonus of this collection is the fact that except for Murder on Flight 502 & the early Alfred Hitchcock movie Murder!, hardly any of these movies are available on other public domain collections. All in all, Invitation to Murder is a great 10 movie collection.

Anyways, here is how I rate the movies in Invitation to Murder:

Great:

Murder Once Removed (1971)
Rehearsal For Murder(1982)

Good:

Power, Passion and Murder (1983)
They Call It Murder (1971)
Please Murder Me (1956)

Average:

Call It Murder (1934)
Murder By Television (1935)
Murder Story (1989)
Murder! (1930)

Bad:
Murder on Flight 502 (1975)",1199145600,11,1001,4.8352941176470585
8103319,4,B000E0OBLK,"if you have read any of my reviews you know i love these movie collections. this set i bought after hearing good things from people i had gotten other sets for as gifts.

  i love this company, the transfers look good the movies are good(as good as b movies and old t.v. movies can be)and best of all they offer extras(sets like this never offer them!!!).

  and at under $10.00, you can't go wrong!!",1146268800,10,400,4.337837837837838

Perhaps 4 stars is a tad too kind, but the talent in this megaset alone has got to be worth at least seven bucks!  I haven't seen all the films listed here, but you absolutely can't go wrong with the bad TV movies (which were so bad that I think they must have been made for the late late show), particularly ""Murder on Flight 502, with Ralph Bellamy, Farah Fawcett, Sonny Bono, Fernando Lamas, Walter Pigeon, Robert Stack, Laraine Day, Brooke Adams and [ta-da!] Danny Bonaduce from The Partridge Family.

Seven dollars is a steal!",1141603200,15,1293,5.454081632653061
