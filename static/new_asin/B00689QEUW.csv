4977626,5,B00689QEUW,"We purchased this for our niece over a year ago, when she was very young - she took to it immediately and became mesmerized by the music and the characters.  In a word she was obsessed.  In no time she was tapping to the beat and singing (without words but in tune)... unbelievably, she started marching to the music of the DVD before she could truly walk.  Even after all this time, she still adores both the DVD and the CD. We and her parents have given this DVD set to many friends and family members with small children and they have universally loved it.  As a plus for parents:  the music is actually great and not hard to listen to over and over.  We recommend it to anyone with small children who wants to keep them occupied while teaching them something really important in a child's development.",1357257600,2,805,4.405405405405405
4977627,5,B00689QEUW,"All three of my kids, age 12 months to 6 years, love this DVD. It's very thoughtfully put together - it's obvious that the creators have an understanding of music AND the way children learn. My kids have watched it so much that I had to hide it for a while and then bring it out again. Really hope that there are more to come, as this would be even better if it was part of a series. The music CD is a great bonus!",1348444800,2,414,3.8823529411764706
4977628,5,B00689QEUW,"My first thought when I turned on this movie, is ""oh I hope she'll enjoy this as much as I do"". I love music. Growing up I played different instruments here and there, but singing has always been my musical instrument of choice. After finishing the DVD, my main thought was ""I hope and pray there will be more in this series!"" The Tuneables is fabulous and truly unlike any music education DVD/CD project I've experienced so far and it is a great idea. The animation characters are cute and my two year old daughter is very excited about them. She is always asking for music and rhythm in her DVDs whenever we decide to turn something on.

I am very excited about this series, because not only does it provide a baseline for education on tonal value, the beat in music, and interactive range expansion - but it has activity. I mean, get up and move! March your feet! Pat your knees - move and learn. Using the song Pat Pat Pat Your Knees, there is some anatomy and fun. Then also things like Sweep the Street after the parade - clean up after fun! I'm enamored with this, even the Enginerd likes it. :) I highly recommend this DVD and CD set and I really do hope there will be more to come.

Just as a mother to a toddler, I'm very enthusiastic about watching this movie over and over again and listening to the CD here there and everywhere. But as a homeschooling mother I truly believe this is a great and fun way to teaching the fundamentals of music.",1323388800,6,1454,4.322344322344322
4977629,5,B00689QEUW,I bought this DVD set for my 2 year old nephew. He loves all the music and the DVD. He has learned to keep beat and all of the character's names. I bought 5 more for gifts for Christmas. It's educational and fun!,1322956800,2,212,3.953488372093023
4977630,5,B00689QEUW,"I was amazed watching my young son as we sat still and mesmerized by the Tuneables dvd. He was captivated by the incredible animation and the clever characters. To my surprise and delight he started lap patting and singing along! The Tuneables is a brilliant new series that has been needed for a long time. Quality music education is so important for our kids.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Tuneables-I-Love-Music-2-Disk-Set-DVD-CD/dp/B00689QEUW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Tuneables: I Love Music! 2-Disk Set DVD/CD</a>&nbsp;We also really enjoy the audio cd.

8494730,5,B00689QEUW,"Perfect for 2 - 4 year olds.  Gentle and methodical, this video encourages children to hear more than noise.",1505174400,,108,4.684210526315789
8494731,4,B00689QEUW,"This is great for a kindergarten music class. The students really connect with the concepts of steady beat and melody. Some music students in the first grade would also enjoy the content. Students in the second grade should already have an understanding of these music fundamentals, and might not fully appreciate the content. For younger grades, it's a real hit.",1447372800,,363,5.066666666666666
8494732,5,B00689QEUW,"My teaching colleague introduced this one day when we were teaching our normal triple-sized music classes and near exhaustion. I found it to be shockingly good. The kids are not only staring at the  video, but actively singing, doing motions, patting along, etc. The best part of this video is repeated showings don't drive you crazy with the songs. They are quite good. I recommend it to first and second grade kids.",1436486400,,417,4.791666666666667

8494735,5,B00689QEUW,"Great DVD for Kindergarten or 1st grade students (or Pre-K, but I don't teach them).
My 5-7 year olds love this movie and ask to watch it over and over. There are several songs that teach basic music concepts and stay stuck in your head all day. I've watched this movie about 20 times now and it is still entertaining.",1386028800,4,318,4.316666666666666

8494738,5,B00689QEUW,"I bought this for my grandson who is 2 because I was previously a music teacher and love anything that will provide a bit of a music education for children. It is such a hit that I am telling you, you MUST get this for your children. My grandson wants to watch it everyday and can now do all the rhythms and also sing most of the songs in relation to the video. He always takes anyone he can find into he video room and says he wants ""Tunables"". Everyday, it is by far his favorite CD that I have purchased. I hope they do more of these because not only are they educational as far as music is concerned, the animation is vivid and the characters are so cute and entertaining that every child would love it. Buy it now. Your kids will thank you and you will keep them entertained and educated for at least 30 minutes a day.",1366588800,2,823,4.118012422360248
8494739,5,B00689QEUW,"From an early childhood music specialist's standpoint, this DVD and the accompanying CD does everything right to teach very young children the important fundamental concepts they need to master before moving on to piano or instrumental lessons. This DVD fills a hole in early childhood education that desperately needs to be filled with quality teaching of simple music concepts. Far too many parents believe that it is enough just to listen to music with your child. Unfortunately, when those children get to the point where they will want to try playing a musical instrument or singing in a chorus or with their friends and family, they will likely have difficulty with beat, rhythm and singing on pitch and therefore will be less likely to succeed than a child who has had appropriate musical instruction within the ""window of opportunity"" (up to about age 7). This DVD/CD program is based on the most up to date research and on the tried-and-true methods gleaned from many years of successful classroom teaching by masters in the field of early childhood music. It is my informed opinion that young children will love, be entertained by and better yet, will actually learn from this top quality educational set.",1359072000,2,1215,4.990147783251231
