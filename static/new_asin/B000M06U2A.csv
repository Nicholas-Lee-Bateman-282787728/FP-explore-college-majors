Juanita Bynum - I loved her music in this dvd, but bless her! I loved her praise and worship even more. She is strong and anoiting. The Ochestra was great and looking foward to the next project",1218067200,,426,4.132530120481928
2717984,4,B000M06U2A,"This was a very professional DVD. The composer was awesome, he kept the music in a majestic flow.  It was a very anointed atmosphere. Jonathon Butler was, well..Jonathon Butler-Awesome! It did seem like Juanita Bynum change her close about 10 times other than that it is a Classical Gospel gem!",1200009600,,294,4.88
2717985,5,B000M06U2A,"This is a must have/must see DVD.  Excellent quality.  Juanita Bynum and Jonathan Butler together was just awesome.  The orchestration was out of this world. My favourite songs are ""We Worship You"", ""I Don't Mind Waiting"", ""Falling in Love"" and ""I Need you to Survive"".  I had never heard of Henry Panion III but after watching this DVD will be looking out for him on other projects.  He is just AWSOME!!  Young and old will appreciate this DVD.",1191196800,,445,4.641025641025641

2717989,5,B000M06U2A,"Wow! This is the best Gospel DVD ever produced.  The DVD was produced in true HDTV quality using the best production facilities in the world.  It was an annointed night and the DVD captures that perfectly!  Prophtess Bynum nails ""One Night with The King"" and Jonathan Butler's song ""Love Never Fails"" will be a Gospel classic if any radio station starts playing it! Jonathan is an incredible performer!  This DVD will inspire and strengthen you in your Christian walk.",1171929600,5,468,4.886075949367089

2717995,3,B000M06U2A,"I love Jonathan Butler's music but Juanita Bynum is a bit more than I can handle.  Her voice is shrill and it seems she thinks she must scream her lyrics.  It is a real distraction from the quality of the music.  Butler is amazing, as always.",1376265600,,242,4.217391304347826
2717996,5,B000M06U2A,I have purchased this DVD and I am satisfied by it. I have viewed it many times already! Praise God!,1361577600,,100,4.05
2717997,5,B000M06U2A,"I can't say enough about this CD and DVD. I have given out more than 2 dozen of them to family and friends. I am late learning about the Gospel goes Classical but I am glad I found it. I love classical music and I love Gospel so what is better than putting the two together. Now to piggy back some of the positive comments, you will not be able to sit and watch this DVD. It is outstanding ""Juanita Bynum at her finest moment"", and Jonathan Butler what a humble graceful man, they where both wonderful. I respect Dr. Panion; however the only negative I must conjecture is his specking ability. I don't know how often he does it [speak in public] but it seemed as if he was fumbling with his words to express the event, artist and the whole transformation of each song to the audience. I think that part could have been done more eloquently. That did not however take away from the great performance.",1304899200,,899,4.325443786982248
2717998,5,B000M06U2A,"I PURCHASED THE DVD BECAUSE I LOVED THE CD AND HAD SEEN CLIPS ON YOUTUBE..UPON RECIEVING THE DVD, JUST THE PACKAGE ALONG LEFT ME WITH GREAT EXPECTATIONS AND I WAS NOT LET DOWN.  JUANITA, JONATHAN, DR.PENION, THE CHOIR,THE ORCASTRA IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANY CHURCH, OR INDIVUAL WHO WANTS TO CREATE THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE PRESENCE OF GOD. THE WORSHIP, THE POWER AND THE ANNOINTING DISPLAYED ON THE DVD REACHES OUTSIDE OF THE TELEVISION AND SATURATES YOUR ENVIROMENT. I HAVE ORDER 3 ADDITIONAL ONES FOR GIFTS FOR MY SISTER, BEST FRIEND AND CHURCH.OH YES, PLEASE TRY THE NEW FROM AND EVEN THE USED FROM THE PRICE DIFFERENCE IS SIGNIFIGANT AND WELL WORTH IT. signed...SOSO BLESSED.",1304467200,3,672,4.793103448275862

8165482,3,B000M06U2A,"If you're not very familiar with these artists or just found this DVD while browsing, you should be aware that it's not at all what it seems.  This is represented as being gospel music done in a classical style with two singers appearing to sing together.  For the most part, it's neither.  Except for the first song, which is just the orchestra, this is pretty much live praise and worship.  Also, Ms Bynum and Mr Butler only sing about half of one song together.  The rest of the time they are soloing.  And a good bit of that is talking or, more aptly, ""motivating"" in Ms Bynum's case.  Her efforts at trying to hype up the audience come across as misplaced.  She is ""at church"" (even with the requisite backing choir) while the audience and orchestra are at a formal musical gala.  Ms Bynum even alludes to wanting to take the event to a different level at times.  Some of the audience does move towards Ms Bynum's way  eventually, but they never fully go where she tries to take them.  She's in a tabernacle while they're still in a concert hall.  And the orchestra never leaves their solemn, concentrated demeanor.  You often see them in the background looking as though they are impatiently waiting to start playing again.  The whole thing comes across as mismatched.

The vocals, music, orchestra, sound, etc, are all fabulous.  If this DVD had been presented as being the dynamic praise and worship music that it actually is, and if the setting had been better suited to the purpose, I'd give this 5 stars hands down.  But as it is, the mismatched purposes and starkly different frames of reference are a real distraction that take away from either purpose.",1442188800,,1666,4.6279863481228665

This DVD will bless your soul every time you watch it, ..thus the addiction. Never knew classical music & gospel would sound so good together, like a marriage made in heaven, I love it. Juanita Bynum, that lady is amazing, and teaming with Jonathan Butler, one of my ole school favorites just made this DVD shine......What better way to end a hard day ....be bless, obtain this DVD, and I guarantee it'll bless your soul.",1423785600,,537,4.912087912087912
8165485,3,B000M06U2A,"A concert hall a gospel choir right above a classical orchestra Wow what a set up BUT????????

Half singing and half preaching which is very annoying. Mrs Byrum you have a beautiful voice but I prefer it when you use it for singing. You see a 13 minutes song but she talks the first 2 and the last 5. People are not all in trance as you are and talking about the lord the lord and jesus is here can you feel him every two minutes is kind of repetitive.

The orchestra is there to play the notes of your songs and they seem bored in many occasion just waiting to begin playing. This could have been so much more with a 50 plus orchestra and 50 plus gospel choir. I much prefered jonathan Butler who spoke less and performed more. This show had so much potential but fell so flat . Probably the Cd has just the song part so that might be a better purchase for that",1419292800,,862,4.094674556213017
