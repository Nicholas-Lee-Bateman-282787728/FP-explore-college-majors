361314,3,6301777875,"Honestly, if  I could give it 3 and a half, I would.  It is a solid little 80's movie, that I honestly enjoy watching from time to time.  I remember watching a ton when I first saw it on one of the cable networks.  I liked it enough years later to buy a copy.  It's not a fantastic movie, but it is just a solid and enjoyable movie to watch.  Nothing more and nothing less.",1463788800,,373,3.9066666666666667
361315,5,6301777875,"The best line in this movie is when Steve O'Bradovich says ""nice hit cheese dick"" to C Thomas Howell during a match. And that line sums up this surprisingly fun and cheesy movie. Is the acting great? No however there's something about this movie that just pulls you in and let's you enjoy 90 minutes of simple and fun entertainment. Eighties music, neon clothing and some entertaining volleyball scenes with actual Pro Beach Volleyball Stars from that time period. By the end of the movie it has a ""Rudy"" like feeling to it and you end up really rooting for the unexpected bond that Peter Horton and C Thomas Howell share as teammates.",1462060800,,635,4.628318584070796

361395,5,6301777875,"There aren't many volleyball movies for whatever reason, and none of the few I found looked very interesting to me, but I decided to try this one and I'm glad I did. There was a bit too much other stuff going on (I was just interested in the volleyball), but they used actual volleyball players for the movie so it was actually pretty fun to watch.",1425859200,,348,4.287878787878788

361400,5,6301777875,"I've remebered this movie since I was a kid after the first time i had seen it. In germany it's not available so I searched on the internet and I am so happy that I finally found it!!! I think those movies (from the 80's/beginning of the 90's) have got a special charme and I like them very much!

Thanks for offering it on amazon...and for selling and shipping it to costumers from germany!",1362873600,,391,4.283783783783784
361401,4,6301777875,"Loved this film, but totally unrealistic. An amateur takes the volleyball world by storm. Yeah right lol Still a fun, summer volleyball flick.",1361145600,,142,5.217391304347826
361442,5,6301777875,"There are no words to prepare you this.  If you enjoy the volleyball scene from Top Gun, this is like a whole movie about it!",1355529600,2,125,4.0

361444,4,6301777875,"I've liked this movie for the longest time, it has a Rocky type of ending to it,the two unseeded players beating the number one seeded players,very exciting ending, the biggest point in the match other than the final one was when Rolo and Cross missed the overhead shot and hit it into the net,that was my favorite part of the match other than the ending,it has alot of big name people from the old days in it like Terry Kiser,Kathy Ireland,C Thomas Howell,Peter Horton,Courtney-Thorne Smith,Tony Burton,overall this isn't a great movie but a very good movie, alot better than some of the trashy movies they have out nowadays, also Courtney-Thorne Smith looked incredible in this, the best i have ever seen her in any movie or tv show shes been in.",1339718400,,748,4.717557251908397
361445,3,6301777875,"A somewhat cheesy 80s tale about a kid (C. Thomas Howell) who starts his summer in Los Angeles working for his lawyer uncle and then turns to volleyball contesting with a washed out pro (Peter Horton). Supporting roles by Kathy Ireland and Courtney Thorne-Smith though the former is very little and she isn't wearing her usual bikini. There's lots of skin, sun and beach as well as volleyball games especially at the end. Barely entertaining. Eighties music galore and those horrible outfits and hair styles date it.

CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: C plus to B minus; STORY/PLOTTING: C plus; DELIVERS ON WHAT IS PROMISES (skin, sun & sand): B minus; WHEN WATCHED: mid May 2012; OVERALL GRADE: C plus.",1336953600,,690,4.948275862068965
361446,3,6301777875,"As a beach volleyballer, its good to watch this film with all the cheesy acting, fluro outfits and retro volleyball gameplay.

C Thomas Howell's acting in this is pretty poor.

Some of the volleyball action scenes are ok, could have been a bit more exciting.

I always laugh at the last hand set in the movie as its a really bad double, and unless the referee was partly blind or looking the other way, they would not have won the last point (to win the grand final).

Its also a shame that the storyline is pretty far fetched about a rookie indoor player (who is really ordinary) that after a brief bit of questionable training goes on to win the grand final.

If i wasn't an avid player myself i probably would only rent this film.",1291248000,,733,4.360294117647059
361447,3,6301777875,One of my favorite 80s movies of all time.  C. Thomas Howell is awesome.  Peter Horton seems to shine here apart from his role on Thirtysomething.  Also Courtney Thorne-Smith is here as well and hotter than ever.,1291075200,,212,4.675675675675675
361448,3,6301777875,"Consider this a Guilty Pleasure favorite. I proudly admit that I watched this movie everytime it came on HBO. OK, so the story might be lame, no Award-Winning acting, consider it a good way to pass the time.  A good lazy weekend movie.  It recently just came into my head that this was avaiable on DVD!  Might as well grab a used copy.",1189814400,,335,4.285714285714286
361449,5,6301777875,"A MUST HAVE MOVIE FOR THE 90's BEACH VOLLEYBALL FAN.

361450,3,6301777875,"""Side Out"" is a breezy, if unremarkable film. If you love beach volleyball, you'll love this film. The ""Rocky"" of the sport.",1152921600,,124,4.681818181818182
361451,2,6301777875,"This is a pretty bad movie, but if you are in the mood for that, watch Side Out. If you have a hangover on a Sunday afternoon, this movie may fit the bill. The dialogue will make you squirm, and then crack up. The movie isn't mean-spirited, just painfully cheesy. Nothing happens in the flick that you wouldn't expect. The best part of the movie is the dialogue. It's priceless!",1090713600,2,378,4.414285714285715
361492,4,6301777875,"Side Out is just an incredible film.  From the moment Monroe Clark steps off the plane from Milwaukee and onto the hot sandy beach volleyball scene, the action just never stops.  When Zack Barnes speaks you listen.  Peter Horton's finest hour.  C. Thomas Howell's career had nowhere to go but, downhill from here.  How he got sunbbed by the Academny, I will never know.  This is just a true classic and must have for any respectable movie collector.",1084752000,5,449,4.6923076923076925
361493,4,6301777875,"OK, for so many different reasons I could easily pan this.  The volleyball action by a certain duo, namely horton / howell, really stinks!  The acting is out and out crap, Stoklos and Smiths final film for a reason.
HOWEVER, I love this movie, if for no other reason that you get to see some of the classic players; Timmons, Stoklos, Smith, Mootheart, and of course OB.  It is a fun romp through a sillier time, when anyone without a sponsorship deal could dream.  Just don't expect too much.",1082937600,,492,4.49438202247191
361494,1,6301777875,This movie is a complete joke.  Anyone who says differently has taken too many volleyballs to the head themselves.  The only way they could have made it more unrealistic would have been to cast Gary Coleman as his pro beach partner.,1045180800,,232,4.634146341463414
361495,3,6301777875,"This movie falls in with so many other failed attempts at a decent movie that has to do with sports. The movie is no where near believable. The worst display of volleyball i have ever seen. The movie really gets funny when they try to act. However, cheezball movies such as these are classics, and should be in everyone's collection.",1037059200,2,333,4.566666666666666
361496,4,6301777875,"I can't believe I'm reviewing this, but after seeing it again after so many years it just struck me......eeeekkk!  It is one of the quintessential 80's films but was released in 1990.  Oh and it's all their, bad hair, bad clothes, bad sayings, bad music.  And of course set at the beach, there is a lot of skin.  It's actually not a bad story, C. Thomas Howell plays a wannabe lawyer out in California for the summer working for his uncle.  On his first assignment, giving eviction notices, he meets Peter Horton (from beloved ""thirtysomething"" fame) and they become volleyball partners in the big tournament.  It sounds bizarre but works as only those '80s movies can.  Courtney Thorne-Smith and Harley Jane Kozak support the cast, as does Terry Kiser who plays another Bernie but doesn't get killed this time!  Oh what fun and pain at the same time to watch this movie and remember that this is what it used to be like back in the 80's!  So now I've written the review, and if you come across Side Out in the video store it won't disappoint.",1036713600,6,1043,4.53475935828877
361497,1,6301777875,"Upon viewing this movie I now know that actually being able to write a script, let alone being able to write at all, has absolutly nothing to do in wheteher or not a movie gets made. Sure it has everything anyone looks for in a movie, sand, poor acting, more sand, C. Thomas Howell, sand, that guy from 'thirtysomething',sand,and an obvious repeated Mossimo product placement. What is wrong with the Academy in not noticing this as one of the best films ever? You nay sayers can have your 'Schindler's List' but for me, true drama and struggle displayed through one man's journey to play volleyball is more life affirming than anything.",1006128000,3,636,4.738738738738738
361498,4,6301777875,Although it is true that this movie is not blessed with great acting. However the plot is enjoyable although completely unbelievable. But then again isn't that why we watch movies in the first place. It is a shame that Beach Volleyball never reached the level of what was expected. All in all this movie was entertaining.,973641600,2,321,4.75
361499,4,6301777875,"This is one of the worst films you are ever likely to see. The acting stinks, the action is awful, however, this is strangely compulsive viewing. You know exactly what is going to happen but for some reason you have to  watch. This is a must for all useless movie fans.  The other big problem is  that somebody must have believed that beach volleyball was going to be  huge, that never happened. Genius!  once more C.Thomas Howell in a real  stinker, keep up the good work.",958780800,4,473,4.441860465116279
361500,5,6301777875,"Peter Horton and the delicious C. Thomas Howell have chemistry oozing from every orifice.  I've probably seen every beach volley ball movie ever made and this is far and away my favorite.  Hey, has anyone ever seen Soulman?  Wow, I really just can't get enough C. Thomas...Sensational!",955584000,5,285,5.0212765957446805
