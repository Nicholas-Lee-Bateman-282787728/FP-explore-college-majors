5897862,3,B00E99FY9K,"Charlie Goodman is No Charlie Harper. Charlie Sheen's performance on Anger Management seems like he's only giving half of his Comedic performance as in 2 and a Half Men.

Selma Blair was not the only member of the shows cast and crew that was frustrated by Sheens work habits as I hear they would often sit and wait for hours for him to show up for work. Although it was Blair voicing her concerns that got Sheen to flip out and get her fired by text.
What Charlie Sheen wants, he gets. After mounting a campaign to get his co-star on the FX comedy series Selma Blair fired over alleged comments questioning his work ethic, its mission accomplished for Sheen, who reportedly threatened to quit the show if Blair stayed. Anger Management producer Lionsgate just issued a statement, making Blairs dismissal from the show official. We are confirming that Selma Blair will not be returning to Anger Management, and we wish her the very best.
 I really miss Selma's Blair's character fellow therapist Dr. Kate Wales. Please bring back Selma Blair!",1420156800,,1042,4.751381215469613

5897867,5,B00E99FY9K,"Like many people, I was sad, angry, irritated, etc when Two and a Half men got rid of Charlie Sheen. It just wasn't the same show after that.
