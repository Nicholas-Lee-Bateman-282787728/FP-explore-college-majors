8481232,4,6301465024,Got this because of Victoria So Sexy Principal. I think that is her middle name... Holy smoke! Shot on location at some condo over looking Central park. Parts of California towards the end. This movie first introduced me to Elliot Gould which he was perfect for this movie. Everyone knows the charming Diana K! I enjoyed the heck out of this movie many of times and will continue now that I own it.,1467676800,,398,4.465753424657534

8481234,4,6301465024,"This film recalls the old screwball comedies of yore with Elliott Gould doing Rock Hudson, Diane Keaton as Doris Day, and Paul Sorvino doing his best Tony Randall.  It's an old fashioned rom-com informed by a Seventies sensibility.  This is not to say it's raunchy just a little bit naughty.  The restricted rating it was tagged with in 1976 would probably be a PG-13 today.  It helps that Gould as the wily Les and Keaton as the uptight Katie have indelible chemistry. Good supporting turns by Sorvino as Les' lawyer and challenger for Katie's hand and Victoria Principal as a former Playboy centerfold who Les lusts after.  There's nothing new here but in its own unassuming way it is highly entertaining.  This is harmless fluff of the first order.",1379030400,,751,4.782945736434108
8481235,5,6301465024,A little known movie from Gould and Keaton. I saw this in the theater in the 70's and always have remembered it fondly. Too bad it's not on DVD.,1338681600,,144,4.0
