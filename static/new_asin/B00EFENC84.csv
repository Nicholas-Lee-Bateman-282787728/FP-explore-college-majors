8605076,5,B00EFENC84,"Despite the somewhat misleading cover, the great Valerie Harper is actually the main character of this pleasant made-for-TV movie from 1990. The picture quality is excellent, and I'm so glad that another one of Valerie's TV movies has finally made it to dvd.

Valerie stars as a housewife whose husband (Elliott Gould) leaves her for another woman. At first, Valerie seeks revenge, with the help of her best friend (Brenda Vaccaro), but after that, the movie is about Valerie trying to move on, and trying to find a job. She also finds romance with an attractive doctor (Bruce Davison). Eventually Valerie and her ex-husband learn to be civil towards each other, so that they can both attend the wedding of their daughter (Julie Warner).

I highly recommend this movie if you are a Valerie Harper fan, if you like made-for-TV movies, or if you like romantic comedies from the late 1980's/ early 1990's.",1380153600,4,902,4.888888888888889
