4857456,5,B005PTYPK2,"HOORAY! SOMEONE AT PARAMOUNT MUST BE READING THESE CUSTOMER REVIEWS!!!

Gunsmoke, Season 5, Vol. 2 is scheduled to be released on December 13, 2011 - Just 2 months after the October 11, 2011 release date for Season 5, Vol. 1 - and JUST IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS!!!

Thank you, Paramount.

Remember Paramount was the studio that cancelled the original Star Trek TV series and was swamped with so many viewer complaints that they brought the series BACK.

These reviews ARE worth the effort.  Keep up the pressure.  Let the studios know what you want for your hard-earned cash.  And place your ""Pre-Orders"" early - I've already placed mine.  Nothing encourages studios to issue more releases like customers putting their money where their mouths are.

NOW IF WE CAN JUST GET PARAMOUNT TO INCLUDE SOME EXTRAS WITH FUTURE RELEASES...

Hit play all, and you can sit back and watch one episode after the next without budging. Although for some mysterious reason this was the only one of the volumes not with Prime shipping, it still came very quick. And brand spanking new. I am very pleased with this overall, and would definitely recommend this volume without hesitation.",1495929600,,492,4.732558139534884

4857465,5,B005PTYPK2,"This was the number one TV show for this season.  The characters had settled into their roles, the half hour show was perfect for the writers making for great entertainment.  This season, the show expanded beyond the standard western story line. Looking at emotions and failings as much as standard western fair.
Johnny Red, Crowbait Bob and Jailbait Janet are two excellent examples of this expansion.  Both are somewhat comic and at the same time very realistic and human.  This is not to say the season lacks westerns, Horse Deal and Kangaroo is one of the better stories.
The season is split into two purchases and you will want to make both purchases at once.",1477094400,2,664,4.747826086956522

It is amazing to me that the writers were successful in making the plot and storyline consistently excellent and among the best of the classic Westerns from season to season for so many consecutive seasons. I cannot think of one episode to date that felt weak or that let me down.
