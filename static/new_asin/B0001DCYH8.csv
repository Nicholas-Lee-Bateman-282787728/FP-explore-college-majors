8010482,5,B0001DCYH8,"Before Justin Lin's ""Better Luck Tomorrow,"" and the current wave of new Asian-American writers and directors was Daniel Yoon's ""Post-Concussion."" It's tempting to place him at the beginning of the interest in Asian cinema of the past few years, but I believe this work belongs with the tradition of American independents in the vein of writer-directors such as Spike Lee, Kevin Smith, and Rick Linklater. Much like these filmmakers, Daniel Yoon took what resources he had (some of which came as a settlement from an accident he was involved in - shades of Robert Rodriguez's drug test fundraising for ""El Mariachi.) to make his first film, and tell a story he had to tell.

Filled with wit, feeling, and a loose, improvisational style, ""Post-Concussion"" shows its low budget roots in every frame, yet much like the first works of Smith and Lee, there is an undeniable energy and intelligence that informs this movie. Also refreshing is that, unlike many first films from Asian-American directors, though the protagonist (Yoon) is Asian, this is not a film about the Asian experience per se, but rather the experience of being a human being at a crossroads - in short, a film about a universal experience, told from a unique perspective.

It's been over seven years since Daniel Yoon's first film, and I recently heard he's preparing his second feature, also from an original script. I don't know much more than that, but if it's anything like his first film, I know that fans and audiences will be in for a treat.

See it for yourself. ""Post-Concussion,"" a first film from a talented new filmmaker, and hopefully not the last.",1195516800,2,1626,4.884057971014493
8010483,5,B0001DCYH8,"I first discovered POST CONCUSSION at the Austin Heart of Film Festival back in '99.  It was an awkward situation, because I met Danny Yoon the filmmaker and really liked him.  He invited me to come see his film, and I was worried that I wouldn't like it, but felt obliged to attend the screening.

Thankfully I went.  POST CONCUSSION is one of the most charming films I have ever seen.  Although at times it feels like it was glued together, that is one of the film's charms.  Everything about this film is a delight, from the acting to the script to the directing.  I have personally introduced this film to about a dozen people, and I have yet to know anyone who didn't just love it.

It's the story of an aggressive yuppie who gets konked on the head, and is forced to re-evalute his life when he can no longer ""keep up with the Jone's"".  The subtelties of this film as the protagonist moves from cynic to empathetic human involves you, the viewer, so much as a human being, you can't help but laugh along with his absurd journeys ranging from him being an animated slug, to interacting with the television, to him doubting a self-help ""guru"" and finally telling his former co-workers/bosses to shove it.  I am thrilled that this film finally found a distributor.

No offense meant when I say that Danny Yoon is the Asian Woody Allen.  He is a filmmaker who truly knows the language of comedy and cinema and deserves his day in the sun.

POST-CONCUSSION is an absolute delight.",1093046400,9,1481,4.50187265917603
