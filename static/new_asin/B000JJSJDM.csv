8151051,3,B000JJSJDM,"VCI has done a fine job with these films, now if only they would restore them and add subtitles. Both prints are good for low budget, but could be better. Sound is fine on both. These films are not to be missed, if you appreciate film noir. For the price, they are well worth it. Terror Street aka 36 Hours is far better fare than then Wings of Danger aka Dead on Course. Naomi Chance is the only real highlight of the latter. Hammer noir pictures usually have an American title and an English title, for those who do not know.",1170979200,8,527,4.227722772277228
8151052,5,B000JJSJDM,"VCI Entertainment and Kit Parker Films present ""Hammer Film Noir Vol. 4"" (1953) --- (Dolby digitally remastered)...Film noir is a cinematic term used primarily to describe Hollywood crime dramas that set their protagonists in a world perceived as inherently corrupt and unsympathetic...Hollywood's classic film noir period is generally regarded as stretching from the early 1940s to the late 1950s...Film noir of this era is associated with a low-key black-and-white visual style that has roots in German Expressionist cinematography, while many of the prototypical stories and much of the attitude of classic noir derive from the hardboiled school of crime fiction that emerged in the United States during the Depression...the term film noir (French for ""black film""), first applied to Hollywood movies by French critic Nino Frank in 1946, was unknown to most of the American filmmakers and actors while they were creating the classic film noirs..the canon of film noir was defined in retrospect by film historians and critics; many of those involved in the making of film noir later professed to be unaware at the time of having created a distinctive type of film.

First up we have ""TERROR STREET"" (1953) (80 min. B/W) --- Under Montgomery Tully (Director), Anthony Hinds (Producer), Steve Fisher (Screenplay & Story), Ivor Slaney (Original Score), Malcolm Arnold (Stock Music), Walter J. Harvey (Cinematographer), James Needs (Editor) --- the cast includes Dan Duryea (Major Bill Rogers), Eisle Albin (Katherine 'Katie' Rogers), Gudrun Ure (Sister Jenny Miller), Eric Pohlmann (Slossen, the smuggler), John Chandos (Orville Hart), Kenneth Griffith (Henry Slosson), Harold Lang (Harry Cross, desk clerk), Jane Carr (Soup Kitchen Supervisor), Michael Golden (The Inspector), Marianne Stone (Pam Palmer) ------ our story has our hero Dan Duryea as the prime suspect in the murder of his British wife who has been shot ... in this post war film noir Duryea has only 36 hours to discover in his desperation who is the real killer and why ... Duryea is at the top of his game in this British melodrama, as you find yourself completely engulfed in his character and waiting for the next scene to unravel another clue and clear himself ... can he find the real killer before the police track his whereabouts and bring in the wrong suspect ... the scenes between Duryea and John Chandos (the major villain) are riveting.
