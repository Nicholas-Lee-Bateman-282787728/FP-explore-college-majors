2451704,5,B000C1VBAA,"The Golden Girls is without a doubt one of the most memorable sitcoms from the past twenty years,  even while airing six times a day on Lifetime, it's the kind of show that you will never grow tired of.  Beatrice Arthur, Estelle Getty, Rue McClanahan and Betty White make one of TV's great all-women casts, much like the Sex And The City, Designing Women, Desperate Housewives and Facts Of Life casts.

Season four contains several classic episodes during the shows run, including the one where Rose and Dorothy believe they've seen a UFO, and the one where Blanche's brother comes out of the closet to her.

After a seemingly endless wait between seasons 1 and 2 and 2 and 3, Buena Vista have listened to us and are going to be getting these out faster.  This is one of the greatest and funniest sitcoms ever created and long after the girls are dead and gone, this show will be along the lines of Lucy where new generations are still falling in love with the four widows and divorcees from Miami.",1136592000,4,998,4.522222222222222

2451716,5,B000C1VBAA,"""The Golden Girls"" is one of the most acclaimed comedies in television history.  Bea Arthur, Rue McClanahan, Betty White, and Estelle Getty starred as four women living together in a house in Miami.  This DVD set contains all 26 episodes of the fourth season of the series that were originally broadcast on NBC from October 1988 to May 1989.

This sitcom saw the four women through both lighthearted and serious situationssome of the situations typical for the genre include UFOs, a busted air conditioner, a roof leak, practical jokes, and a lottery win, but this season also looked at issues such as blindness, impotence, and painkiller addiction.  Some episodes were also devoted to the relationships the women were involved in, and there were several times that the show flashed back to previous seasons.

Guest stars this season included Julio Iglesias and Bob Hope.  Parents of children who think that this might be a family-friendly comedy should note that there is adult humor throughout, but with that caveat aside, the writing in this classic series was great, with superb repartee among the characters and more laugh-out-loud moments than in most comedies.",1506902400,,1167,5.11578947368421

2451954,5,B000C1VBAA,"I am only going to write one review for all the seasons of my Girls.  I only wished at my age of 63 and alone in this world, that I could find me a Blanch and Dorothy, Rose and Ma to live with and stick together through thick and thin.  Dress up and do things together and be friends to the end.  I was so sad when Rue passed from Breast Cancer and we lost Ma from I think Parkinson disease or Alzheimer's disease.  Then it came for Dorothy, not sure but I think I heard she passed on.  But we still have that wonderful Animal loving woman Betty White, I do not like the way they made her character be so naughty on her latest show, but she does what she wants.  I saw her in this film where she was feeding these baby alligators, they got really big so her and her husband would feed them each a cow.  her husband fell into the water and the friendly gaters ate him.  She got ranch arrest I think... they thought they killed the two adults gaters but at the end they show Betty feeding the offspring of her beloved alligators. forgot the name of the film.

And last but certainly not least, Sophia - Dorothy's Very Italian mother who dishes out pearls of wisdom in between insults and hysterical observations.

Having the opportunity to own each season is a true bonus since most of the stars are no longer with us sharing their mirth on earth.

2452007,3,B000C1VBAA,"I feel like I'm betraying some sort trust by not giving this season 5 stars - but standards and ratings are contextual.  In this case, compared to Seasons 1-3 and 5-7, season 4 earns only 3 stars.  By contrast to other sitcoms, this is still a 5 star season.  Bear that in mind.

This season of Golden Girls had several problems - the characters drifted from their original conceptions but not in consistent ways.  It was established, for example, in earlier episodes that Blanche may have been a man-hungry bed-hopper, but she was also sensitive, loving, and genuine.  In this season, it felt as if her sexuality became her only personality trait; in almost every episode, someone called her a slut; the sensitive caring side of Blanche, the vulnerable woman behind the sexual tiger, vanished.  Rose as well underwent inconsistent changes - in a late season episode, she's given a 30 year drug dependency out of the blue and in the episode Little Sister Rose's behavior just doesn't make sense - rather than the sunny forgive everyone Rose, she's shown as suspicious and distrusting towards her sister and eventually calls her sister a jackass; from Blanche or Dorothy that would make sense but not Rose.  Dorothy and Sophia's relationship changed - Sophia was much more insulting towards Dorothy while Dorothy was much more unkind toward Sophia.

The jokes are still funny and almost every episode has at least one laugh out loud moment, but the creative team was obviously struggling to sort out the show's direction.  Every character got some good moments this season which is nice.  The season finale - We're Outta Here - is the annual clip show that connected the characters and showed us the ways in which they were family.  The obvious chemistry between the actresses compensated for some of the less than stellar writing.

All in all, Season 4 is necessary for completists (i.e. me) and taken on its own terms, highly entertaining and well worth watching.  Season 4 is the the least of seven great seasons of a classic tv show, which is like being the least capable singer in the New York opera - only a problem by contrast to the better singers.",1318204800,3,2155,4.789189189189189
2452008,5,B000C1VBAA,"My wife and I have been watching each season of the Golden Girls. We started with Season 7 when it was given to us as a gift several years ago. When my father was alive and in a nursing home he liked to watch The Golden Girls and when we visited him we would watch a few of them with him and we thought they were very funny. He has been dead for almost 20 years now and we have been watching each year in season order on DVD. And we still think they are very funny.
  The writing, the actors their use of facial expressions and the one liners are all timed very well and cause us to laugh out loud. The series used ""canned laughter"" like many other programs, but it was generally timed to coincide with something that was funny unlike some of today's shows when the laugh track seems to be on at even the most inane comment that an actor makes.",1310947200,,844,4.078313253012048

2452014,5,B000C1VBAA,"It's hard to say that I can add much to the hundreds of reviews already posted, but The Golden Girls upon its debut in 1985 broke much new ground that had never been seen in television until that point and I venture to say ground that has not been touched again even in today's over sexed over exposed culture. Episodes that stand out from Season Four include : The Days and Nights of Sophia Petrillo where Sophia volunteers at a hospital and has a friendship with a young man who has AIDS and the two part Sophias Wedding which includes a hilarious scene with Max and Dorothy in the shower. Blanche gets a visit from her brother who reveals he's gay in ""Scared Straight"" dates a blind man in ""Blind Date"". Rose dates an impotent man in ""The Impotence of Being Earnest"" and has a confrontation with hated younger sister in ""Little Sister."" Dorothy meanwhile dates Eddie a plain packaged love machine in Love Me Tender and is victimized by a practical joke from her high school friend when she kills her in ""Till Death Do We Volley.""",1273449600,,1032,4.49468085106383

2452021,5,B000C1VBAA,"""The Golden Girls"" continued their supremacy at the top of the Saturday night Nielsen ratings on NBC with season four finishing the year at #5. This disc contains 24 excellent episodes, two of which are about an hour in length as that is how they were originally broadcast. This season is notable for the slew of high-profile guest stars that popped up including a young Quentin Tarantino, Bob Hope, and Julio Iglesias. The best episodes are the very first show that aired that season called ""Yes, We Have No Havanas"" in which Blacnhe and Sophia argue over a man. The lines that are exchanged between the two gals are unforgettable especially when Sophia says to Blanche, ""Beat it you fifty year old mattress!"". Another touching episode is ""High Anxiety"" in which the roomates discover that Rose is addicted to presciption medication. The laughs are a mile a minutes, the acting ensemble is better than ever, and this season shows why ""The Golden Girls"" would always have a place in the annals of television excellence.",1249948800,,1019,4.862068965517241

2452024,5,B000C1VBAA,"The Golden Girls-- Beatrice Arthur (Dorothy), Betty White (Rose), Rue McClanahan (Blanche), and Estelle Getty (Sophia)-- reach new heights of hilarity in Season 4 (1988-1989); which may possibly be the best season, overall, of this beloved sitcom. Many of the  best-remembered episodes are here in Season 4, directed by the outstanding Terry Hughes:
  78: Yes, We Have No Havanas: Rose takes a history class from Dorothy in order to finally receive her high school diploma. Blanche and Sophia date the same man. Sophia calls Blanche a ""50 year old mattress.""
79. The Days And Nights Of Sophia Petrillo: Dorothy, Rose, and Blanche spend a lazy day at home while Sophia, on the other hand, has an extremely active day out in the community.
80. The One That Got Away: Rose and Dorothy see a U.F.0. Blanche sets out to seduce the one man she couldn't attract in high school.
81. Yokel Hero: Rose is nominated as ""Woman Of The Year"" in her hometown.
82. Bang The Drum, Stanley: After Sophia is bonked on the head by a baseball, Dorothy's ex-husband Stanley (Herbert Edelman) encourages her to file a phony lawsuit in order to get some quick cash.
83. Sophia's Wedding, Part 1: Jack Gilford guest stars as Max, an old friend of Sophia and her late husband Salvadore. Dorothy is shocked when Sophia and Max plan to get married. Blanche and Rose start an Elvis Presley fan club. Look for an uncredited Quentin Tarantino as one of several Elvis impersonators who attend the wedding.
84. Sophia's Wedding, Part 2: When Max moves in with Dorothy, Rose, Blanche, and Sophia, things get too close for comfort. When Max and Sophia's pizza/knish stand literally goes up in smoke, so does their marriage. Max and Sophia decide to go their separate ways, without getting divorced.
85. Brother, Can You Spare That Jacket: The Girls frantically search for a missing $10,000 lottery ticket, and spend the night in a homeless shelter.
86. Scared Straight: One of my favorite episodes. Blanche's brother Clayton (guest star Monte Markham) fears how Blanche will react when he tells her he is gay.
87. Stan Takes A Wife: When Stan is unusually warm and supportive during Sophia's health crisis, Dorothy discovers she still has feelings for him.
88. The Auction: Desperately in need of cash to repair  a leaking roof, the Girls try to buy a painting; feeling certain the arrogant artist who painted it is on his deathbed.
89. Blind Date: Rose, Dorothy, and Sophia coach a kids football team. Blanche meets the perfect man, (guest star Edward Winter) unaware, at first,  that he is blind.
90. The Impotence Of Being Earnest: In this hilarious episode, Rose helps her boyfriend Ernie overcome a very personal sexual problem.
91. Love Me Tender: Another hilarious episode! Dorothy is initially furious when Sophia sets her up on a blind date. She is soon delighted, however, when she discovers that her  average, meek and mild date Eddie (guest star John Fiedler) is a ""love machine"" in bed.
92. Valentine's Day: The Girls recall Valentine's Days that went terribly wrong; including a trip to a nudist resort, and a trip to the drug store to buy condoms.
93. Two Rode Together: Dorothy's desire to spend more quality time with Sophia nearly drives Sophia nuts. Meanwhile, Rose and Blanche attempt to write a children's book together.
94. You Gotta Have Hope: There's no talent in the charity talent show, and no M.C, . either. Rose, however, remains convinced that Bob Hope will appear and make her dream come true.  The Girls cross-dress as men while searching for Bob Hope in a locker room.  Guest starring Douglas Searle, The Del Rubbio Triplets, and Bob Hope.
95. Fiddler On The Ropes: Things are more rocky than ""Rocky"" when Sophia invests all the Girls' money in a Cuban prize-fighter named Kid Pepe, who would rather be an actor/muscian than a fighter.
96. Till Death Do We Volley: The friendly ""rivalry"" and practical jokes between Dorothy and her high school friend Trudie ( guest star Anne Francis) goes wildly out of control.
97. High Anxiety: Sophia appears in a pizza commercial. Dorothy and Blanche discover that Rose has a serious addiction to pain pills. Guest starring Jay Thomas.
98. Little Sister; Everyone loves Rose's younger sister Holly (guest star Inga Swenson), except Rose, that is.
99. Sophia's Choice: Sophia helps her friend Lillian escape from ""Sunny Pastures"" nursing home. Dorothy and Sophia soon discover that, due to limited resourses and increasing budget cuts, nursing homes struggle and barely meet the ""minimum standard"" requirements.
100. Rites Of Spring: Desperately needing to diet, the Girls recall their previous attempts at self-improvement.
101. Foreign Exchange: Due to a 60 year old hospital mix-up, Dorothy fears she is not Sophia's daughter.
102-103: We're Outta Here. Parts 1 and 2: A ""For Sale"" sign is accidentally put on the lawn. When Blanche receives a large financial offer, she considers selling the house. Thus, the Girls recall the wild and wacky things they have shared over the years together.

2452046,3,B000C1VBAA,"Picture it.

Miami. 1985.

4 'women of a certain age' living the single life and sharing house.

The Golden Girls was one of favourite comedy shows in the 1980's -and it lasted for 8 years - it rivaled 'Cheers' & 'The Cosby Show' as one of the most popular sitcoms of the 1980's and early 1990's.

OK so the fashions are still offensive...God knows how much fabric Dorothy ( Bea Arthur) covered herself in...or the Mumsie suit dresses Rose ( Betty White) wore...while Sophia (Estelle Getty) wore clothes older than her ( and funnily enough she was playing Dorothy''s mother - was was younger than her!)..Blanche (Rue McClanahan) is the one who still looks good..if not a little like mutton-dressed as mutton.

OK so I'm a bit cruel and the fashion hasn't aged well...but the jokes have...unlike Season 1,2 & 3 there was a change of scriptwriters so the jokes & gags aren't as funny, but still very much watchable. Sophia's story's are still funny (especially the old days in Sicily & Brooklyn) and some of her one liners are still magic, for example:-

Sophia (now a coach) enters into the house with the team after winning a game and announces

'Make way for the Victors!' Rose asks if the team won. Sophia replies

' No we just all changed our names to Victor'

Yes the jokes are still there about deranged animals and lunatics of St Olaf, Blanche's Men and Dorothy's lack of Men...some of the storey lines do push it though - like Rose becoming 'Woman of the Year', Sophia's getting married & how they all buy and manage a Boxer(ideas were obviously thin this season and they were entering into jumping the shark waters)...Don't even ask about the fake flashback episode about Valentine Day! ( which is a shame as they do flashback episodes quite well throughout the seasons)

Overall for the fans this is one they will treasure - for others - stick to Volumes 1,2,3 & the final season ( all the same writers).

The episode - til death do we volley - is an excellent example of how great this season was, it is hilarious from start to finish and full of funny twists.

The times when Rose begins to tell a St Olaf story are often met by much more bitchiness that before and you can see how each character's personality has been developed since the show started.

I ordered this DVD for use in the UK as unfortunately no more series are being released in Europe due to poor sales of the previous three. I found that it played fine in my multi-region DVD player, and came with better packaging too.",1159056000,5,813,4.300653594771242

2452061,5,B000C1VBAA,"Making its debut in the fall of 1985, The Golden Girls quickly established itself as a fixture of Saturday night prime time television. Following the lives of four older women living together as roommates in Miami, the show displayed a raw wit and a biting humor. The women live in the house of Blanche Devereaux (Rue McClanahan), a Southern belle who loves men of every kind and has dated every eligible bachelor in the Miami area. Her roommates are former high school teacher Dorothy Zbornak (Bea Arthur) and St. Olaff housewife and widower Rose Nylund (Betty White). Rose loves to tell stories about her former hometown, much to the chagrin of the other girls. The three are joined by Dorothy's mother, firebrand Sophia Petrillo (Estelle Getty), a spunky Italian immigrant who always speaks her mind. In her early-eighties, Sophia may walk at a measured pace, but the velocity of her sarcasm only increases with age.

Overall, this is a charming situation comedy with likeable characters who have certainly developed their own unique identities. Although some parts of the show tend to be used over and over again (such as the St. Olaff stories and Dorothy's reaction to them), The Golden Girls never seems to grow tiresome. With powerful performances from each of the cast members, viewers will find that Sophia's wit steals the show...

The Golden Girls (Season 4) DVD offers a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""Yes, We Have No Havanas"" in which Blanche and Sophia discover that they're both dating the same sweet-talking Cuban, prompting a heated competition for his affections... Other notable episodes include ""The Auction"" in which the girls try to pay for a new roof by profiting from the impending death of a celebrated painter, and ""You Gotta Have Hope"" in which Dorothy's hospital charity event is headed for disaster, at least until Rose reveals that her father, Bob Hope, will perform at the show...

2452062,5,B000C1VBAA,"I am 29 years of age.  I started watching ""The Golden Girls"" in my early 20s.  I still don't understand what drew me to this show.  Probably because my parents wouldn't let me watch it as a young child.  During college, living at home, my younger sister and I, who shared a room, would stay up watching the reruns on Lifetime Television till midnight.  We call each other ""G-Girls.""  The comedy is quick and snappy.  I especially love the sarcasm and glimpses of love between Dorothy and Sophia. Long live the stories from Sophia!  I don't know why I started watching this show.  I do not watch it to make fun of old people, rather, it gives me hope that life doesn't stop just because you get a few gray hairs.  This show proves that the golden years truly are golden!",1143849600,6,769,4.390070921985815

During the Fourth Season ""The Golden Girls"" were at the top of their game. It doesn't get much better than this.

It's very sad that sitcoms no longer capture the warmth or comedy that ""The Golden Girls"" always had. Why can't the broadcast networks get their act together and make TV like this today?",1142640000,24,498,4.6477272727272725

This series is SO timeless. My daughter is 5 and she loves it!!

My husband even loves it! Even though we seen all the episodes time after time, it doesn't matter.

2452073,5,B000C1VBAA,"""The Golden Girls"" continued to be the funniest show on TV as it went into Season Four. Dorothy, Rose, Blanche, and Sophia were all back together for another hilarious season. As far as where this season ranks with the three previous seasons, Season Four doesn't quite top Season Two. But it's right up there with Season One and Season Three, which is an amazing accomplishment. ""The Golden Girls"" was definitely at its peak when the fourth season aired.

SEASON FOUR (1988-89)
It's very hard for any TV show to continue being at the top of its game while going into a four season on the air. But ""The Golden Girls"" continued to excel and succeed as the fourth season played out. Episodes from Season Four to remember: Blanche and Sophia vying for the affections of a charming old Cuban guy; Rose winning the award as St. Olaf's Woman of the Year, and the girls traveling to Rose's home state of Minnesota for the awards ceremony; Sophia getting knocked on the head by a baseball at a baseball game; Sophia marrying her late husband's best friend; Blanche's brother who pays a visit and breaks some shocking news to Blanche; Blanche dating a blind man; Dorothy dating a man who, despite his plain looks, turns out to be the greatest lover she's ever had; the girls flashing back to Valentine's Day disasters; the girls putting together a charity variety show and trying to get Bob Hope to be their emcee (after Rose admits that Bob Hope is her father!); Rose trying to break an addiction of pills; the girls trying to get an old friend of Sophia's out of a nursing home that looks like a slum; the discovery that Dorothy might not be Sophia's daughter; and Blanche attempting to sell her house.

After being rewarded with Emmys and Golden Globes for the first three seasons, the awards parade stopped for ""The Golden Girls"" after season four in 1989. After receiving 15 Emmy nominations and 4 wins for Season One, 14 Emmy nominations and 3 wins for Season Two, 12 Emmy nominations and 3 wins for Season Three, ""The Golden Girls"" received 10 Emmy nominations for Season Four and ended up being shut out. That was not right. One Emmy it should have won for its fourth season was for Estelle Getty, who I thought was going to repeat as Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for the second season in a row. But Rhea Perlman ended up winning the Emmy in a shocking upset as Best Supporting Actress for her role as Carla on ""Cheers"", and was her fourth win in that category. The Emmy should have gone to Getty, who was just as funny in Season Four as she was in Seasons One, Two, and Three. She continued to get the biggest laughs and continued to steal the show from her three co-stars Beatrice Arthur, Betty White, and Rue McClanahan (who all lost the Best Actress in a Comedy Series Emmy to Candice Bergen, winning her first of five Emmys for ""Murphy Brown""). But still, 10 Emmy nominations is quite an honor for a fourth season of a show. Many times a show loses Emmy steam when it gets to its fourth season (not always, but sometimes).

Season Four of ""The Golden Girls"" featured some unforgettable guest stars. As a matter of fact, probably the most memorable guest appearence on ""The Golden Girls"" in its entire seven year run came in Season Four. It's the most memorable because the guest star turned out to be one of the greatest Hollywood entertainers of our time. That guest star was the great Bob Hope, who made a surprise cameo appearence as himself in the episode ""You Gotta Have Hope"", which is the one where Rose thinks Bob Hope is her father. Other guest stars included Jack Gilford (from ""Cocoon"") as Sophia's new husband in the two-part episode ""Sophia's Wedding""; Monte Markham as Blanche's brother with a dark secret in the episode ""Scared Straight""; John Fiedler as Dorothy's plain-looking new lover in the episode ""Love Me Tender""; Latin singer Julio Iglesias as himself in the ""Valentine's Day"" episode; Anne Francis as Dorothy's old school chum and competitive rival in the episode ""Till Death Do We Volley""; Jay Thomas (from ""Murphy Brown"") as a TV commercial director in the episode ""High Anxiety""; Inga Swenson (from ""Benson"") as Rose's little sister who comes to visit and charms Dorothy and Blanche but constantly keeps giving Rose the shaft in the episode ""Little Sister""; and Ellen Albertini Dow (seen recently in the smash hit comedy ""Wedding Crashers"") as Sophia's friend stuck in a nasty nursing home in the episode ""Sophia's Choice"". Also making an appearence on ""The Golden Girls"" during Season Four was a then unknown Quentin Tarantino (several years before becoming a top-notch director of feature films such as ""Pulp Fiction"" and the two ""Kill Bill"" movies) as an Elvis impersonator in part 1 of the episode ""Sophia's Wedding"".

""The Golden Girls"": The Complete Fourth Season is a great TV show to add to you're DVD collection if you're a big fan of the show. I'm currently watching the episodes of Season Four, and I've been laughing my head off just like I did when I first saw these episodes over 15 years ago.",1140566400,7,5052,4.679415073115861
2452074,5,B000C1VBAA,"Season 4 of the Golden Girls is here now, and if you have any doubts as to its pedigree, just look at the sales figures.

Seriously! Other classic 80s TV series like Dynasty, Dallas, and Twin Peaks have all mysteriously stopped coming - due to poor sales. The Golden Girls is one TV run that we may well see released as a whole. Which is very, very good news.

Anyway, back to the review at hand. Season 4 of the Golden Girls does two quite important things: it removes almost all of the pop culture references that littered Season 3, making its appeal even more universal, and it continues to build on the strong roots of multidimensionality laid down for each character in Season 3.

For example, the 2-parter 'Sophia's Wedding' shows that Estelle Getty isn't simply playing Sophia for wisecracks - there's some very funny humanity in there, too. 'Scared Straight' has probably Rue McClanahan's funniest scene so far (dealing with the acceptance of her gay brother's coming out) and shows more of the versatility of the actress who so often gets predictable, if likeable, one-liners about her sexual past. Dorothy and Rose have similar depth added to them, ""Two Rode Together"" shows a manic and unreasonable side to the normally intractable Dorothy and 'The Impotence of Being Ernest' brings out the bitch in Rose Nylund.

Situations run a gamut here, too, from homeless shelters to hospitals to questionable retirement homes to an hilarious little-old-lady beauty parlour run by recurring guest star Lloyd Bochner (Cecil Colby from 'Dynasty', fact fans).

Writing is as together and as solid as ever, and, as a collaborative effort, ""Golden Girls - The Complete Fourth Season"" deserves top marks for sheer entertainment value.",1140480000,6,1729,4.968858131487889
