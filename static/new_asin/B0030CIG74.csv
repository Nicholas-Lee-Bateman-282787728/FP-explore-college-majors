4043503,4,B0030CIG74,"I purchased this set from an ad on TV and paid only $50.00 plus shipping and they allowed 3 ""easy payments"". I so loved these movies every Saturday afternoon for the longest time. Now I am looking forward to maybe one day having a grandchild that will grow to love them as much as I did. Truly a bargain, and you have the choice to watch each one in either black & white or color!",1319673600,35,380,4.08
4043504,5,B0030CIG74,"This DVD set is a wonderful collection of 18 of Shirley Temple's movies and makes a great gift, but please do your research when purchasing. This collection is available new for $49.98 from the ""as seen on tv"" offer.",1296777600,120,216,4.564102564102564
4043505,5,B0030CIG74,"This is truly a Darling Collection.  I was pleasantly surprised to receive this set because each DVD allows for a choice of Black and White or Color. I randomly selected ""Heidi"" to watch out of 18 of the Shirley Temple Movies. I watched half of it in Color, the other half in B&W, enjoyed both without commercial interruption, and watched the original full length movie without narration or any other added balderdash.  I purchased this collection for my one and only grandchild Elizabeth.  She will enjoy these movies throughout the years as I have.  I prefer the B&W only because that's how I originally saw them when I was a young child.  Sounds like a great new Sunday evening at 4 pm tradition to me. The quality of these DVD's are excellent coming from 1934 Masters.  Shirley Temple Movies are priceless, so for the price I paid, it was very well worth it. I received the packaged collection very promptly,without damage, and received exactly what was ordered.",1283385600,276,966,4.754491017964072

4043524,3,B0030CIG74,"Based on other customer reviews, I expected all films to be available in color as well as in black and white.  Therefore, I was disappointed that Stand Up and Cheer, Stowaway, and Young People were in black and white only and that the color version of Wee Willie Winkie was actually ""tinted,"" which I thought made it look odd.  I also felt that some of the films, particularly the early ones in which Shirley is very young, were not the best DVD quality.  The films were certainly watchable, but they had a kind of fuzzy look to them, and I feel the color versions I have on VHS are better picture quality.  As someone who particularly enjoys those earlier films, that was a big disappointment  That being said, as a huge Shirley Temple fan, I am not upset I purchased the collection.",1464912000,,784,4.492957746478873

4043538,5,B0030CIG74,"I grew up watching these, and love them still! Having them in one collection (most of my favorites) is fantastic. Watching them as an adult I appreciate so much more the times these represented. I found myself turning one off because my brain couldn't keep up with the stereotyping of the black characters. But as a lesson in how far we've come and one little girl's unending optimism in the face of unimaginable trials, it is a blessing. I hope you enjoy these as much as I do, and think we should share them with the next generations. I think they give up hope even now. :)",1458432000,,575,4.383177570093458

4043571,2,B0030CIG74,"I thought it was going to be really good because I'm a huge fan of Shirley Temple.  I have got rid of all my VHS movies I collected over the years of hers. I was disappointed that the box was a little wrinkled due to it not being place in the box properly. I also was disappointed that three movies were or four were in black and white. Young people, stowaway, stand up and cheer and wee Willie winkie. But I was more upset that every time I went to play the movie the movies on some disc was ok but other would stop and freeze and I would have to start over again. Plus Shirley other movies such as poor little rich girl, and our little girl is not in the collection at all only on VHS.",1436659200,4,687,3.9782608695652173

There are so many of her greatest films in this collection and I love that each disk gives you the option to watch in color or black and white (original) version.  My grandmother used to watch these with me and now I am able to share them with my niece.  The only disappointment I have in this box set is how the movies are stored within the sleeves,  they are simply stuck in cardboard pockets which makes it easier to accidentally scratch a disk despite the fact that the box is gorgeous.  I would recommend this despite this one minor flaw but encourage purchasing a more protective DVD storage binder to safely store the disks,  which is what I will be doing.",1425340800,,710,4.430769230769231

4043736,5,B0030CIG74,"This is a great box set of eighteen earlier Shirley Temple films on DVD ... Most of the films have the option of watching them in the original black and white or switching to the new colorized version ... Shirley is, without a doubt, THE GREATEST CHILD STAR WHO WILL EVER BE ... And there are times in these films where she proves herself to be a great dramatic actress as well... Shirley Temple made the 1930s much brighter for the people of the depression era and now she can make this current era much brighter for all of us !!!",1421280000,,531,4.267326732673268

Now I can finally get rid of my old VHS player, which I kept only for the Shirley Temple tapes. This is the first time ever I had her films on DVD and I am just amazed at how much better it is. All 18 films are just amazing, 9 of which I've never seen or only seen once or twice until now. The restoring process is clearly the best ever, for each film has much better quality including better color (even the black and white versions look much nicer) and better sound.",1420848000,,581,3.9322033898305087

It was a ""deal of the week"" that was emailed to me in April so I purchased it then.  My mother's birthday is in July.  I gave them to her on her birthday and we sat down to watch them.  There were a few that were playable but most of them would not play at all or ""froze up"" during the intro.  I tried returning them and was told that I had passed the window for returning the item.  Fortunately, Amazon (because of their awesome customer service) allowed me to return them for a refund.  I decided to try ordering another set to see if it was any better.  It was NOT.  Same problem.  I then returned them for a full refund and just threw down and paid around $80 bucks for the America's Sweetheart set that comes three DVD's to a set.  But hey, at least we can watch them.  I don't know why some people had sets that gave them no problems and some that did.  Guess we are just unlucky.  BTW we had had NO problems with any other DVDs on our player so that wasn't the problem.  If you order these just be aware that you COULD have difficulties.",1409270400,4,1290,4.124497991967871

My favorite ""Shirley"" film is ""Poor LIttle Rich Girl"" with a great story of how a very rich Shirley decided to go on a vacation and see how other people live, but ends up on the radio. It is no where to be found in this DVD collection! Poor Little Rich Girl has amazing, difficult choreography with Shirley, Alice Faye and Jack Haley at the end of the film. Also, at one point in the film, Shirley's ""Dad"" lifts her up to carry her and the actor mistakenly pulls up a bit too much of Shirley's dress and it shows the real Shirley at such a young age being very modest, looking around and down to see if there is too much for all to see. Director probably left that part in to show how real Shirley always was. Also, amazing songs and dances throughout. Jack Haley, the Tin Man in ""Wizard"", great warmth, fun to watch.

4043922,4,B0030CIG74,"* When ordering the Shirley Temple Little Darling Collection, I was misled by the Editorial Review.  There are 18 titles in the Little Darling Collection.  The Editorial Review appeared to be an exhaustive list, but it actually listed only 14 titles, and left out these four:  Stowaway; Susannah of the Mounties; Wee Willie Winkie; and Young People.  Because Stowaway was not listed in the Editorial Review, I ordered it as a separate DVD.  When the Little Darling Collection arrived in the mail, I was disappointed to learn that I had ordered Stowaway unnecessarily because it is included in the collection.  So, be aware that only 14 of the 18 titles are listed in the Editorial Review, and don't double-order as I did.  * I like the way the 18 DVDs are packaged.  There are three trifold folders, with each folder holding 6 DVDs -- 2 DVDs on each trifold.  Each DVD has a slot to slip into and be held securely  --  unlike some packaging that uses plastic boxes with a too-tight center anchor to hold the disk in, creating the possibility of breaking the DVD when trying to release it from the anchor.  * I enjoyed re-watching the movies, and was reminded that some pretty-neat special effects were used in some of the movies.  In particular, ""Curly Top"" includes a delightful dream sequence in which Shirley Temple is dressed as a character in a 3-dimensional recreation of famous works of art.  * I already had several Shirley Temple movies in my VHS and DVD collection, but I was glad to obtain the additional titles in the Little Darling Collection.  With the passing of Shirley Temple Black on Feb. 10, 2014, I wanted to have access to more of her beloved movies so I can  continue to admire her exceptional talent, and celebrate her exceptional life.",1402099200,4,1759,4.699346405228758

4043928,5,B0030CIG74,"I love Shirley Temple. Other kids watched Barney in the 1990s. I hung out with my Depression-era grandparents and watched ""Captain January"" and ""Little Miss Broadway"" while eating baked apples, curled up under a hand-knit blanket.

Just before Shirley Temple Black passed away I started checking out her films from the library, and I eventually purchased this set to watch with my grandmother. I can't do anything but praise this collection. The films each come on their own DVD (""Wee Willie Winkie"" is double sided, one version the original sepia), the folders have clear, big photographs of Shirley in various roles and short film summaries, and each movie (except ""Stowaway"") is offered in color or black and white. The films are well preserved; there is no dust littering the screen and the dialogue and music is clear. ""Little Miss Marker"" and ""Now and Forever"" are not included, but they were made by other studios with Temple on loan-out so perhaps that is why. (""Our Little Girl"" does not seem to have been released except on VHS either; it is another serious Shirley Temple role and worth a watch if you can find it.)

Many people have noted that some of Temple's films are outright racist. This is true, and there is little point in denying it. The minstrel show at the end of ""Dimples"" made me cringe, as did the depiction of Frank Morgan's ""butler"". ""The Littlest Rebel"" even implies that African Americans enjoyed slavery. However, to toss Temple's movies aside because of these things would be a mistake, and censoring them, as my grandparents did, does a disservice to the intelligence of children. America has a history of racism. Because of Temple's continuing popularity, we forget that these films were made in the 1930s and are products of their time.

Yes, you should let your kids watch them because they need to know that at one point (and still today) we treated other people horribly because of their skin color. It is a fact, and one that should be remembered and discussed. And one excellent contradiction to the studio system's inherent racism is Temple's brilliant partnering with the insanely talented Bill Robinson (Will anyone ever again tap dance like Robinson? Likely not.). Temple, placed in films with racist overtones by the studio, was the first white woman to dance with a Black man on screen, and she held his hand. In many ways, Robinson's roles were meant to support how Black men and women were seen by society, but Robinson played his roles with quite a few notes of subversiveness. It's disappointing that he didn't have more screen time.

You can avoid the racist issues of several of Temple's films or you can confront it and see the problems as a learning experience. I will not lie and say it is a comfortable experience, but it is one necessary to have. In any case, how wonderful that seemingly simplistic films made with a 1930s child star can reveal so much and inspire such discussion.

Note: Shirley Temple Black wrote her autobiography ""Child Star"" about her time in the movies, and it is hilarious, smart, and heartbreaking. It is sadly out of print but available from many used book sellers and libraries. Definitely worth a read.",1401235200,,3188,4.831501831501831

I'm not sure what the negative reviewers were looking at, but it was not this set. Most of the original black and white films have been colorized from restored footage. All are clean for the era, although some jittering is noticeable for some of the credits (not unusual for films this old - even recent films often have jittering credits).

The following films are included:
Baby Take A Bow (1934) B&W original and colorized versions
The Blue Bird (1940) Color original only -- filmed in Technicolor
Bright Eyes (1934) B&W original and colorized versions
Captain January (1936) B&W original and colorized versions
Curly Top (1935) B&W original and colorized versions
Dimples (1936) B&W original and colorized versions
Heidi (1937) B&W original and colorized versions
Just Around the Corner (1938) B&W original and colorized versions
The Little Colonel (1935) B&W original and colorized versions
Little Miss Broadway (1938) B&W original and colorized versions
The Little Princess (1939) Color original only -- filmed in Technicolor
The Littlest Rebel (1935) B&W original and colorized versions
Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1938) B&W original and colorized versions
Stand Up and Cheer (1934) B&W only -- Note: This is the edited 69 minute version, not the full 81 minute original.
Stowaway (1936) B&W original only -- Note: This film was the center of a lot of controversy for plagiarism when it was released.
Susannah of the Mounties (1938) B&W original and colorized versions
Wee Willie Winkie (1938) B&W original and sepia tinted versions
Young People (1940) B&W original only

A Number of Shirley's films were not included in this set:
Change of Heart (1934) - Usually not included in any collection -- Shirley played a minor supporting role
Little Miss Marker (1934) - A Paramount film, not included in Fox collections
Now I'll Tell (1934) - Usually not included in any collection -- Shirley played a supporting role behind Spencer Tracy, Alice Faye and others
Now and Forever (1934) - Another Paramount release, not included in Fox collections. Stars Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard.
Our Little Girl (1935) - For some reason, this film is not currently being sold new or available in any collection.
Poor Little Rich Girl (1936) - A Fox release that was not included. Shirley has top billing, so its absence is curious.

The two Paramount films are available in a separate collection that also includes ""The Runt Page"", a short from 1932 and Temple's first screen appearance.

This set is packaged in three heavy stock tri-folds, which hold the discs securely in slots. The three ""volumes"" are in a slip case, which adds to the protection and gripping quality of the individual volumes, which hold six discs each. (Note: The volumes are sold separately, and it is possible that the complaints about loose discs came from these.)

The discs are not packaged in chronological order, just as the early VHS set was not ordered chronologically, even though they were numbered. Comparing the two (VHS against the DVDs in this set), the DVDs have a better picture and sound (which is to be expected). They were originally shot in 35 millimeter stock, and the restoration has eliminated many of the ""age"" problems that plagued the original stock. They are not HD quality, just as very few films that were originally shot on 35 mm stock are ever that quality. Compared against the Blu-ray Wizard of Oz (Judy Garland), these measure up in terms of picture quality, which occasionally shows some graininess (not noticeable, except on HD 1080 displays).

Two Fox films are missing from this collection: Our Little Girl and Poor Little Rich Girl. I'm not sure why they were omitted, but they were. Both have been colorized and aside from not being included in this package, they are restored and available in both B&W and Color.

I have serious doubts about the negative reviews came from people who received the set I received. The discs are securely held, had no problems playing in any DVD or Blu-ray player (computer or stand-alone), did not exhibit any of the ""coating"" that many complained about, and were as good as any commercially-produced DVDs from Fox. Those who complained about the discs not playing should invest in a disc player cleaning disc or a new player. It is also possible their player is slightly out of alignment.

Four stars, mostly for being an incomplete set of Fox films from the era. Had the two missing films (Our Little Girl and Poor Little Rich Girl), the full 81 minute original release of Stand Up and Cheer been included, and colorized versions of the three B&W only films and Wee Willie Winkie, provided, this would have been an excellent addition to anyone's collection and worthy of five stars.",1398643200,21,4820,4.964064436183396

4043953,5,B0030CIG74,"I have wanted a number of these movies before, but the cost to collect them individually was always prohibitive.  And sometimes a good movie would be coupled on a disc or within a set with a lot of stuff I frankly had no interest in - stuff for the particularly devoted Shirley Temple fans and not just for people fond of particular films.  I bought this set because it had *every* movie I wanted to own, including the sometimes hard-to-find ""The Blue Bird"" which I have loved since I was a child.  It also had some movies I'd not seen, but which are still ""canonical"" like ""Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.""  Now, I confess I haven't watched every disc yet, though ""The Blue Bird"" was as excellent as I'd remembered it and the film quality was great.  But I am very pleased that this appears to be a quality collection, with real thought and care put into the selection, assembly, and production.

I was a little nervous after reading the reviews and saw that some were having problems with the sets. When mine arrived I inspected each disc. The only one that seemed to have spots was the double sided disc. After watching every single one, I did not have a single problem with any of them. Not all of the movies are colorized but really, why is this an issue? They came out in black and white. I can understand why some might like it better. I choose the colorized versions myself. But watching the ones that are only in black and white are just as enjoyable. It's all about the charm of a darling little girl that stole the hearts of everyone who watched her. With a set like this being released at an affordable price, her legacy will live on forever. With 18 of her movies in this set, there is something for everyone.

I remember Sunday mornings when I was a kid, CKLW in Windsor, Ontario played a Shirley Temple movie every week. I think I saw them all 5-6 times each by the time I was 12!  I like to watch these on gloomy Sunday mornings now to brighten my day! These are all of her best movies as a Child actor. It's interesting that The Blue Bird is in this collection, as it wasn't very well received in it's day as being too dark and morbid, coming out during WWII. I'm surprised Little Miss Marker isn't in this collection, as it was an interesting story. Probably left out because it isn't PC; has to do with horse racing (animal abuse), gambling (addiction) and chattelism. But it was one of Shirley's real tear-jerker movies done when she was barely 6, I think.

Sound and picture quality are excellent. I prefer the black & white but my grandchildren, who only know of black & white films from me, prefer the colorized versions.

I first watch these around 30 years ago and loved them then,  so I was so excited to be able to  get a whole set of the movies I loved growing up!  I was surprised about the choice between the black-and-white and the colorized versions.  I am a big fan black-and-white movies and often don't like the colorized versions. After watching one black-and-white version , I decided to watch the colorized version of the same movie and was pleasantly surprised. It was done very well and the quality was excellent!!! I highly recommend this box set and I'm so happy I made the purchase!",1393372800,,680,4.416

Definitely was sad to hear of her passing two weeks ago. I'm so glad that I have the collection, because I know that it probably would have been more, due to her passing. Thnks",1393200000,,440,4.5125

Also, the movies aren't in cronilogical order. I wanted to watch them in order to watch her grow. While trying to figure out which movie was the earliest, I realized there were 2 copies of one movie & no copy of ""Heidi"", which was supposed to be there & one of my favorites. I sent the whole thing back. Maybe technology needs to improve to meet my expectations.",1393113600,,516,4.222222222222222

4044028,5,B0030CIG74,Shirley is (was) a national treasure. I loved watching her when I was a kid. If I were her parent she would have had me wrapped around her fingers. There is no way I could have said no to her. She was just that adorable. To see her smiling and dancing with Bill Robinson is priceless. That scene I watch over and over. Shirley Temple was truly a doll who came to life.,1392249600,2,368,4.054794520547945
4044029,5,B0030CIG74,"Shirley Temple (aka Shirley Temple Black after her marriage to Charles Black) has left us; I am genuinely very, very saddened by her passing. I always loved her movies and this excellent set of 18 of her movies really is a must-have for any Shirley Temple fan! Shirley could sing, dance and actand what a performer she was born to be! The films we get here include: Bright Eyes from 1934; Curly Top from 1935; Heidi from 1937; The Littlest Rebel from 1935; Baby Take a Bow from 1934; The Blue Bird from 1940; Captain January from 1936; Dimples which is also from 1936; Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm from 1938; Stand Up and Cheer from 1934; Stowaway from 1936; Susannah of the Mounties from 1939; Wee Willie Winkie from 1937; Young People from 1940; Just Around the Corner from 1938; The Little Colonel from 1935;  The Little Princess from 1939 and Little Miss Broadway from 1938. Every films a wonderful one with Shirley in them; and the others in the cast enhance each film as well.

In addition, for most of these films you can choose how you watch them (each on its own DVD)most of these films are presented here in both color or black and white. However, The Blue Bird and The Little Princess are in color only while Stand Up and Cheer; Young People Stowaway are in black and white only. Wee Willie Winkie is presented in a tinted type of black and white. Nevertheless, the quality of each print is really pretty good!

When I watch these films, I can instantly tell just how special and unique Shirleys talent truly was: she could light up the screen with her energy and when they say she brought smiles to a world weary of the Great Depression its undeniably truejust one viewing of any or all of these films proves it! I myself feel uplifted as I watch Shirley in each film. Although she made eventually fewer films as time went by, Shirleys films remain extremely entertaining and enjoyable even in our times.

I highly recommend this extensive DVD set for any Shirley Temple fan and even relative newcomers to Shirleys talent will be delighted with these films and watch them over and over again in the future. Great job and thank you for everything, Shirley!",1392076800,96,2165,4.572164948453608
4044030,5,B0030CIG74,"First I have to say that I'm SO HAPPY I bought this collection before this beautiful icon passed away. It didn't take long for these ""sellers"" to UP the price. BIG surprise..NOT.

Now for the review... the DVD collection is WELL worth buying, but NOT at these current prices. As you may have already read, the transfer quality is really good and they did NOT cram all her movies onto the same disk. Watching these will bring back good memories and will make great new ones with your children, grandchildren..... you get the idea. You'll never tire of watching because she was so talented. You watch her dance moves and you can't help but stare in awe what she could do at such a young age. They will ALL be your favorite movie. Not disappointed in the least with this collection. Check around though because they are now selling for $69.99. I paid $49.99 on Amazon before she passed away.",1392076800,3,888,4.55

I checked the listing of movies on this set, and Little Miss Marker was included, however, when she started looking through the discs, that's the ONE movie that's NOT in the set! How they left that out, I'm not sure, but it's advertised as being one of the 18 movies!  I can't find this movie on any other set, even though I bought ""Smiles and Curls"", and ""Early Years, Vol 1 & 2"" for some of the other movies not on the 18 DVD set.  I just wish they had ALL the movies available without selling numerous DVD's with the SAME movies.  I thought by buying the last two dvd's, she would have just about every Shirley Temple movie.

4044039,2,B0030CIG74,"I saw on the reviews that the quality control of this set was poor, with many reported unplayable disks.  But when I saw it on a lightening deal, I decided to risk it, hoping the defects had been cleared up. When they arrived, I checked each disk for playability.  Four of the eighteen were unplayable (Bright Eyes (my favorite of the movies), Littlest Rebel, Rebecca and Young People).  I checked for the sticky substance others had reported as being a problem but my disks looked clean and relatively unmarred -- they are in cheap slot packaging so of course all the disks had fallen out of the paper slots during shipment, but scratches or dirt didn't seem to be the issue. I think they are just bad. Since other reviewers have indicated replacement sets were equally problematic I'm not even trying, just returning it for a refund. I probably should have paid heed to the reviewers who warned of this problem.  It's hard to know how to ""rate"" something like this.",1390953600,29,967,4.637426900584796
4044040,5,B0030CIG74,"I bought this when it was on special for $30.  I was a little nervous after reading the reviews about scratched and ""sticky"" discs, but decided to risk it.

My set came in perfect condition.  The package itself was perfect and the discs were in fine shape, no scratches at all, no stickiness.  There were some scuffs on the top side of ""Wee Willie Winkie"", that disc is a ""flipper.""  It has the B&W version on one side and the tinted version on the other.  The scuffed side is the one with the B&W version, which I probably won't watch anyway.  I will check to see if it affects the playback.

My copy came directly from Amazon.com, not a 3rd party seller (maybe that made a difference in disc and package condition).

I haven't played the movies yet, I just got it today, but if I have any issues I'll update this review.

Edit:  I checked all my discs, they all play perfectly.
These are the same discs they sell in the ""America's Sweetheart"" 3 pack collections.  I checked one out of our local library to see...and they are exactly the same.  Just FYI for anyone wondering, as this collection is cheaper.",1390953600,6,1107,4.420792079207921

Until you have had the opportunity to compare these two formats side-by-side, you will have no idea just how many things remain hidden in all the gray of Black & White film.  Even in a motion picture that you may have seen so many times that you have the dialog and stage directions memorized, when it's colorized; the actor's skin tones, hair color, and the wardrobes, the clouds, vistas, and the panoramas, the scenery, sets, and the vintage props, all of this and much more jumps out at you so fast, it's as though you had never seen the film before!  And, when you try to watch the film as it was before, a monochromatic malaise sets in and your yawns are not far behind!  I bought this as a gift, thinking it was just another old song and dance DVD.  What I got instead was hours and hours of family fun!

I tried it in a regular player, it would not play. I looked at the disc and it had a film covering more than 1/2 the disc, so I tried to clean it with a disc cleaner solvent. I tried to play it again on the regular player and it played but no sound. I removed it and placed it into the Blu-ray and it played ok. I looked at all the other discs----all 17-----and they all had a film on them ranging from 3/4 to 1/4. I refuse to accept something like this and try to clean everyone and then not have audio on a regular player, so I am sending the whole package back. I will try to buy from another seller. I really want to get Miss Temple's movies.",1372723200,11,983,3.9396984924623117
