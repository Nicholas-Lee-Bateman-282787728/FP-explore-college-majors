8040092,5,B00068403E,"I came across this series on Youtube, and was quickly attracted to the dramatic music that so well accompanies the story-line. Then I got addicted to the story itself. It's a kid's show, but far exceeds a lot of regular TV fare available to me here in the States (without cable, at least). I love the characters, but that might be because I'm part Scottish and was stationed there in the Navy. The memories come back and I get ""homesick"" every time I watch an episode. I re-commissioned an old DVD player and set it for region 2, and that's it - I'll be searching for every Scottish flick I can find from now on.",1490400000,,612,4.3304347826086955
