8062339,5,B0009K7RWU,"The biography screened in 4.3 follows the life and times of frontiersman 'David Crockett' from his writings of 1834 through
to very early 1836.
It tells of his childhood in Tennessee, through to him running away from home at the very young age of just 13, following
his writings to 1812 where after a Creek Indian attack upon a fort he joined with others to avenge his fellow Americans.
It follows his search for a new horizon with his bride, the loss of his love and need to find another to care for his children.
His flirtation with politics that saw him become a Congressman, his failure to be re-elected which persuaded him to journey
to Texas to have another shot at building up a fortune for his family.
However, he would never again return to them, he with a group of Tennesseans he'd hooked up with join 'Jim Bowie' and
'William Travis' in defence of The Alamo.
I think it fair to say that the 'Davy Crockett' legend was reignited by the Disney-Studio's in the mid 50's when 'Fess Parker'
took to the screen to become the 'Buckskin Pioneer'
It was certainly a time that triggered my life-long interest in the story, remember my mother making a 'Crockett' hat back then
which i wore with pride.
It had always been an ambition of mine to visit the Alamo, thought my chance had past me by, however in 2013 i did get to
visit the site as a part of a road-trip......
If you have interest in American history this biography is a must.
