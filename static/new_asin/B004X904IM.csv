8446527,1,B004X904IM,"I was cheated by the publisher/distributor of this DVD. It's because three out 5 episodes in this disc are repeated in another DVD with another title ""True Crime Series Vol. 3"".

They both contain THE SAME 3 stories. They are: Got Remarried, Got The Wrong 4 People Killed, and Got Dumped.

They were both published or distributed by the same company,  Discovery Communications, LLC.

This disc was released in 2011. ""T.C.S. vol. 3"" was released in 2012.
Both are priced at ALMOST the SAME PRICE.

They have different covers. So there's no way to tell they contain many of the same episodes by looking at their covers.

As you see, this disc is NOT WORTH BUYING because the two different episodes are good but they don't justify the price. You get more bang for your buck by purchasing ""True Crime Series Vol. 1, 2, and 3.""

The publisher/distributor played a trick by NOT REVEALING the CONTENTS of this disc on Amazon. They did reveal the contents of the other disc. That's why I did not know about this when ordering them from Amazon. Of course, I can't return it after viewing. What a waste of money! So, stay away from this and save your money.

I am wondering ""How could they get away with it?""

Below are the 2 stories that are NOT REPEATED in the other disc:
- Got Revenge is a story about Marshall Lee Brown, a murderer and a drug dealer.
- Got to sing Karaoke is a story about Joe Crouch, a wife killer and a bank robber.",1346716800,11,1429,4.423664122137405
