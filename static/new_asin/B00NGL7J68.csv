6649843,5,B00NGL7J68,"Thankfully, I am not one of those that feels every movie should be a candidate for the Academy Award.  I enjoy a movie that gives me an escape and Scout's Guide was wonderful Zombie fun.  The characters were likeable, the opening scene was nothing short of hilarious and the soundtrack was very good.  Halfway through the thing, I realized that I must own the DVD.",1449014400,5,364,4.569230769230769
6649844,1,B00NGL7J68,"Whats it about?

Three teenage scouts struggle with unpopularity, but when a zombie outbreak occurs they realize that their carefully-honed survival skills are just whats required.

What did I think?

This sexy horror comedy starts well. Twenty minutes of character creation and tense moments suddenly unravels as soon as the zombies turn up. A bag full of zombie jokes is plucked from every five minutes throughout the film and who cares whats been established so far.

This film doesnt just fail the Bechdel test, it then spends a week sending assault threats to it via Twitter. If I was a 14-year-old boy at a slumber party in the late eighties I probably would have loved it, but make no mistake, this film is bad. Bad enough to hate watch.",1448928000,6,744,4.744186046511628
6649845,4,B00NGL7J68,"When the zombie apocalypse happens, the police and military are of no use. Three scouts team up with a savvy stripper (Sarah Dumont) to save the secret senior party and Ben's (Tye Sheridan) crush (Halston Sage).

This was a fun nonsense zombie film. The viral outbreak also effect animals such as deer and kittens. The scene of them getting ready to do battle against the zombies happened way too late into the film. Could have used more Scorpions.

It started off with a little bit too much blood for my tastes and it was just a little bit crude or rude at times.

It definitely earned it's R rating.
Had I known that and paid more attention when I started it, I wouldn't have watched it.

With all of that said though, It was much more funny than I anticipated. I kept chuckling or laughing and kept on watching it.
It reminded me of some of the movies I watched during the 80's.

I finally watched this because the situation seemed odd enough to be fun. It lived up to that. However, the movie is more interesting than I first expected.

Only one of them is still enthusiastic about all things scouting and expects to receive his Condor Patch during a campout that doesnt exactly go as planned.  Zombies get in the way but instead of spoiling the fun, they become the fun.  These three, plus a cocktail waitress, are charged with the duty of rescuing party-revelers in a secret location.before a bomb is dropped on the town.  Fortunately, they know how to become armed and dangerous.

3/5 Acting
2/5 Story

So firstly, I'd like to say the zombie apocalypse ""hits"" about 20 minutes into the film during which much of the main cast (consisting of three high school boy scouts, and a drop dead gorgeous high school drop out chick who works at a strip club) is introduced. I think the film tries to bring the coming of age, high school teen running hormone theme to the zombie apocalypse stage but fails in that respect. The whole subplot on how the scouts are trying to ditch their geeky friend Augey's Condor badge ceremony to go to a party where all the cool kids are getting sum to the part where one of the scouts try to bootleg some liquor off a bum just seems so out of place. Moving on, most of the ideas are uninspired as yet again, the origin of the virus as explained in the beginning sequence has to do with a human subject infected with an unknown supervirus.

From what I gather, the rest of the plot has to do with the scouts and the hot chick in the tank top trying to track down the party where one of the scouts' sister and their classmates are at. Throw in a couple of zombie scenes where undead are going for the jugular, a few more hot chicks, killing zombies in every way possible including a can of aerosal and a lighter, we conclude the film with a massacre scene at the party where the scouts, armed with their Dead Rising inspired gadgets start killing off the zombies.

I never understood why the zombies acted the way they did, including the zombie scoutmaster who somehow found his way home, the zombie officer who was firing off his gun all over the place (Resident Evil?) and the zombie who parroted everything. I know the writers were trying to add to zombie lore, but it all comes off as awkward. I wonder if they really knew what they were doing when they were going in.

Overall, not a very satisfying zombie film, maybe worth a chuckle but did not help me create an attachment to the characters like Zombieland of Land of the Dead (remake) did. The effects were great though, especially when the hottie with the shotgun was blowing holes in zombie's chests and blowing their heads to smithereens.",1497744000,,2244,4.450121654501216

Adorable and hysterically funny-with an underlying ""boys becoming men theme."" VERY well acted with EXCELLENT
production values....and honestly, a surprising good film.
I loved and laughed my way through it, and an underlying joke in the movie involving their (former) and
now ""zombified"" Scout Leader is a hoot. (he's burnt, he's squished, he's gutted...but like the ""Energizer Bunny"" he keeps shuffling along-bad toupee and all)
And to think a ""zombie deer"" who decided to have him for lunch was the cause of his zombification. Damn critter sure knew how to spoil a great camping trip with his troops. :)
Every ""Zombie Apocalypse"" stereotype is delightfully incorporated-(""gotta go for the head!"")-and better still, unlike ""The Walking Dead,"" we
actually learn (and see) how ""Mr. Zombie"" and the ""Zombie Apocalypse"" came to be. I won't spoil the opening-except to say the scenes where the dufus cleaning kid who thinks he ""killed"" the zombie-but makes sure to stuff Tic-Tacs in his gory, rotted mouth before beginning CPR are a hoot
So please do yourself a favor and watch this very funny (and scary!) film on a day when you need a good laugh.

Speaking of low, its low budget and a little low brow too; a random zombie stripper with pole problems and the requisite hot-babe-in-tight-shirt. That said, I'm not pining away from wanting my viewing time back. Amazon Prime/Netflix Streaming seem to be a dumping ground for bad horror movies that you really wouldn't watch if you had to shell out the money at viewing time rather than up front. No exceptions here. But it was watchable and a good time-killer for an evening. If you want tame, formulaic, fright-free ""horror"" with a few laughs this is fine. Ahh Zombies is in the same humor > scares zombie vein and also a useful time-killer.

6650523,4,B00NGL7J68,"Far better than it has any right to, Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse blends the awkward teen comedy with the zombie survival horror successfully.

The opening is a bit slow, introducing us to the three male leads and their normal lives, but once they encounter their first zombies (and team up with Sarah Dumont's ""Denise"") the pace picks up and flows pretty well right to the end of the film. The action scenes range from normal to really clever, the teamwork dynamics are surprisingly plausible, and everything feels realistic.
There are a couple of uncomfortable-to-watch parts, but they aren't more than about 40 seconds of the film, so I'm willing to forgive them. (And if I'm lucky, one day I'll forget them.)

6650776,4,B00NGL7J68,"This movie reminded me a little of ""Zombieland"" and ""Superbad"".

The stars of the show are 3 16-year-old boys who have been friends since grade school who have also been Boy Scouts and one about to earn the next level and excited about it; the other two have wanted to quit for 2 years as they don't think it is cool and only continued as they felt sorry for their friend who had lost his dad 2 years prior.  They go to buy liquor and meet up with a girl that used to go to their high school but dropped out and it now working at an exotic dancing location (as a cocktail waitress, they find out later) and she becomes another key player in the movie.

Although there are zombies involved like ""Zombieland"", it is more a ""coming of age comedy"" with zombies thrown in the mix.

I don't recommend this movie those under 18 due to some nudity and some crudeness, but overall, a good movie and was much better than I expected before watching.",1477699200,2,938,4.2824858757062145

Two of the only three scouts left, head out for a camping trip while secretly planning to sneak away to a ""Senior Party"" with lots of free beer and experienced girls (including one o the scout's sister). The camp out is hijacked by a zombie deer, the newly zombified scout leader, and the ""cocktail waitress"" at the local strip club who has somehow managed to be avoid being turned into a zombie like the pole dancers and the bartender. Lots of screaming, running from the hunger-fueled zombies and some tasteless (but funny) bits about one girl who become a zombie after oral sex and an extended zombies-on-a-trampoline scene involving an old dude's very stretchy penis.

Geared toward the male population (sorry ladies it's true) probably not wife or girlfriend friendly.

If you have kids that are younger, be warned there is a certain appendage being thrown around toward the very end of the movie.

There is a scene (One of quite a few actually) that cleverly has a trio of people that are about to be attacked by a Zombie, notice that the zombie was imitating sounds one of the would be victims were making. Before you realize it, they see the Zombie is wearing a Brittney Spears shirt and one by one join in and get the Zombie singing hit me baby, one more time....which ends abruptly when an army guy that was watching this fires a bullet from behind them, ending the quartet.

The movie has some great vision and comedy considering the lower budget.

6651973,5,B00NGL7J68,"This is the craziest zombie comedy I've ever seen but it worked all the way for me. I have to warn people that this goes way over into gross-out and teen -sex comedy territory and has so many words, situations and visuals that will offend many people, especially the straight-laced, that you should really take a look at the preview and perhaps a few of the scene clips online before deciding to see it. The fact that it has Boy Scouts in the title does not mean it is for children though it's mostly young people who will like it. This is a film where the Scouts form an alliance with a stripper to save a town from zombies. It has the potential to become a rel cult classic on DVD and streaming even though its theatrical life was practically nothing (the word is, due to lack of promotion).

As in most horror-comedies and all zombie movies it helps not to think too hard about the plot and the situations that develop in the film. I don't think everyone would be so adept on a trampoline. I don't think the Scouts' improvised weapons would really work so well against the zombies. There's lots of stuff like that. My advice is to just sit back and enjoy the fun and the increasing mayhem.

The film gets many things right. Except for one scene that involves a Brittney Spears song, the zombies are not treated comically but are maintained as a real threat. You have to keep the horror real at the same time you're laying on the comedy. For all its silliness it's well-acted, especially by Tye Sheridan as Ben, the main scout and sober center of the film.  He exudes the right blend of innocence and intelligence. Sarah Dumont is just right as the stripper. Cloris Leachman is hilarious as the grumpy cat lady next door.

This film really gets going and doesn't stop. Don't miss it as long as you can take its ""Adult"" humor.",1475020800,13,1827,4.428571428571429

I honestly didn't think the film was going to end up being as enjoyable as it was but I was glad to have been wrong. From the opening scene I knew this was going to be a wild, crazy & funny ride. The whole cast I feel did a really great job here. Basic plot is a zombie outbreak happens in a small town & its up to a group of teenage scouts to save the day. Along the way they get into some very funny situations, one in particular involving a trampoline had me laughing hard. Its a shame this movie went so under the radar when it released as it really was well done, when it ended I found myself wanting more. Also, quick tip, stay until after the first set of credits (the one that play showing pictures) since there is another scene after that. Extras included: Scouts guide to filmmaking, zombie FX makeup handbook, undead movements guidelines: zombie choreography, deleted scenes & costume designs. Fans of horror films, comedy films & horror/comedies will all find something to enjoy here so don't miss it.",1474761600,,1159,4.37037037037037

6652989,5,B00NGL7J68,"I thoroughly enjoyed this! As a zombie genre fan I wasn't expecting much from a comedy zombie movie, but it definitely over delivered.

The script is funny. The story is good enough for what it is. The zombies are well done. It's just an entertaining movie.

If you are a super Walking Dead fan and prefer your zombie films to adhere to widely accepted norms, you might have a problem with this movie. The zombies seem to have recollection of their human lives. They aren't just mindless drones. They can open doors and shoot guns and climb ladders. They are still zombies, but they are a little more capable than your average Walking Dead zombie. If you take the zombie genre seriously, you might have a problem with that. If you have a sense of humor about the fictional ability of zombies in a comedy movie, you should enjoy this.

If I was ranking comedy zombie movies I'd put this a half step behind Zombieland and Shaun Of The Dead. Those two were great. Scouts Guide To The Zombie Apocalypse is almost as good, but not quite. Zombieland had better effects and a better story. Shaun of the Dead was funnier. But Scouts Guide is worthy of being discussed in the same conversation.

It does the typical horror movie thing a lot where it has someone jump into scene quickly to scare the audience, or it builds suspense so you're scared, then nothing happens so you have a false sense of security. But it's in no way a horror movie. It's too funny for horror. It's not scary at all. So I think it could have dealt without those 'scare shots'. That was bringing the film down a tiny bit. Aside from that it's very well done.

I enjoyed this from beginning to end. If you are a prude, skip it. The ""hanging from the old zombie's junk"" scene will do you in. For me though I had to pause it so I could get through laughing without missing more of the movie.",1474243200,12,1855,4.396501457725948

Parents, do not buy or rent this for anyone under 17, even older if highly impressionable! I was hoping for Zombieland and got Porkies meets I Spit on Your Grave. Extremely graphic content including male genitalia in a scene that is over the top grotesque. The humor is on the level of a 12-year-old but the violence, profanity, and sexual content is inappropriate for even the most mature audiences. How this got an R rating is beyond me, this would have been NC17 a decade ago. If you are someone of faith you will surely be offended by the repeated taking of the Lord's name in vain and the scene in which one of the scouts tells the cocktail waitress that his parents were at a spiritual event to which she gasps and replies how she would rather be there with the zombies.

Be careful, your eyes may roll into the back of your head and you may be hoarse for stating, ""Really?"" so often before the end of this.

Why are there no people of color in this movie? Why are they still using late 20-30 year olds to play teenagers? Very hard to watch and believe. The white, well paid people who make these films are stuck in a feedback loop that doesn't allow any diversity in cast or story. They are a just money making exercises to boost their profits. Sometimes these types of stupid films can be fun, this one is not.

Somewhat disappointed with this film. Has a couple cute zombie moments, but other than having to sit through characters making dumb choices, not worth it.  Tired of watching characters who seem to have never seen a zombie movie.  Dumb characters in a poorly written movie.

6654190,5,B00NGL7J68,"Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse is probably an indication that we really need a break with zombie movies, because while it definitely gives us the humorous take on a zombie outbreak instead of the horror (remember I'm the guy who likes BOTH comedy and scary zombie movies but I place them in two separate categories) a lot of this stuff is probably too silly even for my standards (and I have pretty low standards!)  If you're wondering why I place zombie movies in comedy and horror categories, it's because for one thing there's a LOT of zombie movies out there now so we need a way to organize them all, and also because both genres (comedy and horror) have now established themselves.

This movie's about a group of boy scouts who've now reached their teenage years and want out.  Well at least two of them want out (Tye Sheridan and Logan Miller) but their other friend- Joey Morgan's character- he wants to keep the tradition alive, and acts like being a boy scout is a permanent thing.  The movie does a pretty good job providing an exaggerated corny sense that being in boy scouts forever is a great feeling of pride and that these boys should be committed to it for their entire lives, however pretty soon when walking a trail out in the wilderness, the leader (David Koechner's character) gets attacked by a deer then later a zombie!  I was trying to eat a peanut butter and jelly sandwich while watching this scene, so I didn't appreciate the deer guts hanging out, or the knife through the eye.  I almost gagged on the strawberry jelly!

Anyway since Tye and Logan are growing out of their boy scout ways, they find themselves hooking up with a cocktail waitress (Sarah Dumont's character) and well, let's just say she's *really* hot.  If you don't think she's hot you might wanna rub your eyes again!  The way she runs around in those shorts... anyway!  She works at a strip club and the bouncer doesn't like these boys very much.  At first I thought he was going to run after the two boys after communicating with Sarah!  You can tell she's the main attraction at this place and is probably protected.  Before this it's sort of hilarious how Sarah was able to walk into a liquor store and buy beer for these underage boys without the cashier guy or anyone else confronting her.  Then again who'd dare confront someone so attractive!

From here the zombie outbreak only gets worse.  Turns out these zombies are fast!  Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse doesn't seem to do anything that hasn't already been done in other humorous zombie films, but it probably kicks up the outrageousness a few notches higher.  The funniest scene is when Tye, Logan Joey and Sarah have to jump out an upper bedroom window and land on a trampoline which would give them enough height/momentum to bounce to their neighbors yard with a high fence providing protection, but due to a bad jump Tye accidentally grabs onto and extends an old man's zombies weiner while hanging from the window, LOL!  Then again I can't remember if this was Joey's character.

Anyway these zombies are not only fast, they can apparently dance to Britney Spears!  They just need some encouragement and to see some fancy dance moves first.  Probably the silliest moment in the movie granted.  I love the scene when Joey's using the bathroom after a bad marshmallow experience, and has to open up a window to release the smell.  A zombie walking around outside almost swipes at Joey's head!  Good thing Joey stood up in time.  Also the following scene when Joey gets into an altercation with his scout leader because he turned into a zombie and Joey doesn't realize it right away... solid action there!

Perhaps Tye, Logan and Sarah stuck inside a jail cell surrounded by zombies, and the zombies arms *just* out of their reach is another classic moment.  Sarah and Logan's character don't really get along because Sarah thinks Logan's not being a man about the situation, and Tye is the one who has a crush on Sarah.  Can't blame Tye there can we now!  Love when Joey tries to walk past several zombies outside the police station and sets off a car alarm!  The chase is on for you Joey!  Despite all the craziness, there's a nice sense that these three boys are friends and friendship conquers all.  This means the ending is great.

Overall the acting is solid, the zombies are hilarious and entertaining, there's several memorable lines and scenes and... oh yeah!  How about the zombie cat?  Haha!  And when we find out the cat lady has several more cats hiding in the shadows, and they ALL turn into zombies?  This is actually sort of a frightening moment because we only see the eyes of the growling cats in the background.  Good stuff!  Highly recommended but I think the time has come that we need a really long break with zombie films.  This is enough!",1468627200,,4835,4.63454759106933

6654206,4,B00NGL7J68,"Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse  Paramount Pictures  2015  Rated R  DVD version

Paramount does indie?  Almost.  The jacket to this odd duckling cheerfully asserts Quality Guaranteed, pointedly without specifying what kind.  The cast, apart from Tye Sheridan, seems mainly to be known for having appeared in: ""Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse"".  Director Landon who?  Yeah well, he seems to have done more writing and producing, but he also apparently directed Paranormal Activity 2 and 3, and Disturbia which actually sounds interesting too and I haven't seen it.

The estimated budget for this thing is $15,000,000.  Its first weekend, it drew a pathetic $180,000 and at last count it had only recouped about $3.6 million.  Fortunately there are usually significant later revenues internationally, pay-per-view, TV etc.  Its rating on IMDB is a fairly respectable 6.9 out of 10.

Ignoring the zombie part, the narrative thrust is really about gaining dignity as an un-cool kid.  Lets face it, in todays world boy scouts are not especially recognized as the coolest boys in high school.  The self-redemption of 3 such scouts in the face of theyeszombie apocalypse makes this films most likely audience junior high or high school moviegoers, followed by college age, and a thinner smattering of adults like myself.  They definitely lay on the un-cool factor here, a little reminiscent of Revenge of the Nerds.

Most of the acting is average at best, but the romantic-interest girl in the story, Sarah Dumont playing Denise Russo, is actually pretty good.  This is almost her debut in a Hollywood movie [actually her second film] and she was already able to follow it up with a role in Playing It Cool the following year.  She also appeared in a Maxim magazine hottest 100 list in 2014, scoring 60th.  So she may be part of an upcoming generation of actresses.  Another female romantic interest, Kendall Grant, is played by Halston Sage, another budding young actress starting to accumulate film roles.  Her character is actually the sister of one of the scouts and the object of daydreams of a buddy.

There is no attempt to explain just why or how a zombie apocalypse has afflicted this small town but it spreads rapidly.  Scenes later in the film seem to suggest it is a local outbreak, not anything nationwide at that point in time.  This leads to the usual threat that the government may sterilize the area, including any surviving normal humans who cant escape soon enough.

The film embraces high-ketchup, gross-undead, and unrealistic campy action, probably with the theory that this will amuse a youthful audience.  And it is probably right.  It seems unpolished, unpretentious, enthusiastic and impulsivejust like teenagers.  With so many depressing adult movies nowadays, its nice [at least for me it is] to see something that is not really aiming to scare, nor to depress, nor to preach to you, but just to have a few laughs.  Perhaps it was poorly advertised.  I hope that in time this manages to turn some profit.",1467676800,3,3037,4.98605577689243

6654294,5,B00NGL7J68,"This movie is rambunctiously scored from start to finish.  All horror comedies should be so bold as to have Blake Anderson (Workaholics) twerking down the halls to Iggy Azalea's Black Widow while mopping the floors.  Too bad he dies right away, but the scene is long, hilarious and REALLY gory.  What more could you want?  Follow that up with stock footage of David Koechner (Final Destination 5, Krampus) as an awkward scout leader in a recruiting video and I think director Christopher Landon (writer for Paranormal Activity 2-5) is off to a great start!

We don't get very far in this movie before the gore properly reveals itself.  It's a sloppy mess of awesome and this infectious bloody zombiism permeates the animal kingdom to deliver a zombie deer with its guts hanging out.

This flick really delivers and doesn't stop with the gore.  The hormonally raging Ben (Tye Sheridan), straight-laced Carter (Logan Miller) and boy scout fanatic Auggie (Joey Morgan; Compadres) are three readily likable high school sophomores with a newfound American Pie-like discovery of women.  Their love interests: stripper Denise (Sarah Dumont; Don Jon) and classmate Kendall (Halston Sage; Goosebumps).  As if copying from Superbad's (2007) class notes, Ben has charged Carter with scoring some beer and getting them to the party that will ""change their lives.""

After such an amazing opening act, the movie had to lose a little steam ever so briefly in the middle before returning full steam ahead into lunacy.  Even at its slowest point it's a nice experience.  As it comes back full-tilt some people might be a bit bothered by the level of physicality of these zombies (i.e., WWE wrestling moves, jumping on trampolines).  But it's a solidly fun and adventurous horror comedy.

These boys' misadventures lead them to zombie strippers, challenges of their friendship, zombie boobs, a Britney Spears sing-along, a crazy old cat lady zombie, the crazy old cat lady zombie's crazy cat zombies, elderly zombie penis stretching and dismemberment, and zombie oral sex.  As dirty and perverted as this all sounds it could have been much raunchier and grosser. Trust me, it's probably nothing that will make you uncomfortable if you enjoyed Piranha 3DD (2012).

In this gory coming-of-age zombedy, these three boys rediscover their friendship and renew the awesome resourcefulness that is being a scout...and using those skills for killing zombies! It's a great ride!",1462924800,17,2451,5.148989898989899

6654356,5,B00NGL7J68,"Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse is simply a fun film.  If you liked Shaun of the Dead and can watch a film that isn't trying to be a documentary of what life would be like if Zombies actually did exist, then you'll enjoy this one.  Like with Shaun, you've got a range of characters who upon their initial encounter with a zombie are unaware a zombie outbreak has occurred, and that the person acting weird or hostile is a zombie.  The main characters in this one are two kids about to enter become juniors in high school who are aware that being a scout isn't going to help them be cool or get anywhere with girls.  However they have been friends with a passionate scout kid whose father died and they know leaving scouts will crush him mentally.  The two boys are invited to the cool kids' party but it corresponds to the night their friend is earning his Condor badge when the scout group is supposed to be camping in the woods.  They plan to sneak out when he and the scoutmaster are asleep and return before they wake up.  Unfortunately the scoutmaster runs into a zombie on route to camp and oddly no one seems to be around in town, including the bouncer guarding the door to the town's strip club when the boys sneak out of camp.  They aren't going to find the scene inside the club they expect, but will team up with a cocktail waitress in order to rescue one of their sister's who is at the party and impress their fellow school students.

This is a fun film with zombies on a trampoline, zombie cats, a lot of awkward situations, and a scout master zombie with a bad toupee who just won't die David Koechner (Anchorman) .  The main characters are played by up and coming young actors some who haven't been in much and others who have been in a few other films such as Paper Planes,  Mud, Joe, Goosebumps, The First Time and other movies you may not have seen before, but they all do a pretty decent job.  Granted Hollywood movie style they all look a lot older than the high school juniors they are playing.  Fans of Malcolm in the Middle will enjoy seeing Lois' mum (Cloris Leachman) return to the screen as a similar angry old lady character who this time is a cat lady.  You'll also probably recognise Blake Anderson from Workaholics and other films as the janitor who unleashes the zombie virus when knocks over some life support equipment and tries to not get in trouble by performing CPR on a man he doesn't know is a zombie.

Even though this movie more leans towards telling a sight gag than being realistic, I did like how the zombies moved at the same speed they would have when alive, which is certainly more plausible than the dragging on leg, shuffle that most zombie films go with.  From the DVD extras it looks like everyone from the main cast to the extras had a great deal of fun making this movie too.",1458950400,,2834,4.379770992366412

6654436,3,B00NGL7J68,"3.5 Stars from me to be exact.

Parts of this movie were really good. But for the most part I was bored and waiting for something to go on. I felt like the film spent way too long on character development in the beginning versus having anything  really go on. It gave me more of a pg-13 vibe than a movie with an R rating. Actually I am surprised it has an R rating lol.

This movie is worth a watch, but I'd probably wait for it to stream freely on one of the many websites or pirate it, personally. But if you're a fan of zombie films this is should be on your list. You can tell they put a lot of work in it.",1456444800,,611,3.8333333333333335
6654437,5,B00NGL7J68,"I never got on the zombie train, no Walking Dead for me. Although I do watch iZombie, because I loved Veronica Mars, and its from the same producers. But when I saw the trailer for this movie, I instantly wanted to watch it.

I really enjoy Horror/Comedy, especially if its done well, like this one. Besides having great one liners, and lots of gore and splatter, this movie actually has a storyline, that made me root for the characters. Ben and Carter have been in Scouts with Augie forever. Augie still loves it, and will be getting a big award, but Ben and Carter want to stop going to Scouts and move onto something more grown-up. Ben wants to spare Augies feelings, and keeps putting off telling him. But when the Zombie Apocalypse begins, all kinds of secrets come out. including the intense love that their Scout master has for Dolly Parton.

The situations that the main characters get into with the zombies, as well as how they get away from them are amusing. There are a lot of boobs, but if you combine teenagers and horror, you have to have them. If you enjoyed Cooties or Tucker and Dale vs. Evil, then there is an excellent chance youll like this one too.",1456444800,,1170,4.488262910798122

They soon realize that their town is being invaded by zombies and they must team up with a badass cocktail waitress to take down these zombies and save their town with the help of their skills as scouts. The movie was a surprise for me because I read a lot of mixed reviews for it where some people liked it and others didn't. Like a lot of comedic zombie films, it has its moments of humor and brutal zombie kills. The main characters are likable and I like how you learn more about them as the movie progresses. Is it a perfect movie? No, it has it's flaws. I didn't like how some of the zombie effects were done using CGI and it doesn't look the best. Most of the time, the zombie effects were done practically. Another thing is that some of the jokes used in the film were not that funny.

My husband and I rented this one thinking ""Meh, the reviews weren't so great but let's give it a shot."" So I guess I don't understand -- were we all watching the same flick?? I dunno, I feel like reviewers calling it ""sophomoric"" and ""ribald"" and ""frenzied"" are flat-out missing the point: that's exactly what it's going for, because it's turning every single decency-duty-and-honor scout cliche right on its head. Even my husband, an Eagle Scout and a corporate exec (i.e., not a teenage boy), thought practically every scene was a riot.

I've been a horror fan for years, and thought I'd seen everything the (beyond overplayed) ""zombie apocalypse"" genre had to offer. This movie is insanely fearless in its attempts to cook up the most screwball, gross-out, no-flipping-way, left-of-center scenarios imaginable -- and it has an absolute, unabashed ball serving them up. Plus, buried under all that mayhem is a sweet heart to boot. As a general point of reference, I loved ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Zombieland.""

6654707,4,B00NGL7J68,"Was this movie great? Not quite. Was it entertaining? Absolutely. Was it a complete experience? Ehh... Maybe not. It certainly had its moments and it certainly lacked creativity in places. That being said. I miss movies like this so much! Praise the lord that at least somebody out there is still making movies to just have some fun and entertain us. Being a movie fan, I've become jaded with the movie business in recent years. You can categorize all movies in this fashion these days:

1. Summer blockbuster
2. Intended to win an Oscar movie
3. ""my buddies and I picked up a camera off ebay and we're going to make a movie. I wrote this script yesterday.""
4. ""Who cares what we're filming, if we move the camera back and forth, it becomes art.""
5. C to D grade horror
6. Political stance movies

Sure, there are movies out there that are fun and entertaining, but there aren't enough of them. Therefore, my review may be a little more glowing than it should be but I'm starving for stuff like this; and I'm sick and tired of zombie movies. The thing that makes this movie quality is its fantasy meets reality feel. The situation is complete fantasy but the characters are grounded in reality. The characters are humorous and personable and the audience feels like they are along for the ride, instead of what is the norm these days in most movies; disjointed, uncaring and unwelcome.

""Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse"" will be a catalyst for these actors. This movie reminds me of great movies from the 80s where kids are thrown into extraordinary situations like ""The Goonies"", ""Monster Squad"", ""Gremlins"" and ""Adventures in Babysitting""; except with zombies. This gives me hope that there are still people out there who care to make fun movies that don't fit the 6-yawner categories that I listed above.",1453334400,,1813,4.712933753943218

Eventually they raid a hardware store and use their scout training to make weapons and fight off the zombies as their classmates flee for their lives.  They do end up saving the day and the main scout gets the girl he has been wanting for the whole movie.

This is not to say that there isn't a great movie ""somewhere here"" but I feel that the current movie could have been slightly truncated and ""more movie"" added so that we could feel that we were given a decent story arc.

I liked the characters but wanted more. With the production and the decent job of the actors one would have expected a better movie. But somehow it isn't here. In many ways this is a Sean of the Dead ""wannabe"". Which isn't a bad thing but unlike Sean of the dead which really invites one into the characters, this one doesn't seem to go far enough. Is this a bad movie for a late Saturday night before you drift off to sleep? Nope, you might have some fun with it. Would I recommend it if you were inviting friends over for a movie evening? no.

The Amazon rating indicates 3 stars as ""it's ok"" and two stars as ""I don't like it"". 3 Stars looks far more positive than ""it's ok. In truth this is really a 2.5 star movie to my tastes. I enjoyed it enough for a late Saturday night viewing but it's not fun enough that I would ever see it again or recommend. Still, I do think the actors were likable and did a decent job.

Outbreak/Apocalypse Phase: Initial outbreak (characters experience the outbreak as it happens)
Sub-Genre: Horror/Comedy

Having never heard of this, I went into the film expecting little more than the typical D-level trash found on most streaming sites.  You know what I mean; the hundreds of zombie movies that appear to have been filmed by bored high school kids during summer vacation.  The experience was thankfully more akin to Zombieland.

Combining witty (frequently over-the-top) humor, clever sight gags, inventive zombie death and dismemberment scenes and the best use of a trampoline ever, Scout's Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse is not only similar in tone to the 2009 horror comedy hit (Zombieland) but is easily the best and most fun zombie romp since Woody Harrelson's epic quest for Twinkies.

Stick to Shaun Of The Dead and Dead Alive and all those other fun to watch zombie comedy films. Cant recommend this one, wish I could get my $4.99 back. I will give them credit for the zombie cats that was different. Too bad it couldn't save this disaster. 1/5

Id recommend Cub instead. Very well done cub scouts themed horror movie.",1450224000,,773,4.0855263157894735

6654830,1,B00NGL7J68,"Sucks.  Maybe 3rd graders will not notice the way the film tortures the viewer with every manner of not-of-this-earth behaviors.  Every single character had not a titch of common sense.  And I watched the trailer, so I should have known....it's an honest trailer to some degree, but the unrelentingness of the brain grinding stupidity just finally got to me in a way the trailer doesn't reveal about the film.  I seldom write reviews, but when they're this bad, it's my civic duty to warn others.  One star because of production values and the brave  efforts of the actors; otherwise, zero stars.......My best bet is that the writer/director is solely responsible for the mess -- the story, the lines, the humor, the stunts -- and on and on it just kept the suckage at red-line.....all his final responsibility.

6654846,5,B00NGL7J68,"Very nearly a perfect zomedy.  Certainly in the Top 5.  Pay no attention to the detractors, this thing is a scream.  It's sort of the ""before"" to Zombieland's ""after.""  Same satire, same pop references, same kitsch.  Several solid candidates for ""Zombie Kill of the Week.""  The phrase is overused, but it really is an instant classic.  Latte came out my nose during the trampoline scene.  (That might be a spoiler for some of you...)  Great FX, low-brow humor, strippers/cocktail waitresses (you'll understand), guns and zombies - what's not to love?  And lest I forget: Cloris Leachman RULZ!!!",1449792000,2,594,5.030927835051546

6654852,5,B00NGL7J68,"Hahahahahaha. It just ended (I just watched it). I'm sorry, but any of you people that didn't ""get"" this movie and sense of humor, I feel terrible for your loss. This was bloody (literally) genius. No I'm not 12, I'm 41. I love film and am fairly critical of it. It's actually pretty hard to make me laugh. I know when my mind is being abused. Like when movies over-attempt make you want to cry from happiness and (throw up at the same time.)
This movie, on the other hand abused my mind in exactly the right way.
As a lover of Evil Dead 2, and most John Hughes movies, I was not disappointed in the least. On the contrary, this film was a unique combination of Gore to the level of humor (with a touch of uber-perversion), melodramatic badmouthed high-school archetypes, and absurdity that kept surprising me (and make me laugh while peeking through my hand covering my eyes).",1449619200,107,877,4.4875

If your objective is to kick-back, relax and just be entertained... This is the film for you. Plenty of comedy, plenty of sex appeal, plenty of zombies... A movie you can be sure to call a hidden gem to your friends. I can't wait to pick-up my copy the day it's released.",1449100800,4,545,4.25
