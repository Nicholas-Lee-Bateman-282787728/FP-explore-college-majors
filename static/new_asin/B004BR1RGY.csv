A lone rider approaches a small town. He whistles to a woman in a house. Her father hates Tom, who has been working steadily breaking horses at $5 a head. But he gambled it all away! Tom scoots out the window as Peggy Blands dad arrives with bad news - he may lose the ranch. The banker Morley is interested in his daughter. Tom gives up gambling for good and throws away his dice. The bank was robbed! Toms presence makes him appear to be one of the robbers, who ride away as people shoot at them. Tom was recognized, there is a $1,000 reward posted for Tom Talbot. A man sees him and telephones ahead. There is a chase with shooting, but Tom eludes them. He visits Peggy at night to tell her the truth. Her father captures him and turns him over to the Sheriff. Peggy sends a lawyer to Tom, but Tom wants to plead guilty.

Tom is sentenced to five years on the road gang so his health won't be damaged by confinement. Peggy will take care of Toms horse. When riding Peggy finds an abandoned satchel and bandanna. A lone horseman rides after her. The satchel has packages in it. One prisoner runs away, a rifle shot stops him. Other attack Shorty, the water boy. Later Shorty tells Tom that Ed Larkin was hired to rob the bank to cover up a shortage in Morleys bank! Peggy visits Tom and shares information. Some prisoners attack a guard and force Tom to drive them away. Another guard pursues them and shoots at them! Tom jumps off as they cross a bridge, the guard catches the others. The Sheriff tells Peggy and her Dad about the four outlaws who stole $50,000 in bonds, and that Tom Talbot broke jail.

Why bonds? They would need a banker to dispose of them for cash. Peggy goes for a ride and finds a small cabin. A man lies wounded inside. Elsewhere a lone man is chased by four men who shoot at him. Ed Larking confessed to Peggy. Jim Morley arrives with the robbers and stops Peggy. What will they do with her? Tom rides to that cabin. He fights and knocks down two of the robbers. Then he fights with Morley as Peggy watches. [How many bullets in a revolver?] The Sheriff and his men arrive at the cabin. Peggy tells the Sheriff the facts. Tom should get a pardon and some of the reward money for the robbers. Now Tom and Peggy can get a spread of their own.

This has a pretty good story. Staging a bank robbery is a classic trick to hide shortages and malfeasance. Was the movie edited to fit into an hours running time? Is there a Laramie in Texas?",1506211200,,2489,4.266949152542373
