8727931,4,B013IKTSRE,"Real estate magnate, Goddard Bolt, makes a bet with a fellow millionaire regarding a blighted urban area inhabited by the homeless. Void of all resources, if Bolt can live among the homeless for a month, he can develop the area; if not, the other millionaire gets the prime real estate. This is a typical Mel Brooks film with sight gags and off-beat humor. There are a lot of funny moments and a decent plot. Lesley Ann Warren stands out as a homeless bag lady. Light and breezy comedy worth watching.",1509667200,,501,4.5777777777777775
