8289200,5,B001CTH73Q,"This was an enjoyable show, especially since it was filmed in San Diego county where I live. My son, Davey, was an extra in one of the episodes, and he appeared fully in two different scenes. Davey died recently at the age of 25 from a long illness, so it is very important to me to obtain a copy of the show. Please let me know when it is available or where I can order a copy.",1362441600,,378,3.9220779220779223
8289201,5,B001CTH73Q,"I've been waiting for nearly four years for the entire season to be released.  I can't imagine that the small investment in production cost would prevent the network from at least *trying* to release it.  Maybe they could throw it up on NetFlix streaming, if they do not wish to invest in DVD pressings.  Streaming it seems like it would be so easy and cheap.  :(",1330387200,,363,4.454545454545454
8289202,5,B001CTH73Q,I watched this show every week and then one day an NCIS rerun came on and thats how i found out the show i loved had been cancelled. now i cant find it on dvd or anything to see how it ends! PLEASE get this on DVD so i can buy it!!,1311120000,,231,3.4615384615384617
8289203,5,B001CTH73Q,"i loved this show! the network only aired a couple of episodes out of the entire season, and then replaced it w/ *BORINGASS ncis reruns. anyway, i had to come to amazon and buy it on-demand to watch. now i think that option isn't even available. i'm so sorry that i can't buy this on dvd- anyone who loved 'sex and the city' would love this light-hearted and fun comedy about finding love thru kissing lots of frogs. COME ON, RELEASE IT ON DVD ALREADY so i can buy a copy for all my friends!!!!!!!!",1285113600,5,498,4.252631578947368
8289204,5,B001CTH73Q,"My husband and I loved CBS's ""The Ex List""...networks are so worried about ratings that if something is not a big hit right away they ""ax"" the show w/out giving it a chance.  ""Cheers"" bombed their first season - imagine the tv world if they did not give it a chance for a second season!",1260662400,8,286,4.2
8289205,5,B001CTH73Q,"I thought this was a great ligjthearted funny show! I hate it when the networks don't even give a decent chance! I mean four shows & it's the real dating game..... After four dates, it disappears! So at least release the rest of the season on iTunes or make it available on DVD so us fans can have some satisfaction of seeing how the season ends at least! It's almost like you need therapy for Tv......, you have no closure! Please put this out!",1247702400,12,445,4.309523809523809
