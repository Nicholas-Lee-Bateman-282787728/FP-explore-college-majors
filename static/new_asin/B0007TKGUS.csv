8051264,5,B0007TKGUS,"A great old serial.  One of Lon Chaney Jr's best performances.  We started out to watch just a few episodes instead we watched all of them in one night.  I would highly recommend this for a true Lon Chaney, Jr. fan.",1451174400,,215,4.195121951219512

8051267,5,B0007TKGUS,"fIRST OF ALL I AM A LOVER OF THE EARLY SERIALS, THERE IS A LOT OF ACTION, AND SUPRISINGLY SOME HISTORICAL FACTS ADDED TO THE MOVIE.  THE ADDITION OF ""BILL CODY"" WHO REALLY WAS AT ONE TIME A PONY EXPRESS RIDER.  THE ACTING WAS VERY GOOD, IT WAS GREAT TO SEE LON CHANEY JR., NOT PLAYING THE HEAVY BUT THE HERO. I ALWAYS ENJOY WATCHING ""NOAH BERRY JR"" AND SENIOR PLAY TOGETHER.  WHILE SOME OF THE CLIFFHANGER SCENES WERE A LITTLE HARD TO BELIEVE.  IT WAS STILL A VERY GOOD SERIAL, WITH GREAT ACTORS, WITH A BELIEVEABLE STORY LINE. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.",1284422400,,556,4.3173076923076925
8051268,2,B0007TKGUS,"OK, I only watched 4 of the 15 chapters, so this review is probably not the final answer.  You will like this serial if you enjoy watching indians attack white people in wagons.  Endless scenes of indians chasing wagons, horses running and guns shooting. Wagons crashing and burning, over and over and over.  Sorry, but I had to turn it off.  Here we have the standard story line of white men posing as indians, making the indians look bad. I really wanted to like this serial, but the truth prevailed--not all serials are good (or worth watching).",1146355200,5,548,4.618556701030927
8051269,3,B0007TKGUS,"Lon Chaney, Jr. appeared as a minor character in several serials, but he turns up here as the lead in a Western serial.  He's as good an actor as most serial leading men, but somehow he doesn't quite fit the part.  Although he rides well and has a nice horse (that looks like Trigger), romantic he's not.  He's best known, of course, for his classic ""The Wolf Man""--in fact, he's the only person ever to have played all four classic movie monsters--the Wolf Man, Frankenstein's Monster, Dracula, and the Mummy.  I give him an A for effort here, but the movie would have been better served with a more traditional leading man.

Ford Beebe was Universal's best serial director, and he did a lot of them.  He was a real workhorse, directing in every film genre.  He even supervised live-action sequences in Disney's ""Fantasia"" (1940).  Most of the good Universal serials were directed by Beebe.

One interesting thing he did in this one is pairing the Beerys, Sr. and Jr., as characters on opposite sides of the law.  Noah Jr. plays the hero's sidekick, Sierra Pete, while his dad plays the dirty rotten scoundrel who's trying to wreck the Overland Mail service.  Noah Beery, Sr. made a wonderful heavy, my favorite in serials (see ""Zorro Rides Again,"" ""Red Ryder"").  They first appear in the same scene in Chapter 4, and not too frequently thereafter, though at one point the father (real-life, that is) tries to get the son hanged by the mob.  (That must have caused some guffaws on the set.)  Noah Jr. was also a serial staple (""Ace Drummond,"" ""Three Musketeers,"" ""Riders of Death Valley"").

Helen Parrish plays the love interest, and though I had never heard of her she does an excellent job.  Apparently she had a strong career in the early 1940's, but retired in 1942 when she married.  She died of cancer in 1959 at the age of 34.

BIG CHEAT:  In Chapter Five Jim Lane and Sierra Pete are trapped on a flimsy suspension bridge which very clearly spans a rock-filled canyon.  The phony Indians hurl gigantic rocks down at them, breaking the bridge and hurling the heroes down--into a rushing river!  Who turned the rocks into water, I'll never know.

This is a rather typical Western, filled with lots of action.  For all that action,however, it's not a very exciting serial.  It's too long, the cliffhangers are not very inspired, and frankly the whole movie is rather forgettable.",1137542400,9,2385,4.705314009661835
8051270,5,B0007TKGUS,"VCI Entertainment and Universal Pictures present...""The Overland Mail"" (1942) (Dolby digitally remastered), a 13 Chapter cliffhanger from an action packed Universal serial era featuring an outstanding cast with Ford Beebe and John Rawlins at the helm....our story begins as Jim Lane (Lon Chaney Jr) and his sidekick pal Sierra Pete (Noah Beery Jr) are sent to La Paz to investigate repeated attacks on ""The Overland Mail"" owned and operated by Tom Gilbert (Tom Chatterton), their friend ""Buckskin"" Bill Burke (Don Terry) (who we all know as Don Winslow of the Navy) aids them by hiring out as an Overland stage driver, Gilbert and his daughter Barbara Gilbert (Helen Parrish), start for silver Creek in a stage driven by ""Buckskin"":...Lane and Sierra learn a time bomb has been planted on the stage and riding furiously to overtake it....can two investigators for a stagecoach company who are assigned to find out why the company's stages keep being ambushed and discover the culprits all within these 15 chapters...could they be white men disguised as Indians...will Lane, Sierra and Buckskin figure out in the last episode, who is hero and villain in this great cast Universal Cliffhanger's... who is behind all of this plotting besides the Universal Writers Guild, how about Frank Chadwick (Noah Beery Sr) and Puma (Charles Stevens) who always seem to be up to no good in every Hollywood serial during the '30s and '40s...well don't leave the theater until the final chapter is over and done with ""The Mail Goes Through""....just remember double thrills, chills, mystery and suspense...hitting the bull's eye with excitement...don't miss a single spine thrilling episode..return next week to this local theater for another episode of action and adventure that will keep you thrilled until the next chapter.

Under director's Ford Beebe and John Rawlins, associate producer Henry MacRae, screenplay by Paul Huston, original story Johnston McCulley, dialogue director Jacques Jaccard, musical score by Charles Previn, Hans J. Salter, Frank Skinner, Franz Waxman and Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy (from ""Fingal's Cave Overture, Op. 26)...the cast includes Lon Chaney Jr (Jim Lane), Noah Beery Sr (Frank Chadwick), Noah Beery Jr (Sierra Pete), Don Terry (Buckskin Billy Burke), Helen Parrish (Barbara Gilbert), Tom Chatterton (Tom Gilbert), Charles Stevens (Puma), Robert Barron (Charles Darson), Harry Cording (Gregg/henchman), Chief Thundercloud (Chief Many Moons), Iron Eyes Cody (Indian), William Desmond (Banker Williams), Henry Hall (Mr. Crabtree), Jack Rockwell (Slade/hired gun), Jack Clifford (Sheriff Tyler), Chief Many Treaties (Chief Black Cloud), Al Taylor (Man in Cafe ), Forrest Taylor (Taylor), Ray Teal (Phony Indian)........special footnote, actor Lon Chaney Jr played a simple minded Lennie in John Steinbeck's ""Of Mice and Men"" (1939), his performance was memorable and touching, but his role for immortality shined when he played Lawrence Talbot, best known as the tortured soul in ""The Wolf Man"" (1941), the public couldn't get enough of this new excitement on the big screen, a series of horror films followed Chaney as he became a household name in the Universal Monster department, remember those were the Karloff, Lugosi and Lon Chaney Jr. years.........meanwhile back to our Universal Serial which is always good till the last drop and this serial is no exception...there is a great deal of entertainment here for the cliffhanger fans out there...all courtesy of VCI Entertainment, who in my humble opinion is the best there is in restoring early serials and features.
