979354,1,6305186359,"La Sanguisuge Conduce la Danza (The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance) (Alfredo Rizzo, 1975)

There are some movies that have been on my to-be-watched list for so long I not only no longer remember where I found out about them or why I put them there, I don't even remember adding them in the first place. That list has moved house so many times I don't have the faintest idea when most of the movies towards the beginning of it were added, but I know that La Sanguisuge Conduce la Danza was one of the first movies to hit it... so we're talking about fifteen years, give or take, I've been staring this movie's Amazon listing in the face without ever actually seeing it. Until yesterday. It recently popped up on Netflix Instant, and it's one of the movies on my endless DVD queue, so as soon as I saw the little blue ""Play"" button I moved it over to the Instant queue and fired it up. I did notice, briefly, before I did that when I'd resorted the queue by average rating, as I do every couple of weeks, that this flick was the second-lowest movie on my Netflix Instant queue out of 351 entries (only Ian Merrick's The Demon Within ranked lower). I should've listened.

First off, before you get to the actual movie, note that this [ed. Note for clarification: the version currently (as I write this) streaming on Netflix Instant] is Redemption Video's cut, and it includes an introductory video that I didn't time, but I think lasted about ten minutes. I'm not sure you will ever spend ten longer minutes in your life, unless you find yourself in a Turkish prison. I know I should have just fast-forwarded through it, but I had this odd idea in my head that it was actually part of the movie, so I kept watching until the actual movie started, at which point I kicked myself for sitting through it. Don't be this guy. Fast-forward until you see titles!

In any case, we then get to the actual film, which isn't all that much better. (Spoiler alert: there are no bloodsuckers to be found in this movie. Hell, ain't no dancin', nuther.) Count Marnack (The Last Man on Earth's Giacomo Rossi-Stuart), a lonely feudal lord whose remote estate is now dirt-poor, has been attending a series of shows put on by a burlesque troupe. When the theater housing them closes down, instead of scattering them to the winds, he offers them his castle as a place to stay until they get a chance to find new digs because Sybil (Salon Kitty's Patrizia Webley), the head of the troupe, is a dead ringer for the Count's wife who, he tells her once they're on the island, packed up and left him some years ago. Eventually, after all sorts of dallying, we come to something resembling a plot: seems the Count's grandfather and father both went crazy, beheaded their wives with an ornamental dagger, then killed themselves by leaping into the sea. Soon, members of the troupe begin turning up beheaded...

I'll put it this way: I watched this movie less than twenty-four hours ago as I write this, and the climax left so little impression on me I can't even remember who the killer was. It's a tiresome, badly-done attempt at giallo that fails on pretty much every level (even including gratuitous nudity, of which Rizzo seems to have thrown in a token amount and then decided to abandon). If the movie is notable for anything these days, it is that it marks the final onscreen appearance of Krista Nell, who died of leukemia shortly after the film was completed at the tender age of twenty-eight. (Nell, who played a bit part in Godard's Pierrot le Fou, is probably best remembered for The Red Headed Corpse, made three years before this.) She had originally been cast as the female lead, Marnack's nosy housekeeper, but switched to a supporting role because the leukemia was advancing at a rapid rate; the role was filled by Femi Benussi, from Pasolini's The Hawks and the Sparrows. Not that this is nearly enough reason to watch the movie, unless you're a big fan of one of the principals, but it's interesting. *",1365206400,8,3987,4.564245810055866
979355,1,6305186359,"In contrast to my fellow reviewers, I always try to find something redeeming in any film I see. Yes, the quality of the dubbing and lighting is abysmal, the acting is wooden and the opening sequence highly misleading what with all those lascivious female lesbian vampires with blood dripping. Something must be lost in the translation of the title; of the word ""Bloodsucker"" from the Italian almost as if the producers were originally going to film a Gothic Vampire tale and then changed their minds but could not afford to give up their dramatic opening sequence, so tacked it onto the film opening anyway.
This film made in 1975 has recently been issued on DVD and comes with its own theatrical trailer which in some respects is more daring than seen in the film! Now anyone who buys this film has probably already read its synopsis anyway and knows what to expect - Italian softporn from the mid 1970s. I bought it because I am attracted to Christa Nelli (credited most often as ""Krista Nell"").The absence of a cast of characters I find most frustrating in a lot of these Eurosleaze films from the 60s & 70s. I had hoped the producers would show the cast of characters as one hears their names in the film but without a cast list, it is very difficult to link them to the actor concerned. Krista Nell played ""Cora"" but underneath that massive hair style, costume and make-up and dubbed voice it is sometimes difficult to distinguish her.
There is mostly a two dimensional portrayal by the actors of their parts and no one really stands out. Maybe something is lost in the the whole translation & dubbing process. What were the positive points?Well the music was atmospheric and of course if you're into beautiful lesbian soft porn it's there. The external locations used were good and I would like to know where they filmed the castle on its island. It purports to be set in ""Ireland"" (North or the Republic?)in 1902, so everyone sports period piece costumes. Some of the scenes I found unintentionally funny especially those sex scenes!!Anyway an enjoyable romp. I rated it the lowest at one star.",1071360000,4,2101,4.711956521739131
979356,1,6305186359,"Even if you enjoyed watching paint dry, this movie would still bore you to death.  This is easily one of the slowest, dullest, visually uninteresting titles in the recent wave of euro-horror releases on DVD and VHS.  It's  anemic to the 100th degree.  Except for a few severed heads and a dollop  of nudity, there is absolutely nothing here to recommend.  There's also no  bloodsucker and no dance.  Don't waste your time - life is short!",960163200,7,438,4.671052631578948

7884633,1,6305186359,"I watched this on Amazon Prime. The title is completely misleading, as is the description in the listing. Although there is a murder mystery woven into the story, there are no clues for the viewer to follow, so the revelation at the end of the film makes no sense whatsoever.

There is an ""introductory"" clip at the beginning of the film that is totally irrelevant the the film. Unfortunately, the closed caption's timing for the film is knocked out of sync by the intro, so the CC runs several minutes behind the actual vocals.",1454803200,,528,4.617021276595745
