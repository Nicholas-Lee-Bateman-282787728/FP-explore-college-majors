8289219,5,B001CTUQRK,"This movie, about a group of high school girls who get forced into creating a jazz band, is excellent.  They end up loving music which, as it happens, fits their preparation of for the movie.  The director didn't want to dub in professionals playing (though the girls did dub themselves in the studio).  He chose girls (and one boy) who had never played these instruments.  Many never played any instrument.  They started learning 3 months before filming began and continued during the filming itself.  Their final concert performance was filmed about 6 months after they started learning to play.  Really quite amazing.  The director felt that this experience would carry over into the movie's realism and I think it did.

I don't have the blu-ray version myself, but surely it must have better quality than my version.

Highly recommended.  An excellent ""feel-good"" movie without faking the playing.",1359590400,6,901,5.061224489795919
