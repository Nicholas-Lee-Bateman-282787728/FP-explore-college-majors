8691824,3,B00QL3KDPC,"There are a lot of positive reviews of this movie around the web, but it does stretch one's suspense of disbelief a bit early on when the priest seems to grasp less about the topic of his sermon than the casual-listening female lead who is pursuing him. Quite odd that the priest seemed to know nothing about the contrast between Jezebel and Mary Magdalene (repentance), or failed to express it from that point on. Just yelling ""get out"" was hardly illuminating. Perhaps the writer / producers had little concept themselves. The resolution is far better in that direction, though, with good allusions.",1464998400,,601,4.901960784313726
