3659993,5,B001JV5BC6,Excellent and would like to receive messages on any other new dvd's out for Tyler Perry.,1234051200,,88,4.5625
3659994,5,B001JV5BC6,"Some coworkers and I went to see this in Dallas. Sadly, one of our own left us to be in it. :) I am a big fan of the Tyler Perry plays and this is definitely one of the best. It will definitely make you laugh and will probably make you cry. The singing is incredible! By the end, the entire audience was on their feet. You will not regret this purchase!

note: I definitely have to agree with the review left by Felicia Flagler. I have no idea who the actors/actresses are who Amazon listed and think it is definitely a big slap in the face to the real people who put on such an amazing performance!",1232323200,22,599,4.076271186440678
3659995,1,B001JV5BC6,"While I am avid Tyler Perry ""movie"" fan, this play just emphasized why I prefer to wait until it is turned into a movie to go and see it.  I thought the actor that played the father (who appeared to be about the same age as the son) was way too ""over the top"" with his acting.  While some parts of his acting actually elicited a few laughs from me, for the most part his character was annoying.  And while I am on the subject, several of those actors seemed as though they were reading from well placed cue cards throughout the stage because the acting was terrible, especially the man she left her husband for, his timing was off as if he were always in a rush to say his lines, and that entire character of the secretary was . . . . I cannot even find a sutiable word for her acting.

As I stated earlier, I would prefer to wait for the movies than to go see anymore plays.  Acting in a play should be no different than acting in a film and these actors really turned me away from this play. Would have been upset had I spent good money to actually go and see the filming of this debacle. Thank goodness it was playing in a beauty shop where I was forced to endure it.  And as a counselor, don't even get me started on how unrealistic her portrayal of an actual counselor was, and the fact that two unprofessional people were just able to step in and conduct the counseling was too much for me to take.  And before anyone comments on my post and how it was ""only a play"", if he can consult professionals for the actual movies, then he should also do so for the plays, more money is spent on plays than on movies.",1231804800,7,1614,4.1210191082802545
3659996,5,B001JV5BC6,My husband and I went and seen this play live and it was another wonderful play by Tyler Perry. He is amazing and always right on point. This is a  must see and I will definetly be buying the dvd in january.,1229299200,22,207,3.9285714285714284

3660089,5,B001JV5BC6,"This play is so Incredible to believe it to be true as another favorite of Tyler Perry. Mr. Perry made a cool play way before remaking it as a movie with almost the same storylines between them. I did not know Timon Kyle Durrett was in this, even though I seen him play as basketball player and father/husband Davis West on the urban OWN TV series, Queen Sugar.",1481846400,,361,4.323529411764706

3660421,4,B001JV5BC6,This is one of those plays that I enjoyed just as much as I enjoyed the movie version. I guess that's what happens when you lose focus on the bigger picture of a marriage and concentrate on the here and now pleasures. Her love for things were stronger than her love for what her husband was sacrificing so she could have had.,1403136000,,325,4.258064516129032

3660426,5,B001JV5BC6,GREAT PLAY ABOUT LIFE AND THAT 80/20 RULE.  REMEMBER KEEP GOD FIRST AND IN EVERY RELATIOSHIP AND YOU WILL NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM.  LOL,1397001600,,133,4.5
3660487,1,B001JV5BC6,"If you're a fan of Tyler Perry's theatrical works, then you'd enjoy this play.  It's an oft-told story: the ups and downs of love and marriage.  In this case, it really hits home for someone who helps other people in their marriage, herein lies the irony.

As far as the play went, it was pretty unwatchable, except for the fabulous singing.  The comedy seemed really silly and out of place, and I wondered is this a comedy?  But there's so much drama!  Clich&eacute;s abounded in this story too: the petite, blonde assistant who acted ""ghetto fabulous"" (for lack of a better term) and surprised the audience with her super-soulful vocals.  Newsflash, Tyler: the late, great Teena Marie was probably available, you should have just casted her! LOL

Like I said, if you are a TP fan, you'll enjoy this one.  I thought it was for a very specific audience: the churchgoing crowd.  I didn't think TP was particularly concerned for non-Christians or people who don't regularly listen to gospel music.

ETA: 4/24/17 - I wanted to amend this review and take it from two stars down to one.  I had an aunt visit over the past weekend who happens to be a TP fan, so I suggested we watch this one.  My mistake!  As I said before, this play was kind of unwatchable--the humor is incredibly sophomoric and a bit asinine, especially from the actor who plays the father-in-law.  If there aren't comedy clich&eacute;s hitting you about the head, then it's the eye-rolling preachiness threatening to make you gag.  You would have thought I had some kind of tic from all the cringing I was doing.  The set design was basic, the lighting and sound were fine, the costuming run-of-the-mill.  The ladies' wigs were a bit plastic-looking, but the makeup was fine.

Aside from the wonderful singing talent, this play was worthless.  It was just mindless entertainment, IMO.  Again, this play (along with a few other TP plays I've seen) was geared for a largely African-American (perhaps Southern) Christian audience.  I'm sure that people of other backgrounds would enjoy this if they either are of a religious background themselves OR are open-minded.  With that said, that is not what makes this play unwatchable--it's because of a lame script rife with clich&eacute;s and a nice dose of patriarchy.  The actors performed to the best of their ability, but it just wasn't enough.  With an audience that'll eat up whatever you serve, there's no real need for depth, right?  Microwaveable entertainment, this is.

I saw that a film version of this play was made, but it looked like a dark, tragic drama--nothing at all like this light-hearted, ""cautionary"" tale.",1394841600,,2638,4.843400447427293

3660522,5,B001JV5BC6,"This is another of Tyler Perry's well-written and highly entertaining plays.  It would have been nice to see another couple in the session, but it worked really nicely with just the two very funny couples.  The father is much funnier than the mother, but he could be funny playing opposite a paper bag.  The more serious or tender conversations slowed just a couple of scenes, but not to the point that you get bored and it is important for the way the play ends.  There is a strong Christian message, but I feel that is intertwined a little better in this one because it is not so ""in your face"" and ""preachy"" like some of the other plays.  This is one of the plays that would have an awesome soundtrack, so when the group sings together, it is really the highlight of the play.  Great from start to finish!",1381708800,2,808,4.389261744966443

If you have raised girls and made the sarcifices to give them a good life growing up, YOU will TRULY relate too & love the song! Tyler Perry needs to get this song and a few more on cd.! Also IF you go to church it makes a fantastic ""Mother's Day Song"". It has been requested on the google search for that same reason. My movie collection holds only "" THE BEST"".

3660543,5,B001JV5BC6,"""The Marriage Counselor"" was well acted; a young woman feels qualified to give advice to married couples, but fails to address the issues in her own marriage.

3660587,5,B001JV5BC6,"People frequently say Tyler Perry's plays/movies are overhyped and too sappy. I like too sappy. But I believe this play lives up to the hype. This play was my introduction to Palmer Williams Jr  aka Floyd. But the entire cast was very talented and performed within the lines needed. Tyler himself says he did this play as a vehicle to give new actors a break. This was truly a successful effort. All the ladies sang well, not too much over the top performances as well as the plot played out well. There were noticeable differences from the movie. I believe theres an advantage to the disc standing on its own. It shows you this play is a great mix of talent, timing and Tyler's vision.",1369267200,,686,4.488

He was so good in singing (didn't know he sung) that I had to rewind to some of his singing to see it again, especially when he sang 'Love and Happiness', danced and did Michael Jackson.  FLOYD IS HILLARIOUS and crazy.

This is one you will look at again and again, because there are so many funny parts. You know the more you look at a play, the more you see something you did not see before.

I am building up a large library of good Black movies and plays on DVDs, because TV and cable don't have nothing good to look at but repeats and old movies 20-50yrs old, and taking our money. I want to see the movies in the theater so I PPV and go online.  I had netflix for 4 yrs, and they cheat you and never let you see a movie from the theater even when it has been out for a year.

3660713,5,B001JV5BC6,"I have watched this play by Tyler Perry so many times.  The characters as far as playing their parts were just great. Tyler is still displaying a message in this play as all the others that he's produced what can happen in real life in a marriage when two people that are high professionals themselves can drift away or get lost in their careers. It's so easy to get caught up in other things that can cause an effect on a marriage if you're not paying attention to what's going on .  My man Palmer took the show off the hook. I've studied all of the people Tyler has chosen in each play since the beginning, but Palmer has out aced them all. This man is not talented he has been born with the gift from birth. Anthony I've seen in some of the play's also is great.  When he played the part in Why did I get married I fell in love with him right then and was hoping that Tyler would us him more. In marriage counselor when he founded out that his wife had commit cheated on him and he set there a cried tore me up. At the same time he was not paying attention to her needs where he should. It was a play to demonstrate how in real life what can happen when we don't place God as our captain.  We are bound to allow the adversary trick us and we fall and drift the wrong way. Everyone should get this DVD and study it if you're professional business person or not.",1292976000,6,1363,4.074626865671642

They all were very polished and did just the right amount of over acting in the parts of the play that called for it and the singing was omg!...awesome is all I can say. The stage was well done , lit and designed and gave full effects on every single scene. The stage was made and done much better than probably any other Tyler Perry play. It was well written with almost I would have to say, perfect scripts. The outcome was not expected and I won't tell it but dang! It was worth my money.

3660785,4,B001JV5BC6,"There are always parts of a play you don't care for but overall this was good. There was some overacting on the mother and daughters part. Palmer Williams made the play. He was funny and thorough in his part.
The white girl could sing but she was not a good actress. Every word out of her mouth seemed rehearsed because it wasn't her way of speaking. She just couldn't get it across in the way she should have.
The girl that played the wife was not realistic with her screaming, and intentionally humiliating the husband. The husband was just plain stupid. I don't know if I disliked him or the wife more. He was just as bad as she was. I only enjoyed him when he interacted with the father. I don't even want to talk about the guy who played the other man.
I enjoyed the woman who played the stripper (excuse me, exotic dancer)I thought she was quite funny. Her husbands role wasn't really significant, not enough to call it good or bad.
 The big girl was hilarious as well. There was more good than bad in this play. Yes, there have been better, but there have also been worse. I thought Palmer Williams was exceptional. I laughed almost every time he was on the screen. Seeing him in The House of Payne does him no justice.  I actually borrowed the dvd from my neice to watch, but I am going to purchase it. I give it 4 stars.",1257811200,,1329,4.290836653386454

The situations were relatable. Many of us have probably been there, done that ourselves. With the usual Perry flair, the singing and humor added the necessary sparks to the play. He always finds great singers and recalls those actor/singers from the past to make appearances. It was entertaining. The last half hour was hilarious! I apologize for not putting this comment in the 'correct' place.",1253577600,,568,4.747474747474747

As in most movies, if you can't relate to it, you may not like or agree with it...but for me, this movie touched home, was insightful, hysterical, touching, impressive and just plain out a lesson learned. Even if your not married, it provides a lesson for all relationships while enjoying the entertainment of fantastic singing, songs, messages and lessons learned along the way...like I said, if you don't have a relation to it or hunger to be the best you can be for your significant other, than maybe you should just move on, so you don't ruin the name of a creative, insightful and blessed man, Tyler Perry...Happy Watching!!",1238198400,,645,4.716814159292035

3660994,2,B001JV5BC6,"I began watching this play last night. Not even 10 minutes into it I popped right back out. It got off to a bad start with me. Instead I watched the play ""Man of Her Dreams"" & it was off the hook! So this afternoon I tried ""The Marriage Counselor"" again. I winced throughout it but I told myself I had to finish it. It was such a disappointment. If Tyler Perry's name wasn't on it I wouldn't have recognized it as one of his. This must've been during a slump. The script wasn't good, and the acting was needs-improvement. Most of the actors were overacting & it was bad at that! I winced through much of the counseling scenes because these people were ghetto beyond belief. Tyler embraced the stereotype of loud black people who talk to much and never listen. Tony Grant is good in everything I've seen him in, and he did a good job despite the limits placed upon him. He had to play a dummy though. I thought I was watching a replay of the idiot husband from 'The Family That Preys' I was irritated with him. The female lead was great! Can't wait to see her in something else. The parents were ugggghhhhhh. The preacher/stripper couple were much too ghetto for me. The white chick could blow, but that's all she should've done. Her role was terrible & I couldn't stand watching the scenes she was in.",1234742400,6,1301,4.3580246913580245

3661000,5,B001JV5BC6,"Marriage Counselor is an excellent play that conveys the Black woman and Black man of today.  The woman is more successful from the professional stand point of a career and does not understand that being loved is more important than being financially successful.  On the otherhand, the man is truly not a good listener and is lacking in communication skills when it comes to what she is actually saying in regards to their relationship.  This is typical of many Black relationships struggling to make marriages work.  We need to be more aware of these basic problems in order to evaluate what communication skills can be developed and improved upon as a race of people; ""Marriage Counselor"" is a play indicative of the challenges a relationship presents when there is a flaw in communication.",1234137600,4,792,4.932330827067669
