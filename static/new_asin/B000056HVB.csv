7932000,2,B000056HVB,This is just a camcorder quality look at New Orleans mardi gras. I always thought I would like to go there and participate but after watching this tape I'm having second thoughts. About 90% of the show is just overweight intoxicated and inarticulate men trying to get the women who occasionally wander by to expose their breasts. Most of the women are far too old to be making a spectacle of themselves. And far too flabby. But the men are so intoxicated they don't seem to mind. There's no narration nor any point to this video.,1348963200,,529,4.520833333333333
