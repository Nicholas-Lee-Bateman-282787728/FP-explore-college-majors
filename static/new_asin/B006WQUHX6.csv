8505834,3,B006WQUHX6,As I was watching this movie it was really interesting to see I recognized a lot of the actors in it though they are much older  I felt really about what happened to Angela Lansbury's character I felt that she was really sad  I guess both husband and wife were sad. The Loss of a child is something one never gets over I felt as though the movie was a little slow and really didn't give enough information about each character I was a little confused in some ways it was alright though I will keep it,1399680000,3,500,4.144329896907217
8505835,3,B006WQUHX6,"This movie basically takes you on a tour of historic sites in Greece.  Everything else, like the storyline of the film and the forbidden love/romance angle are lacking. Much of the blame goes to the editing room for chopping the movie to shreds.  Scenes jump so  obviously you end up wondering what you missed.
Characters were also lacking.  Both women (Jane Fonda and Angela Lansbury) were portrayed as overly-dramatic and needy.
And the men (Peter Finch and Arthur Hill) were toooo polite and civil.",1362096000,4,501,4.928571428571429
8505836,4,B006WQUHX6,"Any description of this movie must start with Jane Fonda's Cleopatra wig. It's amazing -- along with just about all of her outfits. Fonda, age 20 when this was shot, appears as a sophisticated, unhappy New Yorker with some vague, never-named illness that means she's supposed to be fragile. Her bland husband suggests that his best friend, Peter Finch, show her a good time, then acts surprised when they fall in love on a jaunt to Greece. Angela Lansbury plays Finch's wife, a bitter shrew of the first order, a character right out of a Patricia Highsmith novel; she's worth the price of admission. After many cigarettes, cocktails and visits to Greek temples, Finch and Fonda positively seize life, yes they do. BUT ONLY ONE SURVIVES.",1362096000,8,736,4.849206349206349
