5749746,4,B00CX3FT3K,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Based-on-the-books/dp/0312426321/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Based on the books</a>&nbsp;by Benjamin Black, ""Quirke"" is a three-part miniseries that's as much family drama as it is amateur detective show.

Set in 1950s Dublin, Quirke (Gabriel Byrne) is an alchoholic pathologist with a complex family life. Simultaneously the black sheep *and* his adopted father's favourite, Quirke is adored by his niece, resented by his brother, and clearly harbouring reciprocal feelings for his sister-in-law. The three ninety-minute episodes gradually tease out the web of exasperation, fondness, antagonism and inevitable secret-keeping that lies between them.

In amongst all this familial intrigue you'd be mistaken for thinking there's isn't any mystery to solve, and to be honest, the whodunit element of the episodes is generally not as central (or as interesting) as Quirke's private life.

In ""Christine Falls"" Quirke returns to the morgue to discover his brother in his office, tampering with the records of a young woman called Christine Falls. Curiosity piqued, he begins to do some digging, discovering that the woman died in childbirth (this was the information his brother was trying to hide) and that there's no sign of the baby anywhere.

Coming to suspect that the cover-up involves the Catholic Church, members of his own family, and dozens of other pregnant girls, Quirke heads to Boston with his teenaged niece Phoebe to investigate further.

""The Silver Swan"" involves Phoebe becoming entangled with a blackmailer who seduces women, gets them hooked on pills, and mails them their nude photographs, threatening to publish them if they don't pay up. And before you cry ""spoiler!"" rest assured that all this is spelt out pretty clearly within the first ten minutes of the episode. In fact, the audience knows what's going on long before Quirke catches up, and what tension exists is derived from the knowledge that Phoebe is getting drawn into Leslie White's trap whilst her guardian's attention is elsewhere.

Finally, ""Elegy for April""deals with the disappearance of Phoebe's friend April and her request that Quirke make inquiries. Though Quirke is grappling with his drinking problems, he obliges his niece and soon discovers that she died of a botched abortion - and that her friends are involved in the cover-up.

Though the production values are high, the tone and content is unremittingly bleak. Practically every character, from the kindly grandparents to the wholesome young couple to the convent nuns eventually expose themselves as slimy, bitter, petty or dangerous. Even the weather is perpetually grim.

It's difficult to really engage with any of the characters - Gabriel Byrne's charisma pulls him through, but even the likeable characters such as Sarah and Phoebe (his sister-in-law and niece respectively) are kept at arm's length. However, the cast is impressive, including Michael Gambon, Nick Dunning, Geraldine Somerville, and even Colin Morgan (from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Merlin/dp/B00MBQYKG6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Merlin</a>) popping in for a brief guest role.

This review sounds more negative than I mean it to be, but the truth is that you don't want to settle down with ""Quirke"" as a bit of light entertainment. The crimes are sordid, the atmosphere is uninviting and most of the cast is awash in corruption and depravity. Although I can't say I ""enjoyed"" it exactly, I certainly appreciated it for its attention to detail (1950s Dublin is beautifully captured), its fidelity the source material, and the difficult moral questions it raised (""judgment"" is a big theme, particularly in regards to who is justified in dishing it out).

I'd cautiously recommend it for those who know what they're getting into.",1410480000,12,3870,5.634020618556701
5749747,4,B00CX3FT3K,"This series (of three episodes, not four as I had expected) is really very good. Good production values -- interesting  color palette, of foggy yellowd and light greens with, say, a bright colored coat and scarf in the center, authentic-appearing 1959 backgrounds and interiors...
Story, about an alcoholic medical pathologist beset by demons who solves crimes using cues from dead bodies and interviews, etc.
There is no scene of gory autopsies; this is all done cerebrally and investigatively.
But the doctor drinks and drinks bourbon. Finally, he goes to get help, after he finds out who one, at least, of his parents is who gave him away.

The one detail which was distracting throughout is that Gabriel Byrne seems to be playing a man of fifty, though he is 64 and looks it. Certainly doesn't look young enough to be the son of a man Michael Gambon's age, 73. The script insists he is younger as well. Gambon tells his son, 'You are still young', not something you tell a 63-64 year old.

There are a couple of smaller details, problem of the writer not getting together with the set designer, which loosen our belief: e.g. man walks into a young woman's apartment and says 'Very spartan', when it's not. The director should have caught it.

The acting and directing are very good. The murder stories, with enough whole-series story glue to keep it interesting and of-a-piece, flow seamlessly.",1407628800,11,1398,4.836820083682008
8587084,5,B00CX3FT3K,"Quite good. Acting is great by all--amazing cast of talented people. Cinematography well done. Editing excellent. Stories about a Dublin pathologist who is investigating murders (or supposed murders). Tragic circumstances involving young women pregnant ""out of wedlock"" as they used to say & their babies.
My only quibble would be that the depiction of people in Boston is off kilter. Accents vary from Bronx-ish to Brooklyn-ish to Way Down South in Dixie-ish. Not Bostonian.
Other than that, an excellent series. Even though I am ""almost Catholic"" (all my neighbors are Catholic, very fine people, kind & loving) and I sometimes go to Mass, the anti-Catholic tone didn't bother me. I love Pope Francis & my Catholic friends. But there were some very bad goings-on in the church in those days.
I'd have liked to have seen April alive in her story (via flash backs). And I very much wanted to know how Quirke's mother was. Irritating that is left blank",1509667200,,951,4.95
8587085,5,B00CX3FT3K,I watched via Britbox subscription (which is great). Terrific cast.,1506902400,,67,5.8
8587086,5,B00CX3FT3K,"Wonderful, dark and complex. The murder mystery portion of the story is secondary to the human interest stories being related, but they are detective pieces and the story resolution (at the end of both mysteries) is deeply satisfying. Because Quirke is so broken I became frustrated early on with his and his family's inability to stop being victims of their personalities, but the story does resolve well, the mysteries are satisfying and the discussion of Irish culture is vivid and poignantly revealed.",1470182400,4,505,5.170731707317073

8587090,4,B00CX3FT3K,"Three serviceable adaptations of three very complex books. While Gabriel Byrne is an excellent Quirke, the stories would have worked better as three separate, but connected, multiple-episode series than sharply pruned mini-movies. But keep in mind, this review is written by a lover of the Benjamin Black books.",1440288000,4,311,5.5

8587092,5,B00CX3FT3K,I loved all the books that are based on Quirke and would love to see the BBC series in the USA. Please format it and make it available in the USA. I rated it based on the books as I have not seen the series. Thanks,1428624000,7,214,3.6739130434782608
