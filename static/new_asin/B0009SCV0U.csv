2318129,5,B0009SCV0U,I ordered this DVD because my grandsons ages 4-10 years old watched my copy so much until it skips when it plays so I had to order another one. They are absolutely mesmerized by this Movie. They watch it over and over again. They know the video by memory. They love to sing along with the vid and know everything about each planet.,1437868800,,331,4.26984126984127
2318130,5,B0009SCV0U,So awesome! Great watch for parents and children. very funny and clever. great for remembering all the planets and facts about them.,1428883200,,132,5.045454545454546
2318131,1,B0009SCV0U,"My 6 and 4 year old hated this. We didn't even get 10 minutes into it and my 6 year old wanted to turn it off. She said it was boring.
$17.00 down the drain. Save your money!",1428537600,,174,3.6052631578947367
2318132,3,B0009SCV0U,"My 3.5 yr old kid loves all the animated ""planet"" vids on YouTube. This is like those, but longer, yet, with real actors' faces superimposed over the planets. It's definitely more cheesy, mainly because of the kid actor and the songs. Haaaa. Well, my son likes watching it. I hate it. Haaaa",1428451200,,290,4.596153846153846
2318133,5,B0009SCV0U,This is a great movie.  Highly recommend. My 4 year loves this movie,1424908800,,68,4.230769230769231
2318134,1,B0009SCV0U,"This DVD is HORRIBLE. Absolutely horrible. My 4 year old son is obsessed with the solar system... He can rattle off the names of each planets moons, all of the dwarf planets, which planets are terrestrial vs the gas giants... This DVD provides no information other than the order of the planets. And you have to sit through about 25 minutes of some of the worst singing, acting and lyrics I have ever seen in order to learn that much.  Please know that if it had ANY substance at all, I would be able to look past the awfulness. But sadly, that is not the case. I would also like to point out that it appears that every single five star review was written by someone associated with the DVD!!!  No one would ever rave about this abomination as they did in all those reviews.",1423958400,,774,4.3310344827586205

2318138,4,B0009SCV0U,"If I could remove the phrase ""fart ball"" from the context I would rate this 5 stars fun and educational.  My son really doesn't need to repeat that and start immature bathroom humor at age 3.",1414800000,,191,4.305555555555555
2318139,3,B0009SCV0U,Cheesy. Doesnt have the appeal to keep my little one interested.,1414108800,,64,4.909090909090909

2318141,5,B0009SCV0U,"I didn't realize that this newer version also includes a little segment (seamlessly added towards end of movie) explaining that Pluto is no longer a planet but a dwarf planet. They where able to use the original actor, so you can't tell that the new part was never part of the original movie (unless you saw the original).",1405296000,,322,4.568965517241379
2318142,5,B0009SCV0U,This is an excellent video that explains the solar system is easy to understand terms. Would highly recommend it for early learning.,1397347200,,132,5.045454545454546
2318143,5,B0009SCV0U,BEST video. Super cute. My 4&2 yo love it and know all their planets. Great songs and funny. Highly recommend,1397260800,,109,4.5
2318144,5,B0009SCV0U,"We still sing the theme song....this is a well made video that introduces the planets to you and your children....they even upgraded to include the downgrade of pluto as an actual planet to a dwarf planet....there I said it...planet.
Good stuff.",1392854400,,245,5.0
2318145,5,B0009SCV0U,"My kids absolutely love that movie, they watch it at least once a week, very educating and funny, easy to remember songs, and my daughter at age 3 knows the order and names of all planets now. It seems a little annoying and too silly for adults, but so worth to let your child watch it a lot.",1388707200,,292,4.051724137931035
2318146,5,B0009SCV0U,"My Son Loves it so High Five!!
Cute, I love how they sing and I am not a musical person.
My son enjoys it bottom line. Good way to learn!!",1386201600,,138,3.6333333333333333
2318147,5,B0009SCV0U,"My kids love this movie and they ask to watch it over and over.  They even sing along with it.  If you're the kind to sing with your kids in the car, this video is great - the songs are short and easy to learn.  The jokes are perfect for little kids, and it's educational.  The bonus features are also quite fascinating.",1382486400,,320,4.112903225806452
2318148,1,B0009SCV0U,I ordered this on October 5.  It was not even shipped until October 11.  The arrival time has changed and won't be until (estimated October 16)  Way too long.  It really doesn't matter about the condition since it will be too late.  I would not recommend these people to anyone.  Internet orders need to be timely in order to compete with stores.  I had ordered a number of Halloween items and they have all arrived.  Between the slowness of the site and the slowness of UPS.  Nobody should use UPS.  They are very slow.,1381622400,,520,4.4361702127659575
2318159,5,B0009SCV0U,"I ordered it for my 7 y.o. grandson he not only loves it, but his 2 y.o. sister loves it too and watches it with him and alone when he is at camp. I haven't seen it yet, but there is music and I think songs cause my granddaughter always says she wants to watch the music planets. I say get it for your kids of any age its fun and educational.",1377561600,,342,3.763888888888889
2318160,5,B0009SCV0U,"We got this video from my sister-in-law (from a thrift store) a few years ago and one day put it on to see if the kids (2 and 4yrs.) would like it. They were mezmorized by it, even my very active nephew (2yrs) just sat and stared at it. We eventually bought the updated version and to this day still if we put it on, all the kids have to do is hear the first couple notes of the intro and they come runing. My daughter knew all the planets at age 4 and loved to sing the songs. Now at 5 1/2 she still loves it and sings and dances to it. It is well worth the money!",1364774400,,565,3.7563025210084033
2318161,5,B0009SCV0U,My little grandchildren played the DVD so often it would no longer play and I had to buy a second one! They kept asking to play it over and over.,1364601600,,145,3.8666666666666667
2318162,5,B0009SCV0U,My kids love this movie. Educational and entertaining. We first learned of this movie from the potty power movie and he asked for it for Christmas.,1359072000,,147,4.6923076923076925
2318163,4,B0009SCV0U,"A slightly silly and cheesy production with dated visual effects and over the top acting.  However, my pre school kids absolutely love it and watch it over and over.  I must admit, the songs are catchy and you will find yourself humming or singing them to yourself throughout the day.  Bottom line, despite it's shortcomings, it is a great way to expose your kids to science and the planets and I would recommend it for younger elementary kids.",1356739200,,444,4.666666666666667

2318165,1,B0009SCV0U,"This is my 3rd purchase of the product.  Back in 2007, when I bought it for the first time, it worked like a charm in my DVD player and we loved it.  My then toddler son learned all of the planets quickly.  Now, I have been trying to unsuccessfully replace the original copy with new one, already twice.  Each time the replacement DVD comes and it does not play in the well working DVD player.  The first replacement copy I bought on E-Bay for $3.95 delivered for which I got a full refund and today I just received another bad copy from Amazon.com for which I paid about $16 delivered.  The Amazon DVD's picture did show up after a minute or two of disc spinning and making noises.  The picture showed the warning for a while, and then it started and stopped playing.  Where are these CHEAP copies being made?  They are packaged in an envelope, not a plastic case we are used to seeing.  I am VERY upset about the POOR COPY quality, because I PROMISED my son that the final working replacement is coming today.  Also, my daughter is not going to have a chance to learn her planets.  Take these DVD's off the website!!!  They are just cheap copies, not working DVD's. They might even be illegally copied thus faulty.  My family is very disappointed with the purchase.",1352332800,,1267,4.428571428571429
2318166,3,B0009SCV0U,"I got this for my 6 yr. old, based on the reviews. I expected this to be much longer as stated. (70 min.) This is the length including the NASA videos. The actual show is less than a half hour. My son did seem to hold an interest and it is a good way to learn the planets. If you get this at  cheaper price it might be worth it.",1352246400,,328,3.6857142857142855
2318167,4,B0009SCV0U,"I overall really like the movie. I thought it had some fun songs and the information was presented in a memorable way. The Pluto update was fun. The small issue I have is the kid is a little snotty, and the jokes are kinda annoying. The best part of the DVD is the NASA footage in the bonus material. It's really cool.",1347148800,,318,4.145161290322581
2318168,5,B0009SCV0U,"This DVD taught my grandkids about the solar system in a fun way.
The images of the planets as people helped them connect to the planets and remember facts about each planet.
It helped them learn the order of the planets. This is entertaining, written for elementary age children.
I thought that the songs were cute and creative. If you want to enjoy a simple show about planets, here it is!",1342483200,,391,4.52112676056338

Buy it for your kids, it`s not expensive and pretty fun! Although for adults it may probably seem too silly, but kids love it! Oh, by the way, it is in a paper/carton cover, not plastic, in case anyone is wondering.",1341878400,,403,3.9876543209876543
2318180,2,B0009SCV0U,This was advertised as the updated version but was actually the old version.  When I asked the seller about the difference they said they didn't have the new version but I checked online again and they were still advertising as having the new version.  Be careful.,1326067200,,264,4.717391304347826
2318181,5,B0009SCV0U,"Recently, my four-year-old son had a space-themed birthday party, and I gave away this DVD to each kid in the goodie bags. Well, I know that my family enjoys Jake's adventure and all the wonderful songs with space factoids, but I couldn't believe all the emails and phone calls I received from other parents raving about how their kids cannot get enough of the DVD. As for the reviewer that was put off by Venus not liking Mercury calling her names like ""fartball"" and ""planet stinky""- that is ridiculous, especially since it emphasizes to children that the gases on Venus smell like sulphur. Great music and great fun. Also, it does explain how Pluto lost its status as a planet. Very well done there.",1308873600,,702,4.669354838709677
2318182,5,B0009SCV0U,"We have been learning about the solar system (I work for NASA). My granddaughter is in kindergarten (just turned 6), and my 7 year old grandson is blind. They have been learning a lot about the planets, Sun, gravity, space etc.  Anyway, they love this DVD.  I had to buy it used because I couldn't find a new one. It was perfect.  This is a kid's animation adventure.  A boy in a spaceship meets each of the planets in the solar system. Each planet sings about itself -- it is phenomenal how easy the songs make it to remember information about the planets. My grandkids watched this a few times and knew  most of the words to the songs. THEY LOVED IT.  Seriously, my granddaughter said this DVD is now her favorite DVD -- she wants to take it to school as well. Up until now, The Wizard of Oz has been her favorite all her life.  Also, my blind grandson loved this. After spending a few weeks learning about the solar system in a variety of formats, this was the least dry -- it's hilarious and lively and a blast!  My grandson loves the songs.  Then, on the DVD there is a 5-question quiz. Sure it doesn't seem like much, but my grandkids LOVE quizzes. So after they pass the quiz, you can print out a cool certificate from the DVD (in pdf format) and fill in each kid's name.  There is a newer version of this DVD and I read it is NOT EXACTLY THE SAME AND NOT RECOMMENDED. So stick with this one. Every kid doesn't like everything, but this was a big hit with my grandkids (and me!).",1303948800,,1486,4.23758865248227

2318185,5,B0009SCV0U,"This is a great educational video.  My daughter really likes the planets.  We like all of the songs.  This isn't meant to be a great science fiction movie, so if you are looking for special effects, this isn't the video, but it is cute and you get the idea of the space travel of the boy.  I would highly recommend this video and the other by Wonderscape called ""Potty Power.""",1295740800,,376,4.328571428571428

It is a little odd to watch adult faces superimposed onto planets but it is kinda cool. My two and four year old love this movie! Storyline is kinda strange but my kids love it. The songs are easy to remember and sing. Great movie!",1292198400,,303,4.527272727272727
2318187,5,B0009SCV0U,"What could be better?  My six grandchildren were huddled together mesmerized by this entertaining and educational video.  The high energy performers and the easy to learn songs make this a fun activity while they are learning a great deal about space.

2318189,2,B0009SCV0U,"I eagerly bought this video after having borrowed it from the library a million times. I was especially pleased that this video had been updated to include the ""demotion"" of Pluto. However, that is not the only edit.  In addition, the planets call each other names that are not fit for small ears.  IE, ""fartball"".  Therefore, a perfectly good video is now worthless. The edits are unnecessary and disappointing. I plan to contact the company and tell them the same.",1278460800,,466,4.8
2318190,3,B0009SCV0U,My son and I were looking forward to watch  this DVD. We were disappointed. My son didn't like it at all and I thought the quality of the image was very disappointing.

2318192,5,B0009SCV0U,This is a great video for 4-6 year olds.  It offers basic knowledge (2 or 3 pieces of information on each planet and lively songs.  I took my grandsons to an OMSI planet display and then followed it with this video.

I picked this movie up at the dollar store. When I first showed it to the kids, I was shocked to see some of the name calling the planets call each other. ""Fart Face"" ""Planet Stinky."" I was thinking, ooo, I think I should have previewed this before showing it to the kids. In fact, I didn't show it for a while. But the kids kept asking for it. I eventually started showing it again. The kids have seen it many times and still love it. And as of today, they never once have called each other or used those terms Fart face and Planet stinky.",1263859200,,678,4.143939393939394
2318195,5,B0009SCV0U,This is a must mave movie for your little space walker. Our four year old loved this movie from pre-K so he received it for Christmas. He can recite the planets and much of the info about them just from watching this movie a few times!,1262563200,,235,4.130434782608695

2318199,5,B0009SCV0U,"This DVD is a bit kooky with the music and catchy songs but you have to keep in mind that it is geared toward kids.  Each planet has a face and talks and sings.  My 2 1/2 year old and 5 year old just love it and can practically recite the script and sing all of the songs.  The only negatives are that it includes Pluto as a planet (Pluto is now considered a dwarf planet) and also the planet Venus says that she is a gassy planet and she is teased with names like ""Fart ball"" and ""stinky"".  This has not been a big deal for us because the kids have learned so much about the planets and my son and daughter both can recite the names of the planets and the order in which they are in.  This DVD has truly sparked an interest in space for my son.  He now enjoys books that are about space which are not even childrens books!  He often watches history channel documentaries on space which are geared toward adults! This is a great movie!

The only real educational element is that it gives the order of the planets. Other than that, you get songs on the level of Barney, dialogue so bad it annoyed my dogs, and the kind of sets that make Dr. Who look like Cecil B. DeMille. Again, my son is obsessed with anything interplanetary and he wouldn't sit through it.
If you love Barney, get it. If Barney makes you itch and/or you're looking something with even a modicum of educational content, don't bother.",1251763200,,572,4.563106796116505
2318201,4,B0009SCV0U,"My 3 year old son loves it and watches it all the time.  Which is great!  This is why I bought it and I'm glad I did for my son's sake.

However, my husband and I find it difficult to watch!  Its a low budget live action/computer animated film and its very obvious in the quality of animation.  And the songs are annoying to me.  The lead character, Jake, is also a little whiny at times, which is not behavior I want my son to emulate.

The only thing we can watch is the actual movie.  I can't access the DVD extras (lost our DVD player remote control).  So I can't give a review on those.

My review:  Good for kids, can be annoying for adults.",1245456000,,647,4.055555555555555
2318202,1,B0009SCV0U,"I bought this based on all the good reviews.  This is probably the worst kids DVD I've ever seen.  My 4 year old son loves learning about outer space.  This is the first dvd I've found about the planets rather than rocket etc.  My four year old could even tell that the info is out dated.  One could easily overlook the cheesy special effects, but the horrible singing and dancing can not.  With the quality of kids informational dvds available today, its a wonder this dvd is still being distributed.  We thought, well hoped, that the NASA footage would make up for the disappointing main feature, no luck.  All it is is some regurgitated NASA promotional films that move way to fast for any child, and you can barely hear or understand the voice over.  We have returned this dvd.",1236470400,,781,4.521428571428571
2318203,2,B0009SCV0U,"I bought this for my two year old after reading all of the reviews. Have you all watched this? Within the first 5 minutes the planets are calling each other 'fart face' and 'stinky'! Didn't expect that. This is a low-budget waste of money....my son is so obsessed with space and I was  excited to show this to him, that now that I really don't want him to, I have to find a substitute. Maybe this is ok for older children, but not if you don't want your two year old to start using negative terms.",1236124800,,497,4.177083333333333
2318204,3,B0009SCV0U,"My 4 year old enjoys this, and it does teach the order of the planets.  However, there just isn't much information beyond that.  I felt like there could have been a lot more information than what was provided.  Anyway, this is a fun little video for a 3 or 4 year old but I think a child older than that would probably be bored with it.

My #1 complaint, though, is that the little boy who is the main character is so whiny- at times it's like fingernails on a blackboard.

Oh, and the information is out-of-date since this was produced before Pluto was taken off the list of planets.",1233792000,,584,4.2727272727272725
2318205,5,B0009SCV0U,"I bought this DVD to show to my 2nd graders because it looked really cute and interesting.  I viewed the DVD last night for myself, and I really liked it.  It's very creative.  The songs are catchy, and there are ten of them...which I think would keep children interested.

The movie is basically about a little boy who gets left behind on field trip day, so he goes home and is very upset about it...but that's when the adventure begins.

The movie is actually only 30 minutes long, but after that...you can watch real videos from NASA (in 2004) showing what astronauts do and how things work (about 40 minutes).  The NASA part of the video could interest older children.

Also, you can go to Extras, where it has a song list from the movie. Any song you want to hear again is there, so you or your child can watch, listen, and sing along to your favorite(s) as many times as you want.  There is also a planet quiz with five questions.  If you get them all right, you get a certificate of merit (which you can print out if you put the DVD into your computer).

Overall, I thought this DVD was excellent.  There are so many little facts about each planet and the sun in the songs. There are also some funny, cheesy comments here and there that children will like.  As an adult, I enjoyed it and look forward to sharing it with my students.",1230336000,,1339,4.333333333333333
2318206,5,B0009SCV0U,"We bought this for our 3 year old who is really into planets and he really enjoys it as it's been one of his favorite shows over the last 6 months. The show reminds me a lot of a musical, where Jake goes up in a rocket ship to visit all nine planets (Pluto is a planet in this one...definitely not a dealbreaker though). Each of the songs that accompany Jake's trip thru the solar system is surprisingly well written and has a very catchy tune (admittedly, I had low expections)...some of the best songs I've heard for kids shows. It's also a great way for kids to learn the names of the planets and one or two characteristics about them (ie, Jupiter's Great Red Spot, windy Neptune). This is a very unique show by Wonderscape, and I haven't seen anyone else produce anything like it. So if your child is into space, rockets or planets, this is a real gem.",1226275200,,856,4.3229813664596275

Now, she is excited about her upcoming Brownie troop Astronomy field trip to gaze at the night sky.  As an adult, I appreciate the varied song styles and the humor.

There are not too many videos about the Solar System aimed at young children and this does a wonderful job in songs that any child can easily learn.  My 5 year old loves the Solar System and we would highly recommend this DVD. Well worth it.  I wish this company made more educational DVD's.

But guess what, my 4yo is CRAZY about it and after the 4th or 5th time it really grows on you. The songs are catchy (though I hate to admit it, LOL) It's pretty basic, which is perfect for a child who doesn't know anything about the solar system - they focus on one key point for each planet, easy for them to remember. But even my son, who enjoys Discovery Channel space programs, did not find this boring. I think it's worth the $$. You might get sick of being asked to put it in all day long, though!

I teach in a classroom of students with special needs.  THEY ALL LOVE IT!!  and more importantly, they all learned from it.  I designed some activities around it and still use it as a reward now that the unit is over b/c it is their number one favorite.

the tunes are a bit musical-esque and irritating, but they area catchy and filled with some useful info.  I wish they illustrated the rotation and orbiting around the sun more b/c that is difficult to teach without visuals.  It would have made it perfect.  Also the bonus feature is a cute quiz, but its not that thrilling.",1173312000,,734,4.299270072992701

Last night, my son was re-enacting a scene from the DVD and rattled off the names of all nine planets along with some other facts that he absorbed from his two viewings (back to back).  His father is ecstatic, and tonight we are going to do some star gazing together.  I think that since the planets are characters that my son's imagination and fascination ignited!

I am impressed that he can now name all the planets and their order from the sun.  He told me that Saturn's rings are made of ice and dust and that Jupiter is the biggest.  The song ""93 Million Miles Away"" really drives home the fact that the sun is 93 million miles from Earth.  The video is amazingly engaging and effective.

It really has helped my students to remember not only the names of the planets, but also detailed facts about them.

My 3-year-old and 6-year-old have learned many facts about our solar system from this DVD, some that I didn't even know.  They also love the music.  They've been singing it constantly since they first watched the program.  Who knew that it could be so fun to learn that the spot on Jupiter is a ""great big swirling storm"" or that Saturn's rings are made of ice and dust?  It's so much more fun to learn it when you're singing silly lyrics than it is to read it out of a textbook.

This DVD helped ignite a real interest in astronomy in our family and I'd highly recommend it to anyone.  It's educational, but in a fun disguise.",1143936000,,889,4.307228915662651

He then stopped and realized that he knew the distance the Sun is from the Earth.  What a seamless way to teach kids without them realizing it.  I give this DVD high marks for being original.

Because the planets are so fun and captivating my kids totally know these planets like they are their best friends.  It's so gratifying for my husband and me to hear them sing along with the film and have so much fun. There is even an interactive space quiz after the film that my kids love to take.
