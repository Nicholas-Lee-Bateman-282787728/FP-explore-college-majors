4384721,5,B004I9AR48,"These are the selections on the yoga Matrix menu:

Meditation Core Awakening (5:16):
Shiva starts with some gentle standing spine work, sweeping the arms overhead, coming into uddiyana bandha, rounding the spine and then rolling up.  She has several more rounds of uddiyana bandha, moves into agni sara, and then nauli kriya while circling the hips.  She closes with sweeping the arms overhead, and then dropping arms and upper body to sweep the arms by the side, repeating several times - and then a few brief moments of meditation with eyes closed.

I really liked this segment, although it may take me a while to master nauli kriya.  If you are new to uddiyana bandha, agni sara, or nauli kriya, you may wish to do some additional reading about these poses on the web.

Body Mandala 108 (23:18):
This is a very nice whole body segment, including over 108 rounds or repetitions.  I really liked the pace of the flow - steady but not rushed at all.  Each pose has several reps or pulses to it. Arm movements and counter poses are combined throughout. Poses include:
o Kalari squat (similar to chair pose, legs hip distance apart) (counter: standing forward bend)
o Pushups (set of 12) (counter: Anahatasana)
o Forearm side plank sweeping arm overhead and then back to side (var 1: top leg bent forward, foot resting on ground in front for support. Var 2: lifting top leg while sweeping the arm) (counter: cobra)
o Ab work with leg variations
o Bridge pose
o Table pose (counter: garudasana shoulder stretch and downward dog)
o High lunge, bending and straightening the back leg while sweeping the arms and then stretching back (counter: low cobra or upward dog to downward dog - child pose and kneeling half bow after second side)
o Repeats first part of flow with pushups (option of alternating leg lifts), side forearm planks (option of drawing one knee up and elbow down to the waist), abs, bridge pose (option of extending and lowering one leg), and table pose.
o  The flow ends with raising arms overhead and dropping to sweep them by the side, standing forward bend, and a squat.

Shakti Flow (20:40):
This flow was perfect for me to do on a Friday, to raise the spirits after a week of work. It  is the most fluid of the flows, starting with free form movement similar to her Trance Dance, but maybe a little more restrained.  This portion lasts about 4 minutes, shaking, rolling the spine, opening the hips, and twisting and is followed by Ha Kriya.  She moves into several fluid Uttanasana and high lunge variations, and then a flowing Virabhadrasana II vinyasa.  The next section flows back and forth between childs pose and cobra, followed by dhanurasana (bow pose) and parsva dhanurasana (side bow), and then plank pose alternating drawing one knee to the waist.  The next section alternates between high lunge and down dog, but offers a very energetic option where she says to ""leap like hanuman"" (I stayed with the lunge/down dog). I think the next pose she calls hanuman vira mudra from her kalari practice which is a squat variation, before slowing down into seated wide legged forward bend variations.  The flow closes with a brief seated meditation that includes alternate nostril breathing.

Vira Flow (23:23):
This flow has a variety of balance poses mixed throughout, several side plank variations, and many other poses mixed in.
o Balance poses include: garudasana (eagle), Ardha Chandrasana (half moon, option for Ardha Chandrasana Chapasana/half moon sugar cane), variations of standing hand to big toe pose (I used a strap), and ends with Svarga Dvidasana (bird of paradise).
o Side plank (Vasisthasana) variations start basic and progress to more challenging versions, based on your ability, ending with full vasisthasana with the top leg raised overhead while grasping the toe, and Visvamitrasana.  Don't worry if you can't do the advanced versions, because she offers basic variations.
o There is also a nice bow pose (dhanurasana) sequence with bow, half bow, side half bow.
This flow is a little faster than the Body Mandala sequence, and my first time through I did loose my place a couple times but think it will be fine now that I'm more familiar with it.

Bonus:  Heart Salutation from her Radiant Heart DVD (20:38)
Shavasana (6:15)

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:

The above sequences are on the Matrix menu, where you can pick individual flows to use by themselves or select several flows to combine together.  There is also a Bonus Features selection from the Main Menu that includes a Sun Salutation flow from Exhale Core Fusion: Energy Flow and also Shiva's Twisting Kriya from her Trance Dance DVD.

I am a big fan of Shiva - she is responsible for turning me on to yoga.  I really like the 20 minute segments as they are so easy to combine with other exercise, or use by themselves for a short routine.  I have all of her Acacia DVDs and the segments on AM Energy seem unique and fresh from her other work.  I see myself using this DVD over and over.",1297987200,83,4982,4.782963827304551
4384722,3,B004I9AR48,"I bought this video because I already have a Shiva Rea video that I kind of like and was hoping this one would be better.  Not so much.  I would recommend that people who use her videos be well versed in the Sanscrit names for yoga poses before attempting them.  I found it frustrating to be in a pose then have to look up at my tv to see what she was doing because I don't know the Sanscrit names.  It definitely spoiled the moment for me.  Also, Shiva is very flexible, and I found that distracting and discouraging at the same time.  If you have a hard-core yoga practice, by all means, this video is (probably) for you!  But if you're just looking for a good stretch/meditation video, I'd suggest something by Rodney Yee.",1393113600,,725,4.325925925925926
4384723,5,B004I9AR48,Just received this dvd a few weeks ago and I love it. I exercise with this every other day (only because I use her other dvd in between). It is challenging at times for this beginner/ intermediate but she is very encouraging. Her yoga style is beautifully rhythmic and has the best transition I have seen. It helps me de-stress and tone at the same time :)  ...what more could you ask for?,1386892800,,389,4.328767123287672
4384724,5,B004I9AR48,"I must first start out to say, this DVD is NOT FOR BEGINNERS!

Prior to my move to Germany two years ago, I did yoga in a class room. Once I moved, I had smaller options for yoga classes in English, so I bought the Element: AM & PM Yoga for Beginners. While Element: AM & PM Yoga for Beginners is a wonderful DVD, it is just what it says - for beginners. If you are new at yoga, I highly recommend the Element: AM & PM Yoga for Beginners  for you. But, after doing this DVD for two years and been having experience in yoga for a few years prior, I wasn't feeling much any more and I felt I needed more of a challenge. That being said, Shiva Rea definitely met my expectations. I was not able to do all the moves in the more advanced mode, but I am working up to that. I figure in a couple years from now, I can move on even further.

I also like this DVD because it is specifically designed for morning as it includes an awakening meditation, then three segments (20 mins each) to choose from and then closing shavasana. It is invigorating and helps you wake up. As an early riser (and I say that as in 4AM early riser), it helps me get my day started and feel better throughout.",1376870400,,1179,4.051502145922747
4384725,5,B004I9AR48,"I can honestly say that I would not made it through college without my daily Shiva Rea workout.
She was my mentor during college and my favorite professor.

What I learned from her was to be my own inner-teacher.
I am still learning.....",1366156800,,237,4.511627906976744
4384726,4,B004I9AR48,"Just watching Shiva Rae feels like a workout in itself. Her flexibility is a wonderment. I am not being sarcastic at all. I tried doing the first flow, and while I did get through it (heavily modifying many of the moves, I'm just not near there yet, or ever probably!) I ended up on my rug sweating and panting like a dog.

While I love Shiva's cuing and descriptions of the moves, she does not stop the flow of her routine to show what those modifications are that she speaks of. I understand why. Really! I think I might have to put this one aside for a bit until I can keep up with her.",1362268800,,589,4.121739130434783
4384727,2,B004I9AR48,"Her ""style"" of yoga is very hard to follow... Her ""routines"" are all so similar.  There are no ""set"" routines and there is so much constant movement, which is not what yoga is about.  It's more like a platform for her to show off how flexible and sensual she is. There is a grid, and you have to choose and select the routines.  The visual is outstanding, but the explanation of what she is doing is far from adequate.  One constantly has to look up and try and figure out what the heck she is doing ""now""... she moves very fast...  Non traditional yoga / dance style all her own... entertaining to sit and watch with popcorn, but very difficult if you are serious about doing yoga, (I have done yoga for years)...  I am hoping that I can somehow force myself to start liking her style... but it's not for a beginner, or someone wanting traditional yoga.. She rarely even mentions breathing or breath work...

It should be called "" yoga influenced - dance movement in nature""....  then it would describe what it is about, and what she does.",1359849600,3,1040,4.436842105263158
4384728,4,B004I9AR48,I bought this looking for a good quick yoga workout to jump start my morning routine. It certainly gets the job done but some of the workouts a bit lacking in the creativity I love about Shiva's yoga routines. The warmup is kind of odd and I've come to rely on the first workout as my go to strength training because it really works everything and I still am working at getting through the entire routine with all of the advance variations. The second routine is a good stretch when my muscles are sore and tight. The third and the bonus I really haven't given a chance. I'd say this is a good video to throw into an already established rotation but I wouldn't rely on it because it gets old fast.,1357516800,2,697,4.287878787878788
4384729,5,B004I9AR48,"I use this dvd at any time of the day, I love how the matrix is set up so you can personalize your own workout, it is very relaxing and toning",1356134400,,142,3.6129032258064515
4384730,5,B004I9AR48,"I love this.  The matrix set up is fantastic for mornings when I have limited time.  I love the mix and match, and the shavasana is the most amazing start to my day.  Love the selection of workouts too... The shakti flow is gentle and energizing.  The body mandela is more challenging, building endurance.  And the bonus workout requires focus and balance...really challenging in the morning, but wonderful in the afternoons.  Overall, this is my go-to workout!  Love Shiva Rae and can't wait to explore more of her work.",1353456000,,521,4.786516853932584
4384731,5,B004I9AR48,"This was my first Shiva Rea dvd and the one that made me love yoga.  I am an experienced exerciser and a dvd collector.  I have gone through many exercise trends.  I am at the point in my life where I want to do things because I love to do them not because I have to.  Exercise has always been like eating a vegetable you don't like, I did it because it was good for me.  With yoga, I do it for more than what it can do for my body.  That said the first three dvd's I purchased for yoga totally turned me off, and I almost gave up on yoga.  My friend kept encouraging me and said I really needed yoga in my life.  She is a former personal trainer and is on her way to getting her teaching certification in yoga.  I trust she knows what she is talking about.  Shiva Rea does yoga like I imagined yoga should be.  Some people don't like her cuing or lack thereof.  I have found that no dvd has perfect cuing and sometimes you just have to look at what she is doing until you are used to the routine.  I really like the matrix in this dvd, how you can make your own routine and try something new each time.  I especially like this because of my time limitations.  I recommend this dvd if you like flowing, beautiful yoga.  I recommend if you are a person with high stress who needs to slow down and get in touch with your body and breath.",1346198400,2,1335,4.0
4384732,5,B004I9AR48,"Whew!
I was in Boston, MA working. At the same time as recovering from a surgery.  My Physical Therapist said to look for the ""Fitness & Health"" on Demand section of the cable provider at the place I was staying.  I did so.  I found a yoga workout that helped me put my healing into perspective.  The television teacher was this woman named Shiva Rea.  She explained what I was asking my body to do and just how it would help my body heal.  And she also hinted at a deeper spiritual connection to this activity I was fairly new to. (not completely, but it had been a good 27 years since I learned what I knew and I was just getting started practicing again...)

After working out successfully there, I returned home to the Pacific Northwest and found that my cable company didn't have the same options under the ""Health & Fitness"" headings that were available in Boston.  Oh no!  What was going to happen to my new found relationship to yoga?  And what if I never found a teacher so understanding and knowledgeable?

Well, I found a local yoga studio that fit my needs, and then it was off to another region of our country to work again.  And I'm here for a longer stay than I was in Boston.  But I remembered the name of the company that produced this workout, and tracked down DVD's by this teacher.  But never found the workout that had so firmly re-connected me to practicing yoga again. Until now...

THIS is the DVD!!  The A.M. Yoga Matrix is PERFECT for me!  I love being able to guide my work and meditation by making the choices she gives us!  It you want to practice again, or even for the first time, SHIVA REA will get you started on this video.  It can be a very valuable tool in your quest to re-connect with your body. Do yourself a favor and go ahead.  You really will not be sorry.",1341792000,,1798,4.294642857142857
4384733,5,B004I9AR48,"This is a wonderful yoga DVD.Most ages could use it,or sections of it to enhance their day. Even the shavasana at the end is useful for everyone. great to watch as well,which you need to do at the beginning.",1330560000,2,207,4.333333333333333
4384734,5,B004I9AR48,"I have been using this DVD on and off for a few months now. All the practices are new and different for Shiva, but for me the one I keep coming back to is Shakti Flow - this practice is worth the price of admission! The free form dance followed by the yoga flow and closing mediation comes together to provide the perfect self-contained practice. It brings me joy every time I do it and I feel amazing for the rest of the day - the music is really uplifting too! The bonus Heart Salutation is wonderful for winding down before bed or for taking a break during times of stress. This practice is slow and relaxing, and I find it brings peace.

The other practices on the DVD are intermediate, which I understand is not for everyone, but I like to have something to work towards. The extras on this DVD also add value to this disc.

I really loved another of Shiva's DVDs, Yoga Trance Dance, but I know it wasn't for everyone. Shakti Flow provides a nice opportunity to let loose with some free form movement before moving into the yoga movements, so if you want  to let go and enjoy yourself for a fun yoga session, I highly recommend this practice.",1321660800,16,1147,4.325581395348837
4384735,3,B004I9AR48,"I think I would have liked this more if I had done a beginner one with her.  Her style is a little different, not sure if I really care for it.",1318809600,,143,3.6129032258064515
4384736,5,B004I9AR48,"It's like taking an actual class!  The clever design allows you to program your own workouts and duration.  Only enough time for stretching, no problem; just feel like relaxing with a 6 minute shivasana session, no sweat!  It's easy to follow while giving you the burn and workout you need.

I highly recommend the dvds by Shiva Rea.",1316131200,5,333,4.689655172413793
4384737,3,B004I9AR48,"I'm a beginner/intermediate when it comes to yoga.  I have Shiva Rea's, Gaiam Prenatal Yoga DVD and liked her in that so I thought I'd try one of her Acacia DVDs.  This DVD was my first experience with her (aside from the prenatal DVD) and I didn't like it much.  I thought it was kind of odd. Particularly the Body Mandala 108 and a little of the Shakti Flow (didn't like the Trance Dance). BUT this is just me personally.  I think that if you are an avid Shiva user you will love it.  I was going to give it 2 stars but I gave it 3 because there were some cool moves I'd like to do someday (in the vira flow) and also I did feel sore muscles the next day, which I thought was good.  AND I like that you can choose which part from the matrix which you'd like to do.",1313712000,3,766,3.9415584415584415
4384738,5,B004I9AR48,"I have gone through the whole DVD at this point and I enjoyed it although it was a bit unusual - the movements were more flowing, even dancing, and very different from any other yoga routines I ever encountered.  There is also a bonus routine, so it is a total of four 20-minute routines plus intro meditation and shavasanna so the full routine is 30 minutes.  The bonus routine is more relaxing and almost more appropriate for the PM.  The level of energy varies for each routine so even though it is an ""AM"" DVD not all of them have me rearing to go full of energy although they are all good fully rounded sequences.  I wouldn't recommend this for someone just starting a yoga practice, it is more of a fun variation for a person with a steady routine looking for variety.  I would recommmend her ""Daily Energy - Vinyasa Flow Yoga"" for a more standard daily routine.",1313625600,6,868,4.433962264150943
4384739,5,B004I9AR48,"I have almost all of Shiva Rea's yoga DVDs (I didn't get Yoga Trans Dance) and this one is definitely chartering into new waters with a style and poses that have not been on other Shiva Rea DVDs. It works muscle groups that haven't been worked on other discs, in a slightly calesthenic type style of doing movements in repetition. The music is really wonderful (per usual) and it is challenging enough for intermediate level yogis in pretty good shape. No sun salutations or many warrior type poses in the traditional sense--it was similar in a way to Janet Stone's Radient Flow.

Don't miss this DVD, especially if you do a lot of yoga at home - it will add an interesting and fresh variety to your yoga practice.",1309392000,19,714,4.534883720930233
4384740,5,B004I9AR48,"This new A.M. Energy Practice from Shiva Rea is exquisite perfection. She always amazes me but this newest is like a little slice of Heaven on Earth. Shiva Rea's words, thoughts, prayers, directives, guidance, inspiration are invaluable, healthy, empowering, soulful. I am so happy to have this new practice process and feel I will be using it nearly every day for a long time to come. Many thanks and blessings, NJ",1302134400,9,415,4.859154929577465
4384741,4,B004I9AR48,"I finally tried this DVD today and definitely enjoyed most of it but all kinds of little minuses made me give it only 4 stars (4.5 stars actually). For more detailed review, check out Jenny G's great review. I already tried Vira Flow a few times before which was available on Acacia's website, I liked it very much and it's my favorite of the 3 flows (as well as the most advanced) since it's the most pure yoga of them all and fits good in my usual practice, it has a lot of standing balances including eagle pose and a whole lot of side plank variations which I like, the minus for me is that you never really hold the standing poses very long. The 5 min core awakening segment includes nauli kriya and such, familliar to me from my ashtanga classes that I used to take but which I never really liked, especially because I can't do all those weird belly things (-:. Body mandala 108 was definitely fitness oriented practice including 12 reps of every move, though I did notice Shiva didn't really do 12 reps everytime... the pushups followed by variations of forearm side plank were definitely challenging but the rest of the practice not so much, but it's a nice warm up, though I think I will get bored doing reps of every move. BTW the volume on this segment was lower for some reason than the other segments which I find annoying. Shakti flow was definitely refreshing, it's a mix of fluid power and a little bit of trance dance starting with some free form dance moves and flowing standing poses, bow and side bow which I liked, finishing with short alternate nostril breathing. The bonus segment that is also in the matrix is heart salutation from the radiant heart dvd which is a good bargain if you don't have it because it's pretty much the whole DVD since the other 2 segments from it are short redundant moving meditations, that DVD was never a favorite of mine either but it's a nice flow of backbends and side opening. The Shavasana on this dvd is 6 minutes which is the longest of all her dvd's which is good but I didn't like the chanting in the song which was loud and distracting for me, she closes this segment sitting with some mudra. Unlike Jenny I don't see myself do this DVD over and over unfortunately since I don't feel it will add much to my regular practice except vira flow which adds some challenge. I wish she would make some more advanced practices in the future that builds up to a certain culminating pose which vira flow came close to. Overall a nice addition if you want something different and definitely nice practices for the morning.. or evening if you're not a morning person like me.",1301011200,8,2626,4.461538461538462
