7730561,1,B01E606F8A,"I tried to like this movie, but it was unrecognizeable from the the original in the series, The Shunning.  They have changed out every character from Katie, her parents, tonDaniel and pretty much all to the detriment of the video.  The acting is very lightweight and disappointing.  Stick with the books, they are much better.",1461196800,9,326,4.890909090909091

7730589,5,B01E606F8A,The third movie in the series which brings the final book of the series to the conclusion. We purchase many Amish movies and books and this series is a perfect addition to our library. It is perfect for the entire family to watch and enjoy.,1496275200,,240,4.355555555555555

7730594,1,B01E606F8A,"Not true to the book at all. The first movie was excellent. The second was only so-so. The third, however, is painfully bad. The lead character is a horrible actress with a bad accent she kept slipping in and out of. What's with the strange faces, over-acting, and wrinkled nose? The movie was so bad that it took us two evenings to get through, and only then because we paid for it and couldn't return it. Definitely NOT recommended. Stick to the books instead.",1490572800,4,462,4.511904761904762

7730609,5,B01E606F8A,"Nice job in the acting and the movie no major violence parts and was easy to watch.  Movie arrived on time and in good condition.  This is the third part of this series and, even though I was not surprised by the ending it was likable and I can watch it with anyone without worrying about what might show up onscreen such as some movies nowadays.",1475193600,,346,4.2272727272727275

7730611,3,B01E606F8A,"The movie if ok but did not follow the book at all.  Apparently, whoever created/directed this chapter of the trilogy, did not read the first two.

7730623,4,B01E606F8A,"We've been looking forward to watching this DVD since we finished the sequel. Although the story line continued, the actors portraying several characters completely changed yet again. We enjoyed watching it, but the changes did detract from the story.",1473811200,,251,5.461538461538462
7730624,4,B01E606F8A,This is part 3 of 3. I couldn't wait to see this conclusion but I was very disappointed with the casting changes. But still a great movie.,1473638400,5,138,4.148148148148148

7730626,5,B01E606F8A,I already had the two other DVDs in the series and wanted this to complete my collection.  The movie still pops up on Hallmark or the Hallmark Movie Channel occasionally.  I enjoyed the storyline and will still watch now and then.  The main character in the movie is played by Katie Laclerc who stars in Switched At Birth which was broadcast on ABC Family and now will show the final season on Freeform (renamed Family Channel).,1472947200,3,428,4.605263157894737

7730635,3,B01E606F8A,Not as good as the first two episode. Poor casting and acting resulted in characters that were endearing or not believable.,1471132800,,123,4.904761904761905

7730638,2,B01E606F8A,"This sequel to Beverly Lewis' ""Shunning"" and ""Confession"" was a huge disappointment. Most of the original actors were changed and dId NOT fit the roles. I was sorry I bought it.",1471046400,6,177,4.741935483870968
7730639,5,B01E606F8A,This movie was just as I expected. The previous two movies flowed right along with the storyline of The Reckoning.  It showed how kindness and generosity can make a huge difference in people's lives.,1470960000,,199,4.852941176470588

7730652,5,B01E606F8A,I love all of Beverly Lewis movies. But this one goes to a series of three. About a rich girl who used to be Amish. Fulls in love with a guy and is about to marry him. But an old fame shows up. Really I don't want to tell everything about it. I have watched this movie over and over again. All three of them. They are really good. I have the three books now I am glad I have the movies. Get them watch them is all I am going to say.,1470441600,,432,3.6559139784946235

7730660,5,B01E606F8A,Love that the whole series was made. Hope more of Beverly Lewis is made into movies.,1468540800,,84,4.3125
7730661,4,B01E606F8A,"The tone of the movie is different from the first two, because so many of the actors have been changed from the first two movies. This movie in no way follows the books except for when Rosie wrote a letter to Katherine's Amish mother; and her mother responded. It made the Justin character seem like he was just helping Katherine run the estate and not actualyl be a lawyer as mention in the second movie. Justin Worth her love interest has no character, or charisma in the movie to make it more of a challenge for Katherine to pick between the two. I like the Justin in the second movie better. However the actor who played Daniel is older in this movie and portrayed the character better. Daniel didn't get enough screen time though. Katie/Katherine did get to meet her father in the movie, however not in the book. Justin was an artist not a lawyer as in the book. And Daniel didn't go into service in the original book, but faked his drowning accident so his family and Katie/Katherine wouldn't be shunned. Daniel wanted to join the Mennonite church. In the book Katherine had a shocked/delayed reaction to Daniel appearing after his supposed death. Katherine's reaction in the movie was too dramatic, drawn out, and sudden. I would recommend the movie because it gives closure to the series and not as mainstream Christian message like in the book, quoting scripture. In a way I think the movie gave more closure to the series. Why? You'll have to watch to see.",1468108800,4,1466,4.620689655172414
