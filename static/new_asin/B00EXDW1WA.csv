5949199,3,B00EXDW1WA,"Pack four dashing Filipina babes into one family home. Make them wear shorties and give them a few intrigues and secrets to work on, sprinkle it with love, betrayal and revenge, then add comedic relief. Wouldn't that make for a great movie?

Well, partly it does. And all those guapas do a nice job in looking splendid and acting agreably. But then there are several supporting actors playing awkwardly, and I mean awkwardly, over the top (these gross clowns receive top notes from Pinoy reviewers though). Moreover, most of the movie takes place in one family home, it feels like theater. Not to mention the painfully drawn-out family reconciliation in the second half with buckets of embarrassing tears, ""Sorry. Sorry"", ""I love you"" and ""I love you too"".

Hit director Cathy Garcia-Molina repeats her success recipe from You Changed My Life in a Moment and It Takes a Man and a Woman (the latter appeared in 2013, just as Four Sisters): She puts goodlooking, energetic ladies in the center and makes the guys look like indifferent extras. She uses cozy background music over long stretches and she shows mostly very rich people. Manila airport and some overseas jobs do belong into a Garcia-Molina movie too.

I got my DVDs straight from a reputable mall shop in the Philippines, published by Star Home Video. I believe that I have an original print. The image quality is low, with slightly muted colors and no crisp sharpness. The English subtitles are mostly ok, and about 15 percent of the dialogue is in straight English anyway. Besides the movie itself, you get a bit of making-of, deleted scenes, bloopers and takes of the stars' promotional appearances (in shorties, you guessed it).",1390608000,,1692,4.888501742160279

5949203,4,B00EXDW1WA,"This movie was so ridiculous -- surprisingly touching, even if a bit overly-dramatic (then again, it's a Filipino movie!).  I found myself quite drawn in to the story; even if the characters might seem somewhat flat and stereotypical, the overall family dynamic is compelling--it touches home to what happens in many families, I believe!",1482537600,,337,5.2407407407407405

5949213,5,B00EXDW1WA,"Fun watch fot entire family.  Not your typical b*tch slaps and whoring around movie.  Subtitles made helped us understand some of the Tagalog words we didn't understand. Acting was good, especially Angel Locsin, but all were good.  Funny movie.  Would watch it again and again.",1470700800,,277,5.088888888888889

5949220,5,B00EXDW1WA,"This movie will flood you with so many emotions, from laughing, tearing (the tears won't fall, but it's a possibility that they might do just that) to shaking your head. I really  enjoyed the storyline. It's relatable. No matter what happens, family will always stick together...or at least they should. This is my first time watching a Filipino movie and I'm really looking forward to watching more. I even want to learn the language and dialect myself, lol. If you're looking for a movie to watch that will make you laugh, cry or both...this is it. It's not your usual chick flick and I liked the plot and turn of events that occurred within the movie. As each scene takes place, you have a general idea of what will happen next, but there's still enough mystery that will leave you guessing",1463616000,2,793,4.624113475177305
5949221,5,B00EXDW1WA,"I love this movie, it reminded me of me and my sisters.  Lots of funny drama.  The ending was the best lots of crying and family repaired broken relationships and sisters make up for past and hurt feelings.  Recommend if you have sisters '",1462406400,,239,4.386363636363637

5949227,5,B00EXDW1WA,It's a drama comedy with a strong cast of actresses. The storylines were woven together well and involved each of the characters in their own subplots that all tied together in the end. I recommend it to anyone who likes Filipino comedy dramas and to anyone who likes comedy dramas in general. There are subtitles for the non Tagalog speakers.,1448582400,,343,4.733333333333333

The laughter, the arguments, the tears, and the love all the actors shared in this movie hits home. I would love to go into full detail about the movie but trust me, you won't be disappointed by watching this. Many movies either had a slow beginning or a confusing plot but this movie kept me entertained the whole way through.
