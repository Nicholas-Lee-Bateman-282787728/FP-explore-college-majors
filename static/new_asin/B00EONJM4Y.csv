5931673,5,B00EONJM4Y,"Wow, what a powerful series. I came across this while looking for a new murder mysteries series.
I don't like gore and horror, but I love murder mysteries that are entertaining with a  brilliant script and cast.
Peaky Blinders is all that and more, Cillian Murphy portrays the well loved, well respected head of the Shelby family,
He is also the ring leader of the town and Peaky Blinders. He has everyone doing his bidding in a very quiet understated demeanor. Being as good looking as Cillian Murphy is, it only lends to enhance his character and you find yourself rooting for him instead of Sam Niell who plays Major Chester Campbell who comes to clean up the town and the Peaky Blinders.
Yes you have to listen very closely as the brogue is very thick and it's easy to miss something important.
All in all I enjoyed it immensely and can't wait for season 2. There were only 6 episodes in season 1 that left me hungering for more.",1412553600,11,933,4.488235294117647
5931674,1,B00EONJM4Y,"I'm the  biggest BBC and Acorn fan in the world, but I couldn't watch more than 20 minutes of this horrible production.

Why use theme/background music that is from a different era than the series?  African American blues music is not appropriate here.

Nor are Australian accents.  I had to check to make sure this is supposed to be in Birmingham England, since half the cast have the wrong dialect.  However, Sam Neil does a great job with the Belfast accent.

Extras in a supposed spark-filled iron works standing around swinging sledge hammers that hit nothing but dirt, a prim young Irish girl who walks into a rough bar and gets hired by emptying spittoons while wearing a tailored suit and linen blouse (oh, but she has a sweet singing voice)--puh lease.

I was looking forward to watching this because I admire Cillian Murphy, but I'm sorry to see he ended up in this crap series.",1412380800,12,888,4.647435897435898
5931675,2,B00EONJM4Y,"This is a poor excuse for a period series, and the soundtrack ruins the show beyond belief.  Why the hell you have a period drama and play contemprary rock music throughout as mood music is beyond me.  What purpose does 'The White Stripes' music serve in 1919 Britain???  This series is slow moving and hard to watch.  If you want a great British period drama, try out Ripper Street instead.",1411948800,7,391,4.542857142857143
5931676,4,B00EONJM4Y,great cast!  we have watched the first episode and are savoring this.,1410307200,3,69,4.75
5931677,5,B00EONJM4Y,"Can't see this show in the USA.  I was able to pre-order the DVD.  It has to be played on a Region Free DVD player, which I have.  I am enjoying the show.  This is Season 1, hopefully the other seasons will come out also.",1400457600,,221,3.8444444444444446
5931678,5,B00EONJM4Y,Stumbled across this series last fall and I am absolutely in love with this show.  Cillian Murphy is a treasure and it's fantastic to see his character develop throughout the series.  I can't wait for season 2 as rumor has it Tom Hardy has just been cast!!,1398124800,14,256,4.425531914893617
5931679,5,B00EONJM4Y,"Peaky Blinders has not ""officially"" arrived in the US as of yet, but it is on it's way.
I believe after is has shown here it will be available on DVD Region 1. In the meantime,
it is available on other venues and I encourage you to seek them out.
A friend from the UK sent it to me on flash drive and I could not stop watching.
The whole show from cinematic photography, costuming, story line, actors/actresses,
diaglogue....Is one of most wonderful shows I have ever seen...At my age, I have seen
a lot...This is a must see for everyone...When I see that it received on a average of 3.5
stars...I have to wonder, did we watch the same show?
I would like to add, the music accompanying this show was so appropriate. I am one
who detests contemporary music in period dramas/comedies...but in this instance, it worked
perfectly....
I encourage anyone who enjoys a great drama, especially a period piece like this to find a
way to watch or ear mark it for when it comes to the US...Which I believe will not be far off.
It has already been renewed for a second season in the UK...",1394668800,50,1076,4.385
5931680,2,B00EONJM4Y,"Amazing how people fall for a few artsy poses. So much potential-- the cast alone (Murphy, Neill, a splendid Helen McCrory) should be worth the price of admission-- and then the script, the painfully ""modern"" soundtrack, and the music-video cinematography come blundering in and wreck the whole thing. To put it bluntly, nothing much happens. Should-be protagonist (or anti-hero) Murphy wishy-washes his way along (very prettily, granted) as ""conflicted"" gang-leader and drug-dulled war vet Tommy Shelby, the so-called violence and brutality of the piece are nothing short of silly (and in slow-mo as well), and the less said about the musical aspect of the mess (not to mention the theoretically angelic singing of a certain central character), the better. Shows just how little the Beeb has to exert itself to win over the short-attention-span Twitter crowd-- and, unfortunately, how little experience Steven Knight has as a writer for television (a solid script editor might at least have solved the pacing problems, and salvaged a few downright head-scratchers in terms of consistency). Handsome in its grim, grimy way, but possessed of very little in the way of plot or substance. Pity.",1388707200,10,1191,5.273684210526316

8607529,1,B00EONJM4Y,"There are some fine actors who are totally wasted in this total mess of a thing. Cillian Murphy (in particular) deserves better scripts and better directors to work with. Too bad talented actors have to perform in such infantile garbage. If you can wade through this, the second season even adds Finn Cole, Charlotte Riley, and the great Tom Hardy. These gifted actors are worth watching, but the writing (and even the horrible music) are such a distraction, Peaky Blinders is hard to recommend. The pace is so slow (pointlessly slow) and the writing is so weak and unoriginal, that it feels like the writers are stretching their tiny ideas across hours of wasted effort just to get paid. This is very disappointing.",1523318400,,716,4.829268292682927
